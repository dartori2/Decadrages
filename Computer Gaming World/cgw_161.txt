"JOHNNY WILSON Ho, Ho, 2.0 My Holiday Wish List for Every Gamer ince much of this issue concerns holiday gift giving, I couldn't help compiling a list of the gifts I'd most like to see for computer gamers and the industry. As in the letters to Santa that some of us wrote as kids, some of these wishes may be unre: alistic, but it never hurts to ask. able to use their machines longer than two years, and for software publishers not to have to guess at new base machine requirements two years down the line. We might also see more done about bugs if publishers were able to test only one platform, rather than many. order to get DirectX titles to run correctly would be a \"provisional govern ment\" that would give way to an give way to an unencumbered paradise. Things haven't turned out that way, but that hope still lives on. the number of games that are mere clones of others. Check out my short list of new ideas. Although some of these games wouldn't make money with our current distribution system, ( wish A STABLE GAMING PLATFORM I know, I've said that it's impossible to have a stable gaming plat form. The \"Hot Rod Syndrome\" will always keep gamers going for the newest, fastest, hottest machines available. The time frame for new generations of processors will keep diminishing, and new hardware peripherals like 3D and force-feed back will continue to appear. Still, it would be nice for gamers to be DIRECTX TOOLS THAT WORK It was only a couple of years ago that we heralded the Windows Gaming Revolution. We truly believed that DirectX would help us with such things as driver issues, machine compatibility, and devel. opment libraries. We thought that all of this would make it easier for gamers to install and run games, as well as for publishers to create and test games while supporting multiple peripherals. We hoped that the kind of noodling around that developers were having to do in NEW GAME DISTRIBUTION I wish we had a retail distribution system for computer games in which the retailers cared about games, and made their money from selling them. I'm afraid that, as long as they make their money off cooperative advertising, marketing pro. grams, and special display allowances, we'll never see the kind of product selection and availability that gamers deserve. I hope that the continued expansion of the Web makes it possible for publishers and small developers to build games and take them right to the players with out having to be in stores. If ever we needed an alternative sales distribution method, we need it now. indly we had a retail distribution system in which the retailers cared about games. 72 Johnny's Dream-Game List we may still see them someday-if one of my earlier wishes comes true. DRAGONRIDERS OF PERN 3D fantasy action with management and politics RAT PATROL 3D, vehicular machine-gun combat in North Africa OSS OR MIS WWII adventure game based on declassified intelligence documents A SUPERHERO RPG When are we finally going to see a good one? A MAD VICTORIAN RPG Based on Castle Falkenstein or the Lord Darcy novels WWII SUB SIM A oneor two-man submarine sim would be amazing INDIANAPOLIS SPEEDWAY LEGENDS Covering the A.J. Foyt and Parnelli Jones era HOCKEY MOGUL Sports management on ice THE GODFATHER Mob management: numbers, drugs, dames, intrigue, and murder NEW WARGAME FODDER Something based on Frederick the Great, the English Civil War, the Irish Easter Rebellion, or the Wars of the Roses A CALENDAR OF GAME RELEASES The entertainment software industry tends to schedule titles for the fourth quarter, a cyclic prescription for retail glut, product slippage, and poor sales. I wish com panies would schedule products for a full year of distribution so that gamers would get a chance to own and play all of the worthy titles. YES, JOHNNY, THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS I don't suppose there is any cause for me to be looking through my holiday packages this year for any of the games from this list, but since I refuse to grow up, I'll keep hoping for next Christmas and the next and the next.

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH ASTRO NAUGHTS As I just finished watching the trailer for the new WING COMMANDER game, I couldn't help but feel the same disappointment I felt while watching the Star Wars movies or any episode of Star Trek What do they think would conduct the sound vibrations in outer space? Also, these games don't correctly simulate space travel. If we travelled at the speed of light, it would take us four years to get to the nearest star. Even if we had at our clisposal some sort of spacecraft that could generate an enormous amount of acceleration, it would take us several weeks just to reach Mars. Plus, the speed at which we would have to travel woull be extremely unpleasant, if not lethal. The only games that have ever tried lo realistically simulate space travel were Elrre and its successors. I just wonder why people keep calling these arcade games \"space simulators.\" Johannes Commeren New Jersey STAR BORED Hey, I just wanted to inform you of a little error in the \"Prophecy Motive\" article in October's issue. Terry Coleman wrote \"...some over 3 kilometers long-has to be seen to be believed. It takes a long time just to fly past one of these monsters. In comparison, the Star Wars Death Star would look like a PT boat in the wake of a battleship.\" I know this might make me sound like an obsessed Star Wars fan, but even the Super Star Destroyer, the one that crashed into the Death Star in Return of the Jedi, is 8 kilometers long, almost three times as long as the ships he was describing. The object of his comparison is much, much more massive. The first Death Star was 140 kilometers in diameter and the second was 160 kilometers in diameter. Maybe he just got the comparison backwards and the Death Star is the battleship and WING COMMANDER capital ship is the PT boat or, more accurately, a person in a lifejacket floating in the ocean. Anyway, keep up the good work. I think CGW is the best computer game magazine out there and I have the collection (without a missed issue since 1993) to prove it. Lawrence Zalasky via the Internet In Star Wars, Jolm Williams conducted the vibrations, as well as the orchestra, right? Seriously, the games and the movies would all have been pretty boring without sound. We always thought ELITE was without sound because it was done on the Apple II. Chirps versus cool Midi explosions just don't cut it. THE WIZARD OF OS I have a question about games and operating systems. I personally do not like Windows 95, as I prefer to use Windows NT 4.0, which is more stable. Some of the literature on it has stated that for an application to carry the Windows logo, it must run on both Windows 95 and Windows NT without difficulty. However, when I tried to run RED ALERT (which has the logo) on WinNT, I got an error message informing me that it was a Win 95-only program. Are games subject to different standards than applications, or is there a way to get NT to run games that have the logo but are \"only Win 95\"? Robert Marks via the Internet Hmm, while Darth Vader's ship, The Executor, was indeed 8 kilometers long, our CGW lab rat and official Star Wars fan, Scooter, indicates that most destroyers were 1.6 kilometers long. Scooter cites West End Games' Imperial Sourcebook for the Star Wars Role-playing Game, and A Guide to the Star Wars Universe as his sources. The number of Super-class Star Destroyers depends on whether you believe the movies only Vader's was shown) or the numerous books (which agree on five such vessels), but nevertheless the normal Star Destroyers we see in all the movies and games are only 1.6 kilometers long. In fact, if you boot up TIE FIGHTER and go to the ship section, it will list the length of an Imperial Star Destroyer as 1.600 meters. Since these figures support Terry Coleman's figure of speech, we're going to stand by it. Business applications must run under both operating systems in order to receive the logo. However, since DirectX las not yet been integrated into the Windows NT operating system, it is not possible to require compliance between games that, like RED ALERT, use DirectX and the Windows NT operating system. Currently, NT uses Direct Draw and Direct Sound, but does not have D3D, Direct Input, and Direct Play. We hope that Microsoft will eventually integrate DirectX into NT and migrate everyone onto that platform. However, that doesn't seem to be a high priority. BIG SHIP WING COMMANDER PROPHECY'S capital ships are three kilometers long while the big STAR WARS vessels are 1.6-8 kilometers long, but it's not the size of the ship that matters as much as how you use it LEGENDS OR MYTHS? I saw the ad for Accolades LEGENDS FOOTBALL game in your magazine and expect a review is forthcoming. As you prepare, I thought I would point out something interesting that my friends and I noticed. We love football, and were hoping LEGENDS might serve as a good vehicle for a group league. In the ad, the top left box says, \"You Want Stats? We Cot Stats!\" But take a look at all those QBs listed on the screenshot. Every one of them shows a completion percentage which is higher in some cases over 10 percent higher than the actual quarterback (except for Troy Aikman, and his is only 1 percent lower). Good coaches look for tendencies. This signals to me that this is another in the scemingly endless «pass-happy\" games that appeal to the Nintendo mentality who feel that unless there is a touchdown every other possession, CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

"The 1Computer Game Magazine COMUTAL LETTERS world the game must be boring. It is a shame, because the graphics do look very nice and there appears to be a multitude of options. But sports fans have to send the game companies a message. A sports simulation, whether football, baseball, or any other sport, is useless unless one can count on realistic results. I look forward to your review. Rik Fontana Orlando, FL far, I am sure they will not jump out of their shoes to send me back some working CDs. I hope you will be able to wam people who have not yet given their $55 to Interplay so that they will not go through the same headaches I am experiencing lan Umland via the Internet We, too, were disappointed in the final version of the game. You'll find our review on page 362. Unfortunately, we have no good advice for you if you're willing to buy the game as soon as it comes out. Even we've been fooled by pre-release versions of games that ran soundly and had fcatures that were subsequently removed before shipping. The sad fact is that those on the leading edge are usually on the bleeding edge, because there are dozens of factors that work against stable, tested code for every possible system configuration. STARFLEET: A TRAVESTY After having purchased and played the justreleased STARFLEET ACADEMY, I have a few gripes I would like to share. Loyal gamers, such as myself, who buy the first available copy of a game, are usually the ones who get the most grief with bugs. This first group consists of de facto beta testers who must endure the game without any patches. Yet, they receive little help from the software publishers tech support departments because there are, as yet, no identified problems with the game. Do you have any advice for DOUBLE TALK I was intrigued to find diametrically opposed reviews for Mear PUPPET in your magazine and on your Web site. (Robert Coffey gave the game + out of 5 in Computer Gaming World, and Greg Kasavin gave it a 4.3 out of 10 on GameSpot). Amusingly enough, one reviewer calls the game original, while the other calls it derivative. The key seems to be that one reviewer was able to overlook the control problems, while they proved too much for the other to stomach. I guess it really does pay to get a second opinion before deciding who gets those precious gaming dollars. I side with Kasavin. A platform shooter with control problems is bound to max out my frustrate-o-meter.

My second CD will not load. At the *Insert CD #2\"prompt, you just hear a loud\"chink\" (CD skip noise) which repeats five seconds later. Interplay support initially claimed that it was a problem with my new Diamond Monster 3D drivers. However, I called Diamond and they say my drivers are fine. Thinking it could be a defective CD, I exchanged the game at Electronics Boutique, but got the same result. Interplay insists that I send all five of my CDs back, and combined with the long-distance tech support calls to Interplay and Diamond, I have spent over $25 just trying to find the problem. Based on the response Interplay has given me so GameSpot has a separate editorial staff from CGW, with an entirely different stable of writers. The two groups have a slightly different reviewing philosophy, in that GameSpot shocks its reviewers with an electric cattle prod cach time they die in a game, while CCW rewards reviewers with blood money directly from the advertiser for every favorable review. And if you believe that, you're sure to find a newsgroup with plenty of supporters sometime soon. Seriously, we don't ask GameSpot's reviewers to conform to our opinion and they don't require ours to conform to theirs. We do swap girlfriends occasionally, but the payoff is there since you get a sccond opinion and we get the spice of life. CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

"READ.ME The Latest News From the Computer Gaming World Edited by Charlotte Panther (CPanther@zd.com) hile on a trip to visit Ritual for our SIN preview, CGW made several visits to other prominent 3D-action developers in the Dallas area, including id Software, ION Storm, and 3D Realms. CGW Does Dallas Ritual Entertainment The team that brought you SCOURGE OF ARMAGON is busy working on Sin, its first-person QUAKE Killer, which should reach completion by March, 1998. At this point, the company is deep into level design, and is still in the process of integrating the non-human monsters into the game. For more on Sin, and Ritual's progress on the title, turn to our Sneak Previews well for a full preview. 3D Games To Drive You Wild JON Storm Our visit to ION Storm was surprising in that we were actually able to see quite a bit of DAIKATANA, as well as ANACHRONOX.

"News of detail in the monster skins and textures, even more so than in QUAKE II. The levels are deep in development; we were able to see the Alcatraz level from the last episode, Future San Francisco, and it looks incredibly accurate. The Greek levels are also impressive, with their colossal architecture. We also had a chance to sample the music of DAIKATANA, which is being crafted by Will Loconto, a former member of Information Society. Every level will have a unique theme, as will each endboss. The music of each episode will also be different. The music ranges from heavy-metal guitar to MORTAL KOMBAT-like techno to Dark Ages period music. After listening to the game music, we think it might be one of the best features of DAIKATANA, which looks on track to make its March 1998 ship date. ANACHRONOX has an even later scheduled ship date (late 1998), but we were able to see the main character, Sly Boots, running through two very alien rooms from the game's third-person perspective.  kesmai Corporation recently announced that it filed suit against America Online (AOL) for flagrant violation of federal anti-trust laws, federal and state trademark laws, and unfair compe tition laws. The suit charges AOL with using its monopolistic control of online services and Internet access to prevent small content providers from being able to compete fairly. AOL recently acquired Kesmai competitor ImagiNation Network, and relaunched it under the name WorldPlay, which gives AOL control over basic management, programming, and promotion functions on the AOL games channel. The move, according to Kesmai CEO Chris Holden, forced game companies to either become subsumed under their competitor's brand ( WorldPlay) or leave AOL alto gether. Holden claims that AOL made Kesmai virtually invisible to subscribers, and as a result, Kesmai's business has been reduced by 92 percent. Kesmai also claims that AOL's decision to institute a $1.99 per hour surcharge has driven usage down and scared game companies away. AOL, which already has more than twice the subscribers of all of its competitors combined, stands to gain another 2.7 million subscribers from the acquisition of CompuServe, which would allow it to control 79 percent of the market. kesmai's lawsuit, Holden says, is an effort to fight, on behalf of all small AOL con tent providers, for a return to fair competition.

"READ.ME id Software Id gave us the opportunity to sit down in front of QUAKE II and take it for a test drive through the few first levels. We were very impressed. The graphics are as good as you'd expect from the technical wizards at id, and the integration of puzzles and intercon. nected levels is coming together well. Kevin Cloud, project leader on QUAKE II, revealed that the final game will have the quad dam age and invulnerability power-ups, as well as infrared goggles, invisibility, enviro-suit, and some other power-ups. Most of the humanoid monsters are plugged into the game, though finishing touches are being put on the non humanoids, including the demon, which will have fiend-like speed and ferocity. The two player characters, the male and female marine, were being fin: ished by Paul Steed at the time of our visit. Currently, the male character is bald, while the female character, in addition to being fully armored, has a pony tail atop her head. We were also able to see John Cash's Al at work. The monsters actively duck under rocket fire and duck in and out of cover. The first action is hard-coded into monster Al, while the second action is actually scripted on an individual basis. The end result, though, is that you'll see monsters acting more intelligently. Moreover, certain monsters, such as the berserker, will chase you down, while some grunts will run into other rooms to call for reinforcements. While running through the various early levels, we also saw many interactive elements in place, such as break able glass, floors, and ceilings. We also saw the new sky in the background, which id will use as a marker to record your progress. For example, you'll see the planetary gun on QUAKE II the horizon on one level, and on the next level, which is closer geographically to the gun, you will see the weapon looming larger in the sky. On the very next level, you might actually be in the gun complex. Id is still very confident of making its Christmas ship date, though certain fea. tures, such as 3D sound support, will have to be pulled. Also, you will no longer be able to see each type of weapon in DeathMatch. However, there will be three generic gun sizes available when you change weapons in DeathMatch, so you will at least be able to tell whether your opponent has a big, medium, or small weapon. There will also be a different look and animation for the grenade. Cloud also assures us that John Carmack plans to increase the number of respawn sites in DeathMatch, especially since DeathMatches will now have up to 200 player limits. WARM THIS JUST IN MACHINE HUNTER MGM's thirdperson shooter, MACHINE HUNTER, has you fighting a series of increasingly difficult robots while navi. gating through futuristic levels. Before each robot dies, you have the ability to possess its body and take over its skills and weapons. The game's top down perspective proves to be a bit confusing-it was sometimes difficult to tell where catwalks ended and the floor below began. The robots can also see you before you can see them, allowing them to take multiple shots at you before they are visible.

"READ.ME News DUKE FOREVER 3D Realms We were really impressed by the progress on PREY, 3D Realms' contender for the next generation leader in firstperson shooters. Prey relies on what is called portal tech: nology. In a somewhat oversimplified nutshell, it means that whenever there is a doorway or \"portal\" along a wall, the program automatically \"clips\" the graphics related to the other room and only calculates and draws the visible seg. ments. Most games calculate all segments in the other room and then mask the non-visible parts, using up a few processing cycles to do so. By handling the portal issue dif ferently, the Prey team is able to create rooms with mirror. style puzzles and enhance the idea of inter-dimensional travel. Some of the test-level designs are extremely impressive, as is the robust and easy-to-use editor. Paul Schuytema, lead designer on PREY, also promises that Talon Brave, the Native American protag. onist of PREY, will be as true to Native American cus: tom and spirit as Schuytema can possibly make him. Many of the situations and puzzles within the game itself will come from the character's heritage, and Schuytema is using a Native American consultant to ensure that no repetition of SHADOW WARRIOR's inept handling of cultural traditions will occur. 3D Realms' other big 1998 release is DUKE NUKEM FOREVER, slated for a summer launch. Though the buzz on the title centered around 3D Realms' decision to use the Quake II engine for the game, George Broussard, project leader, says that DUKE FOREVER will be every bit as interactive as Duke Nukem was. 3D Realms will also strive to inject the same personality into DUKE FOREVER that made DUKE NUKEM such a suc cess. We'll definitely give you a sneak preview when we find out more about the next DUKE adventure. -Elliott Chin and Johnny Wilson >> Activision has announced a stand-alone expansion pack for INTERSTATE '76.

"READ.ME Myst Opportunities News RIVEN: THE SEQUEL TO Myst Will Continue to Mystify Gamers yst is the \"Frampton Comes Alive\" of computer gaming. Like that gangly guitarist from the '70s, Myst was in Ithe right place at the right time--in Myst's case, it was in the perfect position to take advantage of those new-fangled CDROM drives, selling a bazillion (or, more accurately, 3 million) copies, and becoming the one computer game that everybody and their grandmother had ever heard of. Nearly four years after its initial release, Myst-amazinglystill routinely tops the PC Data list of best-selling games. Now, after years of anticipation and months of media buzz, Red Orb's long awaited RiveN: THE SEQUEL TO Myst will be hitting the shelves as you read this. And whether you loved or hated the orig. inal, there's no denying that this is one of the year's biggest releases, guaranteed to sell well to the faithful and the curious, regard. less of what the critics say. At the time we wrote this month's Holiday Hot 100, we had seen nothing more than a few screen shots of Riven, but, just in time for this news section, we received a shrink-wrapped final copy. Here is a quick first look-a full review will appear in next month's CGW In a nutshell, Riven's plot is this: After helping Atrus sort out the problems with his sons, you are now enlisted to help him find his wife, Catherine, who has been trapped on another of Atrus' fantasy worlds, Riven. >> Electronic Arts recently announced the appointment of John S. Riccitiello as the company's new president and COO. He will be responsi ble for EA's worldwide distribution, marketing, and operations. Riccitiello comes from Sarah Lee Corporation, where he served as president and CEO of its bakery division. Our first thought was that EA was trying to duplicate the success Apple saw after hiring a CEO from Pepsi! But there does appear to be method behind this madness: Sources tell us that Mr. Riccitiello is actually a hard-core gamer, so he can't be all bad. Those expecting something radically different than Myst will be sorely disappointed, for designers Rand and Robyn Miller have made a game that is unabashedly similar to the original. Once again, you must navigate your way through a strange, mostly uninhabited world, pulling levers, fixing water pumps, repairing strange machines-all the puzzle types that MYST made so popular. RIVEN's graphics are extraordinary, with a beautiful photorealistic look that is far more detailed than in Myst. The designers made some good attempts to liven up the environment, with shimmering water, insects and animals, and even the occasional humanoid wandering through the landscape. Some of the game's cut-scenes, such as the underground/ nderwater roller-coaster, are truly stunning to behold. Riven shows that, once again, the Miller brothers do what they do better than anyone. As such, Riven looks like the ultimate Myst clone-which should thrill the legions of Myst fans, and confound everyone else.-Jeff Green u >> Avalon Hill recently teamed up with ZDNet to bring an exclusive preview of Avalon Hill's 3D combat simulation game, DEFIANCE, to the Web. The demo resulted in over 16,000 downloads within the first 20 hours of being online, and that figure was up to 54,426 at press-time DEFIANCE marks Avalon Hill's first foray into the first person 3D action genre. The game has you driving around in an LAV 6, a hovering battle vehicle, and defending your home base against an army of space mutants. The demo is still available for download at www.zdlaunchpad.com and is also featured in this month's CG-ROM. WARM THIS JUST IN RESIDENT EVIL With all the subtlety and quality of a made for TV movie, RESIDENT EVIL tries to deliver a highly atmospheric action/adventure hybrid game The question is what kind of atmosphere it shoots for: riveting terror or straight-up cheesiness? The only way to answer that question may be to search through the game's mansion yourself, blowing away the flesh-eating zombies and finding out whether your skin crawls or you laugh in disbelief. These action elements are interspersed with cut-scenes whose tone leans less toward impending doom and more toward self-parody.

JOU00 his edition of the Works fea tures a chip under construction from Integrated Device Technologies (IDT), a IRON WORKS lesser-known compa ny in PC gaming hardware, and finds a very well-known 3D company doing some damage control. In a move to quell some irate Voodoo Rush customers, 3Dfx is offering a swap for Hercules Stingray 128/3D owners. Customers can send 3Dfx their Voodoo Rush daughterboard (keeping their Alliant AT3D-based 2D board), and 3Dfx will send them a stand-alone PCI Voodoo-based board as a replacement. The offer does not extend to single board Voodoo Rush own ers, only those with the main board/daugh terboard configuration. The move stems from consumers upset by Voodoo Rush's initially slower performance running GL QUAKE. However, subsequent driver revisions have narrowed the performance gap between the two parts. Improvements are also being made to Voodoo Rush's Direct3D drivers to bring their performance closer to parity with Voodoo. IDT is busy at work on a part that could have quite an impact on the 3D graphics landscape, although it isn't a 3D accelerator. Already a player in the X86 CPU market with its Centaur chip, IDT has a new spin of that CPU in the works which beefs up floating point and MMX performance. Both AMD and Cyrix have brought their Socket 7 com petitors to market, and while both deliver impressive integer performance, neither can match Intel in floating point performance, which is the key to keeping 3D data flowing smoothly to a 3D accelerator. IDT's new Centaur is aimed squarely at being a gamer's CPU, and as soon we get a chip in-house, we'll give you the lowdown on how it fares. Next month, we'll have another 3D graphics roundup to test the newest boards coming out for the holidays. We'll look at Riva 128-based parts from ASUS and Canopus, Voodoo Rush parts from Jazz and Intergraph, Rendition V2200 parts from Hercules and Sierra, Permedia 2-based parts from Creative Labs and ELSA, ATI'S Expert@Play using their new Rage Pro chip, and Matrox's PowerVR-based m3D, plus a few surprises that I can't quite tell you about yet.

But to their credit, TEN and the develop er, Bolt-Action Software, are attempting to enclose their halfdozen 3D-generated worlds within a strategic shell of base management, scouting missions, and even orbital bombardment. Whether TEN'S new lineup will revolutionize multiplayer online gaming remains to be seen, but at least the company seems to know why and what it's doing, rather than just slavishly mimicking the latest hits. Terry Coleman o say that the Total Entertainment Network (TEN) is abandoning online versions of retail software is a bit of a stretch. But TEN has significantly changed its focus, as I discovered on a recent visit to its San Francisco sanctum. Almost everything Twilight Lands I saw had been designed for multiplayer from the ground up. Some of the games were nostalgic, like ZERO: STORM WORLDS, which is nothing if not ASTEROIDS for the '90s. Wiz War, the old boardgame favorite, now sports a Win 95 interface and is playable by 2-6 would-be mages. Even AD&D DARK SUN ONLINE is being revamped to make it more dynamic: With an ongoing storyline maintained on a daily WizWar basis by gamemasters, the online component may finally come close to matching the paper D&D experience. In trying to overtake its competitors, TEN is attempting to combine this nostalgic feel with the latest gaming trends. TWILIGHT LANDS looks to leave MERIDIAN 59 in the cyberdust with a MUD back-end, but it's more likely that the rich character development system (from ICE's MAJIC REALM online game) will keep RPG-starved gamers coming back for more.

"READ.ME In the Company of Lions the soft porn business—so, desperate for a name, We reverted to LionHead. the rule of conformity. Peter Molyneux, game Molyneux Talks About What lessons learned at Bullfrog will most influence the way you will run the new company? Bullfrog taught me thousands of lessons, but the major one is: keep it small, keep it simple. Lion Head will never grow beyond 20 people and all of those people will be friends. You have to enjoy work, as it takes up such a large proportion of your life, and I believe the people you work with can play a very large part in enjoyment of work. Bullfrog became too large for me when it grew beyond 30 people. t a time when originality in game design is being strangled by profitability, one man stands at the top of the list of exceptions to the rule of conformity. Peter Molyneux, game designer and co-founder of Bullfrog Software, wouldn't be caught dead designing a clone of any. thing. From POPULOUS TO SYNDICATE, MAGIC CARPET to DUNGEON KEEPER, every one of his games has crackled with the sparks of original genius. Hinting at frustrations with an increasingly corporate environment at Bullfrog, which Molyneux and his Bullfrog partners sold to Electronic Arts in 1995 for over $40 million, Molyneux left the company this summer to found LionHead Studios in Surrey, England. CGW caught Molyneux in the midst of start-up frenzy to ask a few questions about his new venture. by Chris Lombardi Can you tell us anything about your works in progress? I can't tell you anything about the game design that I am working on at the moment, but what I can tell you is that it is the most important game of my career. We are being very ambitious about both the game concept and the technology it will use. It will definitely be on the PC-true color, ultra hi-res-and it will have single player and be massively multiplayer. The amount of Al and gameplay that the design demands is currently scaring the shit out of me. Will 3D environments continue to be a primary focus of your designs? What are gaming's biggest problems at the moment? I think there are three main problems. First, the industry must get away from producing clone after clone. I understand the temptation to try to reproduce a \"winning formula,\" but if the indus. What role will you play in the new comtry is to move forward it must avoid publishing pany? Will you be leading the design teams for all projects? the same games over and over again. Second, the industry has to come up with more mass In a small company you always end up doing market concepts that appeal to a broad sector of everything, so my responsibilities at Lion Head the population. Third, and rather worryingly, the include designing games, programming, and number of reputable publishers seems to be making coffee for everyone. shrinking to an all-time low. There are now only a handful left of any worth. Any special significance to the name \"Lion Head\"? For the lalest on LionHead, visit its Web site at LionHead was the name of Mark Webley's (a www.lionhead.co.uk LionHead co-founder) hamster, and we liked the name and the hamster so much that it was a our first idea, but then, sadly, LionHead died. We felt that perhaps this wasn't a very good omen and investigated a number of different ideas. One was \"Starfish,\" but after watching the film Trainspotting, where a chocolate starfish is referred to on many occasions, we felt that perhaps this wasn't a good name either. Our next choice was \"Red Eye,\" but we found that there were already other companies with that name-mainly in The Development Team at LionHead Studios. 3D environments are great to design. It is easy to visualize on-screen what you imagined the game being like in your head. However, I am sure that there is more that can be done with 3D, and so we are looking at some unique enhancements to 3D environments. Will multiplayer play be a major facet of LionHead's projects? All LionHead's games will be multiplayer in some way or another-in fact, every game I have ever worked (on) from POPULOUS Onward has always had a multiplayer component. I have been saying that multiplayer games are the future since 1989! CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

While you can control up to six members, the game will usually assign you less. You'll use mouse-clicks to decide where to go, whom to kill, and what weapon to use. In addition to the usual melee and distance attacks, each team member comes with a special move that only he or she can perform. Examples include Diehard's ability to heal other characters, Badrock's earthquake ability, and Troll's rolling ability. Characters will improve in terms of skills gained and batle efficiency, giving YOUNGBLOOD its RPG-esque feel.

His Mansion level, which is Sinclair's home, is well-designed with traps and all the accoutrements you'd expect in a tycoon's multistory house. TAKING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL It's clear that Ritual wants to make Sin an immersive experience, rather than a simple action shooter. Not only will the levels be more realistic, but the overall feel will be as well. In OFFSHORE DRILLING This is a shot of the Oil Rig level.

"SIN PREVIEWS The SecondGeneration Engine itual plans several enhancements to the QUAKE II engine to create a visually stunning and editing-friendly game. Sin will have all the QUAKE II engine improvements, such as rotating brushes for swinging doors and spinning wheels, as well as faster speed, due to the move to DLL files. Sin, like Quake II. will also have a \"360-degree environment-mapped sky. That means that the sky will be much more realistic than in previous QUAKE games. But unlike QUAKE II, SIN will feature 16-bit color, which creates a richer palette and more detailed textures for the game's environments. Sin will also have colored lighting and blended color lighting, both of which will contribute to better special effects-like translucency and explosions and a more immersive atmosphere. Ritual also plans to include masked textures for chain link fences and grates. The masked textures look and behave realistically. This means you can fire through the holes in the grating, provided that your bullets are small enough. Jim Dose, one of the programmers for SIN, introduced me to the game's scripting language, which will be text-based. The scripting is separate from the map code, so you can fiddle with specific portions of levels or objects to create unique events without compiling the whole level. Ritual uses the scripting language to build greater interactivity into the level. This will allow consumers to alter the game or the levels by building in their own interactive elements. Animation and Al will also be improved for Sin. In the case of animation, Ritual is moving to a skeletal-based model: All creatures are composed of bones, over which is draped a continuous mesh. In Quake, by contrast, characters are basically composed of \"blocks.\" By using the skeletal model, designers can make characters move in a more fluid and realistic way. It also means that in deathmatch you can see what weapon another person is wielding. With the skeletal model, you can attach scripted events to a bone under the character's skin, so that if you shoot an enemy in the neck, you can have blood squirt from that location. Finally, Sin's Al will be more competent than QUAKE's. Certain enemies will be able to duck and find cover, use flashlights to look for you in the dark, and pick up weapons and health. The way the Al communicates is also great: Enemies will actually sound alarms and radio each other for backup. As I ran through a level with guards, could hear them chatter with each other, calling for reinforcements. However, if you are quick enough, you can shoot guards before they radio for help, thus ensuring that you escape detection (we won't tell you how) and then jump the gap in the corridor Interactivity is just one part of Ritual's formula to create a realistic environment. With the use of \"action based-outcomes,\" Ritual is ensuring that what a gamer does in one level will have consequences in another. Selinske offers this example: \"If you are playing one mission and decide to blow up the power genera. tors at the power plant, when you go to the aqueduct system the power may be off and the security systems disabled. This is a good thing. But if you run through another mission blowing up everything, you may not be able to deac BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL This top-down look at livate the chemical plant's security sys. some scrambling guards illustrates the game's tems, and you will have to fight the forti colored lighting. fied security forces now on alert.\" Ritual also wants to mix up the gameplay for different levels. In one level, the game might be fast-paced, as you try to chase enemies through a level while your sidekick, JC, keeps yelling, \"Hurry! Hurry!\" In another level, you might need to exercise caution and stealth as you try to infiltrate a base teeming with guards. In these cases, JC will set the tone by BE VEWY QUIET This is the control room in the briefing you on your objectives. Mansion level. From what I've seen, Ritual has a great-looking game on its hands. With the increased interactivity, linked missions, and action. based outcomes, the designers are striving to create an environment you can influence and a gaming experience that feels fluid and dynamic. So far, this hasn't been done that successfully on the PC, but with a March release date, the Ritual team has plenty of time to get it right. I, for one, think they'll deliver on the promise. THE CAST Colonel John R. Blade: Blade is the hero of the game, a hired gun who has been tasked with keeping the peace in this crime-ridden city. Ritual wanted to create an atypical hero for SIN. As a side effect of creating realistic environments, Ritual had to make Blade taller than the QUAKE marine. He's also probably the gaming world's first half-black hero with dreadlocks and a normal name. DECEMBER 1997 CGW "

"PREVIEWS HALF-LIFE Target Release Date: November 1997 Developer: Valve Software Publisher: Sierra On-Line Halfway to Perfection Sierra's Next Action Title Could Be the Sleeper QUAKE Killer of the Year by Thierry Nguyen sl write this, most of the QUAKE community is currently busy playing the just-released HEXEN II. Hexen I was the first of the \"QUAKE Killers\" featured in our June cover story, and now everyone is looking forward to the other QUAKE Killers slated to arrive this Chrismas, including QUAKE II. One that caught our attention after we finished the June roundup was Valve's HALF-LIFE. The surprising thing about this new QUAKE Killer isn't the fact that Sierra is publishing it, nor is it the game's diverse development team (which includes passionate hobbyists and industry veterans alike). Rather, what makes HALFLIFE so surprising is its inclusion of excellent new features, features that could make HalfLife the best Quake Killer this Christmas. PACK ATTACK The HALF-LIFE Al is impressive. This pack of houndeyes (alien dogs) demonstrates the pack-mentality Al: They attack only in numbers. ALIEN BODY SNATCHERS HALF-LIFE starts out in a subterranean, decom. missioned missile base that is now being used as a research station. The main project at the base, the Portal Device, is activated, conjuring a score of aliens looking to foment a hostile takeover. What ensues is absolute havoc: Aliens run amok, scientists flee in panic, security guards shoot first and ask questions later, and CIA-like \"Cleaner\" squads attempt to neutralize the situation. Amid the chaos, you (a weapons research scien. tist) must try to stop the alien menace. One of the first things you'll notice in Half-Life is the multitude of enhancements Valve has made to the Quake engine. You'll see such eyecandy effects as 16-bit color, colored lighting, and transparency in both glass and water. And that's without a 3D accelerator. Load up HALF-LIFE GL, and these effects look wonderful. There are also some fine sound enhancements: We now gel proper echoes, muffled underwater effects, and 3D sounds, all without special hardware. Also, taking a cue from such Quake \"films\" as Operation: Bayshield and the forthcoming Ranger Gone Bad 3, HALF-LIFE will tell its story via cut-scenes IT'S GOT ME!

"PREVIEWS spliced in at appropriate times. Like the amateur Quake videos mentioned above, these cut scenes are composed with the game's 3D engine, rather than prerendered FMV. For example, you might stumble upon a guard and scientist arguing, only to see the guard fling the scientist toward a nearby monster. QUAKE LAB RAT Most of the action takes place in the base as you try to make your way to the surface, but you'll eventually have to go through the Portal Device and confront the aliens on their own turi. In a feature similar to HEXEN'S hubs, you move back and forth between the levels, which are all interconnected within Play HALF-LIFE on this month's CG-ROM! the base. The result is a huge real-world environment, rather than a string of levels. When you run from the alien research wing to the officer warrens to the reactor core, you actually move through three lev. els, even though you don't see any levelloading screens. There's much running back and forth, since you're shutting down power, circumventing security, or crawling around vents here and there. Since most of the game takes place in a base, the architecture is logically rendered. There are specific labs, offices, stations, and break-rooms laid out as you'd expect in a real research installation. Although HALF-LIFE isn't as architecturally exciting as some of the other QUAKE Killers, the look and feel is much more realistic Also, the environment is dynamic, so you can leave bullet holes and blood splotches on walls, or shatter glass as you go. Finally, as in Ritual's SCOURGE OF ARMAGON QUAKE pack, HALF-LIFE's levels sometimes change shape as you roam around in them. One particularly eerie segment, which seems straight out of Aliens or Jurassic Park, occurred when I walked down an abandoned hallway. Suddenly, the ceiling caved in, and a LOCK AND LOAD Using skeletal animation, Valve is able to create incredibly realistic and fluid motion and animation for its creatures. DECEMBER 1997 CGW "

They play at the end of each mission, and reveal a little more about your plot to solve the murder of your sis: ter, a fellow G Police officer. Although you can destroy vehicles, both civilian and hostile, you do no damage to walls or buildings. I would have liked to see the occasional poorly aimed missile blow the side out of an office building, à la Blue Thunder, but it's probably just as well, since everyone lives under big geodesic domes. What's that old saying, \"People who live in glass domes shouldn't throw rockets\"? Something like that. BOSLUISFONO PLAYING HAVOC This is the setup for Psygnosis' G POLICE, a work in progress that takes helicopter action into the future. This first-person shooter looks initially to be a helicopter sim, but it isn't. Your Havoc doesn't fly like a helicopter: It's substan. tially less maneuverable. You can't even fly side ways. I mean, c'mon! The action takes place on the Jovian moon Callisto, in glass domed, dense urban environ ments, complete with skyscrapers and Blade Runner-type flying cars. Each dome has its pur pose within the game universe, and each sports its own look, be it industrial or residential. At present, G POLICE runs fast and pretty on a P.133 sys. SCANNING...

I suspect it doesn't, but we will have to wait until the final game ships to find out. A PREVIEW WITH PROMISE The preview version that I looked at had no analog joystick support (a temporary condition, while Psygnosis works out the bugs in its force feedback routines), and I was forced to play the game with the key. board-not fun. G POLICE also allows you to drive with the mouse...in the ory. In practice, I found mouse conCITIES UNDER GLASS ***Continued from pg 96 G POLICE reminds me of the old QUARANTINE. The domes bustle with activity. There are multiple levels of traffic, both ground and air. The drivers appear to obey the traffic laws and pay attention to the functional stoplights. Although Psygnosis says that G POLICE's Al will be very good, with different behaviors for different wingmen and characters, the Al in the current beta is still far from perfect. I was unable to complete one mission because my ground support team got stuck in a traffic jam and couldn't make it to the rendezvous point. On second thought, maybe one should consider that another level of realism. G POLICE missions aren't just combat oriented. You'll tail suspects around town (don't get too close), scan incoming freight for contra band, protect motorcades, and immo bilize fleeing suspects. But all the missions-at least all the ones 1 played-include a good allotment of bad guys to blow out of the sky with an assortment of weapons. The final game will have 35 missions, which will take you through several of Callisto's domed cities. All the missions I saw had multiple objectives, both major and minor. These objectives often require you to be in two places at once: defending your ground teams from aerial assault while simultaneously keeping tabs on a suspected smuggler who's blocks, or domes, away. Luckily, it's possible to win a level without completing all the minor objectives. There's an ongoing story line but I couldn't tell, from the levels I played, that one's performance during a mission had any impact on how the story unfolds trol untenable, with a huge and nonadjustable null zone and poor feedback. Still, I like what I've seen very much. It doesn't have the realism and complexity of Mi-24 Hind-you can't choose your own load-out, for example, and there's no communication with your wingmen-but in Hind you don't get to fly between skyscrapers...at night...while dodging flying cars, now do you?

"GREAT BATTLES OF HANNIBAL PREVIEWS Target Release Date: November 1997 Developer: Erudite Software Publisher: Interactive Magic Crossing the Alps HANNIBAL Takes Up the Fight Where ALEXANDER Left Off by Jim Cobb an II too often, the second game of a successful series lacks the initial thrill or the originali ty of the first, leaving naught but a pale shadow in its wake. Following quickly on the heels of GREAT BATTLES OF ALEXANDER comes GREAT BATTLES OF HANNIBAL, another game about tactical combat in ancient times-which would appear to be an obvious candidate for this \"son of ...\" syndrome. After all, no technological advances occurred in the century between Hannibal and Alexander; fight ing was a matter of close combat with edged weapons. To the credit of both Erudite Software and Interactive Magic, however, they made a tough design choice. HANNIBAL plays quite differ. ently than ALEXANDER via a simple change of focus: HANNIBAL is a study of one man's genius versus Roman military doctrine. troops sooner and more often than officers still unclear on the concepts. Good generals can rally the troops and keep them in order by removing cohe. sion hits. Troop qualities are based on size, training, and weapons. Victories are won not by annihilation or by gaining position, but by demoralizing the oppo nent. Small, elite armies therefore can manhandle hordes, if directed well. This system reflects Hellenistic combat well in Alex and continues to do so in HANNIBAL. HANNIBAL'S graphics look better than ALEXANDER'S, with more textured terrain and increased detail. Since the battles represented took place in North Africa, Spain, Northern Europe, Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor, terrain features are also more varied than in Alex. The effect this has on gameplay is more psychologi cal than mechanical players will think more tactically if units actually look like they are in IT'S STILL ABOUT LEADERS HANNIBAL does maintain the central theme of the series. Leaders' abilities are all-important. Superior ratings allow generals to move more woods, not simply standing on a leafy tile. HANNIBAL's detail in depicting units would do the Osprey series on miniatures proud. Historically, Hannibal's army was a polyglot formation, with contingents from Africa, Europe, and Greece. Thus, each nationality and tribe in the game is portrayed uniquely and clearly. The Balearic slingers are shown in their short tunics, twirling their weapons, while the Celts make a fashion statement with their checked pants and multicolored shirts. The Romans are also clearly detailed with the different uniforms of the Hastati, Princeps, and Tritarii distinctly delineated. The most significant new units are the different kinds of Roman legionaries (see the Maniple-lation sidebar). African and Indian war elephants also make their appearance, the former with head armor and \"towers\" on their backs. ho am I? SCIPIO SHUFFLE HANNIBAL realistically depicts the flexibility of the Roman legions. Here is a Roman formation at the battle of Zama. Note how, after the Roman player uses a manipular line extension, the holes in the Roman line have neatly closed. HANNIBAL'S BATTLES PLUS Although Hannibal fought during the Second Punic War, the 11 battles in the game include one from the First Punic War (Bagradas Plain), four engagements where Scipio ate away at DECEMBER 1997 CGW "

Naturally, all of Hannibal's major battles are here, including his master piece at Cannae and his final defeat at Zama. Reinforcements are available that begin the bat. tle off-screen, which is a nice addition. Cavalry pursuits also enliven combat, although they produce command control problems. The campaign game, in which the Carthaginians must subjugate Italy in 10 turns, differs only in that the Romans in HANNIBAL are much more apt to take the strategic offensive than the Persians were in GREAT BATTLES OF ALEXANDER. Even with all this variety, the enhancement that most sets HANNIBAL apart from Alex is one small command: manipular line extension (MLE). You see, a typical Roman army can examine every detail of every unit at any formed its infantry into offset columns of time. Obviously, no real-life commander ever had maniples (the Roman equivalent of the this capability. Also, with the exception of Scipio modern company).

They could clear away their opponents, as well as disorganize the main enemy formations. HASTATI These formed the first battle line of regulars. Armed with javelins and short stabbing swords, they could continue to disorganize the enemy while going in to finish the job. Their articulated armor and curved, body-hugging shields were lighter than the Greek Hoplite's equipment, but equally as effective. PRINCEPS Equipped like the Hastati, these experienced men would either shore up the first line, or deliver the decisive stroke. TRITARII Savvy veterans who had lost a step, the Tritarii formed the rear ranks. Their main purpose was to form a wall of long, thrusting spears behind which the younger troops could rally if things went wrong. CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

Other cards allow you to repair damage to bases or HQ, steal your opponent's cards, or provide immobile defenses. a combination thereof. So, it's advisable to balance the bases to ensure that you're likely to have some of each resource at your com mand throughout the game. At the start of each game, you determine what the battleground will be. Beginners will generally take the United States since, with fewer cities, it doesn't take as long to find your opponent's HQ and get into combat. As players get more and more sophisticated, they will tend to expand their horizons to Europe, Asia, and the World in order to extend game length. As a game begins, you'll place bases and operatives in a pattern designed to ferret out the HQ of your opponent. Once you locate an opponent's HQ, the game usually becomes a battle royal at that city. One defensive strategy is to pile all your operatives in the HQ city. However, that means that your opponent will have no trouble moving from city to city, destroying your bases and cutting down on the number of resource points available to you in the cumulative resource pool. Individual cards are rated by the number of resources needed to deploy, attack, move, or utilize special abilities (self-healing, heal. ing others, increasing resources, reviving units from the Body Bank, and more).

My strategy backfired when I would have a special weapon or enhancement for one type unit, but couldn't draw such a unit to deploy in order to save my life (or, in this case, my HQ). I quickly discovered that special decks were necessary. In general, you'll find yourself building bases and deploying units of various types. You'll need counterterrorist units to block terrorists and you'll need special intervention cards to THE PLOT DEEPENS in playing the beta version of CHRON X, I've found that there is a sufficient mass of players to find an opponent at most times of the day. Unfortunately for me, some of those opponents are the very top-ranked players, and I've lost far too many ranked games to them. However, CHRON X tends to be a fast playing game (about 20 minutes per game for Europe and 30 minutes per game for Asia) with plenty of differing strategies and surprises. I find myself trying to play at least one or two games every night whenever I'm home and have access to my \"all you can eal\" ISP account. Of course, since it's free, you don't have to take my word for it: You can find out for yourself. You might even get a chance to beat up on me.

"STER Buyer's Our 1997 Holiday Hot 100 Is Better Than Ever t's never been easy being Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Hanukkah Harry, or any other legendary gift giver. And it's never been easy trying to be the Sanity Clause of an entertainment industry like the computer game business, either. We started out in 1987 with a Christmas Buying Guide. The photographer used a blue filter to try to get a \"cool\" effect, and we ended up with a near-blue Christmas tree on the cover. We tried to get working code on everything we covered, but even then, the publishing schedules for magazines and software diverged considerably. Everyone wanted their products included, and, at that time, there was room to include pretty much everybody. Then, we wised up. We discovered that we actually had readers who didn't celebrate Christmas, so in order to include more products, we modified the title to the Holiday Buying Guide. Later, we tried to be comprehensive and list everything coming out for the 4th Quarter. Eventually, we realized that the big list wasn't really serving our readers, because it only described the games; it didn't make enough of a critical judgment. We started trying to include, as the prologue to The Princess Bride claims, \"only the good parts.\" Three years ago, we decided that the \"good parts version\" would be better as a list of the Top 100 games that we believed would be available during the 4th Quarter. There was one major problem, however. Lots of the top games didn't ship during that time period. Every year since then, we've tried to be more stringent, and every year, more games in the Top 100 don't ship. So, this year, we've asked for working code on every product listed in the Top 100. We have played some portion of every game in this listing. If we couldn't play it, it ended up in each genre's appendix and wasn't eligible for inclusion in the actual Top 100. It's not a perfect system, we'll still have some games that won't ship in time for the holidays. After all, we had code for RED BARON II and STAR FLEET ACADEMY prior to last year's guide. However, we're trying to minimize the chance for error in order for the list to be more useful for you. After all, what good does it do to hand a highlighted copy of the guide to your parental unit, spousal affiliate, significant other, bosom buddy, or guilt-ridden colleague if they can't buy you the games that are listed?

This time, numerous technical and game design improvements have been made. Expect to see the same great animation that CIRCLE OF Blood featured, spruced up with shadows and translucency effects. And for design, get ready to see the same strong plot, but with half the dialogue-and the chance to play as both George Stobbart and Nicole Collare.

This unique adventure game, developed by Kalisto, tells the epic struggle of mankind 300 years in the future, following a cataclysmic meteor shower that has left the planet in perpetual darkness. In this world, you play the role of Arkhan, a \"Guardian of Light,\" who becomes involved in a deadly political and religious struggle.

This time, BLACK DAHLIA has a richer and darker plot--one that involves Nazis, occult rituals, and the Cleveland Torso Killer-all mixed together with good gameplay and decent FMV. With graphics that immerse you in the late '40s setting, quality acting (by game standards) from the likes of Dennis Hopper, and puzzles that are integral to the plot, BLACK DAHLIA looks as if it will outdo its predecessor, Ripper, and be one of the better adventure games to be released this year. In anticipation of Take2's upcoming Black DAHLIA, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of James Ellroy's classic crime thriller of the same name, Ellroy's Black Dahlia, the first part of his stunning L.A.

"BUYER'S GUIDE The 1997 Holiday Hot 100 Other Holiday Adventures hankfully, after a long drought of decent games, there are plenty of adventure and role-playing titles on the horizon-and many of them actually look good. The following games nearly made our Top 10 list, but the lack of playable code at the time of this writing held them back. They are all worthy contenders, though. New World Computing's Might and Magic VI would probably have landed at the very top of this list, had we seen any code, but, alas, it was not to be. This latest entry in one of gaming's classic RPG series. now updated with a brand-new 3D engine and a storyline tied into that of the HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC games, is the one we're most looking forward to playing this Christmas-if it ships. We shall light a candle and pray. MIGHT AND MAGIC VI BATTLESPIRE Read. Me section. Keep your eyes peeled for Red Orb's The Journeyman Project 3, the latest game in this seminal graphic adventure series. The great, hilarious Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) is returning to computer gaming in a big way with the imminent release of Starship Titanic, a graphic-based comic adventure about the maiden voyage of an intergalactic spaceship that happens to crash into your house. Bethesda's Battlespire is a follow-up to DAGGERFALL, set in the ELDER SCROLLS universe, but it is not a sequel to that game. Think of it instead as an 22 action-oriented side quest, with lots of first-person 3D combat and multiplaver deathmatch options. Sierra On-Line is embarking on two quests this season: Quest for Glory 5: Dragon Fire, and King's Quest 8: Mask of Eternity. The former is the latest-and probably last-entry in the company's popular QUEST FOR GLORY fantasy RPG series, which includes completely updated graphics and a new combat system, as well as new multiplayer options. Sierra is going way out on a limb with King's QUEST 8, Roberta Williams' classic adventure series, by transforming the game into a first-person, actionoriented affair. Sierra promises that it's still an adventure game, and, with Roberta Williams still at the helm, there's no reason to be skeptical--but to be honest, we're a little skeptical. We'll see adventure & rpg's Westwood's Lands of Lore 2: Guardians of Destiny is another long-awaited role playing game that will be out by the time you read this, but it didn't get into our hands in time for us to play. See our preview in CGW #159 for details. You've probably RIVEN heard by now that Red Orb is preparing the release of Riven: The Sequel to Myst, which was apparently some kind of adventure game that a few people bought. We got RIVEN as we went to presssee the story in our Stocking Stuffer Fantasy RPG fans looking for a great, immersive story to dive into when they're away from the computer should check out Jeff Smith's wondrous comic book, Bone.

LOSE YOUR MARBLES is an addictive lit tle puzzle that is great fun in single player mode against the computer, and even better when you challenge a real-life opponent (via hotseat or LAN). The idea of the game is to clear your marbles off a grid by lining up three or more of the same color before your opponent clears his. If you manage to line up five in a row, you'll dump a nasty load of marbles onto your rival. The skill lies in looking ahead, so that when you remove marbles from the board, a row of the same color might drop into place, causing a chain reaction. As your play area begins to fill up, it becomes more and more difficult to maneuver your rows of marbles. Allow your screen to fill up with marbles and you lose the game. LOSE YOUR MARBLES includes three skill levels (easy, difficult, and hard); multiple levels of gameplay; bonus marbles; and, in single player mode, additional bonus rounds.

Though both look good, we're recommending the college game because of its original concept. You can choose from among 32 college teams, using a dream team of real-life players from different periods in the schools' history.

Fortunately, EA's designers know they have something to prove this time around, so they've created an entirely new Al for NHL 98, with assistance from Colorado Avalanche coach Marc Crawford, that they hope will add to the game's realism.

The new 3D-rendered stadiums, motion captures, and native Windows 95 code are all in, but many of the hoped-for Al improvements, such as added penalties and extended stats, won't make it into the shipping version.

"BUYER'S GUIDE The 1997 Holiday Hot 100 Wish List Three highly anticipated simulations missed our holiday buying guide for various reasons, but they are definitely worth checking out if they make it to store shelves before Christmas. Fighter Squadron: Screamin' Demons Over Europe, the only World War II sim slated for release before Christmas, puts you in combat over the English Channel, the German Rhineland, and the North African desert in German, American, and British aircraft. Physics that have been radically improved Santa's Stocking Sims Some other sims that didn't make the Top 10 are definitely worth consideration. World War I aviation fans who insist on 3D graphics card support will want to check out FLYING CORPS GOLD from Empire. In addition to Direct3D graphics and force feedback joystick support, this enhanced sim includes full multiplayer support (avail, able as a patch for owners of the original FLYING CORPS), an editor for creating your own missions, and several new aircraft. DID'S EF2000 V2.0 supports 3Dfx and Rendition based video cards. This updated package includes the TacCom mission editor, various Al improvements over the original version, modem support, Internet play (via TEN), and both DOS and Windows 95 versions of the sim. With the abbreviated EF2000 Strategy Guide included, this is a great starter simulator, but it will appeal to experienced PC pilots too. If you have a family member who's addicted to SSI's Su-27 FLANKER (they're the ones who can read the words altitude, airspeed, fuel level, and vertical velocitybut nothing else-in Russian), you'll want to pick up the Su-27 FLANKER 1.5 mission disc for them. This adds a number of improvements to the simulation engine, OpenGL 3D graphics support, more than 150 new missions, support for longer missions, and 16 player multiplayer missions. Gamers who live for dynamic mission environments, in which the entire war is generated each time you launch a campaign, should ask Santa for a copy of Interactive Magic's F-22. The sim has some problems, such as inconsistent graphics, but no other jet sim released this year rivals its campaign engine detailed that you can view the instruments from outside the plane. F-22 ADF Multiplayer is included, and Activision promises to host free Internet play. A mission editor rounds out the package, sup. porting the creation of single and multiplayer missions. Activision couldn't get us a beta in time for our buying guide, and the planned mid-December ship date is cutting it awfully close if this is to make it to the shelves in time for the holidays Another sim that's high on our list but questionable for a holiday release is Digital Image Design's F-22 ADF, the sequel to EF2000. The sim packs beautiful 3D card support, improved flight and systems modeling, and a scripted campaign that features input from Air Force veterans who helped plan U.S. strikes in the Gulf War. You can fly the F-22 in combat missions or coordinate the action from a strategic standpoint at an AWACS radar station. In addition, DID plans to release F-22 TAW early next year. It will be an inexpensive package that will add a fully dynamic campaign that promises to be much beefier and more real istic than the one in EF2000. Finally, there's Novalogic's F-22 Raptor. At press time, the company still wasn't showing the game or giving much information on its feature set, but it was promised for an October release. We do know this sequel to F-22 LIGHTNING II will run under Windows 95, feature MMX (but not 3D card) support, and include improved flight models. Most intriguing is that Novalogic recent ly announced an agreement with LockheedMartin, under which the aerospace giant will provide input into the game's design and allow its name on the F-22 RAPTOR box. SCREAMIN' DEMONS OVER EUROPE over developer Parsoft's A 10 CUBA! are com plemented by damage models so complete that parts shot off aircraft have their own flight models. The sims 3D graphics are so Stocking Stuffers simulations If the flight-sim fan in your life doesn't have a 3D graphics card yet, you now know the perfect holiday gift. Adding 3D graphics hardware can make an incredible difference in both the look and performance of newer flight sims. While there are a variety of good cards available now, our top choices for this holiday season are cards based on the 3Dfx Voodoo chipset: They have the widest support and top-notch performance. The Canopus Pure 3D (www.canopuscorp.com) is the most feature packed of these, possessing 6MB of memory and a video output for playing games on your TV. SU-27 FLANKER CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

With the departure of series creator Chris Roberts from Origin, the team faced the task of proving that the game wouldn't suffer. Once gamers unwrap WING COMMANDER: PROPHECY, there will be no doubt that the series i s alive and well. In fact, the fresh blood in the RUTIA Unthinkable! I am destroyed! space sims development team has paid off, as Prophecy is poised to deliver the richest gameplay experience since WING COMMANDER II. Although you play a new character-a rookie named Casey-old favorites Mark Hamill, Tom \"Maniac\" Wilson, and Ginger Lynn Allen are back for the cinematic sequences. Prophecy delivers some of the best-looking cinematics yet, but the emphasis here is on the action, not the movies. An all-new 3D space-combat engine delivers beautifully rendered, fast action-with or without the aid of a 3D card. The look is greatly improved, with dynamic lighting effects and better explosions, as well as nebulae and other effects. Ship combat now features fighter craft with radically different capabilities. The capital ships you face are of unprecedented scale, and aren't likely to be taken out in one mission. The look is very Babylon 5-esque, down to the organic appearance of the ships flown by PROPHECY's new, malevolent enemy race. For once we'll see a space action sim in which battles can have differing outcomesthey aren't always win/lose situations.

Windows 95 CD-ROM, $59.95 Interplay, (800) INTERPLAY www.interplay.com The final frontier is yours to explore-if you have what it takes to graduate from STARFLEET ACADEMY. In this space simulator, Star Trek fans finally get the opportunity to try their hands at commanding a Federation starship. You'll take to the stars on a variety of missions at the helm of various classes of starships, with interim sequences at the Academy featuring William Shatner, George Takei, and Walter Koenig, reprising their roles as Kirk, Sulu, and Chekov. Battle sequences are the best yet in a Star Trek game, but they have a flavor that is more WING COMMANDER than traditional Star Trek (with a bit more targeting ability and damage control). However, this isn't just a space shoot-'em-up. As in the original series, it's rare that phasers are the first solution on a mission. Instead, you'll often find yourself playing the diplomat or solving intergalactic dilemmas as you boldly go where no gamer has gone before.

Heavy Gear Windows 95 CD-ROM, $49.95 Activision, (800) 477-3650 www.activision.com Ithough Activision no longer has the MECHWARRIOR franchise, the company is still planning to be a major player in the giant robot sim arena. HEAVY GEAR has much of the look and feel of the MECHWARRIOR Series, but it takes place in a universe based on Pod 9's HEAVY GEAR role playing and strategy series. Even at the pre-beta stage, HEAVY GEAR showed enemy Al with some cunning tricks up its sleeve. Enemy Gears will take cover behind rock outcroppings and structures when they come under fire, and will break into an all-out retreat if they're heavily outgunned. Units will try to circle around and flank you if you concentrate on a single enemy to the exclusion of others. Coordinated attacks also appear to be present, although it's hard to tell from a two-level playable demo. Gear maneuvers include crouching, sidestepping, dropping items, and picking up new weapons. You can even lob grenades over buildings and onto any enemies lurking on the other side. Although the engine is familiar (despite its 3D enhancements), the new gameplay aspects should make MECHWARRIOR fans happy to find this in their gift pile. 5. Forced Alliance Stocking Stuffers pace-sim fans tend to be science-fiction fans, so what better gift than the recently released video set of the Star Wars Special Edition trilogy? How about some classic science-fiction books that, with a little imagination, can beat even the most expensive efforts of Industrial Light and Magic. We suggest the space-battle classics Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. They'll take you on epic space battles right in the confines of your mind-now that's a hi-res display device! Windows 95 CD-ROM, $49.95 Ripcord Games, (408) 653-1897 www.ripcordgames.com ORCED ALLIANCE is a game in which rank, action, and foreign relations all matter. Here, rank isn't merely a pretty badge on your character graphic; with greater rank comes greater responsibility (whether it be commanding a squadron or an entire battle fleet). In the campaign, you'll be able to decide which alien races to ally with, maintain neutrality, or engage in outright hostilities. Your decisions have a real effect on the direction the story takes, so unlike most story based space sims, FORCED ALLIANCE offers real replayability. The graphics engine isn't as state-of-the-art as in other titles on this list, but the gameplay makes up for that. USSON SCOTCARO 12: \"STARSHIP TROOPERS More Space X-WING VS.

Mendel, the synthetic organism in Galapagos, utilizes NERM technology to survive. Much like a living organism, Mendel learns and develops new behaviors to survive. If Mendel steps off a bridge and sinks into a glowing pit of acid, he melts and regenerates, his mind is altered by the experience, and he becomes less likely to repeat his mistake. In other words, Mendel is not pre-programmed; he learns right before your eyes. NERM allows Mendel to express a number of behaviors resulting from the same stimulus.

"2. Panzer General II RET so Windows 95 CD-ROM, $59.95 SSI, (800) 601-7529 www.ssionline.com There are sequels, and then there are departures from the norm. While the first PANZER GENERAL was lauded for its clean SVGA-graphics palette, it looks dated indeed when compared to the lush splendor of PG II's hand-painted maps. The core of PG is still there, as fun is still the main emphasis. The original PG was the best-selling wargame in history, and we'll be very surprised if this sequel doesn't quickly usurp its throne. Nevertheless, a lot of subtle touches add needed realism: You must now trace to a city or map edge for supply: heavy bombers are replaced by medium bombers more appropriate to the operational nature of bat tle; the abilities of recon units are enhanced; and you can't simply drop into the enemy rear areas and start cranking out units.

Moving from France to Arnhem makes for a lot more interesting WWII gaming situation, and when you add in the improved line-of-sight algorithms, better Al, and vastly improved interface, it's hard to recognize much of the original.

But, like most other things, bringing that kind of quality home would set you back more than a few shekels. Well, not anymore. This $99 satellites-woofer combination delivers solid performance for game audio and music. CLAIME Cambridge SoundWorks recently introduced PC Works, a $99 satellites-woofer combination that delivers solid performance for game audio and music. And while the PC Works won't rattle the rafters, it does put out enough sound to comfortably fill the room; and it still sounds good at lower volume levels as well. In an A/B comparison against its sibling, the $350 MicroWorks, the PC Works' high-end had comparable clarity and definition, though the PC Works' low-end and max volume were clearly not as strong. Gaming audio was solid, with more than adequate bass on explosions, and the PC Works' high-end was again clear. Another minor annoyance is the PC Works' wall.wart power supply, which gloms most of an electric outlet, but that's a minor complaint.

"BUYER'S GUIDE The 1997 Holiday Hot 100 Getting Great Gifts for Gamers A How-to Guide for Finding the Right Game Gift for the Holidays s santa's other surprises Vour holiday shopping is going well. You finally found a Tickle Me Cookie Monster for little Jessica, a Mucous Tick for your nephew Max, and a green tie for Uncle Doug. All that's left is to find something for cousin Lee, the computer gamer Upon walking into your local software store, however, your senses are assaulted by brightly colored boxes of all shapes and sizes. Everything from tanks and airplanes to dinosaurs and sev. ered limbs vie for your attention. How on earth do you choose the right gift? The Hard ware) Choices The first thing you'll need to determine is what kind of computer Lee has, and how it's equipped. Of course, doing this without giv. ing away why you're asking will take some smooth talking. You might express interest in getting a computer of your own, and ask what kind of system Lee has for comparison Is it a PC, running Microsoft Windows, or a Macintosh? This determines in which section of the store you'll need to shop. PCs and Macs use different programs, although a very few games will include both PC and Mac versions on a single CD. Next up is determining which operating system (the program that controls how the computer works) they're using. On a PC, this will normally be Windows 95 Windows 3.1, or MS-DOS. On a Macintosh, it will be System 6. System 7 or Mac OS 8. Check the system requirements listing on the box of the product you're buy ing to determine which operating system it's designed for. Most new games are designed for Windows 95, so if your giftee has a PC and is still running MS-DOS or Windows 3.1, Windows 95 imight be the gift of choice instead of a game. Note that MS-DOS, games will run on Windows 95 systems, but setting up the comput er to run them properly can sometimes be a complex task. Unless the person you're buying for is very computer-savvy, it's best to stick to Windows 95 games. Other computer specifications you'll want to determine and check against the game's system requirements box are the following: 1. The amount of RAM (generally 8MB, 16MB, 32MB, or more) 2. CD-ROM speed (2x, 4x, 8x, or faster) 3. The type of processor (486, or the faster Pentium, Pentium Pro, and Pentium II in the case of a PC: or 68030, 68040, or PowerPC in the case of a Macintosh) 4. The speed of the processor (usually a number ranging from 25MHz up to 300MHz) Note that it's fine if you have more than what the box requires; which means a game that requires a 100MHz 486 with 8MB RAM should work just fine on a 233MHz Pentium II with 32MB RAM Finally, if Lee owns a PC, you'll need to find out what kinds of add-ons it has. Almost all gamers will have the Super VGA-graphics capability required by today's PCs, but a few cutting edge games require a 3D graphics card, as well. A mouse is de rigueur on today's PCs, but does the game require a joystick or gamepad, and if so, does Lee have one? At least there's one less add-on hassle-if you buy a Windows 95 game, you shouldn't have to worry about what kind of sound card Lee has. It Takes All kinds Now you know what type of system Lee has, so you can tell if a game will work on it. But you still haven't actually chosen a game! We've listed a variety of interests below, along with the genres of games that usually appeal to folks with those interests. Once you determine the genres Lee is likely to be interested in, check the appro priate section of the \"Holiday Hot 100\" for some can't-lose games.

"Burni In Our Ongoing Quest for the Best, We Test 7 Top-of-the-Line Systems from Major Manufacturers THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE by Loyd Case and Dave Salvator DECEMBER 1997 "


"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE As games relentlessly push hardware to its limit, AGP will give the PCI bus some muchneeded relief, allowing 3D games to increase both scene complexity and the amount of texture maps used to create next-generation titles. At the end of the larger AGP pipe waits a new generation of 3D accelerator engines, which, coupled with the P-II CPU, will offer substantial speed and image-quality improvements over previous generations. And while ell, it's that time of year again. A time when we go in search of the one thing every gamer Covets. No, not a blind date with Agent Sculley, but what may well be the next best thing for hard-core gamers: The Ultimate Game Machine (UGM). This time, we looked for the machine that cuts no corners, makes no trade-offs, and hits on all cylinders from the nanosecond you fire it up. Many showed up to play, but only a select few put the right components in the box and integrated those parts into a seamless unit. Not an easy task, given the drastic changes that have unfolded over the past year in the world of computer-gaming hardware. Since last year's UGM roundup, we've seen the introduction of a new CPU, the Pentium II (P-11); Intel's Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP); a new generation of faster 3D-graphics chips; and the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The Pentium II brings together several key technologies: a faster P6 (Pentium Pro)-class architecture, MMX, and the ability to scale up clock speeds that currently top out at 300MHz. USB will become more important to gamers over time, the current dearth of controllers, combined with DirectX/USB teething pains, seems to indicate that the dawn of the USB age is not quite upon us. In this first part of our fourpart series, we went looking for the best off-the-shelf \"burn, baby, burn\" system we could find—the kind we would buy if money was no object. We wanted performance and lots of it. And we found it, at times in some unlikely places. So hold onto your hat: We're set to tell all about the folks who did and didn't-put together all the pieces of the silicon puzzle for this year's magnum opus. "


"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Dell Dimension XPS D300 eval road-dog, and DirectX may have been installed at its previous stop. In real-mode drivers, Dell goes two for three: Mouse and audio drivers are ready to go, though a real-mode CD-ROM dri ver wasn't included. In a quick look at its USB functionality, the XPS D300 detect ed the ThrustMaster Top Gun joystick and installed the driver without incident. tion. While it certainly covered the fun. damental bases, including a US Robotics Sportster 56K X2 modem, Dell opted not to include more game-specific hardware, such as a PCI-based sound card that supports 3D positional audio, o r a dedicated game card that would better hold calibration settings for analog controllers. Also absent was a Zip longtime player in the home/multimedia markets, Dell is starting to make inroads into the gaming machine market as well. In its new XPS D300, Dell has put together some solid components, including an AGP version of STB's Riva 128-based Velocity 128. The result is a pretty stout rig that fared well for the most part in testing and caused no notable headaches during setup. A large step-by-step foldout manual details the setup process, and we got the box ready to roll in 10 minutes. The system's Phoenix BIOS allows rudimen. tary access to low-level system settings, though it doesn't get into much granu larity. Getting to the innards is a breeze; remove one thumb-screw and the tower's side panel slides off to reveal easily accessible system components. Other accoutrements include a 19-inch monitor, an Altec Lansing ACS-490 speaker system, and Microsoft's SideWinder Pro joystick The XPS D300 arrived with DirectX 5.0 installed, though this unit is a press In all four game tests, the XPS D300 posted very speedy frame rates, and it never hiccuped during general gameplay. As for performance, sometimes second best is fine. The XPS D300 turned in very respectable second-place finishes behind Falcon Northwest's mighty Mach Vin most tests and actually edged out the Mach V in the CD-ROM WinMark test. In all four game tests, the XPS D300 posted very speedy frame rates, and it never hiccuped during general gameplay. In fact, along with the Falcon, this Dell box was one of the least troublesome rigs we tested. Perhaps the XPS D300's only downer is its somewhat plain-Jane configuradrive for larger files and backup. Of course, all these items can be picked up after-market, and the Zip drive is an add-on option from Dell. For about $3,600, then, Dell's Dimension XPS D300 delivers solid game performance across the board. You may need to add bells and whistles to taste, but this box provides a good foundation. -DS RATED *** GLABS VOLS Exteig ou DOLI BiBi DECEMBER 1997 CGW "

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Falcon Northwest Mach V As you might guess, the system performed pretty well in other areas, too. The Plextor 12/20 CD-ROM drive generally kept pace with the supposedly faster EIDE CD-ROMs in other systems. In harmony with this system's \"every thing and the kitchen sink\" philosophy, Falcon Northwest builds in a Creative Labs DVD-ROM drive. This first-generation DVD system, howev. er, is probably the weakest link in the system; a better job of staying calibrated than sound card joystick ports. The Mach V also ships with a full complement of CH flight controllers, including the F16 Combat Stick, Pro Throttle, and Pro Pedals, a setup befitting the Mach V moniker. The keyboard is about the only mildly cheesy detail, but everyone seems to deliver mushy keyboards these days. alcon Northwest has long built custom systems tuned to the needs of hard-core gamers. This version of the Mach V system redefines the phrase \"over the top.\" Out of the box, everything sets up easily, though you may need help hefting the 21-inch Viewsonic monitor onto your desk. Falcon Northwest also delivers custom documentation that lists your personal setup, including hardware and software configurations. All the DOS real-mode drivers-CD-ROM, mouse, sound-are present and configured into the system, as was DirectX 5.0. Oh, and there's also the famous black T-shirt. The Mach V begins with an ASUS P2L97 AGP motherboard set at a 68MHz system bus clockthe Pentium Il processor actually runs at 306MHz. The Falcon's Award BIOS has lots of nifty tricks built into it for tweaking your system, but be warya poor choice means a very unstable system. Stir into the mix 128MB of 100MHz SDRAM, toss in a Diamond Viper 330 AGP accelerator (a CGW Editor's Pick last month) and you have a smokin' 2D/3D accelerator. However, the RIVA 128 wasn't good enough for Falcon Northwest, so it tossed in the Quantum3D Obsidian 100, which consists of two (yes, two) linked 3Dfx Voodoo PCI boards, each with dedicated frame buffer and texel proces. sors. Of course, it takes up two PCI slots, but the result is a GL QUAKE TimeDemo average (at 640x480) of 54.3fps! ea} el ajal This version of the Mach V system redefines the phrase \"over the top. Of course, any hot-rod system needs fast mass storage, and the Mach V certainly delivers. If one 10,000RPM Seagate Cheetah Ultra-Wide SCSI hard drive is good, then two should be better-especially when paired with a DPT caching RAID controller used to stripe data across the matched pair of Cheetahs. RAID Level 0-disk striping-essentially writes data across two drives in the most efficient manner possible, seriously increasing disk through put. The twin 4.5GB Cheetahs are seen as a single 9GB volume. This mass-storage subsystem generat ed a Business Disk WinMark nearly four times faster than the nearest competitor. The drive subsystem comes formatted as a single FAT32 volume. image quality isn't all that great, nor is performance. The Mach Vracked up very solid 2D bench marks, and the rest of the Direct3D benchmarks were pretty stellar. The innards of the system are cleanly laid out; to get into the case you merely remove two thumbscrews and pop the top off the midtower case. All connectors are labeled. In our quick USB test, Mach V saw the USB joystick without a problem, and then loaded its driver. Gamers are Falcon Northwest's bread and but ter, and it shows in the company's attention to detail. For example, the system ships with a CH Products speed-adjustable game card, which does All this excess of technology does have one downside: There are no slots free in the Mach V. If you like to occasionally get together with friends for a network frag-fest, you're out of luck-you'll fly the Mach V sans wingman. Of course, with the Supra modem, you can always play over the Internet, but nothing matches the visceral experience of watching your best friend's reaction as your AIM-9X flies up his tail pipe. We suggest that Falcon swap in the Obsidian 50 (which takes up only one PCI slot) and make a PCI Ethernet card an option. Still, while the Falcon Mach V seems a bit excessive, you'll be hard-pressed to find either a better performing system or one better tuned to the needs of gamers-if your wallet can survive the $8,500 price tag. -LC RATED ***** SLABS DECEMBER 1997 CGW "


"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Micron Millennia XKu icron was the only five-star rig reviewed in last year's UGM Off-the-Shelf Roundup. This year, it has put together another solid box that is an able performer and has many components in common with the other top finishers. Notable additions to this year's offering include an AGP-based Diamond Viper 330 that uses NVIDIA'S Riva 128 chip and Cambridge SoundWorks' MicroWorks speaker system. Getting the box up and running is painless, thanks to the poster-size installation guide. Ports are clearly labeled, and the XKu is up and running in 10 minutes. Getting to the insides of the XKu is a matter of removing one thumb screw and sliding off the case's side panel (it looks as though Dell and Micron have found the same case supplier). The system comes with DirectX 5.0 pre-installed, though we had to go dig. ging for realmode drivers for mouse, CD-ROM, and audio (which we eventually found), and then we had to configure them ourselves. The XKu did pass the USB test without any hiccups, and its Phoenix BIOS offers basic set. tings, though it lacks more detailed settings. EL LLLLLLLLS LIITOELEN LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL Notable additions to this year's offering include an AGP-based Diamond Viper 330 that uses NVIDIA's Riva 128 chip and Cambridge SoundWorks' MicroWorks speaker system. Like last year's offering, Micron's latest turns in solid performance across the board, and it's comparable to the Dell system. Favorable bumps came in 3D WinBench 97, and, to a lesser degree, running WinBench 97's Graphics WinMark test. But Micron's CD-ROM WinMark score was much slower, owing to its using a DVD-ROM to pull double-duty as CD-ROM drive and DVD-ROM. In game testing, Micron was again nearly dead even with Dell in just about every test, but was unable to run the TERRAMARK test, owing to a firmware bug that will most likely be fixed by the time you read this. Like Dell, Micron opted to have Microsoft's SideWinder Pro joystick be the only bundled game controller, and depending on your preference, you may want to nix it in favor of your controller of choice. Micron's box is also somewhat plain-Jane, covering the fundamental bases well, but not offering additional amenities, such as a choice of game controllers or a PCI audio board that supports positional 3D audio. Still, Micron has put together another solid offering, which fares well in nearly every test, though Dell delivers nearly equal performance and squarely beats the Micron on price. Micron does provide better speakers, and the DVD-ROM and decoder may be useful (or you could swap them out and save a few bucks). Aside from the DVD-ROM, the only real difference between the two systems is the speakers, and that probably isn't worth $500.-DS RATED **** COLABS DECEMBER 1997 "

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Solid Computing Game King the name is a little cheesy and the box is plain-Jane, but the Game King delivers reasonable performance at a decent price. Unfortunately, since Solid is a fairly small-fry reseller, its system is a generation behind in components and overall performance. Unpack the Game King and you find a rather unremarkable beige box. Setup is pretty straight chipset Solid just missed the boat on the AGP enabled 440LX motherboards, meaning that its system didn't have the advantage of an AGP graphics card or SDRAM. Intel's AMI BIOS doesn't allow for much tweaking, either, although I've found that the automatic settings are usually fairly optimal. Solid's choice of graphics adapters is actually very conservative, resulting in what would have Game King turned in a respectable 27.7fps average running GL QUAKE, and all frame rates were over 30fps on the four game tests. Gateway Destination in benchmark tests. One nice surprise was the performance of the Toshiba 24x CD-ROM. We ran into problems running Win Quake, but a driver update fixed the problem. Game King turned in a respectable 27.7fps average running GL QUAKE, and all frame rates were over 30fps on the four game tests. Despite some aging components, Game King's audio subsystem is a pleasant surprise and includes Creative's AWE-64 value edition (not a bad card in its own right) and the Diamond Monster Sound for 3D positional audio. Of all the systems we tested, Game King alone offered hardware accelerated 3D audio, and the components mated very nicely with the Cambridge SoundWorks speaker system. Although the Game King is nicely set up for gamers and has the most interesting audio setup of any system tested, its overly conserv. ative components mean that this systempriced just under $3,500-will become obsolete more quickly. For Solid to move into the big leagues, it needs to update its system to AGP and faster graphics. RATED ** forward, but we needed a bit of screwdriver work to open the case. Game King arrives with DOS real-mode drivers for CD-ROM and sound card configured, though we had to add the mouse command line ourselves. And though the system arrived with DirectX installed, it was the now-anti quated 3.0 version, not the current 5.0 version. In our quick USB test, Game King detected the USB Thrustmaster joystick and took the driver with no problem.

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Performance Tests How We Tested It's always a challenge to test systems. We assembled quite an arsenal of benchmarks and games to exercise all the sys. tems we gathered. General system testing was performed with WinBench 97; we used the Business Graphics WinMark, Business Disk WinMark, CD-ROM WinMark, CPUMark 16, and CPUMark 32. Benchmarking 3D graphics began with 3D WinBench 97 and continued with a host of games, including MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98, EA's Moto RACER, Psygnosis WIPEOUT XL, Eidos' TERRAMARK, and QUAKE (DOS, Win Quake, and GL QUAKE, where appropriate). We also benchmarked DOS performance using CBench. We conducted the synthetic tests with each system just as it came out of the box, since most people don't tweak with BIOS set tings or defrag the hard disk to move all the applications to the outer tracks. The Graphics WinMark tests were conducted at 1024x768x65,565 colors and 800x600xtrue-color (24-bit color for some systems, 32-bit color for others). In addition to the CDROM WinMark, we measured the CPU utilization for the CD-ROM. Be aware that we did only overall CD testing, not outer-track testing, but since most of the drives were either CAV (constant angular velocity) or partial-CAV drives, the outer-track performance will be better. Since most CDs aren't full, though, you'll rarely see the maximum performance possible on some systems.

After all, you wouldn't play FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 with the keyboard and no audio, would you? Ultimately, we wanted to see how the systems behaved with realistic loads. We conducted all the game tests at 640x480, unless otherwise noted. The QUAKE numbers are collected using QUAKE'S built-in TimeDemo feature. We ran TimeDemos 1, 2, and 3 and averaged the results. We ran MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 with detail features cranked up and in full-screen mode. You enable the frame-rate counter by pressing Shift-Z twice when in flight mode. We captured the frame rate using the supplied \"new features\" VCR replay that comes with the title. To enable the frame counter in Moto RACER, start the game from a DOS Window and type \"moto -ijklmnop\". Then, in the racing screen, hit Shift-F1 to turn on the frame counter.

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Gateway 2000 Destination 03803283 tion, big screen, big sound, 'nuff said. Running Direct3D games, we discovered that the Dh's 2D board has to be set to at least a 72Hz refresh rate or it and the PowerVR card won't play nice together. hough designed to live in the living room, the Gateway 2000 Destination (D6) is still a full-bore PC that turns out to be a rea sonably solid gaming rig. Two things make it especially compelling: a colossal, 31-inch monitor and the brawny Harmon Kardon Dolby ProLogic audio system. But the good news for gamers is that Gateway has finally added a long missing component: 3D iron in the form of VideoLogic's PowerVR-based Apocalypse 3Dx card. In addition, Gateway has added a Toshiba DVD drive and MPEG-2 decoder to make DVD movie-watching quite an experience. Setting up the D6 is pretty intuitive-thanks to the foldout, step-by-step installation poster-but moving the 31-inch monitor is a task for at least two burly types, and maybe three. The speakers for the Harmon Kardon receiver are a 5.1 configuration, and Gateway includes a spool of mon ster-cable for wiring them. Getting into the box requires a screwdriver, but six screws later you can get at most the components without skinned knuckles. The AMI BIOS offers basic access to system settings, though more detailed settings, such as memory timings, aren't exposed. As for game-readiness, D6 didn't arrive with DirectX installed, and though the unit shipped with real-mode drivers for mouse, DVD-ROM, and audio, we had to manually set those up. D6 didn't ship with the Windows 95 OSR 2.1 USB patch, but after we installed it, D6 had no prob. lem finding the USB Top Gun joystick. When it came to the tests, Dh's benchmark numbers fell decidedly in midpack, except for the CD-ROM WinMark test, where it fared poorly, owing to the presence of only a Toshiba DVD-ROM. And because the D6's monitor supports a maximum resolution of only 720x480 (3:2 aspect ratio, mak ing the Desktop a bit wider), we couldn't get an apples-to-apples comparison there. But at 720x480, the D6 turned in an unimpressive 79.3 Graphics WinMark, one of the slowest scores seen this roundup. CPU and storage subsystem bench mark results were respectable, and 3D WinBench 97 came in at 112; a decent score, though it pales in comparison to some other contestants. QUAKE and WinQUAKE TimeDemo scores at 640x480 were unimpressive, but GL QUAKE on the PowerVR was truly a sight to behold. TimeDemo scores averaged 32fps, and gameplay was a gas, Fast 3D accelera PowerVR ran TERRAMARK and WIPEOUT XL without problem, but Moto RACER wouldn't recognize the PowerVR card. The D6 posted good frame rates on those first two titles, though they were a good bit slower than the frame rates on the Dell and the Falcon. DVD playback on this unit was terrific, and not just because of the big screen/sound: The actual MPEG-2 decode quality was impressive. All told, the verdict on the D6 is, well, mixed. It's an impressive living room PC, but that does not a great game rig make. The PowerVR card is a wel. come addition, and performance is generally good, though not great, save for GL QUAKE. If you want your next rig to reside in the living room, then D6at about $4,400-is your guy, but if you're looking for a more conventional, bad-ass gaming box, you'd do well to cast an eye toward IRATED *** Dell or Falcon. -DS GLABS DECEMBER 1997 CGW "

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Sony Vaio ANAK USA WHE or this roundup, Sony wins kudos for the most unusually colored box: purple. The home electronics behemoth has been shipping PCs for a little more than a year now, and its latest Vaio (\"vie-o\") puts a few interesting twists on the conventional PC-like front-mounted video and audio inputs, for example. And while embedding speakers in a monitor isn't a new idea, Sony puts a woofer in the monitor's base to beef up the overall sound. The Vaio isn't touted as a game-specific box per se, but this could be an interesting machine for part-time gamers. Setup was very straightforward: The combination of a stepby-step foldout poster and color-coded cables made for a 10minute installation. Because Sony is positioning the Vaio as a consumer rig, it even hides the boot-up sequence behind its logo (\"Ignore that man behind the curtain\"). One key-press reveals the boot-up sequence, and you can then get inside the Vaio's Phoenix BIOS by hitting F1. Like most Phoenix BIOSes, it's long on basic tweaks and short on granularity. Getting into the Vaio is as easy as pushing one button and removing a side panel. DirectX was nowhere to be found on this system, though real mode drivers for audio, mouse, and CD-ROM were preconfigured and good to go. Vaio also detected the USB ThrustMaster joy. stick without a hitch. In terms of audio, the Yamaha OPL-SA chipset sounds fine under Windows 95, but its Sound Blaster audio is very tinny, and DOS gaming audio has an annoying ring to it. Neatly tucked away on the front panel is a drop-down door, behind which are CD-ROM, floppy, and Zip drives. In addition to a woofer in its base, the Vaio's monitor also has one USB port and a Walkman headphone jack so you can mute the speakers for play-time in the wee small hours. But despite all the wellthought-out design touches, the Vaio turns out to be an underachiever as a gaming box. Conspicuously absent is any game controller, and Vaio's numbers are, for the most part, less than stellar. The system turned in consistently slow numbers, bringing up the rear in most benchmark tests. These underwhelming numbers stem in large part from the Vaio's slower 233MHz Pentium Il clock speed and from Sony's decision to use ATI's PCI-based VGA All-in-Wonder, which, though versatile, uses the aging Rage Il chipset. Vaio turned in surprising second place finishes in both QUAKE and WinQUAKE TimeDemo tests. In D3D game testing, Vaio's frame rates trailed well behind all other contestants, and gameplay was sluggish in most titles except QUAKE and WinQUAKE. For gamers who are less concerned about fiery 3D performance and who want a versatile box that can pull part-time gaming duty the Vaio, priced at about $3,300, might be a good choice. But in this roundup, that wasn't what we were after. And so for the killer gaming rig, we'd reco RATED ***** ommend that you look elsewhere. -DS GLADO CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE The Power Macintosh: A Different Drummer Power Macintosh 6500/300 Contact: Apple Computer, (800) 5389696; www.powermacintosh.apple.com ith all the public scrutiny over Apple Computer in the past few months, we felt compelled to take a look at the Macintosh line of computers as a gaming platform. Apple supplied us with a Power Macintosh 6500/300, which uses the Power PC 603e clocking at 300MHz. The system comes with 64MB of RAM, 512KB of Level 2 cache, and an onboard ATI Rage Il chip with 2MB SGRAM for graphics. The system we tested also came with a 12x CD-ROM drive (some models have a 24x drive), a 4GB hard disk, a built-in Zip drive, and a 33-Kbps modem. As expected, setup is a snap. Unplug the sys tem, plug in the various cables, and turn it on. There's a small woofer actually built into the base of the midsized tower; the sound quality, while not reaching eardrum-splitting levels, is balanced and pleasing. We had to install Apple's latest system software update, System 8, as this Mac arrived with 7.6.3. It's hard to compare Macintosh performance to PC performance. Games that are ported from the PC run-not surprisingly-slower than their PC counterparts. For example, MACQUAKE gets around 13-14fps at 640x480about the same as on a Pentium P55C/200 with a good graphics card. DUKE NUKEM 3D for the Mac is even worse, at around 30fps (as opposed to 40-45fps on a 200MHZ Pentium system with a good graphics card). DUKE isn't really a good benchmark for the Power PC, though, since it uses a lot of 8 and 16-bit data structures initially designed to wring the last ounce of performance out of Intel CPUs. Macintosh games fared better. MARATHON 2 looked smoother than MACQUAKE, although we didn't get actual frame-rate numbers. Included in the box is a 3D-accelerated version of MECHWARRIOR 2. Its performance seemed reasonably good, and the image quality was pretty good, though not up to 3Dfx standards. Speaking of 3Dfx, there's now a 3Dfx board available for the Power Macintosh: the Techworks Power3D. We couldn't get one to test before deadline, but we'll be checking it out in the near future. one of the truisms about Mac gaming is that many of the better PC games make it to the Macintosh-eventually. The wait can be in excess of a year, though. As CGW's sports editor Jeff Green laments, however, action sports games almost never make it to the Macintosh. exclusive development of Macintosh games is becoming a thing of the past as well. Education titles fare better-most come with both Mac and Windows versions in the same package. So what's a Mac user to do? You might try an interesting software package that was released recently: Insignia's RealPC software emulator. Insignia claims it will run any DOS game, emulate MMX and Sound Blaster audio, and run most Windows 95 DirectX titles if the user sup plies his own copy of Windows 95. Again, we'll check this out in a future issue. Overall, the Macintosh 6500/300 is a nice sys. tem that would make a great gaming box if only leading-edge games were delivered on it in a timely fashion. Perhaps if Apple's fortunes turn around, Macintosh gamers won't have to play the worst game of all: the waiting game. -LC ve! CGW DECEMBER 1997 "


"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Conclusion pe asked the vendors for the best cut at high-performance systems for computer gamers. Falcon Northwest, alone, really took us at our word. Although way over the top, its Mach V shows the attention to gamers on which Falcon Northwest has built its reputation. The other companies interpreted our request a little differently. Dell delivered a very high performance system with a fairly straightfor ward selection of components and few frills. Solid's Game King bundled some aging technology (except for audio), but did perhaps the best it could with the resources of a small reseller. With a technology facelift, this would make for an interesting system. Until then, it's hard to give it a strong rec ommendation. Gateway's Destination came through as a pretty solid gaming rig, and GL QUAKE on the PowerVR has the potential to suck you in for marathon sessions in front of the Destination's 31-inch screen. Of all the systems we tested, the Sony was probably the most undistinguished. Sony really needs to get off the dime and do a better job of delivering bleeding edge game performance. If your pockets are very deep, the Falcon Northwest Mach V makes a very compelling argument for the kitchen-sink approach. It's clear from the overall choice of components that the guys at Falcon know what gamers need and try hard to take care of them. If you're wallet can't handle the Mach V, the Dell Dimension is a very solid, albeit austerely equipped rig.

"MODEM MADNESS NOOZ Are You Connected? here's been quite a bit of fast talk about faster data rates for getting on the Internet. With at least half a dozen different modem types all vying for dominance, and an ongoing standards squabble still raging over 56K technologies, the landscape has become cluttered, to say the least. These technologies range from the fairly familiar (56K, ISDN) to the more exotic (Hughes Network Systems DirecPC satellite dish).

For gamers, on the other hand, more speed is certainly welcome, but two things-latency and dropped data packets-will make or break your online gaming experience no matter how fast the connection speed (for more on latency, see the \"How We Tested\" sidebar). The good news for online gamers is that developers are creating more content with the PHOTOS BY SCOTT PETERSON DECEMBER 1997 "


"MODEM MADNESS Internet as the primary run-time platform, not as just an afterthought. So as the data pipes into our homes continue to widen, developers are learning how to make games that are not only tolerable to play on the Internet, but are also truly compelling. Take, for example, Interactive Magic, with its WWII flight-sim title WARBIRDS, or id Software's reworking of Quake into QUAKEWORLD, a much more Internet-friendly version of the original title. Despite these encouraging trends, however, we need to face the fact that a lot of online gaming is still, well, suboptimal-especially if you're accessing the online world using an aging 14.4Kbps modem. Or perhaps your oncespeedy V.34 33.6Kbps modem is starting to feel a bit poky. What's your next move? Will a 56K modem deliver enough additional performance to make it worth shelling out $100-200 bucks, or do you get more aggressive, and opt for ISDN or some other burgeoning higher-bandwidth technology? We tested several 56K modems and ISDN terminal adapters and came away with some interesting findings. We examined not only how fast these units can bring the online world to your screen, but also something equally, if not more, important for gamers: how much latency they introduce. We also took a look at the current state of evolving technologies on the radar screen, such as ADSL and cable modems. So without further ado, let's see what these babies can do. LAGGING NO MORE SDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) has been something of a stepchild in the data/communications community. Too expensive for most homes in the past and too slow for most businesses, ISDN was often referred to jokingly as «I Still Don't Need (it).\" But deregulation in the telecommunications industry is changing much of that in some parts of the country, with many of the Bell Operating companies now offering home ISDN services, mainly for Internet access. If you're one of the lucky ones who lives in a part of the country with low-cost ISDN availability, be aware that it's not quite as simple as adding another phone line. Although terminal adapters (aka ISDN \"modems\") are much easier to use, it's still helpful to understand the basics. ISDN service into your home is known as a BRI, or Basic Rate Interface. It consists of two 64Kbps (that's kilobits per second) B channels plus another 16Kbps D channel that's shared between the two B channels and is used mostly for signaling (for example, ringing the phone). The D channel can actually be used for data after a call is initiated, giving a potential aggregate throughput (before compression) of 64Kbps + 64Kbps + 16Kbps, or 144Kbps total. You'll be assigned two phone numbers. In addition, most phone companies assign SPIDs (Service Provider IDs) to each line. For example, my Regional Bell Operating Company, Pacific Bell, just tacks 0101 at the end of each phone number for the SPID. Not all areas make proper use of the D channel, however, Some parts of Pacific Bell (mine, for example) instead \"steal\" 8Kbps of bandwidth from each B channel for signaling purposes. Thus, instead of two 64Kbps + one 16Kbps-144Kbps total-I have a pair of 56Kbps lines, or 112Kbps ZOOM 661 BESAR CGW DECEMBER 1997 "


"MODEM MADNESS 3COM IMPACT 10 total. This temporary situation will fade as digital switches are upgraded. ISDN is much cheaper now, but still not as cheap as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) While typical monthly rates for a pair of ISDN lines are only a little more than a single analog phone line, even local calls have a per-minute charge during the business day, but you get up to 200 free hours at night. The fast data pipe is certainly attractive: You can do better-than-postage-stamp video conferencing, though it's still pretty jerky. You can download those game patches much faster. However, for gamers, IDSN's real benefit is reduced latency. Anyone playing games over the Internet knows what a killer high lag-times can be. In tests using the Windows 95 Trace Route program, even the slowest ISDN terminal adapter had packet round-trips about two thirds that of a 33.6Kbps modem—the fastest adapter could send and retrieve a packet of data in only 25 percent of the time it took a standard modem. More noteworthy is that ISDN terminal adapters turned in lower Trace Route times than even the fastest 56K modem tested here as well. As with modems, all ISDN terminal adapters (TAs) are not created equal. We took a look at three representative TAs, and found that each has its own unique way of connecting you to the Net. the 3Com ImpactlQ behaves much like a traditional external modem, although the external case more closely resembles 3Com's Ethernet hubs. There are convenient connectors on the back for two analog telephony devices, such as a standard telephone or fax machine. Unlike most modems, there is no power switch: it's always running, which is a good thing if you have a phone or fax attached. There's an RJ45 jack for the ISDN connection and a 25-pin serial port for connecting to the computer. 3Com supplies both cables. Installation and setup is the easiest of all the TAs tested. Since it's external, all you need to do is plug in the power brick, attach the serial cable at both ends, and plug in the ISDN cable. The real gem, though, is the software for setting up the phone lines. You don't have to enter anything: The Impacto software autodetects the switch type, sets the numbers, and sets up your SPIDs. It was one of the simplest setups I'd ever done. Impacto uses the standard Hayes AT command set to communicate with your computer. I was able to establish a direct connection to a CompuServe ISDN number by dialing direct, which is convenient. In our Trace Route tests, the ImpactlQ proved to be the slowest, probably partly due to the serial port overhead. Still, Trace Route times averaged about 82 milliseconds (ms), versus the 116ms posted by the SupraSonic 33.6 baseline V.34 modem. And despite its poor performance versus other ISDN TAs, it's still faster than even the fastest 56K modem. Overall, the 3Com is the simplest to set up and use-almost a \"no-brainer.\" Although a little on the slow side, the two always-active telephony connections and ease of use make the 3Com a contender. -LC ImpactIQ External Price: $275 Contact: 3Com.

If you're interested in getting into ISDN for relatively little cost, check out the NetCommander. -LC Hardware setup is about as easy as any ISA card. The NetCommander is a Plug-andPlay device, and since it's not seen as a modem, it doesn't conflict with the serial port (but it does need its own IRQ). Configuring the ISDN lines wasn't quite as easy, but the NetCommander's utility had a pretty simple user interface. That's good, because the manual is nearly useless once you get past installing the hardware; the online help was only a little better. It does have a connection for a POTS device such as a telephone, but the connection is live only while the computer is powered up.

CONS: Poorly organized documentation; setup can be difficult TRATED  MO HOW WE TESTED f any computer-related technology, modem testing is truly a black art, usually best left to magi, swamis, and clairvoyants. The difficulty of the task is compounded by the fact that modems are used, by and large, to connect to the Internet, itself a very unpredictable beast. With that in mind, our testing centered around trying to remove as many other components from the equation as possible. Now bear in mind that in the real world, any one of these components (your ISP's modems, a slow router, phone-line conditions, planetary alignment) can still affect performance. Our testing breaks down into two areas: throughput and average ping time to and from terminal server. To gauge throughput of the 56K modems, we ran tests over a public switched telephone network (PSTN) simulator, which follows the proposed guidelines initially described by International Telecommunications Union (ITU). The Throughput versus File Type (TVF) test evaluates a modem's compression capability on a line with low impairment levels for three representative file types: moderately compressible text, slightly compressible executable, and an incompressible file. The files were transferred from the digital server to the client modems and throughput performance was noted. Perhaps more than throughput, the real party-killer for gamers can be latency, a measure (in milliseconds) of how long it takes a piece of data to be sent from one modem to another, and for the receiving modem to send back an acknowledgment that it received the data. Lower ping times are better. To give you an idea, on an Ethernet local area network (LAN), 56K MODEMS AVERAGE THROUGHPUT VS.

"MODEM MADNESS OTHER ON-RAMPS ntil now, the only widespread alternative to analog phone lines for home users has been ISDN. In the coming year, that will begin to change. The hunt for faster data pipes and reduced latency is in full force. The Holy Grail of Net gaminglatency equivalent to a local area network-may not be as far off as feared. Almost all of the new services are asymmetric in nature: Downloads typically occur faster than data going to the network from your PC-albeit faster than a standard modem (except for DirecDuo). A lucky few in some parts of the country are beginning to get cable modems. Cable modems are rolling out slowly, though, partly because many local cable networks were never designed for two-way communication, and have to be retrofitted. Another reason is that cable-modem standards have fluctuated until recently. A cable modem attaches to your system via an Ethernet connection, so in addition to the cable modem, you'll need a LAN adapter. One of the unresolved controversies is performance. You may see great performance when you're the only connection at your head end, but as more users are added in your neighborhood, the bandwidth gets shared, and individual modem performance will most likely suffer. The various regional phone systems have finally woken up to the threat of cable modems, and have responded with XDSL. \"XDSL\" is a catchphrase describing a set of digital subscriber line services (hence the \"DSL\"). The one that will affect consumers the most is ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line). ADSL IS cool in that it doesn't require upgrading your telephone lines (if they're fairly new)-it works over copper. However, current technology requires you to be within 3.5 miles of the central office, leaving rural areas and many outlying suburbs out of the picture. This minimum dis tance will probably increase as the technology gets better. Pacific Bell, for example, will be offering two types of ADSL. One form will allow downstream speeds of up to 1.5Mbits/sec, but upstream is only at 384Kbps. The other service option is 384Kbps in either direction (not really \"asymmetric,\" but the technology is the same). Pricing hasn't yet been set. One final alternative is DirecDuo, from Hughes. You can get cable-quality television and Internet services from a single source. However, the implementation appears a bit kludgy for gaming purposes. You communicate upstream to the ISP via your good old analog modem. Downloads are handled through a small (roughly 18 inches in diameter) satellite dish that picks up a transmission from geosynchronous orbit (roughly 23,000 miles up). Can you say \"lag time\"? It's very possible that within a year, many people will be using alternatives to your good old analog modems. Still, it's hard to beat the low cost of today's 56Kbps modems. Even if you throw in a second phone line, it's still a pretty cheap way to connect. But it will never give you the low latencies of a LAN. -LC HOW WE TESTED ping times are often under 10ms, and in a game like QUAKE, are usually somewhere around 20-40ms. On the Internet, ping times are usually in the 200-300ms range, or worse. Modems can sometimes account for nearly 100ms of that latency, so finding a modem with the lowest ping time can make quite a difference. To figure out both the 56K and ISDN modems' ping times, we used a Windows 95 program called Trace Route (tracert.exe), which will report, hop-byhop, how long the round-trip transmission/receipt acknowledgment took. We focused on the first hop, which is from the client modem to the ISP's terminal server modem, took 50 samples, and then averaged them. For testing 56K modems, we used two different ISPs, CompuWorld and InReach, both of which are currently supporting both 56K standards. For comparison, we also tested Diamond's SupraSonic 336V+ V.34 modem as a baseline to see how much faster the 56K modems would be. For ISDN Trace Route tests, we used Pacific Bell's ISP service. When looking at latency numbers, assume that the client modem is responsible for about half of the latency, and the terminal server modem for the other half.

"MODEM MADNESS USR SPORTSTER 56K ( espite more exotic offerings, 56K modems still represent the main Internet hookup option for many people. With technologies such as ISDN, ADSL, and cable modems, there may not be a local service provider, or, for that matter, an ISP who offers these connectivity options. But the biggest problem with 56K modems is that this technology has splintered into two variants: X2 and K56Flex. Which standard will win the day is still an open question. So, the more important question is: Will the 56K modem I buy today still work after the new single 56K standard is solidified sometime next year? Most modem vendors are promising upgrades to this new standard (some of them free), so the news on the continued compatibility front seems pretty good. longtime player in the modem market, US Robotics (USR) developed, and has been the main proponent of, X2 56K technology. Even after being recently acquired by 3Com, a driving force behind the Open 56K specification (see sidebar), USR continues to heavily evangelize X2 technology, and has lined up a fairly hefty array of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in its camp. Getting the Sportster up and running was fairly straightforward, though USR doesn't include a serial cable needed to connect the unit to your machine. Sportster's ports are clearly labeled, and though there are DIP switches for enabling/disabling different features, they too are clearly labeled. The unit also has a power switch and volume control and its front-panel status lights will give you a good idea what the unit's up to during operation. While Sportster's numbers show that it's not quite the fastest of the lot, it is still consistently fast. It had the highest reported initial connect speeds of all the 56K units we looked at around 50Kbps), and its ping times to ISP terminal servers were again, not the fastest, but not the slowest. Its ping time numbers and reported initial connect speeds between the two ISPs we tested with were pretty consistent however. USR has publicly stated that it will offer free upgrades to the forthcoming single 56K specification when it is finalized, so Sportster will continue to be Net-worthy. If your local ISP is supporting X2, the Sportster should serve you well. -DS Even with 56K, however, your ISP may not yet even offer these services, or may have opted to offer only one. That could therefore limit your choice of which 56K modem to consider. In addition, you may have to look for a new ISP to take advantage of your 56K modem. Before making any investment, find out from your ISP which flavor it is supporting or plans to support. Another issue to consider: Your mileage may vary from ISP to ISP. There are a myriad of possible explanations for this variance, but you should remember that, just because you got a hot new 56K modem, you won't automatically see the 50Kbps+ data rates brazenly promised by modem makers. In fact, the best rates we saw from the four units reviewed here was right about 50Kbsp. Apparently, there's some current FCC regulation that caps peak X2 modem throughput at 53Kbps, and you'll most likely get that speed only on a sunny day going downhill with a tail wind. Still, 50Kbps is faster than the data rates most of us currently live with. And there's more good news for gamers. Most of the 56K units here get better ping times than the V.34 baseline modem used, and the difference can be dramatic. Echoing last year's message, we recommend external modems, simply because their installation is so simple. All four units installed problem-free, and because the COM port's I/O resources are readily known to DOS, older DOS titles should have no problem getting at the modem either. And despite the current schism in the 56K world, all four units reviewed here are software-upgradable, and all four companies are offering free upgrades to the new single 56K standard when it arrives sometime next year. So if you're in the market for a 56K modem, check out our evaluations of these units. Sportster 56K Price: $219 wl $50 mail-in rebate Contact: USR/3Com.

"MODEM MADNESS OPEN56K: DIAMOND SUPRAEXPRESS 56E SupraExpress 56e Price: $140 Contact: Diamond Multimedia, (800) 468-5846 www.diamondmm.com PROS: Fastest ping-times; Inexpensive. CONS: Poor performance on throughput tests. GLABS RATED *** PANACEA OR PIPE-DREAM? 1f 56K technology had an astrological sign, it would be Gemini. Since its inception, there's been a twin-track of development, splintering into Rockwell/Lucent Technology's K56Flex, and 3Com/USR's X2. Unfortunately, these two flavors of 56K, though in many ways similar, are different enough that they won't interoperate. And as these behemoths duke it out for dominance over what will be the prevalent method for connecting to the Internet for the next couple of years, it's we, the end-users, who wind up having to tolerate the headaches created by this megaspat. Why can't the players involved just get along? The controversy stems from several factors: The principals, USR/3Com and Lucent Technologies, are each trying to leverage their intellectual property (IP) patents-some held, some pending-and in turn are trying to put into place licensing fee structures for use of their respective technologies. At a recent meeting of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Study Group 16 in September, the major players failed to produce a \"determined document\" outlining technical details of the new \"uni. versal\" 56K modem specification, dubbed V.PCM. The result is that a final version of V.PCM that vendors can actually use probably won't show up until sometime next spring. Fortunately for end-users, almost all modem vendors worth their salt are offering free upgrades to the new V.PCM standard once the ITU and the players involved iron out the details. What's at stake here? Big bucks. Until other communications technologies can compete on both price and performance, the winner of the lion's share of the burgeoning 56K modem mar. ket will be laughing all the way to the bank. Should you hold off until next year, when the new V.PCM modems are available? Not necessarily. If you're still slogging along with a 14.4Kbps modem, a new 56K modem, X2 or K56Flex, will offer a considerable performance boost. Come next year, you should be able to upgrade it to remain compatible with the new V.PCM standard. -DS lamond Multimedia bought its way into the modem business by acquiring Supra several years ago. The company has offered a line of modems ranging from a fairly basic model up through its SupraSonic (the V.34 version that we used as a baseline for comparison in our initial connect speed and ping time tests) Diamond's latest K56Flex based SupraExpress 56e is a pretty basic 56K offering The unit itself is pretty small, and its ports are unlabeled. It does come with hard-wired serial cable, but lacks a power switch and onboard volume control. Its front panel status lights are pretty minimal: They show power, send data, receive data, and off-hook. The SupraExpress's performance is decidedly mixed. On the one hand, it was the poorest performer across all three file types in the average throughput test. It also had just about the slowest reported initial connect speeds with both test ISPs. On the other hand, it had the best ping times with both ISPs, a real plus for gamers. And in gameplay testing, SupraExpress held its own. At $140, the SupraExpress delivers fast TraceRoute times, but bear in mind its spotty throughput performance. --DS 56Kx's throughput numbers are unre. markable, though they are faster than Diamond's. In just about every test except for the ZIP file, the 56Kx is slower than both X2 units. Its average initial connect speeds were also somewhat disappointing, in the lower 40s. In ping-time tests, we saw some thing of a Jekyll and Hyde effect. When connected to CompuWorld, 56Kx's ping times were the fastest (tied with Diamond), but when connected to In Reach, they were slower even than the V.34 baseline unit, and we saw numerous time-outs, indicating dropped packets. Gameplay confirmed this number, as the 66Kx seemed to cause numerous hiccups. Its gameplay performance was smoother when connected to CompuWorld, however. The 56Kx has its moments, and the slug gish performance we encountered was only going through one ISP. But that, coupled with its unremarkable throughput numbers and average reported initial connect speeds leaves us somewhat reluctant to recommend the 56Kx as a gaming modem. -DS ZOOM 56KX 56Kx Price: $149 Contact: Zoom Telephonios, (800) 631-3116 www.zoomtel.com erhaps hoping for brand recognition from a generation of users raised on PBS educational programming, Zoom has both a 56K modem and an ISDN unit in this roundup. The company's K56Flex-based 56Kx modem, however, presents something of a mixed bag, The unit has labeled ports and a front mounted power switch (nice touch), but doesn't ship with a serial cable to connect it to your machine. The front panel has the most elaborate array of status lights of any 56K unit tested, and will even indicate in which mode you're connected: V.34 (33.6Kbps) or 56K.

"MODEM MADNESS GLOBAL VILLAGE TELEPORT other than the Diamond SupraExpress was. If you don't need status lights, TelePort (at $99) is an inexpensive unit that delivers solid performance and consistent ping times. -DS TA BER lobal Village is a modem maker more familiar to Mac-heads, but the compa Iny's X2-based TelePort modem is its first foray into the PC market. In entering the 56K fray, Global Village opted to use USR's X2 technolo gy, which several other modem makers have also embraced A very slim external unit a little bigger than an audio cassette casethe TelePort has port labels that are Mac style iconic symbols for the phone line and phone connections. The unit has a power switch, though it lacks a volume control. Teleport ships with a hard-wired serial cable, and its front panel status lights are pretty minimal, showing only power, connect, and data transfer In testing, TelePort was the faster of the two X2 units we looked at, and performed well versus the K56Flex modems in the roundup. Its reported initial connect speeds to the two ISPs were slower than the USR X2 unit but Global Village achieved higher initial connect speeds than either K56Flex unit. As for average ping times, TelePort's were identical to the USR unit, and were comparable to the k56Flex units going to one ISP, though were slower in going to the Teleport Price: $99 Contact: Global Village, (800) 736-4821 www.globalvillage.com GLOBAL VILLAGE Teleport PROS: Inexpensive fastest throughput perlormance on four of six tests. CONS: Lacks front-panel status lights and onboard volume control IRATED  CLABS consistent, though not as fast as Diamond's. And while the difference in latency times compared to Diamond was noteworthy when connected to one ISP, it was negligible when con nected to the other. Their throughput numbers were also better across different file types, however. Zoom's 56Kx delivered spotty latency performance, and mid-pack throughput. If your ISP offers only k56Flex, we would lean toward the Diamond. If your ISP offers only X2 service, we'd give the nod to Global Village espite advances by 56K modems, and several interest: ing connectivity technologies on the horizon, ISDN is the way to go for now if you can get service in your area. Though certainly not as cheap as standard dial-up service, ISDN clearly delivers lower latency, and setting up an ISDN terminal adapter, though not always stupidsimple, has gotten considerably eas. ier. If ISDN isn't an option, 56K modems do deliver better latency performance than their V.34 predecessors, but that performance can vary widely from ISP to ISP. So, in addition to investing in a new 56K modem, you may find yourself having to seek out another ISP to get optimal latency times. For the purposes of Internet gaming (there's another use for the Internet? Oh, yeah, down. loading game patches) the Supra NetCom. mander seems to be the sweet spot. The 3Com Impacti deserves kudos for convenience and ease of setup, but the relatively slow speed is a concern. Finally, the Zoom/Duo may be of interest to someone who really needs the V.34+ISDN capabili ty-and it's certainly fast enough--but be aware that setup may be troublesome. As for the 56K guys, Diamond's SupraExpress 56e delivered the best per formance in terms of latency, though its throughput numbers underwhelmed. The X2 units both turned in identical latency performance, which was OH5D ROON wa SupraExpress 56 CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

This has the effect of reducing choice for the end users. With the host of fast 3D accelerators now on the street, it's really unfortunate that GL QUAKE and all its cousins and siblings continue to be supported on only a couple of 3D chipsets. DirectX 5.0 is worth getting, however, if only for the setup and user control enhancements. At this rate, Windows gaming might one day actually be easy, stable, and fast.

This makes troubleshooting a lot easier: You can turn features on and off, turn hardware acceleration on and off, and even activate a \"debug\" mode, though I Add r emove Lopes A WORK IN PROGRESS DirectX 5.0 feels a lot more polished than past releases, but it's still a work in progress. While Direct3D is more robust, To congue resta controle d e controler end cick Proper Utane Add or emowltonata update tagaje controleret GETTING REAL (MODE, THAT IS) One of the thornier issues with Windows 95 games is running titles from the DOS prompt. If you run from a Windows 95 DOS box, performance may suffer. If you \"Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode,\" you need to have your DOS CD-ROM and other necessary drivers loaded in CONFIG.SYS. The problem with this is that some CD-ROM device drivers, when loaded before Windows 95 starts up, put Windows into \"compatibility mode\"—and performance suffers. (You can tell by popping up the \"System\" control panel applet and selecting the performance tab.) However, if you're the lucky owner of a Creative Labs sound card, you may have a better alternative. It's called CTLOAD. CTLOAD is a small program that lets you load a device driver from the DOS prompt. Why is this useful? The answer lies in the DOSSTART. BAT file, which executes when you run the \"Restart in MS-DOS mode\" shutdown option. Sure, you can always create custom configurations that will load all your drivers, but this is easier. Here's an example of CTLOAD in action in a DOSSTART.BAT file: C:\\ASPI8DOS.SYS ID CTLOAD C:\\ASPICD.SYSID: MSCD001 C:\\mscdex.exe /d:mscd001 Im:16 C:\\logitech mouselmouse ASPI8DOS and ASPICD.SYS are required for running DOS games off a CD-ROM, but I sure don't need them cluttering up my CONFIG.SYS file. Luckily, CTLOAD solves that problem nicely. SHEDDING OLD FUR If you've been digging around in your root directory, you may have noticed a couple of hidden extraneous files taking up space. The names of the files are SUHDLOG.DAT, W95UNDO.DAT, and W95UNDO.INI. These files are created when you upgrade over an existing Windows 3.x installation. W95UNDO.DAT, in particular, can take up more than 6MB of disk space, since it contains compressed versions of Windows 3.x files that were replaced by the Windows 95 upgrade process. If you don't think you'll be going back to Windows 3.x, you can safely remove the files by running the \"Add/Remove Programs\" control panel applet and uninstalling the \"old Windows 3.x and MS-DOS files\" entry. Don't just delete them, unless you've reinstalled Windows 95 from scratch since the original upgrade. DECEMBER 1997 CGW "

"***** REVIEW . DIAMOND STEALTH II HARDWARE Fast 3D for Less New Diamond Stealth || Breaks the $ 100 Barrier by Loyd Case very now and then some product comes out of left field, grabs me by my lapels, and screams \"Pay attention!\" The Diamond Stealth II is such a product. It uses Rendition's new V2100 2D/3D accelerator chip, and the combination of Diamond's driver-writing abilities coupled with the innovative architecture of the Rendition chip make for a very interesting product. Throw in 4MB of 12-nanosecond SCRAM and sell it for $99, and it moves from the interesting\" column to the \"jaw lands here\" column. The card installed very smoothly, and Diamond's by-now-familiar driver setup process also went smoothly. During testing, we encountered only one glitch: The CBench SVGA-graphics test crashed with a divide overflow, but we had no problems with QUAKE, DESCENT II, or DUKE NUKEM 3D in SVGA-graphics mode. Using our test-bed system, a 200MHz Pentium with MMX, the WinBench 97s Business Graphics WinMarks scores were pretty good: 85.2 at 1024x768x16 and 80.7 at 800x600x32. More impressive was the Stealth's 3D WinBench score. At 126, it was just a tad shy of Diamond's 3Dfx-based Monster 3D (which posted a 130). Actual gameplay was pretty good, too. Direct3D games played smoothly for the most part and looked great. FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 ran at a steady 18—22fps, and MOTO RACER ran 25-40fps. Direct Draw performance was good, too, with both WinQUAKE Price: $99 (using nowindirect) and DESCENT Vendor: Diamond 11/95 running smoothly. SVGA-graphMultimedia, ics scores were also quite good: 47fps San Jose, CA (800) 468-5846 for DukeBench and 16.2fps running www.diamondmm.com DOS QUAKE's three Time Demo tests. Reader Service #: 317 | While standard VGA-graphics performance in Rendition's newest chip has improved somewhat, it was still pretty slow. We saw only 39.1fps in CBench VGA graphics and an average of 28.1 fps in QUAKE using its DOS VGA-graphics mode. Still, with VGA graphics increasingly becoming a moot issue, the overall performance of the Stealth II was a very pleasant surprise. It's not just that it's very affordable; it's about the best $100 card I've ever seen. APPEAL: Gamers on a tight budget looking for a fast 3D accelerator. PROS: Very good 3D and 2D Windows performance; good SVGAgraphics performance; very low cost. CONS: Poor standard VGAgraphics perfor mance.

"***** REVIEW  ASUS P2L97-S MOTHERBOARD Do-It-Yourself AGP HARDWARE by Loyd Case f you've been waiting with bated breath to upgrade your system to AGP, then read on. The ASUS P21.97-S represents the first of a new breed of motherboards, as it integrates the Intel 440LX chipset with a built-in Adaptec Ultra-Wide SCSI in a compact, ATX form-factor package. Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) is designed as a high speed, dedicated bus specifically for graphics. AGP doesn't help much for 2D graphics, but does enhance 3D graphics performanceespecially when there are textures too large to fit in the RAM on the video card. The 440LX has full support for 2x sidePrice: $325 band addressing and ACP texturing, and (without CPU) the dedicated bus should also help, once Vendor: contention with the PCI bus begins to ASUS Computer increase. The 440LX also supports International (408) 474-0567 SDRAM-though only at a 66MHz syswww.asus.com tem clock-and UltraDMA/33 hard Reader Service #: 316 I drives. The double-decker rear panel ATX port layout has two USB ports in addition to the usual parallel, 2-serial, mouse, and keyboard ports. There's also a CD containing Windows 95 bus-mastering CIDE drivers and an INF update for the chipset, as well as some system management. ASUS even supplies the flash update utility on the CD for future BIOS updates. The manual is well-written, though at times it's a bit terse. Installation is pretty typical for a motherboard, though the ASUS' compact size makes it a bit easier to install than your average board. The ATX form factor eliminates the need to figure out serial connections. This board only uses DIMMs, so be prepared to pony up for SDRAM or 3.3 volt unbuffered EDO DIMMs. It takes up to 384MB of RAM in three DIMM slots; parity and ECC RAM is supported. The onboard SCSI interface is easy to connect, but you need a special adapter (not supplied) to connect to external devices. One other cool feature is that you set the CPU speed in the BIOS no longer do you need to play«hunt the jumper.\" For serious gearheads who want to know, the board comes with the A3 stepping of the 440LX chipset. Overall, the P21.97-S is another step in the evolution of system boards. The road to AGP has finally been opened for do-it-yourself upgraders. APPEAL: Do-it-yourselfers looking for a solid AGP motherboard. PROS: AGP; UltraDMA/33 and onboard SCSI support; jumperless; ATX form factor. CONS: Typical motherboard installation.

"AUDIOTRIX 3D-XG REVIEW *** ISA's Last Stand by Loyd Case HARDWARE Windows 95 including low-resolution. WAV auclio -was pretty damed good, though. Despite the good sounds in Windows 95, the crash problem with Media Player is troubling. What's more, 3D-XC doesn't come cheap at $295. If Media IX can address some of this instability-and free up the IRQ unnecessarily grabbed for Windows Sound System compatibilitythis could be a more interesting card. & tsa sad truth that just as a technology matures and gets easier to set up and usc, it's also made obsolete by the next technology shift. So it goes with sound cards. The next generation of sound cards will be PCI based and offer sophisticated, 3D-positional audio. But there's still life left in the world of ISA sound cards, as evidenced by the Media TriX Audiotrix (say that three times, quickly) 3D-XG. The 3D-XC is about as casy to installas any Plug-and-Play audio card. If you have a fairly plain system, then you'll have no problems; with some systems, you may have to tweak some of the I/O address settings in the Device Manager. There's also a handy DOS (remember DOS?) control panel for adjusting settings for DOS games. At first, the specs for this card look very interesting. They feature an attached, Yamaha-manufactured SW60XC wavetable daughtercard. The fly in this ointment, though, is the Yamaha OPL-SA sound chip (\"SA\" stands for \"Sound Blaster Architecture\"). In addition to Sound Blaster compatibility, it has Windows Sound System compatibility, kind of silly considering that this now-defunct standard eats up an IRQ for no good reason. The \"3D\" audio is not true positional 3D, but rather a stereo\"field-widener.\" In testing, the drivers seemed a bit unstable, though we encountered no problems with several Windows 95 games. But, using Windows 95s Media Player to play MIDI files would occasionally wreak havoc with the system-problems even included the dreaded \"Blue Screen o' Death.\" In DOS, both QUAKE and DUKE NUKEM 3D sounded good, although the digital audio in DOS games was a little muddy (this wasn't the case with native Windows 95 games). The 3D-XG supports only Sound Blaster Pro compatibility 10 16-bit audio in DOS (Windows audio is full 16-bit).

Pushing the stick left and right works as does any other joystick, with the fulcrum in the base. The stick twists left and right for yaw control as well, similar to the Sidewinder joysticks. But, instead of pushing the stick forward and backward to pitch up and down, the grip rotates forward provides the ability to adjust movement in one direction without affecting any other inputs. The one glaring omission is native DOS support, and this is my only gripe. Is this the future of joystick design? I'm not sure. But one thing is certain for many Win 95 games, I've got a new favorite joystick & by Greg Fortune \"he Thrustmaster Millennium 3D Inceptor (MBDI) is certainly the strangest joystick I've ever put my hands on. This is not due to any funky ergonomic design or strange multifunction base, but rather its unique approach to joystick motion. Modeled after the control sticks on the space shuttle, which have a gimbaled Y-axis, the M3DI is an accurate and versatile joystick First, the basics. The MBDI is a cligital Windows 95-only controller. If you want to run DOS games with this stick, you'll have to do it out of a DOS window under Win 95. It has six buttons (including the trigger), one four-way hat, and a throttle control. The buttons are completely mappable via the included software. Overall, the MBDI feels like a sturdly, well-built piece of equip. ment with a comfortable grip and wellplaced buttons. mounted wheel with your hand. In fact, there is no Y-axis motion at the base at all By having two separate movements for thexand yaxes, you gain accuracy. In a f light sim, there's no chance that you will inadvertently affect the vertical pitch of your plane when you push the stick over for a banking tum. This controller worked well for the games I tested it on, including JANE'S LONGBOW and US NAVY FICHIERS 97. The motion of the Millennium 3D Inceptor is easy to get used to and APPEAL: Win-95 gamers looking for a new twist in game control.

"****REVIEW  LOGITECH WINGMAN EXTREME DIGITAL WE To the Extreme TUTC) WINGMAN EXTREME DIGITAL HARDWARE by Jack Rodrigues isbuttons function only for games running under Windows 95. For DOS only games, the joystick emulates either the basic Thrustmaster FCS with the directional hat or the CH Flightstick Pro with a throttle. Despite a few glitches, the WingMan is a solid, easily programmed, inexpensive stick that's ideal for gamers on a budget. ogitechs latest offering the Wing Man Extreme Digital, has several distinguishing features: a comfortable (provided you're right-handSacd), molded contour grip, rubbercoated buttons, a throttle with a bulletshaped nub, and a weighted base (which gives the controller a solid feel). The best feature, however, is the easy to install (and use) Logitech Entertainment Control Center (LECC) software that is used to customize the Wing Man's buttons. After you attach the stick, the Wing Man's CD installs the LECC and adds an icon to the Windows 95 Control Panel. It's a quick process if you have AutoPlay enabled. There are 6 buttons that can be programmed (10, if you decide to reassign the four-way directional hat). Four are on the stick and two more are on the base unit. The LECC consists of two tabs: Game Setup and Joystick Setup. In Game Setup, you add a game and create a set of commands for it. In Joystick Setup, when you click on a game title the drop-down menu for each button displays the list of the commands you have created. Select an item on the menu list and it is assigned to that button. These settings are saved to disk. The last game settings you selected in the LECC panel will be assigned to the joystick and will remain in effect until you change them. You calibrate the joystick using the DirectX 5.0 Came Controller (which replaces the Joystick icon) in the Control Panel, though some games have their own calibration programs. Tlie WingMan holds calibration well after prolonged daily use. There is one sour note: The throttle can't be programmed and will function only if the game you're playing supports and recognizes it. I was able to get the CH Pro Pedals to function as a rudder in conjunction with the joystick in flight sims, but not as pedals in racing sims. WingMan's customized APPEAL: Gamers who want a programmable joystick that is flexible enough to work with most games. PROS: Inexpensive; comfortable grip with a weighted base and easyto-use software. >CONS: The throttle doesn't function in all games; customized buttons can't be used in DOS-only games; stick movement may be a bit stiff for some RATED **** gamers.

If your system meets all the right requirements and the phase of the moon is right, then this might be a good solution; otherwise, wait for the technology to mature a bit. & mehe lowly 1.44MB, 3.5-inch floppy disk drive has been the mainstay of removable storage in PCs since the Pleistocene era, or so it seems. I Recently, a couple of challengers have come along. First, Iomega arrived on the scene with the Zip Drive, a 100MB removable using a floppylike technology that's quite a bit faster. Shortly after that, the LS-120 arrived on the scene. The LS-120 uses magnetooptical media to deliver 120MB in a cartridge that looks remarkably like a standard 1.44MB floppy drive, and can also read and write to standard floppy disks This seems like a winning combination, but there are a few problems.

CH RACING WHEEL Get Your Motor Running HARDWARE by Greg Fortune H Products, a long-time maker of sturdy game controllers, has done it again. Its new CH Racing Wheel, an analog, fourbutton steering wheel, is just the licket for racingand driving-game enthusiasts who want to improve their lap times and still have a little cash left over for gas. Setup of the wheel is straightforward and painless. The wheel attaches to most flat table surfaces with a pair of suction cups and a pair of clamps. It took all of five minutes to connect, configure the Windows 95 Control Panel, and be up and running in INTERSTATE \"76. You can change between \"wheel only\" and \"wheel with pedals\" mode with a flick of a switch on the unit. Wheel-only mode sets the buttons on the back of the spokes to emulate the joystick x-axis movement, allowing speed control without taking your hands off the wheel. If you happen to have a set of rudder pedals, all four buttons on the wheel become available for functions mappable by your game. The Racing Wheel feels solid and doesn't exhibit any rattle or looseness in the steering column. One curious exception: There's no spring to center the wheel and provide resistance. The wheel doesn't suffer tremendously due to the absence of a resistance mechanism, but I did blow a couple of starts by not being centered when I«popped the clutch\" as the light turned green. And while the CH Racing Wheel is an analog device, it held calibration well. with no perceptible drift. The CH Racing Wheel is a solid controller that features easy installation, good performance, and a very reasonable price.

"JEDI KNIGHT REVIEW Students of the Force ACTION ne of the most eagerly anticipated features for JEDI KNIGHT is multiplayer gaming. We spent a few nights dueling with lightsabers, lasers, and force powers, and we liked it. While you can play deathmatch, teams, or capture-the-flag, multiplayer gaming really differs from other action games with the introduction of Force powers. Force Persuasion (invisibility) and Force Grip really change the dynamic of deathmatches, since you can now sneak up on deathmatchers or steal their weapons. The multiplayer feature not only gives us another reason to like JEDI KNIGHT, but also provides for some different and refreshing styles of deathmatching. around like headless yourself warned.

While it sounds as if Kain offers endless variety, the gameplay itself is numbingly repetitive. The enemies have only about four attack types, with simple movement patterns, and are differentiated by only minor cosmetic alterations. Traps involve little else aside from fireballs and spikes. With its overreliance on clichéd \"Find the switch\" puzzles, KAIN is unlikely to challenge even the most casual gamer with its problem solving The game's challenge, instead, comes principally from trying to withstand the constant onslaught of enemies. Kain has four primary weapons and four types of armor to help him weather the assaults, but his most effective weapons are the various spells and magic objects he acquires on his journey. These powerups can implode the bodies of his focs, reduce enemies to toxic pools of putrescence, shear their souls from their bodies, or just blow them up, among other things. You can also find power-ups that replenish mana and health (measured by a beaker of blood on the game screen), but Kain's best sources of blood are his victims and the captives he finds. In spite of the use of magic, hand-tohand combat is a constant in KAIN. Unfortunately, so are the unresponsive and cumbersome controls that complicate it. It often takes repeated mashings of gamepad buttons to get a response onscreen. Kain's hand-held weapons play more as ranged weapons, forcing you to 306 CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

"REVIEW BLOOD OMEN: LEGACY OF KAIN NOTI) V The Hidden City ower-ups and magic objects are the key to success in BLOOD OMEN: LEGACY OF Kain. While most secrets aren't too tough to locate and plunder, there's one that is deviously hidden. Since it holds about 25 percent of the game's total secrets, it's definitely worth the trip. After you get the Mist form, keep an eye on the moon phase. When you're creeping up on a full moon, change into Bat form and fly to the Bat Beacon near the cave where you first got the Mist form. You'll have to head west a bit, then south toward the water. Use a Repel spell to deal with the plants while you chop up the wolves. Don't cast spells to fight since you'll need lots of mana soon. When you reach the shore, turn into mist and walk west over the ocean-make sure you have plenty of magic power or your form will revert somewhere over the briny deep. Eventually you'll reach an island with a large Stonehenge-like structure on it. In the center of the standing stones is a teleporter that leads to the hidden city. The gates to the city won't open until the moon is full. Once it is, teleport over and pick up loads of goodies. By now you've got enough gameplay under your belt to deal easily with the obstacles in the city-the real challenge is to find the place. \"save posts» scattered stingily across the game world.

Afleet of evil alien spaceships is threatening the Earth. Things look grim, but there's a slim chance that one superhuman pilot, at the helm of a lone attack ship, might be able to infiltrate the alien fleet, destroy it, and save the Earth. Yes, you've been chosen to be that pilot. Sound a little banal? Cood. At least now you're prepared for TERRACIDE, a new first-person shooter from Eidos that's clearly trying, but failing, to be a better DESCENT. This time, the fight to save Earth takes place within the ships of an alien invasion fleet. Inside, you must battle your way through a small collection of legless robots, alien fighter ships, and gun turrets-fighting strong winds and gravity blocks, flipping switches, and exploring twisting corridorsuntil you face and vanquish the ultimate evil alien. You play a few levels within each ship, then escape into space and watch that ship explode, fight off a horde of alicn fighter craft, and then plunge into a conveniently open hatch on the next ship in line.

"TERRACIDE REVIEW Tips for Preventing TERRACIDE ACTION hear the sound of a bad guy warming up, and missiles or rockets would fly through the solid door to explode around me. I'd fire back, the door would open, and, sure enough, there was a bad guy shooting at me. Sometimes they wouldn't even wait for me to open the door-they'd just pop through like Casper I never managed to go through a closed door myself, but I did clip my way into several places I obviously wasn't supposed to. Once, I popped right through the wall and out into space. Speaking of those walls, I've got two words for TERRACIDE's designers: Tileable textures. The textures here look terrible. I can't figure it out. The developers have obviously gone to lots of trouble to exploit 3D hardware. There are options to tum different kinds of filtering on and off, to tweak texture quality, and so forth. And yet it looks bad on every setting. I ran TERRACIDE on a Pentium 133 with an Intergraph Reactor 100 card, using the Rendition Verite chipset,  Check your compass often, especially before entering tunnels, taking sidetracks into rooms, or going into unknown areas. W. Pay close attention to the color of the tunnels and doors as you pass through them. Color is often your only navigational cue.  Never be too proud to retreat at maximum speed, especially in the space battle segments. I completed one level with very low shields and was having trouble surviving the ensuing space battle. The secret turned out to be flying backward, away from the ship, at full throttle. The enemy fighters tend to cluster around the ship they're defending. If you stay close to the ship, they inevitably swarm you from behind. But if you fly backward, they come at you from the front, making themselves easy kills.  Crates, switches, shaft covers—if it's square, blast it. Some boxes are vitally important to destroy, some are indestructible, some conceal booty, and some make no difference, but I never found an instance in which destroying one proved fatal.  Draw your own maps. If you find yourself lost in the bowels of an alien battleship, circling the same corridors over and over, break out pen and paper and make a map. I did. The upside: A WENCHES.

"XCAR: EXPERIMENTAL RACING  REVIEW A Trip Down XCar's Pit Row SPORTS here's just one mechanical rule in XCAR's class of racing: If it makes the car go faster, do it. XCAR pulls no punches in the modification department, packing the most complete, if not imposing, setup of any racing game currently available. Admittedly, the physics behind your car's actions and reactions in the heat of battle aren't always perfect, but if you can live with the miscues, XCAR is a mechanic's paradise. Intricate? Take a gander at the \"aerodynamics\" section: You can choose from single or multiple wings at both front and rear before determining the length, width, and angle of each, and even the size of the endplate. Then, of course, you can fiddle with the underbody rake angle to further increase or decrease ground effects. Whew! Apart from aerodynamics, there are literally dozens of engine, fuel, gearing, braking, and suspension adjustments you can make-an amalgam of all that's complex in the genre's top titles. The steering section, with its numerous compensations for control devices and personal preferences, is a particularly good place to spend some time before moving elsewhere. The really good news is that XCAR drivers won't have to leave the testing grounds to audition their setups. No fewer than four test tracks (oval for top speed, drag strip for acceleration and braki ng, skid pad for cornering, and slalom for handling) will handle that for you. Are the results believable? Only a futurist would know for sure, LOAD SRVE but the telemetry and tech displays seem to remain consistent throughout the testing context. With a visual presentation nowhere near as sleek as that of say, GRAND PRIX II, the XCAR garage area won't win any aesthetics awards, but it will keep you busyvery busy. FOR SPEED II just isn't in the cards. My personal enjoyment was further hampered by sporadic audio dropouts, damageless accidents, graphic pop-throughs, extremely pixelated cars, and an only marginally attractive and very sexist championship celebration. Nevertheless, and despite all my whining, XCar does a number of things right. Engine notes are full, reverberating through tunnels and reaching lowely highs and lows. In-car options and tools are plentiful, including overhead minimaps, a hatcontrolled POV (forward, left, right, and behind), minor mechanical alterations without the fear of ultimate destruction around each bend. Although it isn't a full-bore sim in this mode, it's the next best thing and very enjoyable. XCAR: EXPERIMENTAL RACING valiantly attempts to go where few, if any, have sped before. It makes an interesting addition to any computer driver's library--if they fully understand its limitations beforehand. from within the cockpit, accurate rearview mirrors, and an on-the-windshield\" HUD crammed with information. Competitors are pretty smart, but not smart enough to react to you if you commit driving errors. Replays arc magnificent, with real-time readouts and telemetry, multiple perspectives, and all the periphery of an editing suite. Another thing XCAR does very well is graphically showcase your vehicles shortcomings and strengths in relation to those of your foes. I found myself in a three-lap race with one fellow, getting consistently outgunned through the same two sweeping corners while recapturing ground on the tight turns and the pair of straightaways. Considering all the factors of this event and the settings of my car, it made perfect sense, and I was able to remedy the situation later. Nice. APPEAL: Hard-core tinkerers and fanatical cyber-mechanics. Sim drivers who thought NASCAR RACING 2 was too easy and/or predictable Arcaderacing fans who want a new level of authenticity. PROS: Deep, really deep vehicle modification area, complete with test tracks and telemetry; loads of user options; multiple POV perspectives; sophisticated VCR component; truly \"fun\" to drive once realism has been detuned. >CONS: Driving model is just too hard and seemingly too wonky at full realism; most road courses are extremely narrow; rough-looking cars and occasional choppy graphics on anything other than a 3Dfx card. CATCHING AIR The XCAR physics model can do strange things at times-here, skidding a car airborne at just 37 mph. Fortunately, cranking down the realism seems to get rid of such oddities. AT THE FINISH The best part of XCAR comes when you've switched on the steering help, taken damage off, decreased the ability of your opponents, and loosened up a bit. Suddenly you can take pleasure in the thing and experience the wide varicty of the courses from oval to mountain rollercoaster and figure eight* DECEMBER 1997 CGW "

"REVIEW  MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL '98 SPORTS If you have an ear for football, you'll get a kick out of MNI's ambient sounds, which are dead-on. Air horns, crowd noise, referee whistles, crashing helmets, and grunts combine to add a large dollop of football flavor. Even the commentary of the broadcast crew seems improved, although Michaels occasionally states the yard line as the gain on the play. The special teams model also needs some additional practice time. Missed extra points are frequent, and the occasional kick returer fails to run after fielding the ball.

However, the depth at which MNF98 explores the strategic aspects of the NFL makes it seem more like this year's game of choice for serious pro football fans, rather than carpal tunnel bait for joystick jockeys. The innovative play-calling interface has been retained and enhanced from the original. This intuitive system takes a layered approach. Plays are selected from a menu box, which appears over the field options. Players can call the suggested play, or click to drop down a diagrammed listing of all plays in that category. Any play can be edited on the fly, which is the beauty of MNF '98. There is a problem with the included team playbooks, however. Their contents could have been matched better to the personalities of the clubs. For example, the Eagles employ a 4-3 defensive alignment, while the Panthers favor a 3-4. Yet all of the zone and combo plays included in both playbooks are 3-4s.

CONTROL ROOM This is the TV studio front end, where you set up your games. Say, is Berman wearing a clip-on? expect a crop of homegrown utilities to sprout on the Net. Knowledgeable NFL gamers will recognize that the rosters need some personal attention, as the default settings are incomplete at some positions. Johnny L. Wilson, Editor-in-Chief Computer Gaming World Magazine seemed to occur at unrealistically low frequencies. On the bright side, OT Sports has demonstrated a commendable responsiveness on the Internet, releasing a September patch that, in part, addressed problems with roster assignments, particularly on special teams. Gamers lacking the patch are likely to find linebackers returning kicks, and tackles kicking field goals. MNF '98 also earns high marks for first-class presentation. Inside the box you'll find a well-written, bound manual as well as an extra CD for head-to-head action.

It's also interesting to take a modern team back to the days of no facemasks, although I found that the modern teams throw the ball at will, even in the prehistoric era. The play editor in LEGENDS is fairly simple to use, but it's nothing new. MONDAY NIGHT FOCIBALL still has the best play-calling and audibles system, even though its a year old.

It was a great idea, had an ambitious design, and was produced by a company with a history of successful sports games (but one that lost sight of what it was that made their games a hit in the first place). Gamers always wonder why there are so few original designs. Perhaps it's because so many promising games are served up half-baked like this one. APPEAL: For football fans who prefer concept over execution. >PROS: Captures feel of running game; lets you pit NFL stars from different eras against each other.

"STARFLEET ACADEMY REVIEW the panacea of patches to get their games right SIMULATION/SPACE Where the individual ships really come into play, though, is in multiplayer action. There are four levels of Neo-Anarchy (deathmatch) play, each with various limitations on the sizes of ships you can choose. In addition, Galactic War puts you in a race between the Federation and Klingons to colonize opponents' planets by transporting ground crews down to the surface. Finally, the Net Profit game lets you do PRIVATEER-style missions, transporting items and scanning planets for profit, which you can then use to buy better ships. You can play it purely economic, or you can try to use your might to attack opponents before they grow wealthy enough to be a real threat The developers deserve kudos for including more than just deathmatch games herc-Net Profit is a blast if you have time for a long session. But a raspberry goes to the corporate folks at Interplay who apparently decided to leave TCP/IP support out in their own game of Net Profit.

While you can play the game from the command chair and jump from station to station to access peripheral functions, you'll probably want to choose the fullscreen tactical view, as it gives you all the vital information and access to the ship's functions from a single screen. The biggest problem here is lack of situational awareness. The main viewscreen and the tactical screen view in only one clirection---straight ahead.

"FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98  REVIEW You'll find the scenery and elevations have improved for the most part. The Rockies and the Grand Canyon look great, but the mountains around Sedona, Arizona, are pretty poor. Considering that the entire U.S. and much of the rest of the world is modeled, it's pretty impressive. Navigation aids such as VORs and NDBs are available, so you can use the included sectional maps for IFR flights. VOR ranges have been made more realistic, although some long-range VORs didn't seem to have enough range. A number of new adventures, challenges, and situations have been added, such as stunt-flying down the Las Vegas strip, for those who prefer structured goals in their flying. Multiplayer capability has returned to FLICHT SIMULATOR. (Older versions had direct-serial connection capability, but that feature disappeared long ago, along with the WWI game and built-in airplane designer.)

MISSING LINKS While there are many notable improvements hicre, there are other areas that should have been addressed before a major release. The biggest problems are the lack of air traffic control (ATC) simulation and of other intelligent aircraft. ATC is vital when you're really trying to learn all the procedures a private pilot must follow. (Canned ATC is included in the adventure files, but not normal flying.) Some airports do have other planes taking off and landing, and they're somewhat smarter now at least they won't taxi through you. However, what many of us would really like is re-creation of the crowded airspace and landing patterns of airports like DFW and ORD. Many long-standing quirks, such as the need to reset scenery density and dynamic scenery after loading a new terrain area, are still present. And there are some new quirks as well. When you play multiplayer on a system with a 3Dfx card, the chat window doesn't appear on the 3D screen; you're forced to use your system's pokey 2D card to display the game if you want to chat with your fellow pilots.

There are seven levels of altitude, and slopes that run from gentle to clifflike, with corresponding effects on movement and line of sight. The combat engine even factors in relative altitude to weapon ranges. When you combine this with terrain types— forests and rough ground that affect movement and sighling--you start to come close to a realistic combat environment. In fact, the only drawback to the terrain engine is that 2D effects just aren't enough to convey what is going on! Many gamers may have trouble interpreting the level changes through the sometimes too-subtle slope shadings. The units, while not stunningly original, have some nice twists, and the combat engine itself gives players an unprecedented level of control. While a tank is basically a tank and a foot soldier is a foot soldier, DR differentiates STRATEGY / WARGAMES MADE TO ORDER The many good features of DARK Reign include excellent terrain effects, a very slick interface, and customizable AI. And while it is an unoriginal game out of the box, there is more to DARK REICN if you are willing to put in a little time and effort. PANDORA'S TOOLBOX The first thing you'll notice is that the terrain here is not just for cosmetics. Of late, there has been a trend in the real The New Real-time Standard finapped with Hyperlinapok www com Terra ith the recent rush of titles in the C&C mold, it has become apparent that the genre has evolved from its origins somewhat, and that what was acceptable (or even admirable) a year and a half ago just isn't good enough anymore. The first major development involves terrain. No longer is it enough for terrain to be a pretty rug to drive your units over, with the occasional impassable icon. Games like ENEMY NATIONS, and, in a more primitive form, KKND, began to introduce the concepts of altitude and cover into the formula. Now it's pretty much a given that top-line games like DARK REIGN, TOTAL ANNIHILATION, or CONQUEST EARTH make allowances for altitude, ground cover, and line of sight in one way or another. Even the passing of night and day is being modeled in games like DARK COLONY and OUTPOST2. In fact, things have progressed so far that I suspect DARK REIGN will represent the pinnacle of 2D terrain in the genre. There just SUCCEMENO doesn't seem to be anywhere FAITEET else to go, unless you switch to a full 3D engine. Another absolute requirement seems to be a waypoint system of some kind or another. It will no longer cut it to force gamers to watch their units pick their way across deadly battlefields at the whim of some dizzy movement Al, which treats deadly defensive turrets like rock gardens. Now you have to be able WHAT DOES IT TAKE? With the bar now raised, games to move units, either singly or in need scenario editors, better interfaces, and more terrain a set formation, exactly where influences to stay alive in this crowded field. and how you want them to go.

Natural resources must travel over your internal transportation network or overseas via traders. STRATEGY / WARGAMES or by giving it huge advantages in materiel, money, or whatever. For the most part, IMPERIALISM puts you into a light situation by having you experience the problems that arise from the struggles of great powers. If you are at a disadvantage, it's usually through something subtle, like diplomatic isolation, rather than a decreased cash flow. The result is a tightly rum contest, particularly at the higher levels of difficulty, that should give even jaded professionals a run for their money. GAME MECHANICS Gamers looking for a beer-andpretzels-type game may want to look elsewhere: IMPERIALISM is complicatcd. A careful reading of the manual is necessary, and even then you'll likely have to play a few complete games to master the system. In my opinion, this is a good thing The game's complexity is neither mind HOW TO RUN AN EMPIRE To be successful you have to build an economy that functions smoothly and provides you with the finished goods necessary to fund large diplomatic and military efforts. As few countries are blessed with all of the necessary resources, you will have to trade with the outside world to get what you need. In a typical tum you might begin by giving orders to your railroad system, perhaps reducing the amount of timber il carries in order to make more room for coal and iron. You might then order a prospector to investigate a mountainous square for resources, direct a miner to upgrade a mine, and have a farmer improve the efficiency of your food supply. furniture, railroads, ships, or newer and better industrial facilities. After attending to your industry, you might reallocate trade priorities. You can offer goods for sale and make bids on goods from other powers, major or minor. Using diplomacy, you can guarantee the supply of vital resources by engineering trade concessions and by ensuring that supplying countries remain friendly. Ultimately, you should be able to entice minor powers to join your empire, although this takes a lot of time, trade, and money. Having finished all of the peaceful aspects of imperial management, you may want to move an army to any of your bordering provinces that look weak or to a colony that is threatened by another great power. If you are at war, you might decide to invade an enemy territory Combat is played out on a tactical map. The computer is surprisingly able in tactical combat, particularly on the defensive.

There's an awful lot to do each tum, and it may take many turns before you reach a position of great power. If you don't secure an alliance early you probably won't survive the first few tums, but if you ally with the wrong power you won't survive the middle game.

"**** REVIEW OUTPOST 2: DIVIDED DESTINY DIFFICULTY LEVEL Redemption STRATEGY / WARGAMES Sierra Clears the OUTPOST Name With a Complete—and Finished-Sequel by Martin E. Cirulis side) to identify the problem and then find a way to build a starship to escape. This is an interesting premise for conflict, but nowhere near as interesting as it could have been. Instead of deciding the fate of a world and the philosophical direction of our entire species, you spend most of your time rushing around like someone 15 minutes late for a dental appointment. here was a time when the name OUIPOST brought either shudders or gales of laughter from most computer gamers, depending on whether they were in the group who had wasted money on the title or the group who hadn't. One has to give Sierra credit for some serious chutzpah for bringing out a sequel to a game that only recently was knocked out of first place in the \"Most Bungled Game\" category by Take 2's BATILECRUISER 3000. Despite my personal feelings toward the original game, when the glossy box for OUTPOST 2: DIVIDED DESTINY crossed my desk, I took a deep breath, repeated my\"I will be impartial\" mantra a few times, and cautiously installed this born-again strate egy game. I'm not sure whether it was because of this games ancestry or its combination of gaming styles, but OUTPOST 2 has elicited more contradictory reactions from me than any other game in recent memory. Terraformers, centered at base camp Eden, who believe New Terra should live up to its name as quickly as possible-at any price; and a group who believe that the time for humanity to ravage nature has ended, and that mankind should adapt to the new world, instead of the other way around. Now this is truly an interesting conflict for a sci-fi game. While I am not quite sure if people would be willing to start a shooting war over an argument like this when there are only a few hundred humans left in the universe, the game does have the air of serious science fiction, and it seems to hark back to Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy, in which Terraformers and Environmentalists were locked in a strug. gle for the future of a world. Unfortunately, as I began to play through the two campaigns, I was disappointed to find this potentially rich backdrop reduced to a conflict in which the Terraformers accidentally release a virus that breaks down the entire surface of New Terra. The campaigns become a race (against both time and the other GUNS AND BUTTER B ut my disappointment edged back toward pleasure when the full impact of the games mechanics made itself known. Instead of chucking out everything except the name OUTPOST and just creating another Build-a-base, Buildan-army clone, the designers bravely tried to retain as much of what was good about the original game as possible, while still delivering solid real-time combat. Yes, you do build up armics of velicles that destroy each other in graphically satisfying ways, but the whole basebuilding portion of the game is much more intrinsic to the scenarios than is the norm for the genre.

"***** REVIEW  BIRTHRIGHT: THE GORGON'S ALLIANCE DIFFICULTY LEVEL Still Birth? STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Sierra's First AD&D Venture Tries To Be Everything, But Can't EN CERDOSEACHASE by Gavin Hachiya Wasserman h, for a Quest! Smite the foes. Unite the realm. Triumph over the malevolent hordes of the avatar of evil Sound familiar? Sierra's BIRTHRICHT: THE GORCON'S ALLIANCE hopes to renew our hunger for all things medieval and fantastic, and to usher in a new generation of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons games. Combining a jumble of strategy and role-playing elements (including turn-based grand strategy, realtime wargaming, and first-person dungeon romps), Sierras game challenges players to manage and marshal the forces of one of the 34 kingdoms squabbling over the fallen empire of Anuire. Each warring power is governed by a regent of ancient lincage, and the blood flowing through these men and women is rich with mystical power. Unfortunately for them, the same divine birthright that fuels their quest for glory also makes them the natural prey of the Gorgon, an ancient creature whose power and corrupting influence are only matched by his hunger for blood. Baruk-Azhik's turn AER CLUTTERED KINGDOM BIRTHRIGHT is a game with equal parts role-playing and strategy. It is incredibly complicated, and it's not for the micro-management challenged, Price: $29.95 Minimum System Requirements: Pentium 75 (P100 recommended), 8MB RAM (32MB recommended), Win 95 or MS DOS 5.0. 30MB hard drive space, SVGA graphics, 4x CDROM, Sound Blastercompatible sound cards, mouse.

Bellevue, WA (800) 757-7707 (sales) www.sierra.com Reader Service #: 348 TREAD LIGHTLY Excited? Ready to take on evil in all its many forms? Hold on a minute. GORGON'S ALLIANCE ambitiously tries to meld two games, keeping as close to its AD&D roots as possible, while hunting that familiar sweet spot in strategy gamers that keeps them up and blinking into the gray of dawn. Unfortunately, despite its great potential, BIRTHRICHT doesn't quite get it all right. The adventuring part of the game is intuitive enough. Anyone who's been in front of a computer in the last few years will feel right at home exploring castles, haunted temples, and dank dungeons with a HEXEN/QUAKE-type, first-person view. You run, jump, duck, slide left and right, and yes, push buttons and open secret doors galore. Picking up items, however, requires a little bit of mouse dexterity as well as excellent powers of observation. It is very difficult to point and click on tiny objects such as rings and keys that are just barely visible on the floor. The exploration is fun. Hunting sccrct passages and fabulous magic items is a game in itself. Puzzles of finding keys blundering through illusionary walls, and dodging traps are pretty much familiar features. With no time limit, it's easy to get caught up in trying to find every little object (everything from potions to wooden plates). It would be pack-rat heaven if you could just pay no attention to the other party members staring sternly at you each time you turn around and switch directions. All they do is trail you as if they were pixelated lemmings. They'll literally follow you over a cliff. At least, until you enter into combat Instead of cloning HEXEN for seamlessly integrated exploration and combat, Sierra tried to stay true to the AD&D dice-dominated combat system. When the party encounters monsters, music begins and the game goes completely awry. Whereas one minute ago you had complete control of mobility and actions, suddenly you're a passenger with the less than thrilling position of choosing between general attack types. The combatants (lemmings, et al.) swing their weapons again and again, making grunting noises and clinking sounds. After the initial novelly wears off, it becomes apparent that there is no arcade feel, no reflexes are necessary, and no excitement is generated. Combat is wholly a funct ion of to-hit percentages and damage potential. Unfortunately, while friends at a Fritos-littered table can make percentages interesting to themselves (\"Yessss! A natural 201 Diclya see it?\"), the spastic acrobics of the computer combatants are merely a poorly-disguised means to an end: Just kill the monsters and keep looking for stuff. And given that you don't start with weak characters, (you can hire 9 th level and higher warriors), most of the monsters in the adventures are just speed bumps on the road to loot. COMMANDING CONQUERORS In contrast, the strategy part of the game is neither casy nor quick, even at DECEMBER 1997 "

"REVIEW  BIRTHRIGHT: THE GORGON'S ALLIANCE «Bugs\" or Quirks in the Kingdom STRATEGYZWARGAMES Units on the map aren't too bright when you try to tell them where to move. Unless a unit has a perfectly unobstructed, straight path to its destination, it will probably blunder off in the wrong direction. Aim a unit at a southwestern province and it may head first south, then southeast, then stop when it runs into a neutral territory it can't cross. Some adventure scenarios involve passing into different dungeon levels, during which time the game resets your marching orders to the default and cancels all your memorized spells. Also, if you clear one level of the scenario, move to another level, and then come back, you'll find the entire level reset, with all the dead monsters alive again, all the doors closed, and all the treasure chests refilled with the exact same items you plundered just a moment ago (finding two Rods of Resurrection just isn't right). In the adventure combats, mages, wands of fire (or frost), and necklaces of missiles are practically useless. A mage's fireball will not kill even a single guard. On the other hand, in tactical combat, the same mage can cast fireballs at a whole squad of elite infantry and cut down at least half of them. Likewise, priests' Turn Undead power hardly phases zombies and skeletons in dungeons, but saves the day on the battlefield, when all else falls against those undead. While Fighters are practically Fa unstoppable in adventure combat, they lose out in strategic combat. Guard your favorite warrior well; he may be able to single-handedly slay entire legions of heavily armed ogres in a dungeon, but could falter against raw recruits. If you get 4:1 numerical supeU riority in the strategic combat, you win the battle. If you muster four weak archer groups against the Gorgon, the big bad boy has to turn tail and flee, even though he could singlehandedly finish them all off like chicken strips. the easiest setting.

Since we last visited the subject in our February cover story, Westwood has been refining the gameplay and stability of the game. Beta tests are winding down for this game, but I managed to jump on and play a few rounds. It's a fast game that features a continuous cycle of dying, respawning, and wreaking havoc. There is no pretense of strategy, though you will employ whatever strategies you normally use in action games. You won't be able to camp near power-ups, though, because they respawn at random locations throughout the game world (this was premeditated). The final product is nearing completion, and should be in stores by Christmas. Pricing is still to be determined, though you will buy the game at retail. To play, you'll connect to Westwood Chat. However, Westwood is talking to several gaming services about hosting SOLE SURVIVOR games. For more information on the game, visit their Web site at www.westwood.com Sony Interactive's TANARUS is a title that I've only played briefly. It's a messy killfest, much like the Namco arcade game TOKYO WARS, in which you blast at enemy tanks and maneuver around different terrain. The game supports the 3Dfx Voodoo chipset for some nice graphics that are a marked improvement over the usual online fare. The game also has day and night missions and a variety of different locales to play within, including snow and urban terrain.

SOFT FUTURES World War II sims will make a strong comeback, eclipsing jet simulations in popularity (once pilots newer to flight sims discover the joy of dogfighting at close range). The first real Korean War simulations will please many aviation buffs, but they're likely to remain a niche product. The next big bandwagon will be Vietnam War sims, after game company marketing weenies notice the interest in Virgin/Eagle Interactive's PHANTOM ACE 1F-22's design.

The Imperial Japanese Navy and Army — in a series of boldly executed amphibious assaults-had successfully invaded the Philippines, Malaya, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Hong Kong, Guam, and Wake Island, and were greedily eyeing lands beyond. By midyear, Japanese forces were poised to assail both India and Australia, two important member nations of the British Commonwealth, and the specter of a Japanese invasion of the continental United States became a frightening possibility: To remove any potential counterstrike by the lax Allies, the Japanese had launched a preemptive carrier-born aerial bombardlment against both the Philippines and the Hawaiian Islands, which laid to waste much of the American surface fleet moored in Pearl Harbor, as well as several hundred land-based combat aircraft neatly parked at nearby airfields. 'The Allies, hard-pressed to respond until sufficient forces could again be brought to bear, had little choice but to remain on the defensive throughout the early stages of the war. To stymie any further Japanese expansion plans, American forces braced themselves for the next onslaught, coupling whatever military assets were at hand with invaluable information obtained from Japanese radio messages intercepted and broken by the Magic decoding device. their determination and resolve proved decisive. Within a year's time, the fortunes of war would radically shift; this time irreversibly swinging in favor of the Allics. Two battles-one waged in the skies near the tiny island of Midway; the other, in the tropical swamps and jungles of Guadalcanal-would forever alter the balance of power in the Pacific. The outcome of these climactic engagements would set the tone and momentum of military operations for the rest of the conflict. This month's article deals with ways to achieve a decisive victory in the Midway scenario of PACIFIC GENERAL. Next month, we'll get down and dirty on the island of Gualdalcanal, one of the most bitterly contested campaigns of WWII. As the U.S. player, you are hard-pressed to repeat what your historical counterpart achieved. First, the preliminary victory point score is lopsided, weighing heavily in favor of the Japanese player (US: 0, Japanese: 356). Second, you have just 10 turns to locate, intercept, and, most importantly, sink at least four of the five Japanese aircraft carriers, which are protected by a screen of powerful warships and several squadrons of capable enemy fighters. Third, be mindful of the fact that the Japanese player is charged with occupying Midway; therefore, you must prevent his naval forces from moving adjacent to the island, while simultaneously minimizing your own losses. OOO PRELUDE TO BATTLE Japanese and American air forces (shown above) converge to deliver the fatal hammer blows. As the aerial storm gathers in intensity, so too does the action below. The strategic map to the right shows initial dispositions for each side's naval forces. CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

"GAMER'S EDGE L STRATEGY & TIPS: PACIFIC GENERAL None But the Brave 1 0 skies near M merican and Japanese air forces mix it up in the skies near Midway. Navy F4F Wildcats initially flying CAP are ordered to join up with other aircraft already heading westward from the carrier groups. Instead of probing the airspace beyond, they loiter along a north-south axis until land-based aircraft, dispatched from Midway, can form the southern shoulder of the immense air armada 10 The trap (shown below), baited with a single PBY, Iures several nearby A6M Zeros further eastward. This ambush strips the Japanese bomber squadrons of fighter protection. Meanwhile, the PBY has a fair to moderate chance of surviving the air attack and can then be withdrawn until it's safe to return. Instead of retiring to safety, Japanese bombers and torpedo planes will attempt to home in on their reconnaissance aircraft. They will then attempt to penetrate the American aerial screen, only to meet their swift demise. The reconnaissance aircraft can be dealt with later on, once the U.S. fighters are free to roam at will. On the second American turn (shown at bottom), the feeding frenzy begins. Both Marine and Navy Wildcats take up positions ahead of the hapless Zeros, while the less lethal but sturdier P-40 Warhawks get in their licks on the flanks. The Warhawks possess a slightly higher air defense value than the Wildcats, and are therefore less susceptible to enemy air-to-air fire during the inevitable Japanese counterattack. On turn three, aircraft are brought up along both flanks, surrounding the remaining Japanese air squadrons. Once their fighter escorts go down, the Japanese tac bombers have no place to go. Don't be afraid to use your own bombers, PBY Catalinas, and tac bombers to surround the enemy's tac bombers, thereby preventing them from fleeing the scene until your fighters are free to resume their mauling. Eltfel fuel surface, trading speed for stealth and striking power. As the battle unfolds, concentrate on destroying the Japanese fighter aircraft, then their cruisers and destroyers, and, finally, their tactical bombers and carriers. Since capital ships, including carriers, can be struck by critical hits, it may be wiser to simultaneously attack several carriers instead of finishing them off, one by one. Critical hits can, among other things, drastically reduce the carrier's movement allowance, permitting other aircraft to catch up with the fleeing vessel. Whenever possible, fly one of your aircraft (even those that have fired) into the same hex as the enemy carriers. This prevents the carrier from recovering their own aircraft unless they move to a new location. Finally, even aircraft carriers can inflict damage upon other ships, including carriers. If all else fails, move one of your carriers adjacent to his and blaze away. Although this is unrealistic, you should be pleasantly surprised by the results. Don't bother purchasing new air units, since they arrive on Midway, far removed from the action occurring to the west. In similar fashion, it doesn't pay to replace returning battered fighters unless they're still sorely needed at the front. After all, units automatically receive replacements between scenarios. Instead, husband those valuable prestige points, since they'll come in handy further into the campaign. When you mass for the attack on the Japanese carriers, use your Tactical bombers first to soften up the target, then use the torpedo planes to finish them off. Fortunately, it's far too early in the war for the Japanese kamikaze suicide aircraft to respond in kind. lalalalalalal Philol:10 EL 10 lalalalalala le 1 lloje la = { et eleful 10 CGW DECEMBER 1997 "

This month we look at the theories behind missile combat, and then apply those theories to SSIS Su-27 PLANKER 1.5. Contrary to popular opinion, missile combat isn't a long-range, push-button, one-shot, one-kill affair. This misperception has been reinforced by footage from the TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT If you were to fire a missile at this range, you'd take damage when the Culf War and by computer games that warhead detonated. have vastly oversimplified missile launch procedures. Very few sims on the market today actually contain realistic missile performance.

This baseline, called kinematic range, specifies how far cvading themproperly. Some flighit sims give missiles ridiculously the missile can fly before decelerating below Mach 1.0.

Re member those math problems about different ON TARGET A close-in missile shot can be almost impossible to evade, as trains leaving this F-15 learns. different cities? Although less necessarily limited in size and weight, carry a militaristic, those math exercises describe the finite amount of fuel.

Therefore, citing an range. The missile begins its flight at roughly AMRAAMs range as 20,30, or 40 nautical miles the same speed as the launcher, accelerates to deally, missiles would strike their targets dead center every time. In the real world, though, this doesn't usually happen. As one industry insider put it, \"They're called MISS-iles instead of HITiles for a reason!\" Generally, a missile makes a series of course corrections en route to its target, trying to keep the target in its forward field of view. The target, meanwhile, will usually be trying to evade the missile. The target may also employ electronic countermeasures (ECM) to confuse the missile. ECM doesn't usually cause missiles to veer off in the wrong direction; rather, it causes the missile to misjudge the target's position and to miss by a slightly greater distance. Consequently, a missile is designed explode when it detects that it has gotten as close to the target as it is going to get. Missile warheads are designed from a variety of materials designed to damage targets in the immediate vicinity. Some warheads basically propel a cloud of shrapnel into the air, others fire an expanding ring of iron rods. Although some warhead types are more effective against certain types of targets, they all use the same principle: Increase the lethal area around the missile until it intersects the target The Su-27 keeps the missile off its wing, pulling high g's as the missile nears.

The farther a missile has to fly, the less energy it will have available for maneuvering when it reaches the target, since it decelerates as it flies. And the missile's being able to maneuver during the endgame is crucial, because targets rarely fly straight and level. At maximum range, the missile may easily run down a slow bomber that's lumbering in a gentle, 2g turn; however, it probably can't catch a nimble fighter pulling a 9g break turn. Just because the target is within the missile's range doesn't mean the missile can actually intercept the target when it gets there. The moral of the story: Always minimize range-to-target as much as is practical before launching the weapon. Missile designers assume the missile needs to be able to pull three to four times the targets g-load; that is, if the target can pull Og's, the missile needs a 27g to 36g capability. A missile with extremely high-g abilities subsequently offers numcrous benefits. First, the missile can engage high-g targets at a longer range. Secondly, and possibly more important, the missile can pull substantially more g's early in the encounter, letting it engage targets farther off the launcher's nose. This \"over-the-shoulder\" capability of missiles like the R-73 in Su-27 FLANKER gives pilots the ability to engage targets that would normally be safely out of the way. Equipped with such modern weapons, fighters in situations that in the past would have been classified as «neutral\" or even \"defensive\" can now maintain \"offensive» postures. The old adage, \"If he's pointed at you then he's offensive; if he's pointed away from you then he's defensive\" doesn't hold true in the world of over-theshoulder missiles. Keep these concepts in mind as you go into a missile fight and you'll be far better equipped to know when you'll be able to score a hit. On the following pages are some specific tips on applying these concepts to SSI's Su-27 FLANKER Xperience Nine G's at your desk! USING R-73 MISSILES FOR OFFBORESIGHT ATTACKS 1 First, switch to SHLEM (helmet-mounted sight) mode. 2 Padlock your target. Acquire a radar or EOS lock on the target. 3 Fire!

The missile's average speed and therefore how far it flies in a given amount of time) varies depending on its initial speed. The faster the initial speed, the quicker the missile reaches and maintains maximum speed, and the greater its average speed for the total time of flight.

The farther the missile flies, the less energy it has. Even potent missiles like the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the R-77 (AA-12) Adder face range limitations. As a general rule, the closer the target, the greater the chance the missile will hit. iF422 LOSE SIGHT, LOSE THE FIGHT Use the padlock view to keep an eye on the target. CREE MAP The Right Range How close is close enough? Keep in mind that missiles have minimum ranges, so you can get too close. Missile warheads are designed with a fairly large \"lethal radius.\" TO ensure the launching aircraft isn't accidentally caught in that blast, missiles have to fly some distance before the warhead can be armed. This distance is known as the minimum launch range. The target must be at least that far away from the launcher, or the launcher risks taking damage when the missile detonates. Obviously, restricting missiles to their minimum launch ranges seriously underutilizes them. As a rule, therefore, minimize launch range as much as practical before firing, but don't miss your chance to get the first shot in WAKE The AIM-120: D curate Realism that's off the chart ike other military hardware devel 1992, missed its target in the Iraqi oped in the past two decades, the Northern No-Fly Zone.

"GAMER'S EDGE ADVENTURE/RPG HINTS Scorpia's Mail Don't Fall on Your Dagger! Scorpia's Here To Chase Those Shivers Away! ell, we're hitting the Christmas rush season, and I hope we'll be seeing some good games this year. We sure could use a few, especially RPGs. While we wait to see what Santa has in store, though, keep the questions coming on those older games just make sure to enclose that self-addressed stamped envelope if you want a response. Daggerfall A lot of people write to me about problems with lycanthropy. It's not a great state to be in, and you're better off avoiding it entirely by restoring the game if a werecritter takes a few chunks out of you. For those already afflicted, there's not much you can do about it. To stay healthy, you'll just have to go hunting now and then, and wait until the werewolf hunters show up with their proposition (sometime in the year following your infection). Even if you're not a mage type, look in your spellbook for a special spell that allows for the werecritter transformation at your discretion (many players don't notice this one). Diablo There isn't much that's puzzling about the game, but some players have trouble with the big finale. Diablo is very susceptible to Holy Bolts. So, after opening the door to Diablo's room, just go partway toward it, and start chucking the Bolts in there; they affect only him. When you get a hit, duck back into the two-lever room and around a wall, and wait. He'll be with you shortly (grin). This way, you get him out and don't have to fight all the friends he has with him in the room. You just have to worry about killing him before he gets you. game; foreknowledge can be dangerous sometimes. In any case, visit the home of a pirate or two and the action should start to pick up pretty quickly in a short while. Shivers II The bees in the closet of Burt's Trailer can be a problem. You won't be able to do much about them until after you've managed to get down into the mines, which first requires a fair amount of work in the gas station (and a few other places, too). Once in the mines, you'll find what you need to get rid of the bees. Betrayal in Antara You may find that ANTARA crashes when you try to go from Chapter Eight to Chapter Nine. It apparently has something to do with certain actions back in Chapter Five. The only way around this is to obtain the patch (www.sierra.com). Fable While this game isn't especially difficult, it shoes have tricky spots. One is just at the point where you drop down to visit the Engulfed Fortress. You have a conversation with some seahorses, and at the end of it, one of them should give you an item. If you don't receive it, restore the game and try the conversation again (you'll most likely have to save before jumping in, as the seahorses show up pretty quickly). Without the item, you won't be able to finish this section (or the game, for that matter). & Reach Scorpia at B ate Shiri Whetene William anl a long the deel the whetstone.

"TIPS! Sports Strategy/Wargames PACIFIC GENERAL in a departure of sorts, a victory point system has been implemented in PACIFIC GENERAL that tabulates the score and outcome of each scenario. The revised system calculates victory based upon the turn-by-turn ownership of certain key objectives while factoring in the number and type of casualties each side has inflicted and suffered. A decisive victory is achieved if your final victory point tally equals or exceeds a 3:2 ratio over your opponent's score. Likewise, marginal victories are attained if your victory point score melts to a paltry 5:4 ratio, while lower ratios are considered an outright defeat. Even though you may be able to fulfill the requisite objectives set out at the scenario's inception, it is entirely possible to relinquish a decisive victory or potentially concede defeat if your losses far outweigh the results you've achieved on the battlefield. As an all-important secondary objective, you must continually strive to eliminate as many enemy combat units as possible while minimizing your own losses, especially higher-value naval and air units and core formations. FRONT PAGE SPORTS: BASEBALL PRO '98 OUR TOP SIX TIPS 1. Don't throw anything but strikes. Unlike real baseball players, the computer players won't swing at anything out of the strike zone, even when you're ahead in the count and it should be swinging clefensively at borderline pitches. 2. Don't bother trying to throw out basestealers. Even when the ball beats the runner to the bag by four steps the computer player will be safe. Throwing the ball makes you vulnerable to possible throwing crtors: Swallow hard, ignore the runner, and focus on getting the batter out 3. Don't try to field manually. The interface is clumsy and awkward; the computer player will run around the bases while you struggle to get the ball out of your glove. 4. Don't keep so-so fielders on the field late in a close game when you're letting the computer do your fielding. FPS: BASEBALL PRO '98 sports a fielding model that has Gold Glove-winning centerfielder Steve Finley not charging a slow roller to center -thereby allowing a slow runner to score from first--so you're going to need your best gloves to make sure errors don't compound gaffes made by the boneheaded AI. 5. Don't make trades with other league players based on a pending trade with a computer-controlled team. While putting a player on the trading block may draw offers from other teams, the computer CMs may inexplicably decide against following through and kill the trade (they'll even offer and kill the same trade every day for the duration of the season). So wait before pulling the trigger on other trades that depend on your getting a player from a computer team. 6. Don't expect All-Stars to perform as they do in real life. Stats in this game frequently bear little resemblance to a player's ability in the real world. If Tony Gwynn is barely hitting 200 (it will happen), don't feel guilty about benching, tradling, or demoting him-chances are, he won't make a comeback.

"TIPS! Simulations/Space Puzzles/Classics FLIGHT SIM 95/PRO CONTROLLER ne of the worst omissions in MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR FOR WINDOWS 95 (and FLICHT SIMULATOR 98, for that matter) was the lack of air traffic control (ATC). One of the most innovative add-ons yet for the venerable civilian simulator addresses just that problem, and adds a multiplayer element to boot. The Squawkbox system, by Jason Crooms, gives FLIGHT SIMULATOR 95 full ATC by connecting to an Internet server. On the other side of the connection are a group of users running Grooms' PRO CONTROLLER, an air traffic control sim. On a good night there FLIGHT Sim 95 running Squawkbox UOGIS GUBBLE 1. The different fasteners Gubble has to remove take different amounts of time to unfasten. Pulling a nail with a hammer is almost instantaneous, but drilling a rivet takes a few seconds. You've got to take those extra seconds into account when planning your path and your timing, 2. You can avoid most of the monsters simply by flying above them or planting a tool in their path. What you really have to watch out for are the land mines, especially when Gubble is moving at high speed and precise timing is required in order to execute a tum. 3. Gubble can not only hover, but he can also move while flying. Hovering is enough to repel a monster, but you're making the NB 1243G (1) 66 13 are enough controllers active that you can fly a controlled flight from LA to Chicago. You won't actually see other aircraft, but you can communicate with other players using Squawkbox.

The worst thing you can do is accidentally drop a tool you still need in such a way as to trap a monster in a tight dead end. The monster will start pacing back and forth quickly, and if the clistance is short enough, it can be impossible to pick the tool up again without getting knocked off when the monster completes its circuit. 5. Tum off the sound. The frenetic music and garbled alien speech encourage you to approach GUBBLE as an every-second-counts action game when it's actually a puzzle game. Ignore the timer, put on some relaxing jazz, and think your way through each level. Would you do a crossword puzzle holding a stopwatch and listening to The Flight of the Bumblebee? CHECH 0:56.

"MARTIN CIRULIS whatiwor, What's the Deal man With...Game Reviews? mitigated by some universally agreed-upon frame of reference. Personal taste is not enough to base an entire review upon. A bad interface is a bad interface, regardless of how you \"feel\" about a game. The problem with chalking up a \"bad\" review to simple opinion is that opinion is too slippery for anybody to get a handle on. Glossing over any couple of weeks ago, I found myself in calm debate with an erstwhile colleague over the nature of this wacky world of game reviewing. Specifically, we were wrestling over the eternal question: What makes for a bad review? By this, we mean a review that is \"bad\" as in a job poorly done by the reviewer, as opposed to a job poorly done by the game designer. A one-star review of a game is still \"good\" if the game is really a one star game. While nothing much was resolved, the discussion did manage to boil down to a single issue that might be actually relevant: How much of a game review should be about concrete facts, and how much is just a matter of opinion? Superficially, this seems like a hairsplitting kind of issue, but if you take a moment to think about it, the entire accountability of gaming mags-not to mention the individual writers, hangs on it. It's an issue that's black and white and gray all over There can be no doubt that review ers have their own opinions, and how a game strikes you is a matter of personal taste in many ways. Taste is a wonderful thing, but often it leaves a little logic to be desired; and so, while the reviewer's personal opinion is always a part of a review, it has to be ( There can be no doubt that reviewers have their own opinions. which a review is judged experience with the industry, with software and games in general, or with the subject matter of the game. Whether a review is \"Right\" or \"Wrong\" is not an issue of its star rating. The gray area of personal opinion can account for the fact that one reviewer thought M.A.X. was worth 3.5 stars, and another gave it 4. On the other hand, the sane among us can safely agree that any reviewer giving BC3000 4.5 stars is slightly mistaken. A very good review of a very lousy game is a prob. lem of fact, not opinion. If a reviewer personally thinks the potential of BC3000 is worth the price of admission, then they are more than welcome to mention it in the body of a review. But alongside of that, you have to mention that the game doesn't work out of the box, and that installing the first generation of patches is only slightly less difficult than fixing the Mir space station. The reader can then decide what's more important to them. Hell, I loved playing MACHIAVELLI with friends, but that doesn't mean I should have ignored ils weak Al, dated graphics, and dryer-than-average combat model when reviewing it. Downgrading a game's rating due to personal issues is also a problem. Is it relevant to dock DIABLO points for not being enough of an RPG, even though it was obviously meant to be more like Rogue than ULTIMA? Should PANZER GENERAL be punished for not being a rigorously realistic WWII battlefield simulation, when it was obviously designed as a beerand-pretzels wargame? Again, these \"facts\" can, and should be men. tioned in the body of a review, but when it comes down to the dreaded rating, a reviewer's opinion on such matters has to come second, behind the reality of the game in front of him. The reviewer may have wanted to talk to townspeople, or have yet another hard-core WWII recreation, but c'est la vie. The real issue is this: Is the game doing what it was meant to do? It goes without saying that rating systems of any kind are the bane of any well-thought-out critique, but the fact is, we are stuck with them because readers want them. So when the subtle balance of fact and opinion in a game review comes down to some inane percentage or number of icons, it's more important than ever to give the consumer something they can hang onto. In return, the consumer has to respect the reviewer as well by actually reading an article and understanding where the rating is com. ing from. If there is still a problem after carefully reading the piece and taking into account the \"half-star give or take\" taste rule, then the real argument over the review's accuracy can begin. hard facts or denying a firm frame of reference leaves the consumer paying for a lot of pages of ads and words that have no more critical rele. vance than asking your butcher or mailman if they think you should buy DAGGERFALL or MIGHT AND MAGIC VI. \"It's just my opinion\" might be good enough for nutty columns like this one, but reviews need to contain a little more real information.
