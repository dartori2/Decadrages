"Play MYST-y for Me Surprise: Many RIVEN Buyers Play Other Games, Too n exceedingly rare occasions (hang on while I remove the glossal member from the inside of my cheek), those of us privileged to expostulate and pontificate within the media may overstate our positions. This probably isn't surprising to those of you who know about my MYST bias. My original assertion about the game was, \"I don't think you'll lose any money on it. I just hope you're not counting on a big hit.\" Okay, we can't be right about everything! Recently, I was called out on a different mantra, to wit, \"MYST and RIVEN players don't buy other games.\" Actually, that last statement is probably the most benign of all my comments about the two megasuccesses. particularly interesting because the sample size is larger than that in any of the surveys CGW has commissioned. So, in answer to the question, \"Do RIVEN players play other games?\" we provide statis tics from the RIVEN registration cards (1998), the Computer Gaming in America study (1997), and the Computer Gaming World Subscriber Study (1997). Obviously, one would expect purchasers of adventure games like 31 percent participation (compared to the 43 percent among core gamers and 62 percent among CGW subscribers). In the Classics/ Puzzles genre, they equal the 37 percent participation among casual gamers, but lag slightly behind the 43 percent among CGW subscribers and 53 percent found in the core gamers. In the Action game category, RIVEN registrants aren't far behind the casual gamers with 41 percent participation comIn gaming habits, RIVEN registrants aren't far below the numbers in our surveys. Our Computer Gaming in America study showed that 53 percent of casual and 40 percent of core gamers play five or fewer hours per week, compared to 56 percent of RIVEN registrants. However, CGIA showed that 22 percent of casual and 47 percent of core gamers play more than 11 hours per week compared to 8 percent of RIVEN registrants. I was in error when I declared a pox on all RIVEN players. pared to 47 percent of casual, 66 percent of core, and 75 percent of CGW subscribers. Of course, when HumptyDumpty sits on a wall, we can all expect omelets. So, Red Orb Entertainment has graciously decided to prove me wrong. After being sent the raw results of the registration survey from RIVEN, I'm ready to revise my previous assertion. Since RIVEN's audience reaches beyond the circumference of even casual gamers, the percentages are generally lower than in other surveys. Yet, the results are interesting. Players of the two megahits do play some games. The results are MYST and RIVEN to play adventure games. Naturally, they do: 77 percent of RIVEN registrants play other adventure games. This compares to 53 percent among casual gamers, 68 percent among core gamers, and 67 percent among CGW subscribers. Now, for the surprises. In the Role-Playing category RIVEN registrants actually outgame casual gamers (25 percent) with a Nor were the 33 percent of RIVEN registrants who participate in Simulation games far behind the 40 percent of casual, 49 percent of core, and 75 percent of CGW subscribers who play those types of games. Only in Sports (20 percent compared to 33 percent of casual, 40 percent of core, and 40 percent CGW subscribers) and Wargames (16 percent compared to 31 percent of casual, 39 percent of core, and 58 percent of CGW subscribers) did RIVEN registrants fall far short of normal numbers. What, then, do these statistics reveal? First, they indicate that I was in error when I declared a pox on all RIVEN gamers as being parasites who buy only one product every eon or so, but cause a disparate amount of investment within companies trying to duplicate the phenomenon. Second, they indicate that RIVEN gamers are beginning to broaden their scope and try other types of gaming. This is excellent news. It bodes further expansion in the market. In the long run, however, it may be bad news to the hard-core in that it indicates more potential customers who don't like the carnage, mayhem, and bloodlust that forms a major part of the core game library. Third, the results suggest that there are subject areas and designs that can reach this greater audience. However, the data also suggest that there is no one sure-fire way to reach them. More experimentation will be required, and experimentation is expensive. We can always learn from surveys and statistics. Let's just hope we learn the right lessons and don't kill the hobby while we're chasing the goose that lays the golden eggs. CGW 41 53 Who Plays the Field?

Remember Maracana 1950? Federico Brubacher A Pleased Customer via the Internet Oh, yeah, Maracana in 1950, what a time we had then. Woo-hoo. Seriously, there's a simple reason why Brazil aced Uruguay in our June review—the reviewer's wife is Brazilian. She wouldn't let him in the front door if he had lost to Uruguay.

Play a demo, read previews, look at past products in the same mold from the same company—that is how to make an informed buying decision. I now more fully understand the pressures put on your magazine by people like Mr. Bucknam who seem to want you to spoon feed them a list of what to buy and what not to buy. I'm also very impressed that your magazine, unlike your competitors', has kept to its policy of not reviewing anything but finished product. To do so in the face of such pressure makes me all the more grateful to you. While I will always take exception to any publisher who reviews a product before it's finished and on the store shelves, have a lot more sympathy towards you guys now. All I can say is, \"Sorry guys (and gals),\" and please keep doing what you do best: giving honest, thoughtful reviews. Thanks for listening. -Steve Fox via the Internet shelves. Ugh! I believe I have finally learned my lesson. I don't even cross the portals of software retailing locations unless I have a CGW four-star review in my paws. Just one requesthave more coasters than I can possibly use. How about an article or two on CD-ROM arts & crafts? A mobile, maybe? High-tech birdfeeders? I just hate to toss those $50 dud discs without considering recycling in some way. Thanks for maintaining a quality publication. -Cindy Bogart via the Internet Hear, hear! I just gotta say that your mag rules, and anyone who thinks otherwise should be shot in the forehead and kicked down a flight of stairs covered in flesh-eating ants. Your 3D section in the June issue was extremely helpful, and now I know that I really could use a 3D accelerator, and which one to buy. Thanks, and peace. -Zach Heidemann via the Internet Wow, thanks for the feedback! And just to show our appreciation, we'll let you in on a little secret: We've got a huge RPG feature in store. Our October issue, which comes out in early September, will have juicy in-depth details on the hottest upcoming RPGS: WIZARDRY 8, ULTIMA: ASCENSION, SWORDS & SORCERY, BALDUR'S GATE, and RETURN TO KRONDOR.

The info you provide about hardware, upgrading, and operating systems covers all we need and want to know about our PC. Your reviews are so on-target that my New Year's resolution for 1998 is to wait until I read your critiques before purchasing any new games. It's tough-I am a big fan of D&D style RPGs. a genre that has been barren as of late.

"READ.ME THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE COMPUTER GAMING WORLD COMPUTER GAMING WO E3 NEWS  E3 NEWS  E3 NEWS  E3 NEWS Fear and Loathing in Atlanta ttending E3, the Electronic Entertainment Exposition, is a lot like being trapped inside a gargantuan sub-woofer. You're pummeled by the crowds; assaulted by sound vibrations only a few decibels short of a perpetual sonic boom; entranced by more dancing colors and shapes than a hippy having acid flashbacks during a Doors video; and promised more games for \"Christmas\" than an entire city full of greedy children could possibly beg from Santa Claus. It's a carnival of chaos and cacophony, an amazing midway of marketing barkers trying to steer you into one freak show after another. There was even a booth giving away mutilated rabbit remains (well...rabbit's feet!). If any trade show was ever more Vegas than Vegas, it's E3! Annua Fourth A ves to be be the the Fou Car Proves Colorf STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION-BIRTH OF THE FEDERATION and more traditional adventure games, such as GABRIEL KNIGHT III: BLOOD OF THE SACRED, BLOOD OF THE DAMNED. Even LucasArts is using 3D acceleration in INDIANA JONES AND THE INFERNAL MACHINE. 3D Audio is also starting to have an impact, as in the longawaited UNREAL where you can finally hear monsters behind you; and, believe it or not, in the largely text-based CROSSROADS, from VR-1. It isn't all good news, though. If E3 is an accurate impression, we'll also be seeing some aspects of the hobby that aren't so exciting. Several companies danced around mergers that may or may not be in the best interest of gamers. Two companies, Interplay and Interactive Magic, were readying initial public offerings, but facing less initial excitement than they had hoped. One company, MicroProse, just announced another horrendous quarter and one wonders how long they can survive at least, how long they can survive with multiple development studios. In addition, the fourth Quarter obsession continues. Rarely did any development team admit that a game being demonstrated was not for \"Christmas.\" Unfortunately, only about half of those so designated looked like they had a legitimate shot. Finally, as in most hit-driven businesses, we're seeing more and more clones. Although some of the game designs shown at this E3 had fresh ideas, there were no particularly fresh subjects or revolutionary ideas. So, E3 gives us a choice. We can either be the disappointed child who comes to the carnival to see the freak show, only to discover that he's being defrauded by fake prosthetics and clever staging, or we can be the delighted child who experiences wonderment over the fastest, prettiest, loudest, coolest, and most amazing experiences yet to grace the computer screen. We're probably a little of both.—Johnny Wilson \"Step right up,\" say the PR ringleaders, the marketing gurus, the proud developers, and executives. \"Never before,\" wax the claims, climbing higher and higher until they find them selves towering over reality like a BattleTech 'mech stomping on a foot soldier. Hype and hip. hope and hoke all combine to point the way to what we'll see on store shelves in the future. If E3 is an accurate impression, we'll see a whole lot of action going on. Action will perme ate and influence nearly every genre. The adventure, sports, role-playing, and strategy genres will all feature heavy action-oriented components in most of their products, 3D will dominate with titles like MESSIAH and DRAKAN leading the way. 3D acceleration is even beginning to appear in turn-based strategy games like ILLUSTRATION:A.J.

"While Hopeful Gamers Lined Up to Meet the X-Files Star, CGW Got the Inside Scoop READ ME housands of X-Files fanatics' dreams came true at E3, when Gillian Anderson, a.k.a. Agent Dana Scully, showed up at the Fox Interactive booth to sign autographs and promote Fox's upcoming title, THE X-FILES GAME. Before she greeted her fans, Ms. Anderson took some time to talk to us about her experiences working on the game, the upcoming movie, and much more. Here are highlights of the interview; for a complete transcript head to www. gamespot.com.-Charlotte Panther while ago, that was, I think, even before my daughter was born. And now, the only time really take out my laptop at all is when I take it out and play ARTHUR GOES TO SCHOOL and GREEN EGGS AND HAM. I have requested a lot of CD-ROMs, educational CD-ROMs, dictionaries, pictionaries, encyclopedias, and stuff that are still in their packages. But they're there for when I have some time. According to Fox Interactive President John Richmond, it took some convincing from Chris Carter or someone in the show to get you to participate in the game. Did experience that much? No, it was because I wanted a free ride to Seattle (laughs). No, I knew that they didn't have everything they wanted and, I like the Four Seasons hotel in Seattle [laughs again). You've already got quite a large following on the Internet. Are you anxious or perturbed that by participating in the game your bringing a new fraternity of unwashed geeks to your fan base? How do you feel about your fans, and, specifically, the large Internet following that you have? I haven't actually had that concern-unwashed geeks-or adding to the amount of fan base. don't have much interaction with them. I don't log on to any of the Web sites about me or the show or Scully's dog or whatever is out there. And obviously, as far as I'm concerned, you know, it's a safe realm. Most of the Web sites are safe realms for people to communicate about something that they have a mutual enjoyment of. And it's not harming anybody. It's certainly not harming me. Did you get to play the game? No, I haven't yet. Will you? Yes. I will probably play it for about maybe 15 or 20 minutes. Do you have a favorite X-Files episode? Every season, I usually have one of that season, but I think one of my all-time favorites now was from this past season, called \"Bad Blood,\" which was an episode written by Vince Gilligan. It was Mulder and Scully's individual versions of an episode, and basically our recounting of that. It was fun and challenging to film, and even more fun to watch. Would you do a game again if Fox was interested in doing a sequel? If it was a sequel to THE X-FILES GAME. I Gillian Anderson The Hit of E3 CGW: Did you or David ever play videogames, and if so, what were, or what are, your favorites? Anderson: I can't speak for David; I imagine that he doesn't play videogames. I have played some. Many years ago I played TETRIS and I've played MYST—just a little bit though. I mean I've said this a lot in other interviews but I'm terrified of losing consciousness or delving into some other reality that I'm not able to come out of, and forget I'm a mother and have responsibilities. TORTURED SOULS—it's like TETRIS but with eyeballs falling down, I really like that—that's a someone in the show convince everyone else to be a part of it? I wasn't privy to any of that. I was asked when I knew they were doing it and I wasn't sure that I had much choice. I showed up to Seattle and we did it. After the initial filming, you went back to the game's producers and told them that you'd be willing to give them more time. Was it because you enjoyed the mean, hopefully they would only do it if this is successful, so if this is successful, I'd be more than happy to. What about the movie? I f it's successful, I hope we do another one. I mean, hopefully, we're not going to be doing the series for the next 10 years, and doing the movies on the hiatus. Hopefully, the film will be so successful that the series will trail off and we'll just be doing the movies once in a while.

"READ ME E3 Sizzlers & Fizzlers! The 20 Best and 5 Worst Games at E3 Homeworld |(Strategy) Age of Empires II (Strategy) (Cue trumpet flourish) Knights and noblemen, queens and countrymen, I give you Microsoft's AGE OF EMPIRES II! We enter the middle ages with great crusades, castles, robust economic and diplomatic options, and dev. astating new siege engines. And wait till you see the formation combat... Q1 '99 Duke Nukem Forever (Action) Duke does Vegas in 3D Realms latest extravaganza with a modified QUAKE II engine and lavish 16-bit graphics. The trademark interactivity and attitude are in evidence, along with James Bondstyle action sequences and a female companion-aptly named Bombshell. It looks great, but you'll probably need a 3D card to play it. Q4 '98 Anachronox (RPG) Tom Hall's RPG for lon Storm is slowly moving from the design to production stage. The programmers are creating more realistic environments than those in any other QUAKE Il-based game. The addition of a real-time panning cam era is opening up the possibility for tons of cinematic shots and storytelling, à la FINAL FANTASY VII, but in real-time. Although this massive game is still a year from completion, the potential looks good. Q3 '99 Fighter Legends (Sim) This World War II sim from Jane's Combat Simulation blew us away with the best graphics we've ever seen in a simulation. Multiplayer at the show was a blast, with WW Il ace Bud Anderson giving tips. The powerful mission editor should make for lasting gameplay. Q3 '98 Relic's HOMEWORLD Was the Most Innovative and Exciting Game of E3 in a show crammed with clones of the latest 3D shooter or TOMB RAIDER, one game that stood out above the rest was newcomer of the Relic's HOMEWORLD. At its most basic level, HOMEWORLD is a realtime strategy game. But that label can only be loosely applied here. Technologically, visually, and tactically, HOMEWORLD is very different from what has come before, HOMEWORLD is a strategy game that follows a nomadic space-faring race on its return trip to a lost homeworld. You command this haphazard fleet on their journey, and along the way, meet aliens, traders, marauders, and the evil race responsible for their exile. The campaign is the least known part of the game, but Relic says it wants to make the single-player experience as moving and emotional as a movie. There will be NPCs to talk to, multiple mission paths, and an engaging story to drive gameplay forward. SHOW Diablo II (Action/RPG) Blizzard's follow up to DIABLO is certainly not just more of the same: A retooled interface, outdoor environments, multiplayer guilds, and lots more left us drooling for this long-awaited sequel to CGW's 1996 Game of the Year. Q2 '99 Gabriel Knight 3 (Adventure) The long-awaited new mystery from Jane Jensen and Sierra has the makings of a classic, with a strong storyline based on the Knights Templar, and brand-new 3D engine replacing the FMV look of the previous game. Q4 '98 Grim Fandango (Adventure) LucasArts' \"nextgeneration\" 3D adventure game is a funny, surreal tale of intrigue in the Land of the Dead. Easily the coolest-looking adventure game at E3. Q4 '98 Drakan (Action/Adventure) Pygnosis' stunning 3D action/ adventure game, DRAKAN, casts you as Rynn, a sword-wielding heroine who also happens to be buddies with a fearless dragon, Arokh. Players can control Rynn alone, or can move both heroine and dragon together with Rynn riding on Arokh's back, as they attempt to defeat the evil sorcerer, Kulrick, and his minions. Q1 '99 Half-Life (Action) Valve's shooter should be ready by July, and it will feature the most realistic environments yet. The alien beasts in this game show far more creativity than any other shooter, and look like the bestdesigned monsters since DOOM. Q2 '98 www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD AUGUST 1998 "

"Of course, what made our jaws drop at E3 Aliens vs. Predator (Strategy) READ.ME Of course, what made our jaws drop at E3 were HOMEWORLD's graphics and gameplay. The game is rendered in gorgeous, real-time 3D. Every single object, from ships to nebulae, is polygonal. Your playing space is likewise 3D, meaning you can finally engage in Star Wars-style combat with missiles, lasers, and ships flying in every conceivable direction. If you want to form a wedge of fighters and engulf a capital ship with fire in a 360-degree bubble, you can. With everything rendered in real-time, many possibilities for altering the gameworld come into play. You can charge gas clouds with ion cannons and make any harvesting trips into the resource-rich clouds deadly games of lightning roulette. You can break giant asteroids into a his action game from Fox Interactive combines both movies' creatures with a QUAKE-style space marine, all of whom battle in an intense free-for-all multiplayer mode. The coolest parts? The Alien character can run on any surface, giving you a decidedly DESCENT-like feel, and the Predator's shimmering cloaking mode looks just as cool as it did in the movie. Let's hope the single-player game is this good. Q4 '98 With multiple mission branching and levels that are better designed than even SCOURGE OF ARMAGON's, SiN should be a blast when it hits sometime this summer. Q3 '98 Messiah (Action) Dave Perry's MESSIAH is a game of possession. With an advanced engine that scales its polygons to create the best frame-rate, and a skeletal animation system that allows you to mess with every bone of a character's body, MESSIAH is opening up dozens of possibilities for interacting with your enemies. As a baby angel who can possess others, you can take control of enemies and make them walk through flames or off catwalks to their death. Q4 '98 Slave Zero (Action) Wanting to merge the worlds of MECHWARRIOR and QUAKE, Sean Vesce, the designer of MECH 2 and INTERSTATE '76, has come up with SLAVE ZERO, a game inspired by Japanese anime hits like Evangelion. The robot action is more fierce and intense than MECH 2's, taking place in crowded Blade Runner-like cities. Q1 '99 Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (Strategy) The real \"CIVILIZATION in Space\" from EA/Firaxis, featuring better AI, more diplomacy, multiplay options, a hard sci-fi tech tree, and that sense of wonder you had when playing the original Civ. While it lacks the sexiness of the latest 3D shooters, as with most Sid designs, the play's the thing—this is easily the deepest game we saw at the show. Q4 '98 minefield of smaller asteroids that will pelt all ships that fly through the rocky swarm. The attention to detail in HOMEWORLD is amaz. ing. Exhaust trails spew forth from ship engines; sparks fly when hulls get peppered with laser fire; nebulae are streaked by lightning storms, muzzle flashes from guns light up ship hulls; and thousands of lines of context-sensitive voice-overs create the feeling that your space battles are actually occurring. Fighters will call out their targets and cry for help when they get hit. HOMEWORLD looks amazing, and the potential for incredible, epic battles is huge considering the brilliant engine that is bringing Relic's vision to life. The only question is whether the interface will make it easy to issue assignments and commands in 3D space. Relic is determined to make everything as easy to learn and play as possible. The interface right now is a simple one of left and right mouse clicks and customizable hot-keys. The team wants every player to be able to create the most natural configuration for themselves. While HOMEWORLD is still several months from shipping, it's already taken the gaming world by storm. With its innovative look and design, and because of its movement into a full 3D tactical arena, it could take strategy gaming further than it's ever gone before. That's why it's the undisputed game of E3. Q4 '98 Wheel of Time (Action/Strategy) GT Interactive's WHEEL OF TIME makes even better use of the UNREAL engine than does UNREAL itself. The idea is to break into other players' castles and steal artifacts. However, when you are gone, other players can break into your castle and steal your artifacts. To protect your castle, you must design and build traps and lay down monsters to thwart would-be robbers. So while half of the game is first-person, fantasy action with spectacular spells and weapons, the other half of the game is level-building with a SIN (Action) Ritual's first-person shooter looks better each time we see it. There are plenty of interactive environments, such as pillars that can be destroyed by guards, thus bringing the roof crumbling down on you. Birth of the Federation (Strategy) EARE CTURA Star Trek Next Generation fans can stop whinPing: MicroProse's BIRTH OF THE FEDERATION IS so good it could make even Worf suppress a smile. Everything from Wonders of the Galaxy (à la CIV) to Ferengi economics and Romulan diffidence is modeled, in a much prettier, and more playable, grand strategy game than MOO II. The turn-based tactical space combat even supports 3D. Warp Speed, indeed! Q4 '98 ED HEER www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD AUGUST 1998 39 "


"... and Five Fizzlers Asteroids (Action) Don't look for a BATTLEZONE-style take on the arcade classic when Activision's ASTEROIDS ships. The rocks are 3D, but the gameplay is the same old top-down spin-and-shoot. Q4 '98 Prey Newman-Haas Racing (Sports) Pygnosis' PC conversion of NEWMAN-HAAS RACING is only slightly more robust than the PlayStation version that spawned it. You'd expect strategic depth and accuracy in the physics model for a racing game based on the CART team owned by driver/actor Paul Newman. At least, the detailed cockpit and adjustable mirrors are an advancement over the pure arcade play of the earlier game. Too bad little else is. Q3 '98 (Action simple, but powerful editor that gives every player the chance to design the most devious and impenetrable of keeps. Q1 '99 Star Con (Action) STAR CONTROL, a game that was once full of humor and personality, has been turned into a 3D space shooter. Sure, old STAR CONTROLS had the actionintensive melee, but they were part of a larger whole: an epic adventure game with quirky aliens and reams of hilarious dialogue. Accolade promises that the same humor and alien interaction will be there, but we won't believe that until we see it. Q4 '98 X-Files (Adventure) Fox's upcoming X-Files game casts you as a rookie agent assigned by Assistant Director Skinner to locate Mulder and Scully following their mysterious disappearance in Seattle. Gameplay is reminiscent of Activision's SPYCRAFT, with lots of \"online\" sleuthing and researching. The video sequences are extremely well done, giving it the look, feel, and quality of a real X-Files episode. Q2 '98 DREY seems to have it all: a cool character, a great story, and an amazing 3D engine capable of creating mind-bending environments. You'll play Apache Indian, Talon Brave, as he battles his way through an immense spaceship against three alien races. 3D Realms is including the editor, so you can build your own levels. Q1 '99 Top Gun: Hornet's Nest (Sim) MicroProse's action flight sim takes simplicity too far-it makes the last TOP GUN game look as complex as SU-27 FLANKER. We're all for introductory sims that are accessible to new gamers, but when jets don't even stall when they run out of speed, how useful an intro to flying is it? Q4 '98 Railroad Tycoon II (Strategy) V nown as the savior of HEROES OF MIGHT & MAGIC, Phil Steinmeyer, of Pop Top Software, along with Gathering of Developers (GOD). have acquired the rights to Sid's masterpiece, turning it into a strategy train-fest nonpareilcomplete with gorgeous 3D railroad cars and great graphics. Different levels of play allow you to ignore stock trading and modify your robber baron Al opponents. Q3 '98 Ultima Ascension (RPG) If ULTIMA VIJI: PAGAN was considered to be ULTIMA: MARIO, Origin/EA's latest incarnation is destined to be ULTIMA: TOMB RAIDER. The cinematics are incredible and the animation is outstanding, but the familiar \"behind the back\" character perspective drags the frame rate down like cement shoes in the East River. Plus, Lord British must assume that most of the longtime ULTIMA fans have given up on the series. There isn't much of the Britannian tradition left in the current stew.

"SCOOP READ MI Indy Rides. VRiceaimp LucasArts Unveils All-New 3D Indiana Jones Adventure he biggest surprise at E3 didn't come from the show floor, but from LucasArts' secret meeting suite. The most popular Nazibusting hero of the big screen (and the original tomb raider), Indiana Jones, is returning for his fourth LucasArts adventure, and this time, he's coming back in full, gorgeous 3D. INDIANA JONES AND THE INFERNAL MACHINE will be the fourth Indiana Jones title, but will be a huge leap above traditional LucasArts adventures. It will be a 3D action-adventure, in the same vein as, but technologically beyond, TOMB RAIDER. You'll play Indy and guide him through various tombs and caverns. In 1947, as the Cold War is just beginning, the Soviet Union sets out to find an ancient machine in the fabled Tower of Babel. If the Soviets were to get their hands on this machine, they could open a gateway to another dimension, called Aetherium, which is filled with teeming, destructive energy. As Indiana Jones, you have to stop the Soviets. When you are first summoned by your CIA friend, Sophia Hapgood, you are told that a Soviet scientist named Gennadi Volodnikov has discovered how to assemble the \"infernal machine.\" the parts for this machine, though, are scattered throughout the globe, including ancient Bablyon, the Tian Shan mountains, Kazakhstan, and Teotihuacn. Indy's job is to retrieve the pieces from these and other, locations before the Soviets do. the locations will be designed with plenty of traps and challenging puzzles. And what Indy adventure would be complete without opponents to fight? There will be combat, although at this point we don't know the exact enemies that Indy will face. He will have an expansive repertoire of moves, including swimming, jumping, running, swinging, and climbing. The weapons at his disposal in the dangerous tombs, mines, and dungeons will include his trusty whip, pistols, rifles, a bazooka, hand grenades, and satchel charges. The pieces of the Infernal Machine, and several other unique items, will also provide special powers. Several action sequences that cry classic Indiana Jones will also appear in the game, such as whitewater rafting, an off-road Jeep chase, and a rollercoaster mine car ride. with all this gameplay and a wild Indiana Jones storyline to nurture, Hal Barwood (creator of previous INDY adventure games) and his team at LucasArts are taking their time with this game. The release date should be March or April '99.-Elliott Chin 44 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1998 www.computergaming.com "

"READ.ME Ritual Foeges Heavy Metal Game Playing Lately he 1981 cult classic Heavy Metal will come roaring back to life next year with the release of a movie sequel and computer game, both entitled Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.2. Dallas-based Ritual Entertainment nailed the rights to develop the PC game, which is scheduled to coincide with the movie release in late summer '99. The company obtained the license for F.A.K.K.2 (Federation Assigned Ketogenic Killzone) from Kevin Eastman, who created the original movie and is working on the sequel. Ritual, best known for its awardwinning 1997 game QUAKE MISSION PACK #1: SCOURGE OF ARMAGON, is close to completion of its second game, the 3D action shooter SIN. The F.A.K.K.2 film will be one long story, as opposed to the 11 animated sequences in Heavy Metal. British artist Simon Bisley will once again create the outlandish character art. Ritual's agree ment provides for full use of all of the film's artwork as well as the movie's soundtrack. The storyline behind Ritual's game picks up about two and one-half years, after the movie sequel leaves off. The new game was supposed to be based on a nextgeneration, 3D \"Uber Engine\" capable of \"extremely detailed indoor and outdoor surface renderings and set tings, according to Ritual. However, with the loss of two key programmers, Ritual has opted to license an existing 3D engine, most likely that of QUAKE II or UNREAL Ritual Co-founder Robert Atkins says Eastman has given Ritual \"carte blanche to add our own slant to the already twisted Heavy Metal universe. We really have been given a special opportunity to create something unique and entertaining.\" Heavy Metal, released in 1981, featured animated stories with a driving rock soundtrack from Black Sabbath, Blue yster Cult, Cheap Trick, Devo, and Sammy Hagar. The movie earned more than $20 million at the box office and AAN sold over a million copies on video. -Ken Brown mm CGW Survey * Last Month Months on Chart 1. Age of Empires (Microsoft) 2.

"READ ME It Was the Best of Shows, It Was the Worst of Shows s usual, E3 had its high points and its low points. Forcing yourself to crawl out of bed for a 7 a.m. breakfast meeting after a night of drinking, dancing, and general debauchery, for example, was one of the less popular activities. But it was a necessity if one wanted to make the most of the short amount of time we had at the show. This year, we kept our eyes peeled during all the events at that enormous extravaganza of entertainment. We've told you about the best and worst games of the show. Now, here's CGW's take on the best and worse of everything. -Charlotte Panther Most Disturbing Game: THRILL KILL Want to see a guy ripping his opponent's arms out and beating him to death with them? How about watching a three foot, stiltwearing devil crush his opponent with the ends of his stilts or a cannibal who enjoys chewing on his victims body parts. And you don't even want to know what the Dominatrix does with her whip...or may be you do...you sick puppy. Best Game Name: Wargasm Digital Image Design's new battlefield strategy/simulation game sports a name that promises the peak of fun. Even better, though, is the moniker for the multiplayer mode: Multiple Wargasm. We're not making this up. Worst Timing for a Press Event: Ripcord Journalists were invited to a small, intimate press event held by Ripcord to promote their upcoming game, SPACE BUNNIES MUST DIE. Unfortunately, it clashed with another little bashthe Sony party, where Foo Fighters topped the bill. Best Chachka: Tomb Raider Watch There were all sorts of weird and wonderful things being given away at the show but our favorite was the Lara Croft watch, given to those who attended the Eidos party. Best Booth Babe(s): The VIGILANCE Girls After Eidos' set the precedence last year by having a real live Lara Croft-alike strolling around its booth, this year, you were nobody unless you had a booth babe or two. Alison Huxter, the star of SPACE BUNNIES MUST DIE was shaking it down at the Ripcord booth; Acclaim had the FORSAKEN girl on show; and Lara was back again, putting the moves on a new bunch of goo-goc-eyed geeks. Our vote, though, goes to SegaSoft and the VIGILANCE Girls. Sporting tight blue and black vinyl outfights, these models really did look like VIGILANCE stars Nikki, Amy, and company. Best Use of a Celebrity to Promote a Game: Gillian Anderson Although the celebs at this year's show included former NFL MVP Brett Favre, New York mayor Ed Koch, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, and best-selling novelist Douglas Adams, none drew a larger crowd than the X-Files babealicious Gillian Anderson. Most Inhumane Chachka: Rabbit's Foot Key Chain Ripcord gave away what it thought were fake rabbits' feet key chains to promote its upcoming game, SPACE BUNNIES MUST DIE. It turned outmuch to Ripcord's dismay—that the faux feet were actually real, and earth bunnies did, in fact, die for these tasteless talons. Best Party: Eidos Nintendo had the B-52s, Sony had Foo Fighters but among our hip young staff, Eidos won, with the semi-charmed Third Eye Blind opening for San Francisco's '70s tribute band Grooveline. Worst Party: Imagine Why? We weren't invited! Best Booth Beefcake: Duke Nukem This guy looked so much like the computer game character it was scary Bargain of the Show: Sega Worst Chachka: The CGW Shiny, Wavy Thing Nick-named the Shiny Butt Probe, nobody really knew what they were supposed to do with this useless chachka, but Stephan Jenkins, the lead singer of Third Eye Blind, was said to be waving his about wildly at the Eidos party Most Obvious Ripoff: TARTAN ARMY MYTH meets Braveheart. Just don't ask them what they've got on under their kilts. Rumor has it that after Sony paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for Foo Fighters to play at their party, the band then went on to the Sega party, where they played to an intimate crowd of about 150 people for free.

"YOUR BEST SOURCE FOR THE HOTTEST GAMES IN DEVELOPMENT Thief: The Dark Project Lurk in the Shadows in Looking Glass' Return to First-Person Gaming Looking Glass wanted to break away from that traditional mold, but wanted to keep elements of fantasy to enliven its gameworld. The game casts you as Garrett, a professional thief, and presents some 16 different \"missions,\" most of which require you to rob by Thierry Nguyen the classics of 3D action gaming include such luminaries as DOOM, WOLFENSTEIN 3D, DUKE NUKEM 3D, and QUAKE. Almost never mentioned, but arguably as influential, are some of the games from Looking Glass. These days Looking Glass is far better known for the gorgeous FLIGHT UNLIMITED series, but the company defined the first-person RPG with the ULTIMA UNDERWORLD series, and it created the first true 3D environments with the action/adventure SYSTEM SHOCK in 1994. Now, Looking Glass is itching to return to the first-person action genre-and return in style. For its next game, THIEF: THE DARK PROJECT, \"lurking\" will be the key to success. DOES WHATEVER A SPIDER CAN Garrett, your character in THIEF, is a renowned professional burglar who can slink up walls and lurk in the shadows. Thief: The Dark Project GENRE: Action Adventure RELEASE DATE: 03 '98 DEVELOPER: Looking Glass Technologies PUBLISHER: Eidos a closely guarded item from some local baron for a shady employer. In the first few missions, you burglarize various mansions and keeps until word reaches you that your fence (the man who's been your mission contact) has been captured by a religious order of lawmen. You then have to break him out of jail. At this point, the plot thickens. The shady employer who has been using you reveals himself. He asks you to steal a powerful artifact from the selfsame religious order that imprisoned your fence. During the course of this conversation, it's shown that your employer, \"Constantine,\" is essentially the Devil. Once you retrieve the object, you realize that you've done the Devil's dirty work and have helped him unleash his unholy minions on the world. Now it's time for you to atone for that tiny mistake. THIEF features a highly stylized, post-Industrial Revolution look, with cut-scenes that enhance the design. Looking Glass has opted to use two-dimensional, handdrawn storyboard-style stills, complete with voiceovers, for the mis sion \"briefings.\" While it sounds unspectacular on paper, it proves markedly different when viewed onscreen. We watched the scene Strangers in the Night THIEF: THE DARK PROJECT takes place in a universe where steam engines reign, yet magic still lives. Hence, this world isn't the usual \"medieval fantasy\" fare that adventure gamers are used to. in which Constantine gives you the key mission, and the fades, shifting images, lighting, and voice-acting creates a sequence of cinematic quality. The Looking Glass artists who developed these cut-scenes have drawn inspiration from such stylized and innovative films as Brazil, The City of Lost Children, and Dark City. MÉNAGE  TROIS SPEAK OF THE DEVIL GOTHIC GOTHAM The enemy Al will often call out for assistance once someone has spotted you. Late in the game, Constantine reveals himself to be more than human, and unleashes his unholy minions upon you. The architecture reflects THIEF's Industrial Age look, although plenty of fantasy elements spice up the atmosphere. 66 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD AUGUST 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"SNEAK PREVIEWS The enemies in the beginning of the game range from normal guards to religious zealots. When Constantine acquires the artifact. the enemies become beasts from the Devil's realm. Looking Glass is determined to make memorable hellbeasts, rather than the usual tired, fantasy fare. The Al in THIEF looks good. Looking Glass really does a nice job of handling guard duty. The guards patrol the halls, and if you make too much noise, they will pause and look for the source of the noise. If they spot you, they will chase you unless you go back into hiding. Guards might even shout to each other to converge on you if you make your presence known. If you manage to duck back into the shadows, these guards will just assume that they are seeing things and ignore you. We saw only the guards in action, so we can't give details about the Al of other enemies. RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE THIEF's setting allows the game to use puzzles that incorporate steam engine-era machinery. beginning levels will features lots of mansions and houses; in later missions you'll explore prisons, mills, garrisons, and a temple. While the game engine doesn't sound particularly special, the gameplay itself will make THIEF unique. As a thief, you've mastered the art of hiding in the shadows, attacking from behind, MANO-A-MANO The emphasis and sniping from afar. As a consein THIEF is on sneaky, one-onquence, your fighting ability isn't one combat, with melee as hardy as, say, that of a QUAKE being a last resort (unless marine. You enter into direct comyou're stabbing someone in bat only as a last resort, and the back). Looking Glass intends that you sneak past most obstacles, or at Lurking in the least kill stealthily, one man at a Shadows Unknown time. Your two main weapons are Okay, so the plot and atmos a sword for melee attacks and a phere are immersive, but what bow for ranged fire. The bow at about the actual game?

As Garrett, when you hide in rather than running in with cross the shadows, you effectively bows at the ready. become invisible (like the Assassin The engine is Looking Glass's in HEXEN II). Your footsteps are own, and has standard features also quieter when you walk (runsuch as 3D acceleration, high ning will make lots of noise). The color usage, and dynamic lighting. type of surface you walk on will Due to the nature of the game, affect the level of noise you make, there won't be many outdoor which can present a dilemma: Do environments, the action generally you stay in the dark stone corridor takes place in closed spaces. The and risk making more noise, or do most open environments that you walk on the soft carpet and you'll get are town streets. The hope that you don't get seen? reveal where he is kept and exactly how many guards are watching him. Looking Glass hopes to create a game in which you really have to stop think, and listen to what is going on around you. Scattered about the levels, you'll find many plot-related books—both to flesh out the game's atmosphere and to provide supplementary hints for some of the puzzles. However, these elements are strictly enhancements: Looking Glass assured us that the gamer will never be required to read a book, and that every puzzle and level can be completed without doing so. At every opportunity, Looking Glass emphasized that this is not a QUAKE clone. The design team even thinks of this title as a role-playing game. There are no stats, but you role-play a thief. This won't be some actionintensive game with a high body count. In fact, Looking Glass is designing the game so that, if played right, you can finish without killing a single person. From the looks of it, Looking Glass's THIEF has the potential to be another solid action-adventure game. While the technical features may not blow away the competition, the atmosphere and the gameplay will make this one stand alone. In a genre dominated by intense combat with guns or spells, it's refreshing to see a developer take the time to create a game that emphasizes stealth over a quick trigger finger. CGW The Walls Have Ears The missions in THIEF will place great emphasis on puzzle solving, as in previous Looking Glass games. One vastly important skill that you have is the ability to eavesdrop on the guards. Many of the hints for solving puzzles and getting through the plot are revealed in conversations that you must overhear. When you are going to rescue your fence, for example, you'll need to eavesdrop on two bored guards, who will TWO-FACED LIAR Much of your time in THIEF will be spent lurking in dark locales such as this crypt. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate CHAOS GATE Strives to Be the Best PC Warhammer Game Yet SNEAK PREVIEWS by Sam Baker f you're getting a little tired of real-time strategy games, SSI's latest may provide some relief. WARHAMMER 40,000: CHAOS GATE is a turn-based tactical game set in the dark, brooding, futuristic universe created by Games Workshop. In the 18-mission campaign you lead the Ultramarines through a series of battles with the dreaded Chaos Marines and their demonic overlords. CHAOS GATE has a completely new engine, which SSI developed to address the shortcomings of SOLDIERS AT WAR (see our SOLDIERS review on page 216). WEGG LI SKILL POSITIONS The values for leaders and specialists, like the apothecary, are much higher than those of the average squadie. BeaSONS DE STED. THE FIRE DOWN BELOW Heavy flamers are just the things for cleaning out Chaos infestations. wargame heritage, just about every high-tech toy from the Warhammer 40,000 universe finds its way into the computer game: 37 space marine weapons (plus several more exclusive to the Chaos forces), 10 different grenades, and 25 Psyker and Chaos spells. For those who like to get up close and personal, there are numerous melee weapons, such as the chainsword, power fist, and force ax. SSI has even added the special Terminator power shield and force ax combination. Rhinos on the Prowl In CHAOS GATE, you'll find plenty of types of space marines to whet your sci-fi soldier appetite. In addition to the expected assault troopers, devastator squads, and terminators, SSI also includes some special marines: librarians, captains, apothecaries, and tech marines. The game doesn't skimp on the tanks, either, providing Rhino APCs, Predator Tanks, land speeders, and the dreadnought suits that were absent from FINAL LIBERATION. And while CHAOS GATE's vehicular combat bears more than a passing resemblance to X-COM's, in CHAOS GATE, you have the added benefit of being able to use the Rhino to transport troops on the map. As one might expect from a company with SSI's rich strategy The Cult of Chaos In true Warhammer fashion, CHAOS GATE has quite the assortment of bad guys with bizarre names: the Khorne Berzerkers, the Chaos Terminators, the Chaos Cultists, and the dreaded Word Bearer Chaos Marines (which sounds like my editor near a deadline). There are six different Chaos Demons represented, including the Pink Horrors, which, when shot, split into two Blue Horrors. Some foes are more subdued; the Chaos Lords, for example, are the equivalent of Ultramarine specialists. Unlike a lot of paper/ miniatures-to-computer conversions, SSi's game does a good job of staying faithful to the original concepts. The biggest departure from the official Warhammer 40,000 rules is that you employ 5-man squads rather than 10-man squads, this actually speeds up play during each of the missions and grants you more tactical flexibility. Each marine has 10 different skills that will improve if he survives each mission: action points, health, armor, ballistic skill, weapon skill, strength, toughness, initiative, number of attacks, and leadership. SSI diverges from the Warhammer 40,000 bible by making these skills percentages rather than the mostly single-digit values used in the tabletop game, so that there is more room for improvement. The penalties for leaving the command radius of leaders are less severe as well: In CHAOS GATE, marines who are \"out of contact\" don't receive the action point bonus from their leader. A marine's every action uses action points (APs), and when these run out, that marine's turn is over. Marines may be placed in overwatch by clicking on a button. in that mode, the marine will reserve enough APs to be able to take a normal shot at the end of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate GENRE: Turn-based Strategy RELEASE DATE: 03 '98 DEVELOPER: Random Games PUBLISHER: SSI COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Up to four players can participate as Chaos Marines or Ultramarines over a network, modem, or Internet connection. The only campaign, however, is for the Ultramarines. A full mission editor is included with the game as well as a complete encyclopedia that is accessible within the game or mission editor. In the mission editor, you can create singleand multiplay stand-alone scenarios, but not campaigns (although you can edit any mission in the game and save it as a stand-alone scenario). The editor lets you use any of the graphics, units, or weapons that are in the game. The editor includes triggers and reactors (similar to triggers, only tied to a location). Triggers are placed within a scenario by the designer and trip when certain things happen. For example, you might get a Predator as reinforcement when you've crossed/entered a particular square or on turn 10. CHAOS GATE is still pre-alpha, but even in this early state, the graphics, sounds, music, and interface already create a dark, brooding atmosphere totally different from most of the me-too strategy clones we've been subjected to recently.

The maps can be edited (or built from scratch), orders of battle can be built or customized, weather can be delineated, calendar can be controlled, and special events can be scheduled to trigger at appropriate points. SNEAK_PREVIEWS WARPAINT Like Koger's Wargame Construction Kits for SSI, TOAW will feature a versatile editor for maps, units, and events. A Code Named Ultra? Naturally, it is difficult to predict the ultimate competence of the artificial generals from prerelease code. Yet, the early indicators seem positive. It could be either our imagination or wishful thinking, but we've seen artificial generals perform very smart maneuvers to cut supply or wear down fortified positions. This may depend on the scenario, but it seems to bode well for the playability of the game. Whether the artificial opponents are the ultrafoe or not, TalonSoft has built in the typical two-person hotseat and play-byemail options that will allow veteran gamers to challenge real intelligence as opposed to merely facing the artificial kind. One thing seems absolutely certain: THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR is Norm Koger's finest hour. TOAW is the deepest and most fascinating wargame he has yet designed. CGW 2 a unit; Fortify a unit (a stronger version of Entrench); assign a unit to Tactical Reserve (where by reaction to enemy presence is restricted to adjacent hexes); deploy a unit as Local Reserve (whereby reaction to enemy presence occurs within the radius of the unit's movement allowance); attempt to Reorganize (a modern version of rallying the troops after unsuccessful combat); Embark (by boarding transports, trains, ships, or planes); use air units to support combat troops, interdict enemy planes, or fly superiority missions (ensure that one's enemy is less likely to be able to use air support); or rely on standard Move and Attack commands. Single unit attack Single group attack All units attack Minimize losses Limit losses Ignore losses Single unit limited attack Single group limited attack All units limited attack Plan an attack Abort Stand DIAL M FOR MINIMIZE A commander in the Israeli Defense Force attempts to root out Arab units entrenched in the hills without sacrificing too many troops. P.E. MODO11 bloodied in battle. So, TOAW does not assign a proficiency level until a unit actually engages in battle. The general has an estimated proficiency level, but the actual results may vary up to 25 percent of that estimate. Naturally, once a unit has attained veteran status, the competence of a unit is wellknown. Lose too many tanks and replace the losses? The veteran status may disappear to reflect the untried troops being shuttled into that unit. Generals can know the level of unit readiness at a glance. Fully rested units have a readiness of 100 percent; exhausted troops, a readiness of only 30 percent. Since TOAW averages readiness level with proficiency level in order to obtain the quality of the troops, detail-oriented gamers (sometimes maligned as \"control freaks\") will monitor unit readiness and proficiency with assiduousness. Other gamers will appre. ciate the fact that this detail is used in TOAW, but will probably monitor the readiness/proficiency levels only when deploying for important battles. Experienced gamers will also appreciate the number of deployment orders available to TOAW generals. One doesn't merely have the option of assigning a unit to Defend. Rather, one may: Entrench GERMAN Turn 1 5/10/1990 Sund 10 TVAS NOT A NAZI The Germans prepare to drive on Bastogne in the opening move of the France 1940 scenario. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD AUGUST 1998 81 "

"12 New 3D Action/Adventure Games Are Stealing Lara's Look but Adding Their Own Brand of Gameplay TOMB ROBB "


"n our industry, any time a game breaks the millionsales mark, other publishers take notice. The think ing goes: \"If company X can sell a million copies of Y, we'll just make a bigger Y and sell more.\" Thus, the endless clone wars begin. It happened when DOOM and QUAKE became big money-makers. It happened when Mest became computer gaming's biggest seller of all time. And it happened when COMMAND & CONQUER and WARCRAFT II sales went through the roof. So what's next on the to-becloned list? TOMB RAIDER. For many people, TOMB RAIDER and Lara Croft made the third-person action-adventure sexier than DOOM's first-person blood-and-guts tourney. With millions of TOMB RAIDERs and TOMB RAIDER Ils sold on the PlayStation and PC, Eidos has discovered that there is a huge market for action-adventures full of exploration, puzzle-solving, and the occasional gunfight. It's a discovery that's piqued the interest of many other game developers. Red Orb is getting in on the action by reviving its most famous franchise, PRINCE OF PERSIA, Raven and Activision are spinning off the HERETIC franchise from HEXEN and creating HERETIC II, a third-person fantasy romp. And Psygnosis is introducing a fantasy action/adventure that puts you on the back of a fire-breathing dragon. These are just a few of the many promising games following in Lara's footsteps. We don't want to call any of these games clones, because each is carving its own niche. And many of them are imaginative and full of promise. Don't believe us? See for yourself.... "


"TOMB ROBBERS Tomb Raider III COVERSTORY She's Back, and This Time It's a Real Sequel by Charlotte Panther when I first heard that Lara would be returning for a third performance, the game was not planned as a complete sequel--Eidos was describing it as TOMB RAIDER 2.5, which suggested that this would be more like an add-on, not a new game. So why the sudden decision to bill it as TOMB RAIDER III? Are there really enough changes to justify a complete sequel? Core Design certainly thinks so. Adrian Smith, the director of 80 percent of the engine, imple menting a much-improved dynamic lighting system into the new game. Fans will also notice that there is less shooting in TOMB RAIDER III and a return to the puzzle-solving of the first game. placed around the core of the meteorite in the form of an altar, have been stolen and scattered throughout the world. Legend has it that they hold the secret to great powers; in fact, they actually hold the most important discoveries in genetics and evolution since Survival of the Fittest When planning the TOMB RAIDER games, the first thing the hen TOMB RAIDER first made its appearance almost two years ago, gamers were totally captivated, not only with the game's luscious heroine, Lara Croft, but also with the technology and gameplay. Core had taken 3D technology-which had, until that point, been primarily the property of shoot-'em-ups—and used it to enhance a completely different game environment. TOMB RAIDER was still fundamentally an action game-Lara had guns and wasn't afraid to use them-but the gameplay went beyond testing how fast your reflexes were. Here, the emphasis was on adventure, discovery, and problem-solving. If you had to shoot a few enemies along the way, well, so be it. In TOMB RAIDER II, the game's pace was speeded up somewhat, but the engine and gameplay showed little change. The one noticeable difference was the environment: TOMB RAIDER had focused on dreary caverns and dark grottoes; TOMB RAIDER II allowed you to experience the outdoor wonders of places like Venice. With TOMB RAIDER III in the works, even the most ardent TOMB RAIDER fans may be apt to some skepticism (do the words \"milking it\" spring to mind?). From what we've seen so far, however, it looks as though the evolution from TOMB RAIDER II to TOMB RAIDER III will be a far greater leap than was the case with the previous episode. Back in January, Tomb Raider III RELEASE DATE: Q4 98 DEVELOPER: Core PUBLISHER: Eldos STYLE: A classic Lara Croft adventure with lots of environments to explore and puzzles to solve WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE TOMB RAIDER III will feature greatly improved water effects with more realistic splashing and better reflections. design on TOMB RAIDER, admits that TOMB RAIDER II wasn't really a new game. That won't be the case with TOMB RAIDER III. With new design team members aboard for TOMB RAIDER III, there is no shortage of ideas. The challenge will be to incorporate all of these new ideas, while maintaining the feel of the original. Meanwhile, the programmers have rewritten members of the Core design team decide is which exciting locations they want Lara to visit. Once that's settled, the writer has the arduous task of writing a factually correct storyline linking those countries. This time, your mission is to locate and piece together four bits of a meteor that crashed into Antarctica millions of years ago. The four pieces, originally Darwin's theory of evolution. On your quest to find these pieces, you'll visit the islands of the South Pacific, tramp through the jungles of India, delve into London's mysterious subculture, and explore Nevada's infamous Area 51. Once again, the game will have 15 levels, spread throughout these locales, but TOMB RAIDER III promises to be less linear than its 86 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"T OM BROBBERS pletely COVERSTORY m predecessors, which will allow you to play the levels in whatever order you like. Your decisions will not affect the overall outcome of the game, but there will be advan tages and disadvantages to the routes you choose. Some will be more difficult than others, but will reward you for your daring with better weapons and flares. Core hopes this subtle difference will encourage gamers to replay levels. The design team is also thinking about other ways to reward gamers—you may get a bonus depending on the number of save games you use, for example. Core's main focus, however, is to enhance the game's special effects to make the atmosphere of TOMB RAIDER III completely immersive. Where the previous games sometimes felt sparse and lonely, Core has really tried to fill out the game environment: Birds and bats will appear in front of Lara as she walks down a path, and leaves will blow around the floor. The new lighting system makes the game darker and more mysterious than before, and light and darkness will play a big part in the puzzles. For example, there will be transparent platforms that can be seen only under the light of a flare. You'll also discover that some of the baddies are afraid of the light. There will also be multicolored lighting this time, trans parency effects (including opaque light beams and realistic shadows), and improved water effects with more realistic splashing and better reflection. Weather effects will include fog, rain, and snow (in which Lara will leave footprints). A new landscape system will offer richer terrain detail. And Core claims to have solved the clipping problems that were apparent in the first two TOMB RAIDER games. Lara will encounter a host of human characters—including a band of mercenaries she can either fight or join-as well as a enagerie of animals. To improve the enemy Al, Core recruited Tom (\"Dr. Tom\") Scutt, a specialist in animal intelligence. Using Dr. Tom's principles, Core will apply pack behavior Al to both human and animal enemies. Tigers will Now surround Lara before they attack, rather than confronting her head on. To beat the more efficient pack tactics, Lara can shoot the leader and disperse the rest of the creatures. Similarly, when any creatures hear a gunshot the first time, they'll get scared. By the second time, however, they'll be used to it. Run, Lara, Run Enemies are well-hidden throughout the game. Deadly piranhas may lurk in the waters; long grass may disguise venomous snakes or other lethal critters, mischievous monkeys may pop up at any time to steal your weapons: and quicksand traps can suck you in at any second. Lara, as always, is well-equipped to handle every situation and has plenty of new moves, including the ability to strafe while swimming and push down, barge, or kick through some doors and scenery. She can also do a hand-over-hand monkey swing, a rope swing, and a duckand-roll action, all of which are based around new puzzle ideas. Finally, Lara can now do a speeddash-a timed sprint-so you can expect a few time-based activities, such as escaping from a rush of oncoming boulders. Core has incorporated more vehicles into TOMB RAIDER IIIthere's a different one in every level, and all of them will be key to the gameplay. For the most part, they will be motorized (the team had toyed with the idea of putting Lara on horseback, but decided against it). You can expect to see an underwater propulsion unit, a snow vehicle, and even a www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD AUGUST 1998 81 "

Core considered implementing handto-hand combat into the game, but it would have required giving each of the bad guys a combat animation sequence. The space demands would have been so high, that it would have meant cutting out a weapon or some of the enemies. Core decided it was not worth the tradeoff. Instead, Lara will be packing a Desert Eagle pistol, a hand grenade, a rocket launcher, and the latest Uzi model. Core is still deciding on other weapons. WATCH THE BIRDIE Within the jungle lurk both human and animal enemies. TURN ON THE LIGHTS Light and darkness will play a big part in TOMB RAIDER III's puzzles. This platform, for example, can be seen only by the light of a flare. Lara Wraps Up In case anybody was worried, Core promises that Lara will not wear those short-shorts when traveling through the freezing snow. The design team plans to keep her wardrobe sexy, but this time they will take into consideration the various climes she will have to endure. And finally, the question that everyone has been asking: Will TOMB RAIDER III include network play? The answer is no and the reason, according to Adrian Smith is because the designers \"can't think of a really good way of doing it.\" They've received many suggestions from gamers, including capture-the-flag, a two-player race (whereby the first person to reach a trap door would get points for opening it), or having multiple Laras battling in a very small arena. Core feels that it would be impossible to institute any of these ideas and still maintain the feel of the game, partly because TOMB RAIDER relies much more on discovery than on shooting. So, should we expect a TOMB RAIDER IV? Core is confident that the game is compelling enough to keep people coming back for more. As long as the TOMB RAIDER team can maintain the feel of the original, and at the same time keep successive games fresh and exciting, they are happy to continue. TOMB RAIDER III is scheduled for a November release. CGW he has graced the cover of mainstream magazines like Time Digital, she accompanied the rock band U2 on its last world tour, and, with the Tomb Raider movie on the horizon, she'll soon be a star of the silver screen. It may seem that Lara Croft is every where, but actually, Core and Eidos are very careful about their starlet's public image. Since the Lara phenomenon hit, they have been offered many merchandising deals including opportunities for Lara socks and Lara underwear-but they are very cautious about what they agree to, accepting only about 1 percent of the offers made. In fact, a Lara Croft committee has been established to vote upon exactly what the buxom beauty should endorse. Core plans to follow the James Bond school of marketing and associate Lara only with quality products that fit her personality. Although today Lara is every marketing executive's dream girl, she almost wasn't a woman. When the original game was conceived, there was some hesitation about Lara being female because it was unprecedented at the time to have a strong, smart, attractive heroine in a computer game. Toby Gard (Lara's creator) and the rest of the TOMB RAIDER team wanted their lead character to be different from the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger-type action hero. They wanted the character to be agile, strong-willed but caring, with a sense of coyness. If they put these personality traits on a man, they risked producing a young, some what wimpy antihero. A woman with these attributes, however, made a perfectly respectable action figure. And so, Lara Croft was born. As for the upcoming Paramount movie, Core says that it is very excited, but also a little nervous. After all, if the film flops, that's the end of the franchise. At press time, there was no word on who would play Lara (I vote for Elizabeth Hurley). Core's Adrian Smith agrees that Hurley is a possibility, but says that Core has no clear favorite just as long as it's someone famous. Tomb Raider: The Movie is expected to hit theaters in late 1999. DASHING THROUGH THE FOES New moves will include a speed dash, a rope swing, a monkey swing, and a duck-and-roll. ARMED FOR DEATH Along with her usual Uzi, this time Lara will be packing a Desert Eagle Pistol, a hand grenade, and a rocket launcher. 90 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"TOMB ROBBERS Heretic II Raven's Next Fantasy Game Takes a Break From the First-Person Look COVER STORY by Thierry Nguyen aven's HERETIC broke away from the mainstream by providing a DOOM-style shooter in a pure fantasy environment. Instead of shooting aliens, you fired spells at gargoyles. HERETIC was the first title in a fantasy trilogy that pitted you against the Serpent Riders, with HEXEN and HEXEN Il rounding out the series. With the trilogy completed, Raven is taking the HERETIC name in a new direction with HERETIC II, complete with a new plot, a new perspective, and a new engine about HERETIC II is that it's a third-person game. You no longer see the world through Corvus's eyes. Gameplay in HERETIC II focuses less on dispatching legions of enemies in linearly constructed levels and more on exploring, with dashes of adventure-style puzzles and fast-paced action thrown in. The preview alpha was an early build that showed off Corvus's actions and the modified QUAKE II engine. Corvus looks very good RING AROUND THE ROSIE The weapons in HERETIC II are mostly spell-based, such as this new one, the Ring of Repulsion. Tomb Heretic The backstory for HERETIC II puts you once again in the shoes of Corvus, the original HERETIC who defeated D'Sparil. Although D'Sparil and his INDIANA ELF Even though it's using a new brothers are engine and new style, Raven still has some now long gone, cool statues and architecture in its games. Corvus's world is once again in trouble. A for a third-person character.

Art as Play With its inventive use of the QUAKE II engine, Raven has once again shown that it makes some of the most aesthetically beautiful action games. In the sample level, the textures were crisp and nicely illustrated, and the architecture at times awe-inspiring. On top of that, the colored lighting really added to the atmosphere, especially in the spell system. Most of the weapons for HERETIC II will be various spells. Some are straightforward, like firebolt, but there are some refreshingly new ones. One is the Ring of Repulsion, a blue field that wards off enemies. Another is the Shield of the Hunter, green spheres that circle Corvus and fly off to strike nearby enemies. The only non-spell weapon I saw was the Magic Bow, but based on the character model for the final game it looks like Corvus may have some melee weapons. All in all, HERETIC II is a bit of a gamble for Raven, given its new perspective, engine, and game style. But with Raven's background in solid fantasy games and beautiful art design, HERETIC II should be something to keep an eye on.

"TOMB ROBBERS Drakan COVERSTORY Get Ready for a Mix of TOMB RAIDER and Fire-Breathing Dragon Action by Elliott Chin aced with a glut of TOMB RAIDER-style action games on the horizon, how does a publisher grab the attention of jaded gamers? By moving to the head of the pack with a hard-core medieval fantasy package full of playable dragons and intense, spell-flinging, bloodletting combat. Psygnosis's new San Francisco-based development house is working on its first title, DRAKAN, and it's a third-person perspective, 3D action-adventure game with gameplay that's a blend of action and role-playing. mighty wyrm capable of mass destruction and fiery breath. While you will be able to wield all sorts of weapons, from swords to axes to crossbows to maces, your winged companion will use various breath weapons, including fire, ice, and lava. Of course, neither of you starts out with an awesome arsenal. You'll have to discover these weapons and acquire new abilities as you explore the vast gameworld. The game ranges across five worlds with widely differing environments, and the worlds comprise more than a dozen levels. Unlike in classic action games, you won't progress from level to level just by shooting and killing things. You have quests and missions you must solve, and these missions will take you between levels and possibly worlds. Each level will be vast, and can include aboveground and underground locations. While you're cruising the skies on Arokh in one level, you might spot an interesting cave below. Dismounting from Arokh's DRAGON SIMULATOR Who wouldn't want to ride a dragon? You'll meet Arokh early in the game and be able to ride him throughout most of the gameworld. Dragon Quest DRAKAN takes place in a medieval fantasy world that has been overrun by evil. (Haven't they all been?) An archmage named Kulrik has engulfed the world in darkness and unleashed a horde of foul monsters. Allied with him are evil dragons who rule the skies. As the heroine, Rynn, you discover that your village and many others are being attacked by marauding wartoks (fancy ogres with big noses). As you embark on a quest to rid your village of wartoks, you'll become engulfed in the battle to thwart Kulrik's plans. However, you won't fight alone. Eons ago, good dragons ruled the world justly, and one such being-Arokh-has returned to help your people in their darkest hour. Early in the game, you will find this noble dragon, a back, you can then venture into the cave to explore. Thanks to the graphics engine, the transition between indoor and outdoor environments should be seamless, and you'll be able to enter and retreat from the caves as often as you like. The different environments you might traverse include villages, caves, ice caverns, forests, mountains, swamps, and volcanoes. People to See, Things to Kill Populating these levels will be humans, whom you'll talk to for quests and general information, and monsters, which you'll fight in droves. There are evil dragons, troll-like wartoks, stone-hurling giants, and scavengers. The humans you'll encounter are important, not just because they give you quests, but because they'll also open up new spells and breath weapons to you once you complete the tasks they give you. Although Rynn does not start with any spell-casting abilities, later in the game she will learn to use potent magics. Drakan RELEASE DATE: Q1 '99 DEVELOPER PUBLISHER: Psygnosis STYLE: A hack-and-slash with dungeon romping and dragon riding, ON THE HORIZON The graphics engine in DRAKAN lets you see clearly almost to the horizon. It's also responsible for some very fluid and realistic animation. BACK, I SAY Here, Rynn attacks one of the marauding wartoks. A sudden invasion by these long-snouted beasts is what draws Rynn into the game's larger conflict. 96 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"TOMB ROBBERS COVER_STORY No matter what quests you take, which worlds you explore, or what monsters you fight, you'll always have the choice of continuing on Arokh's back or on foot. In the very first level of the game, you'll begin your initial quest on foot. However, once you find the dragon Arokh, you can ride on his back for nearly the entire game. The choice is yours: You can either fly from place to place and get there quickly, or you can walk and pick up power-ups and weapons, meet various NPCs, and explore the environments. In either case, you will encounter enemies, whether they are flying dragons or earthbound giants. In the air, you'll engage in aerial dogfights; on land, you'll trade sword blows and spells with your enemies. If you do choose to fly around the levels, you can always land Arokh and do some exploring on your own. It will actually be very important to explore on your own because there are plenty of puzzles to solve and secret areas to discover, all of which you would miss if you were in the air. There will also be a number of levels and caves designed solely for Rynn; at these, Arokh will simply have to wait for you to finish your quest. Defeating GET OFF MY BACK If you don't explore the world on foot, you'll miss out on meeting lots of NPCs, solving puzzles, and gathering special items. Kulrik, however, will require the combined might of you and your draconic steed. The graphics engine that Psygnosis has BLADE DRAGON A sketch of a blade dragon, one the many evil dragons allied with Kulrik. developed looks sharp, and the skeletal animation system is proving capable of incredibly realistic animation for both Rynn and Arokh. Rynn has more than a hundred different moves, and she rivals Lara Croft for fluidity, not just for sheer numbers of actions. Unlike TOMB RAIDER, DRAKAN will ship with multiplayer support. At the very least, you'll be able to deathmatch with other dragonriding players. With a great premise, adventureand role-playing-style gameplay, and plenty of environments to explore, DRAKAN promises to be one of the better third-person titles on the horizon. Look for Psygnosis to release it in early 1999. CGW DANCE OF DEATH Whether in the air or land, you'll battle Kulrik's minions.

Fresh for the millennium, the seminal platformer is returning in a (what else?) brand-new 3D engine, putting you into the heart of the action à la TOMB RAIDER (which, itself, was influenced by the first PRINCE OF PERSIA). PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D has more going for it than just the name. It also boasts the design and story guidance of Jordan Mechner, creator of the original POP games. Along with the game's producer, Andrew Pedersen (whose name we misspelled last issue), Mechner is hoping to create a game that is faithful to the spirit of the PRINCE OF PERSIA series while propelling it into a state-ofthe-art 3D extravaganza. As such, all the great traps, puzzles, and twitch-factor gaming that made the first two games so memorable will be here, only now you'll experience them from an immersive, over-theshoulder perspective. As he demonstrated in previous POP games and in his recent adventure game, Prince of Persia 3D RELEASE DATE: Q1 '99 DEVELOPER/ PUBLISHER: Red Orb Entertainment STYLE: Platform twitch action, puzzle solving, and swordplay THE LAST EXPRESS, Mechner is as concerned with giving gamers a coherent, entertaining story as he is with gameplay. Thus, the game's 15 levels will not only ramp up in difficulty through a series of diabolical puzzles to solve, they'll also tell an Arabian Nights-style story of love betrayed and found again. And don't worry if that sounds too civilized, there'll be plenty of challenging swordplay and bad guys to dismember as well. Mechner's track record is solid; look for the PRINCE to come roaring back in a big way in early 1999.

Since this game is all about action, your vehicle is a heavyduty destructive machine. You ride about in an experimental vehicle that can transform between a speedy hovercraft and a nimble mech. Many of the game's levels will be designed to take advantage of the strengths of the two different forms. There will be some cramped and densely populated levels full of enemies—ideal for the maneuverable and powerful mech. There will also be freeway chases and some expansive areas that will require the use of the fast hovercraft. There is no huge story to the game.

The F16, for instance, has the enhanced avionics package mounted on its spine. Flight models were still being tuned in the version I flew, and they didn't have the ultrafidelity of JANE'S F-15, but they were much more authentic than the USNF series. (See the \"A Team With Unique Experience\" sidebar for more details.) Each plane features a full cockpit modeled after the real plane. Avionics are somewhat simplified, although there are multiple air-toair and air-to-ground modes. According to Pixel's Aviv Yam Shahor, the goal was to provide realistic capabilities without requiring the gamer to study the manual for days before flying. \"All the jets carry the same radar interface and symbology. In fact, where we can, the keys are even the same. But not all modes are available on all jets, and radar Plane Jane's Flyable aircraft in the sim include the Mirage, Kfir G-7 (an Israeli-built design based on the Mirage), the F-4E Phantom, the F-4 2000 (a Phantom updated with modern avionics, the F-15 Eagle, F 16 Falcon, and the Lavi (an experimental Israeli design based loosely on the F-16). In network combat, you can also fly the MiG-23 and MiG-29. Many of the planes incorhile many companies have used fighter pilots as consultants or even designers, few have as many experienced fighter pilots actively involved in all aspects of creating the simulation. We talked to Ramy W. (name withheld for security reasons), CEO of Pixel; Aviv Yam Shahor, content expert and David Zerah and Yael Amir, executive producers of IAF, to get some background on the game's design. CGW: I understand a number of team members are active-duty or veteran IAF pilots. Can you describe the backgrounds of the team members? Also, which aircraft have the team members flown? W.: Unlike other air forces, in the Israeli Air Force, when you become a reserve pilot, you continue flying in your regular squadron, among the \"active duties,\" as long as you can keep kicking their butts. There are currently nine active IAF reserve pilots in Pixel. We have three F-15 pilots, three F-16 pilots, two Cobra pilots and an Apache pilot. Among us \"Pixel pilots,\" we've flown all the IAF game-controllable jets, including the MiG-29 and the MiG-23. Once a week, each one of us goes to the squadron and gets some training or real operational missions duties. I am sure that I can safely say that Pixel scores the highest number of active jet fighter hours among the game companies in the world. (Not to mention MiG and SAM kills....) Amir: The pilots are the leaders and key players in the creative teams, in charge of the missions, flight tactics, and the flight avionics. One is fully devoted to working with the aerodynamic engineer on the flight models and flight envelopes, and two are members of the simulation programming team. The Israeli Air Force is one of the more secretive in the free world. Have you had to get IAF clearance for anything that's going into the game? W.: This is very true about the IAF, and we, being a part of that service for so long, completely understand and think that this is the way it must be. That is why we invited security officers from IAF Intelligence over to Pixel from the beginning in order to show them the game. We had to give up on a few of the features that we had planned, but in return we were allowed, for the first time, to expose some historical missions and combat tactics, as well as squadron signs and colors and front-line Israeli weapon systems. What does Pixel's expertise bring to the table that makes LAF unique? W.: I think that, above all, it's this combination of cutting-edge technologies with this big team of active-duty pilots. The best example of this combination happened during the last alert period, when things were heating up in the Gulf and we were all called back to our squadrons (I had to cut a visit to EA). Not knowing how long it would take, we took our computers with us, and after a week of \"patrolling and waiting,\" we came back to Pixel with some of the best mission designs! Zerah: I think that for all the team, and the pilots in particular, this game is very special. You have to know that the IAF has been our home and family for 7 to 12 years (depending on the pilot) and, in many ways, still is. For us this game is our self-portrait and we have a lot of heart and pride of what it represents. It's us, you know? SAY LAVI You'll get a chance to pilot the Lavi fighter, an advanced Israeli fighter based on the F-16, which was canceled before it could go into full production. How realistic are the flight models in the game? Yam Shahor: All the flight models are accurate and tested by pilots with thousands of flight hours on each of the Israeli planes, and also by IAF test pilots who flew the Lavi, the MiG-29, and even the MiG-23 personally. The flight envelopes are generated out of the real performance tables of the jets in the game; special effects such as spins, stalls, and flicks are all modeled in the appropriated jets. An intermediate player can turn on the easy flight model modes and enjoy a more forgiving flight model. The use of force-feedback joysticks gives us the opportunity to enhance the feeling of flying the jets. For example, the F-16 and the Lavi are smooth flyers, while the F-15 and F-4 jets shake and rattle as the AOA builds toward the stall angle. 122 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

The limits of the systems are correct; terrain clutter terrain masking, and RCS are all modeled in the simulation engine, contributing to the real ism of the game and allowing players to benefit from correct flying tactics.\" minor limitations imposed on us by our [Israeli] Air Force intelligence security unit, of course. The enemy aircraft brains are programmed to fly low and use the terrain for cover. The planned flight routes are always taking the terrain into consideration. only when in line-of-sight, so it's extremely important to take advantage of the terrain.\" IAF will require a minimum of a Pentium 200MMX system with 32MB of RAM (64MB for optimum performance). The early version I've been flying shows a promising balance between realism and gameplay. The only major downside to this version was the texture shimmering, which bothered a number of CGW editors who tried the sim. I hope that this effect will be less noticeable in later builds as Pixel enhances the terrain detail. CGW MIG ALLEY In multiplayer missions you can fly a MiG-29 as you oppose Israeli forces. Terrain Following The most distinctive feature of IAF is its terrain engine. Based on stereoscopic satellite images of Israel and surrounding territory, the ground has unprecedented detail. Instead of using polygons to represent various elevations, elevation can change from pixel to pixel. Detail ranges from about 100 meters per pixel in some desert expanses, to 20 meters per pixel in many combat zones, all the way down to 2 meters per pixel in and around cities and targets. To this level of detail, add the game's Al planes, which properly use low-level combat techniques, and you have the makings of some very exciting dogfights through mountains and valleys. The downside of this technique is that it uses more than 300MB of texture data, far too much for 3D cards. So while the aircraft and special effects are rendered using 3D cards (3Dfx and ATI AGP cards are supported), the ground isn't. Because there's no hardware filtering, the textures have a shimmering effect (imagine the Dr. Katz artist doing a flight sim) that may bother some gamers, and it looks pretty pixelated in lower-detail areas. This is a necessary tradeoff to get unprecedented elevation detail, which wouldn't be possible using traditional polygons and 3D-compatible texturing methods. Pixel's David Zerah explains: \"Above all, the terrain was designed to allow us to actually duplicate the physical environment of the IAF flights in terms of bases, targets, border lines, and so on-well, with some PHANTOM PHASE TWO In historical missions, the sim models the F-4E Phantom. In the modern conflict, you can fly the F-4 2000. KFIR ME The Kfir C-7 was the first indigenous Israeli fighter; it's a fine-tuned Mirage III with a Phantom's J79 engine. HUMPBACK F-16 The aircraft in the game include some unique Israeli enhancements, such as the dorsal avionics spine on this F-16. 126 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1998 www.computergaming.com "

And those Novalogic jet sims. not to mention working analog arguments as to which is the better plane can finally be settled over the Internet skies of Novalogic's NovaWorld servers. VIPER and FULCRUM will initially be bundled together at the price of a single game; they may eventually be sold separately as well. Building on Experience Novalogic's first jet sim, F-22 LIGHTNING II, was a good seller but it met with a lackluster response from experienced sim players, who found that the sim's overly simple flight model didn't match claims of realism on the box, and who were disappointed with the game's lack of replayability. The company worked out a licensing deal with LockheedMartin for its next sim, F-22 RAPTOR. While still not \"hardcore\" by any means, RAPTOR featured a much-improved flight model and a somewhat improved campaign structure, in which your successes or failures could affect future missions. Most significant though, was the addition of NovaWorld, a free online massively multiplayer service which featured arenas supporting more than 100 RAPTOR players simultaneously. NovaWorld is where RAPTOR r eally shines. But there's been one problem with gameplay-everyone's flying the same aircraft, which limits the available strategies (not to mention suspension of disbelief). With the coming of both F-16 VIPER and MIG-29 FULCRUM to NovaWorld's skies, things should get much more interesting. VIPER and FULCRUM are based on the RAPTOR engine, but they feature significant improvements on that sim, including better-looking graphics, 3Dfx support, improved flight modeling, and a more sophisticated campaign. The game engine is essentially identical in VIPER and FULCRUM, with the primary difference being the aircraft model and its capabilities, and a different set of missions. The most noticeable improve ment in the games is in their graphics. Hardware support is included for 3Dfx cards. The sims FACING DOOM Here's the last thing many a MiG-29 pilot will see. The terrain in 3Dfx mode sports 16 times the detail found in Novalogic's previous jet sim. Neither game supports Direct3D or OpenGL, so users of non-3Dfx-based graphics cards will have to run the games using a software graphics engine. Even so, the terrain has four times the detail of F-22 RAPTOR's software engine, and 16-bit color eliminates much of the dithered look.

Although the changes to the sim will be primarily to enable play with the new games, look for some of the new sims' improvements to trickle down into RAPTOR for playbalancing purposes. For instance, RAPTOR's radar modeling will be made more realistic so as not to give the F-22 a bigger edge over the F-16 and MiG-29 than it would have in reality. also in contact with pilots who've flown the MiG-29 to verify the accuracy of the companion sim. temperature, and the F-16 flight computer will restrict your plane's angle of attack when the jet is heavily loaded. The flight model was designed with the assistance of the designer of Lockheed's F-16 simulator, and Novalogic plans to have real F-16 pilots review it before VIPER ships. The company is FACE-OFF The F-16 and MiG-29 will be able to battle head-to-head over modem, Internet, or localarea networks, or in large squadrons on the massively multiplayer NovaWorld server. Around the World VIPER will feature around 40 missions set in Bolivia, Armenia, Turkey, the Philippines, and one other geographic region that is yet to be decided. In FULCRUM, you'll fly missions for countries that have purchased MiG-29s from Russia. These are being developed with the assistance of Russian aviator Yuri Prikhodko, a cosmonaut and test pilot on the MiG-29, Su-27, and MiG-31 fighter programs. He's acting as a consultant on FULCRUM, and is helping to provide a perspective on what it's like to do combat from the other side. Novalogic strongly believes that human-scripted missions are more interesting and offer better gameplay than computer-generated sorties. Designers spend about a week on each individual mission before it goes into testing. The good news: Your successes and failures do affect the missions you'll be assigned later in the game. The bad news: As with previous Novalogic sims, you'll have to refly any missions you fail until you complete them successfully. Where the sims promise to shine is in the NovaWorld environment there, VIPER and FULCRUM players will be able to fly with RAPTOR owners in online arenas. It's hoped that Novalogic will create arenas with varying mixes of aircraft-it would be interesting to pit F-165 against MiG-29s without any F-22 \"superplanes\" in the mix. CGW team is modeling multiple air-toair and air-to-ground radar modes. Don't expect the level of detail or authenticity of FALCON 4.0 here, of course, but look for a good balance between realism and playability. Night missions in the F-16 should be particularly interesting, as VIPER will model the F-16's LANTIRN (Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting InfraRed for Night) targeting pod. F-22 RAPTOR's flight model was a dramatic improvement over Novalogic's first jet sim effort, and the company promises even more improvements here.

You can also bring up a variety of informational charts that show the number of sorties launched by each side, damage levels, priority targets, and the current strategy. Strategies are based on a \"fivering\" model employed during the Gulf War by the USAF. Imagine a bulls-eye with five rings, labeled from the outer to the inner ring as Fielded Military, Population, Infrastructure, Organic Essentials (fuel, oil, and the like), and Leadership. The outermost ring is the most vulnerable; the innermost is the most vital—and most heavily defended. Attacking the outermost layer--the military-isn't nearly as likely to demoralize the enemy as strikes against inner rings such as organic essentials or the command posts. This model relies on launching large-scale, parallel attacks on each layer of the ring. Col. John Warden, who helped implement this strategy in the Gulf War, and Col. Rich Reynolds, a USAF military doctrine analyst, consulted with DID to properly implement this model in TAW's campaign engine. The result is a campaign that features very realistic and logical sorties. DAY: 2 TIME: 152149 Threate details such as the Adeling Site ARMY!

H's Not an Add-on ID's distributor, Infogrames, has a dubious record when it comes to add-on sequels, especially in North America. For EF2000, its previous simulation, the company put out an add-on disc called TACTCOM, which added a mission editor and a number of other enhancements. TACTCOM sold for about  in the UK, and was necessary if you wanted to use the 3Dfx or Rendition graphics patches for EF2000. However, distributor Ocean declined to release TACTCOM in the U.S., so EF2000 owners looking for 3D acceleration were forced to buy EF2000 2.0-essentially purchasing the sim a second time. When DID first announced its F-22 game, it was going to include a dynamic campaign. Later the product was split into two parts: F22 ADF, which included a series of canned missions, and F22 TAW, which was supposed to be a low-cost add-on disc that would add the dynamic campaign elements to ADF. As work progressed on TAW, two things became clear. First, the product had grown in scope to the point where some fundamental changes to the engine made it less viable to do an add-on disc and second, retailers in North America are loath to carry low-profit add-ons to any but the most popular products. Thus, F22 TAW became a full-price, stand-alone product. DID assured ADF buyers that an upgrade or rebate would be available, but many sim fliers were annoyed after getting similar treatment with regard to EF2000. While the market forces that forced DID to reconsider doing TAW as an add-on are understandable, many customers have expressed frustration at the company making promises it can't keep. 136 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"by Loyd Case Photos by Michael Falconer ostant The Flight Control Gear You Need for Your Next Serious Furball erious flight-sim aficionados aspire to being there. The idea is to get as close as possible to the flight experience without climbing into a cockpit. (Well, there are an impassioned few who actually build cockpits, but that's another story.) What's more, combat flight simulators are becoming increasingly sophisticated and realistic. Titles such as DID's F22 ADF and JANE'S F-15 push the envelope in terms of flight models, sensor operation, and full-wing operation. This means, of course, that running the sim takes more keyboard commands than ever. Even the simpler sims are getting more sophisticated and complex. As a result, flight controllers-no longer mere «joysticks\" have gotten increasingly sophisticated, mirroring the games they enhance. There are a number of joysticks and other controller devices that try to satisfy the desires of those in pursuit of the total (virtual) flight experience. Below, we take a look at a number of flight-control setups, both old and new, and see how well they play in some of today's sims. Decisions, Decisions... No two sim players are the same. Some are more casual, wanting to boot up a sim occasionally and do some fun dogfighting. Others are much more serious, setting the game up to start at the airbase, getting into the intricacies of air-to-air refueling, and trying to work well in the context of multiple plane flights. Because of this, flight-control setups are intensely personal—what works for one user may be the bane of the next. And high-end systems have thrown another variable into the equation-some controllers don't work well with the new generation of fast Pentium Il systems. We'll keep all these issues in mind as we examine the force-feedback sticks, high-end sticks, throttles, and rudders that you may want to add to your collection for the utmost realism. "


"Forcing the Issue CH Force FX ast year was another of those \"This is the year of the...\" that didn't quite come to pass. In this case, it was supposed to be the year of the force-feedback game controller. In fact, we saw exactly one new product-Microsoft's SideWinder Force Feedback Pro. There was a dramatic price reduction in CH's Force FX, the only other existing consumer force-feedback product. Other controllers were delayed several times; maybe this year, we'll see more of them. Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro ***** T ith its $149 list price, VV you'd expect this stick to be a high-end flight controller, but it has more in common with its lesser sibling, the Precision Pro, than with high-end gear. As with the Precision Pro, it's an allin-one controller with an integrated throttle, a twist handle (for rudder function), and the same nine buttons. The first version of the SideWinder Force Feedback Pro (SFFP) had a really loud fan. We've heard reports that recent sticks have come sans fan, which would be a welcome relief. The utility for programming the SFFP is similar to Precision Pro's, but there's no force editor supplied, which seems a glaring omission. Support for the SFFP has been somewhat mixed. It's been widely supported in action games such as HEAVY GEAR and driving games like NEED FOR SPEED SE II, but support in flight sims has been less prevalent. A few, like SABRE ACE, come to mind, but support on high-end sims has been lacking. Without force-feedback support, the SFFP becomes a very expensive version of the Precision Pro. With better force feedback support in DirectX 6.0, perhaps we'll see more extensive use of force feedback in future sims. Of course, in some cases force-feedback support does not make much sense. In an F-16 you don't feel much force, except for G-forces on your hand, because the controls are fly-by-wire. In a World War I or II sim, though, force feedback properly done could significantly add to the experience. The SideWinder Force Feedback Pro is a clean, solidly implemented force-feedback stick-it's just not a particularly realistic flight stick. And it's too bad that it thinks it's the only controller in the universe. based on Immersion's 1.0 force-feedback API. Since then, Immersion has added a lot of capability to the second major revision of its programming interface and integrated it much more closely with the DirectInput API. In a reflection of more recent developments, CH has released DirectX 5 drivers for the FX and dropped the price to $99.95. The DirectX support is limited, since the capabilities of the stick itself maps more closely with the Immersion 1.0 API. Additionally. the motor isn't as powerful as the one in the SideWinder Force Feedback Pro. However, the FX now works with rudder pedals and throttle. Unlike the Microsoft stick, the Force FX can be part of a more realistic flight-control setup. At a hundred bucks, the Force FX might be worth the cost to experiment with force feedback. Bear in mind, though, that it's a limited implementation. Side Winder Force Feedback Pro, $149.95.

"FLIGHT CONTROLLERS Let's Get Real MOS ost flight sims out there have more controls than you could ever manage with a mere four-button joystick What's more, serious flight-sim jockeys want to get as close as they can to pure HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) in order to avoid the dreaded \"hunt-and-peck\" with a bogie hot on their six. Here again, there's a hefty amount of competent gear to be had, so it comes down to personal preference and the gear's feel. Trelaster F-16 TOUS SISTEM Thrust Master F-22 Pro The F-22 Pro is modeled after the F-16 block 50 flight stick It's massive, heavy, and stiff. The stiffness is intentional, the idea being to model the effort required to move the real thing. That real ism also helps you maintain control: Overshooting is more difficult with a stiff stick. Still, the F22 Pro can be a wrist wrangler in long game sessions. The stick has a glass-filled handle for a very solid feel, geared potentiometers for more precise control, and more hat switches than you can shake an AIM-9X at. The F-22 Pro comes with a set of DOS programming utilities. Ease of use is not their strong suit, but they get the job done. There are now at least two Windows-based graphical programming utilities for ThrustMaster gear, including Marlo Casabar's nicely done EZ Build. The F-22 is capable of holding up to four separate programs, although you need to run the DOS-based download utility to activate any given program.

"FLIGHT CONTROLLERS Whither USB and Force Feedback? The Pro Throttle originally shipped with DOS-based programming tools, but CH has since shipped SpeedyKeys, a Windowsbased tool that allows for \"pointand-click\" programming of the Pro Throttle. The Pro Throttle is a solid effort from CH. If you don't need something that looks as if it was ripped out of a fighter cockpit, this throttle will give you years of service. CH Products Jane's Combat Stick and F-16 Combat Stick Pro Throttle, Price: $189.95. Contact: CH Products, (760) 598-2518; www.chproducts.com PROS: Smooth sliding motion; hefty palm-rest. CONS: Not the most realistic throttle around CH Products Pro Throttle The Pro Throttle makes no claims at looking or behaving realistically—but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Instead of using an arced throttle movement, the Pro Throttle mounts on a big slider. The result is a very smooth movement that makes it easy to replicate spe. cific settings when sliding back and forth. This eliminates the need for idle and afterburner detents. in the ThustMaster models; others prefer the light, precise feel of the CH line. For casual flying, except when flying something like JANE'S F-15, where using an F-22 Pro seems like the right thing to do, I find most of my joystick time is spent with the F-16 Combat Stick. Both sticks vaguely resemble the stick in the F-16 Fighting Falcon, though not to the level of detail of the ThrustMaster versions. The button placement makes these models useful for righthanders only. There are a pair of hat switches, four buttons, a trig. ger switch, and a throttle slider. As with most CH sticks, the F-16 series also has trim controls, a godsend if you need to do a quick recalibration while in a furball. The two sticks have much the same feel a long throw coupled with a light action and precise centering. Both now have Directinput drivers, a boon when you're playing DirectInput-aware Windows 95 games. You can set up keystroke assignments within the game for all the buttons, not just two or four. Both sticks offer solid value, are extremely durable, and are easy to set up and use. Saitek X36 ** *** aitek burst onto the high-end flight stick scene last year with its X36 combo pack. Unpack the fairly compact box and you find a massive throttle unit and a joystick that looks like something that could have been in a Star Wars Bwing bomber. The stick even has a knuckle guard—just the thing to repel boarders, I suppose. As with a lot of high-end sticks, the Saitek gear is programmable. Early versions of the X36 programming software were a little clumsy, but it's been improved. One minor issue: The cable that emerges from the required keyboard pass-through can make it hard to plug into some ATX-style motherboards, so exercise a little caution when you install it. The throttle unit is even bigger than the ThrustMaster TQS, though it feels more comfortable. There's a rocker switch on the underside for rudder functionality, if you already have rudders, you can deactivate it through the download software. Like the TQS, the Saitek has idle and afterburner detents. The Saitek stick works with DOS games in a Windows 95 DOS box and even in plain old DOS, though the programming software works only in Windows 95. A DOS utility can download Saitek programs to the stick from the had the chance to chat with Bob Wudeck (Logitech's joystick product manager) and Patrick Hewitt (Thrust Master's point man on flight controllers) and got their thoughts on USB, human interface devices, and force feedback. Both agreed that the key point of USB is to standardize connectivity and get away from the limitations of the PC game port. Wudeck made the point that you could actually mix multiple controllers from different vendors. Think of it. If you like the TQS throttle from ThrustMaster, you're locked into the FLCS or F-22 Pro. Wouldn't it be great to have a TQS and a stick like Suncom's Talon? Hewitt noted that with multiple devices connected each with multiple axes you would no longer be constrained by the four-axis limitation of the PC game port. Also, USB devices would identify themselves to the application and the operating system, making it easier for game programmers to have \"instant customizability.\" Another interesting issue is two-way communication, vital for force-feedback sticks. With two-way communication, you could have an \"active\" MFD with an LCD display, combined with a touch-screen. Finally, Wudeck pointed out that force feedback makes software design even more critical, to avoid the \"joystick on a motor\" effect. It's likely that force designers may become key members of some game design teams. So it's looking as if the future of USB and force feedback is bright. The goal now is to get proper software support. For that, you'll need Windows 98 and DirectX 6—which means yet another software upgrade cycle.

"FLIGHT CONTROLLERS four complex sims at a time, so this may not be a major issue to a lot of people. The Talon is big, modeled after the actual stick in the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. As such, users with small hands might have problems reaching the switches and buttons high on the stick. The overall feel of this stick is superb. Suncom uses something it calls Direct Drive. The stick's resistance is the same in all directions, including the corners, making for a much more predictable response. The Talon behaved very well in several different sims. Given the solid feel of the Talon and its relatively low price, it's a worthwhile contender for your joystick dollar. Saitek X36 F-15E Talon, Price: $59.95. Contact: Suncom, (847) 229-0002; www.suncominc.com PROS: Great feel; easy programmability, relatively low price. CONS: Can't hold more than four pro grams, can't store programs offline; not for small hands; no real integrated throttle. DOS prompt or a DOS batch file. Like many of these keyboard pass-through devices, the X36 had some problems with fast keyboard controllers. Saitek has posted an updated driver that should fix this problem. The overall feel of the stick is just a little mushy, it doesn't center as crisply as the F-22 Pro, or even the Combat Stick. The button place. ment works fairly well, although the master weapons flip-up is a bit goofy. The hat switches seem pretty solid, and the pinky trigger button is a nice touch. The throttle feels very solid, and finding the same position is fairly easy; the knobs and buttons seem well placed. The rudder control seems counterintuitive, but I'm a diehard rudder pedals user. The X36 is a solid combination for the price, so if your wallet has been groaning at the thought of the F-22 Pro, consider the X36. Suncom F-15E Talon Suncom F-15E Talon * * * * * The first thing you notice about the Talon is its size. In truth, it's slightly smaller than the F-22 Pro, but it looks more massive. The base even has a smaller desk footprint than the F-22 Pro's, but it's nicely weighted. It uses a keyboard pass-through to execute keyboard commands. Programming the stick is interesting-and easy. There's no programming software or downloads to worry about. Instead, you simply put the stick into programming mode, then press each button, followed by the keystroke combination you want. Changes can be made on the fly, too. The Talon can hold up to four different programs. The downside is you can't have more than four programs presentadding another game means you have to replace an existing setup.

"FLIGHT CONTROLLERS Suncom Strike Fighter Series Throttle * * * * * Suncom Strike Fighter Series Throttle ike the F-15E Talon, also from Suncom, the SFS Throttle looks like a serious piece of hardware-and it is. The last time I saw a throttle like this, I was sitting in the right seat of a twin-engine bush plane weaving through the fiords of New Zealand. Each half of the throttle takes up one joystick axis—and therein lies its chief weakness. The second throttle uses the axis normally used by rudder pedals. This throttle also proves to be problematic when paired up with a Thrust Master FCS-style stick, in which the hat takes up a joystick axis. However, there is a button on the throttle that deactivates the left half. Suncom also wisely supplies a Windows 95 .INF file that adds various custom setups, both with and without the left throttle, in the joystick control panel applet. Programming the throttle is much like programming the F-15E Talon flight stick. First, put the throttle into program mode. Next, press and hold the button you want to program; then press the keystroke combination on the key board. Release the button, and it's programmed. Unfortunately, the SFS Throttle holds only two programs. There have been reports of chorded (multiple simultane ous) keystrokes not being recognized by games, but I didn't expe rience this problem. As with the TQS and Saitek throttles, there are idle and afterburner detents, though the stops feel a bit vague. The throttle has a big desk footprint and comes with suction cups to hold it firmly to your desktop. While this throttle works very well with the F-15E Talon, it also works well with any standard, nonprogrammable joystick. Given its price, you might consider buying one even if you have rudder pedals and don't want to use the left throttle. It works pretty well, and it looks like something any multiengine fighter pilot would feel right at home with. Quickshot Master Pilot & Master Pilot Programmer * * * * * SFS Throttle, Price: $89.95. Contact: Suncom, (847) 229-0002; www.suncominc.com PROS: Easy programmability, way cool looking; works with most sticks. CONS: Can hold only two programs; takes two game port axes. Rating 4.0 3.5 4.5 Another cool add-on for seriA ous fly-boys is Quickshot's Master Pilot/MasterPilot Programmer combination. The Master Pilot resembles a miniature MFD (multifunction display), with buttons surrounding the \"display.\" In fact, the display area is for cardboard key templates. The Master Pilot Programmer (MPP) is an essential addition, and is a basically an EEPROM burner whose programming interface is simplicity itself. You use the Windows-based program to highlight a representation of a Master Pilot button, type in the key sequence, then go to the next button. You can save files and download them later. You can store multiple programs (up to five) in one cartridge. Using the Master Pilot is a snap.

As it stands now, Matrox's G200 looks the bi-directional 64-bit data transfers can to be the fastest 2D/3D card around for a run as fast as, or faster than, some 128-bit few weeks, anyway. -Loyd Case 3Dfx Banshee This will be 3Dfx's first integrated 2D/3D accelerator. The Banshee will also be 3Dfx's first large-scale entrée into the lucrative OEM/system makers side of the graphics business, in which about two-thirds of all graphics chips are sold. Performance numbers on the as-yet-unannounced part are very sketchy, but we've heard rumors that its 2D performance will be very competitive, which was a weakness in 3Dfx's Voodoo Rush chipset. ETA: Q4 '98 Uh-Oh: nVidia Hit with Double-Whammy Litigation FireWire Also known, as IEEE 1394, this is a highbandwidth bus (400Megabits/sec, or 50 Megabytes/sec) that will support high-quality digital video, hard drives, and other storage devices. All FireWire devices will be hot-swappable, meaning you can attach/detach devices and immediately be able to use them while your machine is still turned on. ETA: Q4 '98 AMD K6 3D+ AMD's next X86 CPU will feature AMD's own set of floating-point instruction extensions designed specifically to accelerate Direct3D's geometry engine. These new instructions could very well give AMD a floating-point performance edge over Intel-an industry first-at least until Intel's Katmai processors ship. ETA: Q2 '98 hip maker nVidia has been riding high on the success of its RIVA 128 2D/3D accelerator, and with its RIVA 128ZX now shipping, and the TNT accelerator on the horizon, it would seem nVidia is the company to beat nowadays. But all is not well in RIVA-land. The company has been served with separate lawsuits from 53 and SGI, and while nVidia states that it will \"vigorously defend\" itself in both cases, this litigation could stall shipments of RIVA 128ZX parts and delay the rollout of TNT parts later this fall. S3 has alleged that nVidia has infringed on three patents pertaining to VGA control circuitry (acquired from Cirrus Logic), scalable video windows, and methods for mixing video and graphics data. Based on that last charge, we're waiting for S3 to sue everyone else in the graphics universe, as well. It's too early to say whether this litigation has any teeth, but according to Michael Hara, nVidia's business development manager, \"The mood here is very upbeat, and we're focusing on getting the RIVA TNT out.\" A preliminary injunction to halt shipments of all RIVA processors could be imposed as you read this. On the 3D front, SGI has filed a lawsuit alleging that nVidia has infringed upon SGI intellectual property (IP) regarding an implementation of texture caching and texture interpolation. In return, nVidia asserts that SGI's lawsuit is motivated by vendetta, because several 3D architects have left SGI to join nVidia, and that these former SGI employees \"had no involvement in the design of nVidia's current RIVA graphics processors, which are the subject of the alleged patent infringement.\" Again, the outcome of this lawsuit is still very much up in the air, but if a court rules in favor of SGI or S3 in either of these cases, it could cast a very dark cloud over nVidia's 1998 outlook, not to mention its pending IPO.-Dave Salvator Intel Katmai Intel's next round of CPUs, with anticipated clock speeds of 450-500MHz. In additional to the higher clock speed, Katmai CPUs will also feature what Intel has clumsily dubbed \"Katmai New Instructions,\" a name given to avoid calling these new instruction-set extensions MMX2. Among the other things these instructions will speed up will be Direct3D's geometry engine (in DX6), allowing these CPUs to crank more polygons per second. ETA: Q4 '98 Intel IA-G4 Intel's next-next-generation of processors will be a substantial departure from its traditional X86 CISC-based architecture. This new 64-bit CPU will use a new set of Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) instructions, and use a technology termed EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) to facilitate execution of instructions in parallel.

"UNDER THE HOOD Stupid Human Tricks HARDWA Or, Brilliant Boneheaded Blunders Revealed I tried all kinds of things, including installing updates, uninstalling features, and so on. Nothing worked. I began contemplating either moving to Nepal or restoring Windows 95 to my system. The situation got so bad that one you actually did it. Always go back and check the obvious. I positively knew I couldn't do something as dumb as forgetting to remove the termination jumpers. Oh, well. hen I get a technical question, it often begins, \"I think I may have done something really stupid.\" This usually revolves around some kind of installation issue. All I can say to any of you is that if you think you've done something stupid, well, you've got nothing on me. I've committed more than my share of great gaffes—worse, I've done some of them over and over again. Here are a few of my... uh... favorites my system case. I slapped in the new drive and boxed up the old one to send to the vendor. You may imagine my unprintable mutterings about incompetent harddrive companies. I rebooted, and everything worked for a bit. Then the hard drive seized up—the new one, that is. I stared at my still-open case, and then ripped out the removable drive bay and closely examined the two hard drives. Guess what? They were both terminated. Here I was, with two SCSI drives in the middle of the chain, and the termination was active on both. After doing a Charlie Brown and banging my The PIIX4 Mystery Patch Windows 95, up through OSR 2.5, doesn't really understand the PIIX4 chip. This chip is part of the Intel 430TX, 440LX, and 440BX chipsets. In the course of performing so many product tests, I get to install Windows 95. A lot. So there I am, swearing at the system because of some weird glitch, like an IRQ not being assigned to a graphics card that LOYD CASE Simply because you knew the right thing to do, doesn't mean you actually did it. The Mystery of the Hard Drive Lockup Recently, I installed Windows 98 Release Candidate 2 on my production system. (Those of you who are wincing are right-what the heck was I thinking?) After the install, my system mysteriously began locking up. Usually, one of my two hard drives would seize up. I thought I had a hard-drive problem, and I thought it was because of Windows 98, so Saturday afternoon, I rushed out to a computer shop and bought a new hard drive. As many of you know, I use SCSI peripherals. So here I was, in the heat of anger, ripping open head on the wall, I removed the termination jumpers, and every thing has worked perfectly since. The moral of the story is this: Simply because you knew the right thing to do, doesn't mean Email Notes s you can probably guess, I get tons of email. The messages take one of several forms, for the most part. There's the \"Can you answer this question,\" in which people try to get a little tech support-which is a sad commentary on the state of companies' own tech support. Then there's the \"What [insert device here) should I buy?\" Most often, these concern either whole systems or 3D graphics cards. Finally, there's the \"Did you know...?\" in which people let me in on their favorite new gear (I love these messages) I like reading email, and I respond to most of it. However, I want to lay down a few ground rules. First, if you have some kind of technical question, please tell me your system specs. If you don't, I'll have to ask you in a reply, which makes the process harder than it has to be. Second, include your complete email address in the header, so I can just hit \"reply.\" I promise on a stack of CGW's that I won't turn your address over to spammers. Finally, if you're telling me about something cool, give me a contact, whether it's a phone number or a URL. Oh, by the way, loyd@uncertainty.com is my brand new email address. requires it. Every time this happens, I go to the Device Manager, and discover a host of system devices under the dreaded \"?\" heading. Ya know, minor things like the PCI bus, or the PCI-to-ISA bridge. Naturally, I scratch my head, then I realize that I haven't installed the PIIX4 patch. And this happens to me nearly every damned time. This \"patch\" is really just an INF file that describes the motherboard resource list to Windows 95. Without it, Windows uses its own files, which are now outdated. Most system and motherboard vendors supply a floppy or CD with the PlIX4 update.

"REVIEW. TURTLE BEACH MONTEGO Turtle Beach Hits a High Note HARDWAR by Loyd Case ureal's A3D positionalaudio technology is slowly seeping into more mainstream hardware. The Montego is the latest card to boast Aureal's new Vortex chip, a single-chip imple mentation of the ABD architecture. It supports DirectSound 3D acceleration, runs most DOS titles, and CGW Labs MIDI quality; the best setting uses more system RAM, but the sound quality is pretty good. Horns were a bit lacking, but the acoustic piano sounded fine. Since I attached a Roland SCD-15 Sound Canvas daughtercard to the Montego, it was easy to do an A/B comparison. The Montego's highest quality sounds weren't quite up to the Roland's standards, but they were still pretty darned good. The game-quality sounds held their own. Digital audio is good, and the card supports full duplex audio. The A3D implementation seems quite effective; JEDI KNIGHT never sounded so real. The digital sound is really clean-cranking up the volume with no signal yielded only a barely audible hiss. DOS compatibility when booting to the DOS prompt seemed pretty good. I did experience one crash with Rage Software's INCOMING demo—it consistently generated a DirectSound error. One downside to the Montego is that I couldn't get the ThrustMaster Rage 3D gamepad to work with the game port, although the Microsoft digital sticks worked. Analog joysticks didn't have any problems. Just make sure your controller works with this card before you get it. Overall, the Montego is a cleansounding, solid implementation of ABD audio, with good DOS support to boot. I'm a little concerned about the drivers, but other than with INCOMING, I had no problems with the card. CGW APPEAL: Gamers waiting for a costeffective PCI-based ABD card. PROS: Robust MIDI:clean digital audio; amazing A3D effects. CONS: Some digital joysticks may not work: drivers may have some bugs. Price: $129.95 Manufacturer: Turtle Beach/Voyetra (800) 233-9377 even sports a MIDI daughtercard connector, for those of us who still love our Roland SCD-15s. The Montego is a tiny card, but its size belies the sound that comes out of it. Like many modern PCI sound cards, the Montego uses system memory to store the wavetable samples, but MIDI music is a full hardware implementation. There are several settings in the Montego's control panel for www.voyetra.com REVIEW STB VELOCITY 128ZX Velocity 128ZX Bobs and Weaves by Loyd Case few months in the 3D card business changes everything or so it sometimes seems. When we reviewed the original STB Velocity 128 last November, we were impressed with its combination of speed and features. Since then, STB has improved the Velocity even more, fixing many of its initial image-quality problems, Here's the good: 2D perforabling v-sync, I ran it with monimance seems even snappier than tor refresh rate set at 120Hz.

"LOYD CASE Tech Tips GET SCREWED This curious little gadget mounts under some new motherboards to provide support. Windows Intallation Made Easy Reinstalling Windows is a headache. It's a headache, because you usually need to have all your driver disks and any Windows updates. I've finally seen the light, and I now use a partition image tool. These utilities will take a snapshot of an entire partition (or even disks with multiple partitions). If you need to get back to a known good state, then you can just reinstall the snapshot of the partition (assuming no hardware has changed). I install Windows, all my drivers, and all my applications. I then take a snapshot of the partition. It's as easy as that. Good examples of partition image tools include Drive Image, by PowerQuest (www.powerquest.com), and Ghost, by Binary Research (www.ghostsoft.com). Note that Ghost is a professional tool, and a 10user license (the minimum) costs about $200. Drive Image comes in a personal edition for around $60. Continued from 157 asks for the Windows CD and installs new drivers. After several reboots, things usually are working fine. I like ASUS motherboards is that they glue the bracket screws onto the motherboard, so I can never forget them. Mea Culpa and All That... So if you find yourself feeling dumb, just remember the socalled tech guy here at CGW. You may think you've pulled a real boneheaded move-but I betcha I can match it. CGW The Drivers Are Here It's OpenGL driver season, but don't shoot them. Instead, check out the new drivers from STB, Canopus, and Diamond for their RIVA 128 cards (full ICD support). The Stealth Il now has a mini-GL driver. ATI has a beta driver on its site that works reasonably well (www.atitech.ca). If you have an Intel 740 card, you should check with your vendor, because their ICD may well be out. THUNDERSEAT www.thunderseat.net 1-800-8-Thunder The Pentium II Support Bracket I've probably installed and set up several dozen Pentium II systems by now. If you've taken a close look at a Pentium II motherboard, you'll notice that the CPU is held in place by a vertical bracket. You slide the Pentium II slot one cartridge into the bracket and it snaps into place. If you're a suspenders-and-belt kind of human (or you have an unusually heavy fan), you might also install the fan support bracket. The Pentium Il support bracket is fastened to the motherboard with a weird little plastic gizmo that has two screws attached to it. You insert these into the underside of the motherboard, straddling the slot one socket. You then screw down the bracket into the screws (see the picture) About 9 times out of 10,1 screw the motherboard into the case, only to discover that I've neglected to insert the @#$%& screw gizmos, which means the support bracket has no way of being fastened down. I have to completely remove the motherboard and install the blasted things.

"REVIEW. DIAMOND MONSTER3D II Revenge of the Monster HARDWA Diamond Returns with a Solid Voodoo2 Performer DIAMONU by Dave Salvator iamond put itself on the 3D graphics map nearly two years ago with its 3Dfx Voodoobased Monster3D. Along with Orchid's Righteous 3D, Monster3D was the king of the heap, and the 3D card to have. In bringing out its Monster3D II, Diamond opens itself to a fair question: Can the company deliver a repeat performance? The answer is a qualified yes. The Voodoo?-based Diamond's version 1.01 driver release seemed to remedy that problem. First off, it has to be said that if you're big-time into QUAKE II, then 3Dfx's Voodoo is most likely in your future. Diamond's implementation comes in either an 8MB or 12MB configuration, and you can buy a second board with the same memory configuration and run the two together using 3Dfx's scan-line interleave (SLI) technology. Of course, two boards eat two PCI slots, so that may not be an option if you have SRO in your rig (not to mention the added cost). SOLID AS A ROCK The Diamond Monster3D Il rates as a solid performer across all categories. The second-generation Monster3D II is no slouch when it comes to accelerating Direct3D, with very solid 3D GameGauge scores running at both 640x480 and 800x600. Monster3D II does the job, though we did encounter a few bumps in the road running two boards in SLI mode (which Diamond calls its MegaMonster configuration). Installation is pretty straightforward: Plug the board into an open PCI slot, fire up your system, and feed a driver CD and you should be good to go. In our early testing, we saw some lockups running 3D WinBench with two boards in SLI mode, though in terms of numbers, there aren't really any big surprises here. Clearly, for QUAKE and QUAKE II, a Voodoo--based board is the thing to have. And the second-generation Monster3D II is no slouch when it comes to accelerating Direct3D, with very solid 3D GameGauge scores running at both 640x480 and 800x600. Also when I ran the Glide versions of F22 and TUROK, I saw several impressive jumps, most notably with two boards running in SLI. One thing to appreciate is the Monster3D il's frame-rate of 142.6fps running FORSAKEN at 640x480 on a single board. This is a pretty absurd number when taken as only a frame-rate, but it shows that the Voodoo chipset has lots of headroom. Monster3D Il's solid performance, coupled with a bundle that includes BATTLEZONE and INCOMING (as well as a sampler of five EA titles), makes for a solid offering. And while a second board will deliver more performance, it's debatable how necessary that option really is.

The only potential problem stems from the A, B, C and X, Y, Z buttons being set a little high on the face of the controller, so it's easy to mistake the button for the Z button in the heat of battle. But this minor annoyance is offset by the presence of the proportional directional pad, which has a smooth, joystick like feel. It is much less tiring than the traditional d-pad in long game sessions (although the Xterminator has the traditional pad as well, should you want to use it).

You'll battle other interstellar looters and a huge variety of mechanical monstrosities in your quest for untold riches. Weapons, armor, and power-ups are all yours for the taking, whether you stumble across them or pick them up off the biker you just fragged. at any time. Frustrating? Yes, especially when game load times some times approached 20 seconds on my P200 rig with its 12x CD-ROM drive. Thankfully, available weaponry is plentiful and can be downright amazing. My current favorite is the \"Pine Mine,\" a floating missile platform that ignores the depositor while blowing the bejesus out of any enemy in the vicinity. by Gordon Goble f the extensive, and somewhat mysterious, PR campaign surrounding Acclaim's new 3D blastest, FORSAKEN, has piqued your interest there's a good chance you've got the same basic question everyone else seems to have: \"When do I get to play with that woman on the box?\" FORSAKEN is reminiscent of DESCENT, with lots of blasting and flying through confining corridors, caves, and rooms. And yes, it's a gorgeous game, a visual showpiece more breathtaking than EXTREME ASSAULT and far less gloomy than its title might suggest. But, sadly, the startlingly attractive woman Acclaim has displayed prominently throughout its hype and plastered all over the box cover has nothing to do with gameplay. The back-story in FORSAKEN assumes Earth's surface is now a smoldering shell, thanks to one too many subatomic experiments. You EAT IVY DUST This is Nubia, one of the many intergalactic mercenaries you compete against to plunder the treasures in the bowels of our irradiated Earth. She's a Beauty Speaking of blowing up stuff, FORSAKEN is indeed a cataclysmic affair.

And even then, the visuals are not nearly as Too Tough to Handle The game features 15 linear, yet marginally confounding, levels some of which have time restrictions. Veteran first-person gamers will want to note that FORSAKEN IS so chock-full of evil that even \"Easy\" mode is tough, with more airborne craft, ground vehicles, fixed emplacements, and explosive mines than you can shake a Pyrolite Rifle at. Even worse, FORSAKEN's adversaries have a penchant for materializing out of thin air. And although they will pursue you and dodge approaching ordnance, there is no rhyme or reason to their travels. Worse still, fixed guns sometimes appear in previously \"cleaned\" rooms, mines sometimes pop up only as you pass over them, and collapsing roofs come into sight only after you proceed beneath them. This is one dastardly title, made bearable only by the fact that game saves can be executed CGW Rated 1950 SHINE A LIGHT ON ME With 3D acceleration, the graphics are spectacular, featuring lots of great lighting, translucencies, shading, and all sorts of visual goodies. Without acceleration, however, FORSAKEN is far from breathtaking. M APPEAL: Gamers who want to exploit their 3D accelerators; DESCENT junkies who need a more explosive fix. PROS: Big weapons, bigger graphics, and huge lighting, continuous action; convincing \"true\" 3D environment: bigtime multiplayer fun.

"REVIEW MIGHT AND MAGIC VI: THE MANDATE OF HEAVEN CGW EDITOR'S CHOICE Heaven Sent The Classic M&M RPG Series Makes a Triumphant Return COMPUTER GAMING WORLD ADVENTURER PAGE by Scorpia t's been so long since a new MIGHT & MAGIC was released that fans of the popular fantasy role-playing series were beginning to fear that they would never see one again. There was plenty of talk, but nothing in the way of product, as New World Computing shifted its focus to the HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC strategy games instead. Now, MIGHT AND MAGIC VI: THE MANDATE OF HEAVEN is here at last, and there is, indeed, much to talk about The storyline, set in the HEROES world of Enroth, is typical RPG fare: King Roland of the Ironfist line has disappeared; in the wake of his disappearance has come a multitude of bad omens, disasters, evil cults, and hordes of monsters roaming the countryside. People he or she can learn (and cast) spells from it. It's the same for weapons and armor. You must have the sword skill, for instance, before you can even equip a sword, or chain skill before you can wear chain-mail armor. There are more complications, however. Just having these skills isn't enough; they must be improved over time. Skills have ranks-starting at 1-and these ranks determine how well the person does when using the skill. Improving skills is done with points obtained when you level up. The trick is, the number of points required increases every time you advance a level, making skill improvement a very slow process. Character creation has changed greatly in the light of this new skill system. There is no more dicerolling. When you choose a profession, it comes with preset statistics (the familiar group of might, intellect, personality, speed, luck, endurance, and accuracy) and two skills. You then pick two more starting skills for the character from a list that varies by class. Finally, you increase the stats of your choice for all four characters BATTLE ZONE The game's turn-based/real-time combat mode works surprisingly well, and the enemy sprites look great even when viewed in extreme close-up. are even beginning to think that the Ironfist dynasty has lost \"the mandate of heaven,\" its divine right to rule. CGW Rated skill-based system. Everything is now a skill. You can't cast a spell, wield a sword, or wear armor without the appropriate skill. Sorcerer magic has been split into the four schools of earth, air, fire, and water-each considered a separate skill. Likewise, cleric magic is divided among mind, body, and spirit. A character must have the skill in that school of magic before APPEAL: All fanlight Magic VII tasy RPG fans, especially MIGHT AND MAGIC groupies. PROS: Epic game; challenging gameplay: immersive 3D graphics; great turn-based/real-time combat system; addictive. CONS: Characters start out too weak and advance slowly, all races eliminated from previous games except humans, game is balanced very tough against players. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 90, Windows 95 or NT, 16MB RAM, 200MB hard drive space, 4x CDROM, PCI 1 MB VRAM graphics card, sound card. 3D SUPPORT: None MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: None Price: $49.95 Developer. New World Computing Publisher: 300 Redwood City, CA (415) 261-3000 www.3do.com Everything Old Is New Again The basic framework is standard MIGHT & MAGIC, familiar to all who have played the series. Your party of adventurers visits various towns and castles to take on quests for glory, money, goodies, and—what's most importantexperience. Beyond that, however, much has changed. Party size has been reduced from six to four persons. Human is the only race available; you can say goodbye to those Half-Orc knights and Elven mages. Professions have also been downsized to six: knight, paladin, archer, cleric, sorcerer, and druid. These classes do retain their abilities. Paladins still get cleric spells, archers learn sorcerer magic, and druids combine both cleric and sorcerer abilities. But, despite the downsizing, life isn't as simple as it used to be. The really big change is the move to a BUMPS IN THE ROAD MIGHT AND MAGIC VI's new 3D engine and the game's roving inhabitants help create a real sense of immersion into the world of Enroth. 180 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"EVERYTHING IS now a skill. You can't cast a spell, wield a sword, or wear armor without the appropriate skill. peekaboo to draw them out and fight them one or two at a time. It goes on dungeon after dungeon, making an already huge game unnecessarily longer. Dangerous heroes need dangerous toys: pow. erful weapons and potent spells that work consistently. Without them, combat becomes a burden i nstead of a pleasure. The skill system isn't a bad idea, but given the reduced party size The automap, while very nice, could use a note-taking facility. I often wished I could mark down where a trainer, person with a quest, or someone who bought special items resided. Some towns are quite big, and you can't always remember exactly where they are. But, overall, though some of its features could use some tweaking, MIGHT & MAGIC VI is a welcome game indeed. There is a pretty broad hint at the end that there will be a Part VII; when it shows up, we'll hope that its gameplay is somewhat better balanced toward the player side. In the meanwhile, MIGHT & MAGIC fans have an epic here that should keep them busy for months to come. CGW ADVENTURER PAGE right displays your immediate surroundings. With the Wizard Eye spell active, it also shows locations of people as green squares, hostiles as red ones, and goodies to pick up as blue ones. The world map displays the entire sector or dungeon level, but only those parts you've already visited. Dungeon maps-black and white draw ings-can be scrolled in four direc tions, and you can also zoom in for close-ups, which are handy for the more complicated layouts. Graphically, MIGHT AND MAGIC Vi's new look is quite good. Monsters and people hold definition well in close-ups, and there is a definite 3D feel to the outdoors. The flat look of the earlier games is gone. The music is equally good and doesn't get on your nerves. A tune plays for several minutes when you first enter a location, then fades away. You don't hear music again unless you restore a game or cross a boundary, such as entering or leaving a dungeon, or moving from one sector to another. from a pool of 50 bonus points. To learn any new skills, you'll have to join the appropriate guild and pay a (usually inexpensive) fee. to be learned, the points should be more generous. And it's silly to require skills for everything. Characters should be able to at least use permitted weapons or armor without skill, even if they can't use it very well. Stace he Healer Cures a p l points once of all guide you find Cures air lakes 5 percent @ @ @ Olle Mad Monster Party The next big change is that towns are no longer monsterinfested lairs. For the first time in the series, people walk the streets and live in the houses. You can even talk to them. Conversations are limited, though; generally, people have only small bits of information to relate. It's necessary to check all the buildings, however, since that's where trainers, guild memberships, and the occasional person with a quest are found. Combat, as you may have heard, can be in realtime or turnbased. Given the speed and zigzag movement of most opponents. turn-based is the mode of choice most of the time. Simply hitting the Enter key initiates turn-based combat-although if a monster was already shooting off a spell or missile, that action will complete before everything freezes. The party can't move, except to turn in place, while the turn mode is active. Monsters, however, can move freely around the area when their own turns come up. Of course, you can hit Enter again at any time to break out of turn mode, at which point you can either flee or move around at will. The gameworld is unbelievably huge, and traveling around the land is accomplished by various methods: taking passage on a ship: hiring a coach; walking; or using those two old spellbook favorites, Town Portal and Lloyd's Beacon. The game sports a new look in its maps, too. A small one in the upper IT'S MY PARTY Although party size has been reduced from six to four, you can now hire NPCs who will follow you around and provide special bonuses. Someone Heal Me MANDATE OF HEAVEN is difficult, primarily because you have a weaker party than in earlier games. It's smaller in size, and the characters never quite have the power they had before. I missed the ruby chain mail, the diamond plate, and, most especially, obsidian weapons. Weapons here have been scaled down almost to a mundane level. The spells also seem weaker. Protection/Enhancement spells previously lasted until the party rested or the next dawn, whichever came first. Now, their duration is in hours, tied to the magic skill used t o cast them, and time in this game passes very swiftly, indeed. Offensive spells fare no better, mostly because they're inconsistent. It's frustrating to hit a monster for 100 points one round, and on the next-same monster, same spell—do only 10. This is a serious matter, because the dungeons, especially the later ones, are full of high-level opponents with high-level hit points.

"M1 TANK PLATOON IL REVIEW Platoon Too Soon Despite a Long Gestation, This Combat Sim Is Not Ready for Prime Time LULATION SPACE by Patrick C. Miller In February 1991, the M1 Abrams main battle tank played a decisive role in quickly ending the Persian Gulf War. Its high-tech combination of speed, firepower, and armor protection proved devastatingly lethal in the hands of well-trained and well-led American tankers. Years of refinements and improvements helped the M1 shake its early image as a costly lemon and earn its title as King of the Killing Fields. In 1943, the German Army rushed its Panther medium tank out of production and into battle. Initially plagued by technical problems, the Panther was a disappointing performer during its combat debut at the battle of Kursk. However, with improvements, it went on to earn a reputation as one of the best tanks of World War II. example, the manual says that a tank platoon can be divided into sections, but this isn't the case. The War College library and training clips are helpful, but they don't provide nearly enough detail. Even more confusing, the game's READ.ME file advises players to ignore the commands listed in the manual and use the quickreference card instead. Unfortunately, several important keyboard commands listed on the card don't work. And many gamers have reported that some buttons and hat switches are nonfunctional on brand name joysticks. THE KING Derided in the popular press as too expensive and unreliable, the M1A2 has proven itself to be a lethal adversary in combat. But in M1 TANK PLATOON II, the opposition is better equipped and more willing to fight than were the Iraqis in '91. 25 DOGA If MicroProse's M1 TANK PLATOON was the Abrams of 1989, then M1 TANK PLATOON II is the Panther of 1998. The original simulation took the computer gaming world by storm and is considered an all-time classic. However, the long-awaited, much-anticipated sequel is riddled with bugs and poor design decisions. When you take into account its hopelessly inadequate manual, there's no way to escape the conclusion that this game was released prematurely. The 275-page manual is packed with interesting information about weapons, organization, doctrine, and tactics. Unfortunately, it fails to cover basic game mechanics, such as how to move in reverse and the correct procedure for firing at moving targets. Even worse, some of the features described in the manual aren't included in the game. For CGW Rated * * * HUNTER-KILLER The CITV looks impressive. Unfortunately, a game bug prevents gamers from taking full advantage of it. APPEAL: Armor enthusiasts willing to overlook obvious faults in a sim. PROS: Excellent graphics and sound create a realistic in-tank experience; wide variety of missions and campaigns; role-playing aspect: multiplayer support. CONS: Released too soon; plagued by abysmal manual, bugs, poor design decisions, and lack of polish. DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Intermediate. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 133, Windows 95, 16MB RAM, 4x CD-ROM, 200MB hard drive space, DirectX 5.0, SVGA graphics, mouse, joystick recommended. 3D SUPPORT: 3Dfx.

Price: $50 Publisher: MicroProse (510) 864-4550 www.microprose.com Armour Amour Despite that, the latest version of M1 is one of the most realistic tank simulations currently available. With impressive 3Dfx-accelerated graphics and sound, the game is capable of providing an immersive environment, as well as challenging, intense, and exciting gameplay. By the time you read this, a patch addressing many of the game's problems (too numerous to detail here) should be available, along with a FAQ covering inconsistencies and omissions in the manual. 180) COAX APFSDS HEAT STAFF THERMAL HAVOC Objects in your gunsight are sometimes closer than you'd like.Viewed through the M1A2's thermal sight, this Mi-28 Havoc is about to be annihilated. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Multiplayer support is provided for LAN, modem, and serial play.

Although MicroProse advises against playing Mill over the Internet, when we tested with two players it worked reasonably well. BiH OUR 1 COM TEAM DAKOTA The ability to personalize your platoon by naming its tanks and crew members adds a touch of role-playing to the simulation.

From there, you can play 1 of 21 standalone missions, join a randomly generated battle, or enter a campaign in the Persian Gulf, North Africa, the Far East, Moldova, or Eastern Europe. There are also 11 training missions. Victory or Defeat? Even if MicroProse successfully patches all of Mill's problems, the game will continue to suffer from lack of polish and inattention to detail. LONGBOW 2 players will recognize how much better Mill could have been if it had more of the customization features and player configuration options. MicroProse is planning Mill expansion disks that could extend the game's replay value. Most hard-core tank simulation fans will find enough to like in Mill to overlook its obvious faults. Those who expect a reasonably complete and functional game for their money might want to take a wait-and-see approach. The potential for a good game is certainly there, but only time will tell whether MicroProse can save Mill from the bargain bin of obscurity. CGW ment commands to your units and instructions on formations and various actions. By clicking on any friendly unit and selecting the external view, you can get a battlefield view of how it's faring. During combat, you can jump into any of the four tanks in your platoon and fight from the gunner's station or from the commander's buttoned and unbuttoned stations. However, because the commander's stations are of limited use, you'll spend most of your time switching between the map and the gunner's station. After the battle, you receive a performance report. Depending on the mission's outcome, points are awarded to promote and deco rate members of your platoon, Advance Recon Before entering battle, you get briefed on the mission type, ground support units under your command, and the artillery and air support you'll receive. The battle begins paused at the map screen, providing the opportunity to issue orders before the shooting starts. From the map, you issue move. I Want My CITV Perhaps the game's greatest faux pas is its treatment of the commander's independent thermal viewer (CITV). This feature separates the M1A2 from previous models of the Abrams and other modern main battle tanks. It enables the commander to search and designate targets for the gunner. But a bug in the program renders it useless in the game. Under Al control, gunners fire off their tank's limited supply of special-purpose ammunition and constantly countermand orders to load specific ammo types, making the job of tank commander more frustrating than it should be. Some design decisions defy logic. For example, the manual emphasizes using the commander's .50-caliber machine gun for antiaircraft defense and destroying light-armor vehicles. However, the weapon's usefulness is greatly reduced because there is no binocular view, no night vision capability, and nothing to help the gamer orient which direction the machine gun is facing. Overall, the design demonstrates a poor sense of knowing when to accurately portray reality and when to make concessions to gameplay. Gameplay in Mill is quite similar to the original, with a few variations. You start by creating a platoon attached to either a U.S. Army armor or cavalry unit or a Marine Corps unit, which determines the The Way It Should Have Shipped ess than a month after M1 TANK PLATOON II hit the shelves, Micro Prose released a patch that significantly improves the game. The joystick buttons now function correctly, and most of the keyboard commands do what they were always supposed to do. The commander's unbuttoned view is far more useful, thanks to the addition of binoculars and night vision. There's also artwork showing the main gun and upper portions of the turret, which helps orient the view. Artillery can now fire smoke screens, although MicroProse recommends that this feature be used on high-end systems only. The CITV is functional and the gunner no longer overrides gamer commands. Most bugs and design decisions that created gameplay irritations were also fixed. Direct 3D support was added for Matrox Millennium and Intel 740 3D accelerators. MicroProse released a FAQ covering some of the important game mechanics in detail With a little more beta testing, tweaking and a decent manual, this could have been a four-star game or better. Unfortunately, the game MicroProse chose to ship to stores didn't warrant the CGW seal of approval. 106 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD AUGUST 1998 www.computergaming.com "

"REVIEW PANZER COMMANDER Bd5NOTIWTS Rommel Rides Again Even Without Smoke Effects, PANZER COMMANDER Outflanks Every Other WWII Tank Sim Ever Made by Jim Cobb or years, gamers have had only one serious World War II tank simulation, Deadly Games' M4 SHERMAN, and even that bordered on the arcade. Suddenly, we are deluged with WWII armor, from Interactive Magic's IPANZER '44 and Psygnosis's upcoming PANZER ELITE to PANZER COMMANDER from SSI—which for now has the broadest scope of any of these sims. Developed by Ultimation, PANZER COMMANDER manages to cover every major tank battle in Europe from 1939 to 1945, as well as some interesting small engagements. Gamers can pilot 47 different tank models from Germany, Russia, the U.S. and the U.K. including just about every Panzer or Crusader variant you can imagine. If that isn't comprehensive enough, you'll also face a variety of text and an accurate model, and PANZER COMMANDER provides that context in spades. The gamer is a mere platoon leader, commanding one to three tanks other than his own. Platoon orders are limited to formations (column, echelon, line wedge, crescent) and targeting specific enemies. Afterward, you are free to handle your own vehicle, using seven vehicle views and an optional external view. As commander, you can stand in the turret hatch, scanning with binoculars, or pilot from the buttoned cupola. The cupola restricts views, FOG OF WAR The direct 3D support (especially 3Dfx) really but it has a small situation map spices things up in PANZER COMMANDER.

"REVIEW TRIPLE PLAY 99 SPORTS Corked Bat TRIPLE PLAY 99 Swings a Big Bat but Doesn't Field a Complete Team by Robert Coffey hese days, most sports games fall into one of two very different categories: graphically sharp, action-oriented thumb candy or ugly-buttactically-deep simulation. In the madonna/whore context of PC sports, TRIPLE PLAY 99 performs like a Miss America champ: It looks and moves great, but don't expect much insight. Graphically, nothing compares to TRIPLE PLAY 99. Polygonal players move with a brutish grace not found in any other baseball game. Every swing of the bat is Ruthian; every throw a rocket; every catch a diving, dirt-eating highlight. It looks sharp, but more staid fans of America's pastime may find it cartoonish-second basemen don't just toss the ball back to the pitcher, they rear back and hurl it. You can practically hear the rotator cuffs shredding. often short-circuited by two runners deciding to hang out together at second. While the computer won't victimize itself with these little tea parties, it does inflict other boneheaded baserunning plays on itself. TRIPLE PLAY 99 has upped the statistical ante with tons of numbers and charts, but the game is still \"Stats Lite\" at best. In a simmed season Barry Bonds hit a reasonable 43 homers but stole an unlikely 79 bases, getting caught just four times. The umps should check those cleats for jump jets. Face it, any game in which Greg Vaughn's abysmal 1997 season serves as the basis for a .289, 33 BANG-BANG PLAY Exciting, tumbling plays dominate every game of TRIPLE PLAY 99. Baseball practically becomes a contact sport. SCOUTING REPORT BULAN CUATRO  -V ER WATSON TEIL 1 VOL HE MATCH CGW Rated FACTS ARE FUNNY THINGS Sure, the game coughs up a bunch of stats, but does it pay attention to them? Not even a little. onnan APPEAL: Fans who favor action over realism. PROS: Great 3D graphics; short Triple learning curve; lots Plau gg of on-field action. CONS: Doesn't even try to simulate real baseball; unrealistic stats; poor baserunning Al. DIFFICULTY: Easy REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 90; Windows 95; 16MB RAM; 20MB free hard-drive space; 4x CD-ROM drive, DirectSound-compatible sound card; gamepad supported. 3D SUPPORT: 3Dfx.

TRIPLE PLAY 99 is fully licensed, Going Deep-Not! with every stadium beautifully re Unfortunately, all this glitz created and every major leaguer comes at the expense of truly retaking his at-bats. While players' creating major league baseball. The faces aren't eerily stretched across focus in TRIPLE PLAY 99 isn't just on their boxy heads, they do sport hitting the ball, it's on punching appropriate facial hair. Has anyone holes in the Mir space station (as if else noticed an apparent mandate it didn't have enough trouble). See that 50 percent of players must the ball, launch the ball.

Controlmighty, sweeping swings of the players in ling base runners is iffy TP99 make every bleacher bum a target. at best-rallies are homer re-creation isn't paying attention. TRIPLE PLAY 99's draft model is befuddling. Gamers setting up an eight-team league with their buddies will have to watch impotently as the computer insists on drafting for the other 20 teams. So long, Dream Team, hello Scott Spiezio. That said, the game's career mode and trade point cap are nice additions. TRIPLE PLAY 99 tries to catch the wave by offering Internet play, but the game's demanding graphics limit it to manage-only mode. TRIPLE PLAY 99 is a pretty good game if your only interest is in racking up double-digit scores in epic slugfests. If you want something like real baseball, keep looking.

"THE GOLF PRO FEATURING GARY PLAYER  REVIEW Chip Shot Tods Empire Takes a Big Swing, but Comes Up a Bit Short 922 Gord GOBLE 2 mph SHOT 3 33 by Gordon Goble ith apologies to my high school creative writing teacher (who felt clichés were the work of Satan), Empire Interactive's first sojourn into computer golf is nothing less than a diamond in the rough. Rewarding skilled, thoughtful play more than any other PC golf game to date, THE GOLF PRO FEATURING GARY PLAYER exhibits brilliant programming, but it's lack ing in a few key areas that keep it just short of the genre's elite titles. good about this game. Simply put, THE GOLF PRO does mouse driving better, and with more innovation and complexity, than the competition. (So much so, in Empire's opini on, that it did not include the traditional swing meter.) Here's how complex the mouse drive is. Releasing the left mouse button before contact adds height to the flight path; releasing it late (or not at all) adds distance. Angling the typical perpendicular mouse orientation during the swing adds intentional hook or slice to your drive, just as opening or closing your grip would do with a real golf club. Of course, the same thing can be accomplished accidentally by veering from the straight and narrow as you swing, just as you might mishit a real ball. Then, there's tempo. The game forces you to maintain a steady uninterrupted rhythm from beginning to end of each swing or suffer the consequences—again, it's just like the real game. You'll soon find that a solid, flowing approach is critical, and the results are realistic. SWING Options Grecs FROM THE CHEAP SEATS Static camera positions mean you'll often have to swing from distant views such as this. Mouse Swingin' THE GOLF PRO is the latest PC golf game that lets a gamer duplicate the entire swing with the mouse (known here as a \"mouse drive\"), and it marks what's really CGW Rated PETENCER, Udru The back Arts elek of the world APPEAL: Computer golfers thirsting for more complex, challenging and realistic play.

Price: $44.95 Publisher: Empire interactive San Francisco, CA (800) 216-9706 A Course Is a Course THE GOLF PRO includes only two courses, England's St. Mellion and South Carolina's cherished Hilton Head, though three more are promised by year's end. The courses are both pretty and functional, conveying a convincing sense of perspective and elevation. That the ball accurately reacts to all the inherent dips, rises, and environmental conditions is testament to some very careful programming. Let's just say this is one game that forces the player to use all his skill and experience all the time. In a unique visual twist, Empire has opted for enhanced prerendered digitized graphics and static camera positions, an approach that results in very fast scene changes. But the camera angles often aren't the ideal \"behind-the-golfer\" permany long or blind drives, leaving spective for all possible ball posiyou ignorant of the ball's final rest tions, which makes it tough to reading spot or the obstacle you may fairway and green grading.

"REVIEW  SOLDIERS AT WAR TRATEGYZWAR Letting the Boys Down This WWII Game Fails to Identify Its Target, or Its Interface 316 also have them, like their historical counterparts, wondering just who organized this mess. SOLDIERS puts you in charge of a squad or two of infantry, à la XCOM or JAGGED ALLIANCE. You're limited to playing as the U.S. in the 15-scenario campaign, but in the single scenarios you can also be the Germans, the Italians, or the French Resistance. H 000 by Tim Carter he first U.S. Army units to fight against the Germans during World War II met with a surprising defeat. Not that the average doughboy was lacking. On the contrary, it was the sometimes intangible supporting elements of an armed forceequipment, organization, and leadership that were clearly in need of work. The guys in the field, unfortunately, were left to overcome these problems through courage and hard work. This makes for a good movie, but it was an unpleasant experience for the people who actually had to slog it out on the battlefield. SOLDIERS AT WAR, from SSI, transports gamers to those gritty days of World War II infantry combat in Europe. Unfortunately, it may @ LE BIRD'S-EYE RECON When you zoom out, you can see a lot of the battlefield, but not enough info. Notice how the wall is in the way of the active soldier. \"I Can't Do That, Sir!\" SOLDIERS is turn-based, mostly bug-free, and does a reasonable job of replicating WWII infantry combat. I doubt it will win any prizes for realism, but it does offer a complete range of infantry weapons and a relatively diverse set of scenarios. Sadly, SOLDIERS' potential is greatly marred by an extremely clunky interface. At virtually every stage of the action, gamers must use more mouse clicks than should be necessary (by my calculation, throwing a grenade requires six different commands). Moreover, the maps and other information are very poorly thought out. For instance, keeping the map scaled to 50 percent allowed me to see both my active soldier and any nearby targets, and gave me a sense CGW Rated for lines-of-sight and potential cover (which, as one might expect is pretty important to keeping your troops alive). But what you cannot see at the 50 percent zoom level is the \"chance-to-hit\" number that appears when you aim at an enemy soldier. As this number is frequently zero, and as ammunition is quite limited (a feature I quite like, by the way), I had to switch constantly between map levels. Also, a glitch in the zoom feature frequently shifts your view to another area of the map when you change levels, making for a very frustrating experience if you are considering multiple targets or are trying to sort out which of your soldiers should shoot at whom. APPEAL: WWII SOLDIERS addicts with a high addicts with a high AT WAR tolerance for annoyances. PROS: Fun at times; lots of Weapons; one of few games on this topic at this scale. CONS: Clunky interface; poorly imple mented player feedback, no British, German, or Russian campaigns. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 120, Windows 95, 16MB RAM, 2MB SVGA graphics, 4x CD-ROM drive, DirectXcompatible sound card. 3D SUPPORT: None.

Price: $39.95 Designer: Random Games Publisher: SSI Novato, CA (800) 601-7529 www.ssionline.com characteristics are referred to numerically, and because none of them are directly displayed or even referenced during gameplay, it's difficult to develop any understanding or allegiance to your troops during battle. I also have to question some of the design decisions. While there are many vehicles on the scenario maps, most of them don't do anything. You can take over and use immobilized tanks, but you can't drive them; I never encountered any that moved on their own. If the designers couldn't incorporate functioning vehicles into the game, why bother with them at all? As it is, the current situation only highlights the lack of realistic armor, or even jeeps. None of these flaws makes SOLDIERS AT WAR unplayable just annoying. But since it is the only game on the market that gives you individual control of infantrymen in WWII, many gamers may wish to overlook these shortcomings. The rest of us, however, can only hope that the trials of battle and compla from the field will induce the powers that be to deploy a better product next time. CGW . Sal OR OG Sergeant Who?

Ritchie ust when you thought it was safe to go back into the galaxy, the Core have returned. As TOTAL ANNIHILATION: THE CORE CONTINGENCY opens, we find that the Core have escaped annihilation and resurfaced in the Ocelon system. It turns out those pesky Core-sters had a plan (one might call it a \"contingency\") in case of an Arm victory: A lone Core commander was stashed away in a far-off system. Now that it has been activated, its goal is to convert alien technology hidden in the system into nothing short of a galaxy-sucking superweapon. Your job as the Arm or Core commander is to either destroy the technology or carry out the Core's dastardly plan. o late urban landscape) are available in multiplayer mode. If this isn't enough, there is a bonus mission with the impossibly powerful new Krogoth superkbot, and the full mission editor used to develop the original levels. The game's few shortcomings are so obvious that I'm mystified as to why they weren't addressed. First, the manual for TACC is simply the twopage CD insert. There are no unit descriptions, no instructions, nothing. Second, the game still lacks 3D-accelerator support. Why would a game that touts itself as the 3D real-time strategy sim not have THOSE PESKY MINES Minelaying becomes a big part of the missions on planet Temblor. Use your VTOL planes to blast the ground free of mines in front of your armored columns. Direct3D support? Third, the installation is a bloated 200MB. Finally, the Al is occasionally screwy. For example, the computer would leave a full air force out of the battle while I annihilated his ground force. But even with these flaws, TACC's gameplay remains too big a draw to warrant anything but a positive recommendation. CGW CGW Rated * * * Not Totally New... Of course, this is just a veneer over Cavedog's attempt to wring more out of its hit franchise. After all, TOTAL ANNIHILATION was by most accounts the best real-time strategy game of last year, and most gamers clamored for more. Thankfully, the story notwithstanding, CORE CONTINGENCY is true to its namesake. The 3D-shaded graphics continue to set the standard for real-time warscapes, and thus TACC's line-of-sight physics model remains the only one that makes sense. For example, you can see the high ground just by looking, and the effective use of shadows prevents you from building new batteries in locations blocked by trees. The other hallmark of the original-hundreds of diverse, fully animated 3D units-also continues with TACC. The returning units are joined by many juicy additions, including hover tanks, air-repair pads, seaplane construction facilities, mine-laying units, and underwater metal extractors. Unlike in the original, both the old and new units are well balanced with massive energy and metal requirements, limiting the firing rate of the most powerful weapons. The battles in TACC range across 24 new single-player missions (12 on each side) and four planets.

"GAMER'S EDGE. STRATEGY. CHEATS WALKTHROUGHS Jane's F-15 Mastering Air-to-Air Combat While Using Realistic Radar TION PAUSED by Tom \"KC\" Basham or the most part, the general public views the modern battlefield as a push-button, video-game affair. The abundance of \"relaxed realism\" sims and the preponderance of Gulf War videos tend to promote that view. An entertainment simulation realistic enough to refute this stereotype is indeed a rare gem. Happily, JANE'S F-15 is one such jewel. Incorporating this game's high level of detail, however, also increases the sim's difficulty. Unlike the real F-15E, which carries a crew of two, JANE'S F-15 places the burden on you to both fly the aircraft and manipulate its systems. The combination of difficulty and workload may be too much for some gamers to handle. This installment of Gamer's Edge explores F-15's air-to-air avionics and weapons, shedding light on these complex topics. MIG MASTER Remember that your radar also alerts the bad guys that you're looking for them this MiG-21 just scored a victory because it knew the F-15s were coming. Radar 101 Radar, of course, is the primary long-range detection tool used by modern aircraft. Many sims portray radar as an all-seeing crystal ball providing the flight crew with a perfect picture that wraps 360 degrees around the aircraft. In real life. radar works more like a flashlight in a pitch-black room. The flashlight beam illuminates only a small area. In order to navigate across the room without tripping over items on the floor, bumping your head on items hanging from the ceiling, or being waylaid by creatures lurking in the dark, you steer the beam around the room. Finding airborne targets with radar depends on properly adjusting the shape of the scan beam and then pointing it in the right direction. We adjust the width in three attributes: width, height, and range. The width, or azimuth, is usually measured in degrees on either side of the nose. A 60degree scan, for example, would scan 30 degrees to the right and 30 degrees to the left of the nose. Height, or elevation of the scan is measured in bars. Each bar represents one horizontal sweep of the radar across the azimuth settings. A two-bar scan, therefore, is twice as tall as a one-bar scan. Page 2.52 of the F-15 manual provides a diagram of different combinations of azimuth and elevation adar works like a flashlight in a pitch-black room. Finding airborne targets with radar depends on adjusting the shape of the scan beam and pointing it in the right direction. particular spot. A smaller scan area, therefore, provides more fre. quent updates on the target or targets, but it also possibly misses other targets by covering a smaller volume of sky. Adjusting the range works a little differently. The description of range limits on manual page 4.22 is somewhat misleading. The radar energy travels out, strikes a target, and reflects back to your aircraft. Since the strength of the wave dissipates as it travels, the strength of the return wave indicates the distance to the target. The radar then filters out contacts detected beyond the selected range setting. Remember that with a range setting of, for example, 40nm, the energy must travel an 80nm round-trip-from the transmitter to the target and back again. The energy that doesn't Once you've selected the height and width, the radar sweeps through the pattern. It takes a finite amount of time for the radar to cover the pattern. Logically, the larger the pattern, the longer it takes the radar to scan it. Data on each detected target is updated only when the radar paints that See the Review JULY ISSUE.4.5 STARS LZO COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1998 www.computergaming.com "

While it is technically possible for the radar unit to decrease output power for shorter-range selec. tions, always assume that your radar will be able to be detected at a distance at least two times the selected range setting. Radar à la Mode Manipulating and steering the cone, and interpreting its results, are not trivial processes. The APG70 radar simplifies all this somewhat by providing numerous modes. Each mode has a specific purpose and set of parameters. Some \"hands-free\" modes, like Boresight and Vertical Scan, attempt to lock close-ranged targets during a dogfight with a minimum of pilot input. Other modes give you more control over the scan pattern for long-ranged searches and multiple-target engagements. Counting all varieties of modes, submodes, and supersearch modes, there are 13 different air-to-air modes available in JANE'S F-15. The more modes you understand and are comfortable with, the more options you have during combat. Nonetheless, I'll be honest: I don't use them all. Like most players (and real-world combat pilots I've spoken with), gravitate to the subset of modes that I find most useful. I don't like changing modes any more than I have to. Changing modes blanks the MPD, erasing the tactical information collected so far. Changing modes can also modify scan cone parameters, often requiring additional userinput to reacquire previously detected targets. If I can't find a target that AWACS or JSTARS reports, then I may be forced to switch modes. Overall, though, try to minimize the amount of time spent tweaking the radar. Before starting a radar search, contact AWACS to get a picture of the air battle so far. Press Ctrl-P to ask AWACS for an overall summary of the battle zone referenced from a common bulls-eye. I don't find this particular request very useful. First, in a crowded area AWACS jabbers interminably. throwing out contacts faster than can jot them down. Second, the references to bulls-eye are imprecise and subject to interpretation. Consequently, I prefer the Ctrl-B (Bogey Dope) request. This time, AWACS gives me a precise heading (although they call it a bearing) and range to the enemy along with information about the target's flight path (closing, moving away, flanking, and so on). This generally tells me where to begin my air-to-air search. If AWACS doesn't report anything very close, if AWACS isn't available, or if I have no reason to suspect that bandits are very close, I begin my search in Vector (VCTR) mode. Make no mistake about it, VCTR mode is extremely slow. It scans a very large chunk of airspace. It provides a very thorough analysis, reporting both low-closure and long-range targets. Because it's so slow, though, it's difficult to keep tabs on highclosure targets. Once I know that there are contacts in a given area (either from AWACS or VCTR mode), I switch to Range While Search Interleaved (RWSI) mode. This is my favorite mode for keeping tabs on multiple targets. The enemy probably won't identify the relatively slow scan rate as a lock and it provides a good tradeoff between the other RWS modes. If necessary, I generally don't use RWS High (RWSH) or RWS Medium (RWSM) unless specifically know I'm looking for a T hen radar energy strikes a target, some portion of the energy is reflected back. The size and shape of the target determines how much energy is reflected. The radar wave loses energy as it travels. For the radar to detect the target enough energy must be reflected back to the transmitter to be detected. If the target is too far away, the reflected energy will dissipate before completing the trip back to the radar unit. In general, a smaller target reflects less energy than a larger one. Of course, the shape of the aircraft also influences radar returns. Faceted aircraft (like the F117) and rounded aircraft (like the B-2) reflect energy, but not directly toward the transmitting radar. In terms of detection, the amount of energy reflected directly back to the radar is what counts. A small object, or a large object that reflects energy at odd angles, reflects less energy back to the radar unit, making it harder to detect at longer ranges. The \"apparent size\" of the target is referred to as the Radar Cross Section (RCS). The key to stealth and avoiding radar detection, therefore, is reducing RCS. Consequently, you can generally detect a larger target at longer ranges than you can a smaller target. Just because you select an 80nm range does not mean you'll detect every target within the scan zone at that range. A Tu-22 will generally be detectable much farther away than will a MiG-21. Modus Operandi DOOD DDDOOS I'M SHOOTING AT YOU The STT mode provides the most detailed target info, but also tells the target you're planning to engage.

"JANE'S F-15 GAMER'S EDG APG-68 (F-16C) and the APG-70 (F-15C/E), provide a more useful Track While Scan (TWS) mode. TWS mode, quite simply, radarlocks multiple targets at once. Although it searches a smaller section of sky than the RWS modes, TWS scans a fairly large area around the primary target. Since it's scanning a larger area than STT, the target may not recognize that it has been radar locked (see \"Stay on Target\" sidebar). Further, TWS keeps tabs on multiple targets. I can monitor the movements of the entire group and engage multiple targets simultaneously with missiles. At close range, I focus mainly on Super Search and Vertical Scan. I typically encounter many more hostiles than friendlies in event of a dogfight. Consequently, Super Search's larger search cone acquires targets farther off my nose, often giving me more shots of opportunity against targets that just happen to wander across my flight path. If the sky is crowded with friendly fighters, though, may be forced to use Boresight's smaller scan zone to prevent accidentally shooting at my wingman. Vertical Scan is my favorite mode for a sustained turn fight against a single target, since it scans directly along the lift vectorexactly where I'm trying to place the bandit. These modes are hands-free; simply select the mode, wait for the radar to lock, and fire a missile. They work equally well with either AIM-9 or AIM-120 missiles, although most dogfights occur well below the AIM-120's minimum launch range. JANE'S F-15 is an incredibly detailed simulation, and this brief lesson only begins to scratch the surface of the product. As with all matters of air combat, the best way to improve is to practice. If you invest the time to learn the intricacies of the game, you'll be rewarded with many great gaming experiences.

Second, STT's focused search pattern will be interpreted as a radar lock-on by the target, possibly leading it to believe you intend to engage. FALCON 3.0 players will recall that you could not fire missiles at a target without setting the APG-66 to STT mode and locking on that one target.

Just like many automobiles, aircraft carry radar detectors. Such detectors monitor both the frequency of the received signal and how often it paints the target. If the emitter is doing a wide-area, RWS-style search, it will not paint the target as often as if the emitter were in STT mode. Consequently, we assume that an increase in how often the radar paints a target indicates that the emitter is focusing its attention on that specific target. A \"lock-on,\" therefore, simply means that the emitting radar is painting the target often enough to provide a weapon firing solution. Painting a target once every three seconds probably wouldn't be interpreted as a lock by the target: painting the target three times per second will most definitely be perceived as a lock-on.

"EDGE StarCraft Advanced Studies: How Do I Beat That Rush? ast month, we delved into basic tips, such as the Attack Move command and the optimum number of peons for resource gathering. This month, we'll discuss advanced strategies and give you some tips on how to defend against the most prominent rushes. Only Build What You Need... One of the worst ways to spend your money is to squander it on buildings you don't need. This usually applies in the very beginning and middle of games. Don't just scramble up the tech tree because you have to. If you are on an open map and you suspect a rush, why build a refinery and factory when an extra barracks and the added marines you get will come in more handy? If you're on an island map, don't go for that second barracks-go straight for that starport instead. Protoss Ownerver Detestop by Elliott Chin SCOUT IT OUT Scout the map and leave sentries at resource nodes to see when your enemies start expansion bases like this one. What the Pros Do The truly good players don't just understand what a unit does, they know what a unit does for and against you. The pros learn to think ahead and think like their enemies. Here are some things to keep in mind if you want to move to the big leagues in STARCRAFT. ...But Build a Lot of It Once you've figured out what you need to build, make a lot of it. If you know that air superiority (and cloaked wraiths) will guarantee victory on that island map. construct three or four starports and crank out wraiths. And if you know you need to upgrade your units as quickly as possible, build two armories so you can research weapons and armor upgrades at the same time. The best players don't hoard money, they spend it. 2,000 minerals in the bank is useless when the enemy is bearing down on you with 100 supplies' worth of hydralisks. It would have been wiser to use those 2,000 minerals to build two extra barracks, factories, and starports, which would have tripled your unit production so you'd have enough defenses when that hydra horde came knocking on (or, rather, down) your door. Fit the Unit to the Task Tailor your units to your needs. Don't just make a unit because it is the next logical step in your tech advancement. Think carefully about the type of damage your unit does (plasma, explosive, or & 30/42 Scout or Die Knowing the map and the enemy's forces is the only way you'll ever win. On small maps, send your eighth or ninth peon unit to locate your enemies. You'll see where they are, where they might attack from in the event of a rush, and just how far along they are in their tech trees. On larger maps, send early or midgame combat units around the map to see where the extra resources are and to keep tabs on what the enemy is doing. Always post scouts near free resource nodes to alert you when the enemy begins construction of secondary bases. If you never bother to see what the enemy is building, you'll never know what to defend against, or which units you'll have to neutralize during your offensive. normal), the size of your target (small, medium, or large), and the time and money it takes to build your units. There is always more than one way to beat an attack, and sometimes the most obvious solution isn't the best As a Protoss player, if reconnaissance reveals that your Zerg opponent is amassing mutalisks, you might think the best strategy would be to build carriers to eliminate those mutas. Think again. In order to get enough effective carriers to match his mutalisk horde, you'd have to build two starports, research the carrier capacity upgrade, and then wait for your carriers to build their full complement of interceptors. Too bad you'd be attacked by six to nine mutalisks before your first two carriers ever built their second interceptor. Instead, you should go the cheaper, quicker, and less complicated route: dragoons. You could built an extra gateway, assemble dragoons, upgrade them, and then provide shield batteries for them in the same amount of time. Knowing the relative buildand research times, costs, firing rates, and necessary upgrades for these two units would point experienced players to dragoons, MENU See the Review JULY ISSUE. 5 STARS TOWERING INFERNO If you want to live, don't rely on towers.

"20/60 CAMERSEDIG Protoss Cart KAS 1 SA110200 NOT THE RIGHT UNIT Bigger doesn't mean better. If you're facing a rush by mutalisks, it's more efficient and faster to crank out dragoons than to try to advance up the tech tree to get expensive carriers. rather than carriers, for mutalisk defense. Know your units and what they can do for you, but also realize what they can't do for you, even if they are as awesome on paper as are the mighty carrier. SIZEUULI MATTER Think About Placement When you build your structures, placement is key. Put them close to bunkers or defensive structures, and don't put them out in the open, on the outside of your defensive parameter. Build your defenses in anticipation of where your enemy will attack. Think about where your units will need to go when you build barracks and factories. Don't put that factory behind your command center if you want to move your tanks to the front of your base. When that tank pops out, it will have to navigate SCVs and the buildings between the factory and your periphery before it can get to where you need it to go. None of these tips stands alone. Only by using all of them together can you form a winning strategy. Remember to constantly weigh whether your current strategy will help or hurt you in both the short and long run. Lastly, it always helps to think like your enemy and try to see what he will or will not do. Only by anticipating him can you outsmart him. Massively Multiplayer. Only ONLINE!

BASE INSTINCT Good base defense is essential for stopping those early rushes. Put bunkers or shield batteries at bottlenecks into your town. GAMESTORM. The Nitty Gritty To set the record straight, rushes are basically an attack with a single lowlevel unit type, such as a marine or zergling, which is done so early in the game that it is difficult to defend against.

There are some general strategies to consider when rushing, no matter which unit you use. First, build multiple unitproducing buildings, which means three to four barracks for the Terran or two to three gateways for the Protoss or two hatcheries for the Zerg. Second, commit yourself to the rush. Nothing is more pathetic than a rusher who can't finish the deed. The point is, rush to win, not to annoy. Go for the jugular. When you rush a town, bypass all defenses and go for enemy workers. Kill them all so you halt production and resource gathering. Then, eliminate the defenses and unit-producing buildings. Third, when rushing with the zealot, marine, or zergling, do not bother to mine gas. Use the money you save from not building a refinery to build an extra barracks, and use the peons who would have gathered gas to gather minerals.

That means clustering together your defenses and building your structures so that your defensive net can cover all your buildings. Also, because rushers will go for workers, place defenses around your resource patches. Keep in mind that defensive buildings can do only so much. Do not rely on towers to beat a rush. You need units to back up your cannons, sunken colonies, and bunkers. Also, remember that tower buildings are surprisingly weak unless they are built in multiples of three.

Build as if you were going to rush, so that you have enough troops to defend against one. That means: Produce the same number of barracks or gateways your enemy does, in order to achieve parity of numbers. Delay building your refinery and gathering gas until you have adequate defensive units. If you are rushed, make the enemy pay. If you thwart a rush and kill all the invaders, mount a counteroffensive with your own units. Pop those marines out of your bunker, recharge your zealots' shields, and exact revenge. Usually, a rusher who fails in his rush is wide-open to attack. He has no defenses, and he has thrown away all his troops. If you don't exploit your enemy's momentary weakness, expect to get rushed again. Now, let's move on to specific rushes.

There are two possible types of zergling rushes. The first occurs when the enemy comes at you with his first six zerglings (which could be three minutes into the game, just after he finishes his spawning pool). The second type of zergling rush comes two to three minutes after that, when the enemy comes in with 12-18 zerglings. Terran players should build a bunker after their first barracks, before they start on their second barracks. If the first six zerglings come, you might have only two or three marines in your bunker, but they should make short work of the zerglings. After that, place two or three bunkers (and marines) close to your vital buildings. Those will thwart any zergling rush.

Research further rushes. marine range and stimpack at the academy to boost your infantry's fire power. Zealot rushes don't come as quick as zergling rushes, so you have a little more time to prepare. If you get breathing room, go for vultures and spider mines. If the rush comes later, and you have time to build tanks and research siege mode, place the tanks in siege mode behind your bunkers. FIRE IT UP The Terran answer to zealots is Zerg players need to crank out the firebat. They are cheaper, quicker to zerglings for defense. Don't rely build, and do splash damage. solely on sunken colonies, though two or three could help you. If you have time, go for hydras to supplement your defenses. Join the TOUR..

Jackpucklaus ONLINE GOLF TOUR Hydralisk Rush If your scouting mission finds swarms of hydralisks near the Zerg base, watch out. The hydralisk rush could be coming. As Terran, you have to build up to factories and machine shops quickly. Then, research spider mines and siege mode. Lay mines near your town entrance to take out hydras, and place tanks in siege mode behind your bunkers; their splash damage will take out groups of hydras. Protoss players need to get reavers quickly. The reaver fires bomblike scarabs that do splash damage, destroying clusters of hydralisks even faster than siege tanks in siege mode. You need to go straight for the robotics facility, where reavers are produced, and then the robotics support bay, enabling their production.

SW Diamond by Joe Vallina iercely competitive and challenging, FIFA ROAD TO WORLD CUP 98 is the best PC soccer game to date. There's nothing quite like playing your favorite team and taking them all the way to the World Cup championship game, and FIFA 98 gives you an unprecedented choice of players, teams, and game options with which to do so. If, however, you're planning on getting to the final round on the Professional orGod forbid—World Class level, it's going to take some special skills not outlined in the game's manual. At this level of competition, it's not enough simply to be able to sprint and slide tackle.

This view lets you see almost the entire pitch, and that makes it much easier to set up crosses and downfield passes. You can also more readily spot holes in the opposing half's defense. Strategy Circ Practice. Practice. Practice The Training area in FIFA 98 is a very useful feature. There are few things more beneficial than being able to take your team to the training field and practice your moves without having to worry about being tackled at every turn. Begin your practice session with no defenders. Practice executing your moves, and combinations of moves, until you can do them with ease. Then, add a defensive 250 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"GAMERSED G the tackle. Use the walk-around in combination with a forward crossing pass. Whether they be corner kicks, free kicks, or penalty kicks, deadball situations are crucial in tight games. You can practice each of them in the training area. As with the other moves in FIFA 98, deadball kicks can be manipulated using the shift buttons on your gamepad. When it's time to kick, the red arrow will come up, showing the direction, height, and distance of the kick. What many gamers overlook, however, is that by using the shift buttons you can manipulate the spin on the ball to make it curve while it's in the air. Logically, the left shift button makes the ball veer left, and viceversa. Experiment with different angles and spins to find which work best with your formations. If done correctly, you can curve the ball directly to one of your players near the net for an easy headeron-goal immediately hold the C button as you aim for the goal while the ball is still in the air). On higher difficulty levels, don't hesitate to use the X key. Your opponents won't. Most times, you can get away with a well-placed elbow (double-tap X when you're on defense). The spikes-up slide tackle, while effective, is a little more risky. should note that most of the strategies outlined here will also work for EA's newest soccer game, WORLD CUP 98. So lace up your boots, hit the pitch, and win one for your country! CGW SPIN ACTION Use the shift keys on your gamepad to add spin to the ball in dead-ball situations like this corner kick. Stre release the shift. Practice this until you can do it without breaking stride. This move is especially effective when you are surrounded by opposing players close to the goal. The spin will often throw the defender off just long enough for you to shoot and even the basic jump. Actually, we'll start with that. To be successful in FIFA 98 it's essential to be able to properly jump over intended slide tackles. At the higher difficulty levels, the Al is ruthless in its slide-tackling ability, and if you can't avoid the tackle, you're dead. Practice with one attacker and one defender on the practice pitch. Dribble the ball into the defenders' side until he comes up to tackle you. As he begins his lunge, press the Z button, without breaking stride, to jump over the defender's tackle. Another move that works particularly well is the 360-degree spin move into a shot on goal. To do this, hold the right shift button on your controller, while tapping the Y button for the spin, then immediately slide your finger over to press the C button as you move (hold the shift button while holding X) is when your player steps around the moving ball without touching it. This move accomplishes two things: It keeps the defender from knowing which way your player is going to pass the ball, and it usually keeps the defender from trying Vallina GoRiscoter IDNI Goals 023 mins GO00000AL! Add yourself to the roster, and you can score the winning goal in a World Cup game. How did the Spanish ever get along without me? The Right Team hile it might be exciting to try to go all the way with your sentimental favorite, the Burkina Faso national team (after all, wasn't grandpa from there?), you'll really have your work cut out for you against the big boys like England and Brazil on FIFA 98's higher difficulty levels. Even if your game skills are perfect, you can control only one player on the team at any moment, and if your computer-controlled teammates couldn't win a schoolyard pickup match, you're toast. Also, because the computer takes into account individual players' agility, speed, shot power, and the like, just because you hit the right key combination for that incredible shot, doesn't mean that your player can pull it off. So, if you want to have a real chance at going all the way, you need to play one of the standard World Cup contenders: Brazil, Italy, Argentina, England, Germany, or Spain. While you're at it, be sure to go to the Player Edit area and add yourself to the roster. Putting your mug on the pitch is a simple matter of taking an existing player on the team, then changing his facial and hair styles (as well as his skin and hair color). You can change his number, too, should you so choose. There's no better feeling than seeing your own name listed as a goal scorer in World Cup competition. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1998 251 "

A broken line not only costs you a lure or fly, it also means that you don't get to compete for the rest of the day. Avoid fishing in swift water flowing toward you.

Usually, your overall commander will be first candidate for activation, so defer his selection until later. That way, if the critical corps commander fails activation, your overall commander can take over and move the troops. Should the attack fail, he can rally troops before they rout off the map. Timing Attacks: The 15 minute/125 yard scale and the paucity of heavy artillery means that troops will not come under fire early. Thus, you have time to reduce disruption during movement and make sure your units go into attack in good shape.

Wing Commander III (Origin Systems, 1994) Surprisingly satisfying FMV space opera didn't lose the essence of the space-combat game. YOU DON'T NEW INDUCTION You Don't Know Jack Berkeley Systems, 1996 very company strives for a mainstream gaming hit, yet most attempts fail miserably. Back in early 1996, however, Berkeley Systems and Jellyvision combined their talents in You Don't Know JACK, a game that managed to appeal to both hard-core enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Because Jack was ostensibly based on a recognizable medium--the cheesy television game show-it immediately drew a huge audience. JACK kept everyone coming back for more through a combination of highly addictive gameplay and irreverent humor. The designers reveled in turning trivia-game convention on its ear and intro ducing new categories, such as the gibberish question (where you had to decipher with what a certain sentence rhymed: \"A fiddle nerd sold pee,\" for example, would translate as \"A little bird told me\"). JACK is the perfect example of a game that can appeal to non-traditional computer gamers. Not only is it a fabulous single player experience, it's also the ultimate party game. When JACK came out, the old CGW rule about leaving your work at work was forgotten: Friends and family begged editors to bring the game home for weekends. You Don't KNOW JACK has spawned a number of successful sequels and not-so-successful competitors, but it's the original we reward here for its irreverence, its freshness, and its take-no-prisoners attitude. Like Tetris before it, You Don't Know JACK is one Puzzle/Classics game that broke the mold-and had a lot of fun doing it. Wizardry (Sir-Tech Software, 1981) Defined the computer RPG with maze-based viewpoint and atmospheric spell names. Wolfenstein 3-D (id Software, 1992) Smooth-scrolling action blastfest cleverly updated the original, and put shareware back on the map. tulevient quiz party game X-COM (MicroProse, 1994) Premier tactical squad-level engine combined with alien tech research and pop culture for a sci-fi game nearly as addictive as CIVILIZATION Zork (Infocom, 1981) The progenitor of adventure games on the PC, its humor and challenging puzzles seem timeless. The game has since spawned a number of sequels, none of which has equalled the original. 200 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1998 www.computergaming.com "
