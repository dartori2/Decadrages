"READ.ME THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE GAMING WORLD Software Publishers Association Picks Codie Winners Macintosh Titles Lead The Pack Again Free CD From Logitech Offers Gamers Sound Advice' AAAA n annual highlight of the Software Publishers Association's Spring Symposium is the Codie Awards Banquer. This year, as usual, the Macintosh platform showed a greater strength in the award categories than it does in the actual marketplace. Three out of five award winners in the entertainment software categories debuted on the Macintosh. Best Adventure/Fantasy Role-Playing Game honors went to Broderbund's MYST. The eerie adventure developed by Cyan (Robin and Rand Miller) features beautifully rendered 3-D environments and diabolically difficult puzzles. The Codie for Best Simulation went to AAA A A A A. Maxis for the fifth year in a row. This year, SimCity 2000 won the nod and the award was presented by CGW Publisher, Russell Sipe. In accepting the award, Will Wright made his first Codie appearance and thanked co-author Fred Haslam, as well as Maxis 94 Chairman Jeff Braun. Drew Pictures' Iron Helix, distributed by Spectrum HoloByte, won Best Strategy Game honors. The Codie for Best Sports Program was presented to Papyrus Software for IndyCar Racing. Designer Dave Kaemmer was present to receive the award for the program which surpassed Papyrus' previous watershed simulation, Indianapolis 500: The Simulation (published by Electronic Arts). Finally, Lemmings 2: The Tribes won the award for Best Action/Arcade game. This marked the second victory for Psygnosis and their British developer, DMA Design, since the original Lemmings also won the award in this category. VILJ TI SOFTWARE LYCELLENCE IN SOFTE Software Publishers Association Unveils New Data 27% Of U.S. Households Have One Or More Personal Computers Tith all the cryptic jargon for sound boards and digitized audio, it's no wonder a lot of gamers are still listening to bleeping PC speakers. If the ads and hype sound like one cacophanous din, you should hear Logitech's free Â«Sound Advice\" CD that explains the different technologies and uses audio demos to illustrate the differences. Hosted by a technology commentator, an electronic musician, and a Logitech product manager, the Logitech CD does a great job of explaining the basics. The discussion covers 8-bit and 16-bit audio, FM synthesis, and wave table synthesis, with musical accompaniment by Wayne Gabriel. As Logitech's product manager Dave Pelton points out, the game community is now moving towards wave table and General Midi standards. Pelton advises gamers to buy a sound card that supports both, to enjoy games such as The Seventh Guest, X-Wing and Return to Zork. Leo Laporte, host of the nationwide talk show \"On Computers,\" keeps the 20-minute discussion lively. The CD then features original, full length compositions by Gabriel, who received Gold and Platinum records with John Lennon and has performed or recorded with Mick Jagger, Stevie Wonder, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters and others. Sound Advice, which can be played on any CD player, is available at no charge by calling (800) 889-0046. The package includes a $10 rebate coupon for any Logitech sound product. r the Spring Symposium of the Software Publishers Association, Research A Director David Tremblay revealed that 27% of U.S. households (roughly 24 million homes) have at least one personal computer. Of these, approximately 31% acquired their primary computer during the 1993 calendar year or early in 1994. The best news for gamers is that these machines are loaded. 40% are 486-processorbased or higher; 60% have modems; 35% have CD-ROM drives (usually replacing the 5.25 inch floppy drives); 35% offer FAX capability; and 20% have a sound card. Most importantly for the growth of the computer gaming hobby, 48% of those surveyed play games on their computer. The only sad statistic in the recent survey is that only 7% of respondents reported any kind of on-line usage. Tremblay admitted that the percentages of computer ownership may be slightly conservative, but he assured the press that these were useful numbers. Page 12 Compuuter Gaming World "

A available for today's memory-hungry games. Open MPEG Group Means Good News For Gamers amers tired of incompatibility problems with peripheral cards will be pleased to know that the manufacturers of MPEG video cards (hardware devices which allow computers to play back video according to compression standards set by the Motion Picture Expert Group) are meeting to avoid such hassles. During March of 1994, more than 80 people from approximately 60 companies met at intermedia to form the OM/1 (Open MPEG-1) Group. With digital heavyweights like GTE, Sigma Design, and Diamond Computer supporting the drive for a common API (Application Programming Interface) in order for all Windows and DOS programs to call MPEG files and establish basic settings, the group expected a new industry standard to emerge prior to this summer. Several industry leaders served as spokespersons for the effort. Jim Anderson, one of the founders of the VESA and MPC standards, observed in announcing his support of the OM/1 approach, Â«Without a standard, there isn't a market.\" Glenn Kaufmann from Diamond Computer (the leader in the graphics accelerator market for Windows) suggested that it will become increasingly important in the near future for entertainment and educational products to be able to shift video functions (scaling, color shifting, et. al.) to boards themselves. He asserted that there needs to be a standard API to assist this development. Dave McComb, one of the developers of the ReelMagic board, said that the group's goal is to ensure that every hardware manufacturer that wants to use MPEG can have the same driver and function calls for their hardware. This means that gamers shouldn't have to face many of the incompatibility problems between games and peripherals that we faced in the sound card driver wars. Technical specifications have not yer been finalized, but the group expects to agree upon specs by mid-year.

Atmospheric missions can turn into heared high-tech furballs. Not only must you take of you take on enemy craft in dogfights, but you have to watch out for surface-to-air lasers (SALs) or missiles (SAMs).

"REVIEW Space Operetta Nomad Explores The Lighter Side Of Galactic Genocide by Douglas Seacat 1135LC LOADING JAMI 1.SI NON OHRODIN new space exploration epic can evoke a number of emotions from gamers, Lamong them fear. It seems that few gamers these days have the time or energy to explore the thousands of stars, planets, and alien empires such games boast. While it's amazing to see games attempt to capture the scope of space itself, most players can be overwhelmed by the cosmic scale. Into this precarious niche comes Nomad, a space epic aimed at those who enjoy hurtling through space and interacting with alien races, but would rather not make a career of it. In the time-worn tradition of space games, Nomad begins with a 5,190 close encounter of an alien kind. In this case, it is a starship from an advanced civilization that craps out near Earth and crash-lands, no doubt in a Kansas wheat field. After determining that the ship can be repaired, the Earthling authorities select you to take command of an ambitious project to explore the universe. Your unbridled enthusiasm at becoming the first interstellar human traveler is tempered only by the fact that, once you leave, no help can be expected from Earth. SWEET and organic.

However, this doesn't mean Nomad is a ship by tracking through all the eligible ships nearby, then activate the scanner. The other commands are slightly more involved, but equally painless. Once a ship or planetary representative has been hailed, a portrait of the targeted alien is displayed with a box containing the \"translated\" dialogue. Through another series of menus, aliens can be questioned on any subject with which the player is familiar, divided into the categories: People, Places, Objects and Races.

Still, I found myself My greatest concerns involve spect to a classic is well and good, but there is an important line between homage and imitation, which Nomad comes dangerously close to crossing. Given Nomad's presentation, it is reasonable to expect a broader, deeper and altogether more involving game. But in comparison to other Space Exploration games, most notably Frontier and Privateer, Nomad comes up short. It simply isn't as large, doesn't pay off in as many hours of play, and doesn't have the same detailed atmosphere and scope. So Nomad is clearly not a game for veterans of the Space Epic, though it does have a lot to offer the casual gamer. Its play mechanics are well designed and easy to use, it doesn't require practiced flight simulator skills, nor an inordinate time investment. It's a game with an old but reliable plot, interesting characters, and a good deal of charm. Those who look to long-term commitments from their space epics should set a course for another star system, but those who actually work for a living and game \"on the side\" may find Nomad a fulfilling affair.

"391 troops, others hold information, a few produce train cars, but the vast majority are trading centers. At any given trading center there will be a few products produced there, and others that are in demand. One of the tricks of the game is finding out what products are in demand at each town. In most places, for example, fishing rods will be worth 5 to 10 Baks (a unit of lignite coal measure), but in Alexandria they are worth 50 Baks. Unless you stop in a trading town with the right product, there is no way of knowing ahead of time what any particular city will want. There are very few actual market forces operating in Arctic Baron. If a town will buy 50 units of mammoth dung for 40 Baks at one time, they will continue to do so as the game progresses. However, towns only produce so much in the way of goods to sell and restocking takes quite some time. As such, after a product line is traded out, there is a long lull before you are able to round up enough of that same commodity to make another trading circuit profitable. Another complication in the trading process is car type. Certain goods can only be carried with certain types of cars. Deciding the proper proportion of livestock cars, liquid cars, greenhouse cars, and standard cargo cars to add to the Transarctica is a major decision, particularly when balanced with the defensive and offensive cars required to survive trainto-train combat. Then there is the matter of slaves. In Arctic Baron, slave trading is an important part of the game. Slaves are used to dig mines and build bridgesâ€”small but necessary tasks. While a cheap allusion is made in the documentation to these slaves being of some kind of inferior race, it becomes apparent during play that captured enemy soldiers are the stuff of which slaves are made. Training For War Combat occurs whenever the Transarctica meets a train of the Viking Union on the tracks. Victory is achieved by destroying all the weapon and troop cars on the opposing train. There are two attack options for train combat: troops and weapon cars, with troops as the most versatile option. Disgorged from troop cars either as a whole or in smaller squads, troops can plant bombs on opposing trains and attack enemy troops directly. A bomb set on a car goes off after a small delay, destroytheir cargoes become a part of the Transarctica. The train combat is not, in and of itself, badly designed, but it is painfully slow. A simple combat on a 386-33 can take over 15 minutes to resolve, despite the fact that the actual combat routines are rather simplistic, and no great graphic or sound effects are in evidence. To the game designer's credit, there is an option that allows the player to skip O 1353 1353 combat all together. 0 Quest For Fire ing with a single blast the entire car and any troops left on it. Friendly troops that discover The quest, freeing the world from perpetual a bomb on their own train have a chance to winter, isn't particularly notable in either a disarm it before explosion. Thus, it behooves positive or negative sense. It is a typical matter the smart player to not only send out troops of showing up at the right places and gatherto the opposing train, but to keep some back ing the parts to make Operation Sun work. for defense. Of course, there are the requisite battles with Weapon cars come in two major varieties: the Viking Union to secure the day and save the world. Most players will probably not be machine gun and cannon. The machine guns that enthralled with the quest, but the game kill enemy troops within their fire pattern, doesn't lose replay value because of it. The quest really contributes little to the overall design other than some added motivation. While a solid game in general, Arctic Baron has a number of annoying rough edges. The main control icons are far too dark to be easily seen. When saving or retrieving a file there is no directory option, so a player just has to IN ORDER TO COMMIT SUICIDE remember their save names. The PRESS THE LEFT BUTTON OR THE RIGHT BUTTON TO CANCEL opening and closing music of the game is FM-generated and sounds while cannons destroy cars on the opposing tinny and weak. However, the sound effects inn train. As this requires multiple shots, and are superb and, to a degree, make up for the since guns are fixed so that they can fire in poor music. The sounds of the train on the only one direction, the placement of weapons cars in the string of the train is critical. A track are very well done and lend a real railroad feel to this game. group of weapon cars, when purchased, will all be hooked together in a clump at the end If this game were flawlessly constructed, a of the Transarctica, making them minimally player might easily be sucked into the reality effective. Going to a station and spreading of the background world, but the small, yet out the guns is a good idea that pays off annoying, quirks make one start to question handsomely. After combat is concluded, the the whole premise. If the world still has the remaining cars from the opposing train and technology for missiles, why isn't air transport a bigger factor? Why is there plenty of light on many of the outdoor scenes when there is supposed to be no sunlight? Since gasoline is a trading commodity, why aren't there gas-powered vehicles competing with the Viking Union's trains? At the end of the line, the heat of our enthusiasm for the originality of the game concept met with a small cold front of disappointment, resulting in this rather lukewarm review. Arctic Baron can still provide some fun play on a fast machine, but its small blemishes derail an otherwise original and delightful premise. Cow HAY Page 34 Computer Gaming World "

"primitive aliens think is a god; there's the one about the ancient god who turns out to have been an alien all along; there's the one about the virus that quick-thinking McCoy has to cure; there's the one about Harry Mudd gerting in over his head while trying to turn a profit from some alien salvage; and so on. Misunderstandings explode into bloodshed and are then cleared up while characters soliloquize about honor and compassion, just like on TV. Everything is slightly abbreviated, with most episodes taking place in only four or five rooms and containing only a handful of puzzles, and the soliloquies are shortened to a couple of lines apiece, but the feel is Star Trek through and through. McCoy's Poise Part of this authenticity comes from the ser design, full of red metal buttresses, bulky desktop computers, square panels covered with blinking lights, and sliding doors that whoosh open at a touch. More of it, however, comes from the soundtrack, which now contains layer upon layer of digitized bloops, whirrs, hisses, and clicks taken straight off the TV. Phaser fire sounds like phaser fire. Communicators trill the way communicators ought to. The Enterprise computer emits those weird, mechanical ratcheting sounds that no computer except the one on Star Trek has ever made. Supplementing the sound effects are snatches of music imported from several episodes of the series-not just Alex ander Courage's theme music, but samples of various battle, suspense, and reads the entry for Â«Daystrom, Richard\" \"comic relief\" themes as well. when you look up \"Chekov, PavelÂ» in the The heart of the matter, ships library.

"rough, relative comparison of the cards quality. To Illustration by I. E. Galindo The Sound Card and The Fury Making Sound Choices In Sound Cards A Tone By Any Other Name Before we get into the information on cach individual card, I should explain a few things about sound cards in general. For any one sound technology, there are often several companies which sell it under different brand names with slight variations for each card. This is further complicated because each brand often has a number of models to choose from. If you were to look closely at every one of these models, however, you would soon realize that they all use a few sets of sound chips. If you listen to music played on the Yamaha OPL-2 synthesizer chips of two competing sound cards, the only difference you will hear will be a bit less background noise from the card with the cleaner circuit board design. When a game box says it is AdLib or Sound Blaster compatible, it is saying that the music will play the same on any card with an OPL-2 chip. So it would seem that all we have to look at are the chips used on a sound card to determine whether it is the same as, or better than, another sound card. This is only partially true. Some sound chips can be reprogrammed by software run on your PC from a simple upgrade disk; some require software to be run every time you boot your PC for the card to work properly; some require software to be run only when you want to make some advanced feature available (like extra instrument sounds); and others require almost nothing but to plug them in. Before you say that the last one sounds the best, you should consider that each strategy has its own strengths and weaknesses. All of these sound chips are generically called DSPs (Digital Signal Processors). Sometimes a sound card manufacturer will buy a DSP from a chip manufacturer and program it to do their bidding. These general purpose chips tend to work more slowly than custom DSPs designed by the manufacturer for a very specific purpose. Both general P purpose and custom DSPs can come in reprogrammable and non-reprogrammable varieties. Once you learn about a few DSPs, you will be able to better judge which card is up to your standards. Donald S. Griffin is the owner of Computer Music Consulting in San Francisco. He has composed music for over 20 games and multimedia products, including Aladdin for the Genesis and Mario's Time Machine. Griffin is a registered developer with nearly every sound card maker. by Donald S. Griffin, Computer Music Consulting Then I tell people what I do for a The Sound Card And The Jury living, the first thing they often ask is Â«what's the best sound Sound quality varies from card to card, and card?\" You would think I'd have a quick the differences are certainly discernible if answer handy, but my usual reply is Â«It dethey weren't, we'd all be using the same card), pends.\" What do you want it for? Games? but in any comparison, there is room for Multimedia presentations? Making your own personal bias. So, rather than telling you what music? Playing with sound effects? All of the I think sounds the best, I worked with CGW above? to devise a \"blind taste test,\" if you will, of Since this is CGW you're reading, I suppose music synthesis quality. I selected a collection I could assume that you want the best quality of original General MIDI music, not progame music that you can get at a reasonable vided by the manufacturers, to play through price. But even with this simplification, things can be complicated. There are ease of each card and record onto a quality cassette installation issues, concerns about compatitape tape with no noise reduction. I also recorded bility, expectations for future expandability, examples of OPL-2 emulation from those anxieties about backward compatibility, and cards that provided it. A group of listeners special sound card features to consider. So, to from the gaming community and the CGW simplify things even further, I'll assume that staff were then asked to compare the music sound quality is your number one concern. from each card and decide which was of Besides, there are plenty of articles which just higher quality. This data was used to rank the list features, but I'm a composer, so I'll take cards in order of preference. The results can that perspective in looking at the different be seen in the table that accompanies this qualities of sound chips in today's sound article.

"STRATEGY EVEN MORE Machine Politics In The 21ST CENTURY Under The Hood Of SimCity 2000, Part Two by Robert L. Hayes, Jr. Photography by Susan Zurawik ast month we looked at the basic infrastructure of a city in SimCity 2000: its transportation system, power and water works. This month we'll get our hands dirty in the guts of the program, even going so far as to rip out a few formulac and examine them in detail. We'll examine the key factors-city growth, city services, basic city layout, pollution that can mean the difference between a struggling burb and a thriving a thriving metropolis. Conventions and Terms First, a few conventions need to be explained for greater clarity. SimCity2K uses a 0-255 point system to rank most of the important variables within the game. Land values range from 0 to $255,000/acre, pollution levels from 0 (nonexistent) to 255 (highly toxic), etc. These 0-255 rankings are also used for the characteristics of a given square on the map. Thus, a square may have a population density of 255 (an arcology), a land value of 133 ($133,000/acre), and a pollution level of city center, but it is more important to some 21 (mild pollution). With a few exceptions, than to others. Commercial zones have a high these variables are not available to the player, predilection for being at the city center, resibut they can be generally determined by using dential zones have a moderate preference, and the map overlay function. On an overlaid industrial zones have the lowest preference. map (the crime rate map, for example), no In SimCity2K terms, the closer a zone is to the coloring indicates a very low value (perhaps center, the higher its basic land value will be. less than 20), while near-black indicates an extreme value of possibly 225 or more. Police And Fire Departments An important concept in the SimCity2K Your police and fire departments have a model is that of the rent-bid gradient (and fixed range of effectiveness, with the exact here you thought this was just a computer effectiveness level diminishing with distance game).

In general, their location is not the land value grid in the map section (it's the a major consideration as fires are easy to put red crosshair). However, as you get closer to our and even the largest cities won't have the city center, it is more expensive to build enough fire departments to cover most of or rent a building; thus, a business owner their city in their protective envelope, so there must decide how much access to customers is no real harm in simply placing them wheror services is worth how much rent.

Using zone mixing, there is no problem with isolating parts of your city from one another; as long as the necessary zone diversity is available locally it doesn't matter that your industrial zone is five miles from the residents who work there. For optimal land prices, with their concomitant effect on land development, it is best to follow the RBG concept fairly closely. The very center of your city should be an almost entirely commercial core, with only enough zone mixing to allow buildings to develop. Surrounding the core should be your residential zones, and on the outskirts of your city, industrial zones should be turning the air black (and not incidentally, sharing some of their pollution with the nonexistent spaces off the map, rather than only with your city). Figure 7 shows a small city that roughly follows this principal. The Pollution Solution Pollution is nasty stuff. It has negative impact on land values and reduces life expectancy in your city. Keeping it minimized is always a good idea. There are five things you can do to keep the pollution levels low. First, and easiest, is to implement the pollution controls ordinance. Second, make sure you have adequate wastewater treatment facilities. Third, change your industrial tax rates so that polluting industries (steel, textiles, petrochemical, etc.) have a higher S rate than nonpolluting industries (finance, media, etc.). Fourth, isolate your heavy industry far from your city core, putting as much of it as possible at the very edges of the map. This means that at least part of your pollution will disappear from the statistics of your city. Finally, keep traffic levels low by intelligent street planning and/or mass transit use. The exact pollution level generated by a given square Bantumisen 22 can be generated, though the Fig. 7: This city is zoned for maximum land value and growth. procedure is complex.

Pollution Value = ((Previous Pollution The interim value, divided by your city's Value + Traffic / 5) + Square Pollution Outpollution divisor, becomes the new value for put) * 2 that square. Add 200 to the result if there is radioactive waste nearby (found only after a fission plant An example: let us assume that a brand new coal plant has just been built in an otherwise meltdown).

Rather than blowing your entire initial wad on laying out your dream city, zone a few areas with minimal if any, and slowly build your city block, maintaining profitability at all times. Generally speaking, dont start funding your services (it's all right to go ahead and build them to keep your citizens happy) until you are showing a balance of about $500/year in profits. Keep that $500 figure in mind, and only increase funding to the point where you will still be left with $500 income for the year. Handling growth slov like this, your city will remain mar and you won't go broke.

However, neither this one nor the other two are scrollable through prior maps. You can only display the map for the area you're actually in at the time. The fourth map is the travel map. This brings up a display of the entire continent, showing all the provinces. Clicking on a province gives you a close-up of it, with all the cities, towns, and villages to which you can travel. Clicking on a location tells you the distance and gives an estimate of the time needed to get there. Clicking on the \"travel\" button takes you there, with a minimum of fuss. While it may take weeks (depending on how far you're going) of game time, in real time it's a matter of seconds. Talking About My Character Generation Arena offers a nice spread of character classes based on the standard trio of Fighter, Mage and Thief. You can create a pure character of a single class or one with mixed class, such as a fighter/thief, mage/fighter, or even mage/thief/fighter. Each has certain advantages and disadvantages. Add in the eight races to choose from, and you have a lot to work with when building your character. The creation process can be as short or as long as you desire.

At this point, you could begin asking around for clues to Fang Lair, the first staff dungeon, or take out some time to explore and make money. The latter is the better course, and you won't have to look hard or long for opportunities. Every village, town, and city has something for you to do, but the best jobs are handed out by local rulers. These usually pay the most. However, this part of the game is afflicted with problems, so it's always best to save before accepting a noble's quest, just in case. Essentially, some quests are impossible. The usual culprit is travel time. All quests have deadlines, and there are occasions when you just can't travel from here to there, or from here to there and back again, within the time limit. It doesn't matter if you're escorting someone to another town, fetching an item from somewhere else, or rescuing the royal heir from a dungeonâ€”the time allotted is simply too short. In one case, the estimate Band until you're pleased with the results. The long way is to answer a series of ten questions about your character.

"for travel was woefully underestimated; what was supposed to take 70 days actually went over 90. This one was especially irksome, as I lost out on almost 20,000 gold. Ouch! The software isn't very stable, and even with three patches so far, problems still exist. The game is prone to crashing at inopportune moments, such as when you pick up those tablets/scrolls/etc. to get the staff dungeons on your map. I made it a habit early on of saving just before I grabbed the item, and that's a good habit to have. It is also a good idea to save often just on general principles, as the game can lock up or crash for no obvious reasons. While this doesn't happen a lor, it does occur often enough to make regular saving a necessity to avoid losing progress. Another problem is that sometimes the dungeon auto-map is not saved properly. Upon restoring a game you may find that most of the level you mapped is not there any more. All you see is a mostly blank parchment. This happened to me in the final dungeon, but fortunately, you only have to get through this dungeon, not out again. It can happen elsewhere, though.

"come by as your experience increases. Everything is isolated, and there is no sense of a coherent whole here. For all that, Arena does have some nice individual touches. The magic system, for instance, allows you to buy spells Â«off the rack\" or make your own (if you can afford it). Further, thieves have more opportunities in Arena chan in any other game. The towns can be a wonderland of wealth for the skillful and lucky picker of pockets, burglarizer of homes, and plunderer of shops. Also, the wilderness isn't just empty space as in other games.

After selecting game lineups, the program allows for different weather effects, designated hitters, relief pitcher warm-ups, Player Transactions Sara Rang STATENS Park: Sportsman's Park Era: 61956 N Games 1 Daltcd Ga n crst Sachants: Sac Flies: 1873 11841 091 111 1 3 17 1 Total w 175 Tot walks: 15 Hit bu pitch: 13 Strikeoutat -139 NILE on the marker at knowing when to replace a pitcher. Oddities like sticking a closer in the game in the second inning and leaving him in for the rest of the game for a 20-run pounding are nowhere to be seen. Pennant bases lineup decisions on the closeness of the game, the specific situation, and how late it is in the game. While it fails to recognize \"hot\" players, this is hardly a problem given the variety of decisions where it makes the right call. Game play from the human side is not so smooth. For instance, you sometimes need to decide whether the runner on second should try to score on a single to center field. The text provides only a couple of clues whether this base advance is reasonable, with your runner often being thrown out by more than ten feet. Pennant needs to tell you where the base runner is when the fielder reaches the ball. In real baseball, pinch-hitters are always announced before the pitcher places his foot on the pitching rubber. Pennant requires that you replace your pitcher before knowing who the pinch-hitter is, putting you at a disadvancage. The computer also never warms up its pitchers before use, which makes your pinchhitting decisions a little tougher. Even with Pursue The Pennant 5.0 D P grounders: Doubles: Triples! Home ES Stolen bases 12 Caught steals: B1 133 1 LG 127 619 wrounder: 0 Change Ern > D ack in the dim recesses of computer gaming's past, baseball simulations were almost exclusively text-oriented, statistics-based affairs. Beginning with the classic Earl Weaver Baseball, base hits on the computer required more in the way of graphics and sound, and even stressed action-oriented physics models. Still, baseball text games were able to carve out a niche, largely because of the statistical nature of the game. Pursue the Pennant began as a boardgame and has since developed into one of the most accurate baseball simulators on the marker today. This most recent version (5.0) features a redesign of the game's simulation engine, but is but is just as completely rexe-based as its predecessors. There are no spectacular bit-mapped ballparks or digitized photos of players that you would expect in higher-profile baseball products. What you do find is that Pennant, while not a large game, uses every byte possible to build a vast library of play results. The traditional radio-style transcription is presented in a text area below the hitting team's lineup and fortunately, the library is thorough enough that play description is rarely redundant. It even avoids those tired baseball clichÃ©s like \"can of corn\" for a high fly ball and \"rater\" for a home run that have plagued us since the like of Â«Dutch\" Reagan recreated games from telegraphed statistics. The game's replay value is also enhanced by a number of special situations, where players sometimes argue with the umpire or tumble down the dugout stairs while reaching for a foul ball. < Change l'ark> chilla purting MCHEURETANO Und data Crom the Sporting Meus Yearbook and injuries, which can wreak havoc with fragile catchers and pitching staffs. During game play, the batting team can steal bases, bunt, or try a hit-and-run. The pitching team can challenge hitters or pitch around them, an option that increases walks and decreases extra-base hits. The infield may be moved in to prevent a runner on third from scoring, the baselines can be guarded to decrease the chance of a double down the line, and corner men may be positioned to defend against a bunt. All these features are fairly common in text baseball games, though their implementation is much more clear and accurate here.

"Mille NIVEL Delibaca keeping track of injuries and demotions as they happened in real life, you will end up with an incredibly accurate simulation. This enormous amount of work is necessary, since Pennant provides no mechanism for automatically adjusting an active roster at a given date in the schedule, which is the game's biggest omission. Efter 133 I mariner Chirat harelu hit t er be there and third Law Fitur: vidual player situations through an event table, created through modification of the three stat forms available. When it's time for league simulation, Pennant can complete a 1000-game league schedule in under two hours. Pennant also allows you to enter league information, so that it can adjust results to reflect league averages. This allows more realistic play when teams from different time periods play each other. If a shortstop from 1905 makes 40 errors when the league average was 50 for shortstops, he is likely a better fielder than a shortstop from 1991 who made 25 errors when the league average was 20. Thus, he will perform berter than the 1991 shortstop when they play in the same league. Calleje TEXAS these quirks, the program plays a fine game of baseball. As with any good baseball simulation, Pennant is a natural for league play. Players can be created and moved throughout the league via a free-agent pool. Each team has a 40-man roster, with at least 25 players active, with manager profiles and primary lineups included for use against left or right-handed pitchers. These lineups have associated depth charts, which the computer manager uses to start a particular player in a certain percentage of team games. You can also designate lateinning defensive replacements and platoon players. Pitching rotations are generated through another set of profiles. You can choose the size of a rotation, spot-starter percentages, and depth charts for long relievers, set-up men and closers. The computer will ser these up upon request, but is very likely to stick players who pitched only a few innings in reliever roles that garner 60-to-80 innings of work per season. Therefore, it's better to put together all the depth charts yourself, which will reward your hours spent with a truly interesting and realistic season replay. During league play, Pennant handles indiNolan Ryan Like most games, Pennant can be abused. A player who had two hits in five at bats during a season is a .400 hitter, and if allowed 500 chances, can garner 200 hits. Worse, if one of those two original hits was a home run, expect about 100 home runs from that player over the course of a season. On the whole, you can expect about 10 percent variance in a player's statistics over the course of a season, easily in line with other stat-based games. Home runs vary more than any other statistic, because weather and park effects tend to alter home run production more definitely than they Steve Sax Range factors are even more crucial than error rates when determining how fielders affect a game. A poor shortstop will watch and wave at a ground ball hit up the middle, whereas an excellent shortstop takes away certain base hits. A Pennant team composed of fielders with excellent ranges will win 2030 more games per season than a team filled with lousy fielders, correctly emphasizing the importance of defense in baseball. Further, the discussions of the \"elite talent pool effect\" and the \"perfect hindsight effect\" in the game rules, are must-reads for anyone who has ever expressed frustration at Sandy Koufax's inability to match his 1966 Cy Young Awardwinning numbers in a simulated season. While Pennant does provide an accurate baseball simulator, it does require a lot of input from the user. If you go to the trouble of adjusting active rosters about once a week, Finally, like most games these days, bugs still lurk in the final product. Batters are sometimes skipped in the lineup, errors are charged that did not occur during the game, the league disk fails to include a National League schedule, and there is an occasional program hang-up when using auto-play. These are relatively minor and, to the company's credit, the designers have a good record of providing prompt upgrades to their games. So, in spite of a few errors, Pursue the Pennant 5.0 is a Golden Glover. Its overall accuracy and attention to detail is impressive, and it deserves a starting spor in an serious fan's lineup.

"WHY THE T' IN FM SOUND BOARDS MEANS 'FAKE. appreciate the CD quality vnnd delivered by the JAX With a headline like the one you just read, you might think an ad such as this represents a slanderous assault on the makers of FM synthesis sound boards. Well, it isn't. It's really more of a story about how all good things must come to an end. If only to make room for better things. Like the Ultra Sound MAX sound board. Until recently most, if not all, PC sound boards used a technology developed in the 1970s called FM synthesis (frequency modulation). In fact, the most popular sound board on the market today still generates sound via FM synthesis. However, UltraSound MAX (also known as just the MAX), the newest sound board from Advanced Gravis, incorporates a higher technology called wavetable synthesis. Even Van Gogh could What's the difference? Put simply, FM synthesis fabricates or Â«mimicsÂ» sounds with tone generators using mathematical formulas, while wavetable synthesis creates sounds using digital recordings of the actual sounds, known as samples. Therefore, the sounds created by the MAX are real, while the sounds created by FM synthesis boards are fake. (Thus, the impetus s in many cultures forgers and other for this advertisement.) fakers are sentenced to life imprisonment. And whether it's a guitar or a gorilla, the digitally-recorded sounds you hear will come F = ASIN (20/1 = + IsiN (2 ) straight at you in 16-bit, 44.1 kHz sound with over 90 dB of dynamic range.

We prefer to record a real piane. "


"Sarunas Flynthesis originated when people thought Recording with the MAX exceeds industry standards as well -16-bit, 48 kHz and 4:1 ADPCM hardware compression. Which means your recordings sound remarkable, yet use only a quarter of the disk space. Then there's also the general MIDI patch set included with the MAX. Basically, it's like having a 192-piece orchestra in your computer. What's more, the MAX's unique RAM-based there wounded god. Need we say more? system lets you modify any existing instrument, as well as create entirely new sounds. (Try that with a ROM-based sound board.) Now for those a little less into music and a little more into gaming, rest assured our engineers haven't Forgotten you. UltraSound MAX features two technological breakthroughs destined to adically change the nature of gameplay for years to come. The first allows you to experience 32 digital or synthesized voices at once, a feature exclusive to the MAX. The second is a revolutionary new concept called 3D Holographic Sound, which is simply the audio equivalent of virtual reality. Together, they will not only add substantial depth and dimension to your gaming experience, they will revolutionize how games are developed from now on. Imagine. You're on night patrol, deep in the jungle. It's pitch black. When suddenly, you hear the rustle of leaves above you and to the right. It's the enemy. You immediately turn and act, as if on reflex. Now that the MAX is here, such encounters can and will happen. No wonder Psygnosis, SSI, Sierra On-Line and LucasFilm are only a few of the developers starting to capitalize on the MAX's vastly superior performance. Of course, it's going to take some time for all software developers to unleash the powers of Ultrasound MAX. But until then, you'll be happy to know the MAX will run games designed for prior sound board ULTRASOUND technologies like Ad Lib, Sound BlasterTM and Roland MT-32. In fact, PC journalist John C. Dvorak wrote, Â«...the Ultra Sound has a Sound Blaster emulation mode so good that it sounds better than the Sound Blaster itself.Â» So if you have yet to put sound on your computer, or you're simply looking for the best way to gear up for the future, visit your favorite computer retailer and take home the Ultra Sound MAX.

The natural feel of the wheel Wheel is its authentic go-kart steering wheel and shaft, which have been ser ar a comfortable driving angle into sleek black ABS plastic housing. On the back side of the padded wheel are four fingertip switches, two on each side, that accommodate throttle, brake and gear change control. Aside from a serial connector and on/off switch on the rear of the wedge-like housing (for connection of foot pedal units), the rest of the unit is free of exterior fluff. Weighted and equipped with non-skid rubber seemed to make up for any lack of long term feet, the Pro Wheel does not require a table experience.

Ironically, falling out of the race with steering problems is an all too common occurrence at any level of racing. Without delay, a distress call was made to Wizard proprietor Bob Boulanger, and his assurance of immediate modifications before the ProWheel enters heavy production alleviated worries. I was also notified that NASCAR driver Bobby Labonte hadn't had any problems with his Pro Wheel, and, after further discussion, I discovered that the familyrun Wizard Racing is busy developing a pedal system (the ProPedal) that should be ready in the first half of 94. The world of digital racing has most definitely been improved upon with the ProWheel, and the above-average speeds seem to bear that out. The only problem is a slight loss in the pinpoint precision drivers have become accustomed to with a quality joystick. Although negligible in World Circuit (or in practice/qualifying with either sim), IndyCar racers may detect a subtle drift in their vehicle that becomes noticeable when battling heavy traffic. The additional practice necessary to overcome this drift is minor compared to the huge increase in Â«realism\" provided by the racy feel of a real wheel when pulling highspeed turns. The Pro Wheel is priced at $119.95 and comes with detailed setup instructions for IndyCar and World Circuit, a utility disk packed with car setup tips, graphic upgrades, instructions for F1SA competition on CompuServe, and other assorted shareware goodies designed to enhance both World Circuit and IndyCar Racing.

"Fie Options Starr Duties Planning Phase Running The ZOC Gauntlet If there were any doubts that Crusader is a wargame cut from classic cloth, they are soon dispelled by the attention given to that boardgame icon-the Zone Of Control. To wargamers, the ZOC is the modern equivalent of Â«The Game's Afoot!\"No, there is none of that area-movement silliness here, folks. ZOCs are restrictive towards enemy movement, but at different levels of effectiveness, dependent on who's doing the delaying. Units using Strategic movement have weak ZOCs, as they are considered to be in column. Units in defensive mode are very tough to get around, and a line of fortifications purs a big clamp on enemy movement. Weak ZOCs can be exploited by armored and motorized units, thus reflecting the terrain challenges of desert fighting. The rub is thar those weak ZOCs still affect supply, causing a multitude of tactical decisions to be made in a hurry by both sides. Such is the substance of which good wargames are made. At least units in enemy ZOCs are not required to attack, since this is an operational-level game. When you do make the decision to attack, you may: Probe: The tried-and-true method of gathering information about enemy disposition with minimal losses.

"REVIEW The Old Man And The Sea Can James Dunnigan Claim A Victory At Sea? At which point, of course, I woke up. Games do reach their players in various states of incompleteness, and Three-Sixty's Victory At Sea is a case in point. It's a rather extreme case, unfortunately, and my disappointment is magnified by the high hopes I had for this project. Can it be salvaged? Keep reading! The cover of the box says Â«James F. Dunnigan's Victory At Sea.\" This says a lot about the audience Three-Sixty Pacific is trying to reach. Dunnigan produced hundreds of boardgame designs back in the '60s and '70s, and he was one of the founders of SPI, a company that called its products simulations, not games, and promoted historical accuracy. Much of the appeal of Three-Sixty's games, particularly their V for Victory series, is that they measure up to the standards of the grognards who played Dunnigan's games in their youth. Victory At Sea is a simulation of WW2 in the Pacific, from the day after Pearl Harbor until the end of the conflict. It was conceived and designed as a campaign game, although by Bob Proctor there are also shorter scenarios of famous barrles. Both sides move simultaneously using a fast clock, and you stop the clockÂ» when I was sitting in the reclining you want to give orders.

It can't invade or manage supplies well enough to keep its troops from starving, and it loves ahistorical tactics like sending carriers on raids deep into enemy waters with almost no screening forces. This is a bad enough tactic for the Japanese, but it's inexcusable for the US Navy in early 1942!

They make the game longer (each takes only a second or two, but the time adds up over the course of a campaign), and their repetitive sounds get a little tiresome. I was more impressed with the game's beautiful interface design. Accurate or not, VAS makes a tremendous amount of information available without being overwhelming or confusing. First and foremost is the map, which uses 16 colors to show topography and 6 levels of zoom. The highest level shows half the globe, from California to India, and you can zoom in to see smaller areas in greater detail. You have a lot of control over what is displayed, and the computer keeps the screen readable by arranging names so they don't overlap. Even so, there's not enough room for the names of every base in the Pacific on one screen, so base names appear only at lower zoom levels. Once you get a useful view, you can save it and return to it quickly. Getting more information on a task force or base is a simple matter of clicking it with the mouse.

"STRATEGY A Little Piece of Vulcan, A Little Piece of Sol If you haven't yet experienced this multiplayer game of space conquest, it might be time to look up a private BBS in your area and log in. VGA Planets version 3.0 and up is a wonderful blend of Reach for the Stars, Master of Orion and Diplomacy. Up to 11 people can play this game by making their moves on their computers and then sending those moves to a host BBS. The host then compiles the moves and returns the results to the player. Each player takes the role of a specific alien race, and each race has its own special ship designs and talents which must be fully exercised in order to win. A sound strategy for building up a production base, defending your empire's perimeter, and going on the offensive is a requirement for success. In this article, I'll discuss some general strategy tips and follow up next month with tips tailored to each race. Spaceward, Whoa! As in most space battle-fests, early expansion is the first big task of the game. If all 11 races are being played, there is a good chance you will run into opponents very quickly, so it's important to grab as much territory as soon as possible. Special attention should be given to those worlds with native populations, especially those with ordered governments of Monarchy and above, as these will be your prime sources of money and future starbases. The first item of business is to examine the messages concerning the game's configuration carefully. This configuration will determine how effective your race's special abilities will be (particularly for players of game versions after 3.00). For instance, if you're playing the Crystalline Empire, the messages will tell you how effective your special web mines will be and if it is possible for them to be cleared. These messages will also tell you how often meteors will occur and therefore how many new minerals will be available as the game progresses. Next on the agenda will be the allocation of your resources to your production base. Initial funds will need to be divided between raising the technical level of your starbase, building ships, and planetary spending for mines, factories and defenses. Unless you are playing on the poorest settings, it is wise to increase some of your tech levels at your home world right from the start. By far the most important tech category at the beginning of the game is Engines, as this will dictate how fast you can colonize the surIllustration by N. Taylor Blanchard A Strategy Guide for Tim Wisseman's VGA Planets by Ted Foster ulletin boards have always been a forum for multi-human games. Whether rotisserie league sports games, trivia games, or strategy games, the local, private BBS has been a great place to find gamers with which to compete. It wasn't very long ago that ANSI graphics (crude pictures made of colorful text characters) were the leading edge in the displays on these games. Then along came Tim Wisseman's VGA Planets.

"22 Starfleet Rattles Expansion is a good thing, but all good things must come to an end...at least for a while. There will come a time when your expanding empire will bump into one, two, or even three others. Usually this happens at a time when you have many more colonies than you do ships, and many of those ships have few or no weapons. Thus begins the period I call the Â«Phony War.Â» At this point few players are ready to mount an offensive and will have a devil of a time trying to protect the colonies they already have. There are two basic strategies for this phase, and both can have their problems. The first strategy applies to those races like the Lizards and Bird Men. Because of the smaller size of their battleships, these races can build capital ships before most other races. If you have a battleship ready and good intelligence on your opponent's homeworld when contact occurs, there is an opportunity to deal an early deathblow. One or two of your ships is enough to take out a starbase if the defending player hasn't maximized his defense. Since he may have some fighters around, consider sending in a sacrificial ship with light guns to clear the fighters for your capital ship's attack. Factories. Mining Supplies.

Oxyd has to be the most artistically superb piece of programming that I have seen. From my position of having completed about one third of the single-player levels, the landscapes have been continuously varied with a marvelous attention to graphic and audible detail that makes each new one a continuing delight. I especially appreciate how the marble interacts in seemingly realistic but different ways when rolling over or bouncing against different \"natural\" (or unnatural) substances like stone, wood, swamp, freefall etc. At this point, I'm already worrying that I'll run out of levels (assuming ! keep solving the puzzles).

"REVIEW Pachyderm Platoon Microleague Brings Hannibal and His Famous Elephants To Your Hard Drive by M. Evan Brooks a simulation of this type. The map portrays the Roman and Carthaginian Empires, with an option to zoom in on geographic locations. Economic and military operations are depicted through use of static pictures. No one is going to be overwhelmed by the graphic opulence, but then again, a simulation of this nature does not necessarily require extravagant graphics. On the other hand, sound seems to be entirely absent, except for the occasional beep from the internal speaker. Again, an operational/strategic simulation of this nature does nor require much sound, but in this case, even a musical introduction is lacking. Hannibal's user interface is simplistic, yet somehow clumsy and obtuse. Mouse input via 11 \"hot buttonsÂ» accounts for the majority of actions. You may switch to a political overview map, view the main map, determine economic conditions (tax rate and allocations), leave winter quarters, march, switch to the market menu, split/merge armies, or negotiate/besiege cities. However, after each oprion is chosen, you must in effect reset the option menu by leaving the selected point of the menu.\" Easily forgotten, this can leave you continuously clicking the mouse button, wondering all the while why nothing is hapHannibal and the Second Punic War.

Hannibal, a European import, is the first such release. It is a detailed simulation of the Second Punic War, and more particularly, of Hannibal's attempt to achieve Carthaginian hegemony over the growing power of Rome. Ancient warfare has never been a popular subject in computer wargaming, but this seems to be the year of pre-gunpowder simulations, both in the computer and boardgaming branches of the hobby. With the decline of the Cold War, player interest has focused elsewhere, and the ancient period has undergone a revival both in terms of releases and interest. The period has traditionally lacked commercial success, as ancient military maneuver was often limited to occasional movement, and even in the great battles. opponents literally bludgeoned their way to victory or defeat. The question for games of ancient war, and thus for Hannibal, is whether the designers can overcome this inherent difficulty and provide both an entertaining simulation and one that realistically depicts history.

"space. IBM with Windows ($39.95). Circle Reader Service #2. HH Taking LA PEEK Tuneland FLIGHT Deadly Games 275 Community Drive Great Neck, NY 11021 (516) 482-4000 U-BOAT: Hey, is arra U-boat? Before you answer, know that Rene Vidmer (a founding partner of the board wargame company SPI) has added another simulation for the rest of us\" to his stable that already includes M-4 and Bomber. This time, you are the commander of a Type VII U-boat at the outbreak of World War II. The target pickings are initially ripe, but you must develop skills over the course of a campaign to deal with ever improving Allied ASW measures. Vidmer's U-boat is rich in visual and aural atmosphere (the box even includes a set of headphones), contributing to the Â«you are thereÂ» feeling of this easily learned and addictive little game. Macintosh ($59.95). Circle Reader Service #3. A quick look at titles now appearing on a store shelf near you.

This interactive cartoon environment for children ages 3 and up could easily be described as a Living Songbook. TuneLand uses traditional animation techniques and a lot of creative humor to teach the same kinds of songs and rhymes children would normally have to learn from Barney. IBM CD-ROM with Windows ($49.95). Circle Reader Service #1. U-Boat BOROV CLASS COX SELECT TORSCOOTO Colorado Spectrum 748 Whalers Way, E-201 Fort Collins, CO 80525 (303) 225-6929 SEAWOLF: After being in dry-dock for so long, the anticipated sequel to Electronic Arts' 688 Attack Sub has surfaced with some major changes. As the guiding spirit of a Uboat crew, you must manage weapons, sonar, navigation and communications, while keeping the overall picture of the engagement in mind. The familiar motif of individual stations is gone, replaced by small menus with pictures of the appropriate crew member. The game also features two-player games over a NetBIOS-compatible network. If you have a stereo sound card, you'll be treated to a dynamic underwater universe of sound, particularly in the sonar suite. Since both John Ratcliff and John Miles (providers of the majority of third party sound drivers on the market) were involved in the programming of Seawolf, you would be hard pressed to find an unsupported sound card. Certain hard-core simulation features have been left out to enhance overall playability, but the state-of-theart graphics, tremendous music by the Fat Man, and mind blowing sound effects all combine to lock this product dead on-target.

Griffin Enterprises, Alex Trebek, brings his digitized voice to an interactive version of his famed, intellectually-oriented quiz show. Digitized photos are hardly show stoppers, but are certainly better than the chcesy illustrations included with prior versions of this game. Gameplay itself lacks a high-tech gloss, but in fairness, much the same could be said about the TV show. The computer opponents run the gamut from imbecilic to reasonably bright, fairly typical for this type of game. The surprising thing is that the game, despite its many flaws, exudes a certain degree of charm, as it emulates both the good and corny aspects of an American icon. IBM ($29.95).

Though the games in the Casino Lite series feature advice from such notables as David Sklansky and David Malmuth, the text-based information leaves much to be desired, and the interface plays too close to the vest, not being nearly as intuitive as one would prefer. The package does offer three serviceable games, however. The first is 7-Card Stud, familiar to anyone who knows much at all about playing poker. Opponents range from ignoramus to intelligent, with a couple of the players being very aggressive when betting. The other two games are variations of Hold'Em, from Texas and Omaha. Of the two, Omaha Hold 'Em is preferable, including excellent notes from Bob Ciaffone to help the novice form a decent strategy. IBM, $14.99. Circle Reader Service #8.

The stalwart detective who made his debut in Alone in the Dark has to recover a child who has been kidnapped by One-Eyed Jack, the ringleader of a wretched band of smugglers, cutthroats and gangsters. In an effort to rescue the tiny tike, Carnby must negoriate some 15 levels of 3-D territory abounding with mazes, trapdoors and secret passages, while doing his best to simply survive. The animation looks smoother and more lifelike than in the original title and objects appear more realistic.

You arrive in Las Vegas a few days prior to a big poker tournament with only half the tournament entry stake in your pocket. The major challenge of the game is raising the other half in time, thus forcing you to mess around with preliminary fundraising chores.

This game is as far out as Haffner is likely to get, since pro wrestling is as much entertainment as sporting contest. Similar to Haffner's TKO Boxing, the game uses little in the way of visuals, but displays blocks of text written in the style of an old radio show (Â«The Warrior goes for the drop kick, and Hogan is down! He's moving in for the pin...\"). The system is quite clever, with different competitors awarded Â«stars\" that can be used like wild cards to break holds, make terrific leaps, and generally spice up the game.

Now, for the good stuff: HighScore is a grid-based mathematical strategy game where 1-2 players vie for a cumulative high score. Players move horizontally (or in some games, vertically) across a grid and add the positive or negative numbers to their aggregate scores. At the higher difficulty levels, you can even end up winning with a negative score. Flipover is a traditional memory challenge game. It's a simple version of Concentration with no rebus to be solved in the background. Both High Score and Flip Over are highly configurable and offer one or two player options with \"smart\" computer opponents.

While the interface is much better than the old text-based version, and this new incarnacion does allow you to play under Windows, the gameplay really hasn't changed much, except that now you can fire photon torpedoes in only 8 directions instead of 16. As weapons are fired, the energy drain becomes more noticeable, and you must dock often with a friendly starbase. Beware though-on the higher levels, your enemies can actually move, rather than sit dumbfounded in a sort of galactic turkey shoot like they do early in the game.

On the sleepy side are Roulette and Tracers. Roulette may offer the quietest casino ever. There is no click as the ball migrates toward its numbered cache (or cash, assuming you've bet on the right number) and no patter from the croupier to signal the end of betting. In fact, there is nary a sound to be heard. The most tired title in the pack is Tracers. Tracers provides an archaic blast from the past reminiscent of the Tron lightcycle idea. Unfortunately, Windows' TILES AND TRIBULATIONS: Tiles and Tribulations may prove to offer more of the latter than the former to most gamers. The game features 50 levels of tumbling tiles. With the look and play of a modest shareware game gone commercial, this Tetris derivative features good music, fair graphics, modestly enjoyable play, and a few visual glitches that attest to its \"nor-quite-ready-for-prime-time\" status. Though it offers considerable variety in scoring opportunities (different tile configurations carn different point values), the playing experience doesn't seem significantly different from Tetris. Indeed, we thought the game was a bit pricey for what it offers. IBM with Windows ($39.95). Circle Reader Service #14. Whirlwind Page 178 Computer Gaming World "

"* COMPUTER GAMING WORLD HALL Welcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. War in Russia Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1984 Apple The first \"monster\" wargame on the computer, War in Russia depicted the action on the Eastern Front during World War II. ExperSSL Cienced gamers came to discover that the Al could be faked out easily in an early move of subterfuge, but the game continued to have popularity because of its scale, subject matter, and suitability for playing by mail (players could easily save their moves, send a disk to a friend, and wait for the friend to return the disk for their next move). It was popular among wargamers for as long as the Apple II remained alive. Wasteland Interplay Productions, Inc., 1986 Apple, C-64, IBM The Bard's Tale (Electronic Arts, 1985) Battle Chess (Interplay Productions, Inc., 1988) Chessmaster (The Software Toolworks, 1986) Civilization (MicroProse, Inc., 1991) Dungeon Master (FTL Software, 1987) Earl Weaver Baseball (Electronic Arts, 1986) Empire (Interstel, 1978) F-19 Stealth Fighter (MicroProse, Inc., 1988) Gettysburg: The Turning Point (Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1986) Gunship (MicroProse, Inc., 1989) Harpoon (Three-Sixty Pacific, 1989) Kampfgruppe (Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1985) King's Quest V (Sierra On-Line, Inc., 1990) M-1 Tank Platoon (MicroProse, Inc., 1989) Mech Brigade (Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1985) Might & Magic (New World Computing, 1986) M.U.L.E.

The game proved the value of a skillbased role-playing system and created interesting algorithms for handling the non-player characters. One couldn't simply strip the NPCs of their items as in other games; the NPCs had Â«mindsÂ» of their own. Further, although the game was combat intensive and used a computerized form of Michael Stackpole's Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes game system, it was replete with ethical dilemmas and non-combat puzzle-solving of the most devious sort. The story was written by Mike Stackpole, and many of the maps were fleshed out by veteran game designers like Liz Danforth and Ken St. Andre.
