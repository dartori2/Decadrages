The Trials, Tribulations, And Thrills Of Setting Up A Home Network by Loyd Case lively, and a human opponent extends the lifespan of this game almost indefinitely The only complaint is that it is only a two player game, at the moment—and gamers being the way they are, they want more. An expansion disk adding more players and scenarios would be very well received. And finally, the farther you go, the closer you get to the beginning; the most connectable strategy game I have seen this year is one of the oldest games around.

Be it airplane, tank or even giant robot, in simulations your tactical choices are unlimited, and the weakness of computer opponents is usually glaring; silicon still has problems with freedom of choice. Almost every simulator out there gets \"figured out\" fairly quickly.

The only downside to FALCON is the high memory demands of the program itsell, which makes it hard finding room for network card drivers. The only other networkable \"real vehicle\" simulator is SEAWOLF by Electronic Arts. Unfortunately the lameness factor of this particular sim (in my humble opinion, at least) is so high that a two-player limit is too low to redeem it. Next time someone thinks multi-player sea sim, think fleet work and wolfpacks. From the extremely arcade side of simulators comes Velocity's SPECTRE and SPECTREVR. The basic game and its successor are basically BATTLEZONE on some serious chemical enhancements. The pace in SPECTRE is furious, as up to eight players skim over the vector graphic landscape blasting away at each other in no-holdsbarred combat. Though the game is very simple, it can be as much as two hours before you come out of your combat-induced adrenaline-haze, and then only because your fingers and wrist are no longer responding to commands. SPECTREVR upped the ante by giving limited flight capability to the tanks, adding weapons and quadrupling the number of different \"games\" to be played-unfortunately, neither version allows players to join forces against the computerized foe. While both games epitomize networking action at its wildest, Velocity has made a poor choice in copy protection; each computer needs a distinct copy of the game. While I am sure this discourages common piracy, it unjustly penalizes multi-computer households. Home users are not businesses, and they can rarely afford to buy multiple copies of the same game. I'm not sure what the correct answer to net-piracy is, but I am sure this is the wrong one. The Science Fiction arena is not empty of net brew-ups either. Both Dynamix and Origin have dipped their toes in with products that bring multi-player action to already developed game \"universes\". BATTLEDROME offers Mech gladiatorial combat set against Dynamix's METALTECH realm, where \"Two legs Good! Tracks or wheels Bad!\" has become the military slogan of choice. Players can operate the metal juggernauts against computer opponents or human ones, in pit fights where virtual money is wagered. Big winners can not only afford repairs to their cybernetic steeds, but also better weapons, or a bigger mech altogether. 44 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. FEBRUARY 1995 "

"CONFEDERATION SHIPS ARROW Swift as its name implies, this ship turns almost effortlessly, even on high game difficulty settings. A good ship to start with, since the lasers and ion cannon allow it to strike quickly and run if necessary. HELLCAI The spiritual descendant of the old Rapier class, the Hellcat is an excellent all-around fighter. Reasonably fast and very maneuverable for its size, it is good for any mission except taking on capital ships. 0 = COUTUCATION VMRY EXCALIBUR An experimental fighter which outclasses nearly every other ship in the game. Almost as fast as an Arrow, the Excalibur sports two Reaper Guns and four Tachyon Cannon, which allow it to rip through an enemy's shields in one or two bursts. Fly this whenever opportunity arises. SAN I'M BRINGING HER IN Unlike previous WING COMMANDER games, you must land your fighter on the carrier, where the hangar walls resemble those of Doom, but with even better perspective and depth-of-field view. THUNDERBOLT: A good heavy fighter, this craft is less ponderous than it first appears. Eight gun mounts (six in front) make short work of other fighters, and the Thunderbolt can even hold its own against small capital ships. LONGBONE Despite the arrowhead shape of the fuselage, this heavy bomber moves like molasses. Although it works best with a fighter escort, the Longbow is well-shielded and armored, and can put up quite a fight versus enemy fighters using its complement of laser, particle and neutron guns. KILRATHI SHIPS DARKET. A typical Kilrathi light fighter, this opponent is lightning-fast, with incredible maneuverability, especially on high difficulty levels. Darket tend to operate in packs, where their light armament is less of a liability. combat aspect of WING COMMANDER is almost incidental to playing the thing. The story you are moving through is so interesting and the characters so well detailed that you almost wish you didn't have to strap into the fighter just see what happens next. The storyline of a WING COMMANDER game used to be a gimmick to make what was basically a space combat game seem more interesting, especially to people who weren't dedicated sim-pilots; but things have come full-circle now, and it's the story that is the point and the flight-sim that is the gimmick. You move through the story in a series of cinematic sequences and conversations that arrange themselves according to your actions on the field of combat. Often in conversation you will have one opportunity to choose a type of response that affects the course of things, or how a character relates to you for the rest of the game. Sometimes these choices are unsatisfying, boiling down to either being a jerk or kissing up, but for the most part, your own personality can guide events. While I lack the film course credits and salary to be a film critic, I am qualified to judge writing, plot and the SF element itsell, and I can tell you without an ounce of hesitation that WING COMMANDER is at least as good as any SF movie made in the past two years, and superior to any given episode of Star Trek: Any Generation (unfortunately, that's not much of a compliment). From the opening sequence to the finale, if you aren't driven to find out what happens next, you must have the imagination of a newt. In essence, plot development is your reward for going out on a mission. Now this isn't MacBeth by any means; it's a good B-movie that is marred by only a couple of excruciating lines of dialogue. But this is so superior to what passes for writing and plotting in the industry that in context, it is MacBeth. Perhaps the best part of the \"Cinema\" portion of WC3 is the fact that it is crafted with some care and attention to the material. The VictoTy actually looks like a military ship, cramped, utilitarian and no wall-to-wall carpeting on the bridge. Characters, while not completely free of clichés, are at least passionate and dynamic. And the acting is good enough that you almost find yourself interested in your wingmen as people and not just as victory points. The cast is strong and while my job isn't to critique acting, all the big names do a good job; but, to be honest, it is some DIRARA NA The familiar enemy has been enhanced from Well to include both Meson and Particle Cannon. But if you can survive the four Infrared missiles the Dralthi carries, it is easy prey for any Confed ship. PAKTANN Confederation pilots wish that their bombers were this good. Four Plasma Guns and two lon Cannon are augmented by a Mass Driver in the tail section approach with caution! The Paktahn's odd shape makes it difficult to target as well. STRAKHA Wing Commander II pilots may not even recognize this deadly adversary. While it has a plentiful array of guns and missiles, it is the improved stealth ability of the Strakha which has caused many a Confed pilot to meet an untimely doom. VARTOTI. The best fighter of the Sons of Kilrah is capable of handling any Confederation craft. These jump-capable vessels can pop up anywhere, and generally feature some of the best Kilrathi pilots. The Thunderbolt, although slower, has the firepower to go toe-to-claw with this enemy. 108 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD FEBRUARY 1995 "

A castle has hot air balloons which drift over the landscape, gathering up the manna you've possessed and returning it to your castle for safe keeping. A small castle can only hold a small amount of manna. When your castle fills, you must enlarge it. You'll need to keep a close eye on the strength of your castle's walls. If monsters or other wizards succeed in reducing or destroying it, all of your hard-won manna will spill out.

You can then move on to the next world, or fly around gathering up manna and spells you may have missed, or just enjoy the scenery. Restore all 50 worlds and the game is won. You'll need eight megabytes of RAM to experience MAGIC CARPET in its unabridged form, although you can play it with six or even, Bullfrog claims, four megabytes by turning off ambient sounds and some of the effects like sky and shadows. With MAGIC CARPET, Bullfrog is pushing the edge of the hardware envelope, and only those with the fastest machines need apply. The game is optimized for play on a Pentium, and to run it on even the fastest of 486 PCs requires compromise. On a 486/66 PC without local bus video, I had to turn off some of the video effects (sky, motion blur, etc.) to get smooth motion. And that's in low resolution mode. Don't even consider the high resolution mode unless you've got an 8 megabyte Pentium with a fast PCI bus video card. MAGIC CARPET also provides two 3D modes: red/blue 3D (glasses provided), and Stereogram (those random dot pictures that some people can't see). It also supports the VFX I Virtual Headset, although I didn't get a chance to test it. Finally, the game can be played on a network with up to eight wizards vying for supremacy. Unfortunately for most of us, it does not support modem play. MAGIC CARPET provides a wonderful blend of first-person shooter and strategy game. You'll need both eye-hand coordination and resource management skills. You must know your spells and keep them programmed for easy access at a second's notice. You must learn to keep your eye on your castle, your balloons, your manna, and the other wizards, while simultaneously dueling with dragons. Captured by its spell, MAGIC CARPET will keep you busier than a Sorcerer's Apprentice. LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN A handy way of dealing with a cluster of enemy forces, such as these Demons, is to cast the Lightning Storm spell. The spell floats above, stabbing any living creature with scorching lightning fingers, often killing everything in its reach. BURNIN' DOWN THE HOUSE Why use that puny one-shot flameball when you can unleash a firestorm like this? The Meteor erupts in a torrent of fire that can denude hillsides and burn castles to their foundations in seconds. THE EDITORS SPEAK MAGIC CARPET RATING RATING ** PROS A fevered first-person shooter with real strategic depth; amazing visual effects for the spells; a cutthroat network mode. CONS A game that will push your hardware to the limit, and then some. YOU'LL POMPEI FOR THIS! Here we've installed a lovely, active volcano in the living room of an opposing wizard. Sadly, it didn't fit very well, so we had to burn the castle walls to the ground. 126 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  FEBRUARY 1995 "

"What's That Tune? Shocks computer with an ATI Graphics Pro Turbo (2 MB VRAM) video card, and eight MB 70 ns RAM. This combination of equipment really had NASCAR racing, although even at such a level of computing prowess, little bits of detail and/or numbers of opponents had to be reduced in order to keep the frame rate up. Is it all worth it? Well, just how much of a racing fan are you?

Wrench work is quick and easy, which is good because you'll be doing a lot of it if you want to win. Adjusting shock stiffness should be an early priority, since the defaults are uniformly lousy. The left front shock often has the greatest default stiffness, yielding terrible handling on left-turning ovals. 1 Herodynamics 2 Front Air Dam Rear Spoiler Done Dore Done LOSE 65° 20 gal Greater downforce also increases resistance, and only testing reveals the best solution for each track. Even fuel capacity must be considered, since each gallon weighs almost seven pounds. But empty tanks make the car tend to understeer, Gears WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS... NASCAR RACING ships with nine tracks: the superspeedways of Talladega, Michigan, Atlanta, and Darlington; the smaller ovals at Phoenix, New Hampshire, Bristol and Martinsville, and the sole road course at Watkins Glen. In Papyrus tradition, all circuits are faithfully recreated, as are the included NASCAR cars. While some of the big guns are curious in their omission (you won't find a Dale or a Bill), there is sure to be some logical reasoning behind their absence, and the extremely authentic recreation of the Mark Martin, Rusty Wallace, and Geoff Bodine cars are more than threatening enough. Completely variable detail is available at each and every track, as is minimum and maximum frame rates, and the number of cars that are actually drawn ahead and behind. Removing the grass texture at Watkins Glen may be just what it takes to get the game running smoothly on your machine, and alter all, it is only grass. The ultimate goal of the NASCAR Racing racer would have to be a full race distance victory against top notch opponents, but before one runs, one must learn how to walk, and it is advisable to drop the opponent skill level to say 90% or so, then begin by checking out the feel of a NASCAR in a practice session. Pull up a relatively easy track such as Talladega, and you'll quickly discover that you're in command of a big, rumbling, sliding, land whale. Meet Mr. Wall. Meet Mr. Tire-On-Fire. Have fun. Get pissed off. It's all a learning (aud deprogramming, for you INDYCAR fans) procedure. But, gradually, it will come together. Soon you'll be truckin' along with some back markers, then attempting a big, looping pass, then recognizing the facets that make NASCAR RACING such a popular pastime for both racers and fans alike.

It will still be playable by modem and e-mail. * Attention PANZER GENERAL players. The early rumors on a follow up product indicate that it will not be an expansion disk. Instead, a full sequel product is on the drawing board with the working title of TANK COMMANDER. It is shaping up to include about nine scenarios for a British desert campaign, 14 for a British/US Western Front campaign, and about 17 scenarios for a Russian Campaign (including some fighting in Finland!). Conspicuously absent from the list of scenarios were Khal-kin Gol (the Russo-Japanese battle in 1939), Dunkirk, and a Red Star/White Star campaign on that great Berlin map from PANZER GENERAL. Also, note that the Windows '95 version of PANZER GENERAL (whenever it becomes available) will feature some of the improvements being made in the game's engine for TANK COMMANDER. *One of our favorite board games, West End Games' JUNTA, is being converted to an online format for The Multi-Player Games Network. David Oldis at Tantalus software is heading up the project and is considering some of the board game's more interesting variants for an on-line appearance. JUNTA IS fun at about one revolution per hour as players assume the roles of leading families in a corrupt banana republic. After the back stabbing, threats, and revolutions sweeping through the streets of the capital, the winner is the player who has skimmed off enough money to have the largest Swiss Bank account. * Here's a note from Brian Walker, former editor of \"another computer game magazine,\" who reports the following from the UK: \"Empire Strategy have announced the forthcoming release of CIVIL WAR. This is their follow up to FIELDS OF GLORY, the Napoleonic game published by MicroProse in the US. (A game that proved remarkably popular considering the almost total absence of any AI). Many of the features that were slated to be in FIELDS, such as modem and network play, will definitely be included in Civil War. There should also be a 3D action battlefield with texture mapping, unlike FIELDS' tile-based maps. While the thrust is the campaign game, there will be scenarios (historical, random, and custom). They're still debating whether to make the game CD only, because the floppy version cannot include all of these features.\" Thanks for the update, Brian. * News abounds concerning TACOPs. A scenario disk for the Mac version of the game has been released with some quasi-historical Desert Storm scenarios. Sometime in the Summer, says Arsenal guru Jim DeGoey, a Windows version of TacOps will be gracing PC gamer's computers. Their WWII version of the game (PANZERS EAST) should be released soon thereafter. For more information, call Arsenal Publishing at (800) 247-1877. * A more PERFECT GENERAL? As many of you who walk the wargaming side of cyberspace know, an industrious computer wargamer/programmer has hacked a PERFECT GENERAL Scenario editor and map maker.

"This one you won't want to miss. It's been nearly three years in the making with a budget we won't even talk about. It employed a team of over a hundred people, including programmers, artists, musicians and writers as well as Hollywood make-up and special effects houses (we liked the flames in Backdraft so we hired the movie's special effects house to bring in a little heat). As the creators of Wasteland \"and The Bard's Tale\", our goal was to produce a game every bit as innovative and unique. We think you'll like the results. Art and Stuff Graphically, the game is state-ofthe-art stunning (we're a little biased but check out the screenshots for yourself). We used a combination of live actors and computer generated creatures with Silicon Graphics environments and magical effects which were painstakingly rendered down to the finest crack, doorway and magical lightning storm.

In particular, scenarios depicting the development of the Roman legion are missing. Where is the Fall of the Republic (Sulla versus Marius), The Roman Civil War (OCtavius vs. Antony), or at the very least the Falling Out of the Triumvirate, pitting Caesar vs. Pompey vs. Crassus? Also, while the Battles of the Diadochoi (Alexander the Great's successors) are present, the actual campaigns of Alexander and his father Philip are nowhere to be seen; neither is the Persian Empire, that scourge of classical Greece.

While the abstract combat has the advantage of allowing you to play through campaigns rather quickly, a near perfect design would be to integrate an additional tactical module into the game itself or allow miniatures results to be entered into the game's database. Still, the combat results have the right historical feel, since, for example, neither elephants nor phalanxes perform as well in rough terrain as on a plain. APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING The biggest deception within the game is the relatively weak economic environment. For instance, one can easily sell assets (food, textiles, etc.) each turn, but any sale depresses the market by a fixed amount, and each additional sale has the same market depression value rather than dynamic incremental changes reflecting actual supply and demand. Further, the economic marketplace is limited and does not reflect the strengths and weaknesses of actual geographical locations. Further, the diplomatic frenzy of the game often works correctly for the wrong reasons. LEGIONS is often a game of form Fritz the heavy thinker BBA Circle Reader Service #355 "

Colonies and your own home planet are based on the old \"build tiles and place them\" system that seems to be all the rage these days. Your facilities to choose from run the usual gamut of power plants, homes, hospitals, mines, etc., and their build times are amazingly fast. Don't be too worried about underestimating your food consumption rates, as an entire farm can be built in a day or so; in fact, money is a far more limiting factor for getting what you want when you want it. In another slave-to-fashion move, you must also hire \"advisors\" to get things done for you in the fields of Research, Development, Construction, Warfare and Flight. The more money you spend on these advisors, the more efficiently things will get done, and every so often they will have something to say, but not often enough to justify their pay. As you may have inferred by the presence of a Research division, there are quite a few amazing discoveries to be made, but, as with construction, the actual act of research passes so quickly as to be irrelevant. Basically the issue is how long it takes (i.e. what events you've triggered in the plot line) for somebody to tell you something is possible; from there it's usually less than a couple game-days before you're punching your new widgets out on an assembly line.

"6.9020DN He ruled the auto industry. 54352 2927-11-29-23 Terrain BUILD DEMOLISH Cara wala Stadium ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER PLANETARY BASE SIM CITIZENS will find plenty of familiar landmarks in REUNION. Ships must be organized into fleets in order to move, and they are basically grouped into fighting, transport and satellite-dispensing fleets. Once you get things rolling, your homeworld production facilities will need greater and greater amounts of minerals from off-world, so a healthy set of mining colonies are vital to success. Unfortunately, there is no way to create automated trade routes, so fleets must be manually lifted off, sent to their destinations, landed, and then loaded/unloaded. Except for the flight between worlds, when the player can switch to some other aspect of the game, ship movement consumes the player's attention and effort. Automated trade, as in Sierra's ALIEN LEGACY, would have been very useful here. Combat has little to do with the player: it is simply a matter of numbers, quality of equipment, and how good or rather, how expensive-your Military Advisor is. Battles occur first in space between ships in the same system; then in the planetary atmosphere between surviving attackers and those defense ships assigned to the world in question; and finally between ground forces which fight it out—winner takes all. Your only real insight into the combat is a display of colored lights representing ships which blink out as they die, some graphics of stuff flying around and exploding, and a tally screen at the end that tells how many ships took the next great step in spiritual development. The story itself is pretty standard and is definitely from the Battlestar Galactica handbook of «How to wander the Galaxy and get into trouble.» While you must discover the reason for Earth's downfall, as well as the planet herself, the plot isn't on par with the STAR CONTROL 2 drama of finding the place quickly, and then cracking the force-field before things get really ugly in that section of the Galaxy. The alien races you encounter are pretty mundane, and they behave simply as plot points with pretty masks on. Most of your actions will not alter their behavior, short of the \"help them or kill them\" choice. Early in the game you find little saucer aliens sharing your star system, and even if you help destroy the enemy fleet harassing them, their base is destroyed anyway. The only effect is to reduce the presence of the enemy fleet. If you do help, you are not bothered for a while; if you don't, then they come after you soon after the saucer aliens bite it.

"He ruled motion pictures. SPEED KILLS It seems that REUNION relies on speed to cover up the weak points of the game. Everything from combat to movement to research happens so fast that you end up doing things, not in the order of occurrence or importance, but when you can get around to them. Ships wait in orbit until you have time to unload them, and colonies sit undeveloped until you have a moment to pay for the buildings that were finished in an afternoon. The only two 543se 2929-1-es11 WE ADVISE YOU TO INCREASE OUR SALARY Paying more to your advisers increases operating efficiency, but their advice isn't very profound. things a player must quickly respond to are combat and SimCriyesque demands from your population for hospitals and stadiums. Actually, combat develops so quickly that there is little a player can do to prepare if he hasn't already done so. Once you're warned that an enemy fleet has entered a system, you have about ten seconds real-time until the actual attack takes place. And there is no option to change the rate that time passes. The player is stuck at a speed that gives everything a feel of superficiality. In taking elements so blithely from other SF games, REUNION has lost any soul of its own, especially when these elements are all less detailed than players are used to finding in other games. The appeal of technology research is well-known to anybody who has ever discussed CIVILIZATION OR MASTER OF ORION with a gamer. But when the treatment is so superficial that a player can actually watch a Starship design being developed in half a minute, much of the potential appeal is lost. REUNION is probably not for the gamer of even average experience, who will find it too simplistic and derivative for the time involved. Younger audiences or adventure game fans who must conquer every plot may enjoy it, as well as those looking for some light entertainment. While the design does have a few THE EDITORS SPEAK dozen hours of play packed in to it, REUNION most SF fans will RATING find the technical aspects so thin as to PROS Quick and simple game play be distracting.

"He ruled the shipping lanes. captive, why not send him to the Mixing Room, along with up to five more critters, to be magically crossbred into a fearsome new beast? (Well, hopefully fearsome.) Alterwards, you can return to the field and turn your dastardly creation loose to wreak havoc on your enemies. If all of the above sounds chaotic and bizarre, well, you've caught the spirit of the game. DOMINUS is not for armchair generals who like to ponder their every move. There are few welloiled offensive thrusts or flanking maneuvers to be seen, rather, the typical Overlord will find himself hurling everything but the kitchen sink in the clans' path in a harried, whatever-works panic. Only in the endgame, when the invaders have been reduced to one or two of the most powerful clans, do you have the luxury of contemplation. KITCHEN SINK, INC. \"Everything but the kitchen sink\" is a good description for DOMINUS' blend of multifarious gaming styles, and it applies to the game's visual style as well. D&D-inspired medieval fantasy worlds are not noted for their consistency and believability, but DOMINUS takes this trend to an extreme-everything is garish and random, with no apparent internal logic. For example, a captured Raider might tell you he fears \"creatures created by magic.\" But which are those? Oculauruses: Ungorotas? Arachners? Who knows? They're all weird, and neither the game nor the manual helps distinguish one brand of weirdness from the other. Cancel KINGDOM COME The colored flags on this kingdom map represent the invading clans that are burning and pillaging their way toward your castle. Time pressure is another element that will either please players or annoy them to no end. The clock doesn't stop ticking while you're mixing spells, building traps, or tormenting prisoners, and you're likely to emerge from an extended interrogation session to behold dozens of invaders cavorting happily through your kingdom's gardens. You can set the game to alert you to the invaders' movements, but this can backfire, continually interrupting your spell research attempts with warnings of new troop movements. The bewildering array of things to do, combined with the lack of predictability and the time constraints, ensure that DOMINUS is never boring. Frustrating, yes. Aggravating to the point of madness, yes. But never boring. It's not the type of game you play for ten hours straight. It's the type of game you play for an hour before dropping to the floor, mouse hand a-twitching Aristoteles Onassis Photo: UPI/Bettman FEBRUARY 1995. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 197 "


"Tom THINGS OMINOUS There are, sadly, some problems. DOMINUS promises randomly-generated clans for each game, and so you expect randomly-generated clans. But in every game I played, many clans retained the same characteristics over and over again. The Fire Demons were always deathly afraid of spinners, the Raiders were always terrified by \"creatures created by magic\" (whatever those are), and the ill-named Raveners were scared of everything, they were usually wiped out by their braver brethren before I ever had to come to terms with them. If you opt for the CD version, be aware that it supports no limited installations. All 30 megabytes are dumped directly to your hard drive, including many graphic cutscenes that one would think could be accessed from the CD, since the game requires the disc be in the drive at all i times anyway. e g A BREED APART Five beasts in the Mixing Room are about to be magically combined into a new the creature, which will hopefully possess all of their best qualities. DEBUBEK DOMINUS is simply this: for all the options available, you still feel like you lack control. Clans are often eliminated without any apparent action on your part. Even on the easier difficulty levels, the invaders swarm over your kingdom too quickly for any sensible holding action, leaving the most inelegant strategy as the most successful: wait for the massed invaders to get to your castle and then dump everything you've got on top of them. Too often you get the feeling that you're wasting your time with all the fancy doo-dads, when a crude bludgeoning approach would work better. Still, at its frenzied, confusing best, DOMINUS can indeed be thrilling; and it's a pleasure to see a game that takes chances with an innovative design. It's a shame that the few design problems make the game play exasperating as often as it is exciting. Perhaps with a revision or two this game could live up to its potential, but for now, masked mesomorph fans should approach this castle with caution. THE EDITORS SPEAK DOMINUS RATING ***** PROS A radically unique blend of gaming styles and features.

"HEX, BUGS & ROCK 'N ROLL interest in gaming.\" Fullager reflected that, if he had his education to do over again (he was a computer science major at the University of California at Santa Cruz), he would be a math major instead. \"Math remains pretty much constant, while computer science techniques can quickly become old news. Whenever I really get stuck on something, it's generally the math.\" Fullager also credits college with giving him the skills needed to read professional journals and research papers.

"UNDER THE HOOD Caddy Hack PARC Selecting The Right DOS Clubs For The Gaming Green by Mike Weksler  MAGINE STROLLING UP TO THE FAIRWAY AT PEBBLE BEACH AND TEEING OFF ON A 450-YARD HOLE WITH A SAND WEDGE. Even if you tee off like a gorilla on PCP, that Topflight isn't going to fly anywhere near the green. Of course, it doesn't matter how hard you swing because the problem isn't power, it's in your choice of driver. We have a similar situation in the world of PC games. You can have all the computing power in the world-a screaming Pentium and RAM coming out of your ears—but if your memory is not configured correctly for a specific game, you're not going anywhere. What makes matters worse is that no two games have the same memory configuration requirements—this one wants extended memory (EMS) and the other wants expanded (XMS)—and no two computer systems are exactly the same. So, just as the golfer has a selection of clubs for different situations, so the savvy computer gamer requires a selection of configuration files that will arrange his system memory to run different games. In this article, we won't concern ourselves with altering configurations for specific purposes; many columns (including many of my own) and entire books have been written on the subject. Instead, I'd like to address how you can organize multiple configurations for different games. We'll look at three solutions: the boot disk, configuration batch files, and the DOS 6.0 boot menu. But first, let's clarify terms. When I talk about \"memory configuration\" I'm talking about two files on your computer: the CONFIG.SYS and the AUTO-EXEC.BAT. These files contain instructions telling the computer how to organize your memory and which \"drivers\" to load. \"Drivers\" (also known as TSRs for Terminate and Stay Resident) are special programs that are loaded into your computer's memory and stay in memory in case they are needed. Drivers of ten serve as an interface between the peripherals in your system (mouse, sound card, CD-ROM) and the main part of the In the simplest of terms, memory probcomputer. Without the drivers, your Sound lems often arise because your sound card, Blaster Pro wouldn't know how to commuCD-ROM, and other peripheral drivers nicate with your processor and vice-versa. are eating up too much of the 640K of Unfortunately, with too many drivers, your lower memory in your machine.

MicroProse's simulation of the AH-64A Apache helicopter, though outshined graphically by such games as CoMANCHE MAXIMUM OVERKILL, remains the most accurate simulation of helicopter combat in gamingdom. The polygon-filled graphics moved quickly, even on the 8-bit Commodore 64, and the keyboard controls, aided by a keyboard overlay, offered enough realistic options to satisfy even the most demanding of sim bulls. GUNSHIP was the first to offer character continuity through a linked series of missions, even including R&R for fatigued pilots. Although it spawned a host of imitators, none of themeven GUNSHIP 2000—has managed to strike as fine a balance between realism and playability.

When Three-Sixty and crew brought the tabletop game to the computer, gamers found the digital version to be just as accurate, with a thorough and accessible database to boot. Bond's experience as a retired naval officer and NATO wargames referee was reflected in the quality of play, which was more intense and involving than anything this side of the Naval War College. HARPOON was proof that hard-core wargames could still sell in big numbers. And while HARPOON II has since arrived to carry the naval simulation flame, those who wish to experience the original can check out the excellent re-release of HARPOON CLASSIC by Alliance, which features new scenarios and a new interface along with all the bug fixes known to wargaming-kind.
