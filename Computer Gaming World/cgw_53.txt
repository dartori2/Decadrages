Review

Quixote, the paladin, watched in horror
as Wilson plummeted from the sky like a
boulder launched from a catapult. He had
known the swordsman since both men
had been squires in the service of other
knights. Now, the leather clad body of his
brother knight lay mangled and bleeding
in the branches of a large boled tree.
With words that tiptoed softly through
the air, Nichols whispered, "It was the
amulet. Amulets of Levitation oft exude
strange energy and consume their user."
"Wizards! Fools of the ethereal plane!"
thought Quixote. "They know everything
about everything, but they never tell you
until it's too late! Knowledge, thou art a
cruel taskmaster!"
Paladin is a game of small unit fantasy
combat with both versatility and playability.
Those who have played Breach,
Omnitrend's game of small unit combat
in a science fiction milieu, will be both
familiar and comfortable with the system.
Those who are looking for the typical fantasy role playing game will be disappointed
with this game. The scenarios can be
loosely tied together to make a campaign
game, but each scenario is primarily an excuse for pure, fast, and simple to resolve
"hack and slash."
Players begin by creating a paladin
character, a white knight with extra advantages who functions like the squad
leader in Breach. In fact, squad leaders
from Breach can be imported into Paladin.
The player selects a scenario from one of
the ten available on the game disk,
chooses from those available on the
"Quest Disk," or creates his own scenario
utilizing the "Quest Builder." Victory conditions for any quest utilize one or more of
the following tasks: 1) rescue prisoners or
obtain scrolls, 2) exit the combat zone,
and/or 3) kill a given percentage of
enemies. To add to the intensity of any
given quest and increase the difficulty, the
screen displays a "time clock" which counts

down thirty seconds of game time for every
movement phase used by the party.
The documentation is neither
voluminous nor pretentious, but the information is absolutely essential to players,
even as the paladin character discovered in
the fictional introduction to this review.
The fiction describes a situation which actually occurred when the game was being
played prior to this review. The party of
heroes happened across several of the
amulets during a raid on a magic shop.
Since they needed to make better time in
order to rescue a friend held hostage by
some evil trolls, the party elected to use
the amulets to fly over the forested terrain.
The command interface in Paladin made
it easy to start using the artifact without
bothering to read the manual. Of course,
the manual warns players that there is a
10% chance of crashing at the end of any
turn whenever an "Amulet of Levitation" is
used. This is an important "object lesson"
to teach those who want to be successful
at Paladin not to be seduced by the
remarkably simple interface and to pay
close attention to the manual.

On A Clear Day,
Icon Play Forever
Once the scenario actually begins, the
monitor display is divided into sections
which show character information, a tactical map with animated characters, and a
set of command icons which can be accessed by the mouse interface. One icon
drops an object, another picks up objects,
and a third uses the object. Both common
objects and arcane artifacts may be accessed using this interface. If the action is
impossible or inappropriate, an error message is displayed in a pop-up window.
Ranged combat using the crossbow or
orbs of fire (conjured hand grenades) is
handled by clicking on the "Use Object"
command icon, as well. A separate combat
icon pictures the outline of a sword and is

used to literally swing the character's sword
at an enemy/monster or, with the Shift key
depressed, to cast a spell (Spells such as
"Fireball" and "Mind Stun" supplement the
party's ranged weapon selection). If the
character lacks movement points or ability
to perform the action or cast the spell, an
appropriate error message appears in a
window and explains how the problem can
be corrected or why it cannot be done.
Even climbing stairs and opening doors
can be accomplished with a simple "point
and click" on the appropriate images.

A Cardinal of a Gremlin
In the course of play, animated characters appear one by one upon the screen in
a spot called an "entrance pentagram."
After this, the player may cycle through his
party at will until each character has used
all of the movement points allotted and
finished the movement phase. Combat occurs during the movement phase and
costs movement points, as well. Herein lies
a significant weakness to the game. All
movement and combat must occur in one
of the four cardinal directions. In movement, characters may only make ninety degree turns. Forty-five degree turns are not
permitted, so one can only travel a
diagonal path in a circumlocuted manner.
This is simply inconvenient in movement
and the designers may argue that they
provided enough movement points to take
this into consideration, but this is a tremendous hassle during combat, especially
ranged combat.
The inability to take ranged shots from a
diagonal means that the party must actually flank an individual opponent or monster
on both flanks in order to allow more than
one member of the party to get in a shot.
One could argue that attacks from the
diagonal are relatively impractical when
every attacker is swinging a sword, axe, or
war hammer at close range, but there
seems no logical reason for this limitation.
Instead, it seems that ease of programming has dictated this decision rather than
design philosophy.
Admittedly, these design limitations existed in Breach, but one would have
hoped for an advance in a product built off
the same system. Also, players should note
that the limitations work both ways; the
monsters/enemies cannot move or fire on
diagonals, either. Therefore, this criticism is
directed more toward a lack of realism in
the model rather than a serious quibble
with playability.
A more serious problem with the game
system has to do with combat. Since both
combat and movement are governed by

the expenditure of movement points, a
curious anomaly can regularly occur. If the
player can deploy his party in such a way
that a hero contacts the enemy with a lot
of movement points to spare, it is very possible for the hero to actually strike multiple
blows at the opponent and even annihilate
the enemy before a single retaliatory slash
or thrust can be directed at the hero.
There are certainly many games, particularly combat simulations, where phased
movement allows combat to take place
and be resolved prior to the enemy's movement/combat phase. Usually, however, the
model assumes simultaneous fire and
counts damage in both phases against
both opponents. In Breach and Paladin,
no such model is used.

Lifestyles of the
Rich and Dangerous
In spite of any limitations within the
game system, there are plenty of reasons
for gamers to like both of these games.
Both games offer an opportunity to play
simple, yet challenging, tactical scenarios
that last roughly an hour to an
hour-and-a-half as opposed to the lengthy scenarios offered in some other systems. In addition,
the ability to use the same squad leader or
Paladin in published or personalized
scenarios adds continuity, as well as
replayability to the game. Even though this
reviewer wishes that the squad leader or
Paladin files were not immediately erased
when the character dies, this does offer a
realistic approach to role playing. Further,
the "point and click" interface, bright
colors, digitized sounds, and cute character
graphics make the game both easy and interesting to play.
Another enjoyable aspect to this game is
the capacity for exploration without a lot of
heavy-duty puzzles or a long-term commitment to following an intricate plotline. The
fact that some scenarios can be replayed
(or modified) insures that gamers will get
as much "bang for buck" in this product as
in adventures that require a greater time
commitment.
In short, those who liked the "feel" of play
in Breach, but prefer a fantasy environment shouldn't miss Paladin. In addition,
those who like the tactical combat and exploration of a role-playing game, but want
the satisfaction of being able to complete
a quest in one sitting will be pleased with
Paladin. Finally, those who want to bring
the scenes of their favorite fantasy novels
to life in a computer game will find
Paladin an ideal product for this purpose.
This system is clean and cleverly designed
with much to commend it.

Game Hints

Warning: Although "The Scorpion's
Tale" is a warm and comfortable
tavern of the mind with a nice cozy
fire of vibrant images, our resident
storyteller conjures up illuminating
hints about games. If the gentle
reader eschews hints, let him beware!
Ah, here we are, in November (my
favorite month!) again.
Christmas is just around
the corner, and it's time to
start thinking about gift
lists, especially computer
game lists (No, don't ask
me about Fred's; you really
don't want to know). What
better way to spend those
cold winter nights than
cozied up to a hot adventure game? Of course,
some games are better
than others.

spells, drinking potions, regulating game
speed, and turning the sound on or off (I
recommend Off).

Middle Ground
Travelling to a location in the First
Dimension is quite simple (thanks to the
teleport spell). A map comes up with the

As Told by Scorpia

Just about everything in the game is
menu-driven and is very simple. At the
start, the main menu provides options for
saving and restoring a game, travelling to
a territory in the first dimension (or to the
second and third dimensions), checking
inventory and character stats, creating

Unfriendlies, the sort
you're likely to encounter
most of the time, are not
open to reason. These
offer the options of fighting
or fleeing. Sometimes, you
will get the "Attack, Flee,
Reason" choices as soon
as you meet them, thus
giving you the opportunity
to get away fast.

However, a lot of the
time, you won't see that.
Much of the time, the creature will attack first. Also, on many occasions, the monster you're fighting may
get several attacks on you before it's your
turn. Unlike most games of this type, combat is not a straight-forward back and
forth matter. You may get to attack once
or twice, then the monster may get
several shots at you, and so on.
Temeres starts the game with 100 hitpoints, and that never changes. He can
regenerate slowly between rounds, but a
powerful opponent with multiple attacks
can put him out pretty quickly. So it's important to keep an eye on hit points
during combat in order to retreat if things
are not going too well.

Primary Point

There are three segments to the game.
In the first, appropriately called the First
Dimension, Temeres searches for a
variety of spells and objects to increase
his power. In the second (creatively
referred to as the Second Dimension), he
must make his way through a series of
seven mazes, defeating a powerful wizard
in each one. In the last (named, to no
surprise) the Third Dimension, Temeres
has his showdown with Aldorin.

With friendly types, you always get the
choice of Attacking, Fleeing, or Reasoning (essentially, that's talking to them).
Wise players will always talk to friendlies
because they either tell you information or
give you something.

WIZARD

Wizard Wars (Paragon Software), on
the IBM, is a sort of quasi role-playing
game. You take on the part of Temeres, a
young wizard seeking the means of overcoming Aldorin, a mad and evil mage
who is wreaking havoc on the world. Aldorin has upset the balance between
good and evil, unleashed all sorts of unpleasant monsters, and, in general, made
a real nuisance of himself.

Temeres, however, doesn't start off in
too good a position. After losing a previous encounter with Aldorin, he was
stripped of all his magical spells, leaving
him rather powerless. Fortunately,
Temeres comes across a dying wizard
who gives him two spells: one of teleporta.
lion and one of lightning bolts. Now that
he has something to work with, Temeres
can search the world for the spells and ob
jects that will make him powerful enough
to confront Aldorin once more. That, of
course, is where the game begins.

What happens after that depends on
whether or not the inhabitant is friendly.

30 territories displayed, each numbered.
You simply enter the number of the territory you wish to explore. A scroll is displayed on the screen, giving the territory
name, plus some details about it, and
then asks if you want to go there or not.
Once inside a territory, you explore it
through another menu. This menu gives
you the options of searching for items or
inhabitants, using or storing an item in
your inventory, or returning to the travel
map. There is no actual moving around
here. You don't manipulate any icons
across the screen. When you search for inhabitants, you see an outdoor scene with
a castle in the middle. Then, a banner
comes up on the left-hand side of the
screen, showing Temeres peering into a
crystal ball. When he finds someone, a
second banner appears on the right-hand
side, showing who he's encountered.

There is no experience to be earned in
the game for killing monsters. Further,
Temeres does not advance in level.
Rather, his spell casting energy increases
over time as he defeats monsters and his
wisdom increases as he finds important
items. Eventually, both wisdom and spellcasting energy will reach 500, as high as
you can get. A high wisdom score is important, as there are some items or
friendlies you will not be able to find until
wisdom has reached a certain point.
The most important things to find are
the components for the special spells
listed in Morgaine's Handbook and scrolls
with spells. The spells in the handbook
are only for specific circumstances in the
game, while the scroll spells can be used
at any time without special preparation.
In addition, there are a number of miscellaneous magic items, including potions, gemstones, and other objects that
can be useful or harmful (you have to experiment to determine which) in your
quest. Finally, there are some strange
items you will find that seem to be spell
(Continued on page 12)

WIZARD
WARS
(Continued from page 10)

components, but which have no use in
the game and cannot be used to make
spells.
All this searching in the First Dimension
eventually becomes drudgery. At first, you
tend to find a lot of items, but eventually
you are down to locating only a few
remaining ones. Since you don't really
know where any of the items are in the
territories, you must go through these
places several times over, hoping something will come up. This takes a great
deal of time.
The one item you won't find is the
Sword of Mazeus. Before you can obtain
this very important spell component, you
must go through the mazes of the
Second Dimension. These mazes are fairly simple to get through. You simply need
to map accurately. There are no tricks,
traps, secret doors or passageways in any
of the mazes, nor any puzzles to solve. It's

simply a matter of going through the
hallways until you find the resident wizard
and manage to defeat him or her in battle. Or course, there will be monsters
along the way that you will have to fight.
The one difference here is that everyone
you meet will definitely be unfriendly and
they always get in the first attack.
The first couple of mazes are not too difficult. As you progress, though, your opponent wizards become more powerful.
For this reason, I recommend not attempting the mazes until you have the Light
Shield spell. Once cast (only in combat),
the shield remains up until it has absorbed its quota of damage, after which it
fades away and has to be replaced.
The wizards in the mazes (as well as Aldorin) have light shields of their own.
Also, they will not take you on immediately. Instead, they summon in monsters
(one at a time) to fight for them prior to

the showdown. Eventually, you get to
fight the wizards and then it becomes a
question of which side can wear the other
down first. Fortunately, they never use
more than one light shield, while you can
cast as many as you need (one at a time,
of course) as long as your spell energy
permits.
You can leave a maze at any time by hitting the escape key or fleeing in combat.
This brings you back to the main menu.
However, if you haven't finished a maze
before exiting, you must start at the beginning of the maze again. Therefore it's
best to do each maze in one sitting,
saving the game in between.
The first maze has one level, the rest
have two or three, which means a bit of
going up and down here and there until
you reach the wizard. Still, this is pretty
straightforward, except perhaps for the
seventh maze, which has many up and
down portals. Even so, persistence and
good mapping will see you through.
Overall, the mazes haven't much to
recommend them. The one good point to
them is that, having finished one maze,
you never have to go back to it again.
For example, after completing the first
maze, you will automatically be placed in
the second one the next time you go to
the Second Dimension, and so on (by the
way, you don't get anything special for

defeating any of the wizards, except the
last one).

dorin will be the single most difficult part
of the game.

When the Second Dimension has been
completed, you will learn where the Sword
of Mazeus can be found, which happens
to be a thirty-first territory that now appears on your map for the first time. The
Sword is guarded by a dragon, which you
will have to kill first. Then, you can search
for items and obtain the Sword (this is the
only thing to be found here).

Aldorin is a tough customer, make no
mistake about it. This combat will not be
over in a round or two. First, he will summon in, one at a time, a total of seven
monsters to fight for him. Most, if not all,
will be of the nastier variety.

You may now complete the final spell
from Morgaine's handbook and this will,
in turn, open the way to the Third Dimension. When you first go there, you will
face three dragons, one at a time. You
have the option of fighting them or
answering their riddles. If you answer the
riddles, they will leave in peace and allow
you access to Aldorin. Since these riddles
are, to say the least, incredibly easy (the
last two being hardly riddles at all), I highly
recommend you take the "answer riddle"
option.

Final Conflict
When the last dragon has left, you are
presented with the choice of fighting Aldorin, or going back to the First Dimension. Going back is a good idea, so you
can save the game at this point, as well
as check on your stats. The fight with Al-

Having gone through those, you face
the big A himself. He has 250 hit points
and a lot of mean spells. As with the
wizards in the mazes, it comes down to
who can wear out who first. For some
reason, which I was never able to determine, spells cast at Aldorin were always
weaker than when they were cast at a
regular monster (even when I was
equipped with the item that was supposed
to make my spells more powerful). This
means it will take a lot of spells to kill
him. In the meantime, he is casting spells
at you. Even worse, his spells are usually
more powerful than yours and he gets
more attacks than you do. Expect to
renew your light shield more than once in
this encounter, if you live long enough to
do that.
When the combat is over, Temeres is
proclaimed the new master wizard of the
realm, at which point the game ends and
you have to hit the escape key to exit the
program.

Final Wisdom
The EGA graphics in Wizard Wars are
quite well done, being very detailed and
very colorful. They are the best part of the
game. However, with no puzzles to solve,
no mysteries to unravel, no problems to
overcome, and no real challenges to face
(except possibly the battle with Aldorin),
Wizard Wars is best suited to those who
want to do hack and slash and not worry
about intellectual puzzles.
Well, I see by the old invisible clock on
the wall, it's about that time again.

In separate transactions, the
comic book publisher has
agreed to allow Paragon
Software, as well as
Mastertronic

The graphics arts at the company are reported to be very
enthused over the work that
they are doing, particularly
on the popular Nova figure

Software
Toolworks
Acquires
Intellicreations
In two major corporate actions during September of
1988, The Software Toolworks enhanced its public
image. The company purchased 100% of the holdings
of Intellicreations' coowners Samuel Poole and
Ted Hofmann, making Intellicreations (publishers of
Datasoft products) the

entertainment division of
The Software Toolworks,
and consolidated its stock in
a 1-for-150 consolidation
that took the company off
the "penny stock" market
and onto the "over-thecounter" market. The company has received NASDAQ
status and is currently trading under the symbol,
TWRX.V (with the .V to be
phased out). The new acquisition, together with the
company's previous acquisition of Priority Software
makes The Software Toolworks a three division company: one for creativity and
productivity, one for entertainment, and one for
production. The production
division (Priority Software)
duplicates nearly 50,000
disks per day for both
Software Toolworks and
Intellicreations, as well as
companies like AshtonTate. The company plans to
house all three divisions in a
22,000 square foot facility in
Chatsworth (current home of
Intellicreations).
Les Crane will remain President and Chief Executive Officer of the company, while
Ted Hofmann and Samuel
Poole will assume vicepresidencies at the parent
company. Hofmann will assume administrative duties
for all three divisions, while
Poole will handle creative acquisitions for the entertainment division. The new corporation will boast a crew of
20 in-house programmers
and has a current estimated
valuation of $38 million dollars.

Longing for
Shandola
Interstel's "First Expedition"
by Dennis Owens
Day 76
Nine days since we last saw a shipâ€”ammo, fuel, and supplies running low. No food' Haven't eaten in such a long
time, my first mate is starting to resemble a chicken leg. I
caught him staring hungrily at me yesterday.
That island must be in these waters. The charts, the natives'
superstitions, even our own legends indicate that it must be
here. Somewhere.
Time is running out. Long past the point of turning back,
we circle and backtrack endlessly. Even, I fear, if we should
find the sun sphere, we will not have the fuel or the food to
make it back to Shandola.
We will search one last day: tomorrow. It is one thing for
us to die; quite another for the planet to be doomed.
Interstel's First Expedition is a simulation of a seagoing
simulation. Neither as complicated nor as breathlessly
exhilarating as actually sailing a vessel, it is, nonetheless, an accurate depiction of what goes on at sea. Unfortunately, short
of taking a few potshots at sea beasts for food, squinting at
ships on the horizon to tell if they are pirates or not, and
wandering around a very tiny bit on a few islands, virtually
nothing happens for long stretches of time in this game.
The object of the quest is to recover three sun spheres
which have been stolen from their repository in the holy
shrine on the island of Shandola. Without these spheres in
their proper place, the planet Yorland will be defenseless
against the destructive rays which the comet Halistrom due
back in 100 daysâ€”emits.
To succeed in the quest, player characters are provided with
a ship, first mate, compass, star chart, map, and some
money to buy food, fuel, and other necessities. Basically,
then, First Expedition becomes a process of motoring back
and forth across the world represented on the map; attempting to pick up messages; trying to find the sun spheres; and,
occasionally, stopping to refuel or replenish the ship's supply
of food/ammo/rockets.

Bad Tidings
Part simulator and part quest game, First Expedition is not
a role-playing game. The only attributes that can be increased are those of the ship (see chart). Neither is it the excit
ing science-fiction adventure that the game's designer,
Steven Englestad, seemed to have had in mind. What it isâ€”
besides trying mightily to be an educational gameâ€”is relatively slow-moving. Days on end of being surrounded by water
may sound romantic, but much of this game is less stimulating than sitting and watching barnacles grow.
Perhaps the biggest problem with the game (and I quote
from the manual) is that it "was designed so that some terrible event will not 'kill' you suddenly and unexpectedly." The

result, though, is that
it is virtually impossible to die. The only
undesirable ways for
the game to end is to
go without food for
two days or not find
the sun spheres in
time. Since sea beasts
are so plentiful (and it
only takes one wellaimed shot to obtain a
three-days' supply of
fresh meat), once you
get used to the ship's
cannon's ballistic system, you will almost
never need to go
hungry again.
Players also rarely
have to do without
money. Simply defending one's ship successfully against piratesâ€”
who do nothing more
than board the ship
and take a third of its
suppliesâ€”garners more money and nothing in this game is very expensive.

Fuel, depending on the distance you
need to travel, can sometimes last for
three or four trips between islands
(longer as the boat class goes up). Rockets (which provide an aerial view of the ship's surroundings),
ammo, fuel, food, and doctor's assistance, can be purchased
at any island which has a pier.

So, while it is thoughtful that Interstel wanted to make this
a game which was easy to begin (who can ever forget the
horrors of trying to get started in the original Might and
Magic?), what gameplayers really want is to have a game
start slowly, let them get comfortable with the system, and
then, let the weirdness start. We do not want the games to
be inanely simple.
Options allow players to set the speed of the game, the skill
level needed to fire the cannon accurately, toggle the sound
on/off, and use autoplot for navigation. Even playing the
game at as fast a speed setting as possible, left far too much
of the time for staring at the screen and waiting for something to happen.
First Expedition has some interesting premiums, however.
The compass, map, and star chart are nice cardboard
enclosures, but they end up becoming cumbersome to use
and ultimately detract from, rather than enhance, game play.
All their features could have been included in the program itself.
Autoplot was a tremendous assistance because, even
though the manual suggests the use of triangulation (and
provides several pages of the documentation to explain the
process), the procedure simply takes too long. First, the
player looks at the night sky and chooses a star; then, he examines the star chart carefully enough to locate the star he
saw in the sky; this is followed by looking up the star's abbreviation in the star catalogue; and finally, . . . you get the
idea. All of that is done and the player still hasn't even gotten

Origin Plots
New Corporate
Strategy
Signifying a new positioning among software
publishers, Origin Systems, Inc. has changed
both the corporate and
product brand name to
Origin. Robert Garriott, president of Origin, recently outlined the company's new
strategy by stating, "For the
past six years, Origin has
generally been known as a
one-or-two product-a-year
company, with the Ultima
series clearly being our
hallmark accomplishment."
The executive, co-founder of
the software company with
his more famous sibling
(Richard "Lord British" Garriott), went on to state that
the company has been involved in intensive internal
product development for the
last two and a half years and
the time has arrived when
the company can project
more than a dozen new
releases over the next two
years. "We're sitting on a
goldmine of diversified new
entertainment software titles,

and we've developed some
pretty bold strategies and
business plans to bring
them to market." The softspoken president envisions
more than a series of fantasy
role playing games and expects that: "The next two
years will see the introduction of altogether new
categories of computer entertainment from Origin." [Ed.:

these opponents is Jack himself. Nicklaus claims that he

Review

Introduction
Red Storm Rising was sneak previewed last month, but with less
than two weeks to play with the system, this reviewer was able to
give only a brief overview of the product. This article will delve further, concentrating upon successful (and not so successful)
tactics.
The game itself is a simulation
of modern submarine warfare. In
fact, the title might be more accurately given as Red Storm
Rising: Part I. Currently, MicroProse has no concrete plans for
additional simulations (air, land,
CVBG [carrier battle group]), but
who knows what the future
holds. The simulation is in line
with Microprose's product
philosophyâ€”professionally produced, historically accurate and vastly entertaining.

without offensive weaponry and are easy prey once the escorts
have been dispatched. In fact, they are so easy to destroy that this
reviewer recommends closing and finishing them with torpedoes.

HELICOPTERS: A helicopter is the most deadly foe. Generally,
one will not even realise that a helo is in the attack until it is too
late. However, if most of the escorts have been sunk, and missile
torpedoes are still falling like an
ungentle rain, this probably
means an enemy helicopter. To
verify this, adjust depth to a maximum of 55' and use radar. The
best defense is not evasion. It is
use of a Stinger missile. Although the documentation notes
a maximum range of 6,000
By M. Evan Brooks
yards, kills may actually be
achieved at ranges up to 11,000
yards. When exposing the sail
(the conning tower), be prepared to
evade numerous torpedoes while getting
ready for the Stinger shot; the closer the
helicopter is, the more the chance of success.

Diving Into Red
Storm Rising

Game Play
Basic appearance and game play was
covered in the prior article, so this review
will concentrate on survival in the icy
waters of the North Atlantic. There are
certain paths to success and even more
routes to the Deep Six. However, Red
Storm Rising is relatively easy to learn
and win. This reviewer does not mean
that the challenge is absent, but while
the challenge is omnipresent, it is surmountable.
When players first view the documentation, they will fear the worst. However,
most of the documentation is composed
of historical data, while the actual game
play becomes intuitive after 2-3 scenarios.

Tactical Guidelines for Offense
Unlike Silent Service, Red Storm
Rising offers quick and easy access to
the enemy. While World War II submarines often spent long periods looking
for the enemy, Red Storm Rising
lates that modern sensor mechanisms (e.g. aircraft reconnaissance, satellites, etc.) will generally pinpoint enemy locations. Getting there was never really half of the fun, and in Red Storm
Rising, contact is usually quick. Even when immediate contact is
not achieved, be aware that some enemy vessel is within your
sphere of operations and for every enemy vessel, there is an adequate offense.
SURFACE VESSELS: Generally, these are the easiest kills. When
possible, achieve early contact, use missiles (Tomahawks or Harpoons) and sweep the seas. To utilize missiles, the submarine
must be at a depth of 300' or less. Speed, however, is not a factor, so one's vessel may be travelling at maximum speed while
firing at the enemy. Usually, enemy warships are protecting something, so firing several missiles in a warship's general direction
may often sink a rearward transport. While one missile hit is often
sufficient for a kill, a carrier (Kremlin class) may require as many
as 4-5 missile hits. Also, be aware that both Harpoons and
Tomahawks may be destroyed by defensive missiles and gunfire
systems. Usually, a 75% hit rate will be achieved. This is somewhat higher than that in Strike Fleet (Electronic Arts), but since
actual combat experience is, thankfully, non-existent, it is hard to
tell which is correct. Transports, supply ships and base ships are

ENEMY SUBMARINES: Enemy nuclear
submarines pose no serious threat. Since
they are louder than their Western
counterparts, they are easily located.
Enemy diesel boats are virtually silent,
however. When opposing submarines, be
ready for the enemy to materialize quickly. In fact, to optimize one's chance
against a submarine force, when the tactical screen appears, quickly zoom in.
While surface forces are often detected at
maximum ranges, enemy submarines are
usually detected at a zoom factor of 4.
Thus, zoom in, make contact, and be
ready to loose a quick torpedo at the
nearest enemy boat. Enemy boats located a distance away may be harassed
by use of Sea Lance missiles. Their
evasionary maneuvers may buy sufficient
time to be able dispose of the near
enemy and turn to those located further
away at one's convenience.
COMBINED FORCES: These are tricky, but they can be
defeated. With torpedoes roaming and missiles flying, one may
not have time to sufficiently identify an enemy submarine as an escort. However, if Harpoons and Tomahawks keep overflying the
target, it is most likely a submarine escort and should be
destroyed by torpedo.

Tactical Guidelines for Defense
It can be said that there are old submarine officers and bold submarine officers, but not old bold submarine officers. Defensive
maneuvering is essential to survival. The Defense Display zooms
to a 3 factor, so one can drop noisemakers, decoys and literally
dance around the incoming torpedoes. However, this takes time
and concentration which denies one the chance to take the battle
to the enemy. While high speed evasive maneuvers may throw off
the enemy torpedoes, they also easily sever the wires to one's
own torpedoes. Since wire guided torpedoes may be driven into
enemy vessels by joystick (and must be carefully monitored to insure that enemy jamming does not deter them from striking the
target), a maximum speed of circa 15 knots is necessary to assure control of the wire.

Therefore, although it looks dangerous and feels even worse,
maintain the tactical display and avoid enemy torpedoes by dropping noisemakers only when they have homed in. Hopefully, they
can be decoyed at a range between 1,000-2,000 yards, because
they have an uncomfortable tendency to reacquire one's boat
when they pass closer. If this occurs within 500 yards, it is usually
fatal (within 300 yards, it is always deadly).
Do not get too close to the enemy surface vessels. RBU (enemy
rocket attacks) are short-ranged, but deadly when repeated.

that 83% of Soviet submarines will be "quiet." Since the Soviet
submarine fleet (3 times as large as the American fleet) is the
strategic offensive arm of the Soviet Navy, as well as the primary
anti-submarine weapon (see Soviet Military Power: An Assessment of the Threat 1988), it is apparent why Navy planners are
concerned.

Assessment of Game Play and Historicity

The Maritime Strategy envisions a forward defense as a keystone. In fighting a war, the U.S. Navy must "seize the initiative and
carry the fight to the enemy." The objectives involved in succeeding at this goal include denying the Soviets their kind of war and
the destruction of the Soviet Navy, as well as influencing the land
battle (cf. Maritime Strategy, US Naval Institute, January 1986).
The submarine is the vanguard of the offense. Its mission carries
out these functions and it protects the SLOC (Sea Lanes of Communication) in order to allow US Reserve Forces to make their
presence felt in the land battle.

Certain aspects of Red Storm Rising have been adjusted for
playability. There is nothing wrong with this, as long as the user
understands what has been adjusted and realizes the impact upon
the simulation. In the game, a total of four offensive weapons
may be in play at any one time. This is independent of whether
the weapons are torpedoes (and being wire-guided) or missiles
(which are fire-and-forget). Larry Bond (former Naval officer,
recent NATO war games referee, and current expert on Naval warfare) asserts that, currently, a submarine can probably handle only
two wire-guided torpedoes at any one time. However, the new
weapons computer on the Seawolf could possibly alter the situation. The problem is that this is intruding on sensitive ground, so
there is no definitive answer. There is certainly no question that
the submarine could expend all its missile load quickly.

The game's 1996 scenario offers the Seawolf, the $1-billion
prototype whose keel is currently being laid. With an offensive
weapons inventory virtually doubling current submarines, this is a
vessel that will rarely have to return to port for armaments.
However, some observers see the Seawolf as an interesting vessel, but the wrong boat for the times (see Newsweek, September
12, 1988). The Walker Spy Family's deleterious effect upon submarine security will probably never be fully told, but currently, only
13% of Soviet subs run "quiet;" by the year 2000, it is estimated

Microprose has responded that this limitation is due to design
parameters on the C-64/128 (any more than 8 weapons on the
display [4 incoming and 4 outgoing] tend to lose resolution).
Also, contemporary Naval Doctrine (which holds that with the
shortage of Tomahawks and Harpoons, definite target acquisition
would be required before expenditure) would support the game
design. This reviewer discussed the matter with a Navy captain, a
former commander of the USS Los Angeles. His response to the
official doctrine was, "Sure,â€”in a peacetime mode; in wartime, if I

Reflections Upon Doctrine

saw a CVBG [carrier battle group], I'd expend every bit of
ordnance I could and then, get the hell out of the area!"
In the World War III scenarios, an American submarine can take
up to 3 torpedo hits, and even when the submarine is sunk, the
player is generally rescued. This was obviously done for playability.
Navy personnel have stated that since most of the submarines are
not double-hulled, there is little chance of their surviving a single
hit and any chance of rescue is miniscule at best. In fact, this was
their most vocal criticismâ€”they are proud of their calling, and
regard it as much more dangerous in a wartime situation than the
game depicts. Recognize this and empathize with them, but overall, the effect on the simulation is negligible.

Miscellaneous Notes
There are anywhere from 8-16 endings. Last month, this
reviewer noted that abject failure resulted in Gulag imprisonment.
In addition, a limited defeat leaves one beached and forgotten like
the "Vietnam vets;" a successful resolution may result in one's
eventual promotion to Navy Captain; and a reputation as the
"Number 1 sub skipper" will yield a tickertape parade, promotion
to Rear Admiral, and the press offering "millions for your
memoirs." While this last ending may well be true, this reviewer
thought it a shade cynical. If patriotism is the last refuge of a
scoundrel (Samuel Johnson, 1775), it can also stand for putting
country ahead of self (Adlai Stevenson, 1952).

Save and Replay (All's Fair Dept.)
Scenarios may be saved and, in the World War III scenario, one
may "cheat" appropriately. Save the game, do a scenario, and
then decide whether or not to continue. Not like the result? Play

the scenario again until a more successful kill ratio is achieved.
Plus, the second time around, the player is cognizant of the total
enemy force structure, can make quick identification and react accordingly. A total of four scenarios may be saved per separate
disk; this may be formatted without leaving the game, and when
the disk is full, one can delete a prior save (this feature is not explicitly mentioned in the documentation).
After a scenario is completed, a replay feature is offered.
However, it will not replay the entire scenario -- instead, just the
last few minutes. Be aware of its limitations.

Important Strategic Consideration
In the strategic movement phase (World War III scenario), movement with the joystick button depressed is at 30 knots, with joystick alone, 15 knots and with joystick centered, a drift at 4 knots.
While this is mentioned in the documentation, it took this
reviewer several scenarios plus an explicit explanation from Larry
Bond to realize that when contact is made with the enemy, one's
speed will reflect that of the joystick. When one suddenly realizes
that his speed is 30 knots at 200' in shallow water and making
severe noise, it is too late. Thus, insure that speed is a more
reasonable 12-15 knots when contact is imminent.

Conclusions
As may be seen from the tenor of this article, Red Storm Rising
is highly recommended. Truthfully, this reviewer did not expect a
simulation as entertaining and apparently accurate as this was.
Available from Microprose Software on the C-64/128 for
$44.95, Red Storm Rising will be out on the IBM in January 1989.

Miss Me, Kate!
Battlehawks 1942 is a WWII Pacific naval air combat simulator
The game allows you to train and fight in both American and
Japanese planes for missions at the four pivotal naval air battles

The outstanding hi-res graphics and animation give you a
detailed 3-D view of realistically rendered aircraft and ship images
(no polygon fills here). As with any good flight/combat simulator it
is difficult to describe in words or with still photos the realistic feel
and excitement the game produces. It is outstanding.

Not only is Battlehawks 1942 an outstanding flight simulator, it
is an accurate portrayal of WWII air combat. It should be, Lucasfilm retained the services of WWII pilots from both sides, including Dick Best (see our interview), to assist in making the game
act and feel as real as possible.
The documentation is nearly a reference work on WWII naval air
combat. Over 100 pages long, it covers not only the rules of the
game, but sections on the history of the four battles, flight fundamentals, aerial tactics and tips; details on the aircraft and ships;
and designer's notes.

Pushing The Envelope
As good as the animation is, as realistic as the game is, and as
detailed as the documentation is; it all takes a secondary role to
the incredible new element this game adds to the art of simulation design. They call it an "instant replay" feature. I call it a Mach1 Camera Plane.
Most of us have played around with the chase plane view in
such games as Flight Simulator II, Microsoft Flight Simulator,
Sublogic's Jet, and the like. Further, we have used the replay feature to observe our maneuvers. Well, hold on to your seat. The
boys and Lucasfilm have accelerated that idea into hyperspace!
Now, when you begin an attack you can turn on the camera. It
makes a recording of the world around you. All the planes, ships,
bombs, bullets, etc. All of it is recorded. You can fly for what
seems like several minutes before the "film" is used up. When you
want to replay your film, hit the replay button and you receive a
first person perspective from the camera plane. The camera
plane, however, can fly anywhere in the world that has just been
recorded (and at much higher speeds than the planes in the
game). Turn on the camera at the beginning of that dive bomb
run and you will be able to replay the tape after the run. Start the
replay and fly your camera plane to a nice vantage point to watch
your attack. Or, if you prefer, you (in your camera plane) can follow yourself (in your dive bomber) down as the attack takes place
and see events, to borrow a phrase: "up close and personal".
This feature comes close to simulating the making of a movie of
your maneuvers (leave it to Lucasfilm!). Actually, it is even better
than a movie, since you can rerun the tape again and fly to yet
another vantage point.
This camera plane feature is the biggest advance in flight simulations we have seen in a long time. Look for future products to include similar features. [Ed. Note: Microprose's F-19 has a couple
of new features called "TrakCam" and "TactiVue" which give outside the cockpit views of you and your opponents. We did not
have any hands on experience with F-19 before we went to press,
but . . . stay tuned]

Debriefing
The staff of CGW recently made a "fact finding tour" to the Bay
Area. Of all the products they previewed (and they saw a lot of out
standing product) Battlehawks 1942 stood out as the most exciting. Battlehawks 1942 will almost certainly be a contender for
next year's CGW Action Game of the Year honors.
This game is a must for both the serious simulation gamer and
the action gamer as well.

A WWII Pilot Talks About Midway
and Battlehawks 1942
Dick Best was the commanding officer of the Enterprise's Bombing
Squadron 6 during the battle of Midway. Lucasfilm is using his expertise and advice to help make Battlehawks 1942 a more realistic
simulation. We interviewed Mr. Best and Lucasfilm's Noah Falstein
while they were working on the game at Lucasfilm's Skywalker Ranch.
COW: Dick, are you assisting with game design for all three types of
air combat (fighter, dive bomber, torpedo)?
Best: I'm helping with all three. I was involved with dive bombers for
the first six months of the war. Prior to the war I was a fighter pilot.
From 1938-1940 I was an instructor at Pensacola. As part of my job at
Pensacola I learned and subsequently taught torpedo bombing. So,
aside from being opinionated anyway, I have some ideas on all of them.
COW: We understand that you scored the first hit against a carrier at
Midway. Could you tell us about that?
Best: As the commanding officer I led my squadron of SBDs in an attack on the Japanese carrier Akagi. True, I did make the first hit. My
getaway after my dive was at such an angle that I could look back and
see the first three bombs hit. My bomb struck just forward of the superstructure about amidships. My number two man's bomb hit right in the
middle of the fighters that were spotted on the fantail and were preparing to take off. One of the fighters had run through my bomb sight as
I turned it on. Number three hit among the planes. I saw those first
three hit, put down my nose, and got out.
COW: The history books tell us that the first attack wave that morning was by torpedo bombers. No hits were scored and most of the
bombers were shot down. However when the dive bombers arrived for
their high level attacks all the enemy fighters were still at low altitude
because of the torpedo attacks. Thus the dive bombers had a easier
go of it on their attack runs. Is that accurate?
Best: That is entirely accurate. However it was a mistake. We were
supposed to attack simultaneously. The torpedo bombers went in at
about 4000 feet. For some reason they seemed to have better information or navigation and consequently arrived maybe as much as 20
minutes before the dive bombers. We were up at 20,000 feet. We
missed to the south. We cast about and finally picked up a destroyer
wake and followed that for the course line and found the carriers. So
we came in after the first two torpedo squadrons.
Because of all the damage done at the Coral Sea engagement by torpedo planes, the Japanese were down on the deck waiting for the torpedo planes to come in. The combination of the torpedoes getting

hundred years have passed since the Shard of

As is pretty obvious, this
game is the sequel to

it is a greatly expanded effort with a much larger
world, a raft of new character classes, a plethora of
new skills, and several new
features, as well as many
familiar old ones.

After this, pick the character's two starting skills (more on
that later), give him/her a name, and save the profile to disk
Your party is limited to a maximum of five (five is definitely
recommended), and you can't have extra characters on the
disk. Thus, once your party is full, you must delete an old
character to create a new one.
The only problem with creating new characters is the fact
that the program will automatically save it, whether you want
it to or not. For instance, if the final re-roll produces
miserable stats, you certainly wouldn't want that character in
the party. The only thing you can do is delete it from the disk
and try again. This becomes annoying and time-consuming
It would have been far better if the program asked you at the
end whether or not you wanted the character written; this
would save both time and wear on the disk drive.
Before creating any characters, however, spend some time
with the manual, reading up on the classes and skill system.
Now, unlike Shard, any character can learn any skill. The
trade-off is the cost in intellect points needed to learn the skill.

For example, it is easier for a wizard to learn, say, "Fire
Runes" (5 points) than it is for a Barbarian (10 points). In the
same vein, a Barbarian only needs 1 point to learn the "Axe"
skill, while it would cost the wizard 9 points.
The number of points you have to learn skills is equal to
the character's Intellect score. Thus, a character with Intellect
12 at the start of the game has 12 points to put into skills. As
characters advance in level and Intellect increases, they gain
more points.
However, just having the points doesn't do much good.
After learning the two skills you start with, you must find the
places in which to train to learn new skills. These places are
called "Colleges" and there is one for each skill in the game
(some skills have more than one college). When you locate
the college you want, you enter it, specify the character to
train, pay the cost in both Intellect and gold (training here
isn't free), and the character has learned the skill.
On the other hand, going up in level when you have the experience points is free of charge. When characters gain a
new level, they get an increase in hit points, spell points, and
three attributes chosen randomly (each attribute goes up by
one, to the limit set by race). There is no difference in experience for different classes; all professions advance at the
same rate.
Choosing the right mix for the party is very important. Since
there is a certain degree of overlapping in skills, some professions seem superfluous. For example, a Cleric has no particular advantage and must buy Priesthood skill just like any
other character (the Paladin even gets this skill for less
points!) and it works just as well for them.
By going over the chart and cross-checking skills, you can
work out a party with what is essentially multiple classes. For
instance, you create a Paladin, and give him Priesthood
along with Sword. Now you have a fighter who can also turn
undead, eliminating the need for a Cleric and freeing up a
party slot.
The one skill for which I found no use at all was "Potion
Lore." Unless you have a lot of extra points to spare, I don't
recommend learning this skill. Food was also not too much
of a problem, so the need for "Hunting" never arose.
However, two skills you do want are "View Land" and
Weapon Lore." The latter identifies weapons found after a
combat and tells if it's magical, cursed, or not. "View Land"
(usable once per day) lets you see much farther than your
current location. It is extremely helpful. On land, it helps in
locating interesting places and on the sea in finding land.
Having two wizards in the party is a good idea, giving you
some extra spell-casting power. One wizard should have
"Spirit Runes" (for healing), and one should have "Ice Runes,"
because the college that teaches Ice Runes will be hard to
find and you may have to wait until well into the game to
learn them otherwise.
Once your party is created, you begin the game near some
ruins. You have a small amount of cash, several days rations,
and (of course) nothing in the way of weapons or armor. Fortunately, there are a couple of towns nearby, and you should
be able to reach one of them without running into trouble.
Each town has its own set of shops (i.e. not all towns have
all shops). Write down which towns have what shops and the
prices in each, as costs vary widely from one place to
another. You may also want to make note of what magical
items are for sale in each town, so you know where to go
when you can finally afford one of them. I suggest you equip

your party by spending most of the money to buy weapons
and armor for the front-line fighters.
As mentioned earlier, the world is much larger than before.
The island you start on is only a very small part of it; eventually you will need to buy a ship to reach the rest of it, but that
won't happen for awhile yet.
Take your time while moving around. Don't go too far from
the towns you know about until you've had a few encounters
and made some money to buy additional food (and better
weapons and armor). After that, you can really begin to
roam, but remember to save the game often. Some parts of
the island have nastier monsters, which beginning-level
characters won't be able to handle.
Speaking of monsters, combat is very much the same as it
was in the earlier game. When fighting begins, the program
zooms in for a close-up of the area with your party and the
monsters all displayed individually. Who goes first depends on
speed; those with higher speed will be able to act sooner and
perform more actions.
Characters can do a variety of maneuvers on their turns.
These include: moving, attacking, dodging, turning undead,
casting a spell, using an item, etc. Some of these actions
(such as attacking) can be repeated to the limit of your speed
points, while others (such as spell casting) can only be done
once per turn.
One change from the previous game is that mass damage
spells (those that affect a large area, rather than an individual

monster, such as Fire Storm) can't be cast on the first round
This tends to reduce their usefulness, since monsters on
their turns will begin spreading out, making it difficult in
many cases to hit more than one or two with an area effect
spell.
Fighting continues until one side is victorious or the party
flees (monsters never run). In retreating, all party members
must exit from the same spot on the combat map. The exact
exit must be used by everyone.
If the party runs, they get no experience for the encounter,
even though they may have killed some of the monsters
before running. If the party wins the battle, all survivors
receive an equal share of experience, and some money is
added to the common pool. Once in awhile, an item of some
kind may be found, usually weapons or armor. It helps to
take these things at the start, because even if you have no
use for them, they can be sold for cash.
Aside from merchants in town, there are also wandering
merchants who ramble around the countryside. Their stock is
varied, and no two merchants offer the same items. It pays to
be careful when buying from them since not all are honest
(actually, the real problem is they will often have Neat Magical
Things for sale which you can't afford...very frustrating).
Eventually, you will be making your way into the dungeons.
A new feature here is manipulating objects to make things
happen. For example, in one room you find a crowbar. In
another room, you come across a sealed door. By using the
crowbar on the door, you can get it open (this doesn't actual-

ly happen in the game, but you get the idea). Objects found
in dungeons (and only such objects), can be dropped
anywhere, even outdoors, and you can come by later and
pick them up again.

much have to fend for yourself. Generally, if you enter a dungeon and find your party being creamed in encounters,
you're probably in the wrong place. Wait until you've gone
up a few levels before trying again.

Dungeons have traps in them, so it's smart to search a corridor several times before walking through it. The "Detect
Traps" skill gives you a better chance to find them, and Disarm Traps will automatically make them harmless once
found. You can also try to bypass a trap if you don't have the
Disarm skill, although there is a chance it will be set off
anyway (ouch).

Two items you absolutely must get are the Demon Crystal
and the Orb of Evertime. Make absolutely certain that you
get the crystal first. If you take the Orb first, you will be in big,
big trouble. In fact, you will probably have to start over again
with a new party. So, be very careful and make sure you get
these objects in the right order.

Ocean travel is simple; just turn your ship in the direction
you want to go and start sailing. Don't worry about wind
direction, just watch out for pirate ships, ghost pirate ships,
and sea monsters.
Sea combat is slightly different from land battles. Your vessel has one speed, which never changes, and comes with 75
hitpoints. If that is reduced to zero, the ship sinks and
everyone drowns. Attacks are made only with the ship's cannon. Spells cannot be cast. On the other hand, damage
taken in sea fights is applied only to the ship, not the crew.
Experience for sea battles tends to be higher than many
land confrontations (at least for part of the game). This offsets the lack of treasure. However, ship repairs can become
very expensive if you spend a lot of time fighting on the
ocean. Unless you have a nice cash surplus, you may want
to avoid too many combats of this nature.
Once you've started travelling by ship and visiting other
places, you'll find that "where to go next" is not an easy question to answer. Clues are scarce in this game and you pretty

Overall, Demon's Winter is an improvement over Shard of
Spring, but it does have its weak points. Combat tends to be
uneven once one gets past the beginner stage. Opponents
are either easy to defeat or extremely difficult to overcome.
The tests for obtaining the Orb are wildly imbalanced. For example, my wizards only had to face a single rinky-dink imp,
while my poor barbarian had to take on a dragon single-handedly.
A coordinate system of some type would have been very
helpful when travelling on the oceans. Mapping can be useful, but at best it's only a rough guide to some of the places
you must reach, and it's easy to get lost when you're sailing
around.
The addition of new classes was a good idea, but perhaps
not as well thought out as it could have been. Ten is too
many. Given the overlap of skills, some consolidation would
have been better.
Bottom line: An improvement over Shard; essentially a
game for the mid-level adventurer.

Field Trip

The Halls of Mediagenic

Fantastic Voyages II
The Whirlwind Tour Inside the
Entertainment Industry Continues

The exterior looks like any other exterior in the Menlo Park industrial park.
A rainbow-hued logo adorns the corporate sign; visitors walk into a central
reception area to be greeted (and
granted access); and the office space is
divided into cubicle after cubicle. Of
course, visitors might notice a few
strange sights: the cubicle decorated in
early National Enquirer headlines, the
artist's nook with a skeleton at the console, conference rooms named after
properties in a Monopoly game, a
workout room for employees, and
software packaging displayed as art. This
is the headquarters of Mediagenic, corporate patriarch of three companyowned publishers (Activision, Gamestar, and Infocom), a direct mail subsidiary (Triton), and several "Affiliated
Publishers" (Absolute, Acclaim, Interplay, Lucasfilm, microillusions, New
World Computing, and Rainbird to
name a few).
Each company-owned publisher at
Mediagenic fills a particular product
niche. The Activision label is as
focused on action/arcade games as it
has always been, but the company is
branching out into simulations during
1989. In addition the Gamestar division
aims at sports-oriented entertainment
and the Infocom division directs its energy toward interactive stories (whether the
text adventures of its early history or the
graphics adventures due to be released
shortly). The Activision and Gamestar
divisions share the Menlo Park headquarters, while Infocom still resides in
its Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters.
Sherry Whitely is the general manager
of Activision Entertainment. Her coworkers jokingly suggest that she was
brought to that position because, "She
knows what young boys like." Her
division has historically provided what
young boys like, since young boys seem
to like action/arcade games with lots of
intensity which require plenty of handeye coordination and, being the first
third-party company to provide software
for video game systems, Activision has
always been a leader in this market.
Nevertheless, Sherry insists that Activision has broadened its perspectives
to include mature men who like serious
simulations (F-14 Tomcat) and children
who want to explore a fascinating environment via the company's first CDROM game (Manhole).
In reality, Sherry knows what her customers like, because she originally
worked in the graphics and testing
departments at Activision. Testing is
where the companies try to squash the

bugs and decontaminate the code
before any bad product gets to the
public. Testing is the immunological system of any software company. Kelly
Zmak is currently the company's
product testing supervisor. He knows
that customers want "bug free" software
and they want it fast. He also knows, as
he likes to quote Mediagenic Vice-President Dick Lehrberg, that: "Software
moves at the speed of software." It
depends on the product how difficult it
is to test and finalize.

General Foods and Ringling Brothers
(among others). His marketing background emphasizes a foundational
philosophy in game design: Is the
gameplay engaging enough to keep the
gamer involved and does the simulate
accurately reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the players in the sport being
simulated?
At the time CGW was visiting
Mediagenic, Lou was extremely excited

The testing department is usually juggling around seven products at a time.
At Mediagenic, this requires the services of eight full-time testers outside
the company and four full-time testers inside the company. Kelly says the testers
become so proficient that, for example,
they can run all the way through a new
SKU of The Last Ninja in 45 minutes.
For those who are interested, products
are usually developed in portions of a
program called "cells" and each tester is
usually responsible for about 15 cells at
a time.
Sometimes, however, even when a
product goes out the door without a
problem, people have problems. That's
where the Customer Support Department comes in. We asked customer service employees, Ken Balthaser and Tony
Van, to share with us some of the
humorous conversations with customers
they could remember.
Ken thought one of the best was
probably when Hacker was first released.
One customer called up and complained that he couldn't break into any
computer systems with the program. He
actually thought the program assisted
people in breaking into computer systems. Another time, he couldn't believe
the nerve of the fellow who called up,
said he was building a pirate BBS to
download illegal software, and offered to
give Ken the number.
One customer service story with a long
history dates back to the Activision
cartridge days when the Atari 2600 was
king. It seems that one little old lady is
reported to have called the company because the cartridge didn't fit into her
machine correctly. The customer service
representative calmly asked her if she
was sure it was a VCS. "No," the little old
lady replied, "it's an RCA."
The other company-owned publisher
at Mediagenic's Menlo Park plant is the
Gamestar division. After a recent shakeup, Lou Viveros is directing the division.
Lou is new to the entertainment
software industry. Before joining the
company, he worked with Ogilvie and
Mather, a high profile public relations
agency which handled accounts for

about the upcoming release of Pete
Rose Pennant Feuer. He also tipped us,
however, about the future plans to
release a football game with celebrity
background and endorsement from a
former Super Bowl quarterback and basketball game designed with a prominent
scorer in the NBA.
In short, the people at Mediagenic are
people persons. They genuinely love
what they do and, as symbolized in the

rainbow hue of their logo, want customers to expect a promise of sunshine
in every product.

Of Epyx Proportions
The well-landscaped exterior and business-like reception area belies the funloving attitude of the people behind the
products from Epyx. There is a quiet
dignity to the workplace, even in those
cubicles, affectionately known as the
"rabbit warren," where the programmers
work. Nevertheless, there is an enthusiasm, humor, and genuine caring
within their company.
For example, Cheryl Knowles is the artistic director at Epyx. When Cheryl's
daughter, Shannon, was born, the company allowed her to come to work with
her mother. Now, when you walk into
Cheryl's office, two things stand out: a
computer and a baby crib. The younger
Knowles became affectionately known
as, 'The Company Baby."
On the other side of the rabbit warren,
Kevin Furry (Project Manager and
Programmer) placed an empty, six foot
tall, plastic tube beside his office door.

He allegedly promised to quit when the
tube was full of pennies. With irreverent
glee, the "lower echelon" programmers
began to cram the tube with spare copper coins. When CGW visited the company, Kevin had just moved into his new
office (Legoland), but he was only five inches short of having to fulfill his hasty
promise.
On executive row, Carl Hess serves as
the controller for the company. One
doesn't usually think of those who serve
as financial "bean counters" as having a
sense of humor. On Carl's birthday,
however, his office was awash with
paper mache and balloon fish, even
dead fish nailed to a board. R.J. Michal
(one of the fathers of the Amiga)
dressed up as a mermaid and Dave
Niedl, one of the programmers, assumed the role of King Neptune. R.J.,
who is working on a secret project
rumored to be more mind-boggling
than a nuclear-powered toaster, and
Dave opened the birthday celebration by
proclaiming that Carl was being "tried
for crimes against nature." As judge and
jury, the mermaid and god smashed a
pie into the executive's face.

As our tour continued, CGW discovered that even the Customer Support Department has a sense of humor.
When the ladies became tired of being
asked, "Who's the blonde babe on the
California Games package?", Mitzi McGelvray wickedly responded that she
was. Of course, the women have their
own version of the California Games
poster, complete with a very masculine
blonde hunk where the "blonde babe" is
normally portrayed. Brandy Wilson still
chuckles about the dealer who was
prompted by a program to "Hit Any Key"
and called her to ask, "Where's my 'Any'
key?" Patricia Stoesser remembers the
fellow who mailed in a Sub Battle
Simulator disk in the 3.5" format. It
seems the fellow's wife had run over the
disk three different times because he
was playing it too much. The letter
promised that if the company would
replace the disk, he would never, ever,
ever play the game unless his wife gave
him permission.
Epyx continues to have its reputation
as a leading publisher of action games,
but to CGW, it has a reputation for interesting personalities, as well.

there first and the fact that the Japanese were waiting for the torpedo attacks means that everything worked against the torpedo squadrons.
However, the dive bombers came in completely undetected and unopposed. I was over the Kaga first and when McClusky came in on top of me
I pulled off to go to the Akagi. When I got to the Akagi I made my dive
from 15,000 feet and there wasn't a single gun turned on during my entire
run.
COW: Really!?
Best: Yes, really!! In fact Mitsuo Fuchida in writing his book "Midway: The
Battle That Doomed Japan" said that they were steaming along, launching
fighters. He happened to look up just as the first bomb was released from
a diving airplane above him. Nobody had seen or heard anything.
COW: You mention Fuchida's book on Midway. What books would your
recommend as background information for the period covered by Battlehawks?
Best: The best overall book is Walter Lord's Incredible Victory [Harper &
Row, 19671, it gives you a feeling of personal involvement. The Battlehawks
bibliography includes a very complete list of books on the subject.
COW: Turning to the game itself, what do you think of Battlehawks 1942
now that you have seen it?
Best: When Lucasfilm first talked to me and told me that the game would
have movie quality I had reservations and was skeptical. However, I am
tremendously impressed with the look and feel of the game. Tremendously!
COW: The dive bombing sequence in Battlehawks 1942 is really exciting.
In reality, when you go "over the hump" and point your aircraft down in that
70% dive, what do you see? What do you think? What do you feel?

Best: As you approach the target you see it below you off to one side.
The target disappears under your wing before you begin the dive. You
push the stick straight forward, going over the hump, and all of a sudden
you are vertical. It feels like the first big drop on a rollercoaster. Your
stomach starts to float up into your nostrils.
As to what you think during the attack. You don't. You are doing something you have practiced a hundred times. It's like shooting baskets in bas
ketball, you don't really have any particular thoughts just before you do it.
You are doing unconscious coordination.
When you go into a vertical dive from 20,000 feet you have all kinds of
time to study the ship below you; to check the wind indications; to check
your angle of attack; to check the aircraft around you. In my case there
were fighters being launched as I came down and that was a matter of
some concern to me in getting out.
But there really isn't any excitement. There isn't any courage or fear.
While you are in the dive it's just a problem to be solved.
COW: Wow! ... OK. Now tell us about torpedo bombing in Battlehawks. In what ways does the game give us an accurate feel for torpedo
bombing?
Best: The visualization of the torpedo attack is very good, but the stall
speeds are a bit off.
Falstein: We are reworking that sequence. The stall rate and angle are
being adjusted based on what Dick has told us.
COW: In what specific ways is Dick adding to the realism of the game?
Falstein: He has helped us fine tune the responsiveness of the controls.
He is helping us a lot with the documentation, and is giving us the feeling
that we are on the right track.
COW: In closing, do you have any final comments about Battlehawks
1942?
Best: I am exceedingly impressed by the game to the point that I am
thinking about buying an IBM just so that I can play the game at home.

The biggest disappointment was the small number
of new releases and the difficulty many users had in obtaining what few there were.
Unlike Nintendo, Sega
steadfastly refused to allow
third-party publishers into
the market. This was true, at
least, until their late-summer
agreement with Activision.
As a result, while NES library
grew by leaps and bounds,
Sega's just inched slowly forward. When a dud is

The Best
of Nintendo
This was a breakthrough
year for Nintendo in the
United States. In many ways,
Sega and Nintendo started
1988 on an equal footing.
True, there were more Nintendo systems than Sega
systems, but Sega was
taking large strides to close
the gap with its superior 3-D
system and light gun. Not
only has the gap not closed,
but Nintendo has seemingly
blown it even wider. By supporting regulated third-party
publishing for its system,
Nintendo has built up a
non-pareil library that reflects
a diversity of entertainment
genres.

-Jaws
(LJN)
Jaws is a combination action-strategy and, occasionally, both simultaneously.

Target games are the
weakest area of the NES
library, but Hogan's Alley is
an entertaining variation on
the theme. It forces the
player to discriminate among
targets rather than simply
blast away willy-nilly. Before
players pull that trigger, they
must ask, "Is that a good
guy or a bad guy you're
about to waste?"

This game was rescued
from Broderbund's computer software vaults, updated slightly, and sent out
to challenge all the bright
new games for the Nintendo system. Frankly, it blew
them out of the water. Great

moves (piledrivers, clotheslines, and suplexes). There

BATTLE CHESS: Combine medieval
3-D combat, Monty Pythonic humor, and
one of the world's oldest games, and you
have the latest creation from Interplay.
Stunning graphics and animation combine with a powerful chess program to
put new life into an old game. Watch
knights literally chop each other up in a
scene reminiscent of Monty Python &
The Holy Grail. You can turn off the
animation and use this as a straight

Though it was included apparently to try to make the game
more educational and realistic, why in the worldâ€”whether Yorland
or any other oneâ€”would anyone on a ship equipped with computerized triangulation want to depend so heavily on a clumsier,
less accurate, more time-consuming method? Navigation is still
clumsy with autoplot, but it is not as much a pain in the portside
as manual triangulation.

Commendations
Kudos must be given to Interstel for marketing a game in
which violence has very little emphasis. Nevertheless, the game
might have been better if it had had more battles and some of
those thieving aliens had still been around.

the coin-op by Tradewest,

House, through a joint-venture agreement with
Tradewest, is introducing
the game for personal computer play, but the

Jaleco's City Connection

obstacle course that
stretches from New York to
Tokyo, by way of London,
Paris, and India. Drivers collect oil cans to throw at the
enemies in pursuit of the
car. The vehicle lays down a
color trail behind it as it
toots on down the unusual
three-tiered highway, dodging bad guys, good guys
(the cops), and hurdles on
the roadway. . . . According

2,250,155 points. . . . A new
joystick from Wico boasts ergonomic design (that means
it has been tested for comfort and usability). The Ergostick is made of soft, pliable
material, and form-fitted for
perfect hand grip. The fire
button is on the bottom for
easy operation by the index
finger and the shaft is
centered on top to operate
easily with finger-tip control.
The Ergostick provides feedbackâ€”a slight clickâ€”when
you move in any direction or
press the fire button. It
retails for $24.95 and is compatible with Atari 2600,
7800, 400, 800, 1200,
ST, and XE systems, Commodore 64/128, Vic-20,

Bottom Line
Not recommended for adventure garners unless they are interested in intricate navigational techniques.

On this page, a number of games and articles are listed for
evaluation. For each game you have played or article you
have read, place a 1 (terrible) through 9 (outstanding) next
to the appropriate number on the card placed opposite
page 4.

Be it known to all gentle persons that the
games inscribed above are honored for
their high popularity with the people of our
fair land. These august games have been
well spoken of by our readers over a goodly period of time and, thereby, have gained
the respect and good will of the powers
that be at CGW. Be it known to all that
read these words that any game found on
this list is a game of renown and worthy
of play by all.

Game Ratings Chart

Both CGW's overall Game of the Year, "Empire," and
Adventure Game of the Year, "Wasteland," strengthened
their position at the top of their respective ratings lists by
slightly improving their score. In the only real movement
in the Action/Adventure Top Ten, "Stealth Fighter" and
"Falcon" looped around each other in their continuing

dogfight over fifth position.
Except for the continual downward slide of older titles,
the Strategy list seems firmly entrenched. "Rommel: Battles for North Africa" is the only fresh title in the top 20,
but that could change when "Red Storm Rising" is rated
and "Battles of Napoleon" is finally released.
