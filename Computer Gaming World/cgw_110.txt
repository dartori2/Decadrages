Each of the aircraft are externally rendered in smooth gradient shades and sleek shapes, without any indication of quirky polygons.

As evidence, consider it is nor a random walk that the prince is on. Prince of Persia 2.

An unnamed peasgain the abilities he needs to best Jaffar. ant visiting Persia falls in love with the daughThis more sophisticated storytelling ter of the Sultan, who is being courted in the Sultan's absence by his treacherous Grand doesn't turn Prince of Persia 2 into something Vizier, Jaffar. When Jaffar learns of our hero's it's not, a subtle and mature exploration of psychological themes. It is still a climbing interest, he hurls the young man into the land's deepest dungeon, from which it is then jumping game in the Nintendo mold, with vicious puzzles to solve and endless hordes of the player's job to escape, or die trying. foes to slay. However, the game does take on a depth and a resonance that its predecessor did not possess. Since I called the first game \"the Star Wars of its field\" (and have lived to regret it, after seeing that giddy phrase plastered all over Broderbund's ads and packaging), what does that make Prince of Persia 2? At the risk of getting blurbed again, I would say that Prince of Persia 2 not only is in every dimension better than Prince of Persia, but that it is the cruelest, most infuriating, least merciful-in That's certainly a good enough narrative to support a climbing-jumping game, especially short, the best game of its type I have ever cha played. when the game is as good as that one was. Yer, as storytelling goes, it's a little thin. When This Time It's Persian-al confronted with the challenge of writing Prince of Persia 2, designer Jordan Mechner The game is divided into three major decided to craft something meatier. So, he chunks, each of which is further divided into roughly five levels. Each level consists of a reached back into our cultural memory and multi-screen environment with an entrance (probably without realizing it) dug up a plor and an exit. The player's goal in cach case is that derives directly from such Tales as to get the prince past all the obstacles that lic Hawkesworth's \"Almoran and Hamet\" and between the two.\" Johnson's \"Rasselas.\" Obstacles range from the obvious (chasms As the game opens, the princess and her to be leapt, sword-wielding warriors to be suitor have been wed, leaving Jaffar to plot fought) to the tricky (blades that slash out of recesses in the wall, spikes that skewer the player a la Raiders of the Lost Ark) and the unspeakable (decapirared heads that fly around and bite the prince to death, animated skeletons that cannot be killed). What makes the game so difficult is that these obstacles do not crop up one at a time, but all at once and in the worst possible combinations. For instance, at one point the prince finds himself on a ledge with a skeleton waiting below. If the prince climbs down, the skeleton will attack. This, by itself, is manageable: Skeletons can usually be disposed of temporarily by striking them often enough that they fall to pieces. However, in this case, the player has a problem: Taking one step back from where he climbs down will cause the prince to step on a tile that will shoot a poisoned dart at him, while two steps back will get him impaled on a set of spikes. Just to make matters worse, the ledge is unstable and apt to collapse on the prince's head. The best solution to this puzzle is to avoid it. There is another way around which, though not easy to survive, at least has the advantage of being possible to survive.

"peyieun 49 A POOOOO MEREDELSERNE described above, only a few of which really are impossible and only a few of which can be avoided. The solutions sometimes demand the timing of a master juggler and the hand diamond cutter, but solutions do exist and, like it or not, the player has to find them or admit defeat. The wonder of it all is that one keeps at it, dying and dying and dying again, until finding the way past each impasse; but the fact is that one does. At least a dozen times while playing the game I threw up my hands and said \"To hell with it!\" But always, a few minutes later, I had rebooted and was ar it again. Prince of Persia 2 has an appeal that is absolutely irresistable. Lots of games have puzzles, but few have puzzles that have been ly to give one the maximum amount of trouble, puzzles that are so ingenious, or puzzles the cracking of which gives one such satisfaction. Anyone with an in the magic force he has learned rather than in mid-battle (or wherever) but at the start of in his conventional weapons. the level on which the save command was \"The debt to Lucas can be seen in the game's executed. Some of the larger levels have midgraphics as well. Visually, the game could be level \"save points\" so that one does not have an Indiana Jones movie: one races across to play the entire way through again and rooftops in a Middle East city, through again, but one still has to re-do huge, difficult booby-trapped caverns, and around a flame chunks of the game long after one is sick of red Temple of Doom. One travels by boat, them. by flying carpet, and on horseback. The Other bits of business also make playing the prince, though young and turban clad, has game unreasonably difficult. For instance, something of a Harrison Ford quality to him drawing one's sword makes the prince take a as he skids to a stop at the very edge of a step forward, even if he is standing on a precipice, catches the edge of a pit just barely narrow pillar and the step forward will send too wide to leap across, hangs by his fingertips him plummeting to his death. It wouldn't over pits of lava, and runs, arms Mailing, with have hurt the game at all, and would have led an army of skeletons at his heels. (Players of to less tooth-gnashing, if this were not the the first game will remember its incredibly case. detailed, realistic animation. Though less Similarly, players learn the hard way to startling the second time around, it is no less ignore the instruction manual's reassuring impressive.) advice about running jumps: \"Don't be afraid The game's combat sequences are as excitThe game's combat sequences are as excitof pressing the '8' keyl too early: of pressing (the '8' key too early; the Prince ing as anything Lucas ever cooked up, not will wait until the last possible moment to only because of the variety of enemies, each jump.\" I cannot count the number of times I with its own strategies and weaknesses, but died as a result of pressing the \"8\" key too also because of the resounding clangs of clashcarly and the Prince's not waiting nearly long ing steel, the grunts of wounded combattants, enough to jump. the invigorating soundtrack in the background, and the ingenious tactics that are available to the player. Yes, the player can thrust and slash and parry his way to success, but he can also use the game's deadly devices and traps to his advantage. For instance, toward the end of the game the prince comes face-to-face with a nastylooking high priest standing just inches away from one of those telltale slashes in the wall that mean a blade is contained within. I immediately thought of the Nazi mechanic The time limit that kicks into effect a fifth julienned in the plane propeller in Raiders of of the way through the game (\"Waste no the Lost Ark. Sure enough, two thrusts was all more time! I am dying!\") is probably also an it took to back the goon into the blade. Rest unnecessary annoyance. The prince can die in pie and be resuscitated an unlimited number of times, but when the timer runs out, the game Good and Evil is over. As a result, the player is encouraged It is worth pointing out, in the interest of to get through each level as quickly as possigiving fair warning to players before they pick ble, often bypassing those sections that don't up a game this addictive, that the same things lead directly to the goal but which contain that make Prince of Persia 2 so good also difficult-to-get, life-enhancing potions. Unsometimes make it hard to take. Prince of fortunately, if one bypasses all those potions, Persia 2 is a very difficult game which is one reaches the endgame with plenty of time finc-but there is merciless and there is merto spare but too few hitpoints to battle Jaffar. ciless. It's one thing to have to replay a scene So, it's back to the beginning. 30 or 40 times until one gets it right. It's Other than that complaint, however, Prince another thing to have to replay scenes 30 or of Persia 2 merits nothing but salaam after 40 times even after one has solved them, salaam.

It is a virtuoso There are 10 slots on the save-game menu performance by Mechner, one of the field's and the game allows one to save at any time, most devious puzzle constructors, and it even in mid-battle. This seems very generous should provide the field's best gamers a until one discovers to one's horror that when chance for some virtuoso performances of a saved game is restored, it doesn't drop one their own. CGW ounce of game-player in his or her soul will not be able to sleep if it means stranding the prince on an unfinished level. So, one's eyelids get heavier and one's reflexes more sluggish, but one plows ahead anyway. It's a matter of pride. As Good as It Lucas Looking at Prince of Persia 2 with a critical eye, it strikes me that my Star Wars comment was more apt than I realized. At the time, I only meant that, like Star Wars, Prince of Persia was mindless entertainment, but mindless entertainment of a very high order. In fact, the two have more in common than that. Whether it is because Mechner and George Lucas were inspired by the same sources or because Mechner was inspired by Lucas, playing Prince of Persia 2 feels a lot like playing a George Lucas movie. There are many obvious parallels: the prince, a Luke Skywalker type if there ever was one, receives pleading distress messages from his imprisoned princess. The prince drops into a chamber whose walls close in and crush him. The prince gets his father's sword and uses it to battle the forces of evil. In the game's final moments, the prince has to trust Parte 16 Computer Gaming World "

Beyond Id Software's own successor to the action game crown, Doom, two other games caught our arrention as possible competitors. Bethesda Softworks' Terminator: Rampage looks a lot like Doom in terms of the 3-D play environment, but it builds on the Terminator universe. Isle of the Dead from Merit Software isn't as impressive graphically, but it makes up for the lack with enthusiasm, gore and the spicy addition of a little gratuitous T&A. We see it as \"Total Recall meets The Zombies\" with an art style that looks like MAD magazine artist Don Martin meets the EC Horror Comics that preceded MAD.

Several of the games are adjustable for speed and difficulty, using familiar Windows sliders. Further, the team was so determined to have the games look and sound like the coin-op versions that they video-taped the coin-op machines and bit-mapped the graphics frame-by-frame in order to get identical graphics.

"Larry's Big Score digitized the sound effects directly from the coin-op machines. Another product which proves that Windows is a conducive environment for arcade action is from a new Davidson affiliate, 3DI. Their new product, Earth Invasion, is an arcade package of new games reminiscent of Defender, Star Raiders and Space Invaders. All of the games feature 256-colors, midi-sound and 3-D Studio-style rendering of space ships, where appropriate. The games are further enhanced with lots of peripheral animation. Another sign that action classics are making a definire comeback, albeit in rejuvenated and enhanced form, is the fact that Jon Freeman and Anne Westfall are revamping their original FA hir Archon as SSI's new Archon Ultra. The game still begins on a strategic board where gamers try to capture all the enemy pieces (Chess without the Checkmate) or occupy all five \"power points.\" Then, as action occurs, players engage in a fast-paced arcade sequence. The game allows one or two players and features 3-D monsters (pieces) in 256color VGA. Gamers who remember Gauntlet will probably enjoy QQP's Red Crystal, an action/adventure for one or two players in cooperative or competitive mode. Players view the action in side-by-side windows, and the on-screen characters have attributes that range from 1-6 points. The company assures us that the game will feature modem play. Another classic style of action game that is making a comeback is the pinball game. Amtex, makers of Tristan, has signed a distriHockey. Although the IBM version won't ship until 1994, the video game versions featured the dulcet digitized tones of sports commentator Al Michaels and digitized images of Brett Hull.

"meunei Genestcaler leapt suddenly onto the screen. Gamers who enjoyed the nail-biting anxiety exhibited in the Alien films will undoubtedly appreciate the Space Hulk atmosphere. Beware! (Glitches And Grumbles) As polished as Space Hulk is, a few glitches and program foibles need to be mentioned. Giving Terminators their marching orders via the planning screen is an invaluable program feature. Unfortunately, the dull-witted Terminators will often blunder into simple obstacles, unable to go around them or choose another course of action. Improved AI in this area (such as allowing troopers to walk around obstacles and turn to face approaching enemies) would go a long way to making the space marines a much more effective fighting force. Strangely, there is no post-installation setup utility which would allow players to toggle sound and music. If the game was installed with PC sound and the player later adds a Sound Blaster, the entire game must be re-installed. This user-hostility extends into parts THE EU! the space marines themselves, aspiring commanders will quickly realize that victory depends almost entirely on the rigorous application of sound strategy and tactics. As tough as the Genestealers are, the Terminators aren't totally helpless.

Selecting to restart a campaign brings up a new screen with the enigmatic query \"Are you sure?\", making it all too easy to erase a hard-fought campaign when the player thinks he is simply dropping to DOS. A more descriptive display informing the player what exactly is being done would be welcome. Admittedly minor issues, these interface foibles nevertheless place an extra burden upon the gamer. To The Emperor! (Verdict) Gory, exciting and filled with lots of exploding ordnance, Space Hulk is a first-rate game of tactical \"infantry versus xeno\" combat. Nick Wilson and his programming team should be congratulated on one of the best boardgame to computer game conversions yer. The game simply cries out for a sequel equipped with multi-player support, improved trooper Al and more mission options. Scenario disks and a mission builder would also be a nice touch. Wish lists and glitches aside, I found Space Hulk to be an immensely enjoyable journey into the depths of pixelated xenophobia. Gamers looking for an excuse to don a space suit and eradicate a simulated race of hostile aliens should find that Space Hulk suits them well. Cow Page 34 Computer Gaming World "

"Broadening The Spectrum Spectrum HoloByte Looks To The Future COMPANY REPORT nce upon a time, Spectrum Holo Byte was part of Sphere, Inc. Sphere, in turn, was controlled by a company within the Maxwell media empire of tabloid publisher Robert Maxwell. After Maxwell's death, Spectrum HoloByte founder Gilman Louie managed to get enough venture capital together to buy back the company from the Maxwell interests. As part of that funding, the investors placed their own management team inside Spectrum HoloByte. Another Opening, Another CEO CGW wanted to know what changes that management team would make and how that would affect future product. We were concerned about personnel changes and wondered what the agenda of Spectrum's new investors would be. So, we interviewed new Spectrum-Holo Byte CEO Patrick Feely. Feely immediately expressed his charter in terms of broadening the company's product line. He stated that he considered the company's strong product lines to be Tetris, Falcon, Star Trek: The Next Generation and a \"player to be named later.\" His goal is to build a brand-based identity for the successful lines and add to those lines through acquisition and development. Next, he established that the company's immediate priorities were to: 1) develop the Patrick Feely, Spectrum HoloByte CEO, looks over his plans for expansion. company's strong suits (flight simulators, puzzle gaming); 2) take advantage of the cartridge business (the area where Spectrum expects the greatest sales growth, particularly with their Star Trek: The Next Generation program and with flight programs when SNES and Sega get beefed up); 3) gearing up for Interactive TV projects for both flight sims and Star Trek: TNG products; and, of course, broadening the company's product line through acquisition. We pointed out that many of the items on the agenda required large expenditures and significant ramp-up time to implement, but Feely insisted that 80-85% of Spectrum's fiscal/personnel resources were being invested in markets that can get immediate returns and only ca. 15-20% in new technology. Assuming Feely's percentages are correct, Spectrum will be expanding at a significant rate over the next few years because the \"new technology\" portion of the company's current development is already substantial (with Virtual Reality, storefront attractions, Interactive TV and 3DO products already under development). Spectrum is using some of the most exciting technology around. Unfortunately, we can't write about it, yet. Feely projected a doubling of staff over the next few years and predicted that the focus of the company will shift from \"design house\" to full-scale publisher. In addition to inhouse staff, Spectrum is publishing around five outside projects in the current fiscal year. Within two weeks of our interview with Feely, the first of the acquisitions occurred. To exploit the cartridge market, Spectrum purchased Bullet-Proof Software USA, run by Henk Rogers (long-time friend and colleague of Spectrum HoloByte chairman and founder, Gilman Louic). Bullet-Proof is not only the developer of Tetris for most console platforms, but the developer of Face Ball 2000 and a Mario Bros. title called Yoshi's Cookie. Within four weeks of the interview, CGW began to hear rumors that the company was showing interest in financially-strapped MicroProse (NASDAQ: MPRS). The word was that MPRS was finishing its fiscal year with less than a quarter million in cash and announcing a loss of over $4 million. By press time, Spectrum HoloByte had offered to provide $10 million of much-needed capital into MicroProse by purchasing subordinated debentures (an interest-bearing bond arrangement). In this case, the $10 million from Spectrum allows MicroProse to get below its $3 million debt ceiling to other lenders and gives MicroProse some breathing room. In turn, Spectrum gets interest on the bonds, equal number of directors to those presently serving on the MicroProse board and an opportunity to convert the bonds into more than 1.6 million shares of MPRS stock. In short, Spectrum has put into play a potential SSES 7832 y los 9 10 Science-Fiction author Stephen Goldin assures CGW that his scenarios are true to the Star Trek universe.

Martinez not only brings his experience in computer game and interactive movie design to the party, but has a keen sense of the value of story and character, as well. Â«Stories,\" Martinez once commented at a Computer Game Developers Conference, Â«is when things happen to people we care about.\" Spectrum is ideally prepared to venture into the world of story games. Not only does Martinez know the value of story, but the company tapped novelist Stephen Goldin (author of ca. 30 science fiction novels) to script their Star Trek: The Next Generation CRPG. Goldin wrote A Trek to Madworld based on the original Star Trek series, as well Harvey Lee, Customer Support Manager, spoofs as several of the best books in the Laser Books the gamer's vision of what happens during series of people-oriented science fiction nova customer support call. els.

This means that Spectrum has virtually \"gone public\" without having to undergo the rigors or vagaries of an IPO (Initial Public Offering). Now, Spectrum has the potential of holding up to 60% of MPRS stock and has, essentially, become the second-largest diskbased entertainment software publisher.

War in the Gulf uses a similar system to the previous titles with the player simultaneously controlling four groups of four AFVs, including the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank. The simulation has economic considerations and involves resource management. Gameplay is divided into a series of separate missions, varying from re-claiming the islands to full scale battles in the crucial oil fields. War in the Gulf features over 15 separate tank battles set among actual topographical maps of the area. The geographic region represented is reported to be in excess of 400 square miles. One hopes that this will not be prophetic, but War in the Gulf is currently out on the PC, with both Amiga and ST versions planned. The final product this month is Shadoworlds, Teque's follow-up to the interesting Shadowlands. The original product was distributed by Domark, but this latest release is now published by UK software house, Krisalis. Shadoworlds uses a further development of the Shadowlands isometric view system and also utilizes the unique \"photoscapingÂ» technique which lights up areas as you explore (and conversely darkens them as you leave). The plot moves the Shadowlands interface away from medieval magic and mystery to deep space. The player heads a team of four hand-picked space marines whose job is to explore a massive space station housing a Weapons Research Facility. This space station orbits a planet on the outer limits of the galaxy. As the story goes, decades carlier a virulent form of plant life had been ejected from the Earth.

She finds herself on a strange boat, wondering what has happened to her, where she is, and why the wall poster is dated 1840. These questions must be answered, but to do this Doralice must confront an arch criminal coming at her from different periods in time. With auto-mapping, auto-notetaking, an all point-and-click mouse-based interface, a special CD-ROM version with digitized sound, full soundtrack, and all manner of clever time parallaxes, Lost in Time could be a biggie and may build on Coktel's rapidly increasing standing.

This works well enough, but the party members' apparent lack of common sense in movement can be frustrating. Though the player may want to go through a door, this does not seem to be communicated effectively to one's characters, who often bang into walls for the thrill of it. This quirkiness could ruin the game for some, but if one copes with it, Shadoworlds is a cracking exploration, puzzle and combat extravaganza. And it's big. I am quite amazed that it fits onto two 720K disks, but this is no lunar week wonder. The graphics are average, the sound is OK, but above all, it's a bit different.

"Deuneun GDERO THERE'S A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE In LucasArts' Day of the Tentacle by Charles Ardai works! Malling Day of the Tentacle a sequel to Maniac Mansion, the pioneering 1987 adventure game that introduced both LucasArts' Â«S.C.U.M.MÂ» game system and many of Tentacle's main characters, is a little like calling the space shuttle a sequel to the slingshot. It is true that both serve the function of hurling objects great distances--space shuttles and slingshots, that is but they have so little else in common and are separated by such an enormous gulf of technical sophistication that mentioning them in the same breath is almost absurd. So it is with Day of the Tentacle and Maniac Mansion. For comparison's sake, note that one room of Day of the Tentacle contains the entire original game, as a gag. That's right: in one of Tentacle's rooms, players will come across a computer that is running Maniac Mansion. If they so choose, they can put Tentacle on hold while they play through Maniac Mansion from start to finish. Anyone who chooses to play the original will be stunned by how far the field of interactive fiction has come in the past six years. The original is there in all its retro glory: chunky, flat graphics; boxy Commodore 64 font; stiff animation; sound effects that are limited to thunks, beeps, and static; and an early point-and-click interface that lacks all the shortcuts and conveniences that make current games so much more comfortable to play. The story and puzzles are strong, but their presentation is downright primitive. Only nostalgia or curiosity will permit today's plots. There's nothing for Green Tentacle to do but call for help. A better connected tentacle might have sent his plea to one of computer gaming's more reliable heroes: Indiana Jones, for instance, or King Graham. Maybe even the Avatar. Those guys are hard to reach, though, so Green Tentacle sends his nore by carrier hamster to the one adventure game hero he knows: Bernard Bernoulli, the geeky, gawky, stoopshouldered protagonist of Maniac Mansion. Bernard promptly enlists the help of two new characters: Hoagic, an appealingly moronic slob with all the brains (and the shape) of a bowling ball, and Laverne, a wild-cyed space cadet whose voice suggests that she has been heavily, but insufficiently, sedated with valium. Together, these three musketeers Menizc Mansich A CARTOON AVENTURES SCHAFT GROSSMAN gamers to suffer through what was once stateof-the-art but is by today's standards crude. Compare this with Day of the Tentacle. Its graphics are lush and colorful, with skewed perspectives and grotesque characters that could have been lifted from vintage Warner Brothers cartoons. Every scene is animated, with characters performing lots of weird, once-in-the-game actions rather than just cycling through a stock series of poses. In the CD-ROM edition, every single line of dialogue in the game is spoken out loud and not only spoken, but spoken in voices that would have done the late Mel Blanc proud. Gameplay is smooth and intuitive, the interface having been designed to give players a minimum of frustration. Even the font in which the game's text appears is custom-designed, angular, wacky, and just right for the game's cartoony atmosphere. So Long, Sucker! Day of the Tentacle begins when a stream of inappropriately disposed toxic waste kills a cute little birdie and causes a self-willed purple tentacle, surly and ill-mannered to begin with, to murate into a super genius with thoughts of world domination. His good-guy companion, Green Tentacle, warns him not to drink the polluted water, but he does it anyway. Then he grows stubby little arms, develops a baritone voice, thunders out an ominous warning to one and all, rises up on his glutinous sucker and hops offscreen to hatch his evil at w 700 TITLE: Day of the Tentacle PRICE: IBM: 559.95, CD-ROM: $69.95 SYSTEM: IBM, IBM CD-ROM REQUIREMENTS: 386 and higher recommended, expanded memory recommended, VGA graphics, 14MB hard drive space (floppy only) PROTECTION: Manual Look up (floppy version only) DESIGNERS: Dave Grossman, Tim Schater PUBLISHER: LucasArts San Rafael, CA (415) 721-3300 Commuter Comin Warl "

So it begins...and before it ends, our heroes will have to travel farther afield than the kumquat tree. Much farther. In order to undo the mischief he has wrought, Dr. Fred cooks up a plan to send Hoagie, Laverne and Bernard back one day in time to shut off the Sludge-O-Matic before before Purple Tentacle can drink the mutagenic water. However, due to a catastrophic miscal culation, Dr. Fred's time machines go kablooie, stranding Hoagie in Colonial New England, Laverne in a dystopic future in which humans are the pers of their tentacle masters, and Bernard right back where he started, in the present. Before they can get on with the plan to stop Purple Tentacle, they all have to get Back To The Present. This presents some difficulty, in light of the fact that Hoagic has no way to plug in his time machine in the 18th Century and that Laverne is a captive, first in the branches of that darned kumquat tree and then, in the tentacles' electrified kennel. What is to be done? Well, an ancestor of Dr. Fred's can make Hoagie a battery, and Ben Franklin can charge it with electricity, if Oil encourages the players to get into the spirit in every possible way, starting with the strangelooking game box (the CD version is triangular rather than square) and ending with two great punch lines that bring the game to a rousing finale.

"S. neynews TITITI The Many Saves Of Don Jonz Capstone's Eternam by Allen L. Greenberg Thile computer game designers labor to perfect the art of interactive entertainment, they may be unaware that the makers of non-interactive entertainment have spent decades undermining their efforts. For years, movies have depicted the innocuous computer as an evil presence, ready to subjugate the population it was designed to serve and entertain. Fortunately, probably due to their growing dependency on computer-generated special effects, filmmakcrs now seem content to move on to other villains. themselves reaching for the mouse to control Eternam, although any such effort will prove wasted. Nearly the entire game may be controlled from the keyboard using the four directional cursor keys. Six icons line the bottom of the screen representing the commands cake,\" \"use,\" \"speak,\" \"look,\" \"invenforvand disks acec The icone mov activated by pressing a letter key from the keyboard which causes a shockingly realistic human finger to appear on screen and select the appropriate icon. Alternatively, this \"dig. itized digit\" may first be summoned with the tab key and then moved to the desired icon with a direction key. Inside buildings, Don Jonz is seen in a standard two or three dimensional view, around which he may be guided by the four direction keys. Each time Don passes something of interest, a \"line of sight\" appears on screen along with text identifying the item. ULICA ILI It is kell BB0143 Don Jonas, Virtual Adventure Vacation Equipped only for a fantasy week away from work, Don quickly discovers that Eternam is up to its equator in trouble. At one time, the planet belonged to a race of lizard-like crea tures called Dragoons. Scalped out of the rights to this paradise world, they huddle together on one small continent where they have managed to silently take control of the planet's massive computer system, under the direction of their leader, the vile Mikhal Nuke. Don must now navigate this fantasyturned-nightmare world in order to reach the Dragoons, bring Nuke to his knees, and settle the dispute. Helping the hero is Tracy, a drop-dead gorgeous secretary who happens to be putting in overtime from inside the computer's terminals. Eternam features several continents, cach of which is as unique as it is threatening. A medieval land is guarded by a duke whose servants' passions range from sweet-meats to stone statues. Another land mass is occupied by French revolutionaries who are split into a confusing variety of factions and loyalties. A bizarre collection of mismatched machinery dominares a high-tech civilization, while a deadly pyramid overshadows an ancient Egyptian landscape. While initially appearing to be a series of continent-sized, self-contained mini-adventures, Eternam will eventually require Don Jonz to do some fast-paced continent-hopping in order to achieve his ultimate goal. Mapping these places is not absolutely necessary, but it is a simple exercise which will prove valuable as the adventure progresses. The adventures of Don Jonz turn out to be quite an interesting yarn, and are mercilessly laced with hefty doses of humor. Camco appearances by anachronistic personalities abound, including not-quite-the-crew of the original starship Enterprise. Never letting the player forget that this is indeed a fantasy theme park, technicians occasionally wander through the picture, and a passing tourist may supply help at an otherwise hopeless moment. In the tradition of several other popular adventures, two of the programmers have also been given pivotal roles in the adventure. If The View Fits Experienced adventure gamers may find ETERNAME Filmmakers have not, however, expressed any such forgiveness towards other forms of interactive entertainment such as the fantasy theme park. With this summer's release of Jurassic Park, dinosaur recreation centers throughout the world will doubtlessly suffer a decline in business. Other classic films and television shows such as Westworld, Futureworld, Fantasy Island, in addition to all of those malfunctions on the holodeck of the new starship Enterprise, have all preached the dangers connected with entering an artificially generated fantasy environment. While we might expect computer game designers to come to the defense of the fantasy parks, such is not the case. Eternam, an adventure game from the always unusual Infogrames, instead presents a frightening picture of a recreation world whose patrons risk leading exciting, yet dramatically shortened lives. m.

Exceptionally smooth-flowing three-dimensional scenery (\"virtual reality\" for those who still insist on abusing that term) creates the impression that Don is riding a bicycle or a well-trained futuristic horse. Certain inhospitable reptiles, possibly related to the Dragoons, also travel Eternam's roads in an attempt to mortally end Don's visit. For this, he is equipped with some type of self-aiming weapon, or spell, which is more than adequate for self defense. Don begins his adventure with 100 hit points which may be reduced by encounters with these creatures, or by some of his more dangerous adventures indoors. The points regenerate on their own as long as the player prevents them from reaching zero. Eternam is presented in an entertaining variety of graphic styles. Painted graphics dominate the program, but these are frequently combined with some hilarious cartoon-like sequences. There are also some digitized photographic images to represent Tracy and Mikhal Nuke as they communicate with Don from within Eternam's computer. Nearly every scene includes somc eye-pleasing action or animation. Ad Lib compatible music and Sound Blaster sound effects are available, but the player who so chooses may simply listen to the flatulent noises of the PC's internal speaker. Don would be wise to pick up any item which he is permitted to take. Most items have a use clsewhere in the game, and there is no limit to the number of items he is permitted to include in his inventory. Conversation with other on-screen characters may be initiated by Don or with another character. This conversation is of the multiple-response format, in which the program offers the player two or more choices of dialogue. Unfortunately, the player often has only one chance to select the proper statement. The wrong choice may cost the player some important information or, worse, fail to set certain critical events in motion. Frequently saving the game to disk is about the his problem. Other vital pieces of information are well-hidden throughout the game. Ar more than one point, Don will be forced to take a trivia quiz which seems something like a copy-protecHope Springs Eternam Eternam is a relatively difficult exercise to complete and will provide the player with more than a few tense and confusing moments. Its greatest achievement is clearly its remarkable and compelling story which will keep players exploring until they reach the game's satisfying conclusion. Eternam is clearly a double-edged blade-frightening players away from one type of interactive entertainment while offering them the best of another. CGW DON'T DO IT!!! SIDELINE SOFTWARE D.

"DURI EL SO SKULL HOVERLAND MAPS HERBALCORMYR LEAVETULEHRENHEIMPORT art work provided with Unlimited Adventures can be used. As a result, the dungeons tend to look similar. (If you've seen five dungeons, you've seen them all.) Whatever individual flavor a dungeon might have must arise out of the events placed in that dungeon, nor its appearance, Each module, wilderness or dungeon, can include up to 100 events. \"Event\" is a term in Unlimited Adventures which refers to all of the possible ways the game can interact with the characters. There are a total of 35 different event types including the basic Combat, Give Treasure, or Text Statement and more complicated events, such as the confusing but critical Quest Stage. Even the simplest events, like the text statement event, allow the designer to specify the conditions under which the event will occur. Thus, for example, there can be a text event that will occur only if there is a thief in the party. Events can also be linked together to form complicated branching sequences. For example, a group of ogres could ask the party (via the Question Yes/No event) if they want to undertake a dangerous mission. If the party answers \"No,\" the ogres could attack (via the Combat event). If they say \"Yes,\" a text event could describe the mission. Each of these events can be linked to additional events so long as the 100-events-per-module limit is not exceeded. order. Each adventure can include up to 44 different quests, each with up to 100 steps. However, the use of the Quest Stage event is fairly complicated and confusing, and the manual is of no help in explaining the process. The omission of any explanation from the otherwise excellent tutorial is unforgivable. To some extent, the problems with the manual have been cured by the inclusion of a massive text file with version 1.1. This document explains each and every option for nearly every major game feature. The document also acknowledges and explains the bugs found in version 1.0. With the inclusion of the expanded documentation and the bug fixes in version 1.1, Unlimited Adventures has atoned for many of its sins and emerges as one of the best game creation tools available. However, again, players should know that they are buying a product that will require a STRIP BHALL SETS capable artist with a compatible art program, don't even bother to try. (Unlimited Adventures specifically supports Electronic Arts' Deluxe Paint II and ZSoft's PC Paintbrush). Unfortunately, to protect TSR's copyright, Unlimited Adventures does not allow the designer to edit or change the artwork included in the product. A Game's Got to know Its Limitations Unlimited Adventures also does not allow the designer to create or edit magic items or magic spells. This limitation arises in part out of TSR's desire to protect the \"integrity of its game, but it also arises out of the way the program works. Each monster, magic item and spell is assigned a specific slot in the game. Changing a monster is no big deal because that change will affect only the current adventure. On the other hand, because characters can be transferred between adventures, a modified spell or magic item could be quite confusing, if not program crashing. The most glaring problem with Unlimited Adventures is its 128-page manual (or \"Designer's JournalÂ»). This would appear to provide adequate room to fully explain all of Unlimited Adventures features, but appearances can be deceiving. Fifty-six of its pages are devoted to game rules primarily directed toward a player of the Heirs to Skull Crag adventure included in the product. Skull Crag is nothing special as an adventure, except insofar as it serves as a sample of how to construct one. Admittedly, nearly all of these rules are helpful, if not necessary, to the designer of an adventure, but the significant information could and should have been presented in a more condensed form. For example, the Journal devotes 15 pages to descriptions of monsters and non-player characters. These descriptions are so limited and vague as to be totally useless to an adventure designer. Besides, the monster editor allows all of this information to be changed. These 15 pages could have been used to explain some of the more complicated adventure construction features. In particular, the tutorial should have been expanded to include an explanation of the confusing Quest Stage event. When properly used, this event allows the designer to create a sequence of events that the character must encounter in the proper CORAL HES TO SU, g THE BKS HURDLE LEHDETUTELITRENAME huge investment of their energy. Constructing a good, interesting adventure with Unlimited Adventures will take many, many hours of work, much of it spent at a desk with pencil and paper planning event sequences and drawing maps. Most roleplayers will probably want to leave the labor to the professionals and immerse themselves in pre-created worlds. Still, for the rare breed who likes play that more resembles work, Unlimited Adventures provides unlimited job opportunities. CGW BOTTNGBEETLE LEIRS TO SKULL SPRITES BLUE DRAGON LERUETUTELIORERAMETSIMPORTAURIMPORT BEHOLDEREETLE BLIEK BRADING Unlimited Adventures comes with a library of 127 default monsters and nonplayer characters (NPCs). All of these beings can be edited. Changes can be minor (such as increasing an orc's hit points by one) or major (renaming the monster and changing each and every characteristic, power and ability-in effect, creating a new monster). The default monsters can be restored with one click of the mouse. Included is an extensive art gallery containing five wilderness maps, eight big pictures (covering the upper half of the screen), 127 combat icons, and 38 sprites (pictures used to show monsters approaching the party.) Unlimited Adventures allows the designer to replace any of these graphics with his own art work. However, this art must be created according to certain exacting specifications in either the PCX or .LBM format.

"meuneu Conquistadors In Space Sierra Weighs Anchor With Coktel Vision's Inca by Chuck Miller n 1532, the ill equipped army of Francisco Pizarro undertook the conquest of Peru. With only 170200 conquistadors, he successfully defeated tens of thousands of Incan warriors under the leadership of Atahualpa, emperor of the Tawantinsuyu empire, a kingdom that extended from Chile to the equator. How this feeble Spanish force was able to accomplish such a monumental, though ruthless task forms the basis of the story behind Inca, Sierra's latest import from their \"French connection,\" Coktel Vision. So, Where's Your Cadillac, El Dorado? Inca transports the player back in time to the year 1525. Here one finds Huayna Capac, Atahualpa's father, the one Inca aware of the impending arrival of the conquistadors. Assured that the powers of the Incas will never fall into the hands of vages he has hidden these powers away in a safe place to await the coming of the prophesied golden one, El Dorado, destined to appear 500 years hence. The goal of El Dorado, and the player, is to INCA discover these powers and bring about the rebirth of the Inca empire. Of course, the player must face a powerful opponent in the process of fulfilling this prophecy-Aguirre, symbolizing the Spanish conquistadors, and constantly in search of wealth and material power. Lost Wealth Of The Incas in the game also disrupted the suspension of disbelief. Inca is a game rich in background, steeped in mystique, and yet, unfortunateAs a result, Inca comes across as a loosely ly, unable to fully deliver the goods. While strung together series of action sequences, i found the concept interesting and the mazes and puzzles, resulting in the appearance of a collection of games rather than a story promising, the game failed to achieve its full potential.

Actually, I am probably biased as I have been a fan of new-age music for some time Gallons Of Galleons now.

One can only \"save\" their progress at certain points. This is accomplished by means of a \"save code\" comprised of cight random numbers provided by the game. As such, each installation of Inca will result in a different set of codes. So, Does Inca Stinka? Not necessarily, depending on one's gaming experience and preferences. While Inca is an interesting title, there is not enough substance to satisfy the seasoned gamer (who can expect to derive about eight to twelve hours of play-not much considering its retail price). The story line is weakly implemented, and there is insufficient reward for successfully completing the game (more a sense of relief mingled with some disappointment). Inca is not a dismally boring game by any means, yet it is not all that exciting either. I do admire the respect and appreciation paid to the ancient Incas in this title. It was handled well, increasing the player's awareness of this people's unique heritage and, as mentioned several times before, the soundtrack is superb (I went around for most of the day humming its enchanting music). Still, these factors do not outweigh the inherent weaknesses. In spite of its excellent presentation and strong concept, I really did not find myself challenged by Inca, or sufficiently caught up in its story. To whom then will Inca appeal? Action aficionados will most likely be disappointed with the low level of skill required in the game. On the other hand, the puzzles are also only of modest difficulty. What this amounts to is a game that will not strongly appeal to either action gamers or adventurers. Its main audience will most likely be gaming ncophytes: those who are new to computer games or are only casual players. So, while there are those who have really enjoyed Inca (it does offer a modest degree of gaming pleasure), for most I would recommend investing one's dollars elsewhere, possibly in one of Sierra's other, more satisfying adventures. And, while at it, make sure to get a copy of the Inca soundtrack on music CD (available from Sierra for just $12.99, plus tax, shipping and handling).

Actually, the above may change when Pentium rigs and Power PCs are more widespread. As for memory managers, we just tested 386MAX version 7.0 and got 628K of free lower memory. We were initially quite impressed, but need to test it with more games. Question #3 asked about 3DO. It is really too carly to answer your question. There are lots of developers lined up behind 3DO and it has a lot of potential. It still isn't clear how games will be saved on the machine or how many expansion peripherals will be manufactured to support the base machine. We're still watching with great interest. If you want to talk flight simulators (Question #4), most of us still opt for Red Baron. Not only is the Dynamix game still a satisfying gaming experience, but it even works on the 386 Notebook our editors take on business trips!) With regard to Question #5, we don't really know about OS/2. We have not had an opportunity to test it with games. We suspect that memory intense games like Strike Commander would have complications under OS/2, but we are not sure. Maybe some of our other readers can enlighten us.

"Cara that I may stop buying them and start a boycott. I am very much a believer in freedom of speech and freedom of the press. However, I am not a believer in the suppression and exploitation of any group of people, and women are people. If I wanted to view pornography, I would have bought a pornographic magazine. Tina Schumann Seattle, WA The magazine is great, but I wish you could give some kind of score or grade at the end of the reviews for each game you review. It is sometimes hard to read through your writer's babble. Brandon Valeriano La Mirada available for $4.60 each (including shipping and handling). We do hope to take another look at far future games in the near future, but have not currently scheduled the section. Lowest Common Denominator Regarding the editorial in issue 108, I feel that computer games have already reached the lowest common denominator. Why computer games aren't like TV, however, is because the LCD computer gamer has more intelligence and education than the LCD TV audience. As \"interactive\" media and cheaper, casier-to-use computers become more prevalent, these LCD numbers may very well converge. Glen Cox Fort Collins, CO The curious question about this convergence is whether the 500 channels which are regularly predicted by media pundits will offer more variety (because the delivery system of entertainment on demand will allow the information/entertainment providers to monitor the success of individual games/programs more precisely) or less variety. Will the diffusing of interests between 500 channels allow for narrowcasting where special interests are better served or will information providers simply seek out big numbers as in the broadcast model. We hope that the new media will follow the narrowcast model and allow for a wider wriety of interactive programming If the new world of interactive media follows the broadcast model, we are liable to end up with arcade-style \"shooters\" (running, jumping, diea-lot games) that are not suited to the response times of interactive television, interactive movies (that are very likely to be bad movies with artificial choices) or hack 'n slash CRPGs that may use special effects gore to offset their lack of interesting story. With the narrowcast approach, there might be a chance to see truly interesting stories with characters played by real people interwoven into the interactive experience. There might be opportunities for fantasy sports leagues where franchise owners get video replays of what \"their\" players did the night before. There could be electronic villages (cyburbs) where people interact in video in much the same way computer users with modems can interact in on-line games on today's networks. Right now, it just isn't clear. The Pornbroker The article on page 99 of the June 1993 issue, entitled \"Memory Management and System Configuration for MS-DOS Games,\" is accompanied by a still scene from a pornographic film. Besides the fact that I find this personally offensive, it is totally unnecessary to the message of the text, juvenile and extremely sexist. It is obvious that some of your writers and editorial staff do not think that women may be readers (and purchasers) of this magazine. If your publication intends to continue this practice, I would very much like to know, so First, let us be very clear that the screen was from a computer vame and not from a pornographic movie. Second, the scene was supposed to be ironic in that the women involved were supposed to look like they were interested in sexual frolic but were really after Les' knowledge of extended and expanded memory. So, in actuality, the scene was spoofing a sexist position as opposed to exploiting it. Third, the CGW editors and writers do think women are people. We bave several female writers to this magazine and mancine and our art director is a woman. We aren't exactly a bastion of sexism at CGW. but if we ever decide to change the format and start distributing exclusively to small stores with lots of video booths, we'll let you know. Well let Who's The Boss? In the reviews of games, there should be some kind of grade or point scale established. This way, I would be able to tell if the reviewer would really recommend the game. Sometimes, it is hard to read what their overall opinion of the game is. Bryan Wiley Wichita, KS Maybe you need a babble fish? Actually, that's Babel fish (named after the infamous tower in Genesis). Anyway, there are several good reasons why we choose not to let our reviewers use point systems. First and foremost, we respect our readers too much to do so. The job of a reviewer is to critically appraise a game with enough detail and color to allow the reader to decide if that game is for him/her. The reviewer should not be a gaming demigod who decides whether the reader should buy that game or not. Reviewing is entightening opinion and nun is enlightening opinion and numerical evaluations tend to cast that opinion into stone. Second, we value the ratings given by our readers. Hence, the treatment of the Top 100. We would not want to be in a position of putting our reviewers' opinions over the wider sampling of opinion. Third, the use of numerical evaluations tends to discourage reading the reviews themselves. Since we try to take great care in writing these reviews, we certainly don't want to undercut ourselves by providing an incentive for readers to skip the prose. In short, we don't think our readers really need to be told what to think. We just try to provide plenty of substance for them to cogitate upon. That, it seems, is the task of good writing.

"Chareware One can jump right into Scorched Earth without taking time to read the rather extensive documentation (some 63 pages worth!). It is a simple game to get the hang of playing. However, to gain the fullest amount of enjoyment, one should at least skim the provided material, as there are manifold features hidden within Scorched Earth that make the game easier and more fun to play. To dive right into Scorched Earth, Scorched Earth one simply needs to run it. (If SVGA graphics are available on one's system, by all means select that modeâthese higher resolution graphics are quite good.) Play begins with the random generation of the current level, creating the terrain and determining the location of the player's tank and that of the enemy (up to 10 players are supported). Number of opponents, the skill level of each computer player, type of terrain, sound effects, graphic resolution, and a myriad of other options can be selected by the player, with the ability to save one's settings for future sessions. This is definitely the most configurable version of this game I have come across and, I would add, the most playable and addictive. Each game is comprised of ten rounds against one's opponent(s). A winning round provides the victor with a victory purse which may be immediately invested in improved weapons, or accumulated for more substantial purchases later. During play, one's main concern is destroying the enemy as quickly as possible, knocking out his tank before the player's tank can be targeted and destroyed. Success demands accurate adjustment of angle and power of fire, and compensation for wind velocity and intervening objects. A correct determination greers the player with the colorful, fractal-graphic destruction of an opponent's vehicle. Overall, Scorched Earth, is a bargain for its modest $10.00 registration fee, providing the player with his or her password (deluxe registration is available only in the US at $20.00, offering the player the most recent version of the game and a complete loose-leaf copy of the manual. Please specify disk size). A Spanish version is also available for the same price. So, if you want a chance to scorch the enemy in an enjoyable game, register Scorched Earth with Wendell Hicken, 59 Esperanza Apt. M, Sierra Madre, CA 91024. Please send payment in US funds only. That's it for this installment Games reviewed in this column are available through numerous distributors of shareware and public domain software, as well as on many national and private on-line services.

"_Tech Gupport, Gaming On The ROM In reviewing Trilobyte's The 7th Guest, we observed three new development concerns faced by CD-ROM publishers: \"pressed\" Lmedia, increased system demands, and added hardware compatibility requirements. While it is not our intention to downplay a developer's responsibility to thoroughly test their products, we believe the reader should at least be aware of the increased difficulties encountered with developing for this medium. \"Pressing,\" mastering a program on disc, is similar to that of mastering audio CDs. While a traditional disk-based game can be be copied onto a limited number of floppy disks quite readily for beta-test distribution, transferring a large CD-ROM title to disc is more complicated and costly. CD-based games are developed on systems employing massive hard drives-gigabytes in size-in order to deal with the required volume of data. Thus, until committed to disc, a CD title can only receive limited resting (on systems possessing massive storage). When a product is ready to be pressed for testing on its intended media, a limited run of CDs is produced. At this stage, the game is tested on multiple systems for initial bug stomping. The process is repeated until, ideally, a finished bug-free product is ready for final mastering. Thus, the beta process is more difficult, lengthy and costly to implement successfully. Increased system demands refers to the ever increasing need for more processing power and RAM as a result of the increased amount of graphic and audio data that must be \"moved\" from disk to screen This matter poses a serious question to developersâthat of the minimum requirements for a title. Set the minimum too low, and the product suffers; too high, and the number of gamers able to play it is severely limited Added hardware compatibility requirements must also be considcred. Some CD-ROM drives require proprietary controller cards, while others are more generic in their needs. Many sound cards now employ integrated CD-ROM interfaces. Furthermore, new \"standards\" are constantly being established. Thus, testing a product under every conceivable hardware configuration is a daunting, often impossible task. Clearly, we have only scratched the surface of what CD-ROM development entails in added concerns. Yet, just possessing a basic understanding of what's involved in producing a CD title can go far undereta in aiding one's understanding of the delays and problems associated with developing for this media. This article was originally scheduled to run with the review of The 7th Guest in Issue 109. In the meantime, however, we have been able (with the help of Media Vision and Trilobyte) to resolve the DMA conflicts experienced with certain Pro AudioSpectrum 16 (PAS16) sound cards. For most PAS16 owners, the solution may be as simple as changing the DMA channel employed. The PAS16 defaults to DMA #5 on installation. In order to work properly with Guest, the installation software for the PAS16 should be run again, selecting DMA #3 instead. If this does not correct the problem, contact MediaVision technical support to determine if you have a properly functioning card. There have been problems with some PAS16s prior to the current revision #04 boards. Following this \"sound\" advice should enable those with PAS16 cards to fully enjoy Trilobyte's hauntingly entertaining puzzler. Guest provides a must see (and hear) experience for the CD-ROM gamer.

"Devleu U EI NLeave U I opponents, but their leader is more skilled at warfare than the prince.\" To make matters worse, the ensuing battle rages on for minutes before the prince squeaks out a marginal victory. Complaint #1: Poorly worded generic messages such as this are unacceptable in 20MB worth of game. Complaint #2: There is simply no way that this physical wreck of a woman is \"more skilled at warfare than the prince\", and capable of putting up such a fight. That this scenario could happen at all made this reviewer think twice about Challenge's quality control. And it's a darn good thing our hero did win this battle, as a princely demise will often result in the gamer being boinked right out of the program and left staring at a black DOS screen. As Challenge comes equipped with copy protection, this prospect becomes even less appealing. Triumphant he was, and as the prince continues along his way, it becomes obvious that one thing Challenge has going for it is a solid sense of humor. While quizzing a local drunk on his supposed knowledge of the other four realms of Nhagardia, our boy is told that, \"There's a realm of squirrels, and a realm of naughty prostitutes,\" followed by the slurred threat, Â«Why if you weren't forty years younger than me, stronger than me, and certainly better with a weapon than me, I'd kick your royal arse from one end of Alonia to the other.\" As in most CRPGs, travel from town to town is conducted through a \"World Map,\" a sort of satellite view of the land, and a beautiful one at that. When in a town, a \"zoom out\" option is accessible, and although this eliminates the need for hand-sketching the city streets, the \"zoom out\" view is patently ugly and reminiscent of circa 1980 Colecovision. Speaking of gamer assistance, Challenge offers a dated note-taking tool that will inevitably be ignored in favor of a pen and paper. The fact that the Challenge notebook is one of precious few elements in which the keyboard is employed at all is unfortunate as mouse mechanics leave something to be desired, and often the cursor is a tad out of sync. Keyboard shortcuts, too, would be a bit more expeditious during tedious segments. Who to maim and kill, who to befriend...as we all know, decisions of this magnitude are never easy in the real world, and aren't in Challenge either. New found acquaintances may well have complex perCRO sonalities and can't be immediately labeled as \"good\" or \"bad.\" This is a nice touch not present in all CRPGs, and character interactions must be invoked with caution (\"truth\" spells don't always solve the problem). Once the prince has the tools, learns a few spells, and assembles a strong supporting cast, he will (hopefully) find that the rumors are true and begin exploring the existence of the other four realms. He will soon find that Alonia is not the only troubled region in Nhagardia, and that the resolution of conflict is a key to the solution of the puzzle. The fact that he has to do it all in 100 days will spell problems for some, but then that's the nature of the world-saving business, isn't it? Challenge is not a simple affair, and the inherent good humor and complexity of characters do, fortunately, add to the interest. Sadly, though, one is left with a general impression that an adequate beta testing program was not conductedâthere are simply too many oversights combined with a certain awkwardness to gameplay that shouldn't exist in a finalized version.

While their progress is not good for your budget, it's important to remember that the game is a moon race. It is akin to a marathon and it does have a finish line. If an opponent gets all the firsts, following suit within a turn or two will keep things approximately even. While a bit demoralizing to trail others, it's just fine as strategy. A mishap by your opponent or a last-minute burst of speed on your part will be enough to steal the lead at a critical moment. Buzz is a deceptively simple game.

"Survey Brooks' Book Of Wargames: 1900-1950, A-P. An Annotated Listing of Games From cow's Wargame. Editor by M. Evan Brooks Aces of the Pacific art Courtesy of Dynamix Then it comes to wargames, World War II continues to produce more titles than any other single period of history. Although this period was previously covered in CGW #37 and CGW #88-89, the rapid pace of releases tends to mandate occasional updates. The computer market is no longer shifting as rapidly among different computer types as it once was. During the 8-bit era, games had to be produced for different machine types, each of which was completely incompatible with its competitors. Today, the MS-DOS machine has gained a virtual domination of the market, but incompatibilities within the MS-DOS marker itself are becoming more varied than the 8-bit market ever was. DOS 5.0 and expanded memory are virtually required: CGA graphics are extinct, and newer games require SVGA graphics cards: clock speeds below 33 MHz are becoming unsupported, and it is likely that the machine of the near future may be the 486-66. The games themselves are growing ever larger, and it is not unusual to have a game with 10 high-density disks. Sound support also causes a disconnect between machine use, and there is no fix likely to appear. Please note platform availability; a five-star game on an Atari 800 that is several years old is not of the same sophistication as a new product designed for a SVGA 486-66 PC. However, it has been given its rating for what it did, ro a lesser extent what it still does, and perhaps for the place it holds in this reviewer's heart and memory. Of course. the designers look askance at these ratings, and often deluge the magazine with voluminous complaints. Again, though, these are intrinsically subjective, and a discriminating reader should be able to temper the ratings with this writer's normal reviews in order to ascertain the inherent biases. In all candor, I have intentionally taken steps to reduce the ratings of older games; the computer marker's \"flavor of the week\" simply cannot sustain an older platform vehicle and product. Prices are difficult to determine for older games, since they are so heavily discounted, assuming they can be found at all. Thus, be aware that the prices are only a rough guideline. Also, since this guide is for reference, one should be aware that prices shift downwards rapidly. We are not omniscient; there are many holes in the data contained. Rather than delete those titles for which we have little information, they have been included for completeness. And now the CHALLENGE: a one-year subscription will be given to the reader filling in the most omissions/corrections. Please send your submissions to me in care of this magazine or via modem (on GEnie, address: M.E. Brooks; on Prodigy, HFTN43A). I will do the judging, and all decisions are final. The deadline for submissions will be three months after this article is published.

B-24 COMBAT SIMULATOR (**) (C/Ap/I/; #39) Strategic Simulations, Inc.; John Gray; 1987; O/P Int/Air/Tac/1 A simulation of the World War II Ploesti oil raids, the player must join his B-24 to the formation, fly to the target, and inflict maximum damage. While accurate, the game suffers somewhat from a repetitious nature and the fact that a single bomber in raid offers little room for initiative. Superseded by Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe. BANZAI (N-R) (Ap/l: #85) General Quarters; Owen P.

Design-your-own scenarios open the bulk of the 20th century to gaming: however, the artificial intelligence of subordinate commanders is notoriously weak. The game system will either attract or repel the player-there is no middle ground.

Rags To Riches Interplay Productions, Inc. 17922 Fitch Ave. Irvine, CA 92714 (714) 553-6655 RAGS TO RICHES: If one believes that \"greed is good,\" and delving into finances is more fun than dealing with fantasy, then the player of this new title from Interplay may be well on his or her way from Rags to Riches. Based on today's news and trading relationships, Rags to Riches allows the player to dabble in the exciting world of stocks, commodities and securities. One can play in the present, beginning his or her fiscal year on January 1, 1993, or commence their wheeling and dealing in the era of the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of play are provided in this financial simulation sporting high quality SVGA images. Have the secretary screen incoming calls, send the pit runner on his way, hire an assistant, and don't forget to call Mom every day. She has a great deal of market savvy, not to mention money to loan. IBM ($59.95). Circle Reader Service #6. MicroProse 180 Lakefront Dr. Hunt Valley, MD 21030-2245 (800) 879-PLAY RETURN OF THE PHANTOM: Gamers with a flair for the dramatic need nor mask their enthusiasm for MicroProse's newest animated adventure release, Return of the Phantom. Based upon the same game engine employed in Rex Nebular, Phantom takes a more sinister, melodramatic approach to adventure gaming. As French detective Raoul Montand, the player must investigate a series of unexplained events, all pointing to the return of the famed Phantom of the Paris Opera House, thought to have died around the turn of the century. Has the Phantom of the Opera returned, in ghostly form, to exact his revenge? Has he somehow managed to traverse time itself? Or, is someone else responsible for the strange occurrences plaguing this famous structure. This is the mystery the player must solve as he or she investigates the Opera House and the labyrinth of catacombs hidden below. IBM ($69.95). Circle Reader Service #8. LEDE la Lunar Command Halli to comfy chair Return Of The Phantom UNT Mallard Software, Inc. 3207 Justin Rd. Flower Mound, TX 75028 (214) 539-2575 LUNAR COMMAND: Beginning life as Moonbase from Wesson International, this lunar colony simulator has just been re-released by Mallard Software under the appellation Lunar Command. While some additions have been made in this upgraded titleâincluding sound, VGA graphics and some scoring enhancements this simulation is basically the same as that of its earlier incarnation. Allowing one to design, plan, build, lead, motivate and control a lunar colony, Lunar Command challenges the player to maintain a proper balance between financial prosperity and self-sufficiency. Establishing shelters and life-support facilities, excavating minerals and dealing with catastrophes all play a vital role in the lunar equation. Fail in any regard and the results could be fatal. (Running out of oxygen, for instance, does little to endear the lunar commander to those under his authority.) Strong leadership and planning abilities are the keys to success when one is over a quarter of a million miles away from home. IBM ($59.95). Circle Reader Service #7. Quantum Quality Productions, Inc. 1046 River Ave. Flemington, NJ 08822 (908) 788-2799 CONQUERED KINGDOMS SCENARIO DISK #1: If, like Alexander the Great, you've run out of kingdoms to conquer, don't sit down and weep. Pick up QQP's Conquered Kingdoms Scenario Disk #1 instead. This handy little addition to the original Conquered Kingdoms (game required) offers the player an additional 14 new scenarios, including novice and expert maps, and new terrain types (a booklet of attractive four-color maps is enclosed). Two-player modem support is available, as is traditional competition against computerized opponents. Twenty-one difficulty levels are provided for increasing one's combat pleasure. If warfare in a fantasy setting fulfills one's longings for excitement, Conquered Kingdoms will supply amply. Though not state-of-the-art in presentation, this game of geographical conquest makes up for any visual and audible lack in its playability. IBM ($39.95). Circle Reader Service #9.

HARAM A B one a glimpse of mechanized warfare during Operation Desert Storm. The player controls four tank units with a total of 16 vehicles, attempting to turn Iraqi turrets into Tiparillos. Bit-mapped VGA graphics are not state-of-the-art, but the sense of urgency, confusion and disorientation translates well throughout the game. Players can equip their M-1 Abrams, M-113 APC, M-2 Bradley or M-901 TOW launcher with four kinds of ammo in preparation for 25 different missionsâall more challenging than the actual conflict. A good interface helps make the game enjoyable and interesting, but not quite a direct hir. IBM ($49.95). Circle Reader Service #10. Laura Bow In The Dagger Oi Amon RA REALMS KANI THE OLO FORTRESS LOORE WRAITH DIFOST CURREVIARMANC SVRAEV Star Graphics Corp. 1800 SW 1st Ave., Suite 545 Portland, OR 97201-9942 (800) 831-7611 A COLLECTION OF CLASSIC GAMES: Windows gamers can now lay their hands on another entertainment pack, this one from Star Graphics, which includes three Windows games, two screen savers and a collection of Windows wallpaper. Of course, the games are the main feature of this collection. Beleaguered Castle is a version of Solitaire in which the player builds castles comprised of a pile of cards topped by a king. While the cards are face up for play, moving all cards of a like suit onto the corresponding center piles, in order from ace to king, is not as easy as it appears. Morris, based on an ancient Eng. lish board game, challenges the player to strategically place tokens on a board in Â«mills\" of three pieces in a row. Completing a mill allows the player to remove an opponent's piece from the board. When a player is down to two pieces or is blocked from further moves, the game is over. The last game in this set is based on geometric shapes. Patterns, comprised of the two puzzles Tangrams and Plates of Wisdom, requires players to move puzzle pieces into special geometric patterns. Overall, play in these games from Star Graphics is entertaining, even though the graphics are just average. Those wanting some simple Windows diversions to delve into between times of productivity may find Classic Games a logical choice. IBM with Windows ($34.99). Circle Reader Service #13. Realms Of Arkania Delegate EMEA Sierra On-Line, Inc. PO Box 485 Coarsegold, CA 93614 (209) 683-4468 LAURA BOW IN THE DAGGER OF AMON RA: The latest of Sierra's conversions to CD-ROM has made its appearance, allowing Ms. Bow to \"speak her piece\" (in southern belle fashion), along with the rest of the roaring 20's cast. As with previous Sierra CD conversions, digitized speech has replaced the on-screen text for each character and for the narrator (puzzles remain unchanged). Ideally, adding voices should increase the difficulty of play (as clues are no longer as obvious without the text displayed on screen) and add emotion to game play that cannot be conveyed in written text alone. The emotive factor, though, is only effective when the vocal acting is sufficiently realistic and believable. This is where Sierra has been weak thus far. Overall, the quality of the vocals in The Dagger of Amon Ra are adequate. However, it does suffer from vocal talent which is inferior to the CD version of Space Quest IV, Sierra's previous CD-ROM release. IBM ($69.95). Circle Reader Service #11.

Tiles And Tribulations REALMS OF ARKANIA: Meat and potatoes role-players might get their fill from this hearty CRPG based upon a best-selling German \"people and paper\" system. The character attribute system is rich and original, offering 12 character \"archetypes,\" over 50 skills with actual uses in the adventure and, interestingly, negative attributes, like superstition, greed and phobias. Playing Realms of Arkania in either a Novice or an Experienced mode, players will see the realm from several different perspectives: an overhead map for long-distance travel; a first person view in dungeons and towns; and a third person, 3-D isometric view in combat mode (a la Darklands). Detailed and occasionally fresh, Page 138 Technological Computer Innovations 255 North Cherrywood Dr. Lafayette, CO 80026-2726 (303) 673-9046 TILES AND TRIBULATIONS: A combination of action and strategy, TCI's Tiles and Tribulations gives the Windows gamer the chance to stack colored tiles to his or her heart's content, at least until sufficient errors make further progress impossible. The goal of this simple, yet tricky, game is to catch falling tiles with a keyboard-controlled paddle, and then drop them into the tile bin at the bottom of the screen. This bin, a 5x5 matrix that holds 25 tiles at a time, is where the player must stack the falling tiles in vertical, horizontal and diagonal patterns of same-colored tiles. When a patrern is complered, tiles in the pattern disappear, freeing up room for additional patterns. Tiles dropped into the bin in a random fashion will fill up the bin DEDEX BE EOS High Command Computer Gaming World "

As the head of either the Axis or the Allies, players will be commanding combat forces, managing production plus research and development, doling out foreign aid, and allocating resources. Detailed and moderately complex, High Command may be less a game than a way of life. Fortunately, the game offers five tutorials of graduated complexity to get new players up to speed and on the road to victory. Originally released by Colorado Computer Creations, the game has been given an SVGA face-lift and a minor tune up by Three-Sixty. IBM ($59.95). Circle Reader Service #15. betting advice.

RUCKUS ROULETTE: This little roulerte simulation from Villa Crespo Software offers the player the opportunity to \"place their bets\" in a financially nonthreatening atmosphere, one without risk to their bank accounts (save the cost of the game). Though it does not live up to the traditional marketing hype emblazoned on the outside of the box (\"Ruckus Roulette recreates all the excitement of this popular casino game\"), it nonetheless does offer the player an opportunity to learn and/or play roulette without losing face, money or a spouse. Ruckus Roulette allows the \"gambler\" to test out different betting strategies and ply his hand against up to four computer controlled players. Of course, longterm statistics are just a help key away. Supported hardware includes EGA/VGA graphic cards and Sound Blaster compatible sound boards. IBM ($12.95).

Newly released from Wisdom Tree, this title offers the gamer a chance to test both their faith and joystick prowess in a Nintendo-esque world. Designed for players ages 8 and up, Spiritual Warfare combines action gaming (from a top-down perspective) and Bible quizzing in a single package. Familiar gospel music plays in the background as the player traverses twelve distinct territories and answers 250 Bible questions. Converting enemies to the faith and correctly answering Bible trivia questions serve to restore the player's waning health. In addition, unlike many action games, progress can be saved at any time.

"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD HALL OF FAME The games in Computer Gaming World's Hall of Fame have been highly rated by our readers over time. They have been rated for their impact on the computer gaming hobby during their peak period of influence and acceptance by our readership. Note that the dates listed for each game are the copyright dares and may precede the actual release dates. Specific formats listed are those which CGWhas in its possession. Mech Brigade Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1985 Many Formats MECH BRIGADE Mech Brigade built on the lessons learned in publishing the World War II tactical armored combat game, Kampfgruppe, and even corrected the most oft-cited problem in its predecessor, the stacking problem. Mech Brigade featured modern armored warfare, but never quite gained the popularity of its predecessor. Since CGW's readers consistently rated Mech Brigade highly (though not as highly as Kampfgruppe) and it had improved the system beyond Kampfgruppe's original level, CGW made it one of the original inductees into the Hall of Fame.

It doesn't bog down with large empires, and we love the multi-player capability. Gangs of fun! X-wing suffers from too much puzzle-solving and requires inhuman reflexes to proceed. It's beautiful, but frustrating. Not fun.\" D. Zimmerman, Herndon, VA \"Outstanding! Star Control II is the best balanced and allaround fun game I've played in years. Even the final credits are entertaining (a la Monty Python and the Holy Grail).\" J. Shaffer, Silver Spring, MD \"I recently had the chance to play Protostar from Tsunami. It has the poorest play quality for any game I've played in months. The graphics were good but the content was thin and poorly organized, and the documentation was the worst I've seen.\" M. Smith, Verona, MS \"Super job on Pacific War! Mr. Grigsby has outdone himself this time. By harnessing the capabilities of the computer he has taken a monster the likes of SPI's War in the Pacific and turned it into a playable dream.

A few things are missing which do distort things for instance refit/shipyard work, size of port limiting the number of ships, and the ability for heavily damaged ships to limp a long way home.

"THE RUMOR BAG ometimes, things can be going too perfectly. I was out near Black's Beach so I could catch a left-breaking wave, goofy foot and all. I did a rock dance at low-tide in order to paddle out, and I found myself sitting out at the lineup with nearly every other surfer in Southern California on such a beautiful day. We kept waiting for a killer wave, just like my readers who keep waiting for Hero Software's Champions to ship. Fortunately, I had some tentatively good news for car them. I had just that day booted HeroMaker. the direct sale version of their Champions character generator. People and paper roleplayers can use their computers to create and print out their characters without having to leaf through and double check all of those rules in the hardbound book. It's a good sign. Now, maybe they'll get the adventure/story into the computer game and we'll see that long-awaited jewel. At least us frustrated superhero types now have something to do with our computers. by Duke Â«Baggy\" Speaking of hero makers, the killer wave I Dynamix will bring their Metal Tech game to was about to catch was enough to clean up the party in the first quarter of '94, as well. everybody else, but I managed to get really As I waited, the swells provided a gentle barrelled and catch enough green room time undulation that nearly rocked me to sleep. to get a few hoots from the lineup.

The whole scene reminded me that Mallard Software, the folks that create those cool scenery disks for Microsoft's Flight Simulator 5, is working on another product. This one is called Space Clipper and it's based on the Delta Clipper being developed by McDonnell Douglas (the next generation space shuttle). Not only has Mallard developed Space Clipper to be a simulation, but they are addChipper to be a sim ing adventure game elements, as well. As I paddled back out to the lineup, I overhcard a couple of guys arguing about Wolfenstein 3D. One guy said it was proof of the computer's superiority over the Super Nintendo system. He insisted that they Logitech's CyterMan Input Device couldn't possibly put their 3-D engine on a SNES without that FX chip and, even then, it would be doubtful. I chuckled.

"GE CASTER The Power to Change Metamorphosis is the Shadowcaster's Strength... And his Achilles' Heel. s the Shadowcaster, you take on many forms in the battle for survival. You're the resourceful human adventurer, the fierce, six-limbed cat, the versatile, flying dragon and others. But change comes at a price. In one form, you're quick and agile, but small and fragile. In another, you're a nearly indestructible giant, but ponderous and slow. You alter shapes at will and each form unleashes new powers and reveals new vulnerabilities. The pace never falters in Shadowcaster, the unique new point-ofview action adventure from ORIGIN. You race through corridors lined with pulsing lights, and into chambers covered with sculpted faces in this smooth-scrolling, fun-filled odyssey. You discover magic, but you won't need to mix reagents or memorize spells. You weave your way through dungeons, caverns, castles and caves, but you won't have time to linger the powerful and wicked lurk at every turn, just waiting for the chance to draw first blood. In the final battle, you challenge a being with powers that match (or surpass!) your own and the irresistable force meets the immovable object. Actual screens may vary. ORIGIN We create worlds.
