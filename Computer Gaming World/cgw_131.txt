"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD through the most important critical approbation of all in a capitalistic society-the dollar rating. Debundling simply doesn't fuel further development. On the business and productivity software side, the problem is mitigated by the fact that special (\"crippled\") versions of the programs are usually bundled with the hardware. If the consumer wants the \"full\" version of the program, they have to buy it from the publisher at a reduced, but still profitable price. In that sense, the bundling deal is something like shareware. It works for everyone. On the game side, the hardware manufacturers do not want \"crippled\" versions. They want the entire game or nothing. So, publishers have to decide whether the large volume at limited income per unit is worth the cannibalization due to unbundled rip-offs or not. Some companies, like Mindscape, do not believe there is any cannibalization of retail sales and plan to continue making lots of bundling deals, in spite of unbundling. Others, like Trilobyte (kings of bundling during the launch of THE 7TH GUEST) are opting for retail distribution of limited editions of The IITH HOUR (with discount coupons for purchasing the full game inside the jewel case) because they believe there is cannibalization in bundling. Others, like Interplay, Maxis and Spectrum HoloByte are joining forces with SPA counsel Mark Traphagen to encourage federal intervention against \"debundlers.\" What's an honest gamer to do? I think an honest gamer should avoid buying debundled software, even if it comes from one of our advertisers. I've seen software piracy hurt publishers and computer platforms (Atari's ST is the most dramatic case). I believe debundling has the same potential.

Our purview will span the history of flight, from the first World War, to the Second, and on through the modern era, focusing on simulations that are currently available in one form or another. We'll also take some quick glimpses at the simulations that will be released over the next few months. The games we'll look at can operate on three levels. All of the games allow you to challenge the computer artificial intelligence provided by the game designers. In this basic mode you square off against a computer programmer's idea of an enemy lier. The next level allows you to link with another fighter pilot via modem and pit your skills against a human opponent. Lastly, there are opportunities to play against multiple human opponents via on-line services or networks.

These games are easy to play and don't take much time to learn. If you have played one, you have played them all. The artwork changes but the game play and the artificial intelligence don't. The level of performance realism here is at the lowest acceptable level, but it is acceptable. All of the primary flight control (elevator, aileron, and rudder) inputs work; spins, blackouts and \"wounding\" are modeled; effects and recovery from these problems generally follow real-world experiences. With a little more realistic flight modeling these games could be awesome. The graphics are good but you always know you are looking at a drawing of an aircraft. The cockpit interior art is minimal and drab; it does not induce a feeling of \"being there.\" Enemy artificial intelligence is not too good; again, increasing the enemy ability to \"Expert\" seems only to make their gunnery capabilities phenomenal.

BLIPS ON THE RADAR HEAD-TO-HEAD AIR WARRIOR AIR WARRIOR'S modem hook ups are as smooth as silk. Unfortunately, there is only one basic mission—you versus your opponent in any of a number of types of aircraft. Still, you'll never have the same fight twice since you are now dealing with a human opponent. You can dogfight in A-26 bombers if you choose, you can vary the gas loads to improve performance; you can play Half Time or Real Time. You will find getting a kill significantly tougher in Real Time, since you can't waste ammo and things happen twice as fast as they do in HT. The poor blackout model and spin model don't help either. This area is where the game begins to grow addictive, however. Don't say we didn't warn you. FLIGHT UNLIMITED BY LOOKING GLASS TECHNOLOGIES If anything, the FUGHT UNLIMITED aerobatics simulator will be the ultimate show off piece for your new Pentium. This baby hogs computing power, but the power is put to excellent use. The graphics are simply unbelievable-we're certain you've never seen anything like it on a PC-and the flight modeling is groundbreaking, without question. As you scroll around the 3-D air base (remember, these are the guys who created ULTIMA UNDERWORLD and System SHOCK) you'll be able to select from five aerobatic aircraft (Grob 103A, Sukhoi Su31, Pitts Special S-2B. Bellanca Decathlon, and Extra 300S) and choose to take part in 30 interactive flight lessons, ranging from basic flight instruction to insane aerobatic stunts. Pilots who love to loop around the skies of FLIGHT SIMULATOR 5 will go bananas for this stuff, but those who learned to fly with their index fingers on a joystick trigger, well, they might get a little edgy after the wow-power wears off. If anything, you should at least take a look at this product, because you'll be looking at the future of simulations. E HEAD-TO-HEAD FALCON The FALCON/MIG/HORNET series also has multiplayer games for up to six players on a network or two players on a modem connection. Two-player games can be duels or allied games. The network allows duels, multi-player allied games, or multi-player opponent games. This is where the excitement really begins! While we were unable to sample the network warfare, the dueling and allied games via modem are a blast, although you are again both fighting a computer in the allied mode. Good wing work is still a powerful reward. Multiplayer FALCON can easily become an addictive hobby. FALCON \"ladder\" tournaments can be found on the various on-line services, allowing you to fight opponents of varying skill levels. Be advised, though; if you load and play this on your network at the office you might quickly join the ranks of the unemployed! S. MARINE FIGHTERS BY ELECTRONIC ARTS A regional conflict between the Ukraine, Russia, Japan and U.S. is the setting for this add-on disk to the popular U.S. Navy Fighters.

"EQUIPMENT CHECK For most of these games you need top-line equipment to get maximal enjoyment. We used Dell 486/66 machines, 16 Megs of RAM, 450 Meg Hard Drives, Viper VLB video cards with 17 inch monitors and US Robotics 14.4 modems. These machines turned in impressive performances on memory hungry games. Frame rates on Air WARRIOR were in the upper thirties with all options on. This is good in anyone's book. All this speed and memory provides smooth flowing graphics and quick response to inputs. MicroProse's 1942: THE PACIFIC AIR WAR was tough to handle even for our SuperDells. Frame rate slowed noticeably during multi-plane dog. fights. Interestingly enough, these machines handied U.S. Navy FIGHTERS very well if we turned the ground textures off. This game has a reputation for bogging down the most capable machines; rumor 'has it that the 16 megs of RAM may have helped the most. HEAD-TOHEAD 1942 In MicroProse's 1942: THE PACIFIC AIR WAR you can fight headto-head against one of your friends, or team up against the computer's Al. If you choose to play against the computer there are canned missions to run or you may build your own using the mission builder. You'll be limited to a total of six planes in the scenario. MicroProse has included a really nice touch that other designers should think about when considering modem play: a pause feature that can be initiated by either player. When the pizza delivery man comes to the door it's nice to be able to answer knowing that your buddy is not saddling up on your six. We enjoyed playing 1942 in the modem play mode far more than the regular game. It seems we also prefer a challenging duel more than cooperation against a common enemy. Skip the canned mission, let's duel! FALCON 4 BY SPECTRUM HOLOBYTE Ah, yes, the one we're all waiting for. The Falcon series of sims has always led the pack in realism, multiplayer options, and engrossing gameplay, and now we're all waiting to see how high Spectrum will raise the standard this time around. Spectrum is promising the world in FALCON 4: a complete Al-driven virtual battlefield that runs in real time, never pausing for the player, a 3-D rendered virtual airbase where players will attend briefings and talk to fellow pilots in their wing; a completely accurate simulation of cockpit instrumentation, and an Al that will tailor the difficulty of the simulation to the player's level of expertise. Is Spectrum writing a check they can't cash? We certainly hope not. But we're certainly not counting on seeing this one for quite a while. Word has it that the FALCON 4 project has been on hold while the company finishes STAR TREK: TNG and Top Guy, so 1996 may even be too optimistic of a ship date. G TOP GUN BY SPECTRUM HOLOBYTE Top Gun is Spectrum's answer to Origin's STRIKE COMMANDER. It's a story-based simulation that will use full-motion video clips from the 1986 movie of the same name to move a plot along. The graphics appear to be somewhere near the realm of U.S. Navy Fighters, and the instrumentation and flight modeling will be suited to the newbie with that \"need for speed.\" Basically, Spectrum views Top Gun as a fast, fun, and exciting complement to its more serious simulations something you can hop in and play without reading the fine print of a 400page manual. BBD CO-OPERATIVE FLIGHT SIMULATOR 5.0/5.1 Microsoft has modem capability built into FLIGHT SIMULATOR 5.0 and 5.1. Frankly, we don't think anyone will use it very often. There is not much you can do in the dual player mode other than fly in formation. While there is much to be said for a pilot's satisfaction in just being a good leader or good wingman, it loses something on the small screen. You can talk to the other player as you tour the countryside in perfect formation or play \"follow the leader.\" We found ourselves still trying to dogfight without the guns. Make a head-on pass at co-altitude and when you pass abeam, the fight is on. The winner is the first guy to get on the other's six and stay there for a while. This game needs guns! FIGHTER DUEL 2 BY JAEGER SOFTWARE The developers at Jaeger Software were once revered as demigods in the Amiga flight sim community. Their FIGHTER DUEL and FIGHTER DUEL Pro for the Amiga were ground-breaking simulations in terms of flight modeling, frame rate, and modem play. Now, the Jaeger team has set their sights on the PC community with their FIGHTER DUEL 2. The focus, as always with Jaeger, is on realistic flight modeling and a blazing frame rate, in addition to multiplayer capabilities. Although the terrain and WWII aircraft graphics won't be anything to challenge the Big Bays, the frame rate could possibly be the fastest in the pack. Look for this one this summer. 50 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1995 "

"Level 3: on-line combat The Ultimate Challenge When you get red-headed stepchild in modem play tired of whipping there is the ultimate challenge: on-line your brother like a play. Unfortunately there are only two places to go for this pure excitement at this time. Fortunately, one of them is very good indeed, and another is on the way. JETFIGHTER III BY MISSION STUDIOS The latest installment in the Jetfighter line looks to be a vast improvement over previous versions. The sim will include the updated models of three jet craft the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet, and the F-22 Lightning II. Graphically, we'll see expansive, detailed terrain, texture-mapped aircraft and carriers, and haze, fog, and transparency effects. In keeping with current sim trends, JETFIGHTER III will also have a 3-D modeled aircraft carrier interior in which players can walk around and select mission options. The combat scenario will pit Argentina against Chile, with the player taking part in the UN's attempt to settle the differences. Be watching the skies in early July RED BARON ON-LINE The Imagination Network provides a place to play Dynamix's RED BARON WWI flight sim on-line. We found the players to be a friendly, helpful group, and eager to welcome newcomers. You will find all levels of talent here, from rookies to truly skilled aces. We had our shorts shot off several times, a totally humbling experience for the world's greatest pilots. Up to four pilots can participate at one time, and realism levels are adjustable pretty much as they are in the off-line game. When you play, you will get ten minutes or three lives to do all the damage you can to the bad guys. The mission is al times. On busy nights these problems drove us crazy. I tactical knowledge in the player base, and the Kesmai folks allow them plenty of input. These air battles are very interesting and much effort is made to provide as much realism as possible. the skill level in AIR WARRIOR ranges from beginning rookies to very expert aces and everything in between The RT pilots tend to look down on the HT pilots as a lesser breed, but the top pilots in either arena usually do well in any flying game. The prevailing sentiment is \"play the one you like to play—after all, it's your money.\" HT is an easier game to kill and get killed in. RT is more demanding and the kills for rookies are fewer and farther between, so savor them. Both games are incredible fun! CONTROL YOURSELF! ACES OVER THE WIRE \"Warping\" effects can make gunnery tricky in INN's RED BARON. AIR WARRIOR ON-LINE Mostly, it drove us to Kesmai's Air WARRIOR. This is where we found true happiness. If you become addicted, you will start spending most of your spare time and piles of your not so spare cash to participate. Three services currently offer access to AIR WARRIOR: GEnie, Delphi and CRIS. On-line Air WARRIOR is the raison d'être for the stand-alone game-it is why you spend hours sharpening your skills off-line. Here you can fly in an arena with 60 other pilots divided up amongst three generic countries. You can \"talk\" to and coordinate with your fellow countrymen and your enemies. You may choose to fly the heavies to bomb enemy ground targets and ships, fly fighter-bombers, or just fly a fighter. Eight players can man a B-17 and fly a mission together using the gunner positions. Groups of players form squadrons and fly together on regularly scheduled squad nights. There are three arenas: Half Time, Real Time and Scenarios. HT and RT characteristics were described previously but scenarios are worthy of special mention. Scenarios are organized every so often to accurately recreate an actual air battle of W.W.II. They are flown repetitively for a few sessions and then work begins on a new one. As this is being written, play continues in \"Stalingrad, Into The Cauldron,\" a HT scenario portraying the Luftwaffe's attempt to resupply the Sixth Army trapped in the city of Stalingrad. The RT enthusiasts are working on \"Kursk: Full Metal Depends,\" recreating the air battles that went on above one of the biggest tank battles on record. Generally speaking, the scenarios are designed, planned and executed by AIR WARRIOR players. There is a tremendous depth of historical and ways the same, dogfighting with two to four players in any combination. If you kill all the enemy three times, you may have some time left to nail a few observation balloons for extra points. We have to emphasize the \"when you play\" part of this. You will find yourself wasting huge amounts of time, at $3.50 an hour, looking for an opponent, setting up a game, and waiting for a free \"arena\" to play in. Every \"game room\" has three arenas that can hold up to four players, and that's not enough. On top of the waiting, we had many \"warps\" where aircraft suddenly and radically change location, making gunnery a little tough. We were also completely dumped out of the INN system several If you want to be good at these games, you're going to need a few good input devices. We tried out Thrustmaster's full set-up; a programmable MARK II WEAPONS CONTROL SYSTEM, a Mark II FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM, the new F-16 FUGHT CONTROL SYSTEM and a set of Rudder Pedals. They definitely improve your game by simplifying the use of controls and making it easier to utilize the views. This ease of viewing is absolutely key to success in computer air combat. Thrustmaster has a reputation for state of the art products and we agree. The F16 FLCS is especially awesome. The Weapons Control System worked great there is nothing better than a stick in one hand and a throttle in the other. The WCS also allows you even more buttons to control yet more flight functions. All of these buttons are fully programmable, so you can set up your equipment as you choose or download TM supplied function programs for most games. The Rudder Pedals completed the \"home i 52 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  JUNE 1995 "

In addition, Microsoft is supporting General MIDI in the MIDI mapper, allowing for a more standard approach to MIDI files. The Game SDK has a low level API called DirectSound that is compatible ON SCREEN, CAPTAIN This top-secret shot of Origin's PRIVATEER II, still under development, proves that a high-end game can be created as a native WINDOWS 95 application. \"I think WINDOWS 95 will be the platform on the PC for games and other software, in all respects.

Digital Video: For good or bad, the use of digital video is becoming increasingly popular. The technology demands enormous bandwidth and CPU processing power, but Microsoft and Intel have jointly developed a device driver interface known as DCI (Display Control Interface). DCI delivers improved video playback, resulting in a larger, smoother image. Microsoft will also be adding MPEG support to its current stable of video CODECs (COmpressor-DECompressor-software that allows digital video files to be compressed into relatively small files, then decompressed on the fly during playback).

At one point, you will be granted a wish; one of the choices is a magical weapon and armor (body armor and helm). If the troll is in the first party position, you will receive only the body armor; the other two items are lost. Should you have the troll with you, and you want the gear, be certain he is in some other position. Overall, STONE PROPHET is a big step up from the disappointments of MENZOBERRANZAN and WAKE OF THE RAVAGER. The ability to roam freely over the desert and explore is a welcome relief from playing in linear, lockstep fashion. Meaningful interactions with characters are good to see. The change to magic use in combat is a definite plus, as is the addition of those handy function keys. There are still weaknesses, but it does look like Dream Forge is getting its act together here, and the series is certainly improving. The next one should really be something to see. In the meantime, STONE PROPHET is a worthy quest, especially in these times when role-playing quests are so few and far between CAVILA CAL.

"REVIEW REVIEW : Chairman Of The Borg Meat Meets Metal In Origin's \"Interactive Movie,\" BIOFORGE by Charles Ardai TOFORGE WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO BE THE FIRST IN ORIGIN'S NEW LINE OF \"INTERACTIVE movies,\" but one thing after another kept pushing back its release. In the end, WING COMMANDER III found its way into stores first. This is just as well, as far as Origin is concerned. WING COMMANDER III is a great game and has widely been heralded as a new benchmark for interactive cinema. Had BioFORGE been released first, the line would have gotten off to a rockier start. No one can call BIOFORGE a bad game. It is an accomplished piece of work, as cinematic as you could want, and as interactive too for that matter. With its handsomely rendered 3-D environments and its fully controllable main character, BioFORGE is a good deal more interactive than WING COMMANDER.

Who you turn out to be depends on several choices you've made during the game, mostly whether to let other characters live or die. But none of your possible identities are significant in the slightest, so it's hard to ON A KILLING MOON All the way to the end, the game holds the question \"Who are you?» over your care about the outcome. in my case, I found out that I was \"Popul Marko,\" a cybernetic limbs expert on Dr. Mastaba's team who had volunteered to be operated on.

This anti-climactic handling of one of the most important elements of the game's storyline is typical of BIOFORGE, and it ties back in with my initial reaction. I can live with bad dialogue in a computer game; you can have fun with a game that includes lines like, \"Eat light, you stupid machinel,\" \"Insolent dog!\" and \"That was for my men, you grotesque son of a bitch!\" We are safely in monster movie territory when Dr. Mastaba purrs, «I need you here to perform...an experiment.

CGW Intelligence has discovered that Bob Carter, founder of Thrustmaster, has started another company, Military Simulations, Inc., because \"no one has ever done a flight simulator right.\" With a long list of aerospace credentials (Boeing, McDonnel Douglas, Lockheed, etc.) in hand, Carter has set out to create FIGHTING FALCON: BACK TO BAGHDAD. The flight model physics are being developed by a Detroit-based company that does work for the U.S. military (they're using declassified stuff for this game, of course) and the graphics are being done in the UK using Renderware. FIGHTING FALCON will feature texture-mapped images moving at a very fast frame rate, but will require the fastest Pentium you can get. Look for the roll-out in the third quarter of 95. \"The psychology is different, it's just an unbelievable notch above the single-player version,\" Levesque says. Unfortunately, most of us don't have easy access to a local area network packed with competition-crazed sim fans. Many simulations have offered modem options, but only against a single player.

In fact, I walked around the ship for some time before realizing that the hot keys are the best way to move between the various command screens, all of which are functional but rather plain.

I had no the sound off and the graphics ignored, clue where the attack had come from, or since these detract from gameplay more even if it was a missile or a torpedo hit. than they enhance it. The lack of information extends to the DON'T ABANDON SHIP JUST YET Underneath all of these problems, somewhat surprisingly, lies a creative game. The basic model used by USS TICONDEROGA to replicate modern naval combat, while by no means perfect, is interesting. Task forces must be properly managed and ships placed to take advantage of their respective abilities and weapons systems. Air and submarine operations are important in some scenarios, while others focus more on the unique abilities of the Ticonderoga itself. The real game, though, lies in the command screens. You may view the situation and issue orders from a series of command screens divided by the type of platform, i.e. air, surface and subsurface. In WHAT DOES THIS BUTTON DO: A larger problem with USS TICONDEROGA is the truly appalling state of the game's documentation. Almost nothing is explained adequately. The manual is poorly organized, laden with jargon, and mostly useless. I was able to play the game due to my background knowledge, but gamers less familiar with naval tactics and modern ship platforms will find it extremely frustrating. Some weapons systems and platforms are explained superficially, and many are missing altogether. Tactics and strategy are discussed at a general level, but there is almost no connection between the information provided (much of it highly technical) and actual gameplay. The information gap is not limited to the manual, as the mission objectives for QUICK FLICKS GALORE Some of the more interesting many scenarios are sketchy and noncinematic cuts involve Scud missile launchers, specific.

WWII aficionados take heed: WORLD IN Flames is the definitive simulation of the entire war, covering every area of the world in which it was fought, and it's a natural for translation to the computer. * The WARLORDS saga continues with WARLORDS II DELUXE, probably out by the Fall of this year. The scuttlebutt is that we might see 256-color, network (turn-based) game play, and enhanced scenarios (60 of 'em, including the original 30 from Warlords || and the scenario builder). This version will be backwards-compatible with other WARLORDS II SCENARIO BUILDER scenarios and should be CD-ROM only. * Speaking of WARLORDS II scenarios, our creative gamer of the month award goes to Perry Wood. Perry has designed two interesting ancient Roman scenarios for WARLORDS II: \"Severus-Britain 196 AD\", featuring Severus, Albinus, Legio VI, Maetae, Caledonii, Saxons, Olaid, and Mamu, and \"Who Will Be Caesar?\", a 44 BC postassassination scenario starring Octavian, Antony, M. Brutus, D. Brutus, Cleopatra, Lepidus, Sextus Pompey, and those wild and crazy Germans. You can find these scenarios on the CompuServe Gamer's Forum in the Wargames library. * Keith Zabaloui at Atomic Games reports that BEYOND SQUAD LEADER is in alpha testing. Interestingly, Apple Computer has taken a \"special interest\" in the project. Atomic and a handful of other software developers were recently invited to a special hands-on work. shop during which Apple programmers worked with them to improve the performance of the PowerPC versions of their products. Keith reports that, in Atomic's case, Apple managed to quadruple the speed of their graphics. * Although Jim Rose has left Avalon Hill, he has not left gaming. Jim's new company, TalonSoft, should be releasing its first game in a new series, BATTLEGROUND: ARDENNES, later this year. This series will feature WWII platoon/company level action at 250 meters per hex (e.g., PANZERBLITZ scale). They will be Windows-based, CD-ROM only products with about 15 to 20 scenarios from each campaign. The series is aiming for a PANZER GENERAL-like balance between hard-core, historical wargames and more casual strategy games, and will feature plenty of video and sound. A second series at this same scale on the Civil War is slated for next year. * Speaking of TalonSoft, they're looking for good programming/development teams. For more information call Jim Rose at (410) 821-7282. * MicroProse's MACHIAVELLI: THE PRINCE, released at press time, is a remake of QQP's MERCHANT PRINCE. The MicroProse version is supposed to have: improved graphics and sound, warehousing of goods, variable demand levels, \"Wait\" orders on trade routes so that full cargoes set sail, more emphasis on politics and the Church, and smarter computer opponents. 154 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD .

Put some more clothes on I'm freezing Quit From a technological standpoint, don't expect SUPERHER to fully recharge your superpowers. Though it's competent, portrays its superhero theme well, and offers musical accompaniment that contributes positively to the game's atmosphere, graphics are a mixed lot that could stand significant improvement. There are also bugs in the game, which is an early version (1.0). On several occasions, my system locked entirely, some of the text was cut off or missing in a couple of encounters, and one scene repeatedly locked itself in a continual loop (though it could be avoided, as the scene was not necessary for successful completion of the game). In other words, it doesn't take X-ray vision to discover that SUPERHER needs some additional work. Still, none of the problems were severe enough to cause me to quit playing, and they only reduced my enjoyment slightly. Some additional bug stomping and some professional graphics could really make this game...well, super good. If you'd like a unique change of pace in your gaming and don't mind a long download (just over 2MB of data), SUPERHER will certainly deliver.

"UNDER THE HOOD Modem Operandi THOMAK Tips For Buying A Modem And Getting The Blinking Thing To Work by Mike Weksler NE THING EVERYONE SEEMS TO FORGET WITH ALL THE \"INFOHIGHWAY\" HYPE IN THE GENERAL media is our relatively archaic means of accessing this universe of data and coolness-the modem. When the \"Father of Cyberpunk\" William Gibson wrote Neuromancer, he imagined \"jacking in\" to \"cyberspace\" would be something like this: He closed his eyes. Found the ridged face of the power stud. And in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiling in from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking past him like film compiled from random frames.

This new chip is manufactured using a .35 micron process, which means that the chip is smaller-half the size of the current .6 micron Pentiums and about one-quarter the size of the early .8 micron Pentium processors. So if you need that extra horsepower, it's definitely worth a look. However, at a distributor cost of $935 in large quantities, most people upgrading may opt for a Pentium 90MHz or 100MHz-based machine until the price falls. Additionally, sources at Intel say that the 150MHz Pentium processor and the P6 are due later this year. For more information, call (800) 628-8686. chessboard extending to infinity...
