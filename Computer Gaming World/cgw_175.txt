"WILSON Back to the Future EDITORIAL favorite games to give to their friends and work associates. for a while, it looked like the DVD would come along in time to save the industry from having to use traditional forms of copy pro tection. Yet, the DVD hasn't pene. trated as fast as needed. Some of us warned the industry that, while DVDs wouldn't take quite as long to penetrate the market as CD-ROM drives took, it would still take a year or so longer than most projections. We were wrong. It's taking at least a year longer than our conservative projections. This means that the DVD won't solve the problem. But the problem is worsening. Recently in Europe a wargame from a small company outsold a major release from one of Europe's biggest publishers by more than a 3-to-1 ratio. Both games were released in the same time period and both dealt with subjects that would appeal to the wargamer. Indeed, the major release was about WWII, meaning that the \"Nazis, NATO, and Nukes\" credo (i.e., that only WWII, modern warfare, and nuclear war scenarios sell) should have given it an advantage over the medieval era wargame. The Wargame merely sold numbers worthy of a successful game in the small wargaming niche. The wargame-related title from the large publisher sold a mere fraction of the wargame's numbers after all of the returns were factored in. The wargame was copy protected. The major release was not. European retailers believe that they were victimized by the lack of Ye Olde Copy Protection Will Return t the risk of turning checks and nagging messages myself into a pariah, let about piracy. Copy protection was a hassle for dark ages of copy pro everyone, and it didn't solve the tection will soon be with problem. Hackers could still break us once more. Those of the protection schemes. Systems you who are new to the like the Atari ST and the Amiga hobby may be horrified eventually succumbed to the to discover that, in the bad old onslaught of piracy as worldwide days, gamers often couldn't start a unit sales dropped into the low game until they had answered one thousands—and sometimes, to three questions—by looking up answers in the manual and typing in the correct answers. Some may not remember the glorious days when you could start a game without assistance from a code-wheel, but might have to look up vital information and type it in while in the midst of your game. For example, to get Rocket Ranger from Egypt to the United States, you had to use the code-wheel to get the mixture just right and type it in or you would run out of fuel and fall to your demise in the mid-Atlantic. With WORLD TOUR GOLF, you could play a few holes on each course but needed to type in code-wheel data to open up the full courses. hundreds.

They are telling European publishers that they will not accept nonprotected games in the future. They are also hinting that they will not handle European SKUs (Shelf Keeping Units) of U.S. titles if the U.S. SKUs aren't protected even if the European SKUs are protected. Why? Because they will lose sales to the gray market and direct sales if the European units are protected and the U.S. units are not. This means that European piracy is going to affect all of us. At least until the DVD becomes the new storage standard, we're going to be faced with the bad old days of copy protection once again.

"Campaign Promises Mission Design Can Make or Break a Sim nec tamen habile dynamic campaigns are the ultimate in \"living\" battle environments. But a scripted mission structure can work as well, offering a human design touch that can flesh out a mission and make it even more believable and unique than an algorithmically generated battle. The biggest complaint about scripted missions is that they're predictable and, upon replay, feel any gamers consider the dynamic campaign—where missions are algorithmically generated depending on the results of previous combat results--as the Holy Grail of flight simulation. After all, dynamic campaigns ensure that you'll never fly the same mission twice. The problem here is that previous dynamic campaign generators have created missions which, although unique, so closely resemble previous missions that they quickly grew repetitive. So much so that these sims didn't offer much more long-term gameplay than sims with scripted missions. A notable exception is LONGBOW 2. If certain conditions occurred, the sim would trigger a prescripted mission that featured details and plot twists unavailable in dynamic missions. This is perhaps the current best compromise since we're a long way from the dynamic campaign system that will be able to generate atypical mis sions, such as shooting down Admiral Yamamoto or taking out a terrorist enclave game, they should keep the follow5) Make a living battle enviing points in mind when designing ronment.

This time around the enemy defenses shouldn't arrive at the same time and place as in the previous mission (see #1), and any defenses destroyed on the first attempt should remain disabled. Dynamic or Scripted? What's the most important ele. ment of mission creation? Andy Hollis, LONGBOW 2's producer, says \"You have to make a compelling mission environment in which to play the game: enemies that work together to defeat you, unexpected subtleties, and plausible reactions to anything the player does.\" Add replayability to that formula, and you have a setup that should make most sim pilots happy. The entire war doesn't have to be generated dynamically. After all, how often do the actions of a single pilot-even over the course of a year-truly affect the outcome of a war? There's no denying that like puzzles. Playing the same miss ion a second time, with enemy aircraft appearing at the same time, in the same place, ruins your suspension of disbelief. The space sim X-WING is a perfect example of this-not only are the missions identical each time you play, but there's generally only one method for successfully accomplishing miss ion goals. Dynamic campaigns are a solution, but they take massive amounts of development resources. Companies can't realistically incorporate a dynamic campaign in every sim they create. 4) Similarly, failing a mission shouldn't mean you'll have to replay it over and over again until you get it right. There should certainly be consequences—put the player on a mission track where the enemy is advancing or force him to fly future missions with fewer wingmen because of loss of pilots or aircraft. Give the option to refly a mission, but allow those players who are more interested in role-playing as a pilot the chance to suffer the loss and move on—as would happen in real life. percentage, such as \"wipe out 75 percent of enemy air assets,\" or base success on the enemy not achieving its own goals. It's not about whether a campaign is dynamic or scripted, it's about whether the campaign is believable. Avid sim pilot Robin Lee perhaps puts it best: \"I view mission generation and campaign dynamics in the same light as I view sausage production; I don't really want to inquire too closely into the details of either. The illusion that I want to maintain is that missions are generated by a real operations staff reacting to unpredictable events, not by a software campaign engine or by selection from a fixed database of mission scripts. And like sausages, the worst imaginable case is when a mission reveals obvious hints about its origin.\" CGW Do It Right If designers take a scripted setup and add certain levels of randomness, scripted missions can maintain much of the \"reality\" of a dynamic campaign. If designers can't put a dynamic campaign in a 24 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD FEBRUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

TalonSoft Notable Titles: BATTLEGROUND SERIES OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR WEST FRONT www.talonsoft.com Big Time Software ack in 1994, tucked away in a small corner well off the main show floor at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was a small offshoot of edutainment maven Davidson called Blizzard, showing off its single, modest game title. When former strategy wargame editor Alan Emrich and I got our first demo of WARCRAFT in that tiny little room—from Alan Adham, the president of the company, no less—we were hooked. And I knew, deep down, that this charming little upstart of a company would be a big player in the industry. Though, never in my wildest dreams could I have surmised that it would produce three million-unit sellers in a row. But even while the quality of Blizzard's games is still quite high, you simply can't count them as an independent any more: Like it or not, our friends in Irvine are part of the CUC behemoth. The strain of that relationship, despite Monolith Productions DOLITO Notable Titles: SHOGO BLOOD 2 www.lith.com Of all the independents, Monolith has the best chance of rising above the crowd with its wonderful 3D engine, LithTech. Everyone in the company, from the PR folks to the CEO, seems to be a gamer—what an unusual concept in this industry!

So far, these folks have learned from their mistakes; keep your fingers crossed. HPS Simulations Incredible Simulations tell. If you want evidence, look at the talent that has left Blizzard, as well as the cancellation of WARCRAFT ADVENTURES, and feel free to advance your own conspiracy theories. Where are all of today's independents? There are fewer of them, and while they're more niche-oriented than in years past, they're still relevant. If for one minute you doubt this, ask yourself where the current 3D-shooter craze would be if another small maver ick, id Software, hadn't reinvented the genre with WOLFENSTEIN 3D and DOOM. The following, then, is a list of the last of the true independentsthose companies that sometimes exasperate us but almost always challenge and entertain us. May When Jim Rose felt stifled running the computer division at Avalon Hill, he left to form his own wargame company. While it has at times used outside distributors, TalonSoft has recently managed to go completely independent, and the company stays successful by giving its fans what they want the best combination of realism, graphics, and playability in the business. Not only did every game in the BATTLEGROUND series, for example, improve on the last, but TalonSoft went to the trouble of retrofitting those enhancements on the entire line of games. While TalonSoft may have a reputation as a group of insane workaholics, the formula seems to work. The bloom's still on the rose since were stacem.

That HPS has formed an Moylan is no longer developing games for Avalon Hill, it will be interesting to see how well Big Time does in the big leagues. Moylan plans to release COMBAT MISSION—the game formerly known as ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER, now possessing no trademarked information from that title--and market it himself. Since realistic and playable turn-based WWII squad-level 3D games are not something you boot up every day, I think he's got a shot.

"COMPUTER GAMING LETTER The 11 PC Game Magazine W ORLD PUBLISHER Lee Uniacke EDITORIAL Canadian Joke Butt Hugh Jass? What is he, an idiot? (Letters, December '98.) I am a Canadian-half-Swede, half-Danish—and a blonde. When I saw the first ad for GLOBAL DOMINATION (\"Bad day? Take it out on Canada\"), I thought it was funny. Then I saw the ad, \"Stood up by a blonde? Carpet bomb Sweden.\" I was rolling: The game was calling to me!!! Some people may have been insulted by the ad, but people are more likely to write to complain than praise, so I think there are a lot more people who liked it. And since I don't think you guys get enough praise, I'd like to say good job guys! Keep it up. Katherine Larsen Native of Toronto Via the Internet Half-Swedish, half-Danish gamer babe? Whoa.

I'd just like to say, man, that guy that called himself Hugh Jass is a total knob. That whole letter complaining about the GLOBAL DOMINATION ad was such a wussy thing to do. I'm a proud Canadian and I don't find it offensive. Sure, I read it and said, \"Hey, what's the big idea?\" but, obviously it's a joke. We canucks sock it to the yanks just the same and there's no need to cry about it. Now I've met some not-so-intelligent Americans in my day and could think up plenty of ads to joke about them, but I'm sure everyone's met a canuck, idiot enough to mock, and decided to do so. A perfect example? The GLOBAL DOMINATION ad. I apologize on behalf of all Canadians for such a weak, girlish shadow of a man they call Hugh Jass. The only way I can explain it is that he's Canadien, not Canadian. Silly Frenchies, will they ever learn? Tombini Jones Via the Internet Johnny's Evil Twin Discovered I knew there was something strange about the New Jersey Devils sports writer in The Record, a large New Jersey newspaper. Well, besides naturally despising this guy for being a New Jersey Devil fan (I'm a New York Ranger fan), I knew there was something else about the way he looked. Then, I realized it—the guy looks like Johnny Wilson! Could it be his evil twin (any Devil fan must be evil) or could it be that: 1. Both use the same barber? 2. Both don't believe in shaving? 3. Both use the same optometrist? Marc H.

Ramaley, Paul Somerson, Mark Van Name, Sam Whitmore Corrections Fan First, let me congratulate CGW for being the best gaming magazine throughout 1998. Every part of the mag is getting bigger and better, except the part I like most, the Dep't. Of Corrections. The first thing I check out is the Dep't. Of Corrections to have a good laugh before I start reading the mag from the beginning. So could you please make more silly mistakes so that I can have a good laugh? I hate to say it, but I love my room more than CGW (don't sigh). So when I buy CGW every month I am left with little money to decorate my room. The only effective way to decorate my room is via the poster included in CGW.So could you please urge and encourage the developers to include posters of their most recent games in CGW? I know it will be hard but I really want to see giant poster of Lurker from BROOD WAR lurking in CGW in the near future. P.S. I don't want to be in distress for not able to decorate my beloved room. :( Damsel Via the Internet to oranges. The ultimate objectives of the two camps is fundamentally different. The console game developers intend to build companies that will last for decades, even generations, as a result of which they will enjoy great profits. The PC game developers intend to enjoy great profits, and don't care much what they need to do to get them. There is no doubt as to the abysmal quality of most PC games, but railing about it will not change the PC developers attitude. It is the intentional use of high-pressure schedules and minimal investments that result in low overhead and high profit margins. We need to be honest with ourselves. The PC games industry is nothing short of a getrich-quick scam. To expect the hucksters, card sharps and other crooks to suddenly change their methods in the midst of so much income is not realistic. Instead, we should be educating the public on how to get their money back on a bad game, or even how not to buy one in the first place. Attacking the developers as the source of all this PC-game drivel is futile. Stem the demand for drivel, and then we will see true improvement.

"READ.ME THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Edited by ken_brownazd.com I On the Storm Latest Departures At Ion Storm Raise More Questions Everyone's asking if John Romero's DAIKATANA will ever ship. The river of former lon Storm employees continues to rise. Another dozen development people resigned in November, raising the total number of lon deserters to about 60. The departures renewed speculation of deep divisions within the 54th floor penthouse offices of lon's Dallas headquarters. Ion icon John Romero sought to quell rumors by posting a plan file saying that the former employees had completed their role, and he thanked them for their contributions. Ion CEO Todd Porter responded to numerous questions and allegations in an internal memo and in an online interview on GameSpot. As expected the lon founders and former employees offer different reasons behind all the departures. The most recent departures-eight members of the DAIKATANA and ANACHRONOX teamsresigned to form their own development start-up (see related story on this page). Corrinne Yu, previously director of advanced technology at lon Storm, resigned to join 3D Realms as the developer's lead technology programmer. Most of the other former lon members refused to comment on the record, but some spoke on the condition of anonymity. They maintain that the two biggest reasons so many have left are the delays in shipping DAIKATANA and a rather strong dislike of CEO Todd Porter Romero, lon's chairman, brushes off the criticism as par for the course in such a high-profile development startup. He says, \"When you staff up with a large number of employees at the formation of a company, those employees feel as though they have some kind of ownership stake in the company and should have the power to make company decisions. That is not the case and over time, when the company changed, they didn't change and that in turn embittered them. \"Any employees that we hired a year or so after the formation of the company,\" Romero continues, \"are very much like normal employees who don't feel that they own the company.\" Given that lon is so closely tied with Eidos Interactive, and that Eidos has invested tens of millions of dollars into the company, both gamers and industry types are watching these developments closely. CGW feels that there is much more to this story, and we are working on bringing you a closer look into the company, its people, and the reasons behind the turmoil in upcoming issues. Stay tuned! -Ken Brown \"Any employees that we hired a year or so after the formation of the company are... like normal employees John Romero KISS Off it didn't take long for the latest group of lon refugees to make their intentions known. They've signed a deal with the Gathering of Developers (G.O.D.) to create a game based on Todd McFarlane's KISS: Psycho Circus comics and action figures series. The new group, Elder Entertainment, comprised of designers, artists, and programmers for merly of lon Storm, will develop the 3D action game blending McFarlane's KISS universe with the likeness of the legendary KISS members and their music. The group had evidently been working on the project, because they even had a nifty Gene Simmons quote ready to go: \"Our shows are a sensory ambush-filled with hard-core rock and roll, cutting-edge technology, awesome effects, and inyour-face action,\" said the leather-clad KISS vocalist Latest Ion Emigrants and bassist. \"We are working with Elder to convey that same raw electric excitement in this game.\" G.O.D. high priest Mike Wilson, speaking far less tongue-in-cheek, said, \"I have wanted to do a KISS game for years. The opportunity to be working with great creative talent and KISS was just too good to be true. Gene and the rest of the band are truly psyched about the possibilities for this game.\" --Ken Brown Develop New KISS Game for G.O.D.

"Hammer and Tongs READ.ME Digital Anvil Finally Reveals The Fruits of Its Labor BUILDING BABYLON 5 o call Digital Anvil secretive is like describing Jim Carrey as \"slightly animated.\" Formed in April 1996, by WING COMMANDER impresario Chris Roberts, Digital Anvil has been toiling away for close to two years without leaking so much as a syllable describing its projects. After lining up a prestigious lineup including Roberts' brother Erin (PRIVATEER, PRIVATEER II: THE DARKENING) and Tony Zurovec (the CRUSADER series), Digital Anvil has been content to work quietly and bide its time. Until now. After finally deciding to lift the Cone of Silence, Digital Anvil revealed its 1999 lineup to game journalists, and we've got to say we like what we see. The first title to hit shelves will probably be CONQUEST: FRONTIER WARS.A spacefaring real-time strategy game, CONQUEST will likely draw comparisons to HOMEWORLD. While both games may share some surface similarities, CONQUEST is closer to STARCRAFT than HOMEWORLD. Detailing an intergalactic struggle between four distinct races, CONQUEST will feature a veritable armada of ship types, all modeled in 3D and sporting all the nifty eye candy gamers have come to expect from hardware-accelerated games. Digital Anvil is promising that each race will have unique unit sets, thus Series Creator Describes New Combat Sim Michael Stracyznski, the creator of Babylon 5 (85) and the follow-on series Crusade, has been closely involved with the design of Sierra FX's BABYLON 5 SPACE COMBAT SIMULATOR. Straczynski took a few minutes to answer some questions about the game. CGW What specific aspects of the BABYLON 5 SPACE COMBAT SIMULATOR have you been actively involved with? Was it mostly storyline suggestions, or did you actually write sections of the game's script as well? JMS I came up with the basic storyline, which goes back and forth in time, when I hit the point where I thought the original storyline presented by Sierra got bogged down and overwrought and ended up having nothing to do with the B5 storyline. They were quick to accept the new storyline and were very excited about it, as it allowed them to do both a strategic and a storyline-based game, which is an unusual combination and hard to accomplish. After I gave them the basic premise, Christy Marx and the others began the process of expanding this into a full scenario, sending me updates every couple of days as they added new segments. CGW I understand that the game will take place between B5 and Crusade. Will the story actually be part of the series \"canon?\" JMS It's not so much canon as extrapolations on what could happen if certain key events in the B5 universe had not happened, or had happened differently. It puts the player in canonical elements of the B5 storyline—the Minbari War, the Earth civil war, others and sees what impact one person's actions can have on a much larger scenario. CGW You've had unprecedented involvement with the B5 fan base using PCs. What have been the best and worst-aspects of that online communication channel? JMS The best has been the sense of real community that has arisen around the show; the worst has been the Net stalkers who come around from time to time. The psychotic minority tends to screw things up for the majority online. CGW Do you ever find time in your schedule to play computer games, and if so, what have some of your favorites been? JMS It's hard to find the time, but I try to play when I can. MYST (old, and new), the MONTY PYTHON game/CD, WING COMMANDER (all of them), DOOM, others. For more on the BABYLON 5 SPACE COMBAT SIMULATOR, see page 68.

Additionally, every unit will sport an individual special attack, adding even more depth.

But stray too far from the straight and narrow, and you can expect to get surrounded by The Man abandon their wheels and go in on foot, the better to stealthily eliminate the opposition. With a number of auto combat titles on the not-too-distant horizon, LOOSE CANNON is looking to distinguish itself with its more realistic game world and a variety of mission goals including hostage rescues, escort duty, and kill 'em all rampages. STARLANCER marks Digital Anvil's return to its space combat roots. As part of a civilian-comprised military unit 100 years in the future, gamers will pilot space fighters as part of a NATO-type force struggling operated fleet commanders that will competently direct your forces when you're busy elsewhere. Like most of Digital Anvil's titles, CONQUEST should be done by Q3 '99. Next up is LOOSE CANNON, an action/adventure game focused on vehicular combat. In yet another near future world gone terribly wrong, gamers will play a bounty hunter fighting for that most American of goals-cold, hard cash. While a storyline will unfold through a set series of missions, gamers will have the opportunity to raise money to upgrade and repair their cars by apprehending bank robbers and the like in between the primary missions.

Gone are the slumming Hollywood actors of WING COMMANDER games; instead, the story will unfold through animated characters who will respond to the player's success or failure. STARLANCER is planning on supporting up to eight players in multiplayer games and should be ready by late 1999, Digital Anvil is keeping a tight lid on its fourth title, FREELANCER, which is Chris Roberts' personal project. While all Digital Anvil was willing to show were some early (but cool) concept sketches, the ambition behind the game is remarkable. Designed to be massively multiplayer, FREELANCER is shooting to support 100 players at a time in a graphically rich game world where some ships will sport up to 10,000 polygons. Start saving now for the hardware you'll need. With its shroud of secrecy finally lifted, Digital Anvil seems poised to make quite an impact in the coming year.

Fans of the original will be happy to learn that while the design team has left Activision, they've stayed together as Pandemic Studios and are crafting a game that will be hard to ignore.

"Ultima Online Lawsuit Update READ. ME Court Refuses to Certify Plaintiffs as \"Class\" McConnel held that the plaintiffs failed to show \"common questions of law and fact predominate in this action.\" Specifically, the court believed that all of the named plaintiffs were affected differently, if at all, by the alleged technical problems and misrepresentations on the box. Since each plaintiff's experience with the game was unique, all of the plaintiffs could not be viewed as a single \"class\" with common theories of liability and damages. Therefore, according to the court, the individual testimony of each plaintiff, including the unnamed thousands of ULTIMA ONLINE players should they wish to join the suit, is going to be necessary to establish (1) if EA and Origin are liable to each plaintiff and (2) what the damages to each plaintiff should be, if any. Does this mean the suit is over? Not at all. The plaintiffs can appeal Judge McConnel's ruling to a higher court. If the appellate court reverses the lower court's decision on class certification, EA and Origin could still face a class action lawsuit from the more than 200,000 gamers. Moreover, the judge's ruling has absolutely no effect on the plaintiff's individual claims against EA and Origin. Such claims are set to go to trial on February 11, 1999. The ULTIMA ONLINE add-on THE SECOND AGE is now out at a discount price of $6.99 to purchasers of the original, which prompts the question: If the ULTIMA ONLINE lawsuit had not been filed, would EA and Origin still by giving UO: THE SECOND AGE away for next to nothing? Probably not. Michael Hawash Did Origin discount UO: THE SECOND AGE to purchasers of the original game because of the suit? n the November issue of CGW, we reported that a lawsuit has been filed by several disgruntled gamers against Electronic Arts and Origin Systems over ULTIMA ONLINE. At issue is whether EA and Origin should pay damages to the gamers for releasing a game plagued by alleged technical problems, such as lag and server crashes, and deceptive packaging, such as a failure to mention monthly fees and adequate system requirements. One goal of the gamers (the plaintiffs) has been to have the court certify them as a \"class.\" Such a ruling would mean that just about everyone who has ever played ULTIMA ONLINE could join the lawsuit as an \"aggrieved plaintiff\" and seek damages from EA and Origin without having to personally appear in court and give testimony. After weighing the merits of the case, the Superior Court of California for San Diego County ruled in favor of EA and Origin and against class certification. Judge Judith Plastic Fantastic Army Men II Gets Re-Equipped RMY MEN was a great game concept. It tapped into gamers' nostalgia for blowing up the green plastic men of our youths. But it suffered from an awkward interface and complicated, \"realistic\" environments far too grandiose for simple plastic figures. ARMY MEN II, soon to be released by 3DO, fixes both problems and plunks our fearless friends where they oughtta be: in and around the house. The interface is entirely new, and you can control Sarge or the other troopers by clicking on them or dragging a square around them as in COMMAND & CONQUER. Also as in C&C, each have their own health bar. In single player you'll fight 28 missions across 12 maps including kitchen counters-being careful to avoid stove burners-bedrooms, hobby tables, yards, and other settings.

"YOUR BEST SOURCE FOR THE HOTTEST GAMES IN DEVELOPMENT Fly! Terminal Reality Challenges Microsoft (and Sierra, and Looking Glass) to a Dogfight by Denny Atkin orget slingshots. This David is packing a bazooka. When the Goliath you're taking on is Microsoft's FLIGHT SIMULATOR, one of the longestand best-selling computer games of all time, you need all the weaponry you can pack. And with FLY!, developer Terminal Reality, Inc. (TRI) looks to be armed to the teeth. FLIGHT SIMULATOR in one version or another has consistently been near the top of the sales charts for well over 15 years. Other upstarts have tried to knock it off its throne, but have failed for one reason or another. Looking Glass' FLIGHT UNLIMITED II is a great program in many respects, but its small flying area meant only San Francisco-area residents could use it to fly from their home airports. Sierra's PRO PILOT '98 was a buggy mess with retro graphics that did sell a number of copies, but only after it was reduced to a bargain-bin price. PRO PILOT '99 is dramatically better, but still has limited 3D support and gaping holes in its flight modeling. The biggest problem with the current crop of civilian simsFLIGHT SIMULATOR '98 includedis that each one only excels in a limited area of simulating the flight experience. FLY! is aiming to make its mark on sim pilots by not skimping in any area. It's not going to attempt to do everything in version 1.0, of course. Passenger jets, for instance, will remain the exclusive realm of FLIGHT SIM '98's rather lightly modeled 737-at least for now. But what it's going to do, FLY! is aiming to do very well. Fly!

A wide variety of realism settings let you tailor the complexity of the sim for beginners or licensed pilots alike. SNEAK PREVIEWS 9000 2009. MOO time-FLY! attempts to create an exact replica of the real plane's cockpit. This necessitates scrolling around the screen to see the entire instrument panel, but it's worth the tradeoff. If you're a real pilot-or you hope to be some day—there's no looking around to see if a particular switch is modeled on the panel, and where the designers put it. And the instrument detail is unprecedented. In the alpha version I've been flying, for instance, the NAVICOM instruments aren't yet fully documented, but the developers suggest checking out the actual Bendix/King radio documentation for the real plane if you want to use some of the instruments' more esoteric functions. The cockpit simulation doesn't stop with the main panel. Floor and—where appropriate-overhead panels are modeled as well. Virtually every switch, dial, and control in the real plane is accessible by clicking on it. So instead of rooting around your desk for the keycard when you can't remember the key to adjust trim, you simply toggle the view to the floor panel and click on the actual trim wheel to adjust it. Doing it this way is also better for learning how the procedures are handled in the real plane. While most of the switches in the cockpit are functional, FLY! will also accommodate the begin ning pilot or casual sightseer. For instance, while you can start up the engine by going through the First Solo The early version of FLY! that 1 tested had fairly complete flight models for the NICE STACK The Cessna's panel sports a full Cessna 172R and suite of instruments, including a Global the twin-engined Positioning System receiver.

Flying the Cessna as 1 appear asking which service would in real life, its responses you want to communicate with and performance seemed on the Air Power recently talked to Richard Harvey, Senior Software Engineer on FLY!, about some of the underpinnings of the project. The sim is being designed with a strong foundation for future expansion. For instance, Harvey talks about how, instead of hard-coding all the characteristics of a particular plane in the sim, TRI actually built a simulation of the guts of an airplane. \"We don't have to fudge' the sim to fit an aircraft,\" Harvey says. \"The sim is unaware that a Cessna 172R is being flown; the aircraft was assembled from components, with its unique performance attributes specified from disk. Tuning involves validating performance values in the aircraft files. If we put in original manufacturer numbers and don't get the expected results, we look into our sim for a potential problem, because the math should be totally unaware of the simulated object involved.\" This detail goes far deeper than pure performance numbers, Harvey says. \"Honestly, with FLY!, we spend as much time on elec. trical systems and components as we have to tuning numbers,\" he explains. \"One of the neat things is how our electrical bus and systems are defined. A neat example is a power switch for a radio. We don't actually code something like: 'If user turns power switch, radio is on. Instead, we define the entire electrical bus and fuse layout. So, if you turn on the power switch on a radio, the radio may or may not turn on. The switch detects the state change, and queries its local bus for power. The local bus may query a fuse. A fuse may query a master bus. The master bus may query a battery. When all is said and done, the power source for the radio will turn on.' It allows our systems to just work, I don't have to hard-code some huge dependency of 'if this switch, that knob, this key, allow this.\" As complicated as this sounds, in the long run it should make expanding the sim easier. Harvey explains, \"Our wiring system tracks it's own dependencies, so we can wire very complex systems in a very short amount of time, with no code necessary. It follows our entire design philosophy--if you design the systems right, and do the math and sim right, it just works.\" No fudging necessary. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Pushing into more suicidal regimes, I was able to loop, spin, and even snaproll the plane. Control response felt natural, neither overly sensitive nor overly stable. Landing gear strut movement is modeled as well. This not only provides nice, subtle movements as you brake on the ground, but also adds to the realism of landing, where bouncing off the runway can be a real problem for beginning pilots. Fly will sport over 9,500 airports worldwide at which you can test those landing skills. There will be five scenery areas modeled in great detail, using satellite imagery, including San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Los Angeles, and one other. Around airports and downtown areas, the scenery looks great-of similar quality to that of FLIGHT UNLIMITED II. Other regions of the world will have accurate terrain elevation and texturing, but the scenery will be generic. So while your hometown may not be modeled, its airport will be. And you won't be able to sightsee around Berne, Switzerland, but the Alps will be right where you expect them. TRI is making the scenery (as well as aircraft and instrument panel) formats available to thirdparty developers, however, so expect more cities soon after the sim is released. A third-party European scenery CD is already in the works. Cross-Country Of course, there will be a full set of navaids for instrument navigation. One innovative feature will help when flying visual. Pressing the forward slash key (1) will change the cursor to an aiming sight. Point at the ground and you'll get a pop-up with the distance to that site in nautical miles. Point at a landmark or airport and you'll also get the object's name, and, in the case of airports, ATC or runway localizer frequencies.

Press a key and a sectional chart for the current flight region, showing your current position and heading relative to the chart, will pop up. Sectional maps will be included for the entire U.S. --no more digging through your desk looking for a paper map. When flying IFR, the sim can poll an Internet database and import real-time weather from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Everything from scattered clouds to thunderstorms will be modeled. The clouds were still a work in progress in the version I tested, but already had volume and translucency. A sophisticated flight planner will let you plot out cross-country flights, and it can automatically generate the route for you. There will also be a variety of preset situations, such as landing at Catalina Island. You won't be alone in the skies, either. Both general aviation and airliner traffic will be modeled, giving you a chance to practice entering a crowded pattern. The sim will generate real flight plans for each plane. You'll hear Al planes calling for clearance, and you can even follow them from takeoff to their final destination. (And yes, Kamikaze Boy, collisions will be implemented.) In addition, the Flight Party multiplayer mode will let you fly with up to seven others over the Internet. The sim's \"Live Mike\" technology will let Take Off, Eh? TRI knows that it's going to have to make a good impression with the first release of FLY! if it's going to be a worthy competitor for the FLIGHT SIM series. To that effect, when it became apparent that the company couldn't get all the features it wanted into the sim by Christmas, 1998, the developers decided to hold the product until the second quarter of '99 and do it right.

Those same characteristics make Sierra FX's BABYLON 5 SPACE COMBAT SIMULATOR (B5 SCS) one of the most promising license-based computer games we've seen. Babylon 5 Space Combat Simulator The or The Last, Best Hope for a Great Licensed Computer Game do know that it will focus on a war with the Dilgar, and apparently, time travel will play a part in the story as well. While there will be video sequences filmed on the show's sets, the real action will take place in a Starfury fighter. Starfury Unleashed As you can guess, this first Babylon 5 game focuses on space combat. (The follow-up title will be an adventure, based on the UNREAL engine.) Most of the game will be seen from the cockpit of a Starfury fighter. Canon Fire With the exception of a couple of Star Wars-based titles, it's been rare to find a top-quality title based on a television or movie title. Fans concerned that B5 SCS will be a less than stellar title can take solace in knowing that The Great Maker, B5 producer J. Michael Straczynski, is guiding the game design. In fact, the game will fill in the gap between Babylon 5, which aired its final episode last November, and the sequel series Crusade, which begins airing on TNT this spring. B5 SCS is being codesigned by Christy Marx, who wrote a first season episode of Babylon 5 and Babylon 5 Space Combat Simulator GENRE: Space sim RELEASE DATE: Q2 '99 DEVELOPER: Yosemite Entertainment PUBLISHER: Sierra FX designed CONQUEST OF CAMELOT and CONQUEST OF THE LONGBOW for Sierra; and Randy Littlejohn, who directed the photography for GABRIEL KNIGHT II. Straczynski had approval on concepts, scripts, and any elements added to the B5 universe by the game. While the story is primarily the creation of Marx and Littlejohn, Straczynski added a number of specific narratives to the storyline. B5 fans who know that seemingly insignificant comments in Season 2 can have major implications in Season 5 will likely go over this game's storyline with a fine-tooth comb. Alas, because the final episode of B5 hadn't aired when we visited developer Yosemite Entertainment in November, most of the details on the storyline were still under wraps.

"SNEAK PREVIEWS tail Panzer Elite Romancing the Panther With Psygnosis are up to it. Similarly, by Jim Cobb reviewing a game from early code is always dangerous. The designer notes promising, seductive features not yet fleshed out-or even created. The code itself suffers from inevitable hardware conflicts, crashes, and commands that have outdistanced scant early documentation. The author must discern what is possible in the designers' proposal from the reality seen in the code. He must extrapolate the game's concepts from the gameplay seen, and he constantly walks a tightrope trying to be neither too favorable to the final product nor unfairly critical to a work in progress. Fortunately, Psygnosis' PANZER ELITE (PE) has a rare mix of excitement and substance. Even though it's barely alpha, it's easy to tell that this game should be something special.

Platoon members can be ordered about with one hot-key, while the commander can control movement through a superimposed mouse tank. Of course, hot-keys will handle tank functions at the crew positions. Targets are selected with a click to be fired on by either the tank's gunner, another tank, or the entire platoons. The player can also serve the main gun using a simple boresight level of realism, a level where gravity and muzzle velocity is modeled, or an ultrarealistic mode with wind also modeled. Both bow and coaxial machine quns can be used to dispatch soft targets. Driving your vehicle seems simple, but it requires thought. Tanks flip over when going up steep slopes at a bad angle, and engines overheat when pushed too hard. Treads can be thrown rolling over obstacles or mines. Compasses are useless surrounded by so many tons of metal, so commanders navigate by maps and landmarks. Platoons can be ordered to a point by a click and a hot-key and get there in the usual column, line, echelon, and \"vee\" formations. The physics of maneuverability over the battlefield is just fascinating. The Tiger is often thought to be clumsy, yet its wider tracks made it more maneuverable than a Sherman on soft terrain. PE models such details for all vehicles (see sidebar). Combat requires a keen eye more than good reflexes. Crewmembers may spot the enemy, but the player still must make observations without bene. fit of visual cues to ensure the best results. As you'd expect in a physics-based tank sim, success generally requires that you maneuver for side and rear shots at the enemy and fire from stationary positions. In a Tiger it's tempting to simply sit there and bang away. But sooner or later, an enemy will get in a good shot at a vulnerable spot, so hull-down positions are important. When things get too hot, smoke shells and dischargers can provide cover. PE models many different kinds of mechanical and battle damage. some of which can be repaired by the crew. The missions are varied and include recon, assault static defense, and \"fire brigade\" responses. Campaigns can be short, medium, or long in duration, and they sport the usual crew ability improvements, supply increases, and decorations for good performance. While you can call in off-board artillery, your main support comes from independent units, who seem to fight quite well. I watched a squad of my own infantry take out an enemy, which speaks well for the Al. The computer opponent, even at this early stage of the code, is ANZER ELITE models an exhaustive array of vehicles-84 in all of which you can directly control 23.

American tanks modeled are M5A1; M10GMC; M4 (Sherman) A1, A1(76)W, AZ (late), A2(76)W; A3 Mid, A3(75)W. A3(76)W, and Jumbo. These variants model not only different engines, armor, and guns, but also such minutiae as different compartment variations and wet boxes for ammunition storage. The detail doesn't stop there. Along with high explosive (HE) and smoke rounds, the Germans can choose from nine different armor-piercing (AP) rounds, depending on the tank and variant. Americans may choose from five different AP rounds and two kinds of HE shells. Each shell type has its unique muzzle velocity and penetration characteristics. Lest you worry that infantry is forgotten, squads may carry bazookas, Panzerfausts, Panzerschrecks, AT grenades, and rifle grenades (limited by nationality and time of the war). To wake the sleepy, Teller mines are sown here and there as wake-up calls. Basically, PE gives enough detail to send even veteran players scrambling for reference books and calculators to choose the best ordinance mix. Or, you can simply have a great time blowing up the countryside (and hopefully, a few enemy tanks) with a wide variety of WWII weaponry. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"thas the kind of face only a mother could love. In the days when the sleek, supersonic F-15 Eagle and F-16 Falcon were coming into service, FairchildRepublic introduced the A-10 Thunderbolt II. This hulking, subsonic jet looked more like a single-seat, jet-powered version of World War II's B-24 Liberator than an answer to the problems of the modern battlefield. With the ugliest visage this side of the A-6 Intruder and a seemingly endless string of pylons jutting from under its wings, the plane was quickly rechristened the \"Warthog\" by the pilots who flew her. But while it may not have been attractive, any plane that can carry twice the bomb load of a WWII B-17 Flying Fortress and fire 65 depleted-uranium shells per second merits a certain level of respect. And what better way to pay homage to the air force's ground concerned, however. Despite this push toward accessibility, the pounding wonder than to set loose the Austin, sim still promises unrivaled cockpit, flight, and Texas-based branch of Origin Skunkworks weapons modeling to create a simulation of the plane.

Virtually every system found in the titanium-armored cockpit of a real A-10 is modeled here in exacting detail. As I sat with Mark Drajeske, who is developing the flight models for A-10, I felt like! was being briefed for a flight in the real plane. A former engineer with McDonnellDouglas, Drajeske helped develop an AC-130 training simulation for the Air Force Special Ops forces and the flight modeling for the BACK TO BAGHDAD F-16 sim. A-10 WARTHOG will feature a 3D virtual cockpit with a full set of mouse-clickable controls. The differences between the real cockpit and the one in the game are negligible. To make room for the autopilot panel, the developers have removed three instruments not necessary to gameplay—the UHF frequency indicator, the standby attitude indicator and the clock-but otherwise the panel is virtually identical to that of the actual jet. The real A-10 doesn't have radar, so most of the learning curve new players will climb involves the heads-up display (HUD), the Maverick missile targeting system, and the various weapons release modes. Because you have no high-tech targeting systems, combat in the A-10 feels similar to combat in the plane's WWII namesake, the P-47 Thunderbolt: It basically boils down to \"point the plane at the enemy and shoot until the enemy isn't there anymore. That's not to say there aren't loads of details here for the hard-core pilot who wants to delve into the plane's systems. Virtually every weapon the real A-10 can carry has been meticulously modeled: MK-82, -83, and 84 general purpose bombs (both low-drag and air-retarded variants); MK-77 Napalm bombs; Rockeye and CBU-52, -87, and -97 cluster bombs, GBU-10 and -12 laser-guided bombs, TVand infrared-guided AGM-65 Mavericks, explosive and smoke variants of the LAU-3 rocket; SUU-25 illumination flares; AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, and the stalwart GAU-8/A 30mm cannon. The HUD system, called LASTE (LOWAltitude Safety and Targeting Equipment), gives you a wealth of targeting options.

WORLD WAR II FIGHTERS-level of detail in its graphical depiction of damage. The sim's flight model was mostly complete when I visited the Skunkworks office, and the handling was very good. The full six-degrees-of-freedom force-and-moment flight model replicates not only the plane's normal flying characteristics but also the quirks and variations you get at different loads and altitudes. Adverse yaw during rolling maneuvers, for instance, can cause your plane's nose to move in the opposite direction of the roll. In high G/high angle-of-attack conditions, the yaw can cause a wing to stall, or disrupt airflow to one of the engines, causing it to shut down. The aerodynamic model actually uses control surface deflections to maneuver the plane, and when a surface gets blown off or stuck in one position due to damage, maneuvering will be appropriately hampered. Flying the A-10 will be an interesting experience for players weaned on F-16 and F-22 sims. Unlike in those planes, the A-10's thrust doesn't exceed its weight (depending on load, the thrust-to-weight ratio ranges from 0.4:1 to 0.6:1), and pilots will find that while the A-10 excels at instantaneous turns it quickly bleeds speed during sustained turns. And forget going vertical, at least for more than a few seconds. Also, the A-10's turbofan engines take about five seconds to spool up so you'll have to think ahead when flying this plane. The A-10 features Stability Augmentation Systems for both pitch and yaw, which temper some of the plane's handling characteristics. If you shut these down, or if they're damaged, the plane won't be nearly as tame. If your plane's dual hydraulics systems are damaged, the sim models the Manual S I ACCEPT Maj. Mc Muffin BOMB...

"Reversion Mode (MRM), which literally uses cables to fly the plane. In this mode the A-10 is very difficult to handle, and pilots forced to use it are advised to fly in MRM until they reach a friendly base, then eject.

"Photos by michaei faiconer THE POWER RIG MINI This is the system that most of us can only dream of owning. Still, its practical at a fundamental level. There are no RAID arrays to maintain, no motherboards that need PCI bridge chips, and no $5,500 monitors. But it features a fast CPU, the fastest hard drive you can get-one of the biggest, too—and graphics that can shrug off high polygon counts and huge textures while it keeps pumping out frames. I'll cover components in detail later, but let's touch on a few things. The core of the system is the 450MHz Pentium II. The Pentium II lives on an ASUS P2B-LS motherboard with 256MB of PC100 SDRAM. While money is no object with the Power Rig, other practicalities do weigh in, like free PCI slots. The P2B-LS has onboard Ultra2 low-voltage differential SCSI in the form of the Adaptec 7890 SCSI controller chip. The hard drive is Seagate's Cheetah 18, supplying a massive 18GB of storage. And since the Cheetah spins at 10,000RPM, it delivers that data fast. Iomega's competent Jazz car tridge drive provides our backup, while Pioneer's DVD-302 SCSI DVD drive for CD-ROM and DVD disks rounds out the mass storage. No gaming system would be complete without fast graphics. The primary card for our Power Rig is the Canopus Spectra 2500, which is coupled to a Quantum Obsidian X-24 Voodoo2 SLI graphics card. The Spectra 2500 uses the nVidia, RIVA TNT chip, while the Obsidian X-24 is a Voodoo-SLI setup on a single PCI card. S everal other items contribute to making this a higher end rig, too. Instead of using the power so I added a hard-drive cooler, supply that came with the case, which is essentially a hard-drive we substituted the PC Power and mounting bracket with a couple Cooling TurboCool 300.

While difficult to find and often back-ordered, the Elan Vital T10-AB (also sold under the ASUS name) is one of the best cases around if you upgrade tre quently. If you're the kind of person who gets a system and opens it up maybe once in three years, you don't need this case. But if you spend a lot of time tinkering this is a beauty. The 235W power supply that ships with the case seems to handle all the hardware we've added with ease. www.con COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. FEBRUARY 1999 105 "

"THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE PT.3 BRAINS AND PRAWN pentium II intel. oth our Power Rig and our Lean Machine have motherboards that use Intel's 440BX chipset. The main reason you need the 440BX is to support the 400MHz and 450MHZ Pentium Il processors, which use the 100MHz front side bus (that is, the memory is clocked at 100MHz instead of 66MHz, as in past systems). But there's another important consideration for a motherboard: Can you upgrade it? Most 440BX motherboards will support Intel's next generation Katmai CPU when it ships in 1999. (Bear in mind you'll probably want Katmai, even if you don't pick it up at first release. The new CPU instructions that are part of Katmai promise to improve 3D geometry calculations by as much as 70 percent with games that support it.) Even if your budget such that you can afford, say, only a 300MHz CPU, you should still get a 440BX motherboard and PC100 SDRAM. That will give you lots of room for growth without having LOCK AND LOAD Pentium it remains the cou of choice forgamers.its single edge corneco torsdaging makes installation feel a little like slapping a clip into a .45. devices when it first shipped, but the current BIOS release has stabilized the board, and everything has run rock solid for several months now. ASUS also makes versions of the P2B with onboard LAN or onboard SCSI alone. The Abit BH6 used in the Lean Machine has five PCI slots, two ISA slots (a PCI slot shares a position with an ISA slot), and only three DIMM sockets. But with the BH6 you can set (and tweak) clock speeds in the system BIOS. The BH6 seems much more stable than its older sibling, the BX6, and has an extra PCI slot. Other than the obvious clock rate, there is one key difference between the Pentium II CPUs. The 450MHz CPU is the boxed version, complete with fan. However, for budget reasons I couldn't squeeze in a 400MHz boxed CPU, so I went with an OEM CPU. That forced me to buy a separate fan, but the total cost was still less than the boxed CPU. The peril with this approach is that Intel will only honor a 90-day warranty on OEM CPUs, and you have to go through your reseller to get replacements. to swap out your motherboard and RAM. The Power Rig's ASUS P2B-LS has four PCI slots, three ISA slots (one PCI slot shares a space with one ISA slot), and, of course, the AGP slot. The cool thing about this board is the built-in Adaptec Ultra2 SCSI, which has the same performance as Adaptec's 2940U2W card-and since the SCSI card costs around $300, onboard SCSI is a good deal. The onboard Intel 10/100 Ethernet chip is handy for local area network gaming.

"THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE PT.3 MOVING PICTURES BOTH BARRELS This year, both systems feature Nvidia's Riva TNT for 2D/3D, and 3Dfx's Voodoo2 for 3D and GLIDE compatibility. really noticed. The Spectra is unique in this business in that it runs game tests, like 3D GameGauge, better than it runs synthetic benchmarks. After all, it's game performance that's important. I have this obsession about systems: I want to conserve all the resources I can. Since the Obsidian X24 is Voodoo2 SLI in a single PCI slot, it's very appealing to me; even though there are cheaper SLI solutions, they don't give me back a PCI slot. While the TNT is about as fast a single-chip 2D/3D solution as you can get, there's nothing that matches the raw horsepower of Voodoo-SLI. The Power Rig's monitor is the Sony 500PS, a Trinitron monitor with a.25 stripe pitch and a relatively high bandwidth. It actually looks good at 1280x1024, and you can run it at 1600x1200 if you want. On the Lean Machine, we manage to squeeze in a TNT board by using the no-frills Creative Labs Graphics Blaster TNT. This is a fairly sweet board, though Creative has been somewhat tardy with its driver updates. The card ships with Colorific's color matching tools and 3Deep gamma correction package. It may be my imagination, but after I ran the Colorific calibration, the overall image seemed crisper and brighter. It wasn't possible to get SLI into a sub-$2,000 box, but thanks to Guillemot's aggressive pricing, I did get a capable, 12MB Voodoo reference board into the system for $99, after rebate. for the Lean Machine monitor we chose the Optiquest V75. This is a relatively high bandwidth, 17inch monitor and will actually run at 1600x1200, though Windows text is far too small for good legibility through my eyes. You can find it for less than $380 with a little searching. There's another piece of graphics hardware that found its way into the Power Rig: a hardware DVD decoder. I went with a Quadrant International Cinemaster decoder: It ships inside a DVD kit, or you can find white box versions from resellers. Its claim to fame is that it does not require any passthrough cables for video. All video data transfers over the PCI bus. The primary graphics card has to support linear frame buffer, but almost all do these days. Video image quality with the Cinemaster looks pretty good to my eye-1 had to squint to see artifacts in scenes with a lot of motion. or gaming, the graphics subsystem ranks second only to the CPU. Even if you don't play BD titles much, the graphics card is still important. Even playing a real-time strategy game, such as STARCRAFT, can demand a lot of a graphics card. Canopus has thoughtfully added a fan to its Spectra 2500, which we used in the Power Rig. Since the environment inside the big rig gets pretty warm, that's a nice touch. More interesting is the reverse passthrough. Unlike most setups with a Voodoocard, the monitor plugs into the Canopus card. A special cable connects the monitor output from the X24 to the opus improves 2D image quality, though I haven't TAR www.computergam COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. FEBRUARY 1999 "

"THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE PT.3 IN DIVE DIVE DIVEI The dual fans on the Seagate Cheetah 18 make it look like a mini-sub. Both disc readers are slot-feeders, eliminating caddies and cup-holders. ame installs aren't getting any smaller, so with any system you're going to need ample room and a fast CD-ROM to keep installations and gameplay moving along. The Power Rig has Seagate's massive Cheetah 18 hard drive in the big tower chassis. As for speed, the Cheetah 18 spins at 10,000RPM and has an access time under 6 milliseconds, with transfer rates that approach 20MB/sec over the Ultra2 SCSI bus. The CD-ROM chores are handled by a Pioneer DVD-302 SCSI DVD drive, which should perform as a 20x CD-ROM drive and a 2.6x DVD drive. The DVD-302 mates well with the Cinemaster DVD decoder. Maybe I can finally boot up the DVD version of RIVEN that's been sitting on my shelf. (Then again, maybe not.) Still, it is nice to have DVD without a huge sacrifice in CD-ROM performance. Since the Power Rig is no holds barred, I added backup in the form of an lomega Jaz2. It can use 2GB removable cartridges to back up important data, and it's faster than something like CD-Rbut the cartridges are more fragile. On the Lean Machine, the hard drive is the trusty Seagate Medalist Pro 6530. The SIST lone holdover from last year's budget rig, the 6530 makes it back due to its good performance and low price of $199. Plus, it spins at 7,200RPM and holds up to 6.5GB of data. Pioneer's new DR-7045 gets the nod as our CD-ROM drive here. It's probably no better or worse than the majority of ATAPI CD-ROM drives, but I'm hooked on the slot-loading concept.

We found this out in the first five minutes as he cagerly compared our designs with a dozen other racing titles, all of which he was intimately familiar with. \"So the bundling is a little like Porsche Challenge?\" Gordon would say. \"That's good the handling was the best part about that game.\" His enthusiasm was both obvious and infectious. From the beginning he understood game mechanics, and not just from racing games, even cracking jokes about an extended game of Asteroids he played once. At one point in our meeting while taking a lap on the first playable PC version of the game, the car kept slipping out from under him at the same point on \"What I'd like to see is that no matter how good or how bad you are at this game, there's a lot of competition, a lot of side by side racing, so that even when you pass, they're still on your tail...

He only wanted to be associated with a game he himself wanted to play Il We could reach 300 miles an hour on that track!!! So, why Jeff Gordon? Because he isn't just an expert on racing, he's also an enthusiastic racing gamer. The story goes that a few years ago. Gordon went to one of his first sponsorship meetings wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase. Inside the case, however, there were only two items: A cell phone, and a Game Boy. Does this story sound too strange to be true? Well, meet with Gordon for ten minutes and talk about games, any games.

"THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE PT.3 BRING THE NOISE un moms udio is hot once again. We've emerged from the doldrums induced by the aged Sound Blaster standard. Even Creative Labs has jumped on the PCI wagon in a big way with its Sound Blaster Live card. The sound card for the Power Rig was probably one of the toughest choices. Do you go with the Sound Blaster Live or Diamond's Monster Sound MX300? The Creative card has just about the lowest CPU utilization of any DirectSound 3D accelerator, and EAX actually works well. After much anguish, I went with the MX300, which uses Aureal's new Vortex2 chip. The MX300 will run all the A3D titles out there and will even support EAX titles, even though its CPU utilization comes in higher than the Sound Blaster Live. But the clincher? The MX300 features a daughtercard connector, letting me pop on my revered Roland Sound Canvas SCD-15 MIDI Wavetable daughtercard. Speakers for the Power Rig are still the Eminent Technologies LFT-115, a holdover from last year's system. These continue to be the best PC speakers we've heard, on a par with many high-fidelity audio speakers. A pair of Altec Lansing ACS-43s currently handle the rear-speaker chores for four-speaker DirectSound3D. However, Eminent is working on a four-speaker version of its LFT-115, and we're very much looking forward to them. As the sound card for the Lean Machine we chose the Diamond Sonic Impact 590, which uses Aureal's Vortex 1 chipset. The S90 can eat up CPU cycles when \"accelerating\" DirectSound3D, but it supports A3D and costs less than $50. Until something better comes along at that price, it will be fine. It sounds good, with decent support for game controllers and DOS games, though MIDI music is a bit weak. The speakers for the Lean Machine are none other than the Boston Acoustics BA-635s, which earned CGW's coveted five-star award in a recent speaker roundup. They pump out amazing sound from a tiny package. TURN IT UP Diame Boston Acoustics BA-635 heard, on a par with many TURN IT UP Diamond's MX-200 coupled with Roland's SCD15 MIDI daughtercard covers all the bases, although the Sonic Impact will get the job done adequately. speaker Sonic Impact will a NOSEBLEED SECTION his year we decided to build a third system, one in which price was the supreme consideration. Everywhere we could, we drove this rig's price down. Some of the components, in fact, are the same as those in the Lean Machine, including the case, the CD-ROM, the audio card, and the motherboard. Instead of a Pentium II, we opted for Intel's 300MHz Celeron-A, which has 128KB of Level 2 cache running at full processor speed. The combination of the Abit BH6 motherboard and the Celeron-A 300 is a good solution for users who want to experiment with overclocking (but you didn't hear that from us). There's only 32MB of PC100 SDRAM, Diamond's Monster Fusion AGP card handles the graphics chores. This card will support OpenGL, Direct3D, and Glide (3Dfx) games. The monitor is Optiquest's V55, a 15-inch monitor I found for $158. The Sonic Impact S90 board still handles audio, but the BA635s have been replaced by the Cambridge SoundWorks' PC Works, which can be had for $60. When looking for a good, cheap hard drive, we found the Maxtor 5.7GB model 2880 for $129. The whole system comes in at $1,088, including monitor-not bad at all. We thought long and hard about K6-2 systems, but the floating-point performance isn't quite up to snuff yet, even with the 366MHz chip. On the other hand, we could have built this Bargain Box for less. The real consideration, it turns out, is motherboard stability, particularly with AGP 2x graphics cards.

"THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE PT.3 TAKE CONTROL STRASO ow we get really personal—let's look at game controllers. We opted for ThrustMaster's F22 Pro joystick, mated to its TQS throttle and Elite rudder pedals for the flight gear. These are just the ticket when flying detail-laden sims, such as LONGBOW 2. Programming the F22/TQS combo is a chore, but it's made a little easier with Fox Two Pro, a tool specifically for programming the F22/TQS. As a gamepad choice, Microsoft's Freestyle Pro is interesting, but you can run only two of them via USB and one via the joystick port. We opted for Thrust Master's Rage 3D: It'sa comfortable, programmable gamepad for large-handed gamers, and you can daisy-chain up to four of them. Finally, there's the Extreme Competition CDS4000 racing wheel and pedals, the unit that made me a fan of racing games. Before using the CD54000, I was very RACE casual about racing sims. I have a lot more fun these days—that's CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON what winning will do.

It's not stellar in any single use, but it works well in most games, supports a fourth axis through the twist handle, and costs only around $55. If you want to throw in a gamepad or two, you can find Microsoft's teran SideWinder for around $20, and you can daisy-chain up to four of them. He subjected both the Power Rig and the Lean Machine to an extensive round of tests. This year we've graduated to Ziff-Davis' WinBench 99 suite of benchmarks. The CD-ROM WinMark is much more thorough and is a separate test from the standard WinBench suite. 3D WinBench has undergone a massive overhaul. There are now 15 scenes with Direct3D multitexture scenes, and many of the scenes have been reworked to behave more like today's crop of games.

"THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE PT.3 hen there are the more mundane input devices: the keyboard and mouse. We really liked the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard, but it is, alas, no longer available. The Logitech Newtouch has a great layout and crisp feel. Its only downer is the touchpad, but you don't have to use it. Instead, we brought Logitech's wireless wheel mouse into the mix. This slick little device uses radio frequencies rather than infrared to handle cordless communication, so you don't need line-of-sight between mouse and receiver. Plus, it works well with 3D shooters because you're no longer \"on the leash.\" While we put the same keyboard in all the systems, the Lean Machine uses the Logitech Wheel Mouse (the one with the cord), which can be found for less than 20 bucks. YOUR TYPE2 BER uses texture blending to achieve lighting effects in most of the scenes. This year, Audio WinBench 99 makes its debut. Audio WinBench 99 plays back a set of sounds, some positional, through DirectSound 3D. It's divided into two parts. One part checks CPU utilization of various samples played at varying resolutions; the other, a subjective test, shows how well the positional audio works with a particular sound card and speaker setup.

"THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE PT.3 The Generation of Extreme Control Just In Case... You need something to put all this cool hardware into and something to feed it power. The big rig uses the updated version of InWin's Q500 full tower case. The guts are basically the same, including the popout 3.5-inch drive bay and the removable motherboard tray, but the exterior has been updated. I ripped out the default power supply and added a PC Power and Cooling TurboCool 300. PC Power and Cooling makes power supplies that feed rock-solid current to the motherboard, and the TurboCool series pulls more air through the system than do most power supplies. The case for the Lean Machine is the Elan Vital T10-AB. You can also find this case under the ASUS label—when you can find it. It's a difficult case to locate and is often back-ordered. But it's well worth the hunt. You can open the T10-AB without any tools. The 3.5-inch hard-drive bay snaps out with the twist of a lever. Pop off the front bezel and you can slide out the 5.25-inch drive bay, too, making CD-ROM drive mounting a snap. It doesn't have a slide-out tray, but since it's so easy to yank out all the bays, that's not a big problem. The PCI slots are an important factor, and it's related to IRQs. Windows 98 can now do a better job of sharing those scarce IRQ resources with multiple devices, but some hardware still won't share IRQs. The PCI standard defines a maximum of six PCI slots without additional hardware to connect the PCI buses. With all the onboard I/O and the AGP slot, the PCI limitation is actually exceeded in both motherboards. This means that you may run into problems with an IRQ hogging device in the last PCI slot (the one next to the ISA slots). In fact, that last slot may not get an IRQ if all the IRQs have been grabbed by other devices. The solution: Put your Voodoo card in that last slot, since it doesn't need an IRQ. You may find that a veritable rat's nest of cables and wires develops inside the case. I never dress the cables, but you may want to pick up some cable ties and organize things a bit. Inserting the CPU will prove to be your biggest hassle. The Pentium II and the Celeron use a retention bracket. Currently, the brackets are different. In fact, there are two types of Pentium Il brackets. One fastens to the motherboard with screws that feed in from underneath the motherboard. A newer type simply snaps into the motherboard. I much prefer the second type, since I frequently forget to screw the old type in and must unbolt the whole mess just to attach the retention bracket. Snapping in the Celeron is a dicey affair: You have to use a lot more force than you do with the Pentium II. Grip the CPU/heat sink combo firmly before popping it in. Since Windows 98 comes on a bootable CD-ROM, installing from scratch is vastly easier than it used to be. Boot off the CD, get the drives partitioned and formatted, and install Windows. Make sure you have all your drivers handy. You've been gaming ever since you got weaned on Pong as a kid. Now you want a stick that'll do it all. Programmable. Digital. Analog. Comfortable. Cool. Different. New. GenX 700 by QuickShot is all that and more. This programmable stick comes complete with switches to move between digital and analog modes for the HAT, rudder, handle fire buttons and X & Y axes. Plus a 3D rotational handle and a multiview HAT switch. This stick's superergonomic with a contoured BioThrottle I complete with extra fire buttons.

Punish yourself no more. Enter the generation of extreme control. GET THIS STICK! Some Assembly Required A few months back I received an email from a reader. He had purchased all the parts for his own Lean Machine, and they were sitting on his kitchen table. He want ed to know what to do next. Building your own system isn't a trivial task, but if you've done regular upgrades-adding a graphics card, preparing a new hard drive, or installing Win 98 from scratch—you're ready to build a PC. There are some basics you need to know. First, have a good set of tools. I use a cordless electric screwdriver, a long, very thin screwdriver; a set of forceps (to handle jumpers); a pair of needle-nose pliers; and an antistatic mat. That's about it. The cordless screwdriver is a godsend and speeds the process dramatically. Second, watch electrostatic discharge, particularly in very dry climates. In humid areas, it's probably sufficient to touch the case to discharge any static electricity, but in very dry weather you'll want to use an antistatic strap at the very least. You can pick one up at Radio Shack or similar hobby shops. Regarding actual assembly, each of the systems has its own quirks, and there are some common to all systems. !

Somewhat similar to other high-performance 2D/3D parts, Voodoo3 will have dual, 32-bit rendering pipelines. 3Dfx stated that the chipset will be able to generate more than seven million triangles per second, which is twice the triangle performance of two Voodoo boards. As for fillrate, 3Dfx is quoting figures of 366 megatexels/sec for the 3000 version and 250 megatexels/sec for the 2000. Voodoo3 will sport a whopping 8.2 million transistors about the size of the RIVA TNT and will be manufac tured using a .25 micron process, which should allow for the higher clock rates that Voodood will need to hit its projected numbers. Voodoo3 will be 3Dfx's first AGP 2X part. In the first half of 1999 an AGP 4X version will be available. On the 2D side, Voodoo3 will integrate the 2D core from Voodoo Banshee, which includes a dedicated high-speed 128-bit interface and an internal 256-bit data path--so 2D performance should be more than adequate. Other goodies include DVD playback acceleration, the ability to talk to LCD displays, and even multiple simultaneous displays. 3Dfx has also stated that Voodoo3 will support Glide and Direct3D. OpenGL support will arrive by about the middle of next year. We hope Voodoo3's Glide compatibility will allow the new part to play older Glide titles smoothly—something that has been a problem in past parts. In Voodoo3, 3Dfx has once again aimed high and is seeking to define the high end of the PC 2D/3D accelerator market: on paper the company has the right stuff to do this. But with worthy competition from the likes of nVidia, ATI, and Rendition, the 3Dfx crew has their work cut out for them. Stay tuned to 3D Iron Works. As soon as we can lay our hands on Voodoo3, we'll give you the straight dope. -Dave Salvator AMD K6-3 AMD's next CPU, the K6-3, will retain AMD's 3DNow! for accelerating transforms and lighting for 3D rendering. K6-3's biggest improvement will be its onboard 256KB Level 2 (L2) cache, which will run at the CPU's core clock speed. Initial clock speed will mostly likely be 400MHz, and with its onboard L2, K6-3 will be even more competitive than a Pentium II. ETA: Q1 '99 AMD K7 AMD's revamped high-performance CPU. K7 will feature a 128KB Level 1 (L1) cache, and a 512K-8MB backside Level 2 (L2) cache, and also will support main memory speeds up to 200MHz. K7 has a revamped floating-point unit that features three superscalar execution units, and is fully pipelined. 3DNow! support is still present, and will help move Direct3D games along if they use D3D's transform and lighting engine. Intial speed grades are slated to be 500MHz. ETA: Q2 '99 3D Audio Arena Crowded Intel Katmai Intel's next round of CPUs, with anticipated clock speeds of 450-500MHz. They will feature new instructionset extensions dubbed \"Katmai New Instructions.\" Read: MMX2. ETA: Q1 '99 k here's a good bit of confusion surrounding 3D audio standards. There's DirectSound3D, Creative Lab's extensions to DS3D, called EAX (environmental audio extensions), and Aureal's A3D. Entering the fray is CRL, with its Sensaura package. CRL was formerly a division of EMI records but has since struck out on its own. Like Aureal's A3D, Sensaura is based on HRTF (headrelated transfer functions). This mouthful is simply the math that describes how your ears hear and localize positional cues. Much of what goes on involves sophisticated cross-talk cancellation, which involves making sure that what comes out of the left speaker is only heard in the left ear and the same for the right). Unlike A3D, which uses public domain work done at NASA on HRTF, CRL has done its own research. The company has gone so far as to construct a number of artificial heads with carefully modeled ears, to tweak its HRTFs to seem more realistic. CRL claims that its rear cues are better than ABD's, and that the vertical positional cues are better, too, if you have headphones. There are already a couple of sound chip companies that have signed up. OEM specialist IRON WORKS ESS will be adding Sensaura support, initially through software with its Maestro line of audio chips and later by incorporating it in hardware. With ESS's huge presence in the OEM maret, it's likely that Sensaura will be on a lot of desktops in the next year. Yamaha will be shipping driver support for Sensaura in its Waveforce 192 Digital product, which should be in stores now. Another interesting twist is that CRL is working on virtualizing EAX, which currently requires four speakers to produce 3D audio effects. Engineers at CRL believe they can leverage their HRTF research to get decent EAX performance out of two speakers, which would minimize the need for four speakers-something that at least this user considers an annoyance. -Loyd Case Intel IA-64 Intel's next next generation of processors, which will be a substantial departure from its traditional X86 CISC-based architecture. This new 64-bit CPU will use a new set of VLIW (very long instruction word) instructions and a technology termed EPIC (explicitly parallel instruction computing) to execute instructions in parallel.

"Step on it Step on RE THE HOOD Tweaking Some Overlooked Performance Sappers e spend a lot of time in Computer Gaming World talking about CPUs and graphics cards and their impact on game performance. Certainly the CPU and 3D accelerator (assuming you play 3D-accelerated games) are the major players in the performance equation. But there are components to consider, like sound cards, USB, and your hard disk This month, let's take a look at how to get the most out of these components, too. adequate--but 128MB is better. In fact, some of the RIVA TNT cards will start paging out to hard disk like mad when a game is run if there's 64MB of RAM or less. In this case, inefficient drivers are generating big automipmaps, which are written out to disk. There are other factors that eat up memory at work here, too. The first is AGP. Since AGP textures are stored in main memory, there's sound cards in a bit). PCI sound cards have no onboard RAM as ISA cards did. And most don't store their MIDI wavetables in a ROM, either. Instead, they store them in system memory. It's partly because the profit on sound cards is so thin that shaving 50 cents off by leaving the ROM out makes a big deal. But it's also because of a currently little-used standard called DLS (downloadable samples). In theory, a game developer could develop a custom MIDI patch that would then replace an existing one in the sound card's sample set. This would actually make for more efficient storage. However, no games I can think of actually use DLS yet. Luckily, most PCI sound cards allow you to specify how large the sample set stored in main memory should be. If you really want to be efficient. though, get one of the PCI cards that can still accept a MIDI daughtercard, like the Yamaha SW50XG, which can be had very cheaply these days. Disk Performance It begins mysteriously. Games that have run without any problems begin to run as slow as molasses on a December day in Manitoba. Sometimes they even crash. You groan and think, geez, time to reinstall Windows again? Maybe not. When's the last time you defragged your hard drive? Or removed extraneous files? Defragmenting your hard drives when they go over about four or five percent fragmentation can speed up disk performance by a surprising amount. What's more startling is that sometimes a game will begin running in a more stable manner when the disk has been defragged. Some games create temporary files on the hard drive then use them during the course of gameplay. Having a huge, uninterrupted expanse of disk space is much more efficient than having to use little nooks and crannies. System Memory The amount of memory needed to run games is going up. The games themselves are using more memory as they add more features, more sophisticated Al, and up the amount of game data that needs to be stored in memory. The rough rule of thumb for most systems these days is that 64MB is LOYD CASE some memory in addition to normal game memory used for AGP data. Another factor are PCI sound cards (we'll touch more on PCI Continued on page 145 PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS 4.61% TBS Montego (Vortex) 30.2% Sonic Impact (ESS) 0.241% 16 streamed voices through DirectSound at 22 kHz, 8 bit 13.8% 0.109% Sound Blaster Live 16 streamed voices through DirectSound3D at 22 kHz, 8 bit 3.36% 1.94% Sound Blaster PCI 128 3.64% My Frame-Rate Sounds Terrible!

"LOYD CASE I've been spoiled on the performance side of things ... but recently, ! booted up TRESPASSER and was shocked to see how sluggish it was. HARDWARE Continued from page 136 Windows 98 comes with a nifty tool called Disk Cleanup. It will automatically remove tempo rary files. It also pops up a small Explorerlike utility to help you wade through files that may be extraneous but requires a human to make the decision to keep or delete. \"Efficient\" is something of a relative term. Most PCI audio cards attempt to do more than ISA sound cards-3D positional audio, as an example. But it's a myth that all PCI sound cards are CPU efficient We now have a tool that helps us measure 3D audio card performance. The folks at the Ziff-Davis Benchmark Operation have recently released Audio WinBench 99 (www.zdbop.com). Audio WinBench plays back a sound file. using multiple simultaneous channels (up to 32). It does this for both DirectSound and DirectSound 3D. I took a look at 22KHz, 8-bit audio, which is pretty characteristic of the sound used in many games (see chart 1). The results were pretty startling. In the 16 channel test, the Turtle Beach Montego ate up 30 percent of the CPU in the DirectSound 3D test! So when you're playing a game with 3D positional audio, as much as one-third of your CPU horsepower is used by audio. Diamond's Sonic Impact S70, which uses the ESS Maestro 2 chip, 1/2 percent. The Monster Sound MX300 (Vortex2) results are to be taken with a grain of salt since we were running beta drivers, but the CPU utilization in excess of 10 percent is a lot better than the original Vortex. However, the nearly 12 percent number is a bit worrisome. Of course, by far the worst is the Altec Lansing ADA 70 USB speakers used without a sound card. None of the DirectSound streams are hardware accelerated. The result is a 35-plus percent CPU utilization in DirectSound3D. So while USB speakers work fine, you might still want a sound card. How this all translates into frame-rate is an open question What often happens in a gameparticularly if you scale up the resolution—is that the sound begins to stutter and fail, rather than the frame-rate tanking. Still, when running FORSAKEN and INCOMING, which use positional audio, some frame-rate degradation is shown when running on a high CPU utilization card. USB (Unusually Slow Bugger) I received email from a reader extolling the efficiency of USB mice. Apparently, Windows 98 will sample a USB mouse at a faster rate. This reader suggested that he got a faster frame-rate and smoother performance in QUAKE II using a USB mouse. As it turns out, QUAKE II actually runs slightly slower with a USB mouse-at least, on CGW's reference rig. The difference is only about 1-2fps, but is consistently measurable. However, the things can appear smoother with the USB mouse as you play-particularly in areas crowded with artificial or human opponents. The higher sampling rate results in smoother panning and mouse look, so sacrificing a couple of fps is beneficial if you're not performance-impaired. CH Products sent me the USB version of the F16 Combat Stick. 1 discovered there was no difference in QUAKE II frame-rate with the analog stick versus the USB version. However, the analog stick was plugged into a PCI audio card—the game ports on these cards are often more efficient than those on older ISA sound cards. The cool thing, though, was how the stick self-configured when plugged into the USB port. duction PC is a 350MHz Pentium II, and my game rig is a 450MHZ system. But recently, I booted up TRESPASSER and was shocked to see how sluggish it was. Remember what I said a couple of months ago about CPUs and 3D cards not being good enough? Whatever you may think of TRESPASSER as a game, it's something of a harbinger of the future. Every little performance-enhancing trick will become important once again. One last point: The dynamic range in performance between the low end and the high end will only get wider. Low-end systems in the future will likely ship with \"soft\" audio and moderately powered 3D accelerators, while high-performance (and high-priced) gaming rigs will come tricked out with the latest 3D hardware and PCI audio gear. If you are budget constrained (as most of us are), it behooves you to be careful about your hardware choices. Just a few dollars more may make the difference between playable frame-rates and UNREAL-asMYST. CGW CPU. The Sound Blaster Live looks to be the most efficient, at under 3 I've been spoiled on the performance side of things. My proLET'S OPEN UP THE MAIL BAG Help!

These days, there are a boatload of upgrade paths and options to boost your machine from slowpoke to speedster. If you've got a Socket 5 (non-MMX Pentiums) or Socket 7 (non-MMX and MMX Pentiums) rig, you'd probably like to breathe new life into it in order to play the latest games at something better than five seconds per frame. Well, the news is actually good, since CPU prices-like memoryare probably at an all-time low. Couple that with 16MB 3Dfx Banshee-based boards for under $100, and things get interesting. But every upgrade path has its pluses and minuses, and given that the Holy Grail of the best possible gaming performance is a moving target, you'd be wise to look before you leap.

"REVIEW  ALTEC LANSING ADA70 SPEAKERS Altec Lansing's Bus Rider HARDWARE by Loyd Case hat's amazing about the ADA70s is how easily they install and how well they work Connect a wire from the left speaker to the right one, connect a single cable from the right satellite to the sub, COMPUTER ers and plug it in (no power brick). Connect the speakers to the system with the supplied USB cable and turn on the computer. Windows 98 detects the USB device, installs a set of drivers from the Windows 98 CD, and you are set-no reboot required. These speakers sound good. They have very little ambient noise at high volume levels and the tonal balance is smooth. They also have bass and treble controls that allow you to adjust the tone somewhat and a software interface that lets you create presets. MIDI audio is supplied by the Win 98 software synth, which is based on the Roland Sound Canvas sample set. But when we played MIDI, it consumed about 10-15 percent of the CPU on our PII/400 test box. Therein lies the rub. Audio WinBench 99 reported CPU usage numbers of over 60 percent for DirectSound3D at 44.1 kHz/16-bit audio with 32 streams. The ADA70s connect to a standard sound card as well as the USB. Since the overall sound quality of the ADA70s is pretty good on both musical and game material, you can still enjoy the great sound of these speakers, and the performance improvement of a good PCI audio card.

Creative Labs aims to alter that equation. The RIVA TNT chip has unparalleled 3D acceleration in a single-chip solution. With twin texturing units and AGP 2X capability, the TNT is the current hot chip on the market. The board installs easily and the control panel is fairly slick, offering nearly as much customization as the tweak control that ships with STB's TNT board. If you install the Colorific software, you need to go through some subjective calibration, but the result seems to be a crisper image overall. Performance is a bit slower than with some of the other TNT boards we've seen, perhaps because Creative seems to be behind a driver generation. For example, there's some image corruption in the 2D menu screens of F22 ADF, something typical of first-generation TNT drivers. Comparing Creative's TNT board to STB's similar offering, the Velocity, Creative winds up on the short end in both 2D and 3D performance. In 3D GameGauge, Creative is on average 9fps COMPUTER GAMING **** WORLD slower than STB in each game, although Creative's performance may improve as it revs its drivers. Because Creative was going for a price advantage over other TNT boards, there's no TV out and the only bundled software is FORSAKEN and Colorific's color matching software (including its 3Deep 3D gamma-correction package). Still, we've seen this board for as little as $139—not bad for a 16MB graphics accelerator that can outpace a Voodoo? board in most Direct3D and OpenGL games. The bottom line is that Creative is shipping a fairly solid TNT board at a reasonable price. Here's hoping a driver update brings the speed up to par, too. CGW APPEAL: TNT performance on a budget. PROS: Priced aggressively, good perfor mance, easy installation. CONS: Not the fastest TNT board; some image quality problems; no TV out: limited bundle. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: AGP 2X slot.

"REVIEW SAITEK R4 FORCE FEEDBACK WHEEL Saitek's Microsoft Gambit HARDWARI by Loyd Case ooking like something out of the hovercar from Blade Runner, the R4 wheel contains a dark secret. Inside le that futuristic housing lies the COMPUTER GAMING WORLD * * * * * guts of the Microsoft Force Feedback wheel. Microsoft shipped the internal organs of its wheel to Saitek, and Saitek dropped them into its housing. So why do the forces in the Saitek wheel feel weaker than those of the Sidewinder wheel? At first, I thought it was my imagination, but when I compared the two wheels side-by-side, the Saitek definitely felt weaker in NEED FOR SPEED III. Go figure. The problem is that the Saitek wheel is built like the clumsy. gangly little brother to the Microsoft's sturdier offering. There are some nice touches, such as the shifter lever and the way that the pedals seem to be angled so that they're easier to press. However, the paddle shifters are made out of a flimsy plastic APPEAL: Fans of science fiction racing games who want to looks the part. PROS: Looks pretty cool: good pedals. CONS: Very plasticky, small parts fall off SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 90 running Windows 95 or better. Price: $199 Saltek Torrance, CA, USA (310) 212 5412 www.saitek.com that feel like they'll break off when shifting in the heat of a tight race. And then there's the \"hidden\" door. You see, the R4 comes with a hex wrench so that the wheel can be easily removed or attached to the main body. The hex wrench lives in a compartment built on the back side of the body. If you so much as jostle the R4, the door hiding the wrench falls off. In actual driving, the R4 works fairly well. The forces are a bit on the light side, and the flexible plastic used for the paddle shifters held up better than I'd feared. But the whole affair still seems flimsy. For $199, one would expect a little more. CGW REVIEW CREATIVE LABS 3D BLASTER BANSHEE Basic Banshee BLASTER by Loyd Case admit it: I'm spoiled. Had gotten this board even four months ago, I would have been in 3D graphics ecstasy. Now, I find myself yawning. Don't get me wrong: 3Dfx's Banshee chip is no Voodoo Rush. In fact, it does a very credible job of running most current Direct3D and Glide (3Dfx-specific) games. However, QUAKE and QUAKE II, both OpenGL titles, seem to run slower here than on TNT or even Voodoo?. Slower QUAKE Il performance is understandable since that title uses multitexturing, and the single-texture unit on the Banshee chip has to use two rendering passes instead. But given Banshee's slightly higher clock rate, you would certainly expect GL QUAKE to be faster on the Banshee than on a Voodoo. And you'd be wrong. The Direct3D games in 3D GameGauge trailed the TNT scores by only a bit, but the Banshee's mediocre GL performance pulled down its overall 3D GameGauge score. Banshee does turn out to be a very credible 2D performer, trailing TNT performance only slightly at 1024x768x32 bit color. Like the Graphics Blaster TNT, this iteration of the 3D Blaster ships with Colorific's color-management and gamma-correction software. Creative's control panel is nicely thought out and even has a clockCOMPUTER WORLD GAMING ****  PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS APPEAL: Budget-minded users looking to run Direct3D-, OpenGL, and 3Dfx-specific games PROS: Fast single-texturing performance; solid 2D.

I changed it to one clock cycle and had instant Windows lock. Oddly, cranking up the clock rate had zero effect on 3D GameGauge. At a little over $100 (the average street price seems to be around $115), the 16MB 3D Blaster Banshee is a decent budget board. But with Diamond's Banshee board holding the high ground in terms of performance and the Guillemot Phoenix being the price champ, Creative's board may find itself in no-man's land.at a reasonable price.

"REVIEW  SAITEK CYBORG 3D GAMEPAD Clumsy Chameleon HARDWARE by Dave Salvator here's a maxim that human interface designers of all stripes will tell you, \"It's easy to make it hard, and hard to make it easy.\" That would seem to be the COMPUTER GAMING WORLD *** challenge Saitek took on in creating its new Cyborg 3D gamepad controller. This odd-looking fellow tries to be a flight driving, and arcade controller all wrapped up in one. Oh yeah, it also tries to be your next 3D shooter controller as well. The problem in trying to cover so many bases is the number of trade-offs you wind up making to accommodate these different genres. Cyborg 3D does a pretty good job with driving and sports titles, but don't take this thing into a QUAKE II DeathMatch unless you want to come out with a toe-tag. To test this guy out, I took it for a spin through QUAKE II, NEED FOR SPEED III, NBA LIVE 99, and WARBIRDS 2.0. To switch between these different genres, Cyborg has three modes: Flying, Driving, and Arcade, which enable/disable different parts of the controller. Programming this controller is fairly straightforward, thanks to Saitek's Command Centre (when will those British learn to spell?) programming front-end. In QUAKE II, the news is not good. Yes you can program Cyborg 3D to free-look, but if you're someone used to dealing death with the classic keyboard/mouse combo, you'd be looking at some serious learning curve before you'd ever be anything but cannon fodder. In NFS III, the news gets better. The controller has a \"steering wheel\" controller that's more like a phone dial that snaps back to center. But using that along with Cyborg's \"joystick\" for acceleration/braking, I was able to be fairly competitive, though I was missing the more familiar wheel-with-pedals config. In NBA LIVE '99, Cyborg was passable, but because the game needs so many buttons for its varied APPEAL: Gamers looking for that mythical all-in-one game controller. PROS: Versatile; solid programming front-end good for large-hands; endeavors to be all things to all gamers. CONS: Winds up being so-so on all fronts; too many design trade-offs to list. REQUIREMENTS: Sound card with a 15-pin joystick port or free USB port Price: $49.95 Manufacturer: Saitek Torrance, CA (310) 212 5412 www.saitek.com functions, I found myself running out of buttons for my right hand (the left hand was handling D-pad chores). But because Cyborg uses so many axes, you can only have one attached to your system. So much for hot-seating. If you're a road-dog type who spends a lot of time travelling and your laptop has a joystick port (or USB), Cyborg might be a handy allin-control, though it might be a bit bulky to schlep in your laptop bag. Unless you're hell-bent to have only one controller, Cyborg 3D's trade-offs for the sake of versatility make it a so-so controller across the board. CGW photo: Michael Falconer REVIEW  MULTITECH MULTIMODEM USB GAMING Eat It, Wall-Wart EDITORS CHOICE Just plug it in and its installed! MultiModemUSB SAMA by Dave Salvator etween 1/0 resource conflicts and cantankerous BIOS issues found with some internal modems, external modems have always seemed much more COMPUTER GAMNG ***** WORLD straightforward to install and use. But one downside to externals has always been the dreaded wall-wart power supply. Enter MuliTech's MultiModem USB, an external V.90 (the new 56K standard) modem that connects via USB, where the modem sends its data, and get this, where it draws its power, eliminating the wall-wart completely. Installation couldn't be easier. Plug the modem into an open USB port, feed your computer one driver floppy disk, and you're done, sans reboot. The MultiModem USB uses the V.90 standard, and should be able to connect to any ISP support ing that standard. Because V.90 is the new single 56K standard, most ISPs are migrating to it. For testing purposes, I connected to Mindspring, a nationwide ISP that supports both X2 and V.90. This seemed like it would be a good test since the MultiModem uses a Lucent chipset, which formerly supported the K56Flex standard. Since Mindspring was an X2 ISP before adding V.90 support, I thought this combination might yield some compatibility glitch. It didn't. In fact, I consistently got connect speeds of 45.3Kbits/sec, which is pretty good. A USR Sportster external X2 modem making the same connection typically connected at 50Kbits/sec. I was hoping that MultiModem's USB connection might yield lower ping times than serial port-connected external modems. It didn't. In ping tests to Mindspring's terminal server, the first hop you go through in connecting to the Internet, MultiModem's ping times were in APPEAL: Gamers looking for an external 56K V.90 modem. PROS: Painless installation; no wall-wart; competitively priced, solid performance. CONS: Only 56K; no ping-time advantage over conventional modems. REQUIREMENTS: One free USB port Price: $145 Manufacturer: MultiTech Mounds View, MN (800) 328-9717 www.multitech.com the 90-100ms range, typical of 56K modems of all stripes. MultiTech's USB modem offers comparable performance to other 56K modems on the market, with the added benefit of its having no wall-wart, not to mention USB's dynamic disconnect/reconnect feature. It's priced well versus other external 56K offerings, so if you're current modem is running out of gas and you're looking to move up to a 56K modem, take a look at the MultiModem USB.

"REVIEW. HALF-LIFE GAMING EDITORS ACTULON New Killer in Town CHOICE CHOICE HALF-LIFE Is the Best, Scariest First-Person Shooter Since DOOM shooter, is not just one of the best games of the year. It's one of the best games of any year, an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition, and in its single-player formis the best shooter since the original DOOM. Plus, despite the fact that it's \"just\" a shooter, HALF-LIFE provides one of the best examples ever of how to present an interactive movie--and a great, scary movie at that. Research Facility and learning details of the game's storyline. You are Gordon Freeman, a 27-year-old Ph.D. in theoretical physics, now employed as a research associate at Black Mesa's \"Anomalous Materials Laboratory.\" After you exit the tram, the many scientists roaming the halls urge you to make your way toward the lab to assist in some kind of classified experiment. Once the experiment begins, however, catastrophe strikes, as a series of massive explosions signals the opening of a portal to an alien world. With the Research Facility now half destroyed and in utter chaos, you must make your way to the surface, avoiding the aliens who have transported inas well as the government troops assigned to \"contain\" the problem. DIE FOKKER This helicopter will annoy you for quite awhile in the game. Blowing it up later will make you very happy. COMPUTER WORLD GAMING  by Jeff Green f you were expecting the reasoned voices of CGW to douse the flames of the HALF-LIFE hype, forget about it. We're about to make it worse. So let's get this over with up front, and then we'll calm down and get to the details. Everything you've heard, everything you've hoped for-it's all true. HALF-LIFE, Valve Software's highly anticipated first-person Here Comes Your Man HALF-LIFE makes its brilliance apparent from the moment you boot the game. Instead of the usual lame cut-scene that looks nothing like the game you're about to play (remember QUAKE II?), you are thrust immediately into the gameworld. It's an illusion that's never shattered. No cut-scenes, no level \"briefing\" screens, no fragcount screens, no map. As in a real movie, the intention is to immerse you in the story. Other shooters have done this, too, of courseJEDI KNIGHT and Bungie's MARATHON series stand out as great examples—but no one before has carried it to this extreme, or pulled it off so well. As the opening credits roll, you find yourself on a transit car, descending deeper and deeper into the cavernous Black Mesa Federal APPEAL: Firstperson shooter fans, any gamer who thought they'd seen it all. PROS: Awesome storyline; intense nonstop action; scary monsters super creeps: atmospheric music and sound effects; inventive level design and weaponry. CONS: Some multiplayer lag and weirdness, screen is awfully dark at times; tons of platform-style puzzles may frustrate some gamers. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95/98/NT 4.0, Pentium 133,24MB RAM, 2x CDROM, 640x480 SVGA high-color (16-bit) display, Windows-compatible sound card. 3D SUPPORT: OpenGL or Direct3D. MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: LAN (2-8 players), Internet. Gouge Away Levels—at least as we've come to know them-don't really exist in HALF-LIFE. Instead the game comprises a series of titled chapters, each of which groups a number of minilevels into one cohesive unit. As a result, rather than forcing you to wait minutes for a huge level to load, like some games we could mention (SIN) but won't (FALLOUT 2), HALF-LIFE loads just a portion of the chapter at a time, as you play it. Aesthetically, it breaks the game into a number of settings, each one different from the next, each one offering a changing set of challenges and obstacles. In \"On a Rail\" you'll need to dodge a series of threats while riding a tram; in \"Apprehension\" you'll need to swim frantically through sunken rooms without drowning or getting eaten by giant alien fish; in Surface Tension, perhaps the game's best chapter, you'll have to fight an army of outrageously intelligent bad guys through a series of outdoor settings. Price: $48.99 Publisher: Sierra On-Line Bellevue, WA (425) 649-9800 TRAIN I RIDE HALF-LIFE's levels constitute an endless display of inventive design. One of the game's levels takes place almost entirely on a tram in Black Mesa's rail system. www.sierra.com 168 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. FEBRUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

I'm Amazed Although HALF-LIFE uses the QUAKE engine as its base, Valve reportedly rewrote about 70 percent of the code, and it shows. It might not be as \"beautiful\" as UNREAL, but it is an awesomelooking game nevertheless, especially with 3D acceleration. The environment feels alive, thanks to a number of great scripted events that trigger as you approach them. The atmospheric sound effects and voice work are equally great and add to the feeling of being kneedeep in a living nightmare. Overall, it's not one thing that makes HALF-LIFE great, it's the sum of all the parts—the extraordinary attention to detail. There are sequences in the game, like those of a great horror movie, that you'll be dying to talk about with your friends, scenes that you'll remember years from now: watching the scientists plunging down the bro ken elevator, getting attacked by a Headcrab for the first time, avoiding the ferocious swipes of the threetentacled monster, listening to the BADDER THAN THE REST Disgusting aliens abound in HALF-LIFE—but the toughest opponents of them all might be the other humans hunting you down. hushed footsteps of assassins as they ruthlessly hunt you down. We could go on and on. You can find things to quibble about if you really want to the screen is kind of dark at times, there's an awful lot of platformstyle jumping, the multiplayer experience can be erratic—but who cares with a game this great? Simply put, this is the gaming event of the season, and if you care at all about games you don't want to miss it. HALF-LIFE positively radiates with cool. CGW Jeff Green, when not having nightmares about Headcrabs, is losing at NBA LIVE 99 and still trying to make his way out of the Petrified Forest in GRIM FANDANGO. eed A or many shooter fans, the biggest question about HALF-LIFE is Does it rock in multiplayer mode? The short answer is, maybe. It's not as transcendent as the single-player game, but it's still quite good. Among the CGW goons, it's the first game to stand a real chance of replacing QUAKE Il as the deathmatch game of choice. The levels are large and well-balanced with weaponry. Wide-open rooms intermin gle with plenty of lurking places. Sniping is particularly satisfying thanks to the crossbow, probably the game's best weapon. A few new touches nicely enhance the standard deathmatch experience. First, the frag-count screen now shows a ratio of kills to deaths, which puts player performance in better perspective. Second, you can create logos (or use the defaults) and spray-paint them next to your buddies' rotting corpses on the game's floors and walls. Finally, all of the blood remains on the floors and walls throughout a deathmatch, so after a few minutes the level is awash with gore. It's gruesome, but for better or worse it accurately reflects the game's carnage. On the downside, lag seems to be a bit of a problem on some machines, and we experienced inexplicable crashes a number of times on different machines. The inability to reconfigure your setup without quitting a deathmatch first is also a curious design decision-we like being able to remap keys on the fly. Finally, the HALF-LIFE CD generously includes WorldCraft 2, which enables you to create your own levels a great touch in a game filled with great touches. We'll have more on HALF-LIFE's multiplayer action in next month's CGW along with some original tags on the CG-ROM. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. FEBRUARY 1999 169 "

"REVIEW SPACE BUNNIES MUST DIE TI Troma Raider This TOMB RAIDER Clone Sports a B-movie Sense of humor and Style While SPACE BUNNIES MUST DIE! doesn't quite live up to its gonzo plot, this third-person TOMB RAIDER clone is good fun to play. And, Allison can dance. But wait, there's more! You can dress her up in an assortment of outfits! (My fave: \"Truck Stop Waitress.\") mutant monsters and provides clues to finishing the level. Of course, each level also contains an assortment of weapon power-ups; health in the form of \"Zombie Juice\"; keys to open doors and extend ladders, carrots for the giant juicer machines; tiny 'copters to ride; levers to throw; ledges to scale; and plenty of bad guys to blast, nuke, frag, debone, or otherwise kill. bunny or runs over a power-up grow pretty stale well before the end of the game-as do the animations for saving your level, drinking zombie juice, and so forth. Levels start out pretty easy, but the need for fast action and fine timing grows as the game progresses. There are often multiple ways to run a level or even to reach a given goal-either scale the cliff or ride the raft, for Bunny Burrow to Hell Gameplay is mostly what you'd expect: running, jumping, climbing, by Mark Clarkson hey have it all: Young and beautiful, Allison Huxtor is a budding rodeo star; her sister Jocelyn seemingly destined to become the next Tammy Wynette. (The truck-stop waitress jobs are just temporary.) One night they run over a giant mutant bunny and Jocelyn is abducted by aliens. This leaves Allison no choice but to put her rodeoing, dancing, and waitressing skills to the test in the subterranean chambers of Lotar, king of the evil Space Bunnies, who has imprisoned Jocelyn and is forcing her to provide the living soundtrack to his perverse biological experiments and his plans for world domination. As Allison, you must infiltrate the Space Bunny complex and save Jocelyn...and, you guessed it, the world! DANCING FOOL. Even giant mutants such as this Bear/Rabbit will dance with Allison. Win him over...and you can ride that hideous freak out of the room and on to glory COMPUTER GAMING *** WORLD And you'll want to kill 'em once you've seen what they're up to. I mean, we all know that aliens mutilate cattle, but it obviously doesn't stop there: The bunny complex is crawling with zombified humans and horrible hybrids-half goat/half bunny, half bear/half bunny half vulture/half bunny...ick! EVERYBODY RUN! THAT CUTE PINK BUNNY HAS GOT A GUN! So shoot him repeatedly. APPEAL: Drive-in movie fans looking for a Lara Croft to call their own. PROS: Good sense of humor, some novel ideas, great soundtrack CONS: Occasional glitches; a bit shallow and repetitive; soso level design. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166, Windows 95/98, 32MB RAM, 150MB hard-drive space, 4x CD-ROM, VESA local bus or PCI video card with 1MB RAM, sound card. 3D SUPPORT: Direct 3D, 3Dfx.

You can only save your progress at designated kiosks; thankfully, however, they're sprinkled liberally through the levels. While SPACE BUNNIES was stable in general, l occasionally found myself stuck halfway in a mountainside. Overall, SPACE BUNNIES is fun in a campy, B-movie way, neither reinventing the genre nor pushing the technology envelope-just delivering solid fun. And, when there's no bunny around, Allison will dance just for you. Shake it, Baby. CGW crouching, collecting power-ups and opening doors. But there are unexpected goodies thrown in. After conquering one huge beast, you can ride him and use his supe rior strength to pry open heavy doors and bash lesser mutants on the head. Each level holds a CD which, when inserted into a convenient jukebox, plays one of Jocelyn's desperate songs, which seduces Shake it, Sweety Luckily, Allison can distract the bad bunny mutants by dancing to a rockin' collection of tunes by Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Southern Culture on the Skids, and others. Entranced, most Space Bunnies will eventually start dancing too, making them easy targets. Although the music and Allison's dance steps vary from level to level, the cute things she says when she kills a Right this minute, Mark Clarkson has the lights down low and is watching Allison do \"The Swim\" on the Bo Diddley level. 180 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"VIGILANCE. REVIEW Infernal Vigilance SegaSoft's Buggy GOLDENEYE Killer Manages to Assassinate Itself by Scott A. May oping to catch a ride on the latest shoot-em-up bandwagon, SegaSoft presents VIGILANCE, an awkward blend of the N64's GOLDENEYE and Sega's own VIRTUA SQUAD. Intrigued? Well, shoulder that rifle, soldier. The paper-thin storyline casts you in the role of one of eight counterterrorist agents, part of the Special Intelligence Operations Network (SION).

The 25 single player mission objectives are pretty standard stuff-kill the bad guys, infect an computer, blow up COMPUTER GAMING some equipment—though multiplayer mode cuts to the chase for some stealthy assassin fun. The major hook of VIGILANCE lies not in its 3D-rendered worlds, its cache of sexy weapons, or multiplayer mayhem.

"REVIEWS Fly-By Shooting Wreak Havoc From Above in These Airborne Titles Plane Crazy man Publisher: SegaSoft Price: $29.95 www.segasoft.com/planecrazy 3D-enhanced fantasy flying game, PLANE CRAZY is a Mbeautifully rendered speed with a low frustration threshold, beware. Other features include both good and bad power-ups and eight tenacious, computer-controlled competitors. The game's coolest twist arms you with a sonic cannon, which can reveal hidden shortcuts through the courses. The 3D graphics are spectacular, with excellent use of color, fog and haze effects, and fiery concussion rings. Although gameplay eventually becomes repetitive, the quest for the best possible racing line through the multitude of courses helps extend gameplay If you're a diehard arcade racing nut, PLANE CRAZY delivers the goods. If you're hoping for more realworld substance, keep biding your time. -Scott A. May you higher rank, which gets you the tougher assignments, and cash, so you can visit the company store and upgrade your Nanochine. FLY HUNTER requires skill and reflexes, especially considering the less than responsive controls. Unfortunately, the game compounds frustration by lacking a quick-save or restart feature, so if you're swarmed by killer bees, you're doomed to return to main screen and start again. And the Al bugs are tough to beat at even the easiest of settings. FLY HUNTER will let you take on insects as well as fellow Nanocorp pilots via LAN, IPX, modem, or serial connections. But given its touchy controls, unfriendly save feature, and lackluster graphics, you might be better off killing this bug dead. Raphael Liberatore demon with few real-world trappings. Conceptually, it's nothing new, combining the graphic splendor of Rage's INCOMING with the full-throttle speed of Gremlin's 1995 fantasy racer, SLIPSTREAM 5000, with a bit of Psygnosis' WIPEOUT added for good measure. You choose one of three aircraft to compete on nine outdoor courses, each an insane ride through convoluted, elaborately detailed landscapes, including desert canyons, seaside refineries, volcanic rapids, and urban sprawl. Modes of play include Quick Race, Ghost Race-in which you compete against your own best score-and the multicourse Championship Race. This last mode plays reasonably well with both LAN and HEAT.NET multiplayer matchups. Your biggest challenge is to find the shortest, fastest path through each obstacle-laden landscape. Touchy controls compound your need for a good eye and lightning reflexes. As you earn your wings, expect to bounce around the narrow lanes like an airborne pinball before exploding in a fireball. Those impervious to damage, and loaded with unlimited countermeasures and fuel. What's more, by lacking the interludes that made STRIKE COMMANDER interesting, FIGHTER PILOT remains pedestrian in all respects. The plot in FIGHTER PILOT is simple, even simplistic: The Iraqis have been acting up again and it's up to you to stop them. You get a linear set of missions: Fly here, kill this, repeat. Enemies are numerous and well armed, but thanks to a desultory Al and your nigh invulnerable aircraft, you'll make quick work of them. The Jane's F-15 engine used here is out of place in an action game. Frame rates on high-end PCS are occasionally choppy. Attempts were made to max out F-15's combat visuals, but the results aren't up to modern action game standards. The audio presentation is similarly tame. The final blow is the game's sedate pace, which leaves you yearning for some adrenalinefilled moments. FIGHTER PILOT needed a clearer focus: EA wanted AFTERBURNER, but ended up with a watered-down STRIKE COMMANDER. The limited set of single-player missions provides little variety or challenge. Surprisingly, multiplayer doesn't support a convenient matchmaking service. Throw in graphics more suited for a hard-core simulation and you've got a game that's like a TV dinner: not bad, but very, very bland. --Chase Dahl Fly Hunter * ** ** Publisher: Nanotainment Price: $49.95 www.nanotainment.com f you hate bugs and love weird shooters, FLY HUNTER is for you.

Kim hat does it take to earn the forgiveness of gamers burned by a buggy product? Usually, a timely bug fix patch or two is enough.

The stand-alone missions were picked from online submissions, so at least they're not just randomly picked Net filler. This is an average mission pack.

The city background is HARDWAR's strongest feature; little new ground is broken in gameplay. You start out with a poorly equipped MOTH and a small bankroll, with the goal of improving both. The action involves establishing lucrative trade routes, defending yourself against pirates, hunting down miscreants for cash, and fitting new components to your MOTH. As the game progresses, you'll be allowed to begin the missions that make up the meat of HARDWAR's plot. You run around upsetting the powerful, out-ofcontrol factions of the city. Although you uncover interesting secrets, the plot-related missions are too few and unevenly spaced HARDWAR is fun for a while, but the possibilities are quickly exhausted. The limited trading, interaction, and combat become r epetitive. Once you've completed the game's scripted missions, there's little reason to go back to the city.

That term conjures up images of The Ten Commandments or Lawrence of Arabia, but not of, say, THE CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND or FULL THROTTLE. Yet, Tim Schafer's newest adventure game, GRIM FANDANGO, fits the criteria quite well. It forges totally new ground for LucasArts by presenting their most ambitious and complex plot yet-all within a package that offers stunning art direction, an original and intelligent script, traditional puzzle design, and great voice acting. and more sarcastic in tone.

"GRIM FANDANGO. REVIEW ADVENTUREZRPG were) with outstanding dialog and voice acting. Some of the characters are movie allusions, such as Chowchilla Charlie's resemblance to Peter Lorre's Ugarte in Casablanca, or Domino Hurley's resemblance to Al Pacino's Roma in Glengarry Glen Ross. Others are wholly original creations, such as Manny's car-crazy sidekick Glottis, or the one-armed revolutionary who, appropriately enough, is robbing slot machines. The characters are so unique that you end up remembering them much more vividly than the stock NPCs in other adventure games. A musical score that is a good mix of swing, bebop, jazz, and spiritual South American folk music accompanies the art to complete the experience. The puzzle design is usually fair and logical. Since you can only display one object at a time, don't expect to combine items within your inventory. The game is generally nonlinear—the Years have goals, and you're essentially given free reign regarding in what order those goals are achieved. The puzzles are traditional LucasArts fare. In terms of difficulty, the puzzles are the kind in which you fiddle around for a few hours, only to have some divine inspiration later on and then hit yourself for not noticing the logic earlier. I was annoyed with a few puzzles (mostly the forklift), but overall found them to be forgiving and not to require far-out logic. Playing a few hours per day, it took me about a week to finish. So 20 to 30 hours of play, based on skill, is a good estimate for how long this game takes. \"Those Are Harsh Words to Throw at a Man...\" Unfortunately, with such a great game the flaws stand out even more. In my opinion the biggest flaw is the interface. While it is better than most third-person-on-abackground interfaces, there are a few problems that detract from gameplay. For instance, the way Manny's head turns when he notices a hotspot is good, but this would be improved greatly if items WHEN A DOOR IS AJAR The puzzles tend to be pretty traditional, with were highlighted when occasional exceptions, such as this annoying timed puzzled involving an ever he looked at them so elevator and a forklift. that you knew exactly what you were looking at.

"COMPUTER REVIEW  JOHN SAUL'S BLACKSTONE CHRONICLES GAMING Chronicle of Terror EDITORS CHOICE Legend Entertainment's BLACKSTONE Is a Brilliant Psychological Thriller by Allen Greenberg omputer gamers are insane. This is a fact that does not often arise during polite conversation; however it is nonetheless, the truth. It is, perhaps, for this reason that author John Saul has brilliantly crafted an adventure chronicling the ultimate fate of those who are far more psychotic than gamers. This leads you to question whether those of us who spend our nights typing and mouse-clicking away will not one day, find ourselves as spirits haunting the rooms, chairs, and desks that we voraciously refused to vacate during our lifetimes. I'm Feeling Better Now JOHN SAUL'S BLACKSTONE CHRONICLES is appropriately subtitled AN ADVENTURE IN TERROR. It's the story of a former insane asylum and its patients whose ghostly spirits are unable to vacate their lifetime residence. It's also the story of the family who ran the asylum, a member of which also haunts the place, and his living son who is attempting to break free from its influence. You are the son, Oliver Metcalf. Your father, Malcolm Metcalf, was the last director of the asylum before its closure.

"REVIEW. JOHN SAUL'S BLACKSTONE CHRONICLES POINT OF VIEW 2X ADVENTUREZRPG fullest. Malcolm, in particular, leaves you guessing about whether he is actually a mad scientist or the devil himself. Oddly enough, there is actually a soothing quality to the muted tones of the asylum interior and to the voiceovers, which makes the game that much more compelling. Finally, a great deal of care has gone into the background score which, far from becoming tedious, deftly elevates the quality and tension of each setting. In addition to the spirits you will meet, you will find the asylum filled with display cases in preparation for the opening of the museum. For the most part the cases contain objects that you are free to take. There is a musical chime that signals when you have taken the proper item for your inventory, which is unlimited in size. The display cases also contain quite a bit of text concerning the history of the asylum as well as the sequences in which this is not the case and you must perform the desired action within a limited interval-or die. The program is most forgiving at these points, however, and following your death will, if you wish, actually tell you the solution to saving your life and then place you back to one step before the deadly sequence begins. As in most adventure games, there is no score to be achieved and thus no penalty for taking advantage of this service. BLACKSTONE CHRONICLES uses most of the traditional adventure game devices. It is controlled entirely with the mouse and features a first-person perspective of Malcolm or from one of the other spirits. Alternately, a text box may appear giving you two or more actions from which to choose. Conversation with the spirits is accomplished using the traditional multiple choice responses. For the most part, you are encouraged to try every one of the statements or questions that are available to you during a conversation. There is no danger in doing so it's simply part of collecting information. The program is provided on two CD-ROMs. However, once it's installed on your hard drive you need only use one of the disks to play the game. Which one you choose will depend on your hardware. One of the disks contains higher-resolution graphics and thus supports higher-end machines. Disk-switching, thus, is not a required activity. Computer gamers are not really insane (not most of them, anyway). and I apologize profusely to anyone who might have been offended by that statement. I was simply struck by the high moral caliber of the insane characters in this story. In any event, BLACKSTONE CHRONICLES is definitely a nlike say, in MYST, you do meet up with characters in the form of lost souls inhabiting various areas of the Blackstone asylum. This young woman was institutionalized because she supposedly had a false pregnancy, yet she seems to recall vivid details about her child. You must help her resolve this situation and find some sort of peace a nice departure from the typical \"get the key and open the door\" adventure puzzle. unique piece of work with a gripping storyline, wonderful graphics, and a most talented cast. It should not be missed. CGW Allen Greenberg has been reviewing adventure games in CGW since 1991, and he is hoping GABRIEL KNIGHT 3 ships before he really goes insane. PUZZLE ME THIS The solutions to some puzzles are fairly simple, such as the lockers in the basement (bottom). Others, as when you are strapped into an electroshock chair (top), must be solved within a time limit-or you die. history of \"curing\" the insane. There is, however, a fine line between \"cure\" and \"torture,\" and so much of this text is like the graphics, not for the squeamish. Once you uncover it, Malcolm's diary is also quite disturbing. the asylum's interior, which scrolls forward and pans right or left. The various positions to which you can move are fixed, but the scrolling process is impressively smooth and allows you to view the scenery as you move. It is important to examine your surroundings from every angle at each position lest you miss some important detail. The arrowshaped cursor lights up when it passes over some object or location that you may wish to question. The response to clicking on it may come in the form of a statement from Traditional, but Excellent Most of the game's puzzles and challenges allow you to take all the time you wish since the story is generally not moving ahead in real time. However, there are several WHO NEEDS A HALBERD? This museum piece shows the late Malcolm's fondness for medieval weaponry. But nothing this knight carries can touch the torture devices you find later in the game all used in the name of science. 212 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. FEBRUARY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

When booting up NBA LIVE on my home machine, which doesn't have a full-time Internet connection, the game kept trying to dial my ISP, and when I canceled out of the dial-up and tried to toggle back into the game, it would lock up my system, forcing a hard reboot.

"REVIEW  NHL 99 CAMING Hockey Heaven EDITORS CHOICE SPORTS RACING The Best Gets Better, as EA Sports Scores Big With NHL 99 by Gordon Goble s the years pass, the athletics known as EA Sports continues to flex its muscle, expanding its roster to include most every sport known to modern man. Baseball, basketball, professional and college football, soccer, rugby, golf, even Australian rules football-it's all been part of EA's quest for total domina tion. There's little doubt, however, that the uppermost jewel in the EA Sports crown is shaped like a little hockey stick. boards, each player topped with their helmeted real-life face, and the puck is dropped. Immediately, a PIP camera zooms in on the Philly penalty box as John LeClair gets ready to return to the ice. Back at even strength with time running out, you direct a fine three-way pass. ing play between Danius Zubrus, Lindros and LeClair, with Big John slamming home a 20-foot wrist shot top shelf over a besieged Curtis Joseph. Official scorers delay the game momentarily checking for a crease violation (NHL 99 reflects the latest scaleddown crease, by the way) but the purpose-built goal cam proves the play is clean. The goal stands, the rink announcer confirms the details and the crowd boos vociferously as flashbulbs pop. Justifiably gloating, you switch to the replay. Here, you opt to move from the overhead camera For the better part of a decade, EA's outrageously successful NHL hockey series has defined, rede fined, and set the trends and style for computer sports, and sold a gazillion copies along the way. This despite the fact that knowledgeable hockey fans and some loudmouthed critics-yours truly included-consistently poke holes in the NHL umbrella, knocking this otherwise brilliant game for its artificial intelligence quirks. It was NHL 98, however that the franchise began to show signs of awakening from its gameplay slumber, finally shedding itself of some of its more bizarre characteristics And so it continues with the sixth in the series, NHL 99, quite possibly the first installment that'll please just about everyone.

SPORTS RACING you'd chosen for gameplay, watching and editing your moment of glory from all eight available and often free-floating cameras. Now you've got the time to take in all the game's visual perks up close and personal: reflective ice surfaces with team-specific logos, graphic-stuffed boards, flying ice chips, real 2D fans, and an accurate realtime scoreboard suspended above the ice. Sadly, you'll also notice that that the rather ugly 2D puck becomes absolutely monstrous up close (often larger than the goalie's trapper!) and may sometimes appear to sit behind the net when it is actually inside it Furthermore, stick and player perspectives can be decidedly wonky from certain angles. Yet, what's important to remember is that NHL 99's graphics and audio are so good, so comprehensive, and so far ahead of the competition that they can only be compared to real life. And in that respect, perfection is very hard to attain. The fact is that the game is close enough to be compared, and that's certainly good enough for me. do speed bursts send players streaking at three times their normal skating ability.

Yet even with all the gameplay improvements, NHL continues to baffle in a few areas, most notably during power plays. For example, penalty-killing Al teams with a small box formation refuse to break from their pre-defined boundaries even if the puck sits alone and untouched right there in their own corner. And dang it if the game still doesn't magically improve the skill and ability of the penalty-killing team, cranking up the goal-scoring chances should a human-driven team get any sort of shorthanded opportunity. Of additional concern is the fact that after all these years the program, not the man at the helm, may decide certain results. To wit, human Washington blows out Al Philadelphia with an 83-39 SOG differential only to lose 6-2. Alternatively, Al puck-carriers have been known to become completely inactive when faced with a yawning empty net just five feet away. Why? Because the program didn't want them to score, that's why. Granted, this sort of thing is now exceedingly rare and can sometimes be chalked up to bad luck, but it does have its impact. The Play's the Thing As for gameplay, well, let's just say it's getting awfully tough to call this the forgotten element in the NHL series. I'm especially impressed with the game's depiction of players as reactive humans with appendages and sticks as opposed to being mere blobular masses. Players can block passes or otherwise affect the puck's progress with individually mobile parts of their body or stick, not just their trunk. And they'll do the same to other players too, clutching and grabbing and reaching with a leg or arm-just as in real life. And though EA has always said their players mimic their real-life namesakes, it's never been this dramatic. Now, Dominic Hasek really is the acrobatic marvel he is in the real world, frustrating Gold Medal Overall, though, it boils down to this. Is this the finest EA Sports NHL game to date? Yes. Does that mean it's the finest PC hockey to date? Yes again. You just know EA Sports will be at it once more this time next year, but NHL 99 is here now and its currently as good as it gets.

"REVIEW  VR BASEBALL 2000 Platoon Player SPORT SZRACING VR BASEBALL 2000 Shows Promise but Lacks Tools of an All-Star BOT 210 by Robert Coffey nderstand one thingI really like this game. It looks beautiful, plays great, and keeps me coming back for more. But like Bill Buckner watching a routine grounder roll right between his legs, it fails to execute the fundamental things that would make it the undisputed MVP in PC baseball games. LET'S PLAY TWO With state-of-the-art graphics and realistic play, VR BASEBALL 2000 is seductive enough to turn a quick exhibition game into an impromptu doubleheader. Godlike Graphics The first game to use Shiny's much vaunted Messiah technology, VR BASEBALL 2000 is the best looking baseball title on the market. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the player uniforms-made hugely glaring problems; instead, there are a host of little niggling things that add up and just kick this game repeatedly in the shins. While you can tweak difficulty levels in all areas of play, you can't tweak actual play by repositioning hitters in the batter's box. You can move your outfielders all around the field, but you can't move your infielders at all. You can customize your gamepad controls, but only to a point. Don't get me started on the phenomenally unintuitive double switch interface. Lacking a draft, there's no way to customize a league with your friends unless you execute a series of trades and make the Marlins your dream team. Even then, you'll still be playing games against CPUcontrolled misfit squads since there's no way to create a league with less than 28 teams. League play also suffers from a lack of realistic pitcher managementwhile hurlers fatigue (too quickly by the way) over the course of a game, they don't fatigue game to game. This means you can start Greg Maddux every single game of the season. This sounds appealing until you realize that your buddy is starting Pedro Martinez every day.

Player animations are smooth and lifelike; unfortunately, initial shipments of the game were marred by visible gaps at player joints that left the sluggers with segmented legs and detached heads. A patch has since been released that fixed this and the weird, hideously angular camera movements that made tracking fly balls unnecessarily difficult. Sadly, the patch hasn't rectified sporadic game crashes. VR BASEBALL 2000 serves up a fairly realistic simulation of play.

Sadly, it had me wondering who thought this would be a good idea. The premise of the game is good—if somewhat narrowly focused. 101 is a turn-based wargame that puts you in charge of a \"stick\" of individual paratroopers. Scattered, injured, and possibly without some of your equipment, you must overcome tough German defenses using 101's X-COMlike game system. Unfortunately, 101 fails to deliver on virtually every level on which a computer game could be judged. In terms of concept, COMPUTER MING CN SCATTER, SCATTER I did better than usual on this drop: Almost 40 percent of my troops survived to reach the landing site. Of course, they have no equipment. didn't have a problem with the interface-giving orders was easy, and the game comes with some useful command touches, such as waypoints. I do have a problem, however, with the way mapping is handled. Simply put your map is way too small. Even though your missions take place over relatively large areas, you can operate only within a very constricted \"tile\" at any one time. Given the current massive memory capabilities of the typical PC, I cannot imagine why this is necessary for a state-of-theart strategy game. To make matters worse, you cannot exit a map while there are any live Germans left on it. Bypass the enemy? Perish the thought. 101 simply doesn't operate well as a game. For me, there's nothing worse than having to constantly reload a saved game to overcome some random occurrence that makes victory impossible. Yet 101 is riddled with such situations. When you leave England (after spending a fair amount of time selecting and outfitting your men) you run the risk of having your transport shot down before you can drop. Game over. If you survive the flak, each soldier that jumps runs the risk of being shot on the way down, blown off course and lost, or injured upon landing. It's not unusual to lose up to half your men before the game even starts. I once started with a surviving 5 out of 18.

"SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION Published by EIDOS INTERACTIVE WARZONE THE NEXT DIMENSION IN STRATEGY EIDOS THIS MONTH WE PLAN TO GET THE LOW-DOWN ON A AODD GAME THAT LOOKS TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE REAL TIME STRATEGY GENRE. THE GAME IS WARZONE 2100 in the game is the recovery and research of artifacts from before the nuclear holocaust. As these are researched, new weapons, propulsions, structures, etc, become available to the player. As a result, players can decide what technologies they want to research as the game progresses. And as artifacts are researched, new vehicle types can be designed. AND WE ARE CHATTING WITH JIM BAMBRA, DIRECTOR OF PROJECTS AT PUMPKIN STUDIOS. Pumpkin Studios ith all the strategy game clones and numerous sequels what makes Warzone 2100 better than the rest? Warzone 2100 is fully 3D with indepth game play and blisteringly fast action. The graphical effects are stunning and make use of every aspect of the 3D technology. The arc over mountains and Strike VTOLS (Vertical Take-off and Landing Aircraft) roar overhead. Being able to track units using the camera further enhances this 3D experience. With this feature you can order a VTOL strike then follow them in as they fly down the valleys then fly over the top of the mountains to fire their rockets at their target. You can even switch between groups and watch the camera pan to each group, creating a very dynamic gaming experience. Once you get used to rotating, zooming and tilting the map, and tracking your units with the camera, there's no going back to static 2D displays. Full use is made of 3D accelerator cards to create vibrant lighting and explosion effects. Rockets fire with a smoke trail, artillery and cannon shells explode gratuitously, and flamers ignite enemy units and structures. When units take damage they emit smoke the more damage, the more smoke. When they explode, shards of metal and concrete fly across the screen. You can always spot where the action is by the amount of smoke and explosions going off! Warzone 2100 is set after the nuclear holocaust. The main drive The design sequence is very easy to use. It uses three components: Turret, Body and Propulsion. As research progresses, new components become available, making for thousands of different vehicle designs. Each weapon has its own characteristics flamers set enemies on fire, but are vulnerable to enemy attacks. Cannons are great for damaging other tanks and have great damage resistance. But for killing infantry and cyborgs you can't beat a machine gun. Antitank rockets do lots of damage, but are slow to fire you soon learn to use hit and run tactics with them. Mortars can fire shells over hills, and howitzers can fire over large distances. 3D is used to create a very vibrant game world where artillery shells Udk "

The open-ended campaign system makes this a reality. It's possible for the first few units you started the game with to achieve elite status and still be alive at the end of the game. Not that light scout vehicles would be much use to you once the more high tech weapons come into play. But by recycling your veteran units you can transfer their experience to bigger and better vehicles as the game progresses! we could have strike aircraft actually flying above the terrain as they let loose a load of rockets! Without 3D these units appear no different to any other. A 3D gaming world presented so many exciting opportunities to us, that there was simply no other way we would have developed Warzone 2100. Jim Bambra, Director of Projects at Pumpkin Studios. The propulsions add even more options. Wheels make for very fast vehicles, but with low damage capacity. Put tracks on your vehicle and your tank doesn't move as fast, but it can take a lot more damage. Hovers give you increased speed and zoom across water, but are very vulnerable to enemy attacks keep them moving and you'll survive; let the enemy guns lock on and you're dead. As I mentioned earlier the VTOL aircraft make great use of the 3D terrain as they fly through valleys and bomb the ememy. It looks very cinematic and gives you a great feeling as the tank hunter missiles take out the enemy armor. Meanwhile the enemy anti-aircraft batteries are filling the sky with flak and SAMs. It's real touch and go whether your VTOLs will make it out of the target zone or not. In old And finally, we have dedicated commanders who direct the fire of other units and who can order Why is the unit design so important to the game? The research and design sequences in Warzone 2100 really open up your options as a game player. You're never restricted to the units we give you! The 3-part design system of turret, body and propulsion offers over 2,000 .. possible combinations. Using it you can create fast scout vehicles, lumbering main battle tanks, strike aircraft, and amphibious hovercraft. It gives you the opportunity to create lots of different vehicles to suit your style of play and current mission objectives. Even similar vehicles will perform very differently if you change the turret from a heavy cannon to an antiaircraft battery. It no longer Another key point is the fully expanding campaign where your base lasts throughout the first campaign. The first mission is to establish your base. In subsequent missions you upgrade the base and add more defences and fortifications to it. We achieved this by using large maps that expand as the game progresses. Once the first mission is completed, the map expands to the south. We then fly in a transporter that lets the player fly units to mission sites on different maps. While on an away mission you still have access to your factories, research facilities and units back at home base. You can produce more tanks and have them flown in to the away maps as reinforcements. So you get to select what reinforcements you need, deciding on the tactical situation and your own style of play. reinforcements directly from factories. style 2D isometric games your aircraft are just a group of sprites moving over the landscape. In Warzone 2100, aircraft really do fly! Other than graphical eye candy, how do you utilize the 3D terrain? The 3D terrain is vital to the game play. It gives Warzone 2100 true line-of-sight and fog-of-war effects. Until you drive around the hills and mountains you can't see what's hidden behind them. Enemy mortar batteries may be lurking functions as a battle tank, but as a very effective aircraft killer. In many ways its like the real world in World War II the M4 Sherman chassis was used to turn out a wide variety of vehicles all suited to different combat roles. Warzone 2100 makes available so many more options. Why a full 3D game engine? What did you think it would bring to the game? A 3D game engine gives you a much more dynamic and exciting environment to game in. Isometric and top-down gaming worlds are abstract representations of reality. A 3D engine gives you the feeling that you're really there. It's very exciting watching units manoeuvre over realistic looking terrain, particularly when you can rotate and tilt the landscape so that you set at what angle you view them. After three away missions the action returns to an expanded campaign map. This time the enemy invade your base. As more missions unfold, new maps appear and the campaign map expands again. It all makes for a very exciting gaming experience with a definite sense of progression and plot revelation. The second and third campaigns follow a similar structure but with more twists and turns as the action really heats up! I've always wanted to do a more open-ended game where units Every RTS game claims to have the latest and greatest artificial intelligence. What really makes the Al in Warzone 2100 really stand out?

It looks like you are doing all these cool fighting-game style moves, but actually the game takes your character's skill into account and extrapolates what you are trying to do. Revenant is a traditional RPG with some unique twists. Tell us what makes Revenant an appealing game. Tell us about the magic system and how it is used in the game. Ahh, the magic system. This is our piece-de-resistance. We have a detailed magic system that involves finding various Talismans that are hidden throughout the game. Most of these Talismans have no power on their own, but when put in the proper combinations, and with the appropriate skill level, you can create effects such as a meteor strike, fireball, chain-lightning, and the end-all-be-all of spells: the Apocalypse. All the spell effects are generated in 3D and take advantage of the great graphical effects that the major 3D cards give you, so they are top-notch! Even the simplest of spells is a visual feast! Revenant offers over 30 Non-playable characters to interact with. Revenant combines the traditional elements of a Computer roleplaying game (multiple skills, a variety of weapons and combat styles, and an intriguing spell system) with those of a Console RPG (well crafted story-line, overtoo long. Final Fantasy VII went a long way in closing this gap, and we think Revenant can complete the job. the-top spell effects, and an arcady combat system). We think that we have combined the best elements of both types to bridge the gap that has existed between the Console and Computer RPG genres for far How much gameplay is there in the game? We are looking at a game that would take an expert Role Player around 30 to 40 hours to complete. What does Revenant bring to the CRPG genre that is new and innovative? Well, a couple of things. First off, we are utilizing a combination of 3D graphics and static pre-rendered backgrounds. The result is absolutely stunning. We enlisted the aid of fantasy artist Den Beauvais in doing some of the concept art and the result is amazing. You look like you are playing right in one of Den's paintings! Also, we have a more interactive combat system than most players are used to. It's all real-time, so you will have to think on your feet, and it's more detailed in its action than simply clicking the mouse to attack. We have different strikes and combination moves that your character learns as you advance in the Revenant world. The best part is that all the cool combos and moves are primarily based on your Revenant has a revolutionary real time combat system featuring interactive attacks, combinations, and fatalities.

As for the weather effects we don't go overboard, but the player is capable of controlling the weather through spells, i.e. summoning hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards. I think it is very important. Most gamers out there have seen fantasy art before and the level of detail that those artists put into their work shows a devotion and love for the genre that a real gamer can empathize with. I think that Revenant's art is on the same level as those brilliant works of fantasy art. What we add is the fact that it is interactive. Instead of dreaming that you are that character in the painting, you control him, move him, fight with him, and cast spells with him. Revenant features a dynamic colored lighting system that brings the Revenant world alive. Give us a quick synopsis of the story. You are Locke D'Averam. You have been dead for a millennium. You start the game resurrected and have no idea of your past. You are given a control Locke with that and get an immense amount of control at your Multiplay could be one of the most important facets of this game. Tell us how you plan on setting it up. Well, originally we were planning on having co-operative multiplay through the storyline, but upon closer examination, we determined that the story of Revenant didn't really lend itself to a party of characters. The story was conceived as a single player game from the start. What we are planning on including for the multiplay is the ability to play certain areas of the game (dungeons, caves, temples) as single levels for competitive play for up to eight players. We have four character classes to choose from, each with their own powers and abilities. The art for Revenant is stunning. How important is this to the gameplay and the whole Revenant Experience?

The Phase Talisman manipulates the dimensional fabric of Ur itself. This can be a time-space issue, or an outof-phase issue, such as invisibility. When combined with additive talismans like Chaos and Power, Phase spells can be very powerful. unpredictable forces which can be as much a boon as burden to the spellcaster. The spellcaster can combine the additive talismans of Sky and Chaos and add some extra effect to the standard Electrical Bolt spell. An example of a Phase spell would be Invisibility, which uses a Phase Talisman in conjunction with the Chaos and Body Talismans. Frost Spells: Two ends of Ur are covered in ice and snow. The native spellcasters of these areas tapped into the power of Frost and created special talismans. These talismans are extremely cold to the touch, and are constantly covered in a crust of ice. This is one of the most flexible of the talismans and nearly every additive talisman can be combined to the Frost Talisman. One very potent combination is the Death Surge spell which combines the Sky Talisman and the Lightning Talisman. This allows the spellcaster a greater attack range. Only the most skilled spellcaster can unleash the power of the Apocalypse Spell. create a spell that would even intimidate Mother Nature! Earth Spells: The ground beneath one's feet is at your command with the Earth Talisman. This talisman allows the spellcaster to manipulate the rocks and dirt everywhere on Ur, and even beyond. Experienced spellcasters can add the Chaos Talisman or even the Power Talisman to the Earth Talisman with deadly results for the enemy. The Maelstrom spell assaults a group of enemies from a variety of random directions: very disconcerting! This spell is constructed with the Wind, Chaos and Sky Talismans and takes a spellcaster of some renown and talent to create. Life Spells: The Talisman of Life is one of the most powerful talismans out there. It was created to magically heal wounds and restore the life-energy of beings. The Talisman of Life can be combined with several additive talismans, such as motion and power to give an added effect .i.e. healing more severe wounds and in its strongest incarnation, bringing the dead back to life. By adding the Sky and Power talismans to the Frost Talisman, a high-level spellcaster can summon an Ice Storm to pelt his enemies with. This spell is most effective outdoors as opponents have less access to shelter where they will surely want to seek cover! Adding Chaos and Sky talismans to the Earth Talisman will give the spellcaster control of chunks of rocks in the heavens above which can then be rained upon the battlefield. This spell, which is call the Meteor Strike, is one of the most difficult to cast. Only the best spellcaster can pull it off without killing himself. Talismans Flame Spells: SUN LIFE Lightning Spells: OCEAN The Fire Talisman is one of the strongest primordail forces. Flame Talismans enable the spellcaster to safely utilize the power of naked fire. An experienced spellcaster can combine Flame Talismans with the Motion and Chaos Talismans to produce the extremely powerful Fireswarm spell. Rumors abound about a Hellfire spell that uses a wide variety of additive talismans and is fabled to be the cause of the Great Crater of Navaroo. The power and fury of the storm is contained in the Lightning Talisman. When first touched, the Lightning Talisman will give off a small static shock. Lightning is one of the most LAW An example of a Life Spell is the Resting Spell. This spell is created by adding in the Motion and Body Talismans to the Life Talisman.

"KKND 2. REVIEW Not Too Special K A Konsumate Klone, KKND2: KROSSFIRE Won't Klaim the Real Time Krown STRATEGYZWAR. by Tom Chick can only imagine the development meetings: \"What about Fold, Spindle, 'n' Mutilate? Come, See, 'n' Conquer? Wash, Rinse, 'n' Repeat?\" When someone came up with Krush, Kill, 'n' Destroy the name stuck. Strangely, there's no mention of what the initials stand for in this sequel to KKND, an RTS that stood out from the legion of clones with its silly name. But even with KKND2, there's no reprieve; the subtitle KROSSFIRE evokes images of Pat Buchanan and Michael Kinsley locked in mortal kombat on KNN (the Kable News Network). LEARNING TO CRAWL The Evolved, as the mutants call themselves, crawl out of the muck to wreak some urban renovation. Kollect, Klick, 'n' Kommand KROSSFIRE preserves the expected RTS mechanics with only a few variations. In fact, it's almost a COMPUTER return to the basics. With only a single resource and no units with spell-like abilities, this game hearkens back to COMMAND AND CONQUER with its clean emphasis on the messy art of combat. The balance is slightly skewed to favor the defensive, so there are no quick and easy tank rushes. But if that's your style, the game ships with a surprisingly comprehensive unit editor. In fact, with the exception of a unit graphics editor and a few of the map tilesets, KROSSFIRE has completely open architecture along the lines of DARK REIGN. Using a shallow variation on STARCRAFT's three races, KROSSFIRE pits three postnuclear holocaust races against each other: human survivalists who holed up in bunkers; organically based mutants who weathered the radioactive firestorms; and the Series 9 agricul tural robots who found themselves out of work. These three races play by the same mechanics with only minor exceptions. But they're drawn with bright, bold cartoonish graphics and nicely fleshed out in amusing premission briefings. The game's intro-which looks like the sort of expensive cinematic only Activision or Origin can afford-is indicative of the entertaining multimedia flash you'll enjoy during the campaigns. In fact KROSSFIRE's humorous atmosphere is rivaled only by its solid gameplay. Instead of units with special abilities, KROSSFIRE lets you build customized units that you research one component at a time. This introduces some great variations in gameplay. Do you build mobile radar to scout your perimeters? Do you protect your infantry in a cloaked, armored personnel carrier? Or do you just slap the biggest gun on the biggest chassis and sit out the long build time? Furthermore, units can become veterans with experience and there GAMING **** WORLD APPEAL: RTS fans nostalgic for the days before resource manage ment and units with spell abilities.

"REVIEW ENEMY INFESTATION Just Another Bug Hunt TRATEGYZWAR This Real-time Strategy Game Rewards Patience, Not Reflexes rescue: With relatively few units, could simply assign key characters to a numbered hot-key. an orbital beam weapon struck. After a nail-biting rush through the facility, I missed the goal by 4 seconds, only to be told that they were kidding and I had another 15 minutes. Rather than feeling grateful, I felt cheated because I'd pushed so hard. by Loyd Case ith Geiger-like alien monsters, a spooky musical score, and weapons crafted out of ordinary objects, ENEMY INFESTATION IS obviously inspired by the Alien movies. Although it's a real-time strategy game, it's paced more like a turn-based game, rewarding patience over frantic mouse-clicking. However, be warned that this strategy game has a strong puzzle element. It's not quite as rigid as COMMANDOS, but you can't afford to lose certain key characters. Murder by Numbers Most missions follow a set pattern. First, gather everyone together. They are often in widely separated groups, so this can be quite a challenge. Second, find the medbay, which allows you to heal your characters. Third, if there's a weapons research objective, figure out how to solve that puzzle. Fourth, go bug hunting. Fifth, wrap up any other objectives. The pacing and number of units are such that you can move units around carefully (and you should), so it doesn't feel as frantic as most real-time games-something I appreciated. POWER SHORTAGE While you'll have access to some pretty powerful weaponry, recharging your guns will keep you waiting. And waiting. And waiting... Riddle Me This In the opening cut-scene, a meteorite crashes on a world recently colonized by humans. Out of the meteorite slithers a horde of COMPUTER monsters that slowly take over the colony sites. As you unravel the mystery of the alien horde, you'll ask yourself some questions. Why do the advanced military weapons take so long to reload? Why do these fearsome aliens fall to the punching and kicking of a handful of marines? Why, when faced with three perfectly good elevators, do all the characters wait for the same one? Why are the onscreen characters so tiny that it's hard to click on them? Why can't the military leader unlock or lock doors? When you spend more time thinking about the game design and its mechanics, you know something's not quite right. Still, ENEMY INFESTATION has certain charms. I liked the fact that ordinary items, like fire extinguishers and hair spray cans, would occasionally serve as useful weapons. The individual characters seemed to have, well, character, though occasionally their repetitive speech became tiresome. Multiplayer is co-op, with the human gamers taking over one or more characters. You can even play through the campaign in mission order. It works great, and having a human ally makes the game much more fun. The worst part of the game is the clunky user interface. The game runs at 800x600, but it almost seems like a last-minute decision. \"Hey, 640x480 isn't good enough, let's go to 8x6.\" It looks like the resolution got scaled up without resizing the art, leaving onscreen characters quite tiny and frustratingly difficult to click on. You can click on the character's portrait, but sometimes when a group was selected, clicking on a portrait did not deselect the group. On more than one occasion I dropped every one's weapon rather than just a single character's. Luckily, a realtime strat convention came to my WORLD **** HIDE AND SEEK The Hide command is particularly useful for your weaker characters. Get them cowering before they're spotted, and your wimps will be safe. APPEAL: Fans of turn-based strate neede n gy games looking to dip their toes in real-time waters PROS: Need to shift strategies over time; great ambient audio; logical puzzle solutions CONS: Clunky interface; characters are too small; goals handed to you rather than discovered DIFFICULTY: Intermediate REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 200, Windows 95, 32MB RAM, PCI video card with 2MB of RAM, 6x CD-ROM, sound card. 3D SUPPORT: None MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: LAN or Internet (2-4 players); one CD per player. Price: $49.95 Publisher: Ripcord Games Santa Clara, CA (888) 797-5867 www.ripcordgames.com A few of the missions break this pattern, and these missions were the most entertaining. In one, the mechanic found himself alone after a fight, with everyone else incapacitated. You had to figure out how to use this one, rather limited character to get the others up and healthy. In another mission, the bartender had to sneak past some and flood a mining tractor with LOX, killing a host of aliens. However, some of the unique missions proved annoying. One mission had a time limit—15 minutes to finish before Bottom line? ENEMY INFESTATION aspires to the quality of X-COM, but falls short. Without a research tree or resource management to present challenges, it becomes more an exercise in puzzle solving than a strategy game. If you're seeking \"real-time frenzy,\" as the box states, look elsewhere. CGW Between hardware reviews and games, Loyd Case manages to find time for two daughters, a wife, a guinea pig.

But it's not enough to make you want to play it.-Charles Ardai The Game of Life nlike Hasbro's first attempt to bring the boardgame classic Clue to the PC, its second release, CLUE: MURDER AT BODDY MANSION, isn't a dismal failure. The game is visually stunning, complete with a stylishly rendered Boddy Mansion (done in a DIABLO-style isometric perspective) and atmospheric music so sexy and mysterious it ought to be a movie soundtrack. Each time a player proposes a combination of killer, weapon, and room, a brief animation plays: you watch from the victim's point of view as Colonel Mustard swings the candlestick at your head or as Miss Scarlet sinks the knife into you with a grisly squoosh. Just watching the characters wander around the tastefully furnished rooms is a pleasure. But what does all this have to do with the game? Not much: Nothing in the rooms is interactive, so all the wandering around has no point. The animations are short, and the excitement soon wears off.

While early levels take only a few minutes each, there are 650 levels in all, so you'll be happily busy for quite a while. -Mark Clarkson Publisher: Psygnosis Price: $39.99 www.psygnosis.com avoiding bad guys felt both novel and satisfying. Today, when anything short of a real-time, photorealistic, first-person bloodbath is greeted with a yawn, you have to wonder if a game like LODE RUNNER 2 will find an audience. In this sequel, you're climbing all over the place in pursuit of mansized hunks of gold. Some of the hunks are out in the open; others can only be reached by blasting away the layers of stone that cover them or by climbing hand-overhand along an overhead pipe. Still others are at ground level but are guarded by hooded monks who will gladly beat you to death if they get their hands on you. Unlike the original's 2D layouts, LODE RUNNER 2 takes place in scrolling edifices viewed from an isometric 3D perspective. Unfortunately, the angle makes the controls awkward: It's easy to forget which key moves you in which direction. Plan to spend plenty of time banging into walls and dying after accidentally stepping in the wrong direction. Despite the painfully unintuitive controls, the cleverness of the level design makes this a blast to play. If you can't figure out how to solve a particularly tough level, you can always move on to the next-a generous and wise decision on the designers' part. The fact that your character's movements are realistic, or that the levels take place in five graphically distinct worlds is nice. But it doesn't change the fact that the underlying game is basically just a series of supertough sequencing, timing, and topology puzzles. For many modern gamers, that'll sound about as appealing as a plate of brussels sprouts, and I'm afraid that all the snazzy 3D protrusions won't get the taste out of their mouths. But those gamers who still value Lode Runner 2 * * * * in a welcome change from typical puzzle fare, SENTINEL RETURNS offers a first-person perspective like nothing else since the original. SENTINEL RETURNS levels are rugged 3D landscapes. Inside these levels hulks, appropriately enough, the Sentinel: sort of an evil Art Deco lighthouse, slowly scanning the landscape, looking for you. To win, you must make your way to the Sentinel's level and take its place. The catch is, you can't move; you play as a consciousness trapped in an immobile, Iron Maiden-form robot. What you can do is create additional robot bodies, then teleport your consciousness into them. You can also create trees to hide yourself from the Sentinel's baleful stare and boulders for your new robots to stand on, raising them to higher levels. Creation, however, takes energy, which you absorb from trees and your old, castoff bodies and boulders. If the Sentinel spies you, he'll steal your energy.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY. CHEATS  WALKTHROUGHS Caesar III Building Rome in a Weekend Note also that villas aren't exactly efficient from a housing standpoint. In fact, moving up to a villa can create a housing shortage since less fortunate plebes have to move elsewhere. If the neighborhood you're trying to upgrade also serves as a major work-force supplier to industry, you run the risk of \"upgrading\" your economy where you might build fortifications at the start of the game, as well as where your trading warehouses (yes, plural) and docks should be located once you get around to setting up trade routes. A lso, you'll want to make sure that your infrastructure (doctors, schools, granaries, markets, and such) can handle the demands of by Tim Carter s with all good strategy games, CAESAR III most rewards the people who think about it in the right way. In your average game of military conquest, you might do quite well planning from objective to objective. In CIVILIZATION, to give a second example, you could easily plan your success from one technological plateau to the next. However, city-oriented strategy games in general, and CAESAR III in particular, tend to reward players who think in reverse from the finished product backward. In CAESAR III, it's much more useful to take a few minutes (use that Pause key) to think about how your ideal, finished city (with all victory conditions met) will look. Where will you place the highincome neighborhoods? Where will the high-density housing be most useful? How will these neighborhoods relate to their surroundings? Thus, if you redo your food supply system halfway through the game, your people may insist on following their old ways even if they starve as a result. Do it right the first time, even if this means a somewhat stretched-out city at the start. Keep in mind as well that, provided your city is attractive to immigrants, a new neighborhood can upgrade very quickly if all of the right pieces of the puzzle are in place. You may want to build middle-class neighborhoods at the start of the game, then create customized high-rent housing to drive up your prosperity level later on. MR. CARTER'S NEIGHBORHOOD In this starting neighborhood, note how the granary (left) and dock (top, right of center) are already placed for future trade. Think Before You Upgrade Probably the worst thing you can do is just start building. For instance, it's quite possible that to meet your financial needs and/or victory conditions you'll need ultra luxurious villas—at least in small numbers. Villas require more space than normal housing does, and they need extra food and luxury items. Thus, when you're planning a rich neighborhood you have to visualize, at the outset, how you're going to deliver said goodies to the lucky residents. Building the 'Hood One easy way to keep organized when building cities is to think in terms of neighborhoods. As most urban planners will tell you these days, the optimum organizational unit for a major metropolis is the neighborhood-a desirable zone that provides most or all of the residents' needs, thus minimizing travel. While traffic jams are not much of a problem in CAESAR III, your people won't walk far to get what they want, and you can't ever trust them to walk in the correct direction when they do set out. In fact, the somewhat random and limited nature of foot travel in CAESAR III influences many aspects of planning—but we'll touch more on that later. Obviously, each major area of your city will need housing to have the necessary work force on hand. Housing, in turn, requires food, entertainment, religion, and a host of other services. Again, it's a good idea to decide in advance the kind of neighborhood you want to build. If you simply need a decent working population, you can construct a middle-class neighborhood straight into the ground. Since your neighborhood won't likely reach the villa stage until well into the game, it's crucial that you plan ahead enough to both create the maximum value housing and accommodate it once it arrives. Your city must also be balanced, with some lower-class neighborhoods to supply workers to your farms and industry. Note that lower class doesn't mean inefficient or bad, just lacking in some highvalue commodities. Along the same lines, you'll want to get a rough sense for high-density housing from the outset. In some cases this isn't a problem; for instance, an engineer can just as easily maintain a big, expensive house as a small tent. In other cases, however, it pays to plan ahead. For instance, if you know that you'll need to import additional food types to feed an upper-class area, you must leave room for a warehouse near your primary granary in the area. Moreover, it seems that buyers from markets don't adjust their shopping routes unless their original source of food is destroyed. See the Review JANUARY ISSUE. 4.5 STARS 246 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"CAESAR III CONTAINING A CARTHAGINIAN ATTACK AMERS Winning battles in CAESAR III generally requires a combination of fortifications and legions. Wide walls and towers will be garrisoned as long as you have a functioning barracks in your city and each tower is staffed and connected to the city by road. Walls afford you a number of important attributes. First, they ensure that your legions can respond to attacks before the enemy actually gets into your city (provided you've been wise enough to build within the walls). Second, javelin-armed guardsmen and basilica on the walls can wear away at the attackers while your troops get organized behind them or, if you prefer, you can meet the enemy head-on at the outside foot of your walls and gain support from missile fire from behind. Personally, I like to fight from behind the walls, especially against superior enemy forces. This ensures that your troops will be organized, ready, and in formation when they fight. Attackers will generally only breach a small portion of a thick defensive wall, which lets you trap them in the breach and attack them with superior forces as they emerge (the land version of \"crossing the T\"). Meanwhile, your basilica and javelin garrisons can continue to fire onto backed up enemy soldiers, help ing to even the odds. In the open, you will still benefit from making the enemy come to you. If you engage before your troops have set themselves in formation, you will suffer excessive losses and may even losedepending, of course, on whom you're fighting. The exception to this is cavalry, which should be sent against bowmen or enemy flanks once their front is engaged and should disengage the minute they start to take heavy losses. If you're desperate-say, an enemy army shows up before you've finished constructing your defenses-quick emergency action can often save the day. While the invaders are fiddling about on your border, build a short wall with multiple towers near your most exposed residential neighborhood (to ensure workers), connect it using roads, and rally whatever troops you have in front of the wall. By the time your attackers get near your city, you should have at least a few basilica ready to provide covering fire. Provided your defensive stand is somewhere vaguely along their path of attack, invading units will always converge on defenders first before running hese Roman fortifications have been designed so that Carthaginian attackers are caught in a crossfire (above) as they attempt to breach the walls. Survivors can be dispatched by legions waiting behind the walls (below). amok in your city. This won't protect you from a horde of elephants, but it will turn the tide of a closerun battle. Under no circumstances should you ever fight the natives in a province. Build missions and make sure they don't fall down or become nonfunctional. And as the native population grows and builds their own new houses, you must be quick to erect new missions if you want a permanent peace. In closing, always remember that the people of your city, while not exactly stupid, will be completely random in their actions. You, as their governor, must guide their actions through careful planning by giving them as few choices as possible. CGW ALL RIVERS LEAD TO ROME Engaging in maritime commerce is critical to the growth of your city (above).

"Motocross Madness The Mysteries of Torque, Traction, and Gyroscopic Action before you land to take full advantage of your spinning back wheel's desire to stay upright. SPINNING TO Trying to land in the direction of the turn gives you an edge, but be careful! When you tilt a spinning gyroscope like your motorcycle on its side, it turns...rapidly. by Greg Fortune ike many of you, I had never ridden a motorcycle before-either on or off the road-before my first adventure on the muddy trails of Clearcreek. Yet there I was, straddling my father-in-law's YZ 465 and wondering if my limbs would arrive back in camp the same time I did. That fateful morning I was given a few sage pieces of advice, which I will now use to add some perspective on playing MOTOCROSS MADNESS. Keep Your Helmet Over the Bars In MOTOCROSS MADNESS, you have the ability to control how far forward or back your rider places his weight, which is critical to staying on the bike. The rough rule is to keep your helmet on a vertical line with your bars. If you are riding up a hill, put your weight forward to keep the bike balanced on its wheels and Check Your Bike Before You Ride Engine There are three different tunings for your 250cc twostroke engine. A tight track means lots of braking and accelerating. So you'll want the A or B variant since they feature more low-end torque to get you going. A wide open course has lots of opportunity for wide open throttle, so pick the C variant for its superior top-end performance. Feb Mar G P 1933 When in Doubt, Punch It! When you think you're sure to wipe out, grab a handful of the throttle, stand on the pegs, and hang on! Dirt bikes will ride on/over/through just about anything as long as the rider is still aboard, and your wheels function as big, knobby gyroscopes. As long as you're on the bike with some momentum, you have a chance-however slim. When you're airborne, control pitch via your back wheel. If you open the throttle in midair, the gyro effect will cause your bike to tip backward. If you want to bring the front wheel down, give the brake a squeeze to slow down the back wheel an easy way to control your landing approach. Similarly, when you're coming in too fast and have overshot your landing zone, you typically land headed in the wrong direction, going too fast. It's possible to tilt your bike a bit and make the turn as you land in the middle of it. Be careful: Too much turn, and your bike will land sideways and toss you into the stands. Make sure to open the throttle just See the Review DECEMBER ISSUE.4.5 STARS CLOSE TO THE EDGE While this looks dangerous, note how the rider's helmet is still over the bars. Suspension If you tend to land jumps awkwardly or are having trouble in the whoops (those nagging, closely spaced sections of ridges in the track), try softening up your suspension a bit. If, on the other hand, your landings are smooth as glass, a stiffer suspension will reduce any bouncing, which helps with control. prevent it from landing on your chest as it flips over backward. If riding downhill, stand on the pegs and push yourself back on the bike to keep the bike from coming over your back and riding you down the hill. Y ou can also use your weight to load the suspension before a jump. As you approach the jump. lean forward to compress the front forks. A moment before takeent before takeoff, lean back and let your front end literally leap into the air. It's the way to turn small jumps into trick opportunities. Finally, the quickest way to turn around is to lean forward on the bike at low speed, tilt hard in the direction you want to turn, and roost that back tire around behind you. You can burn doughnuts all day long using this method. Well, I hope that helps. Take these tips, and a with lot of practice, soon the only thing your opponents will see is the mud you just roosted on their goggles. CGW Traction if you like to slide around the track, drop the traction way down. If, like me, you enjoy new tires, crank up the traction. Adjust periodically as your style develops. Greg Fortune loves to pop wheelies in the CGW offices, especially when reliving favorite big Mech fantasies. 256 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. FEBRUARY 1999 www. com "


"Morpheus Sorting Through the Dream Within the Dream GAMER'S EDG Swan This lady is a dancer with a special tune. Cards on the I lounge tables should help with the music and get you into her room, where we all know how to charm a cobra. For the tapestries, studying the background should give you the edge. Amazing is the word for the hookahs;starting in the right place will lead you to the answer in an orderly fashion. Mexler Vou'll have to see some of that deja boo with Mexler and Thurmon in a couple of places before muddy events take place and you can get into his room. The calliope puzzle is easy; it operates the carousel, making the solution a real horse race. Equally simple is the fun house. After seeing the presentation, go around back (trash the rat), and use a little pull in the dark ES OLUSIVE handlopees, by Scorpia n MORPHEUS the puzzles are sometimes trivial and sometimes really subtle. Clues can be anywhere, and sometimes you may not even realize you're looking at one or what it means. In the dream sequences, however, everything you need to solve the puzzles will be in the dream itself. Most solutions can be pieced together from visual clues, rather than by the use of objects, and in certain cases, a lot of deduction is necessary. Always look at everything in your surroundings-be it on the ship or in a dream. Getting into the ship is easy; there's not much to work with besides the cargo controls (the canister is optional and can be skipped if you prefer). Once inside, restore power via the AIV sequencer, downstairs from the theater level (speaking of stairs, examine the grand staircase carefully for a partly enlightening experience). The front panel on the gondola shows your location. You have to reach all three of the center circles to enable power on the Herculania. Don't be fooled; the third machine looks like the first one, but it's a different device. Otherwise, a little experimenting with the controls is all you need to be up and running. Afterward, take the grand tour, enjoy ghostly replays, and work on getting into the staterooms and entering people's dreams. That can be done in any order; the dreams don't need to be completed in a specific sequence. Galte The code for Galte's stateroom door is a weighty I matter, and the scale shows the weights for each class of fighter. The dumbbells show that the 10-pound weights are missing. After you look at them for the first time, you see the ghost of Galte stepping on the scale. He's a welterweight, but when he picks up the two dumbbells, he moves up to heavyweight (175). Since together those make 20 pounds, his actual weight is 155, the code for his lock. Thurmon L er door code is another math job; these screens I show the two clues to the numbers you need to enter on the three bath doors (Frigidarium, Tepidarium, and Vaporarium) so they'll open. A steamy room will give you what you want. If you don't feel like you're going in circles here you should be very quickly. The graveyard's another weird one; when you have the toy monkey, give it to a shaft (no kidding!). As for the three statues room, lighten up and reflect on where to go (be sure to look around when you're up by the levers). This may require some trial and error, but it shouldn't take you very long. Jan's Room The hint for this code comes from a couple of those I replays, including the one in Claire's room. Just keep in mind that the actual key is not a duplicate but a reversal. In here you'll obtain the code for Pharris' room and reach the end of the game. CGW from Visit Scorpia AL Malherbe The kinetoscope details some of Malherbe's work and mentions two flowers and a \"mystery\" ingredient (illustrated in the film) that comprise his special serum. The diagram shows the layout of the greenhouse, and the names Sketches on the chart correspond to flowIndonesia ers in the greenhouse, plus the little amphibian exhibit (the third ingredient).

Spend some time teaching your Norn to come when called. Do this very early in the game. Your next quest is to retrieve the Science Kit (see #1). Get your Norn to follow the path shown to the Science Kit and tell it to \"get implement.\" The Science Kit contains medicine to revive severely ill or injured Norns; without it, you will lose a lot of Norns. You can't physically pick up a Norn unless it falls in the water. You can grab a Norn to keep it from drowning. If a Norn won't go where you want it to, consider pushing it into the water on purpose with the push hand, then picking it up and moving it where you want. Quickly, though! Imported Norns always appear in the Incubator Room. So, one way you can move a Norn to the Incubator Room is by exporting it, then reimporting it. If you have two Norns that you want to...ahem...get together, you can accomplish this feat by exporting and reimporting both of them in rapid succession.

While the British can attempt to disengage, it's likely that their engineering company will evaporate in the process. More prudent would be to order the 101st Airborne out of reserve to occupy the British position. Compared to the enemy SS units, the 101st has much higher reconnaissance capability, which will serve to screen the British withdrawal. Other factors such as time of day, prevailing weather conditions, and terrain are also taken into account. Note how the British units pay a heavy movement penalty to disengage. -Mark Dultz ost operational-level wargames fail to satisfactorily portray the significance of reserves. Typically, players throw all of their units along the front in a desperate attempt to create a breach in the enemy line. In ART OF WAR, reserves play a valuable role, since they can replace battle weary frontline units, giving them a chance to rest, refit, and reorganize.

"HALL OF FAME WELCOME TO THE COOPERSTOWN OF COMPUTER GAMES. Games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. Alone in the Dark (1-Motion, 1992) Lovecraftian horror goes 3D, with shifting camera angles adding to the creepy atmosphere. Their Finest Hour (LucasArts, 1989) World War Il sim with great campaigns, realism, and many crew-member options. King's Quest V (Sierra On-Line, 1990) Redefined the graphic adventure with new parser and VGA graphics. Lemmings (Psygnosis, 1991) The lovable cartoon Lilliputians were hits on every platform The Bard's Tale (EA, 1985) Pioneered three-point animation, 3D color mazes, and auto-mapping. TIE Fighter (LucasArts, 1994) Most satisfying Star Wars space.combat game to date; lets you live on the dark side. Links 386 Pro (Access Software, 1992) Topped the leader board in graphics and realism for its era, Ultima III (Origin Systems, 1983) Coherency and surprising subtlety emphasized role. playing and set the tone for later ULTIMAS. Battle Chess (Interplay, 1988) The Franklin Mint of computer chess games, with violent and funny animation disguising a solid chess engine. Betrayal at Krondor (Dynamix, 1993) As rich and imaginative as Raymond Feist's world itself. M-1 Tank Platoon (MicroProse, 1989) Realistic sim that properly focused on armored formations rather than on single vehicles, good mission designs. Ultima IV (Origin Systems, 1985) High-concept RPG explored meaning of virtue and put the role in role-playing. Chessmaster (Software Toolworks, 1986) The Cadillac of castling, it gets better with each version. Master of Magic (MicroProse, 1994) The atmosphere of MAGIC THE GATHERING with the sophistication of CIV. Ultima VI (Origin Systems, 1990) RPG as morality play, replete with moral choices and realistic environs. Master of Orion (MicroProse, 1993) Remarkable diplomatic Al; deep and varied technology tree; aliens required radically different playing styles. Command & Conquer (Virgin Westwood Studios, 1995) Moved beyond Dune li with innovative features and multiplayer play, ushering in the current real-time strategy game explosion. Day of the Tentacle (LucasArts, 1993) Offbeat sequel to MANIAC MANSION; the interactive equivalent of a classic Chuck Jones cartoon. Ultima Underworld (Origin Systems, 1992) The first truly 3D RPG, and still the most convincing: its dungeon walls are nicely \"painted\" with texture mapped graphics. Mech Brigade (SSI, 1985) Improved KAMPFGRUPPE System for modern armored battles. War in Russia (SSI, 1984) More realistic than EASTERN FRONT, it captured the essence of the largest land campaign in history. DOOM (id Software, 1993) Revolutionized PC action games and network gaming: now surpassed in technology, but not in gameplay. MechWarrior 2 (Activision, 1995) A serious treatment of Mech design and resource management, combined with complex and addictive battles; legitimized \"giant robot simulations.\" WarCraft II (Blizzard, 1996) More cerebral than most real-time strategy games, it offered deceptive depth and personality to spare. Dungeon Master (FTL Software, 1987) Trend-setting graphics, digitized stereo, and great hackand-slash from a decade ago. Might & Magic (New World Computing, 1986) First-person, maze-based RPG with huge environment and tough combat. Wasteland (Interplay, 1986) Derived from Mike Stackpole's Mercenaries, Spies, and Private Eyes, this is the definitive postapocalyptic RPG. Earl Weaver Baseball (EA, 1986) Revolutionary physics-based baseball game pleased both action and statistics fans, still unsurpassed more than a decade later. M.U.L.E. (EA, 1983) A landmark multiplayer strategy game that had no weapons of destruction, just cutthroat competition that made economics fun. Wing Commander (Origin Systems, 1990) A hot space-flight engine, unfolding story path, and great characters. Empire (Interstel, 1978) World War II in space, this mainframe transplant brought elegant mechanics, depth, and unending replayability to the PC. Panzer General (SSI, 1994) Entertaining wargame with an elegant interface, great campaigns, strong Al, good graphics, and impressive sound. Wing Commander II (Origin Systems, 1991) Darker story, grittier feel, sound card advances, and tougher Al made this a sequel of sequels. F-19 Stealth Fighter (MicroProse, 1988) A \"thinking man's\" sim, with great missions, in which sneaking around is as fun as dogfighting. Red Baron (Dynamix, 1990) World War I air combat with great graphics, incredible realism, and a versatile replay feature. Wing Commander III (Origin Systems, 1994) Surprisingly satisfying FMV space opera didn't lose the essence of the space-combat game. Falcon 3.0 (Spectrum HoloByte, 1991) Tough, detailed jet sim with ambitious AI, graphics, and connectivity to match its realism. The Secret of Monkey Island (LucasArts, 1990) Comedy that set new standards in writing quality and social sensitivity. Wizardry (Sir-Tech Software, 1981) Defined the computer RPG with maze-based viewpoint and atmospheric spell names. Front Page Sports Football Pro (Dynamix, 1993) Physics-based system, good Al, and unmatched career play make this the ultimate in pigskin play. Sid Meier's Civilization (Micro Prose, 1991) CGW's #1-rated game of all time; indescribably addictive world-conquest/exploration game. Wolfenstein 3-D (id Software, 1992) Smooth-scrolling action blastfest cleverly updated the original and put shareware back on the map. Gettysburg: The Turning Point (SSI, 1986) First variable order of battle changed the look of all American Civil War games on the PC. Sid Meier's Pirates (MicroProse, 1987) Combines pirate adventure, action, RPG, and strategy to make the most successful hybrid of all time. X-COM (MicroProse, 1994) Premier tactical squad-level engine combined with alien tech research and pop culture for a sci-fi game nearly as addictive as CIVILIZATION. Gunship (MicroProse, 1986) Great character continuity, R&R for fatigued pilots, and even sick leave; best chopper fare until Jane's LONGBOW. Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon (MicroProse, 1990) SIMCITY meets 1830, with robber barons for emphasis. You Don't Know Jack (Berkeley Systems, 1996) Fresh and irreverent, Jack turned trivia gaming on its collective ear to become the first mainstream CD-ROM with a gleeful gameplay bite. Harpoon (360 Pacific, 1989) In-depth modern naval battles in realtime, based on the world's Cold War fears. SimCity (Maxis, 1987) Urban planning with fascinating consequences and challenges, the first great software toy Kampfgruppe (SSI, 1985) Its World War II East Front armor battles were a success on multiple platforms. Starflight (EA, 1986) Depth great characters, and a good sci-fi storyline set early RPG standard. Zork (Infocom, 1981) The progenitor of adventure games on the PC, its humor and challenging puzzles seem timeless. The game has since spawned a number of sequels, none of which has equaled the original. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. FEBRUARY 1999 269 "

"And Now a Word From Grandpa Or, if I'm Not Old, Why Do I Want Those Dang Kids off My Lawn? guy, right?) I have no clue what his music sounds like, but whenever I see his picture want to tell him to eat some meat, for Pete's sake, and to get some natural sunlight. TIE But the clearest, and most depressing, sign of my rapidly approaching slide into canerattling, tapioca pudding-eating than actually playing. My aim is so shaky, you could attach a fork to my mouse and scramble an egg while I played. When I'm not dead, you can usually find me standing still, in wide open spaces, panicked, weaponless, waiting to die. The picture isn't much prettier in real-time strategy games. In the ongoing CGW AGE OF EMPIRES battles, while my opponents are frantically collecting resources, building armies, and preparing to destroy me, I am usually squinting at my screen, wandering around with one peasant, looking for my first berry bush. Often I have to be reminded what game we're playing, or be led back to my desk if I've wandered off, mumbling to myself about Quicken, working on my stock portfolio? Instead of stressing out about how to stop those frickin' buildings from catching on fire all the time in CAESAR III, shouldn't I be attending weekend business seminars and reading books on cholesterol? But, you know, I just can't get into it. I don't want to be like that. And why should I? Life's too short to act \"old.\" And, anyway, if perennial youngster John Glenn can orbit the Earth at age 77, I can play a QUAKE II DeathMatch at age 37. I just hope I'll be playing QUAKE X (or maybe the then brand-new DAIKATANA) at age 77 myself. So, go ahead and laugh at the old man. I may not be able to frag a moving target anymore, but I'm still having fun. JEFF GREEN he signs are every where. There is no escaping it. I am getting old. One clue is that I just had another birthday—my 37th. I suppose this beats the alternative-being dead-but this one was clearly the birthday of a soon-to-be-middle-aged guy. For one thing, there were no cool toys whatsoever. No Hot Wheels, no Batman accessories, no rapid-fire water cannons. What I did get, in fact, was some new underwear. Even worse—way worse—was that I was happy about it. Next year, 1 suppose I'll be thanking people for my personalized drool bucket and inaugural box of Depends. Turning 37, for whatever reason, has really made me think about stuff, more than the last few birthdays have. For example, 15 years after the fact, it has finally hit me that I am no longer just \"postcollege\" and should therefore stop daydreaming about living in a dorm again and throwing pennies at people from out the window. I've also noticed that it's getting harder and harder to stay hip. I don't know what \"gettin' jiggy with it\" means, nor do honestly care. Go get jiggy somewhere else--and keep it down while you're at it. I don't want any part of my body pierced, at all, unless it's some how going to help my digestion. And Marilyn Manson? What's up with that guy? (It's a I just hope I'll be playing QUAKE X (or maybe the then brand-new DAIKATANA) at age 77. the good old days of PAC MAN and PONG senility is my exponentially declining gaming skills. Especially when it comes to action games like QUAKE II. Back in my day (before electricity, before the wheel, before your fancy modern conveniences like \"housing\"), I could hold my own in a first-person shooter. My reflexes were good and my mind was sharp, so I could routinely kick booty in games like Doom and MARATHON. Gamers feared me. These days, well, it's just kind of sad. I die constantly. spend more time respawning And the day I'm too old to have fun—well, that's the day you can stick me on the cart and haul me away. Until then, grandpa's gettin' jiggy over here with GRIM FANDANGO. Be a good boy and go get me my pills. My back is killing me! CGW Okay, okay-it's not this bad yet. (Managing Editor's note: Yes it is.) But this is my big fear-that I will keep playing games well past the point where I have any business doing so. I keep wondering, actually, when it's going to hit me that it's time for me to stop goofing off and buckle down and be an adult. Instead of killing giant ants in FALLOUT 2, for example, shouldn't I be huddled over What Jeff doesn't realize is that, as part of CGW's new youth outreach movement, all the editors will get body piercings for next month's issue.
