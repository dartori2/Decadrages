How Do We Classify Games? Action/Arcade (AC): The emphasis is on hand-eye coordination and reflexes, usually emphasizing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure (AD): Games wherein you control an alter ego and move through a story line or sequence of events and puzzle solving takes precedence over conversation and combat. Classics/Puzzles (CP): Classics are old stand-bys and parlor games that appeal to many different types of gamer. Examples include: backgammon, bridge, chess, MONOPOLY, parchesi, Risk, and SOLITAIRE. Puzzle games are computer games which emphasize spatial relationships, word games and/or problem-solving without requiring gamers to follow a storyline. Examples would be: SHANGHAI, TETRIS and ZIG-ZAG. Role-Playing (RP). RPGs are a subset of adventure games, but stress character develop ment, often through improving stats or other attributes.

"JUST THE FAQS ly more important than in Adventure games. Finally, the game world tends to be large, and the plot less linear, often with some quests/ treks outside the main story line. Simulations (SI): Highly realistic games from a first-person perspective: you may drive a realistically simulated race car, fly a military aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed sci-fi environment. Usually polygon-filled technology is used to build the simulated world on the fly. Sports (SP): The sports game category is a broad genre which includes action (NBA Live) and strategy games (FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO) based on sports. Strategy (ST): Problem-solving, short and long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X-COM, OUTPOST, MOO), as well as \"pure\" strategy games and \"software toys\" such as SIMCITY. Wargames (WG): A subset of strategy games, these recreate his. torical conflicts from a command perspective.

Here's how I happened to start CGW. In late 1979, I got the hare. brained notion that I could be a computer game designer. I had designed a board game or two and thought that, with a few months invested in reading programming tutorials, I could become a \"player\" in what I thought would be a wonderful emerging hobby and indus. try. I was right about the hobby and industry, but quite wrong about being a computer game designer. You see, in those days the designer and the programmer were the same person. The concept of specialized skills exhibited by design teams, producers, and the like would not make an appearance until the mid '80s when Electronic Arts codified the development-team approach to game design. After spending only two weeks with the Applesoft tutorial manual, CG NOVEMBER 1996 "

So here I was, stuck with the $2,000 machine representing my life sav. ings, and no way to make money with it. While trying to figure out how to get the computer to pay for itself, I was playing a lot of games. In March of 1981, I was playing a game called COMPUTER AIR COMBAT from SSI. It was a thinly disguised computer version of a popular board-game system called Air Force/Dauntless from Battleline Games. Driving along the freeway one day in March 1981, I was thinking about the game. Mulling over the fact that a programming error caused the ME-109s in the game to turn more tightly than they should have, wondered if others had noticed the same problem. I wanted to read a review of the game and see if others saw the problem. It occurred to me that no one was reviewing computer games in those days. Outside of a brief mention of an arcade game here and there, none of the existing magazines covered games. And certainly there wasn't anything like a computer game magazine to consult \"Someone should start a com p uter game magazine,\" I thought to myself as I drove along. \"You could do it,\" a voice said in my head. \"I don't know the first thing about magazine publishing,\" | thought. \"You could learn,\" said the voice. It felt like some scene out of Star Wars: \"Russ... Use the Force, Russ!\" The voice was right. I could learn. And I did learn. Now, 15 years later I look with pride at what CGW has accomplished over the years and at what it is today. In those 15 years CGW has reviewed thousands of computer games and entertained millions of gamers. But more importantly, CGW has helped mold and shape the look of the computer gaming as both hobby and industry. We played a key role in building the community of computer gamers. This is the greatest legacy a magazine could hope to attain. Computer Gaming World has done the job. And I am very proud of her.

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH The subscribers rate games from a list on a questionnaire. Playing Lately is a strav poll of the same subscribers where they write in the names of games they are currently playing. Hence, The Top 100 gives a qualitative evaluation, whereas Plaving Lately may indicate popularity more than quality. We like to think that the former offers comparative quality while the latter shows what's currently hot. EDITORIAL COMMENT Tama fairly new reader of CCW,sincel have only recently gotten fairly heavily into computer gaming and am only 13, but I find it better than any other magazine I've seen, and I trust your opinions very much. I have a question about game level makers and editors and the like I recently purchased WARCRAFT II, and found the editor to be half the game. It adds infinite plavability, and most of all, it was so easy lo use that even a brainless fool like me could use it. My problem is, why do other editors have to be so hard? Except for HEROES OF MICUT AND MAGIC (Windows 95 version), I have never found anothcreditor that was this easy, or even one I could use, nor has anyone I know. Do these people all expect us to have a full knowedge of CAD? I knowa WARCRAFT-style cditor wouldn't have worked for many games, such as Doou clones, but I think something a little more user friendly could have been thought up. Or take the CRUSADER series, which looks like it could casily have had an editor made for it, which would have been deliciously fun to use. Does anybody else feel this way, or am I just being foolish? Andrew Gorrill Grav, ME We wish it were possible to have an easy-touse editor for every game. Different game companies have different philosophies about the value of editors. While the flexibility often gives legs to a game and causes a title to remain in the public's eve a little longer, it also reduces the desirability of producing a sequel with the semme basic game engine, since gamers may be able to download new levels or maps from the Internet or a host of local BBSs. The two biggest questions about whether to build game editors are 1) how much time/money to invest in creating an interface that gamers can understand and 2) what is the nature of the game objects (3D objectoriented, limited to a library provided by the company, spritebased) and thus how easily can user-defined objects be implemented in the game? Companies like Blizzard and New World have obviously decided that giving users the extra flexibility to create their own scenarios makes the basic game into a better product. After helping to judge the HOMM scenario design contest recently (and secing game maps like the one pictured here), we truly believe that editors are a good thing. Now, if only Mindscape would develop a WARHAMMER editor so we could create our own medieval wargames! THE GODFATHER ANALOGY I was pleased to see your article defending the quality of sequel games. I only wish you could have seen it in your heart to give me credit for your Sword of Shanarral Godfather analogy. After all, you first used this line of reasoning in response to my letter a few months ago, in which I took exception to the five-star ratings given to sequel games. However, I must admit that I had never really played Sip MEER'S CIVILIZATION II before writing that letter. Now that I have, I can see why it received five stars. I still adhere, though, to my belief that sequel games should be reviewed with at Icast a small bias. This time, let me clarify my reasons. First, a gamer who has already played a great original game cannot (at least in most cases) get the extraordinary gaming experience that a live-star rating promises. In SID MEER'S CIVILIZATION II, you are incera S This scenario, \"The Crusades,\" was created with a built-in editor for the HEROES OF MIGHT & MAGIC scenario contest.

It is certainly entertaining, and the added multimedia is a nice addition as well. But a transcending gaming experience? I think not. Using your Godfather II analogy, CIVILIZATION II would be comparable to re-releasing The Godfather with an enhanced soundtrack and a few new scenes, and entitling it Godfather II. (In fact, George Lucas is attempting to do this very thing next year with Star Wars, but that's straying from the point.) You see, what made Godfather II even more successful than the original was the compelling, well-written and completely original script. You clid not see alorse's sev ered head in both movies, now dich you? My second point centers around originality. In my opinion, games like PSYCHIC DETECTIVE deserve extra praise because of their striking originality. Let's face it, software design ers can tum a profit on the same types of game year after year, so it is important to reward the program designer who stretches the imagination a bit. I know PSYCHIC DETEC TIVE was well received at CGW, but if games like these aren't given extra recognition and promotion, there might not be enough incentive for the next designer with a creative idea. lan Umland From the Internet had new script elements, new actors and new footage, but some of it was built solidly on the preproduction and production work done for the first film.

But while their large capacity (640 MB) has helped usher in this new era, their speeds and access times have left more than a few gamers twiddling their thumbs waiting for installations to finish and scenes to load. There have been incremental speed increases over the last couple of years, but Toshiba plans to dramatically raise the bar with its new XM-5701 and XM-5702 12X CD-ROM drives. Toshiba plans to ship both EIDE ($165) and SCSI-2 ($195) versions of the caddyless drive, which should be available as you read this. Improvements should come not only in speed-12x works out to a swift 1.8 MB/sec-but in access time as well, which Toshiba lists at about 125 ms. What does that mean for gamers?

Devo wore these, uh, flower pot thingies on their heads and sang a lot of songs about potatoes and \"devo. lution\" and stuff. Maybe you had to be there. Anyway, now Devo has a computer game, ADVENTURES OF THE SMART PATROL, and boy does this thing stink. The plot, such as it is, involves some sort of nonsense about bringing down an evil corporate empire and stopping a genetically mutated creature called Turkey Monkey. I'd like to tell you how it turns out, but the game is such an incomprehensible and unplayable mess (and I had the walkthrough!) that I gave up. Most disappointing-considering that Devo really were music video pioneers-is how awful the game looks, with third-rate animation; jerky, out-of-synch video; and an atrociously annoying interface. Members of Devo, it's time to ask your selves: Are we not has beens?

"GAME TRACK FIRST LOOK ere's your first look at games in development. These games aren't even playable yet, but we thought you'd want to see how they're coming along. If the game warrants it, we'll do a Sneak Preview or Hands On once they can be played. Might & Magic VI F Rate: 13.5 Screen: 610x294 FOV: 90 Character Helght: 100 Step Size: 30 Theta: 0 hen last we visited the MIGHT & Magic series, we encountered two interlocking game worlds-THE DARK SIDE OF Xeen and THE CLOUDS OF Xeen. The developers at New World had cleverly devised two interlocking games that, when connected, gave a sum greater than that of the two separate parts. When next we visit the MIGHT & Magic series, the creators' goal is to create the most logical 3D landscapes and interiors possible. The game world will be designed by a former architect who is supposed to use real-world logic in creating floor plans that make sense, cities which reflect the transactional and traffic flow of the city, and settle. ments that make the best use of existing natural resources. The engine is currently being constructed with full 3D so that any Lightwave generated town can be imported into the game engine. In this way, the artists can work on the environment using existing 3D tools while the programmers are still building the engine. Even the objects which can be manipulated in the game will all be defined objects with analogs to real-world objects. Screen Width: Screen Helght: Character Height: Field of View: Step size: Look Up/Down: F1 F2 F3/F4 F11/F12 F2/F8 F9/F10 Ins/Del HE The entire in-house staff at New World will reportedly shift to MIGHT & MAGIC VI after HEROES OF MIGHT & MAGIC II (see following) has shipped. HANDS ON puhese are the products in development we've actually spent some time with. They represent some of the most interesting titles in the Pipeline, and they are complete enough to actually tell how they're going to play. Most should be released soon. NASCAR 2 focused on NASCAR's extremely (perhaps overly?) realistic play. In short, it was just too darned hard to handle, espe. cially on road courses. Suffice it to say that the here's not exactly a lot of PC stock car software out there, but Sierra has upped the standards anyway with their upcoming NASCAR 2 from Papyrus Design Group. Early sampling indicates that although it won't be a quantum leap forward (hey, NASCAR was none too shabby in the first place), it'll certainly pack enough wallop to lure owners of the original back for another go. Off the track, NASCAR 2 sports interface improvements with tighter menus. upper and lower command bars and a single-screen setup routine that contains a spot for comments a nice touch. Race-time graphics are cleaner too, with a far more sophisticated look that includes clouds, prettier pavement, and generally more stable movement.One recurring complaint about the original, coming mostly from outside the core Papyrus audience, overdue implementa tion of curbing, which will tilt the car, should also help keep the tires on the black stuff. But what sets NASCAR apart from the rest will be the loud-mouth crew chief/spotter. Actually, he's a pretty decent sort and sounds a bit like ol' Mr. Jarrett, who coaches you about that car in your right or left blind spot, current lap count and the pit-lane speed limit. Papyrus's latest will also feature optional steer. ing assistance for a less demanding drive and an \"arcade\" mode for those that like it really unreal. As for tracks, Daytona won't be there (yet!), but 16 other tracks will, as will the unruly number 3 of Dale Earnhardt. Uh-oh, better get Maaco!-G.

"GAME TRACK PIPELINE HANDS ON Heroes of Might & Magic II: The Succession Wars 11/96 Crusaders, and a Dragon's tower scales up from Green to Red to Black Dragons. Even some familiar buildings from the original have new value in HOMMII. Thieves Guilds now provide more detailed references, and tav. erns add rumors that can be useful. Most important, you can now hire a captain to man. age the town or castle's defenses when your hero isn't there. In the original, there was no way for a town without a hero present to use \"General's Orders.\" Combat has changed considerably. In response to popular demand, van Caneghem has added a Wait command so that gamers don't have to attack with the creatures in the same order ha in the great fantasy tradition of sequels and trilogies, authors have given us hours and hours of fascinating reading by taking us beyond the \"happily ever after\" of their first books and introducing us to the trials and tribulations of their offspring. Jon van Caneghem has added a new twist in HOMMII. Gamers choose between playing the bad son and the good son in two different campaigns. Still not satisfied? HOMMII offers almost four campaigns, because the good son can follow the dark side of HOMM's force and the bad son can be redeemed by the good (playing similar endings to the other cam. paigns with different parameters). Best of all, van Caneghem has managed to add role playing ele. ments to a well-balanced strategy game without messing up the play balance that made the original so addictive. The new elements include primary and secondary skills, character classes like the wizard and necromancer heroes, a new spell system that is mana (or strength) based, a broader range of opponents (up to six players), wider choice of castle/town improvements, and four different map sizes. Graphically, the towns offer a more realistic feel. The castles are based on historical architectural styles, instead of the fantasy illustra tion of the original, and the buildings are ren dered in 3D (so that they cast the right kinds of shadows) and then textured with handdrawn 2D art to remove that sterile feel most 3D art has. Unlike the first game, in which you built dwellings once and were rewarded with one type of being to recruit, HOMII allows you to upgrade nearly half the dwellings in the game.

This allows better use of \"combined arms\" tactics in the tough battles. Further, you can now divide creatures into attack groups. In the original, a player with 60 centaurs had to leave them in one group of 60. That way a rival sorcerer could tie up all 60 centaurs at once. Now you can have three groups of 20 centaurs, which foils that sorcerer's gambit.. Combat also allows you to use a PANZER GENERAL-style shaded hexagon interface, if desired.

"GAME TRACK HANDS ON >F/A-18 Hornet 3.0 he FIA-18 Hornet is the workhorse of Navy and Marine air units, performing both air-to-air and ground-attack missions with such finesse that it was the first aircraft simultaneously designated \"Fighter/Attack.\" Soon the Hornet will get a different sort of dual personality, when Graphic Simulations Corporation's updated FIA-18 HORNET 3.0 ships on both the Macintosh and, for the first time, Windows 95. Horner lets you fly single missions, a scripted career, or network battles (up to four players) in a single-seat FIA 18A. Unlike many recent sims, which have featured dynamic cam. paigns with strike packages composed of multiple aircraft types and have often concentrated on coordinating attacks with wingmen, HORNET seems to follow the older \"you against the world\" model. Not that that's too difficult in an aircraft that can simultaneously carry a full air-to-air load for self-protection, air-to-ground ordinance to perform precision strikes, and HARM antiradiation missiles to take out enemy SAM sites. (And for those really tough-to-clean enemy stains, try HORNET's tactical nukes, guaranteed to wipe out entire bases with one easy click, or your money back.) HORNET's graphics engine doesn't use tex. ture-mapping, but the large polygon count and high resolutions supported (up to 1024x768) make for extremely sharp ground structures and nicely detailed aircraft-not to mention a speedy frame rate on machines not blessed with 3D hardware. The flight model feels in the middle of the realism range. With a nice set of tutorials, uncomplicated but challenging missions, and a fairly realistic but not overwhelming instrument package, HORNET looks like a great introductory game for the new sim pilot. More experienced fliers, though, might feel a bit alone in the skies.-D.

"Let's give a big Bronx cheer and 350WORS Games Games three-fingered OF ALL TIME salute to the 1. Outpost SIERRA 1993 he idea was a good one: to make a realistic space strategy game based on real scientific principles. What would it be like to found a colony on an alien world? Well, it couldn't be any more frightening than the way this product shipped. Overly complex algorithms had you micro-managing oxygen levels in habitats, among other minutiae. Worse, the design was so incomplete that many of the actions you took made no difference in the game's outcome. Poor documentation forced players to buy the strategy guide-conveniently authored by the game's designer-and the interface design was no help either. Rightfully vilified as \"the greatest screen saver of all time,\" this game, more than any other, tries to hide its vague concepts, and near-total lack of substance behind pretty pictures with little success. ground MEGATRAVELLER 11. story that THE ZHODAN CONSPIRACY felt tossed off by Traveller creator Mark Miller from rehashes of pen and paper modules he had designed in the past. Then, it featured the best character generation system ever for creating characters with skills that didn't really impact the game. Next, it had real-time combat, handled so fast that most players didn't have a chance in 90% of the battles. Finally, they designed it so that the player would have to run away from the first encounter or be killed within two minutes of spending 30 minutes to an hour generating a character. Mega Traveller I was easily the Megaworst role-playing experience of all time, especially since its failure kept many other deserving paper RPGs from traveling to the computer for nearly a decade. Toke on 2. Defcon 5 COSMI, 1987 his Cold War era game combined the worst of two worlds: badly paced strategy with a poorly-designed arcade exercise. Cosmi couldn't even get the title of the game right: Defcon 5 is the most peaceful setting. From there, the game went downhill with an irritating log-on procedure and arcade sequences that bore little resemblance to any SDI-Style sysO N tem. Imagine TICS.DLSIMULATION deploying antispace mine robots to defuse space mines (the bad guys apparently didn't understand the concept of proximity detonators) or X-ray lasers that blanket wide areas of the atmosphere with severe radiation. Add dull graphics and lousy sound and you get the picture-DefCon None. TOP SECRET But even the most forgiving of computer pilots couldn't stomach Blue Angels. Blue Angels featured all the adrenalin rush of memorizing multiplication tables. The entire game was memorization, pattern recognition and reflex response. Much of the game is spent flying through wire-frame rectangles in order to memorize your \"routine.\" Then, you get to go into show mode. That might have been okay if the visual payoff was adequate, but it wasn't. Instead of passing within feet of each other in a death-defying knife-edge pass, you see your partner a mile away and zoom, he's gone. Give me the flash cards, please! BPO FAMILY 5. Homey D. Clown CAPSTONE, 1993 omey D. Clown was the epitome of the bad cartridge game on the PC. Capstone tried to cash in on some of the cachet associated with In Living Color, but defaulted to the simplest, most inane adventure elements to flesh it out. Homey don't play like dat and neither did any real gamers, if they were smart. Too bad we couldn't borrow Homey's sock just to beat up the game box. 3.

The latter part of the game was released some years later by Mindcraft, but it was leap years rather than lightyears too late. Star Fleet Il remains an unfortunate monument to buggy, incomplete products. 6. Night Trap DIGITAL PICTURES, 1994 he ultimate experience of FMV gone bad, Night Trap gave a bad name to every game platform from Sega to 3D0 to PC. The designers took a pretty ex-television star/ex-con named Dana Plato and put her in a nightgown. MATURE They surrounded her with an entire houseful of scantily clad Junior Misses and sent aliens to drill their brains out-literally. As the player, it was your job to protect these helpless little sweeties (hey, we didn't write the script-that's how they were treated!) by activating hot spots on the video and entrapping the aliens before they could perform their nefarious deeds. Unfortunately, that meant before you saw the cool special effects. So, how many preand early adolescent gamers do you suppose saved the girls? Yeah, that's what the Senate subcommittee investigating video game violence thought, too. anything resembling a flight model. Finally, throw in a lame strategic overlay, and you have a good idea of how these disparate elements became even less than the sum of their parts. 8. Universal Military Simulator II MICROPROSE, 1990 The design limitations were too numerous to mention in full, but they began with the designer's pet concept that \"fog of war is unrealistic.\" As a command simulation, it told you little of why Napoleon won at Austerlitz, or how Lee IONS AT WAR consistently triumphed over Union armies twice the size of his own forces. The weaponry modeling was so homogeneous that WWII scenarios differered little from those of the 19th century. However, the worst thing about UMS II was the incredible time that the AI took to make a single move-often as much as 2-3 hours and the move, once finished, was invariably terrible. The only thing \"universal\" about this entire series-including the recent War College-was the consistently low qualit y. UMS II, however, is so bereft of any redeeming factors that it justly deserves the title of worst wargame ever 10. The Civil War EMPIRE, 1996 eal-time games have their place-witness the success of Warcraft II and Command & Conquer-but this game set real-time strategy gaming back untold millennia.

"FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY SPECIALT THE 15 Most INFLUENTIAL INDUSTRY PLAYERS OF ALL TIME 1. Trip Hawkins awkins' insights haven't always pamed out, but he's always had a vision for this industry. As founder of Electronic Arts, Trip was right about the value of the recording industry model for software distribution and the need to recognize designcrs as artists. He was right about how good the Commodore Amiga was as a game machine, but wrong about its eventual place in the industry. And he was right about the future of CD-ROM, but bet too much on CD-I and 3DO. He was probably right about the power of the so-called set-top box, but he gambled on the bleeding edge of that technology. I le has definitely been the prophet of the computer game industry as the New Hollywood, and the full effect of that paradigm is yet to be seen. ------------5. Roberta Williams The original creative mind behind the Sierra product line, Roberta Williams is only listed below Ken Williams here because she has remained in the corporate background rather than on the front line. The fairer Williams created the first graphic adventure and was one of the first designers to build a full adventure from a female perspective (THE COLONEL'S BEQUEST, KING'S QUESTIV, PHANTASMAGORIA). Her KING'S QUEST series moved Sierra into the realms of EGA graphics, VGA graphics, movie-style soundtracks, parserless adventures, SVGA and, soon, 3D adventures. -software helped herald the European invasion of 3D adventure/role-playing products. He also deserves credit for the successful MacPlay division, which distributes Macintosh conversions of PC products, and the recent Engage! venture that is helping many companies bring multiplayer online products to market 4. Lord British 2. Ken Williams The ultimate entrepreneur, Ken I Williams literally moved from the kitchen table to the boardroom table with the inception of Sierra On-line. His programming of Roberta Williams's MYSTERY HOUSE, the original graphic adventure game, paved the way for Sierra's success. He shrewelly focused the company on making its own development tools, as well as establishing Sierra as a company driving technology such as VGA, the CD-ROM, a full-time online gaming network, and fullmotion video. Watch for Sierra to enter the hardware wars in the near future and drive other standards, including 3D graphics and electronic software distribution. 6. Joel Billings III A quiet player who isn't well known, A Joel Billings founded SSI in 1981 to build the kinds of games that he wanted to play. He recruited important talents like Chris Crawford, Dan Bunten, Cary Crigsby and Roger Keating to write war games. Later, he diversified by licensing the most sought-after pen-and-paper game property in history, DUNGEONS AND DRACONS, for a successful and unprecedented seven-year license. Today, Billings is the vice president of worldwide development for Mindscape, parent of SSI. 3. Brian Fargo Asfounder of Interplay Productions, A Brian Fargo has shown both brilliant product vision and great business instincts. He moved the computer role-playing noved the computer role-playing game out of the standard Ultima threequarter-overhcad perspective, and introduced three-point idle animation for the encounter windows on such products as THE BARD'S TALE, WASTELAND and DRAGON WARS. He helped break the heavy EA dominance on clistribution in the late '80s, and his success as an independent publisher and distributor of European Dichard n Garriott virtually defined computer role-playing. A firm believer in delivering hot new technology with each new ULTIMA, Carriott designed the most successful computer roleplaying game series in history. Through the years, the ULTIMA series has broken new ground in graphics, artificial intelligence, character generation, object-oriented worlds, and story. After leading Origin out of EAs Affiliated Label program over an intellectual propcrty dispute, Carriott and his brother Robert built a full product line and recruited Origin's second design superstar, Chris Roberts of WING COMMANDER fame. As creative director, Garriott was instrumental in building Origin into a real publisher. 7. Chris Crawford The game design guru during the early days of Atari, Chris Crawford was the first designer to write a primer on computer game design and has written more about game design than anyone. His TANKICS (a computerassisted board game design for Avalon Hill) and EASTERN FRONT (an carly Atari computer game design) sel standards for opponent Al in a war game. His geopolitical magnum opus, BALANCE OF POWER, NOVEMBER 1996 "


"10. John Carmark and Maxis as they sought to become independent publishers. established a new level of intricacy for game algorithms, and his TRUST & BETRAYAL: THE LEGACY OF SIBOOT introcuced icon-bascd speech and broke ground for experiments in artificial personality. Yet Crawford's greatest legacy to computer games was the founding of the Computer Game Developers Conference, now a major event with thousands of participants. The technological genius at id Software, John Carmack is largely responsible for the explosive growth of firstperson perspeclive action games. Without lais programming tricks and gaming instincts, it is questionable whether WOLFENSTEIN 3D, DOOM and QUAKE would have been made. Even games from other companies such as DARK FORCES and DUKE NUKEM 3Dowe much to the basic design of Carmacks games. In addition, id's titles proved the viability of sharcware as a distribution system, upgraded the public's perception of shareware quality, and accelerated the trend in multiplayer gaming, 13. Phil Adam Dhil Adam was one of the founders of Spectrum HoloByte, and he has built Interplay's marketing-and-sales effort into a powerhouse. More than a salesman, Adam lias been the foremost statesman for the computer game industry in the Software Publishers Association, standing Lip for the game industry with regard to game ratings, packaging issues and government regulatory issues. 8. Sid Meier No one game designer has as many CCW Hall of Fame games as Sid Meier. Meier once boasted to colleague Bill \"Wild Bill\" Stealey that he could write a combat flight program in days that woull put the commercially successful RED BARON coin-op game to shame. He was right. Meier's designs broke the mold at everything. Whether designing games about war, spics, railroading, civilization or pirates, Meier has always focused on what's fun and what works. Cames always seem to be so multifaceted in Sid's designs that it is hard to tell whether they are strategy or adventure. Meier recently left Micro Prose to form his own gamedesign company, Firaxis Software. 14. Jon Freeman on Freeman founded the first surviving U computer game company, Automated Simulations, which went on to become Epyx. Later, he became one of the first designers at Electronic Arts and formed his own design group with Anne Westfall (Freelall Associates). STARSHIP: ORION, TEMPLE OF APSHAI, ARCHON and many more would never have appeared without the efforts of this early pioneer. 11. \"Wild Bill\" Stealey ajor (now Colonel) Bill Stealey was the founder of both MicroProse Software and Interactive Magic. As entrepreneur, super salesman and industry \"character,\" Stealey has always concentrated on the necessity for this industry to be fun. Whether plotting the latest move in guerrilla marketing or the newest promotional gimmick, Stealey has been one of the great evangelists of the computer game industry. 9. Russell Sipe hen Russell Sipe founded Computer Gaming World in 1981, there was no regular source of information about computer games. Sipe believed that gamers would want news, reviews and strategies about computer games, and he envisioned a hobby that would grow and mature into a major entertainment industry. Under Sipe's leadership, the magazine grew from a small hobbyist publication to a full-scale consumer magazine. His emphasis on a high editorial standard of journalistic accuracy and fairness continues to this day. He also believed that a magazine should take stands in the industry by advocating positions that benefit gamers. Such is the legacy of the best in computer journalism. 12. Doug Carlston oug Carlston designed GALACTIC EMPIRE and GALACTIC TRADER, Iwo games that launched Brcerbund Software. A company founded by siblings (two brothers and a sister), Brderbund emphasized social responsibility from the beginning. In addition to game publishing, it has been a leader in cducational publishing and productivity software, as well. Because of its success in all three arcas, Bruderbund became one of the first entertainment companies to go public. For gamers, Brderbund's most important contribution may be the guidance and support it provided for Origin 15. Gilman Louie hairman of the board of Spectrum HoloByte, Louie designed a Star Treklike command simulation in the early '80s, and he is considered the visionary behind the legendary FALCON 3.0. His survival skills have kept him alive through the apparent suicide of financial backer Robert Maxwell, an attempted coup by former executives, and several quarters of major financial losses. As a simulation innovator and staunch advocate of multiplayer games, Louie is still an important influence on the future of computer games and hopes to lead Spectrum to a brighter future.

"FEATURE  NEXT 15 YEARS The Next 15 Years A Look Back From CGW's 30th Anniversary by Keith Ferrell Fall, 2011, Somewhere in the electroniverse: In Computer Game Magazine he 30th Anniversary Computer Gaming World was due any nano now and Jack couldn't wait. It was his birthday as well as CGW's, and that made it a special day. They were the same age and there was no question that they shared the same interests. LOO GAMES. Computer games. (Was there any other kind?) The only thing Jack lived for more than the moment the latest ish washed into his system was the games CGW covered. Jack lived to play and played to live-it was a happy arrangement. The aimless gameless didn't see it that way, of course, but then they never had. As a kid he'd had aunts and uncles, teachers, neighbors, even other kids who just didn't get it. But there were less of them every year, and every year Jackie cared less what they thought and listened less to what they said. Their words couldn't reach him over the multitracks that were games' latest rave. Besides, Jackie knew he was tracking right-otherwise why even when the New Mill was less than two years old had CGW moved past Reader's Digest as the world's biggest monthly? And that was when it was still on paper, for byte's sake. Well, it wasn't a paper world any more, and Jack wasn't a kid any. more either. But he still had a child's impatience on his birthday, and he figured he had a right to that. Waiting was never easy for him. But he had ways of passing time, of making time disappear... Jack submerged himself in his system, all senses extended, cataloging his game cosmos, powering up, stretching out, becoming one with his games You are, Jack thought as he surged outward, what you play.

"FEATURE. NEXT 15 YEARS improvements in the appearance, speed, and feel of computer games. The sorts of technologies that have attracted a lot of attention in bits and pieces-great graphics here, fantastic animation there, those sounds over there-are going to start coming together. \"I think we're undoubtedly going to see another jump in graphics capabilities,\" says Al Lowe. \"Combine that jump with increases in speed, movement, animation and you're going to get worlds where you can move anywhere, see anything from any angle, and do it while getting rid of those giant ugly pixels, letting us have gorgeously realistic high-res worlds to play in.\" Lowe thinks these advances, combined with larger monitors and per. haps even high resolution flat screens, are going to bring about a meld. ing of techniques. \"Cross the world of MYST,\" he says for example, \"with a fast action game, and think about what you can do. Graphically, there really aren't any limitations to the possibilities.\" No limits? \"It's like when I saw Jurassic Park for the first time,\" he says. \"I remember thinking, yeah-now you can do dinosaurs, real dinosaurs. You've got dinosaurs on the big screen, and we're on the brink of anything we want on computer screens.\" Plenty to look at then, and the odds are you won't be looking at it alone. NASA'S VIC-20 You have at your disposal far more computing power than NASA had when Neil Armstrong went to the moon. small screens, mostly without sound? We did call them computers they were computers, after all -and in the context of their times they looked more science fictional than they ever will again. Computers and computer games are so much a part of our electronic environment now that we've forgotten how revolutionary 64K (or less) and a green or amber screen were. \"I remember what a kick in the head it was to see the first MACPAINT,\" | says Al Lowe, designer of Sierra's LEISURE SUIT LARRY series. \"Black and white on that tiny screen, but wow.\" That was 1984, when the hottest games used... text. Today, we take it for granted that great graphics-and sound, and ani mation-are part of our games, and that they're going to get better. \"The computer manufacturers know this, too,\" says Derek Smart, designer of BATTLECRUISER 3000 AD, a game that's been in development long enough to see a number of generations of hardware become obsolete. \"They know that people use their machines for games, and that's why you're seeing 3D accelerators, plenty of RAM, and all of it on inexpensive machines.\" You have at your disposal more raw computing power than NASA had when Neil Armstrong went to the moon. You use it, as do most people who own personal computers, whatever they claim, to play games. Compared to 15 years ago-or 10 or five-you have everything you could ever want. But show me a gamer who's satisfied and I'll show you someone who's never had a dream. The best of today's games can't compete with our dreams of tomorrow's games, can they? So what will tomorrow bring? Whatever you want seems to be a pretty good guess. ALL TOGETHER NOW Drop back again-not even 15 years. Go back half a dozen and you'd be hard pressed to find more than a few hackers who could talk about the Internet. And if you had mentioned the World Wide Web, you'd be hailed as a visionary. (And if you'd invented it, you'd be rich.) But one truism of the computer revolution is that its waves of change move ever faster and connectivity via the net, the Web, services name your connectivity poison-came of age faster than any innovation in the history of the industry \"There's no question that future of computer gaming is multi-player,\" says Bill Stealey, president of Interactive Magic. Stealey's perspective goes back to the earliest days of personal computing: his first games at MicroProse were distributed in Ziplock bags. Today, Stealey thinks that the days of solo computer gaming may be nearing an end. «People will still go one-on-one with their computer games,\" he says, \"but primarily to practice for group sessions.\" The next five years, he argues, will see the groundwork laid for multiplayer gaming's dominance of the industry. The reasons are technologicalthe growth of the net, availability of high speed telecommunications, plenty of server power-but also social. \"Single play,\" Stealey says, \"just can't compete with the challenge of facing another person or group of people. You will have communication during games, teamwork, a sense of being part of something. Multiplayer computer games will become a social activity just like a softball game.\" Derek Smart thinks that multiplayer gaming will move to the forefront as well, but for reasons having much to do with the limitations of computer opponents. \"Gamers want to challenge a mind that is prone to flaw,\" he says, something you don't often (bugs and sloppy code notwithstanding) get with computer opponents. \"A serious player wants to be up against something equal or similar to himself, an alter ego, if you will.\" LOOK AT THAT! Short-term, call it five years out, we're looking at another round of NOVEMBER 1996 "

">FEATUR. NEXT 15 YEARS LIESURE SUIT BILL Lee thinks that the coming revolution in computer games will feed back into traditional art forms. \"Just as painters learned new tricks when photography came along, so will our novelists, and painters, and filmmakers add new tools to their palettes as computer games become themselves a fully recognized form of art.\" ing factor of not yet knowing what a computer game was supposed to be, and the industry just hasn't grown.\" Crawford blames this situation on the relent less quest for market share on the part games publishers. \"They decided that there were certain categories of games, and those are the same today as they were in the days of the Apple II, when the industry got started. Something is profoundly wrong about that.\" Crawford thinks it likely that the field will further divide over the next 15 years, splitting into the computer games industry and the interactive entertainment industry. Both sides, he feels, will be dominated by the same lowest-common-denominator marketing mindset that in Crawford's eyes has robbed the industry of any innovation IMMERSE YOURSELF Whatever form or shape, familiar or as yet unknown, tomorrow's computer games assume, there's little doubt that they will wrap them. selves around us and draw us into their realities to a degree we can only glimpse from our present perspective. Al Lowe thinks we'll actually see ourselves in games. \"A whole industry will grow up,\" he says, \"that will put your face, complete with expres sions, in your favorite games.\" LEISURE SUIT KEITH? The mind boggles. Bill Stealey sees a real golden age of interaction on the horizon. \"I want to create a virtual battlefield,\" he says, \"with lots of different equip ment, all of it linked, every player in communication, a real multiplayer virtual world.\" \"The fantastic worlds are going to be far more realistic,\" says Pat Cadigan, \"and thus far more persuasive. Our illusions are going to look very realistic... and that's going to raise the level of the entire gaming experience.\" Gentry Lee speculates about the possibility of a total experience. \"Your imagination working in concert with the storyteller's imagination and the game designer's imagination to create something that has never existed before. You could have something that's going to be far more real, and far more dangerously real than any reality you've left behind.\" The future has a way of surprising us. The boldest of speculators a decade ago did not foresee the power and affordability of even low-end systems today. And it may well be that even the boldest speculations in this piece pale beside the reality that unfolds as the next fifteen years pass... THE PAST IS PRELUDE Whether or not the seeds of a stagnant industry were sown over the past decade, a lot of lessons were learned. And each of those lessons, whether positive-\"this is great\"-or negative-\"ooops\"-pro. vides a foundation on which future games will be built. Having learned so much about the nature of computer games, it seems only fair that computer games should learn some things about us. At least that's the vision Pat Cadigan has. Among the most respected science fiction novelists currently working-her Synners should be required reading for anyone interested in evolving technological societies-Cadigan thinks we're about to see a leap in the intelligence and capability of our computer opponents. \"We're going to be playing against things that are more like living creatures,\" she says. \"Our artificial opponents are going to learn the ways in which we think and play, and they'll be putting that knowledge to work against us. They're going to be tougher, smarter, and more adaptable, all of which will make for better and better games.\" A serious student of the present, as well as of the future, Cadigan thinks too much is made of the power of computer games to \"steal\" us away from the \"real\" world. \"When people want to play games,\" she says,\" they're going to play games. And when they want insight into the human condition, they'll turn to media that offer insight into the human condition. Game players never mistake what they're doing for anything else, and it's a mistake to think that they do.\" Gentry Lee thinks that we may see a combination of game playing with those insights that traditionally come from other arts. \"Somewhere out there,\" he says, \"is a master who is going to be able to do it all, programming, writing, storytelling, game design, all of it. And when he or she arrives, their work will create the same sort of impact as the best of fiction, or art, or movies.\" ENDGAME Fall, 2011, somewhere in the electroniverse: The wave was here. Jackie felt it arrive, subtle nerve-stim letting him now the info-flow wave was breaking right now into his system, into him. He let the issue flow through him, became one with it, just as he did with the games he played. It was a greal issue and he would hold it livewire for a while. There were things to feel again before he archived it. A great issue, a great day. He felt his games calling to him again and before he yielded to the call Jack allowed himself one wistful thought. Sometimes when CGW flowed in, he missed Johnny Wilson, gone these last few years to follow his call of the ministry.

"FEATURE 3D CARDS The 3D Wave Hits The Shores Here's How The First Generation Of 3D Video Cards Really Stacks Up BY LOYD CASE Pros: Fastest Windows 2D performance in the MATROX MYSTIQUE roundup: good DOS; easy setup Cons: Lack of key 3D features, including bilinear filtering, fog and transparency f you've been eagerly anticipating the wave of 3D graphics cards, you're not alone. Our e-mail coffers have been over. flowing with requests for information on the performance of the first generation of 3D graphics accelerators. Last year, we saw the dominance of 64-bit, 2D graphics cards; this year, 3D is king. With that in mind, we split this survey into two parts, so we can take a look at the full spectrum of 3D offerings hitting the streets. This month, we look at the Matrox Mystique, three cards using the $3 ViRGE chip (Number Nine's Reality 332fx, the Hercules Terminator 3D, and the Diamond Stealth 3D 2000XL), and the ATI 3DXpression PC2TV, as well as two 3D-only add-on cards that use 3Dix's Voodoo chipset (Diamond's Monster 3D and Orchid's Righteous 3D). Oh yeah, did I mention we'll be looking at three 2D cards-the Hercules Dynamite/128 Video, VideoLogic Grafixstar 600, and STB Lightspeed 128-too? (Ho-hum.) The prying question is, Does 3D actually deliver? The short answer is Yes: you'll get better image quality, solid DOS performance (in most cases), and good Windows performance out of these first generation offerings. But as you'll see, the 3D performance of some of these cards isn't all it's cracked up to be. That said, let's dive into the numbers. with an enhanced version of MECHWARRIOR 2. Because of the lack of texture filtering, this version of MECH 2 doesn't look as good as ATI's version, and we didn't see that performance was markedly better than the ATI-enhanced MECHWARRIOR 2. The Mystique is a good choice where 2D graphics are the main thrust and 3D is only a secondary consideration. The Mystique's Winbench performance was the best of the roundup, and its DOS Software Bundle: MECHWARRIOR 2 (enhanced). SCORCHED PLANET, DESTRUCTION DERBY 2, MONSTER TRUCK RALLY (demo version), a soft ware MPEG playpack utility, and the WIRL VRML plug-in for Netscape 2.0 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0. Price: $199 for 2MB, $259 for 4MB $79 for 2MB to 4MB upgrade Contact: Matrox, Inc.

It delivered stellar Windows performance and solid DOS performance and was popular with many gamers. Matrox comes back this year with the Mystique, its first 3D accelera. tor tuned for the demands of computer games. The Mystique is kind of a mixed bag. Its 2D performance approaches that of its sibling, the Millennium, but its 3D feature set is somewhat lacking. According to Microsoft's 3D Test tool supplied with the DirectX 2.0 developer's kit, the Mystique should be a 3D screamer. However, this didn't turn out to be the case with HELLBENDER, a Direct3D game. We saw frame rates during heavy action as low as 4 frames per second (fps), even worse than the 2D cards in the roundup. On top of that, the Mystique lacks some key 3D image enhance ment features, such as bilinear filtering (which smoothes out blocky textures), alpha blending (for transparency) and fog effects. (For more information on 3D jargon, see the August issue.) The Mystique ships performance was second only to cards with the ET6000 chip, a 2D. only accelerator. Installation and documentation were up to Matrox's usual high standards, and we encountered no major installation headaches. The Mystique has VESA 2.0 SVGA support built in, avoiding the need for a VESA add-on utility like Scitech's Display Doctor. Also available is a set of daughterboard upgrades, including one for MPEG playback and another for NTSC video output for display on a television set. We reviewed Mystique last month, giving it four stars. But upon further review, we're inclined to revise that rating. Admittedly, performance in one Direct3D title is not a comprehensive indicator, but what we saw initially wasn't very encouraging. NOVEMBER 1996 CG "

"FEATURE 3D CARDS ISOU RESTAUD so that we didn't even bother printing them, since the 2D cards didn't meet our minimum criteria for 3D feature sets. But when we ran HELLBENDER, a Windows 95 Direct3D title, we saw frame rates ranging from 6 to 15 fps-not too shabby for a 2D-only card. For DOS games, the Hercules card excelled, edging out the STB Lightspeed/128 by a hair. Winbench performance, however, was the slowest of the three ET6000 cards at 1024x768x256 color by a wide margin, although all three cards were pretty much on par in the 640.

The DOS benchmarks were pretty much even with the Hercules Dynamite/128V and STB Lightspeed/128. The 1024x768x256-color Winbench score was the third highest, though the 640x480x65,530 performance trailed off. However, the Grafixstar 600 had two quirks that warrant mention: First, frame rate in DUKE NUKEM 3D was quite a bit slower than the other two ET6000-based cards. A more vexing problem was in its VESA 2.0 Super VGA implementation. When running QUAKE at 640-x480 resolution, the entire game took on a distinctly greenish cast, as if the green values had been pumped up and the red and blue values toned down. Curiously, we didn't observe the seasick lens\" effect in DUKE NUKEM 3D or Electronics Arts' ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS. Using Scitech's Display Doctor (formerly UniVBE) version 5.3, the problem disappeared.

"FEATURE 3D CARDS www.reloaded.com ships with a 2D card. The Lightspeed 128 comes with Sierra's EARTHSIEGE 2 and SILENT THUNDER (A-10 II), a limited edition of TERRA Nova (the first 10 missions), as well as a number of game demos from Sierra. The card itself performed quite well, running all the DOS applicareason #: 0019 Lies, Damned Lies, And Benchmarks ny test methodology is fraught with possible peril and erroneous results. A case in point are some of the toy applications that ship with Microsoft's Direct3D developer's kit. We looked at using two such applets: Tunnel and Twist. Several vendors are already quoting these numbers as 3D performance indicators, but caveat emptor. Unless you know which features are enabled or disabled, these frame rate numbers are at best suspect. Rather than look at frame rate data from these tools, we instead used Direct3D Test, also in Microsoft's Direct 3D kit. It too is far from perfect, but at least gave us a rough indication of 3D performance. Ziff-Davis will be developing a more comprehensive 3D benchmark, due out sometime next year. Here's how we tested: First, the system was always the same, except for the graphics card. We used a Pentium 166 running on a Triton Il chipset motherboard, with 32MB of EDO DRAM and 512KB of pipeline burst L2 cache. If the card supported it, the refresh rate was always 75Hz. We used games wherever possible as test tools, as well as Winbench 96 and CBENCH, a simple DOS 3D performance metric written by Chris Dial. Unfortunately, finished Direct3D titles were lacking at press time, but we were able to use Microsoft's new HELLBENDER, which had a simple frame rate counter. We ran HELLBENDER with all graphics features cranked up with a 640x480 frame size. Another problem: HELLBENDER is able (via Direct3D) to detect and automatically enable or disable rendering features to achieve optimal game performance, but a Direct3D game may not tell you which features are enabled and disabled, even if you set all graphics options to the highest level. Bear in mind that using HELLBENDER AS our sole Direct3D game-as-performance metric, we got an indication of 3D performance, not the final word. That won't be forthcoming until more games-as-tools are finished and shipping. In using Direct3D Test, we ran at two different test settingsboth at 640x480x65,530 colors-representing different performance points. The minimum feature set allows for the highest possible frame rate. For the minimum test, the settings were: . Flat shading  Perspective correction disabled for texture maps  Point filtering (rather than the more demanding bilinear filtering). BD GRAPHIC CARDS Turning on additional rendering features improves individual frame image quality, usually at the expense of frame rate. Our maximum settings were:  Gouraud shading enabled  Bilinear filtering enabled  Perspective-correction enabled We looked at pixel fill rate and polygon throughput data generated by Direct3D Test. Pixel fill rate is how fast the card can blast pixels onto a surface, and polygon throughput measures how fast polygons are generated (rendered). Bear in mind that if you don't know which features are enabled and disabled, these numbers become all but meaningless. Long story short, the 3D numbers here are initial performance indicators, but the full performance story can't be told until more Direct3D titles ship and we see how 3D hardware fares accelerating them. Rest assured, we'll keep you posted. --Loyd Case and Dave Salvator hard core action Circle Reader Service #198 NOVEMBER 1996 "

DEDICATED 3D CARDS This month, we take a look at a pair of dedicated 3D add-on cards, one each from Orchid Technologies and Diamond Multimedia. These cards require the presence of a standard graphics adapter for VGA, SVGA and Windows 2D chores. Both cards use the 3Dfx Voodoo 3D chipset, and both come with 2MB of EDO DRAM for frame buffer (display memory) and 2MB of memory for storing textures. The 3Dfx-based cards use a passthrough cable, so you connect a cable from your standard graphics card to the 3Dfx card and attach your monitor cable to a second connector on the 3D card. When running accelerated 3D titles, the 3Dix chipset completely takes over and is not dependent on the 2D card's performance. The cool thing about these add-on cards is that they'll even work with the more mainstream 3D cards, such as cards using the VIRGE and ATI chipsets, taking over the 3D chores when necessary. In fact, Several system vendors are doing S3/3Dfx or ATI/3Dfx combinations for their graphics subsystems. Look for them next month in our \"Ultimate Game Machine\" feature. The list of features of the Voodoo chipset is a mile long: bilinear filtering, trilinear MIP-mapping, alpha blending, fog effects, accelerated light sources. Let's take a look at the two implementations, which actually differ more than a first glance might indicate 3D perfor mance on both was impressive, and as more titles ship that take advantage of Direct3D, these will be the cards to have-if you have the bucks.

Price: $299 Contact (800) 577-0977 AND THE WINNER IS... The age of 3D acceleration is finally upon us, with mainstream acceler: ators like the Diamond Stealth 3D and the ATI 3D Xpression bringing a new level of reality and perfor: mance to the standard PC. Adding a dedicated board like the Righteous 3D can propel 3D game performance into orbit. Bear in mind, however, that to gain the benefits of 3D acceleration, a game must be written to take advantage of the hardware. So don't expect Doom or F15 STRIKE EAGLE III to run any faster on these cards. A point to consider: Given the aggressive pricing of many of the 4MB boards, you'd do well to spend a little extra now for more 3D performance up the road. Rumors of the demise of 2D boards have been greatly exaggerat ed, as the new ET6000-based cards from Hercules, STB and VideoLogic attest. These cards offer superior DOS performance, top. notch 2D Windows performance, and terrific prices. Of the mainstream cards, there aren't any clear winners per se, though the Matrox Mystique proved something of a disappointment. We'd give the nod in performance to the Diamond Stealth 3D 2000 for its smooth implementation and balanced performance. The ATI card would be an interesting choice if DOS VGA performance weren't a critical factor. The Hercules Terminator 3D is a tough value to beat, with reasonable performance coupled with a very aggressive price. The best combination, however, would be to meld the 2D perfor mance of a Matrox Mystique, Diamond Stealth or Lightspeed 128 with the Righteous 3D. Then you'd have the hottest graphics setup for gaming around not to mention one of the priciest at least for a while. Next month, we'll be reviewing Creative Labs' long anticipated 3D Blaster, as well as Rendition-based boards from Intergraph and Sierra (yes, Sierra). We'll also take a look at some cards using 3D Labs' Permedia chipset and some higher end S3-based cards using the ViRGE/VX chipset, and we'll put the intriguing PowerVR through its paces.

"LOYD CASE Hit me, baby. A9 010 N123 these features enable the Pentium Pro's Level 1 cache to work more efficiently with graphics output. The result is a dramatic increase in fgame graphics performance NUKEM 3D, thc Pentium Pro system clearly outpaces the Pentium 166 and the Cyrix 6x86. However, to get the greatest performance boost out of the Pentium Pro, you need to download a little utility written by John Hinckley (110, not the guy who took a shot at President Bonzo) called FastVid, which enables some key features on the Pentium Pro that are clisabled by default. These features are-brace yourself write posting, banked VCA write combining and SVGA linear frame buffer write combining. Without getting into too many nuts and bolts, FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY... Then there's the matter of floating point calculations, those arithmetic operations that use noninteger arithmetic for calculations. Most games today use integers (ie, whole numbers) for many calculations, but more and more graphicsintensive 3D games will more than likely use floating-point calculations for geometry setup. Some current titles-QUAKE TIPS! BLACKJACK WITH ATTITUDE Why play alone when you can play Hoyle\"? Only Hoyle offers unique spirited opponents, three modes of play, tournaments, and Internet options. In short, only Hoyle has Blackjack with attitude. How Do You Rate? Testing systems is a tricky business. Even when you think everything is identical except for the item you're testingthe graphics card, for example-you find that results can change from one test to another. Still, here are some hints on testing your own system with real applications Duke Nukem 3D: Run the Duke Nukem 3D setup program and choose the resolution you want to test; turning off sound will give you a better frame rate number. Save the configuration. At the DOS prompt, type \"duke3d /m/11 783\". When the spaceship crashes and you're actually in the game, type \"DNRATE\" without moving Duke. You'll see a continually refreshed frame rate number at the upper left corner of the screen. HOYLE BLACK CBench: Download CBENCH from CompuServe's Flight Simulator Forum library 13 or from http://www.dfw.net Irsdw/chris3d.html. CBENCH is a \"synthetic\" benchmark, whose only purpose in life is to test the performance of your graphics system. There are two programs, BENCH, which tests VGA perfor mance, and SVGABNCH, which tests SVGA performance. ATF: To test ATF frame rates, go into the pro mission builder. Create a mission with only one plane (yours) and have it sitting on a runway. Other aircraft or objects will affect frame rate in an unpredictable way. Enter the mission. Disable the joystick, since it eats into CPU performance and the potential maximum frame rate. When sitting in your cockpit, and the plane is idle, hit Ctrl-F (press the Control key and the F key simultaneously). You will see a number representing frame rate in frames per second at the bottom of your screen ACK Finally, to get WinBench test results, you can order a copy of the new WinBench 97 (available in midNovember) from Ziff-Davis's benchmark operation group. Drop them a postcard and ask for the Winbench 97 CD-ROM: SIERRA  QUAKE: To test Quake's frame rate, bring up the console window (press the key) and type TIMEREFRESH.

"LOYD CASE for example-already do. As it turns out, the Cyrix 6x86's floating-point unit (FPU) is slower than the comparable Pentium's. In turn, the Pentium's FPU hardware is slower than the Pentium Pro's, which explains why the QUAKE numbers vary greatly from one processor to another. Also, the Pentium Pro shines in performing 32-bit operations -and all Win 95 titles these days are created using 32. bit technology (as opposed to older games using 16-bit technology). ATF is a 32-bit game, and hence benefits from the Pentium Pro. The faster clock rate doesn't hurt either. However, the Pentium Pro doesn't work well with 8and 16-bit operations, which shows up in the DUKE NUKEM 3D frame rate results. As it turns out, DUKE NUKEM 3D uses a lot of 8and 16-bit operations, and the Pentium Pro's performance under DUKE suffers as a result. Initially I was disappointed in the performance of the Cyrix chip, but A9010 NH231 upon reflection, I realized it's pretty much performing at its potential. The 6x86 P166+ costs less than the Pentium 166, and the Cyrix chip actually runs at 133 MHz, not 166 MHz. So is Cyrix's 6x86 P166+ a Pentium 166 killer? For gaming, not really. It dusts the Pentium 133 for integer performance, but its floating point performance doesn't quite stack up. On the other hand, if you're on a tight budget, and you don't see yourself running a lot of floatingpoint-intensive games, then the 6x86 is worth considering. But if you're not on a tight budget, you'd do well to consider the Pentium 166. What about the Pentium 200? I haven't actually tested a system using the Pentium 200, but initial reports indicate that the Pentium 200 runs only about 10 percent faster than the Pentium 166. Interestingly, the 200MHz Pentium Pro costs less at some outlets than the 200MHz Pentiums. LAB NOTES Something Klamath This Way Comes.. The next-generation Pentium Pro chip, code-named Klamath, will have some interesting features. The built-in Level 2 (L2) cache will no longer be permanently attached. Instead, there will be a snap-in module that may support cache sizes larger than 512KB. The detachable cache module will run a little slower than the current built-in L2 cache, but will run at a faster clock rate and will have a larger Level 1 cache. Intel will apparently offer Pentium Pro overdrive upgrades, for existing Pentium Pros, that will run at a higher clock rate and have Intel's MMX instruction set built in.

"LOYD CASE doesn't want to get into the actual business of making graphics hardware; but instead wants to drive what they hope will be a standard specification (theirs), and license the technology to bardware vendors. Although Microsoft has strayed into the hardware business on occasion (the Windows Sound System, Microsoft Mouse and Sidewinder 3D joystick), Talisman appears to be much more ambitious. The AGP-based Talisman specification is very aggressive, calling for 75 frames per second running at 1024 x 768 x 24-bit color. More on this in next month's 3D graphics board feature. TECHNOLOGY WHEN YOU'RE BLASTING DOWN LIENS SPINNING CONTROL MOTHERBOARDS AND OTHER RANTS On to my next soapbox. Motherboard technology is advancing, tooin some ways faster than CPU technology The core logic chipset or CPU support logic are those components on your computer's main system board that handle all the traffic-cop chores for moving data around. Recently, Intel has released a new core logic chipset for the Pentium. These new chips, collectively known as Triton II, have greatly streamlined data paths. In fact, it's possible now to build a mother board that exceeds the capabilities of other components in the system if the designer isn't careful. I had a recent experience with one company whose motherboard wasn't ready for prime time. In truth, all they did was include a BIOS feature that could really juice up memory accesses-except that most people's memory couldn't handle, creating lockups and other problems. \"To be fair, the company did fix the problem, and most 'Triton Il motherboards work quite well. On the positive side, Intel also released a new chipset, code-named Natoma, for Pentium Pro systems. Natoma-based systems can use EDO DRAM and are much less problematic than systems using the older Orion chip-set. If you decide to roll your own upgrade, definitely look for boards using the newer chipsets. By the way, if you decide to get one of the Cyrix processors, check with Cyrix to make sure your motherboard is supported. Better yet, buy a whole system. The P150+, the P166+ and the P200+ chips all generate a lot of heat, so a cooling fan is a must. Also, the P200+ las an external clock frequencythe speed at which it communicates with the memory bus-of 75MHz, whereas just about all other systems' memory busses run at 66MHz. Most motherboards can't handle the faster bus speed, so make sure the board you get has a memory bus capable of running at 75MIIZ. Finally, what's in store for the future? Intel's MMX technology will show up in Pentium processors early next year, and MMX could have a significant impact on 2D graphics performance and audio. MMX will also be embedded in the Pentium Pro later in 1997. Another interesting development, Intel's Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) will be a special interface slot for graphics cards that will take voluminous 3D graphics traffic off the PCI bus and promises upwards of four times the PCI bus's maximum throughput. Finally, Microsoft seems to have dipped a toe in the graphics hardware business. At SICCRAPH, the annual conference for graphics gurus, Microsoft announced a reference hardware platform they call Talisman, specifically tuned to accelerate DirectDraw and Direct3D applications.

Set in an inspecified future in the city of Neutropolis, it follows the zany antics of Kent, an unkempt teenage malcontent who just wants to be left alone to do his own thing. Naturally. that's not about to happen. Neutropolis isn't going to get on anyone's most-livable-cities list. A permanent cloud of smog hangs over the city, obscuring sun and sky. Normtroopers are everywhere, ready to enforce the \"Stay Normal\" motto of Leader Paul, one way or another, which usually means a stretch in the feared Blue Pens for the nonconformist.

Its first Ravenloft game, Iron & Blood, will be published by Acclaim Entertainment. Finally, SSI now only has the rights to finish its DARK SUN ONLINE; it does not have the rights to the rest of the Dark Sun world, which are up for grabs. SSI does have the license for the Rod of Seven Parts adventure, and is planning a game for a 1997 release. on that, it isn't long before he becomes involved with an underground movement, of sorts. \"Of sorts,\" because as rebels, these folks are on the ineffectual side.

The eyes look at something, while the chest is used to open doors or other objects. Moving around locations can be done using cursor keys or mouse; I found that the keyboard was generally casier. The view is mostly first-person 3D, although there are many cut scenes and automated sequences where Kent appears on screen. Usually these happen when Kent performs an action that is especially important, or especially bizarre. It's also possible to look up or down by using the Page Up and Page Down keys. Movement between locations is accomplished by using a map. Places Kent can visit light up as the cursor touches them; clicking the mouse takes him there. Some areas are available thoughout the game, while others are reachable only once. Kent has to learn about, or be sent to, most locations to get ROCKET BABE Join the revolution and meet fabulous revolutionary babes, such as the specimen shown here, ready to light your fire. that attitude changes a bit, and suckdenly our hero becomes the «man of all work\" for the rebels.

Occasionally, the conversat ion will be automatic between Kent and the other person, but most of the time, you have several topics to choose from.

It's obvious that the security guard has an aversion to rats, but scaring him with the rubber rat from the mall is not good enough. If you think back to the beginning of the game, you should recall that there's a real rat trapped in your washing machine at home. To open the machine, you're going to need to smash the door with a heavy (frozen) object.  Painting the waffle sculpture yellow, as Heather asks you to do, is no easy task. The first thing to do is to find the extinguisher and fill it with the yellow paint in the barrel by the river. Does the Norm confiscate the extinguisher when you try to go back?

As you probably know, PANDORA has seven possible endings. Which one you get depends for the most part on how les reacts to people, what cleals he accepts or refuses, and how he handles his relationship with Chelsee. This is entirely up to the player, so I'm not saying much about that, especially as the game path has little cffect on the puzzles. I will mention one milestone along the way: If you take Chelsee to the Flamingo, you're not on Mission Street DAY ONE This is get-acquainted-with-theneighborhood day. Mostly you hit thic stores around the block, finding out exactly how much Tex owes everyone. Paying up is a smart idea, but it's best to leave Nilo at the Ritz for last, as that gets you into a certain apartment and ends the day. DAY THREE Abusy one. First, you have to reconstruct the torn note (pretty simple, this one). Who would know best about stalkers and killers? Right, go have a chat with him.

You'll also probably want to check out the BAK's most recent victim; ask the most likely person, and be sure to look around the room very carcfully. Now you get to break into the offices of a hush-hush federal agency (a PI's work is never done). First, you have to get the clipboard from the receptionist's desk (good thing no one is around, eh?). Everything you need is close at hand; pay special attention to the blinds and table. I suggest saving right after you pass through the locked door if you're in Game Player mode. There's a guard to be dealt with, which is best done by hightailing it down the left corridor to the storage room and close the door behind you!). From this vantage point, it shouldn't take you long to figure out how to give the guard the slip (in more ways than one). Then you can snoop DAY TWO Recovering from the traditional \"P! gets conked on the headl\" routine, you have the chance to search Malloy's apartment. \"Take your time, look everywhere, and be sure to examine all you find.

While you were playing DOOM, your grandmother was playing Myst. It's been a permanent resident at the top of the sales charts, and industry bean-counters say that close to 4 million people have taken a crack at the game.

Parroty also plans on expanding the site to include non-Psr chuckles and other parodies as the product line grows, as well as links to other humor sites on the Web. The disc includes a trailer of Jolm Goodman singing the \"Theme from Pysi\" and a short movie chronicling the making of Psr, which is at least as funny as the parody itself. Pyst is expected to ship in mid-October as a hybrid Windows-Mac CD-ROM. At a street price of about $14.95, this might be just the right stocking stuffer for the favorite Mysr-basher in your life. ADVENTURE/RPG There Goes TheNeighborhood The Dock After Worlock urinates, toxic waste oozes into the sea and we see just how bad things have become for poor Pyst Island. But they're about to get worse. The Octoplex Corporation has big plans to tum Pyst into a resort community, with condominiums, a golf course, even a jet ski marina. Right away we meet our Octoplex representatives, Bob and Cheryl, a pair so perky they make the Entertainment Tonight anchors sound positively sullen. Before Octoplex breaks ground, however, they're going to have to do something about that family of aliens that's taken up residence in the rocket ship. Oh, and in case you're wondering what happened to the mysterious creator of our fair island, he hasn't been left out. John Goodman plays the foggy King Matruss, who's since found a much better use for that furnace in the log cabin. He really wants to get rid of the riffraff who've invaded his peaceful kingdom, but he can't seem to get around to doing anything about it. Those two ne'er-dowell sons of his are still hanging around, too. The delicate Prince Syrrup appears to have developed a nervous condition from interacting with so many island explorers (well, who could blame him?). His brother, on the other hand, the Prince (formerly known as Prince), has fared much better and seems to be settling into his newfound celebrity quite well. As mentioned earlier, Pst is not a game and doesn't pretend to be more than it is-a one-joke dig at a pompous, over-lyped product. Even so, not all the humor in Pysr is directed towarch its inspiration. Peter Bergman, cofounder of the venerated Firesign Theater comedy ensemble, created the video and audio clips, so many of the jokes derive as much from American pop culture and current cvents as they do from Myst. While this gives Pista wider appeal, it's a little disappointing that the creators passed up some of the more obvious chances for having fin at Mysi's expense Parroly's Pyss plans don't stop with the CD-ROM. A Web site accessible directly from the program is being set up that will allow users to c-mail Pyst postcards to Alien Ticarb PYST -TILT 3 Tres Ckck Nest The Low Colin Serving as a stern warning about environmental awareness, Pyst shows what happens when millions of nosy adventure gamers poke around your magic island, pulling levers, playing in your space ship, and generally futzing with everything in sight.

After all of their spells, conjuring, and attempts to see the future, the future literally crashed down upon them. With deadly force. It left an indelible mark. It affected their vision. Their movement. Their way of life and death. It changed their history as well as their future. Introducing DESCENT TO UNDERMOUNTAIN», the most revolutionary new AD&D FORGOTTEN REALMS action RPG game in centuries. Based on the hugely successful Descent engine, the dark inhabitants of Undermountain's stone belly now experience 3D vision and 360° movement. Perhaps it was the strange visitor from the future.

All of this, along with multiple player options has forever changed the face of the AD&D FORGOTTEN REALMS world.

When the pace seems too slow, Klaymen makes up for it with some cute action or expression. ADVENTURE/RPG trees and architecture. 'INC even has its equivalent of the postage-stamp video that passed for interaction in Mysr; the difference is that 'INC's video consists of cute, animated cartoons that delightfully unfold the story of the game universe. Yet there is much more happening in NEVERHOOD than appears at first. Playing with a jack-in-the-box sets free a monster and triggers a delightful free-running animation sequence--not only setting up a new puzzle but opening up a new area of exploration. Choosing the wrong solution lo a puzzle evokes cartoon consequences, like being punched out flat or temporarily decapitated, but it's all good fun because the game subscribes to the \"no-death\" school of adventure game design. You never have to go back and restart again. Plus the idle animation is priceless (leave poor Klaymen alone too long and he'll stretch his arms all the way across the screen or blinks expectantly).

Shoot 'Em In GENDER WARS Like t's been a crowded house ever since CRUSADER: NO REMORSE revitalized the platform shooter with its isometric look So any attempt at an angled-down action game these days needs an angle, and GENDER WARS from CT Interactive gives it a shot. It's a respectable, if not wholly original game, mingling CRUSADERstyle pyrotechnics with squad-level tactics, a touch of WARCRAFT's parallel sets of missions and something of a sense of humor. GENDER WARS is a literal Battle of the Sexes that replaces the traditional wit and wile with firepower. You pick a side and from there are carted off to a command Where TOTAL MAYHEM blew up the view, GENDER WARS' SVGA mode shrinks it down to doll-house level, and to good effect. The levels are enormous, both in height and breadth, and it shows. Even the most basic of the multiple mission objectives-get this item, kill so many of these enemies will take some good time to achieve. Moving, firing and button-pushing with the mouse, you'll roam elaborate interiors and grounds, blowing the bejesus out of enemy conference tables, posters, mainframes and level inhabitants. As for your squad Al, you can issue four collective commands to the squad members: fire at will, fall back, fire defensively, or await control from you. Like CRUSADER, there is plenty to blow up while traipsing through each level. I suspect that, destroyable item for destroyable item, there's an even higher level of damage here than in CRUSADER: NO RECRET. CRUSADER, there is plenty to blow up while traipsing through each THEY'RE ON PMS! GENDER WARS is supposed to be a battle of the sexes, but with little difference between the two sides, this angle is more of a gimmick than a real design decision. level.

Give (number) = gives you the appropriate weapon (8 is the lightning gun). Noclip = lets you walk through walls. Impulse 9 = all weapons and ammo. Impulse 255 = quad damage mode. To use these cheats in DeathMatch, you'll need to make a hack with the QUAKE compiler (see the V Long's Quake Hacks for details). Simply edit the WEAPONS.

DESCENT II: DESCENT II only has six secret levels, but they aren't the easiest to find. The first can be reached via levels 3 and 4; the second from levels 5 and 8; the third via level 12: the fourth via level 14: the fifth via levels 17 and 20; and the last via levels 21 and 24 had something here. But this appears to be more a presentation concept than a game design. A Battle of the Sexes is also ripe with potential for humor, but at times, you can tell that The Sth Day tried too hard. The intro's robot-hosted TV show rapidly degenerates into a profane, Pythonesque exchange between the two talking heads. But the pre-mission cut scenes are leaden and obvious, and the missions are humorless firestorms. The game itself works well for the most part. Troops do have some trouble following the leader when lifts come into play, and you'll often need to switch control to individual squad members to reunite the party (just as in TOTAL MAYHEM). But GENDER WARS was pleasantly free of technical glitches. I ran into just one, and it was more of a \"feature.\" On two Pentiums with different video cards, movement of characters in SVCA mole was accompanied by a shuddering display and the APPEAL: Those tired of waiting for CRUSADER: NO REGRET and looking for some nonsensical, combustible action.

"***** REVIEW  SHELLSHOCK DIFFICULTY LEVEL INTERMEDIATE NOITV Keep Da Peace Making Noise In The Hood With Eidos'3D Tank Shooter by Mark Clarkson DE...5 HELLSHOCK, the new firstperson shooter from Eidos, drops you behind the controls of an M-13 Battletank with unlimited ammunition to kick evil oppressor butt all over the globe. To set this shooter apart from the crowd, Eidos gave it a distinctly urban vibe, with a pounding, bass-heavy soundtrack, and a collection of slang-slingin' homies with names like 9-1-1, Dogg-Tagg, and D-Tour. SHELLSHOCK's driving model is a good compromise between fun and realism. You can control the turret separately, swinging it around to shoot sideways as you fly between buildings at full speed or behind you to slow down any pesky pursucrs. Your view also clips and bobs as you CA HAIN GUN STARING DOWN A BARREL SHELLSHOCK's 25 missions show a little variety. One time you're out to blow up tanks and armored transports; the next time you'll be destroying buildings or rescuing prisoners. negotiate terrain and torch bad guys. Or you can, if you're so inclined, drive your tank in a more realistic and complicated two-track mode; each track has its own forward and backward keys. the spoken clips are fine, others are unintelligible. There are only four save game slots, and you can only save between missions. When you die, you must restart the entire game, skip past the intro, reload a saved game, and skip through the briefing-an annoying 30-second process. Still, while SHELLSHOCK doesn't set any new standards, it is fun and loud. Your M-13 rips through chain-link fences and snaps street lights like twigs, all while thumping music blares in the background. And best of all, in a LAN-based multiplayer game you can hurl both shells and taunts at your real-life homies.

"DENNIS MCCAULEY  SPORTS sponopop LA New Players Hit The Gridiron usu rules Three Expansion Teams Train For The Digital Football Playoffs t's human nature to pull for the underdog. What kid doesn't cheer when the neighborhood bully finally gets his? Does anyone outside Chicago or Dallas root for the Bulls or Cowboys anymore? A similar state exists among computer football sims. For several years Sierra's FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL PRO series has played Goliath to everyone else's David. Of course, there's been a reason for FRONT PACE's success. Sierra's series has been very, very good, breaking new ground and winning three CGW Sports Game of the Year awards along the way. But with S1 billion in annual sales, the software gaming market is an intensely competitive arena. Even Goliath can't afford to kick back, although that's what Sierra appeared to do last year. My CGW review (March) of FPS FOOTBALL PRO '96 noted the malaise, and many gamers seem to agree. Quite a few FRONT PAGE leagues eschew the most recent edition, sticking with, \"95 instead. And for the first time in years, FRONT PAGE humbled the CGW Sports Came of the Year Crown, which went to NBA LIVE 96. Rival sports game companies have also noticed Coliathi's misstep. Like sharks smelling blood, Sierra's competitors have retooled and swarmed into the current football season loaded for bear-FRONT Pace bear. Sierra's competitors swarmed into the football season loaded for bearFRONT PAGE NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK The frantic competition should result in a fascinating year for football sim players. FRONT PAGE is back, but will be fighting that feeling that comes from an extended stay with the same system. Consequently, this year's excitement will likely come from one of the three big graphical sims that are making their debut. I can't remember a football season with more hotly anticipated releases, or a showdown that's had as much of a playoff feel. So who are the rookies who are taking on computer football's wily veteran? Emerging from the misty shores of vaporland, EA Sport's JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL. 97 will make its long-awaited debut on the PC. It was expected last season, but EA decided to red shirt JMF for one more year. We'll know soon if the extra conditioning paid off when this console hit blitzes the PC for the first time. Leveraging the riches of ABC and Disney, Overtime Sports' first game will be MONDAY NGHT FOOTBALL, a multimedia extravaganza that's after the glitz and excitement that pro football brings to prime-time TV. (For a scouting report on MNF, check out Terry Coleman's detailed preview in the September issue.) The thircl, and in some ways most intriguing FRONT PAGE rival is LEGENDS FOOTBALL '97. Accolade has pinned its hopes on LEGENDS after three seasons of UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. While every game has a hook, LEGENDS' is unique, promising authentic NFL play across four different eras: 1932, 1950, 1968, and the present. From the leather helmet days to Steve Van Buren to Cale Sayers to Emmitt Smith, huh? OK, Accolade, you've got my attention. What now? \"The thing that's getting the most hype,\" confirins the game's producer, Kevin Hogan, «is the LEGENDS concept, which is the ability to play in multiple cras.

Palmer's swing process is particularly authentic, including his characteristic gyrations following each shot. Adding to the realism are Amie's colorful comments, such as, \"I was moving off that ball,\" \"That is much better,\" and even the classic \"Looks like you hit the tree, Jim.\" In addition to the cyber-Arnie, you can set up both luuman and computer players; the latter add a much-needed sense of competition to this game.

"REVIEW  LINKS LS Post Shot Selection VOOR SP 6 1 yerde SPORTS my first game with Arnic, I chose Match Play, the oldest and most traditional form of competition. When taking on human players, you can compete on a single machine or connect via modem or localarea network. The Latrobe course and simulated Amol Palmer included with LINKS LS are just the first entries in Access's new 'Tour Player Scries. Other famous professional golfers will follow, along with their home courses. SWING I MEANT TO DO THAT Hitting your ball close to the concrete makes it much easier to get back to the cart. COURSE WARE Following my match with Amic, I ventured to the windswept coast of Maui lo play the famed Kapalua Village and Plantation courses, also included with the game. A striking difference to the Hawaii courses is always knowing in which direction the ocean lics, thanks to the crisp environmental 16-bit 3D stereo sound. As a thank-you for longtime Links supporters who have already invested in the numerous add-on courses, Access has included 17 of the SVGA courses used with LINKS 386 PRO and LINKS 386 CD on disc 2 of the three-CD sct. Simply point LINKS LS at the disc containing the original course, and the program will install an enhanced LS version. Although these courses don't quite match the image quality or offer the animated fly-bys of the native LS courses. they are enhanced significantly from the originals. ACE IN THE HOLE LINKS LS is more than just a run-ofthe-mill franchise update the interface changes and more realistic sound and graphics give this classic golf game a really new feel, while new match play against Amic and other pro golfers gives LINKS Samuch welcomed competitive edge. And, lest anyone tell you that playing computer golf is a waste of time, the player animation is so great that you could actually get some good ideas for improving your real-life golf swing and course management through thoughtful playing of this game. Perhaps the only improvement this golfer can suggest would be to allow the player to be positioned anywhere in the teeing area when setting up for the shot. All in all, however, this is a great way to spend a Saturday when the real links are rained out. Unlike the swing-challenged, flight simfixated Jr. edition, Denny Atkin Sr. is most at home on a golf course, as is evidenced by his recent capture of the 1996 Club Champion, Handicap Flight title at Oregon's Tialatin Country Club The Virtual Clubhouse Ithough I couldn't wait to get to the golf game with Arnie, the standout extras included in the three-CD-ROM package turned out to be thrilling additions for any real golf fan. Two virtual reality 3D tours-Kapalua's Plantation Clubhouse and Arnold Palmer's office and workshop-use the engine from Access's THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE adventure game to let you walk from room to room and zoom in on specific items of interest. The virtual tours are amazingly accurateYou move freely down the hallways of the opulent Plantation course clubhouse. Make your way down the circular staircase to the lower lobby where you'll find the Victory Wall, on which past Kapalua champions are displayed. In all, 93 points of interest are explained with a simple click of the mouse. Amold Palmer fans will love the virtual tour of Arnie's workshop, office and trophy room. I really enjoyed the feeling of being there, in my idol's private place. Also, video footage allows us to listen to Palmer's insights and recollections of his PGA and Senior tour memories.

Like Crichton, who has perfected a captivating story-telling formula in his novels (Jurassic Park, Disclosure, et al) that eschews realism or social significance but nicely stretches the imagination, EA Sports creates games that are just plain fun to have on the hard drive.

"REVIEW  TRIPLE PLAY 97 SPORTS The computer selects the same lineup for all league games, so backups do not play. While it tends never to replace pitchers in head-to-head play, it takes them out much too carly in simulated games. Every team has a reliever appearing in 120 to 150 games per scason. To keep things moving at a fast pace, the game's designers obviously weren't too concemned about getting into the meat of simulating baseball and it works, sort of, as games are simulated quickly at least with attractive, circular menus. Viewing the game's limited statistics however, is a bit tedious. Setting or changing a lineup is very difficult, and if you make an ingame mistake trying to figure out player changes, you cannot undo that change. Adding the use of WHO YOU CALLING A BLIMP?

PENNANT WINNER Overall, TRIPLE PLAY 97 has state-ofthe-art graphics, a decent interface and solid action gameplay -but not much in the way of realism. Comparison to other recent releases, like Sierra's Front Page SPORTS BASEBALL PRO '96, is a little difficult. FPSBB '96 attempts elements like a realistic physics model of a baseball in flight, while TP 97 has a few flight paths built in, some directly defying the laws of physics. FPSBB '96 makes a token effort at league management and statistical realism, while TP 97 completely ignores these functions. But TP 97, like Michael Crichton, does entertain, while FPSBB '96 reads a lot like some college consortium of literary critics trying to create the Great American Novel. Everything's there, but somehow it never comes together. Though EA Sports has done a good job here, the graphics-based computer baseball genre still awaits its masterpiece. No game has completely succeeded yet in capturing both our trigger fingers and our imaginations. In the meantime, though, TRIPLE PLAY 97 is a very fun diversion ESPORTS APPEAL: Console sports gamers looking for an action baseball game for their PC. PROS: Easy-to-use interface, smooth and pretty graphics; excellent arcade action; a well-implemented home run derby, modem play.

There are also ambient sounds, such as the crowd, the crack of the bat and the peanut vendor, that succeed to some extent in adding atmosphere. However, I found that on my AWE 32, the general crowd sound had an underlying loud, rhythmic thump that was quite distracting Overall, Strat-O-Matic's first foray into Windows and CD-ROM gaming has to be considered a success.

APPEAL: Hardcore basbeball gamers and stat freaks who value accurate simulation over all else PROS: Top-notch statistical engine, excellent player management tools, fast and accurate replays, complete major league rosters. >CONS: Ho-hum sound and graphics, key disk protection scheme, misguided attempt to inject arcade action into game system.

"DENNY ATKINSIMULATION/SPACE sim 0 tin su Get A Hold Of This Action that lates CH's New Force-Feedback Joystick Is A Wrist-Wrenching Winner ( 've seen the future of flight sims, and it is a joystick Specifically, the new forcefeedback design from CH Products. While VR goggles make it look like you're really flying a plane (in a low-res universe, at least), the CH Force FIX joystick makes it feel like you're in control of a real aircraft. STICK IT The CH Force F/X will share the handle design of this F-16 Combat Stick, but will include a sturdier base. POSITIVE FEEDBACK The Force FX, which was slated at press time to ship in late September, will use the same handle as the CH F-16 Combat Stick. But that's where the similarity ends. The F/Xs heavy base docs away with the throttle wheel and simple gimbal mechanism found a conventional joystick, but it provides you with amazing environmental feedback, simulating bumps, jolts, vibration, and resistance. I recently had a chance to spend a week flying Philips Media's FICHTER DUEL using a prototype Force FXX, and I'm a definito convert. (It's really liar to avoid a cheap joke about flaccid joysticks here, but I'll resist.) Going back to a standard joystick now is like downgrading from a top-of-the-line programmable fighter stick to an old Atari digital joystick; the experience just can't compare. Force feedback has two effects. I'irst, the realistic resistance the stick provides when you attempt to pull out of a highspeed dive or make a rapid roll motion adds a level of challenge to combat -you can't just jerk the stick in a Corsair like you're piloting a fly-by-wire F-16. But even better, the joystick actually significantly increases your situational awareness by providing much of the same feedback you'd get when flying a real plane. Encountering heavy resistance when you pull back the stick is a clue to check your airspeed gauge, because you're probably overspeed. Similarly, a shaking stick is a much more intuitive and realistic warning of an impending stall in a WWII aircraft than a warning horn. Self-proclaimed expert pilots often complain that aircraft in sims don't depart from controlled flight as casily as the real thing. However, that's reasonable, since you get very few of the cues from a screen and speakers that you get in a real cockpit. Until now, that is. Well-programmed force feedback will open doors to new levels of flight model realism. A forcefeedback joystick does more for the feeling of 'being there than any VR helmet. in the F-16 Combat Stick and replaces them with a complex mechanism of gears and motors. The resulting stick works like Denny's 15 Best Flight Sims of All Time , PC elow you'll find my picks for the 15 best flight simulations of all time.

The bad news is that RED BARON II has been delayed until at least February of next year. The good news is that the delay will allow developers to further finetune the game and make it right before shipping. Look for support for the major 3D graphics cards to be included, and multiplayer is a possibility as well. (Multihis month we start with a sim that's dropped off the radar. A few months back, Sierra promised a free update to the lackluster SILENT THUNDER: A-10 TANK KILLER 2. The update was set to add a realistic flight model as an option to supplement the poor, arcade-like handling of the sim's A-10, and include a series of new missions as well. The plan was to incorporate the Red BARON II flight model, which is forcemodel driven and can be used for virtually any plane which you have accurate dimensions and data for. Turns out that the estimates of the difficulty of grafting in the RB II flight model were more optimistic than realistic. Also the missions, which were almost complete, turned out to be too large to distribute online. At this point, the project seems to have been shelved, and players looking to fly a plane that handles like a real A-10 should instead check out A10 CUBA! on the Macintosh, or even the A-10 included in Jane's ATF  The other news from Sierra's Dynamix more corporate shortsightedness and rushing RED BARON Il out at the end of a fiscal quarter just to try to satsify stockholders' expectations. Another delay is in store for MicroProse's EUROPEAN AIR WAR, in part due to the departures of some members of the development team, but also because the decision was made to enhance the sim over the original design and move it from DOS to Windows 95. Look for it in the first half of 1997. Finally, since this month's \"Radar\" seems to be about making you wait, I'll close with the scoop on the next project for the West Coast division of EA's Jane's group. After the completion of the latest sequel to 688 ATTACK SUB, due this spring, Paul Grace and his team plan a Jane's flight simulation set in World War II. It's the end of the line for the creaky US NAVY FIGHTERS engine, though, so don't look for this product until at least Christmas of 1997, because the team is building an entirely new simulation engine from the ground up for this project.

Otherwise, release while in a 40to 45-degree pitch-up. with enough momentum to take you above the safe altitude threshold in t 730 pounds, the B-61 tactical thermonuclear bomb packs a huge wallop in a tidy package. It has no friends--if delivered incorrectly, it will kill you as readily as it does the enemy. By knowing the proper delivery profiles, you can learn to stop worrying and love The Bomb. There are two basic release methods that guarantee you won't get caught in the nuke's enormous blast: high-altitude level bombing and toss bombing. Reasonable accuracy requires CCIP Mode 2 be used on a target designated by ground radar, near the primary objective. The goal of each method is to end up at least 30,000 feet above ground level by the time the bomb detonates. If you start out above that altitude, a simrange, just more time to escape. The HUD symbology looks the same regardless of whether you use level or toss bombing. The target won't be in the HUD's field of view, so you must maneuver until the vertical steering line bisects the target designator box with your wings level. Watch the time-to-go indicator to know when to drop. Squeeze the trigger when this number disappears, one second after it reads \"00:00.\" Coming in at such a high altitude makes you a target for enemy interceptors and air defenses, so you generally want to get in and out as fast as possible. In your haste, don't forget that the bomb will not drop if you're above Mach 1.2. When tuming away, try not to dive below 30,000 feet. If you do, damage from the shock wave is certain. FLASH DANCE When a tactical nuke goes off, you'll need to be at least 30,000 feet above ground level to avoid being caught in its blast. time.

Should you decide to stay and fight, jettisoning unnecessary external stores will boost your turning ability significantly. AMRAAMs are heavy enough to be a liability in a dogfight.

AIR-TO-MUD For ground attack missions, B2B provides a good variety of ordnance types to choose from. Selecting an appropriate mix for the target at hand can greatly increase your chances of success. Together, the electro-optically (EO) guided weapons, which include the CBU-10 glide bomb and the AGM-65 Maverick, are good choices for attacking a wide range of targets. They are deally accurate and can be deployed from any altitude. And owing to a deficiency in the CBU-10 modeling, there's no blast radius to worry about. One or two CBU-IOS can demolish almost anything. With its smaller warhead, the Maverick is best suited for destroying ground vehicles or parked aircraft, though two hits will usually take out a ship. Because cach weapon type's seeker can be slaved to a target designated by the ground radar, it's actually possible to guide multiple weapons toward different targets simultaneously, greatly increasing the amount of damage you can do in a single pass. It's not realistic to do this for the CBU-10, but neither is being able to use it at all, since your simulated F-16 does not CG NOVEMBER 1996 "

"TERRY COLEMAN BRIEFINGS STRATEGY / WARGAMES > STAR GENERAL looks like it will be one of this season's hottest games, but SSI shows no intention of stopping there: they plan to bring the popular series back to WWII next year with PACIFIC GENERAL and a PANZER GENERAL sequel. Both will feature refinements to the classic system, with the possibility that the Pacific theater conflict will allow you to play both Douglas MacArthur and Tomoyuki Yamashita. I can see the add-on packs now: Kamikaze General and Generals of the Long March. Talonsoft's first real-time game, AGE OF SAIL, has developed so rapidly that it should make Christmas. This has caused other games in the pipeline to shift: BATTLEGROUND: ANTIETAM should still be out in 1996; the shifting sands, however, will move the next 20th-century installment of the series, BATTLEGROUND: Sinai, to sometime in the spring of next year. Kursk for the 37th time, but wily human opponents will exploit your lack of battle field intelligence. Save yourself some hassles; at least buy a couple as auxiliaries. even the toughest armor. Rain and snow turns are often just as welcome to the German as the Allied player. They form a good opportunity to pump air squadrons up to overstrength status, to upgrade air units (particularly Me109s to FW190s), and simply to rcfuc aircraft without having to worry about reprisals from the other sides air units. Best of all, you can't be shot down by antiaircraft fire, so send a couple of fighters deep into enemy territory-again, Focke-Wulfs work best, due to their long range-to find the holes in your opponent's defenses. nearly impossible to hold the city for long. A better option is to combine Johnston's and Pemberton's troops, feint against Nashville, and invade Kentucky. Even if you end up retreating south, you should tic up a lot of Union forces. Alternatively, Longstreets idea of sending a corps from the Army of Norther Virginia to assist Bragg in 'Tennessee is a DANCIN' IN THE RAIN Bad weather is your friend. Your scout aircraft can get up close and personal with even enemy AA guns. BAD DAY FOR SADDLESORES Zulus should always target British cavalry, to reduce their recon capabilities and reduce enemy morale. Another myth that needs busting is \"Over-reliance on air power will get you into trouble when the rains fall.\" Perhaps, but many Russian tanks that laugh at German artillery can easily be dispatched by experienced Ju87 dive bombers. And fighters are more than mere escorts-a Focke-Wulf 190 built up to AMERICAN CIVIL WAR The Confederate side in the 1863 scenario is probably the hardest to win. A lot of players try to keep Grant out of Vicksburg, but this ties down a lot of troops, and \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant is tough to beat on the battlefield. If you abandon Vicksburg, striking toward Memphis is tempting. Problem is, the Union navy and Yankee reinforcements from Cairo make it -good gamble. Keep in mind, however, that this leaves Lee at the mercy of an Army of the Potomac not yet depleted by Gettysburg. What you do depends on how many more miracles you believe \"Marse Robert\" has left in him.

"HEAD-TO-HEAD REVIEW. ROBERT E. LEE VS. AGE OF RIFLES DIFFICULTY LEVEL Rebel Generals STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Both AGE OF Rifles And ROBERT E. LEE Strive To Be The 19th Century's PANZER GENERAL by Terry Coleman 'll never forget a Civil War reenactment I witnessed as a child. The tight formations of the soldiers as they marched were in sharp contrast to their coarsely woven, sometimes patched, unifoms of Confederate buttemul and Union blue. Combatants on both sides sported wire-rim glasses, many chewed tobacco, and some took the realism too far by having holes in their shoes. There were bitter defenses, brave charges and countercharges, and the glint of bayonets in the summer sun. But the most distinct memory I have of that day is the smell of gunpowder, accentuated by the thunderous roar of cannon. SET III: ACE OF RIFLES try to capture. The It is this sense of martial beauty -the graphic representations of units from both sounds, smells and pageantry-mixed games recall stylized miniature soldiers, with the all-too-real terrors of the battle and the bases on the RIFLES figures, in parfield that both ROBERT E.

LEE even goes so far as to call itself \"So realistic you can smell the gunpowder.\" While my childhood memories might wish for just that, I do wish Sierra's marketing would tone it down. Such quibbles aside, both these games have a lot of historical flavor to go with the pretty pictures, for ROBERT E. LEE It's tempting to overuse your which any aficionado of leaders in the front lines. While you might survive 19th-century conflict can without Longstreet, Early or Hood, each of these popcount himself fortunate ular leaders has a tremendous positive effect on morale-the most crucial factor in combat-so you'll AGE OF TRANSITION thrive by keeping \"Old Pete\" and the rest of your senior The true link between officers healthy and happy.

Civil War began with al se smoothbore muskets and finished with the telegraph, submarines, trench lines and machine guns. LEE chooses to focus specifically on this conflict, while highlighting the fighting genius of its most famous gencral. And though RIFLES has a broader scope-covering every major battle from the Mexican-American War to the Russo-Japanese conflict at the turn of this century-it simply takes a longer view of the transitions in technology and battlefield doctrine during this period when the common soldier was still king. Partially because you don't have to manage air, land and sca forces (or Orcs, Dragons and magic spells), both games are fairly simple to learn. LEE has a nice video tutorial included right on the CD, and RIFLES has a generic \"Civil War\" tutorial scenario to get you marching and firing volleys in a hurry. Each game allows you to turn off the hexgrid outlines, and their attempts to distance themselves from traditional wargames don't stop there. LEE takes the position that while smallarms weapons might fire up to 400 yards, they were only effective up to 200 yards. ROBERT E.

"HEAD-TO-HEAD REVIEW  ROBERT E. LEE VS. AGE OF RIFLES hoosing weapons in ROBERT E. Lee is a lot like upgrading in PANZER GENERAL: You never have enough money to buy every weapon you need. STRATEGYZ WARGAMES AMIC W Genna DUR So the designer set the map scale at 200 yards per hex, which allows each unit equipped with small-arms to fire at a range of one hex and only one hex. Since cannon may fire farther, of course, this does create an obvious qualitative difference between the two major arins. To compensate, units with Springfield repeating rifles, for example, are given proportionally higher firing strengths than 1848 flintlock muskets, for an equivalent number of men. This design decision makes LEE's combat system a lot easier to assimilate than that of, say, BATTLEGROUND: SHILOH, but cutting down on the micro-managing also removes a lot of the tactical flavor. RIFLES, on the other hand, varies its scales from 100 to 400 yards per her, depending on the battle being depicted. And unlike LEE, RIFLES lets you shoot to the extreme length of your EL Start by purchasing cheap rifles such as the 1842 Palmetto musket.

A MATTER OF FACING ZOCs-Zones Of Control those hallowed old warhorses of turn-based games gone by, are nowhere mentioned in the manuals or READ.ME files of either LEE or RIFLES. In LEE, ZOCs are just like the hexgrid outlines, because even if (like the design team) you try to conveniently ignore the existence of ZOCs, they still restrict movement. ZOCs don't affect combat in LEE, but that's nary a problem, given the one hex limitations of small-arms combat. In Rifles, ZOCs don't exist, per se. Instead, moving next to an enemy draws reaction fire, which may stop the moving unit dead The six-pounder cannon is best: nice firepower (10). cheaper reloads, range of 6 is plenty in heavily wooded Virginia terrain.

"ROBERT E. LEE VS. AGE OF RIFLES REVIEW Reactive Crowds \"And it's headed right towards the crowd...\" STRATEGYZ WARGAMES algorithm that penalizes a unit cach time it is attacked by an enemy of equal or greater force. Tedious, perhaps, but it works pretty well in practice. Both games handle charges realistically: In Rifles, the charging units must undergo a morale check; Lee makes you spend Army morale to entice your tired soldiers to go \"once more into the breach,\" a nice touch. The din of battle fairly bursts from your speakers, with the digitized screams of RIFLES getting the edge, although the southern-crawl voiccovers of LEE offer a pleasant bridge between scenarios. Similarly, the animated sequences of RIFLES for each individual firefight can't touch the professional movie clips of LEES battles (filmed at a Civil War recnactment). Then again, many gamers will eventually tire of these and turn them off, just as they did the then-revolutionary animation of PANZER GENERAL. of the American Civil War Even so, LEE does cut a few corners. It includes First Bull Run for historical perspective, although Bobby Lee wasn't there. That's a nice gesture, but moving immediately after that to Second Bull Run in the campaign is misleading You sce, Joc E. Johnston, a line tactician, wasn't particularly loved by his men, so Jefferson Davis removed him from command. Replacing Johnston was Davis's military advisor Robert L. Lee-whose only other campaign had been a disastrous loss of West Virginia (it was to become a Union state in 1863). Neither this campaign nor \"Marse Robert's coming-out party versus McClellan outside of Richmond are included. Where are the struggles of the Seven Days' battles, where I ce's Army of Northern Virginia was forged, forcing the superior Union forces down the peninsula?

"ROBERT E. LEE VS. AGE OF RIFLES REVIEW Hitting stores this fall the ebb and flow of Civil War combat Second Bull Run requires that you delay with Stonewall Jackson while Longstrect outmaneuvers the Union army. Chancel lorsville is a march and counter-march desperation whirlwind worthy of lied crick the Great. The Washington scenario actually makes more sense here than the similar battle in PANZER GENERAL, because it offers a historically logical follow-up to a resounding Confederate vic tory at Gettysburg. Throughout all the . battles, the Al performs pretly well, but as you'd expect, it fares better in the role of Grant than Pope. STRATEGY Z WARGAMES THE LONG MARCH In any collection of 40-plus scenarios, a few will inevitably fall flat. The stacking limits of two units per hex put a crimp in more than one scenario. But considering that some of the conflicts covered in RIFLES are hardly the most exciting material from which to craft wargames--take the Russo-Japanese War, please -the overall quality is remarkably high. The weapons of the Mexican-American War, for instance, pale in killing power to those of later conflicts, requiring that you master different tactics in cach campaign. Moreover, the campaigns of RIFLES are every bit as difficult and addictive as those of PANZER GENERALhigh praise, indeed. The Soldier Queen is my favorite, a multifaceted romp through an crawlien the Union Jack flew in every corner of the world. You pit your Maxim machine guns against spear-carrying Zulu warriors, put down uprisings in India, and even duke it out with old European adversaries in the Crimea. If the campaigns aren't enough to keep you enticed for hundreds of hours, simply link existing scenarios into a new campaign. The scenario editor of RIFLES is much better than that of TANKS! -it even lets you create troops of fictitious nationality, complete with uniforms that you design--and is the single biggest edge that RIFLES enjoys over LEE. So which is better? Currently, ROBERT E.LEE has the most entertaining Civil War campaign, but it isn't up to the superb BATTLEGROUND: SHILOH as a recreation of Civil War combat (keep in mind that Talonsoft needed some time to hone its craft as well). It also has some curious omissions in terms of battles and isn't as fully realized as RIFLES. AGE OF Rifles, for its part, is incredibly ambitious, and sometimes slips. Already, complaints are hitting SSI about the annoying play-by-c-mail bugs. While the documentation is adequate, some may wish for more strategy tips. Others may miss their familiar ZOCs. Still, few games of any genre realize so many of the lofty goals for which RIFLES strives. A game that refuses to sacrifice either history or fun, it stands as Norm Koger's masterpiece-a game that will be played by many gamers for a long, long time to come-and deservedly so. In the end, if you must buy only one of these, get Rifles, but real Civil War fans should pick up LEE as well, so that the historical flavors can mingle on their hard drive. | ...look out for the most exciting tournament golf game you've ever played.

The first time you see a battlefield, don't worry too much about winning it; instead, give some initial troop movement orders to nearby territories. Study what is out there, what you need, and the best path to get to it. Sometimes, a unit won't choose the best route automatically, so for key initial territories that you must race to capture, plot short, optimized routes for your units to follow. Use cheaper units like Grunts or Psychos to grab vehicles and ing strategy planned out, restart the level and execute those moves as fast as you can. The fine art of production can take a little getting used to. Only produce Grunts early in the campaign, for seizing unowned vehicles; after the initial land grab by both sides, switch to more versatile units. However, don't set all factories to produce heavy units, as a lot can go wrong while you wait for the best to roll out of manufacturing.

Those who have purchased Novastar scenario disks for STEEL. PANTHERS should be aware that only three of the 35 scenarios on the CD are actually new. Most portray European battles, but there are a fair number of Pacific scenarios as well. The more memorable scenarios are the two depicting Oberststurmfuhrer Michael Willmann's heroics against British armor at If you have installed previous patches for STEEL PANTHERS, you might want to delete your current version, reinstall version 1.0 and then install the CAMPAIGN DISK.

In 1984, Jon Van Caneghem, now President of New World Computing was an avid boardgamer and role-playing adventurer who decided to try his hand at writing a computer roleplaying game. He started coding the game on his Apple lle and the result was MIGHT AND MAGIC: THE SECRET OF THE INNER SANCTUM. The game was finished in 1986. Then, Jon and two friends pooled their money, bought a heavy-duty shrink-wrap machine, and worked through an entire sleepless weekend, shrink-wrapping the game for shipment the following Monday. In all, 5,000 boxes were wrapped that weekend. The MIGHT AND MAGIC series helped to revolutionize the industry and now has five installments. MIGHT AND MAGIC: THE SECRET OF THE INNER SANCTUM was one of the first games to utilize a first-person perspective in its interface, and to adhere to common pen-and-paper roleplaying rules: turn-based combat, experiential skill and level advancement, equipment that enhanced skills, etc. Since then, the series has grown to include: MIGHT AND MAGIC II: GATES TO ANOTHER WORLD, MIGHT AND MAGIC III: ISLES OF TERRA, MIGHT AND MAGIC IV: CLOUDS OF XEEN, and MIGHT AND MAGIC V: DARKSIDE OF XEEN. The final two chapters, installed on the same hard drive, allowed the player to experience a whole new scenario, called WORLD OF XEEN. A second scenario, SWORDS OF XEEN was included in the MIGHT AND MAGIC TRILOGY pack. ATLAST. A GAME THAT TAKES YOU SERIOUSLY. Mapo M .

HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC, a very slick remake of Jon's earlier THE KING'S BOUNTY, was the result, and its accolades have been sung far and wide. Computer Gaming World named it Strategy Game of the Year for 1995, and it won both PC Gamer's Editor's Choice award and Computer Game Review's Golden Triad award. HEROES OF MIGHT AND Magic blends many of the fantasy elements of role-playing with a solid turn-based strategy wargame engine. Plus, it offers a rich and rewarding campaign game. So, is it any surprise that the folks at New World Computing are working on a sequel? Of course not. HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC II will expand on all of the things that made the original great, while adding new elements, such as secondary skills and Internet playability. Two new character classes have been added; all of the artwork has been updated; new monsters, spells, and artifacts have been created; and the combat screen has been enlarged to further the elements of tactical strategy.

"FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY ADVERTISING SECTION Accolade \"\"HARDBALL is the epitome of the Accolade line\" ob Reiner opened his film, The Princess Bride, with an iconic computer game. It was HARDBALL. HARDBALL is the epitome of the Accolade product line because it reflects the desires of its co-founders, Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead, to move beyond the cartridge games they'd been writing at Activision. They formed Accolade to specialize in computer games. They intended to keep writing action games, but to add new elements and flair to them that couldn't be done in the cartridge world. HARDBALL did just that. In an era when baseball games had either blocky players in a generic stadium or text-heavy statistics, Whitehead captured the best of both worlds. The pitching interface was intuitive, the graphics were ahead of their time, the action was fast-paced, players had varying skills, and management decisions made a difference. It was the perfect package, a fact reflected in its sales success through a number of sequels, and they're not finished yet. And, since each new HARDBALL is the toughest competitor for the last, the tradition continues with the upcoming HARDBALL 6. Looking back, Accolade wanted to beat Activision from the start, even with the name. \"I remember looking in the dictionary to find a good word beginning with A that would come before Activision in the phone book,\" remembers Miller. \"Accolade seemed like a winner.\" Critical accolades were normal in Accolade's early years, whether for HARDBALL, LAW OF THE WEST, or ACE OF Aces, a WWII air combat game. Today, the accolades continue for their strategy games, as well as sports and action. HERE OPEN #1 selling Baseball Series for PC HARDBALL4 WARS HardBall! SA CHARDBALU HARDBALLO "

An attractive golf game with an early implementation of the strength meter interface, MEAN 18 was a major success from the beginning, even generating solid sales of course disks. Yet, in those days as in these, every computer game publisher seemed to have a golf game. With improvement in the competition, Accolade felt like they needed to raise the ante. Since they had already proven that they could publish a golf game with terrific graphics for the day and an easyto-use interface, they decided that they needed golf expertise to improve the package. They decided to go for one of the best-known golfers of all time, Jack Nicklaus. In so doing, they picked up two areas of expertise for the price of onea professional player and a professional golf course designer. Not only would players of JACK NICKLAUS' GREATEST 18 HOLES OF MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF get to play against a computerized Jack Nicklaus, who used club selection and averaged distances typical to the Golden Bear, on the hardest 18 holes in the world, but the package would also include two Nicklaus designed courses. The concept worked so well it led to more course disks and a series of products which included course architects, the editing tool that allows gamers to build their own digital golf courses.

"FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY ADVERTISING SECTION Accolade STAR CONTROL ccolade's tradition of wrapping action games with new elements and flair was to find expression in another ongoing series. The original STAR CONTROL was an action/strategy hybrid. In many ways, STAR CONTROL was the original \"conquer the galaxy\" game. You made strategic decisions about how many ships to send to what star system. Like GALAXY and REACH FOR THE STARS before it, STAR CONTROL was primarily a strategic space conquest game. But it was more. Where earlier strategic space conquest games merely resolved the tactical battles according to various algorithms, STAR CONTROL let you control your ships in a wild, action melee mode of ship-to-ship action. Even better, no melee was quite the same because the ships of different alien races had different attributes and special attacks. Tactics which worked against one race might be totally ineffective against another. Plus, many of the aliens were just plain funny. How do you top that? STAR CONTROL II opted for an adventure game wrapping. The aliens were even funnier and the story gave you a reason to fight. Accolade had managed to create an entirely new look and feel for the game without losing the essential element of fun from the original. Here, at last, is STAR CONTROL 3. Once again, Accolade has been smart enough not to mess with the very successful action elements of the game. Yet, it has a brand new look. Now, 3D spaceships and wild, wacky puppets pull you into a game that has never lost sight of its hour-devouring roots. Fate of a thousand worlds is our hands... AGAIN.

"FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY ADVERTISING SECTION Accolade efore Test Drive, Accolade had ignored a major market segment-simulation. Though some may argue that the original TEST DRIVE was more of an action game than true simulation. Even with its limitation to the highway, optional automatic transmissions, memorizable traffic patterns, and stilted cracked windshields when you were supposed to have fallen off a cliff, it was one of the first computer games to put you behind the wheel of a high-performance Porsche, Corvette, or Ferrari. TEST DRIVE was a showcase game----the kind you'd show your friends, even if they weren't gamers. Best of all, TEST DRIVE showed that Accolade could do competitive 3D games and that every simulation didn't need to have guns to be exciting. To be sure, Test Drive opened the door for 3D military games like STEEL THUNDER (an early tank simulation) and GUNBOAT (one of two Vietnam games worth playing), but the company's real success in vehicle simulation came with the TEST DRIVE series. The cars got faster and the graphics got fancier in TEST DRIVE II and you were truly able to leave the road without crashing in TEST DRIVE III. Now, in TEST DRIVE: OFF ROAD, you'll be able to spend all of your time off the road in a Chevy, Jeep, Land Rover or Hummer and love it. Through the years, Accolade has published a variety of games, but the emphasis has always been on action combined with new elements and flair. That tradition still holds. In fact, with the addition of strategy, it's growing. \"TEST DRIVE was a showcase game.\" The Duel Accolade TEST DRIVE OFF-ROAD "

Its employees didn't just design games, they played them—their games and everyone else's. At first, most of their games were largely computerized versions of board-based wargames they liked to play. Then, they expanded to publish science fiction strategy games like GALACTIC GLADIATORS and COSMIC BALANCE, as well as roleplaying games like QUESTRON and PHANTASIE. Yet, until they announced an unprecedented licensing agreement with TSR, publishers of the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons system, SSI was still known primarily as a wargame company. In 1988, they published POOL OF RADIANCE, the first of the \"gold box\" designs which, for several years, became SSI's flagship line. POOL OF RADIANCE was true to the AD&D rules and heavy on combat-just right for the audience in the late '80s. The game engine was so strong that the publisher was able to crank out new games every few months. As the engine aged, SSI published the editor as UNLIMITED ADVENTURES, oversaw development of the multiplayer online version, NEVERWINTER NIGHTS for America Online, and developed new games like the first-person EYE OF THE BEHOLDER series. Today, the original TSR deal is over and SSI is publishing exclusive fantasy games, but they still have one title carrying on the tradition. This year, DARK SUN: CRIMSON SANDS had its debut on the Total Entertainment Network.

"FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY ADVERTISING SECTION Strategic Simulations, Inc. PANZER GENERAL Fast, Fun & Good-looking hough some wargamers were angry at SSI's management about the TSR license, a strange twist of fate occurred. For a time, wargames fell out of favor and even some great wargames did disappointing numbers. Fortunately for wargamers, SSI's management were committed enough to creating wargames that there were some years when the TSRlicensed games carried the ball for the wargames. So staunch was this commitment that SSI continued to publish wargames, even when the genre seemed in danger of dying away. Then, in 1994, SSI published a wargame that captured the imagination of hardcore wargamer and casual gamer alike-PANZER GENERAL. It featured beautiful graphics, a great interface, and well-balanced campaign games. It sold well and continues to sell well! PANZER GENERAL invigorated the wargaming hobby in general, inspired the company to put great graphics in even hardcore wargames like STEEL PANTHERS and AGE OF Rifles, and formed the centerpiece of an entire GENERAL series. ALLIED GENERAL provided the flipside to PANZER GENERAL'S German perspective. Indeed, it provided three flipsides, since you could now play a British, Russian or U.S. general. Yet, the GENERAL engine proved itself even more versatile with its application to fantasy realms, FANTASY GENERAL, and its upcoming release on science fiction warfare, STAR GENERAL. In many ways, PANZER GENERAL may have saved the wargaming hobby. In other ways, it brought SSI back to its roots-a computer game company that makes the fantasy, sci-fi, and wargames that its employees (and management) like to play. As a strategy game, PANZER GENERAL will stimulate your mind. But your eyes and ears won't believe how great it looks and sounds: stunning Super VGA graphics, authentic World War II combat photography and film footage plus CD-quality music and dynamite sound effects. You'll love the way it plays: PANZER GENERAL is one blazingly last and fun game! The year is 1939: you are a German General with a fresh command in Poland. Anything can happen, and every game you play will be dirferent. Win and advance to the next front of your choice. Lead well and your increasingly battle-hardened core group of units could be plowing across Europe, North Africa and the Eastern Front.

The company quickly perceived that gamers were tired of playing graphic adventures with parser interfaces where they had to type VERB, NOUN to make things happen. So, they created the now legendary SCUMM, Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion, system. It may sound disgusting (every acronym in the toolset spells out a body fluid), but its inception was a key event in adventure game history. SCUMM was the first system to use a \"point and click\" interface, Gamers no longer had to play \"Guess the Verb\" in order to do anything. The public loved MANIAC MANSION. It became an icon for a new style of animated adventures. The interface was intuitive enough that MANIAC MANSION was phenomenally successful on the 8-bit Nintendo system as well as the computer, and the game birthed such memorable characters that it became a live television show on the Family Channel. The SCUMM system proved its further versatility in 1989 and 1990 when it served as the foundation for two landmark products: INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE and Loom. The Indiana Jones adventure marked the first time LucasArts had ever used one of the film company's marquee licenses to build a game (prior to this, other companies had produced less than sterling Indy and Star Wars products). Loom was the first game to use a musical staff as its interface. These were just the beginning of a story game dynasty. FREE!

Both games poked fun at sexual stereotypes and classic swashbuckling adventures. The humor was fresh and such things as the misunderstood \"Insert Disk 256\" joke (the game asked you to do so, but there was no Disk 256—the guys were just making fun of the proliferation of 5.25\" floppy disks in that era's games) will live forever in computer game history.

Not only did the game require the player to \"earn\" their interface in one segment, but it was probably the first game to ever adapt itself to the gamer's playing style. As the player made decisions, the game would morph into either puzzle-, actionor cooperation-dominant mode to fit the player.

In 1993, LucasArts brought computer gamers the first LucasArts-designed Star Wars computer game, XWING. It was a tremendous success as the company, like George Lucas before them, turned their WWII combat sims into mesmerizing space opera. The methodical pace of training, the interweaving of campaign elements and fast-paced action itself led to a tremendous sense of being in the middle of a Star Wars movie. REBEL ASSAULT was even more phenomenal. The first product for a brand new game engine, \"INSANE\" (INteractive Streaming ANimation Engine), REBEL ASSAULT sold more than a million units worldwide. INSANE also supported the animated chase sequences in LucasArts' FULL THROTTLE, a biker adventure that was the first game to use both SCUMM and INSANE. Both X-WING and REBEL ASSAULT spawned successful sequels (TIE FIGHTER and REBEL ASSAULT II), but DARK FORCES, a first-person shooter with defined mission goals, brought the Stars Wars universe even more up close and personal.

With PRINCE OF PERSIA 2, Mechner refined the animation and graphics even further, adding a full array of traps and logic puzzles to further challenge gamers.

APACHE 252 he youngest company in our special section, Interactive Magic is still a company with historical significance. Chartered by Robert L. \"Bob\" Pickens in 1994, the company gained instant industry perspective when \"Wild Bill\" Stealey's noncompete agreement with Spectrum HoloByte expired. Stealey was the founder of MicroProse, the man who talked Sid Meier into writing computer games for profit as well as fun, the high flyer who took MicroProse public, and an inimitable, outspoken leader in the computer game industry for years. Pickens had years of executive experience, serving as CEO of Washington Aluminum Company prior to starting Interactive Magic. Pickens knew business, but Stealey knew gamesparticularly, strategy and simulation. Remembering bad ventures in coin-op and graphic adventures, Stealey chuckles and says, \"I now know the value of focusing on what you know best, especially when you have a partner who keeps you from doing anything stupid.\" The short history of Interactive Magic has been anything but stupid. Their first release played to their strength. A detailed helicopter simulation, APACHE sold more than 120,000 units. The focus proved successful with STAR RANGERS, CAPITALISM and AMERICAN CIVIL WAR: FROM SUMTER TO APPOMATTOX, as well. In addition, the company has a half-dozen releases scheduled for the next six months: HIND, HARPOON CLASSIC 97, DESTINY, iM1A2 ABRAMS, and AIR WARRIOR II. The latter is the centerpiece of Interactive Magic's alliance with Kesmai and a key to their future online plans. Fast out of the gate and expected to keep growing, Interactive Magic is already making computer game history. 252 wo 10 BKM 2.0 r-20 Waray L where were ot et te Mtate, it is the in It's 100% 48-sta, Ispartace actit att i Comitis ta hiding the Fria FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS, THE RIDE MAY GET A LITTLE BUMPY. est LINE Intratte Rarit.

A terrible secret And you need to shave. Ir TILE ruce and Roger Carver founded Access Software in 1982 in order to publish action-oriented computer games. Games like NEUTRAL ZONE, an action-space combat game, and BEACH HEAD, an arcade game where you defended a beach, were the company's forte until the mid-80s. Then, the company published a golf game called Leader Board that was to foreshadow the company's future success in computer golf games. This was also when Access began to experiment with new technologies. By 1988, a space combat game called ECHELON offered voice command on the C-64 and shipped with its own custom hardware. Later, 1989's WORLD CLASS LEADER BOARD used RealSound, Access' proprietary sound technology, to offer commentary on your shots (\"Looks like the ball's in the woods, Jim.\"). Then came Mean Streets, the first Tex Murphy game. Tex Murphy, a futuristic throwback to Raymond Chandler's hardboiled detectives, started a detective dynasty with MEAN STREETS, the first game to fulfill the promise of an interactive movie in this VGA game combined with RealSound. When Tex next appeared, in MARTIAN MEMORANDUM, he was partnered with full-motion video and fully-synchronized digital speech for the entire cast. Even so, Access wasn't satisfied. They wanted Tex to wander through 3D rooms and play scenes with even smoother video. They even added well-known professional actors to enhance the movie idea. As a result, UNDER A KILLING MOON was phenomenally successful, and nearly universally acclaimed. Now, Tex Murphy has returned in THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE—the best, but certainly not the last Tex Murphy adventure. ndora Directire.. prepels the interactive movie a 21st century art form.\"-CD RON Today UNDER ACCES Foots tie VOICE ACCESS "


"FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY ADVERTISING SECTION ACCESS \"Links went right to the top of the sales \"leader Board.\" stomous woman  worse ccess wasn't about to let go of their successful golf series, either. To move beyond WORLD CLASS LEADER BOARD, the company sent out teams to photograph and measure actual golf courses. The design team conscientiously rendered full 3D contoured terrain in full 256 color VGA graphics. They filmed and digitized golfers swinging various clubs and rotoscoped these golfers into the game. They recorded both the ambient sounds at various courses and the active sounds of club and ball. The results were phenomenal. LINKS went right to the top of the sales \"Leader Board\" and threatened never to come down. Even the course disks for LINKS were big hits. FIRESTONE, BOUNTIFUL, BAY HILL, PINEHURST, DORADO BEACH and BARTON CREEK were all popular for LINKS players. Real golfers loved the chance to play famous courses on the computer which were restricted to them in real life, and couldn't believe the realism. Then, in late 1992, LINKS 386 Pro did the impossible. The designers offered SVGA graphics, nine different viewing windows, extra bookkeeping of statistics, upgraded sounds, and faster redraw after each shot. It also offered the option of a female golfer for the first time in the series. Plus, it was backwardcompatible with all of the Links course disks. Amazingly, enough, Access still isn't finished. LINKS LS offers better graphics, 3D stereo sound, modem or network play, swing animation of Arnold Palmer, and VR tours of famous clubhouses via the UNDER A KILLING Moon technology. And somehow, we think there are more surprises along the way. LINKS. LS "


"FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY ADVERTISING SECTION Bethesda \"Call Out At Bethesda, folks from the CEO down, are Scrupulous about reality\" here is a familiar name in the credits for this summer's hottest film, Independance Day. Chris S Weaver is the CEO of Bethesda. Not only does Weaver have a Ph.D. in Physics, qualifying him to serve as advisor, but he is working with the special effects geniuses behind Independance Day on a game to be called TENTH PLANET-a game that reverses an industry trend for space combat sims in that the spaceships actually look better instead of having pixelating textures as you get closer to them. Why? Because that reflects \"reality\" and at Bethesda, folks from the CEO down, are scrupulous about reality. If ever a game publisher has been consistently underestimated, it has been Bethesda Softworks. From GRIDIRON, its physics-based football title on the Amiga, through its innovative overhead playing view in the original WAYNE GRETZKY HOCKEY to its X-CAR game of prototype high-performance cars, Bethesda has had a commitment to \"getting the model The Elder Scrolls right.\" Bethesda is committed to getting the model right in role-playing, too. THE ELDER SCROLLS: ARENA (with its bold advertisement pictured here) introduced a vast and potentially rich role-playing universe. Its designers weren't happy with it. They wanted deeper character interaction, more verisimilitude in terms of accountability and reputation, and more realism in terms of 3D terrain and its effect on characters. The sequel, THE ELDER SCROLLS: DAGGERFALL, delivers just that. And in terms of a realistic game world? They're still showing their commitment to realism as they've imported Dr. Ken Maynard to design realistic fractal landscapes for current and future projects. \"I've played role playing games since they first appeared on mainframes a decade ago. The Elder Scrolls: Arena is quite simply the most captivating! well-designed, realistic world avallable on home computers.\" Russ Ceccels, Associats Editor \"The most impressive showing by any company..

She loved it so much that she decided to create her own adventure game. Yet, instead of being satisfied with a pure text adventure, she wondered what would happen if you married graphics to the text. She took a classic mystery setup like that in Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and put the gamer in the middle of a murder mystery. MYSTERY House was the result. Not only was it successful, but it launched both a genre, the graphic adventure, and a company, Sierra On-Line. Not only did Sierra and Roberta start the graphic adventure genre, but they continually improved it. To do so, they needed a showcase line-a product so good that it would herald a new breakthrough with every release. The product was the KING'S QUEST line. Starting with the adventures of Sir Graham in KING'S QUEST: QUEST FOR THE CROWN AND MOVING THROUGH KING'S QUEST II: ROMANCING THE THRONE, KING'S QUEST III: TO HEIR IS HUMAN, KING'S QUEST IV: THE PERILS OF ROSELLA, KING'S QUEST V: ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GO YONDER!, and KING'S QUEST VI: HEIR TODAY, GONE TOMORROW through KING'S QUEST VII: THE PRINCELESS BRIDE, the series brought to life the first animated adventure, the first Midi soundtrack in an adventure game, the first fully parserless interface, first rotoscoped animation in a graphic adventure, and many more.

ANMATEID ADVENTURE GAME 2:IRDS arry Laffer, also known as Leisure Suit Larry, made his graphic adventure debut when Al Lowe, a mildmannered music teacher and brilliant jazz musicologist/musician, decided he needed to do something different (or, as Sierra once put it, they needed to \"keep him from the impressionable youth of America\"). LEISURE SUIT LARRY IN THE LAND OF THE LOUNGE LIZARDS was an instant success, in spite of the fact that many traditional retailers didn't carry it. Sierra positioned Larry very carefully as a game for adults and even put a funny quiz as lock-out protection against underage gamers. Yet, the truth is that LEISURE SUIT LARRY IN THE LAND OF THE LOUNGE LIZARDS was tame by most entertainment industry standards. It was designed for fun, not titillation. To be sure the humor was ribald, but there was a cost to irresponsible behavior and, later, even redressment of early charges of sexism (like a lounge lizard wouldn't be sexistright!) using a character named Passionate Patti. Lowe let you play part of the game from Patti's point of view in both LEISURE SUIT LARRY III: PASSIONATE PATTI IN PURSUIT OF THE PULSATING PECTORALS and LEISURE SUIT LARRY 5: PASSIONATE PATTI DOES A LITTLE UNDERCOVER WORK (the game which explains the missing Larry 4 game).

It is still selling in computerdom's most demanding genre—flight simulationeven though it is five years old. Its technology, 3SPACE, was one of the primary reasons that Sierra acquired Dynamix, Inc. in the first place. It was the first VGA flight simulation with both a decent frame rate and a realistic flight model. The game was RED BARON. Developed by Damon Slye, a quiet University of Oregon graduate who had honed his skills on 3D action games like ARCTICFOX, SKYFOX and STELLAR 7, it signaled the beginning of a dynasty in combat simulation for Dynamix and Sierra. ACES OF THE PACIFIC, ACES OVER EUROPE and ACES OF THE DEEP were all extensions of the lessons learned and technologies developed for RED BARON. The planes were fragile enough to obey physical laws; the rotary engines were handled perfectly; the sounds were realistic; the 28 aircraft to be flown were meticulously modeled, and there was plenty of excitement whether you chose individual missions or played the campaign tour of duty. Now, Sierra is preparing RED BARON II, a game that is expected to be more than a cosmetic makeover of the original masterpiece, more than a graphic upgrade. Using faster processors to provide more detailed graphics and higher frame rate, RED BARON II expects to dominate the category for yet another five years.

The frontier symbol which once graced the company's logo has been superceded by a topographical representation of imaginative frontiers. Once, the stagecoach was appropriate, since the history of Mindscape is one of pioneers taking different paths to reach the same unsettled territory. First, Walt Bilofsky built a chess game (MYCHESS) and adapted The Original Adventure text game for the Heathkit computer. He founded the Software Toolworks in 1980. Then, textbook publisher Scott, Foresman and Company founded the original Mindscape in 1983 to make inroads on the educational market. In contrast, Les Crane was a legitimate celebritycreating the \"Top 40\" format for radio, host of TV's The Les Crane Show (mentioned in Good Morning, Vietnam), and Grammy winner for the song/poem, Desiderata, in the '60s. He founded Software Country in 1984, marketing original titles and, in 1985, the first \"value pack,\" Software Golden Oldies, Vol. 1. Then, with the help of Bilofsky and current General Manager Mike Duffy, he published the first in the most successful chess series of all time, THE CHESSMASTER 2000. The collaboration was smooth enough on THE CHESSMASTER 2000 that Software Country and Software Toolworks merged in 1986. One year later, Mindscape underwent a change when John 2000 Purcell and Roger Buoy bought it to make it an entertainment software company. Mindscape's early hits included: BALANCE OF POWER, PAPERBOY, SUPERSTAR ICE HOCKEY, DEJA VU and some Lucasfilm movie licenses.

This gave Crane the confidence to go public. In 1988, Software Toolworks became the first entertainment software company to be publicly traded. Some of the new capital was used to acquire Intellicreations, publisher of ALTERNATE REALITY, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and BRUCE LEE. The original Mindscape, however, was not as healthy. Mindscape overextended itself during the peak of the Nintendo 8-bit phenomenon, focusing on such products as the very successful PAPERBOY. But the NES craze was slowing down. So, in 1990, Toolworks acquired Mindscape. The good relationship with Nintendo carried into the new company and products like MARIO Is MISSING began to appear. Now, the industry pioneers were together, but in 1994, Software Toolworks was itself acquired by the U.K. conglomerate, Pearson plc. Then, Toolworks acquired Atreid Concept S.A. (now, Mindscape Bordeaux) and industry pioneer, Strategic Simulations, Inc. The company was renamed Mindscape, and headed into new frontiers. In 1995, Mindscape was a leading publisher on the Windows'95 platform. AL UNSER, JR. ARCADE RACING, SU-27 FLANKER, and WARHAMMER: SHADOW OF THE HORNED RAT each showed off the new OS in different ways. This expertise should pay big dividends in this year's CHESSMASTER 5000, AZREAL'S TEAR, MEGARACE 2 and NECRODOME, as well as 1997's new Mindscape Sports Authority games (AARON VS.

Gilman Louie, had previously published a command simulation of a Star Trek-like spaceship, and joined with cofounder Phil Adam to create a company that would eventually publish the Falcon line; develop flight sim software for military contractor Perceptronics; import European flight sim hits such as FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER and TORNADO; publish a realistic WWII submarine sim, GATO; release a simple, accessible PT-boat sim; and build a realistic M-1 tank simulation based on subcontracting work with SimNet (the military's massive training simulation). By acquiring MicroProse Software in 1993, Spectrum further established its position as the simulation leader. MicroProse had its own combat flight superstar in the F-15 STRIKE EAGLE line and had experienced success with F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER (eventually F117A STEALTH FIGHTER) and GUNSHIP/GUNSHIP 2000. Plus, they were preparing to expand it with 1942: PACIFIC AIR WAR. The rich got richer In addition, MicroProse had an entire line of successful strategy games in SID MEIER'S RAILROAD TYCOON and SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION. Purchasing MicroProse gave Spectrum immediate credibility in the strategy arena, credibility they would enhance by purchasing SimTex Software (developers of MASTER OF ORION and MASTER OF MAGIC) in 1995 and signing an agreement with FASA Corporation to develop titles based on BattleTech, MechWarrior and Shadowrun properties. Today, new and upcoming releases such as SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION II, MASTER OF ORION II, AGENTS OF JUSTICE and 1997's real-time BATTLETECH strategy game are likely to make Spectrum HoloByte as synonymous with strategy as it is with simulation.

It was founded in 1983 to develop such story-based games as the text adventure, DEMON'S FORGE, and the ground-breaking role-playing series, THE BARD'S TALE. Interplay published story games because they were the types of games that the gamers who formed the company wanted to play. So, whether the games were based on original stories such as the award-winning WASTELAND and DRAGON WARS or licensed properties such as William Gibson's Neuromancer, J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, or the original Star Trek series, Interplay has usually managed to find a new technological or design wrinkle for each new game. Today, the company is a publisher of story-based games such as last year's Readers' Choice RPG, STONEKEEP, and the upcoming GURPS: FALLOUT (based on Steve Jackson's pen and paper game system), but it is much more. In 1988, Interplay saw an opportunity in the Chess market. They wanted to make the interactive equivalent of a Franklin Mint collectible chess set. They scored high with the best-selling strategy series, BATTLE CHESS. Then, as almost a bellwether of the computer game industry, Interplay began to lead out in new areas: European imports, OEM bundling deals for the entire industry, Macintosh marketing through the MacPlay line, the shortlived full-motion video revolution, and, most importantly, anticipated the unprecedented interest in multiplayer online gaming by introducing Descent and starting to build the backbone to the Engage! network over three years ago.

"MARTIN CIRULIS IME what hwor, It's Been The mars Best Of Times, And The Worst Lombardi liking the style and inviting me to review for the magazine. 14. Playing my first cooperative network game of Doom. 15. Watching my five-year-old daughter play Toy STORY CD on her very own computer, which is a thou. sand times more powerful than any. thing I ever dreamed of 15 years ago. ifteen years ago was going crazy in a one-horse town in British Columbia, and one of the few things that kept me going was computer and video games. These were the days when an Apple was like something out of Forbidden Planet, and a tabletop ASTEROIDS was the Altar of Infinite Quarter Sacrifice. Computer games were just hitting the market in plastic bags and stored on audio tape, ASCII characters doubled as computer graphics, and the first STAR FLEET game was worth hours of amusement. It would be another couple of years before I would see actual graphics on anything other than a cartridge game. Now it's 15 years later, and I type this on a Pentium 150 with more memory than the mainframe we went to see on junior high school field trips. Sometimes it seems like another world, but there's been a helluva lot that's gone on in between, so here's a list of my personal highs and lows. per game for the C-64, and realizing that arcade action could still be intri cate and interesting. 5. Blowing $200 for a 300 baud modem for the C-64, and thinking what an incredibly cool gadget it was. 6. Playing endless games of IMPERIUM GALACTIUM from SSI. A space war experience that really hasn't been equaled by an SF wargame since. 7. Selling the C64 and looking in awe upon the Atari ST I had gone halfers on, with every penny I had. 8. Programming my version of STAR FLEET BATTLEs, and realizing just how fast a 16-bit processor was. 9. Watching my girlfriend play LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS in female mode and laughing my guts out, little realizing it was one of the last times game developers would give women any credit. 10. Becoming addicted to ROGUE, mapping out DUNGEON MASTER with the help of another girlfriend, and endless hours with my friends playing EMPIRE, watching the automated efficiency of FredWorld, all on that old ST. 11. Discovering the incredible world of AIR WARRIOR ON GEnie. 12. Seeing WING COMMANDER TUN ning in a software store and knowing that I had to have it. (A year and a half later my wife and I spent every penny to purchase our first IBM, a 386-33— and WING COMMANDER was ours.) 13. My wife coercing me to write a nasty letter to CGW about MANTIS EXPERIMENTAL FIGHTER, and editor Chris ( After playing MULE with some friends, I realized that multiplayer was the best.) 6. Watching Atari screw over the ST. 7. Watching the ever-growing list of extremely cool games coming out for the IBM and accepting that they were never going to be translated to the ST. 8. MANTIS EXPERIMENTAL FIGHTER from MicroProse. 9. Realizing I was going to have to upgrade my 386-33 before I was even finished paying it off, and that I would get $25 for the old processor and motherboard, if I were lucky. 10. Watching Sid Meier become a design god as he produced one needlessly single player strategy game after another, forgetting what made the early strat games great and setting a trend that has only recently begun to change 11. Almost anything from Merit Software 12. OUTPOST from Sierra, after they had ruined the game's potential by overriding the designer's cool design, which I had previewed the year before. 13.
