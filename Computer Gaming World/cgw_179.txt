"The Real Half-Life In Memoriam-Allen \"Doc\" Greenberg EDITORIAL unclear whether we had a genius with a strange sense of humor or a demented schizophrenic on our staff. His contributions started to get smaller and less regular, but he kept playing and he kept writing right up until the end. This is a story about heroism. Please indulge me. I first came in contact with Allen Greenberg (or regularly. Allen's favorite author happened to be the great author of speculative fiction, Harlan Ellison, and he not only knew that Harlan and I had once colored the atmospheres of our respective offices in blue storm clouds of unrestrained verbiage, but he was also aware that Harlan had taken some potshots at me on the Science Fiction Channel. (Yes, I'm the editor of the so-called Video Wahoo Magazine about which Harlan railed in a couple of interviews.) When I asked the question, Doc trembled all over and exhaled quickly. \"God help me, it's Harlan Ellison.\" I laughed the hardest I ever have in a job inter view. I happen to admire Harlan, as well. I told Doc that this was grounds for hiring. came painfully slower and slower to him as he waited for more than two years for the much-needed organ match. In the course of getting to the office, he would often fall on the streets of San Francisco, pick himself up, and keep on going (if no one called for an ambulance-an occurrence that happened more than once). He never gave up. Finally, the transplant took place. Finally, it looked like Allen's nightmare was over. He returned to us with clear mind and new focus on work. He He died as the kind of mensch he admired in those short stories by Harlan Ellison. just threw away my editorial, my pompous words about the future of online gaming and how we stand on the brink of the next wave of multiplayer gaming. It's a good editorial and it needs to be published, but it just doesn't hold up against the story! must write. This is the story of a real deathmatch, the story of a man who died too soon. He was a friend, a colleague, a fellow editor, a father, and a gamer. In chronological years, this CGW editor lived only about half of a life's expected duration. In important matters, his mark is longer. He should have died under mysterious circumstances, like a hero in one of those adventure games he loved to play. He should have left behind a trail of puzzles, like the ones in the classics he continually challenged. He should have died with a wicked smile on his face as he shocked us with his Gilbert Gottfried impression of a cantankerous East Coast nerd. He should have left us peacefully with a gentle smile on his face as he nodded approvingly at the son and daughter of whom he was so proud. Instead, he died after living large. He died as the kind of mensch he admired in those short stories and novelettes by his favorite author, Harlan Ellison. He was a victim of his own rare blood-type and his inability to recuperate fully after a series of organ transplants. He fought on to the end, hoping to make some sense of the suffering through which he was struggling. And all the way through the period of savage nights and days of physical weakness, he played games. Even while the medication and physical weakness played games with his head, he kept on writing. He no longer tortured his editor-in-chief with lead paragraphs so bizarre and strange that it was \"Doc,\" as he was known to us) after he started writing for The Electronic Gamer, one of the original e-zines on CompuServe. I contacted him about writing for Computer Gaming World, and he jumped at the chance to review computer games for us. He soon proved his mettle at writing about adventure games and puzzle games. Doc was enthusiastic and always gave us a laugh or two as we edited his material. He wrote for both the print magazine and the first CGW online publication, our long-time publication on the Prodigy service. So, when there came a time that we needed an editor for our Prodigy publication, we decided to hire him. Even then, though, Doc was worried. You see, the guys told him that I always ask prospective employees about the books they have read, their favorite authors. and the magazines that they read Yet, there was a problem. Doc had been diagnosed with diabetes and had left his lucrative dental practice to work in a clinic. His skills had declined because his vision was getting worse and his partners no longer wanted him. He was able to help quite a few people in the clinic, but he knew that he wouldn't last for long.Com puter Gaming World became his new reason for living. He moved to California and had a great couple of years before the disease began to have an impact on his work. Even though he was weak, he continued to edit our Prodigy publication until its demise. Doc was our first telecommuting editor during that period, and his work kept him going for a long time. Yet, his life was now a series of dialysis treatments and his trips into the office became more and more difficult. The adventure game puzzles that he once solved with ease was still weak, but his writing kept getting better and he was making the comeback for which we'd been praying. Then, his body rebelled. He experienced a severe relapse. He left us suddenly. No more cynical shouts startling us in the office. No more incredible joy as he solved the latest puzzle. No more dry wit. Doc completed his adventure. He solved the last puzzle. His cubicle in the office doesn't look like the violence-torn setting for some angry Harlan Ellison story. It doesn't look like the old sanitarium in THE BLACKSTONE CHRONICLES. But it looks pretty creepy without my friend and colleague. I wanted to see him win the transplant game. I wanted to see him get the best ending possible. I hope, for his sake, he did. Allen \"Doc\" Greenberg died in March of 1999. Shalom, Allen, Shalom.

"Buy Get a Life Spending Big Bucks—Real Ones—for Hot ULTIMA ONLINE Real Estate Gerente ATKIN Shadow (in real life Richard, a 39year-old controls design engineer) explains: \"What it does for you is allow you access to items that might take you a very long time to acquire on your own much sooner than it normally would. Real estate in UO is pretty much set now. There are very few places that you can actually place a small house, let will be traveling a lot soon, and we thought it would be neat if he could play with me while he was away. I decided to first bid on one as a birthday present for him,\" says Jocelyn, 20, a college student in Dallas. In addition, buying an already powerful character for him means she'll be able to more safely build her own character's abilities. ONLINE between August and March. \"Many days I would put in 15-plus hours just killing stuff, making stuff, etcetera. I found myself many times up to 6 a.m. or all night and not even knowing it.\" Brian saw the eBay trend starti ng and decided it would be a perfect opportunity for a self-intervention. \"Since my time playing UO I have seen my grades go from As to Cs, to the point where I did not want to do anything but play UO. I found myself laying in bed at night thinking about what I could be doing on UO right now. This continued during school, work, driving, everything. Even dates would cut short to get home to play UO. I got a cable modem just for UO. I saw this getting out of Selling Out So why sell an account? Reasons vary. Not enough time to play, frustration with game lag, and moving on to other games are some of the typical rationales. Harlan, a 22-year old college student, sold his and his fiancée's accounts so they could move on to EVERQUEST. \"My fiancée and I are selling our n odd phenomenon struck online auction house eBay (www. ebay.com) this past March: People began selling virtual castles and imaginary charac ters. eBay has always had an amazing selection of items from cheesy collectibles to used Ferraris. It can be an addictive online experience (this editor has spent an embarrassing amount of time and money on eBay filling out the Green Lantern comics collection he could never afford as a kid), so it's only appropriate that it would become a venue for trafficking in ULTIMA ONLINE accounts. It all started when eBay user Turbohawk (in real life, Steve, a 30year-old firefighter) decided to sell his copy of ULTIMA ONLINE, complete with five characters and over half a million gold pieces. The account ended up selling for a whopping $521. Word got around, and within a week there were over 80 accounts for sale, many with bids over $500. At press time, one account had sold for $2,050, while another had reached $3,000 after 57 bids--and with six days to go until auction close! The questions are obvious: Why would someone sell an account they'd spent thousands of hours developing? More important, what is it about this gaming experience that could cause dozens of players to drop hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a powerful account? To find out, I interviewed a number of UO veterans who were selling their accounts as well as wannabe castle lords who had bid $250 or more for these accounts. It's only appropriate that eBay would become a venue for trafficking in ULTIMA ONLINE accounts. alone something huge. Therefore the only way to obtain such a place is to buy it in a game, through various Web sites or through eBay.\" Others are looking for characters They find it tedious to perform the activities necessary to build strong enough characters and they see buying an account as a way around this. When asked whether taking over another person's character spoils the role-playing aspect of UO, Scott, 28, a systems administrator, explains, \"I have my own character that I developed and spend most of my time playing. I was looking for support characters for that character. UO doesn't allow for good role playing because you have to spend way too much time doing mundane things to gain the wealth required for you to do any kind of adventuring.\" Believe it or not, even romance can be a factor. \"Well, my fiancé accounts as a group deal,\" Harlan says, adding, \"We have kept our long-distance relationship alive via role playing on UO.\" While many account buyers have been primarily interested in property, Harlan and his fiancée hope to see their characters live on. \"So far the emphasis has been on how much gold and what equipment are available,\" Harlan reports. \"Our sale is more about the mood we have created with our house and characters. Yes, our characters are good, but more than that, they have a history and a legacy. They are known in their shard as lovers and travelers. We are selling the characters' reputations as well as their statistics.\" Sometimes, selling the account is a way to gain both money and time to spend in real life. Brian, 21, a student and part-time Best Buy computer technician, had put about 2,000 hours into ULTIMA hand, so I had to cut my addiction off. I have since then started playing more quick games like STARSEIGE: TRIBES and others.\" UO publisher Origin is cool about this whole trend; in fact, the company is planning to modify its user agreement to make such sales \"legal\" in the game license. \"We know items are sold and traded, but we did not think characters would hold such a high monetary value,\" says Origin's David Swofford. \"The in-game economy in ULTIMA ONLINE has always been healthy and dynamic. It's only natural that eventually it would be mirrored in the real world like this.\" With thousands of dollars changing hands weekly on eBay for virtual castles and characters, it's not hard to picture a near future in which companies join in and sell the games cheap but offer weapons, potions, and keeps as extra-cost options. CGW Unreal Estate For many, the appeal of buying UO accounts is one of solving a problem that Californians will empathize with: lack of real estate. 26 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999 www.computergaming.com "

I just opened up my May issue to find people bitching to all hell about it. Get a life people! It's a freakin' picture of a vampire! Sorry if some of us don't get off looking at pictures of chairs and rolling nice green lawns on our magazines. Go read Better Homes and Gardens or some crap if you don't like CGW. And CGW, keep putting out more and more awesome covers! Alaric We'd like to thank all those who wrote in support of the April cover. When the issue came out, most of the feedback was negative, so most of the May issue letters reflected that. Since then huzzahs have outnumbered hurrumps about 3 to 1. It has been the most controversial cover ever, and we thought we'd print a few more opinions here before closing on the issue. I just read the Letters section in May's issue. Screw all the prudes, wussies, and whiners that didn't appreciate the fine example of a female vampire that graced April's cover! Keep up the good work, CGW. From a 33-year-old male who gets a mahogany whenever Cleopatra's emissary visits him in Civ II. Grant Berdan had a great makeup job. However, shouldn't the fang marks have been vertical, not horizontal? I don't think it's possible for someone to get bitten on the neck at the angle portrayed on the cover. Gary Bremer, Ir. U.S. Navy We've learned that to shoot a vampire you must: get the model for at least 3 hours, watch where the makeup artist puts the bite marks, and make sure her bustier fits.

What was all the fuss about? You see a lot worse on TV, at the movies, at the mall, at the beach, etc. You would have to stay in a room with no TV, never go out, or blindfold yourself not to see this kind of thing. Anyway, keep doing what you do best and that's put out a great magazine. You don't have to worry about me ever canceling my subscription, unless you start covering country music or give sewing tips. Doug Anderson So much for the Garth Brooks Cross Stitch Strategy Tips Special fit your target demographics (34, white, professional male), and I am sick of seeing women used as marketing devices. If CGW wants to use sex to sell, that is your right and the consumers will then vote with their dollars (you might be on the winning end). But don't take your argument for doing such to some false intellectual plane. It is pure \"boobs, sex, violence = sales (money), and we want ours\" marketing plain and simple. Scott Morgan I thought that the Vampire cover was inappropriate. The cover should be representative of what the other 200 or so pages of the magazine contain. The people who are looking for video game content are now saddled with a magazine that, while the content is appropriate for many age groups and environments, the cover is not. You do not do your readers a service by putting them in this situation. Ryan Spanton I'm appalled at the rash of letters concerning your April cover. What's the big deal? Anytime I want to see worse than that, all I have to do is watch an episode of Melrose Place. Clearly we as a nation either have way too much time on our hands, or are just too friggin' repressed. Perhaps it's a combination of both. Mike Bean MAILING LISTS We periodically make lists of our customers available to mailers of goods and services that may interest you.

Last April I converted to the Macintosh after using a PC for more than 10 years. I have to say it is by far the best computer I have ever used. The only problem is that good games are sometimes hard to find. I solved that problem by sticking Orange Micros' high end PC card in my Mac, so basically I have two computers in one box. Helps save desk space. It works great and plays all the latest games great. As for the iMac, this is not a gaming computer. To get a good gaming computer you have to get one of the desktop or minitower G3 models.

Otte (Planning and Development) Charlotte Rush (Communications) I can understand how some people would get upset when they saw the April cover, but I saw something in the May issue that put it into perspective: an ad on page 135 for the ATI Rage Fury shows two eyes in a bag. Now if I was a parent, that would send a chill up my spine and make me wonder about the current state of humanity, not some beautiful woman dressed as a vampire.

Obviously I don't read CGW for the in-depth Macintosh product reviews or all the snide remarks that sneak in where ever possible (though I do find them amusing). I read CGW because where else is a Mac guy going to get the dope on all the great new titles that might someday make it to his computer? I just purchased my April edition, flipped through the first few pages and there it was! An almost fair article on Apple and how it is finally getting its act together! Who would have thought I'd see such an article in the \"PC or die\" game mag of them all. The article was very fair, though it's obvious that you still don't get it, but it is a start. Then to top it all off you went and listed the Mac system requirements for MYTH II! Keep it up and you might end up with a few thousand new subscribers Mart Mabry The Mac is indeed a viable gaming platform again. The iMacs are hot sellers, and the new G3s are solid gaming systems (see our review on page 132). The only problem remains a lack of titles. Apple insists (as they have for years) that this time they're really going after the gaming market. We hope they put their money where their mouth is and help developers convert more new games to the Mac.

"THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Edited by jeff_green@zd.com   E CGW Does E . Your Fearless Editors Roll Up, y the time you read this, the CGW editors will have dogpiled into the company 1972 WW van and gone on their way to Los Angeles for the annual headache-inducing gaming extravaganza known as the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Yes, like taxes, or a bad rash, E3 is upon us once again, and it's our job be there and soak it in. Hype, parties, booth bimbos, and the occasional computer game are what E3 is all about, and we'll do our best to cover it all for you. Check www.gamespot.com for up-to-the-minute coverage, and be sure to read our upcoming, humongoid, post-E3 Fall Preview issue later this summer, once we're back at the office and sober again. In the meantime, here are 10 of the games we're most anxious to see at this year's expo: D A Tune In, and Turn On for the Biggest Gaming Event of the Year E R Black and White Is it a game or an elaborate Rorschach test? About all that's clear about the flagship title from Peter Molyneux's Lionhead Studios is its sweeping ambition. Incorporating elements from Molyneux's groundbreaking POPULOUS games, this god game could shatter the real-time strategy mold by responding uniquely to every gamer's style of play. The game's magic sysBLACK AND WHITE tem will encompass pure good, pure evil, and everything in between, allowing players to play as they wish. The hook here is that the physical world and everyone and everything will reflect the tenor of your play, with the earth charring and splitting under evil rule or thriving under benevolent guidance. BLACK AND WHITE has the potential to be truly revolutionary. COMMAND & Command & Conquer 2: Tiberian Sun CONQUER 2: TIBERIAN We want to see TIBERIAN SUN simply because we're champing at the bit to play it. While we were hoping the game would ship in time for last SUN Christmas, we're encouraged by the designers' taking the time to balance and tweak it properly. We'll wipe the anticipatory drool off our chins long enough to check the progress of the dynamic, problem-solving Al, the new units, and other game revisions before relaying the information to you, our beloved readers, in a future issue. Deus Ex Of the initial lon Storm lineup, the one title we anticipate the most is also the one that is getting the least hype. The fact that it's an action-RPG using the UNREAL engine is already intriguing, but the setting and involvement of designing legend Warren Spector (SYSTEM SHOCK, ULTIMA UNDERWORLD) is DEUS EX www.computergaming.com "


"CGW BOES E3 5, 10, 15 YEARS AGO REALITY CHECK WEB PICKS what makes this title stand out. No fairies or magic pixie wands here: Instead, you get spies, conspiracies, and locales like the White House and the streets of Shanghai. Think James Bond meets The X-Files with the UNREAL engine and the creative energy of an industry veteran—and you can see why we can't wait to declassify this game at E3. READ. ME Diablo II Merely the sequel to one of the best games of the last decade. Blizzard's been working on this title for so long now, and we've been anticipating it for so long, that it's easy to forget to be excited about it. But make no mistake, this display is going to be one of the most crowded, popular ones at E3, and we'll be there too. Remember how much better WARCRAFT II was than WARCRAFT? And remember how awesome the original DIABLO already was? Don't start underestimating Blizzard now. 5, 10, and 15 Years Ago in CGW What We Were Writing About While You Were in Diapers 15 Years Ago: June 1984 By far the silliest thing in this THE issue, the ad for the \"Grand GRAND Stand\" is a shining example STAND of '80s gamer's kitsch. A tall. curving, freestanding post to hold your joystick in front of your chair, the device removed any question of whether game controllers are phallic symbols It might hold your stick steady, but it's doubtful that any dork with one sitting in the living room would have any chance at scoring SUPPORT Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe Finally, Looking Glass has taken its talents for developing realistic looking and flying flight sims and added a much-requested feature: guns. Taking off at E3, FLIGHT COMBAT will have you flying over European terrain with the quality of the company's FLIGHT UNLIMITED titles. But those who aren't interested in practicing for a real pilot's license will find a highly detailed damage model, realistic flight physics, and Al pilots of varying bravery levels more engaging than pretty scenery. A flight recorder will let you savor your kills, and there's even apparently a chance there will be a flyable Me-163 rocket plane. COMPUTER Cles Force Commander In an effort to make sure George Lucas can still afford to buy groceries after the release of the Star Wars Episode / this summer, LucasArts will be showcasing this real-time strategy title. Shown at last year's E3, FORCE COMMANDER has been MIA for a year FORCE COMMANDER and has been the subject of more rumors than Area 51—is it set in the classic Star Wars universe or the prequel? Why is it taking so long? We debunked some rumors in our special Episode / preview last month, but we hope to bring you more info when LucasArts lifts the Cone of Silence in L.A. 10 Years Ago: June 1989 In June 1989, the esteemed Dave Arneson, codesigner of Dungeons and Dragons, wrote a great review of HIDDEN AGENDA, a \"Banana Republic\" simulator. The gamer is \"El Presidente\" of a small developing nation trying to steer a course through various political minefields. An entire game could be played in under two hours, while providing deep levels of simulation. This game is still fun 10 years later and stands as a great example of how gameplay is more important than flashy graphics. Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Harrison Ford may be getting too old to make another Indy movie, but at least gamers will get the chance to play his digital avatar in this third-person action/adventure title. Set CGW's BAO Reality Check 5 Years Ago: June 1994 1994 was unquestionably the year of DOOM. Significant advances in technology made it an addictive single-player expeCOMPUTER rience. It was however, the WINGS multiplayer component that OF ORA brought workflow to a standstill in offices across America (especially ours). Five years later, John Romero, the most famous of the id team, is still winning awards for his efforts: Most recently, Ton Storm's DOMINION got runner-up for our Coaster of the Year award. The cheap shots never stop, folks. Van Halen's David Lee Roth once said that the reason that all rock critics loved Elvis Costello was because they looked like him. This same theory explains why all the gaming critics love HALF-LIFE: We all look like Gordon Freeman.

ME after World War II, INDIANA JONES AND THE INFERNAL MACHINE will stay true to the spirit of the movies as Indy races against time and around the globe to thwart a group of nasty Russians out to rebuild an ancient device capable of generating incredible evil. Jane's USAF From the creators of ISRAELI AIR FORCE, USAF will feature a new terrain engine and campaigns ranging from historical Vietnam missions in an INDIANA JONES AND THE INFERNAL MACHINE F-105 Thud to future scenarios in the F-15C and F-22. It will also introduce Jane's new World War multisim multiplayer support. We're anxious to get some hands-on time in this sim, and we're also hoping to hear more news about the F/A-18 sim under development by Jane's Baltimore team. Q2 *99 Panzer General 3D PANZER GENERAL'S record as the best-selling computer wargame is in jeopardy, now that AXIS & ALLIES has sold more than 350,000 copies. So, the retail wars should only escalate when SSI ships PANZER GENERAL 3D this fall-especially since it's one of the few turnbased games to actually utilize Direct 3D. Aside from the typically tough SSI computer opponent, PANZER 3D should be more playable over the Internet than its storied predecessors, if only because SSI Online should actually function more like Battle.net than a standard Web site. Wargaming could really use a spark, and PANZER GENERAL 3D should cause as big an explosion as the original did five years ago. Q2199 94 199 Q3 '99 Ultima Ascension With a significant amount of playable code ready, Origin should be rolling out ULTIMA ASCENSION in a big way at the show.

Browse the finest selection of classic coin-op arcade games and buy that sit-down Donkey Kong you've been dreaming about since 1986. he first shots have been fired in Game Console War IV, with Nintendo and Sony answering Sega's DreamCast salvo not with hardware, but with psych warfare. The DreamCast, out now in Japan and set to ship in the United States before Christmas, is certainly an impressive system. But even with its next-generation PowerVR graphics, it's not a big enough jump to have you trading in your PC anytime soon. At the Game Developers Conference in March, Sony showed off a number of dazzling PlayStation 2 demos, with real-time work Sega's Dreamcast is getting lots of station-quality graphics wowing even the hypeso maybe that's why Sony and jaded developer crowd. That machine, howNintendo are blowing lots of smoke ever, won't ship in the U.S. until the end of about their own upcoming machines. 2000-at the earliest. Meanwhile, Nintendo announced that a group of ex-Silicon Graphics engineers known as Art-X were developing a next-generation machine for that company-but Nintendo won't even make specs available on the unit until the end of this year. These early announcements by Sony and Nintendo break with the companies' usual tradition of keeping things under wraps until the last minute. The companies likely want to deflate any excitement about the DreamCast, in hopes that the machine will die in Sega Saturn-like obscurity while gamers wait another year for the Sony and Nintendo machines. So how does all this affect PC gamers? While many have commented that prototype games on the PlayStation 2 blew away anything currently available on the PC, the same could be said in 1993 about games for the original PlayStation. By the time the new Sony and Nintendo machines reach U.S. shores, PC gaming technology will likely have caught up or surpassed them. So look at these new systems not as technological threats, but as previews of computer gaming to come. The more significant effect will be the continued popularity of low-cost, high-quality game machines. These new units may serve to keep PC gaming in its niche, about a quarter the size of the console market. Although there are few console games with the depth of their PC cousins, the units' low price and ease of use means the mainstream will find them an attractive alternative to the PC market, with its higher cost of entry and cavalier \"fix the game after it ships\" attitude. -Denny Atkin JEFF'S PICK www.gameguides.com/guides/baldurs Desslock's massive, exhaustive, online guide to BALDUR'S GATE is the ideal help site for those, like me, who spend more time reloading the game than actually playing it.

"PREVIEWS.COM Ultima Ascen YOUR BEST SOURCE FOR THE HOTTEST GAMES IN DEVELOPMENT For the Ninth Time, Origin Rewrites the Role-playing Book by George Jones LTIMA ASCENSION begins with a jolt-literally. One evening, the Avatar (the virtuous hero who has saved Brittania at least eight times prior to now) dreams of a towering column of fiery stone rising from the earth, killing an old farmer in the process. Knowing that this is a sure sign something is wrong in his alternate reality, he rises from his bed. And the game begins. You don't fiddle with menus or waste time with text-filled screens. After you install the game and witness your dream, you get right out of bed, put on your clothes, amble out of your bedroom, and jump into the heart of ULTIMA ASCENSION's gaming environment. most everything in it actually works, from the alarm clock to the big-screen TV to the light switches. There's even a bread maker in the kitchen and a grill in the backyard that you can use to make steaks. The backyard also functions as a training ground of sorts that allows you to practice combat skills, maneuvering skills, and yesjumping skills. Settle down, ULTIMA VIII veterans, jumping is not a frustrating experience this time around. Instead of needing impossibly dexterous arcade style reflexes, you jump onto rocks and over rivers in this game simply by moving your mouse to the spot you want to jump to and then clicking the mouse button. Combat is also a snap you maneuver the Avatar around with the GREAT BALLS OF FIRE Casting spells is easier than ever, but ULTIMA purists will still be able to mix up unique magic using reagents. In what some may view as a move to attract the mainstream masses, the designers are simplifying some of the more stat. oriented aspects of traditional role-playing games. Instead of tracking scores in 4,835 different attributes and skill sets, this ULTIMA is a bit more intuitive: Numbers have been turned into descriptions with tangible benefits. As you gain experience, for example, you may find yourself becoming a journeyman and gaining an extra attack type.

"Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned SIMEAK PREVIEWS Gabriel Knight 3 by Johnny Wilson he Jacobites might have thought a bit differently of Bonnie Prince Charlie if they had known the mystery underlying GABRIEL KNIGHT 3: BLOOD OF THE SACRED, BLOOD OF THE DAMNED (GK3). Designer Jane Jensen is no longer content with drawing us into mysteries that are tied into voodoo and werewolves. Now, she is deftly pulling together the rumors and conjecture, the theories and the shocking speculation that surround the most mesmerizing conspiracy of all time: the Holy Grail. GK3 has everything: a kidnapping, a treasure, a cover-up. a secret society, a reunion, and some of Jensen's classic use of the supernatural. Gabriel, our hero, is still the lugubrious, drawling bookstore owner and novelist by chance, who has inherited the title of schattenjger-a shadow-hunter of the supernatural. He is still assisted and occasionally accompanied by Grace Nakimura, and he also runs into his old pal Mosely. Plus, there's a new supernatural adversary: the night visitors, Jensen's fresh take on vampires. Like its predecessors, GK3 features terrific puzzles and an extremely well written story. It differs mainly in that you don't have the graphic novel effect of the first game (although there is a graphic novel introduction to the game) or the interactive video experience of the second. Now, the entire environment is 3D, and gameplay is friendlier as a result. You no longer have to walk Gabriel all over the screen in order to get him into position to see something. You can fly the camera independently; then, when you're ready, you click on the floor or on an object and Gabe immediately walks into the picture from off-camera. We also like the fact that the cursor lights up whenever it crosses a hot spot, thus doing away with those annoying \"hunt the pixel\" puzzles. Another improvement is that there is no onscreen toolbar unless you decide to call it up by right-clicking your mouse. This gives you a full-screen perspective at all times with a pop-up interface only when you really need it. In addition to using a pop-up toolbar, the interface also has the capacity to grow. Want to talk to the innkeeper? Icons show up for each topic, reminiscent of the interface in another Holy Grail game, CIRCLE OF BLOOD. Want to attach an item to a verb for regular use? You handle everything with an easy click. The new 3D engine and improved interface make everything about GK3 easier, except the puzzles themselves. Another major difference here is that instead of being divided into chapters (as in the first two games) GK3 is divided into days with several time blocks within each day. Each time block has several \"must do\" actions before you can advance to the next time block-and each time block has enough optional actions that it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to do them all in your first playing of the game. pipe Glastonbury Heir The story itself begins with an invitation for Gabriel and Grace to meet an heir to the Scottish throne. Grace believes that this is because of Gabe's position as heir to the venerable Ritter heritage. Naturally, because of Gabe's heritage, the schattenjger tradition comes into play. The principal characters meet in Paris and, after a sinister series of events, a chase sequence takes Gabriel to the south of France. There, in Rennesle-Chateau, a small village in the Languedoc region, the mystery begins to be decoded. Languedoc is a province noted for heresy, Exclusive Hands-On Look MEZ Gabriel Knight 3 Bus Vasos . GENRE: Adventure RELEASE DATE: Q2 '99 DEVELOPER: Jane Jensen PUBLISHER: Sierra ONE SCREEN FOR ALL MANKIND GK3 gives you a full-screen perspective with a freeflying camera view, a pop-up command toolbar, and occasional cinematic cutscenes within the 3D engine. TOPICAL FRUIT Conversations throughout the game are driven by icons that reflect dynamically the topics that Gabriel has uncovered during the course of his investigation. 6Z COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"SNEAK PREVIEWS BANNER EAR Gabriel hides behind a banner in order to eavesdrop on a key conversation. Ambient audio adds depth to GK3, but important audio clues are close-captioned. inscriptions are presented in a 3D virtual museum in which you can fly the camera and examine anything. Of course, purists may not like Jensen's addition of a hotel to the mysterious village and her use of a museum dedicated to Sauniere as a handy source of clues. Just remember, poetic license has been around at least since the time of Homer, and the use of a fictional hotel and a museum speeds up the pace considerably over having to travel around the country side for clues. ALTAR EGO As in the \"virtual museum\" sections of the first two Gabriel Knight games, you'll be able to scrutinize items of interest-such as this altar piece in Rennes-le-Chateau-at your leisure. Once out in the countryside, you'll face a timing puzzle or two. Think of it as basic surveillance. Indeed, you'll occasionally have to direct Gabriel to hide and observe in order to get the clues and answers you'll need to get to the endgame. This section has a very different look to it but in effect, the overview map recalls the New Orleans map in the first game and the U-bahn map in the second. All of this sleuthing serves as preliminary to the scenes in the underground temple, however. The temple contains puzzles based on paradoxes, chessboards, and more. Think of the motif as a mixture of Egyptian mythology, alchemical symbolism, and Gnostic philosophy. Nothing is what it appears. Considering the Arian and Catharite heresies that flourished in the Languedoc region, the mixture is perfect for the mystery. With all of the conspiracy, heresy, treasure, and crime abounding in GABRIEL KNIGHT 3: BLOOD OF THE SACRED, BLOOD OF THE DAMNED, you could almost assume that the supernatural elements so prevalent in the first two games would be missing. You would be wrong. Jensen has weaved a vampire plot into the game (isn't this logical, given the emphasis on blood in the Grail legends?), and you're not likely to forget the antagonist in the final showdown. There is also an intriguing supernatural connection to the kidnapped baby that initiates the action. As with the previous games, GK3 won't frighten you with gore and nightmarish creatures, but it will mess with your mind. In any game in which Jesus, conspiracy, magic, and vampires intermingle, you'd expect to be more than a little disconcerted. As well-crafted as any of its ancestors and, if anything, even better written, GABRIEL KNIGHT 3: BLOOD OF THE SACRED, BLOOD OF THE DAMNED seems destined for controversy if not preternatural success CGW witchcraft, and a mysterious treasure trove, reputed to include the Holy Grail---the chalice that Jesus used to serve the wine during the Last Supper and into which Joseph of Arimathea collected the blood of Christ while he was on the cross. While those of Celtic descent would heed the Grail legends surrounding Glastonbury. Rennes-le-Chateau is a worthy rival with significantly more mysteries surrounding it. It is a place where Mary Magdalene is more revered than the Madonna herself. It is the birthplace of the Cathars and the Priory of Sion. It is a mysterious place held holy since ancient times; a place where the mountainous geography is strangely symmetrical, forming a virtual pentacle of peaks for sacred bonfires and ritual observation. It is a locale where many believe that Egypt's Isis cult flourished in the days before the region's conversion to Christianity under Clovis I (circa AD 496. prior to his AD 507 victory over the Visigoths). It is the ancestral homeland of the Merovingian lineage, the long-haired and reputed magical kings of the land that would eventually become France. In short, a perfect place for a mystery. The game re-creates the church at Rennes-le-Chateau with exacting detail, much the way GK2 did Mad Ludwig's castle. The strange devil holding up the holy water fount, the statue of Mary Magdalene with a skull at her feet, the extremely unusual Stations of the Cross, and bizarre Digital Divination Fortunately for Grace and Gabriel, they are not on their own in figuring out this mystery. Since some of the mystery has to do with strange geometrical clues in paintings and natural landscapes, they are assisted by SIDNEY, a computer interface. SIDNEY will not only assist in following up on basic clues, but will also provide a rich, searchable database on Egyptian mythology and the ties to Isis and Osiris that you are likely to uncover in the search for the treasure. Certain items have to be \"scanned into SIDNEY in order to solve the mystery. Indeed, you will have to superimpose geometrical shapes over these images in order to reach the proper conclusion. Naturally, this is no problem for gamers who are familiar with the literature concerning Rennes-le-Chateau. Books such as Henry Lincoln's The Holy Place and David Woods' Genesis feature diagrams superimposed over topographical maps all the time. Both researchers note that there is both a pentagon and a hexagon construction that overlay the geographical area. For those who are into the mystery, placing points and shapes on a map has a real ring of truth. For others, this will still be an intriguing puzzle, since it hinges on one other vexing element. Jensen has taken a poem called \"Le Serpent Rouge\" and built a series of riddles around the wordplay in the verses. If you can figure out the secondary meanings and obscure references, then you'll have no trouble solving the geometrical puzzles. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999 "

"Dreamforge Takes PANZER GENERAL Into Eldar Space With Attitude 04 Warhammer 40,000: Rites of War SME AKPREVIEWS CARNIFEX The encyclopedia is a treat, even if you're not a Warhammer 40K fan. TALES FROM YOUR ELDARS One thing's for sure: PANZER GENERAL never looked like this. by Samuel Baker 11 ames Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 (affectionately known simply as 40K) has for many years offered a dark, compelling, and competitive science-fiction universe for board and miniatures enthusiasts. PC games based on this universe have yet to fully capture the flavor-or the sales numbers-of the original. Part of the reason for this has been a failure to re-create the stunning, if sometimes bizarre, graphics of the tabletop game. WARHAMMER 40,000: RITES OF WAR (RITES) suffers from no such handicap. The graphics are delightful: Each unit has its own idle, attack, and death animations. The effects of weapon fire are appropriately depicted; troops with heavy flamers, for instance, graphically roast their targets. But there's more to RITES than just pretty explosions. The game deals in detail with the trials and constant battles of the Eldar-essentially space elves with attitude a once great race now wandering space in huge starships. As a lord of the Eldar, you are tasked with recovering a number of artifacts thought to exist on the fringes of the former Eldar Empire. RITES steers you through three story arcs of eight scenarios each, featuring more than 30 different Eldar, 20 Tyranid, and 20 Imperial units that include Eldar Avatars, Tyranid Hive Tyrants, Imperial Terminators, and Blood Angels Space Marines. In addition to the full campaign, there are five multiplayer scenarios and seven for solo play. The single player scenarios are split into minicampaigns for the Imperial and Eldar forces. The game comes with a complete scenario/ campaign editor that allows full editing of objectives and scripts. If you really want to play the Tyranid (think Aliens with technology). you can roll your own campaign once you tire of the canned missions. Any side is available for multiplayer games you proceed through the campaign, your units' abilities develop. adding a nice RPG element. Units don't lose experience when taking on replacement points which should lead to looser, more risk-taking play. Units may also be held in barracks until needed. According to producer Sam Clifford, SSI chose the standard-size Warhammer 40K army sets rather than the Epic scale used in FINAL LIBERATION (SSI's most recent PC Warhammer) to make the game more personal. In Rites, the four arms types-air, infantry, armor, and artillery-all seem to be well integrated into the design. Eldar infantry, for example, can become increasingly specialized, with many different paths of advancement that aren't open to vehicles. As commander, you choose the aspect of the particular Eldar god you want your infantry to emulate, giving your troops greater power in one area but less in others. You'll buy units and upgrades by expending glory points, which work much the way prestige does in PANZER GENERAL, except that RITES is more forgiving. If a unit is completely eliminated, its experience is lost, but the points expended on it are returned so that you may recover from defeat without hitting the reload button. Even in this early version, the computer opponent does a credible job on the battlefield. Once contact is made, enemy units advance quickly to pick out and engage targets. Units don't always fight to the death, but engagements are typically Warhammer-bloody, and every tum usually involves the elimination of some units, even in the smaller battles. Given the talent that's involved here, this seemingly bizarre marriage of the popular PANZER GENERAL system and the quirky Warhammer 40K universe could create the mass-market hit that Games Workshop fans have been looking for. Better yet, the game should be enjoyable even for those who don't know the difference between a Tyranid and an Orc-or a Zerg. CGW WARHAMMER General RITES uses a simplified version of SSI's classic PANZER GENERAL engine, with each unit rated for life, armor, melee, leadership, rangedattack strength, initiative, range, spotting, and movement.

"The ability to jettison parts is crucial to METAL FATIGUE's strategy. Several weapons, mostly energy swords and power saws, are built to be amputating instruments: Equipping a combot with one of them introduces the possibility of severing an enemy's arm. Should you do that, you can simply drop your old arm, snap the enemy's arm on, and, presto!, you've got a whole new combot. Even better, you can then take the new arm back to your base to research it so that your forces will be able to produce it themselves. Besides letting gamers expand their faction's technology base beyond the 20 or 50 technologies they start with, it forces gamers to fight for upgrades instead of sitting back, mining resources, researching, and building up for a humdrum game-ending rush. It's a great design element that should ensure almost constant engagement and action. METAL FATIGUE is definitely a title to watch out for when it ships later this year.

Thundering behemoths with an insatiable appetite for destruction are one of the cornerstones of our nation, our judicial system, our very way of life.

"ALOD OYSOFT TETA PONTIFF ROCA FOODS INC COIFLE SHAMru by Robert Coffey porting a brand new MLB license, a 3D engine, and improvements in almost every facet of the game, HIGH HEAT BASEBALL 2000 (HH2K) is the baseball title to watch this year. HH2K could be the first sports game in years to give the EA Sports dynasty a real run for the money. GANO OMFANY SINE AK PREVIEWS BREAK IT DOWN Among HIGH HEAT BASEBALL 2000's coolest features is an instant replay that tracks the heartbreaking trail of a breaking ball. Building a Contender The design team has made a real effort to address last year's shortcomings, and it appears to be paying off. The horribly animated 2D players of last season have been traded for a roster full of 3D polygonal players. The animations are much more lifelike, with believable swings and relief pitchers who drop down and sidearm the ball. Incidental animations such as pitchers throwing up their arms in frustration at a bad call or batters who stumble across the plate after lurching out of the way of an inside fastball give the game a real majorleague feel. Once Team .366 smoothes out the somewhat jarring transitional player animations present in the pre-beta version we played, HH2K could be as good looking as TRIPLE PLAY 3DO has wisely shelled out the bucks for a MLB license, so that gamers will finally be able to play with the big boys. A draft has been added and players will have the ability to play seasons of 16, 81, or 162 games. Regrettably, there currently are no plans to let you create custom leagues. Why, with the wild popularity of rotisserie leagues, designers continue to downplay the appeal of a custom league utility is beyond me, but, hey, I'm just an enormous fan who knows at least eight other guys that would love play in a High Heat Baseball 2000 Last Year's Promising Rookie Could Be This Year's All-Star custom league. Still, should you decide to run a league with your buddies, HH2K should support hotseat, LAN, and Internet play. quick pitching you into oblivion. The statistical model has been beefed up, keeping track of split stats as well as rating every player in various batting, fielding, and pitching abilities. If the game's stat engine works as promised, gamers should see the realistic ebb and flow of major league baseball over the course of a season, as unhittable pitchers suffer through occasional rocky starts and homer-launching sluggers endure cold spells. The most promising sign that Team.366 is onto something came in one game I played. Down by four runs with two out in the bottom of the ninth, I hit what seemed to be a gameending grounder when the opposing team made an error that let the hitter reach first. A series of singles followed and I won the game. If HIGH HEAT BASEBALL 2000 can consistently capture the intangible Bill Buckner quality that makes baseball baseball, then it could well be the title that computer baseball fans have been waiting for. CGW Franchise Player The best news is that the gameplay looks to be even better than last year, (which, despite its flaws, played more like real baseball than any other game). Managerial options have been expanded, letting wannabe dugout geniuses guard the lines or set up for the double play, and a real bullpen has been implemented so you'll actually have to FOODS INC COFFEE SH manage your pitchers.

"The Richest of Real-time Strat Games Gets Richer Seven Kingdoms II SNEAK PREVIEWS WAR ISN'T HELL... IT'S FREE ARMY MEN 11\" by Terry Coleman revor Chan is one designer who can never be accused of insulting the intelligence of his fans. Booting up Chan's CAPITALISM, for instance, is as close to a crash course in high-end cutthroat economics as you're likely to get this side of Harvard Business School. But if you aren't careful, dealing with anything near that kind of depth in a typical realtime strategy game can quickly have WAR IS A MANY-TENTACLED THING you longing for the comparatively mod SEVEN KINGDOMS Il revels in the est tech tree of AGE OF EMPIRES. differences between historical and With that in mind, we thought it was neo-mythic. Here, Fryhtan hordes time to take another look at Chan's become the Carthaginians' ultiupcoming SEVEN KINGDOMS II. My main mate nightmare. concerns have always been that the look of SEVEN KINGDOMS II might have trouble competing with more graphically delectable fare like STARCRAFT, and that the interface wouldn't sufficiently help you keep track of the wide range of activities you can perform.

The Fryhtans, those pseudomythical beings born from the darker warlike recesses of Chan's fertile mind, have an even greater role here than in the original game. Not only do they sport more arcane technology and new magic spells but you can also play the Fryhtan Empire, driving puny humans before you. The variety of scenarios and campaigns is staggering, and Chan is trying to pull off a random campaign generator that could be the most dynamic we've seen. There are four new human civilizations-Carthaginian, Roman, Indian, and Celtic-with a number of new abilities: ninjas for Japan, Druid Magic for Celts, and the like. Heroes make their first appearance as well, though these don't seem to overwhelm play in the manner of MASTER OF MAGIC. Having Hannibal, Genghis Khan, and Richard the Lionhearted combine forces to drive out the Fryhtan menace may not be historical, but it's a total kickand it requires that you master the arts of diplomacy as well as combat. Like its predecessor, SEVEN KINGDOMS II is more sophisticated, and thus more difficult than the usual real-time clickfest. In addition to new battlefield tactics such as formations, there are a number of new research paths in the rich technology tree. I particularly liked using espionage, and the enhanced military tech available really enhances game. play—though I'm not yet sold on the advanced axe-throwing ability of the Vikings, especially when facing the Fryhtan antihero Bregma, Seven Kingdoms II Master of Insects.

"by Marc Dultz ast year, THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR ably modeled modern combat at the often nebulous operational command Ilevel. For 1999, the award-winning turnbased wargame system moves several steps further, now portraying conventional warfare from the climactic days of 1956 to the close of the millennium. SNEAK PREVIEWS Anywhere New to Fight? THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR II (TOAW II) will reportedly cover many of the principal military engagements waged during this turbulent time frame, including America's illfated involvement in the Vietnam War, three Arab-Israeli wars, the protracted Iran-Iraq conflict, and Operation Desert Storm. What's more, TOAW II will depict several hypothetical, \"what if\" scenarios, including a 1962 invasion of Cuba by the United States, a supposed Sino-Soviet conflagration in the late 1960s, several different NATO-versus-Warsaw Pact showdowns in Europe, a second Korean conflict (circa 1999), resumption of hostilities between India and Pakistan, and even an invasion of Taiwan by Communist China. As in TOAW, the units and maps in TOAW II will vary in scope and scale, with units ranging in size from individual companies to entire corps, and hexes measuring anywhere from 2.5km to 50km across. In addition to a simplified (and welcome) play option that will enable players to issue default orders to their units, TOAW II will contain a much more detailed treatment of nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) weapons, including the incorporation of certain triggering events that may escalate their usage.

While these specialized personnel will attend to various supply and maintenance functions for each combat unit, there may be instances when the unit in question will be paralyzed for a turn or two if its staffers are killed in battle. And although the unit may still be operating at 100 percent readiness, it may not be able to resume normal military operations until its cadre of specialized personnel has been totally re-formed. Loads of new units and equipment will be featured, too, such as attack and transport helicopters, man-portable antitank and antiair weaponry, surface-to-air (SAM) missiles, mobile 22222 The Operational Art of War II GENRE: Strategy/Wargame RELEASE DATE: Q2 '99 DEVELOPER: Norm Koger PUBLISHER: TalonSoft/Take 2 Wong COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  JUNE 1999 "

"G.O.D. GAMES G.O.D.'S WORK ...is done out of a church. But the Gathering of Developers aren't choirboys-considering that they have titles like MAX PAYNE, HEAVY METAL: FA.K.K.2 and KISS: PSYCHO CIRCUS in development. Who are they, and why do they think they're out to save gaming? by Ken Brown 102 COMPUTER AMING WORLD JUNE 1999 "


"G.O.D GAMES t's anything but business as usual for the Gathering of Developers. The brash new Dallas-based game publisherotherwise known as G.O.D.-has shaken up the industry by shaping itself as a developer's collective. Their strategy: Fund good games by successful developers, pay higher royalties, and give game makers more credit and creative freedom. If the G.O.D. strategy pays off, it could result in healthier independent developers and better games. It may also serve as a hedge against the kind of publisher consolidation that has occurred in the console-game sector of the industry. To fulfill their vision, G.O.D. cofounders Mike Wilson and Harry Miller set out to create the gaming industry's version of the film world's United Artists. UA was formed in 1919, when Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford got fed up with the way the big studios were exploiting people. They formed a company that rewarded their talent and put more of the decisions in the hands of those who understood movie making. With that in mind, Wilson and Miller formed a collective with eight developers, including 3D Realms, Ritual Entertainment, and Terminal Reality, all of which have a say in the titles G.O.D. publishes. The strategy has been controversial. Early critics claimed that G.O.D. wouldn't have the marketing muscle to put enough of its titles on mass retailers' shelves. Others said putting the lunatics in charge of the asylum would lead to blown deadlines and kitchensink game design. But the evidence is beginning to mount that G.O.D.'s plan is indeed working. In the 18 months since G.O.D.'s inception, it has helped develop 10 games, published JAZZ JACKRABBIT and RAILROAD TYCOON IL (both of which sold well), and has a string of impressive titles lined up that include FLY!, MAX PAYNE, HEAVY METAL: F.A.K.K.-. NOCTURNE, and others (covered in the following pages).G.O.D. also appears to have made an impact on the way publishers structure developer royalties, which have grown from the low teens to 20-30 percent. That's not to say G.O.D. is taking over the world. Since the company is so lean, with a skeletal marketing and management crew, the Gathering can't fund more titles before shipping a top seller or raising outside capital. In addition, G.O.D. still hasn't attracted a top-tier, high-profile developer like id Software, Ensemble Studios, or Valve. Even 3D Realms, arguably the highest-profile member of the Gathering, hasn't committed wholeheartedly, allowing only certain titles to go out under the Gathering label (and DUKE NUKEM FOREVER isn't one of them). WHAT'S G.O.D.'S PLAN? So where is all of this leading? No matter how successful the Gathering is, it probably won't threaten the long-term hegemony of publishing powerhouses like EA and Microsoft. But Wilson believes it's important for someone to act as a counterweight to the big boys. He wants the Gathering to \"keep the balance of power weighted in the direction of the creators rather than the financiers, before consolidation makes things really scary.\" Of course, G.O.D. could become a big boy itself. It happened to United Artists and, more recently, to Electronic Arts, which was founded on some of the same ideals. G.O.D.'s founders have said that they expect to grow with the addition of other development companies, and they hope to take on more titles when they have the money. And what if they got an offer for $50 million to sell out? \"I'd take it.\" Wilson replied. \"Then I'd buy one of my other partners out and get back in. It's still too much fun shaking things up in this ridiculous industry to walk away completely, and I don't know how anything could compare to the Gathering in that area.\" G.O.D.

"Max Payne G.0.D. GAMES ax Payne is in a world of hurt. As an undercover DEA operative in New York City, he's not in the easiest of professions. Three years ago his wife and child were brutally murdered by the New York Mafia, and he now finds himself undercover and up to his neck in the biggest organized crime family in the city. It seems that there is a new, deadly drug on the streets, Valkyr, and Max is getting close to the source. But just as he gets onto something big, his superior officer is killed and the murder is pinned on Max. This of course hits all of the local papers, blowing his cover in the mob. Quickly he finds himself being chased by the cops and the Mafia. Welcome to the world of Max Payne. MAX PAYNE is being developed by Remedy Entertainment in Helsinki, Finland, under the watchful eye of the game's publisher, Gathering of Developers (G.O.D.). Remedy isn't very well known (the company's biggest hit to date was the driving title DEATH RALLY, a lackluster seller), but with G.O.D.'s help, the company hopes to hit the big time with MAX PAYNE. Metion to the Max In the Gritty Underworld Max's trials will take place in areas ranging from down-and-dirty industrial settings all the way to palatial, upscale havens where the \"real evil dwells,\" according to MAX PAYNE's Game Designer Sam Lake. Some of the game's interiors sport amazing detail. The designers have created realistic environments that are unmatched by anything else we've seen. It's one thing to conjure up alien environments, but quite another to accurately and believably render the real world. The game will use dynamic radiosity lighting to ensure that the environments are as believable as possible. Realism and beauty do have their price, of course. MAX PAYNE will be 3Daccelerated only (supporting Direct3D along with native support for many 3D cards); there will be no software rendering for the Luddites among us. For that extra sense of realism, the Remedy team is sending a group of artists, armed with cameras, into the streets of New York City to gather scenes that will be incorporated into the game's environments. The designers intend to take the real world New York City scenes down a notch into the gritty underworld of film noir—and just when New York's image was starting to improve. Rudy Giuliani won't be pleased. Prepare to Truly Feel the Payne What a Character But it's not just interiors and exteriors that show the designers ambition. Max and his adversaries are also rendered in great detail. The game's skeletal animation system wraps several layers of player \"skins\" around a simulated skeleton, resulting in characters whose clothing and motions are very realistic. Capes and coats flap in the wind, and roll-and-dive moves border on the cinematic. The traditional downside to detail in computer games has been the unavoidable slowdown in frame-rates at higher detail levels. Remedy has solved this problem in MAX PAYNE by using what Project Lead Petri Jrvilehto calls a \"level of detail system. This renders objects in the distance with relatively few pixels, and uses progressively more pixels as the object by Joe Vallina MODEL THIS!!! MAX PAYNE's ballistics model is impressive. In this shot you can clearly see each individual pellet-and you'll feel them too. Genre: Action. ETA: Q1 '00. Developer: Remedy Entertainment 104 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"II comes closer and fills a greater portion of the screen. In this way, the computer has to perform fewer of the complex calculations that slow down scene-rendering. Another trick the design team is using to maintain high frame-rates is something called \"exit optimization.\" In this technique, the computer draws only what the player sees, instead of everything in a specific area, whether or not the player is aware of its presence. For example, if you're looking through a doorway, only the objects and portions of walls in your direct line-of-sight will be rendered. G.0.D. GAMES I IT SPLATTERFEST 101 This shot demonstrates the particle rendering that the Remedy team is building into MAX PAYNE (notice the splattering blood). Cinematic Action The Remedy guys are major movie buffs, and it shows in MAX PAYNE's design. Remedy hopes to let the gamer have a cinematic experience while playing the game, all the better to draw him into what Remedy promises will be a deep plot. That's why they decided to show Max in the third-person perspective. The designers felt that a first-person perspective just wasn't an option to fully show off all of the great moves Max has at his disposal. If you've seen any John Woo movies, you already have a good idea of the kinds of moves Max is capable of performing in the game. From the standard crouch to the supercool sideways jump while opening up with both barrels to falling backward into a rolling getaway move, Max will execute moves other game characters can only virtually dream about Of course, Max isn't invulnerable by any means. If all that dodging and jumping doesn't quite get him out of danger and he ends up taking a bullet or two, he'll accurately reflect the injury. If he's shot in the leg, for instance, he'll limp his way through the rest of the game. And if he takes one through the chest, well... be sure to check out that exit wound coming out of his back before you reboot. \"If Max takes one through the chest, well... be sure to check out that exit wound coming out of his back before you reboot.\" Super Slo-Mo One of the more novel aspects of MAX PAYNE is its use of slow motion. Throughout the game, the gamer will see many sequences play out in John Woo-style slo-mo action scenes that let you fully appreciate the level of detail while you experience that ever-soimportant movie feel. The slow motion will be scripted into the game, so that it will kick in at predetermined times. Slow motion will also be LIGHT UP THE NIGHT These two shots demonstrate the impressive lighting effects in MAX PAYNE. Notice how the shooter's face and body are realistically lit by the muzzle flash. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999105 "

Rudy Giuliani won't be pleased.\" BULLET IN THE HEAD Max can do tons of cool John Woo-style dives and rolls. The Bottom Line The danger in making a very cinematic game is that it will be pretty to look at, great to read about, and boring as hell to play. By adding new, experimental elements like slow motion, the Remedy designers are going out on a long, precarious limb. But if they succeed-and it looks as though they very well might, in spectacular fashion--they will take action gaming to the next level. Here's hoping they do.

"Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.2 Sex G.O.D. GAMES eavy Metal is the ultimate teenage fantasy come to life: mind-bending animation, intense violence, and hard-driving rock. The 1981 movie was an electrifying ride across 11 unrelated and inconsistent) stories linked by a mysterious green orb. Spawned by the fantasy maqazine that featured some of the world's most psychotic illustrators, it became a cult classic. Now, two all-new, wildly stylized Heavy Metal projects are heading our way. A new movie, coming this fall, will combine bizarre 3D animation with an epic story and a sexy female heroine (based on B-movie queen and former Penthouse Pet Julie Strain). Meanwhile, Ritual Entertainment is working on a game using the QUAKE III engine that will blend action, adventure, and innovative combat control in the Heavy Metal universe. Eager to see how the game is taking shape, we flew to Dallas to get the world's first look. US and Rock & Roll What the Hell Is F.A.K.K.2? Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.4, the movie, is the brainchild of Kevin Eastman, cocreator of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (hey, at least the cowabungholes are helping to subsidize something interesting). The story behind the movie evolved from the 1993 graphic novel The Melting Pot, by Eastman, Simon Bisley, and Eric Talbot. After The Melting Pot, Eastman wanted to do an epic film with a strong female lead and an evil nemesis. \"I always wanted to create a heroic adventure with a female star,\" says Eastman, \"thriving in a backdrop that would combine the desperation of Road Warrior, the intensity of Aliens, the visual feel of Blade Runner, and the magnitude of Akira Kurosawa's Ran. It's intensely violent, very fast-moving, very fast-paced.\" HAPPY MASK Gith In the futuristic story, F.A.K.K. stands for Federation Assigned Industries wants its Ketogenic Killzone, a biohazard warning to interplanetary workers to be happy. explorers. F.A.K.K. indicates a biohazard so dangerous that nothing can survive it. F.A.K.K. is also the name of an idyllic world and the woman who is trying to protect it. But the real reason Eastman coined the term is because he wanted his female lead to have a name that sounded like \"F_you!\" With love in her heart and two automatic, four-barreled blasters in her hands, F.A.K.K.2 sets out to free her sister from a ruthless monster (Lord Tyler) who ravaged their planet. The $15 million movie is coming this fall from Sony & Columbia Tristar.

The game's story picks up where the movie leaves off. Players control F.A.K.K. (a.k.a.

"BELPHEGORIAN CITIZEN These charming freaks are large, mentally deranged inhabitants of the Belphegorian slums. They relish in the physical and will go to extreme lengths to \"perfect\" themselves. Anything from removing an old arm to make way for a new one to aggravating the pox rash they have on their butt. The redder and more painful and pustulant, the better. G.0.D. GAMES HEAVY METAL'S QUAKE III engine can handle large outdoor spaces, curved surfaces, and 24-bit color. SU Gith-think Microsoft meets Mussolini in an H.R. Geiger nightmare has been motoring around the galaxy in a spaceship strapped to a conquered, decimated planet. The company is looking for an upgrade and has discovered Julia's world. Time for our heroine to break out the fourbarreled blasters again. Ritual describes the gameplay as TOMB RAIDER-esque: third-person perspective with equal parts action and adventure. As with TOMB RAIDER, the designers chose the third-person perspective to show off their female character. But there is a more intriguing reason: Twohanded combat will allow both ranged weapons and melee weapons simultaneously. \"You'll be able to outfit your character with different combinations of swords and guns and be able to use both at the same time,\" said Project Manager Steve Hutchins. \"Picture Braveheart-type slashing while wading through an onslaught of enemies. Right now we are looking at rightand left-hand attack buttons to keep things simple; that coupled with off-screen outfitting should reduce the overall numbers of keys you have to learn. You'll thank us later when you see how many enemies you can encounter at one time,\" Hutchins added rather ominously. In addition, combat should be more grisly and realistic than in previous games. The game's QUAKE III engine allows body parts to be swapped or removed instantly, enabling such effects as blown-off limbs, gaping holes, severed parts that still move, and more. Expect new warnings about playing too soon after eating when the game ships. Sights & Sounds There are a couple of things for which Heavy Metal is knownboth the film and the magazine and those things tend to raise more than a few eyebrows. Judging by the early artwork, audiences can expect to get an eyeful in the movie, which will likely get a PG. 13 rating. Nudity in games, however, is a sensitive matter, given the availability of games to minors. Developers are often caught in the middle between their desire to build visually interesting games and their need to sell those games to large retailers. What does the team from Ritual plan to do? Art director Rob Atkins says, \"We are going to make a fun game based around an adult movie/magazine with a sexy female hero. If we sneak in a nipple or two here or there, I doubt that anyone will give a shit. Wal-Mart and the other retailers are more concerned with what the box looks like on their shelves than the content.\" Heavy Metal is also known for its hard-driving soundtrack.

"Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.Z the movie sequel, it's likely the game will have a kick-ass soundtrack. At press time we were unable to obtain a complete list of songs, but Kevin Eastman has been talking with a number of music groups, including U2, Smashing Pumpkins, Hole, Metallica, KISS, Sammy Hagar, Alice in Chains, and Aerosmith. With all of the assets of the movie at its G.O.D. GAMES disposal, plus the QUAKE III engine, Ritual has a very good chance of producing a standout game. Whether the company will or not depends on many factors, not the least of which is learning from the mistakes it made with SiN. To their credit, the designers have changed the way they work and affirm that they will perform whatever bug-testing is necessary in the future to ensure quality products. We sure hope so, because if they get it right, this game will rock in more ways than one.

"KISS: Psycho Circus KISS the Game G.0.D. GAMES \"ISS is back with a vengeance. The original line-up (Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley, Peter Criss, and Paul Stanley) is back on the world stage, touring in the United States and Europe and raising a new KISS army. Their licensing army is also on the march, spinning off KISS masks, KISS guitars, KISS Wrestling, and even a KISS computer game. Is it too much? It always is; that's why it's KISS! Now in development the computer game-KISS, PSYCHO CIRCUS: THE NIGHTMARE CHILD-is based on the KISS, Psycho Circus comic book series by Todd McFarlane, the creator of Spawn. Developer Third Law Interactive, a start-up group comprised of lon Storm refugees, is using a modified version of Monolith's Lithtech engine, which was used for SHOGO and BLOOD 2. Third Law plans to rev the engine extensively and throw down a hail of nasties your way. \"We're an unproven group, so we want an intense, actionfilled experience,\" says Sverre Kvernmo, game designer for Third Law. Gamers will have to contend with large groups of demon-spawn, the creations of an unborn evil that is somehow altering reality. As the game progresses, the gamer advances from mere mortal to a creature of godlike powers, based on McFarlane's characterizations of The Elder (alter egos of the members of KISS). Gameplay will vary as you control each of the four Elders, with different environments, powers, and challenges. You'll need to assemble the five parts of each KISS member's costume to give you the power to defeat the Nightmare Child, since each item holds special powers. The platform-boots, for example, will increase your jump height; the breastplate gives you better protection, and so on. (We wonder what Gene Simmons' tongue will do.) Watch for this interactive oddity to come out early next year.

Here's the game that will let you fight battles with Viking .weapons and explore a strange world where mythical creatures and gods exist. You'll play Ragnarok, a 10th-century Scandinavian warrior. You venture out to battle with warring tribes, angry gods, and giant snakes that breathe fire. If you can stop whatever seems to be annihilating the Viking population, you'll prove worthy of entering Valhalla, the great beer hall in the sky. RUNE is being developed by Human Head Studios, Composed of former members of FASA Interactive and Raven Studios. For RUNE, Human Head has teamed with Epic and is using a modified version of the UNREAL II engine. \"Visually we're going to be on par with UNREAL II,\" says Human Head biz guy Tim Gerritson. \"Some of the features we're building in include enhanced physics, more natural level design, curved surfaces, and ambient life. We want to make each level memorable. Our goal is to make a game that is epic in feel rather than scope.\" Gamers will be able to equip themselves with armor and use an assortment of Viking weapons, such as axes, swords, and hammers. Ragnarok may also have a few magic spells up his tunic. The game will be designed with singleand multiplayer levels, so that you can cross swords and bash skulls with your friends.

"Murphy's Field baq OD Murphy's Field Day A Lesson in Following My Own Advice Ultimate Game Machines to a Pentium III, so I had a spare Pentium II/450 available. I also had a couple of big EIDE drives and an Intel motherboard. All i needed was a case, a power supply, and a floppy drive. At the same time, the noholds-barred rig needed a new motherboard tray in the Inwin tower case, as I'd successfully stripped the screw holes on by Loyd Case his column was originally going to be about nifty little utilities I use, and how they can help readers tweak or improve their systems. Maybe I'll still do that one some day. However, my research for the column was interrupted when Murphy's Law, coupled with my innate ability to overreach, got me in big trouble. It's such a good cautionary tale that I can't help writing about it. It all began with Winalign, a little utility that ships with the Windows 98 Resource Kit. It supposedly restructures Windows programs so that they load more efficiently, speeding up software loading. It sounded like a good idea. In the help file for Winalign was a blurb suggesting that performance may not improve until you defrag the hard drive after running Winalign. one: Always test a new utility on a small scale until you know it's safe. So, of course, when I ran Winalign for the first time, I ran it on the entire Program Files folder on my main production system. Strike one. Rule number two: Never, ever make multiple changes without testing each change first. The next thing I did was run Norton Utilities Defrag Utility. As I was perusing the defrag utility, came across a seemingly helpful item: the Norton Optimization Wizard. It stated, seductively, that my system would run better if I optimized the swap file. So I ran it. After a reboot, defrag came up and started running. Note that by now, I'd run Winalign on all my critical applications, run the system optimization wizard, and was defragging the drive. new 9GB drive. I used Ghost-a very cool partition-copying utility—to try to copy the old partition to the new drive. There were a number of \"bad sector on read\" errors, which wasn't good news. But the partition copy completed, and I booted the new drive. Explorer promptly crashed. I did a refresh install of Windows 98. After doing this twice, and swearing a lot, I finally got a good boot. But whenever I would right-click on \"My Computer,\" the system would hang. Finally, I gave up. I nuked Windows 98 and did a clean reinstall, including all my applications Strike three, you're out. It was a hard lesson-and what made it worse was that knew what I'd done wrong. I ignored my own rules, got a little cocky, and ended up wasting a LOYD CASE Someone should have showed up on my doorstep and told me I was nuts. huge amount of time. But wait, there's more.... Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch I decided it was time to rearchitect my production system. I've been wanting to get more serious about learning 3D modeling and digital video, but being the kind of person I am, I wanted the production system to be the best performing system I could build. Although my priorities are different from those of most users, I'm still budget-constrained couldn't go out and build a hotrod DV rig without wrecking my marriage. Then I realized that the system I use every day had an Ultra2 SCSI controller and two 7200RPM SCSI drives. That's bigtime overkill for running Word, surfing the Net, and playing a few games, so I thought I'd make that my 3D modeling learning rig. I'd recently upgraded one of the several mounting brackets. So I thought I'd swap trays. Did I mention it was CGW's deadline week? To recap, I'd decided to run some new utilities on my main machine, build a new system, and swap motherboard trays on the power rig, all during deadline week. This is the point where someone with some common sense (my editor, maybe) should have showed up on my doorstep and told me I was nuts. My reach was definitely exceeding my grasp, but I didn't realize it. Then Murphy came a-knockin'. Strike two. Rule number three: Never, ever panic or show frustration. The gods of computing delight in torturing easily frustrated users. I had to let defrag run all night (it takes a while to fully optimize a 9GB hard drive). When I came back the next morning, there was an error message indicating that a problem had been found with the hard drive and that Norton Disk Doctor or Scandisk should be run. So I rebooted. When Windows came up, every utility and driver that auto-loaded on startup crashed. So did Explorer. My system was totally hosed. So rebooted to DOS and ran Scandisk. After about a thousand bad sectors were uncovered, I panicked. Roughly $450 later, I had a Cut to Scene Two I thought I'd take a shortcut with the new system I was building and just boot off the Windows 98 full-install CD. At that point, the right thing to do would have been to copy the contents of the \\win98 folder from the CD to the hard drive (after the drive had been formatted) and install from there. Instead, I ran setup direct from the CD (after having booted from the CD). Now, bootable CDs are wonderful no more boot floppies with missing DOS driversbut they aren't perfect.

"Tech Tips When playing first-person shooters (UNREAL, HALF-LIFE), my system spontaneously reboots. I have dual Monster 3D II's in SLI mode, a hardware DVD decoder, a SCSI controller card, two SCSI hard drives, a DVD drive and a CD-R. What could be the problem? Try putting the NIC in one of the middle three slots. The two outside slots (the one next to the AGP slot and the other next to the ISA slots) share IRQs. However, the 3Com cards aren't happy about sharing IRQs. HARDWARE I have a joystick connected to my sound card. I just got a new, USB gamepad. When I install them together, the gamepad shows up as the top device in the Game Controller Control Panel, and the joystick as the second device. All my games refuse to recognize the joystick. Is there any way to use both devices? during the setup process if you leave the CD in its bootable state—which of course I did. Normally, if I'd been focusing on just installing this system, I would probably have remembered that quirk, but I was also trying to troubleshoot my production system and swap motherboard trays on the big rig. After several tries, remembered the problem with the bootable CD and copied the files to the hard drive. Then Murphy struck again the mouse wouldn't work. After three installation processes and a couple of mouse swaps, everything was hunky-dory. Meanwhile, the big rig was having its own set of problems. The tray swap went fine, but after rebooting, the SCSI hard drives would lock. Again, instead of focusing on the problem, I was also trying to install a new system and troubleshoot my production system. After much wailing and gnashing of teeth, I found some bent pins on the SCSI cable. Roughly $120 in SCSI cables later, the SCSI drives would still lock. After a night's sleep, I remembered that I'd recently done a clean reinstall of Windows 98 on the big rig. The ASUS P2B-LS motherboard uses an Adaptec 7895 Ultra2 SCSI controller chip, and Windows 98 has built-in support. But there's a bug-either in the driver or with the motherboard BIOS—that causes the CD drive to get confused when you copy big files from one hard drive to another. Installing an updated driver that I'd downloaded much earlier from the ASUS Web page cured the problem. There are two possibilities. First, your power supply may be inadequate for the heavy load you're placing on it. Many off-the-shelf systems from companies like Dell and Micron come with measly 200W power supplies. You may need to upgrade your power supply to something beefier, like a 300W unit. The second problem could be heat related. Add an additional cooling fan to the case. You might even consider adding specialized Voodoo2 coolers. Also, clock back the Monster II's a bit, which could help reduce any potential heat issues. Unfortunately, you may be out of luck. In the days of DirectX5.0, there was actually a bug in DirectInput that prevented the second joystick from being recognized so no games really took advantage of it. Now, that \"tradition\" has continued, although a few games are supporting multiple controllers. Microsoft is trying to evangelize game developers to support multiple controllers, but it may be some time. Meanwhile, the only thing you can do is manually move the joystick to the top slot when you want to use it. I tried to install TalonSoft's West Front recently in my spanking new Gateway system, but when I try to run the game, it keeps asking me to insert the CD. But the CD is in the drive! What gives? I have seen the terms \"OEM\" and \"white box\" on discounted video cards. What do these terms mean? Is it OK to buy these video cards? This isn't TalonSoft's fault. TalonSoftand many other game companies-are moving to CD-ROM based copy protection mechanisms. In some cases, we've seen incompatibilities with certain CD-ROMs and DVD drives. However, the Gateway problem specifically lies with their BIOS. You need to get a BIOS update from the Gateway Web site and update your system. If this makes you nervous, have a Gateway technician walk you through the process. Help! I just tried to download and install Internet Explorer 5.0, and my graphics card no longer works properly. It's a Diamond Viper 550. Is there any way to fix the problem? A OEM stands for \"original equipment manufacturer,\" which is an oxymoronic term that means a product was neither manufactured by nor originated within the company that shipped it. White box hardware is essentially the same. Both terms refer to hardware that is sold to dealers who are theoretically supposed to build it into whole systems. OEM hardware typically comes without software, except for drivers. In a few cases, it may also have fewer features. (TV output capability is a feature often left out of white box hardware, though not always.) In the past, you really had to watch out, as some white box hardware may actually be less capable and perform poorly, despite the same name, but that's not as prevalent. Some memory configurations may only be available in OEM hardware (for example, 8MB TNT boards). Send your tech questions to Loyd at CGW_Letters@zd.com. Mea Culpa So here I sit, out roughly 5600 in hard drives and cables, and having had to painfully relearn lessons that I'd learned before. So this leads me to the last and final rule of computing: Rule number four:Just when you get good enough to be arrogant about it, the gods of computing will make you pay. Next time, I'll remember. CGW Diamond discovered a problem in certain cases where installs of new drivers somehow interacted with IE5. Diamond's now got a new driver on their web site that fixes the problems with IE5. 7 I recently tried to add a 3Com PCI ethernet card to my system. It has an ABIT BH6 motherboard. The system refuses to install the drivers. How can I fix this? www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999 "

"REVIEW. KDS VSF15 FLAT-PANEL DISPLAY Flat 'n' Noisy somUT HARDWARE by Dave Salvator flat-panel display is quite likely in your future. The question is, when? We've seen so-called 15-inch flat panels (whose viewable area is more on par with a 17-inch CRT monitor) hitting the streets for under $1,000, and as these prices continue to drop, flatpanel starts to look more appealing. But look before you leap. COMPUTER Because of bandwidth limitations, analog flat-panel displays' image quality is often inferior to that of their CRT counterparts. One such example is KDS' new VSF15 display. Its image quality is decent in games but not up to snuff for Windows 98 and commandprompt viewing. The VSF15 is a breeze to install and its power cord and VGA signal cord are integrated into a single strand, making for less behind-thePC clutter. The VSF15 is a plug-andplay monitor, and Windows 98 recognized it on boot-up. The first sign of trouble came when the onscreen display (OSD) information reported the unit was displaying 1024x768x16 at 70Hz refresh rate. This is a letdown because most CRTs can easily display 1024x768x16 at 85Hz. Four OSD buttons are mounted on the back, forcing you to have to feel around, braille-style, in order to tweak the monitor's settings. to what you get on TV when a station isn't tuned in correctly. Color photographic test images (24-bit) fared better, looking pretty good at times in spite of some flaws. The news for games is better. HALF-LIFE, JANE'S WWII FIGHTERS, and VR BASEBALL 2000 all looked pretty good, though even there! occasionally saw shadow effects caused by the display. Flat panels are still in their infancy on the desktop. Digital flatpanel displays will go a long way toward solving analog's current shortcomings, but until a final standard is hammered out, the choices for digital flat-panel tie you to graphics chipsets that you as a gamer probably won't want. In the meantime, KDS' offering is passable for games, but for that same money you could get a 21inch CRT (if you've got the desk space) and have enough dough left over to pick up two new games as well. CGW GAMING ** WORLD PROS: Painless installation; integrated power/signal cable; decent image quality in games. CONS: Severely noisy display on test patterns, blurred text in Windows 98 and text-mode display.

"REVIEWSGRL TITAN'S SPHERE GAME CONTROLLER Dreams Die Hard HARDWARE by Loyd Case he Holy Grail for today's controller makers seems to be to develop the perfect 3D game controller. Unfortunately, the Titan's Sphere isn't it. When I first saw prototypes of this unique 3D game controller, it looked promising. The way the controller worked resembled controllers used for Waldos (those robotic controllers used to handle highly radioactive materials). The grips fit comfortably in your hand, and the whole affair rests in your lap. Additionally, the Titan's Sphere is very easy to configure it operates like a standard, four-axis, four-button Windows controller (which means it also works in DOS). In practice, it's quite awkward to use. This first becomes apparent when you try to calibrate it. Due to the sculpted grip and the button placements, it's damn near impossible to calibrate the thing without accidentally pressing a button. Pressing a button in the middle of calibrating a Windows game controller jumps the control panel to the next step. Once you get past that process, you move to gameplay, where the awkwardness continues. got pretty tired even though the controller rests in your lap, there's a tendency to pick it up as you're trying to rotate the grips. Button placement is awkward, too-it increases the chances of pressing but tons at just the wrong time. On some other gamesnotably 3D shooters like QUAKE 11-the controller is hopeless.

"REVIEW  VIEWSONIC PT795 MONITOR Perfectly Flat and Nearly Perfect LARDWARE by Loyd Case ace it, monitors are just not sexy. But if there ever could be a sexy monitor, the PT795 would qualify. This new 19-inch monitor from veteran manufacturer ViewSonic is a member of the new generation of \"perfectly flat\" displays. Although it uses a (relatively) standard aperture grill tube, the P1795 achieves its flatness by first adding a layer of COMPUTER device. It enables ViewSonic's monitor control software, which allows you to set up the monitor more easily than if you used onscreen displays (although it was unavailable for testing). However, at least one game with a subtle DirectInput bug crashed on startup-until the monitor's USB hub was disconnected from the PC. Most games shouldn't have this problem, however, and the hub worked great with several USB game controllers. The PT795 also has a high bandwidth and can support an 87Hz refresh rate at 1600x1200; it maxes out at 1920x1440 resolution. So if you can afford its hefty price tag, then the PT795 is a gorgeous display that will do justice to any of today's graphically intensive games. CGW glass that optically corrects the underlying curved image-it's essentially a weak lens. Flat glass is then added on top of the curved glass, and that's what you see. At first glance, the display appears almost concave, because we're all used to seeing curved images You'd think that adding two layers of glass like this would distort the underlying picture, but during image quality tests, the only defect I could find was a bit of corner moiré distortion. Color registration was precise and the overall image quality was sharp To sweeten the pot, ViewSonic adds a USB hub to the PT795. There's a slight twist, though. In addition to registering a standard USB hub, Windows 98 also finds a \"USB Human Interface Device.\" In other words, the hub is an active GAMING EDITORS' CHOICE COMPUTER WORLD GAMING PROS: Ultra-flat screen, bright image, high bandwidth.

Aside from featuring the occasional puddle of melted plastic, the game almost completely wasted its theme. ARMY MEN II continues this disappointing tradition by making only a few halfhearted nods to the true milieu of these little green men—the imaginary battlefields of our childhood bedrooms, our dens, and our neighborhood yards. There are some clever maps set on places like kitchen counters and model tables. But these levels are too few and far between, serving as interludes between dull realworld environments. The developers of ARMY MEN II just don't seem aren't useful as anything other than Keystone Cops-style bodyguards: They cluster around you and shuffle nervously, occasionally attacking enemies in range. Luckily, gameplay in ARMY MEN Il is primarily a matter of charging headlong at the enemy, because the limited choice of commands that you've got at your disposal doesn't lend itself to many tactical options.

"RESIDENT EVIL 2: PLATINUM EDITION  REVIEW Zombie Jamboree They're Dumb, They're Ugly, and They're Hell-bent on Eating Your Brains! by Jesse Hiatt ESIDENT EVIL 2 will probably stand as one of the best console games of the 20th century. Too bad this isn't a console magazine. More than a few developers who've passed through our offices have readily admitted their debt to the horror classic, however, those same developers have been able to complete their entire production cycles in the time it took Capcom to release this port. RESIDENT EVIL 2: PLATINUM EDITION is going to have trouble competing with all those more advanced made-for-PC titles. But RE2 is still a game worth playing, if only for its solid gameplay, its strange Japanese translations, and its wacky humor. RE2 takes place in a universe so faithful to the plot conventions of the classic Night of the Living Dead movies that you could almost consider the game an unlicensed adaptation. Both are slim on characters and sets but are definitely thick with drama, tension, After you play through a plot from one character's perspective, you can go through the plot you just finished from the other character's point of view. Some of the decisions that you make the first time through will affect what happens when you play the plot from the other character's viewpoint: You'll see the same rooms, but the puzzles, item distribution, enemies, and side quests will be KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD Well, ankle-deep at least. Helping zombies return to their more traditional, nonambulatory dead state is all in a day's work different. This means for cop Leon Kennedy. the game's two-plotper-character format and humorous B-movie dialogue. The fixed camera angles can be yields a total of four plot lines. RE2 uses all these techniques to a problem: They occasionally get in for the RE2 hard-core who wore great effect. the way when you're killing zomout their console version, the PC bies—a definite downer since RE2 edition has something new to Twitch and Shout has more combat than the average offer: Extreme Battle Mode.

"SOUTH PARK  REVIEW Going South ACT LONA SOUTH PARK License Can't Save the Weak Game Behind It by Thierry Nguyen uck on my chocolate salty balls...put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em!\" Either you recognized the South Park quote or you're flipping to the cover and wondering if you bought the wrong magazine. Relax. You didn't. South Park is one of those popculture phenoms that make companies hunger to snatch the license and whip up a quick game. In this case, unfortunately, the license is better than the game in both its PC and console versions. It's Coming Right for Us! The game's campy premise gives you the feeling of playing a long episode of the TV show. Essentially, a giant comet of evil has landed in South Park and has generated many enemies ready to go on a rampage. The infamous four South is very uninspired. The problems start with the level design: Everything looks alike, so you have to pay attention to the arrow signs to get through the linear levels. There is no real Al to speak of; any difficulty comes from simply stacking the odds. The levels that make up an episode tend to focus on just one or two enemies and throw them at you in hordes. Quantity over quality is the leveldesign mantra here. Multiplayer is slightly better, since you have a larger variety of CRUSH THEM, GIANT ROBO! Enemy design is sorely lacking; the characters/skins.

"TUROK 2: SEEDS OF EVIL REVIEW Dinos in the Mist ACTION The Follow-up to an N64 Hit Hunts for Some Respect pools of gray poi collecting in the nooks and crannies of the structures you're looking at. It's just one more amateurish touch that tarnishes the game BORED SILLY Who says games are too gory? The brain-drilling cerebral bore has blood effects that would make Ray Harryhausen proud. by Tom Price UROK 2 must have seemed like a good proposition to Acclaim; based on a popular comic book series, the original TUROK was wildly popular on the N64. But the PC port of the original was somewhat less than impressive, so PC gamers haven't exactly been waiting on pins and needles for TUROK 2: SEEDS OF EVIL. That's too bad, because in spite of some significant faults that keep it out of contention for a place among the HALF-LIFEs of the world, TUROK 2 at least deserves a look. TUROK 2 begins after the destruction of the Campaigner and the Chronoscepter at the end of TUROK: DINOSAUR HUNTER. This time you are Joshua Fireseed, the new Turok, and you must fight your way through six worlds full of aliens, zombies, and, of course, dinosaurs, defending the energy totems against the Primagen. Helping you in your quest is Adon, the requisite buxom-babewith-an-English-accent, who announces all the weapons you pick up and can't be taken seriously at all once she says \"flamethrowah.\" Too bad, because some of the weapons are quite cool. The aforementioned flamethrower sends out a nicely rendered arc of sends out a nicely rendered arc of fire, while the firestorm cannon has a cool triple-spinning animation and a deadly rain of fireballs. The most gruesome weapon (and therefore my favorite) would have to be the cerebral bore. No, it has nothing to do with William F. Buckley. Instead, it's a brainwave homing, exploding drill bit. The beastie lucky enough to get one of these locked onto his skull writhes around while the bore whines away like a dentist's drill, spraying blood and gray matter until the bore finally explodes inside the head of the creature, popping it like an overripe melon. Yum! Unfortunately, technical glitches abound in TUROK 2. The most ridiculous example would have to be the bloodstains. If you kill a monster next to a w monster next to a wall, bloodstains actually hover a few inches above the wall itself, and if you're near a corner, as much as 50 percent of the bloodstain bitmap will hang over the edge, in midair. While these aren't exactly game-stopping bugs, they don't do much to improve the game's overall image. Also problematic is the fogging, a cheap way of avoiding Z-buffering that's a carryover from the N64. In sniper mode, the fog forms a hard edge instead of a gradual one that makes for The Lost World The biggest downside to TUROK 2 has to be the level design. You run around, find the switch, hit the switch, find the door that opened, rescue someone, find the portal, go to the next maze of repetitive bitmaps, and generally operate in a confused state. Further addling is the overlay map, à la DARK FORCES. It's a serious pain trying to watch out for hazards in front of you while playing a game of Lock 'n' Chase at the same time. Worse yet, there is no static map that you can access while paused. What seems like an attempt to be challenging ultimately just makes the game boring. So if you're thinking about suggesting some TUROK 2 multiplay the next time you're meeting with your QUAKE clan, forget it; they'll laugh you out of the group. However, if your 10-year-old cousin who got that new Celeron for Christmas needs a game to introduce him to first-person shooters, you could do a lot worse than TUROK 2. A whole lot.

"REVIEWS Run and Gun It's Action the Old Fashioned Way—Fast and Violent NOTALOV perpetual sense of impending doom-one that unfortunately detracts from enjoyment. The game won't let you axis-map analog throttles and brakes, meaning that owners of four-button sticks and wheels must use two buttons for digital speed control while accessing the keyboard for camera views and weapons. Plus, only the N64 version of the game has multiplayer racing—one more reason why EXTREME G2 is best reserved for its original audience: the console crowd. -Gordon Goble very attractive affair. ROLLCAGE's intuitive menus, enormous options and settings area, awesome graphics, and skill-testing driving model show that England-based designer ATD (Attention to Detail) really put some work into this one. The game has some of the most visually impressive weapons and power-ups ever to torture a 3D card, yet each is geared to a specific purpose. Just try pulverizing a building before you've scooted by Extreme G2 the latter and come up with a great addition to the shooter SIN. Unlike other mission packs, WAGES OF SIN (WOS) also manages to play off and add to the SIN storyline. This time Blade is up against a nasty local crime organization called, you guessed it, the Mafia. These baddies have been hiding mutants in the sewers, under the leadership of family boss Gianni Manero. After a band of hapless construction workers accidentally bump into Manero's mutants in the sewers, Blade is called in. WOS adds 17 new levels to the SIN universe (including multiplayer levels with cool hoverbikes) and seven new weapons. There are also 12 new enemies, plus two rather nasty end bosses. T he Al has also been improved, with enemies consistently trying to evade your attacks. You'll find that this adds an additional bit of zip to the game; it's just not such an easy affair to waste those monsters this time around. Activision has included an automatic patch to WOS that will upgrade your SIN installation to version 1.03. The patch makes a really big difference in terms of Rollcage Publisher: Acclaim Entertainment Price: $29.99 www.acclaim.net or scenery-smacking, speedfilled, oh-my-God-I'm-goingthe-wrong-way confusion, EXTREME G2 is the epitome of Bad 21st-Century Motorcycle Gaming. To be fair, the lightweight physics model is bearable and you get some interesting weapons. Gameplay modes include time trials and a drone-filled arcade thingy that seems a lot like a mobile SPACE INVADERS, but the basic idea here is to blast and race your way through a series of circuits to the \"Extreme Contest.\" Of course your opponents are trying to do the very same thing, and the challenge often lies in deciding between a clean, fast run or picking up some of the many yet momentum-crippling power-ups littering each course. Upgrade shops and garages aren't part of the equation, though you can choose from several uniquely performing bikes and win even bigger and badder machines as you progress. Track structure, though at times repetitive, is as wild as I've seen, with loop-the-loops, jumps, and spiraling tunnels pairing with ridiculously high speeds to instilla or launching a \"Leader Missile\" when that leader is you and you'll understand. The spectacular ROLLCAGE world teems with short cuts and unconstrained off-track spaces. Each undulating circuit is crafted to offer solace only to those who can adapt to its peculiarities and take advantage of its hidden rewards. And that's where that car model comes in. Terrifyingly responsive and inordinately powerful at first, ROLLCAGE cars call for a surprisingly modulated, pseudosimulation approach and prove to be a joy to drive once you get the hang of it. Split-screen multiplayer retards the otherwise smooth frame rate considerably and the game could do with a true cockpit rather then bumper view, but ROLLCAGE is nevertheless annoyingly addictive and a lotta bombastic fun. Just ignore all that upside-down stuff. -Gordon Goble ***** Publisher: Psygnosis Price: $49.99 www.psygnosis.com OLLCAGE strives to lead the congested combat-racing pack by offering reversible, gravity-defying cars that can ride up walls or along ceilings, yet somehow keep on ticking. Unfortunately, vertical and/or inverted ROLLCAGE driving is a wretched experience, one that'll toy with your equilibrium, screw with vehicle physics, and destroy any hope you had of winning a race. But if you play it as a right-sideup drive 'n' shoot, it becomes one Wages of Sin 1188 Publisher: Activision Price: $29.95 www.activision.com ission packs have the dubious history of either I reinforcing a bad game or taking a good one to another level. Fortunately. Activision has achieved performance. The excessively long loading times are history and the action is smoother as well. WAGES OF SIN is a worthy addition to the original Sin, adding new goodies while rectifying some of the annoying flaws of that predecessor. It's definitely worth checking out if you're an original SiN-ner. Jim Lynch www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JUNE 1999 151 "

Dynamix's STARSIEGE has wrested the crown from the MECHWARRIOR 2 series, the long-time king of the giant robot hill. Where the company's earlier EARTHSIEGE games were also-rans, STARSIEGE comes to the party equipped with a deep back-story, a number of gameplay innovations, and enough unique flair to make for stiff competition for the upcoming HEAVY GEAR || and MECHWARRIOR 3. Only time will tell how long STARSIEGE will stay at the top, but right now, the view from here is spectacular. HOW ARTICULATE Despite the lack of torso twist, articulated weapons still give the HERCs a decent field of fire. 2 trailer. This time, Dynamix didn't just write a convenient excuse for you to get into a fight, the company actually laid out the timeline for an entire universe. This ties STARSIEGE in with not only the EARTHSIEGE titles, but with TRIBES as well. The story is presented to you through a very detailed compendium, as well as through What's My Motivation? Earlier games in this series were hampered by a lack of background. Where MECHWARRIOR had years of development behind it and hundreds of pages of documentation from the paper-based Battletech universe, the EARTHSIEGE games had about as much exposition as a Terminator COMPUTER The Next Dimension The game engine is a beauty. STARSIEGE supports both Glide and OpenGL (officially, the RIVA TNT, but we had good luck with the Rage 128 as well) 3D cards, and has a capable software rendering engine for those who have not joined the cutting-edge club yet. Frame rates are smooth even on a 3D-card equipped Pentium system, and the textures and lighting effects are beautifully done. Sound effects and music are also well done, with 3D audio support for those who have the hardware. Input configuration is extremely detailed, allowing you to reconfigure every command in the game. There's even drag-and-drop reconfiguration of your Heads-Up Display layout. My control setuprudder pedals, CH Pro Throttle, and mouse-was easy to configure to work with the game, and it functioned flawlessly. The game's interface is well designed, with little jumping around necessary. Configuration can be done from the main menus, opposite sides. This background plays into strategies and even the design of the game's units. The rebels, for instance, use HERCS (this universe's name for its giant robots) based on souped-up construction equipment, and this is reflected in those units' physical designs, capabilities, and paint jobs. Eventually, though, the longdormant Cybrid threat reemerges, and changes humanity's priorities from conflict to survival. In addition to the built-in back WORLD * ** ** SSION THAT C Poase NOTE THE DIFFERENCE in scale between the tanks and the larger vehicles. Don't worry, the tanks give as good as they receive.

Here we see the The missions best way to smoke a Glitch. in STARSIEGE are a definite highlight. There are 34 single player missions, split between the human and Cybrid campaigns. Add to that the training and multiplayer games, and you've got more than 50 distinct missions to work through. Several of the missions found myself playing repeatedly just to play out \"what if\" scenarios, they're that good. The best thing about the missions is that, while they are scripted and not dynamic, you never feel like you're on an endless series of combat patrols. Each mission has distinct objectives that often change midstream, and they flow together very nicely. Not once during all the countless hours played STARSIEGE did I think to myself, \"Great, another canned mission.\" Dynamix plans to release a mission editor eventually, although they're still working out the details on how that will happen. The game has too many nice touches to mention them all. One example: Sitting in the cockpit of your HERC, watching Cybrid landing pods rain from the sky, you can feel the despair of knowing that an unstoppable force is bent on your destruction. The Cybrid units look decidedly alien and very menacing. and they are even more fun to pilot than destroy. The new cloaking devices, with their Predator-style shimmering effect, are also very cool, and add a whole new dimension to the battlefield tactics. Like a ghost, you can now slip in and out of the enemy formations wreaking havoc at will. There numerous other gizmos to load into your vehicles, like ECM units, extra capacitors, sensors, and so on. All of this variety means that there's little chance that you won't be able to configure a vehicle to work with your fighting style. the amusing STARSIEGE Football. Dynamix provides a free Internetbased matchmaking hub, and if you're in the mood for something a little more private, you can set up your own server. Server setup is absolutely painless, and if you have a spare machine, you can use the included nongraphical dedicated server process, which allows many more players in a game. While STARSIEGE is a very solid effort in today's world of patch-towork games, it's not glitch-free. Al units sometimes get stuck on objects, which causes them to stand in place, acting like a dog getting its belly scratched. Once time, I actually blew the feet of a unit I was sent to rescue because she wouldn't move to the pickup point. This was after had destroyed all the enemy units in the area by myself, which made for a particularly painful do-over. Also, don't be too quick to reconfigure your controls. The training missions use the default key configuration and ignore any custom setup you've done, preventing you from practicing the controls you'll be using in combat while you're learning. The annoyances I found were all pretty minor, and STARSIEGE is great fun to play. I didn't find anything that would keep this off anyone's play list, and I found a whole lot to like. It looks like the former also-ran is definitely now the one to beat.

"REVIEW  NASCAR REVOLUTION Revoltingly Bad Start This NASCAR Revolution Without Us SPORTSIRACUN mind off the stupefyingly unrealistic physics model. You know, the one that lets you take any corner, at any speed, from any racing line, with virtually identical results. Or that causes cars to stick —not bounce when they hit the wall. The game can be set to either realistic or arcade modes, but both feel about the same. by Scott A. May stock-car racing game for the simulationimpaired, NASCAR REVOLUTION offers arcade action for casual drivers, with variety and flash galore. But you'll need an industrial-strength PC just to drag this beast out of the pits. Again, Electronic Arts has used Stormfront Studios, the developer that dumbed-down the IndyCar experience in ANDRETTI RACING. That game was laughably simplistic, but at least it screamed and was a blast to play. No such luck with NASCAR REVOLUTION, a game that promises not to tax your intellect or skill yet puts your hardware through living hell. IT'S THE PITS NASCAR REVOLUTION's eye candy for the arcade crowd includes motion-capture pit crews who work feverishly to your specifications. All That Glitters At surface level, where even the dullest games manage to COMPUTER GAMING ** WORLD Pony Up Some Horsepower EA Sports promises this game will push your hardware to its limits, and it will, but not in a good way. Despite a minimum system requirement of a Pentium 200, the game was sluggish as hell on my trusty old P233 MMX, with 64MB RAM and 12MB Monster 3D II. So I tossed it on a PII300, with surprisingly similar results. Turning down the eye candy helps, but visual flash is the game's only redeeming feature; without it, all we have are boxy graphics and a pathetic driving model. If you're determined to stick with this game, my suggestion is to use the Direct3D rendering option, in which you'll lose graphic glitter but gain a consistently playable frame-rate. As you'd expect, the game's multiplayer performance is quite frightening. There's no Internet play, for obvious reasons, and even a direct serial cable (null modem) connection begins to shudder when more than four cars share the asphalt. LAN play fares best, but again, for the best performance, limit the total number of drivers in a single race. understand the market EA and Stormfront were aiming for with NASCAR REVOLUTION. What I don't get is how they managed to miss the mark so badly. The only revolution this game might incite will be at the return counter of your local software store.

"SUPERBIKE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP REVIEW GAMING WORLD Hog Heaven EDITORS CHOICE This Racer Boasts Challenges and Thrills in All the Right Places SPORTSZRACING by Gordon Goble here are games and there are classics, and in PC racing we are fortunate to have had our fair share of the latter. But whoever said a landmark racing game had to ride on four tires certainly didn't count on the latest release from the recently prolific racing stables of Electronic Arts. Designed by Italian-based game developer Milestone (SCREAMER), SUPERBIKE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP is an unexpectedly remarkable world class presentation of world-class motorcycle racing. It's so good that it gracefully renders its only true arcade affair with simplified riding and enough stereotypical coin-op menu trappings to look like an explosion at a Sega factory. The second game-within-a-game, however, is the real reason SUPERBIKE will make everyone's short list for racing game of the year. Let me put it this wayspent my first two hours perfecting a single lap at Italy's Monza, enjoying every subtle moment and reminiscing fondly about my earliest experiences with MicroProse's GRAND PRIX II. Make no mistake, with its multitude of difficulty and realism options opened, SUPERBIKE is at least that involving and perhaps even more difficult. First and foremost, there is little doubt you are astride a tenuous, temperamental motorcycle, one that differs from manufacturer to manufacturer. Accelerate too quickly and you'll wheelie and flip; brake too sharply on a downhill slope and you'll bring the rear wheel up and potentially take a header over the handlebars. Along the way. SUPERBIKE forces you to take an ultrasmooth approach and smart racing lines, with the believable crash-avoidance techniques and uncanny behavior of the Al competition an added bonus. Should you go for a spill, however, it's a wild show to be sure, with detached riders doing their best rag-doll impersonations, and bikes tumbling and skidding to a stop. Sadly, crash-damaged bikes and racers are not part of the equation, though at 100 percent realism you will have to run back to your overturned mount and manually get it pointed back in the right direction again before you can continue! GET ME OFF THIS CRAZY THING! The view from SUPERBIKE's firstperson camera, a truly frightening perspective, to exceed the recommended system requirements to experience its true glory while maintaining a workable frame-rate; but if you do it's a knockout show, with brilliant detail, shadows, lighting, tire smoke, and a gorgeous rendering process that creates unbelievable, almost TV-like images. It's not just the polish that shines-it's what's underneath, too. SUPERBIKE features a dozen of the finest real-life circuits ever seen in a sim. The game also never lets you forget that each rider is somewhat independent of his machine. You can see this best exemplified in the first-person perspective, in which the camera view actually bobs about in accordance with the position of the rider's head, not the handlebars. I, however, preferred the situational awareness of the third-person chase view. A full garage facility and seemingly accurate telemetry readings will help you tune your beast, and the game offers several modes of play from preseason practice through a full championship (with real-time qualification sessions) and several multiplayer options. SUPERBIKE doesn't pull any punches in the audio department either, superbly showcasing the unique engine notes of each of the five bike types on display and positioning the sound wonderfully across the stereo spectrum. Unfortunately, the game slowly unloads and reloads each track with every new session. Of course, this complaint pales against all that is right with the game. SUPERBIKE succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is that it becomes more enjoyable the longer you play and the better you get. And yes, serious racers will continue to improve as their experience, ability and knowledge increase the true mark of a topnotch sim.

"MICROSOFT GOLF 1999 EDITION  REVIEW Here on Mulligan's Isle MS GOLF 1999 EDITION Is a Great Game but Only a Slight Upgrade SPORTSZRACING by Scott A. May t seems like only yesterday that I was heaping high praise on MICROSOFT GOLF 1998 and applauding the veteran franchise for finally coming into its own. Wait a minute—that was yesterday. Well, almost. And now, a scant six months or so after the release of GOLF 98, Microsoft and Friendly Software are offering GOLF 1999 EDITION, an ever-so-slight remake of last year's model. Packed with only three new courses and a few cosmetic changes, this release is basically an upgrade. In fact, Microsoft could easily have gotten by with a downloadable patch and expansion disc. Thankfully, a $30 mail-in rebate for owners of GOLF 98 takes the sting out of paying full price for a game you more or less already have. Owners of previous MS GOLF products also qualify for a $10 rebate, which, all things considered, might be an even better deal. THIS PERFECT WORLD As with many of today's top golf sims, the graphics in MS GOLF 99 are so polished that they've become somewhat sterile and lifeless. Same Old, Still Good Highlights of returning features include excellent customization of your gaming environment, including player strength, club distance, ball size and type, pin placement, and weather conditions. Up to four players can compete in one of five game types-Stroke, Match Play, Skins, Bingo-Bango-Bongo, and Scramble. The availability of four swing modes assures that players of almost any skill level (real or imagined) can participate, from club lawyers to ball scrubbers. There are the standard dualand tri-click mouse-button modes; an automated sim swing that virtually eliminates player input (not to mention all the fun); and Natural Swing, in which backswing and ball strikes are controlled entirely by mouse movement. This last method is touchy and difficult to master, to say the least, and not performed in realtime. Stick to the traditional click-and-twitch instead. MS GOLF 99 doesn't support 3D video acceleration, but it doesn't need to. In terms of photorealism, the game element that everyone seems to clamor for the graphics here can toe the line with any competitor, using a combination of prerendered backdrops and videocaptured golfer animations. Screen redraws are zippy, with multiple views to choose from. Truth be told, as in many of today's top golf sims, the landscapes here are so buffed and polished that they're somewhat cold and lifeless, as if you're playing inside a presentation slide show. Be careful what you wish for people. Redundant features and the lack of viable improvements make MICROSOFT GOLF 1999 EDITION best suited for fans who don't already own GOLF 98.

One new ability, tactics, lets heroes move their forces within a limited range immediately prior to a battle-it's great for offense-minded heroes, letting them move ranged units into prime positions while cutting down the distance melee units have to travel.

While this lets the game tell a more interesting story, Heroism 101 To protect your more valuable units, let your weakest creatures attack tough enemies first so they absorb the counterstrike. The Al almost always focuses its attack on the largest group of units, so build up hordes of cheap cannon-fodder units to occupy enemies while your stronger armies pound on them. For inferno heroes, bait enemies with imps so that magogs can hurl fireballs without damaging more expensive units. Build marketplaces early. Almost every map is scarce in some resource (generally gold), so you'll need to convert resources early and often. Just because you start a scenario with two towns doesn't mean you need two heroes. Instead, use one town as your central production point while building up only the income-generating aspects of the second town. With one well-equipped hero you'll be able to win crucial early battles for resources that will eventually make additional heroes affordable and effective. Use your units' special abilities. For example, since cavaliers and champions get 5 percent extra damage for every hex traveled, they should always charge before an attack, even if it means just circling an enemy that's already next to them. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999 "

"IMPERIALISM II. REVIEW Imperialism with a Dash of Civ Explore a Brave New World Set in a Bold New Era STRATEGY AWA by Loyd Case lizabeth I was lucky. If it hadn't been for an errant storm and the plucky courage of Sir Francis Drake and a few bold Englishmen, we might all be speaking Spanish today. Playing IMPERIALISM II really drives this point home. Toward the end of one game, I found myself locked in a life-and-death struggle with Spanish invaders on English soil. The battle seesawed back and forth for some time, but ultimately I was ignominiously defeated. If only I'd had my own Drake. Lomon A NEW-SCHOOL OLD SCHOOL At first glance, IMPERIALISM II looks like an old-school title. But the 2D playing surface is actually fairly detailed. It's the Same, but Different As you might guess by the name, IMPERIALISM II is the succes. sor to SSI's original turn-based empire builder. The original was set in an era-roughly the 19th or 20th century-when empires had already been established in the New World, and the objective was to become the world's first real superpower. IMPERIALISM Il is set in an earlier time in which there is a completely undiscovered New World--a world with plenty of secrets to be uncovered by adventureand glory-seeking explorers. A highly engaging game, IMPERIALISM Il certainly has similarities to the original-especially in terms of interface-but there are some sig. nificant differences, too. You'll notice the first difference right off the bat: The game map is hidden when you begin play. This hidden area is the undiscovered country, and it's up to you to send out explorers, sailors, and merchants to reap riches, resources, and living space for your country. You can play on a random map or if you're historically inclined, one that reflects realistic geography. COMPUTER GAMING ***** WORLD PROS: Intelligent Al and hidden new world make for an interesting blend of IMPERIALISM and IMPERIALISM CIV II. CONS: The game is a little dry: some audio glitches. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 200, 32MB RAM, 110MB hard-drive space. 3D SUPPORT: None MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: IPX, modem (2-6 players): 1 CD per player. Price: $49.95 Publisher: SSI If We Build It, They Will Come IMPERIALISM II is a game of strategy, exploration, resource management, and combat. When you start a game, you can configure not only difficulty levels but also a host of other parameters. If you like a more building-oriented style of game, you can set that up. If you want lots of combat, no problem. The graphics are solid-looking, in a classical kind of way, but they're mostly static, with a few minor animations. One nice touch is the zoom-out mode, which resembles an old parchment map. You begin the game with three land units and three carracks (small cargo ships). As in the original game, movement is abstracted. Except when building roads or railroads, you place your units where you want them, without worrying about paths and terrain.

If you act like the Dutch did historically, you'll end up with the same results they did: You'll get pretty rich but become an also-ran in the game of power. As you uncover the New World, you'll come across a new set of minor powers, which creates an interesting choice: Do you just roll in and suppress the natives, or do you try to deal with them in a more civilized manner? (Hint: Even if you're playing in a more peaceful style, you can lock out the other powers simply by buying a piece of land in the new country. The Al can't come in after that unless they declare war on you.) The game requires you to balance two objectives. First, there's the dance between managing your new acquisitions and paying attention to your homeland. Then there's the resource ballet. The basic resources needed to feed and clothe your subjects lie mostly in your own domain, but the real wealth-generating resources, such as spices, diamonds, and gold, lie in the unexplored regions. In addition, luxuries needed to create a productive middle class, like tobacco, sugar, and furs, also lie in the New World. The difficulty is this: Just when you think you've gotten a handle on food, you find yourself running low on lumber and iron. You frantically build up those resources, only to find that you don't have enough clothing to recruit new laborers. It gets more challenging the further you get into the game, as your citizens move up the economic chain. Each new class of worker is significantly more productive but demands a new type of luxury to stay productive. It all sounds a little dry on the surface, but it's incredibly addictive.

"REVIEW  NORTH VS. SOUTH STRATEGYZWAR Un-Civil War The JULIUS CAESAR Engine Can't Handle Rifled Muskets Lost in the Wilderness A sea of blue and gray in the Virginia Woods, with a close-up of Union forces (inset). Check out the cavalry commander (and mount) stuck in the roof of the house. by Jim Cobb he first thing you need to know about NORTH VS. SOUTH (NVS) is that it uses the acclaimed GREAT BATTLES OF JULIUS CAESAR engine, which was designed to simulate ancient tactical combat. Problem is, a few things intervened between the times of Julius Caesar and Robert E. Lee-things like gunpowder, the disappearance of personal armor, and the decline of shock combat. Even so, the units of NVS resemble their ancient counterparts in their ratings for morale, strength, weapons type, range, and the like. The units take up either one or two 330-yard hexes. Each turn represents basically an hour, and in that time, units can be ordered to move, turn, wheel, and change formation (column/line, mounted/ unmounted, or limbered/unlimbered) individually or, if their commander is capable, in groups. Units take cohesion hits (à la GREAT BATTLES) whenever they move through difficult terrain or suffer damage in combat. Even tually, enough hits will rout a unit, though hits can be removed and routed units can be rallied-provided they haven't already retreated off-map. strung together, with the victor sometimes able to choose a different battle to shorten the war. Sounds great, but Nvs fails to deliver. The graphics, for example, aren't even up to the standard of the GREAT BATTLES series. Why. with the colorful assortment of kepis, butternuts, Zoauves, and other uniforms that colorfully filled the Civil War battlefield, are we subjected to a monotonous procession of blue and gray ranks? The terrain can conceal corps and division commands, causing you to waste time searching for them with the slow scrolling and touchy fly-by window. The animation for battle is unintentionally funny when the defender leaves the hex and the attackers bayonet the air, and when routed units execute neat wheels and march smartly away. It can also be frustrating when the view switches to the next commander before combat is finished. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD ***** Turn About Also as in GREAT BATTLES, command is at the heart of NVS. Commanders have command ranges and initiative ratings, which equal the number of orders they can give to units, group movements, if successful, use up that leader's allotted orders. The side whose commanders have the higher initiative ratings tends to go first and most often. The twist in NVS is that commands come from army commanders to corps com manders down to division level. The corps commanders can either spread orders between their subordinate division commanders or drive a crucial division multiple times at the risk of sustaining hits for the additional movement. NVS applies this system to 10 engagements between the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Each engagement has an historical setting and up to six \"what if\" variants. The campaign game has all 10 engagements GREAT BATTLES in that fire combat is still only preparatory to melee, despite the fact that the American Civil War demonstrated the uselessness of charges against rifle fire. Also, Civil War units didn't break and run as ancient troops did; they often took fire, fell back, and regrouped many times. Yet, in NVS, units are terminally routed after an unsuccessful rally attempt (or just at the end of a turn). So how are you supposed to recreate Antietam or Chancellorsville? The scenarios are also a letdown, with many of the important battles missing in action. The campaigns just link things together, with no carryover from one battle to another. Thus, a Northern victory at the First Bull Run still gives them only McClellan on the peninsula instead of the more likely early end of the war. In the end, NVS falls short both as a serious simulation and as a fun beer-and-pretzels wargame. With TalonSoft's Civil War series still available (see the May CGW Hall of Fame), there's no reason to waste time with this. CGW PROS: A fast-playNORTH ing brigade-level SOUTH Civil War game.

"GAMERS EDGE STRATEGY CHEATS WALKTHROUGHS SimCity 3000 MER Can't Urban Plan Your Way Out of a Paper Bag? We Can Help! by Marc Dultz IMCITY 3000 is unquestionably one of the most challenging simulations around, aptly modeling the growth of a city from its embryonic beginnings into a bustling metropolis. The first 25 years or so represent the most difficult phase of the game, because it is during this period that you must successfully lay the groundwork for your ideal city. At the outset, you must determine where to locate neighborhoods, workplaces, and industries; decide which city services you will provide to your inhabitants; and implement a plan of action that will ensure steady growth of the community. Here are some tips on accomplishing your lofty goals—without bankrupting the city coffers or turning your administration out onto the streets. In the Zone Obviously, the first item on the agenda is to decide where to set up shop. Early on, it makes sense to establish only light residential, commercial, and industrial zones instead of medium or densely populated zones, since these are cheaper to create. While you can cram more people into a medium or densely populated zone, these areas also take far longer to fully occupy and have far lower land values. Plan on placing your industrial parks somewhere along the edge of the map, preferably close to your power plants and far enough away from your residential and commercial districts so that they don't lower land value. Residential zones should be created near waterways, lakes, or atop hills, because these types of terrain will generally have a positive effect on their land value. Commercial zones should be placed nearby, with schools, fire departments, police stations, and hospitals in close proximity. Once your residential, commercial, and industrial zones have been created, your next task is to provide both water and power to them. Start out by placing a pumping station near a body of fresh water (preferably along a river or on the shore of a lake), then construct a water main that leads from your pumping station to each of your newly formed zones. Pipes can be spaced at least seven tiles apart and still provide plenty of water to each of your zones. If it still appears as if some zones aren't receiving their fair share of water, you may want to construct a few water towers nearby or perhaps connect one of your water mains to a neighboring community so that you can pump in additional water. Unlike SIMCITY 2000, you need not erect power lines all over the map in order to keep the juice flowing. In fact, most buildings will draw power from distant power plants if the buildings are simply situated near another fully powered zone.

"Let's Make a Deal Have Smoke, Will Travel During the early stages of the game, pollution is by far one of your most pressing concerns. Pollution generally comes in three forms—air, ground, and water. Depending upon where it occurs, pollution can lower the value of land, retard growth of the city, and turn away city dwellers by the droves. Engineer's Repor: Do you want to make a connection to your neighbor for $2,5007 City Planner First Clean Industry Develops Congratulationstrve just received wordthal an toch research has moved into town.

Slowly Converting to clear Inchistries should mako New City a cer place to live. From time to time, your neighbors will propose all sorts of deals to you, such as purchasing excess power and importing garbage. If you're in dire straits, they may even offer to pump in potable water, albeit at an exorbitant cost.

"SIMCITY 3000 Riding the Rails GAMERS EDG DNDO 930 In addition to a decent neighborhood, your sims require a viable transportation system so that they can travel from one destination to another. While some sims don't mind walking to the corner Quickie Mart every so often, most would rather drive or ride the rails than hoof it, since this will appreciably cut down their travel time. Resist the urge to build an extensive network of roads, since this will only lead to higher maintenance costs and greater traffic congestion. Instead, create an above-ground rail system that parallels your most frequently traveled routes and intersects at key junctures. Place train stations at regular intervals alongside the tracks, locating them within walking range of each major residential, commercial, and industrial zone. Make sure to leave ample room for the rail system to expand, so that it can efficiently and effectively meet the demands of your citizens. It's also a good idea to connect your rail system to as many neighbors as possible since this will enable more sims to quickly move into your community Later on, as land values rise and new modes of transport become available, it may be wise to build an underground subway system that mirrors your rail system. When subway ridership increases, you can then think about tearing up the aboveground rail system and replacing it with a network of roads capable of supporting bus traffic. Be sure to place bus stops at random intervals, as close as possible to any subway stations. Knowledge Is Power popunion Date: Mos Our OW Prati 19 Early on, the only power sources available are coal and oil-based power plants. Although coal plants are cheaper to purchase and operate and produce slightly more power, they emit far more pollutants than oil plants. So, unless your city desperately needs power, stick with oil, at least until gaspowered plants come online. Like landfill sites, power plants should be situated in the corners of the map or along its outer edges so that their pollutants \"drift\" off the map instead of into your community. At the map edges, power plants will also be ideally situated to supply unused power to nearby communities. Finally, it should be pointed out that power plants start to decline with age, operating at less than peak efficiency as the years pass by. If they do break down, power plants spew even more waste into the surrounding region, which can lead to all sorts of problems. Every so often, it would be wise to check on the condition of your power plants, replacing decrepit plants with newer power sources. 184 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"SIMCITY 3000 Whose Trash Is This Anyway? GLAME thuh1 Neng Unless you are prepared to export garbage to a neighboring community (not a good idea considering the cost) the next most logical recourse is to create a landfill, placing it in a corner of the map where it won't affect your main urban center. Landfills are some of the worst polluters, and left unchecked, can become serious blights on the urban landscape. In terms of zoning costs, landfills are also fairly expensive, so keep your initial site small and well out of range of the nearest inhabitants. Try to allocate a large enough tract of land to accommodate any future site expansion, making sure to leave some space vacant for an incinerator when it becomes available.

Neighboring communities will routinely offer to export their garbage into your community, paying a fairly handsome fee to rid themselves of their unwanted waste. So, while importing garbage may seem like a fairly unattractive option, the extra income will prove handy when expenditures outstrip revenues. Later on, as your bottom line improves, you can always rescind those heartless waste management contracts.

TOKA Action Accept Deal Reject Deal pac Aristys Break the Bank 333 If your city is in dire need of funding, or if an attractive opportunity presents itself, it makes good sense for you to turn to the banks for a low-interest loan. Since you can have only 10 outstanding loans at any one time, it's wise to borrow the maximum amount allowable ($25,000), although it'll cost you something on the order of $30,000 to pay it back in full. Loans should be used as an immediate stopgap measure or to finance key projects such as the construction of a backup power plant or water tower, and should never be used to pay off other outstanding loans. It's easy to get into a situation in which you have multiple outstanding loans and no hope of ever digging out from under all that red ink. While the advent of clean industry will lower pollution levels much later in the game, the planting of trees and the establishment of parks will have a much more immediate effect and will help to reduce emission levels throughout your city. Remember that even Rome wasn't built in a day.

With MYTH Il's fast-paced multiplayer options, victory depends on your ability to make quick tactical decisions, utilize fine-tuned skills, and employ surefire strategies. The Importance of Strategy starts with unit trading. One consideration is mix of units: Choosing the best combination of troops for your army is a factor of paramount importance for victory. Another is the game type and map being played: Choose units best suited for specific games and maps. Units in MYTH II fall into four nucleus of your army. Melee units have three functions: Support missile and special units, defend a flag or ball, and strike the enemy when an old-fashioned infantry assault is needed.

"MELEE GAMES Body Count in this most popular of MYTH's multiplayer games, the player or team with the most kills and/or total damage wins.

Stampede You must successfully guide your herd of pigs to the center of the map for teleportation (some game types provide the enemy flag as the teleportation point). The winner is the player or team herding the most pigs off the map. In this game, quickly split your force into two groups, the first consisting of recon, missile, and melee units, the second, of slow-moving melee and special units. Charge your first group to the teleportation point so you can keep other players from herding their pigs to safety. This also gives you an opportunity to secure the teleportation point. At the same time, use your second group to quickly herd your pigs toward the point. The first players to herd their pigs to the center usually meet with little resistance. Remember to protect your pigs while killing as many of the opponents' pigs as possible.

"EDGE Close Combat III: The Russian Front Battle Tactics for the War in the East GAMER by Marc Dultz panning nearly four years, Germany's Russlandkrieg, or War in Russia, proved to be one of the longest and most ferocious military campaigns of the Second World War, locking two powerful armies in a life-or-death struggle to determine the fate of Europe. In CLOSE COMBAT III, you get a sense of what it was like to soldier on the war's inhospitable eastern frontier, dashing across the vast open steppes of the Ukraine one moment, only to inch your way through the thick defensive belts surrounding Moscow and Stalingrad the next. See the Review It's easy to fall into the trap of MAY ISSUE. 3.5 STARS using the same cadre of units and a similar set of battle tactics for every conceivable circumstance, rarely taking into account the enormity of the situation or the disparate forces under each side's command. Such a formulaic approach avails you little in the campaign's more formidable scenarios. To succeed, then, you must draw up a sound contingency plan for every type of engagement: a plan of action that will marry the right mix of forces with the correct battle tactics to produce the best possible results. What follows then are some general guidelines and techniques for the conduct of offensive military operations in CLOSE COMBAT III, all drawn from the Wehrmacht's experience in the Russian campaign. Bear in mind that certain factors, such as troop strength, terrain, weather, and the disposition of the opposing forces, will have to be weighed and carefully considered before a definitive plan of action can be put into effect. thereby giving them the best vantage point to survey the surrounding countryside. Armored Attacks rmored forces (tanks, assault guns, half-tracks, and other mechanized units) play a much more vital role in CLOSE COMBAT III than in previous installments of the series. In many instances they are forced to shoulder the brunt of the fighting. Armored forces are typically employed to maintain the momentum of the attack, are often called upon to rupture a defensive line, and, when the case warrants, are charged with destroying enemy armored concentrations on the battlefield. During the war, panzer commanders deployed their mobile reconnaissance units well ahead of the armored advance in order to establish the proximity of the nearest enemy forces, fixing their positions, numbers, and composition in preparation for the main assault. Typically, motorcycles, fast-moving armored cars, or half-tracks were employed in this role, with two vehicles working in tandem to ascertain the enemy's whereabouts. Ordinarily one vehicle would move as swiftly as possible from one area of concealment to the next while the second stood off a few hundred yards to the rear, ready to provide covering fire in case the first vehicle came under attack. If the lead vehicle happened to be destroyed, the second vehicle would withdraw in earnest, then assist with the screening of the main assault or in locating any nearby enemy armored units. Whenever possible, reconnaissance units would attempt to occupy the highest ground, such as a ridge line or a hill, Once the composition and disposition of the enemy's forces had been established, the main armored force would assume a battle formation. Typically, light and medium panzers would spearhead the attack, with the trailing elements-mechanized units, assault guns, towed as well as self-propelled artillery, and trucks-forming the second and third waves of the assault group. The battalion commander, usually leading the assault at the head of the second wave, would determine each phase of the attack, based upon the outcome of the initial meeting engagement, the progress of the lead elements as they passed through the defensive line, and the overall mission goals. The vanguard, supported by artillery fire and field pieces, would either push on into the enemy's rear areas or would be ordered to encircle then annihilate the enemy in a bold pincer movement. 190 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"River Crossing Operations WANIERSEDIGE n many respects, the seizure of a river crossing shares certain similarities with the attack on a fortified line. A specialized assault team must be created from several different types of units, a battle group that will usually consist of field artillery, armored cars, mortars, machine-gun teams, tanks, and both light and heavy infantry. Typically, the enemy will attempt to defend a river crossing by withdrawing his forces over the bridge to guard the more defensible span. Since landing craft and other troop-ferrying equipment aren't available in the game, the attacker must somehow attempt to get his forces across the bridge in the most expeditious manner possible and then establish a defensible lodgment. Again, speed, artillery, smoke, and overwhelming firepower are critical to the operation. concealed terrain, from which they can swiftly move out and onto the bridge. Once everyone is in position, mortar teams should fire smoke canisters along the opposite riverbank, usually near the entrance to the bridge. Once the smoke screen thickens, machine-gun teams should immediately begin to Units assigned to the second wave of the assault were charged with protecting the armored forces should any enemy armor appear on the battlefield. Towed antitank teams and heavily armored assault guns were deployed along either flank of the attack, ready to turn back local armored counterattacks. If infantry or antitank teams were harassing the lead elements, mechanized infantry units would immediately dismount from their vehicles and engage these units, forcing them to ground until the armor could destroy them. Generally, units in the second wave were used to mop up any remaining enemy resistance that the armor had bypassed. However, as the conflict dragged on, and newer, much more lethal tank destroyers were introduced by the Red Army, units in the second wave were oftentimes held in reserve for extended periods of time, until the armor could outflank and eliminate these threats. Prior to and even during the opening stages of the assault a short yet intense rolling artillery barrage would be launched, targeted at both known and suspected antitank gun sites as well as mortar and artillery positions. When the attack commenced, friendly artillery batteries and mortar teams would fire smoke ahead of the armored units, screening their advance as they crossed the open ground. Meanwhile, field guns were usually sited along tree lines or on hilltops ready to provide standoff fire should the armored forces require further assistance. Once the enemy's Prior to battle, reconnaissance units should immediately occupy any high ground that overlooks the river crossing. The recon teams, acting as artillery observers, will then be able to call in accurate artillery fire against any observable troop concentrations within the immediate area. Tanks and field artillery should also take up positions atop ridges, inside tree lines, or behind buildings, so that they too can support the attack. Finally, light and heavy infantry squads should be placed as close as possible to the bridge, preferably in rake the opposite embankment, keeping the defenders busy while the assault troops press forward. At this point in the battle, an armored car or half-track can speed down the road and over the bridge, stirring up as much havoc as possible on the opposite riverbank. Next, two teams of light infantry race across the bridge, then take up defensive positions on either side of the bridge. Finally, tanks and heavy infantry squads storm the bridge, fanning out in all directions once they reach the opposite riverbank, quickly eliminating any enemy forces still operating near the bridgehead. antitank guns had been silenced, some of the armored units and field artillery would direct their fire against any enemy machine-gun teams or rifle squads in the area, so that dismounted infantry could approach, engage, and destroy these holdouts. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JUNE 1999 197 "

"Urban Combat GAMERS EDG uring the war, armored forces were usually withheld from the opening phase of an urban assault because they were extremely vulnerable to closequarter fighting. Antitank teams occupying the upper floors of a multistory building were ideally situated, able to fire down at an approaching vehicle's top, where its armor was the thinnest. Moreover, specially formed tank-hunting units were trained to infiltrate sections of town already lost to the attacker, then fire at a tank from behind. As a result, infantry units were generally used to spearhead the main assault, with tanks and other fighting vehicles accompanying the second wave to bolster the attack. Armored units were used to smash barricades and act as mobile artillery, supporting the infantry units as they cleared out each section of town. When maneuvering, the Germans would attempt to avoid the streets as much as possible, infiltrating the enemy's positions via backyards, over roofs, and through sewers. Tall multistory buildings were always seized first because these dominating positions provided the men with key observation points from which to survey nearby streets and the widest field of fire should the enemy attempt to redeploy. When a section of town was finally surrounded, every exit and side street was quickly blocked to prevent the defenders from escaping. Mop-up detachments would then proceed house by house, clearing any remaining resistance while machine-gun teams and other units stood off to provide suppression fire. positions just beyond the town limits. The idea here was to block the defenders' retreat route if they attempted to withdraw. The ultimate objective in urban combat was to divide the defending forces, then isolate them from each other, denying them any freedom of movement and reducing their overall cohesiveness. Assault troops were divided up into several columns, which would then make a series of coordinated attacks following parallel routes. Each column would be further subdivided into an assault group and a mop-up detachment, which were typically composed of reconnaissance troops, engineers, and various infantry squads. German forces tended to employ flanking or encircling tactics to bypass a major strongpoint, preferring to reduce them with withering artillery fire rather than attack directly. In some instances, armored cars and half-tracks would speed through a village in order to take up Panzers Vorwarts! offered each tank a good field of fire and typically didn't expose the lead vehicle to as much enemy fire as the wedge formation. However, because the command vehicle was located at the rear of the forThe wedge, or \"arrowhead,\" formation was most frequently adopted because it provided the platoon commander with the greatest degree of flexibility during the attack. Each tank in the platoon was responsible for watching a specific arc, ensuring that at least one set of eyes was covering each sector of the front. Unfortunately, the wedge formation wasn't always the ideal formation. Tanks on one side of the wedge were generally unable to engage any enemy units located on the opposite side for fear of hitting their own vehicles. What's more, the platoon commander rode in the lead tank, which was usually the first vehicle to come under attack. The line abreast formation was generally used when the platoon commander wanted to place fire on targets located in front of the formation. Unfortunately, the line abreast formation restricted each vehicle's line of fire, leaving them susceptible to flanking fire. Usually, this formation was adopted on the defense, where intervening terrain and other units could be used to protect each flank. CGW mation, the other tank commanders were unable to observe what the command tank was doing. The echelon formation allowed the platoon commander to place the greatest volume of fire on either side of the formation. While each vehicle had a clear line of sight, the lead vehicle was exposed, oftentimes drawing the most enemy fire.

"A Real Grim Fandango Such a Long, Long Time to Be Gone, and a Short Time to Be There do it. For a while, I tried focusing and writing about my hopeless addiction to HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC III. It was kind of funny, until I wrote something about needing an IV line and a bucket under my chair to take care of my bodily functions while I played. Then I thought about Suzy, and that line lost all its humor. Death-that heartless t takes a lot to shut up a smart-alecky loudmouth like myself, but this month I finally met my match. Yep, life's all fun and games here at Computer Gaming World (except for those annoying couple of days each month when we have to make this magazine), but this month reality gave me a Tysonsized upper-cut, cold and hard, right in the kisser. And boy, I'd give anything to be able to write about anything else right now. One minute I'm at the Game Developer's Conference in San Jose, attending sessions like \"Are Adventure Games Dead?\" (short answer: yes), and the next minute I find myself driving home at midnight in the rain, furiously hoping to beat the clock so I could say goodbye to my cousin Suzy—36 years old and dying of ovarian cancerone last time. I didn't make it. In the face of such inexplica ble, horrifying, incomprehensible news, how does one write a dumb column about computer games? Good question. I can't stubbornly optimistic hippie Deadhead of a cousin-would have hated that idea. In her 36 brief years, Suzy never had the time to get maudlin like that. There was too much fun to be had. Not that she didn't work hard too; this is someone who actually chose, without someone holding a gun to her head, to teach social studies to the evil alien beings known as \"7th graders.\" But she never lost sight of her main goal: Have as much fun as possible, all the time. It's a good thing to remember. Actually, it's just good to remember that it's okay to want to have fun. Playing computer games, for example. This is a fun thing to do. We don't have to pretend that it's anything else, right? I hear people trying to jusJust yesterday, for example, learned that it's way easier to beat someone over the head with a crowbar in HALF-LIFE than it is to keep reloading and firing the pistol. So I take it back. Games are very educational. I . My point is this: Don't let anyone shame you into thinking that playing computer games is a waste of time. Because whatever they're doing to pass the time is no better--and it certainly isn't going to make them any less dead in the end. By all means, turn your computer off at least part of the day. Do your best to be a useful and responsible member of society, too. Plant a tree. Volunteer at a shelter. Help lon Storm finish DAIKATANA. Just don't forget JEFF GREEN I hear people trying to justify their gaming habit all the time, but I'm here to tell you-don't even bother. son of a bitch--just sucks all the humor out of everything, III Or maybe not. Suzy—my irrepressibly. tify their gaming habit all the time, but I'm here to tell you don't even bother. You don't need to say, \"It's better than TV.\" That's only partially true, anyway, but, more to the point, why should anything have to be better than TV? Life is hard enough We're allowed to rest, we're allowed to goof off. Yeah, yeah, some games can manage to be educational, too, but save that for your parents or spouse. That's not why I play them, and I bet that's not why you play them either. Well, let me qualify that. Some gaming education is very important to me. that when old Manny Calavera comes knocking at your door holding the big, black \"Game Over\" sign, you're not going to find a Restart button anywhere in your inventory. So long, Suzy. Say hi to Jerry for me. Me, I've got some HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC III to play. CGW With Fans Like These... I've been reading your magazine for about seven years and it seems to tell the truth about a game. But the back page with Jeff Green seems to talk about nothing. I would, and perhaps a lot of other people would as well, like to read about the business and stock of some of the gaming companies out there. Who's getting rich and who's going out of business with perhaps some following about the companies--their stock prices and some news on software companies' IPOs, etc. Surely it would give some insight on why games sell and why games are shipped early. It can't be any more boring than Jeff. (Sorry Jeff.) It would be nice to read about who owns what in the business world. Surely one page is not too much -Ron Pierce via the Internet Jeff Responds: If you think I'm boring, you should read Denny Atkin's column. What Jeff doesn't realize is that Jerry Garcia currently holds the high score on the Ms. Pac Man machine in Heaven.
