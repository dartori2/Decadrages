"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD from as many software publishers as possible. The more packages that appear on shelves with RSAC labels during the holiday buying season, the more consumers will learn about the ratings system through the comparison of similar products. As consumers become more and more familiar with the system, we believe they will become more and more confident about its value. An inadequate number of labels on the shelves during the holiday season could provide an excuse for further governmental interference. If a voluntary system doesn't work, the government will step in. WHAT IS CGW'S POSITION? Computer Gaming World will begin publishing the RSAC icons and descriptors in the reviews of rated games as they appear. We believe that this is useful information for our readers and hope that it will encourage compliance with the RSAC approach from all game publishers. We realize that this is likely to be an unattainable ideal, but we urge all game publishers to consider the RSAC ratings approach. The beauty of the RSAC system is that it is non-judgmental. Many of our readers have expressed concern during the yearlong ratings controversy, which followed the Senate subcommittee hearings held prior to last Christmas, that the imposition of ratings will prompt software publishers to precensor their products and reduce the amount of human interaction or expression which could be portrayed in computer games. To that, we suggest that all ratings systems tend to gravitate to an undistributed middle. For example, the bulk of movies are PG, PG-13 and R because those are the films that most people attend. Unless a film has something extra, a G rating or X rating, even an NC-17 rating hurts it. The RSAC ratings may suffer some from this tendency, but they feel this is less restrictive than other approaches, particularly those approaches that might come out of Capitol Hill.

The Guide To CGW's Review Rating System * Outstanding: That rare game that gets it all right. The graphics, sound, interface, and, of course, the game play come together to form a Transcendent Gaming Experience. **** Very Good: A quality game that succeeds in many areas. May have minor problems, but is still worth your time and money, especially if you're interested in the subject matter/genre. *** Average: A mixed bag. Can often be a game that reaches for the stars, but falls short in significant areas. Can also just be a game that does what it does well, but lacks flair or originality. ** Weak: A game with serious problems. May be buggy, may not have much play value, may be ill-conceived—and you may want to think twice about buying it. Abysmal: That rare game that gets it all wrong. Usually a buggy, incomplete, and/or valueless product. 16 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1994 "

"Tomahawks Over England's Intelligent Games, and features the design talents of Matthew Stibbe, noted for IMPERIUM, among other strategy and simulation games. Nonetheless, the maritime history of the British means little in the annals of computer naval simulations. Since the 8-bit days of computing, few floating sims have really captured the imagination of gamers as successfully as their more celebrated airborne brethren. Although AEGIS: GUARDIAN OF THE FLEET set a course to become the FALCON of the high seas, it was hindered by poor documentation and disturbing crash bugs. USS TICONDEROGA: DEFENDER OF LIBERTY is an attempt to surmount waves where others have floundered, as Mindscape banks that the mighty cruiser, with its high-tech weaponry, will capture the interest of simulation die-hards and wargame enthusiasts alike. The Ticonderoga is impressive, with a towering superstructure that would seem to make the ship top-heavy. The graphics in USS TICONDEROGA do an even better job than Aegis of capturing the density of the on-deck equipment, in particular the huge radar arrays, a primary part of the Aegis defense system carried by the Ticonderoga cruiser. The familiar Harpoon launchers and the hatches that hide deadly Tomahawk cruise missiles are easy to spot, and nicely rendered. As good as the exterior graphics are, they fail to prepare gamers for what awaits them inside the ship. A Silicon Graphics-rendered wonderland will seduce even the most jaded of naval aficionados. Surprisingly, unlike many recent graphic extravaganzas, TICONDEROGA's visuals offer more than mere eye-candy. Each screen has a number of interface hot spots that perform critical by Terry Lee Coleman game functions or bring up needed information.

"feeling of actually being on the ship. In addition to seeing the 3D Studio-sculpted walls, you will hear digitized footsteps as you move down the hallways, with the footfalls actually sounding different when going up or down stairs. Most areas on the ship are appropriately cramped, while the captain's cabin allows you the luxury of a bit more room. The lighting adds a more subtle touch, with the Helm brightly lit, and the CIC area suffused with blue and red lighting. It's obvious that the design team spent some quality time aboard a real Ticonderoga cruiser.

Mahan, PLATOON and recent releases such as ARThe Interest of America in Sea Power (1897] TOUR OF COMMAND CENTRAL The expansive bridge view lets you either look at the big picture, or simply access the variety of detailed tactical views (inset). USS TICONDEROGA puts a lot of power at your fingertips, not the least of which are the immense detection capabilities of the cruiser, which allow you to quickly pinpoint enemy vessels from afar. In addition to the main battle perspective (using standard naval symbols, much like Harpoon II), there are separate views for surface, submarine and air contacts, as well as a different sensor screen. Finally, there is a screen that gives the traditional 360-degree radar view. All of these can be accessed quickly from hot keys, and each has switches to be toggled for weapons launch. Should you be at the submarine contact screen, for instance, you would fire ASROC anti-sub missiles. Against enemy surface ships, you would be given a choice of launching a Harpoon or Tomahawk, and so forth. Even though there is a lot of data-crunching going on, Ticonderoga shows the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon system, without ever burying the player under an avalanche of statistics. Maximum ranges are delineated by onscreen circles; if you wait too long to fire a weapon, you are informed that the target is out of range-or worse, within minimum range. TICONDEROGA is a real-time simulation, but features time compression up to 256 times normal speed. Rather than the frenzied joystick maneuvers of a light or racing simulation, you find yourself pushing buttons, and sometimes frantically clicking a mouse to deal with incoming threats.

"Holiday Buyer's Cuide SAN FRANCISCOS Front Page Sports Baseball (Dynamix) If your appetite for baseball wasn't quite sated by Ken Burns' epic PBS mini-series, the folks at Dynamix offer a real run around the bases with this product. All the care that made FPS FOOTBALL such a success is evident here, with the addition of new player animation. Given new graphic life through rotoscoping, players dive to scoop line drives out of the dirt, leap to catch fly balls, and generally look more like real baseball players than any computer sprites have a right to. Unlike many action-oriented baseball games, the boys in FPS BASEBALL can actually play defense, too. Statistically, the game is fairly sound and conforms nicely to the player ratings, particularly those that measure the effect of pressure in the late innings, although there are a number of bugs in the initial release. The comprehensive design includes trades, injuries and a host of replay options, although the latter takes some time to complete. Great for two-players, and sporting a good AI manager, this might take a lot of the bite out of the baseball strike this holiday season. See the full review in CGW #124. IBM, $54.95 allows fans to pit their favorite stars against each other using their real names. VCR replay functions and camera angles are enhanced, showcasing the new rotoscoped animation, a by-product of the work done on FPS BASEBALL. All the '94 season NFL rules are implemented, including the 2point conversion, with new rules for blocking field goals. Now texture-mapped, the football field includes actual team logos in the end zones. Defenses are more sophistiFLORIDA cated, with more specific man-to-man pass Hardball 4 coverage, and a \"read\" option included. Blocking techniques now simulate screens, draws and sweeps better by a \"block/next\" screen, as well as high-resolution graphfunction. Player editing is much simpler, ics. The character sprites in the version and now includes user-defined algorithms we saw were nice and big, and the game for rating individuals by position, plus a was fluidly animated. The pitcher-batter interface still remains among the best in the market. HARDBALL III users will be pleasantly surprised with the increase in statistical power, although number junkies will still want more. While lacking some of the features that make FRONT PAGE SPORTS BASEBALL special, HARDBALL 4 should more than meet the expectations of actionoriented baseball fans this Christmas.

"Holiday Buyer's Guide to come from everywhere. It really messes with your head. While NuReality has a line of SRS related products, the VIVID 3D PRO comes the closest to the high end Hughes AKA-100 SRS module and is very well suited for computer games. $149.95 Relying on geographical clues as well as descriptions of the perpetrators, it's up to you to stop the crime and apprehend the treacherous villain. In addition to providing a host of geographical facts, the game offers as much culture as the typical pre-teen can hope to absorb. This noble task is made easier on these enhanced CD-ROM versions, due to the larger number of digitized photos and audio. The Music of the World CD is particularly cool, and the USA adventures feature regional accents. These Carmen titles are much richer than the floppy versions, and a good reminder that the best teaching tools are those that truly entertain rather than force-feed information. IBM, Mac, $89.99 386 to 486 Clock Doubled Upgrade Processor (Cyrix) This chip from Cyrix really delivers on its promise. The do-it-yourself kit comes with a chip pulling tool, a heat sink, and enough documentation and software utilities to get you upgraded in no time. There are upgrades for 3865X16 through 386DX33 CPUs. We installed the Cx486DRx2-386/486 (easy enough name to remember) model on two separate 386DX-33 rigs and they worked flawlessly, with no crashes. There is also a software-enabled IKB cache which adds even more speed, although it might cause problems with some games. The bottom line is that old, slow 386DX-33 rigs now work at least as fast as 486DX-25 machines. Not quite the blazing performance DEWO HARDWARE lost in the original recordings. The end result is extra life for your games. So, you thought your killer wavetable sound card, speakers and subwoofer meant that you were experiencing the epitome of multimedia? We tested the Vivio 3D Pro and found ourselves ducking: sound seemed It showS NO MERC YST-MSW10 Powered Subwoofer (Yamaha) Nothing quite rounds off the gaming experience like a subwoofer. The YSTMSWIO Powered Subwoofer is a 6.5\", 25-watt fire-breathing monster. It sits there innocently enough, with three switches: power, volume, and a button to cut the higher frequencies out. When invoked, however, this thing really puts the \"Ooo\" in \"Ooomph!\" Sitting on the desk or on the floor, the YST-MSW10 can really belt out the lows down to 35Hz. If you're using those cheesy multimedia kit speakers, wait until you fire this baby up. We tested the unit while playing DOOM, and the thumping soundtrack rocked our world (and the rest of the office). Kicking in the afterburner in a combat Night sim will take your breath away. We can think of no single upgrade to your system which will have as much impact, but make sure you upgrade to wavetable synthesis first. $199.99 Vivid 3D Pro (Nu Reality) This little multimedia monolith really packs an aural punch. Using SRS technology originally developed at Hughes, it processes sound and creates a 180-degree sound field around you.

Installation isn't so bad, as all you have to do is run a cable from the line-out on the REEL MAGIC LIGHT into the line-in of your existing sound card. Just tweak the software, and you're good to go.

Even with a 430 MB hard drive, you will find yourself filling it up rather quickly if you are an avid gamer or if you plan to use the machine for Windows. While there is a good selection of hard disk compression programs out there, consider this as a last resort since only a minority of the games are fully tested to work flawlessly with DOUBLESPACE or STACKER.

The numbers represent the speed (in MHz) that a 286 processor would have to operate at to achieve the same performance as this system. To give you some real numbers to mull over, CGW put two Pentium 90 MHz systems to the test. We looked at DOS VGA graphics performance, hard drive performance and raw processor speed. Note that these systems, while both Pentium 90 MHz machines, are deliberately outfitted with different components to illustrate some of the factors to consider when making your next purchase.

With \"seek times,\" the lower the number the better the performance. Throughput is a measure of how much data a hard drive can deliver per second. These test results show three things. First, that both Pentium 90 systems blow the doors off a blazing-fast 486-66 (which, by the way, was decked out with 16 MB of RAM and a VESA local bus video card). Second, the FALCON performed slightly better in both video performance and raw processor power. The raw processor power advantage, while slight, can be attributed to design differences in the motherboard. The video advantage shows that the VESA DIAMOND STEALTH card (with 2 MB, remember) performs better than the PCI DIAMOND SPEEDSTAR. The DIAMOND STEALTH card, in either VESA or PCI versions, is quite simply one of the fastest video cards you can buy. Finally, the major speed differences in the hard drive access rate is due to the larger hard drive size on the FALCON MACH VP (remember, a larger drive has faster access rates). The difference in throughput is due to the fact that the FALCON SYStem uses a local bus hard drive controller and the new EIDE standard.

THANKS FOR THE MEMORY Your system's RAM (Random Access Memory) is the pasture for your programs to frolic within, and you most certainly need a healthy plot. Consider 8 MB as a minimum level of RAM, with 16 MB as the maximum. If you add more than 16 MB of RAM, you might run into some potential addressing problems. For now, 16 MBs will be more than you'll need for any top-flight game program. In fact, unless you play a lot of games that run in \"protected mode\" (such as DOOM II), the games won't access anything beyond 8 MB of RAM. In the coming months, more and more games will be released with a DOS extender that gives the programs free reign over multimegabytes :: CD-ROM IN A DAY CD-ROM is evolving into the delivery medium of choice, and it makes sense. For FALCON NORTHWEST MACH VP90 a consumer, getting one CD-ROM disk instead of a dozen floppies makes life that much easier.

"The Ultimate Video Card It's In The Chips They Come In Many Flavors. Which Have The Crunch? DIAMOND MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS, INC. Stealth Pro/Stealth Pro ISA These cards are based on the S3 86C928. The DOS performance of the VLB version is on a par with the other 928 card in the roundup, the NUMBER NINE GXE. Windows performance was a little better, though, indicating Diamond does a better job of writing Windows drivers. These cards were a little more finicky to install (particularly the Windows drivers), but once installation was out of the way, they ran quite well. For some reason, these cards still have a relatively high street price, and there are better performers out there for the money. GENOA SYSTEMS, INC. Phantom 64 This card is based on the S3 Vision864 chip. S3 has been shipping two 64-bit graphics accelerators, the 864 and the 964. The 864 uses DRAMs and supports up to 2 MBs. The card was very easy to install and get running. DOS benchmarks were on par with other 864-based cards, and Windows benchmarks were similar to all other 864 cards except the DIAMOND STEALTH 64 DRAM. This was one of the few cards to come with an uninstall utility-handy if you're a reviewer, and very handy if you ever need to change video cards.

Because of this, the card has stable drivers and hardware (it's certainly more stable than its big brother, the GXE64 Pro). DOS benchmarks were nearly identical with other 864 cards. Windows benchmarks were on a par with other 864 cards, except for the DIAMOND STEALTH 64 DRAM. The HAWKEYE setup program contains an integrated set of utilities to manage card features, and is very solid.

It's based on the S3 Vision 964 chip, which uses VRAM (Video RAM, special memory tuned for graphics). Unfortunately, it has a few rough spots. Compatibility with MiCROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 5.0 is questionable. The test card could not run FS5.0 in SVGA mode, either using the S3 driver or the VESA driver. A quick check of the on-line services revealed similar problems with FS5.0; however, some users could run it if they reset the refresh rate. It's possible that Number Nine has revised the BIOS on the card, which could account for the differences. The Windows drivers had problems, too. Although they were stable, a number of advertised features were not delivered, even after several driver revisions. We suggest taking a \"wait-and-see\" stance on this card. DOS benchmarks (except for FS 5.0) were solid, although the Windows benchmarks were quite a bit slower than the other 964 card, the STEALTH 64. DIAMOND MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS, INC.

"The Ultimate Video Card cost, but with some of the other cards, such as the STEALTH 64 DRAM and NUMBER NINE GXE64 approaching a $200 street price, these cards do not offer great value. One note: we never could get the PCI version to run Windows on our Intel testbed. Into The Third Dimension The Future Of Video Cards DIAMOND MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS, INC. Speedstar 64 The SPEEDSTAR 64 is another low-priced 64-bit card based on the GD 5434 chip. We tested the ISA version. Despite it being advertised as a 64-bit card, the performance was nearly identical with the ISA version of the SPEEDSTAR PRO, which is based on the 32-bit GD5426 chipset. Since other cards are faster, and the SPEEDSTAR Pro is cheaper, we're not sure why anyone would buy this card. MATROX MGA SERIES Matrox was the first vendor to ship 64-bit video cards, the MGA series, over a year before other chip vendors.

Additionally, the ULTIMA/2 does not have a 65,000 color mode, which is essential for running future MPC level 2 software. If you stay mostly in Windows, there are some neat productivity features, such as on-thefly resolution switching and a proprietary dithering algorithm that enables 24-bit images to display with very high visual fidelity when the card is in 256-color mode.

"The Ultimate Sound Card Speakers: The Weakest Link Whenever I give advice to friends who are buying audio systems, I tell them to put half their budget for the system into speakers. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and sound is only as good as the weakest component in the sound system. If you pay top dollar for a sound card, then it only makes sense that you would pay for quality speakers. Unfortunately, a lot of multimedia upgrade kits are sold with speakers that would cost a whopping $20 if sold at list price. On top of that, the shelves of stores are filled with speakers that cost as little as $8.00 for a pair! Using a pair of these speakers with the sound cards in this roundup is like plugging a fire hose into a lawn sprinkler. I've been hard pressed at times to distinguish crude FM synthesis from a Roland SCC-1 when they've been piped through some of these cheap speakers. driver if you're running a game that uses a In our game tests, all the games played DOS extender?\" Well, the TSR doesn't fine.

The long-standing favorite among the multimedia crowd has been the AR 570 Powered Partners, mustering 35 watts per channel. These babies will run you nearly $300 on the street, but they sound clean and sweet. Recently, Bose has started shipping a subwooferequipped system, at a street price approaching $600. Of course, for $600, you can buy a 40 watt per channel stereo receiver and a pair of very nice speakers, which may be the best solution if you've got the room...and the dough. 140 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"This one you won't want to miss. It's been nearly three years in the making with a budget we won't even talk about. It employed a team of over a hundred people, including programmers, artists, musicians and writers as well as Hollywood make-up and special effects houses (we liked the flames in Backdraft so we hired the movie's special effects house to bring in a little heat). As the creators of Wasteland\" and The Bard's Tale our goal was to produce a game every bit as innovative and unique. We think you'll like the results. Art and Stuff Graphically, the game is state-ofthe-art stunning (we're a little biased but check out the screenshots for yourself). We used a combination of live actors and computer generated creatures with Silicon Graphics environments and magical effects which were painstakingly rendered down to the finest crack, doorway and magical lightning storm. The Box, the Book and Story The packaging is every bit as cool as the game. Shipping in a special tombstone-shaped, hologram box the package starts you on your quest \"through dark corridors, treacherous sewers and subterranean realms of faeries, magick and the living dead.\" (We had to throw a bit of marketing hype in here somewhere.) Along with the skeleton hologram cover, you also get a limited edition, hard-bound Stonekeep novella by Steve Jackson and David Pulver. The Game's the Thing A combination of traditional role playing and interactive storytelling, Stonekeep mixes a detailed storyline and character interaction with puzzle-solving, magic systems, character attributes and combat. It all comes together in a system that allows for quality storytelling combined with a powerful, yet easy-to-use control system (intuitive without being watered down). N a \"By Gamers. For Gamers.\"\" is Interplay's slogan and Stonekeep is the kind of game we've always wanted to play It looks cool, sounds great and tells a good story. It's one of those games you'll stay up playing until three in the morning on a work night. Basically, it's just a lot of fun. A CD-ROM, Role-Playing Experience for IBM and Compatibles.

What makes it your favorite? Chances are, part of the answer will be that it has some really cool lick by one of the artists performing on the recording. You look for that lick each time you listen to the song, and you never tire of hearing it. Now put yourself in the composer's shoes at the time that the song was written. You have this idea in your mind and you want to express it the coolest way possible. You bring in the best soloist you know and, on the first take, magic occurs—there's this unbelievable rill at just the right place in the recording. So, you mix the recording down to a digital master. Listening to it is just like being there when it happened. From there you move the master to an audio CD. Yep, it's still just like being there. You want people without CD players to hear this great song too, so you record from the master to a cassette. Well, it's not like being therethe riff lacks the sparkle and punch it had a ROM chip.

"The Ultimate Daughtercard The Daughtercard Dictionary DYNAMICS ARE EVERYTHING Most computer game music is composed and performed using a wavetable synthesizer. The game music data will generally sound OK on any wavetable synthesizer, but the sparkle and punch may get lost on some. The reason for this is the dynamics of a patch can vary greatly from card to card. What is a patch? A patch is a numbered \"slot\" that an instrument or set of instruments is placed into. \"Patch\" and \"instrument,\" though many times used interchangeably, do not mean the same thing, as a patch can contain more than one instrument. Dynamics are extremely important in enabling the delivery of sparkle and punch. To understand what this means, imagine a composer sitting at a computerized grand piano and performing a piano concerto. He uses every nuance of great technique to deliver the emotion he feels. His actual performance is recorded by a computer that has the capability of recording each piano key played, including the time each is played, how hard each key is hit, and how long the key is held down, among other things. At times during the performance the composer plays ten notes at a time, all of which the computer accurately records. After saving the computer file of his performance, the composer sends it to a computer game company which licenses it for an upcoming release. The game company is very excited about the composition. They played it numerous times on their wavetable synthesis card, the same brand that the composer used. It sounds exactly like it did when the composer performed it. It sounds fantastic! Then, the music file is sent to another member of the game development team. This person happens to have a brand new Acme \"Coyote\" wavetable daughtercard (a fictitious device). When the music file is played on the Coyote, it sounds like notes are being hit late. When the music slows down, it sounds like notes cut off early. During faster portions of the composition with a lot of notes playing at once, it sounds like notes are getting bluntly cut off. Because proper grand piano dynamics were not built into the Coyote, the previously marvelous performance now sounds like junk. What is going on here? The late notes are a result of the attack designed into the Coyote's piano patch. Playing a song using this patch is like playing the computerized grand piano with sponges on the tips of your fingers, making the music sound sluggish. On some of Don't let the tech-speak fool and confuse their default settings, most daughtercards you. Be on the look out for: with digital effects have a more \"CD audio\" Patches: This is the term used for digsound than those without. In the near fuitally recorded instrument and sound efture there will probably be games that fects.

So can means that there is a music data file particthe terms used in connection with ularly written for the card), the only drum polyphony. \"Voice\" and \"note\" are most set used by the composer will be the one often used here.

"The game's size is deliberate, of course. \"A player pays around 90 dollars to buy it,» says Roberts. \"He'd be disappointed if he finished it in a night.\" This said, a built-in \"cheat\" feature will, if they can find it, give the battle-weary and the hopelessly inept the chance to get their money's worth out of the game. Roberts said that Origin will neither publish nor publicize the cheat, but that it will be there in the final release for easter egg hunters to scope out.

You'll be able to say, 'I think I'd like to see my friend Karen Allen in one of the roles, and maybe Bogart for another.' That's the next step.\" Perhaps so. But even if I had free choice, I doubt I could have picked a better cast for WING COMMANDER III than Origin has, or done better by them. The actors work well off of each other; the story works well off the action; the script's a real script; the music is real music; the game, as a game, is strong, and as a piece of cinema is—who would have predicted it?—even stronger. It all makes quite an addictive package, not least of all to the actors who breathed life into it. At one point, I took advantage of another writer's pulling Rhys-Davies aside for an interview as an excuse to slide into his seat and take over his game. \"You're stealing my game!\" he thundered. \"You're a gentleman to let me,\" I said. \"Don't think of it as my being a gentleman,\" he said. «Think of it as theft.\" When I left, he was still playing.

"Onslaught Strategic Level Warfare For Your Macintosh The Fat Mimy Unil Orders into For one hundred years your people were dominated by a mighty, foreign empire. Now, weak from internal strife, your oppressors have withdrawn to their original homeland far to the north and across the sea. Old national boarders reappear and armies are raised to defend them. Out of the newly reconstituted nations only two stand strong. The battle lines are drawn, your army awaits your orders. Onslaught puts you in command of a nation on the brink of war. Build a divisional level army using 18 different unit types in order to conquer your age old rival. Attack from land, air, and sea on a detailed, randomly generated continent until you are victorious or vanquished. In Onslaught your troops are not disposable so you must take care to train yoursoldiers and let them rest when needed.

They're slinging about which operating system is to kick around. G2 (continued from page 293) around that SSI has told Gary to stop making unofficial patches for the game (he was up to version x19). The reason is that a new, \"official,\" upgraded version is in the works and currently undergoing beta testing. We certainly commend both Gary Grigsby for taking upon himself personal responsibility for customer support, and SSI for keeping a game as important as PACIFIC WAR upgraded for their customers. * For those not on the Genie network, you may have missed Mark Baldwin leaking some information on White Wolf Productions' next release. Apparently, the working title is EMPIRE II and it will be considerably different than EMPIRE DELUXE. While the units will maneuver on a square grid map covered with some new and familiar terrain tiles, just about everything else is user definable: unit values (somewhere between 10 and 20 of them for every unit type, including movement and combat vs. every other unit type in play), terrain effects on combat, game length, map size, victory conditions—you name it. Mark also indicated that their new product would be on an operational scale (i.e., production would not be emphasized, but reinforcements and winning campaigns would be). Finally, he mentioned that there would be an icon editor for creating new unit types. With this kind of configurability, plus the modem and e-mail play support that White Wolf is known for, 1995 is already shaping up to be a good year! * Other sequels are coming up, too. Among them is CUSTER'S LAST STAND (working title) from Incredible Simulations. This group, composed of the Brothers Lapkoff, gave us DEFEND THE ALAMO! Readers interested in wearing arrow shirts should call Incredible Simulations at (312) 267-3808. * Word of MASTER OF ORION DELUXE is in the wind. SimTex Software has been compiling tons of consumer feedback on the update from the on-line networks. Planned features include more alien races (perhaps even a \"design your own\" feature); separating military from civilian population points so that other races can be subjugated; new ships including space stations, carriers and fighters; real multiplayer capability (in a Micro Prose game?!), and more. Let's hope the deal is done and all of these great player suggestions come to fruition. * X-COM, too, has come down with a case of sequelitis. Two products, one with an underwater setting and the other set on a different planet, are under consideration at MicroProse. * More details are coming out for BEYOND SQUAD LEADER. Atomic Games is programming this Avalon Hill release, and it is important to remember that this will not be a computerized version of the mega-hit ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER board game series! The basic element in BEYOND SQUAD LEADER is individual soldiers (as opposed to squads in the board game). These soldiers (continued on page 296) 294 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1994 "

"Nobody lives forever. Except you. en winfinity MACHINE FROM REM SOFTWARE Universal cheating capability allows Infinity Machine to work with virtually any game. Enhanced search engine with multiple modes (basic and deep) to locate cheat codes for virtually any game feature. Freeze or edit game features to your liking to provide more gold, lives, time, or even invincibility NEW! Full support for DOS extenders such as DOS4/GW, Pharlap, and DOSX that use extended memory to store game data. G2 (continued from page 294) operate in 4-5 man teams, and the game allows for effective management of about 20 to 25 of these teams (plus their vehicles) per side. There will also be two Al modules, one for \"strategic\" planning and one for executing more tactical matters (the latter simulating the soldier's individual brains!). Players cannot tell their individual soldiers what targets to shoot at, ammo to use, or what mode to fire in the tactical Al will handle that BEYOND SQUAD LEADER, like New World's IRON Cross, is a real-time game. Thus, players will order their troops where to go and which areas to cover. The soldiers will decide on their own if they will go at doubletime or crawl low to the ground, etc. Basically, one assumes the role of a field commander, trying to deal with the chaos when plans go out the window (i.e., after contact with the enemy). Survivors can be advanced to other scenarios to make for campaign style play. * Alliance won't be producing Big Time Software's FLIGHT COMMANDER. Avalon Hill will be releasing an improved version of the game both for the Macintosh and Windows. Alliance will, however, be releasing HARPOON CLASSIC and COMMAND AT SEA. The latter is Larry Bond's WWII version of HarPoon expected to be released in 1995. * Crossing over from board wargaming is GMT Games' ALEXANDER THE GREAT. The computerized version is lovingly nicknamed \"Alexander the Byte\" and it will be released by SSI. Renowned designer of the board game, Mark Herman, will be trying some new Al techniques in the game that he developed while working for the Pentagon (nothing classified, of course!). Features are expected to include: a campaign game where surviving units and leaders show up at the next battle; a playby-e-mail feature; extensive on-line help (after all, the rules for the board game already exist!); on-line history by Mark Herman and Richard Berg; unit values that can be edited, and more. Release is hoped for the Summer of '95. NEW! Smaller size of 25k that requires no conventional memory when using popular memory managers such as QEMM386, 386MAX, and EMM386.

"Q.Q.P.'s Strategies of the Month Grandest batt pleet By:Steve Cohen The random maps pose an interesting challenge to many players. There may be instances when the computer seems to get the upper hand as far as starting position. Don't let this discourage you. We have found that some of the best battles have been under these circumstances. Remember the economics of the game. The use of the Opera and Downtown become very important in the close games. It gives you that vital edge that you may need. It may pay to bomb cities with that one really good shot, if it means destroying you enemy's economic assets. To do this you must get something with some punch through the enemy lines. Bombers can help pulverize the enemy front lines. Getting the battleship through can be absolutely devastating. Using other ships as the cannon fodder, you can get an un-damaged battleship close enough to bomb a city. Try the campaigns, they are a great way to play The Grandest Fleet. Your methods will havto change to protect your ships while escorting them quickly to the exit area. We have ha tons of fun with these campaigns. The Pure parti. To truly be an effective leader, use all the aspects of war. Utilize the air strikes and artillery whenever possible. If you are confronted with a particularly powerful unit, hit it from the air, then arty, then you are ready to attack with your ground units. Mechanized infantry seem to do the best damage when attacking infantry, or tanks. When you attack from the ground, hit from all sides, and don't give up until the unit has been destroyed. This will help to insure the victory of your side. Look at the statistics of the opponent before attacking. Judge your strength, morale, and fatigue against his before attacking. This may prove to change the tide. Another quick hint; use the key to see what type of unit you are attacking and how hard he will be to destroy So he to turning things to \"Quoting the Quotes\"|| *** The Grandest Fleet*** \"This is what great gaming is all about.\" M.

"T HE 1SCORE Welcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. CGW GHLIGHTS HALL OF FAME Baseball EARL WEAVER BASEBALL ELECTRONIC ARTS, 1986 In its original form, EARL WEAVER BASEBALL was the quintessential sports game. It offered reasonable statistical accuracy, and was the first baseball game to use a physical model as opposed to a strictly statistical model in resolving plays. It featured both an action and a management mode, allowed complete flexibility in drafting and editing players, and was the first game to allow customization of stadiums and team uniforms. For several years, il was the only game in town. Unfortunately, the sequel to the original game was a boondoggle that disappointed many fans. Still, the original EARL WEAVER BASEBALL was a watermark design in sports simulations that raised the entire genre with its tide. Its spirit may still live on in Dynamix' FRONT PAGE SPORTS: BASEBALL.

The game was revamped for 8-bit personal computers in the '80s by Mark Baldwin, who added a new interface and some new unit types. Before Sid Meier's CIVILIZATION came along, EMPIRE held the Most Addictive Game crown by virtue of its simple mechanics, deep game play, and unending replayability. The game was further revamped in EMPIRE DELUXE, which added a fresh gleam to the graphics, improved interface mechanics, and enhanced multiplayer options. DECEMBER 1994  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 347 "
