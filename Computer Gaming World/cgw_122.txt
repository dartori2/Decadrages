"TOP10 Sayings Overheard At CES 10. Where's the EA (or Sega) booth? 9. Where's the party? 8. Why do I have to pay for drinks here, when they're free at the CGW party? 7. I think we're undergoing a paradigm shift. 6. We're planning to ship in the Fall, but don't hold me to that. 5. It has to ship by Christmas or we're fried. 4. And it has Silicon Graphics-rendered backgrounds! 3. Who's going to buy Ziff? (Immediately followed by the questioner's pet theories.) 2. What's the hottest thing you've seen? (Once asked only one hour after the show opened.) 1. It's like DOOM, but better! Three Things Not Heard At The Show 3. We know it won't make any money, but we had to do combat and recruit new soldiers. Software Toolworks' METAL MARINES FOR WINDOWS (a cross between BATTLESHIP and SIMCITY) and Accolade's BATTLE ISLE 2200 with its 3-D animated battle sequences will both feature futuristic combat via modem or network. Sports gamers won't be left out of networking, either. HARDBALL. 4 still features the play-by-play of Al Michaels, but now features SVGA graphics in 640x480 with 256 colors and, best of all, modem /network support. Statistics are dynamic throughout the season, and league play features limited trading (there is no real GM utility). Spectators will enjoy the 28 detailed stadiums and the computer-determined highlight reel. RUNNER: THE LEGEND RETURNS. Not only does the game have luscious graphics and some nasty new traps to spring on the AI baddies, it also has an extremely versatile utility for creating custom levels. Indeed, Dynamix is shipping the same toolset they are using to create the levels for the new game with the new game, so gamers should be able to create commercial quality levels from the start. Maxis is trying something completely different with CLICK 'N PLAY. Why are we not surprised? The software toy publisher is now producing a powerful object-oriented construction set that will enable gamers to create all sorts of games pinball games, racing games, platform games and more. It's easy to use compared to earlier products such as Broderbund's ARCADE CONSTRUCTION SET and Electronic Arts early ADVENTURE GAME CONSTRUCTION Ser, and it offers commercial quality graphics, as well.

"Log Inu BTT / 1800 from your Zero's 20mm cannon. Head-on attacks are more dicey. The trick here is to find out whether the enemy pilot is after you, or someone nearby. If it's you, duck. If it's someone else, go for it. Deflection shooting is another story. What seems to matter is not the distance to the plane you're shooting at or its speed, but the angle between the planes. If your target is 500 yards away, doing 250 knots, and turning gently, you can give him the standard deflection and you'll get him. If he's 50 yards away, flying at 100 knots, and traveling at a 45 degree angle to you, things get tricky. The best tactic in this situation is to get in as close as you can, at most 50 yards, preferably less. Get the enemy plane in your sights, turn in the same direction until it slides out of view under the nose of your plane, then fire. Unlike most other sims you won't crash into your victim, provided you break away promptly. The Zero outperforms the Wildcat on every count. My Zero pilots (flying at maximum difficulty level) score an average of 2.0 victories per mission; the Wildcat flyers score 1.3. I've always believed one of the Wildcat's greatest assets was that it could outdive a Zero, thus getting away at leisure for another one of those sive maneuver: a steep climbing turn. famous hit-and-run attacks.

"ling bombersâthe rear gunners in 1942 are lethal. Keep jinking and dodging, especially on your way out. 11 VIRTUAL COCKPIT: IS IT ANY USE? The fighters in 1942 feature the first worthy attempt to deal with a common problem. Instead of hitting several 'F' keys to get the various views, you can press Alt+F1', hit and hold the second button on your joystick, and your pilot's head will move the way you move the joystick. While you're in the virtual cockpit mode, you can also choose to keep a chosen plane in view by pressing the 'I' key when it is in your sights. Every time you press the second joystick button, your pilot's head will turn to look at that particular plane. It sounds great, but it has its drawbacks. Because the view is controlled by the joystick, you can't control your plane while you're looking around. Flying a plane in 1942 is difficult, and letting go of the controls even for a couple of seconds is not a good move. If you're in a vicious dogfight right above the waves, it invites disaster. The l' key option is good when you're flying against a single enemy, with no other bandits around.

A generic message generation system using an iconic interface is being designed. After a player selects the proper buttons, the message will be clearly received by computer players, while a human opponent will get a specially generated text message, complete with the sending nation's \"national overtone.\" Thus, you won't be sure if a message was sent by a computer or a human adversary. game in such a way that it is automatically compressed (both to make it cheaper to send and to keep it from being easily edited by cheaters) and ready for another player to load on his or her computer and do their turn. Granted, this is another challenge for programming teams, but a minor one, I think. After all, Mark Baldwin and Bob Rakowsky were able to give us both real-time modem play and a PBEM feature in EMPIRE DELUXE. We think designers should follow this sound model when possible. When in doubt, however, give us PBEM. It is not only the easiest multi-player solution to implement, but in many cases it is the least expensive option for the gamer, as well. "

AT THE WALL THE TORT 335 NOX OT TEE ALL IN TEL TOT 1 QE ele SOQULLUE Be BE & GUNS TO THE NORTH, GUNS TO THE SOUTH While the Texans have more cannons than the attackers, the limited supply of gunpowder makes every shot extremely precious. Firing a 2-pound cannon won't use much powder, but Travis' 18-pound gun burns the stuff up very quickly. The Mexicans, with no gunpowder limitations, set up their guns several hundred yards outside the fort, blasting away at your walls in an effort to breach them. Should a breach occur, a massive, four-wall assault soon follows (as opposed to Santa Anna's normal attacks against one to three walls at a time). When that occurs, your cause becomes hopeless and it's just a matter of how many of the enemy you can take down with you. Therefore, the battle turns upon whether or not your Texans can take out the Mexican cannons before they breach your walls. This can be accomplished either by counterbattery fire (during the dayâand I recommend using your 12-pound guns for this) or by sorties against them at night. Silencing Mexican cannons is a difficult but ultimately rewarding task, as they're worth a lot of victory points. By day 13, if you can hold out that long, Santa Anna is through wasting his time and men, and he makes his massive, coordinated assault on the fortress even if he has not succeeded in breaching your walls. While I've yet to completely hold out, I've had a tremendous time going down fighting and inflicting as much damage to the Mexicans as possible. Points are scored for destroying enemy soldiers and cannons, although the rules don't indicate the exact formula for this. (It turns out that you get one point for every 10 Mexicans killed, and Tedan Command: Battle Date: 3 March 1836 Total Tesden Defenders: 315 CROCKETT'S LAST STAND Even the famed Tennessee Long Rifles can't hold forever, as Santa Anna's finest swarm over the walls for the final time. DOEU five for each Mexican artillery piece destroyed. Historically, the defenders got an impressive score of about 175 points.) The included 32-page booklet is long on historical color while short on specific game hints. When I mentioned this to the designers, they quickly put together a playing tips sheet, which is now included with every copy of the game. Still, I managed to put a plan together quickly through trial and error, burning down the neighboring village of La Villita, which was providing cover for the enemy, and manning my ramparts efficiently. In the end, though, Santa Anna has worn me down every time and wiped out my desperate defenders to a man. Each time, though, I seem to be exacting a heavier toll and improving upon the Texans' historical performance. Defend the Alamo! includes three variations for play. The historical option provides 30 men from the nearby town of Gonzalez to reinforce you. A \"Fannin arrives\" option guarantees you will get the 350 men from Fort Defiance, along with those from Gonzalez. Finally, a random scenario has these two groups of men in random locations; your messengers must locate them and, with luck, persuade one or both groups to join you. BECOME A GAME REVIEWER!

"SCORET Welcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. GW H.O.F. HIGHLIGHTS HALL OF FAME CIVILIZATION bad Anato Send The lo SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION MICROPROSE, 1991 Though we have only anecdotal evidence to support us, we would guess that more hours have been invested in conquering the worlds of CIVILIZATION than in any other computer game in the hobby's history. Economics, exploMICROPROSE ration, military strategy and diplomacy are all elegantly bound together in this magnum opus of world conquest games. Designer Sid Meier has long been synonymous with great game play, but in this design Meier truly out-did himself, creating an experience conducive to a vicious case of what we call \"game lockÂ»-that overwhelming state of mind where you are glued to your keyboard, promising yourself that you'll play \"just one more turn, one more turn, one more...\" The upcoming COLONIZATION will use the basic design of CIVILIZATION, but will focus in on a specific historical period. THE BARD'S TALE (Electronic Arts, 1985) BATTLE CHESS (Interplay Productions, Inc., 1988) CHESSMASTER (The Software Toolworks, 1986) CIVILIZATION (MicroProse, Inc., 1991) DUNGEON MASTER (FTL Software, 1987) EARL WEAVER BASEBALL (Electronic Arts, 1986) EMPIRE (Interstel, 1978) F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER (MicroProse, Inc., 1988) GETTYSBURG: THE TURNING POINT (SSI, 1986) GUNSHIP (MicroProse, Inc., 1989) HARPOON (Three-Sixty Pacific, 1989) KAMPFGRUPPE (Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1985) KING'S QUEST V (Sierra On-Line, Inc., 1990) M-1 TANK PLATOON (MicroProse, Inc., 1989) MECH BRIGADE (Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1985) MIGHT & MAGIC (New World Computing, 1986) M.U.L.E.

Originally released in 1987 on the Atari ST, DUNGEON MASTER's trend-setting graphics moved away from the \"windowed\" screen look, and its realistic sound effects created a terrific adventuring atmosphere. The game instantly became a showcase title for the Atari and Amiga machines. Though in many ways it was a typical hack n' slash dungeon romp, it introduced many subtle twists to the mechanics of role playing, many of which have been emulated by other games over the years. The only blemish on this game's history is that it took FTL over two years to complete the IBM conversion of the game, by which time many other games had adopted and improved upon its innovations. Fans of the game will want to keep an eye out for a sequel coming this Fall from Interplay Productions. SEPTEMBER 1994. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 173 "
