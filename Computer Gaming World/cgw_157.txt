May ubbed by many as the \"golfer of the century.\" Jack Nicklaus is truly a legend in his own time. So it's only fitting that the latest computer game to bear his name, Accolade's JACK NICKLAUS 4, should be the preeminent golf simulation of our time. Nearly everything you could ever hope for in a golf game is included in this comprehensive package. It's an absolute model of perfection. deep breath): five 18-hole courses (Colleton River Plantation, Country Club of the South, Muirfeld Village, Cabo del Sol, and the fictional Winding Springs), eight play styles, a full-blown course designer, a course converter (for importing JNSE courses), and a choice of four multiplayer modes (serial, modem, LAN, and Internet). The only thing missing is post-game cocktails at the club fog, maximum distance for gimmes, and total number of mulligans allowed per round. The real kicker is the variety of available game styles, the most of any golf sim on the market. These include Best Score Championship, Best Score Handicap, Stroke Play, Match Play, Sudden Death, $1 Million Skins Challenge, Bingo Bango Bongo, and Certified Game (recorded Stroke Play for deferred mail or email matchups). Graphically, JN4 meets or exceeds anything on the market, including Access Software's LINKS LS. Accolade uses a proprietary height-mapping engine to achieve incredible terrain realPre-game options include course, game length, golfing buddies (with updated stats), a choice of caddies, gimmes, mulligans, and weather conditions (rain, fog, or clear).

Starting with a flat piece of land, you build your course from the inside out, applying fairway shapes and greens, setting pars and handicaps, and arranging your overall layout with an eye for natural continuity. Next, fine-tune each hole with variations in shape, elevation and terrain type.

For the real-world courses, aerial flybys enabled the designers to accurately detect land elevations within six inches of sca level at Ixl foot intervals. The underly ing engine then calculates variables such as light source shading, shadows, and reflections, resulting in the most organic-looking terrain I've ever seen. In fact, look closely and you'll see that the terrain even shades itself-proof positive of the game's subtle but utterly mind-blowing attention to detail. Because golf is such a fast-paced sport OK, I'm being sarcastic JN4's screen redraws are markedly quick Technically, it's incredible, considering that nearly two-thirds of what you see is 3D-rendered terrain, unlike LINKS IS, which relies much more on a 2D painting horizon to fill the screen. Of course, overall speed is still reliant on hardware factors, such as processor speed, system and video RAM, graphic dctail, and screen resolution. JN4 rewards gamers with more than 20MB system RAM, and will run at whatever maximum resolution and color depth your video carl supports. Those with less-thanda Course Conversions and Web Sites alk about getting your money's worth! If you're an avid golfer, JACK NICKLAUS 4 may well be the deal of your dreams. Not only do you get five courses and a built-in designer, but you'll also inherit what amounts to an instant library of thousands of custom-designed links. JN4 has the ability to import and convert courses created with its predecessor, JACK NICKLAUS SIGNATURE EDITION. All you need is a modem and access to the Internet or other major online services, including America Online, Compuserve. and Delphi. There you'll find enough courses to make your putter flutter indefinitely. The conversion process only transfers terrain shapes and elevations, so you'll have to add objects such as trees and bushes. But that's a minor chore and a heck of a lot easier than starting from scratch. Below is a list of only a few top Web sites offering hundreds of JNSE courses, available as free downloads.

"JOHNNY WILSON Imitation: Flattery or Mockery? tele \"Follow the Leader\" Game Design Is Entropic am beginning to see a pattern emerge. first began to notice this while visiting a struck tire with me) was the design paradigm du jour. Yet, even those iconic products were not imitated in anywhere near the quantities that today's \"Me, too!\" products are being copied. Today, there are had previously led the industry with innovative technology and products. But on this trip, most of what they were showing me fell into two \"Me, too!\" categories: firstperson perspective 3D-shooters and real-time strategy games. At that point, I was aware of 24 real-time strategy games and 10 first-person shooters already in development. Yet, I grinned and bore it through their presentation. I then visited a game company that was not only rumored to be, but very evidently was in trouble. Their solution? To put out three first-person shooters and three real-time strategy games. Finally, I visited a relatively new player in the publishing mix. Their strategy? To choose four real-time strategy games to be the centerpiece of their new line. Now, before you claim that I'm merely alarmed because, with some exceptions, first-person shooters and real-time strategy games aren't my style, let me simply state that would say what I'm about to say even if every one of these games was a SIMCITY clone (my favorite game of all time) or a CIVILIZATION clone (my second favorite game of all time). Ironically, I have voiced similar sentiments in the past when SIMCITY and CIVILIZATION were being imitated, and perhaps more vocifer ously when Myst (a game that never ( Why are publishers willing to pour millions of dollars into \"Me, too!\" products when they won't take even small risks on innovative games? two games of the same style? Given such a choice, even hard-core wargamers who only play turn-based games would probably opt for an advanced difficulty game and a \"beer and pretzels\" level game. How then, do companies expect games with roughly the same style of graph ics, on-screen perspective, and simi lar play mechanics to break through the noise and capture the imagina. tion and discretionary spending of a critical mass of gamers? We think many gamers will say, \"I'm not going to buy any of these games until someone with credibility tells me it's better than WARCRAFT II or C&C: RED ALERT.\" Gamers not only like win ning, they want to play the \"winner\" in a given category, too. At the recent Computer Game Developers Conference, we heard producers of potential hits in the real time strategy game category suggest that the success of their games may be diminished by the market glut. Even good games stand to be hurt by mediocre \"Me, too!\" products. What eventually results is that fans of that particular game style are the big losers when publishers act like lemmings and ultimately claim that realtime strategy doesn't work anymore. Call me foolish (it won't be the first time), but I can't understand why publishers are willing to pour millions of dollars into \"Me, too!\" products, but aren't willing to take even small risks on innovative games. Even in mee Even in Hollywood, we see the occasional independent show up with a little\" film that makes more revenue than a disappointing \"big\" movie. Why aren't computer game publishers as intere sted in finding great \"little\" games as they are in funding multi-million dollar disasters? Why aren't they investing in distinctive products rather than playing \"Follow the Leader\"? The answer is fear. A publishing executive who greenlights a realtime strategy game can be secure in the fact that every other publishing executive is greenlighting real-time strategy games, too. If the game fails, the executive can point to all of his peers and say, \"We thought it was the time for real-time strategy games, but we were all wrong.\" After all, there are going to be a lot of these games that will fail. If the same executive greenlights an epoch role playing/strategy game or a huge persistent world online game that fails, all of the fingers will be pointing at that individual executive. \"You're the only one who thought that could work,\" they will say. There really is safety in numbers. As for me, I keep hoping that some publishing executive will find some courage. That's what keeps me in this job. Just when I think there's never going to be any more innovation, someone brings out a game that does something I've never seen done before or allows me to do more than 1 ever thought possible. Of course, there's always the risk that the lemmings will have 100 clones just like the new hit on the market next year. vengono almost 15 first-person shooters in the works, and in excess of 50 real time strategy games in production. Do the math. How many hits does the industry generally support at a time? Let's be generous. Let's say there are a dozen games making money at any given point. Let's be extravagant. Say there are 20 or 30. How many of them will be the same style of game? How many gamers walk into a store with the intent of buying two games and walk out with AUGUST 1997 CGW "

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH about us \"Screwdriver shops\"? Better yet, how about doing an exposé on the new lowcost Pentium systems and reveal the truth for all to see Michael R Smith Sunrise, Florida MYST-DEFYING REACTION Thank you for publishing your reasons for disliking Myst (June, 197). I had detected a snide dismissal of the game in your writing for a long time, and I could not pinpoint why. Grrr! Allow me to differ with your points Mystis popular despite the game's lack of game design quality. Yep, any product that arrogantly promises to«become your world\" has an uphill fight to gain admiration, but Myst became my favorite game despite the hype. Panning and motion were slow. Yes, they were painful, but worth it. It was actually not Myst, but other games, that forced me to upgrade. There are no characters to interact with Maybe Sir Derek Jacobi can make tripe sound like poetry, but Tex Murphy and King Graham do not. So there are no characters to interact with? Thank you, Miller brothers! Encountering their funny original characters is a rare treat. Since I don't expect humor from a mystery story which gradually reveals the depravity of two madmen, Mysi's lack of interaction is little sacrifice. The puzzles are illogical. Yes, you do wander around trying to figure out what to do. But illogical? Fascinating worlds have been discovered and organized by a brilliant eccentric, so the player visits ordered worlds whose hidden, particularmethod of order provides a sense of wonder and excitement over what the next screen may bring Emphasis is on pretty and empty graphics rather than game design. That's like complaining that Notre Dame Cathedral is boring to visit because it doesn't have enough candles to light. Myst was amazingly innovative. It was the first game I encountered that used aural clues. It was the first to have both detailed and imaginative graphics. The game designers slept with your spouses. Oops. Myst kept me too obsessed for a few months in 1993 to notice. Now, where is that lawyers number..? Well, that's the mudpie. Here's the eclair I have been meaning to write for a while. Continued on pg 225) TURN OF THE SCREWDRIVER Mr. Wilson, in his efforts to cxplain the pervasive bugs in new games (CGWeditorial, Junc, '97) mentions \"screwdriver shops (local computer stores that assemble machines with components du jour, often resulting in systems with configuration anomalies).\" Well, that may be the situation in some areas, but I find the reverse to be more the case. With the advent of companies such as ACER, Packard Bell, HewlettPackard, and others now promoting such things as Pentium 133 systems for as low as $795,00, companics such as mine find ourselves in a difficult position as far as price competition goes. How do we compete? We build better systems! We don't use the old Triton chipset motherboards and fast pagc-mode RAM with low-end, noisy, self-destructing hard drives, Thor do we use old S-3 graphics cards and cheap SoundBlaster-16compatible sound cards. Instead, through trial and error and constant research, we build fast, reliable machines with the hardware combinations that have been proven to work well in conjunction with each other. We have to support these machines locally and are married to them if we want to keep both our customers happy and our reputation intact. Without demeaning others' products, we must explain the difference in proprietary hardware and upgradability. The average consumer hasn't a clue as to the difference between a P-133 system for $795.00 and a P-133 system for $1595.00. The power user or gamer will spot the performance difference right away, even if he doesn't know the first thing about hardware, software, and system configurations. The less expericnced user cannot Would you please print something a little more complimentary Johnny Wilson responds: The intent of the editorial was not to denigrate \"screwdriver shops.\" Indeed, I also singled out Dell Cateway, and Micron in the same paragraph for mixing components. Since I'm very happy with my Micron, I wasn't trying to disparage any of those sources. The point was simply that it is not possible to test all Dell, Gateway, and Micron configurations for every game, much less to test the many \"screwdriver shop\" configurations. I was merely trying to show how large the bug-chasing problem is. The article was on playtesting, not on where to purchase your hardware. By the way, we don't recommend that a gamer buya P-133 anything at this point in time. By early '98, the P-166 will be the bottom-line game platfom. MYST Oops, We Goofed In our recent Speaker Roundup (June, '97), we incorrectly identified Diamond Audio Technology as Diamond Sound, and to make matters worse, we called its CGChoice-winning S2HPM4060 system the S2. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused. CGW AUGUST 1997 "

"comnutar LETTERS World >>Continued from pg 20 Johnny Wilson offers credibility, insight, and an air of crudition to an industry littered with self-satirizing embarrassments like Krush KILL 'n Destroy. Martin Cirulis has a feisty viewpoint that is as welcome as it is embracing, Loyd Case and Dave Salvator are outstanding on technology and obviously do their homework. Charles Ardai is always worth reading regardless of the product under review because he flat-out writes the consistently best prose of any game reviewer I know. And thanks for the editorial acumen that elevates the whole hobby by publishing William \"Trotter's apologia several months ago In short, despite your Mystopia, thanks for ten-plus years of consistent excellence. May you never run out of red or blue pages. Albert Them Lansdowne, PA RAMSES SPEAKS I recently read Robert Coffey's review of our game, POWERSLAVE («Ramses Reeks,\" May, '97), and felt compelled to respond on behalf of Lobotomy Software. As a developer, we realize not everyone is going to like our game, but we hope that our efforts will have, at the very least, turned out a product that is fun to play. Mr. Coffey raises some good points in his review, and also tosses around some pretty damning condemnations (\"In a staggering display of boncheaded game design, POWERSI AVE manages to botch almost every aspect of gameplay through unwelcome features, limp imitation, and an unexplainable inability to fully utilize DUKE NUKEM'S outstanding BUILD engine.\") in regards to the game. Don't get me wrong-as much as I disagree with the above quote, I'm not writing to you to say \"Hey, what are you talking about, POWERSLAVE is a great game! It deserves four or five stars, you creep!\" First of all, we here at Lobotomy are the first ones who will tell you that POWERSLAVE should have been released much earlier, possibly even before DUKE NUKEM. As a result, POWERSLAVE shows its age. Our game uses a version of BUILD even older than the one used in DUKE NUKEM, which of course makes it look bad next to DUKE and even worse compared to QUAKE. But we did our best with the tools in hand, especially when it comes to level design. In fact, Paul Knutzens levels have been singled out in most POWERSLAVE reviews as the solitary redeeming feature of the game. Mr. Coffey even refers to them as follows: \"To its credit, POWERSI AVE does have a number of intricate levels with truly challenging puzzles and obstacles.\" As for the writers who review for CGW, what kind of rules (if any) do you have when it comes to them playing a game and then writing the review? Did Mr. Coffey actually play all the way through POWERSLAVE? At least halfway? More? Less? In god mode or without god mode? What about network play? Did Mr. Coffey actually round up three to seven other gamers and play a network game for an hour? Doesn't sound like it. At this point, it's also fair to point out the lack of modem support in POWERSLAVE. As far as the save feature is concerned, what's the point in saving your game with every other step? You go for a bit, clear a room, reach a new door and -ooh, better save in case something behind the door kills me! It kind of takes the challenge out of the game. I have mixed feelings about the save feature. I'm as guilty as the rest when it comes to abusing it in QUAKE and DUKE NUKEM 3D, but it sure made POWERSLAVE a challenge hey, what a novel concept! POWERSLAVE has consistently been rated in the mid-90s (on a scale of 100) by most console gaming magazines, even garnering \"Corridor Game of the Year» for the Saturn version in DieHard GameFan, yet it has more or less been thoroughly trashed by the PC mags (1.5 stars from CGW,58% from PC Gamer and I believe a D-from PC Games). M aybe I'm just taking this too personally, but who woulcln't? Still, I feel that I can make something that resembles an objective assessment of POWERSLAVE. Not totally unbiased by any stretch of the imagination, but still objective. So despite its shortcomings (old-school BUILD engine, lack of modem support, etc.) it still adds up to a PUBLISHER Dale Strang EDITORIAL Editor-in-Chief Johnny Wilson Executive Editor Ken Brown Features Editor Denny Alkin (Simulations) Reviews Editor Terry Coleman (Wargames, Classics/Puzzle Games) Technical Editor Dave Salvator (Hardware) CD-ROM Editor Sil M.

To be sure, it's not anything that delves into new territory like QUAKE or has the interactivity and attitude of DUKE, but its definitely not something that ranks somewhere between weak\" and \"abysmal,\" which is where CCWS 15 stars puts it. I would give it 3 stars according to your rating system-it does what it does well. Nothing more, nothing less Tom Kristensen Lobotomy Software PSIn case you're wondering, my role on the POWERSLAVE team was manual writer and play-tester. Zilf-Davis Publishing President, U.S. Publications Ronni Somentoro President, Interactive Media And Development Group Jeffrey Ballowe President, International Media Group J.B. Holston 101 President, Computer Intelligence/Infocorp Bob Brown President, Training & Support Publishing Group William Rosenthal Vice President, Chief Financial Office Timothy O'Brien Vice President, General Counsel, And Secretary J. Malcolm Morris Vice President, Human Resources Rayna Brown Vice President, Planning Daryl R. Otte Vice President, Production Roger Hartmann Vice President, Controller Mark Moyer Treasurer Thomas L. Wright Director of Public Relations Gregory Jarboe Unlike many letters from development teams, your letter raises a lot of interesting questions. Some can be controversial. Let's start with the easy ones. First, we expect all of our reviewers to finish the game. We think we're the only computer game magazine where that's an explicit requirement. As for the multiplayer aspects, we expect the reviewer to test those, loo. However, not every freelancer has a LAN in the house and this game did not support play-by-modem. Second, you may be slightly too sensitive about the BUILD engine comments. Nowhere in the box or documentation does it specify that this is an older version of the BUILD engine than that used in DUKE NUKEM 3D. We were simply aware that the game was released after DUKE NUKEM 3D and that it didn't compare technically with DUKE. It seemed fair to suggest that the tools weren't used very well. As you can see the perspectives with which we view games can be different. Third, you touched on the age-old \"save game\" issue. Does being able to save the game at will reduce the challenge or enable you to proceed at your own pace? I lean toward the latter for the basic reason that I don't want to play the same levels over and over again. That's not my idea of fun. Even in the old motion picture serials where cach chapter ended with a cliffhanger, the filmmakers didn't replay the entire episode when you came back to watch the next week. They cut and pasted the footage to set up both the cliffhanger and the escape. Action games are a lot like cliffhangers. Most of us want our Onscreen characters to succeed against impossible odds, and when they don't, we want a deus ex machina to pull us out of the fire. We don't want to cover the same ground and defeat the same enemies again. All the lack of a flexible save game routine does is guarantee repetition. However, we admit to two schools of thought on this even within the CGW editorial staff. Finally, there is a simple reason for the disparity between the console and PC revicus of the same basic game: demographics. The younger demographic for the console market is a group of gamers with more time than money. They don't mind playing levels over and over again because they perceive that to be part of the fun. PC gamers are, in general, an older demographic with more money and less time. Playing levels over and over can seem tedious at best and wastelul at worst. Console gamers believe that the win is better when you've had to work and work at playing the game. PC gamers believe that winning is the point and that they should be able to get there at their pace, not someone else's. We hope these answers clarify some of the bewildement and that readers realize that few of these answers are relevant for everyone U.S. Publications Group President, U.S. Publications Ronni Somenterg President, Business Media Group Claude Sheer President, Consumer Media Group J.

With A vengeance fter a few months of R&R, Lara Croft is getting ready to spring back into action and kick some more ass in the muchanticipated sequel, TOMB RAIDER 2.

Lara's ready for action in TOMB RAIDER 2 will feature completely new TOMB RAIDER 2 environments, both inside (Lara must explore the depths of a huge mansion) and outside, prompting Eidos to describe the game as \"less tomby\" than its predecessor.

TIE FIGHTER >>> AVM Technologies scored their first coup by bringing a Kurzweil synthesizer engine to PCs in an external daughterbox. Their latest sound card, Apex, brings the same great sounding engine to PCs along with very clean digital audio and Soundblaster Pro compatibility. We've had a chance to bang on the Apex, and have been quite impressed with its overall performance, but that Kurzweil sound doesn't come cheap: At $349, this board is probably best left to musicians rather than gamers. The good news: AVM is planning to unleash a PC-based sound card with support for 3D-positional audio later this year. bummer is the omission of the ENCHANTER trilogy, which would have made the package complete. Other than that boneheaded decision, though, this is a must-have for Zork newbies or completists.

"READ.ME F-22 Combat Gets Nasty DOMUS DE PROPERTY OF NOVALOGIC Lo BosNG PAT Ithough the F-22 Raptor still hadn't made its first test flight when this issue went to press, the plane was the center of a heated skirmish during May involving two software companies, a major player in the military-industrial complex, and the U.S. Air Force. In the end, it appears gamers won the dogfight. The fracas began after interactive Magic announced it was changing the name of 1F-22 ASF to 1F-22 RAPTOR. Meanwhile, Novalogic announced a sequel to F-22 LIGHTNING I called F-22 RAPTOR. In late April, l-Magic received notice from Novalogic that it had registered the F-22 RAPTOR trademark. A few days later, Lockheed Martin pur portedly sent a letter announcing intention to work with Novalogic and telling l-Magic to change the product's name and \"remove all references to Lockheed Martin and all images of Lockheed Martin aircraft from any and all software l-Magic manufac tures, sells, and/or distributes.\" This request implied chilling repercussions for the entire simulation indus try, and threatened to limit use of individual military vehicles not only as the focus of a simulation, but also as potential adversaries. After Novalogic received a similar cease and desist letter from Lockheed Martin, it contacted the compa ny to try to work out an arrangement. Novalogic announced its intent to secure exclusive rights to the \"F-22 Raptor\" name and exclusive access to their technical consulting and other proprietary assets for ongoing fighter programs.\" -Magic took the situation public with an open let ter posted on its Web page explaining the situation and arguing against any one company monopolizing the use of a government aircraft in sims. It received overwhelming support from gamers posting to its Web site and to Usenet newsgroups. Novalogic's John Garcia said that the company didn't want to prevent anyone from doing a simulation with the F-22; its interest was simply in protecting the company's trademarked name. In the end, nobody was a clear winner. Lockheed backed down on its exclusive licensing agreement, releasing a statement on June 6 that stated, \"Lockheed Martin does not intend to license trademarks and logos associated with the F-22 fighter without consultation with the U.S. Air Force, and no licenses will be granted on an exclusive basis. Our objective, like that of the Air Force, is to encourage widespread positive use of the F-22 name Licensing allows us to protect the quality and integrity of our product's names and marks.\" Ironically, l-Magic ended up changing the name to just \"F-22\" after it was discovered that \"Raptor\" was trademarked by Apogee for an arcade game. Apogee offered to license the name, but I-Magic declined. At press time it wasn't clear if Novalogic chose to purchase the trademark, which was rumored to be selling for a whopping $100,000.Denny Alkin THIS JUST IN PERFECT WEAPON SCIENCE FICTION, HORROR AND FANTASY.

"READ.ME THE ULTIMATE RPG? TOM HALL AND ION STORM TO CREATE THE MOST AMBITIOUS CRPG EVER ven as far back as during the development of WOLFENSTEIN 3D, id cofounder Tom Hall wanted to inject a greater sense of story and role-playing into his action games. If he had his way, WOLF3D, DOOM, and Doom II would have had character development, or at least an internally consistent and engrossing story. Having co-founded ION Storm with John Romero, Hall now has the chance to finally create the role-playing game he has always wanted. It is called ANACHRONOX, and it sounds like it could be a win 2 ner. Hall is honest about his inspira: tion: Squaresoft role-playing games. In fact, when I visited ION Storm a few months ago, Hall told me that every member of his team had to play Square's CHRONO TRIGGER RPG before they started work on his game Sly Boots Anachronox is slated for a fall 1998 release, but a lot of art and conceptual design has already begun. It will use the updated Quake engine (fea tured in Hexen I and QUAKE II), and will play from a third-person perspective. The game takes place in the future, in a time when humans have traveled the stars via wormhole. like devices called Senders-massive, planet-sized artifacts left by an unknown, long perished race. These Senders connect the galaxy, and create a massive galactic community. As the game begins, that community stands on the brink of destruction. Mysterious forces, whether natural or not, are now causing the galaxy to collapse in upon itself (what scientists dub a Crunch Conundrum). Could this imminent destruction be linked to the Senders? As the main character, Sylvester \"Sly\" Boots, you begin the game in the city of Anachronox (\"Poison From A Previous Time\"), a city that once was a galactic prison and is now the center of all that is nefarious in the galaxy. It floats in the middle of Sender One, the primary Sender that lies in the very center of the galaxy. Joined by your old flame, Stiletto Anyway, a mercenary android, you embark on a quest that will take you to dozens of worlds and three different dimensions, as you seek to halt this Crunch Conundrum that threatens the galaxy. Like the console FINAL FANTASY Series, this game will be vast. There are plans for the player to face hundreds of different enemies, talk to even more NPCs, and visit more than a hundred different locations, ranging in size from a single room in QUAKE to a full Quake level. Along the way, you'll recruit a total of eight more player characters, which you can play in teams of three. Aside from the sheer size of the game, and the determination to I Stiletto Anyway bring emotion and personality to the story and characters, Hall hopes to introduce a modular weapons system to ANACHRONOX. Certain player characters, called Elementors, will be able to combine components called Elements to create their own unique attacks and weapons. It is an incredibly ambitious project, but Hall is optimistic about his fall 1998 release date. We're excited, and as we hear more about this RPG, we'll bring you updates and a full sneak preview.-Elliott Chin you to control the force and angle of the putt with your mouse, for those true aficionados who really want to polish their skills. 3D ULTRA MINI GOLF those tentacles may do you some damage Following the success of the 3D ULTRA Each hole has appropriate background PINBALL titles, Sierra is inducting a new music, along with the great voice-overs, crazy type of game into the series: sound effects, and mini golf.

"READ.ME SpaceOrb 360 Catches a New Bus UCIE T he industry's latest Godot seems to be the Universal Serial Bus (USB), but the wait may soon be over. Systems are shipping with USB ports and USB-ready BIOSes, and it appears Microsoft has finally released a USB driver for Windows 95. The first USB controller we've gotten is Space Tec's SpaceOrb 360. While this 3D controller might seem somewhat alien to gamers, after some initial learning curve, it lets you drive flying titles like DESCENT 2 and shooters like DUKE NUKEM 3D and QUAKE with aplomb. Since we've seen the SpaceOrb 360 before, this time around, its installation was actually its most impres. sive feat. USB holds the promise of \"hotswappable\" controllers, where you can unplug one, plug in another, and have the new controller recognized and ready to roll without rebooting. Now before this can happen, you'll need to have Windows 95's USB patch installed, but it was pretty starting to plug the SpaceOrb 360 into a USB port where it was instantly recognized, and then be asked for a driver disk. Once installed, this USB version of SpaceOrb 360 drove Interplay's DESCENT 2 as easily as the original, but thanks to USB, you can now have Space Orb, your joystick, and a gamepad all connected at once. SpaceOrb 360 should be shipping by Christmas. -Dave Salvator RICK SEALOCK Question of The Month: Q : I love playing MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR, but I've found that there is no time left for doing exercise.

In fact, at least 10 audio PCI chipsets are currently in the works. For their part, Ensonig has developed their ES1370 chip, which handles general Windows 95 audio chores, has a wavetable synthesizer engine, and provides Sound Blaster Pro 2.0 support for DOS games. The board is very compact, and will hit the streets for about $75-what a deal! AudioPCI loads wavetable samples into system RAM rather than using an onboard wavetable ROM, and offers three General MIDI patch sets: 2MB, 4MB, and 8MB. AudioPCI will also have four-channel output for running a four-speaker setup. In some quick game testing, DOS titles like DUKE NUKEM 3D, COMMANCHE 3, and Quake all ran swimmingly in a DOS box. AudioPCI also has a DOS viver so you can play DOS titles in exclusive MS-DOS mode. Duke and COMMANCHE both ran fine using this driver, but QUAKE crashed repeatedly. Windows 95 titles like USNF '97 ran well, and the General MIDI THIN IN MANN A patch set sounded terrific, for the most part.

"READ.ME Microsoft Set to Use the Force Springfield Springs to Life MM AR VIVA VIEWITHALU n yet another foray into gaming con. troller hardware, Microsoft is work ing on its new force-feedback joy. stick, the SideWinder Force Feedback Pro. As well as adding force feedback technology, this digital stick moves the action buttons that were awkwardly placed on the SideWinder 3D Pro to the front of the stick's base; this allows you to lay your non-stick hand across the base to dial in throttle settings and use the four buttons. Now the downside: This new stick will not support Immersion's Force API, which game developers have been using to talk to CH's Force FIX stick. Instead, Microsoft has incorporated force feedback functions into its DirectInput API in DirectX 5.0, making game developers either choose between APIs, or support both. The prototype unit we tested came with GT Interactive's TIGER SHARK, an aquatic shoot-'em-up. Force feedback features included rattling (when we fired the ship's machine gun) and a sluggish feel when our character went underwater (to simulate the resistance generated by underwater navigation). Also, the Stick reacted whenever we collided with stationary objects or other ships. The coolest thing that came with this unit was the force editor front-end for developers, which lets you tweak the force settings and behaviors for TIGER SHARK, or create new ones. Microsoft hasn't committed to shipping a force editor with the stick, though it would be a welcome addition. Ship date is slated for late September, and a USB version will follow.-Dave Salvator hey come into your home every Sunday night.

"READ.ME Beating Romero At His Own Game by Alex Uttermann UAKE Queen Stevie \"KillCreek\" Case became the darling of the QUAKE community when she challenged QUAKE-creator John Romero to a DeathMatch and won. Now, KillCreek gives us some tips, uncov ers some secrets, and reveals just how it felt to beat the maker. Stevie \"KillCreek\" Case: Champion On DeathMatch vs. single-player: Online competition makes Quake much more competitive and personal. The friendships I've formed through playing Quake make the competition much fiercer. It's great fun to know just what your opponents might be screaming every time you blast them with your rocket launcher! On Beating Romero: Playing John, I was very nervous. I knew what would be said about me, and women QUAKE players in general, if I lost. The match was set up as a best of three, on three different maps. We started playing and I was losing horribly. 16-3. At that point, I let all the sexist comments I had heard run through my head, and thought about what it would be like if I lost. I came back to beat him 25-19. Though I lost on the second map, I did win the third, and therefore won overall. During the first match I was shaking because I was so scared to lose, especially to someone so well. known in the QUAKE community. It turned out to be worth all the tension though. John is a terrific guy and was a great sport about the whole thing, as evidenced by their hilarious shrine to me (www.ionstorm. com/chaos! challenge tshrinel index.html). you learn how to play. There is nothing like the feeling of beating an opponent who thinks you can't play Quake because you are a woman. The time you've spent practicing will be well worth it, to know what that feels like. Favorite Weapon: I almost always use the rocket launcher when I have it. The only time! will switch weapons is when I have the quad and am low on health. I have a specific quad alias in my config that allows me to switch to the most powerful weapon have that won't do self-damage, such as the super nail-gun. Advice to Women Players: If you are new to Quake, stick with it. Find other women or men out there through Quake news pages or IRC who will help KillCreek's Three Rules of Thumb: 1. On Improving Her Skills: You can never be too good at rocket jump. ing. It comes in handy constantly. Also, your biggest advantage against even the best QUAKE player can be knowing the level inside and out. I'm still trying to learn all the important tricks to the most-played levels. Always keep an eye on your opponents' patterns. All players have a natural tendency to run patterns in a level. If you knock players out of their patterns, they will be less successful and more timid. Know the level inside and out.

Your bloody quest through Nosgoth encompasses literally hundreds of different locations-including towns, caves, gypsy camps, underground temples, and forests-in which you will encounter a multitude of ene mies, both human and otherwise.

"PREVIEWS  IMPERIA: EMINENT DOMAIN Target Release Date: August, 1997 Developer: Heliotrope Publisher: THQ Stellar Potential PAX IMPERIA 2 Joins the Saceploitation Race With a New Lease on Life by Martin E. Cirulis perhaps considered far too small to yield a profit on this project. Regardless of how things actually fell out, the bottom line for spaceploitation fans was a big disappointment after a long wait. While gamers turned their hopes to MASTER OF ORION 2, Blizzard quietly sold the design for Pax 2 to an ambitious bunch at THQ, who thought they could do something with the game...and slowly, rumors grew that Pax 2 was \"not quite dead, yet.\" Well, I am happy to report that Pax 2 is feeling much better and sporting a new name. Pax IMPERIA: EMINENT DOMAIN is somewhat less ambitious than its original incarnation, but seems much more playable, a combination that could put MOO2's spaceploitation crown in serious jeopardy. s the entertainment-software industry becomes a high-risk/high-gain playing field, we find more and more games dying in the late stages of development as publishers get cold feet. In the old days, if a game even remotely ran, a company was willing to work it out to the bitter end; now games can find themselves orphaned for a variety of reasons. Luckily for some designs, the success of the industry also means that sometimes another home can be 'found for a game, saving it from a oneway trip to Vaporware Valhalla. A case in point is a spacewar game once known as Pax IMPERIA 2. Heliotrope was developing this PC sequel to a popu'lar Mac spaceploitation for Blizzard, and it was intended to be a game of truly epic proportions. Blizzard went so far as to publish a string of ads in various magazines, and alphas of the game even toured the fledgling online gaming services, in 'hopes of finding an Internet home for the game that was going to revolutionize strategic spacewar. Unfortunately, just when it seemed Pax IMPERIA was mere months away, Blizzard relinquished the whole project and dedicated themselves to a brand new space game with a more built-in audience: STARCRAFT. Rumors of why Pax 2 had vaporized abounded, but many of them revolved around the fear that the first \"monster\" spacewar game, had simply grown too monstrous to be playable by the general public. The union of Serious Grognards and sci-fi fans was WAR AND PEACE Pax IMPERIA: EMINENT DOMAIN has been trimmed down to more traditional levels of detail. Star systems are the usual areas of contention; they commonly have multiple worlds and stargates, a la Deep Space 9, that lead to other stars. Each world has the normal collection of traits that dictate its suitability for colonization-gravity, atmosphere, and temperature-but this game takes a page from SPACEWARD Ho! and reduces these values to a simple Good, Fair, and Bad rating, which allows you to choose future development sites with a glance. So far, this is pretty standard fare, but given that the game is coming near the end of a spaceploitation boom that has crowded the shelves with endless generic titles, this is perhaps the game's weakest CGW AUGUST 1997 "

"PREVIEWS PAX VIVIPERIA: EMINENT DOMAIN Rescarcaj OP A 100 FEWER SECTORS Now that THQ has taken over Pax IMPERIA 2. the scope of the game seems to have been scaled down for more manageable gameplay. There is still plenty to explore and discover, though. GREETINGS, EARTHLING This is the main screen in EMINENT DOMAIN, with graphic displays for going to Research, Colony Managements, Diplomacy, and all the other options in the game. engine has, there are still plenty of options here that are not found in other games, including the ability to completely undermine another empire through espionage, and topple a regime through skulduggery instead of laser fire. THROUGH THE FIRE The late-alpha I played lacks both balanced gameplay and capable Al opponents, and some details of the various alien races are not in place. The final version should take care of these prob lems and provide the host of multiplay options that have become standard in the industry. I hope that the connectivity suite will be elegant and efficient, instead of ad-hoc, as seen in M002. With just a modicum of finishing work, PAX IMPERIA: EMINENT DOMAIN, with its combination of incredible SVGA-graphics looks and attention to detail, could easily find itself at the front of a crowded pack of spaceploitation games, in a dead heat with M002. If it avoids the usual dangers of a buggy release or very weak AI what will decide PAX IMPERIA: EMINENT DOMAIN'S chances at becoming a truly great breakout game is how finely it treads the line between playability and originality. With such a crowd yapping at its heels, and so many designs sharing common features, PAX IMPERIA: EMINENT DOMAIN cannot afford to confuse being userfriendly with becoming too familiar. point. Since the game runs in real time, there seems to be some potential for maneuvering fleets within a system in terms of intercept, escape, and protecting worlds but, at present, the scale of the game seems too large for this grossly overlooked part of space warfare to be a big tactical factor. The actual tactical combat engine is a true gem, though, and will go far in distinguishing this game. The level of detail, both in the ships and weapons, tops that found in M002 by 50 percent, and while it means combats can be a little intricate, it comes closer than any other game I have seen to capturing that rewarding sense of tactical power and flexibility found in classic boardgames like StarFleet Battles. Of course, you can't have epic battles without epic ships, and the ship design part of the game is a tinkerer's delight. With the appropriate tech. nologies researched, a myriad of ships can be designed for very specific tactical missions, and there seems to be enough variety in the options to reduce the \"one right answer\" syndrome that seems to plague so many other spaceploitation titles. While you won't be spending hours in the design process (as it was rumored you could do in the original Pax IMPERIA design), it's safe to say that the ship-construction engine (much like the tactical-combat engine), is the most detailed and rewarding in the genre. Even the peacetime options in PAX IMPERIA: EMINENT DOMAIN have that same eye toward increasing the level of detail. While diplomacy doesn't seem to have benefited quite as much from this design philosophy as the combat THE BIG QUESTION: REAL-TIME COMBAT Despite the involved tactical portion of the game, the one area where PAX IMPERIA: EMINENT Domain could bog down is in combat, especially when the game could potentially boil down to numerous combats that all demand equal attention in realtime. What the game does to partially remedy the problem is queue up all the combats and halt the passage of time in the strategic world, leaving you free to spend your time on each individual battle. L a This gets time-consuming when you are drawn into more than a handful of engagements, so you will have the option of resolving all the battles strategically FAR-OUT FISTFIGHT This is a scene from EMINENT DOMAIN's combat. The ships and weapons are very detailed, which provide more intricate battles. CGW AUGUST 1997 "

Until now, though, it has been limited to just three sports: football, baseball, and fishing. This year, the series welcomes two new sports to its lineup, with the recently released FPS: GOLF and the upcoming FPS: SKI RACING. To live up to the FRONT PAGE SPORTS reputa tion, SKI RACING will attempt to be more of a simulation than popular arcade skiing games like Namco's ALPINE RACER. Dynamix has sent team members to six world-class ski resortsWhistler, British Columbia; Vail and Aspen, Colorado; Park City, Utah; Mt. Bachelor, Oregon; and Val d'Isere, France-to recover topographical data about their race runs. Back in Eugene, Oregon, this data is then con verted to information that can be used to model the runs on the fly within Dynamix's newly devel. oped 3D engine. As it stands now, the mountains in the background are photographic, while the rest of the terrain is rendered graphics.

"COVER STORY Barlow's Kool Sentral Ridae de Cerccer 2 **** W W Uroda by Terry Coleman In 1994, at the Computer Game Developer's Conference, I noticed a roundtable discussion of \"What is Multimedia?\" on the schedule. Since I have always been of the opinion that no one really knows the answer to that question, decided this was one discussion I just couldn't miss. When I arrived at the roundtable, I noticed that the attendees seated themselves as if by some preordained stratification: all the game developers on one side of the long rectangular table, all the Hollywood types on the other. The discussion went along in particularly bland fashion until one of the Hollywood types said, \"The problem with the computer gaming industry is that you don't have a Steven Spielberg.\" Then he made the mistake of looking in my direction. I calmly replied, \"Yes, we do. His name is Sid Meier, and if you knew anything about this industry you'd never have made such a statement.\" I then did my best to suppress a smirk and watched the fireworks commence.

Consider that Sid Meier's CIVILIZATION sold upwards of 850,000 copies, and that Civ II has already eclipsed that number. When you add in PIRATES!, RAILROAD TYCOON, F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER--the list goes on and on-you find that Sid not only has the most designs in the CGW Hall of Fame, but that he's also sold several million games as well! At a time when many of the \"old guard\" have traded in their programming shingle for a set of golf clubs, Sid is still coding away, looking for new chal lenges. And in this age of 3D gurus and Al special. ists, you get a time warp effect from watching Sid work, a throwback to an era when design and pro gramming talent resided in the same body. Sid has always designed according to his own muse, feeling that if the gameplay is there, the sales will follow-a strategy he and Firaxis are certainly following with SID MEIER'S GETTYSBURG. Dail's Den Barlow's Knull he Peach Orchard 66 CGW AUGUST 1997 "


"COVER STORY REAL-TIME SOPHISTICATION SID MEIER'S GETTYSBURG is anything but trendy. It doesn't require a 3D accelerator card or red-hot P200 MMX processor. Then again, that's hardly a surprise, since even a classic Sid Meier design such as CIVILIZATION didn't push the technology when it was released. GETTYSBURG is realtime rather than turn-based, but it's about as far from WARCRAFT II or C&C as Risk! is from PANZER GENERAL It's quite possible to play GETTYSBURG at turbo arcade reflex speed, but if you do, you'll miss a lot of the game's flavor. This is a very different realtime game in that the scale, for once, is appropriate. In C&C, for example, you build bases in minutes that would require the investment of weeks or months of real-world time-which would be fine if the tactical combat wasn't so obviously happening at a different time scale. In GETTYSBURG, the action occurs faster than in the real battle, enough to keep you on your toes. But things stay in perspective: It's easy to believe that you really are moving Union troops to cut off Longstreet's advance, or that you're assem. bling Pickett's division for a climactic assault through the heart of Meade's position on the final day of the battle. Although General Lee would have been excited by the prospect, you don't build barracks on Seminary Ridge and suddenly spew out thousands of Rebel soldiers and bronze cannon. As you give orders to troops--though they're formations rather than individuals-you'll do well to employ them as judiciously as would Lee or Meade themselves. Unlike any of the C&C clones, manpower in GETTYSBURG can't be replaced. As a result, you can't simply throw units to the winds of war-which puts GETTYSBURG on an entirely different level of real-time gaming. That doesn't mean that the game is complex, however. The interface is warm and inviting, with active buttons large enough to keep confusion down for the novice, and small enough that there's plenty of room for maneuvers on the active game screen. You can deploy troops as skirmishers, have them fix bayonets to hold a position at all costs, or form them into a column to march as briskly down the Baltimore Pike as their fatigue level will allow. units on both sides is directly related to the efficiency its leader showed in real life. Buford's cavalry, for example, moves swiftly and decisively, and takes a great deal of damage before giving ground during the bitter fighting outside Gettysburg on day one of the battle. Other commanders are by turns brilliant, taciturn, or even sluggish, but all are essential to lead troops, and to rally them. The gameplay is simplicity itself: Move by dragging the mouse; fix bayo nets and charge with a click; swing formation left or right with another. Since the interface stays out of your way, succeeding at GETTYSBURG requires only that you think like a Civil War commander. You are forced to ask yourself the tough questions: Where is the dominant terrain, and can my forces secure it? If I stretch his flank farther to the right, will his center lie open for Sickles' thrust? What is A. P. Hill doing behind that ridge? All of these tactical questions must be answered with the clock running. Especially in the early stages of the battle, you are besieged with messages from the front, telling you that reinforcements have arrived, or requesting trest fix 10 els pin de pegg se pre MATIL POUILTSKINI MANTZUVZELOAD wit et ANARCY Arr an kriter EAT A PEACH Whether playing against the Al or a human commander, it's tough to defend the Union salient at Peach Orchard. FUN FACTOR What makes all this work is Sid's uncanny sense of when to add historical flavor, and when to trim realism back to keep the fun factor from lapsing. Civil War aficionados addicted to TalonSoft's award-winning BATTLEGROUND game series will have a few adjustments to make. GETTYSBURG doesn't model in detail every different type of small-arms or cannon weaponry, so you lose a bit of the tactical feel of pitting rifled muskets vs. the smoothbore variety-and you won't find shotguns armed with a mixture of rock salt and nails, as historically happened at Pea Ridge. What you will find is that the moralelcommand system works like a dream. Famous units, such as the Iron Brigade, can anchor your line when most formations, asked to do too much, shatter like 19th-century glass. The élan of Marse Robert's finest is modeled by the increased aggressiveness of Con: federate formations. The responsiveness of Devils ROCKY ROAD Whether infiltrating through trees or firing from behind boulders at point-blank range -it doesn't get much better than Devil's Den. AUGUST 1997 CGW "

Right now, those look to be the obvious: day lets you view the replay in military history map style id Meier is no stranger to real-time games. Hes done flight sims, action/role-playing hybrics, and real-time strategy games, but none since RAILROAD TYCOON. When I remind him of that, he remarks, \"Everyone seems to think that I've gone totally over to tum-based-because of CMLIZATION, I guess but I've always used whatever seemed to be most appropriate. Realtime and tum-based strategy games both have their place; one's not better than the other.\" What Sid wanted to do with real-time in CETTYSBURG was to make the battlefield come alive rather than seem like something from a museum. The vibrancy of realtime is whr  evident in GETTYSBURG than in a multiplayer contest, which brings up another question: Why was Sid so adamant about putting multiplay in GETTYSBURC, when he seemed to think it was a waste of time for his last game, the computer version of Magic THE GATHERING? \"Well, you see,\" he chuckles, \"I'd always thought that multiplayer was more hype than anything else...until I started playing WARCRAFT II with my daughter. We had a great time (she always enjoys beating Dad) and it occurred to me that you could balance a realtime Civil War game between novices and veterans much the same way.\" So, does this mean we'll ever see a multiplayer Civ-style game? Sid won't comment on specific titles, and he implies that there will always be a place for solitaire gamingincluding CVILIZATION and others of its ilk. The glint in his eye, however, betrays his newfound multiplay mojo. We're betting that after SID MEIER'S CETTYSBURC becomes a hit, it will be a long time before this famed designer goes back to solo game designs. SPURAITES!

"PANZER GENERAL 11 Herr General, It Is Time for You to Return to Battle! Fight From Both the German and Allied Sides and Battle Over the Internet in PANZER GENERAL || by Terry Coleman ou wouldn't know it now, with games such as STEEL PANTHERS II and CLOSE COMBAT doing well in the market place, but it wasn't all that long ago-1994-that historical wargaming was in a state of collapse. And while a number of factors turned the genre around, none was more significant than the release of PANZER GENERAL, which featured great campaigns, an aggressive Al, and plenty of period flavor. But what truly set PANZER GENERAL apart was its incredibly focused design. Every time realism and fun clashed, fun won out, and the result was so addictive that novices and hard-core wargamers alike had a great time--even while the latter complained about the lack of realism! In fact, it's fair to say in retrospect that if PANZER GENERAL had been a flop in the marketplace, SSI probably would have gotten out of wargames entirely. Happily, there's no need to speculate as PANZER GENERAL continues to sell more than two years after its release. Anything but a Retread Any time a company tries to update a classic, it walks a tightrope: Change too much, and fans of the original get disen. chanted; approach the design too conservatively, and the new title gets written off as more of the same. So far, the design team at SSI is developing PANZER GENERAL II the right way. If anything, the sequel will be more fun than the original, with-hold on to your Jagdpanther-more than a dash of added realism. The game's mechanics are much the same as before: Move and fight, or blow things up and then move. PANZER GENERAL II can still be played in timeworn turn-based fashion, but building SUITABLE FOR FRAMING Mike Bennighof and Brian Knipple of Avalanche Games (known for their paper wargames) made the accurate maps for PANZER GENERAL II. and SSI's artists enhanced them to yield these scenic battlefield landscapes. CGW AUGUST 1997 "


"on the lessons learned from PANZER GENERAL ONLINE, it can be played in phas. es as well. For example, your opponent can move or fight with four units, and you can respond in kind. This is a lot more manageable for Internet play, especially when you can agree beforehand on the amount of time allotted for moving each unit. Plus, it makes for a lot more tactical intrigue: Should I soften up the town with my artillery, knowing that my enemy will probably move in reinforcements, or blitz with my armor instead? What about infantry support? When should I commit my reserves? All of this becomes much more relevant when you consider that PANZER GENERAL II will have both LAN and Internet support built in, so gamers won't have to join a dedicated games network to play. And unlike the original, PANZER GENERAL II will have at least four sce. narios designed solely for multiplay. A Matter of Scale The biggest change from PANZER GENERAL DO PANZER GENERAL II is that there is now a consistency of scale. Each space represents two kilometers in every scenario. This means that you don't have artillery attacking from one mile away in Poland and four miles away in Russia, as in PANZER GENERAL. Figuring out the exact unit scale is a bit more problematic. I'd put the scale somewhere between STEEL PANTHERS and the original PANZER GENERAL. Order of battle freaks might pull their hair out trying to figure out if the unit scale is a battalion or brigade, but who cares? The more obvious benefit to gamers is that the consistent map scale allows for some of the most beautiful landscapes ever rendered in a computer game of any genre. Gone is the boardgame-on-a-computerscreen look. It is replaced by photorealistic, painstakingly detailed terrain. The game is still played over a hexagonal grid, but it's nearly impossible to tell that it's there when the grid overlay is turned off. Once you've moved your digitized tanks over the vast steppes of Russia or use engineers to bridge one of the exquisitely painted rivers or have your infantry take refuge in really rugged terrain, you'll have trouble going back to the original game. \"What we want is to make you the most important general at the most important point in history. At the same time, we don't want a less subtle game than the original.\" -Rick Martinez, SSI Designer: Rick Martinez, SSI Special Projects Group Publisher: SSI Target Release Date: November, 1997 med 2 Sehend: Sweeping Campaigns As in PANZER GENERAL, the longest campaign in PANZER GENERAL II takes you on a tour of the greater European theater, from Poland and France to North Africa and the Soviet Union. But there are a few very welcome twists on the venerable PANZER GENERAL theme. Your first training mission takes place not near Warsaw, but in the middle of the Madrid Offensive, as you have been secretly sent by the German High Command to test tactics and equipment in the Spanish Civil War. Even after you begin the WWII portion of your European tour, all is not quite as it seems. For instance, a full-scale invasion of Yugoslavia by the forces directly under your command is impractical given the newer map scale in PANZER GENERAL II. So, you take out Tito's partisans and their British allies in a smaller scenario much more brisk than that of PANZER GENERAL. The road from North Africa to Russia is similarly PVN 43 A -11 AUGUST CGW "

The biggest change from PANZER GENERAL IS that because of the smaller scale, some units may shoot farther. Despite any rumors you may have heard, however, infantry may not shoot two or more hexcs. Units with \"big guns, such as the Allied 105mm and the famed Cerman 88, on the other hand, are so empowered. The reason for this is not that these weapons had the farthest range, but that their high velocity gave thema greater effective kill radius. Artillery batteries are occasionally able to shoot farther as well sometimes as far as four hexes. But their main benefit in PANZER GENERAL II comes from their increased range when using defensive fire, which is now two hexes. Plus, multiple artillery pieces can rain fire down on a single attacker, making it tougher than before to take cities when facing wellpositioned artillery. Close assaults now suffer final protective fire from artillery as well. And what of infantry, the sad sack of PANZER CENERAL? In addition to new infantry types (German assault troops, for example), the defensive benefits of terrain are enhanced for all grunts. In particular, artillery using ranged fire has less effect on infantry, due to the troops' dispersal ability Finally, infantry of all types seems to have a >Continued on pg 80 CGW AUGUST 1997 "

"PANZER GENERAL II Continued from pg 78 better chance than in PANZER GENERAL of attacking annor in towns (based on the foot soldiers' experience). Recon style. Overall, the leaders add a nice touch of chrome to PANZER GENERAL II, without the danger of their overwhelming the game, as often happens with the all-powerful heroes of MASTER OF MAGIC. Other nice bits of chrome are the options for fullscreen play along with a boatload of hot keys, both welcome changes from PANZER GENERAL. Currently, the design rewards you with medals when you score multiple Brilliant victories-shades of WING COMMANDER. Best of allthe computer opponent has been much improved. For example, no longer will the Al neglect to escort its bombers. It also won't forget to dismount from vehicles in the face of the enemy, which alone makes a huge difference in the Al's overall effectiveness. The design is still being tweaked at press time, of course. The initiative system, so important to PANZER GENERAL, is currently being modified so that it becomes more dynamic and less predictable in each individual combat. The naval system is using little of the code, but a lot of the added flavor of PACIFIC GENERAL. Antitank units attacking in PANZER GENERAL II don't always lose initiative to tank units-provided they remain sta. tionary. I could go on and on, but the simple fact remains: PANZER GENERAL II is, so far, the perfect blueprint for how to do a sequel. It should be to PANZER GENERAL What Civ II and WARCRAFT II were to their respective originals. Like any Panzer pusher, I can hardly wait for the blitz to begin. units have a more robust role than before. Instead of waiting until the end of the recon unit's movement to utilize its greater search range, you may move it a few hexes at a time, checking for enemies along the way. Of course, if you uncover hidden enemies halfway through the recon unit's move, you still can't take the move back-a nice touch. 1. If you want to get upclose and personal with the stunning maps, run them in full-screen (no obvious interface) and play via hot keys 2. Not only does artillery look more realistic, it now provides defensive fire from two hexes away 3. Tanks that employ high-velocity shells may now attack from two hexes away 4. Roads follow more realistic paths in PG II, and now you only get the road bonus when traveling along the road, not just across it. ROUCH 2020 EUR + 9 na Air units in general are very similar in terms of attack and movement. Where they base, however, is greatly changed from PANZER GENERAL. Airbases are either two-or threc-hex affairs, capable of holding one air squadron per hex. What this means is that the days of having six or seven air units filling up all the available terrain adjacent to cach airbase are over. Plus, airfields may now be destroyed. Challenger A30 Challenger A30 Fu 1:47 AMMO:7 5. Yes, there are still hexes, but this subtle hex outline highlights the active unit without spoiling the rest of the gorgeous map 7. The larger ship silhouette is a legacy from PACIFIC GENERAL. Each vessel, how. ever, still only really occupies one hex on the map. 9. The toolbar interface is much the same as in the original PANZER GENERAL, except for a second \"hidden\" toolbar for less-used functions. Another big change is that there are no medium-or heavy bombers in PANZER GENERAL II. Their main functions, suppressing units for an entire turn and reducing enemy resources, have been taken over by tactical bombers. The irony is that U.S. Marauders and similar aircraft have been reclassified as tac bombers. The designers just wanted to get rid of B-17s and the like, which makes sense, given the smaller scale of PANZER GENERAL II. 6. You can't blithely capture towns deep in enemy territory and immediately crank out new units. This port, though, is close enough to the Allies' front line that they will be able to designate it as a supply point after they capture it. 8. In addition to displaying info on the current unit, this area expands briefly at the beginning of each turn to show how many tums remain for each level of victory. CGW AUGUST 1997 "

"FLIGHT SIM ROUNDUP AIR COMBAT SUMMER PART TWO CGW's Radar Locks on the Next Wave of Flight Simulations BY DENNY ATKIN he next generation of flight sims is about to take wing, loaded for bear with 3D-card support, Internet play, dynamic campaigns, and other often-requested features. World War II and Korean sims are back with a vengeance, and helicopter sims continue to pop up from behind cover. It's looking like a good year for simulation fans. Last month we took first hands-on looks at six hot sims coming for fall. This time, we scope out the rest of the pack, focusing on more than 20 intriguing simulations. In our effort to be all-inclusive, we've tried to pack in all the new details available on each sim. Some entries will be shorter than others, but that doesn't mean these sims are any less enticing-simply that there wasn't as much information available on them. So without further ado, let's launch our recon mission. CGW AUGUST 1997 "


"Jane's Combat Simulations/Origin AH-64D Longbow 2.0 H-64D LONGBOW 2.0, the sequel to 1996's Premier Award-winning AH-64D LONGBOW, is practically a whole new game. This game was designed in large part from feedback the team received from avid LONGBow pilots. An improved graphics engine, a fully dynamic campaign and seamlessly integrated multiplayer play will highlight this updated helicopter sim. LONGBOW 2.0 will include not only the AH-64D but also two new helicopters that you'll need to fly during various missions: the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed reconnaissance helicopter and the UH-60 Blackhawk utility helicopter. On the real battle field these helicopters work together as a team during a battle, and in multiplayer play you'll be able lo re-create this team effort. For instance, you may send OH-58Ds out to the battlefront to scout enemy positions; enemies will go into a joint target database once located. LONGBOW will feature two fully dynamic campaign worlds. One, designed for cooperative play, sends your forces into a near future con flict in the Northern Iraq/Iran/Azerbaijan region. Antagonistic play takes place at the NTC (National Training Center) at Ft. Irwin, California. Both air and ground wars will be taking place, and each team will pilot its own helicopters as well as command Al-flown craft. In the meantime, the ground war will proceed, and as troops advance, each side can gain and lose territories. Re-supply will also be a factor. In addition to actual former Soviet equipment, the NTC uses American helicopters painted and visually modified (or HIND DOWN LONGBOW 2.0 will once again send you against forces flying Russian equipment in the desert, but this time the campaign is dynamic.

"SIM ROUNDUP Sierra/Dynamix Aces: X-Fighters Ithough it builds on the hard work of Dynamix's RED BARON II team, Aces: XFIGHTERS is far from just an excuse to reuse that game's engine. In fact, this World War II air-combat game appears ready to duke it out with FLYING NIGHTMARES 2 for the title of the most innovative flight sim of the year. performing, what operation your squadron is flying, and which air doctrine each side is using. These factors also affect the flow of technology each service will see over the course of the war. It's this technology flow that makes XFIGHTERS Special. Between missions, you can access the Aircraft Designer, where you can VISMOD, as the Army calls it) to appear as enemy equipment. Thus, even though both sides will fly American hardware, one side will appear to be flying Russian helicopters. Up to eight players will be able to participate in games, connecting via local area network, TCP/IP, or modem. In addition, two players will be able to occupy the same helicopter. This will make the helicopter a deadly opponent, as the copilot/gunner can fire on one target using the Longbow's gun while the pilot attacks another using Hellfire missiles. This coordination is proving to be quite a challenge for the Austin Origin Skunkworks team. It's difficult enough to deal with network latency and keep players coordinated when they're in different aircraft. When they share the same cockpit, close timing is a must. The sim's graphics engine has been com pletely rebuilt, with support for a variety of major 3D graphics cards, including 3Dfx. The terrain will sport four times the level of poly. gon mesh detail as the original LONGBOW, SO you'll see far more pronounced irregularities in mountains and other terrain. Roads and land. marks will also be more detailed, and a soft ware filtering effect will get rid of pixelationeven on 2D cards. Complementing all this will be real-time lighting effects that promise to light up the night sky and the hills below with tracers and rocket fire. The sim will also feature a series of training missions, with basic systems and control overviews in the Blackhawk and specific mission training in the appropriate helicopters. Gia tàu | DEAD MAN CRASHING Aces: X-FIGHTERS features an updated version of the RED BARON II graphics engine. Even at its most basic level, X-FIGHTERS is an ambitious simulation. Spanning a period from mid-1940 to early 1946 (the date of the armistice depends on how well your chosen country per forms), the sim lets you fly for Germany, England, or the United States. During that period, you fly in historical operations, including the Battle of Britain, the invasion of Normandy, and Operation Cobra, as well as in speculative battles, such as Operation Sea Lion and the Battle for London. Each operation lasts a variable num. ber of weeks, and the operation that follows is dependent on how well your squadron has per formed. For instance, if you're flying for the Americans and you botch the Normandy campaign, you may end up fighting Operation Sea Lion in 1944 due to your loss in France. The types of missions you'll fly depend on a number of factors, including how well you've been either modify an existing aircraft or take an empty airframe and specify all the details, engine, armor, armament, fuel, and so on. The Designer predicts the plane's performance specs based on the theories of the day (which weren't always accurate when put into practice) and the influence cost of submitting the design (you gain influence points through successful missions). Minor changes, such as putting four 20mm cannon in a Spitfire Mk.I, are inexpensive and will be delivered fairly quickly. \"If, on the other hand,\" says Producer Scot Bayless, \"you start with an airframe that was just developed, stick the hottest new jet engine on it, and load it up with airfoil technologies that have only recently made it out of the lab, you'd better be the fair-haired boy of Fighter Command or you'll never have the influence to get them to build the thing. And even if you do, THE NEXT GENERATION With 3D-card support, LONGBOW 2.0 will provide a dazzlingly realistic environment. This is a very early shot; expect far more dramatic effects in the final version. CGW AUGUST 1997 "

The sim will support most 3D cards through Microsoft's Direct3D. Native support will be provided for cards based on the 3Dfx Voodoo chipset, and possibly for other chipsets as well. X-FIGHTERS is extremely ambitious in scope. If it delivers 90 percent of what it promises, it will go a long way toward making up for the long drought of World War II sims. F-22 Melee LIGHTNING REDUX Novalogic's F-22 RAPTOR promises a much more accurate combat experience than the company's previous effort. There are a number of promising F-22 sims in the works, although the names may change (see \"F-22 Combat Gets Nasty\" in this month's READ.ME section). Interactive Magic's F-22 RAPTOR should be available by the time you get this issue. Impressive terrain graphics, promising flight modeling, and an ambitious dynamic campaign make this worth a close look, check out the preview in the May, '97 CGW for more details. Novalogic is promising that the similarly named F-22 RAPTOR, a sequel to the F-22 LIGHTNING II, will appeal to the serious simulation fans who felt the flight modeling in the earlier sim was a bit too arcade-like. (Given that the company tried to defend the ability of the F-22 in that game to do laws-of-physics. defying Mach 1 flat turns using rudder pedals as being possible with the plane's fly by-wire programmability, we'll reserve judgment until we try it.) Details are still sketchy on this late 1997 release, but Novalogic promises a new, accurate flight model (based on the company's pending cooperative agreement with Lockheed Martin), new missions, MMX enhancements, better multiplayer support, and a Windows 95 executable. Support for 3D cards will likely be AWOL, as Novalogic believes they can achieve equal or better results o without 3D hardware. Finally, there's TFX:F-22 from the UK's Digital Image Design (DID). This sequel to EF2000 will build on the features of the original program and add a new strategic mode that will allow you to sit at an AWACS control station managing the war, and then jump into the cockpit of an F-22 to join the action. The AWACS station has full voice support with a 10.000-word vocabulary. Another promised improvement is a much better ground war than that in EF2000. Not only will tank platoons move to take territory, but when a city is under attack you'll even spot VIPs booking out in limousines, Ground attack modeling will be more sophisticated with collateral damage from explosions. Graphics will feature dazzling lighting and explosion effects, as well as Direct3D support. The most amusing feature of TFX:F-22 has to do with the name it will be sold under in Europe. You guessed it: F-22 RAPTOR. CCW AUGUST 1997 "

"SIM ROUNDUP MicroProse European Air War icroProse's EUROPEAN AIR WAR (EAW), the sequel to 1942: THE PACIFIC AIR WAR (PAW), seemingly dropped off the map after last year's E3 show. The delay was worthwhile, however. The DOS version shown at last year's E3 looked like little more than an SVGA-graphics version of PAW in a different setting. After things settled down from the big MicroProse staff exodus last year, the reconstituted EAW team got to work on moving the game to Windows 95, adding 3D-card support, and making other modifications to ensure that it would be more competitive in today's market. 8 cm you can do the Death Star trench run down the Grand Canyon or buzz imaginary campers in the Smokies.

"SIM ROUNDUP Online Updates PEEL OFF The high-res graphics engine in EUROPEAN AIR WAR has seen a complete rewrite since last year's E3. losing the fight, they're likely to turn tail and run rather than fight to the death. Damage effects are modeled in much greater detail than in the original game. Shoot out the left engine on an Me 110 and you'll see the plane yaw to the side. Damage will affect your own plane's handling as well, and you'll have the option to ditch a heavily damaged plane if you don't want to risk bailing out. Flight models in the alpha version feel pretty good. They may not be as detailed as WARBIRDS on FIGHTER DUEL--you probably won't have to fight accelerated stalls, for instance-but performance differentials between aircraft should be accurately modeled. The cockpit features both fixed views (although, alas, apparently lacking a \"look straight up\" key) and a PAW-style virtual cockpit. The developers have gone to great lengths to capture the mood of the time and locale. When flying for the Luftwaffe, your mission briefings will be in German, with English subtitles In addition to 256-color SVGA, EAW will also support 3D cards through Direct 3D. MicroProse is also considering adding direct support for a couple of popular 3D cards if time permits. nline flight sims will see advances due for a significant update, likely with Direct3D over the course of the year as support, but the biggest enhancements are well.

A dynamic campaign complete with resource management highlights the gameplay improvements; a mission editor will still be available as well.

This time the company is altempting to incorporate the works in the initial release. In addition to a fully dynamic campaign, the sim will feature multiplayer support from the start. What's more, 3D-card support will be built-in, to alleviate the biggest com plaint about FLYING CORPS-slow SVGA-graphics frame rates. The terrain engine has been improved, and the jagged Korean topography should make for some thrilling low-level dogfights. The aircraft lineup is very similar to that found in Virgin's SABRE Ace. You'll be able to fly the F-86 Sabre, F-80 Shooting Star, F-51 Mustang, and MiG-15. Unique to MIG ALLEY, though, is a flyable F-84 Thunderjet. The campaign will be similar in some respects to FALCON 4.0's Korean campaign. You'll choose from a wide range of missions in an attempt to force the North Korean troops back to the Chinese border and win the war before the start of peace talks. Your planning will have direct implications on the future of the war. NECK AND NECK The F-86F Sabre and MiG-15 Fagot in MIG ALLEY are a close performance match.

More than simple wingmen, your teammates are \"artificial pilots\" who have individual traits and characteristics, and who can become fatigued and stressed as the campaign goes on. Think of TEAM APACHE as the first character role-playing simulation. Equipment management also figures into the equation, and you may at times be faced with the prospect of sending pilots up in a damaged bird.

"LOYD CASE HARDWARE teeb U LOCO Shining Light in a Dark Place ach The Heralded Arrival of 3D WinBench 97 by Loyd Case Wouldn't it be great to have a benchmark that did it all right? Guess what? We do. here's an old fairy tale about several blind men trying to describe an clephant. One feels the trunk. and proclaims that the elephant is much like a snake. Another feels a leg and says that the elephant is like a tree. A third feels the elephant's side and suggests that the elephant is like a wall. So it's been with 3D graphics accelerators. I've looked at dozens of 3D accelerators over the past year, and in writing about them it's become clear that the tools to really test 3D accelerators have been limited, to say the least. There are a scant handful of Direct3D games that run on most -but not all of the 3D graphics chips. There are the infamous Tunnel, Tivist, and D3D Test that ship with Microsofts DirectX developer's kit. A couple of vendors have tried to loss out benchmarks, but they've often been less than objective. This serious dearth of both Direct3D games and thorough testing tools has created the need for a comprehensive, objective 3D-benchmark. Its a serious problem. Unlike benchmarking 2D graphics, 3D graphics are much more complex, and no two chipsets have the same features. Some like the Matrox Mystique, sacrifice some image enhancement features in search of better frame rate. Others layer 3D feature sets on top of existing 2D archivertical retrace, which is the gun in your tectures. Some, like 3Dfx and Video monitor that scans back and forth, draw Logic/NEC, focus only on the 3D side ing the pixels on the screen. It scans at of the cquation.

Better yet, a good benchmark before flipping which buffer is onscreen. would notify the user when certain If they didn't, you'd see image \"tearfeatures don't work. ing\" -not a pretty sight. Then there's the issue of performance. \"To address this issue, a benchmark No two games will necessarily generate needs to write to only one buffer. Because the same workload.

"HARDWARE The Need for Speed The New Generation of CPUs Pushes the Gaming Envelope Even Further by Loyd Case and Dave Salvator here's never been a more confusing, yet more exhilarat ing, time to choose a brain for your PC. A couple of years ago, the 486 and the clones from competitors Cyrix and AMD were getting long in the tooth, and the only choice for an upgrade was the Intel Pentium. Then last year, Cyrix fired the first shot across Intel's bow by shipping the 6x86 processor line. At that time, AMD could only offer the anemic K5-which is really only a souped-up 486. But now the landscape is changing. Intel has several viable proces sor families: the P54C (\"classic\" Pentium), the P55C (\"Pentium with MMX Technology\"), the Pentium Pro, and the spanking.new Pentium II (which looks much different from its predecessors, resembling a small plastic cartridge with an edge connector that plugs into a slot on a motherboard called a Slot 1. Naturally, this means that the Pentium II won't run in older motherboards). AMD has launched the K6, a Pentium Pro-class CPU with MMX that fits into the same motherboard socket (Socket 7) as the standard Pentium; and Cyrix is poised to deliver the 6x86MX, touting it as another MMX-equipped Pentium Pro equivalent that also plugs into Pentium's Socket 7. While it's great to have choices, most of us have to vote with real dollars. CPUs are expensive chunks of silicon, and making the wrong choice can seriously bruise a budget. We decided it was time to see how these CPUs really perform. On the old-timers\" list are Intel's P54C\"classic\" Pentium, the Pentium Pro, and the Cyrix 6x86L. The new kids on the block are AMD's K6, which has generated a lot of buzz, the P55C MMX Pentium, and Intel's new baby, the Pentium II. Though we weren't able to get Cyrix's 6x86MX chip in time for testing, we'll still give you the lowdown as to how this chip may have Pentium II looking over its shoulder. Integer performance has often been the primary metric when evalu. ating CPUs, but with the push toward 3D games and accelerators, CPUs' floating point performance has become a much more impor. tant factor in overall performance. With that in mind, we tested both criteria extensively, and the results may surprise you. There are a lot of numbers here, so hold on to your hat as we dive in. CGW AUGUST 1997 "


"How We Tested Plumbing Specifics . We kept the 2D graphics card, 3D accelerator, and DRAM speed and amount the same, since these primary components have the most impact on benchmark results. The components we used to test all CPUs are listed as follows: Benchmarking is fraught with a host of choices, none of them ideal. What methodology produces the most meaningful results? Do you test all CPUs at the same clock rate? This approach might be an interesting test of CPU efficiency, but it's not how gamers buy systems. We ran all the CPUs at their specified clock rates and kept components as similar as possible. But given that the Pentium II and Pentium Pro have different socket and chipset requirements, we used different motherboards for these CPUs.  32MB of 60ns EDO DRAM STB LightSpeed 128 graphics card (Tseng ET6000 chipset) with driver rev. 1.06 AUGUST 1997 CGW cow "


"HARDWARE intel pentium 200 MHz (especially at the fire-sale prices that we've seen recently). Turning to the numbers, P54C easily outpaces AMD's K6 and Cyrix's 6x86L in QUAKE TimeDemo tests. In DUKE NUKEM 3D, it just misses a first place tie with its successor, Intel's P55C, and beats both the Pentium Pro and Pentium II. And while relatively slow on the CPUMark front, it hits the median for the 3D WinBench test, a testament to Intel's strong floating point performance. In USNF '97, the P54C is respectable, pacing its sibling, the Pentium Pro, at about 13 fps. Overall, if you're on a tight budget and don't need MMX capability, the P54C is still a viable-and affordable-option. overall efficiency. Plus, the transistor count has been boosted to 5.5 million transistors. In our benchmarks, the P55C is the fastest 16-bit CPU tested, as evidenced by its WinBench 97 CPUMarks performance, and also in DUKE NUKEM 3D, which makes heavy use of 8. and 16-bit data types. Of the three processors with MMX support, the P55C comes in mid-pack on the REBEL Moon Rising test. It easily bests all of the Socket 7 CPUs on QUAKE and 3D WinBench. Recently, Intel announced that P55C's top-end clock rate would climb to 233MHz, because of improvements to its process technology. If you don't need Pentium Pro performance, or can't bring yourself to spend the additional dollars, then the P55C 20 INTEL 1929 Intel P54C \"Classic\" Pentium The classic Pentium has become some. thing of a stepchild in an incredibly short time. The good thing about this is that prices have dropped radically. With a little careful shopping, you can find a 200MHZ Pentium for under $350. You'd think from Intel's advertising that the Pentium is about ready for CPU heaven, but its performance belies that notion. The 200MHz part still has stronger floating point than either the Cyrix or AMD chips and, when coupled with a 3D accelerator, is still a viable gaming platform intel pentium with MMX-technology Intel P55C Pentium With MMX Technology he P55C is a significantly enhanced Pentium processor that sports twice the L1 cache size (16KB for data, 16KB for instructions, 32KB all told) of the classic Pentium.

Note: These drivers overclock the Voodoo chipset's GRX CLK to 57MHz. Screen Refresh Rate: 75Hz Internal L1 cache sizes were necessarily different, depending on the CPU tested. We used the ABIT ITSH rev 1.5 motherboard with 512KB of L2 cache to test all Socket 7 CPUs: P54C, P55C, K6, and 6x86. We chose the IT5H because it supports all necessary voltages and memory clock speeds for all CPUs. The L2 cache on the Pentium II was 512KB, versus the internal 256KB L2 on the Pentium Pro. To test the Pentium Pro, we used a Micron Millenia Pro with the 440FX chipset. For the Pentium II, we used an Intel-supplied reference system that also uses the 440FX chipset. The Benchmarks three results at each resolution. Because QUAKE's rendering engine is very floating point-intensive, these tests are a good measure of a CPU's bare knuckle floating point performance with no assist from a 3D accelerator. In the game-specific tests, we had audio and joystick enabled, though we didn't always use the joystick. We also used DUKE NUKEM 3D running at 640x480 because of its intense use of 8and 16-bit data types for rendering. We used the fol lowing command-line switches: DUKE3D IM IS3 (L1, and took a frame-rate measurement at the beginning of the level. in Windows 95, we used WinBench 97 CPUMark 16 and CPUMark 32 tests, which rigorously exercise the integer portion of a CPU. To test floating point performance executing 3D rendering through Direct3D, we used 3D WinBench 97. Another floating point intensive test was US NAVY FIGHTERS '97 where we measured frame rate with an F22 sitting on the runway of a custom mission. For this test, we turned sky and water textures off. To test the three MMX-equipped CPUs in this roundup, we used Fenris-Wolf's REBEL MOON RISING, whose rendering engine makes use of MMX for dynamic lighting effects, and for speech recogni tion. We recorded frame rates at the beginning of the first level with MMX both enabled and disabled. For DOS testing, we used QUAKE version 1.07's TimeDemo test, running all three demos at 320x200 and 640x480, and averaging the CGW AUGUST 1997 "

If you do get one of these, make sure your motherboard supports the necessary 75MHz-memory clock speed. is worth a close look. Al 200MHz and above, it's still pretty pricey, but the 166MHz part is available for well under $400. Given Intel's big push on the Pentium II front, it's likely that P55Cs will be available at bargainbasement prices in the next few months. Note that the P55C is a split-voltage CPU, with a 2.8 volt core and 3.3 volt I/O power requirement. If you're considering a P55C, make sure that your motherboard supports this voltage requirement. For only a few dollars more, you can also get OverDrive MMX Pentiums that will run in a wider variety of Socket 7 and Socket 5 motherboards. OS Cyrix 6x86L P200+ ast year, Cyrix and IBM delivered the first strong contender to Intel's Pentium line with the 6x86L. At first glance, it seems quite attractive, selling at a much lower price than the equivalent Pentium. The 6x86L generates stellar results in standard desktop benchmarks, such as WinBench and WinStone. Upon closer examination though, the P200+ turns out to be a poor choice for any gamer not on an extremely tight budget. The benchmarks tell the story. On any. thing with substantial floating point code3D WinBench, QUAKE, or USNF '97 (which is practically a slide show)—the P200+ totters along like Bill Clinton on crutches. Even in 16-bit benchmarks, ostensibly Cyrix's strong suit, it barely reaches parity in CPUMarks, and falls behind in DUKE NUKEM 3D testing. The 6x86L P200+ is a classic example of marketing run amok. The P200+ actually clocks at 150MHz, although the memory bus runs at 75MHz. If this were positioned as a really fast 150MHz part, we might be a little more forgiving, but positioning it against the P54C and P55C 200MHz CPUs is misleading, at best. Unless you're AMD K6 PR200 he K6 is the fruit of AMD's acquisition of NexGen, a CPU design company started by some former Intel CPU engineers. We were pretty eager to check this one out. There's been a lot of heat generated about AMD's latest foray into the processor wars; we hope this will shed a little light on the new developments. At 8.8 million transistors, the K6 is a big chip. It's also the first Intel competitor to support MMX instructions. In one of those odd engineering decisions, the K6 supports a voltage scheme slightly different from Intel CPUs. The K6/200 requires a 2.9 volt core voltage (not 2.8 volts, like the P55C) and a 3.3 volt 1/0 voltage. The K6/233 supports a very odd 3.2 volt core voltage. If you pick up one of these chips, make sure your mother board can handle it. We managed to obtain a K6/200 for our test.

"HARDWARE Intel Pentium Pro 200MHZ AMDT MMX\" ENHANCED PROCESSNCED Performance proves to be an odd mix. Integer performance is certainly close to the 200MHz Pentium Pro, according to WinBench 97, but its Achilles' heel is floating point (though the FPU is still far superior to Cyrix's P200+). Floating point intensive benchmarks lag behind all of the Intel processors. QUAKE, 3D WinBench, and USNF '97 all run slower than even the P54C. Oddly, even DUKE NUKEM 3D also runs slightly slower than on the Pentium processors. Our sole MMX benchmark, REBEL MOON RISING, also runs a little slower than the P55C However, please note that although the ABIT BIOS officially supports K6, we ran Several AMD utilities that enabled K6's write back allocation caching. Since the K6 is cheaper than the P55C, it's still a great choice for someone who has modest floating. point needs but demands terrific integer performance (strategy game players, for example). Note that Ko's floating point is not egregiously bad-it's about equivalent to a 166MHz Pentiumbut if you're a serious Quake-head, or if you play similar games (and you can afford it), the Intel CPUs give you more floating point and MMX punch. The K6 is a worthy competitor to the Pentium line, and even pushes a bit into Pentium Pro territory. But, unfortunately, the AMD marketing folks are taking what would be a great Pentium upgrade and trying to position it against the Pentium II. Finally, we're more than a little annoyed that AMD chose odd voltage requirements for the K6, which makes motherboard selections more restrictive. By now, the K6/233 should be shipping in quantity. Be sure to check AMD's Web site (www. amd.com) and the motherboard manufacturer to make sure you have the right board for your k6. hen Intel's Pentium Pro debuted, this first P6-generation chip was remarkable for a couple of reasons. It was the first X86 CPU to put the Level 2 (L2) cache inside the chip itself, and it also ran the L2 at the CPU core's clock speed, rather than at memory bus speed. P.Pro was also the first Intel chip to reduce X86 CISC (Complex Instruction Set Code) instructions to smaller, RISC-like (Reduced Instruction Set Code) instructions for faster execution. But the chip has also had its problems: Despite blazing 32-bit performance, its 16-bit performance is actually slower than standard Pentium chips, and unlike the P55C and Pentium II, P-Pro lacks the MMX instruction set. On the upside, P-Pro is a very able floating-point performer, and turned in generally favorable numbers in our testing, trailing only the Pentium II in many tests. In DOS, the P-Pro fared well in QUAKE TimeDemo and CBench tests, though its DUKE NUKEM 3D performance was the slowest of the lot, owing to DUKE's reliance on 8. bit and 16-bit data types for rendering.

"HARDWARE Short-term Memory CPU Level 1 cache TIT To deliver speedy performance, CPUs need to be smart about how they cache information. Caches work based on theories pioneered by Hungarian Computer Scientist and Game Theorist John von Neumann. He determined that recently-used information will more than likely be used again in the near future, so it makes sense to keep some of it close at hand. A CPU first puts instructions and data into the Level 1 (L1) cache, located onboard the processor itself. When the L1 cache lines are full, the CPU moves information to the Level 2 (L2) cache, and when that's full, to system RAM.

"HARDWARE performance, this is not an ideal chip for gamers. But for current P-Pro owners, there's good news: Intel is planning a P.Pro OverDrive upgrade chip with MMX technology that will ship early next year. intel PENTIUM PRO INTEL '94 95 1.PRO exception flag may not be returned as well. Conversion of such high values is relatively rare, and Intel has acted quickly to test mainstream applications to see if they're affected, and the initial finding is that this \"flag erratum\" shouldn't pose a problem for games. Intel has posted testimonial statements on their web site (www. intel.com) from a phalanx of software developers, including John Carmack of id Software, who stated that the flag erratum \"...has no impact whatsoever on QUAKE.\" EA echoed the sentiment, stating that \"...this erratum does not negatively impact any of our entertainment software titles.\" Both the Pentium Pro and Pentium II executed all of our tests without a hitch and, for the most part, turned in top-flight num. bers. And while this bug could possibly affect some future game title, for now, that seems unlikely. At some point in the near future, the P. Pro will be phased out of Intel's line-up in favor of the MMX-equipped Pentium II. Also, P-Pro uses the Socket 8 form factor, and there probably won't be many options for AGP Socket 8 motherboards when AGP shows up later this year. Given P-Pro's planned retirement, and its spotty 16-bit in dead last, and in the USNF '97 test, P. Pro was no faster than the P55C. There's a recently discovered bug in the Pentium Pro and Pentium II that Intel has dubbed the \"flag erratum.\" though some may know it as \"Dan-0411.\" The error occurs when performing floating point to integer conversions of very large (80-bit) floating point values. The problem is that these floating point values are sometimes too large to fit within the storable range of integer values. When such a conversion happens, the CPU should return a value and flag this conversion as an exception.\" The problem is that the value is returned, but the Intel Pentium II 233MHz ntel's latest creation, the Pentium II, marks a milestone in CPU evolution in several ways. Its new Slot 1 form factor will allow Intel to scale P-ll's clock speed to 300MHz with the current design, and to a blistering 400MHz when Intel moves Pull to a 0.25-micron design process later this year. Unlike its predecessor, the P-Pro, Pll has an external L2 512KB cache, which lives on a daughtercard with the CPU. Intel chose this layout to reduce costs, while the L2 could have its own bus instead of making it share bandwidth with the main memory bus. This is so the L2 could run at half the CPU'S core clock speed, rather than at the 66MHz clock speed of the main memory bus. Now for the bad news. Pll is the only Slot 1-compatible CPU out there, and Intel's main competitors, AMD and Cyrix, may have difficulty producing Slot 1-compatible CPUs owing to certain legal restrictions surrounding the new form factor. AMD and Cyrix are banking on their price/performance advan. tage and the wealth of Socket 7 WINBENCH. 97 CPU WIn Mark Tests CPU 32 .

HORAIOVORE Top Notch Simulation More than 1200 players Cyrix 6x86MX long with AMD Cyrix is set to square H off against Intel in the CPU arena with its new 6x86MX (formerly known as the M2) proces sor. This design takes Cyrix's 6x86L processor core and makes several important architectural enhancements, most notably quadru. pling the unified L1 cache from 16KB to 64KB and giving the chip's floatingpoint unit its own dedicated cache bus. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get even a prototype chip in-house in time to be tested, but let's take a look at how the 6x86MX's design may make it a viable Intel alternative for gamers. The 6x86MX will debut with three different speed options: 150MHZ (PR166), 166MHz (PR200), and 200MHz (PR233). The PR numbers refer to the chips' performance equivalence to Intel processors at that clock speed. Cyrix is billing the 6x86MX as a competitor to both Intel's P55C and P-II. We hope (unlike its 6x86L P200+ ), Cyrix won't position the 6x86MX too high. The jury is still out until we can get an actual Chip and put it through its paces. Cyrix has implemented a much-needed enhancement to the 6x86L core design: improved floating-point performance. As seen in our tests, the 6x86L fares very poorly in floating point-inten sive tests, not only well behind the Pentium Pro and P-II, but also significantly slower than both the P54C and P55C. Apparently, the 6x86L'S FPU shares its L1 cache data path with the CPU's bus interface, and the FPU stalls if the bus interface is using the cache when the FPU's cache request occurs. To address the problem, the 6x86MX'S FPU now has its own dedicated cache bus, so both the FPU and the bus Detailed News Stories Blockbuster trades, perefect games, injuries, MVPS motherboards out there to help find homes for their K6 and 6x86MX processors. As for future generation chips from these two companies, we'll just have to wait and see. Although a Slot 1 motherboard essentially marries a gamer to Intel CPUs (for now), the upside is speedy performance across the board. A look at the numbers tells the story. In DOS, P.Il smokes all contestants in QUAKE'S TimeDemo tests, though its perfor mance in DUKE NUKEM 3D underwhelms, owing to Pull's 32-bit optimization and Duke's use of 8and 16 bit data types for rendering. In Windows 95, P.Il clearly dominates across the board, and it beats all comers in every test we can throw at it. What proves interesting is P.ll's 16-bit perfor mance-a place where the P-Pro stumbles. Pull takes first place in WinBench 97's CPUMark 16 test, thanks to architectural enhancements Intel added to address P-Pro's shortcoming in this area. In USNF '97, P.II again finishes well ahead of the competition, and its MMX performance in REBEL MOON Rising ranks also as the best of the lot. Granted, AMD's K6 will fare slightly better when it's at clock parity with the 233MHz P.II, but even then the P.11 will still most likely have the edge. AMD will have a price advantage, but it comes close to matching Pull only in its MMX performance. And system vendors are already offering 233MHz and 266MHz P.Il systems at very aggressive prices.

"HARDWARE Cyrimo mesta PROCESSOR oomph for high-performance 3D games. The 6x86L is clearly not a viable choice for anything that requires floating-point perfor mance-which rules out many 3D games and simulators. Given the bargain prices on classic Pentiums, Cyrix's 6x86L is an even less desirable choice. The P55C is a good balance of price and performance, especially since its price will continue to drop. If you're set to build the fastest hot-rodrig, and are prepared to pay up, then by all means, go for the Pentium Il--but be aware that you will likely want to swap motherboards and graphics cards in a few months when AGP arrives in the stores. Given the pricing on the Pentium II, we don't suggest getting a Pentium Pro; for roughly the same cost, with the PIl you get MMX support, better 16-bit performance, and faster clock rates. We are somewhat surprised at the minor performance differential, given that Pentium II's L2 cache runs at a slower speed than that of the Pro. Another important consideration is motherboard support. If you have an older sys. tem, it probably won't even support the P54C at a 200MHz clock speed. Before you decide to go with any CPU upgrade, make sure you check with both the CPU vendor and motherboard vendor to make sure it's properly supported. The Pentium II will become the premium choice in just a few months, when the new 440LX chipset ships on AGP-enabled moth. e rboards. Of course, that will mean a new motherboard, CPU, and graphics card. But the good news here is that the rate of hardware change may finally level off just a bit. A Pentium 11/266 AGP system with a fast 3D accelerator may actually be able to run most games for the next 18 months or so. Imagine that.

Given the number of 3D games in the works, with their ever-growing polygon counts, the 6x86MX will have to deliver at least nearly equal floating point performance to the Pentium II in order to be truly competitive. On paper, the 6x86MX looks promising, and if its architectural enhancements deliver on their promises, Cyrix could have a seri ous contender on its hands. The 6x86MX will also have a price advantage and its Socket 7 form factor, pro. vided motherboard vendors support its clock multipliers and memory bus speedsand most probably will. Its integer performance will most likely be nipping at the heels of a similarly clocked P-II (233MHz), but the 64KB question is whether the 6x86MX's floating performance will stack up well.

These cards demonstrated what a high-performance 3D accelerator could deliver to the gaming experience. But there were several problems with these carly cards. First, most of these 3D-only boards were priced above $300, and required a dedicated PCI slot. Finally, they could only run fullscreen-there was no 3D in a window.\" Wouldn't it be great to get Voodoo performance in a 2D/3D single card, at a reasonable price and get 3D in a window?

"***** REVIEW  SSI PRODUCTS MTS-100 Is More Better? HARDWARE by Dave Salvator ather than doing garden-variety 21 satellite-woofer systems, SSI instead makes 5.1---left, right, center, left-surround, right-surround, and woofer Dolby Pro Logicenabled speaker systems. But what's really remarkable about their latest offering, the MTS-100 system, is its $179 price. While the documentation is a bit sparse, it shows pretty clearly how to configure the MTS-100 for either Dolby ProLogic, or Dolby Multimedia Surround. In the Pro Logic setup, the surround speakers get placed behind you, whereas the Multimedia Surround configuration places the surround speakers just outside the left and right speakers. Once you've placed the spcakers and plugged everything in, MTS-100 has a \"test tone\" sequence that sends pink noise through each four satellite channel (the two rear speakers receive the identical signal), allowing you to set levels for the center and surround speakers; this also lets you tweak the woofers crossover frequency. In a poor design choice, controls are mounted on the front of the woofer, making you crouch to change any settings. So how do the MTS-100s sound? We A/Bed them against Cambridge Soundworks' Microworks, a favorite from our recent speaker roundup. Using the MTS100s Prologic setting, the overall sonic image is good, with very beefy bass, and fairly well-defined mid-range. The highend treble is a bit muddly compared to Cambridge, but is passable. The Prologic on stereo signals adds clepth to the overall image, creating an added expansiveness. Game audio sounds fine, and even perks up QUAKES somewhat unremarkable sound effects. We were expecting spicier audio in COMMANCHE 3 and WING COMMANDER IV, both of which use Dolby Multimedia Surround. But, neither the Prologic nor the Surround setting really enhances the audio compared to going through regular stereo speakers. Another concern is whether a 5.1 speaker setup will muddy imaging of 3D positional sound cards beginning to ship that expect two speakers. MTS-100's 5.1 channel setup may not combine well with these boards. Nonetheless, this is an impressive system that sounds good, comes in under $200, and will certainly improve your rigs audio if you're enduring the agony of dixie-cup speakers. & APPEAL: Gamers looking for big sound from more than two speakers.

Notables on this Plug-and-Play (PnP) ISA board include a 4MB General MIDI wavetable patch set, 64-note polyphony, and adjustable four-speaker output that provides a 3D surround\" cffect. Windows 95 installation is certainly painless enough: Plug in the board, bring up your system, feed the driver CD, and Game Theater 64 is ready to roll, sans reboot. An additional install adds DOS utilities for running in exclusive MSDOS mode, but the DOS drivers are added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT, and not to the DOSSTART.BAT, the file Windows 95 uses when rebooting in MS-DOS mode. The good news here is exclusive MS-DOS mode. Win-95 audio is pretty clean as well, and the General MIDI is also very convincing, All told, Ubi Soft has put together a solid offering that covers the traditional bases well, and brings some new things to the party, all for under $200. If you're looking to upgrade an aging sound card, take a listen to Came Theater 64, and soak up the sound. that these drivers initialize the board and then exit, leaving no memory footprint Game Theater 64s configuration utility lets you enable or disable four-speaker support and adjust the overall «surround\" cffect. You can add chorus, reverb, and ccho if you want. A small amount of echo makes gaming audio scem a bit bigger.\" But, tuming on these effects also adds an audible, allcit faint, amount of hiss. Also included with Came Theater 64 is a full version of Ubi Soft's own POD, that takes advantage of Game Theater's 3D audio features. In the works is a driver to support Microsoft's DirectSound 3D API, using two or four speakers. The digital audio performance is solid in DOS titles, including QUAKE and NovaLogic's COMMANCHE 3.

"***** REVIEW THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN DIFFICULTY LEVEL Lost Gameplay ADVENTURE/RPG More Proof That Great Movies Don't Always Make Great Games by Robert Coffey dd THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN to the list of movic-to-game casualtics. Psygnosis has taken a wholly original film and gutted it of almost everything that gave it worth. Laden with a cumbersome interface and frustrating gameplay, yet blithely unburdened with any semblance of story, character, challenge, or rudimentary gaming satisfaction, THE CriY OF LOST CHILDREN trumpets its originality while delivering nothing more than pretty pictures. Wema INSIDE JOB More than half the game focuses on Miette robbing rooms like this without advancing the plot in the least. EMPTY CITY THE Criy OF LOST CHILDREN looks great. Rich graphics capture the oppressive world of Miette, the twelve-year-old orphan at the games center. Forced to steal by Pieuvre, her evil Siamese-twin heaclmistress, Mictte scampers across a decaying waterfront city and uncovers the truth behind a series of child kidnappings. A variety of camera angles highlights the game's beauty while ably emphasizing the vulnerability of tiny Miette as she moves in believable motion-captured animation. Unfortunately, too many of the lush visuals are wasted in numerous non-interactive transition screens But the outstanding graphics cannot disguise a game that is hollow at its core. Astonishingly, the game designers have managed to take a cast of wholly unique characters --including the headmistress, cyclopean thugs, a mad scientist stealing children's dreams, and a brain living in an aquarium--and deliver a product absolutely devoid of plot and character. More than half the game passes before the alleged storyrevealed in lackluster, non-interactive cut-scenes-actually kicks in, and then it is paid even less lip service than the latest Pauly Shore vehicle. Price: $43 Minimum System Requirements: DOS 6.22 or later: 486DX4/100 (Pentium 75 recommend ed): 8MB RAM (16MB recommended): 45MB hard disk space (500MB for full install); SVGA graphics; 2x CD-ROM drive (4x recommended): Sound Blaster-compatible sound card. Multiplayer Support: None Designers: Laurent Cluzel, Jesus Martinez, Eric Metens, Phillipe Tesson. Publisher: Psygnosis Foster City, CA (800) 438-7794 www.psygnosis.com Reader Service #: 332 STUMBLING IN THE DARK THE CTYOF LOST CHILDREN is further encumbered with a remarkably clunky interface. Everything is controlled by keyboard, which results in finicky, imprecise movement that altemates between plodding and maniacally uncontrollable. Talking to characters or using objects requires lining up Mictte just right (or else nothing happens). Going upstairs is particularly tedious as Miette bums ten seconds or so finding that perfect line before trudging on her way. The unfriendliness of the interface is echoed in the elements of gameplay. Essential items are frequently hidden entirely from view, forcing you lo fumble your way through clutter and inky shadows until you finally stumble upon them. This, coupled with the unwieldy controls, would make a game of hunt the pixel\" a welcome relief The game's biggest transgression occurs at the very end. What little story there is gets resolved entirely without any input from the gamer. With gameplay as skimpy and short as it is in Criy, rudely snatching the culmination of the player's efforts away from him is inexcusable. You're not the herothe game is. One more thing The Crie OF LOST CHILDREN is guilty of one of the most jarringly inappropriate, unfounded, and simply distasteful actions I've seen in a game. Miette murders an innocent man for his watch. It makes absolutely no sense in the context of the game for a sympathetic child, acting under the honorable impulse of wanting to rescue other exploited children, to casually kill this wholly unthreatening man. The story lays no foundation for this sudden, casy brutality, and it is doubly confounding considering that the myriad characters responsible for Miette's miserable life go unpunished. Visually rich but gaming poor, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN really isn't worth visiting APPEAL: Fans of the film who can stomach the perversion of inspiration. PROS: Beautifully rendered environments create an appropriately seedy mood; lifelike animation of heroine. CONS: Bad game controls; fails to utilize film's unique characters or plot; dull object-fetching gameplay, game resolution denied gamer. CGW AUGUST 1997 "

"SPECIAL ADVERTISING SUPPLEMENT SOLO TM Java computing in the real world "


"SPECIAL ADVERTISING SUPPLEMENT Java\" computing in the real world You've seen it on your screen, heard about on the tube. It's Java computing and it's going to rock your world. That's because Java computing is one of those breakthrough technologies that changes everything. And, for once, things are changing for the good! Java computing's origins lie on the corporate flank of our society, funded and nurtured by large organizations with big problems to solve and big budgets to devote to their efforts. Already the Java platform has ventured spectacularly far from its beginnings in just two years the Java language has gained momentum in the business world much faster than either Windows or the Macintosh did. And now, it's going to start to change things in your computing world as well. w Why is Java computing different? . Applet Runs on a web browser (or applet viewer) with strictly limited host access. Unlike an application, an applet normally can't read or write files on the local system. ecause it was conceived and built to be a totally platform-neutral computing environment, unwilling to be wedded to (or limited by) any of the many proprietary computing platforms we've had to choose from in the past, such as Windows or the Macintosh. The Java platform will change the way you buy and use applications and it'll bring dimension, depth and vast shopping opportunity to the Internet and the World Wide Web. The Java environment is kind of like a uniform: every individual wearing it is unique and idiosyncratic, but when in uniform they all look the same. What's more, they've all agreed to interact in certain ways, so no matter how different they are beneath their uniforms, they'll be able to communicate and work together. Similarly, a program written in the Java language will run wherever a Java platform is present. It doesn't matter whether the underlying proprietary environment is Windows, the Mac, or UNIX. The Java platform acts as a standard, uniform programming interface to Java applets and applications running on any hardware. Because Java computing is platformneutral, Java applets can run in any Java enabled web browser, like Netscape Navigator Microsoft's Internet Explorer or Sun Microsystems' new HotJava Browser. which makes Java computing perfect for the World Wide Web, where the same program needs to be capable of running properly on any computer in the world. The Java platform is unlike anything that's come before, with capabilities for software engineers that make it easier to turn out more applications with fewer bugs in less time. That means better, more creative apps. But that's not all, not by a long shot. Java computing is transforming the web with new kinds of websites and new kinds of information. In the Java environment, you download not just information or graphics. but also the software tools that allow you to manipulate your new information. So, for instance, a map you might download will automatically include a viewer. Or a mortgage application sent to you online might have a Java based rate calculator applet built right in. There's more: Java computing's highperformance security capabilities help make the World Wide Web safe for electronic commerce. Java computing will make web shopping an everyday event. And finally, Java computing won't be limited to your desktop, or even your notebook computer. The Java platform will soon be embedded into all manner of machines: cellular phones, pagers, TV set-tops, game machines. Nowhere is the potential of the Java platform being exploited more dramatically than with what's called smartcards. So read on to find out how Java computing will help shape your future.... Application Typically launched from the desktop and enjoying more or less unrestricted access to the local system. S2 "


"Why Java computing is part of your Future desktop computer? If it doesn't yet, it will soon, because online services cost them less than human tellers (and online services don't need to sleep at night like people do). Travelocity keeps moving with Java Computing TRANSFORMING THE WEB hether you know it or not, you've probably already encountered the Java platform. The Java Virtual Machine has been incorporated into all major web browsers, so your ability to traverse Java computing worlds is likely part of your computing environment already. Thanks to its virtual machine orientation, the Java platform's tightly-designed set of bytecodes make programs easy to transport across the Internet. Java computing encourages production of reliable, simple code and its object and component orientation promotes re-use and library-building. Already, hundreds of thousands of programmers have learned the Java language and have begun churning out applets and Java based websites that are transforming the Internet. \"Java,\" notes Ken Nicolson, vice president of marketing at KIVA Software Corp., \"is facilitating the rapid adoption of the Internet as a primary source for any type of information gathering and distribution, customer empowerment through self-service applications and as a viable point-of-sale vehicle for all kinds of products and services.\" The number and variety of Java enabled websites keeps growing and growing. Here's a taste of what's out there. Travelocity (http://www.travelocity.com) Is the leading provider of travel reservation and destination Information on the Internet, with a user base in excess of 750,000 registered members. Co-created by Worldview Systems and SABRE Interactive, Travelocity Integrates destination information collected from 85 travel correspondents and 5,000 electronic sources with SABRE Interactive's reservation system containing schedules for 700 airlines, 32,000 hotel properties and more than 50 car rental companies around the world. Despite a superior booking system, Travelocity's website was way too static and it was getting too slow. \"We needed to have better direct database access for delivery of Information on the fly,\" says Neal Checkoway, president of Worldview Systems. \"At peak times, typically around noon, things would slow down appreciably.\" To create a richer, more interactive experience on its website, which averages over a million hits a day and more than nine million page views a month, Worldview needed to quickly add new functionality, boost performance and also provide ample room for future growth. The solution was Java computing and a little help from KIVA Software, a leading provider of Internet application servers. Unlike earlier versions of Travelocity, in which data was static, you can now access content generated dynamically from Travelocity's numerous databases. And these days, Travelocity delivers quick response times even under peak loads. Thanks to its Java environment, Worldview's developers can also quickly alter the application's look and feel or update business logic so your experience of the site will always be leading edge. A BETTER DESKTOP The Java platform is also being used to make it easier to use productivity software. Look for new desktop computing applications that are Java based and able to liberate you from the restrictions imposed by platform-specific computing. Corel Office for Java (http://officeforjava. corel.com), a suite of office productivity applications written in the Java language, runs on any environment with a Java Virtual Machine or JavaOs platform. Because the client side of Corel Office for Java has won 100% Pure Java certification, all documents are readable and editable across all platforms. So, for instance, you can send a document you create using Corel Office for Java on your IBM PC to your friends who prefer a Mac environment and they'll be able to open it, read it, edit it. Without having to convert any files or hassle with the loss of formatting \"Java computing's unprecedented crossplatform support and distributed architecture make all of this possible,\" says Corel Technology Evangelist Chris Biber. \"Basically, Java computing has changed all the rules.\" Many other vendors are developing Java language applets and applications that businesses will use on the Internet and dedicated corporate networks to sell you products and services and keep you happy after you buy.

"POD REVIEW ***** Space Race DIFFICULTY LEVEL ACTION Pod Takes Road-racing to Another World by Joe Vallina 78 100320 Laps OU 105 here's nothing quite like screaming down the highway at 170 mph with no brakes, knowing that if you lose the race you'll also lose your seat on the last shuttle off a dying planet. This is the basic premise of POD, the futuristic racing game from Ubi Soft. POD sports some great gameplay and 3D graphics, with eight coollooking, futuristic cars and 16 difficult tracks that pit you against your fellow would-be-escapees in original, sometimes bizarre alien settings. CHOP SHOP All of the cars can be fully customized, according to your own preferences regarding speed, brakes, acceleration, grip, and handling. The customization is based on a total score of 300. You can boost any of the car's features up to a maximum value of 100, but only if you reduce another of the cars attributes. So, if you want to boost your speed four points, you have to take away four points from another parameter. The game lets you customize cars between each race (with the exception of games where you let the computer randomly pick the car for you), and it behooves the driver to match the car to the course. If the upcoming race is on a particularly curvy track, for instance, you should probably reduce your car's speed and boost its handling. Conversely, on a track with a lot of straight stretches, the more speed the better. Unlike some racing games, in POD, your opponents' performance isn't based on your own. This means that you shouldn't expect the other drivers to slow to a crawl just because you've had a spin out. The Al takes no prisoners, and if you plan on beating any of the computer drivers on the advanced level, you had better have a lot of practice laps under your belt. 4-020SKenich 5). 03 08 Marco There are three ap 1/6 6), 03'08 lurkpad 1), 01'08 S tr. damage levels for 8), 03 \"080/amond the cars: off, global, and sector, and there are pit stops strategically placed around the courses to fix things should you get too far into the red.

At the start of MDK (Playmates Interactive), your character appears on the great metal ball that tops the \"i\" in Shiny.

Afterward, you're off on a REBEL ASSAULT like bombing mission that allows you to clear out an arena from the air before you explore it on foot. After that you're glued to a moving platfom -sometimes steerable and sometimes not-as siiping enemies hover around you.

From the opening screen, which features your character lying atop the title letters rather in the manner of Playboy pictorials, MDK is imbued with an indomitable spirit of fun. One power-up nins away from you screaming like an agitated chimpanzee. A particularly brazen variation on Star Trekaction-music accompanies the first segment of the second level and its James Bond equivalent surfaces as you surf the halls on the fourth. The decoy power-up is a pathetic caricature drawn by hand on what appears to be a mylar balloon. Not to mention that the towns you're defending are barely drops in the bucket (I mean, Sparrow Pit, England?). be nice if the game offered some additional enticement beyond a congratulations screen, for saving the town (perhaps a bonus level?).

Sometimes, I couldn't load saved games, either Though it is a DOSMin95 hybrid game, I recommend playing in Windows 95 only. ECSTATICA II could have been a contender.

The fighting is quite fierce, as the enemy Al is smart enough to attempt to surround you. The most bothersome feature about fighting is that some of the encmies, such as spiders and fish, have extremely fast attacks. You hardly have time to move at all, which makes fighting frustrating at times. Also, another slight annoyance is the fact that enemies are completely randomized.

The game is solid, but cast in the shadow of LINKS LS and Accolades JACK NICKIAUS 4, its somewhat unspectacular. Still, several items make this simulation special.

Finally, it heralds the return of designer Rex Bradford, creator of the infamous swing meter,\" first used in Accolades MEAN 18.

Graphics are well drawn and feature quick redraws between strokes, but beyond a few patches of trees and bushes, both courses are quite flat and barren, giving the game a somewhat desolate look and feel. Digitized backdrops featuring castles, large spectator stands, and cranc-mounted \"TV camera stands accentuate the feeling of isolation. It's almost eerie.

However, all humans have to compele on the same machine, as the game completely lacks remote multiplayer capabilities, such as serial, modem, or network links. Came styles include practice, stroke, best ball, match, and multi-round tournaments. Play mechanics are similar to most new golf sims, with an adjustable directional arrow and 3D swing meter. The meter is unique because it realistically clepicts the speed of both the backswing and power (snap) of your stroke. The latter is particularly difficult to gauge, because the velocity of the meter incrcascs significantly as it nears the bottom \"sweet spot.\" The tendency is to click way late, thereby producing one terrible slice after another. Simply hitting the ball straight is the games biggest initial challenge. Beginners can compensate by overadjusting the direction of their aimn. On the other hand, the calibrated putting meter is one of the best I've ever seen. commentary by vctcran sportscaster Jim McKay. Boasting more than 5,000 unique phrases, McKay's play-by-play is almost frighteningly cognizant of your actions-it chides bad shots, mocks you for taking too much time, and accurately reflects on your previous strokes. More so than any other golf sim, the reactive crowd and interactive caddie are definitely not window dressing, but rather totally integrated into play.

"***** REVIEW  DARKLIGHT CONFLICT DIFFICULTY LEVEL Shallow Space SIMULATION/SPACE This Attempt at a Space Sim Is a Day Late and a Dollar Short by Martin E. Cirulis COMMANDER series, DC never really rises above this bare-minimum premise. The campaign itself is not dynamic, and the storyline is basically a paragraph intro for every mission. While this is by no means a fatal flaw for a sim, the way DC handled it was just the first clue that this was not going to be the most in-depth and detailed game. Of course, if the plot is weak, then the hope is that the flight engines and missions will cover the price of admission. And, to be honest, my initial reaction was very good, but this enthusiasm rapidly waned. DO SPACE JOCKEYS DESERVE FRIENDS? he sci-fi flight sim business is a tough one to break into. Between Origins WINC COMMANDER and LucasArts' Star Wars sims, a newcomer really has to shine to break the monopoly that those games have on the fans out there. A game needs to have depth, high-end graphics, and enough style to carve its own niche in a gamer's mind. Some fair third-party sims have come and gone over the years, but nonc has really been able to tie all those elements together well enough to create more than a ripple in the computer gaming ocean. Luckily, the dearth of mulitplayer capability in space sims has created another way for a new game to get attention, and DARKLICHT CONFLICT looks very much like it was designed to take advantage of this situation. hile some kind of multiplayer capability has been fairly standard in PC Night sims going all the way back to FALCON 3, fans of sci-fi flight sims have had a long cold wait for the chance to go up against their buda dies in the deep black-much less fly with them cooperatively. While there doesn't seem to be any good reason for this lack of multiplayer support, as space sims often present less design difficulties than atmospheric flight sims, since they don't require gravity vectors and large terrain, designers have shied away from this option in the past. The first real attempt to bring social gaming to the spacelanes was ARMAN from Origin. This sim tried to mesh to concept of head-to-head dogfighting with a very basic spaceploitation game. Unfortunately, while it was an interesting attempt to mesh genres, the sim portion of the game suffered much the same problems as today's DARKLIGHT CONFLICT: It looked great, and flew stupid. Fortunately, with the arrival of X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER, there seems to be some recognition of the fact that adding a multiplayer suite doesn't mean you can skimp on gameplay Of these three times to date anyone has tried to incorporate multiplay, two of them, including DARKLIGHT CONFLICT, have resulted in less-than-stellar results. Are we finally entering an age where space-sim fans can expect the same level of connectivity that other genres enjoy in the late '90s? One can only hope...and per haps someday. Origin will take another stab at making their epic Wing COMMANDER universe a social engagement, just as LucasArts has done with the Star Wars series. Designers trying to roust some market share from the Big Wo in space sims would do well to take note of recent develop ments, and realize that to succeed they have to do more for gamers, not less and give space jockeys a good reason to be social CONFLI MORE ALIEN ABDUCTORS The premise for DC is interesting, but not devastatingly original. You are a fighter pilot who is abducted right out of your F-18 cockpit by some very rude aliens, who are looking to scoop some warm, skilled bodies for their nasty little war. After radically altering you to jack into one of their cybernetic fighters, they quickly start your training without even asking you if you resent having lost your normal life. Supposedly, if you win the war, you'll be returned to your old self and sent back to Earth. (Of course, I'd hate to be the defense lawyer at your AWOL court martial!) And wouldn't you know it, before you can finish your job, skulduggery rears its ugly head and a little wackiness ensues.

With a little more detail, a better AI, and a 1996 release date, this game could have gotten higher marksbut the simple, ugly truth is that there is just better fare out there now. It would be nice to see these kind of graphics in a deeper game, but for now I suspect that most gamers just don't have the money to try and eke out enjoyment from a second-rate effort like this one. SIMULATIONISPACE FLOATING POINTLESSLY DARKLIGHT CONFLICT can't overcome a shallow premise and poor gameplay in order to compete in 1997. defensive missions, where you fight from some kind of turret floating in space, but the poor Al defeats much of the thrill in this, especially in the turret missions, where the enemy ships just fly right into you if you aren't quick enough to get out of their way. The multiplayer capability of this game alleviates some of the problem concerning the weak Al, but a universe where only the human players fight well still gets old fast. A more robust multiplayer suite, with a large number of sccnarios and some sort of mission builder could have helped a bit, but in the end it probably still wouldn't be enough in a world where X-WING VS. TIE FICHTER exists. The days when a space sim could get by on looks and depend on simple connectivity as a hook have probably passed forever, thanks to LucasArts upping the ante. APPEAL: For space pilots whose only intention is for multiplayer action, and can't find a copy of XWING VS.TIE FIGHTER. PROS: Excellent graphics; some nice details; good tutorial. CONS: Lousy manual; lousy flight Al; repetitious gameplay; simple multiplayer suite not enough to save this one from the bargain bin. RATEL teraT GOLDEN GATE geange Forget about leaving your heart.

"**** REVIEW BATTLEGROUND 7: BULL RUN DIFFICULTY LEVEL No Bull Here STRATEGYZWARGAMES TalonSoft Tallies Another Victory With BULL RUN by Bob Proctor ull Run (or First Manassas), fought in July of 1861, was the first major battle of the American Civil War. Both North and South thought it would be the only battle, and that victory would be so overwhelming that the loser would capitulate out of sheer hopelessness. Thirteen months later at Second Bull Run, nobody was that naive anymore. BATTLEGROUND 7: BULL RUN captures the pomp, gallantry, and confusion of both battles, along with the emerging tactical genius of both Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, Talon Soft's BATTLEGROUND series has been praised far and wide, with BATTLEGROUND: SHILOH winning CGW's best wargame of 1996. BULL Run is mechanically identical — still complex, yet manageable to the previous three BATTLEGROUND games covering the American Civil War. So, we'll assume that those of you who are interested in this series know what you like and what you don't, and focus on what makes BULL RUN different from the other games in the group. GOT MY RAILROAD TIE This is action from the first day of the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Yankees throw themselves at Jackson's troops along an unfinished railroad line. is no truly dominant terrain, making this ideal for a meeting engagement where neither side can be sure of the other's intentions. Playing one of the full-day scenarios with a buddy is a blast, because you can try something unexpected or ahistorical to really see who the best general is! Now some of you may be muttering \"But I like history!\" or \"Fat chance I've got of finding someone to play with,\" so let me hasten to assure you that BULL RUN offers 22 scenarios, of which, 8 are First Bull Run and 14 arc Second Bull Run. Since there is n o better way to understand the dynamics of a battle than to game it, the following lists the conflicts you can learn about: First Battle of Bull Run Four scenarios comprise the entire battle. Two are historical but differ in start times: At 5 a.m., Union forces are uncommitted (except for the demonstration\" at Blackburn's Ford, which McDowell wanted Beauregard to think was the main attack). The 9 a.m. start finds the leading Union forces already across Bull Run and committed to a flanking movement around the Rebel left. 'That four-hour difference means 12 fewer tums of maneuvering and a shorter, more historical game. For head-to-head play, I want that extra four hours to prepare some surprises. BULL RUN be LET LOOSE THE FOGS OF WAR BULL RUN is the best title in the series for head-to-head play with Fog of War turned on.

Jackson lined up his troops along the crest of a low ridge and stopped the Union advance in its tracks, caming himself the nickname \"Stonewall.\" Blackbum's Ford One historical scenario and one \"what if?\" scenario portray this skirmish some three days before the 1861 battle. Union forces tried to seize a bridgehead on the south side of Bull Run. Historically, they failed; in the game it is pretty casy to take the objective but almost impossible to hold it when the Rebel reinforcements launch a counterattack. If you make them pay heavily in casualties, victory can be yours. This is a good beginning scenario. FRESH-PAINTED FORD The battle for Blackburn's Ford is one of the better small scenarios. Brawner's Farm Jumping ahead to 1862, this small battle took place the night before the Second Bull Run really started. Jackson tried to ambush an unsuspecting Union division retreating along the Warrenton Tumpike. Historically, both sides took equal CGW AUGUST 1997 "


"BATTLEGROUND 7: BULL RUN  REVIEW (4 to 15 turns) and depict episodes of the most furious fighting casualties and the Yankees retired toward Washington in good order. Call that a draw if you want, but when you're outnumbered 2 to l by the best troops in the Rebel amy and come away with your unit intact, I call it a victory. Unfortunately, TalonSoft missed badly on this scenario; the objective hexes are placed between the two forces and any attempt by the Union to hold them results in a major victory for the guys in gray It's possible that this will be the last BATTLEGROUND title on the Civil War, as TalonSoft is focusing on doing for 20th century warfare what the BATILEGROUND series has done for the 19th. If so, they can be mostly forgiven for a few flaws in a great game system. My advice is that anyone interested in historical gaming should play these fine games before faster processors and better graphics make them as outdated as EASTERN FRONT SALUTE THE COLORS When I reviewed BATTLEGROUND 5: ANTIETAM back in the March, 1997, CGW I wrote that the primary attraction was the large number of interesting and varied short scenarios\" and recommended it as the best title to buy as an introduction to the series. That advice still stands. With a couple of exceptions, the short scenarios in BULL. RUN are weaker-either by being unbalanced, inaccurate, or inconsequential. The emphasis here is clearly on the longer scenarios. For starters, the average scenario length is more than 25 turns. Plus, the documentation seems hastily put together from ANTIETAM manual remnants. This is the first TalonSoft manual not to have a chapter on the history of the battle (there is some in the online notes). STRATEGY Z WARGAMES Second Battle of Bull Run Scenarios II and 12 are the Big Enchilada, representing the entire twoday battle. The 5:40 a.m. start runs 90 turns, with the 9:40 a.m. some 12 turns shorter. The map is smaller and set slightly southwest of the first battle. There are also two sccnarios of just the first day, and two of just the second day. The remaining six scenarios are shorter APPEAL: Anyone with an interest in gaming historical situations. PROS: Best of series for head-tohead play with Fog of War. CONS: No scenario editor; some unbalanced scenarios; lackluster manual. Leadership in an Uncertain World ethink your entire approach against a human opponent. Smaller units of 50-100 men take on a much more important role as scouts and skirmishers. Let your enemy see these small units and keep the big ones hidden if you can. Cavalry is best for scouting, but is in very short supply in BULL RUN. So use \"foot cavalry\" instead and save the real cavalry to attack enemy scouts that push too far ahead. Keep a reserve. Green troops in BULL RUN are prone to panic if a nearby unit breaks. Concentrate your fire on a single unit and expect that when it flees, several other units that haven't even been shot at will retreat with it. Be prepared to take advantage of this hole in the defense or, if you're on defense, to plug it quickly. Use smaller forces than you would against the Al. To make your forces as effective as possible, master all the little tactical nuances. Learn to use the higher ground and wooded areas to your advantage. Build breastworks when you have time. Rest fatigued troops to keep them from crumbling the first time they take casualties. Emulate Robert E. Lee-get inside your opponent's skull. Trying to defend all the things your enemy could do will stretch you too thin; instead, think about what he would do. You have to gamble. The fate of your country is in your hands. FUTWA Jump Window X RUN FOR WASHINGTON! The battle of Brawner's Farm is unbalanced. The objective hexes, shown by the flags (the red square is on the middle of the three), entice a Union attack, but Jackson's whole corps is waiting behind the hill! WINDOW TO MY WAR Here's the Jump Window showing the entire map of First Bull Run at 5 a.m. The Union forces are strung out along the Warrenton Tumpike with more due to enter behind them.

NAPOLEON IN RUSSIA is a solid, mature effort. Some of the variants seem more interesting than the historical scenarios, which is a testament to the games designers. If you have any interest in wargames, and the Napoleonic era in particular, or just want a diversion from the frantic clickfests of real-time games, check out NAPOLEON IN RUSSIA.

But here, due get a bit dated. to the phased nature of gameplay and he key to being successful in NAPOLEON IN RUSSIA, whether playing against the computer or a human player, is coordination of your three main unit types: artillery, infantry, and cavalry. Unlike Civil War games, cavalry play a critical role as shock troops. There's nothing a hussar regiment likes better than to find an unprotected infantry unit in an open field. The infantry's defense is to form a square-but you then bring up your artillery and chew up the infantry. Make sure you check all your artillery and infantry units to see if a formation change is in order during your defensive-fire phase. This is the only time you can form a square or unlimber artillery. Conversely, you can only form line with infantry during your movement phase. Pay attention to the unit list and, in particular, fatigue. If the fatigue level creeps past seven, your unit has a much higher chance of being routed. Resting a turn or two is not a bad idea. Manage your supply wagons carefully. There's nothing more frustrating than wheeling around to the flank of an enemy unit, only to find that you're out of ammo. WAGON TRAIN Here, the Russians have shifted their line to the left of the town, leaving an opening. The French player should try to hit the village and take out the Russian supply wagon.

HPS Simulations follows this practice with its Pacific module to the TICERS ON THE PROWL 2/PANTHERS IN THE SHADOWS system, DRAGONS IN THE Misr, a stand-alone game which requires the TIGERS/ PANTHERS manual for play.

Check out the demo on this month's CG-ROM! better known actions such as Iwo Jima or Edson's Ridge on Guadalcanal, but these battles can easily be constructed with the scenario builder and handy reference books. More disappointing is that HPS did not choose to explore events in China or the battles of Marshal Zhukov in the undeclared Russo-Japanese conflict. Sources for these scenarios are not very accessible to most gamers. DRACONS MHE MIST JUNGLE WARFARE As you'd expect from this very detailoriented series, DRACONS is about as accurate in a technical sense as any wargamer could wish for. Also, a new jungle terrain set has been added to better reflect the fighting in the Pacific. The database contains weapon systems data for the six countries involved in the conflict, and the proven TIGERS/PANIHERS system still provides an unsurpassed insight into technology, command control, and morale. The system allows you to exercise wide control over the type and number of play decisions. Using these elements, three of the four scenarios show the evolution of American operations in the Pacific, Tarawa shows the bloody results of inadequate training, equipment, and support doctrine in 1943. Kwajalein shows the improvement in American tactics and doctrine by 1944, while Finegayan, the Guam scenario, shows the complete dominance of U.S. forces over the withering Japanese army in the later stages of the war. Changkufeng is a change of pace, showing a Japanese action against the demoralized Red Army in the undeclared war along the Manchurian borSingle men would infiltrate at night and wear down the nerves of even the toughest Marine. \"Spider holes\" would open up long after the main fighting had passed. In a game such as PANZER GENERAL, which prizes fun above all else, oddities of scale might be forgiven to a degree; in a game system known for its attention to realism and detail, it's much more of a problem. Playing DRAGONS, you often wish for a bit less blitz and more of the psychological tactics of the jungle fighter. such a re-working of scale goes beyond the scope of a mere add-on. Perhaps HPS gave its many fans a new database and arena for its system. Towards that end, it was successful, and has provided a worthwhile game in DRACONS IN THE MIST. The Pacific theater, however, needs an entirely different context. Price: $25 Minimum System Requirements: (ownership of either PANTHERS IN THE SHADOWS Or TIGERS ON THE PROWL 2). 386/40 PC, 4MB RAM, 4 MB hard disk space, mouse. Multiplayer Support: email (1-2 players) Designer: Scott Hamilton Publisher: HPS Simulations Santa Clara, CA (408) 554-8381 www.hpssims.com Reader Service #: 352 MORE BLITZ, LESS FILLING The major flaw in DRACONS is that there were no changes made to the TICERS/PANTHERS system. It's great for Euro-centric conflict with heavy emphasis on vehicles and crushing, artilleryintensive actions. Yet in DRAGONS, the flavor of the sweaty, vicious, largelyuncoordinated fighting that characterized most Pacific combat is missing. The Bushido code is represented by high Japanese initial morale values in most scenarios, but the mechanics of how units reacted to given situations are unchanged. Why not, for example, allow players to give units beserker status for Banzai charges? Even the scale --platoon level is questionable. American units were often held up for hours by tenacious infantrymen in tiny ad hoc formations. APPEAL: Gamers who want the detail of the TIGERS system in the Pacific. PROS: Tons of technical data; nice scenario builder; still strong AI. CONS: The European-oriented system lacks a distinctive Pacific outlook. CGW AUGUST 1997 "


"LENINGRAD 2.0 REVIEW **** DIFFICULTY LEVEL Schwerpunkt Rock B STRATEGY Z WARGAMES Sharpen Your Command Acumen With LENINGRAD 2.0 by Johnny L. Wilson BELVEVGRAD chwerpunkt, the publisher of LENINGRAD 2.0, is named after the German word that means center of gravity (literally, heavy point) and, in military terminology, identifies the critical point where an assault or breakthrough should occur. LENINGRAD 2.0 is an operational level game of WWII action between the Germans and Soviets where schwerpunkt is key. From von Leebs initial march on Leningrad in 1941 through Govorov's counterattacks against Kuechler in mid-'43 and late '43, gamers who command the Germans get a very valid lesson in determining the schwerpunkt because they are limited to three combat phases per turn. This reflects the idea that the player on the offensive must find the right places to brcak through and exploit while the defensive player can react anywhere along the line. Appropriately enough, each combat round consists of target designation (clicking on a defender), attack prosecution (clicking on all of the attackers and pressing the FIRE button), retreat (if required), pursuit (where possible), and a second attack with armor or mechanized infantry, or both (to simulate the latter's breakthrough capability). With only three combat phases per turn for the German side, it becomes crucial to maximize your attack potential and get as many of those secondary breakthrough attacks as possible. It also makes playing the German side considerably more interesting than playing the Russians. Boardgame aficionados will feel immediately at home with LENINGRAD 2.0. The map is attractive and the units are represented by the familiar black and gray counters with military markings for the Germans and two shades of red counters for the Soviets. Combat resolution is fast and efficient, making it possible to get through more than one scenario in a single night's play. There is no music or sound LES RETA in the game. LENINGRAD 2.0 has a couple of new features, though.

Messing around a deserted museum, solving bizarre puzzles, and capturing dangerous evil spirits tumed out to be a winning combination, so you just knew there would be a sequel. Now its here: SHIVERS TWO: HARVEST OF SOULS, where you mess around a deserted town, solve bizarre puzzles, and save the worlel You're a member of the rock band \"Trip Cyclone, which is spending the summer in the town of Cyclone, Arizona (one of band members has relatives there). By the time you arrive, however, everyone has vanished except the motel owner, and in a short while, he too is missing You proceed to poke through the ghost town and uncover several dirty little secrets, while trying to piece together what happened, wly it happened, and who caused it to happen. It isn't long before you discover a connection with certain Indian legends relating to Devil's Mouth Canyon, and the local silver mine. as the Kiva, and putting them on an altar. This is no easy thing to accomplish. First, you have to solve a puzzle to get a Bahos, then hurry to Devils Mouth Canyon. Once there, you must find the petroglyph (wall painting) that corresponds to that particular prayer stick, touch it, solve a puzzle, then run through the Canyon to the Kiva. This is dangerous stuff, because the glyphs are alive, and leech your life force while you're in the Canyon. Even just holding a Bahos reduces your life energy, so time is of the essence in completing the sequence. Fortunately, once you touch the right glyph, you won't take any further damage while working on the puzzle. After it's done, though, you're still in peril until you make it out of the Canyon. To lielp you along, numerous clues are strewn throughout the game, especially in a set of videos made by Trip Cyclone (before they mysteriously disappear). Watching all of them is vital. Not only do they provide hints, but in some cases, puzzles are not available or can't be solved until you've seen a particular video. Unlike the first SHIVERS, where inventory was limited to one item at a time, in SHIVERS Two, you can lug around as many as 12 things at once. All the objects you find have some use in the game, though it's necessary to pick and choose what to take The view is 3D, with full 360-degree motion, along with the ability to look up and down. This is important, as not everything will be at eye level, especiall y in the Canyon, where the glyphs are all over the walls. For those with hearing problems or who prefer quiet play at times, there is an option to turn on subtitles. This is one of the better text options I've seen, as you get captions even during the FMV sequences and videos (in addition, lyrics to all the songs are printed in the manual). Another interesting feature for the truly desperate --is the automatic puzzle solve. If a puzzle is too aggravating, or just too tough, the automatic solve can do it for you. Naturally, this costs hefty game points, but has no other ill effects; you can still finish the game with the best My big quarrel with SHIVERS TWO is the endgame, which is idiocy. LEGGO MY BAHOS Some mystic power is definitely at work, since the greater portion of the game is taken up with recovering prayer sticks, called Bahos, bringing them to a ceremonial chamber known CHILL OUT Unpleasant surprises lurk everywhere in SHIVERS Two, which successfully maintains a creepy atmosphere throughout DO NOT ENTER The guardian of the Kiva door won't let you pass until you solve the tangram to enter.

"CHARLES ARDAI  CRITIC AT LARGE crita The Death of the Science Fiction analyze When Bad Things Happen to Good Sci-fi Games ome of the most successful computer games ever made fall squarely in the science fiction genre. Not even counting the inevitable Star Trekand Star Wars blockbusters, you can think of everything from old coin-ops like SPACE INVADERS and text adventures like PLANETFALL to modern classics like WING COMMANDER and MASTER OF ORION. So, what I am about to say may sound a bit odd but bear with me, Sci-fi doesn't sell. I'm not talking about bad science-fiction games. Sometimes those do sell and sometimes they don't. depending mostly on things like how good the box office retums were for the movie of which the game is a licensed spinoff. I'm talking about good science-fiction games, ones that try to capture, in the context of interactive entertainment, the essence of what grcat science-fiction writers have been able to capture on the printed page. I can't think of a great Tolkien-style fantasy game that wasn't a hit, or a horror game that scared the pants off me but didn't do diddly at retail. Tliere probably are some examples, but not many, and they don't readily come to mind. In science fiction, you don't even have to think hard.

"CHARLES ARDAI >>>Continued from pg 219 A DISTINCTIVE MEDIUM CRITIC AT LARGE l'rom time to time, though, the attempt is made, and from time to time it succeeds; it is in these cases that I find audience apathy so frustrating CHRONOMASTER, for instance, had plenty of excitement to please the Buck Rogers crowd, but at its core was a story about revenge: If you had the power to avenge a wrong you suffered in childhood, but doing so meant obliterating entire universes, would you do it? I HAVE NO MOUTH told an even more troubling story, about characters trapped and tortured by a sadistic computer. How can you defcat an external enemy, it asked, without first coming to terms with the forces inside yourself that forment you even more? Meretzkys new game, THE SPACE Bar, is a goofy comic romp, but it's also good science fiction that explores the different ways alien species might perceive the world, and how that would affect their behavior. An insectoid alien sces the world fractured into a dozen tiny, identi cal images, and so do you when you're inside its head. A plant creature can neither see mor move, so ncither can you, though while in its body you still have to find a way to solve adventure game puzzles. Meretzkys old game, A MIND FOREVER VOYAGING (which you can still get in one of the LOST TREASURES OF INFOCOM packages), took on more serious questions. What does it mean to be alive? How do the choices we make today lead to disaster in the future? It accomplished this by making you play the part of an artificially intelligent computer being put through a series of progressively more disturbing simulations. Do I mean to suggest that people should play these games instead of XWING VS. TIE FICHTER? By no means. People should play what they like. But I wish more gamers would give serious science-fiction games a try on the rare occasions that they do come along, since I think they'd like those games, too. Computer games are not primarily about storytelling. They're primarily about motion and dexterity and visceral excitement. But, as it happens, the medium is also capable of telling stories that couldn't be told as well in other media. A game can put you into the head (so to speak) of a plant or a computer, and can immerse you in alien environments and force you to interact with, rather than merely read about, all sorts of characters and situations, Interactive fiction has the potential to tell enormously powerful stories but only if there are gamers to tell the stories to. It seems incvitable that we'll get more spaceships and less real science fiction, and this is probably okay. One hundred Star Trek novels for every 1984 or Flowers For Algernon may be the right ratio, given public tastes. But if the lack of interest meant that the computer game equivalent of 1984 or Flowers For Algernon never got published, that would be a shame.

"GAMER'S EDGE Your Source for Ruthless Strategies, Tips, Cheats, and Hacks STRATEGY & TIPS X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter Flight Training for Aspiring Imperial and Alliance Pilots by Vox Day here are two things to keep in mind when approaching X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER for the first time. The first is that no matter what it says on the box, XVI was designed to be a multiplayer game. The second is that X-WING and TIE FIGHTER, which were great games in their respective days, were designed to be single-player games. Unfortunately, many veteran Rebel and Imperial pilots operate under the mistaken assumption that because XVT is the direct descendant of X-WING and TIE FICHTER, the same rules for success apply. Nothing could be further from the truth. While good dog fighting technique and a supple wrist are still huge assets, the days of a single starfighter blithely challenging a fleet of enemy starships and living to brag about it are over. Although the XWING missions were tough, it wasn't uncommon for a single pilot to rack up 20 or more kills on a single sortie. XVT more closely approximates the real world, where six kills denotes an Ace, and mere survival is success. screen, difficulty cannot be directly adjusted in a combat engagement. Don't just choose a better craft cither, because that will cost you potential victory points, and it also increases mission difficulty. Success also becomes more attainable once you realize that XVT's attitude toward losing your craft is much more similar to Doom than X-WING. On each mission, you are provided with multiple lives, and it is expected that you will frequently have to expend a few of them. Don't be afraid to Jump (the \"J\" key) between craft in your Flight Group on missions where it's permitted, or to occasionally spend a life on a kamikaze run into a capital ship Dogfighting is tough in XVI, and whether you're fighting a human or an Al-controlled pilot, keep one hand on the throttle at all times. Since the physics of the game dictate that lower throttle settings provide more maneuverability, Al pilots will often drastically reduce throttle and begin a series of light turns, hoping you will overshoot them. Repeatedly hitting the Enter Pilot's Principles Becausc XVT is a very rich and subtle game, it's truly best if you don't dive right into the melees. They're not as fun as the cooperative training exercises and combat engagements. It's important to note that combat engagements were not created with two-man cooperative play in mind, but were designed to be at balance when an equal number of human pilots are flying for the Empire and the Rebellion. IfXVT seems ridiculously difficult when all the humans are flying for the same side, that's because it is. Split the humans into Imperials and Rebels, and both sides will find it easier to complete their missions. This is necessary because while the difficulty level on training exercises can be adjusted in the config CGW AUGUST 1997 "

"GAMER'S EDGE WALKTHROUGH Last Express Get Your Travel Arrangements in Order by Petra Schlunk is the eve of WWI, and you are an American fugitive, Robert Cath, boarding the famous Orient Express at the request of an old friend. After getting on the train and finding him dead, you assume his identity and are plunged into some truly strange events. To help you along on your journey, here is our friendly A travel guide for Broderbund's LAST EXPRESS. afterward. To get the French boys whistle, catch a bug for him in the salon; sit down at the table by the clock and use the empty matchbox to catch it. When you get a chance, trade the bug for the whistle. You can also do this later, but if you fail, you will find the whistle late in the game. Later in the morning, you will meet Schmidt in the corridors; speak with him. Sneaking Around The best way to get into compartments when they are empty is to ensure that the conductor is gone or distracted. Frequently, the best time to do this is when another passenger is between you and the conductor (often just after a passenger leaves the very compartment you wish to search). To distract the conductor in your sleeping car, knock on door 5 and then walk past the angry harem owner and enter compartment 2 or 3. To distract the conductor in the other sleeping car, you can, after 2:00 on the second day, release Anna's dog from the baggage car when the trainmaster is away from his office. Then, while the conductor is ferrying the dog back to baggage, enter the compartment of your choice. In Concert During the concert, which runs from 3:00 to 4:15, you have much to do. Enter compartment E, climb out the window, and enter Anna's compartment. Find the letter in her dresser, search her jewelry box carefully (find the button at the front of the box), and retrieve a key. This key will open almost any door! The soonest that you can retrieve this key is after Anna leaves for the concert and while the two young ladies are still in the salon (around 2:45). Use the key to enter compartment B and search Tatiana's bathroom for the firebird egg. A Fast Farewell Once you board, go to sleeping compartment 1. Open the window, pick up your friend Tyler's body, and unceremoniously toss it off the train. Put on Tyler's jacket and examine his luggage. When the police board the train at Epernay (after 9:15), climb through the window in Tyler's compartment or hide in the bathroom next to compartment A until they leave. After assuming Tyler's identity, speak with Schmidt when you can. After 9:30, go to the platform by Kronos' car and show Tatiana the poem you found in Tyler's luggage. Later in the evening you will have to fight someone. Duck a couple times when he starts to swing and then grab his arm to take away his weapon. After the train passes Chalons, you can go to bed. Wake from the dream, go to compartment F, and speak with Anna. Follow her to compartment A, and then go back to sleep. A Whistle Swap In the morning, talk to Tatiana in the dining car to get a translated version of the poem (you can give her the poem now if you didn't earlier).

Hide the briefcase under your bed until the concert ends. After the concert, show Schmidt the briefcase. Then bring it to Kronos (you don't have much time to do this after Kahina threatens you). At about 5:00, Anna will go to the baggage car. Follow her or go there before she docs -she'll catch you and open the trunk near the suitcases. You will enter another fight. Avoid getting hit (duck when a swing begins). After five or six swings Anna will come to your aid. ALL TIED UP Here, just wriggle around until the matches fall out of your pocket.

Use up those heavy AIM-120s to regain your agility if a dogfight appears imminent. any diehard fans of WWI and WWII flight sims see modern air-to-air combat as sterile and uninteresting. In their view, proficiency at pushing buttons has replaced flying skill as the major determinant of success, and wish-em-clead missiles have eliminated the need for good tactics. Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Although combat between contemporary fighters often lacks the close-range intimacy of guns-only battles between prop planes, jets must still maneuver to bring their weapons to bear. This, along with the fallibility of air-to-air missiles, means that piloting ability and sound tactics are still essential Despite the enormous advances made in aircraft performance since the age of the prop fighter, air-to-air tactics would probably remain relatively unchanged today if it were not for the introduction of guided missiles. Missiles change the rules of the game, multiplying each fighters offensive capability and enabling combat beyond visual range (BVR). To understand the tactics of missile combat, you must first know what makes missiles tick. ATOLL! ATOLL! Missiles in F/A-18 HORNET 3.0 are easy to spoof, but only when you see them coming. Try to spot the inbound soon after you get the warning, while its smoke trail is still visible. If you drop chaff and flares while yanking back on the stick just before the missile reaches you, it will sail harmlessly past almost every time. Guide Your Missiles Tor a missile to score a kill in most sims, three conditions must be met: First, the target must be within the missile's Hn AMRAAMSKI The Russian R-77's onboard radar can only guide itself once it gets within 15km of its target. Until then, this launching Su-27 must maintain a radar lock, limiting its freedom of movement. Though there's no way to know precisely when the missile's radar has acquired the target, you can estimate when it's safe to break lock by counting the seconds. based time-to-impact readout (at launch time) and the firing range.

These maneuvers are intended to change the missile's predicted intercept point too rapidly for it to follow. With enough airspeed and the right technique, it is possible in most sims to defeat any missile you see coming, The radar and missile systems available in modern fighter aircraft may have changed the face of air combat, but the technology is far from perfect.

Ideally, you would like to destroy the enemy without being forced to eat a missile yourself. In this example, two aircraft facing each other fire missiles at approximately the same time. The F-22 pilot understands that the key is the distance between an aircraft that launches a missile and its target at the moment the missile reaches the target. Increasing this relative distance makes it more likely that your missile will impact before that of the enemy's. Since each pilot is firing head-on, it's less likely that either will use a heat-seeking missile. Both missiles in this example require a radar lock to guide on their targets, which means that the first missile to arrive at its target can cause the enemy missile to \"go stupid\" in one of three ways: by destroying the bandit; by knocking out its radar system; or by forcing the bandit to break radar lock while dodging the incoming missile. Even if the incoming missile cannot be defeated in this manner, the increased distance still has the benefit of making the enemy missile fly farther to reach you. The more distance a missile covers, the slower, less maneuverable, and easier to evade it becomes. To maximize the distance (and your safety margin), slow down after launching your own missile, as the F-22 does here.

Before the advent of radar, achieving tactical surprise usually involved visually locating the enemy without being spotted in return, then trying to remain unobserved as you closed the distance by staying in the sun or hiding in the bandit's blind spot below and behind. These techniques still apply once you get into visual range of a radar-equipped bandit; to get that close, you just have to avoid appearing on his radar scope. The first step is to find the enemy while still beyond visual range without being found yourself. This is easily done with friendly airor groundbased early warning radar support. If the enemy has similar assets, however, you must fly low, relying on terrain and ground clutter to escape notice. To maximize your chances of surprise, only use radar when no other sensors are available. Radar almost always alerts a bandit to your presence. The only exception might be an ultra-modern \"low probability of intercept\" radar, such as the one the F-22 carries, which conventional radar-warning receivers have difficulty locating. After you have pinpointed an enemy aircraft, the next step is to close to firing range while remaining undetected. The best approach is generally begun from the target's flanks, outside its radar search cone, converting to a six o'clock position before entering visual range. A straight tail chase may be safer, but it requires much more time and fuel due to the lower closure rate. Stealth aircraft, which are invisible to radar at long ranges, have the additional option of a frontal approach. But since this would not result in an especially advantageous attack position, going around to the target's side is usually the wiser choice. Once within weapons range, blow the bandit away without hesitation.

"TIPS! Strategy/Wargames Adventure/RPG THE LAST EXPRESS FRAGILE ALLEGIANCE Interplay's newest strategy game is surprisingly good, with depth and an interesting premise: building a mining empire among an asteroid field. Here are some tips direct from Interplay for getting closer to that mining monopoly. Basic Management: For your very first asteroid, make sure you build missile and satellite silos, a weapons factory, a ALES 1220K MAI INCE -10 system. In those cases, build an environmental-control center, which will provide you with all the necessary life support systems for a limited duration. It's usually enough to sustain your colony until you finish mining and leave. You can also build the environmental control center if you don't have the necessary cash to build fullfledged independent systems and need some life support while you wait for the cash to flow in Technology: There are several technologies you can purchase. Make sure you get the Seismic Penetrator (for reaching the deepest ores), and the Mk2 Mine and Mk2 Deep Bore Mine (they double your mining facilities' speed). Attacking: If you want to mount an attack on an alien rival, the order of attack should be as follows: 1) Send in agents to gather intelligence on the targeted base and to sabotage defense systems; 2) Fire missiles to weaken any defenses still left; and 3) Send in the fleet to destroy surviving buildings These tips should help you reach your ultimate goal of becoming an intergalactic mining tycoon. Hun On ATTACK Ballet Cesto utton, button, who's got the button? Evidently, a lot of people riding THE LAST EXPRESS have button fixations -then again, this is a whodunit. We'll refrain from commenting, gentle reader, on how much the game's designers enjoy pushing our buttons, both figuratively and literally. At any rate, in an effort to save you the endless \"hunt for the pixel\" nonsense, we offer the following assistance: To steal Anna's key, simply press the button at the front of her jewelry box.

Several areas will be locked to you in the beginning courtyard, but if you continue past the stables and the well (which is guarded by the big monster), you'll come to a guard tower to the right of a second stable. Go to the top of the guard tower to retrieve a key. It will be floating above a gargoyle's head, and to get it, you'll have to kick the head from the side do it from the front, and you'll trigger a fatal trap). This key provides access to the main balconies. To get across the balcony to the prison tower, you'll have to find the floating armor, which is also located on the balconies.

"TIPS! Puzzles/Classics MARBLE DROP you neglect to repair damaged ships. A good rule of thumb is, if your ship has 50 percent or less damage, it's generally worth docking it at a friendly port facility for repair. This assumes that the port itself hasn't been damaged more than, say, 25 percent; if it has, you're probably wasting your time. AWACS planes are important, since their increased radar range helps you more easily spot enemy ships. Many admirals are overprotective of their AWACS planes, and invariably target those of their enemy. If your opponent shows similarly aggressive tendencies, set a trap using your AWACS as bait. As enemy vessels and aircraft close in, keep your aircraft and a wolfpack of subs just out of their detecW hen is a puzzle game like a W stealth fighter?

There are a couple of ways to address the four-player limit you encounter when flying over the Internet Gaming Zone. One is to use Kali, the shareware IPX emulator program available from www.kali. net. Even in this day of Internet-enabled Windows 95 games, Kali is still proving itself a must-have utility for the serious net gamer, as it offers more flexibility-and sometimes even better performancethan many games' built-in Net support. In this case, Kali version 1.1 lets you attempt to connect up to eight players in X-WING vs. TIE FICHTER. Over standard modem lines, we were only able to hook up with six players, but that still beats the game's builtin limitations. You don't need Kali or the Internet Caming Zone for Internet play, though. Simply determine the IP address of the computer that will be hosting the game (to find this, click the Start button, choose Run, and type WINIPCFG) and input that number. Again, your luck in getting more than four players in the game will depend on the connection speed and latency of each player, as well as the mission you choose.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what (hwor, IME What's the Deal mo with... desion te would have died out long ago. The truth of the matter is that computer gaming is doing well enough these days that good games, guilty of no crime but being uninspired, can eas ily be lost in the shuffle. And maybe they should be. Maybe it's time that titles be judged a little more harshly on style and concept, instead of just mechanics. tyle. Sometimes you have it, sometimes you don't. Style is that certain something that distinguishes one computer game from the rest, making it more than just the sum of its parts. While it's not exactly radical to say that games benefit from having a style all their own, it is usually (and often erroneously) seen as a chrome issue, as opposed to being part of the substance of a game. While we are trained almost from birth to distrust flashy things as much as we desire them, perhaps it is time to modify our ingrained bias just a bit, and begin to see style as a valid concern in game design from the ground up. To \"serious\" gamers, it may sound like heresy to put such an unquantifiable concept up on the same pedestal with such icons as gameplay and depth, but that kind of thinking on a designer's part may be fatal to many games, which start out as good ideas, but fail to take today's crowded marketplace into account With the plethora of titles these days, it is needlessly cruel to dismiss designers as unoriginal for dishing out another flight sim or real-time wargame. Guess what, folks-when you boil gaming down to basic concepts like that, there are really less than a dozen odd \"types\" of games out there! If people were as judgmental about novels being of the same \"type,\" the written word ( It's time to modify our ingrained bias and begin to see style as a valid concern in game design. 22 To illustrate how much better things can be w hen designers have a concept they actually care about instead of a bunch of game mechanics looking for a trend to ride, I present Exhibit A: INTERSTATE '76 from Activision. Now, for all intents and purposes, all we have here is yet another roadkill game with graphics that are actually a little cruder than the fluff that had gone before. By gameplay logic, this one should be thrown in the bin, to land on top of DEMOLITION DERBY and SCREAMERS...but one thing above all else makes 1-'76 an easy call for a future Hall of Fame induction cere mony: style. This game was execut ed with such clear and cool Vision that it drips style from every pixel and thus has a shot at immortality. The same can be said of earlier games that had nothing spectacu. lar going for them in terms of original gameplay. The original X COM was just a basic computer version of the old SnapShot rules from the original Traveler RPG... but the very cool paranormal chic that went into every aspect of the game made it a classic easily as much as the clean interface and elegant design did. Unfortunately, the first sequel (and probably the second) will not burn half as brightly as time goes by, because they simply have a deficit of style. The game is pretty much the same, but the Vision just isn't there. This is the difference between a person and a robot. Projects have to come from the design team up, not from marketing down. With today's incredible development curve-even for a crappy game-there is no use wasting money trying to saturate the market with soul-less, meaningless, real-time sci-fi wargames or Civ-esque God games or Myst-y Adventure games or whatever else is deemed \"Hot\" during a given year. And the final sad aspect of style is that the more crowded your genre is, the more you will need style just to break even. M.A.X., from Interplay, when played patched, is a fine little scifi wargame and is easily recommend able for a long shelf life. But unfortunately for everyone who must have worked so hard on it, the plague of C&C clones has raised the style ante so high on a real-time, sci-fi base-building/tactical-combat game that M.A.X. simply lacks the style necessary to rise above the chaff out there. RED ALERT succeeds as a sequel as much due to the fact it is about\" something as it does because maps are bigger and the scenarios more complex. Any realtime game without a strong sense of identity and style will simply fade into yesterday's monotone glare. So although \"serious\" gamers and Company Budget watchers often consider style to be the icing you throw onto a game if you have the time, it is becoming more and more the factor that decides if all the time and trouble were worth it in the first place. Last year brought us a whole load of car-combat games, for example. While some, like NECRODOME, offered some interest ing twists, they were pretty much unremarkable and quickly forgot ten. Should we have come to the conclusion that car-wars computer sims are generally a bad idea? The real lesson to be learned is that games shouldn't be created on the basis of one guy turning to the other and saying \"Hey, let's do another deathmatch game...but this time they'll be in cars!!!\" Computer Gaming World (ISSN 0744-6667) is published monthly by Ziff-Davis, Inc.
