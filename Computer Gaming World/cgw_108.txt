"73 goodle prave TIME PROD NO. SCENE TAKE Sneak Previews are not designed to be reviews. Tey are feature articles baseul on \"works in progress\" that CGW's editors have deemed worthy of early coverage. These articles are not intended to provide the final word on a product, since we expect to publish appropriate review coverage when the game is finished. DIRECTOR PRODUCED BY Nada Chance Xanth Fans Would Miss This One yans of Piers Anthony's Xanth books and Abbott and Costello's \"Who's on First?\" routine will immediately be relieved to know I this conversation isn't in Legend Entertainment's upcoming Companions of Xanth. I use it as the opener, however, to show those who are not familiar with Xanth what a punful place it can be to go adventuring within. In addition, it introduces the unusual looking femme on our cover and tips off the fact that the player is going to have to get to know her in order to succeed in this adventure. Companions of Xanth is based upon Demons Don't Dream, the latest Xanth novel from Piers Anthony. In the book, still only available in hardbound at press time, there is an argument between two demons: Earth and Xanth. Those who have followed the series know that these are the dualistic demigods who hold the futures of Mundania (Earth) and the magical land of Xanth in their hands. The thesis for both the novel and the game is that Earth and Xanth have made a bet, a gambit rather like that of Yahweh and Satan in the prologue to Job or like Nickles and Zeuss in Archibald MacLeish's J.B. They have decided to make a wager upon the performance of human beings in a test of wits and prowess. Indeed, the interesting conceit of the game is that the player's character is Dug Mundane and that the game which Dug plays in the book is the same one, Companions of Xanth, which the player has just purchased. Of course, the premise of the game is that one demon has bet on the player's character and that the other demon has bet on a computer-controlled character named Kim. The set-up for all this has some humorous overtones and describing the denoument would reduce the enjoyment of discovery within the game experience. So, suffice it to say that gamers will assume the role of Dug and adventure within the familiar environs of Xanth. They will encounter notorious puns and familiar characters; they will enter the infamous Gap (no, not panting for breath) and encounter Stanley Steamer, the Gap Dragon; they will solve the entrance puzzles to ger into Magician Humphrey's castle; and they will stare into hypnogourds and end up in the notorious void. Pega Lego Legend Entertainment's Companions of Xanth by Johnny L. Wilson The Legend Evolves Of course, the first thing Legend veterans are going to say is, \"It doesn't look like a Legend game.\" Indeed, the designer has gone far beyond the graphic text adventure approach of the Spellcasting series and Timequest adventure. It has even gone beyond the interstices of full-screen puzzles, cur scenes and animation in Gateway and Eric the Grundy Golem: So, you understand that each character has a personal name, a creaturelrace name: Jenny Elf, Che Centaur, Demoness Metria, and so on. Dug Mundane: Okay, but who's the gorgeous blonde on the cover? Grundy: She's Nada Naga. Dug: I can see she's not a Naga. Otherwise she would have a long serpentine tail. But who is she? Grundy: Nada Naga. Dug: I know she's not a Naga ... Grundy: Then what do you need to know? Dug: Her name. Grundy: Nada Naga. Dug: I didn't ask her race. I asked her name. Grundy: Nada Naga. Dug: I know she's not a Naga ... Grundy: Right! Dug: What do you mean, right? Grundy: She's Nada Naga. She is a Naga and her name is Nada. Her talent is the ability to change from human to Naga form. Dug: So she is a Naga, but she's Nada Naga. Grundy: That's the first intelligent thing you've said since you started playing this game.

"UBIN Air Ball \"Oh, he flies through the air with the greatest of ease, That daring young man in his high top Nikes.\" asketball, funny enough, is the primary reason that soccer has never become popular in the U.S. In the rest of the world, soccer (or football as it is known worldwide) is the working class sport of the masses. Anyone who walks into any run-down public housing track in the U.K. is likely to see groups of kids playing soccer with almost anything: a real soccer ball, a soft drink can, a tennis ball or even a rock. Meanwhile, in the U.S., basketball is the king of the inner-city environment and it is here that some of the best ball is played in 3-on-3 tournaments. The fact that Jordan is allowed contractually to play in such 3-on-3 tournaments was a surprise. Jordan in Flight (Jordan) arrives in a large, gaudy, two and one-halfinch deep box. Of this, some one and three-fourths inches of the box amounts to air. This, of course, might be appropriate for Air Jordan, but in these ecologically sensitive times one has to wonder why so many trees were sacrificed to the god of packaging Further, one must question the wisdom of a sports simulation where a 486/33 is the recommended platform. Flight simulation fans may have high-end machines of necessity, but we doubt many sport game fans do (especially in a market where some of the best sports products remain text-based). On the reverse side, of course, one could praise EA for pushing the envelope. The Tip First impressions are incredible. The 3D-based graphic engine is so far ahead of everyone else, it is amazing. The manual claims that flight simulation algorithms are applied to let the player view the game from any distance or angle. However it is done, it is breathtakingly impressive. Immediately upon jumping into a 3-on-3 exhibition game, the full array of Jordan's impressive shot-making ability is available. From the quick first step around the defender to a leaping wraparound dunk, Jordan is a continuous flow of superb 3D animation. Mouse control is easy to use, and the number of actions available is kept to a minimum, which helps the case of play and keeps the simulation accessible to all levels of players. The video replay and video edit option allow the user to not only replay the previous play, but to create and manipulate one's very own highlight film. The interface for these options continues to improve and Jordan in Flight provides such functionality in a very logical and friendly fashion. The replay and highlight part of the product should be a significant part in any purchase decision. If the user enjoys putting together highlight films of their greatest achievements, this is a major plus.

"ctrategy au TIPS AND TACTICS FOR LUCASARTS' X-WING by Rusel DeMaria These tips and tactics have been excerpted from the forthcoming book, X-wing: The Official Strategy Guide by Rusel DeMaria and Prima Publishing. Along with the following general tactics, the book will include complete descriptions of every mission, strung together with wellwritten fiction that supports and enhances the fiction of the game. The book will be available in June for $19.95. STANDARD OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES: STARFIGHTER COMBAT Situational Awareness and Energy Management A Rebel Starfighter Pilot needs more than dogfighting skills to defeat the Empire. Situational Awareness and Energy Management are the two keys to developing effective starfighter tactics. Situational Awareness is knowing where you are, where your enemy is, and what you need to do to accomplish your mission goals. Energy Management is configuring your ship's power system to achieve the maximum efficiency. Proper use of these skills will depend on your ability to constantly analyze and reassess your situation in a rapidly changing environment. Situational Awareness and the Combat Multiview Display (CMD) The CMD is the most important part of your targeting system. The very first thing you should do at the start of any mission is query the CMD (in ID mode) for the nearest enemy fighter [R]. Note that, though armed, Shuttles and Transports aren't considered \"starfightersÂ» and will not be selected by the targeting system in this manner. If there are enemy ships nearby, you will have to decide quickly whether to engage or proceed. You should consider yourself already under attack if there is an enemy less than 2 klicks distant! Using the targeting system and the CMD, quickly cycle through all of the craft displayed on your sensors, noting their type and distance [T or Y). Pay particular attention to those ships most critical to your mission. As time allows, assign them to the memory locations of the targeting computer for quick reference during the mission (Shift-F5F8]. As new ships enter the area your R2 or ship's computer will alert you with an appropriate message. Target the new arrivals in the CMD to see how they affect the overall situation. As you do this you should be building a mental map to help you determine the best way to achieve your mission. Energy Management and the ELS Display The primary consideration during any mission is what power configuration will optimize your chances for success. There are three main elements of concern. These are the Engines, Weapons and Shields. Depending on mission goals and the needs of the moment. energy levels may be optimized for maximum speed, firepower or defense. There are always trade-offs and you will have to learn the pros and cons of each. As the mission proceeds you may find it necessary to make frequent adjustments. There is no \"perfect\" configuration. Nevertheless, you should always strive to maintain fully supercharged cannons and full primary and secondary shields. Here are some tips for managing energy in battle:  Shift weapon energy to shields. When you begin a mission you will find your cannons are already at their supercharged levels. Your primary shields will be fully charged, but your secondary shields will not be charged at all. Note that the cannons recharge more rapidly than the shields. Experienced pilots have found they can bypass certain inefficiencies in shield recharge rates by setting the cannon recharge rate at maximum and then transferring that energy to the shields [ or Shift-F10]. Quickly build up your secondaries by transferring any accumulated cannon energy directly to the shields. Use shields to store energy. Shields dissipate energy more slowly than the cannons. Use shields to store energy like a battery. When you are redirecting as much energy as possible to the engines for greater speed, but still wish to maintain your shields, you can keep the shields at their normal recharge rate and redirect all the cannon energy to the engines. Then, when you need to fire your weapons, you can quickly transfer shield energy to the cannons (; or Shift-F9). Don't forget to reset the recharge rate for the cannons! Use cannons to charge shields. Another alternative which allows good speed, shield maintenance and some firepower is to redirect all shield power to the engines and set the cannon recharge rate to one above normal. Then manually transfer cannon energy to the shields every few moPage 18 Computer Gaming World "

"citrateg. ments. This increases your workload, but in a low threat environment where you're not actually using the cannons very much this works well. You can actually build up a full charge for both systems this way! Redirect energy to engines for maximum speed. For maximum possible speed you will need to redirect both cannon and shield energy to the engines. As long as you have already maximized your shield strength first, you should have a few minutes before that energy dissipates. Note that normal recharge rates merely maintain current energy levels.  Redirect energy to other systems to slow down. This is the corollary to the previous rule, but is sometimes overlooked by novice pilots. When it is necessary to reduce speed, like when you want to keep a slower-moving target within range, you may choose to redirecr energy from engines to shields or to weapons instead of cutting your throttle. This way, you achieve the speed desired, but also gain additional charging for other important systems. Just don't forget to correct your settings when more speed is required. Weapons, Targets, and Firing Configurations Weapon selection and firing configuration decisions will often determine the success or failure of a mission. There are a few general rules that apply to almost every situation. Homing Projectiles: Homing projectiles such as concussion missiles and proton torpedoes are intended to give you some \"standoff\" attack capability. Since these are \"fire-and-forget\" weapons, their rapid deployment can help you quickly even the odds in your favor. Torpedoes are designed for attacking larger and slower ships. Torpedoes, though faster than a starfighter, can't turn as well. An alert pilot can always evade one, so avoid using them against starfighters unless the enemy is flying straight and level or in a head-on attack. Also, it should be noted that Imperial doctrine prohibits \"wasting\" torpedoes on starfighters so you probably will not find yourself targeted by one. Concussion missiles, on the other hand, are designed for dogfighting. Because of their great speed they are also somewhat effective at intercepting torpedoes. When targeting large enemy ships you must be within 6 klicks to get a lock-on. Against small ships the distance must be less than 2 klicks. At extremely long range you must keep the target absolutely centered in the targeting box. You will discover that Imperial ships are able to achieve solid lock-ons while you are still \"acquiring\" your lock. This is one area in which they maintain a slight technological edge. Cannons: For most combat and almost all dogfighting you will rely on your cannons. The dual fire mode has proven to be the most effective compromise when considering power, targeting opportunities and firing speed. In the Y-wing this is especially true because the cannons are in a twin mounting that places their fire in a very small area. If the target is going to be hit at all, it will be hit by both guns and may as well receive the double shot! In the X-wing, and to a lesser degree the A-wing, dual-fire mode is preferred because the wing-tip mounting of the cannons allows a much larger area to be considered by the targeting system. Although this results in a less efficient use of cannon energy (since up to half the shots may miss), it is offset by the benefit of having more firing opportunities against a small, rapidly maneuvering target such as a TIE Fighter. In fact, because TIE Fighters are smaller than an X-wing's wingspan they can find safety between the cannons right in the center of your targeting box! General Notes On Combat Combat in space is all about positioning. You want to be in a position to hit the other guy, and you want to avoid being in a position where he can hit you. In engagements between starfighters this is a straightforward task. A starfighter's weapons all face forward, so if you can position yourself on the enemy's tail and stay there, you will defeat him.  Dogfighting to the End When dogfighting, pick a target and stay with it until you have destroyed it. (See the rule relating to Hull Damage for an exception to this rule.) . Breaking up a Formation When breaking up an attack by several enemy ships in formation, your primary task is to keep firing long enough to force a particular ship to break formation. Proceed to attack each ship in the formation until all have been forced out of their attack run. After that, destroy at will or continue with mission objectives. Using Missiles on a Flight Group When attacking a multiship flight group with missiles or torpe. does, lock and fire as quickly as possible. If a missile or torpedo is evaded at first, don't worry; it will continue to track the targer. After you have fired at each of the enemy ships, go back through the target list to the earliest one that still survives. Fire another projectile if necessary, but try to take it out with cannons if you can. Remember, there aren't any reloads in a dogfight! Use them wisely. (When employing missiles or torpedoes against stationary targets it is not necessary to get a solid lock. A few seconds of \"yellow\" is sufficient). Escort Duty When flying a defensive patrol stay within a few klicks of the vessel(s) you are protecting. When you move to intercept any attackers try not to go more than eight to ten klicks away. A second attack on the other side will catch you too far away to get back in time. Also, when protecting other ships try to draw off the fire of large enemy ships by flying within range of their guns and popping off a few shots yourself.  Suicide Attacks In a one-for-one war of attrition the Empire will win. They know this and will not hesitate to spend their starfighters in suicide attacks against ours. In a head-on attack never assume an Imperial pilot will try to avoid colliding with you. His devotion to the Emperor, his honor and bravery are all confirmed when he dies while destroying the forces of the Rebellion. Fortunately for the Alliance, the ruggedness of our starfighters enables them to withstand most collisions with enemy starfighters. This is especially true when all shields are fully charged. However, despite the fact that these collisions usually result in the destruction of the enemy fighter, this is not considered a good tactic! Note that due to the rate of closure during head-on attacks, you can start firing at 1.7 to 1.9 klicks. When making a head-on attack into Page 20 Computer Gaming World "

"strategy heavy fire you are advised to avoid enemy fire by maneuvering in a \"corkscrew\" manner until you have closed to dogfighting range. Then, when your target flies past, turn behind him and attack. In the case of TIE Fighters or any other fighter with hull damage, you can maintain a straight and level head-on attack because the target will be destroyed with only a few shots. This is risky, however, as you will take several hits to your forward shields.  The Â«Wotan Weave\" Learn to do the \"Wotan Weave.\" This is a spiral or corkscrew maneuver that will enable you to avoid enemy fire while maintaining a particular heading. First target the craft you wish to head towards (or away from). With this as your reference point, start turning while simultaneously pulling back (or pushing forward) on the stick. If you are doing this correctly, the targeted craft's blip will appear about half way from the center of the appropriate sensor display. Your stick will be approximately half way towards a corner position, but will require constant small adjustments. Generally speaking, when avoiding fire from a large ship use a slow spiral. (The greater the distance the slower the spiral.) When avoiding enemy starfighters (or missiles) a tight fast spiral is best. Attacking Large Ships When attacking large ships the \"Wotan Weave\" is absolutely essential for making repeated attack runs. The standard method is this: 1) Have shields and cannons fully charged, with recharge rates at maximum. 2)\"Weave\" in and begin firing at 1.6 klicks and maintain fire as you close on the target. You may wish to reduce speed to keep from getting too close. This will also serve to maximize your fire on the target. 3) When you've taken enough hits to require breaking off, reverse direction and full throttle. 4) Transfer all available energy to the rear shields. 5) Start \"weaving\" and continue to fly away until out of range or ready to make another run. 6) Restore shields to even distribution. Balancing Shields Whenever you've taken a few hits, be sure to even out your shields. Press S three times. This is especially important when you are going to transfer energy from the cannons to the shields. The reason is that if, for example, your forward shields are down, but your rear shields remain at full, you won't be able to transfer the energy! (Our engineers are working on this.) Missile Escape Maneuver To avoid a missile you must have it targeted in the CMD. You must be moving at high speed (at least 100). Turn away from the missile, then when it is about 0.4 klicks away turn hard towards it. Assuming you are successful, keep turning toward it until it self-detonates. Because Y-wings are generally unable to do this, greater reliance must be made on their stronger shields and hull. Keep Cannons Supercharged Supercharged cannons fire farther as well as hit harder. Need we say more? Know Your Target Know your target's characteristics, especially speed and armament. When closing to \"dogfighting range, (less than 0.75 klicks), match speed with your target. This will help you stay on his tail and keep you from overshooting into a disadvantageous position.  Control Energy; Control Speed Use ELS configuration adjustments to control speed. In the X-wing and A-wing cach level adjustment to the lasers or shields will result in a 12.5% change in engine power level. For the Y-wing there is a 6.25% change. The actual adjustments are rounded up in your favor. Special Characteristics Of Imperial Star Fighters  TIE Fighter The most common Imperial starfighter, the TIE is small and highly maneuverable. Like the TIE Bomber and Interceptor, it has no shields and even less armor. Cruising speed is the same as the X-wing. Quite deadly in the hands of a skilled pilot, it is nevertheless completely outclassed by all Rebel fighters. . TIE Bomber TIE Bombers are the most heavily armed Imperial fighters. Each TIE Bomber carries lasers, concussion missiles, and proton torpedoes! In some ways, the TIE Bomber is comparable to the Y-wing. They have the same cruising speed and are the \"heavies\" of their family. Though not as challenging in a dogfight, its missiles make it the most dangerous of all the Empire's starfighters...beware!  TIE Interceptor The TIE Interceptor is a faster TIE Fighter with a stronger hull and four cannons instead of two. With a cruising speed equal to that of the A-wing, the TIE Interceptor is much more dangerous than its predecessor. In the hands of a highly skilled pilot it is very tough to beat, especially in a Y-wing. TIE Advanced The latest in TIE starfighters is the TIE Advanced. Like others in this family, it has no hyperdrive capability, but it does have shield generators. Its shields are not very powerful but they regenerate quickly. Because it is so difficult to hit there is usually cnough time between hits for the shields to recover. First encountered during the Battle of Yavin, this craft is even faster and more maneuverable than the A-wing! Even in the hands of a mediocre pilot this is an extremely formidable dogfighter. However, TIE Advanced pilots require considerably more training than pilots of other craft. Fortunately, the Empire has yet to produce significant numbers of them. Needless to say, it is even tougher to beat than the TIE Interceptor, and almost impossible for a Y-wing.  Assault Gunship The Assault Gunboat is the first Imperial design to incorporate shields and hyperdrive capability. Its cruising speed lies between that of the Y-wing and X-wing. This one also carries concussion missiles, making it quite dangerous in combat. Apparently learning from the Alliance, the Empire has begun to employ these *** * **** ** Wotan Weave Page 22 Computer Gaming World "

TIE Bomber TIE Interceptor 110 Communications In Battle TIE Advanced 125 [Shift-A] (Attack Target!) is the Assault Gunboat most important wingman comTransport 55 Shuttle mand. Use it often, especially when the enemy is coming from more than one direction. It is also a good way to get concentrated firepower on a single target such as a Freighter or Corvette when you wish to destroy it as quickly as possible. [Shift-C] (Cover Me!) should be used with caution. The reason is that if your wingman is already engaged and you order him to come to your aid, he will ignore the enemy he was fighting. That enemy will now have an easier time getting your wingman! Note that you must be currently targeted by an enemy craft to get a response. [Shift-I) (Ignore Target!) should also be used with caution. It is useful for getting a wingman to break off an attack, (should you wish to finish his target off yourself), but may make your wingman a sitting duck! You may notice that despite acknowledging your order, your wingman may continue pressing the attack. [Shift-W] (Wait for Further Orders!) should be used with extreme caution. It is more effective for getting a wingman to break off an attack but will definitely make him a sitting duck! Hits To Kill Table  Hull Damage At a certain level of hull damage a ship will automatically head towards its mothership or its hyperspace exit point. Unless their complete destruction is a part of your mission objective, let ships with hull damage go. If the arrival of other enemy ships depends on their destruction, this will help delay them.  Pilot Skill Level When assigning pilots, don't worry about the default skill levels. You can only improve their skill levels. If the pilot you assign is less skilled than the one who was assigned when the mission was built, no change will occur. Of course, you may still lose the pilot in combat!  Nonplayer Starfighters Note that nonplayer craft will not fire torpedoes at enemy starfighters, or missiles at other enemy craft that are not starfighters. Highlighted Ships The highlighted red part of a ship displayed in the CMD has no meaning except in the case of the Star Destroyer.  Brushing Off Your Wingmen When doing close fly-bys of other ships, avoid rolls and hard turns if you have wingmen. They try to maintain position and will often collide with the craft being flown by. [Shift-G] (Go Ahead and Engage!) to order \"waiting\" ships to get going. [Shift-H] (Head Home!) is useful for those pilots who are so skilled that wingmen just get in the way, (and prevent you from making ALL the kills!) Be careful, though, as this is another way to make it easy for the Empire to kill one of yours. The reason is that the ship receiving this order will have to make it to its hyperspace jump point, which may be some distance away, and will be vulnerable until it gets there. Note that in the heat of battle, discipline is often difficult to maintain. Avoid putting yourself between a wingman and his target and you will avoid \"friendly fire.\" The Farlander Diaries The following is excerpted from the combat diaries of the Rebel warrior, Keyan Farlander. The two entries were written during his first tour of duty, and contain detailed descriptions of the two most dangerous of his early missions. OP 4: Protect Medical Frigate Mission Briefing The wounded from the attack on Briggia are being brought to a Medical Frigate. You must provide security while the wounded are being transferred onto the Frigate. Three Medevac Shuttles and the Corvette Korolev must all escape into hyperspace after delivering their cargo of wounded. First the Shuttles and then the Korolev will dock and unload. The Corvette Korolev and the three Medevac Shuttles must all survive. Farlander's After Action Report I hypered in and began my mission start sequence, charging up shields first. The mission began quietly, but then an Imperial Frigate, the Warspite, dropped out of hyperspace about 11 klicks away and launched a group of three TIE Bombers and two TIE Fighters, then hyperspaced away. Immediately, I targeted a Bomber, wishing I had more help, then headed toward it at full throttle. With fully charged shields I set the shield recharge rate to normal and redirected all cannon power to the engines to get my speed up to 125. I switched to torpedoes, then when I got within 3 klicks of my target I reset shield and cannon recharge rates to maximum to bring my speed down to 50. Keeping my hand steady on the controls, 1 fired my first torpedo head-on because the distance between us was still greater than 1 klick.

Shields regenerate, however, so if there is a pause in the attack more shots will be necessary. The second number is the number of additional shots to destroy the target. For example, an Assault Gunboat's shields begin to fail after taking more than 20 hits. They may not completely fail for a few more hits, and then the hull itself can take a few more shots. Note that these figures are based on continuous fire with supercharged lasers. Also note that concussion missiles are not effective against the larger vessels. July 1993 Page 23 "

Two of my sources picked me up and were ready to carry me out of the restaurant. By that time, I decided the farce had gone far enough. \"Gee, you ladies are almost as strong as Zanthia, the main character in Westwood's sequel to Kyrandia.\" Of course, they immediately dropped me onto the floor when they realized the slurred speech was gone.

TT Te have covered the entertainment software industry for more than a decade. Even so, it is still amazing to discover concepts we had failed to consider. For example, we know pretty well how graphic adventures move characters V V about the screen, but we never thought about the strategies required to redraw the background for each frame. Again, we know how much attention is paid to the physics behind the vehicles/vessels in a simulation, but until recently, we never thought about the physics algorithms for a blimp camera. So, computer game design is a dynamic field that always offers surprises. This special section on computer game design has been produced to draw back the curtain a little so that readers can appreciate some of the personalities, philosophies and techniques which are taken into consideration when a design team starts work on a computer game. The opening article is the first half of our coverage of \"The 7th International Computer Game Developers Conference.\" Then, Chris Lombardi takes us \"Behind The Screens\" to view the voice talent work for Day of the Tentacle (LucasArts' new Maniac Mansion sequel). Next, the \"Abstracts from the Journal of Computer Game Design will talk about redrawing backgrounds in adventure games and other design problems. From the developers themselves, Verin Lewis tells us of the pleasures and perils of transforming videotaped images into computer game images, and Gordon Goble interviews Papyrus' Dave Kaemmer about next issue's cover feature, a hot new Indy car racing simulation from the developers of Electronic Arts' Indianapolis 500: The Simulation. After that, science fiction writer Martin Cirulis shares how he and Hugo/Nebula winner Lucius Sheperd have used SimEarth and SimLife ro create worlds for novels and short stories. Finally, Mike \"Moondawg\" Weksler reviews a book that can help readers program their own flight simulators (or, at least, appreciate what other people have to go through in order to do so), The Waite Group's Flights of Fantasy: Programming 3-D Video Games in C++. Here's hoping that our readers enjoy reading about designers, design ideas and game technology as we enjoy discovering how the games move from ideas to our computer screens. We think watching the making of the games is almost as exciting as playing them...at least from our vantage point. After all, we don't have to keep typing in those lines of code and hunting down clusive bugs. We only deal with the interesting parts, like the weird costumes game designers wear at the annual costume banquet. #define COLOR BOX IDTH #define COLOR_BOX EIGHT void CColorMenu :MeasureIt m(LPMEASUR ITEMSTRUCT 1pMIS) It all items are of fixed size Page 33 July 1993 "

Spectre was clearly recognized for its capacity to challenge gamers with realrather than artificial opponents. It was honored for its entertainment value as the presenters considered its service as a productivity destroyer. It was also cited as proof that the Macintosh really can do fast polygonfilled games. Spectre was designed by Steve Newman, Sam Schillace and Craig Fryar. Proving that there is still room for genuine innovation, the conference's next honor went to Dynamix' The Incredible Machine. Designed and developed by Jeff Tunnell Productions, the product combines something of the best aspects of Sim City and Lemmings. One programmer/artist even said that this was the game she always wanted to do and, in contrast to what rival designers usually feel about another's work, she felt they had done ir right. Another commentator observed that they've stuffed Rube Goldberg into the player's computer with this game. The presenters even claimed that the satisfying play experience could not be described, only experienced. The Incredible Machine was developed by Jeff Tunnell, Kevin Ryan, and Brian Hahn. Speaking of innovation making it difficult to describe a product, the developers didn't know whether to call Stunt Island (from Walt Disney Software) a flight simulation or a film cditing simulator. Those who nominated the product observed that Stunt Island provided a satisfying experience from placing the cameras to flying the aircraft. Most importantly, they observed that it was probably the first time someone would really want to see a saved game (i.e. film). Stunt Island was developed by Adrian Stephens, Ronald J. Fortier, Cary Hara, and Martin Day. LucasArts Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis was the next honoree. Although its multiple paths proved an inefficient way to make Indy \"three games in one,\" the designers commended Hal Barwood and company because all three paths actually work. Some nominated the game because of unique sections where one builds their own interface, and others appreciated the way this game focused on story and characters over puzzles. Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis was designed by Hal Barwood and Noah FalStein Observing that it is rare when the remake is better than the original, the final game to be honored was Accolade's Star Control 2.

Then, she reminds would-be writers that the dialogue must be kept short so that the gamers can get on with the game. For games like Return to Zork where actors are going to perform the lines, she observes that she keeps all of the character's dialogue together and lists the variations and reactions in logical order. Hence, the actor performs the dialogue all at once and the cditing and mixing can take place at a later time. This process enables her to do another task that she considers important, check the dialogue flow. She reads the sentences aloud in all possible combinations in order to see how they work. This is when one often has to cut out the lines that do not work. Em also encourages writers/designers to pen their dialogue sequences with programming requirements in mind. IF/THEN, GOTO and DEFAULT TO are ways to schematize the dialogue hierarchies in the writer's mind. Finally, she stresses the need to give each character a personal motive and a point of view. She even encourages writers to give each character a history, even if it isn't going to be expounded upon within the game.

Particularly interesting is his analysis of handling backgrounds as the animated character moves across the screen. He suggests several solutions to handling the background so that it can be re-used for the next frame of animation. Kccp a separate copy of the background. The copy of the background is copied over the visible background. This is somewhat expensive in terms of memory and is generally unworkable in the case of scrolling backgrounds. Regenerate the entire background every frame. Joiner says this is only possible if the background is created algorithmically or is tile-based. He warns that it is the slowest solution. Regenerate only the parts of the screen that were damaged. He suggests using a \"damage array\" would track what portions of the screen were overwritten by the figures. Joiner observes that this isn't too tough with tiles, since the coarseness of the array can be set to the size of the tile, but can get very complicated with multi-planar backgrounds. Save the background behind the figures and restore when done. This requires keeping an off-screen region just large enough to hold the background that the character can cover in a frame. Then, before drawing the character in a new position, the backsaved region can be restored (erasing the old character). Of course, this becomes more complex when there are lots of characters on the screen. Finally, Joiner suggests that programmers who use this technique should save, draw and restore in three separate passes to avoid drawing backgrounds that have portions of other characters. Faery Tale Adventure Walton also points out how tough it is to get product onto the shelves and keep it on the shelves. He gives a six-step strategy to accomplish this task.  Make entertainment products with broad appeal (or gear your budget to targeting a safe, proven niche). Know your audience better than the competition (to prevent returns). Find a publishing partner who has sufficient distribution and market clout to get your product on the market shelves. Developers should make sure that they ask the publishing partner the specific outlets where their products are sold and not accept \"everywhereÂ» as an answer. Make sure that adequate resources are devoted to markering your product at your publisher, especially MDF (Marketing Development Funds). Print ads create mindshare; MDF creates shelf space. Promote your own product vigorously. Helping to create momentum is vital (on-line, print press and personal tours of retail stores) Aggressively fix any problems and listen to customer feedback. IIIIIIIT define OLOR BOX W DTH 20 define OLOR_BOX_H IGHT 20 Invasion of the Expositorions (Chris Crawford, Balance of Power) Crawford could not be timelier with one observation. He notes that the expositorions (i.e. Hollywood-types) are coming into the industry and contends that this represents a problem (see Editorial, page 162). The problem is that these so-called expositorions (novelists, directors, producers and screenwriters) do not understand interactivity and think that it is a facer of the entertainment industry that can simply be added onto what they already have. Crawford rightly observes that \"Interactivity isn't some minor twist that we apply to the primary media of sound and image. It's the very essence of the medium. Sound and image support interactivity.\" As he sees it, the expositorions believe that they will be able to create the same old expository presentations that they have always made, but make it play on a computer. Crawford states that the expositorions are ignorant of the idea of interactivity, but wisely observes that their large corporate bucks and fresh ideas will more than compensate for their ignorance. He says he is going to join the bandwagon. He likes the creative idealism of the invading expositorions because they are risk-takers. He thinks they could create a new kind of media. Cow oid ColorMenu: MeasureIte (LPMEASURE TEMSTRUCT PMIS) Diskette Entertainment Software Distribution (Gordon Walton, Harpoon) Walton provides a cautionary tale for developers who seek to establish their own distribution at retail. He starts the article by showing what the software publisher actually gets for a computer game (if they're lucky).

It doesn't give me the sense that I'm in control of a car â more like it's in control of me, and it won't let me go where it's not safe to go. With the line magnet off, it feels even less like a car. The car set-up changes don't materially change the handling either. I haven't had the patience to see if they change your lap times. CGW: Was there ever any attempt to get your new product to the marketplace before World Circuit Kaemmer: No. We could've hammered the game out quickly, but I prefer to take the time to get everything right. Our new game will be as far beyond any other driving game as Indy was when it came out. Indy has stood the test of time very well. It's still selling, and a lot of people are still playing it, even after several years. We have exceeded that level of depth in the new game, so I'm not worried that another driving game will come along and take away from our sales. CGW: Finally, what will your new CCW. Finally game have to offer that is superior to World Circuit? Kaemmer: It feels like you are driving a real race car. The physics model is actually superior to Indy's. Engine and skidding sounds are dynamic, giving you feedback about the car's handling. Car serup is much more extensive than in World Circuit, and settings changes really alter the way the car handles. Plus you get to drive on many different types of courses: high speed, full throttle superspeedways, fastpaced short ovals, sweeping road courses and challenging city circuits. The circuits also have varying cambers (banking) as well as altitude changes. You'll find that a corner at the bottom of a hill will offer substantially more grip than one at the crest of a hill. The graphics have a tremendous amount of texture-mapping â projecting bitmapped images onto 3D polygons, much like Ultima Underworld â which adds greatly to the realism and the sense of speed. The cars are polygon-rendered in real-time, nor pre-drawn. Plus they are all texture mapped, so they look like real Indy cars, complete with sponsor's decals. They also break into pieces if they smash into the barriers. The instant replays are also very extensive, with a lot of TV-like camera footage (and the scream of doppler-shifted engines). If confidence is a virtue, Kaemmer is better than most. Only time and the game-buying public will decide if the \"new Indy\" has what it takes to out-drive the competition. In the meantime, though, it certainly looks as though the gloves are off.

This program won't be of much use to you if you are writing about exotic world forms like Rocheworlds or ultra-dense plancroids, but if you are of the old school and a basic spherical world of comparable size to Earth is good enough for you, then SimEarth is sufficient for some interesting experiments.

It was a little C T program that \"flew\" a gunsight over a grid (superimposed over green land with a blue sky). With visions of F-16s dancing in my head, I set out to program this sim. Eighteen months, several over-my-head computer books, two C compilers, one C++ compiler, and a third party graphics library later, I completed what more or less can be described as a flying lawnmower simulation with a nice \"cockpit\" and a graphical user interface. It was educational and fun, but it was a much more arduous project than I ever expected. What I really needed was a good reference book that was written at the intermediate programming level with easy-to-understand programming examples and ready-to-use program routines. My \"Lawnmower Commander\" was a patchwork of code from different books and programming libraries, and I remember thinking that there had to be an casier way. In fact, hacking into the wee hours, I would imagine an announcer coming over my stereo: Â«Does this happen to you? Can't get that poly-fill function to draw your sky? Is your gunsight permanently drawn onto the ground at some indisCOM criminate location that speeds by in a mocking manner? Can't get a clean compile to save your life? What you need is a book for the intermediate programmer that specifically addresses flight simulation topics!\" Flights of Fantasy: Programming 3-D Video Games in C++ is the very book my imaginary salesman would have pitched to me. \"You'll find all the essentials to create a complete working flight simulator as good as Red Baron or Falcon 3,\"touts the press release. Of course, this is ridiculous marketing amplification. Rather, this book is a great foundation for learning the fundamentals of C++ programming, bit-mapped graphics, 3D polygon filled graphics, and flight simulation. After reading a few of the chapters in Christopher Lampton's easy-to-read style, I soon realized that I could have written my \"lawnmower\" simulation in an evening with this one book, my Borland C++ compiler, and my hacker's enthusiasm. Of course, it would take staying up all nighr, but what programmer hasn't arrived at a clean compile with a Carl's Jr. breakfast burrito at dawn. 140 IIIIIIIIII to speed up one's calculations. Additional chapters cover the necessary math and viewpoint translation calculations necessary to get a flight simulation off the ground. The book also addresses topics all the way from the use of C++ \"classes\" and \"objects\" to optimizing one's source code with Borland's Turbo Profilera tool bundled with the Borland C++ compiler which allows one to optimize code. Additionally, the PCX viewing code in the bit-mapped graphics chapter will save the novice reader from getting in too deep with a third party graphics library. Unfortunately, there are some dry spots in this hacker's oasis. For example, the chapter covering fractal landscapes only provides a function for drawing a random jagged line across the screen, with a reference pointing the reader to more in-depth books on fractal 3D terrain generation. In other words, anyone looking in this chapter to try to figure out how to program the terrain to Comanche: Maximum Overkill or Strike Commander will be sorely disappointed. Also, the sound chapter, while providing the basics of interfacing with the SoundBlaster, could have provided more examples. Fortunately, the author provides a useful chapter on basic flight dynamics and then covers the featured \"FoF' flight simulation in depth. While not boasting gouraud shading, dithered horizons, texture mapping, nor any weapons or other aircraft to fly with/against, this bi-plane simulation is the perfect specimen with which to dissect and poke around in its guts. Especially interesting was finally learning how left, right, and rear views were programmed as well as 3D poly-filled mountains and other ground objects. Clean Compile Flights of Fantasy: Programming 3-D Video Games in C++ is available from the Waite Group Press for $34.95. While not as complete as touted, this 556 page book serves as an outstanding reference to the novice and intermediate game programmer. The wealth of provided code (both in the book and on the provided disk), flight simulation program, and useful bibliography give the reader the foundation for further studies in this mist shrouded area. Topics of discussion pertaining to this book and code can be found in the Game Design section of the CompuServe Gamer's Forum (GO Gamers), courtesy of the \"Fly by Night Group.\" One can find the author, Christopher Lampton, on CompuServe at (76711,311]. Hopefully, Mr. Lampton will follow up this work with an in-depth look on such topics as real time texture-mapping, 3D fracral terrain, and dithered horizons, bringing these esoteric topics into the realm of the intermediate game hacker.

"DBUIn GD-ROM HEUD KEEPING SPACE TIMELINE Journey Back to the Future in Presto Studios The Journeyman Project by Tony Reveaux The introduction to the visually stunning Journeyman Project leads you through a Ismoke-filled post-atomic apocalypse where rival nations unite in a peaceful utopian sphere. The convoluted plot begins in 2318 on the skyborne city of Caldoria, where the world nervously awaits the return of the Cyrollans. These squeaky-voiced aliens have ideas of global harmony more syrupy than anything Michael Jackson had ever dreamed. Within this universe on the brink of bliss, time travel has become a workable technology, but is restricted to prevent the time stream from getting warped by irresponsible use. the interface for the game. Journeyman's interface, like Spaceship Warlock and most other graphic-rich games, reduces the area of the action on the monitor by establishing a mechanical convention. Here, it is the narrow view-glass of the snap-on electronic monocular that is an integral part of the BioSupport Suit. Considering the weighty data chunks of QuickTime movies and sound files in Journeyman, it was wise to slim the window down. Even with my speedy Hitachi drive, I just had to get used to the drag-and-lag on the action as the CD-ROM data stream chugged along with long load times and slow uptakes. When the game is loading, it is impossible to move, select or save. Waiting and sweating is all that can be done. gating those modular corridors and tunnels.

Mining Survey early, survey often, survey everywhere. Get as many mines into production as early as possible. Fitz prices are high, and you don't need the staff elsewhere. Research  Have at least one team working on each research area as soon as you can get top people in each field.  If you sell a weapon, it will soon be shooting back at you. Military Ships on the ground at Harmony offer NO protection from enemies. Put idle ships on a patrol mission. They can be recalled or redirected if trouble arises elsewhere. With a maximum of eight ships per mission, it may take two or more missions to the same planet at the same time in order to defeat very powerful enemies. Have several Fox class ships available for transporting SIN agents around. SIN First Rule of Maelstrom: \"Mr. Fredricks is your friend.\"  Recon every planet as soon as possible. Don't blackmail people you want as a friend. Insurge the rich planets first, and only when a top-notch agent will get the mission.

"Devlet Transcontinental Competition Train photo by Russell Sipe MPG-Net's Empire Builder. bu Ken Hill Tante Empire Builder Loods formation Display About no yor many years there has been a niche in the board game market for games involving trains and railroads. This genre has produced some classic games over the years: Rail Baron, 1830, Railway Rivals and many others. One of the most popular rail games released in recent memory is Mayfair Games' Empire Builder (EB). Now, fans of EB can take their dreams of riding the rails to fame and fortune to the electronic network of the MPG-Net. With this excellent implementation of a classic board gaming system, the rail game fanatic can experience a game with other players around the world as easily as if they were all sitting around the same table. un Take A Load Off Empire Builder is a game played on a map of the United States and southern Canada in a modern era. The object of the game is to make money faster than your competitors. The players do this by picking up loads from es on the map and delivering these loads to other cities. Players have three demand cards (with three possible contracts per card) at all times which gives them nine possible combinations for earning the green stuff. For example, a demand card might indicate \"Cars to Los Angeles, $34 Million\" or \"Imports to Winnipeg, $20 Million.\" The farther away from the source of the demand, the higher the card will pay upon successful delivery. Players construct their rail network by connecting dots on a grid superimposed on the map. Starting from a major city like Chicago, New York or Seattle, they build track across the country which they can use to fill the needs of the demands listed on their cards. The price of track is determined by terrain; mountain milcposts and river crossings cost more than building in open country. Routes into cities are also expensive. Two preliminary rounds of track laying start the game, after which trains are placed on the map and a turn sequence of Â«move then buildÂ» is followed for the rest of the game. There are six major cities on the map. Other cities on the map fall into two other categories, medium or small. Access is limited to these cites in order to provide some competitive flavor to the building process. Most cities provide commodities roughly corresponding to their \"historical\" economy. Detroit provides cars, Des Moines and St. Louis, corn, and the Pacific Northwest or Maine, wood. Each turn, players move their trains around the map, picking up and delivering loads, and making money. Once a player successfully delivers a load, he or she draws another card from the demands\" pile and continues. Early in the game, most of the earnings are re-invested in track building to expand the network. Later on, players can upgrade to faster or more powerful locomotives to run on their mature lines. Disasters like floods, snow storms or strikes appear from time to time to hamper the players. Getting caught in a derailment or similar disaster can be a minor annoyance or a major tragedy depending on the situation. The first player to amass $250 million in cash and has successfully connected to five of the six major cities on the map wins the game. Net'n on the Rail Road On MPG-Net, potential players gather in a conference area and wait for other players to appear. Once they are ready to play, one player starts a game by establishing two guidelines for the game: starting cash and victory conditions. The other players join the creator in his or her game group and the game begins. Once the Windows-based front end is started by the host computer, plavers are presented with a beautiful representation of the game map in a window. Other windows soon pop up with additional information. Each player can see their current cash position, train level and loads they are carrying in a small window labeled \"You.Â» The player can also see the same information about the other players in the game (except for cash position). The \"DemandÂ» window shows the player's current demand cards, while a click of the Pille Command Londo Tantalus . Empire Builder Information Display About Wha; .

" MS49S Goes to Washington Photo by fack Rodrigues D.C. True's Shadow President by Chuck Moss abstract fashion. Troops are committed to countries or launched on invasions as casily as setting a number, and combat results are displayed instantly. This is also where a player can conduct-gasp!-nuclear war! their two cents on proposed policies, and will even resign if you do naughty things. (The Press Secretary is an attractive blonde. My wife dubbed her square the Â«Packwood Button.\") Power? You want it, you got it! Presidential authority is exercised through a series of menus and buttons. The Shadow Prexy can dole out foreign aid, rearrange the Federal Budget, and raise/lower taxes at whim. The budget menu allows across the board spending cuts the likes of which Ronald Reagan would have drooled for. In addition, the player may act as statesman and propose trade relationships, try to influence other countries' policies, attempt to bring about peace, or wage covert war. Finally, there's the dreaded Â«War Room\" in which military affairs are handled in highly Shadow President .C. True's new strategy game, Shadow President, is an extremely detailed geopolitical simulator that balances the world on its players' shoulders. It also allows players to kick said globe around like a beachbal, but that's definitely not advised. There are five alternate reality scenarios, all starting in January 1990, ranging from genuine Earth to Super-Iraq (guess who won the Gulf War?). The game runs in continuous time, with days varying from half a minute to several seconds. equiring a fairly sophisticated computer set-up, Shadow takes up 7.5 megabytes of hard disk space, a minimum of $50K free memory, a good sound card/speaker set up, and advises using a math co-processor and 486 chip. However, I ran it on a beat-up 286 and it worked fine. VGA graphics are crisp and up to current standards. It does occasionally lock up, particularly in some of the military sub-menus, but this might be due to my pushing the capacity of an older machine. Caveat: save often. The players of Shadow President find themselves transported into the Oval Office. There is no election. One just steps into the seat of power and starts to act. This is accomplished not only through the player's computer, but through the \"Shadow Network\" as well. The latter is the instrument that allows one to control the destiny of the United States and the world. The Shadow Network, or the onscreen display, is a world map with a series of buttons set below and to the side. Using the mouse, the player points and clicks to various countries, interacting with them much as in Chris Crawford's Balance of Power. A good President is an informed President, and this is where Shadow provides bells and whistles. Players can access country-by-country data from the \"CIA World Fact Book\" that comes as part of the software, accounting for much of those 7.5 MBs. A series of \"filters,\" or push buttons, change the map to display cconomic strength, alliance orientation, military spending, strategic value, etc. In addition, the player has a stable of advisors: Secretary of State, Defense Secretary, CIA Director, etc. These advisors will put in The Simulation of Presidential World Power Join The Network, Seize The World Shadow President gives the player a varied and sophisticated array of tools to monkey with the planet. The player defines the goals and the means. Whadda ya wanna do? Nuke Ohio State? Keep things running on an even keel? Raise the world's standard of living? Balance the budget? You've got the means, the ends are vour business. But this is not Risk. Conquering geographical areas until one covers the globe like the symbol for Sherwin Williams Paint Company is not going to provide victory. A player is measured by several scorecards. Most immediately important is Leadership Effectiveness Rating (LER). A low LER means that everybody laughs at you and kicks sand in your face. Every time a player does something that doesn't work out, LER drops. Guard that LER well, or you'll find even Chad won't exchange cultural programs. A second important factor is \"Ruthlessness.Â» Do too many nasty things and you'll find yourself assassinated. Third, your popularity with the U.S. electorate is key. Remember: he who has a 90% approval rating in summer 1991 can be out of office in January 1993. More importantly, let popularity drop too far and the game will be abruptly terminated with an impeachment notice. Playing Chicken On The Hot Line So how does the game play? With a fairly long learning curve. There are lots of subtle by-plays among the nations, lots of hidden actions going on. Everybody knows what's coming on August 2, 1990, of course, and Saddam can be easily thwarted. But he'll be back, and there are other pitfalls out there. As President, the player makes the international climate, and the more ruthless your policies, the more chaotic and violent the world bePresiden TITLE: SYSTEM: GRAPHICS: PRICE: PROTECTION: DESIGNERS: Shadow President IBM VGA $69.95 Documentation Look-up Brad Stock, Robin Antonick, Charlie Athanas D.C.

Conversely, be an international nice guy and the world smiles with you. Mostly. As a learning tool, Shadow does a good job of providing information and showing players how complicated the world is. As a simulation, it has certain real-world problems. A simulation, particularly one that draws heavily from contemporary headlines, must parallel the real world. This reviewer found certain...well, anomalies. Most jarringly, American armed forces are paper tigers. Saddam's army kicks U.S. tail whenever armed force is applied. A typical counter to Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia put a million and a quarter U.S. troops against 800,000 Iraqi soldiers. The resulting clash took months, and U.S. casualty figures mounted to the 50,000 range. This sure isn't the Desert Storm I remember. In addition, committing troops causes one's popularity to free fall indefinitely. Once again, this isn't borne up by any real-world situation. Even than a pinball game in a Chicago bowling Vietnam took three years for the public to alley. Fortunately, such actions are possible, cool, with Nixon reelected in 1972. Who since rebooting a game is infinitely easier than programmed this thing? Cyrus Vance? rebooting the world. More inaccuracies: the USSR is belligerent LOILLISEKERS and uncooperative. In 1990? Actually, Gorbachev was so desperate to save his regime, he was signing anything in exchange for cash. (Remember the Grand Bargain?) In short, as in many political games, the model reflects the designers' sensibilities rather than actual realities. How does Shadow work as a game? The problem is that you can't do cool stuff. Effectively running a nation is a tedious business Control tatil CHCIA) of details. A good world leader prevents bad Poslanom things from happening and works to raise Games that stress responsible management, boring things like Third World GNP. Alas, yer stay fun, emphasize hands-on challenges: an entertaining game must let the player be like Sim City, Civilization, or Railroad Tycoon. an activist, making things happen, bad or good.

As bere through menus and inputting numbers, for me, even invading Canada is more fun finely calibrating economies and relationthan carefully massaging the numbers in this ships. It's highly ethical and educational, but boring. A player yearns to break loose and do cducational, but less entertaining game. The something wild like invade Canada to bring reluctant verdict on Shadow President: a work home the Stanley Cup.

"@corpiom's Tale (Continued from page 80) However, we've been doing all this with one of the store's in-house monitors; my own is Fors. my own is still in the box. Let's just be certain and try it out before I take it home. The monitor is defective. If thoughts could kill, half the world's population would have died in that moment. It is now four weeks, almost the end of January, that I've been without a game computer. Not since I got my first Apple way back in '81, have I ever gone so long without a game to play. Never, with any system, have I had such problems, or been so frustrated. ARRRGHHHHH!!!!!!!! KIIIIIILLLLLL!! Fortunately, my self-control asserted itself and I did not actually go berserk, even though I certainly felt like it! We managed to get an order in to the manufacturer in time, and they promised the replacement would be there tomorrow. It actually did come the next day, and it actually worked. I lugged it home, and hooked everything up, mainly cables and wires, since all the cards were already inside. Then, I turned the system on, and it booted with no problems. Okay, so far, so good. Next, re-load all the files backed up from the previous machine. That went well. Try out ProComm Plus with the new modem. Hmmm, not dialing. Spend most of the afternoon fiddling around with settings and thumbing through the manual, my own hand printing, never mind writing, to finally track down the one letter I needed It's that bad (well, y'know, it ain't easy holdto change in to change in the modem string to make it ing a pen in a pincer). work ... but, I make it work.

If you or any of your readers have any questions or wish to find out more about our nerwork, call 800-438-4263 (GET GAME) and we'll be happy to assist you. Janet Brodhead MPG-Net Director of Customer Service Thanks for the update, Janet. We're always glad to print news about lower rates. SEALed With A Kick Warning: This letter contains strong language which may be offensive to some readers. I must obiect to the comments by Johnny L. Wilson in his \"Dancing with SEALs\" sneak preview in issue #106. How valid is his preview of a game based on the SEAL teams when he did not serve and proudly parades his anti-war attitude while ridiculing his acquaintance's son for his favorable viewpoint of special forces and claiming that Apocalypse Now and Platoon are realistic films. I served in Vietnam as a SEAL. We supported riverine operatives and helped the Navy PBRs (Patrol Boat/River) to interdict VC supplies shuttled down sampans and portaged through shallows by bearers. We intercepted VC couriers and after killing or capturing them, passed the information they were carrying to Navy Intelligence. I consider Platoon absurd, totally unrealistic and pure propaganda. The Green Berets, while being propagandistic on the other side, was much closer to reality, aside from filming the setting sun in the wrong direction, and instills a proper patriotic attitude in the boy mentioned. Most Americans have a strange reaction to the act of killing. In real life, you shoot the enemy and you kill him dead, whether or not he is armed, whether or not he is going for his gun, whether he looks dangerous or appears benign. That way, you stay alive and your men stay alive. Many of our senior officers and civilian leaders do not believe this. They would rather that we got killed than our enemies did. That attitude is stupid and it is wrong! My interrogation techniques could get a little rough; my guys could make hamburger out of two or three young, innocentlooking, unsuspecting VC. I did not worry about whether or not I was killing the VC properly (what is improper killing I wonder?) because at least my guys and I were out in the boondocks killing 'em, not sitting behind some desk or in a cozy college stroking our meat. To me, a Purple Heart is not a badge of honor. I consider them enemy marksmanship medals and I am happy not to have ever \"won\" one. In battle, I always kill my enemy before he has a chance to kill me and use whatever it takes. Never did I give Charlie an even break. I shot from ambush. I used supe rior firepower. I never engaged in hand-tohand combat unless there was absolutely no alternative. To me, the combat knife should be a tool, not a weapon. All the whiz-bang knife fighting, karate/judo/kung fu b.s. you see in the Rambo-Jambo shoot-'em-up movies are just that: bullshit. The real-life rules of war are simple and effective: stay at arm's length whenever possible and shoot the shit out of the enemy before he sees you. That is not ruthless, immoral or unfair. It kept my SEALs alive and there were fewer of the enemy. Keep your anti-American, anti-war attitudes out of your reviews and have veterans decide if a game realistically portrays combat. Harry Chicago, IL Dr. Wilson responds: I should have thought that the empathy that I, an admitted opponent of the Vietnam Conflict, gained for Vietnam veterans from my experiences of playing SEAL Team would have proven something of the healing value of the game. I also would have thought that my pointing out how easy it is to differentiate targets in the simulation, as opposed to the nightmare reality faced by you and your colleagues, would have indicated that the playing experience had brought at least a minor degree of additional understanding of the difficulties you faced. I said that my goal in playing the game was to survive. Your letter sounds like that was a realistic goal in the actual experience. That seems a point in the simulation's favor. I am sorry that you felt I was \"bragging \"about the purple hearts earned by my character. I was intending to show what an Â«ifly \"experience each mission had been for me. Indeed, I talked about the purple hearts and unsuccessful missions in the same breath. What I was attempting to show was how this program could increase one's sensitivity to the Vietnam experience, even to those such as myself who had seen the Vietnam vets as being on the other side\" because they weren't protesting with us. Playing the missions in the SEAL Team beta reminded me in a most powerful way that those involved in the conflict were doing their best in a thankless, impossible task. By the way, I was not the one who called Platoon realistic, it was the Vietnam vet of my acquaintance. Further, he was not disappointed with his son's desire to serve in the armed forces, but rather with his son's obsessive desire to see combat. For a different take on the same coverage, please read the following letter. Border Crossing I've been following this great magazine since 1985. There certainly have been a lot of changes in computer gaming, as well as changes in your magazine. I have always felt that your editorial staff has been responsive to your readers and always tried to present the best critical judgment on the current games. For a good job well done, I congratulate you. It is no small effort making it to issue #106. Page 108 Computer Gaming World "

The reason it seems CWW gets more limited Adventures in order to make their ou coverage is because of the specialized strategy quests. articles contained within. Cow By Rich Tennant I find myself in a quandary, critically, technically, and in a matter of personal taste. First, the technical: 1. I do not have the bucks to purchase a new computer, nor is my computer one that can be upgraded with a new mother board. I am rapidly finding myself left behind as more and more games require over 10 MB of hard drive space, as well of oodles of memory and speed that my 286 simply cannot muster. Most of the games that I would have played are now unplayable on my machine. Al well, such is the curse of ourdated technology. 2. As I peruse the games in issue 106, and as I browse my favorite software store, most of the games 1 see really don't interest me. Many \"walk-abouts\" that are just coming out seem to be simple rehashes of old Sierra and Infocom titles. Something as unique as Lemmings, as creative as Heaven & Earth or as captivating as the original Eye of the Beholder scrics simply seems to have gone the way of the old 10 MHz machines. This issue's emphasis on telegaming (again, prohibitive for me because of big bucks) and all the war strategy games leaves me cold. The \"Taking A Peek\" section offered nothing that hasn't been done before. I just don't think the industry is growing or developing newer and more creative games. It seems the industry is depending on technology (faster machines, better graphics, more disk space or CDROM) rather than using the old noggin to generate a neater idea of a story or make a better game. 3. And now for the criticism. The cover. I went to college during the Vietnam era. My memories of war are not glorious, nor do I think wars teach strategic lessons that can't be learned somewhere else. Having someone dressed in military uniform with automatic weapon in hand, trying to sight the enemy in what seems like a jungle setting is not my idea of fun and games. It instantly brings images of body bags, exploding mines (with flying body parts), friends killed and a black marble wall in Washington. The blood red border reinforces the death motif stronger than you realize. Your art department could not have done a better job of portraying an image so full of exactly the opposite of what CGW is about. David C. Hicks Whiteland, IN The cover photo was not just someone dressed in a military uniform. It is a historical picture and, along with the game, helps to teach some important lessons from history. We do not believe that history is learned in denial of or isolation from some of the uglier aspects of the reality. In SEAL Team, gamers are faced with choices similar to those faced by individuals in realistic situations. Without such products, based on painstaking research as opposed to conceived in the minds of the design team, our understanding of the past would be much lessened.

"msidethe mdustru -30 intermedia or Intermediate Technology? --3,620 New Visions and Old Questions Animate Multimedia Conference by the CGW Staff Aneta  ntermedia '93, the heir to the International 1 Conference on Multimedia and CDI ROM, featured an odd mix of skeptics and visionaries. One of the highlights of the conference was Mark Cantor, the founder of Macromind (publisher of Macromind Director, the tool used as an authoring tool for ucts), boldly stating in a general session that he didn't think CD-ROM products were very interesting. Another was NEWS Electronic Data executive, John Evans, comparing the average user of smart TV with his labrador retriever. Just as his dog gets confused whenever he has to go after more than one stick, so the average couch potato might become lost in the possibilities of interactive TV. More substantive was Tele-Communications Inc.'s John C. Malone boldly pledging that his company is interested enough in the marriage of multimedia and cable television that they would buy 14.5 million units of the first manufacturer to provide a \"magic boxÂ» for $350 or less. Along these lines, Microsoft demonstrated the Smart TV interface that they are developing. It was sobering to hear Evans talking about this industry celebrating sales of 5,000 units on a CD-ROM title in comparison with TV Guide's millions of readers, and to compare Philips' proud announcement of 100,000 unit worldwide penetration with Malone's breakthrough. It was a relief to hear substandesire to place millions of pieces of hardware tial discussion about standardization and in the homes of cable subscribers. It was alwatch one demonstration where the same most black comedy to hear entertainment compact disc (Compton's Newsweek InterAcveteran Barry Diller (formerly of both Parative) was used in a Sony MMCD, MPC, mount Pictures and Fox Television, curDOS-based machine with CD-ROM and rently the chief executive of the OVC Windows-mediated machine with CDshopping network) questioning the wisdom ROM and hear people like Sony's Dr. Toshi of anyone trying to sell an $800 box.

It was inspiring to view demonstrations of \"Did everybody sign the non-disclosure possible Smart TV interfaces and hopeful to agreement?

"1 BEST REST of the Edutainment 101 by Chuck Miller The world of shareware TEVE PER Nav VIE The word Â«edutainment\" was coined to describe a new breed of educational software; products that effectively combined education and entertainment in a single package. While the idea in software design may seem rather new, educators have employed it in the classroom for centuries. It is, in fact, no surprise thar learning can be increased by making the process more entertaining and enjoyable for the learner. Though educational programs have traditionally been relegated to the commercial market (very little has appeared in the shareware channel), more programs are finally starting to arrive from the creative minds of shareware authors. This month we'll look at three recent titles for MS-DOS compatibles: Word Blazer, Word Rescue and Math Rescue. I'd Like a Word with You Word Blazer by Multitask Software Systems is a digital derivation of the traditional crossword puzzle. As the first release in The Family Word Puzzle Game Series, Word Blazer is a simple offering, providing the player with an enjoyable gaming experience while unobtrusively helping him or her with spelling and observation skills. Of course, the devoted word wrangler will find it especially appealing. Word Blazer contains over 150 original crossword puzzles covering a variety of subjects from words beginning with the letter D to words describing things to wear. As with the traditional game, the player is presented with a puzzle from which he or she must locate all the words in a corWord Blazer responding list. When a word is located, the player highlights each letter of the word (with the mouse pointer) and selects the Check button. If the word is correct, it will stay highlighted on the crossword grid and will appear highlighted on the word list. If incorrect, the letters revert to their original state. Successfully comt to their original state. Successfully complering a puzzle rewards the player with an animated fireworks display. Several options are at the player's disposal. Puzzles need not be finished in one sitting, as those in progress may be saved for completion at a later time. Some basic hints are available for each puzzle, as well. And, a Clock option is provided for timed play. In addition, if one would like to take a puzzle away from the computer, a copy can be sent to the printer. The only drawback is that cach puzzle must be printed individually and one copy at a time. If Word Blazer is weak in any one area, it is presentation. Sound support is limited to PC speaker bleeps. Graphics, though VGA and SVGA are supported, are simple line drawings and fills. With the visual and audible quality offered in the newer commercial products, I hope that Version 2.0 of Word Blazer is upgraded in this regard. REZAC ELNUDO DERECHT. MXOLODORVOSKONA PINOBODABODE-ORNER BOX CUNCEZ KESEKREOECORONETOMORE While more of a mental diversion than a true edutainment title, Word Blazer is still a worthy steed to add to one's stable of workhorse education programs (the first add-on volume, Arts & Entertainment Pack, should be available as you read this). However, younger players will want to keep a dictionary nearby for definition hunting with some of the more difficult words encountered during play. Word Blazer requires an MS-DOS compatible system with 640K RAM, a Microsoft compatible mouse, a hard drive with 4MB of free space and a color monitor (SVGA, VGA, EGA). Registration is $49.99 (a little high given the quality of its presentation) plus $3.50 shipping and handling. A sample diskette is also available for $5.00. To place your order or for additional information, contact: $5.00 Sample Diskette Multitask Software Systems 237 West Spruce Street East Rochester, NY 14445 (800) 836-4721 Apogee to the Rescue! The name Apogee Software is not new to readers of this column, as several of their releases have been featured in the past. Now, with edutainment in mind, we turn to two of Apogee's latest releases: Word Rescue and Math Rescue. In Word Rescue (IBMPC RT #27849), the player must assist Benny Bookworm in undoing the dastardly deeds of the mean, old Gruzzles. It seems that the Gruzzles, who can't read, have been stealing words from all the books in the land so that others can't learn to read either. The player must help Benny by matching up each word with its appropriate picture so that he can get them back into the books where they belong. Math Rescue (IBMPC 130 11 RT #30766) is similar in story. This time, however, the Gruzzles are out after numbers. Benny, who is now a butterfly, again needs the player's help. This time, one must SULEJI altuiafufuardistatud restore all the missing numbers to their rightful 5 places (the Gruzzles have CUISGESE55 been taking them from traffic signs, paychecks Math Rescue and telephones, creating quite a stir), having one's mathematic skills of addition, subtraction and mixed questions tested in the process. Those familiar with Apogee's Commander Keen will find Word Rescue and Math Rescue to have similar environments. Both feature three different episodes (the first being shareware) and are horizontal and vertical, side-scrolling games with hand-eye coordination being important to play. And, like Commander Keen, action is of a nonviolent nature. Items are collected and opponents are Â«slimed.\" However, ZONOAUDODOM Print POKEMON O  N Page 116 Computer Gaming World "


"Chareware bell To register Word Rescue and Math Rescue and receive all three episodes, send a check or money order for $30 each, plus $4 shipping and handling to Apogee Software, or call their order number with a VISA or MasterCard in hand. Both games require an MS-DOS compatible with EGA/VGA graphics. Apogee Software P.O.

This makes both titles excellent choices for younger children. Word Rescue and Mach hell COIL Rescue are designed with SOSSOS ASSESSES youngsters in mind (though us older \"kids\" will still find them entertaining). Difficulty is adjustable to one of three levels: Easy (ages 4-7), Normal (ages 7-10) and Hard (ages 10-up), making the games great for  families with children Word Rescue spanning a large age bracket. In presentation, Word Rescue and Math Rescue are a step ahead of Word Blazer. While still EGA in mode (come on, Apogee, get with the VGA!), the graphics are more detailed and more attractive in appearance than those of the latter title. Music and sound effects, however, are excellent and add immensely to the atmosphere of the game (requiring an Ad Lib or Sound Blaster compatible sound card). In addition, both titles have the same high level of playability and addictiveness that has become a trademark of releases from Apogee. They are difficult to quit playing even for an adult! Both edutainment titles will Â«rescue\" the player from many dull hours, filling them with enjoyable learning. In fact, they are so much fun to play that one might actually forget he or she is learning in the process. Red Faced Phase We'd like to apologize for a little slip up in the May installment of this column. In the review of Catacomb Abyss we gave all of the design credit to Id Software. Actually, only partial credit goes to Id; they designed the 3-D engine used in the game. The creative credits go to J.A.M. Productions, a small development group headed by Jim Row and Michael Maynard. They have licensed Id's engine and plan to create a series of 3-D games for the shareware world. Their next product will be Blakestone: Aliens of Gold, coming to a BBS near you in July.

"Inn Maximila Ultrakill Electronic Arts' Ultrabots by Allen L. Greenberg PRIMITI ETTING SUNARE HTINTHIBIT obots are clearly a culturally diverse group of creatures. Artificial metallic beings first played a part, from time to time, in Greek and Roman mythology. The term Â«robot\" is actually taken from a Czech word meaning \"forced labor\" and first appeared in a play by Karel Capek in 1921. While robots have enjoyed many celebrated international appearances in film and literature, it was in Japanese animation that the creatures were finally elevated to the gleaming gods and demons of mankind's future. Now, robotic design has once again been upgraded, more challenging cities then become availthis time by a race of conquerors from ourer able. Ultrabots features 13 such cities which space.

There are three varieties of ultrabot, each with its own abilities and intended use. \"HumanoidsÂ» are indeed designed according to human anatomy, and are the most powerful fighters of the bunch. Equipped with some F OR FLY intimidating armor and weaponry, these creatures may also cause extensive damage by direct collision with another robot. Â«Scouts\" are the runts of the litter, and are best used for reconnaissance. While their armor and weaponry are weak, they are able to move far faster than other ultrabots. For spying purposes, they may alter their height and are equipped with more extensive sensor equipment.

It is most unlikely that an effective battle can be mounted away from the net. Therefore, the scorpions must be allowed to venture into unfriendly territory and they should only do so under the protective cyc of their \"big brother\" humanoids. In addition to their unique weaponry, the ultrabots are also equipped with a variety of defenses. These include deployable mines and decoys, electronic counter measures, and an invisibility field.

The real problem with Liberty or Death is that strategic command and control is not much more rewarding. All of the political and strategic elements of a revolution are accounted for in the game. Popular support is important, and chronic shortages of men, equipment, supplies and money all greatly effect the nature of the war. However, the documentation does not explain either the individual elements or their cumulative effect on the campaign. Charles Allah Mortally, wounded!! He digd uith his boots iberty or Death, the latest strategy game from Koei, recreates the American War of Independence. Players assume the role of George Washington or William Howe, attempting to either foster a successful revolt or stop it in its tracks. Unfortunately, Koei has done little more than regurgitate the same model and interface used on all of their previous products. This system was impressive when it was initially released with Nobunaga's Ambition over six years ago, however, it is now hopelessly out of date. From the EGA graphics to the weak documentation, no part of this product is anywhere near current industry standards. Furthermore, there is only one scenario and players do not have the option of a modified set up. There are no historical \"what ifs\" either in the setup or the occurrence of major international events. Liberty or Death follows the same provinceto-province format as all previous Koci games. Players control individual officers, icers, each of which has a military unit attached to him. Recruiting and maintaining forces are essential elements of the game, and players must be careful to keep a balance between the size of their army and the supplies and resources available. At certain intervals the commander in chicf must report to his political masters. This involves requesting military support and deleontino Ginancial resources. The player is responsible for the conduct of the war and can be relieved if the powers that be decide that HE PUNTAHYNUTELOMAEUTICHEN STAATELIAU TUAS Biberty the situation has deteriorated below acceptable levels When battle is joined, players have the option of controlling individual units via a tactical screen. There are a variety of options and command choices to be made at the tactical level. Unfortunately, most of them do not make much difference to the outcome of the battle in question. Perhaps the designers of Liberty or Death were attempting to simulate the frustration felt by British officers when they encountered irregular tactics from the American insurgents. The lack of simple geographical information is particularly annoying. Some provinces cannot be successfully attacked without the use of boats. This is logical and the use of boats adds an interesting strategic dimension. However, it seems strange that local commanders would not know they needed boats until they had actually invaded the province (by which time it is too late). Until players learn the peculiarities of the map they will want to save often and be prepared for multiple resets. Ultimately, the real failing of the tactical clement of this game is the inability of good commanders to gain better results than weak ones. While there are many things to do on the tactical screen, the battles are grinding attritional affairs. A good general can obtain a slight advantage through the use of terrain, however numbers will still decide the outcome of most encounters.

Corriere For instance, while support in a particular province may be raised or lowered based upon a number of activities, there is no explanation of the overall impact of popular opinion. As well, popular opinion appears to shift for some reasons (such as a military victory) that are not elaborated upon in the manual. When this is combined with a clumsy and out-ofdate interface, the construction of strategy becomes aggravating NU T ZERTU TANTZIALA ASTUTAB 2317 ufficers / regiments On Avoiding Â«DeathÂ» (Strategy Tips) The British fleet is a crucial asset. As a blockading force it can strangle the rebellion while providing much needed resources to the British; as a military force its bombardment capability can turn the tide in many battles. If heavy fighting is expected, the fleet should always be used to support land actions. If the fleet has been committed to an area, try to draw the Americans into battle along the coast, where the fleet may be used against them.

In tactical combat terrain, forts and hills can be used to minimize casualties. Entrench units wherever possible. Remember, superior numbers will usually determine the victor. A slight advanrage can be gained by attacking a single cncmy unit with two or more friendly units at once. Whenever possible equip engineers with cannons, as they are the only units capable of inflicting damage without suffering casualties of their own. They are also the only units which can harm the British fleet. Liberty or Death feels and plays in a linear fashion. Because there are no setup options and no scenarios, players will find themselves repeating the same actions over and over again. While there are a range of strategic choices to be made, winning usually involves following the same basic steps. Once again, this was acceptable five or six years ago. In 1993 it is merely tedious. Keeping an army in existence is also important, particularly for the Americans. The British can reinforce more quickly and with greater strength, especially at the start of the war. Do not overextend your forces by trying to control too great an area at the start. CGW Take careful note of the geography of each province.

"Friends, Romans, Taxpayers Acquiring \"Talents\" for Making Money in Caesar by Alan \"Perennial Taxpayer Maximus\" Emrich kay, I admit that I'm hooked on Impressions' Caesar, but I can tell from countless messages that I'm not the only one out there. Like many who enjoy this game, however, I'm not generating the kind of revenue I need to get my \"Prosperity rating in line with my other, more successful ratings. Thanks to some inside tips from Impressions, this article can reveal some of the revenue-building angles within the game and begins with some elaborations upon pages 77 and 78 of the manual. This first section touches upon the industry formula in Caesar. There is much going on behind the scenes of commerce that successful players should be aware of. a reciprocating effect on the ncarby laborers: enforced poverty! That will be discussed a little later on in the section on property values. Besides housing within three squares, nearby heavy industry centers also directly increasc jar production at workshops. Like the housing cffcct radius on workshops, this radius is three squares. Note that workshops do not need either housing or heavy industries within three squares to produce any jars of finished goods at all, but they will certainly produce more when these two important production resources are nearby. To Market, To Market, Jiggity Jig There is one last secret to increasing workshop output. If one has a marketplace either adjacent to or within a radius of six squares along a road, the productivity bonus is in effect. Of course, having more marketplaces as outlets for an individual workshop's goods will increase the demand and, hence, the output of jars at that workshop. Keep this symP biotic relationship constantly in mind when designing the commercial areas of your city. It is important to place heavy industry, workshops, houses, markets and roads in the most efficient manner so that they generate the maximum number of jars from each workshop. A last note on markets: their six square radius is not only important for indicating that works produced by workshops are being sold, but also serves as the radius in which they positively influence the growth of houses. Sadly, markets also limit the potential growth of a residential area, but that will be discussed a little further on. Collecting Business Taxes Jarring Revelations Industry is, of course, one of a player's two main sources of income (the other being the population tax). The tax base is represented by the productivity of individual workshops. * Workshop productivity is measured by the number of jars, up to a maximum of seven, in front of each workshop. Therefore, one must strive to get the maximum output from every workshop built so that they will generate more taxes and fill the player's purse. Page 78 of the manual lists the elements that can increase or decrease each individual workshop's output of jars. Allow me to elaborate upon them with specifics so that industrious urban planners can plan industrious urban areas: The rules encourage having a nearby workforce. The truth is that only residential squares within three squares of a workshop will have a positive influence on their producrion of jars. (This has nothing to do with unemployment, by the way, which is an entirely separate formula). The workshops have When collecting taxes, workshops are taxed as a unit. If only one square of a workshop is under \"administrative influence,\" the whole of the workshop is taxed and the player will receive full revenue from it. Remember, heavy industries and markets do not pay business taxes directly â workshops do! The formula revolves around a few key variables (the city's population, roads leading away from the city, etc.) but the number of jars in front of every workshop is the major deciding factor for generating more business tax income. Hint: The preset taxation values are at about the right level for maximum growth and maximum revenue. When adjusting them, it is generally wise to do so in small increments. For example, raising your business tax rate above 5% will cause production to drop off in later years, but note that there is a lag time, both for driving down the business market as well as for recovery once rates are again reduced. Therefore, avoid raising the business tax rate until the city is making a profit. Page 130 Computer Gaming World "


"  Improving Property Values and Slumming Around The other major source of revenue is taxing the citizens. This section will present information that will help you to build and maintain high property values, the yardstick by which this income is measured. Unlike SimCity, one need not think in terms of low cost housing for the citizenry. Instead, as many affluent neighborhoods as possible are needed for both domestic tranquillity and revenue generation. Table 1 The Land Value Table Map Symbol Val Rad Lim Baths Giant Baths +1 2 + 23 +1 3 School Hospital Avoiding the \"Filthy Lucre\" Syndrome According to Suetonius, Emperor Vespasian tried to raise revenues from the populace by instituting a very unpopular tax on public restrooms. When accused that this money was filthy lucre. Vespasian was sai have held a coin under the accuser's nose and ask, Â«Does it smell, my son?\" To keep one's reputation from smelling and driving the people to riot, it is important that drivir you raise property values. Always remember that this is the de facto measure of the population's standard of living in Caesar. Each square on the city map begins with a property value of 0. The proximity of virtually everything one can build improves that value, except for fires, rubble and new housing starts. This information is presented in Table 1, which defines the numbers used for determining land values. In Table 1, \"ValÂ» represents the amount added to the land value for each square of that borhoods near industries and businesses, the tile. For example, each square of a school maximum land value limit of 3 means that (which has a tile taking up 4 squares in a they will create and perpetuate slum living square shaped pattern) increases nearby propconditions to nearby houses. erty values by +1. Therefore, a square directly Finally, Table 1 shows that the value of adjacent to that school has its land value housing is modified by a variable known as raised by a full four levels (due to being within \"G.\" This stands for \"growthÂ» and is deterthe school's influence radius, see below). mined by one's tax rate and unemployment The Â«Rad\" value is the radius that each (the lower the better). individual square of a tile projects its modifier on property values.

"Deview createst Battles Atles of the The Greate 20th Century A Scenario Disk for The Perfect General by Richard Savage he Perfect General has remained on the ' 'Top 10 Wargames charts for quite a while. Now, it has spawned its second sequel, Greatest Battles of the 20th Century (hereafter GB20). GB20 contains 20 new scenarios to further stretch the tactical imaginations of hard-core perfect generals, spanning WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and a few hypotheriST BA TLES HEATEST The 20 new scenarios included in GB20 1967 Suez Conflict 1973 Suez Conflict Kursk (Battle of all time) The Moscow Push Stalingrad (Battle over a dead town) Long Binh Inferno Malta Crete Falklands Victory Operation Sea Lion Inchon Pusan Perimeter Saigon Bataan Fulda Dnepr Bridgehead Guderian Forward Shenyang Line of the kill Hollywood Dream cal Â«what-if\" scenarios. These range from the mored car and infantry to a pile of smoldering conventional WWIII type, where the Rusjunk. Once this tactic was discovered, howsians attack in Europe, to the more bizarre, ever, I soon learned to fool the computer into such as the Japanese attacking Hollywood wasting its firepower on other targets, or I (figuratively, perhaps not so bizarre) and finally, Ross Perot getting elected president and invading Libya! As you can see, there's some THE PERFECT thing for everyone here! GENERAL The game offers a broad range of conflicts. Five of them are about the Russian front in WWII, one of my favorite theaters of war. MICENJURY Vietnam and Korea have finally made the list, along with only one WWII Pacific theater battle, Bataan. There are two covering the Arab-Israeli wars, and the aforementioned \"what-if\" scenarios. All in all, there is a lot of good modem-gaming ahead for those who already own The Perfect General. Unfortunately, modem-gaming is the only way to play these scenarios and derive any satisfaction from them. I had hoped that, by the third installment of this game, QQP COPwould have improved the notoriously abysmal artificial intelligence.

Getting Around the Battlefield Movement is usually done in tactical mode. where a unit's path is defined hex-by-hex and filmed for one's opponent to observe. Those wishing to move greater distances (by rail or sca, say) or with some trust of their adversary, can opt to move pieces by strategic movement.

"neuneud The More The Harrier Climbing Aboard MicroProse U.K.'s Jump Jet by Paul Rigby The Harrier, with its complex flight models and unique military role, has been under-represented in computer simulations. Suddenly, like salespeople on the scent of money, several versions are showing up at once. One has already been released by urk, while another is the subject of this review. Named Jump Jer (D), this is the larest flight sim to be designed by Microprose UK. In ll one flies either an RAF GRS/7 or a USMC AV8B through day and night missions in practice flights, single sorties, a single day's worth of flying in any arena (to a maximum of cight missions) or one of three campaigns. Campaigns can be conducted in the Falkland Islands, Hong Kong or Nordkapp for up to 10 days. Upon completing a mission on any one day, the player is provided with an update of his side's progress. model and making it more realistic. The company also identified a number of advanced features that were targeted for // (see below for details) that never appeared in the final game. ]] cannot, therefore, be viewed as an action or \"fun\" game like Novalogic's Comanche: Maximum Overkill or an abstract tactical game like ATAC. Apart from heady statements of realism quoted in the manual, the company has marketed the game into the realm of realistic flight sims. \"You'll never get closer to the real thing,\" exclaims the box cover. This is the territory occupied by the Falcon 3.0s and Aces of the Pacifics of this world. With this in mind JJ immediately falls between two schools. Yes, the core flight model and in-flight operations appear to model the real thing quite well. They do not go to Falcon 3.0 extremes, but, on the whole, the effect is admirable. However, the real bummer is the campaign, the core of any flight simulation. Basically, MicroProse U.K. has taken a decent flight model, some fancy graphics and planted it onto an old-fashioned campaign structure derived from F-19. Witness the campaign 0001 1531 ... well, hidden (situated amongst a cluster of trees, for example). Thus, the action is forever available on the player's doorstep whenever one is ready to blitz into combat mode. As with most MicroProse simulations, the player can alter the difficulty and realism of a number of factors such as the flight model or the enemy. Other pre-mission factors include reviewing pre-selected waypoints on the tactical map, reviewing pre-selected targets, selecting one's armament and reviewing orders. \"Then, it's into the cockpit and away, from cither a carrier or ground base. The flight model appears to encompass most of the aircraft's actual characteristics, and meets all of the basic aeronautical demands. The stall model and the conversion from vertical to horizontal flight is competent, with reference points remaining constant during the process. In addition, the player is given a choice of HUDs for Nav, VISTOL and Attack. An example of 's realistic HUD can be observed when the jet is pulled up towards vertical. The HUD ladder bars then dip down and point in the middle towards the horizon, so that it is much easier to keep oriented at any time. This feature is portrayed well in the game. However, the HUD itself appears oversized. Microprose UK has developed a new graphic engine especially for JJ. It is a fractalbased landscape similar to Midwinter 2, but is \"gouraud shaded\" so that the scenery appears very smooth. Gouraud shading actually takes the individual polygons and smooths them out. The result is a virtually seamless landscape. On occasion, though, one can see the landscape being built, which doesn't help one's \"suspension of disbelief\" at all. The technique enables players to fly down valleys rather than over them, offering a tremendous visual experience. This scenic structure also yields some added tactical cnhancements, enabling enemy concealment on a hillside or, more alarmingly, just around the next corner. From here on in, ]] begins to rack up disappointments. A little background is in order. Throughout the game's development, MicroProse U.K. has boasted about the game's graphics and, more pertinently, its realism. Many times project managers and designers on the game have mentioned RAF Wittering (a UK, GR5 base) to recognize help and advice they received for improving the flight li Ta CES UMD The Hamer Strike Fighter In Explosive Front Line Action A word about the choice of Hong Kong as a potential flashpoint is necessary here. This was an inspired selection by MicroProse U.K. especially in light of present-day tensions between the U.K. and China over the status of the U.K. \"colony.Â» Of all the campaigns ofthe UK colony.\" Of all the campaigns of fered, Hong Kong offers the most imaginative arena. For example, one will observe a wide variety of esoteric aircraft, including the Jian6 (the Chinese MiG-19) and the Shenyang J-8 \"Finback.\" Realism takes a backseat on many occasions, though. For example, flying in the Falklands, one might be asked to strike against an Argentine aircraft carrier based off the north shore of the Islands. Of course, this never happened in the actual conflict as the Argentine Navy refused to get out of bed post-Belgrano. However, as a game, it does spice things up a little. Missions do not require long flight times because the player is based in a Hide. Hides are, of course, forward air bases which can be MR OPPOSE TITLE: SYSTEM: PRICE: DESIGNER: Jump let IBM (286/16 or better with at least 1 MB RAM, DOS 5.0 or greater, hard disk required) $69.95 Mike Brunton, Kristian Ramsey-Jones and Tim MicroProse Hunt Valley, MD (410) 771-1151 PUBLISHER: Page 146 Computer Gaming World "

The flight graphics are stunning, but very much require 486/33+ horsepower to fully enjoy.

ROM Time 8601 Wilshire Blvd., 8th Floor Beverly Hills, CA 90211 (800) 926-7273 HYPER BACKGAMMON: This game is a variation on the standard backgammon theme, where each player has only three stones and the game board is squeezed down to 24 \"triangles.\" All the normal rules apply and the doubling cube is included. The package boasts that the computer opponent (no two-player option) determines the best play for over 32 million game situations. This vast database is apparently the reason why the game is published on a CD-ROM disc. This extensive artificial intelligence plays a very strong game, but, unfortunately, there are no difficulty settings offered, so the computer will trounce all but the best human players. If one doesn't mind this fact, nor care much about graphic presentation, this product will offer plenty of quick-playing challenge. IBM with CD-ROM ($39.00). Circle Reader Service #13. Razzle Dazzle Raya Systems, Inc. 2570 West El Camino Real, Suite 309 Mountain View, CA 94040 THE AIDS AVENGER!: This action game is a platform from which to educate young and old about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and its result, AIDS. Players take the role of AIDS Avenger as he patrols his neighborhood in scarch of the goblins that are spreading incorrect information about the AIDS virus, irs causes and its effects. The AIDS Avenger is a thought policeman, listening in on conversations and reading people's minds, making sure they are thinking correctly. If not, he must input the correct information and then blast the goblin that was possessing the person and injecting these incorrect thoughts. There are four play levels, each escalating in the sexual explicitness of their content.

As in the previous Gobliiins, players must use the individual skills of the goblins in concert in order to bypass many fiendish puzzles. The landscapes are colorful and the animated gobliin antics even more so. Gobliins is a good choice for young and/or beginner puzzle lovers. IBM ($39.95). Circle Reader Service #14. LOST SECRET OF THE RAIN FOR EST: This new Sierra Discovery Series game offers a graphically rich adventure gaming environment for kids 10 and up. Its Indiana Jones meets Opie Taylor as Adam Greene, a young American boy, ventures to Iquitos, Peru, with his ecologist father to unveil The Lost Secrer. However, nothing goes as planned, and soon Adam is himself lost in a lush jungle with talking animals and beautiful plants. Armed with dad's Ecorder, a device for identifying plants, animals and pollution, Adam's mission is to learn the forest's secrets, re-unite with his dad, and make it through the day without frosted Cocoa Bombs or TV.

The program creates incredible psychedelic images of an amazing variety. What's more, it not only works in the Windows environment, but in DOS as well. While the packaging bills it as a graphics program, in addition to being a screen-saver, this supposed additional graphics program is actually some simple configuration for the screen saver and the ability to print screen images to disk.

PEPPER'S ADVENTURES IN TIME: Another new product in the Discovery Series, Pepper's Adventures takes a young girl back in American history to fix the awful mess her whacked-out uncle caused. Pepper, accompanied by her trusty hound Lockjaw, hangs out with the colonists to find out what went wrong and who that Ben Franklin guy is. She'll be aided by a Truth Detector (would that we all were), a good wit, and a jaunty walk as she makes the puzzle-solving rounds through storybook scenery.

This month finds Velocity with an update to their original Macintosh hit. In this new version, players still scoot around poly-filled cyberspace in tanks, but many new surprises have been thrown in the pot. There are new obstacles (acid pools, ice fields, cyber-mud) and new enemies (orbiters, slicers, hunt-killers) that can now be radar or optically cloaked. Fortunately, there are new weapons to battle these new baddies, including proximity mines, smart missiles, scattershots, among others. For gamers with access to a network, the game now supports eight nodes and 16 new types of multi-player games, including team cybersports like football and soccer.

It was the first game in which real painted images were scanned and used as the backgrounds for the adventure, and was the first game to sport Sierra's parserless interface. Although some players were disappointed in the move to a non-typing interface and the easier puzzles that this entailed, King's Quest V was an important landmark in a series that has defined a genre.
