Malstrom Graphic Artist Jack Rodrigues Patrick C. Miller's inter est in wargames and pyrotechnics bloomed simul taneously in 1970, while he was still in high school. Using plastic models, he and his friends created battle scenarios and torched the loser's inanimate casualties in a grisly rite of high-stakes combat. It wasn't until college that he discovered wargaming could be civi lized. He gave up his matches and flammable substances in exchange for historical minia. tures wargaming, where war is less incendiary. After a 15-year apprenticeship in the hobby, he eventually graduated to the ranks of computer gamers in '86, where he enjoys flight simulations, strategy and action games as well as more \"civilized\" games. PRODUCTION Production Manager Steve Spingola Production Coordinator Martin Waithall Paul Schuytema is CGW's columnist on Game Design & Technology. Known as the Scatman at CGW headquarters, Paul grew up playing all the clas sic games, from Dungeons & Dragons, to Squad Leader to Wooden Ships & Iron Men. In 1977 he purchased the Radio Shack Model One, a then-state-of-the-art game system complete with an awesome 4 K of RAM and a cassette recorder for storing programs. He played high school hooky during his senior year so he could learn to code 6502 assembly language on an Atari 800. After regaining his senses he returned to academia to pursue a career in science fiction writing. He now teaches creative writing and journalism at a small college in the cornfields of Illinois, and he can tell you for damn sure if something plays in Peoria or not.

Over the years he has shamelessly exploited this gift, emphasizing his graduate work on strategic planning to convince successive CGW editors to send him free stuff (strategy and wargames) as ollen as possible.

George Jones, otherwise known as \"action-boy,\" has been playing computer games since his first taste of Scott Adams' ADVENTURE for the Vic-20 at the tender age of 10. From that point until his hiring at Computer Gaming World, life was a constant justification for him. \"Yes mom, I can make a living playing computer games,\" he cackles. When he's not sleeping on the mag's snazzy leather couch after gorging on Mexican food, he can be found on the basketball court trying to regain his long lost jumpshot or immersed in his John Coltrane collection.

"JUST THE FAQS torical conflicts from a command perspective. They may be tactical, operational, or strategic, and stress anything from logistics and firepow. er to morale and leadership. They may be simple (PANZER GENERAL, EMPIRE II) to incredibly detailed and complex (PACIFIC WAR). How Do We Classify Games? Action/Arcade (AC): The emphasis is on hand-eye coordina. tion and reflexes, usually emphasiz ing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure (AD): Games where. in you control an alter ego and move through a storyline or sequence of events, where puzzle. solving takes precedence over con versation and combat. Classics/Puzzles (CP): Classics are old stand-bys and parlor games that appeal to many different types of gamer. Examples include: BACKGAMMON, bridge, chess, MONOPOLY, parchesi, Risk, and SOLITAIRE. Puzzle games are com puter games which emphasize spa. tial relationships, word games and/or problem-solving without requiring gamers to follow a story line. Examples would be: Shanghai, TETRIS and ZIG-ZAG. Role-Playing (RP): RPGs are a subset of adventure games, but stress character development, often through improving stats or other attributes. Conversations with nonplayer characters (NPCs) and tacti cal combat are generally more important than in Adventure games Finally, the game world tends to be large, and the plot less linear, often with some quests/treks outside the main storyline. Simulations (SI): Highly realis: tic games from a first-person per spective: you may drive a realistically simulated race car, fly a military aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed sci-fi environment. Usually polygon-filled technology is used to build the simulated world on the fly. Sports (SP): The sports game category is a broad genre which includes action (NBA Live) and strategy games (FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO) based on sports. Strategy (ST): Problem-solving short and long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X-COM, OUTPOST, MOO), as well as \"pure\" strategy games and \"software toys\" such as SIMCITY. Wargames (WG): A subset of strategy games, these recreate his What Is Our Reviews Policy? 1) We only review from the final copy of the game. Though it has become popular among PC gaming magazines to review from late beta copies, we feel that the reader is best served by having the reviewer look at the same copy of a game that the readers will find on the shelves. While we recognize that this causes some delay in coverage, we believe the reader is better served by such caution. 2) We expect our reviewers to finish the game. We want our readers to be assured that we do not review based on immediate or early impressions of a game. Our review ers give a game ample opportunity to show its quality. In some cases, bugs make it impossible to finish a game, but we identify situations where that has occurred. 3) We make every effort to match the reviewer to the game. We take into consideration the preferences, background and possible biases of the reviewer and, where possible, we find people with actual life experience or special backgrounds that match a game. We believe this policy enhances both the credibility of the review and the enjoyment of gameplay when the real world and the game world are compe. tently compared 4) We do not accept free travel from software or hardware compa. nies. We believe such gifts have a tacit assumption of coverage attached to them. We will only cover such events/launches as we believe will benefit our readers. HOW DO WE RATE? TITUD Outstanding: The rare game that gets it all right. The graphics, sound, and gameplay come together to form a Transcendent Gaming Experience. Our strongest buying recommendation Very Good: A high-quality game that succeeds in many areas. May have minor prob lems, but is still worth your time and money, espe. cially if you're inter: ested in the subject matter or genre. Average: A mixed Weak: A game bag. Can be a with serious prob game that reacheslems. Usually for the stars, but buggy, seriously falls short in signifi: lacking in play cant areas. Can value, or just a also be a game that poorly-conceived does what it does game design--and well, but lacks flair you will want to or originality. think long and hard before buying it.

"JOHNNY WILSON edi.toia MergerMania Game Companies Enter Spring Trading, But What Does It Mean To You? G used to think of mergers as the Wall Streel equiva lent of those bad jokes we used to tell as kids. Question: \"What do you get when you cross a hamster and a Macintosh?\" Answer: \"A faster processor.\" Oh, stop groan ing. You get the idea. It always seemed like Wall Street's \"Masters of the Universe\" were actively trying to see how inefficiently they could combine dissimilar companies. What does Revlon have to do with Marvel Comics? Nothing anymore, but the cosmetics giant once owned the comic publisher. By now, you all know that the computer game industry has had a lot of mergers and acquisitions in the last couple of months. At press time, Sierra was acquired by CUC International (see related story in READ.ME) and, in almost the same breath, CUC announced its intent to acquire Davidson (distributors of Blizzard Entertainment and one of the world's most successful educa tional software publishers). Ironically, Sierra had been in acquisition mode prior to being acquired by CUC, having recently purchased both Papyrus (NASCAR RACING) and Impressions (CAESAR II). Both Papyrus and Impressions were entrepreneurial companies with limited capital, proven technology and successful hits on their hands. The acquisitions also made sense because they filled holes in Sierra's existing product lines (racing simulations and strategy games). These acquisitions obviously made a strong Sierra even stronger. So, it was with some sense of shock that we read that CUC International, predominately a retail company (Auto Advantage, Shopping Advantage), had pur. chased Sierra in a stock swap (1.225 shares of CUC common stock for each share of Sierra common stock). We were surprised because CUC's master plan envisions the creation of the next \"killer app\" for the Internet, and Sierra had already undergone tremendous pain from their launch of the multiplayer game network INN (formerly The Sierra Network). To find out why, we talked with Sierra CEO Ken Williams. First, Ken reminded us that Walter Forbes III, Chairman of CUC, has been a Sierra board member for years. \"Walter Forbes has been on our board for a long time and he's always dominated our board meet ings. He's so dynamic and persua sive that if you had been watching our board meetings, you might have thought he was the Chairman of the Board instead of me. I hold the title, but he's the guy who's been driving us forward because I don't consider myself one of those Wall Street types. Before he was unofficially the ( The immediate result of a merger is a reduction in the actual number of titles sent to | market. Williams observed that Sierra currently has about 50 development groups. \"Every one of those 50 groups has the advantage of knowing about and having access to the cool things being done by the other 49 groups. When you build a new product, a portion of every dollar you put into development goes to technology and a certain amount to innovation. Being bigger means have to invest less money into the basic technology and have more to invest in innovation. It's not how high you reach in a product that makes the difference, it's how high you were standing before you started reaching. That's what's making us better.\" According to Williams, King's QUEST VIII will build off 3-D technology improved in RED BARON II, object-oriented programming from THE INCREDIBLE MACHINE and realtime character generation from another project in development at Sierra. So, Roberta Williams and her team will be able to concentrate on artificial character advances to move the company's flagship series to its highest level. Historically, the KQ series has been at the leading boss, now he's officially the boss.\" Williams went on to say that 98 per. cent of his role at Sierra has always been concerned with product. He said that the acquisition will allow him to continue to concentrate on building the right mix of product. asked him about the future and he seemed extremely excited. \"Every deal we've made,\" went the gospel according to Ken, \"has enabled us to make better product. That's what's good about getting bigger.\" Asked for specifics, CG APRIL 1996 "

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH YOU'VE GOT THE LOOK inally. Finally, you've taken the plunge and upgraded your look. For years, I firmly felt that CGW's sterile, blocky look undermined what has always been the best-written game magazine. Your new look, new lay. out, and especially your new editorials, are refreshingly excel lent, and finally bring the look of the magazine up to the stan. dard of the articles of the magazine (did I say finally?). For giving a longtime reader what he's asked for numerous times, my thanks! I do have a question which puzzles me. In your previews for WING COMMANDER IV. you stated that the use of film instead of video really would increase the quality of the cinematics, but that only Sony Playstation users would see the difference. You explained that PC users probably would see little change from the cinematics in WING 3. Yet, WING IV operates in full 16-bit color mode, which means quite an increase in colors which, coupled with the increased resolution, should make the film's enhanced quality readily apparent. I am not familiar with the specs of the Sony Playstation, but you'll have to excuse me if I find it a little difficult to believe that 16-bit SVGA resolution will not convey the increased quality of film to PC users. Raphael Tehan Berkeley, CA don't exist. But in the second level of the shareware Duke, you can kill female strippers in a bar. Violence against defenseless women is a very real problem, and for Apogee to add this \"feature\" for the gamer's entertainment is sickening and incredibly irresponsible. The shareware game is available for free from all the major online services and many internet sites. Anyone can access the game, including children. Now, I know Apogee's response: \"There's a parental password to protect children\". But I think we all know that kids are much more adept at computers than their parents, and some parents just don't care. There have been computers in my home for the past 12 years, and my parents barely know how to turn one on, let alone sct a password lock-out. The sad thing is that DUKE is prob. ably the closest thing to the \"Doomkiller\" everyone has been anticipating for the past two years. But what Apogee Unfortunately, they're probably right, but I really wish that Apogee and other companies would show just a little bit of decency, rather than catering to the lowest common denominator. I realize that I'm in the minority, and that my opinion is not a popular one. But what I am asking is for those people who feel the same way I do, don't buy the game, or any other Apogee game for that matter. I know it's tempting, but there will be other 3D games that will be just as good, if not better. Don't even pirate it... show Apogee and other companies that using shock-value tactics are only going to be effective for so long before they go too far. Lane Denson MISU We thought the strippers were put there to appeal to the Jesse Helms Militia. Virtual vigiI know it's hard to believe, but as PC-centric as we have tradi tionally been, we know that the Playstation has the advantage on this one. 76bit SVGA offers circa 35,000 colors. The Playstation supports more than a million. The 16-bit SVGA playback will be hindered by video compression issues. The Playstation has a JPEG chip. The use of 35 mm film should enhance the SVGA graphics some, but it won't be as noticeable as it will be on the Playstation. Of course, when it comes to resolution-the PC will win out. It just can'compete in terms of flesh tones and video speed. . AINHO OFF 1002 HERENTES =50/50 5:50/50 9 : TH GORE A GO GO DUKE NUKEM takes gore and graphic depictions to new heights, or lows, depending on your point of view. NUKE THE DUKE Over the past few years, I have watched the garning industry lean more and more towards gratuitous violence. For the most part it hasn't concemed me, but yesterday I downloaded a game which went over the line. I sure you know which one I'm talking about DUKE NUKEM 3D. Now I really enjoy the whole DOOMclone genre, but Apogee has released the most tasteless picce of garbage have ever seen. Killing monsters doesn't bother me, because they doesn't seem to understand is that it's the GAMEPLAY that made Doom so good, not the blood and gore, and certainly not the killing of innocent women. Apogee seems to think that more shock value equals more sales. lantes may not be able to do anything about national endowments, but they can put an end to natural endowments, Sorry about that. Anyway, we think the question actually hinges on verisimilitude. If you couldn't kill the strippers, you would feel like the game was unnaturally restricting you. Even APRIL 1996 "

"LETTERS play it, though. DUKE NUKEM 3D has the same thing going for it as the initial DOOM-gameplay. REBEL DEFAULT I'm writing to question Shane Mooncy's review of REBEL ASSAULT L. I am a 14 year old Star Wars fanatic (unlike the reviewer, obviously, who spelled \"womprat\" as \"wombat\") and found this to be an incredible game. I did agree on some complaints, mainly on how short the game was, but found many complaints to be quite critical. The toughness of the game could be altered through the Difficulty Editor, which I thought was a marvelous idea. I found the acting to be very decent, and I didn't notice it a bit. I personally don't find the lack of damn fun the game is. Maybe Mr. Mooney didn't find this game too Mooney didn't find this game too gripping, but for a young adult who has had a lifelong dream from childhood to ride a speeder bike and live with the Ewoks, this game was nothing short of stupendous. I loved every level, and have found the replay value to be tremendous. Iseriously urge any die-hard Star Wars fan to buy REBEL ASSAULT II. It puts every sort of Star Wars action on 2 CD's, without going on your hard drive. If this game packs half the punch for you as it did for me, you're going to love it. Ben Alschuler Hingham, Massachusetts though the game takes place in a fictional world, you'd probably complain, \"This isn't very realistic!\" We think that every individual\" in a game should be \"active.\" If it's in the game, you should be able to shoot it. That doesn't mean that you should shoot it, just that you should have the option. Of course, regular readers of Computer Gaming World also know that we think there should be consequences, too. In the real world, a person who touches a stripper usually gets speedily ejected from the premises. If Duke wastes the strippers, he is immediately assailed by (and often killed by) armed aliens. Maybe that will make the player consider killing innocents more carefully As to the other part of your point that the game implies violence to real women is okay-note that the women do not disintegrate into the bloody carcasses that the slaughtered monsters become. They disintegrate into money. One could even argue that the symbology is that strippers aren't real women, they're merchandise. Then, you could debate whether the game was making a subtle statement against or for the exploitation of women in such venues. BUT, the point is that no one who plays this game believes that the result of shooling a real woman, even in a strip joint, would be to get free money: The design team knew gamers and knew that gamers would shoot anything. They put in an unexpected effect that essentially savs, \"Okay, you did that. Very funny, here's some money (though it does you no good), go back to the game.\" Now, it's very obvious that shock value is intended in this game. You don't have priests string up in churches with upside-down crosses without going for shock value. It's not shock value that's causing people to LEFT-HANDED COMPLIMENT First off, let me say that I really enjoy reading CCW. The reviews and articles on upcoming games and breakthrough gaming technologies are very informative and insightful. I like playing simulators and action games and currently use a joystick called The Flight Stick from CH Products. I would really like to purchase al programmable joystick, but I have a problem. They are all made for the right hand and I am one of the many gamers/readers out there that is left handed. All my life people have been trying to make me primarily use my riglit hand. I have become adept at using my right hand, but my reaction time is not as fast as with my left. Could you tell me if there is any manufacturer out there that produces a version of their Combat/lighter stick for the left hand? John Penner From The Internet We did praise the graphics in our sneak preview of REBEL ASSAULT II (CGW #139, p. 148), but most of our readers are looking to both drive/fly We don't actually know of any left-handed joysticks. Perhaps Microsoft will build a Sinister Sidewinder. If there are any joystick manufacturers who offer such a device, please let us know and we'll pass it on. In the meantime, you should check out the programmable ones that have the \"right\" feel for your hand. HOT ON OUR TAIL Mr. Ben Alschuler would like to point out that REBEL ASSAULT l is an incredible game, the graphics are very realistic, and we don't know how to spell \"womprat.\" Thank you, Ben. freedom of movement disturbing, and as far as the controls go, I like the Wingman better than the Sidewinder and found the controls to be fine, considering that there was a joystick sensitivity editor. I also loved the lingo, such as \"It's darker than Sarlace's belly clown here.\" As for good aspects of the game, no mention was made to how realistic the graphics are, and how much the vehicles and shoot. We really get the feeling in REBEL ASSAULT II that we're on a rollercoaster as we shoot at the enemy. We know that doesn't matter to many Stars Wars fans such as yourself. Of course, if we were actually to shoot a womprat, we wouldn't know how to spell it.

You may attach a joystick, but Gateway didn't move the port to the front of the unit, so you're forced to reach behind the system to connect it-a daunting prospect considering most home entertainment centers are usually cramped and wire-packed.

The Harman software offers an on-line version of TV Guide, which allows you to browse program schedules, click on programs to select them, and even Search for shows by genre, rating and star count. But it could easily do much more-the system would be a much sexier buy for videophiles if you could password protect particular shows so children couldn't watch them, or click on programs and have your VCR automatically tape them. Although both NTSC and S-Video inputs on the system's video card allow you to watch VCR and laserdisc programs on the DESTINATION Screen, there's no soft ware provision for picture-in-picture. And while you can resize the TV display into a small window, the beta software we saw had no provision for setting the window to always display in front of others. Don't get us wrong-there are aspects of the system that are very exciting, particularly the huge monitor. Playing DUKE NUKEM 3D on a monitor with a 31.5-inch tube gives a new meaning to the word \"blast.\" The monitor is a TV tube with SVGAquality electron guns to allow highresolution displays (up to 800x600). We're also happy to see fast proces. sors and lots of memory. But it's a shame that DESTINATION doesn't live up to the potential offered by its unique hybrid nature, and that the hardware itself isn't thought out well enough to completely satisfy either the gamer or the consumer electronics buyer. Sure, it is the first of its kind, but when you drop $4,000 (120 MHz) or $5,000 (166 MHz) for a product, you want it to be right. We do see much potential here, and we want that monitor.

"READ.ME Intel (On Steroids) Inside ast year, Intel released Pentium OverDrive chips for 486 processors. These were somewhat under whelming due to perfor. mance limitations imposed by 486 motherboard archi tecture. Now the company has released OverDrive processors for These chips will be especially welcome to owners of 60 and 66 MHz Pentium sys tems, which, until now, weren't processor upgradeable. Although some Pentium 75, 90, and 100 systems can be upgraded to a faster processor simply by tossing in a new Pentium chip and throwing a few jumpers, many don't support the clock multiples of 2 or 2.5 times the speed of the system bus (versus 1.5x for the original chips) used by Pentium chips running over 100 MHz. Another consideration is system noise gen. erated by the high-speed chips-older motherboards may exhibit problems running extremely high-speed processors. The Pentium OverDrive chips include on-chip capacitance to avoid such problems, as well as a built-on fan/heal-sink combo. We tested two OverDrive chips, a 120-MHZ version designed for a P60 system, and a 166 MHz version designed to replace a P100. Both chips provided dramatic speed increases: Overall performance on the P60 system was around 50 percent better, while the P100 system showed almost a 40-percent speed boost. Note that these OverDrive chips won't quite bring older sys. tems up to the performance of the newest hot-rod PCs due to the faster chipsets and cache systems used on newer mother boards. With the 166 MHz OverDrive chip, a late 1994 Dell XPS 100 with an old Intel Neptune motherboard performed about the same as a new Gateway P133 system. Installed in a newer clone system based on an ASUS motherboard, the chip provided full P166 performance. For more information on the OverDrive chips, check out http://www.intel.com/procs/ovrdrive on the World Wide Web, or call Intel at 800-5383373.

After successfully acquiring Papyrus Software, publisher of NASCAR RACING and Impressions Software, publisher of CAESAR and Space Bucks, Sierra itself became an acquisition of CUC International, Inc. CUC is best known for its Auto Advantage and Shoppers Advantage services (among other travel, dining, and financial services) provided to 40 million members worldwide. The merger was handled via a pure stock swap with each Sierra shareholder receiving 1.225 shares of CUC common stock for each share of Sierra common stock. The transaction is valued at approximately $1 billion dol: lars. According to Sierra On-Line CEO Ken Williams, CUC international is approximately 10 times the size of Sierra. Williams believes the merger will allow the new company to both publish better products and to eventually create the elusive \"killer app\" on the Internet.

TURRET REMOTE WARM LION This game would have been a great title...two years ago, but Lion borrows so heavily from its predecessor, WOLF, without adding anything new, that it comes off looking like an old and dated product. LION offers the same role-playing experience as WOLF (you assume all aspects of the animal's life: hunting, mating, and surviving), except this time you are the King of Beasts in the African Savannah. However, the key element missing from LION IS gameplay. WOLF had it back in 1993, and it was a relatively groundbreaking and fun game. Lion's main problem is the graphics; they haven't been upgraded since WOLF, and they are so bad it's hard to discern a gazelle from a rock. Basically, Lion looks and feels exactly like WOLF did two years ago, save for the change of species and venue. Today though, without updated graphics, this type of game just isn't as fun anymore. E.

"SNEAK PREVIEW RED BARON II BARON VON SEQUEL E BREMEN CSNEAK GPREVIEW GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT Sierra/Dynamix's Ground-Up Remake Of A Classic Scores A Bullseye by Denny Atkin n July 6, 1917, a British bullet round grazed the skull of Manfred von Richtofen-the Red Baronand the famed pilot spun down to a crash landing. Although he recovered within a month and went back into combat, his performance didn't match his early glory-he scored only six kills in eight months, going a six-month period with only two planes downed. With the original 1991 RED BARON widely considered the benchmark World War I simulation (it can still be found on store shelves today), many sim fliers have been concerned that its sequel might fly more like the post July 6 Richtofen: impressive, but lacking its former glory. It doesn't seem possible to add all the bells and whistles needed to please today's sim flyer and still maintain the authenticity and fun that gave the original such long legs. Well, it might not be possible for many development teams, but when you take the experience and talent that created the original RED BARON and add in one of the creative forces behind FALCON 3.0 (perhaps the only other sim to enjoy Baron's longevity), you're not talking about just any development team. And I'm happy to report that the early version of RED BARON II (RBI) that I've been flying for the past few weeks indicates not only that RBII won't disappoint, but that it should blow the flying scarves off even the most jaded and experienced flight sim fans. CHASING TAIL If this pilot wasn't on our side, he'd be making peace with his maker about now. Windows 95 engine that serves as the foundation for most of this sequel's enhancements. You'll mouse your way around a nicely rendered base HQ to select your missions, track the progress of the war, and learn what's happening with your squadron mates. The interface strikes a nice balance between setting a World War I mood and allowing you to quickly accomplish your between-flight tasks. The aforementioned window sits atop a desk that serves as the game's control center. It's here you'll choose the type of game (Quick Fly, Single Mission, or Campaign), check high scores, and access other modules such as multi-player support and the mission builder. When you're playing in career mode you'll also have access to an officer's lounge where you can check the progress of the war in the local newspaper, eavesdrop on card games to catch rumors from your squadron mates, and so on. Finally, there's the Operations Office, where you'll plan your mission using a particularly cool sandtable interface. (The lack of computers didn't keep WWI mission planners from creating 3-D models of their target environments-they simply built them from sand.) Win 95 also plays a big part of the flight portion of the game. RBIl uses Microsoft's DirectX routines (Direct Draw, Direct Sound, etc.) in the flight module, allowing the game to take full advantage of the graphics hardware on your video card. Even the early, unopti BASE INSTINCTS The first thing you're likely to see upon booting RBil is a large win. dow behind an oak desk, through which you'll notice a Fokker triplane taxiing away.

"RED BARON II  SNEAK PREVIEW mized code I flew showed the advantage of this scheme--the frame rate in RBII was decidedly smoother under Win 95 than some equally detailed DOS games, such as EF2000, on the same machine IN THE AIR TONIGHT One of the driving forces behind RBilis Gary Stottlemyer, late of Spectrum HoloByte. Stottlemyer was one of the central designers of FALCON 3.0, and also helped design FALCON 4.0 before leaving Spectrum. Now he's tasked with making RBIl a game that will satis. fy not only gamers who started with the original BARON (and who are likely pretty hard-core by now), but also newer PC pilots. \"First and foremost, I'm a flight sim fan,\" Stottlemyer says. \"I got into this industry to do sims right.\" An aerobatics pilot who spent five years studying, researching, and implementing flight models for the FALCON series, he says he's confident that RBII's model has \"the right stuff.\" It's not some magic new modeling technique that make's RBIl fly well. \"Oddly, it's really just theory and formulae that's been around since the NACA efforts of the 1920's,\" Stottlemyer explains. \"It's only now that we have PCs capable of handling those calcula. BIRD SHOT As planes are hit by ground and air fire, control surfaces may be bent-or blown completely off. tions. Flying the planes in the current Alpha version of RBII, I was pleasantly surprised at some of the maneuvers I was able to pull off-and the ones I couldn't (and shouldn't have been able to). The maneuvers invented in RBII's era, such as Immelmans, can be pulled off, but you'll have to watch your speed or you'll also be able to test the authenticity of RBil's departure characteristics. Try to pull olf an F15-style zoom climb and you'll see how well the sim model tail-slides. These planes didn't have power to spare, and if you've never flown a WWI sim before, be prepared to learn some new combat techniques. \"My goal is to make the Al better than that in FALCON, with the emphasis on dogfighting,\" Stottlemyer says. \"I don't use a lot of silly decision trees with predictable outcomes. I've developed mathematical formulas which yield fluid, constantly updated spatial and conceptual objectives. These are then coupled to a middle Al layer which models the actions a real pilot would take (or not take) to achieve those objectives.\" In some sims, Al pilots constantly fly at the edge of their planes performance envelopes, executing maneuvers with a precision human pilots would find impossible to duplicate. That shouldn't happen here. \"The pilot responses are fed into the same flight model that the player is using. The other aircraft are being 'flown' Target-Rich Environment PILOT PROGRAMS Of course, realistic aircraft performance is only half the task at hand. Without worthy opponents, even a technically impressive sim can quickly grow tedious. 94TH AERO SQD. he Alpha version of RED BARON II we examined had a surprisingly complete graphics and sound engine, and we were able to get a good feel for what the environment will be like in the final simulation. Although the terrain doesn't look as good as that in EF2000 or FLIGHT UNLIMITED, it's a dramatic improvement over previous Dynamix simulations. Nicely detailed and camouflaged aircraft travel over texture-mapped terrain complete with towns, road networks, airfields, and trenches on the battle lines. Vehicles move from place to place, and if you fly low you'll see ground troops scattering to evade your bullets. (The bullets deserve special note-with small blasts and transparent smoke as you fire at ground targets, RBII has by far the most graphically impressive depiction of strating yet.) As aircraft are hit by gunfire or AAA, they'll start streaming semi-transparent smoke and belching flames from their engine compartments. Wings and other control surfaces may be bent, or even blown completely off. Damage is nicely handled by the flight model. Lose part of a wing and that side of the plane will dip from decreased lift; lose your tail and you'll flip end-over-end until you crash. Sound dramatically enhances the environment. As you dive at to attack an airfield, you'll hear the sound of air-raid sirens gradually glow louder. Doppler effects track aircraft as they fly from side-to-side. Despite the use of the same engine as SILENT THUNDER, the overall effect here is much more convincing, probably because the graphics engine can better handle the rolling hills of Europe than the jagged terrain of Korea. Quick Fy DESK JOB RED BARON II's main screen gives a new meaning to the term \"desktop interface.\" APRIL 1996 "


"SNEAK PREVIEW RED BARON II with the same control inputs the player generates with his joystick,\" Stottlemyer explains. \"You'll never see a plane doing something it can't really do using the flight model. this wasn't just a gentlemanly air war between aces. Stottlemyer is quick to point out that the missions you'll fly aren't scripted, as in many other sims. Rather, RBI uses an EF2000-style dynamic mission generator that creates a \"living\" battlefield. You won't just share the skies with your squadron and its targets. At any time, 50 to 100 missions may be taking place in the world in addition to your own. This means plenty of surprise encounters, as well as lots of targets of opportunity.

All the mission types found in the original sim will be here, along with some notable additions. Even the classic missions take place in a richer environment. When you fly a balloon-busting mission, you'll see far more attention paid to the front areas where the balloons operated. Expect to find bunkers, machine gun nests, and MORE TO COME If your preferred target of opportunity is the guy in the cubicle next door, you'll be happy to know a multiplayer module is in the works. Originally planned as an integral part of the simulation, Sierra/Dynamix has decided to break it out as an add-on package. Two-player modem play is planned, as is network support. The planned mission builder may also end up in an add-on module. Dynamix is taking the time to do RED BARON Il right. Originally slated for release around the end of this summer, the simulation has been pushed back, perhaps as far as Christmas. Although this is disappointing, we'd deal with a delay than end up with a flawed simulation. Given time to implement all the planned mission fea. tures, RBI should be as big a move forward for prop sims as EF2000 was for jet simulations. We have our scarves and goggles ready.

In addition, there will be observation balloons and Zeppelins. This list spans the entire war period from 1914 to 1918. Stoltlemyer says his team is pushing for quality performance and behavior for each plane, and they'll cut some aircraft from the list rather than sacrifice quality overall if time doesn't permit doing topnotch models for them all.

">WARGAME SURVEY 19TH WARFARE The Age of Transition BY TERRY COLEMAN The images of 19th century conflict that spring most readily to mind are the flash of muskets, followed by desperate cavalry charges and the thunderous roar of bronze cannon. All of these archetypal images stir our blood, and even invoke a certain martial charm. After a long drought of good games, computer simulations are once again bringing the 19th century to life, allowing us to experience the differences between Napoleon's nationalistic army, the inexperienced draftees and volunteers of the American Civil War, and the spit-and-polish professionalism of the late 19th-century Prussian and English armies. Join us as we look out over Missionary Ridge, capture the Serapis with the Bonhomme Richard, demolish Custer at Little Big Hom, and break the Old Guard at Waterloo, to lind which games bring the battles to life, and which are better left in the dustbins of history.

"WARGAME SURVEY AMERICAN CIVIL WAR \"I HAVE NO ARMY, GENERAL LEE.\" If campaigns aren't enough to quench your Civil War thirst, you may wage the entire war through Empire's (800-216-9706) CIVIL WAR, but you're better off passing this game by. The entire scale of the game is off-daily turns convert this from an epic struggle to mere minutiae manipulation. If you spend the time training troops, building ships and allocating factory output, you find that it makes very little difference in play, even at the highest levels of \"realism.\" Once you step onto the battlefield, all of the micro-managing becomes superfluous. I have no problem with real-time games per se, but Civil WAR proves my point that most real-time historical wargames are designed that way because the designers didn't want to bother crafting a real Al. Imagine refighting Gettysburg, where the armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginiathe finest fielded by the Union and Confederacy during the war-both rout and flee from the field of battle simultaneously! If you simply must play a real-time game, WARHAMMER and WARCRAFT II are light-years beyond this. A much better alternative is THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR: FROM SUMTER TO aegis he Civil War is a historical period that is embedded in the DNA of all Americans. It thereby holds a fas cination far beyond the average wargame. My own family was split asunder, some fighting to defend their beloved Southern states while others were convinced that the only way to save their country was to fight for the Union cause. On a recent trip to the battlefields of Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania Court House and other famous sites, I was struck by a particular contrast: an old tree marked the spot where Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson sketched battle plans in the dirt, conceiving their masterful rout of a Union army more than twice their size; in the back ground loomed a brand new office park. Ironically, at the same time our national battlefield parks are dwindling in size, the chance to relive those epic struggles through computer simulations is on the upsurge. The scarcity of Civil War games within the past decade can be attrib. uted to the erroneous belief of publishers that wargames were a dying breed-even though the mediocre Civil War games available sold well (especially every time Ken Burns' epic miniseries, The Civil War, was telecast on PBS). The phenomenal sales of PANZER GENERAL proved that accessible wargames with a strong focus were still a viable medium. So, it comes as little surprise that some of the most promising games for '96 share this accessibility. One such is ROBERT E. LEE: CIVIL WAR GENERAL from Sierra (800-757-7707). Lee is much more than just another traditional turn-based wargame. If you look past the hexagonal maps, you see clever arrangements of some of the most famous battles in American history: Antietam, 2nd Bull Run, and of course, Gettysburg. Yet, the heart of the game is in the campaign, which allows Lee, if tri umphant at Gettysburg, to invade Washington D.C. Naturally, this battle never actually occurred, but since there was, at least, a reasonable chance of Lee winning at Gettysburg, the designers can hardly be blamed for including the biggest \"What-if?\" of the Civil War. The game system emphasizes morale and training, and is the only game I've ever played from Impressions that makes you believe you really are on a particular historical battlefield. Cannon have the proper deadly effect on massed infantry when fired at short range, and enfilade fire, even from small arms, quickly disrupts enemy formations, just as it should. The specific battles require that you master a wide range of tac tics: Antietam sends a lumbering Union army against Lee's depleted forces, who fight with desperate energy to avoid being annihilated in a cul-de-sac; Fredericksburg is a nightmare for the Yankees, who bravely throw wave after wave of troops against dug-in Rebels: Gettysburg has everything. The real surprise is that the game system also seems to handle battles where maneuver takes precedence over set-piece assault, such as Chancellorsville. At this point, the Al is still in develop ment, with no assurance that it will match that of say, PG. But if the computer opponent is at all decent, the addition of modem and e-mail play, a fine selection of battles, and the chance to strap on the boots of one of the greatest generals of all time, should make ROBERT E. Lee the best Civil War campaign game ever designed for the computer. ES I New Bern XX wimington Horence HORD DDDD AC AO WHERE'S GRANT WHEN I NEED HIM? If Sherman says \"War is Hell\" and refuses to move, just replace him with another of over 100 leaders included in THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR: FROM SUMTER 10 APPOMATTOX. APPOMATTOX, a new version of Adanac Command Systems' THE ROAD FROM SUMTER TO APPOMATTOX II. Interactive Magic (919-461. 0722) is not simply revamping the graphic engine; they are also working closely with Frank Hunter, the original designer, to plug the holes in the Al. The main problem with SUMTER II was that it suffered from schizo phrenia: great strategic game; poor tactical module. So, the design team made the tough-and I think, correct-decision to cut back on the detailed battlefield aspects. What this does is free players to make the tough strategic decisions. Do I develop ironclads? Whom do I assign to keep Sherman away from Atlanta? Can Lee invade Maryland while Bragg ties down forces in Ohio and Kentucky, or would I be better off to send Longstreet to Tennessee? Can I afford to leave the inactive McCellan in control, or should I take the political hit and remove him? Rated for charisma, aggression and tactical ability, the 125 leaders APRIL 1996 "

"WARGAME SURVEY your favorite Civil War battle isn't included, just create your own with the powerful scenario editor: it lets you save and edit orders of battle, so that you can see how Lee might have fared at Gettysburg if Stonewall Jackson had lived to fight by his side. Also, if the promised cam paigns actually materialize, then we may have, say, The Genius of Ulysses S. Grant to counter Impressions' ROBERT E. Lee. For any historically-minded gamer, that's a nice problem to have. condiments you forget exactly what it is you're supposed to be eating. The morale rules were bizarre, and the combat system unsatisfying. Having thus bared my bias, I must admit that SSI'S (408.737-6800) AGE OF RIFLES (WARGAME CONSTRUCTION SET III), is so far beyond Koger's other work as to defy comparison. If anything, there is even more detail than in TANKS! But Koger shows a deft hand here, somehow infusing each of the major military systems of the 19th century with its own individual style. For example, the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War were RIFLES! only a few scant years apart, yet Rifles! effortlessly shows should be Norm the differences between the volunteer armies of the Union and Koger's crowning Confederacy, and the leatherachievement: bootstrap efficiency of the vic. torious Prussians. ambitious, rich Civil War fanatics will have a field day just absorbing the with detail, cornucopia of weapons data.

The remarkably sub mortars, artillery and cannon vary from the tle touches of puny 8-inch Columbiad to the devastating 20 both history and pound Parrot Gun. Units challenging usually represent medium-sized formations, such as brigades, which are rated for fire strength, melee, leadership, morale and supply. Advanced rules allow you to deploy skirmishers, change formation (line, march column, attack column, line, supported line, square, rest, entrench) and even to give units automatic reaction orders (a wonderful alterna tive to micro-managing). Flanking, communications, supply, hidden units, and random events (smoke, fire, etc.) are all tied together for the best 19th-century-and Civil War-battle feel yet. This is the first time I've seen stragglers adequately simulated in a Civil War game without overburdening the players. Yet, with all this detail, RIFLES! keeps the victory conditions simple: wipe out the enemy's troops, and control his objectives; it sounds a lot like the advice Lincoln kept giving his gener. als. The Civil War battles available in Rifles! simply blow away the com petition. I could have lived without Williamsburg or Franklin, but Bull Run, Fair Oaks, Five Forks, Corinth, Stones River and South Mountain (to name but a few of the 21 Civil War scenarios planned), are as good a tour of the Civil War as you could possibly ask for.

A pioneer in computer wargames, the DECISIVE BATTLES series broke away from many of the board game conventions of the day, particularly in the areas of communication and command control.

Cheng FLITE S un Acade Cisted on the Punt lace Curent KTS CONTAME THE WILD WIND Sometimes you just wake up with the urge to rake an enemy ship in WOODEN SHIPS & IRON MEN. f we are to believe most computer wargame publishers, U.S. military history began with the American Revolution and skipped straight to the Civil War. Thankfully, a small company called Incredible Simulations (HPS: 408-554. 8381) reminds us that there were important American conflicts both before and after The War Between the States. REMEMBER THE ALAMO is a tense, yet totally unpre. tentious wargame. Obviously a labor of love, it hides its low-budget production values with a clever use of digitized video clips of Mexican and Texan re-enactment troop footage. The game is tough to win: as in the real world, help almost never comes swiftly enough to save the beleagured Alamo garrison, and even the Tennessee long rifles can't hold the vastly superior Mexican army at bay forever. Travis, Bowie, and all the other great leaders (short of John Wayne) are here to add their strengths to melee and morale. Surprisingly replayable, Alan Emrich's CUSTER'S LAST COMMAND and a nice reminder of a strategy article is a CG Web near-forgotten heritage exclusive. CUSTER'S LAST COMMAND http://www.zd.com/-gaming develops the Incredible style, adding improved graphics and a friendlier interface. The controversial Custer and his famed 7th Cavalry are pitted against Sitting Bull in a number of scenarios, with tons of options. Should Custer swallow his pride and ask the 2nd Cavalry to tag along near Little Bighorn, or will taking a Gatling gun offer enough support? The combat system is much more sophisticated than in ALAMO, making the game quite viable for two players (the rumor that I have scalped Custer 10 times is unworthy of comment). A very good game on a controversial subject. AGE OF Rifles! breaks the Incredible monopoly on obscure American Wars with four battles from the Mexican-American War: Palo Alto, Buena Vista, Monterey and Pt. Isabel. And there's even a scenario planned for Little Big Horn, although the Rifles! system seems less appropriate here than that of CUSTER'S LAST COMMAND. come to the rescue then but Stanley Associates (5TH FLEET)?

All of the rich detail of the board game is here: canister, solid and chain shot; full, battle or mid-sail boarding parties, crew allocation and quality: changing wind guages; every major vessel in the U.S. and European navies; even a campaign game where you get to play John Paul Jones in the War of 1812.

"WARGAME SURVEY THE ART OF NAPOLEON SHIVERS ess elegant than Lee, hardly a god like Alexander, and certainly not as ruthless as Genghis Khan, Napoleon Bonaparte has been given shorter shrift in computer wargaming than even his diminutive height would seem to warrant. All he did was take the concept of maneuver along interior lines made famous by Frederick the Great and elevate it to a military art form. Until he ran into the Russian winter and then Wellington, Le Petit General was unstoppable, crushing the Austrians, Prussians, Russians and all other comers for nearly a decade. Napoleon's masterpiece, Austerlitz-where the Emperor left his center open to attack, that he might crush his enemies on either flank-is aptly re-enacted in the recently reis sued BATTLES OF NAPOLEON (SSI). A good Al and a fine balance between playability and realism keep this fresh--if you can get past the CGA graphics. In any case, you'll have a lot of fun massing artillery and rushing to form squares versus the well-timed computer cavalry charges. For Waterloo, you have a few more choices. EMPIRE Il does a nice, if simple, job of showing how the outnumbered Anglo-Allies under Wellington held out until the Prussians appeared on Napoleon's right flank. Overall, it is a lot like the old Napoleon at Waterloo board game (SPI). Austerlitz is also fun, but less detailed than in BATTLES OF NAPOLEON. It's really impossible to \"Last night I was so preoccupied in finishing Shivers that I was shocked to receive a phone call from my neighbor telling me that my lawn was on fire!!

"LAPTOP SURVEY Should Your Next Game PC Be A Laptop? A Look At How Portable GAMING FOR ROAD WARRIOR Pentiums Stack Up BY DENNY ATKIN DO Once upon a time, laptops and gaming were mutually exclusive. Now, the TOSHIBA situation is radically different. Pentiumclass portables, fully equipped with sound and CD-ROM, can be found for $2,400 on up. While price isn't yet on par with desktop PCs-you still pay a premium for portability-performance is. Today's laptops sport local-bus video and mobile Pentium processors running at up to 133 MHz-certainly enough oomph for all but the most demanding gamers. CG APRIL 1996 "


"LAPTOP SURVEY ROUNDING 'EM UP We took a look at the current crop of portable PCs and picked five systems ranging from economy laptops to no holds barred performance machines. With desktop PCs, the best choice is usually the fastest machine you can afford. With notebook PCs, though, there many fac tors to take into account. Is portability the main concern, or battery life? Are you a strategy gamer who'll be happy with a slower-updating dualscan screen, or do you need an active-matrix display that can keep up with sims and action games? Read on, and you'll be able to determine which laptops meet your needs. To be included in this roundup, notebooks needed a Pentium-class processor, sound support, and an integrated CD-ROM drive. Because we were testing systems running Windows 95, we requested notebooks equipped with at least 16 MB of RAM. We tested a mix of dual-scan and active-matrix screens in order to gauge performance differences between display types. THE PORTABLE PENALTY All of the systems we looked at were more than suitable as game machines, but certain portability compromises may make them less. than-optimum choices for some demanding gamers. Although all of these notebooks use local-bus video, their displays still can't hold a can dle, speed-wise, to their desktop counterparts. The lack of a separate numeric keypad can hamper play in some games, but all the units support plugging in a full-size external keyboard. Notebooks are a bit behind the times CD-ROM wise--the fastest available drives as this article was written were quad-speed, with three units still sporting now.obsolete dou. ble-speed drives. The feeble speakers built into these systems make even the cheesy units bundled with many multimedia systems sound powerful. Still, there are times when a game notebook makes sense. If you already have a desktop PC and you need a laptop, buying a fast CD. ROM-equipped portable beams you into the world of multiplayer gaming, Just connect your laptop to your desktop PC using a null-modem cable or network card and you're all set up for head-to-head play. If you're looking to replace an anemic 386 or 486 desktop PC, you can use your current keyboard, mouse, and monitor with a new portable system when you're at home, and just unhook everything when you hit the road. This capability is particularly convenient if you occasionally get together with friends for a round of network gaming. If you can handle the hefty price, chances are you can find a portable PC that's more powerful than the desktop unit you're using now. Next time you're on a plane flight, you'll be able to blast mutants with your BFG while the other passengers watch the edited version of My Girl 2. Which sounds like more fun? Screen Play MOBILE MUSCLE Today's mobile multimedia systems share a common feature set. Most ship standard with 8 MB of RAM; because they all also ship with Windows 95, we recommend bumping them up to 16 MB for best per. formance. Hard drives range in size from 520 MB up to 1.2 GB, and each unit includes a bay which can hold an internal CD-ROM drive or floppy drive. SoundBlaster-compatible sound and an internal speaker are standard fare, as are serial, parallel, keyboard/mouse, and monitor ports. All but one include IrDA infrared serial ports, while only one included a joystick port. Two Type 2 PC-Card (formerly PCMCIA) expansion sockets (which can together hold one Type 3 card) are standard on each unit. It's what's inside the cases that makes notebooks cost so much more than their desktop counterparts. Size and power restrictions demand innovative compact, low-power components. The Pentium based units use Intel Mobile Pentium processors, which run at 2.9 volts instead of the standard 3.3 V and which support special power saving modes. Some of the notebooks do away with power-hungry Level 2 processor caches in order to conserve battery life, using EDO RAM and other methods in an effort to make up for the performance loss. LCD screens are another big expense, as are the battery power systems. You'll find two battery styles, Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) and Lithium-Ion (LI); NiCad batteries are a thing of the past. Lithium-Ion battery packs offer longer life-over four hours for light word process ing use, compared to around two hours for NiMH-as well as \"smartbattery\" circuitry which gives a precise reading on how much power is left. You'll pay a price for the increased memory life, though, as the typical spare Ll battery pack costs about $200, double that of an NiMH pack. One thing you may not initially think to look for when purchasing a notebook is a real-mode driver for the CD-ROM drive. Without this, you won't be able to access the CD-ROM drive when you reboot Win95 into MS-DOS Exclusive Mode to play troublesome DOS games. All of the units reviewed here shipped with real-mode CD-ROM drivers, but some machines don't. (Early TI Extensa units didn't include real-mode drivers, but the company now ships them with new systems.) ne of the biggest decisions in choosing a notebook is whether to go for a dual-scan passive matrix display, or cough up an additional $500 or more for a TFT active-matrix screen. Today's dual-scan screens are much richer and sharper than first-generation passivematrix LCDs, but they may not be suitable for some games. They have a slow refresh rate, and games which update the screen rapidly can seem jumpy. Fast-moving objects may leave a ghostly trail as they cross the screen. These effects are more evident in simulations and action games than in full-motion video products. Active matrix screens, on the other hand, work hard to justify their extra cost. Colors are more vivid and contrast is much crisper than their dual-scan counterparts, and active-matrix displays refresh quickly with no jerkiness or ghosting. If you're going to be playing primarily fast-action games on your laptop screen, you should seriously consider an active-matrix display. If you generally use an external monitor when you're gaming at home, you can save a good chunk of cash by going with a dual-scan model. While conventional monitors can vary the size of pixels, allowing the typical 15-inch monitor to display full-screen resolutions from 320X200 all the way up to 1024X768, LCD screens have pixels which are fixed in size and position. With 640X480-resolution screens, this effect isn't usually noticeable. When you run a DOS game in standard 320X200 VGA resolution on such a unit, each pixel is doubled in size, leaving small 40-pixel gaps at the top and bottom of the screen. This gives a subtle letterbox effect. Three of the laptops We reviewed had 800x600 pixel displays. These screens should be fine for properly written Win 95 games, but DOS games that run in 320X200 or 640x480 mode (and Win 95 games stuck at a fixed resolution) will only fill about 80 percent of the screen.

"LAPTOP SURVEY CANON INNOVA BOOK 350CD Canon's sporty little Innova Book 350CD weighed in with the lowest street price (about $2,400 with 8 MB of RAM) and the lightest weight (7.2 pounds with battery, power pack, and CD-ROM), but it also uses the most anemic processor Canon Innova Book 350CD Canon uses a 100-MHz Cyrix 5x86 processor in the 350C. This Pentium-workalike can perform about as well as 75 MHz Pentium chip, but only when equipped with an external Level 2 processor cache to com. pensate for its slow 33MHz motherboard speed. (Pentium chips run the mother board at 50 60, or ties such as word-processing. The 350CD is available only with a 10.4-inch, 640x480 pixel, dualscan screen-one of the sharpest dual-scan displays we've seen. There's a connector for a docking station, but so far Canon hasn't mar keted one. Along with Win 95, Canon bundles SIDEKICK FOR WINDOWS 95, the OAG FLIGHT DISK, CITY STREETS, Fax WORKS 3.0G, an online user's guide, and a variety of online service access programs. We found the 350CD a fine unit for playing games which don't require massive amounts of processor power, such as PANZER GENERAL, CivNET, and FIGHTER DUEL. Its slower 5x86 processor and passive-matrix screen couldn't keep up, however, with the likes of EF2000 and INDYCAR 2. If you're on a tight budget, you need as light a notebook as possible, and your gaming habits tend towards adventure and turn-based strategy games, the Canon 350CD may be a good choice. But if it's power you seek, you're better off with one of the true Pentium systems. Innova Book 350CD. Estimated Street Price: $2,400. Canon USA, 800-848-4123, http://www.usa.canon.com. Canon TEXAS INSTRUMENTS EXTENSA 550CDT The Extensa 550CDT is the flagship of Ti's value-line series. (The company's most powerful notebooks are in the TravelMate 5000 series, but these aren't equipped with internal CD-ROM drives.) Despite its value-line designation, the Extensa 550CDT is no performance slouch. le TANSA OCUT 66 MHz.) Canon left out the L2 cache to keep the unit's price down, so the 350CD doesn't perform much better than a 486 DX4/100 system. It's a shame Canon skimped in the processor department, because the other subsystems in the unit are top-notch. The unit posted the fastest DOS video scores of any unit tested, and it beat all but the 120MHz Pentium system in Windows video tests. The unit was the only one in our roundup with actual SoundBlaster 16 circuitry handling sound output, and its quad-speed CD-ROM was one of the fastest of the pack. While the 350CD excels in multimedia functionality, its case design is somewhat flawed. The single speaker sits under the wrist rest, and is partially obscured when your hands are on the keyboard. The critical problem, though, is the placement of the 350CD's touch-pad pointing device. While all the other touchpad-equipped notebooks position the pad somewhat to the left side of the notebook, Canon's designers dropped it into the dead-center of the wrist-rest area. As we typed on the unit, we constantly found ourselves accidentally touching the pad when our right thumbs dropped to the wrist rest area, which in turn would move the cursor to a random spot in the docu. ment. Although the 350CD uses an NiMH battery, it still managed to post the best time on our battery tests. The unit stayed up a full two hours and ten minutes with power-management turned off, running a benchmark that was heavily exercising the processor, video display, and harddisk. You can expect over three hours of battery life for mundane activi. TI Extensa 550CDT Equipped with a 75-MHz Pentium processor, 256K L2 cache, PCI localbus video, and 16-bit sound, this value line unit offers snappy, if not blazing, performance Sound is provided with the help of an ESS688 sound chip on the CG OU APRIL 1996 "

"LAPTOP SURVEY notebook's motherboard. Under DOS this chip emulates an 8-bit SoundBlaster Pro, but it provides true 16-bit sound for Windows appli cations. SoundBlaster compatibility was flawless in all three notebooks that used ESS chips. Dual speakers above the LCD screen provide decent stereo sound. The single expansion bay can hold the included floppy or CDROM drives, or an optional LI battery. The 550CDT we tested included a poky double-speed CD-ROM drive and a 520MB hard disk, but by the time you read this the unit should be replaced by the new Extensa 560CDT. This unit is nearly identical to the 550CDT, but it substi tutes a 1.2 GB hard drive and a quad-speed CD-ROM drive. The 550CDT's touchpad is wellpositioned on the wrist-rest, but the buttons are somewhat stiff, making double-clicking a bit difficult. You can also double-click by tapping the touch pad, so this may not be a big issue. This model sports an extremely sharp 10.4-inch, 640x480 pixel, active matrix screen; a dual-scan screen is available on the 550CD/560CD units. If you're going to be doing most of your gaming on an external monitor, you may find the dual-scan unit's retail price-nearly $800 less than the active matrixquite attractive. The unit's NiMH battery posted the shortest life on our heavy-stress rundown test, a mere 1:04. An optional LI battery pack is slated to ship in April which should nearly triple that life. The Ll battery slips into the bay normally occupied by the CD-ROM drive, so it may not be an option when gaming on the road. A port replicator is available for the 550/560 series, but it simply duplicates the built-in ports and doesn't include a joystick port. The basic unit was the second heaviest of the bunch. While TI claims it weighs 6.4 pounds, it actually MPC CD-Note 900P weighs in for travel at 8.4 pounds with the CD-ROM, battery, and external charger. A good, but not exemplary, performer, the Extensa 550/560 series is worth a look if faster systems are out of your price range, Extensa 550CDT. Estimated Street Price: $3,725(560CDT), $2,750 (560CD). Texas Instruments, 800-848-3927, http://www.ti.com. In The Works MPC icron's new Millenia Transport has the potential to steal the \"Dream Machine\" title. Available with 120and 133-MHz Pentium processors, the Transport includes a 256K pipeline burst L2 cache, 16MB of EDO RAM, Intel's new Mobile Triton chipset, a built-in SoundBlaster 16 with dual stereo speakers, and a quad-speed CD-ROM drive. The 11.3inch, 800x600 pixel Screen displays up to 65,535 colors and is available in dual-scan and active-matrix models. A particularly cool feature is the inclusion of NTSC and SVideo output-just run a video cable to the big-screen TV in the den and gaming will take on much larger dimensions. Micron doesn't make you choose between a touchpad and pointing stick-both devices are built-in. At press time, the 120-MHz version of this 6.9 pound marvel was slated to ship at the end of March, with 133-MHz units following in early April. Prices start at $3,999 for a base model with a 120-MHz Pentium, dual-scan screen, 16MB of RAM, and an 810MB hard drive. CD-NOTE 900P Although MPC isn't as well-known as the likes of Canon, TI, Toshiba, and Gateway, we included the company's CD-Note 900P in our testing to get a feel for how the lower-priced, \"generic\" notebooks perform. The system is manufactured by Taiwan's Dual Technologies, and you'll find nearly identical units being sold by ARM, Chem, Future Tech, and other companies At first glance, MPC's CD Note units look like incredible bargains: at press time, a 133-MHz unit with 16 MB of RAM and an active-matrix screen sold for only $3,799. Unfortunately, some deals are too good to be true. Despite the presence of 256K of L2 cache, the 90-MHz unit we tested was dramatically slower than Toshiba's 90-MHz 410CDT; in fact, it was bested in most tests by the 75-MHz TI Extensa 550CDT. A more serious problem was the unit's inability to run some games, likely attributable to its use of the Gallant sound system instead of ESS or SoundBlaster chipsets. Although we had no problems running Windows applications on the system, we had plenty of trouble trying to get games to run from MS-DOS mode. FLIGHT UNLIMITED wouldn't run with sound active, and WING COMMANDER 3 wouldn't run at all. (WC3 also had problems in the graphics test module. If you're running Windows games, or games that will run in a Win95 MS-DOS box, you may be okay, but otherwise you'll probably want to look at one of the other units Micron Transport 82 CG APRIL 1996 "

"LAPTOP SURVEY need apply. CD-NOTE 900P. Direct Price: $2775. MPC Technologies, 800 672-8088, email help@mpctech.com TOSHIBA Control Freaks e searched far and wide for a PC Card (PCMCIA) adapter that would allow us to connect joysticks to multimedia laptop systems. We finally turned one up in the United Kingdom. The GameCard Mi is a Type 2 PC Card that supports two joystick channels and includes both MS-DOS and Win95 drivers. Our testing showed the card to be compatible with all the hardware and software we tried, including Windows and DOS programs, as well as basic joysticks and more complex ThrustMaster and CH controllers. JC Design is still seeking a U.S. distributor, so you may have to send your order across The Pond to obtain one of these handy devices. For ordering and price information, email reg@jcdesign.demon.co.uk, call 011-44-01371874478, fax 011-44-01371-874300, or write JC Design Ltd., Rood End House, 6 Stortford Road, Great Dunmow, Essex, CM6 1DA, England. JC Design GameCard II ager ulante Control GameCard II SATELLITE PRO 410CDT Toshiba knows how to build notebooks. The Satellite Pro 410CDT was by far the most solid, well-designed, feature packed notebook in our roundup, and easily wins the distinction of top choice for notebook gaming. This 90-MHz Pentium system lacks an L2 cache, yet still manages top-notch performance thanks to a fast EDO memory system and tightly integrated motherboard design. The 410CDT'S ESS688 sound chip and quad-speed CD-ROM drive provide top-notch multimedia performance, but, despite stereo sound support the unit sports only a single, front-mounted speaker. An includ. ed adapter allows you to connect the unit's floppy drive externally at the same time that the CD-ROM is installed internally: you can also mount for your gaming needs. This is really a shame, as the CD-Note 900P is the only unit we tested that includes a built-in joystick port. The unit's physical design clearly indicates some of the cost saving in its construction. It weighs in at a very hefty 9.1.pound travel weight with one battery, the CD-ROM drive, and the power brick. In a really strange move, the designers placed the dual speakers on the bottom of the unit, pointing down at your lap. Although that placement may add a strange new feeling of enjoyment to some games, it's not very acousti cally pleasing. We did like the use of an IBM Trackpoint-style pointing stick instead of a touchpad, as well as the option to use the floppy and CD-ROM dri ves simultaneously when running of AC power. You can also run dual NiMH batteries in place of both the CDROM and floppy drives, more than doubling the 1:12 battery rundown time to 2:45. An optional docking station includes three expansion slots, two drive bays, and a full set of ports. The CD-Note is available in a plethora of configurations, using 75, 90, 100, 120, or 133-MHz Pentium processors and either an 11.3-inch dual scan or 10.2 inch TFT active-matrix screen; both screens support 800x600 resolution. The dual-scan display tested exhibited disconcert ing color intensity variations between the top and bottom halves of the Screen. With bargain prices, built-in joystick ports, and numerous configura. tion options, we wish we could recommend the CD Note series for gamers. Due to the compatibility problems with DOS games and the less-than-average performance in our benchmark tests, though, only those on a very tight budget who'll be living exclusively in Win95 Toshiba Satellite Pro 410CDT the floppy in place of the CD-ROM drive. (The Toshiba was the only unit that allowed us to swap the CD and floppy without rebooting. Just put the notebook into suspend mode, swap the drives, then turn it back on and pick up where you left off.) The 11.3-inch active-matrix screen supports a resolution of 800x600 pixels; with 16-bit color (65,535 colors) support, and is the only screen in this roundup that displays more than 256 colors. The Accupoint pointing stick provides very precise control, but its driver caused recov erable errors when running AOL software, the one blemish on an other wise smooth system performance. A truly convenient feature is the unit's internal power supply-there's no brick to carry around, just a power cord. There's no joystick port on the unit, but Toshiba's port replicator for the 410CDT includes one. CG APRIL 1996 "

The notebooks we tested exhibited a mix of pointing sticks and touchpads. The touchpad has been growing in popularity because it's very easy to learn to use. However, gamers may find it worth climbing the learning curve and getting used to the IBM Trackpoint-style pointing sticks. Touchpads are nearly useless in Doom-style games, and pointing sticks allow much more precision in games such as CivNET which require delicate cursor placement. One particularly cool pointing stick enhancement was developed by CG publisher Jonathan Lane during the height of his Doom enthusiasm or addiction, as the case may be). He carefully carved off the end of a pen cap so it would slip over the top of the pointing stick on his Toshiba notebook. Presto-instant built-in joystick.

Of all the units mentioned in this article, only the MPC CD-Note 900P didn't sport one. These ports act like standard serial ports, transferring data at up to 115.2K bits per second. The difference, though, is that there's no cable required. They're designed for data transfer, but might they work for nullmodem games? We put them to the test running CivNET, FIGHTER DUEL, and DUKE NUKEM 3-D on the Canon Innova Book 350CD and the TI Extensa 550CDT. We simply told each game to set up a null-modem connection to the opponent's machine using the COM2 port. The games connected with no problem, but we initially had trouble with disconnects after a few minutes of play. Once we moved the notebooks a bit closer--within a foot or so of each other, across a table--the problems went away and we were able to complete games with no connection errors. Since IrDA connections require no extra equipment, you can now look forward to impromptu DUKE NUKEM 3-D deathmatches with other laptop-packing gamers in airport waiting lounges. 1 of the 50 demented characters you'll find in TOONSTRUCK Coming soon for PGCD ROM INTERACTIVE catertainment See Buster GNAW The Flesh From Your hand JOPTA boNey Stomp.

Gateway 2000, 800-846-4208, http://www. gw2k.com. mahinates Unleashed o test the gaming performance of the notebooks examined here, we ran a collection of benchmarks based on the suite introduced in the January installment of our \"Ultimate Game Machine\" series. The WINBENCH 96 benchmarks tested system performance under Win 95, with scores reported for graphics, disk, CD-ROM, and processor subsystems. WINSTONE 96 runs a suite of popular productivity applications such as WORD, COREL Draw, and LOTUS 1-2-3, and its scores indicate how each machine compares when you're forced to use the machines for productive purposes. PC BENCH 9.0 was used to test each system's MS-DOS performance. 3D BENCH scores are included to give a comparative look at how each unit will perform when rendering 3-D graphics under MS-DOS. We ran VBETEST, included with the UNIVBE VESA driver package, to test each machine's compatibility with the VESA SuperVGA standards. Every unit failed the test, but this seems more indicative of peculiarities with how laptops handle various display resolutions than actual incompatibilities. Of the notebooks tested, only one had any problems running any of the VESA-compliant game software we threw at them. To test graphics and sound compatibility, we ran Looking Glass Technologies' FLIGHT UNLIMITED. Finally, Origin's WING COMMANDER 3 was used as a further compatibility test, and to benchmark each system's real-world performance when loading CD-ROM-based entertainment software. Battery rundown tests were conducted by disabling power management features (to ensure maximum system performance) and running a series of benchmark tests that heavily exercised each system's processor, hard disk, and display subsystems. Note that the times listed here are absolute worst-case scenarios, and you'll be able to get much longer use from the machine under most circumstances.

"LOYD CASE TECHNOLOGY Gaming Under Windows 951 Is Windows 95 A Killer Game Platform Or Isn't It? Or Isn't uz a chi When OS is dead, or so says Microsoft. To find out, I've been playing some of the first native Windows 95 games like MECHWARRIOR2 from Activision and Mindscape's WARHAMMER: SHADOW OF THE HORNED RAT. I've also been following the discussion of these games on CompuServe and the Internet PC games newsgroups to see how gaming under Win 95 compares to gaming under DOS. I want to share some of the things I've learned about Windows 95 game performance, but first, I think we need some historical perspective to understand the evolution of gaining on the PC. (Que tacky segue melody.) In the beginning, there was MS-DOS, VGA and the IBM-PC architecture. Came programmers eager to exploit every drop of performance from the PC wrote to what was euphemistically referred to as the \"bare metal.\" In other worcls, part of the job of programming a game mcant the programmer had to understand the internal functions of the PC hardware, including graphics cards, The mass storage world is heating up once again. Seagate and Quantum will be upping the disk-storage ante with 2-plus gigabyte EIDE hard disks, which have rotational speeds of 5,400 RPM. Iomega is shipping versound cards and the PC itself. Some carly games (FALCON 3.0 comes to mind) were written entirely in assembly language. Assembly language is simply a text representation of the actual hardware instructions. Writing code in assembly language often meant faster performance, but it's notoriously difficult to write and debug. Meanwhile, Microsoft was busy shipping various versions of Windows Windows 10, Windows 2.0, Windows 386, Windows 3.0... But Windows was almost universally ignored by game developers for several reasons: First, it was much more complex to write Windows applications. Second, and more importantly, since Windows shielded the programmer from having to understand many of the underlying hardware details, it also proved to be a serious performance drain that simulation and action game designers couldn't afford. So most games continued to be DOS-based. When Microsoft announced that Windows 95 would do away with DOS as a separate operating system-although much of what was DOS underlies Windows 95 -there was a wailing and gnashing of teeth in the game developer community. Some of the folks in the multimedia group at Microsoft took note of this and decided that Windows 95 should become the next great game platform. Microsoft announced the death of DOS, there was a great wailing and gnashing of teeth. FIRST FORAYS The first thing they did, almost as an experiment, was develop a set of graphics routines that ran under Windows 3.1 called Wing, but it only proved to be fast with certain types of graphics, and did nothing to address issues such as controllers (eg, joysticks), sound cards (and MIDI) and multi-user play. In addition, WinG still didn't handle all of the graphics calls that game designers needed. WinC did prove useful, however. If you compare the graphics performance of the Windows version of SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION with the more current CiVNET, you'll notice that CINET runs appreciably better, because it uses WinG instead of the native Windows graphics libraries. Next came DCI, a very low-level application programming interface (API) used mostly for handling digital video streams. DCI was important for most graphics card vendors and mainstream multimedia developers, because it was a \"universal\" piece of middleware that allowed a video playback engine to take advantage of underlying video acceleration hardware on graphics boards. Digital video has since become a key component for some types of games. Of course, it wasn't enough. So the multimedia mavens at Microsoft, someLAB NOTES sions of its Jaz removable hard disks to PC manufacturer Micron, which is including the 1 GB removable drive in its high-end systems. Expect to see an extern al, SCSI version of the Jaz by the time you read this. APRIL 1996 CG "


"LOYD CASE TECHNOLOGY thing of a maverick bunch within the company, began a skunkworks project that was later code-named the Manhattan Project. Out of the Manluattan Project came a set of APIs Microsoft calls DirectX DirectXs component APIsDirectDraw (2-D graphics, digital video), DirectPlay (LAN-based and modembased gaming), DirectSound (audio, MIDI), DirectInput (joysticks, controllers) and Direct3D (3-D graphics)-allow programmers to have much finer control of and faster access to the hardware than Windows 95 would otherwise allow. Microsoft is pushing very hard to have DirectX blessed by both game developers and hardware vendors, and seems to have been successful in wooing both camps. Microsoft is pushing very hard to have DirectX blessed by both game developers and hardware vendors, and seems to have been successful in wooing both camps. lors' capabilities provided the board's drivers are DirectDraw-compliant This last point is really a key one. In the past two years, almost all graphics cards shipped are designed to accelerate graphics routines, particularly the ones Windows calls most. Very few DOS games took advantage of these features, because every graphics adapter would require a separate driver and set of code. With DirectDraw, games get any benefits from graphics acceleration automatically Similarly, the other DirectX APIs give programmers low-level access to audio hardware, networks, modems, joysticks and other features. THE PAYOFF When purchasing a new Pentium rig, be sure the motherboard has Intel's Socket 7 processor socket. Socket 7 will be pin-compatible with the upcoming 180and 200MHz Pentium chips, as well as the rumored Multimedia Pentium. So when you're ready for more MIPs, it will be too. If you're having problems configuring the Ensoniq Soundscape's Sound Blaster emulation mode, here's what you should do: First, make sure the Ensoniq DOS command SSINIT.EXE exists somewhere (probably in a directo ry called C:\\ENSONIQ (or the appropriate drive letter). Next, make sure the following commands exist in your AUTOEXEC.BAT startup file: properly. When you want to run a DOS game that doesn't directly support the Soundscape, you go to the ENSONIQ directory and type \"SSINIT\", or you can have this command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This technique also works with the plug-and-play version of the Soundscape, although you need to have the plug-and-play DOS driver loaded If you've been frustrated trying to get FIGHTER DUEL to work with the Matrox Millenium, you're not alone. However, the fix is quite simple. FIGHTER DUEL uses the driver version of UNIVBE 5.1 in order to support the widest vari ety of graphics chipsets in Super VGA. But UNIVBE 5.1 does NOT support the Matrox Millenium. All is not lost, however, as the Millenium already has VESA 2.0 built into it. All you need to do is go to the Fighter Duel directory (e.g., cd \\fduel). Then delete the UNIVBE driver by typing: DEL UNIVBE DRV, and FIGHTER DUEL will run properly. One of the most visible performance issues in games is graphics (no pun intended). Direct Draw replaces WinG and DCI, as well as adding much more. With that, let's take a look at what DirectDraw gives you, the game player. First, a well-written game using DirectDraw should (emphasis on \"should\" -more on this later) yickla Windows 95 game whose performance compares favorably with its DOS COUNterpart. Secondly, it allows game develop ers to focus more on the game and less on developing custom graphics routines. Third, it will reduce the frustration of configuration. This last point is a big deal since configuring a complex DOS game can be a daunting task, even for the technically sophisticated. One friend, a software engineering manager, avoids games that require complex installation, which limits him to a few games. In the last year or so, installation programs have gotten much smarter, but getting a DOS game to work properly can still be a royal pain in the posterior. Windows 95 games will make installation much easier. Since Windows 95 itself stores information on the system's configuration in the Registry, the game's installation routine need only query Windows 95 as to what's available, and configure the game accordingly. Fourth, the game should be able to take advantage of any graphics acceleraTHE ENVELOPE, PLEASE... So how does it all play? The answer, like so many in life these days, is \"it depends.\" Let's take a closer look at MECHWARRIOR 2 for Windows 95. When I first installed it, I was impressed with how easily it went. Then I discovered that calibrating a joystick occurred from the Windows 95 control panel. This was a real eye-opener. While no big deal for a single game, imagine now being able to calibrate joysticks in every game the same way. No more puzzling over how that new flight sim handles calibration. The game ran quite well on my P133 using the Matrox Millenium's latest set of drivers (version 2.2). On the other hand, Activision removed one of the graphics modes from the game. The DOS version can run at 320x200, 640x480 and 1024x768. The Windows 95 version is limited to 320x200 and 640x480. Still, the game performed very well, and I've been having a great time with it. Curiously, gamers' reactions have been mixed. Some players with very similar configurations to mine reported very poor frame rates, while others with much slower rigs reported great performance. I noticed similar contradictory messages regarding WARITAMMER'S graphics performance. I thought I'd experiment a bit by installing a completely different graphics carcl. With that single task, a long odysscy begana search for performance. We'll continue it in next month's column. & SET BLASTER=A220 15 01 SET ENSONIQ=C:\\ENSONIQ (or the appropriate directory) These environment variables must be present for SSINIT to work CG APRIL 1996 "

This makes me wonder if the usual style of party is not too rigid. Also, with this style, ordinary party memb ers become second-class citizens who basically get carried along without doing anything. Traditional parties are always in the same location-very constraining, I think what we will do is define an expedition window in the user interface. All members of the party can communicate with one another wherever they are-via this window. This means that the party can split into groups doing different things in different areas, but still be in touch and have the shared sense of being part of a coherent party. This will solve the problem of the party being in more than one location. It also makes sure that all of the party members are involved in solving the problems posed by the quest. Unfortunately, it introduces a new problem-time. If some of the party go to London to get a letter of introduction to show the authorities in Cairo; some go to NYC to research the time of Cleopatra; while some stay in Boston getting equipment together, we could have something of a mess on our hands. We wind up with a bunch of people doing things at the same time in real time, but using wildly differing amounts of game time, and in supposedly different time zones. One thing is for sure, we can't have people just standing around waiting for their time to catch up with everyone else's! I'm not sure exactly how we are going to handle this, maybe by having a time limit on each expedition. I will have to discuss it with the scenario writer, after he has gotten some idea about the size of the time mismatches. More next month! GC APRIL 1996 "

"REVIEW. ZEPHYR ONYX 19010NH)31 A New Bully On The Block After Some Hiccups, Zephyr's P 166 Game System Roars by Dave Salvator very once in a while, the whole can actually be less than the sum of its parts. Such was the case when we received Zephyr Computer Systems new hotrod machine for san ing, the Onyx. On paper, this is onc scary mother a Pentium 166 MHZ, 16 MB EDO RAM, 256 KB L2 burst cache, a Diamond Stealth64 Video 3240 graphics board, and a 1.6 GB EIDE hard-drive comprise ils core sub-systems. All signs pointed to it being a true monster. But despite these venerable components, the initial system we received didn't deliver as expected. There were problems several other apps and utilities. In addition to its heavy set of core hardware components, the Onyx also ships with a long list of high-quality peripherals: a 17-in. Nokia monitor, a SoundBlaster 16 with a Roland SoundCanvas daughterboard, a Sony SRS-D2K speaker system, a 'Teac OXIDE CD-ROM drive, a US Robotics Sportster internal 33.6 Kbps modem, an Intel Etherixpress 10 Mbit/sec PCI network card, among others. Zephyr also includes a three-button mouse and a Wingman Extreme joystick, both from Logitech. One big customer-friendly advantage is that if you don't like or don't need a few components, they can be removed and credited to your purchase price. for the most part, impressive. The Onyx's CPUMark scores were very good as expected, but only about six percent faster than the Falcon Northwest Mach V rig we reviewed in January. Its Disk WinMark score was disappointing, however: about 23 percent slower than the Mach V. Diamond's Stealth64 turned in a very respectable Graphics WinMark score of 28 at 800x600x256 colors, probably the drivers' optimized color depth, but its score dropped about 43 percent when we stepped the color depth up to 16.7 million colors. 3D Bench numbers were equally impressive, coming in about 14 percent faster than the Falcon's. Onyx's CD-ROM WinMark score of 609 was about Il percent faster than l'alcon's. Out of the gate, the Onyx disappointed us despite its very impressive array of hardware components. Onyx \"V 1.1,\" on the other hand, was a screamer, especially for DOS games. Fortunately for you, the company claims that the system's new configuration will now be standard. In its newly-improved form, the Onyx is delinitely worth considering if you're ready to pony up for blazing DOS game speed, and very good Windows 95 performance. & WORTH THE WAIT After the tweaks came the good part playing DOS titles --where this rig really delivered. DUKE NUKEM 3D, DESCENTII, FLICHTUNUMITED, and EF-2000 all had very fast and smooth frame rates, thanks lo Onyx's 166 MUIZ CPU and the Stealth64's S3968 graphics chip. In DUKE NUKEM, the action sped along even in 800x600, and the game reported a constant 15 fps frame rate. The only clownside to mention here is the Logitech Wingman Extreme joystick, which emulates a Thurst Master l'CS, but the Wingman lacks FCS precision and subtlety. In Windows 95, Diamond's drivers include the InControl tools that Diamond has implemented as shell extensions, which you can invoke by right mouseclicking on the Desktop to change real and virtual screen pixel resolutions, color depth, and enable/disable your screen PLUG & PLAY The Zephyr Onyx comes fully dressed for action, and it offers the fastest performance of any system we've tested.

"REVIEW  NEC M500 MONITOR Sight & Sound New NEC Monitor Is Ready To Play 19010NH)31 by Dave Salvator ooking for a multiscan monitor that won't bust the bank? NEC's new 15inch M500 may be just the ticket. The monitor's new ChromaClear La technology combines traditional dottrio and aperture-grille technologies with elliptical phosphors (rather than the traditional round or striped) to produce sharp, clear images. The EnergyStar-compliant M500 also has a pair of shielded speakers and a built-in microphone. Installing the M500 is fairly simple, though NEC's documentation doesn't list steps for adding the M500's driver under Windows 95. The M500's built-in Onscreen Manager (OSM) allows you to tweak image alignment, geometry and color saturation. Other settings let you adjust speaker volume, treble, bass, balance, and four different audio modes, two of which use spatializing techniques to artificially \"widen the stereo field. OSM's controls are easy to navigate and use, and they allow minute adjustments. The M500's image quality was very good under Windows 95, and its focus remained solid even at higher resolutions and smaller fonts. We looked at the screen's convergence at 800x600x16.7 million colors by displaying a grid of white lines on a black background, and saw almost no \"leakage.\" Under DOS, DUKE NUKEM 3D's rendering looked sharp, and its colors accurate. The monitor's maximum vertical refresh rates are also impressive: 120 I Iz at 640x480, 110 Hz at 800x600, and 86 Hz at 1024x768. Typically, if your vertical refresh rate is below about 72 Hz, screen flickering becomes noticeable and very annoying \"The M500's audio was less impressive, and gaming audio lacked any low-end punch, as did wave files and Audio-CD music. For basic no-frills audio, they're fine, but for chest-rattling explosions and convincing music, stick with your multimedia speakers. Underwhelming speaker performance aside, the M500 brings a lot to the party for $599. Its clear, well-focused display will serve gamers and non-gamers alike. NEC is also planning a $899 17-in. model, the M700, slated for release in June.& Price: $599 Manufacturer: NEC Technologies Wood Dale, IL (800) NEC-INFO www.nec.com Reader Service #: 325 APPEAL: Gamers on a budget looking for a clean display.

"REVIEW  EIGER LABS HEADON MODEM Interactive PC Game Models Phone Frag A9 010 NF011 Voice & Data Modem Lets You Add Insult To Injury by Dave Salvator Currently, Eiger Labs doesn't have an expected date when the HeadOn will support DirectPlay Microsoft's mutiplayer gaming API — under Windows 95. An upgraded set of drivers supporting 28.8 kbps data connections should be available as you read this. Eiger's web site includes a listing of opponents looking for playmates & iger Labs is hoping you'll start a fight with a friend. And they've got just the thing to set you off. Their new Digital Simultancous Voice and Data (DSVD) modem allows you to play point-to-point with another player on most of your favorite twitch games like DOOM II, DESCENTII, NASCAR RACING, and WARCRAFT Il among others, with more on the way. HeadOn's installation is fairly straightforward, though it's not a Plug-and-Play device, and uses the ever-vexing jumpers to set basc 1/0 address and IRO. Installation under Windows 95 requires that you mamally add a driver for a generic 14.4 kbps modem, with which HeadOn's bundled software can interface. According to the sparse documentation, a utility is supposed to step you through connecting with your opponent. We hit a glitch in our first attempts to connect where both players couldn't see the list of games to play, and as a result, we weren't able to get any games going. A new revision of the bun dled Phylon software fixed the problem, and the units performed well. There was very little latency in Doom II, though the voice signal had a perceived delay of about a hall-second. The HeadOn also ships with Windowsbased PlayLink software that runs on Windows 3.11 and 95, and performs the same task as ils DOS-based counterpart. It has some nice enhancements like a phone book for frequently-called numbers. PlayLink for Windows will work with any Windows-based title that supports a scrial connection.

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA  GAME DESIGN The Intelligent Soldier Cla Artificial Intelligence Takes On The Smoky Battlefield 1 sk Gary Kasparov if there's a computer chess simulation that can beat huim regularly, and he'll likely laugh in your face. But if you're an average chess player and take on a tough computer chess opponent, with the difficulty level set to maximum, you'll probably end up like me: a very sore loser, won dering just how the game's Al clic that. Chess has long been the game which has served as the benchmark for Al rcasoning. After all, it's a classic game, full of subtlety and challenge, and it's one of mankind's most difficult games, right? Let's consider the game a little more closely. The board is a homogenous checkerboard of eight by eight squares (64 in all). 32 pieces begin the game, but there are only six variations, and each of these possess very simple movement restrictions. When the Al in your chess game begins to contemplate a move, it has the luxury of evaluating every possible move for cach of its pieces, as well as the probable future ramifications of each move. These possibilities will most likely be mapped out in a min/max decision tree allowing the program to decide which move offers the maximum possible advantage. If you're playing the game at maximum difficulty, this Al reasoning for a single turn might take several minutes. Now consider a game like STEEL PANTHERS. \"The board is 80 by 100 hexagons in dimension. Each biex isn't blackor white, but can be road, clesert, hill, brush, water, bombed or smooth, etc. Instead of only six imit types, there are dozens, each with unique abilities, completely flexible movement (with restrictions, of course), and each with a unique objective in mind. The units must also be concerned with other variables, such as morale (do pawns suffer a rout due to low morale when they encounter a queen?). The level of complexity is \"millions of times more complex than in a chess game,\" says Cary Grigsloy, designcr of SSI'S STEEL PANITERS. \"Just think about it.\" When deploying the force, the Al routines actually do rely on quite a bit of ranclominess to offer the player a differentlooking force each time a scenario is played. For example, an armored force might contain anywhere between one third and two thirds tanks. Each nationality also uses a different approach to design their own fighting force. When fighting a battle, there is very little randomness. No matter what side or nationality, the game engine uses the same core Al, and the overriding mission is the quest to secure objective hexes. Occasionally, however, certain flags are used to indicate the way a given nationality might react in a certain situation. The only portion of the battle Al which relies on randomness is when a computcr-controlled force is on the defensive and has been driven back from an objective hex. In that situation, the Al might launch a counter-attack, but the timing of that attack is completely random. \"I don't want to have the Al thinking too much,\" confesses Crigsby. \"Simply plotting the best path from one end of the board to the other for each unit would take minutes of computation time, even on a fast Pentium.\" He points out that a human's natural ability to conceive of complex spatial situations in a matter of A human's natural ability to quickly conceive of complex spatial situations is impossible for a computer to duplicate. 22 QE2929 EDITOR WHO'S GOT THE BUTTON?: With 8,000 different hexagons, and dozens of variables for each one, the complexity of STEEL PANTHERS' Al engine makes a chess game look like tic-tac-toe.

Next, cach division commander evaluates luis own troops to see if they are all within his command radius. If not, then the first step is to order the brigades into the control raclius. This action may take several game turns to accomplish. Once mustered, the division begins to advance on the objective. Once in position, the brigades are deployed, holding one or two in reserve. At the brigade level, the meta-objective is broken down into \"local objectives\" generally only concerned with the four or five hexes to cach side of the brigade.

"Firing Blanks , put. Kar SCORPIA ADVENTURE/RPG ad venturi KS2s, fut. bare under Ytion A DARKSEED II Sows A Fallow Field DARKSEED // Sows A Fallow Field n the first DARKSEED, writer Mike Dawson rents a house in the hopes of getting some work done. Not surprisingly, the work he ends up doing has little to do with writing. He soon discovers that mysterious aliens, called Ancients, are plotting to take over the world. They operate from a place called the Dark World, a sort of mirror image of our own, and nowhere near as pleasant. Mike enters the Dark World and eventually puts an end to the schemes of the Ancients. Now, a year later, Mike is back in his home town, recuperating from a nervous breakdown caused by his experiences in stopping the Ancients. He is also the number one suspect for the gruesome murder of a woman he had been dating. Before long, Mike learns that the Ancients have returned, that they are somehow involved in Rita's death, and that once again, he is the only person who can save the world. HERO REGRESSION In the first game, Mike is an adult, and while perhaps not on the bestseller lists, there is the impression that he is at least an established writer. Mike II, on the other hand, seems barely out of his teens. His voice is young, and has an underlying whine to it. His reactions to everything are naive and juvenile, and on occasion, downright idiotic. Further, while he's been hoing for a year, he's been unable to renew any old friendships, and has managed to make only one new friend (who isn't much of one). Mike now has all the charin, intelligence, and personality of a used paper towel. If the player weren't directing his actions most of the time, Earth would be toast. Having to maneuver such a character is in itself a creary experience to begin with, and we wonder why this jerk is the person chosen to save the world. The story itself is hackneyed and full of stereotypes. The police are typical «dumb luick cops.\" Practically everyone met in the Normal World has some dirty little secret that eventually comes out during the game. Few of the characters are in any way sympathetic or likable. After a while, you begin to think that maybe the Ancients have the right idea, after all. As an adventure, this is what I think of With a nitwit for a hero, a stale plot, stereotypical characters, and a bizarre ending, there isn't much to like about DARKSEED II. WHO'S THE STIFF? Gone is the competent professional writer protagonist of DARKSEED 1. Mike is such a lifeless sap that you wonder how the world can ever be saved. CRYSTAL BALL INDESTRUCTABLES (nee INVULNERABLES) from Bullfrog/EA will be delayed until '97. Seems that the lead designer needed to resume his secret identity for a while.  Buoyed by their success with A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME, 7th Level's MONTY PYTHON & THE HOLY GRAIL Sports a bigger budget and more input from the Python cast. We were very impressed with how HOLY GRAIL integrates footage from the movie with Terry Gilliam-style animation added specifically for the game. The Knights Who Say (well, you know) should make their frantic interactive debut sometime this summer. APRIL 1996 "


"SCORPIA Bizarrelmages, Clean Interface 9d871NINJA OV COLOR ME DARKLY The best part of DARKSEED II is the artistic flow from H.R. Giger's over-active left brain. 016. he game's setup and interface are simple. At the top of the screen is the hidden menu bar. Positioning the cursor there makes the bar visible, and you can save or restore the game, change game settings, quit, etc. At the bottom of the screen is the hidden inventory bar; bringing the cursor down there makes the inventory visible. Everything Mike picks up is stored here, and there is no way to accidentally drop anything, which is a nice touch. The cursor itself is cycled by the right mouse button through three basic icons: an arrow, a hand, and a question mark. The arrow is used mainly to indicate exits; when positioned over someplace Mike can go, it becomes four small arrows. Clicking the arrows sends Mike to the new location. The question mark is used for finding things to look at or work with. When it touches something interesting, it changes to a question mark. Clicking that causes Mike to look closer at the item and make some remark about it. The hand icon is used for picking up or manipulating items on the screen, such as switches and the like. When the hand is clicked on an object, Mike automatically performs the correct action with it. When the hand is clicked on a person, it begins a conversation. You can also use the hand on inventory items. Clicking the hand on one puts the object on the cursor. The cursor (with item) is then clicked somewhere on screen to do something. For example, clicking on the carnival ticket puts it on the cursor. Clicking the cursor on the clown ticket taker gives it to him and allows Mike entry to the carnival. Moving around town is easy, as there is a map that comes up, with the five main locations of Civic Center, Carnival. Mike's House. The Diner, and the business district. Each of the main locations has one or more others leading off of it that are reached by walking. There is a similar map for getting around in the Dark World, and both maps allow for easy passage from one world to another Saving and restoring can be done at almost any time, and there are ten slots for save games. A separate menu lets you adjust the volume of sound and music, and, happy to relate, turn on text of conversations. You can set for voice only, text only, or both together. When using text, you can choose to have it disappear by itself after a period of time (slow, medium, fast) or let it stay on screen until you click the mouse button. The game runs cleanly for the most part. It did crash on me once during a return trip to the Underworld, but I avoided doing that a second time (only one visit is necessary), and had no other problems. All in all, this is a simple adventure game engine that doesn't get in the way of the story. Unfortunately, the story's not good enough for something to even get in its way. Hopefully, Cyberdreams will continue to refine this engine for better adventure game products.

Then you come to a halt, because nothing new is happening Now you have to go back over a lot of old ground to find what you missed, because until you do, the game isn't going to progress at all. Often, it's a matter of conversation, of having to find the right person and talk about the right thing. This can be irksome at times, especially after the Dark World is open, as now you have twice as many people to talk to and twice as much ground to cover.

There's blood in most of his books, and a fair amount of action in some, but Edgar Rice Burroughs he wasu'l. Given how often computer games feature subtle metaphysics and how often they feature bloody action, you might not expect to see Zelazny's work used as the basis for a computer game--not when there's still David Drake and Harry Harrison left to adapt. But we're living in a strange time, when both Alien Vs. Predator and Harlan Ellison's I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream attract game designers' attention. It is a pity that Zelazny didn't live to see it. CHIRONOMASTER is the most consistently enjoyable adventure game I've played in ages. It's a real throwback-and I mean that in the best way to what adventure games used to be.

The look on the screen is all polished chrome and airbrushed fiberglass. The computer-generated characters are a real improvement over the stiff puppets used in games like Interplay's CYBERIA or Byron Preiss Multimedia's THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES. Even the layout of the screen with its drop-down command bar and its insct window for displaying detailed animation is very much a product of 1996. But the underlying tone of the game and the milieu in which it is set hearken back to an earlier era of interactive story telling, a time when game designers aspired to evoke the great works of science fiction and fantasy literature rather than the set design of H.R. Giger or the lighting flourishes of Tim Burton. When you played the great Infocom text adventures, a world grew up around you by slow accretion, such that by the time the game ended you felt the reality of the game universe so palpably that you were sorry to have to leave it. I haven't been sorry to leave many games in the last few years; I was sorry to leave CHRONOMASTER. It's not that the worlds you visit in the game are strikingly novel they aren't or that the story is unpredictable. From the first scene, which shows a young boy escaping as his city is destroyed by space pirates, you can guess where the plot is going to go. Seven pirates were responsible for the atrocities, and now, enough years later for the boy to have grown up, seven private \"pocket\" universes are being thrown into stasis, one by one. No one knows who commissioned the creation of the pocket universes, and no one can guess why they are under attack. Unless, of course, they've seen the game's opening sequence. Regardless, the worlds are richly appointed, the story well-told, and that makes all the difference. It was Arthur C. Clarke who said, \"Sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic,\" and he is right again here.

"REVIEW  CHRONOMASTER ADVENTURE/RPG mention dialogue) of a much higher order. The puzzles aren't hard, but they have what I like to think of as \"heft,\" a cerlain solidity and truth to the situation in which they appear that makes them memorable. ALIEN ANACHRONISMS The various pocket universes you visit combine the familiar with the exotic, as in this \"Art Deco meets energy barrier\" twist. stasis. Your character, a builder of univers cs known as «Kerala the Chronomaster\" has been hired by the 'Terran government of Universe Prime to hunt down the \"World Key\" at the heart of each universe and use it to jump-start time again. But cach World Key has been hidden by that universe's designer, meaning that Korda has to take the grand tour, exploring every planetary nook and cranny to unearth the gears and levers that make cach world run. Korda is able to move around on worlds that have been temporally frozen because he carries a supply of \"bottled time.\" There is a problem, though any thing lie passes nicar gets unfrozen, too. So, how is he to save the prisoner in the Urbs warehouse if by merely approaching the shooters he will unfreeze their laser beams? On Aurans, Korda needs to cross under a frozen rockslide but how can he, when his passing under a suspended boulder causes it to resume falling? Such puzzles are satisfying because they spring from the story's underlying science fictional conccits, rather than just being inserted into the story out of the designers' obligation to give players some thing to do, Science fiction has always g 0.OCCHICC Con has always been a literature of puzzles: authors posit a set of rules for a hypothetical universe and then ask the question, \"What would things be like in this universe if it were to exist?\" It's a shame more science fiction games don't look to their premises to inspire their puzzles. It is always more interesting to imagine ways into and out of tricky scrapes that emerge from the basic premise of a story than it is to quest after some object simply because a character you meet happens to request it. Not that CHRONOMASTER is entirely free from traditional adventure game filler In one of the game's sillier puzzles, a half dozen jinn ask Korda to bring them \"six dates of lasting,\" which turn out to be fruit emblazoned with crosses (representing Lent) and pieces of Matzoh (representing Passover). There is also a maze; you will feel with Korda when he finds it and says, \"Swell! A maze, Sigh.\" But most of what you find in CHRONOMASTER is puzzle-craft (not to THE VOICE OF GOD If fine puzzles aren't enough to hold your attention, you may be interested to know that CHRONOMASTER also sports fine voice acting. Not by Brent Spiner, who is inclifferent as the vengeful Milo; or Lolita Davidovich, who is awful as the voice of Korda's spaceship, the Jester, nor the various and sundry bit players who clog up the audio track with sorry cockney accents and Sidney Greenstreet impressions; but by honey-throated Ron Perlman, late of IV's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" whose quiet calm and gravelly inflections as Korda will make any listener, male or female, want to roll over and purl. Perlman and the puzzles, plus nifty graphics and Zelazny's cleverness, make up for the game's handful of misdeeds, such as the typos in the Jester's encyclopedia and the fact that, though there is a way to \"quicksave\" your position, there is no way to way to load your quicksave short of quitt ing and restarting the game. CHRONOMASTER hcarkens to an earlier time, when every few months a new classic adventure was minted for your computer. That it is filled with graphic splencor and better-than-average acting is all the more reason to savor it. In whatever pocket universe he's gone to, Zelazny can be proud & steel walkways and fluorescent lights, othcrs are fanciful and resemble the stuff of legend. The first world you visit, Urbos, is spit-polished and militaristic: a giant metal statue of a warrior looms over the greencry in the city park; armored corpses litter a battlefield where a wargame was taking place just bcfore stasis hit; in a nearby warehouse, a bound prisoner stands before a firing squad, Reflections In Amber three shooters' laser beams frozen in midair HRONOMASTER isn't the a split second before first Zelazny story to hit the silicon screen. they would have oblitSome 11 years ago, crated him.

"REVIEW THE DARK EYE DIFFICULTY LEVEL ADVENTURE/RPG L Poe Boy Is Bound to Die Is Inscape's THE DARK Eye Naught But A Dream Within A Dream? by Charles Ardai THE DARK I seems appropriate that after the wonderfully creepy ALONE IN THE DARK, someone should publish an interactive product based on the work of Edgar Allen Poc. And like the HI.P. Lovecraft-inspired games from l-Motion (SHADOW OF THE COMET, PRISONER OF ICE), THE DARK Lye from Inscape does have some merit but only in the way one loves a favorite author's posthumously published last novel, or the masterful but rough first sketches of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel. THE DARK DYE is an ambitious and brave and in some ways successful picce of work, but a little like Poe's characters, it's not all there. Inscape takes three of Poe's stories and wraps them up in a frame story concocted especially for the game. You play a muttonchop-wearing gent of the 1800's who goes to call on his brother, cousin, and clotly, portrait-painting uncle in their drafty old house. Inhaling rather too deeply near Uncle's jar of paint thinner, you find yourself falling into a trance. Then, peering at a reflection of yoursell (in a paper knife, a meat cleaver, the eye of a dead Gish-take your pick), you find yourself hurled through time and space to land in a strange body. Are you a man or a woman? Young or old? That depends on where you saw your reflection, and which Poe tale you're unfortunate enough to have materialized within. WHERE'S MY PACEMAKER? Although the old codger looks to kick the bucket any minute, you have to maneuver him to the bedroom before removing his tell-tale heart. Price: $49.95 System Requirements: IBM: 486 DX-33 or better processor, Windows 3.1 or Win 95, 8 MB RAM, 65,000 color graphics (at 640x480), 2x CD-ROM, 16-bit sound card.

Alternatively, you might land in \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" in which case you can be cither the murderous young narrator or the soup-slurping old man he will chop to bloody pieces before the night is out. The third possibility is to appcar in \"The Cask of Amontillado,\" where the important question is which side of the newly erected brick wall you end up on. In cach of these scenarios, the opportunity to enter the head of the victim as well as the villain offers a novel take on the material, the fact that you eventually end up playing both parts adds considerably to the horror The interface is simple: from a first-person perspective, you point-and-click through a set of linked rooms, using a varicry or painting, grasping, and wave hands as movement and interaction icons. There is no inventory for you to keep track of; if you can pick an object up, you have to use it or put it down before you pick up another. The idea is clearly to have as little as possible stand between you and the cvents and atmosphere of the game. The atmosphere is produced primarily by the graphics, which generally take up the full screen and are rendered in the vibrant, hyper-realistic style that The SEVENTH CUEST and Myst have made de rigeur. Excellent music by Thomas Dolby combines with unnerving sound effects, adding to the nightmarish feel. Instead of using human actors to play the various characters, the game uses sculpted puppels with enormous noscs. Instead of wallpaper, the walls of the house are papered with newsprint. These were risky decisions on the designers' part and they might not POYNTON CLICK One possibility is that you have become the obsessive ligaeus Poynton, narrator of the story \"Berenice.\" Another CG APRIL 1996 "

"REVIEW THE DARK EYE THE ROSWELL UFO CRASH. have worked--but as it turns out, they do. You've never seen a game that looks like this one, and once you see it you won't be able to take your eyes off it. So what's wrong with the game? Practically everything else. A PACKAGE. ADVENTURE/RPG A SERIAL KILLER. A GOVERNMENT COVER-UP. STERIOUS WOMAN. ROUGH CUTS As with too many of the new \"exploration\" adventure games, the environment reeks of emptiness, especially at first. But it's worse here than in most: not only are there too many empty rooms, but you aren't asked to solve puzzles of any sort, not even the lame braintcasers most games use as filler. Making matters worse, there are hallways you see that, for no apparent reason, the computer doesn't let you go down; doors the game doesn't let you open; and characters the game doesn't let you click on Even the few objects you run across -a meat cleaver, a paper knife--the game doesn't let you take. Now, later on you appreciate why the game couldn't let you take the paper knife or the meat cleaver: they have to remain where they are for your trances. But when you first encounter them and click on them to no avail, you just think the designers have lost their minds. Until you snill the paint thinner, there is nothing whatsoever that you can do, but you can spend hours figuring that out. As you wander in mounting frustration, you're also likely to get disoriented due to the game's inconsistent and sloppy design. Usually it takes two moves to turn your character entirely around, but in a few rooms it takes only one. In one hallway, a door is closed when you look at it A MISSING MAN. A TERRIBLE SECRET. Tallinna AND YOU NEED TO SHAVE. The Poorly-Paced Heart IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE... t is tempting to say that Edgar Allan Poe, who was orphaned at two, expelled from West Point at 21, married to his own 13-year-old cousin at 27, and I found dying in a Baltimore qutter at 40, had a life as grotesque and morbidly compelling as any of his characters. But this isn't so. One of the things that makes Poe's writing so extraordinary is that this wreck of a man was able to conjure up characters even more unstable and wretched than himself. Problem is, what works in literature doesn't work the same way in a computer game, because every event must be triggered by something the player does. Readers of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" know the victim gets it while lying awake in bed. But how is one to make the old bugger go to bed? He sits contentedly eating his supper while you walk to every location in the room and try performing every possible action. Will looking at the clock do it? No. Will picking up the saw do it? No. Will eating some soup do it? No. Finally, through trial and error, you try looking out the window. And, lo, the man goes to bed. Problem solved. But now you have to figure out how to trigger each of the subsequent events until the story ends, and what this requires is more random experimentation. Certainly Poe, if he were crafting computer games, would have paced his tale better than this. ACCESS SOFTWARE INCORPORATED Circle Reader Service #246 CG APRIL 1996 "

The horror dredged from HI.R. Ciger's lreudian nightmares was powerful enough material to inspire a comparable action sequel and the popular Dark Horse comic series. So, you'd think that when someone finally produced a game based on all this great work, it would be something to remember. Unfortunately, Mindscape's ALIENS: A COMIC BOOK ADVENTURE, will only be remembered as an example of how NOT lo design an adventure game.

"REVIEW  ABSOLUTE ZERO craft to alien capture operations. ACTION you'll find yourself just another frozen casually ally found a daun fun game that offers some truly innovative twists on an unforLunately stale genre. ABSOLUTE ZERO takes you through 13 scenarios, some consisting of only a single mission and some offering multiple missions. As the game progresses, you learn more and more about the enemy and become more creative in mutating your mining equipment into an offensive lighting force. In ancat twist, you don't move through the struggle as a single protagonist, but as multiple characters. This adels a level of realism to the game, since rarely would a single individual be the cornerstone for an entire campaign. It also allows you to perform in several different capacities and more importantly, gives the game some emotional depth. CRYSTALLINE CRITTERS After each mission is completed, you return to the \"VR Tunnel\" that serves as the main game interface. From here you may catch up on your cast of characters or check in with the latest Europa News Network broadcasts. You can also check out the latest intelligence on alien technology or outfit you craft for the next skirmish. At one point you read about the terrible nightmares the colony children are having, presumably because of the stress of the invasion. Soon, it becomes apparent that the aliens are in some way psychically responsible for these night terrors. The aliens, a form of crystalline life, are very creepy creatures, attacking with a hive-like mentality. Each mission tcaches you more about them, and that's part of the payoff. IN UTGITT MITRU WATANABE GUERRERO ICY COMBAT The missions are carefully thought-out and wonderfully balanced, although occasionally overscripted. For example, you might hear a compatriot yell, \"Where the hell are you?\" when you're right next to their ship. You also have no control over your wingmen. In fact, sticking close to them is sometimes the only way to mudalle your way through a mission. But the intensity level becomes quite dramatic in the heat of battle. In fact, I've never seen a game that offers such chaotic and massive furballs. At times I found myself battling a dozen ground forces with another two dozen ships circling above. Unfortunately, this chaos immediately exposes an interface law: there is no \"target nearest enemy\" feature. This means that if you have a standard joystick you must cycle through all targets, in a seemingly random order, to lock onto your target of choice. Fortunately, if you have a Thrustmaster of Flightstick Pro you can target the alien in your crosshairs with a flick of the thumb. In several instances, you have the opportunity to play the same scene in different roles. You may be a turret gunner on the ground and then take to the ether as a Dragonfly pilot providing air support in the same mission. You also fly different crafts as well, from the Dragonfly, your generic starfighter, to the licfly Maglock (picture a low gravity tug-boat) to the speedy and out of control Valkyric, a sort of super speeder bike. Each slip offers up a completely differ ent flying experience. The Dragonfly is powerful and graceful while the Maglock is clumsy and requires the use of an additional set of left/right thrusters to mancuver properly. Figuring out the best way to handle each of the crafts is part of the fun. Learning how to fly defensively is invaluable in ABSOLUTE ZERO; the Shards and Web Fliers attack in huge numbers, and are not afraid of ramming you.

ABSOLUTE HERO ABSOLUTE ZERO is a fresh game, offering a nice new setting (Europa) and a new way to play the tried and truc spacc opera plot of \"aliens attack humans.\" But the designers should be ashamed of themselves for an absolutely atrocious first chapter. Common sense dictates that the opening sequences of a game (or book or movie for that matter) are crucial; if gamers don't have an initial positive experience, they may never go back. Hopefully (for Domark), gamers will bear with ABSOLUTE ZERO's more than average «game-patience requirement.

"TERRY COLEMAN CLASSICS & PUZZLES Make The Connection on James Burke Weaves A Winning Web In Discovery Channel's CONNECTIONS The ames Burke is one of those multi-talented people with so much energy that you'd hardly be surprised if he ignored middle age and entered the Olympic Marathon. Of course, if Burke did actually go to Atlanta, he'd find time between heats to discuss how the devastation of the city in the Civil War somehow relates to current advances in bio-technology, or why nobody has Georgia peaches with their vanilla ice cream anymore. You see, James Burke's great talent is finding connections between things that, to you and me, scem hopelessly unrelated. One of the most enduring documentary TV shows of the past two decades was Burke's Connections, which blended historical fact with clever characterizations of famous artists, inventors and statesmen, all tied together with Burke's irrepressible enthusiasm and unique take on the scientific method.

Each league has licensing reps or teams who meticulously cxamine every licensee applicant, and they're surprisingly in the know when it comes to computer and video games. «Most of them licensing reps), with the exception of Major League Baseball, are fairly savvy and ready for new technologies,\" says Doug Whatley of Overtime Sports, which is currently working on ABC MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL Why the big league concern? Because major leaguc tcams and athletes are wellknown properties, who, like any actor or actress, make a living off their names. The unauthorized use of their names for profit concerns them, as does a crummy prodlict with their logos all over it. \"The NBA is picky in the cxtreme about whom they grant licenses, as is the NFLthey both have established products with huge fan bases already: 'The NHL on the other hand, a league still trying to build popularity, is fairly open to NHL-licensed products. And from the sound of things, Major League Baseball has no consistent ideology, as usual. If Dodger Stadium doesn't include L.A. smog and Dodger Dogs, we're pissed. WAIT YER TURN! I've always taken licenses for granted. Obviously someone was paying somebody for the rights to all these real players, ON DECK Fans of Epyx' classic SUMMER GAMES series, rejoice! BRUCE JENNER'S WORLD CLASS DECATHLON, by Interactive Magic, will put you back on the track just in time for the Summer Olympics, with 3D graphics. Fans fearful for their keyboard and joystick need not worry: DECATHLON will use a less strenuous golf-like interface... As mentioned above, Overtime Sports, an ABC/Spectrum HoloByte subsidiary, has two football games in the works for the fall: Monday Night Football and ABC College Football. Both will incorporate real life announcers. This means Al Michaels, Dan Dierdorf and Frank Gifford calling the shots in the pro game, and better yet, Keith Jackson (\"Fummmble-and the Aggies have the football\") in the college game...

But they're not completely single-sided. \"We view licensors as strategic partners,\" says Debbie Pinkston, Marketing Director at Accolade (HARDBALL. 5. UNNECESSARY ROUCHINESS 96) \"we want the real players and they want the exposure.\" The bottom line, of course, is money. Royalties are koy, in negotiating a deal with Accolade, the NFL will base their requested royalty percentage based on how big the company is and how big a product release is planned The totals quickly add up. \"The NFL enters negotiations assuming you're going to pay 10 percent to them and the NFLPA (Player's Association) in total,\" Whatley states. While this is at the high end of the royally spectrum (5-10 percent is the usual range), even five percent of the profits from every sale is a lot, especially considering today's million-dollar productions and $50 price tags. After negotiations have finished and an agreement has been finalized, both parties tend to work off of a formal/informal agreement while the deal is finalized, according to Pinkston. \"Finalizing the deal can take forevcr, so once we get a working agreement done, both parties will work off of a letter of intent,\" she says. THE GOOD OLD DAYS Realizing how potentially valuable licensces can be to their product, major league teams have really gotten it together in order to make the process as painless as possible. Take players like Jerry Rice for example, who don't belong to the NFLIA. In the past, a company would have had to approach Rice's agent and negotiate a separate contract with him if they wanted him in the game. But now, the NFLPA takes charge of these instances and has already signed special agreements with such players. Furthermore, organizations like NFL Players Inc. will sign up ex-players for licensees, ensuring that the old guard gets their duc, and making life considerably casier for game companics. For their college football game, Whatley was able to go straight to the CIA (Collegiate Football Association) and procure a contract for every team (using college players' names is illegal due to their amateur status). Mail order through: PC ZONE DAMARK MICROWAREHOUSE CREATIVE COMPUTERS DEMON DESTROYER GUNNT IS LARGER THAN SHOWN IT'S IN THERE Of course, all of this talk about business deals and negotiations have me longing to play a different kind of game. I'd love to see an NBA lycoon kind of game. Wouldn't it be great to run your own team from the business side of things, worrying about salary caps, player strikes and, of course, licensing deals.

I saveda bit by going mid-grade in some areas, but for most categories, such as spare parts and fuel, it was nothing but the best. As my advisors said, why blow a race on a shoddy bolt?

Why the heck didn't my mechanics pick up on that before the race? This illustrates onc of the basic design llaws with GRAND PRIX MANAGER. Though it offers a management perspec tive, it requires too much hands-on and not enough management. You liave to hire competent people, and then do it yourself. For example, it is up to you to personally inspect every single piece of equipment and make every single financial decision every step of the way. From checking out your car before every race to making sure your primary sponsor is happy with your efforts on their behall, it's all you. Make the wrong decision too many times in a row and write your career off. Period. This high level of involvement occasionally makes the game more tedious than it should be. It would have been nice if CPM's different difficulty levels allowed you to delegate authority. For example, a sponsorship coordinator could take care of selling those overpriced car decals for you, and a head mechanic could ensure that your car was race ready. This way, CHECKERED FLAG GRAND PRIX MANAGER runs flawlessly in Windows 3.1, although constant «AltTabbing\" can cause lock-ups. Audio consists mostly of generic yet realistic car and track sounds that have nothing to do with where the cars are on the track. Sadly, radio transmissions are seen, not heard. Graphically, the entire race is run from the blimp view with occasional generic 3D flic sequences to indicate that your driver has entered the pits. Since televised racing coverage depends so heavily on different views only the most tunnelvisioned race fan will be satisfied with the ants crawling around the track. Liven the pay-off for winning lacks clan. l'or example, when I did scrape together a superstellar, one-two Team Carnage finish, the newspaper headlines unceremoniously read «Schumacher Unlucky,\" with no attention paid to my team's stellar performance.

Yet, much to my surprise, GRAND PRIX MANAGER is where I'm going these days for my racing fix, despite sometimes being told that a driver's fastest lap was his first one-au impossibility. This comprehensive racing game is fresh and bold. Too bad it isn't enough of a complete package to interest more than dichards like me. APPEAL: Anyone with a passing interest in racing (or a severe lack of coordination), or fans of sports management should enjoy GRAND PRIX MANAGER. If you're looking for behindthe-wheel action, you won't find it here. PROS: Allows you to take control of a Formula 1 team from start to finish, designing cars, selling sponsorships and directing raceday strategy. CONS: Makes you oversee every detail of your racing team at all times; inadequate manual; and antsize blimp-view depictions of race. RATED CC APRIL 1996 "

There's nice detail in the combat system as well. Some buildings have their own toolbars, and the functions of the command center, in particular, are unique; this is the first time I've seen a game trying to include a viable model of intelligence and counter-intelligence operations. Units can be grouped and given commands as a whole-and not only that, but they can be ordered to move in any of seven formations to concentrate fire and protect themselves as they advance. The barracks can produce officers, which can give attack and defense bonuses to any group they lead. There is even a field promotion function which rewards the number of kills a unit makes; after five kills, for example, a light infantryman achieves \"veteran\" status, THIS MEANS WAR! (TMW), and fans of strategic and tactical games would love it, except for one thing it doesn't work. The technical presentation and performance of this game are just awful. Although it has the benefit of running from the Windows 95 operating platform, its system demands are fairly outrageous. On my 486, with 8 MB of RAM, a dual speed CD-ROM and a 4-MB graphic card, Tius MEANS WAR! ran like molasses. At the game's maximum speed, units crawled across the screen at an agonizing snail's pace, and scrolling across the screen was jerky, slow and graceless. Coordinating strikes and diversions was a problem, because I had no idea how long it would take to cross terrain. Worse, this title will crasl your system, repeatedly. There is simply no explanation for 'T'MW's poor technical performance other than slapdash programming, Ina game where so much clever conceptual work has been done, this kind of bad craftsmanship is doubly unfortunate; it's the farms, mills and mines it takes to keep things running, and also a great many production facilities, including barracks, factories, research stations and oil wells.

BM's foray into the wargaming industry sounds like a bad beer commercial. \"Are you about to invade Russia for the forty-fifth timc? STOP! Try the new fastpaced strategy game that's sweeping the nation: POWER: THE GAME, from IBM. It's a quick and easy way to kick some butt, either against the computer or your favorite victim. If you want to invade Normandy, you'll have to fly there, but for lite, fast fum, this is the place.\" Power falls somewhere between checkers and Axis and Allies. There are nine fairly simple units, and the same game board is always used. There are always four players (human or Al) who start in the corners of the board with identical sets of pieces. The object of the game is to collect power points by invading other players' territory and overpowering their stacks with your stronger ones. The game is positioned as part of a series of Internet games by IBM. The head-to-hcad options offered are good, and include built-in Internet IP address support. Simple, effective rules make learning the game easy. Unlike most Wargames, when one stack beats another. it captures it, instead of destroying it. Power begets power and, together with timed rounds (which last up to two mintites), this game moves fast. It is hard to imaginc a game lasting longer than forty minutes or so. Meanwhile, Al players have the luxury of spreading their forces thin, getting extra power points and making moves against smaller stacks. Their overall power increases quickly. Upshot: good fortune in the first ten turns will make or break the game. If you can't swing a major caplure quickly, the Al will probably run away with the lead. Actually, in solo play, you can win the game about half the time consistently. even at the toughest setting. With such an otherwise weak Al, this game would be too casy to bcat if it weren't for the fact that the computer cheats. games. Likewise, the game has a variety of multiplayer options, yet it can't be played by hotseat (only one of the four positions can be human). It could have been quick fun for gamers young and ok within a household, being such a fast, straightforwar game. POWER is certainly no ALLIED GENERAL, and it lacks the needed depth to occupy true wargamers. But as a quick and dirty game to divert your strategic attentions for an hour or so, POWER provides a good diversion.

There is only one fixed map (although you can change the wallpaper behind it).

Occasionally the graphics will matic negotiations not refresh when switching between screens, so that last screen you viewed remains as the background to the presently active screen. This is somewhat annoying, but does not affect game play. On the other hand, the interface has a tendency to skip ahead of the player when presenting sequential information. For instance, when you colonize a planet, you are given the option of beginning construction on that planet's first improvement, as well as its first space slip. Frequently, however, before you can make a selection, the computer moves on to other planets in your possession which have finished their own projects and need new orders. The computer never returns to the newly-colonized planet, and unless you remember to select it from the planet menu, it will never begin building anything. When you lave dozens of planets in development and are colonizing worlds as quickly as possible, it is quite possible to lose track of a particular colony and only discover 20 game-years later that it has been lying fallow while the alien hoards approached.

While Governor, you must build the provincial capital, suppress linruly tribes, crush barbarians, and deal swiftly with domestic unrest and other calamities. On top of everything, the Emperor stands as a shadow over all your works, with his Imperial hand out, raiding your coffers in the name of taxes. For those seeking a more firm foundation in this absorbing game of ancient SimCry building, we would like to offer If you're producing more resources than your city businesses can convert, build an extra warehouse on the Provincial Level to store the excess. Eventually, the emperor or a new business you build will soak up the excess material. FIt Upon a   45,  1FID Tax Coverage a workers. An initial workforce of 100 to 200 plebes should get things rolling smoothly. so set their initial payroll at approximately 25 to 30 denarii. In a month or two, after your city is laid out as far as your budget will go, you can always scale back on these government employees a little Second, pick the side of the river with the smaller amount of land it will be easier to defend, and barbarian entry is more likely to pop up on the more landed side of the river), and start by laying out a \"business district\" in your capital. Find a corner away from the river, wall it in, and start by industrializing there. The above corner of your city creates a solid initial business district where the least harm comes to property values. Third, closer to the river, you want to build your high-value housing area with the goal of building large palaces. Since these are 3x3 buildings (they can each house 500 people so you don't need a lot of them to have a big city) a good starting point is a 6x6 square of housing surrounded with all the fixings. If space is a problem, a 3x6, 4x6 or 5x6 area will work pretty well, too. If you're lucky, a 6x6 arca can eventually have up to four palaces and house 2,000 people. One or two of these should be all you need to rake in the bucks and reach the next promotion. You also want your housing area to have complete hospital and library coverage, as well as being walled off. PROVINCIAL PUNDITRY Build at least one industry and either a trading post or port carly in the game. This will supply goods for various businesses in your city. Always remember the ratio: one fully manned industry (30 plebes) can support up to three like businesses in town. Note that a busy trading post or a port with a shipyard will do about as well. Always connect all your industries by road to your capital. Don't block off these roads with gates for any prolonged period of time (trade is effectively cut off along any gated roads). For defense, you don't need to forma cohort right away when starting a province. One tactic is to let the enemy come to your city and then steer them to the side of the river you're not on. Once there, they can only look longingly across the river at your city until they eventually get bored and leave. To exercise this tactic, have all the provincial roads enter your city from its uninhabited side. Building provincial walls in strategic places to divert barbarians also works (you might have to build a small cohort somewhere before you can do this). If trouble does enter your side of the river, build towers in their path to slow and kill them.

"STRATEGY  CAESAR II        Geography TERMOMETER STRATEGY / WARGAMES RED Go to Forum build a big cohort. You want at least 100 more troops than any barbarian tribe you've seen, so a 600 to 1200 man army is a good size. Place this killer cohort near your capital, since this is the destination of most chemics, If you can afford it, and are besieged with barbarians from several different places, build a second cohort near where the barbarians frequent. If they're giving you trouble, don't hesitate to go in a wipe them out. A weak tribe produces amies of 70+ troops and is defended by 150. A local tribe produces armies of 200+ troops and defends itself with 300. A strong tribe produces armies of 300+ troops and defends itself with 450. Finally, a powerful tribe produces armies of 400+ troops and defends itself with 600. To Octavian \"I Did you welcome to your new province.

Right Click to remove this message! CHARITY CASE When Caesar comes asking for tribute, you can wait a year or two before you tithe him, but make sure you eventually do pay. Also, if you must bribe him, do so only as a last resort. SENSE AND CENTURIONS What troops to use is up to you. Heavy infantry cost about five denarii per month for anywhere from 55-100 troops. They train at a rate of 20 per month (the slowcst), but are excellent one-on-onc fighters. Ple Olions Spectra H I N C July 5HODN Geography needed again. When it comes to the battles themselves, avoid any that you don't think you can easily win. If you have no slingers, or if your opponent has many bowmen, your best bet for minimizing losses is to let the computer fight for you. If you have some slingers, however, you should probably do your own fighting. A good strategy is using your slingers to whittle down advancing barbarians while the infantry forms a defensive turtle position. Once the enemy is demoralized by your slingers, your other troops can mop them up fairly quickly. Forums USERS KIPI scription rate to about 30 percent for a year without any serious long-term effects. Otherwise, the maximum sustainable conscription rate is between 12-19 percent, depending on the province. Conscription beyond five percent, though, will start making the citizens unhappy, while a rate below that will keep them content. For this reason, when founding a new province, it's a good idea to keep the conscription rate at zero for as long as possible. Slingers are obtained from pressing plebes into the army. Since they train at the speedy rate of 80 per month, in an emergency you can simply shut down your labor forces and build your legions very quickly. You can also recruit masses of new plebes by simply throwing money at them, so getting a large group of slingers up in a relatively short period of time is relatively easy. The final troop type are auxiliaries. The quality of auxiliaries varies depending on the type. Each province has a limited number of themso once they die, they're gone forever (use them wisely). They cost a lot at 20 denarii per month for 50 troops, but they all train in one monthi, no matter how many you order. After you use them you can disband them until they're THE TAXMAN COMETH The ideal tax rate varies from province to province, and also depends on what is WALLUS MAXIMUS Wall off your residential district as soon as possible, or the property value will never rise above the low 40s. TIPS! Light infantry train at a rate of 40 per month, and are mustered from conscripting citizens. While this technically makes them \"free,\" the higher your conscription rate is, the more unrest you'll have in your capital city. Unrest lowers the population tax you can levy on your citizens, and decreases your income substantially. A crisis, though, will unite your capital's citizenry. This allows you to boost your conThe amount of population taxes you take in from a particular building is proportional to the land value times the number of residents living in the building (LV X POP=TAXES). Large palaces should thus be your main residential goal. Their land value of 62, times their population density of 500, amounts to an enormous 31,000 denarii in taxes. CG APRIL 1996 "

It's the most important factor in building Rome to its greatest potential. If you don't have it, get it, because you will certainly need it. Emperor Caligula, who squandered the vast treasury surplus left him by his stingy uncle Tiberius, imposed extraordinary taxes to raise money (taxing law suits, panderers and prostitutes, among others). While you can't be so brazen, clever play will keep your coffers full and the wagons and charlots of local commerce running at full speed. Plebes Please Alas groups selected SELF PROMOTION: \"I SMELL RANK\" Once your city is flourishing and your military is unstoppable, only then is it time to think about lining your own pockets and getting a promotion. Your promotion is dependent on four different ratings that the oracle gives you. Th : empire, peace, prosperity Don't keep too much of a cash surplus until you are ready to move on, because Caesar will come to collect taxes if your coffers are bursting. As a rule of thumb, if you have less than 3000 denarii, Caesar knows you're broke and never takes any. If you have more than 8000, he'll start hitting you with maximum tax rate of about 35 here's an order of importance for Plebeians, and the top priority for labor goes under the job descriptions of fire and water. Having a slight excess here of 5-10 plebes is a good investment; more than that is wasteful. Here are some numbers to keep in mind: 1 plebe per 8 squares of buildings for fire protection 1 plebe per 8 road squares 2 plebes per fountain or bath (wells and reservoirs require no plebes) >1 plebe per 8 regular wall squares to \"man\" them (towers require no plebes and produce soldiers when barbarians appear) > 10 plebes can produce 1 unit of goods per month in the provinces-these 10 plebes will keep a single related business going at full capacity Each provincial industry can handle up to 30 plebes for industry, so that three businesses can be stocked when running at full capacity. building more amenities or religious, entertainment, educational and sanitation buildings. The amount of improvement in your culture rating roughly parallels what you pay for. If you're scrimping, gardens are the most cost-effective improvement you can make. Circuses, libraries, basilicas, arenas and hospitals are the quickest way to improve your rating on a cost-perbuilding basis. Once you're offered that next promotion, check your personal funds. If you don't have enough cash to start your next province off right, boost the amount of money you make per month (as much as the city can afford to pay you) and wait l  r. percent! CG APRIL 1996 "

"HALL OF FAME elcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. INDUCTION CEREMONY FORI MICROPROSE DOOM ID SOFTWARE 1993 t took all of five seconds to boot up Doom, take two steps forward with the new American Hero and realize, \"Holy Cow, this is something new.\" At that moment, we knew we'd found The Next Big Thing. People who had never before played, or even heard of computer games, were asking \"What's this Doomed thing?\" Game developers every where scrambled to develop \"Better than Doom!\" titles. But no one could match the gritty, visceral feel of blasting howling Imps into a bloody pulp with the Rocket Launcher, or the pleasure of stalking an unsuspecting Deathmatch opponent (or two) with a shotgun. The story behind Doom is simply that the guys at id Software wanted to make a game for themselves to play-with and against each other. And it shows: the first month it was rated. Doom leapt to the top of the CGW Top 100 Poll (April, 1994), it has remained in the Top 10 action games category ever since. Part of the game's rapid rise to popularity can be attributed to its unconventional distribution. id broke with tradition by releasing the entire first episode of Doom as shareware. Furthermore, Doom fired the shot heard around the world in the network gaming revolution (action games in particular); being able to play at work over a network drove worker productivity down and MIS eyebrows up. Veteran gamers may recall that Doom's seeds were laid a few years earlier in CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN 3D, one of the first first-person 3-D environment games around. But to a whole new generation of computer gamers, Doom is it. MASTER OF ORION MICROPROSE 1993 t first glance, this game from an unknown company in Texas seemed like just another space game. After all, the recipe for MASTER OF ORION is hardly original: a mix of humans and weird alien starfaring races; lots of combat, trade and diplomacy: quickly. changing technology to help conquer a cold, uncaring universe. It didn't help that the first release (like so many from MicroProse in recent years) required a patch, or that Steve Barcia's design lacked both high-res graphics and an intuitive interface. But Simtex' brain child eventually became one of the most admired strategy games in many years. MOO, as it was affectionately dubbed, had an edge over the competition in that the aliens-Darlok spies, intelligent and diffident Psilons, Silicoids who could survive in utter wastelands, et al-were quirky and interesting, requiring radically different playing styles. MOO also featured a remarkable diplomatic Al which, even though copied in several designs since, has yet to be surpassed. The combination of technological advances, the mysteries of galactic exploration and the tactics of space and planetary combat surpass even SSG's REACH FOR THE STARS. And the intricacies of spaceship design alone could keep you busy until the next generation of aliens hatch from Antares.

"MARTIN CIRULIS What's the Dehatot, With... Dumb Ad Now, regardless of my views on censorship and Congressmen, found the idea that the public was going to have to suffer from another round of this truly awful game far ith all due apologies to the one true God of Late Night, thought might borrow one of his shticks to focus a baleful eye on some of the idiocy that passes as advertising in our industry. First off, I'd like to pop into the Ridiculous Claims Department and challenge the odd blurb I've seen lately. From the OUTPOST FOR WIN 95 ad of a few months back we have the proclamation: \"THE MOST POPULAR SPACE STRATEGY GAME EVER...!\" Um, excuse me Sierra: though I have enjoyed many of your games, somebody needs a slap for OK'ing this one. OUTPOST is not the most popular strategy game ever, unless you think the number of returned boxes and refund demands are a sign of popularity. And just lately, Origin stepped on its own toes by using a quote proclaiming that CYBERMAGE is better than their very own SYSTEM SHOCK. Sorry boys, but this one is only true if you think SVGA is the only important part of a game. And a little reality check for Microsoft-no matter how many pages you use for an ad, FURY3 is still a weak game. The winner in the \"Thing I am getting real tired of seeing\" category: blood! Especially on live models. I realize that severed limbs and torn spines are all the rage with our psy. che-blasted youth these days, but let's give it a rest, eh? Gore on the ad copy won't make EXPECT NO Mercy from Microforum any less of a tedious MORTAL KOMBAT clone. And maybe WIPEOUT might sell if there were a single picture of the damn game on the ad, instead of Brother & Sister BrainDead bleeding all over themselves. And just because you dress up a brutal concept doesn't make it any more appealing, as you can see in the new artsy, Gothic/Nihilist ads id and MORTAL KOMBAT 3 are using. Guess what, folks: even a game as gory as Doom is theoretically about living, or at least survival. I was under the delusion that I was blow. ing away demons because they wanted to kill me and ravage my world-silly me! Now I understand it all, thanks to your Goth-freakazoid ad people, who have carefully explained in the most pretentious terms that my gameplay is simply another act of Death Worship. Of course, how can I mention depraved violence.worship without a few words about the ad I loathe the most. It's the two page spread using the stars'n'bars and personal freedom to push the \"Director's Cut\" of the repulsive NIGHT TRAP. ( I realize that severed limbs and torn spines are all the rage these days, but let's give it a rest, leh? ity. Gosh, guys, thanks for pointing that out. I guess it's unpatriotic if I don't rush out and get your game so I can watch a few teen girls get slaughtered while I go through the motions of saving them. For the sake of my own and my fellow gamer's peace of mind, let me suggest three simple rules for computer game ads. Martin's Laws of Advertising 1) No more body parts or excessive, juvenile gore. Keep that stuff for the Nintendo mags where the readers are hyperkinetic enough to let primary colors like red distract them from the fact they are getting excited over another version of the same game they already own. 2) No more cheesecake shots of women unless they are actually in the bloody game. 3) If you do not have a screenshot or even an art background from your game yet to put in the ad, you probably shouldn't be trying to make an ad in the first place. There, that wasn't so bad, was it? So please, ad-kids, before we are so embarrased by our hobby that we order games in brown wrappers... can't you just clean up your act? worse. Other than serving as an early warning of everything that was bad about multimedia, NIGHT TRAP served little purpose other than pro. viding a way to shock your parents; but now Digital Pictures informs us that you'd have to be a bi-focal wearing suit not to get a kick out of this little piece of deprav Computer Gaming World (ISSN 0744-6667) is published monthly by Zift-Davis Publishing Co., One Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016.
