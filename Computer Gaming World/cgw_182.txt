It all started back in April when nine of us, each armed with a manila folder full of player rosters, fantasy league advice, and simulated drafts, locked ourselves into our conference room to conduct our player draft. The rest of the staff left us alone thinking we were in \"a very serious meeting.\" Our addiction got progressively more out of control as time went on. The low (or high, depending on your point of view) point? I found myself, not playing, but watching a game between editors Tom Price and Rob Coffey. At least I wasn't alone in my dorkinessfive other editors were right there watching with me. In a day and age where Internet and LAN play are flourishing, it's odd that the most enjoyable multiplayer experience we've had this year is taking place not over a network, but at a single computer.

THE BOSSES Vice President Dale Strang Director of Business Cathy Bendoff ing-it's far more fun to play an opponent who's in the same room with you. To taunt mercilessly when you're ahead, and, in the sad case of Technical Editor Dave Salvator, to weep bitter tears and break game pads when you lose on a two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth. With a crowd watching, no less. But this sad case does beg a simple question. When are we going to get this kind of socially immersive experience over the Net? Is it even possible? Can you create an online game environment that successfully straddles the social elements of play without devolving into a chat room? These are the kinds of questions that will hopefully be answered over the next few years.

"THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Edited by jeff_green@zd.com Malice in Wonderland American McGee Teams With EA For... An Alice In Wonderland 3D Shooter? ave you heard the RE A D.ME rumors about American McGee and Electronic Arts? Recently, an EAhosted Web site created a flood of gossip on the Internet regarding the possible game offspring of such a union. The site (www.american.ea.com) which featured bizarre sketch art, creepy children's music, and a mysterious jack-in-thebox-appeared to be paving the way for some kind of announcement regarding the top-secret game McGee is rumored to be working on. After checking out the site, the crack team of reporters at CGW got to the bottom of the mystery. By applying skills we've cultivated over the years (begging, pleading, sending small dead rodents in the mail, and impersonating janitors), the vaunted editorial engine at CGW broke through Electronic Arts' cone of silence and finally got the company talking about their highly guarded project involving American McGee. What we discovered is tantalizing. McGee-one of the top level designers at id Software for years-is working on a twisted 3D shooter adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. Currently titled AMERICAN MCGEE'S ALICE and scheduled for release late next year, ALICE is going to take the Disneyfied version of Lewis Carroll's story and turn it upside down with a darker, edgier, Tim Burton-esque approach. The game's storyline will be based on the classic tale, meaning you'll probably encounter the likes of the Jabberwocky, the Tweedle twins, the Mad Hatter, and many of the other characters from the book. (How you will play with them exactly has yet to be revealed). Given McGee's shooter background, we're sure the game will emphasize action. We do know that the game will be played in the third-person perspective, with the possibility of a first-person perspective multiplayer mode. Regarding the 3D game engine, all we could squeeze out of EA is that the game will be utilizing an \"advanced, next-generation 3D engine.\" Look for more coverage of ALICE in upcoming issues of CGW. S3 to Acquire Diamond New Graphics Landscape Leaves nVidia as 'Last Man Standing' f you can't stand the heat, go out and buy another company. That would seem to be the message being sent by the graphics hardware industry. In yet another consolidation move, graphics chipconsolidation move, graphics chinmaker S3 is acquiring Diamond Multimedia in a stock-swap deal val ued at about $173 million. The deal is a marriage of two troubled companies both trying to return to profitability, and it opens up more questions than it answers. The move now leaves one major chipmaker (nVidia), and one large board maker (Creative Labs) as the only two players without a dance partner at the 1999 Graphics Hoe-Down. The Savage has been successful both with board and system makers. With this new Diamond deal, S3 will be able to diversify their businesses, including sound cards, modems, and perhaps most interestingly, motherboards. Last year, Diamond acquired motherboard maker Micronics, and has been marketing motherboards under the Diamond name. S3 has been working on a graphics chip that will integrate into a motherboard's \"North bridge\" (the interface between the CPU and the memo ry), and will now be able to market that motherboard for low-cost PCs. But given that Diamond has been losing money despite its diverse product line-up, it's not at all clear that S3 will succeed in making money where Diamond has failed. So what does this bode for we gamers? Expect to see Diamond boards use only S3 parts in the near future, since nVidia has stated that it will no longer have dealings with Diamond because $3 is a direct competitor. Creative Labs, who has been shipping a Savage4based board, is likely to become the preeminent board supplier of nVidia-based boards here in the U.S., though Hercules and Guillemot will give chase as well, both here and in Europe. -Dave Salvator www.computergaming.com "

Game characters and items selling for hundreds or thousands of dollars? Star programmers being lured away from high-profile game companies? With the remarkable success of massively multiplayer games like Origin's ULTIMA ONLINE and Verant's EVERQUEST, we may be witnessing a sea-change in the gaming world. Both ULTIMA ONLINE and EVERQUEST have gained huge followings, Thanks To ULTIMA ONLINE And EVERQUEST, The Online Revolution is Now 15 Years Ago: October 1984 Proving that the CGW editors have always had an uncanny sense of humor, the October 1984 issue featured a joke ministory, \"Four Articles We Will Never Print in CGW.\" Among the funniest of these ribtickling non-stories: \"Interfacing the Original PCjr Keyboard to Your IBM PC, \"The TI-99A Success DIVPUTER Story,\" and \"A Cray Emulator for Your C-64.\" Sorry, Jeff-your column idea for next month has already been done. @da..

At nearly $10 per month per account, these games are generating a lot of Brittania gold and Norrathian platinum for their parent companies, Electronic Arts and Sony. Soon they will be competing with another heavy hitter, ASHERON'S CALL, which is being backed by Microsoft. Other companies already fielding games include Simutronics, with the text-based GEMSTONE and DRAGONREALMS; TEN, with DARK SUN ONLINE; Mplayer, with UNDERLIGHT, and 3DO with MERIDIAN 59. And the mainstream media is noticing. Time ran a one-page story about EVERQUEST in their June 21st issue. \"EVERQUEST thrives on the relationships that develop among players,\" wrote Michael Krantz. \"Players attend concerts, auctions and weddings, bicker over everything from wolf meat to scimitars; and pool talents and resources to quest for distant treasures.\" That's not a bad summary of the action. With national publications jumping on the bandwagon, can it be too long before politicians proclaim they're \"proud to be a compassionate conservative and a 12th level rogue?\" 10 Years Ago: October 1989 If our April 1999 cover shocked you, the October 1989 cover is living proof that the CGW editors have always been cleavage-obsessed pervs. One of the feature reviews that month was STAR SAGA II, an \"interactive novel played through a stack of 14 booklets containing over 50,000 COMPUTER paragraphs GAMING WORLD of excellent fic PROADS WORDS BEASTS tion\" and AND... no graphics save a glossy, colored map. Woo-hoo! The wages of ULTIMA sin are cold, hard cash. In late June Origin issued a press release saying that one of their ULTIMA ONLINE Game Masters (GMs) had been fired for engaging in activities that breached the trust that must exist between a company, its employees, and its customers.\" One of the many ULTIMA fan sites Dr. Twister's, then broke the story that the terminated employee was GM Darwin, whose real name is Kevin Roseler, and that he had been fired for creating ULTIMA ONLINE gold and houses and selling them through eBay. A quick check of eBay records shows that Roseler sold nearly $8,000 worth of ULTIMA items. This included over 19 million gold pieces, two castles, and several houses. Origin declined to discuss specifics or even name Roseler as the former GM who was terminated. When contacted, Roseler's wife admitted that he had indeed sold the ULTIMA items and that he had used his powers as a GM to create them. All Roseler would say is that he had, \"made a mistake.\" Roseler did post a farewell message to the ULTIMA Community in which he said, \"I am no longer employed with Origin Systems and thus this ends my time in UO. I hold no ill will toward Origin Systems as my leaving was my fault.\" -Mark Asher 5 Years Ago: October 1994 \"From low-res headsets to new controls and immersive audio products,\" we gushed back in 1994, \"we're getting closer to home Virtual Reality than ever before!\" Um, right.

Recently Brian Hook, one of id Software's star programmers and a huge EVERQUEST fan, left id to work for Verant. \"Verant is the perfect place for me,\" he said. \"I'm a huge fan of their games. I'm excited to be able to contribute to a product line that will be the benchmark against which all other massive multiplayer games are judged.\" Just what is the appeal of these games? Origin's Richard Garriott (Lord British to you) had this to say: \"In a solo player game, every feature is seen by each player as created for them to experience uniquely, each and every player gets to be the one person who \"wins,\" who achieves the objectives laid out by the game. But you do so alone. Who hasn't wanted to share the adventure with a friend?\" EVERQUEST's Brad McQuaid put it more simply: \"The main appeal of these games is that we are really heading towards a virtual world.

The online-only WWII flight simulation promised a large, multiplayer air combat environment in which pilots re-enacted historical air battles. The game was released to beta testers last fall and had so far met with an enthusiastic reaction. A public beta release was rumored to be imminent. This is the second flight sim Eidos has cancelled in the last two years. The company stopped production on FLYING NIGHTMARES 2 early last year and transferred the entire team to CK. (An earlier CONFIRMED KILL, begun in 1994 and appearing on CGW's May 1995 cover, went on to become ICI's WARBIRDS.) Rumor has it that the project is being shopped to other publishers and may yet live to fight another day. We wish it well, but don't hold much hope considering the recent cooling trend in the sims market, and the fact that the game may be a long flight away from delivering on its full payload.

Name, title, games you've worked on, and any PIN numbers you'd like to share. Will Wright, purveyor of fine home care products (and part-time game designer). RAID ON BUNGELING BAY, SIMCITY, SIMEARTH, SIMANT, SIMCITY 2000, SIMCOPTER. 6723, 1132, 3339. 2. What are some rejected concepts for sim games?

What's this about a red electric scooter you ride around on in the office? One day in a fit of corporate genius I decided to form the 1st Mechanized Management Brigade. This basically involves weaving between cubicles at high speed on my electric scooter. So far the death toll remains at zero. 4. Tell me about Robot Wars. This is something I've been doing with my daughter since around '94. We build small (25-50 lb.) remote control robots, and then attempt to beat the hell out of other robots. It's sort of a high-tech cock fight. What's really interesting about it is the other people you meet and compete with) who are also attracted to such weirdness. I'd say the contestants are about one-third software people, one-third movie special effects people, and about one-third survivalist sorts from places like Montana and Texas. 5. THE SIMS is the new game you're working on. I have enough trouble with my real family. Why do I need a virtual one? Maybe you'll have better luck with the virtual family? What I like about THE SIMS is that after playing it for a while you realize how much of your actual life is a real-time strategy game. We have hypothetical tools (such as spreadsheets) for our businesses-why not a tool for experimenting with various lifestyles? Tchotchke of the Month Revenge of the Faeries (continued) Tchotchoke (choch'ke): slang, from Yiddish: a cheap, showy trinket -American Heritage College Dictionary, Third Edition Just how big can the massively multiplayer market get? \"We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg now,\" said McQuaid. \"The potential is in all genres, not just role-playing games. Indeed, by the time you read this, Verant will have announced their next game, a massively multiplayer real-time strategy game set in the near future, tentatively titled SOVEREIGN. Verant is also working on an expansion to EVERQUEST and a couple of other unannounced massively multiplayer games. Garriott also sees a lot of growth potential in this market: \"We see these games going all over the map. We have only just begun to scratch the surface with this style of gaming. Right now all our competitors are doing \"me too\" virtual world games. We have a list of over 100 announced competitors. The list shows 60-percent ULTIMA-style games, 30-percent WING COMMANDER-style qames.\" So will massively multiplayer overtake single-player games in popularity? Brad McQuaid doesn't think so: \"I wouldn't say overtake,\" he said. \"But they can become as large. They provide different experiences. They can co-exist with single-player games.\" Garriott agrees: \"They will at least rival them for dominance to be sure. Single-player games will always be a strong force in gaming though. I still see both styles of game with a great future.\" What Origin doesn't see, however, are any newsingle player games in their own plans beyond ULTIMA ASCENSION and A-10 WARTHOG. After that they have only multiplayer games planned, including the all-but-announced WING COMMANDER ONLINE and ULTIMA ONLINE 2 games. More To Come Other upcoming massively multiplayer games players can look forward to include MIDDLE EARTH from Sierra, set in Tolkien's fictional land; HERO'S JOURNEY from Simutronics, their first graphical RPG; FREELANCER from Chris Roberts' Digital Anvil, a PRIVATEER-like game; and the rumored Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game being developed by Bioware (makers of BALDUR'S GATE) for Interplay. There is one sticky aspect about these games that may keep some developers away, according to McQuaid: \"You need a large company with a lot of funding behind you. These games cost two or three times as much to develop as a traditional game.\" Maybe they should just auction off some of THE NEXT BIG THING?

Here, players will be able to host or join races that take place late at night (in the gameworld) on city streets, with the possibility of police cars in pursuit. Races will be either for a set amount of cash, or, for the truly bold, for pink slips. That's right: Lose the race, and you lose your car, permanently (unless you win it back). EA is working on a whole reputation system, based on such elements as your win/loss record, how many challenges you've refused, how many times you've dropped out, and the number of times you've successfully eluded the police. END. FRAG FOR FREE A Whole New World EA is aiming for much more than a simple matchmaking service here. Their big goal is to create a virtual racing world, with a dynamic economy and real sense of community. The \"hubs\" where gamers will meet to chat and to host and join races are represented visually by '50s-style diners and drive-ins. When you enter a hub, your car will be seen parked in the lot (or cruising by if the lot is full). Gamers will be able to set up clans, or racing teams, and a dynamic buddy list will let you keep track of where your friends are online. The Motor City Gazette will be a daily online news source where gamers can submit listings to buy and sell (and possibly auction) cars, paint jobs, and custom parts. Those who've designed a particularly cool paint job can also upload it to one of the game's paint FRAG FOREVER ONLINE FREE ON GAST FR AMING CRUISIN' FOR A BRUISIN' A look at one of MOTOR CITY'S '50s-style hubs, where gamers will be able to chat, set up races, and show off their wheels in the parking NET lot. ON HEAT.NET shops, and if another gamer buys it, the designer gets a cut of the profits. Buying, selling, and trading cars is anticipated to be as huge a part of the game as the actual racing--and it doesn't take much of a stretch to imagine car sales winding up on separate auction services such as eBay. The biggest hitch for this whole project, of course, is the technology. Will EA really be able to translate the high-polygon, 3D beauty of its NFS engine into an online racing game that won't break down over latency issues? Will only those with cable modems or T1 lines be able to play? EA is claiming they'll be able to keep the requirements relatively low but admit that they are breaking new ground here and, like ULTIMA ONLINE, it may take a while to shake itself out. As of this writing, EA is on the verge of beta testing for Internet play through HIGH STAKES and hopes to work out the latency problems in time for MOTOR CITY's scheduled winter release.

The game opens with a guy on a horse in the middle of a map full of rolling hills and pixie dust. Your task, as in HEROES, is to muster an army of fantasy creatures and capture towns. So our first reaction was, why bother? Why bother playing a rip-off of an awarding-winning, classic design? But once we got beyond the surface similarities, we found that AGE OF WONDERS doesn't play the same as 3DO's fantasy classic.

"Gearbox Comes Up With a Unique Take on the Original Story SNEAK_PREVIEWS Half-Life: Coposing Opposing Force ALF-LIFE: OPPOSING FORCE opens with you, Corporal Adrian Shepard, sitting inside a military chopper on its approach to the Black Mesa compound. The drill sergeant is briefing you on your mission which basically centers around \"containing\" the quagmire Gordon Freeman is stuck in the middle of-when your Osprey goes down in a ball of flames. Tended to by some scientists, you come to your senses inside Black Mesa. Being a tough-as-nails soldier type, you pick up a pipe wrench and join the fray. around. These super-powered Al soldiers will play vitally helpful roles in the game, you can call them up from radios for support, get them to cut through doors, or even get the medic soldiers to heal you. But the game wouldn't be HALF-LIFE without two key components that made this 3D shooter such a smash in 1998: plot development and terror. You enter the plot right around the time Gordon Freeman encounters the military in the original game. But from this point on, you and he are on separate story paths within the same universe. While your paths may cross a few times, you have your own business to take care of, bub. (Part of said business: Using the loader you see at the beginning of HALFLIFE to solve a puzzle.) Lest I spoil the story, I'll stop short of giving the specifics, but having played through a few of the game's levels I can say that OPPOSING FORCE has more twists and turns than the lines to see Phantom Menace and more horrifying moments than a high-school dance. In one scene, blue arcs of electric energy start whittling down the size of the room you're trapped in, which then begins flooding with toxic green goo. The OPPOSING FORCE designers promised me that over the course of the game they would answer many of the questions HALF-LIFE left lingering. The suitcase-bearing GMan's role will be explained a bit more, as will the nature of the experiments going on at the Black Mesa facility. I'd be surprised, however, if OPPOSING FORCE doesn't create as many questions as it answers, what with HALF-LIFE 2 in the works and all. MMMMM...DONUTS Note to self: Otis, one of the game's new Al characters, may not make the best travel companion. TOTI Answer My Questions! OPPOSING FORCE is more than a more-of-the-same add-on. It expands the HALF-LIFE universe in terms of both gameplay and, more importantly, story. A batch of new weapons (see sidebar) await your most destructive impulses, and a new cadre of monsters-from the new Pit Drones to the massive, highly intelligent Shock Troopers that control the Pit Drones-can't wait to make your acquaintance. Also new to the game are the ninja Black Ops forces to complement the rare but lethal female Assassin units. Thankfully, you're not all alone. Your soldier friends are at your side this time That's What Friends Are For OPPOSING FORCE should one-up the original product in the multiplayer arena. Gearbox has approached several of the top 3D-shooter level designers, such as Ritual Entertainment's Levelord, and signed them up to design multiplayer levels for the game. The final product will feature 12 of these celebrity-designed maps. The multiplayer mode will incorporate all the game's weaponry-old and new. It sure would be nice if you could play as the aliens, though. (Hint, hint.) CGW OPPOSING FORCE will add seven new weapons to the mix. TOUGH TOYS FOR TOUGH BOYS At one point in the game, you face a massive alien confrontation with a squadron of your boys by your side. Biological Agents of Justice Pipe Wrench: Functions like the crowbar, but it's three times as large. .357 Desert Eagle: A fast and accurate sidearm; using the alternate-fire laser scope makes the gun even more accurate. M29: A super-heavy machine gun capable of tiring many rounds per second Spore Launcher: A biological rocket launcher, with an alternate-fire grenade launcher. Barnacle: This biological grappling hook allows you to bring the enemy into your arms, or make like Spiderman. Shock Rifle: It's a rapid-fire energy weapon. It's a spider. It's both! The Shock Rifle infuses victims with blue pulses of energy Displacer: In the multiplayer game, the Displacer (the massive weapon modeled by the soldier to the left) instantly teleports multiplayer opponents to a random respawn position on the map.

"ACTION All the Games You'll Want to Play, You'll Need to Play, From Now Until the Next Century HOT LIST Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms We're really looking forward to NovaLogic's DELTA FORCE 2 (Q4 '99). The trademarked voxel engine is sporting 32 bit color for environments that are nowhere as drab as those of the first game, allowing for the use of fog to counter players who leaned too heavily on sniping in multiplayer mode. DELTA FORCE's terrain was second to none, and that dominance continues with the addition of rocks, trees, and very tall grass-perfect for a sniper to slither through. With vastly improved teammate control, fixed weapon emplacements, and new weapons that can shoot through tents and walls, DELTA FORCE 2 is looking sweet indeed. We're also looking forward to PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D, the sequel to Jordan Mechner's classic side-scroller. POP 3D preserves the flavor of the original game with realistic, motion-cap DEEP FIGHTER tured anima tions of running, jumping climbing and fighting. The artwork looks great, and the action is perfectly evocative of an Arabian Nights adventure. (To see for yourself, check out the preview trailer on this month's CG-ROM). SUB CULTURE was a cool game that got overlooked. Even so, it must have caught the attention of enough gamers to warrant a sequel. DEEP FIGHTER (Q1 '00). DEEP FIGHTER will retain the Lilliputian feel, physics model, and abundant sea-life of SUB CULTURE, while adding more action and some strategy (think BATTLEZONE) to the mix. While EIDOS has announced a new TOMB RAIDER game for 2000, the designers at Core Design are being very close mouthed about the whole thing. What we do know is that TOMB RAIDER IV will feature a brand-new game engine and that it will be one of the first games optimized for the Pentium III. The wish for a decent Star Trek action game could finally come to fruition in Activision's STAR TREK VOYAGER: ELITE FORCE (Q1 '00). Developed by Raven Software, the first game based on the Star Trek Voyager TV series is a first-person shooter using the QUAKE III engine. As the leader of an elite security force, you'll defend Voyager after it is sucked into a new dimension: you'll gain in rank and the ability to command forces as the game progresses. Not quite Austin Powers, not quite James Bond, Monolith's NO ONE LIVES FOREVER (Q2 '00) is a tongue-in-cheek f you've seen a WWII war movie, you've seen a preview of Valve's TEAM FORTRESS 2: BROTHERHOOD OF ARMS. TF2's intense 3D action and team-based play evoke classic scenes of heroism under fire. Designed to be immediately accessible and understandable to even the most casual gamer, TF2 could bring 3D action to the masses of armchair Private Ryans. The team-oriented design will offer something for everyone and every style of play. While veteran action gamers will surely go great guns for the heavy infantry, rocket infantry, and sniper classes, gamers with less refined shooting skills or more refined sensibilities can choose to contribute in crucial supporting roles as medics, turret-building engineers, or overseeing commanders that direct the movement of their team. While every class will be able to do at least one thing well, no one class will be able to succeed without the help of others. For example, a heavy infantryman can lay down a withering barrage of suppression fire, but he'll need snipers to take out rocket-firing foes that are pinning him down and medics to pull shrapnel from his hide. By making each unit a unique and vital part of the whole, the Valve design team is clearly encouraging tight, disciplined team play as opposed to the loosely allied, chaotic mobs that pass for teams in other 3D action environments. While TF2 will have standard play modes such as Capture the Flag, we expect TF2 will really shine in its campaign games, in which the linked scenarios unfold with sweeping cinematic effect. One campaign puts teams on either side of a beach invasion, segues to a perilous march through fields, and then culminates in a pitched strug. gle over a village bridge. Our editorial Magnificent Seven can't wait to play it.

But HIDDEN AND DANGEROUS actually could be something that wargame grognards and action fans can agree on. SOLDIER OF FORTUNE Hidden and Dangerous bosses.

"Quake III: Arena m...you might have heard about this one. The no-question, musthave title for action fans this year, QUAKE M: ARENA is shaping up to be the last word in DeathMatch fury. The release of the test version has only heightened our pathetically slobbering anticipation by offering a glimpse at the beauty, speed, and sheer explosive power of the game as well as a tantalizing taste of the deviously crafted levels we can expect to litter with the gibs of friends and loved ones. With dynamically scaling bots ensuring that gamers of all skills can earn their chops in single-player before taking the plunge into online play, QUAKE III: ARENA could be the game that brings the brutal art of DeathMatch to the masses. Q4 '99, Activision, www.activision.com Giants: Citizen Kabuto m he MDK team is back with another wacky third-person game, but don't turn the page just yet. GIANTS, a 3D action game inspired by atomic-age monster flicks, looks to be one of the better third-person games for the winter season. GIANTS' visuals and play style really blew us back a few feet. No dark tombs here, the game takes place on colorful islands populated by the most bizarre critters. Of course, pretty graphics can't carry a game, so we were thrilled to play a scenario as Kabuto, the very angry giant representing one of three sides in the game, and experience the happy-happy-joy-joy of smashing buildings and picking up little human types to munch on. The other teams of monstrosities have their moments, too; conjuring sea monsters and tornadoes with the spell-power of the Sea Reaper is great for kicks, as is using the more staid but ruthlessly efficient formations and stealth suits of the techie Meccaryns. As of press time, the single-player game is still being tweaked, and the multiplayer mode should be hammered out by the time you read this. 04'99, Interplay, www.interplay.com Loose Cannon ar combat games are a dime a dozen, but when the lead designer is Tony Zurovec, the man behind both of Origin's incredible CRUSADER games, gamers had better keep their eyes on the road. Players will be cast as Ashe, a mercenary in a near future America ravaged by economic, collapse. Unlike the tongue-in-cheek style of INTERSTATE \"76, LOOSE CANNON is going for a more realistic feel to draw gamers in, with realistic traffic patterns, a police force that will respond to reckless pedestrian poaching, and no action gamey power-ups. Gameplay will blend both on-foot and behind-the-wheel battles, with Ashe able to leave his car at will to fight enemies, car-jack new rides, and pursue fugitives into buildings. The action rolls through nine cities and 12 sprawling countryside areas where the bad guys have barricaded themselves in wellquarded fortresses. Twenty core missions develop a storyline centered on busting a criminal cartel, with optional money-making missions such as hostage rescues, recon assignments, and assassinations. Tom Clancy's Rogue Spear TA7 ith an all-new graphics rendering engine, vastly improved AI, and a host of new features, ROGUE SPEAR should only improve on its groundbreaking precursor RAINBOW SIX. The new pixel-pushing code will allow for spectacular environments such as the Prague Opera House and impressive weather effects like snow and rain. The Observer mode from the EAGLE WATCH expansion pack has been retained great for gamers who opt just to command their teams and not actually do the shooting. An emphasis on ease of use is apparent in a sleek, streamlined interface that will make team selection, load-outs, and commands easier to manage. That's a good thing since players will have even more options and tools at their disposal including the ability to peer around corners, move while crouching, and sit down in an accurate sniper posture. Overhauled AI should result in even deadlier enemies that will seek cover instead of waiting to be killed and, even more importantly, in team members that won't huddle in the corners of rooms like a bunch of shitty-pants recruits.

"Wheel of Time HOT LIST ased on the popular series of fantasy novels by Robert Jordan, WHEEL OF TIME is unlike any other first-person action title. Instead of just blowing away hordes of monsters while looking for an exit, gamers will instead be collecting and defending a number of magical seals as they combat the evil Black Ajah. Rather than weapons, players will wield spells in the form of Ter'angreal, magical elements that will let you shoot fireballs, release enemy-seeking magic missiles, and even disguise you so you are able to blend in with your enemies. The game makes its break from the ordinary with its multiplayer game, in which gamers will have to collect seals from opponents while guarding their own seals in a custom-built citadel. Utilizing a simple editing tool, you'll plot your own defenses in the form of tilting staircases, spear traps, and groups of monsters, freeing you to go out in the world and thwart the devious traps of your enemies to snatch their seals. Q4 '99, GT Interactive, www.wheeloftime.com SWAT 3: Close-Quarters Battle Tn a radical departure from the removed perspective of previous SWAT games, SWAT 3: CLOSEQUARTERS BATTLE puts gamers into the police issue boots of this elite strike force. Set in Los Angeles in the year 2005, SWAT 3 is shooting for a high degree of realism with its 20 missions taking place in real-life locations such as the air traffic control tower at LAX, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and the lush Bel Aire Hotel. SWAT 3's ambition to create as truthful and tense a close-quarters combat experience as possible is impressive, and is especially apparent in a painstakingly accurate ballistic model, which goes so far as to track each pellet fired in a shotgun blast. As in real life, high-powered weaponry can be used to shoot through walls, and, of course, your enemies will be able to do the same. In order to survive, gamers will have to learn such real-life tactics as working corners, following appropriate room-clearing procedure, and even count ing the rounds their weapons fire.

"Vampire: The Masquerade HOT LIST emember when everyone said that RPGs are dead? Now, following the massive success of BALDUR'S GATE, the genre is hotter than ever. How appropriate, then, that the RPG we're most excited about in 1999 is about rising from the dead. The developer, Nihilistic Software, gave us a spin on its latest build of VAMPIRE, and we're still a bunch of drooling idiots after seeing this game. In case you missed our infamous April issue, the story focuses on what happens when a fanatical anti-vampire knight ironically becomes a vampire. You can play the game from either a firstor third-person perspective (we preferred third). The interface is a simple point-and-click affair; combat is real-time, but the team is feverishly working on reducing the DIABLOstyle clickfest. The party members already move autonomously depending on their general aggression, and you'll have easy access to various Disciplines (a.k.a. skills), weapons, and abilities. We also got to see a lot of the Disciplines, with Plague Wind, Obfuscate, and Lure of Flames looking particularly cool. Of course, how can you talk about vampires without the blood sucking? The \"feeding\" looks as creepy as it should, and we noticed that if you try it right in the middle of the street, the guards will come after you, so you'll need to be discreet. Also, feed on too many humans, and your Humanity rating drops, and you may lose the game. The architecture for both 13th-century Prague and modern London looks great; there'll be two sets of party members for both periods, with the character Christof being the only constant. With the current status of the single-player, and Nihilistic's bold plans for the Storyteller multiplayer mode, VAMPIRE looks to be the single coolest RPG this year. Q4 '99, Activision, www.activision.com Deus Ex inally, this game has been declassified. Looking at L it, you wouldn't think it was made with the UNREAL engine because of the numerous RPG-style additions, such as a skill system, dialogue, a real inventory, and a maddening sense of detail. Character development is defined with skills (à la FALLOUT), nanotechnology augmentations (physical enhancements), and even the contents of your inventory. Design guru Warren Spector showed off the effect of the skills system; with a low sniper rifle skill, the crosshair kept on jittering and making it hard to hit your target, but a high skill makes your crosshair stay in place. He hesitated to use the word immersive, but the gameworld is very detailed; you can read every newspaper and use every computer, and NPCs will react to whatever you happen to be doing. With the issue of linearity versus nonlinearity. DEUS EX will compromise by giving you missions with fixed goals; how you achieve said goals completely depends on how you play your character. The back-story casts you as J.C. Denton, a new member of the antiterrorism organization UNATCO. You start a few missions in New York, but the plot really gets rolling once you travel to Hong Kong. Other locations include Paris and even the White House (as close to the real deal as they can make it), plus a few places Spector didn't want to disclose just yet. Finally, he wanted to make sure players don't become frustrated, so every conversation, significant event, and important map will be logged in for easy reference later on. A worldspanning, first-person spy RPG-too bad it's coming here February 2000, at the earliest. Q1 '00, Ion Storm, www.ionstorm.com RPG/ ADVENTURE DIABLO II More RPG Blockbusters What more is there to say about DIABLO 2(Q4 '99 ? As usual, Blizzard is taking its sweet time with this sequel to one of the biggest gaming blockbusters of the decade--and who can blame them? Every time they take the time to get things right, they end up delivering Killer gaming. This action/RPG is deeper. more complex, and a lot longer (filling four CDs) than the original, in hopes of delivering a richer role-playing experience to accompany the stel lar hack-and-slash.

"Planescape: Torment SI LOH Then most people think of AD&D, they think of dragons and wussy little elves, not of sarcastic talking skulls or a tower of living heads. These are typical elements in PLANESCAPE: TORMENT and illustrative of the radical departure that developer Black Isle is taking for its next AD&D game. While you do wake up with amnesia, you also realize that you died. Here you don't really gain levels; you trigger memories, since your character has literally done it all. It's single-player only and uses a modified version of the BALDUR'S GATE engine. The interface has been streamlined, so you get more eye candy when you walk around, which is helpful because TORMENT has such an abstract and imaginative setting. Gameplay is similar to that of BALDUR'S GATE, with the significant addition of the faction system, all NPCs now belong to factions, so every action has consequences for how NPCs will relate with you. The surreal look on top of the unique Planescape universe makes TORMENT a serious contender this year. Q3 '99, Interplay/Black Isle, www.interplay.com System Shock 2 ULTIMA ASCENSION (Q4 '99) has generated more Internet discussion among RPG fanatics than any other game on this list, and for good rea son. It's the latest, and reputedly the last, of Richard Gamott's singe: player ULTIMA games--games that have defined and towered over the RPG genre for years. Featuring a gorgeous, fully interactive 3D environment and third-person perspective, the game generated early heat (from here and elsewhere) for veering towards a TOMB RAIDER style of gameplay, but those fears may have been premature, as the latest versions we've seen reveal a game that's still unmistakably ULTIMA. Decide for yourself this Christmas. Like DEUS EX, Tom Hall's righteous-looking ANACHRONOX (94 '99) is showing strong promise as a title that may turn lon Storm's luck around. This ambitious, console style, fantasy/Sci-fi RPG had a great showing at E3, based mainly on some truly inspired 3D artwork and animation. We know, we know the gameplay's the thing, and we des perately need to see more of it, but for now we're putting our faith in lon Storm's resident mad genius-who has a couple of games called WOLFENSTEIN 3D and DOOM on his resume. WEREWOLF. THE HEART OF GAIA (Q4 '99) is the next game from Dreamforge and ASC Games, the team behind last year's award-winning SANITARIUM. Based on the pen. and paper RPG from White Wolf, WEREWOLF promises to be a dark, horror-tinged, emotionally complex role-playing experience, as you take on the role of a shape-shifting were wolf. The state of the art graphics, based on the UNREAL engine, may put this one over the top. SEPTERRA CORE (Q3 '99) has been around a while, as it has bounced between publishers, but it looks to finally be on track for a release this fall from Monolith. This anime-influenced, console-style RPG has some nice, original touches, and may be a sleeper hit. Speaking of console RPGs, SquareSoft EA is porting over their next uber-RPG. FINAL FANTASY VIII. They learned their lessons from FINAL FANTASY VII, and they're working on the 3D-card problems, making the art cleaner, and making the game look less like anime. They're also aiming for a ship date soon after the console release (Q4 '99), rather than the nearly-a-year-later release for FFVII. sk anyone in this industry about his or her | favorite games, and you're bound to hear the name SYSTEM SHOCK a few times. SYSTEM SHOCK was one of those \"great games that not enough people played,\" and for years and years fans kept on asking for a sequel. Well, those wishes have finally been answered; the premier offering from Irrational Games (a team of exLooking Glass developers) will be SYSTEM SHOCK 2. Irrational has made quite a bit of progress since the last build we tinkered with for our May issue preview. Psi Powers have been finalized, and there are a whopping 35 powers total, in addition to the 14 weapons, 11 implants, and dozens of random inventory items. Like DEUS EX, SYSTEM SHOCK 2 will go for the \"same puzzle, multiple solutions\" approach, and for those of you who missed the puzzle-style mini-games while hacking, it's back. SYSTEM SHOCK 2 looks very solid, and we think more people will play this title and give the series the recognition it deserves. Q3 '99, Looking Glass/Irrational Games, www.glass.com Gabriel Knight III: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned T his is the adventure game genre's last great hope, or possibly last, dying gasp-not that 1 there's any pressure on it or anything. But if any game could ever rescue the genre, GABRIEL KNIGHT III is it. Designed by Jane Jensen, the brilliant storyteller behind the first two games in the series, GKIII once again plunges headlong into the realm of supernatural mystery, as Gabriel and cohort Grace Nakamura investigate the disappearance of a dethroned royal's newborn son. The investigation takes them all the way to a mystery of biblical proportions-as anyone who's seen the controversial ads for the game knows. GABRIEL KNIGHT III is exchanging the full-motion video approach of the previous game for a full-3D engine, an inevitability of the times, Sierra was less successful than hoped for with KING'S QUEST VIII, their last major adventure game to make the switch to 3D, but GKIII, grounded with stubborn determination in traditional adventure gaming and emotionally complex storytelling, has a much greater chance for success. As adventure game fans, we sure hope so. Q3, '99, Sierra Studios, www.sierra.com 34 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD SEPTEMBER 1999 www.computergaming.com "

This fantastic voyage to a console-style fighting to the parallel universe to rescue a standard RPG mix. From the Jane's Baltimore team that brought you F. 115 comes a simulation of the U.S. Navy's newest carrier attack plane, the F/A-18E Super Hornet. The sim will carry over the best elements of JANE'S F-15, including deadly realistic flight modeling, detailed instruments, and a wide variety of weapons and combat scenarios. But what's even more notable is what's improved. The first thing you'll notice is the state-of-the-art graphics engine, which now supports Direct3D and is rid of the \"melting mountains\" syndrome that plagued F-15. Higher screen resolutions will also be supported. You'll fly the F/A-18E from the deck of the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), and the action won't stop when you exit combat. In fact, the most challenging aspect of the game may be putting the plane down on the pitching, rolling deck in what promises to be the most realistic simulation of carrier operations yet. The F/A-18E is a fly-by-wire plane, so look for a very different feel than in the F-15 sim. The campaign promises to be more immersive and Asheron's Call The next great massively multiplayer RPG comes from 1 Microsoft, in which you play the role of a young computer scientist attempting to rid the world of an oppressive techno-corporate monolith. Just kidding! Following the groundwork laid by ULTIMA ONLINE, and later by EVERQUEST, ASHERON'S CALL is shaping up nicely as another fantasy-based online game overlaid with a strong social element. The coolest and most original aspect of ASHERON'S CALL is the loyalty system, which allows newbies to pledge themselves to more experienced players. It's a win-win situation: Weak newbies get the protection they need, while the protectors get a portion of the pro. tectees' experience points. Rather than actively hunting newbies in order to kill them, then, experienced players will be out to forge bonds with new allies-a brilliant way to deal with the endless PK problem (not that it will ever go away.) We'll bring you reports of the ASHERON'S CALL beta test very soon. Q4 '99, Microsoft, www.microsoft.com replayable than the one in F-15.

"SIMS & SPACE Sims Galore Jane's A-10 WARTHOG, pre viewed in our February issue, has been delayed until the third quarter. With its unique Forward Air Controller mode, it promises to be the definitive A-10 sim. Among the other sims we've recently previewed are FLIGHT UNLIMITED II (Q3 '99), a civilian sim with ultraHOT LIST Freelancer FLIGHT UNLIMITED III C hris Roberts' epic space combat and trading game is undeniably one of the most impressive titles we've seen this year. In fact, it may be as groundbreaking as Roberts' original WING COMMANDER. Roberts wants to push technology to the limit, and he appears ready to accomplish that goal if the nebula-combat scene that journalists were shown at the recent E3 trade show was any indication. As the ship moved through a gaseous space crackling with electricity, viewers were treated to effects that blew away the nebula scenes in THE WRATH OF KHAN. Jumpgate and asteroid-belt scenes were similarly impressive, but perhaps most impressive was the sense of scale of the highly detailed, over-10,000-polygon space stations. This isn't just a technology demo, though. It also establishes a new paradigm for space combat. Instead of flying your ship like a plane (an effort that, in space combat, often ends up involving little more than sitting and spinning), you'll actually guide your ship with the mouse, concentrating more on targeting than the minutiae of maneuvering. Instead of honing your twitch skills, you'll instead buy maneuvering upgrades for your ship's computer. We were skeptical about this, but seeing it in action, we're convinced. Kiss the WING COMMANDER scripted storyline goodbye. FREELANCER sports a cause-and-effect universe with a prede. fined set of rules that governs events. This means that things are happening all over the universe, not just around you, and that you can take the storyline in unanticipated directions. The original plan was for FREELANCER to support up to 100 players on a QUAKEstyle client/server, but now Roberts plans to release a 1,000-plus-player persistent universe version six months after the main game ships.

Also from Empire is COMANCHE/HOKUM (Q2 '00). a sequel to APACHE/HAVOC that will concentrate on the USAF TT SAF is being created with the assistance of the U.S. Air Force. Building on an improved engine that gets rid of the shimmering terrain of IAF, USAF promises an interesting balance of authenticity and accessibility. USAF's campaigns span 40 years, from Vietnam to the Gulf War to a current-day German scenario. In Vietnam, you'll fly the F-4E Phantom and the F-105 Thud. The Gulf War will drop you into the cockpit of the F-15 Eagle, F-16 Falcon, and A-10 Warthog. The German campaign lets you pilot the high-tech F-22 Raptor and F-117 Nighthawk. Other traffic will range from MiGs and Sukhois to B-2 Spirits and KC-135s. Look for some interesting AI here. According to Jane's, \"It's easy to make the AI perfect, but it's not so easy to make it imperfect.\" The idea is to have the AI make the same sort of mistakes or have the same limitations as a human pilot. Multiplayer looks promising, especially if the Jane's World War scheme, which promises to link different sims in the same universe, actually comes to fruition.

And tank fans can soon look forward to Psygnosis' PANZER ELITE, a graphically splendid WWII tank sim, and Novalogic's ARMORED FIST 3 (Q3 '99). with support for Novalogic's superb Novaworld mas sive multiplayer arenas. FREESPACE 2 Space Shots If gravity gets you down, fear not. There's plenty of action coming on the space simula tion front. FREESPACE 2 (Q4 '99) features enhanced graphics. dazzling nebula effects. and enhanced squadron-based multiplayer support. Fans of WING COMMANDER who don't want to wait for Origin's distant online version will want to check out STARLANCER (Q4 '99). which has the feel of the classic WING COMMANDER games crossed with a WWII air-combat film. Sierra's stunning BABYLON 5 SPACE COMBAT SIM has been pushed back into early 2000 due to upheavals at the company. Even with the delay, its awesome 3D engine will dazzle you with effects rivaling that of the TV show. INDEPENDENCE WAR DELUXE will bundle the award-winning original with a completely new campaign that lets you play for the other side. Finally, there's Novalogic's TACHYON: THE FRINGE (Q4 '99). While the graphics in early versions couldn't match the likes of FREESPACE 2, the game's free-form storyline and support for 120-player Novaworld play make it one of the most interesting space sims coming down the pike. ERVING CHAMBERLAIN Driving Super Super SUNDAY! Once the domain of the ultra-hard-core, wrenchesand-ratchets style of gaming, racing games are getting more popular and more mainstream by the month. As always, EA Sports is right in the thick of it all with two titles. NASCAR 2000 (Q4 *99), the company's latest creation in their action-oriented racing franchise, sports some snazzy graphics and such real-life racers as Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnheardt Jr. The company also recently announced an alliance with PACE Motor Sports, the organization that presents the Supercross Motorcycle competitions. One of the companies we haven't heard much from is Motorsims. This newly created Dallas-based sim shop is working feverishly on two upcoming Net-based racing games: AMA SUPERBIKE (Q4 '99), a motorcycle roadNBA Live 2000 ccasionally, we wonder if the NBA hasn't seen its best days. Yeah, yeah-Shaq and the Lakers are exciting, and sure the Knickerbockers' amazing run was great. But did it ever really get any better than the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird-Michael Jordan years? No sir. Perhaps EA Sports feels our pain, because the company's expanding the scope of NBA LIVE 2000 to include Afro-ed, short shorts-wearing classic players from the history of the NBA Imagine matching up Dr. J versus Bird, Kareem versus Shaq, or even Magic against Jerry West. (Don't even think about getting your hopes up for Michael Jordan.) And what better place to hoop it up than the new one-on-one street ball courts EA is wrapping into the game? Old-school innovations like this, on top of the amazing graphics and courtside ambience NBA LIVE brings to the table, have us all excited about computer basketball again.

"Madden 2000 Football on the PC has never looked this good. In the latest edition of JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL, fans will finally feel what EA Sports basketball and hockey fans have experienced for the last few years: a gorgeous-looking, true-to-life sports game. Beyond the high-quality visuals, MADDEN 2000 features an improved running game, character sizes that allow players to accurately reflect their real-life counterparts, and the usually strong defensive AI. To top it all off, this time around you'll be able to set up a multiplayer franchise mode-perfect for beating your friends through the ages. Q4 '99, EA Sports, www.easports.com HOT LIST racer, and SCCA CAN AM. which is based on the Sports Car Club of America's Can Am Prototype Racing series. Huge in the 1970s, this series is currently in the midst of a comeback, and Motorsims will be capturing the thrill of this road-track racing title on the computer. And then there's TEST DRIVE. Infogrames (formerly Accolade) is going all out with their long-standing driving series. Over the next 12 months, we'l be seeing five different racing games under this title. The first two games scheduled for release are TEST DRIVE 6 (Q4 '99) and TEST DRIVE OFF-ROAD 3 (Q4 '99). Each will feature more of what made these games popular slick graphics and fast, fun, racing action that surpasses last year's models. TEST DRIVE 6 will even incorporate car upgrades and multiplayer pinkslip racing. Later on next year, we'll see TEST DRIVE RALLY, TEST DRIVE CYCLES, and the ultimate enduro-racer: TEST DRIVE LE MANS, which will feature an optional, real-life 24hour race. Motocross Madness 2 raphics alone do not a great game make. But combine them with an already superb game, and you've got gold in them there hills. The premise of MOTOCROSS MADNESS 2 (Q1 '00) hasn't changed much since the original game, which received our CGW Editors' Choice award earlier this year. Hop on a dirt bike. Race against the computer or your friends. Perform deathand gravity-defying feats. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. The genius of MOTOCROSS MADNESS IRING is that it makes riding a simulated dirt bike fun. Wide-open tracks and a mode that lets you compete in the open desert by giving you points for performing certain stunts make this so much more than a standard ring-around-the-track kind of game. But what's really striking about MOTOCROSS MADNESS 2 is the fact that when you're racing across the desert, the over-the-shoulder camera presents visual imagery so photorealistic, you can almost feel the wind buzzing through your hair. Q1 '00, Microsoft, www.microsoft.com Football With Hasbro Interactive's recent announcement that they're getting into the sports field. expect to see an NFLlicensed, action-oriented pigskin title from them in the next two years. Other than that, it's slim pickings. EA Sports' FANTASY FOOTBALL (Q3 '99) recently raised some interest among the highly competitive but physically uncoordinated CGW staff.

"Motor City Madness HOT LIST with your friends, or play in leagues across the country. And in a new twist for a fantasy league, instead of relying on statistics that your player generates in real life, you can let the builtin EA Sports simulation engine play your games for you. Soccer When it comes to soccer, we have one word for you. Actually, it's an acronym: FIFA. FIFA 99 rocks, so we expect FIFA 2000 (Q4 '99) to go beyond that. How will they possibly transcend last year's sports game-of-the-year version? Better animations that Include midair collisions, classic teams, and players from the past are just the start. Tn MOTOR CITY MADNESS, Electronic Arts is taking its vaunted NEED FOR SPEED racing franchise back in time...and online. Featuring a slew of classic cars, including the Corvette Stingray, the Pontiac GTO, and even a 1932 Ford Coupe, MOTOR CITY MADNESS allows you to race in two different ways. Sanctioned road races pit you against the computer or your friends on a variety of different tracks. Unsanctioned road races take place on city streets. Win and you get a chance to upgrade your beat-up P.O.S. into a real hot rod. Lose, and you may lose your car. For more on MOTOR CITY MADNESS, which also features a unique and robust mode of Internet play, take a look at our sneak preview in this issue. Q4 '99, Electronic Arts, www.ea.com FIFA 2000 NBA Inside Drive 2000 D elieve it or not, Microsoft has a hoops contender that looks like it can actually stay on the floor with NBA LIVE. We were able to spend some quality time playing NBA INSIDE DRIVE 2000 and came away mightily impressed. While the game's look and feel were a little short of EA Sports' juggernaut, NBA LIVE 2000, the game action seemed stronger and more realistic in Microsoft's version. (Did we really just say that?) As the flow of the game unfolded, we got the impression that we were really playing basketball. Time will tell, but it would appear that EA Sports finally has some real competition on the court. Q4 '99, Microsoft, www.microsoft.com Proving that they catch on fast, and that some day soon they may be a serious challenger to EA Sports' domination. MICROSOFT'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER (24 '99) is no slouch in the soccer category Golf By purchasing Access Software, Microsoft plucked the crown jewel of golf and put it in their pocket. LINKS LS 2000 (Q4 '99) will feature five new courses, including St. Andrews Old Course, and new modes of play. The game will also provide an optional, one-click mouse swing mode for the uncoordinated among us. And, of course, EA Sports will be releasing TIGER WOODS 2000 (Q4 '99), which will feature a heavier emphasis on accurate simulation and a Tour mode that lets you compete on the PGA tour. NHL 2000 www.ahl.com wwW.NHLPA.COM he CGW crowd is an odd bunch. 1 A crowd will gather to watch two editors play PC hockey, but the real thing comes on TV and you'd think someone had flipped to CSPAN. Either real life is too frightening a concept for us or somehow EA Sports has created a hockey game that is actually more interesting than the real thing. NHL 2000 features more of the same quality gameplay we've come to expect, and then some. Harder hits, improved player animations, and a simple two-button play mode are just some of the improvements we're expecting to see this time around. Unless Fox Interactive's NHL CHAMPIONSHIP 2000 pulls off a miracle shot, EA Sports has the hockey market all wrapped up.

"HOT LIST STRATEGY Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun he grandaddy of the RTS genre is expected to be rebom hard later this month (August 23). The long-awaited sequel to COMMAND & CONQUER preserves much of the original flavor while adding loads of environmental factors, from 3D terrain to weather effects. The game picks up 30 years after the first one, with the Brotherhood of Nod once again poised to kick the crap out of the GDI. There will also be a new faction, the Forgotten, a group of former civilians (now mutants) who were left behind in the cities during the GDI evacuation. Westwood's goal with TIBERIAN SUN is to break new ground, literally. They've rewritten the C&C engine to support 15 layers of terrain so you can tunnel under your enemies or blow up entire hillsides. The weather can also change the map, as bodies of water freeze, bridges are destroyed, meteorites crash, or ion storms modify the terrain. Neither the terrain nor the units are modeled in 3D, which is good news for gamers who don't have 3D cards. The units will be voxels set on top of landscape viewed in an isometric perspective. Some of the old units return, such as the Orca bomber and the Obelisk of Light (shown). New units include spies, recon drones, and mercenary commandos. Our personal favorites include tanks that burrow underground and pop up for surprise attacks, and the Mammoth Mark II, a walking tank several stories high. For more details, tune in next month for a complete overview of the game, along with killer strategies on how to win. Q4 '99, Westwood/EA, www.westwood.com More Bang for Your Buck Star Trek's mission this year is to boldly go onto your hard drive, with no fewer than three strategy titles in the works. Interplay has two of the games, STAR TREK: NEW WORLDS (Q4 '99) and STARFLEET COMMAND (Q3 '99). Using the complex penand-paper STARFLEET BATTLES game as a foundation, STARFLEET COMMAND melds an in-depth spaceship-management simulation with realtime combat, while STAR TREK: NEW WORLDS is a more traditional real-time strategy title, with four races vying for resources and engaging in ground-based combat. Activision's STAR TREK: ARMADA (Q4 '99) is in the same real-time vein as NEW WORLDS but moves its battles into the vastness of space. While it doesn't feature all the STAR TREK: ARMADA Vobole new units sported by NEW WORLDS, every starship does have a special attack, and the game should enjoy the added 00 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD SEPTEMBER 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"benefit of being more immediate ly recognizable and understood by gamers. SSI is in the midst of its most creative explosion since the first days of PANZER GENERAL, RITES OF WAR (Q3 '99) brings the playability of PG to the Warhammer universe, and is possibly the strategy sleeper of the year. Now that they've finished with BATTLE OF BRITAIN for TalonSoft, Gary Grigsby and Keith Brors are hard at work on STEEL PANTHERS IV, which likely won't make it this year. The designers and SSI are debating the merits of switching the award-winning sys. tem to simultaneous turns. We'll keep you posted. SSI also managed to entice both SSG, with REACH FOR THE STARS (Q4 '99), and Atomic Games, with CLOSE COMBAT: BATTLE OF THE BULGE Shogun: Total War Tif you long for the days of epic samurai clashes, you should know about EA's SHOGUN: TOTAL WAR, one of the best-looking games we've seen in any genre this year. In addition to a turn-based strategic-level game, SHOGUN sports a sophisticated 3D wargame with elegant controls for formations, and one of the best computer opponents we've yet seen in a real-time game. The depth and breadth of research options are impressive yet still manageable, as you choose whether to go the more traditional Japanese route with spies and Ninja assassins, or forsake history for the Western firearms and trade. Originally scheduled for fall of 1999, SHOGUN will be delayed until early 2000, but for good reason. EA will have a free online gaming service supporting up to eight players per tactical battle. You'll be able to create a custom army and improve its experience and morale as you campaign online. In either solo mode or multiplay, you'll issue orders and designate melee states for your troops, and even queue orders to your veteran units. You'll also be able to erect battlefield defenses and create battle plans before jumping into the 3D tactical combat. We're very excited with the changes and are eagerly awaiting what looks to be a strategy classic in the making. Q1 '00, Electronic Arts, www.ea.com RITES OF WAR The Sims CLOSE COMBAT: BATTLE OF THE BULGE Black & White T he next \"god game\" from Peter Molyneaux, the 1 father of god games, accents the word \"play\" in \"morality play.\" BLACK & WHITE is one of the most ambitious games we've ever seen. Set in an idyllic world of small villages populated by tiny people, gamers play the role of an omnipotent being overseeing the tiny lives below. The goal is to gain power through worship; whether that worship is motivated by love or fear is up to you. Countless moral dilemmas are presented as you play, and depending upon which path you choose, the world will reflect your choices, becoming charred and darkly foreboding or evolving into a fairy tale paradise. Your acting agent in the material realm is an Al-driven entity that becomes the physical manifestation of your ruling philosophy. Nurture and reward this titan and you'll end up with a King Kong version of Mother Theresa; train him through punishment and fear and your henchman will become a terrifying war machine. Using spell powers gained from a growing base of worshippers, you must spread the word of your religion until the whole world is united in praise of the One True God. BLACK & WHITE's multiplayer game could be a godsend. At the outset there will be two multiplayer modes: a kind of chat world where you can upload your existing game creatures and let them mingle, allowing them to learn from other players' creatures, and an eight-player landscape where you play against others in a more traditional contest. Lionhead is planning to follow this up with a gaming world where hundreds can join and play against each other, forming alliances, clans and the like.

It should benefit from a more sophisticated Al and combat resolution techniques used in HPS TIGERS ON THE PROWL 2, though you shouldn't expect this until mid-2000. Decision Games, publisher of Strategy & Tactics magazine, is converting some of its board wargames to the PC, among them Danny Parker's famed BATTLES FOR THE ARDENNES. One of the more unusual titles in the works is Blue Byte's SHADOWPACT (Q4 '99). a strategy game that takes place in realtime yet utterly eschews the trap ou've played god with cities, civilizations, and entire planets. With THE SIMS, you'll finally get the chance to screw with the lives of individuals. Designed by Will Wright, who created the original SIMCITY, THE SIMS lets you take control of a man or woman and guide this Sim-person through life, from simple decisions like when to eat to more elaborate social situations such as making friends or seducing the neighbor. As your sim's life evolves, he or she can marry, move to a bigger house, and spend money littering that home with stuff-the ol' American dream. Go for the traditional nuclear family, having kids and backyard barbe. cues with the neighbors, or do things the Northern California way and turn the house into a commune with multiple adults living in \"alternative\" arrangements. Most intriguing is the capacity to extend the game with downloads. Maxis or third-parties can design add-ons which add new behaviors and activities to your sim world. Very different, very cool.

"Panzer General 3D Assault SHADOWPACT ny time you hear a critic say, \"I don't know why they're doing another sequel to that game. What else can they do with that system?\" you know the poor guy is jaded. Such naysayers will no doubt wallow in self-indulgent whining rather than enjoy the freshness and sheer fun of PANZER GENERAL 3D ASSAULT. The rich 3D environment is more than mere eye candy for the 200+ 3D-modeled vehicles and troops to blitz through; it also allows for dynamic lighting, true line-of-sight, and realistic movement and assaults between attackers and defenders on different terrain elevations. The interface is one of the most elegant we've seen, and both the campaigns and multiplayer options look terrific. The game system has been totally revamped, adding new rules for leaders, air strikes, supply, replacements and the like. Somehow, it's even more accessible than the original...and easily the most gorgeous turn-based game we've ever seen. Q4 '99, SSI, www.ssionline.com HOT LIST Warlords Battlecry pings of your traditional RTS game. In SHADOWPACT, gamers will fight a war against a cabal seeking to subjugate the world under the rule of a band of fallen angels. The war is fought in virtual reality, with gamers recruiting special agents to fight for them. Combat is handled in a system similar to the WARLORDS series, but the real trick to the game will be in selecting the right agents for the right job and deploying them at the right time to counter threats. A robust mul tiplayer package is planned with even more agents available online. Every time we see Pandemic Studio's DARK REIGN 2 (Q3 '99) we're blown G enerally speaking, going from turn-based to real-time with a strategy game is akin to serving asparagus ice cream for dessert. The reason we didn't run screaming from WARLORDS BATTLECRY is that the SSG folks know their way around real-time strategy (RTS) from the CARRIERS AT WAR days. WARLORDS BATTLECRY differs from standard RTS fare in its emphasis on heroes, training and morale. Leaders have a command radius-once outside of that radius, units lose effectiveness. Also, troops don't always fight to the last orc, but may break and run if surprised or outmaneuvered. Resources (gold, metal, stone, and crystals) are collected automatically, which means you can get to the heart of the matter-lots of combat. BATTLECRY features nine different races, each with distinct animation and unique attributes. In addition to the branching solo campaign, there are 10 different victory conditions for solo and multiplay that may be modified, plus a scenario editor. All in all, WARLORDS BATTLECRY offers the usual polish and attention to gameplay that we expect from SSG, but in a \"new\" direction. Q1 '00, SSG/Red Orb Entertainment, www.redorb.com DARK REIGN 2 Theme Park World on't have the time to visit Disneyworld anytime U soon? Who cares? With Bullfrog's THEME PARK WORLD you'll be able to create and manage virtually every facet of your own amusement park, from setting the admission price and quality of balloons to designing the drops, loops, and stomach-churning leaps of your own roller coasters. While a deeply involved business simulation lurks at this game's core, an intuitive interface and beautifully realized, whimsical graphics should make the open-ended play of THEME PARK WORLD accessible to even the most casual gamer. The best part of this game is in the extras. After laying out your park, you can stroll around it from a first-person perspective and ride on any of the rides. But that's the least of it: parks can be uploaded to a THEME PARK WORLD Web site, where gamers will be able to sample the designs of other players and even send postcards to friends from their virtual vacation spots.

"Conquest: Frontier Wars SimMars LSI1 LOH s much as we were looking forward to playing CONQUEST this year, the reasons we're hearing regarding this outer space real-time strat title's delay until mid-2000 are encour. aging. Digital Anvil is using the additional time to overhaul the ships for each of the four different races. One of our early concerns-the similarity of the ship designs-is being addressed. Not only will there be more marked differences between the races, but the ship styles should be easily differentiated through interface cues. The core of the game still relies on large fleet combat, with gamers rewarded for taking the fight to their enemies with salvage after a battle. With its random map generator and the added tactical challenge of acquiring and defending the jump gates linking battlefields, we're really looking forward to multiplayer CONQUEST. Q2 '00, Microsoft, www.digitalanvil.com aid Meier and ALPHA CENTAURI may have beaten them to space, but Will Wright is betting that gamers will want to master a planet a little closer to home, namely Mars. The goal is to build a colony on the Red Planet that can exist with very little to no support from Earth. Gamers will have to terraform the hostile environment in order to create and maintain a network of colonies. The specialized colonies will provide food, shelter, and power as well as conduct research into advanced genetics to accelerate mankind's evolutionary progress. Maxis is working closely with NASA for this real-time title to better understand the realities of space colonization in order to give the plausibility, scientific accuracy, and strategic depth. Fortunately, the game's release isn't quite as far off as an actual Mars landing. Q3 '00, Electronic Arts, www.ea.com Force Commander orget everything you thought you knew about FORCE COMMANDER. When this title reappeared on our radar after a considerable absence, it was as an entirely new game. Gone was the standard RTS top-down perspective to be replaced by a robust 3D engine sporting a nifty free-moving camera. Gamers will get to fight on both sides of a conflict set in the classic Star Wars universe, playing as an Imperial com mander who eventually defects to the Rebel sides. Action will take place almost imme. diately in every mission since LucasArts has tossed out the resource gathering that dominates the early part of most RTS games; instead, players will have to fight in order to accrue \"command points\" that are earned by defeating enemies and achieving mission goals. These points are then used to purchase units to be dropped planet-side. Units and their experience can be carried over from mission to mission or placed \"on leave\" until they're needed again. Q4 '99, LucasArts, www.lucasarts.com Harpoon 4 TT ARPOON was a landmark game because it proved that hard-core wargames could still sell in big numbers. It didn't hurt that designer Larry Bond and Tom Clancy used the game to model the conflicts in their novel Red Storm Rising. HARPOON 4 is based on the latest in the renowned tabletop gaming series, and it offers all of the data with none of the hassle of wading through Bond's exhaustive tables and combat charts. The time period is the height of the Cold War, chosen because it pits the two largest sea forces in history-the United States Navy and the Soviet Navy-against each other in a number of missions and campaigns. The arena is still operational combat, mostly at sea, but with a lot of variety. You might hunt down enemy submarines one mission, then tackle a guided missile cruiser group the next, fol. lowed by an aircraft carrier strike group. HARPOON 4 is also rather attractive and fairly easy to navigate during play considering the game's complexity. Even with its outdated Cold War setting, this one looks promising Q2 '00, SSI, www.ssionline.com away anew.

We really like the game's use of cycling day and night, with units specifically designed to be most effective under cover of night (we'll always welcome a new way to be devious). Activision should be releasing this beauty sometime in the fall. Check out our Preview sec tion for Berkeley System's ORCS: REVENGE OF THE ANCIENT (Q4 '99). Finally, Firaxis has signed on to do the long-awaited CIVILIZATION III for Hasbro, with the game slated for release in late 2000. It's likely that there will be at least one add-on pack for CIV III, as well as a scenario editor. Activision is still planning on publishing an add-on for CIVILIZATION: CALL TO POWER, as well.

"PUZZLES & CLASSICS Creatures 3/ Creatures Adventures TAThen the first CREATURES was released three years ago, it was remarkable: a true artificialVV intelligence product that also happened to be a fun family game. Any rough edges (and there were more than a few) were counterbalanced by the sheer charm of raising your cute little Norn life forms from hatchlings to adults. CREATURES was even better than having a Tamagotchi, because you could turn the blasted thing off and save your little society in progress without worrying about your Noms starving to death. CREATURES 2, on the other hand, was a huge disappointment--too hard, too humorless. So it's nice to see that the CREATURES products planned for later this year are moving back in the direction of the first game. CREATURES 3 has its share of creepy moments at times, it seems like everything in the game has a huge set of teeth. But it also has plenty of cool environments to explore. The game takes place on a starship that is so huge it supports multiple weather zones (sci-fi legend Arthur C. Clarke would be proud), and it's surprisingly enjoyable running over fields of lush vegetation just yards removed from airless space. CREATURES ADVENTURES, on the other hand, is sort of a CREATURES goes Candyland. The usual threats are missing, and you don't spend much time trying to figure out how your Norns (which are now larger and more cuddly) tick. Instead, you romp, explore, and play over a stylized and very friendly environment. But you might look at it like eating a bowl of Frosted Flakes: Who's to know that you don't have a five-year-old in your household? Q4 '99, Mindscape, www.mindscape.com Puzzle Me This International chess master Josh Waltzkin (of Searching for Bobby Fischer fame) has helped the creative team of CHESSMASTER 7000 (Q3 '99) shake the series out of its cre. ative doldrums. This time around, there are Al opponents that a nomal human being can actually defeat (and that also have some personali ty), as well as the top-flight computer routines based on famous human grandmasters that have always been a CHESSMASTER strength. The graphics, tutorials, and online play have been upgraded, and you can supposedly get a rating of your computer-play ability that approximates your overthe board strength. We'll keep our pawn-pushing fingers crossed. Likewise, for RISK II (03 199) Hasbro has beefed up the already solid Al of the orig. inal. The new game plays very briskly, though we're still unsure how well it will work online. The interface was a lot cleaner than you'll find in most board-to-computer conversions-though we miss rolling our own dice. Those who love spatial logic puzzles should check out Microsoft's unassuming and aggressively priced. PANDORA'S BOX (Q3 '99). Finally, if you're too cheap to buy anything, you can still have a good time with Berkeley Systems GET THE PICTURE (out now), a free online game that lets you vote on your friends' captions for pictures, doodies, and the like. It's a lot like PC PICTIONARY but this time, the idea works. You Don't Know Jack Offline Die Tt's always amazed us that the Jellyvision and Berkeley Systems folks could crank out enough material to refresh the YOU DON'T KNOW JACK experience online on a daily basis. OFFLINE is a collection of 800 of the most irreverent questions from the popular YOU DON'T KNOW JACK: THE NETSHOW, plus 200 new satirical questions based on \"Pissed About a Question?\" letters sent by JACK fans. Sometimes Writers Just Have To $2,000 = While this collection is a bit more traditional than the recent YOU DON'T KNOW JACK: THE RIDE, OFFLINE does have better graphics and audio than the online version. It'll have to be enough to keep us #la Jack Attack fans happy, because the oft-rumored YOU DON'T KNOW JACK 5 is at least 12 to 18 months away.

"FLIGHT SIM SUMMER Flight Summer (of '42) The Last of the WWII Sims Are Ready to Take Off, and They're Better Than Ever by Denny Atkin he WWII simulation deluge is nearly over, and it looks like another drought may be in store for prop combat fans. But this last batch of propeller-driven sims looks ready to keep gamers entertained until more sims arrive after the turn of the millennium. From B-17 FLYING FORTRESS II's unprecedented realistic simulation of every station of a lumbering World War II bomber to NATIONS: FIGHTER COMMAND'S you-are-there graphics and sound to FLIGHT COMBAT's kitchen sink of features sure to please even the most hard-core of sim fans, there's plenty of virtual war left for sim fans to fight. #Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe L Could This Be the Definitive WW II Flight Simulation? t's happened to every serious flight sim fan. You boot up a new game only to find a major feature was omitted or botched up. Oh, sure, all the things you'd like to see in a flight sim exist, but they're spread across five different simulations on your shelf. You don't care about the realities of budgets, marketing input, or time-to-market. You just want a sim with the works—with the working worksnot excuses. If FLIGHT COMBAT: THUNDER OVER EUROPE creator Constantine Hantzopoulos has his way, your dream may come true. Talking to Con, you know this game is in the hands of a die-hard simulation fan, one of us. But Con and his team have that rare understanding of how to create a simulation with the depth to satisfy the hardcore and the flash and dazzle to bring in the newbies. From what we've seen of FLIGHT COMBAT so far, Constantine Hanztopoulos is a name you may soon be hearing in the same breath with Larry Holland, Damon Slye, Gilman Louie, and Andy Hollis. (Better learn to spell it.) Such accolades don't come cheap in an industry of me-too products, in a market with over half a dozen new WWII sims. But as I took my first flight in the oddly acronymed FC:TOE, kept barraging Con with questions about fea tures. And the answer to almost every question was a resounding yes. performance in regular missions. While you can't change the outcome of the war, there will be different levels of victory. For instance, if you're flying for the U.S. and you get a major victory, you'll reach Berlin before the Russians, which would have major benefits for postwar Europe. Decent performance may find both companies reaching Berlin at about the same time, while a poor showing may have the Russians taking most of Germany. The campaign choices here look familiar: You can fly in the Battle of Britain or the later battle for Europe. You won't fly as a persistent character; instead, you'll be offered a wide variety of mission types flying different aircraft. Most intriguing are the night-fighter missions, some thing never before fully simulated. As you take off at night over London, searchlights will comb the skies, locking onto enemy aircraft and illuminating them for you. Ground radar controllers will also vector you towards your target. The team is still considering whether to model the airborne radars of the day, they were very primitive and difficult to operate, and thus a simplified version is likely here. During the day, along with the usual escort and intercept missions, you'll also fly such tasks as train-busting, carpet-bombing, illuminating targets for Lancaster Planned Yet Random One significant feature from the hard-core sim player's laundry list that didn't get a yes was a dynamic campaign that generates the war on the fly. But FC:TOE has what some would call an even better solution: a \"semidynamic\" campaign that consists of prescripted, branching missions with a high degree of randomness. This allows the designers to create missions that are historical in nature but unpredictable even upon replay. You'll be able to go off on interesting side missions, depending upon your BOMBER AWAY An Me-163 closes in for the kill on a B-17G. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD SEPTEMBER 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"flight model, similar to the one used by WARBIRDS. With all the options turned on, you'll deal with spins, accelerated stalls, and all the other details of a realistic flight model. The sim features independent engine control, so you could use a dualthrottle to control each engine on a P-38 individually. How detailed is the control? Well, in the Me-163 rocket plane under full realism, you'll have to control the fuel mixture to keep square miles of Europe. The environment promises to be not only realistic but also useful. Clouds aren't just for looks—you'll be able to lose pursuing players by maneuvering in the cloud layers. One of the favorite features of classic WWII sims, the flight recorder, makes an appearance here. But this is far more powerful than the recorders of old. You can edit your combat recordings to add wipes between scenes, drop images and text over the video, and even add your own voiceovers.

"HARDWARE IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE  REVIEWS  KILLER RIGS  NEWS SCOOP nVidia's Next-Gen Chip Could Bring Cut-Scene Quality to Gameplay The Next 3D Revolution Other Goodies In addition to raw horsepower, NV10 will also deliver new DirectX 7.0 3D rendering features, which we'll cover next month. The NV10 will also support HDTV, accelerating X-y video scaling, colorspace conversion, and motion compensation for full 1080i/480p HDTV displays. NV10 will support the AGP 4X standard, effectively doubling the rate at which it can get data from system memory to a speed of 1.1 GB/sec. A 350MHZ RAMDAC will make for higher refresh rates at high resolutions, and nVidia plans to offer the NV10 in two RAM loadouts, 32 and 64MB. NV10 will support SDRAM and SGRAM, and nVidia is considering support for Double Data Rate (DDR) SGRAM if it becomes widely available. s amazing as game graphics have become, they still don't measure up to the stunning animations that kick off most games. Gamers have been dreaming of the day when the gameplay looks as good as the cut-scenes. If nVidia's next chip delivers on its promise, IRON WORKS that day may not be far off. We cornered one of nVidia's lead chip architects and got him talking about nVidia's next chipset, codenamed NV10. He terms this new chip a \"graphics processing unit,\" or GPU for short. nVidia chose this term because the chip, scheduled to ship this fall, has more than twice as many transistors as a Pentium III CPU. In addition to having lots of raw processing power, NV10 will be able to take on a substantial portion of the CPU's workload, resulting in dramatically improved graphics and freeing the CPU to handle other chores like artificial intelligence (AI) processing. nVidia says the main goal of the NV10 is to take on the role of calculating 3D geometry (called transform and lighting, or T&L). In current systems, 3D geometry chores can consume three-quarters of the CPU's time, leaving everything else in a game-controller input, audio, AI, collision detection, and physics, among other factors-to fight over the leftover time. By off-loading geometry calculations from the CPU, the NV10 will let games have radically higher polygon counts, according to nVidia. For example, a typical scene in QUAKE II might have 3,000 polygons. But imagine that same scene with 10 times as many polygons. (Heck, maybe we'll finally see characters with round necks.) OpenGL and Direct 7.0 both support T&L acceleration, so games using those application program interfaces (APIs) should see vastly improved performance. The Difference NV10 Can Make Geplic Lim With NVO Crashe Process Afterburner On There are many speeds and feeds to consider in 3D chip performance, but two of the most important are triangle rate and fill rate. Triangle rate refers to the number of triangles the processor can draw on the screen per second. Fill rate describes the speed at which those triangles can be filled with shading or texture information. Traditionally, 3D chips have concentrated more on fill rate to allow for more filtering and rendering effects, as well as higher resolutions. But NV10's design will also emphasize triangle rate. nVidia reps say that NV10's sustained triangle rate will be about three to five times that of a Pentium III CPU, which can put out about 5 million triangles per second. The NV10 should be no slouch in the fill-rate department, either. nVidia conservatively estimates that NV10 will deliver about twice the fill rate of current generation 3D chips. So what can you do with that much horsepower? How about running your games smoothly at a resolution of 1600x1200x32 with all the rendering goodies turned on? Sound appealing? Yeah, we thought so too. Given the recent S3/Diamond merger, and that nVidia has made public its intent to no longer sell chips to Diamond, we're likely to see NV10-based boards from Creative Labs, Hercules, Guillemot, and several Taiwanese board makers—the same companies that are making TNT2-based boards. TNT2 is also currently a darling among system makers including Falcon Northwest, Dell, Gateway, and Micron, and those companies are going to be giving NV10 a serious look for their fall and holiday season offerings. With NV10's balanced yet aggressive design, nVidia is poised to yet again reshape the 3D graphics landscape this fall when NV10-based boards start shipping. Stay tuned sports fans, because we'll be getting our mits on a reference board soon, and we'll tell you how it fares in next month's issue of CGW.

"UNDER THE HOOD Welcome to the Minefield HARDWARE This Year's Upgrade Paths Are Fraught With Danger affairs is known as \"market segmentation,\" which is how Intel can put the screws to AMD while still charging gobs of money for the Pentium III. SDRAM. So if you're contemplating a 600MHz Pill later this year, be ready for a little financial pain. lanning for future upgrades is a baffling business these days. And if it baffles me, then you should worry. Until the beginning of this year, the upgrade picture was fairly straightforward. If you had the budget, you'd get some kind of 440BX motherboard. You might have to live with a Celeron CPU but you could anticipate Pentium Ill prices dropping later in the year. Users of Intel competitor AMD's K6-2 microprocessors could look forward to the K6-3. Recently, though, the picture has become more complicatedridiculously so, in my opinion. introduced the SECC (single-edge contact cartridge)—also called Slot 1-format for CPUs. This allowed Intel to package a CPU with somewhat slower-speed Level 2 (L2) cache in a cost-effective manner. But the low-cost Celeron CPU has all its L2 cache on the CPU die itself, making the cartridge format superfluous. So Socket 370 was born-a more Distant Memories It's likely that these faster, socketed Pentium Ills will require a new motherboard and chipset, code-named Camino and dubbed the Intel 820. The 820 creates yet another puzzle for users: choosing memory upgrades. The good news is that Camino will support a front-side bus of 133MHz-about 33 percent faster than current Pentium III memory bus speeds and will yield a peak throughput of 1GB/sec. The bad news is that Intel is trying to push a completely new memory type: RDRAM (RAMBUS DRAM). RDRAM memory On the AMD Front Things aren't so rosy for AMD customers, either. Many K6-2 users, anticipating an easy upgrade to the K6-3, received a couple of rude shocks when the K6-3 shipped. First, a number of K6-2-capable motherboards couldn't handle the odd voltages of the K6-3. Then there's the K7. There's a lot of excitement about the potential of the K7. But the K7 plugs into AMD's \"Slot A.\" derived from the DEC/Compaq Alpha CPU'S EV6 bus. Naturally, it's not compatible with anything except K7, meaning that AMD fans will finally get to step away from the ancient Socket 7 format, but at LOYD CASE Cutting Corners As the demand for cheap PCs gets more intense, so does the pressure to drive down costs. One resultant abomination was the Cyrix Media GX processor, which coupled a really slow CPU with really slow graphics. The good news for gamers is that Cyrix/National Semiconductor will be getting out of the market for PC processors. The bad news is the Intel 810. There are several flavors of the 810, and you should avoid them all. The reason is that Intel has built the graphics controller into the motherboard chipset itself. This setup may be fine for someone running Word or doing some light Web browsing, but 3D game performance will be abysmal compared to what's possible with the current generation of 3D accelerators. ...which is how Intel can put the screws to AMD while still charging gobs of money... modules will be called RIMMS the cost of new memory and cost-effective design that accom RAMBUS inline memory modules. incompatibility with any Intel CPU. modates the newer Celerons' Like all new memory introducK7 motherboards will likely suponboard L2 cache.

"PERFORMANCE PC SYSTEMS HYPERSONIC WHAT 3D CARD SHOULD I BUY? You've got questions, we've got answers. And if there's one question readers have asked us more than any other, \"What 3D card should I buy?\" would have to be it. Look for this how-to-choose-a-3D-card guide every month here in CGW. Choosing the right 3D card depends on your CPU and your motherboard. So we have two recommendations for you: HARDWARE Choice A If your CPU is a Pentium 233MHz or slower, or your motherboard is all-PCI (no AGP), or you've got a motherboard-down AGP graphics chip with no AGP slot, then get 3dfx's Voodoo? 1000 board. At about $100, it will do a very good job with current games and a pretty good job with games coming out soon. And the best part is, when you swap in a new motherboard/CPU, you can migrate the Voodoo board to the new setup. Choice B If your ria's motherboard has an AGP slot, then go with Hercules' Dynamite TNT2, which is currently the fastest 3D gun in the West. At a street price of about $180 for the 32MB version, this card is actually quite a deal. Even if you're running a Pentium 11/233 or 266MHz CPU, when you upgrade your motherboard/CPU, you can migrate the card into your new setup, and it's got room to grow with whatever CPU you mate it with. PRODUCT WATCH Look Out Intel? At press time, the most interesting product about to ship is without question AMD's K7 CPU, which they've rechristened Athlon. If the performance rumors we've heard about this new chip are true, then the CPU market could be a whole new ball game, with Intel finally facing serious competition in every market segment, top to bottom. AMD has traditionally lagged behind Intel in a key area for gamers: X87 floating-point performance, which can make all the difference in 3D games. But AMD's Athlon chip has a superscalar (able to execute more than one instruction per clock) floating point unit with three pipelines, which may well finally give them the performance edge over Pentium III in this key area. So who'll be the last chip standing?

"MICRON TRANSPORT NX LAPTOP. REVIEW Goin' Mobile Micron Delivers A Solid Mobile Offering, But with a Few Gotchas HARDWARE GAMING TEST RESULTS by Dave Salvator aptops have come a long way. For this they owe a lot to ATI and the Rage LT chipset, which finally brought good 3D graphics performance to the mobile set. Dell and Compaq have been shipping Rage LT-equipped laptops for a while now, and Micron is the latest to join this club with their Transport Trek NX. Laptops have always lagged their desktop brethren in graphics performance, and the 3D revolution only compounded the problem. And while the Rage LT chipset does a good job with 3D chores and deserves praise for what it has done for the 3Dchallenged mobile graphics chipset market, it's now looking long in the tooth. In fact, the latest round of desktop graphics cards we tested here were three times faster on average than the Rage LT chipset in the Transport. Still, some better 3D is better than no 3D, and as long as you keep the resolution down around 640x480, the Rage LT fares pretty well, although its OpenGL ICD driver still has some very rough spots, including some serious drawing errors in HALF-LIFE.

"REVIEW  EVERGLIDE MOUSE PAD Smooth Operator COMPUTER GAMING * * * ** WORLD HARDWARE EVERGUIDE 1 ard-core shooter guys will do anything to get that extra frag-dialing graphics way down for better Il frame-rate, trying different mice, hooking up to USB, running the PS2 Rate utility, using a bowling wrist support (OK, maybe not). If you count yourself among these zealots, then say hello to your next purchase, the EverGlide mouse pad. Made of high-density plastic, the EverGlide features a slightly rough surface to allow even tracking of your mouse's ball. This makes it easy to execute minute, precise mouse movements-the key to accurate aim when camping. Using my PS/2-connected Logitech Mouse Man Wheel, and running the PS2 Rate utility at 200Hz, I took the EverGlide for a spin through HALF-LIFE TEAM FORTRESS CLASSIC, STARSEIGE TRIBES, and QUAKE 3 TEST. The overall result was very impressive. Because the EverGlide surface is consistent across the entire pad, the mouse ball never stopped tracking. And for the occasional camp-out with the crossbow in HALF-LIFE, lining up the money shot was easy thanks to the precise mouse movement possible with this PROS: Rough surface allows for precise mouse movement CONS: It would look cooler in black (and hide grime better). REQUIREMENTS: A horizontal surface. Price: 517 (Web direct) Manufacturer: Blooming Tree Productions pad. And general mousing with the www.everglide.com EverGlide in Windows 98 was smoother, too. So if you're an avid camper in shooters, the EverGlide is something you'll definitely want. But even if you're just looking for a way to smooth out your shooter gameplay, the EverGlide's surface, along with a good mouse, will get you most of the way there. Of course, you'll still have to do the aiming and shooting yourself. Dave Salvator REVIEW KENWOOD 52X TRUEX CD-ROM DRIVE Fast, but Not Cheap COMPUTER GAMING **** WORLD The X-factor is getting out of hand. Here we have what is probably one of the fastest CD-ROM drives you can get. It's the Kenwood 52X TrueX, the latest drive using Zen Research's technology for reading multiple CD tracks at a time. But the question remains: So what? That may sound odd coming from me, but as fast as the Kenwood is, it's not that much faster than other drives-and it has some problems. Beyond that, it's a bit on the pricey side. The drive scored a 1410 on CD WinBench 99, with an access time of 91.8ms and an acceptably low CPU utilization of 3.27 percent. A full, 2.4GB installation of BALDUR'S GATE seemed to cruise by relatively quickly, too. Then things got a little ugly. I tried installing some beta software I had on recordable (CD-R) media, and the Kenwood choked. I'd run into this with the Kenwood 40x40 drive, too, but hoped it had been fixed in this iteration of the drive. Apparently not. Overall, though, the TrueX drive is well mannered. There's very little of PROS: It's really fast. CONS: A bit pricey, doesn't like some CD-R media. REQUIREMENTS: ATAPI interface. Price: $125 that annoying vibration that you get Manufacturer: Kenwood Technologies with some high-speed drives. It also seems more solid than the 40x40 www.kenwoodtech.com which had some teething problems. If you don't use recordable CDs, the Kenwood should serve admirably. But if you routinely use CD-R media, you may want to pass on it. Loyd Case REVIEW FLIGHT SIM YOKE LE FOR USB Get the Yoke? COMPUTER GAMING ***** WORLD Sym ror civilian flight sims, having a yoke controller adds that extra bit of rrealism you don't get with a stick. Now, CH Products has delivered the Flight Sim Yoke LE for USB, a hot-pluggable controller that works with both the PC and Macintosh. This revamped version of CH's yoke device-it's also lighter and more compact than the original design-is a good, low-end, entry-level controller for sim fans. Installation is really plug-and-play; the device uses the USB driver built into Win 98, eliminating the hassle of using a flight yoke on a system that already has a joystick or gamepad. The all-black design features an eight-direction view hat, three buttons, two toggle switches for gear and flaps, two rocker/trim switches, and a throttle lever. It attaches firmly to your desk with two screw clamps. CH touts the lack of a detent on the wheel for better control. However, the controller has a very loose feel, and I found it difficult at times to find the center for straight-and-level flight. Also, be warned that getting it to work with analog rudder pedals requires a game that can simultaneously handle input from multiple controllers. Microsoft FLIGHT SIM 98 should in PROS: Easy setup, good selection of buttons CONS: Loose feel, USB rudder pedals theory support multiple controllers, not yet available but the game wouldn't allow me to REQUIREMENTS: Win98 system with USB; Mac with OS 8.1 or above select the analog rudders. CH will be Price: $109 releasing compatible USB pedals in Publisher: CH Products late summer Finally, be careful when shopping www.chproducts.com for this yoke. There are two versions, and CH's box pictures the Flight Sim Yoke, which has additional buttons and two levers for propeller pitch and mixture.

"DESCENT 3  REVIEW Fantastic Facelift ACTION Graphics and Gameplay Make DESCENT 3 the Best of the Series to use everything from the tried and true Vauss Cannon to an exceptionally cool Microwave Cannon that distorts the screen of your opponent as you fry him. One of my favorites was the Cyclone Missile, which splits itself into six smaller missiles that hone in on your target. by Jim Lynch ar too often, drastic overhauls are a bad idea. New Coke, Baywatch Nights and a Bea Arthur facelift are all testaments to the nightmares that can result when mankind messes with God's work. After two hot games, the makers of the DESCENT franchise took an incredible risk by overhauling their game. But unlike a post-operative, Kabukivisaged Bea Arthur, this reworking really pays off. Right from the five-minute opening movie, you know that you're in for a visual treat. This year's DESCENT takes full advantage of everything 3D acceleration has to offer, with fluid, crystal clear graphics that never overshadow gameplay-no mean feat considering the impressive lighting effects and enemy robots with distinct moving parts. Everything looks crisp and feels just right, right down to the explosions. DESCENT 3 comes with what can only be described as kick-ass weaponry. You'll get the chance The Great Outdoors Forget the sterile feel of the mines from the earlier games. This time around you'll be immersed in a variety of beautifully textured environments and will even take the fight outdoors as you soar across sweeping planetscapes and through towering canyons. DESCENT 3's engine GOT A LIGHT? The flaming aftermath of a napalm bomb really shows off the game's brilliant explosions. CHAPTER 1 friends appear from the previous games as well: The difficulty of controlling your craft in the game's 360 degrees of movement, and the nausea that some gamers experience while negotiating the spinning, twisting gameworld. To control your craft, use a joystick and take the time to run the game's tutorial. To control your lunch, take occasional player you can choose your favorite ship right away. As one of the first action games to be really viable over the Net, you'd expect DESCENT 3 to have some killer multiplayer action. Net players won't be disappointed; DESCENT 3 includes options for Capture the Flag, Team Anarchy, Robo-Anarchy. Entropy and more. The action in multiplayer is fast and furious so if you're a newbie to DESCENT, you're best off using the Magnum-you'll stay alive just a little while longer while you learn the ropes. DESCENT 3 is simply one of the most solid action games out there, with superb visuals and silky smooth gameplay. Once you get used to the freedom of movement, expect addiction. CGW COMPUTER GAMING WORLD * * * * * IN YOUR BRIEFS Focusing the single player game on objectives detailed in mission briefings is a significant improvement on the repetitive gameplay of earlier DESCENT games. breaks.

Moving outdoors only underscores the sprawling nature of the game's 17 levels. And DESCENT 3 needs the room since the mission-based gameplay has moved beyond the \"find the reactor, destroy it, and run away\" formula of the previous games. This time you'll rescue hostages, retrieve computer data, and hold off enemies assaulting a base. Having said that, Outrage has included one \"blow the reactor and run like hell\" scenario, as well as a caved-in version of DESCENT's first level for veterans like myself. A couple of less-welcome old Smarter Than the Average Bot The robotic enemies in DESCENT 3 have also benefited from the facelift and are even craftier than in previous games. At times they're downright cunning, working in teams and using the environment to their advantage. To combat these nasty little suckers, DESCENT 3 gives you the option of flying three different ships: the fast, agile Phoenix; the slower, more heavily shielded and armed Magnum; or the well-balanced Pyro. In solo play you have to progress through the game to get the other ships, but in multiFREESPACE The most obvious improvement to the Descent series is the ability to leave the cramped confines of mining tunnels for the wide-open spaces. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

But HEAVY GEAR CATUTUR was a disapGAMING pointment, a WORLD EDITORS CHOICE RRERA half-baked game. Now Activision has redeemed itself. HEAVY GEAR 11 does right almost everything that MECHWARRIOR 3 does wrong. While HEAVY GEAR II has a different scope than the MECH games-think powered armor suits rather than hulking battle tanks with feet-this game is still the clear choice for fans of this genre.

When finally got my hands on the final game code I booted it up, and it looked amazing. I launched headlong into the campaign ... and haven't been able to get the bitter taste out of my mouth since. Everything you've heard about the interface, graphics, and physics models is true. They're amazing.

It's a pleasure from the main menu all the way to the cockpit. ing experiences you'll ever have. The Mechs are a blast to drive, and if this game's aim was to be nothing more than the FLIGHT UNLIMITED of Mech games, I'd have to give it five stars. In fact, in multiplayer games against human pilots, this engine just plain rocks. The campaign certainly sounds promising.

"Special Advertising Section TM  semena From the Creators of Gangsters: Organized Crime We recently had the pleasure of meeting Steve Goss, of Hothouse. Steve is the designer and producer of Abomination: The Nemesis Project. We asked Steve a few questions about his latest project; responsible for monitoring the city, defending objectives, and dispatching the squads of survivors to fight the war. The tactical play works in both Real and Pause Time (like Baldurs Gate) modes. The player has to complete a wide range of mission objectives including cap busting combat scenarios, snatch and grabs, surveillance and specimen capture. There are over 60 unique objectives and 20 secondary objectives. Each time you play, the game generates unique combinations of mission sites, objectives, and enemy concentrations. Indeed missions can occur during the day, at dawn, dusk and in the dead of night. Missions are set in over 40 different terrain types, each exemplifying differing tactical challenges. There are 7 ways to play ABOMINATION as a multiplayer game. Firstly, there is a campaign mode where 4 players can journey through the entire gamejoining and leaving as and when they like. New players can join the group when others are unavailable to play. The team size can fluctuate too. It's a rather large game and we wanted to make multiplayer very accessible. What kind of game is Abomination? ABOMINATION is a team based Strategic and Tactical Combat game, set in a 3D Isometric world. The player takes control of a group of survivors, after America has been all but destroyed by a catastrophic plague. The team is built around a Black Ops unit called, PROJECT NEMESIS, eight genetically enhanced operators whose unique abilities give the group their edge in a war against the vilest evil to ever slither across the surface of the planet.

"Special Advertising Section my mind and the works of David Cronenberg the new flesh have heavily influenced my characterizations and creations. There is a lot of pretty horrific activities being perpetrated by your enemy in the game and in many instances you get to find out exactly what and how the Brood is doing things in explicit detail. Can you 'develop your team members? The team members each have a number of abilities; accuracy, health, stealth, reaction and special skills. As the game progresses you can invest combat experience to alter their ratings in these areas. Project Nemesis characters have superhuman skills abilities beyond those of normal men and women. Ultimately the player has to deal with an ever escalating conflict. They need to monitor the enemy and strike at key conflict points fighting in the streets, the sewers or the concrete jungle. As the game progresses, the enemies change. Somewhere, new monstrosities are breeding. Players must seek out the breeding grounds and neutralize them. What was your inspiration for creating Abomination? Well, my experiences as part of the team on the X-COM products whilst I worked at Microprose have some bearing on my work now. As a senior designer at Microprose had the opportunity to design the sequel to UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN/X-COM: EARTH DEFENSE. The result was TERROR FROM THE DEEP. I then became the producer for XCOM: APOCALYPSE and worked with Mythos on the production of that game. I see the genre of Squad level games as one that is very much unexplored, unlike say, 1st person shooters or RTS games in the mold of C&C. I was given a blank slate at Hothouse to begin a new game. I decided to work within this genre squad based tactical games like X-COM and SYNDICATE. This is a deep game. The environments are as detailed as your control over your squad. Unlike some games, Abomination: The Nemesis Project offers a comprehensive strategic elementone where research, resource For example, the ability to become invisible, the ability to heal ones self and others, and the ability to withstand normal weapons fire. Team members that you find during the game, survivors of the plague, have special skills with different weapons; handguns, support weapons, explosives etc... They receive bonuses in combat for using the appropriate weapons. The nature of the world in ABOMINATION is a product of my interest in the works of H.P. Lovecraft. The stories of the Cthulhu mythos are always festering at the back of After each mission, the player can apportion the experience the TEAM has gained amongst its members. Enhancing their skills in any way they see fit. They can tailor the team to their style of play. I, for instance, favor a stealthy group and focus on that skill. Whereas Stuart one of the guys on the project ramps up their health and plays much more aggressively as a result. management, and team management offer a full level of strategic play value. Tell us about the multiplayer game? There are 7 ways to play ABOMINATION as a multiplayer game. Firstly, there is a campaign mode where 4 players can journey through the entire game joining and leaving as and when they like. "


"Special Advertising Section New players can join the group when others are unavailable to play. The team size can fluctuate too. It's a rather large game and we wanted to make multiplayer very accessible. competitions where up to 8 players can play simultaneously; Arena, Survive, Capture the Flag, Lone Runner and Hold & Destroy. These games offer a wide variety of play possibilities in both normal game areas and custom designed multiplayer maps. DAG Indeed, the campaign game can even be played by email! A 100K file is generated by the first player which contains all the strategic information, characters, equipment etc, and a replay of the last mission played. When the next player receives the email file You mentioned email functionality. What else can you do via email? You can send your city key code (12 digit number) or mission key code (12 digit number) to anyone to so they can play either the same game or same level as you rather than the generated missions. You can also send a mission replay (these are generated and appended to your mission debriefings for later watching), to someone else. They can watch your play, or interrupt it and take control and redo the mission. They can even send the replay back to you once they have done it right\"..... long game you are only gonna play about 300 missions there are a lot of missions you will only get if you replay the game. We even have some areas that do not occur in every game. The reasoning behind a generated structure is core to the game itself. The game does not progress by the player playing mission one then mission two ad infinitum. Rather, the player chooses which missions they want to take, at what time of day and in what areas. and executes it. ABOMINATION will boot up and begin to replay the last mission. The player can even halt the action and take over the situation if they think they can do better! After the player reviews the replay and the strategic situation, they can re-equip the characters and complete the next mission. Then they email the 3rd player. This system allows unlimited players to participate, and also appends the name and email address of What have you done to maximize the replay value? The whole game operates around a system of generated elements. The city you fight in is generated. Even the position and layout of strategic elements such as your HQ. Forward Command Posts, labs, and Satellite uplink are never the same. The streets and districts are never in the same place. From this, the land use is generated: downtown, the slums, the 'burbs, industrial facilities and more. Each of these areas forms a mission site with over 1500 possible activity sites and over 100 city every player to have played the game... layouts. Each land type is generated when a mission is actioned there. There are 30 different maps for each land type, of which there are over 32 types. Each mission can have one of 60 different primary and secondary objectives. We estimate that there are somewhere in excess of 1.2 million valid and playable missions the system can generate. Given that even in the The enemy AI pursues its own course and the interaction of all these elements is what makes ABOMINATION organic, non-linear and rewarding to play. The game also supports five multiplayer games team "


"Special Advertising Section Ctthroats TM Terror on the High Seas We asked Rob Davies, Project Leader of the leader Cutthroats: Terror on the High Seas to give us the low-down. This is what he had to say: What was the inspiration behind Cutthroats: Terror on the High Seas? The whole idea of a free roaming, do what you please, lawless pirate is powerful. The life and times in the 17th century Caribbean is a fascinating. unique, 'great-for-gameplay' historical era. Hollywood has decided to portray pirates as fictional, comical villains with wooden legs and hooks. Our pirates are dirty, flea bitten scoundrels that will slit your throat for looking at them the wrong way. Captain Hook may have lived in nevernever land, but Blackbeard grew up in Bristol. He set out to terrorize the sea from the Bristol docks, not a hundred yards from Hothouse's offices. Local inspiration plays a big part in the spirit of this game. Secondly, we wanted to produce a game-world that is living, dynamic, and reactive, based on tons of historic research and including features such as real-time multiple ship/fleet combat, real-time hitand-run land battles and a consistent economic and NPC strategic models. The personal motivation also goes way back to working at Firebird and playing months of Elite, and then joining MicroProse and playing months of Sid Meier's Pirates. Both, classic games based around the 'ABCDE' of gaming (adventure/battle/ conquest/diplomacy/economics). "

Cash, however, is not the only thing used to calculate your ranking; fame, ships captured, ships sunk, towns attacked, towns captured and sacked count as well.

When ships sink during battles you see men and cargo floating, which you can pick through as you see fit. We've tried to give the game a realistic feel, but this isn't a naval simulation. The basic structure of combat is point-and-click: you can change your ship's route with a mouse click In land battles your men have four different weapon types (gunpowder, pistols, muskets What is the player's goal in Cutthroats? How do they accomplish this goal? You are the leader of a band of pirates, and you must gain wealth and success on the high seas through any means necessary. Your main objective is to obtain a hoard of money to divide among your pirate band. Money can be obtained in four ways:  Raiding towns and robbing buildings  Looting and capturing ships  Performing missions  Engaging in trade You have many other short and medium term goals which will help you achieve this objective, including:  Purchasing or capturing additional ships for your fleet, and finding the men to run them.  Acquiring weapons to make your fleet more formidable in battle. Obtaining the ammunition, food and rum necessary for the day to day running of a pirate fleet. Developing a reputation, so that you are feared and respected throughout the Caribbean  Establishing friendly relations with one or more town governors From time to time, you must split the proceeds of your ventures with your crew. If each man's share amounts to a 1,000 pieces of eight, the voyage is a success. After a successful voyage, you choose to have at it again, or retire to live the life of an aristocrat.

You land at the beach and have to fight your way into buildings, loot them and get the booty back to your ship.

There are lots of special orders you can also issue change ammunition type, or aim only at the sails to cripple your opponent. Cutthroats has multiship combat (up to twelve per side) and you can decide how each ship is configured with men, guns cargo and so on. You can configure your fleet to have aggressive warships and slower moving cargo carriers. Each ship will have a specific role in your fleet. You can give your ships orders to grapple and board the enemy, launch row boats, abandon ship, create fire ships and a whole lot of other stuff. When you board and capture a ship you can loot it during battle (and then escape) or capture it and add it to your side during battle by sending over crew, or capture it and hold it to pillage at UHARBRE Capture towns and create a new safe haven for pirates.

If you went to Havana today you can follow the old city wall and it has the same shape as the one in the game; the castle is in the right place; the docks are in the right place. The economy of the towns also reflects their size, wealth, imports and exports during this period. Towns will grow or shrink as time moves on. If you sack a town it may struggle for years to return to the size and economic prosperity that you first discovered it in, or it may just cease to exist all together.

There are 30 building types (from street houses, the Treasury, taverns and warehouses), and once your brigands get the goods, They have to fight their way back to the ship! You have stated that the Cutthroats game world is dynamic and evolving. How will this effect the game play experience? As an example, ports and ships become increasingly hostile to the player as the game proceeds: if you attack French ships, then you'll find that more and more French ships You can fly the flag of any nation to trick ships into thinking you are a friendly vessel. This tactic will only work for a short time, before sailors stop falling for your deception. As you become more famous, the trick becomes less and less likely to work. \"That's no Spanish trader, that's the famous Black Hawk pirate ship...\" There's a certain element of bluff in being a good a pirate. If you run up the Jolly Roger, maybe the enemy will be so scared that they'll surrender on the spot; or they could turn and run and you'll loose your quarry. And, just to make things even more exciting, you can have ship and troop combat happening simultaneously! How historically accurate is Cutthroats? We've picked the period 1625-1725, which is sometimes called the Golden Age of Piracy. (Henry Morgan, greatest of the buccaneers sacked Panama in 1668; Blackbeard's reign of terror was 1716-18; Bartholomew Roberts, last of the great pirates, died in 1722.) The big political events follow the established historical timeline: Spain dominates the Caribbean at the beginning of the time period, but is gradually eclipsed by the end; and \"off stage\" events like the English Civil War happen when they are supposed to. But the player will be able to interfere with the historical flow of events-he might kill the historical governor of Jamaica and install one of his own men in his place, changing history forever. While in port you will interact with governors and local leaders. The attitude that you display toward each governor will range from diplomatic and friendly, to threatening and vicious. As a result, you can be given missions which involve you in storylines and sub-plots of various kinds, or start an open feud with the governor that will lead to either your capture and trial, or his death at your hands. If you are on good terms with a governor and his government you may be offered a Letter of Marque. A Letter of Marque is a legal license to attack ships of another nation that your country is at war with. Up to 24 ships can be engaged in real-time combat at the same time. The towns are based on historical maps and other written accounts, altered where necessary to make for good game play. For example, Havana is built at the mouth to a huge natural harbour. On one bank is the and French ports will treat you like an enemy. Information about your activities are carried around the world by the ship's themselves: if you commit an atrocity at one end of the Caribbean and sail to other end, there is a good chance that news of your nefarious deeds won't have reached them. Similarly, if you persistently let ships escape, then your enemies will be able to pin point your location and try to destroy you. If you choose a particular area as your hunting ground, then coastal guard ships are likely to reinforce it. If you sack a town which is a big sugar producer, then the supply of sugar in the rest of the world is reduced, and the price of sugar goes up. As your understanding of the game world grows, you will be able to develop increasingly sophisticated strategies. What is your favorite part of the game? The really cool thing is the way your reputation spreads around the game world, so that other people change their opinion of you as time goes on. If you attack Spanish ships, other Spanish ships can hear of your actions (but only if the ships you attack escape) and will change their attitude towards you. Powerful fleets, warships, town guard ships and pirate hunters will be more likely to attack you. But weaker ones may run away as soon as they recognize you, making it more difficult to catch easy prey. The reaction of the world to your playing style and reputation adds a whole new level of depth that I really enjoy. How much interaction will there be with NPC's? The whole game is based around your interaction with other characters.

The first hit will produce variable damage (elevator damage, fuel leaks, and so on), but take a second shot and it's ejection time. Speaking of weaponry, F-22 LIGHTNING 3 allows you to drop tactical nuclear weapons. Beyond requiring authorization to employ, you use it like any other bomb, except that you don't have to worry very much about your aim, Cleared for Takeoff F-22 LIGHTNING 3 puts you into a combat environment that's full of activity, with numerous enemy and friendly sorties, ground and sea operations, and a headset full of relevant radio chatter. Coordinated allied flight missions prevent the dreaded \"you against the world\" syndrome. The More, the Merrier F-22 LIGHTNING 3 excels in multiplayer. One click and you're on Novaworld, Novalogic's server that allows up to 128 players to fly in the same airspace. Novaworld features something for everyone, from guns-only freefor-alls to squadron-based cooperative missions. Also notable is Voice-Over-Net, a feature that lets you speak with other online THE NUCLEAR OPTION You'll be called upon to use tactical nuclear weapons to take out the enemy's weapons of mass destruction. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  You'll perform your aerial heroics in six linear campaigns, situated in locations such as Syria, Indonesia, and the Kola Peninsula. Missions within the campaigns are a mix of ground and air attacks and escorts. While they increase in difficulty as you progress through the campaigns, the similarities do eventually produce a \"been there, done that\" feeling. ESCORT DUTY Keeping lumbering transports alive long enough to reach their destination is no easy task. 6 SHOTGUN PROS: Simple to learn, simple to fly: Novaworld makes multiplayer easy for novices, built-in multiplayer voice communications LIGNTNING CONS: Limited variety of weapons; only slightly improved over Novalogic's previous efforts. DIFFICULTY: Easy REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 200, 32MB RAM, 220MB hard drive space. 3D SUPPORT: Direct3D, 3dfx Glide MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: LAN, Internet (2-16 players): Novaworld (up to 128 players). Price: $34.95 Publisher. Novalogic www.novalogic.com options display some interesting design decisions: Other than HARM missiles, there are no standoff air-to-ground guided missiles, resulting in your having to fly directly over any ground target (and its antiair defenses!) to attack it. On the air-to-air front, your players. It worked as advertised, although you can only speak to one person at a time. In a nutshell, although F-22 LIGHTNING 3 is an incremental improvement over its predecessors, if you're a casual gamer looking for a fun flight sim, it's a good choice. And if you're a hardcore simmer looking for a quick, fun break-well, we won't tell.

"REVIEW  MIDTOWN MADNESS SPORTSTRACING Got Dem Road-Rage Blues Chicago Lives and You Get to Drive It in MIDTOWN MADNESS 17177177277 by Gordon Goble hey're mad, mad, I tell you! Indeed, Microsoft has had the MADNESS for nearly three years now. It started in 1996 with MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS and then moved on to motorcycles for last year's memorable MOTOCROSS MADNESS. This summer, Microsoft has gone bonkers for inner-city driving, enlisting the talents of developer Angel Studios (Nintendo 64's MLB, FEATURING KEN GRIFFEY JR.) to produce surely the greatest MADNESS of all. How does driving a city bus through a downtown rush hour grab ya? Not too exciting? Okay, what if you could accelerate past 100 miles per hour and slam your way through traffic, tossing aside sedans and minivans, lampposts, and park benches like a berserk TRex as horrified commuters shriek? And what if that cityscape was a 3D view of downtown Chicago, complete with semiintelligent traffic, working stoplights, and a bunch of take-noMIDTOWN vehicle, depending on its relative bulk and durability, will take an incredible amount of punishment before firing its last piston. And sadly, progressive damage affects only the look, not the performance, of the car. Nevertheless, the game is nothing if not totally addictive and fun. You'll be kept busy reading maps, gauging distances, monitoring opponents' whereabouts, and often charting your own sneaky course to the finish line. Particularly impressive are the game's high-speed freeways, where learning how to drive fast while leaving big wreckage behind for the other guys is a game unto itself. And the competition only gets faster and smarter the further you go, with interesting new circuits and vehicles introduced along the way. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION GONE BAD In MIDTOWN MADNESS, the fastest vehicle isn't necessarily the best vehicle, as proven by this car-killing bus and freshly overturned Panoz. prisoners Al racers trying to do the same thing you are? Sound like fun? I thought it might. In MIDTOWN MADNESS, Microsoft has released a racing game that offers substance, variety, and an unparalleled sense of freedom. Got something against bus drivers? Well then, take a Mustang, a Cadillac, or a speedy but brittle Panoz roadster for a spin instead. Be careful, though, this MADNESS calls for certain strategies that vary with the type of race selected, the course, and the environmental conditionsmeaning the fastest vehicle isn't always the best vehicle. lots to swank indoor malls, from treed parkland to construction zones. And yes, CARMAGEDDON fans, pedestrians abound, though they always manage to miraculously dive from the path of your marauding vehicle at the last possible second. Wanna bet Microsoft bandied that one about before release? Also a bit less than authentic is MIDTOWN driving. Certainly. each of the 10 vehicles has variDa Verdict MIDTOWN MADNESS would have been well served by a between-race fix-it shop and a true \"season\" mode with cumulative points. Personal gripes also include a race selection interface that forces players to choose a COMPUTER WORLD GAMNG **** PROS: Racing MIDTOWN variety, unparalleled sense of driving freedom wonderful recreation of downtown Chicago CONS: Some interface design flaws, big-time system requirements, less-thanauthentic damage modeling, no true \"season\" mode. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166, 32MB RAM, 300MB hard drive space. 3D SUPPORT: Direct3D. MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: Modem (2 players), LAN, Internet (2-8 players): 1 CD per player ESRB RATING: E, animated violence. Price: $39.95 Publisher: Microsoft www.microsoft.com/games Da Gameplay You can choose to race in the sunshine, under the veil of darkness, or through an all-too-typical Chicago snowstorm (where MIDTOWN's brilliant depiction of slippery handling is showcased). Or you can opt for the calmer confines of a Circuit Race, where barricades separate racers from commuter traffic, police cruisers, and other minor annoyances. Heck, you're even allowed to cruise Chi-Town without competition-a great time to drink in the startlingly realistic environment. And if you're thinking this is street racing only, you're sadly mistaken. MIDTOWN is positively peppered with intriguing shortcuts, from underground parking SOMEONE CALL A BODY SHOP! Against a stormy Chicago sky. a quartet of Mustang fastback drivers let their aggression get the best of them. ous attributes that distinguish it from the others, and each is enjoyably proficient in terms of speed and handling. But in real life you can't jump a car over a raised bridge at 120 mph and expect to survive, nor can you crash head-on and emerge with a running engine. Yet a typical vehicle before viewing a map of the upcoming course, and a vehicle selection menu that doesn't allow on-screen comparisons.

"TOTAL ANNIHILATION: KINGDOMS REVIEW Kingdom Come TOTAL ANNIHILATION Gets a Fantasy Make-Over STRATEGYZWAR by Thierry Nguyen wo dead guys and a B movie helped me through TOTAL ANNIHILATION: KINGDOMS. Napoleon's flanking cavalry maneuvers served me well, espe. cially when combined with Sun Tzu's wise words about terrain (\"Those skilled in defense hide in the deepest depths of the earth; those skilled in attack maneuver in the highest heights of the sky\"). But sometimes-particularly with a huge army of undead advancing toward my castlehad to get a little more modern. Here I found myself relying on Bruce Campbell's eloquent line from the flick Army of Darkness for motivation. \"This is my boomstick,\" I would cry, and let fly with muskets and cannons upon the rotting hordes. Part cerebral, part brawl, TA: KINGDOMS carries on the fine real-time-strategy tradition Cavedog started two years ago. 7167000 Magical, Not Mechanical TA: KINGDOMS is essentially the fantasy version of TOTAL ANNIHILATION. While the original game focused on a vague and uninteresting war between two robot factions, TA: KINGDOMS goes for a high-fantasy angle with a touch of King Lear. A powerful king divides his realm among his four children, then he promptly disappears. A few hundred years later, the four children have split into two camps: one that emphasizes technology, the other relying on magic. One faction initiates an invasion, and the battle begins. Cavedog developers should be commended for creating a much more interesting campaign than that of the original TOTAL ANNIHILATION.

"REVIEW  STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION BIRTH OF THE FEDERATION Infrastructure: The Final Frontier STRATEGYZWAR Strategy Supreme—for Trekkers, at Least by Keith Ferrell ust how does the Federation work? What holds the Klingon Empire together? What are the Cardassians' goals, or the Romulans'? What motivates the Ferengi? Well, we know what motivates the Ferengi. The economic underpinnings and infrastructure of the Star Trek universe have received relatively short shrift in the television series and in the movies, although, unlike Star Wars, those underpinnings are always present, and occasionally acknowledged. Whatever its conceptual flaws, Star Trek from the beginning sought to create a \"real\" universe, not a fairy tale. Diplomacy and politics in particular have figured largely in many (if not most) episodes, and technology's impact on the universe's cultures has been more than once a plot fulcrum. The arrival and impact of warp drive underlay a whole movie. Now MicroProse gives us an ambitious and mostly successful attempt to show the inner workings of Trek's five largest political entities, their interrelationships, the philosophies upon which they END are built, and the infrastructures OPTIONS that support them. It's a tall order, and playing PLAYBACK TACTICAL BIRTH OF THE FEDERATION imposes some hefty demands.

"STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION BIRTH OF THE FEDERATION  REVIEW continued from page 154 Who's Who? largely to the game's ability to communicate that sense of exploration that was part of Trek's stock-in-trade. Establishing communication with a newly encountered species, whether a familiar one from the series or a minor one, is challenging and rewarding. Your relationships with other species also have an economic impact as you develop trade routes and mutual economic dependencies. But sometimes you have to fight (or, let's face it, you choose to, even if your race is not by nature warlike). Here's one of the weak spots of the game. The tactical combat screens, although attractive and well thought out, seemed jarring to me. You can issue combat orders to your fleet, then watch the orders STRATEGYZWAR enacted. But because the overall game is so deeply based on grand ow you play BIRTH OF THE FEDERATION is in many ways determined strategy, its tactical by the race you choose.

TOTAL ANNIHILATION: KINGDOMS REVIEW continued from page 151 UN makes your unit production more efficient. In this RTS, resources take a back seat to unit production and management. Multiplayer consists of several skirmish maps, along with some special scripted scenarios like King of the Hill and a beachhead invasion. Once you get tired of these, you can use the included map editor to cre. ate your own scenarios. One of the problems with the original TOTAL ANNIHILATION was that you couldn't really tell the difference between the two sides. This time, the four factions are unique in look and unit focus. The Aramon (earth) faction has traditional medieval units like archers, cavalry, and catapults, while its ally, Veruna (water), has musketeers, dirigibles, and the largest navy. Zhon (air) has quick flying units, and it's so mobile that it doesn't even have standing structures for creating units; instead, mobile \"builder\" units generate troops. Finally, Taros (fire) has the undead, along with several mage units. While each faction has a unique set of units, each can eventually conjure a dragon, which is a great equalizer in just about any battle. Finally, there is a random chance that each faction's deity, an uber-unit of sorts that you control, will join any given battle. One problem with the campaign is that the Al is a bit erratic at times. The pathfinding is solid; units usually get to their final destination, but they tend to take long, alternate routes. Also, often found my men obliviously polishing their muskets while yak-riding archers were firing at them three feet away. KINGDOMS deemphasizes resource management, providing only one resource: mana. And it's unlimited. You capture mana sites by placing lodestones on them, and the more sites you capture, the larger your mana pool becomes, which My Kingdom for a Horse TA KINGDOMS does have some significant problems, however.

"REVIEW  THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR II STRATEGYTIWARI Marred Masterpiece A Good Sequel, but Not Up to the Original Classic Bo Dalopo o@leo DIE EN by Jim Cobb he original OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR Won CGW's Best Wargame award because it was a wonderful study of 20th-century warfare and surprisingly enjoyable for such a complex game. THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR II (ART II) brings the series from WWII to the beginning of the next century, and it chronicles the changing effects of increasingly lethal technology on the modern battlefield. In particular, ART II's clever depiction of the concept of air mobility deftly shows the major difference between WWII and modern fighting, with the helicopter finally getting its due in a computer wargame. 133 1:33 No Battle Vacuum Here Like its predecessor, ART II shines in its variety of scale and locations. Battles are fought in rugged mountain ranges, burning deserts, and lush jungles, complete with appropriate meteorological effects. These battles are not fought in vacuums. They loi from the interface. M 12  Other shortcomings: The computer opponent of ART II isn't quite as tough as that of the original (though the game is still a delight when played by email).

Here are a few suggestions, courtesy of designer Chris Sawyer. How about positioning a corkscrew so that it twists over a footpath? Nearby guests will be fascinated by it, and riders will get an extra thrill. Building a pair of racing roller coasters is an obvious idea, but there are many ways to make it a bi more interesting. Here, the two tracks twist over and around each other by using a pair of parallel corkscrews. Perhaps an even better variation of this would be to have the tracks running in opposite directions, and timing the trains so they pass each other on the corkscrews.

"Strategy/Wargames 3903 5.25W TOTAL ANNIHILATION: KINGDOMS Aramon 1 Scout early and often. While you might be able to stop an early attack with Elsin alone, you still have to see it coming. 2 Use defensive structures sparingly. They are very expensive, and cheaper mobile units do the same job. 3 Don't build a trebuchet until you're ready. It's a big investment, so create defenses first, a trebuchet later. 4 Remember the titan's armor radius. One titan in a group of mage archers will make a big difference. 5 Resurrect everything possible. And grab every corpse you see. Taros 1 Play defensively. Taros is the slowest race, and picking fights is usually a bad idea. 2 Use only caged demons on hilltops. They will stand a better chance of hitting air targets. 3 Build walls around the mage tower. One layer of walls around a mage tower will stop all melee attacks and many ballistic attacks. 4 Build either a cabal or an abyss. Rarely will you need both factories at once. 5 Baby-sit your powerful magic users. The weather witch, the fire mage, and the mind mage are weak, but very effective. Try adding one of these to a group of blade demons. Zhon 1 Combine your stone giants and shamans. This makes for one of the most effective Zhon assault forces. 2 Rush to build a few harpies, Then concentrate on building your infrastructure. While your units are building, micromanage those harpies and capture enemy units. Harass the enemy with his own forces and maybe secure an enemy builder. 3 Zhon are mobile, so think dynamically. Queue up your builders to build toward your enemy. This allows your troops to get to the front lines faster. 4 Stone giants and death totems can take out enemy air assaults. But they must be concentrated, so use them around divine lodestones. 5 In the early game, use thirsha to claim manasites. As the game progresses and you lose thirsha, attack other enemy positions and gain their manasites. Veruna 1 If a map has water, control it. The Veruna have incredible power at sea, so utilize it to augment your land-based forces. 2 Amazon knights are weak in small numbers. But they can be devastating in groups of 10 to 20. 3 When taking on enemy flying units, use the cannon tower. This unit will survive a third-weapon attack and cause tremendous damage to thirsha and dragons. 4 Mortars are great for base and wall defense. Build a wall and place a mortar behind it. This will give your wall towers good backup and force your enemy to either fly over or breach your wall. 5 In the endgame, create a circle of pillar-of-light structures. Then land your dragon in the middle of the circle to heal, while his mana recharges. Courtesy of Cavedog insan sdun sd sdn sdi sdi sasa Here's a rather strange idea to try if space is limited (left). These two roller coasters are built directly above and below each other, and could perhaps even be designed to race each other. Don't be afraid to use the same area of land for several different rides. Here's a selection of rides (right) all built through, under, and over each other. Some of them also dive underground, providing even more excitement for the riders. Who says all roller coasters have to start with a lift hill? Here's a design (right) that cleverly uses a cliff face to allow the train to go straight out of the station into a steep, twisted drop. The lift hill on this design is actually underground, at the end of the ride. Here (left), a large upward helix leads into a tighter downward helix inside the first one.

"JOHNNY WILSON Who Owns Online Games? Virtual Property and Online Community Define the Future company to see the light, however. Microsoft is building persistent worlds. We've talked about ASHERON'S CALL before. It is a 3D fantasy role. playing game that enables you to dabble in politics and recruit vassals. It has the basic appeal of a UO with a lot of extra nuances with regard to the social system and prestige system. If fantasy isn't your thing, they've got a science-fiction angle on the persistent world/universe gambit. Chris Roberts, designer of the WING COMMANDER series, has struck gold again (and lectible card games garner in the real world. Even the traditional shooter genre is taking a cue from the success of UO. The good folks at Valve are creating league play for TEAM FORTRESS. Imagine if your clan could be nationally ranked and could schedule sanctioned matches with ease, and also schedule practice sessions that wouldn't count against their reputation. Suddenly, cooperative play becomes more compelling, gamers become more interested in competing with the same folks, and death-matching becomes about as interesting as an exhibition game for major league baseball. An exhibition game shows off all of the mechanics and may feature both great plays and players, but it doesn't count in any overarching framework. The same is true of death matches, but the future is Recent sales of ULTIMA ONLINE accounts on eBay for hundreds of dollars indicates that there is perceived value in owning property, prestige and privilege in a virtual world. or me, the most exciting aspect of this year's Electronic Entertainment Exposition (E3) was seeing that I might not have been as crazy with regard to the future of online gaming as I was beginning to think I was. For years, I've been saying that online gaming will create new communities where gamers will have a larger stake in \"owning\" and \"customizing\" a part of the game. I even coined a word for such communities. I called them \"cyburbs.\" The support for not using this neologism is overwhelming. Yet, we're beginning to see a glimpse of what I believed they would become virtual refuges where individuals would find kindred souls. Ironically, it seems to have been ULTIMA ONLINE, the persistent world that many of us castigated from its initial launch, that turned the tide. Enough fans of the great role-playing series were willing to turn cold hard cash into virtual gold that UO not only defined a profitable business model to a company (Electronic Arts) which felt online profits were many years away, but also created a gold rush in virtual property. Recent sales of UO accounts on eBay for hundreds and, in at least one case, over a thousand dollars indicates that there is perceived value in owning property, prestige and privilege in a virtual world. Why? It was largely because Lord British and the UO team understood the value of letting people build what they wanted to build and do what they wanted to do. They also understood the value of not taking those custom artifacts away from the gamers once they'd worked for them. From the improved first age through the much improved ULTIMA ONLINE: THE SECOND AGE, the world became very real to a lot of people. At E3, the principle is being extended. Electronic Arts has proved that they understand the value of such a community and such custom ownership of virtual property with an upcoming release from the NEED FOR SPEED team. MOTOR CITY takes the hot rods of the '50s, '60s and '70s and allows you to buy, sell, and customize your own virtual street machines. You can join virtual car clubs and spend a good deal of time betting virtual cash or racing for pinks (therein giving up possession of your virtual hot rod to another player). You can paint your car with a custom paint job or sell a custom paint job to another player via an online auction a la eBay. In short, the team has wisely given hot rod fans a reason to keep coming back to the online world. As in UO, the MOTOR CITY designers understand what it takes to get you emotionally and economically committed to a game world. EA isn't the only big much more exciting. I'm looking forward to the implementation of new ways to customize games, innovative new virtual economies, and new communities. Community, customization and continuity are the keys to more robust, interesting and lucrative games in the future. I just wonder what will happen to our \"real\" lives when the \"cyburbs\" (some people never give up) seem both more real and satisfying than our everyday lives. CGW no comments about the movie, either!). In FREELANCER, you have all the freedom you once wished to in PRIVATEER. You'll be able to steal ships and cargoes from other players, but you'll also be able to buy, sell, upgrade and customize. I can easily imagine auction traffic in terms of custom ships, just like the auction traffic in UO accounts. It doesn't take a large company to see the potential, however. Watch for a game called TERMINUS. This is a group of young developers who have developed a persistent science-fiction universe where you can build your own ships according to a few basic rules and then test them via their physics model. A small utility program checks out the ships and either tells you what may be wrong with your design or vets them for entry into the TERMINUS universe. These virtual space ships might generate as much real cash in the future as colPAL A7A COMPUTER GAMING WORLD SEPTEMBER 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"DENNY ATKIN Long Live Sims A Look Forward and a Farewell copies. And that's in a market that's not overcrowded with games. In current conditions, we find award-winning simulations such as EUROPEAN AIR WAR end up as commercial failures. So are we doomed to endlessly repeat this boom/bust cycle? If things don't change, we are. And to received a lot of feedback about my \"Sims Are Dead\" column in the July issue of CGW.To those who decided not to upgrade their systems out of fear that there would be no sims coming down the pike, go ahead and soup up that PC. As you'll see from our feature section this month, there are actually quite a few coming down the pike during the rest of '99 and into Y2K. The drought will come later in 2000 and probably continue into 2001. But even then there will be a number of sims to choose from, just not in the quantities we've grown used to over the past couple of years. I did receive a response from a respected flight sim developer. \"Read your column. Dead-on,\" he said, \"especially the observation on the cyclical nature of this biz. Success breeds imitation and competition, which breed cannibalization, which breeds bad business, which breeds drop-out, which breeds opportunity, which breeds renewed success.\" Sometimes it sucks to be right. ducing newbies to the genre. If you have game-playing friends who haven't flown a sim, no matter how good FLANKER 2.0 is, all that game is going to do is send them scurrying back to the simplicity of QUAKE III. Embrace the simple sims, and promote them to friends. Start your friends in a World War II sim, or one of the simpler jet sims, and help bring them up to speed. Share the love, people. Responsibility also rests with game developers. It's time to step back and rethink the typical simula tion design model. Today we have the \"starter\" sims, such as the entertaining, if fluffy, Novalogic games; JETFIGHTER III, one of the best intro sim designs of recent years, and the those missions good enough to justify buying the game. The mainstream missions will bring in the novices, and if they have enough fun, they'll move on to the realistic campaign. All it will take is a mainstream hit to show folks they don't need to be afraid of sims and perhaps we won't be a niche anymore. This isn't an unreasonable pipedream, either. JANE'S A-10 WARTHOG has a ramp-up campaign much like that described above. Simis' upcoming KA52 TEAM ALLIGATOR defaults to an easy-to-fly mode no more challenging than COMANCHE 3, but has a wide variety of realism options that can be cranked up to appeal to all but the most anal of hard-core sim fans. It's time for an attitude adjustment, hard-core sim fans. The Niche Syndrome According to the industry insider quoted above, the coming drought is in many ways a result of the success of simulations. Back around 1995, after the last dry spell, a few sims hit the market and enjoyed great suc cess. \"Then came everyone,\" he said. \"Now the pie has been sliced so thin that no one can make money. There's a shake-out and people are dropping like flies. Guess what comes next?\" The problem is that the market is oversaturated-while flight sims are popular, there's not a big enough market for seven different WWII Europe flight sims to all make money. Like it or not, the flight-sim audience is a niche market with rare exceptions, a successful sim can be expected to sell about 150,000 some degree, it's our own fault. Go to your local computer store and watch casual gamers peruse the sims. Listen to their questions. You'll find that the features we've spent years demanding from sims are scaring off the newbies. The happier we experienced players are with the realism of a sim, the more intimidating it is to a new player. So we end u p with a static segment of the gaming audience in an industry that's overly dependent on constant growth. the solution is twofold. Part of it lies with us, the players. It's time for an attitude adjustment among hardcore sim fans. If a simulation comes o ut that's aimed at beginning users, don't jump on the Internet and flame the game and its developers. Instead, accept the fact that even though you may be too knowledge. able to enjoy, say, F-22 LIGHTNING 3. the game may be perfect for introhorrific TOP GUN: HORNET'S NEST. Then we have the \"serious\" sims, realistic efforts such as LONGBOW II, JANE'S F-15, and FLANKER 2.0. While most of these hard-core games are scalable to a degree, they don't have what it takes to reach a mass audience. I'm not suggesting dumbing down simulations by any means. But to support the continued develop ment of hard-core sims, perhaps it's time for developers to pause at the Idol of Entertainment before proceeding to the Altar of Realism. The instant-action modes in virtually all sims are boring, developers of serious sims need to include a mode that concentrates on fun as well, and to make this mode more than an afterthought. Put the dynamic and historical campaigns in for the experienced users, but drop in a set of scripted missions with emphasis on gameplay for the newbies. And make Flying Into the Sunset One sim-related thing you won't see in the future is my frighteningly large forehead gracing the pages of CGW. After four and a half years, this is my last column for the magazine, as I'm moving on to an exciting opportunity elsewhere. But I'll always remain close to CGW. After all, it's a great group of guys who really know their stuff friends as well as co-workers. That, and Jeff Green still owes me $19.50. So, sim fans, keep the faith, and spread the word. The future of sims is in your hands. CGW Denny may be flying off into the sunset, but you can still write him at dennyatkin@hotmail.com. And anyone jealous of Denny's cable modem can share our vicious glee in knowing he's moving to a snowy land of 56K connections. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. SEPTEMBER 1999 177 "


"GREENSPEAK Your Ultimate Strategy Guide How to Win Every Game, Every Time, No Matter What circles, you'll most likely so befuddle the other players that they'll resign and start a new game without you-thus leaving you with another default victory! eople often ask me, as I roam my ongoing AGE OF EMPIRES battles against my the Earth, how I can be so friend Juliet. For a full year now, I have cleverly amazingly great at computer managed to lose every single game we've games. I'm afraid I have no played, in a variety of \"dumb\" ways, all on purdefinitive answer.

But someone like me comes along n ew ways to pretend to be bad, such as letting only once in a generation.

ROMs, available through my Web site at a reasonable price. (And while you're at it, be sure to JEFF GREEN check out my Tae-Bo Sweatin' to the Oldies workout video as well.) 4. Play people worse than you. If, in the worst-case scenario, you find yourself in a serious gaming slump-like, say, losing to the same person in AGE OF EMPIRES for a year straight-you may want to simply regroup and start playing people who, if you can find them, suck worse than you do. My most common strategy along these lines is to seek out certain types of opponents, who, barring a rare occurrence of dumb luck, will almost certainly lose. Current favorites include blind people, toddlers in the three-to-five age range (who, I've happily discovered, really suck at games like ALPHA CENTAURI), and small animals. Once you get a few of these victories under your belt, your ego will soar and you can once again climb the ladder as a Gaming God. 5. Disconnect when the going gets bad. Finally, if, on that rarest of occasions, you find yourself actually losing a game (not on purNothing makes a multiplayer game more rewarding than spending the entire time in a dark corner hiding from all the other players.. 1. Cower and camp. When playing a multiplayer deathmatch game like QUAKE 3, never forget the Greenspeak Golden C&CTM rule: Cower and camp. Remember, if you're hiding, they can't find you, and if they can't find you, they can't frag you. Nothing makes a multiplayer game more rewarding than spending the entire time in a dark corner hiding from all the other play ers, calmly sniping at people from long distance. Not only is it personally satisfying, but other players will respect you for your wily, evasive strategy. Camping by respawn points and picking off defenseless players as they enter the game is another surefire way to up your frag count and earn a reputation as the kind of takeno-prisoners gamer that others will fear. 3. Don't get bogged down by \"rules.\" Nothing can mess up your gaming-and winning-experience more than an overreliance on rules and instructions. Flight Sims, for exam ple, are notorious for including all sorts of extraneous, intimidating material, such as 50pound manuals, keyboard overlays, and the like, in an attempt to \"help\" you. Take it from me, you can just toss that stuff out. All those controls and buttons and other doodads you see in the cockpit? Not important. Don't bother learn ing esoteric flying terms like yoke and wingspan and landing gear either. The most enjoyable way to get through these games is to simply grab the joystick, hit the throttle, and let 'er rip. True, you might not necessarily carry off some of the more advanced maneuvers such as \"get ting airborne\" (whatever that means), but, as you zoom around the runway, out of control, in pose-see strategy #2), there is only one real solution: Disconnect from the server. I usually find that going to the File menu and selecting Disconnect will do the trick, but to be even safer you might just want to hit the Restart button on your computer. Nothing can mess up your reputation or standings worse than actually taking a loss, so the best gamers make sure that this never happens. For added effectiveness, you may want to precede the maneuver by typing something in the chat window like, \"Uh oh-tornado coming\" or \"I think my mother just collapsed.\" CGW 2. Pretend to suck. This is perhaps my favorite and most oftemployed strategy. Lull your opponents into a false sense of security by pretending to be incompetent. Then, when their guard is completely down, go in for the kill. I have been using this strategy to particular effectiveness in What Jeff doesn't realize is that his cat PJ. has been successfully using Strategy #2 against him in STARCRAFT for the last year, in preparat ion for a crushing victory next month.
