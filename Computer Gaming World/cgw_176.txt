"ILSON Let's Get Physical Reality Versus Fun: The Debate Continues EDITORIAL inventiveness in real life. There should be enough verisimilitude in a game that everything seems real, but not so real that it gets in the way of enjoyment. Before you cry, \"Foul!\" or something less printable, I will admit that verisimilitude doesn't always add to gaming enjoyment. In a game, but we're probably not going to care unless the special effects are impressive enough and the gun is as effective or more than the other weapons at our disposal. Reality definitely takes a back seat to inventiveness, freshness, and enjoyment of the fictional gameworld in such cases. Yet, there are times when we expect the game mechanics to perform analogous to real experience, even though the game may be set on a nonexistent planet or an alternate universe. We recently saw a magnificent tech demo that modeled cloth rippling on a character's coat and wind blowing fog through a misty street. Will most gamers even notice? Some will, but more calculate the exact speed and arc of a chandelier for your hero to swing from, but if the calculations for the physical model of the chandelier hit the CPU like an unchivalrous kick to your hero's groin, you'll never win the design duel. Frankly. I love it when a game adds new elements of realism to the mix. I loved the rippling cloth demo (okay, so I have a low threshold of excitement). However, I feel have to say, on behalf of gamers everywhere, that there needs to be a corrective. Game designers and publishers shouldn't get so excited about physics that they forget about gameplay. If you're going to invest so much effort in creating a physical world, make sure it's hat could possibly be more satisfying than performing that perfect Immelmann and shooting down an expert enemy pilot who had just been sneaking in on your tail for the kill? Well, for many gamers, it would be knowing that they had stretched the endurance of their plane to the max, performing a difficult, barely possible maneuver within the limits of real life. What could be sweeter than cruising past the finish line in the Monaco Grand Prix? For some of us, it's knowing that our superior attention to detail in tire compounds and aerodynamic set-up had made our win possible. What could be more exciting than fanning your opponent for the last out of a hard-fought World Series? To many gamers, it's knowing that they had read the split-statistics correctly and smartly gone against the standard percentage call. Let's face it. In many genres, it is more satisfying to win if you've been able to use logic and knowledge gleaned from your experience in the real world to gain the winning edge. It feels better to win when it looks right, feels right, and acts right from a real-world perspective. We want to feel like our prowess on the computerized fields of battle is reflective of our cleverness, our experience, or our It's not going to be fun if the action seems viewed through a strobe light. game such as GRIM FANDANGO, we don't care that directional signs don't really spin like weather vanes in order to help us out of a forest maze. We fully expect strange experiences in an imaginary land of the dead (no letters from those of you who have undergone neardeath experiences, please). In most first-person shooters, we don't want realistic weapons. Sure, you can put a .357 Magnum with a perfect ballistics model in the important to all of us will be the scenario design and opponent Al. Adding physics to a game is great, but physical properties alone will not make a good game. You can perfectly model the materials, weight, and density for the beer stein that your hero is about to throw at the Cardinal's guard, but it's no fun if the action seems as if it's viewed through a strobe light after he launches the stein from his hand. You can systematically accessible, interesting, and balanced once we enter that world. Get some real play-testers to check out that world and shake it down. See how your abstractions work against real gamers' assumptions. If you're aiming at reality, invest more time in getting feedback from real gamers. Let's hope the move toward more physics and realism doesn't circumvent the age-old quest for playability. The game is still the thing. CGW near TRESPASSER The game would be great if you could get under these crates and move them, just the way Roger Gonzalez showed us on his Web site (http://datapult.com/ibrowse/?folder=/rg/games/trespasser). Unfortunately, the physics don't hold up. Here, we try to crouch below one of the crates and lift it up. Oops! No luck! Rather than thinking outside the box, we're existing inside: We are one with the box. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 23 "

"Un-immaculate Reception The More Dominant EA Sports Is, the More We Demand even the most jaded of computergaming journalists. So, now that I've bragged on EA for several paragraphs-no doubt executives will be checking under neath my desk at CGW for the alien pod—it's time to assume my other sports persona. Like any spoiled fan who expects his team to win the Super Bowl every year by three touchdowns, it is my sacred duty (especially since 1 dissed the NBA earlier in this decade ago, EA Sports jump-started the 16-bit console market with its tremendous sports line. This is not legend, but fact: Just ask anyone who remained addicted for years to the easily playable, frantically paced, and incredibly fun MADDEN FOOTBALL for the SEGA Genesis. EA followed this success with domination of the PlayStation sports market, and after a few early setbacks, it looks as if it could do the same in the PC market (if you don't believe me, check out the Premier finalists for Sports Game of the Year in this issue's READ.ME). For all of you who are whining about the relative lack of balance and variety in the PC sports market, here's a free membership to the Michael Jordan's Dominance is Bad for the NBA club (redeemable only at the joint whim of His Airness and commissioner David Stern—not valid in Hawaii and Montana; some restrictions may apply). Face it: Fans love an unstoppable force-with the exception of tennis' Pete Sampras—and EA is as close as we have to the Denver Broncos in all of PC sports. article) to make unreasonable demands of EA Sports. Yes, I know that Ric Neal and his team are a lock to win the Comeback of the Year Award for the best MADDEN FOOTBALL in years. And, yes, I'll admit that FIFA '99 is the best PC sports game I've played since Sierra's FRONT PAGE FOOTBALL PRO was in its prime (somewhere around the time that the Miami Dolphins went undefeated). But, doggone it, and other PC sports fans—have a right to expect even more from folks as talented as those at EA. Surely, one of the three soccer games that EA Sports released in a 10-month period could have given way to a groundbreaking tennis game. If Andre Agassi is too busy emulating Jackson Pollock, throwing paint around in all those camera commercials, surely Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, and Bjorn Borg still have enough marketing life left to hit a few cyber-smashes. Hell, you could toss in Rod Laver, John Newcombe, and the ghost of Big Bill Tilden for a lot less money than it takes to license the NBA or NFL. Earlier this year, the industry was all abuzz about GAME, NET AND MATCH-a title which nearly matched the gameplay of 1991's PRO TENNIS TOUR on the Amiga. Stop the fun. Please Wishful Thinking I'm sure that pro basketball fans are consoling themselves during the real-world lockout by running endless seasons of NBA LIVE 99. But that's no excuse for not giving us a good college hoops game, EA, especially since you've had the best one for years on consoles. How much longer am I supposed How much longer am I supposed to keep Haffner's Courtside College Basketball on my laptop? NA Coach of the Year? Because EA is so good at piling up winning seasons in franchises such as NBA LIVE and FIFA, the company doesn't get credit for all of the obscure sports for which it produces games. Of course, some of these, like RUGBY, are so remarkably ill-conceived and poorly executed that it's little wonder EA Sports conveniently fails to market them worldwide. On the other hand, EA's CRICKET 97 is one of those surprisingly charming experiences that can bring a smile to to keep Lance Haffner's COURTSIDE COLLEGE BASKETBALL-a textbased sim that had its last major upgrade (to color) in 1994—on my laptop? Then again, this would give me a reason to keep that old 486 I'm currently using as a doorstop.... Don't get me wrong, guys. I can't wait for KNOCKOUT KINGS, or FOES OF ALI, or THRILLA IN MANILA II, or whatever it's called this month. I just hope that NBA LIVE 2001 and Rocky VIII don't beat it to the punch. CGW IS THIS ALL THERE IS? If EA Sports can make even FIFA a game to die for, what could they do with tennis or lacrosse or even (heaven forbid) curling? 26 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Tune in next month for our annual Best and Worst Awards issue. Sound Off If there was ever an award for best soundtrack in a computer game, it should go to Half-Life. I had FlexiCD installed and the music plays from the CD-ROM after the computer rebooted. I think the music is the best that was ever composed in a computer game, echoing its dark, sinister, and terrifying background.

Ever since the first previews I had TRESPASSER: JURASSIC PARK on my \"must have\" list. When I finally saw it released last week, I turned the box for probably five minutes and what I saw didn't feel/read right.

Wangberg ULETTERS Rage 3D Rage In your February article (\"Stronger, Faster, Better\") on building \"The Power Rig\" and \"The Lean Machine\" you suggested using a Diamond MX300 and a ThrustMaster Rage3D controller on the Power Rig. When I upgraded my system with the MX300 sound card found my Rage3D incompatible. Were you just picking parts out of a catalog or did you actually build this and test it? If you did build this system how did you get it to work? Scott Conaway Via the Internet Senior Vice Presidents Rayna Brown (Human Resources) Daryl R.

The manual states that I should shoot for 35fps. What kind of machine is needed for that? If Sierra wants to produce games which require major horsepower for them to function as designed, that's their business. But someone should warn the buyers that the \"minimum\" simply means you can load the program to see what you are missing, and that you can not possibly play the game with it. Sierra should warn potential buyers on the box (when I called Sierra they were very apologetic and admitted the same, offered to take it back and acknowledged that most machines can not run the game properly). But most of all your review should strongly point out that the minimum requirements are nowhere near able to run the simulation, and that most gamers are not going to have the machines to run it. We depend on your reviews to inform us of software requirements to enjoy games at their best. If someone buys this game assuming that it will function correctly based your review and on their experience with the other Sierra driving simulations they will be sorely disappointed. Douglas Peck Via the Internet ZD PUBLISHING Loyd Case replies: After much wailing and anashing of tepth I did finally get the Rage 3D gamepad working. I had to delete the gameport device several times, reinstall the drivers and perform a few hacks. Even then, the system sometimes refuses to recognize the pad and only a reboot fixes it. To be honest, I'm not sure I could replicate the steps to make it work. Oddly, the Attack Throttle, which also uses ThrustMaster's DirectConnect technology, seems to work fine. So for the new Power Rig, I'm using the Microsoft Freestyle Pro, which works quite well. But if you really like the Rage 3D, Thrust Master has just started shipping the USB model, which should work great in any Windows 98 system with USB ports.

ZIFF-DAVIS a SOFTBANK company Audit Bureau of Circulations Member Better Simming Bravo to Denny Atkin for his column, \"Campaign Promises\" (February, 1999). As an avid flight sim pilot, I can not agree more with all of his comments and suggestions for creating more enjoyable campaigns. The best part? All of his suggestions are do-able now. No fancy, brand-new technology needed, just a new breed of programmers and campaign designers who are not so hell-bent on physics realism and 3D effects. I couldn't care less whether I can see the reflection of my knee in the canopy, if only something unexpected would happen in the mission! Campaign missions seem to be designed by ex-Dungeon & Dragons players. Having to find the one-and-only way to \"beat the level\" is for Nintendo games, not flight sims. Allow the pilot to fly the mission, and either succeed, or fail and suffer the consequences, and move on. Bob \"Hedgehog\" Sebaste Hammerheads Squadron Via the Internet Your lament is unfortunately a familiar one. GPL is merely the latest game to under report system requirements. We apologize for not warning you, but we don't have the resources necessary to test each game's requirements, and different people have different levels of tolerance anyways. We can offer some advice. Part of the reason for the slow frame-rate on your system is that your video card is not supported by most 3D games. (Just because a video card has the word \"3D\" in it doesn't mean it's a true 3D card.) GPL would run faster and look better on your system if you had a 3D card supported by the game. The game supports 3Dfx (Voodoo) or Renditionbased (Verité) 3D accelerators. In this case we'd recommend a Voodoo card because it is supported by more games than Rendition and has more RAM to speed things along. ABC AUDITED Computer Gaming World is not affiliated with IDG.

"SCOOP! Activision Sinks Its Teeth Into Vampire: The Masquerade READ. ME Vampire is the first title from Nihilistic Software, a development company headed by Ray Gresko, Robert Huebner and Steve Tietze. The team's combined credits INCLUDE DARK FORCES, DARK FORCES II: JEDI KNIGHT, DESCENT, DESCENT II, and QUAKE MISSION PACK #2. For a deeper foray into the dark side, be sure to see our exclusive sneak preview in next month's issue, along with several other gothic/ horror games scheduled for release later this year. ctivision is working on a game of gothic bloodlust based on the popular Vampire role-playing games from White Wolf Publishing. VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE will be an action/roleplaying game based on an original script chronicling 800 years in the life of a medieval vampire. CGW got an exclusive early look at the game, which looks so amazingly cool we've decided to bring you a full in-depth preview next month. The game tells the story of Christof Romuald, a knight in 12th Century Prague who is embraced into the Brujah Clan of vampires. You'll follow Christof's assimilation into the World of Darkness starting in Prague and Vienna, and advancing to scenes in modern London and New York. In addition to controlling Christof, players will be able to control a party of up to four vampire characters who join him during the game. From what we know of the story, Christof and his allies are caught up in the wars between different clans and must stop an evil Vampire Lord who intends to dominate the world. Players will defend themselves using a variety of weapons, including swords and shields in medieval times and automatic weapons in modern times. Players will also get to experiment with vampiric disciplines, which will give them spell-like effects. The game boasts a new engine, called the Nod Engine, which was created by Nihilistic. The Nod Engine is fully 3D, and will support D3D, Glide, and Open GL. Level design is done with existing QUAKE Level design tools. Activision claims the engine is the most advanced engine ever used to build an RPG. It supports 3D soft-skinned skeletal models, specular lighting and volumetric fog to enhance the atmosphere, and exquisite graphic detail in both 3D models and 2D textures. Expect the game's graphic detail to rival the best action games out there. Playing Lately I vant to suck your blud! .

"READ.ME Mars Reacts Maxis Readies Two Fresh Game Ideas ill Wright doesn't build games the oldfashioned way. It's not about winning or losing, violence or destruction. Wright's software toys, such as SIMCITY, have been unconventional, but his games have nonetheless sold over seven million copies. Wright looks to turn interactive entertainment on its ear once again with his new game, THE SIMS. THE SIMS can be an interactive situation comedy, soap opera, or wide-open experiment in artificial life. Everything depends on whether you want to play openended or complete scenarios, which range from bringing couples together, acquiring possessions, or inviting the neighbors over to see your lampshade stunt. THE SIMS offers several pre-coded families or lets you build a simulacron of your own family, Play is handled by monitoring the way emotional and physical needs are met in the course of the life of the artificial neighborhood, Another new title in development at Maxis, SIMMARS, will at once be familiar and fresh to SIMCITY fans. The goal is to build a Mars colony with reducedor nondependency upon Earth. Working closely with NASA to ascertain the realistic probabilities concerning space colonization, Maxis hopes to give SIMMARS more depth and accuracy than even the much-heralded SIMCITY series. The company has hired the talents of former Industrial Light & Magic artist Ron Cobb to create the concept art for the buildings and vehicles. Cobb was the conceptual designer for MULTITUDIE DRILLING DEEP Ron Cobb's conceptual art gives the vehicles and buildings in SIMMARS an interesting and functional look. Alien and The Abyss, as well as conceptual artist for Total Recall, lasertechnology specialist for Real Genius, time travel consultant on the Delorean for Back to the Future, and director of The Last Starfighter. He is renowned for conceptual vehicles and buildings where every aspect of the drawing has a realistic functionality. Cobb's artistry adds a marvelous credibility to the look of the game and ensures that gamers will not experience another empty science-fiction experience like OUTPOST. SIMMARS seems clearly marked to be the best game to come out of Maxis since SIMCITY. JOHNNY WILSON STORE Will Wright's THE SIMS will allow gamers to set up their own Sim Soap Operas or Sim-Disasters.

Interactive Magic recently laid off approximately 20 staffers from their North Carolina headquarters, including the principles of the iF/A-18 CARRIER STRIKE FIGHTER development team. This, combined with the recent departure of top staffers from l-Magic Online, calls into question whether the company has abandoned the simulations market. It's unfortunate that this would happen, since the company nearly got it right with iF/A-18. The design was sound, and the next patch promised to fix the major bugs. However, with most of the iF/A-18 team gone, it appears that patch went out the window with them. instance, you can set the flight model to accurate, but use simplified radar targeting. If there's a downside to this sim, it's that it takes some real hardware muscle to get the most out of it. You can turn down details and get it running smoothly on a P200 with a 3D card, but with everything cranked up, a Pentium 11/400 can bog down accessing the drive in the campaign mode unless you have 128MB of RAM. Still, FALCON 3.0 sent many users scrambling to the store to upgrade to hot 386 PCs. With its impressive dynamic campaign, unprecedented system detail, scalable gameplay, and quality visuals, FALCON 4.0 should cause a spike in memory sales, and probably result in a few Pentium II upgrades as well. Watch for our in-depth look next issue—if we graduate flight training by then. DENNY ATKIN  585 Q2 99 www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. MARCH 1999 "

"Dying To Play Online READ.ME What's Going On With Online Gaming CAGE battle.net gomes online mise f the Internet is the primordial soup of start-up ventures, online game companies are some of the first organisms that crawled onto the beach. Some of these creatures were too weak to survive, while others evolved trying to better their chances. It's still a young market and a bit early to declare winners, but we thought it was time to check up on the players. One cautionary note: Subscriber numbers can only be obtained from their respective companies, and some of these companies were unwilling to release them. We were not able to independently verify usage numbers. Incidentally, the term \"subscriber\" is used rather liberally in the industry; for the purposes of this article, we'll refer to gamers who play the free stuff as \"users\" and call \"subscribers\" those who pay to play. GAMESTORM FAST TREE DWANGO Goes Down DWANGO pioneered the concept of multiplayer pay-to-play.

Numbers for their pay-to-play component, however, aren't nearly as good.

However, HEAT.NET spokesman Greg Chiemingo is quick to point out that \"both TEN and Mplayer had a year head-start on us and have rummaged through a number of business models while we have remained dedicated to our core beliefs,\" namely a model based on advertising and e-commerce. \"We are committed to offering our users fast free online gaming on the best action and Money To Be Made This is not to say that there isn't money to be made by actually charging players to play within an online gaming community, as the success of ULTIMA ONLINE has proven. With 200,000 copies sold (about 150,000 more than EA originally predicted) and 100,000 active, paying subscribers (at $9.95 a month), obviously Origin is doing something right. As GameStorm's CEO notes, \"You are joining a large, persistent universe community that goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with or without you. It's something that you can charge for, and historically, people have shown a willingness to pay for this kind of experience.\" It's this same belief that drives the pay-to-play portion of The Zone, which is attempting to offer massively multiplayer, onlineonly games as well, though they say that it's too early to expect profitability Spades The Zone 4,100 Age of Empires The Zone 2,800 players visit the site to play free five years before we really begin games, such as spades.

"SNEAK PREVIEWS RUTAND Aliens vs. Predator Three Intense Characters in One Scary-ass Game  HI EX MAGAZINES ROUNDS 00 by Greg Fortune II of the Alien and Predator movies had one thing in common: Extraterrestrial killing machines that you just couldn't help wanting to see more of. Now, who hasn't thought about pitting the two races against each other to see just who's the best? Well, that's precisely what you get to do in ALIENS VS. PREDATOR. The concept of bringing the Alien and Predator races together for a little Celebrity deathmatch is not a new one. There's a very cool comic book series based on the subject, and if you look closely at the wall of the last set in Predator 2, you'll see an alien skull mounted in the Predators' trophy room. There was even talk of a movie featuring both races, but apparently nobody was willing to loosen their grip on the licenses long enough to do it. So, if you ever wanted to jump I've gone through are toughinto one of these movies and really tough. None of your opposhow them how to do it, here's nents is going to give you a secyour chance. ond chance if you make a mistake. In ALIENS VS.

Some of our favorite movie locations are here, including the derelict ship from Alien and the penal colony from Alien3. There are military installations for the Predator to hunt in, and some standard \"Let's get the hell out of here\" levels for the Marines. The deathmatch levels also show promise with lots of places for crossfire, stalking, and hiding. SNEAK_PREVIEWS SAAT HIS THCAZINES Stop Your Grinnin' ROUNDS and Drop Your Linen!

Just so you don't think that the Marines are fodder in this one, remember Vasquez's smart gun? You know, the big cannon mounted on a swing arm? That baby will cut through an alien like a samurai sword through cottage cheese. Just be sure none of that acid splatters on you! Despite the very different abilities and extreme power of each of them, the three races seem oddly balanced here. In my play-testing, none of them seemed to have any huge advantage over the others. The deathmatch potential alone makes this a game to keep on your motion tracker. Let's Meet Our Contestants ALIEN inlike the Predators and the Marines, the Aliens don't have weapons and don't need power-ups. They can crawl along ceilings and walls, drop down behind you, and tear you to pieces in a second. Their attacks are incredibly fast, and their very appearance can send a squad of Marines into a panic. Playing as the Alien race is a dream come true, and playing against them is PREDATOR o the Predators in AVP have that cool cloaking field we all saw in the movies? You bet. In the limited beta we have, they also have their wrist blades, a spear gun, the shoulder cannon that tracks with head movement, and a medical rig. Also present is the glowing green blood that marks where the Predator was injured, both on the walls and on the MARINE The Colonial Marine personifies overt firepower. Everything about the Marine screams destruction.

BAD BLOOD Cornered by an Alien, this Predator had better kill the bugger before that acidic green blood or those vicious claws turn him into something even a mop won't pick up. Let's Dust off and Nuke the Site From Orbit... ALIENS VS. PREDATOR shows a lot of promise, even at this stage of its development. With a little spit and polish and a gamma control to fix some of the locales (a few are way too dark), this game could be one of our alltime favorites Don't take my word for it, play the exclusive ALIENS VS. PREDATOR Marine demo on this month's CG-ROM! I'm sure you'll agree that, barring any major mistakes as the game is finished, this is going to be a must-have title for a lot of us. CGW Greg Fortune gets a warm sensation every time he sits down for a session of AVP. (Although he only stopped playing HALFLIFE for long enough to write this preview.) a nightmare. You even have to be careful how you kill them, since they spray acid blood during their death throes and can kill you by bleeding on you. Of course, the main disadvantage of the Alien species is their lack of a ranged attack. But what they lack in longrange fire, they more than make up for in speed and ferocity. Add to that the Aliens' uncanny ability to spot either of the other races-cloaked or not-by the fiery blue halo around them and you have one nasty killing machine. If you like sneaking up on people and scaring the hell out of them, this is the race for you. PREDATOR Predator. The Predator has another useful tool in his grappling hook, which allows him to gain easy access to high places. From there, his cloaking and ranged weapons give the Predator excellent hunting opportunities. The \"medicomp\" is also well done, which offers the Predator unlimited healing as long as it has energy. When used, the medicomp provides the Predator with a pair of barbed syringes, which he can jab into his stomach. This, of course, is painful and causes the Predator to scream, giving away his location to interested parties everywhere. The Predator's use of stealth combined with his cool high-tech weaponry make him the favorite of those who prefer to hunt their prey for sport. WIE MAN MARINE Marines: the motion tracker. Sensing motion in a 180-degree arc in front of you, this baby tells you direction and range. So while you won't be able to conceal yourself on the roof like an Alien or cloak like a Predator, just let one of those suckers move and we'll see some fireworks. To help them gain access to higher ground and break long falls, the Marines are equipped with a jetpack that gives basic vertical functionality. Don't expect to be flying around the levels wasting enemies, however. Your boots will still be your main source of transportation. If you like walking into a room knowing that you're packing the biggest gun around, we've got a job for you in the Marines. 70 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 www.computergaming.com "

And there are far worse fates than being compared to one of the best-selling games of the decade. If we said REVENANT was a NAM clone, well, you'd probably stop reading right here. That said, REVENANT, developed by Cinematix and due for release in mid-1999, looks like more than just a DIABLO clone and has enough differences to justify its existence. Yes, it is a In My Time of Dying First of all, REVENANT promises to be more story-oriented than DIABLO, in that it actually has a story (DIABLO's plot was outstanding, but 90 percent of it was just in the manual).

"Descent 3 An Old Dog with Radical New Tricks SNEAK PREVIEWS POUBOT SUPER Frau by Chase Dahl he original DESCENT destroyed precedents set by other first-person shooters of its time. It plunged the player into a fully 3D world of twisting mines and mysterious caverns instead of the 2.5D worlds of DOOM and its clones. Never before had players experienced the vertigo of the game's six degrees of freedom; nor had their computerized opponents shown such intelligence in ensuring their destruction. That was four years ago, however, and DESCENT has grown somewhat long in the tooth. Its sequel added new weapons and opponents, but little else. Last year's FORSAKEN, while faithfully cloning DESCENT's gameplay, raised the ante with gorgeous, pyrotechnic graphics and mission structures beyond DESCENT'S repetitive \"blow up the main reactor, then get out\" scenario. But it was an updated DESCENT that fans really wanted, not just a console port with a picture of a nude woman on the box...and this spring Outrage seems set to deliver just that that, along with a little practice, will have newbies zipping through the levels in no time. Along with your craft-one of several that will be included in the full game-you're provided with a variety of death-dealing devices, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Naturally, the ammo and energy required is also scattered about, or left behind by destroyed opponents. Your old friend, the GuideBot, will also make an encore.

"COVER STORY butt. By eliminating the simlike aspects of other MECHWARRIORtype giant robot games and emphasizing this \"kill or be killed\" mindset, SLAVE ZERO focuses its gameplay squarely on action. Freedom Fighter While the story behind SLAVE ZERO isn't likely to hit the New York Times bestseller list anytime soon, it sets up the action nicely. In a bleak future world, the city S-19 is ruled by the evil, Big Brother-ish SovKhan. In order to secure his absolute rule, Sovkhan has created the Slaves, enormous biomechanical beings that keep the populace of S-19 suitably oppressed Inevitably, the people chafe under this heavy hand and a rebellion breaks out; you, as a particularly intrepid rebel, take control of a Slave to start the dirty work of freedom fighting, eventually taking SLAVE ZERO the battle directly to the palace of Sovkhan himself. While the Slaves are 60-foot, armored behemoths of destruction, they differ significantly from the giant robots of other games insofar as they aren't made so much as grown. No one pilots a Slave; instead they become one. Through an elaborate process, men are bonded to their Slaves, abandoning their humanity and evolving into something not quite human, not quite machine. Aside from giving the Slaves an anthropomorphized look and feel that is utterly unique, this bit of fiction actually affects gameplay. Bonded to your Slave, ZERO HOUR Doom With a View SLAVE ZERO's third-person perspective moves the game even fur ther away from the classic robotsim model. While a first-person perspective is generally the default choice for a shooter, the design team felt strongly that an exterior camera would best serve this game.

With plenty of attitude and an anime feel, SLAVE ZERO is definitely not your father's giant robot game. you're not just fighting oppression, you're literally fighting for your life: There's no eject button, no salvaging spare parts, no repair bays, no commandeering another Slave to save your of thinking after playing an early build of the game. If nothing else, a first-person perspective would rob the gamer of the wonderful Slave animation, which best displays the man/machine dichotomy. Moving with a brutish grace, the Slave resembles nothing so much as an enormous, metallic ape as he leaps over bridges, hoists himself atop skyscrapers with a pull from one massive arm, or snatches ammo power-ups with his long, beautifully articulated fingers. All of this rich detail would be lost in a standard, QUAKE-like perspective. A standard first-person view would also muddy the game's overwhelming sense of scale. The swirling mayhem that typically surrounds your avatar would be reduced to just so many darting targets in a typical FPS view. But by DUCK AND COVER The Titan is one of the first minibosses you will encounter. He'll crouch and tuck his head so that his heavy body armor can protect his vulnerable midsection. HAPPINESS IS A WARM (20-FOOT) GUN It takes a lot of firepower to tear down a city; fortunately, your Slave will have plenty of ordnance at his disposal. Weaponry is divided into three categories: bullet-spewing slug cannons, vicious energy weapons, and shoulder-mounted missiles. Here's what you can look forward to AVR-9 «Avenger\" Light Slug Cannon: Your first handheld weapon is a light cannon best suited for quick strikes against lightly armored opponents. IR-9000 \"Iron Roar\" not the most destructive member of your arsenal, but This rifle blasts 100mm shells at a very high rate of fire. It's Assault Cannon: you'll love its reliability and solid performance. CR-80 Cyclone Saturation Cannon: The massive Cyclone belches a hailstorm of bullets, but it eats a ton of ammo. SGS-3a Siege Cannon: This baby fires 400mm explosive shells that detonate on impact in a massive explosion. It's the perfect way to say, \"Die, scum.\" Plasma 200 Cannon: Your first energy gun fires pulses of flash-heated osmium plasma in excess of 7500 degrees down a linear accelerator and damages its target both by extreme temperature and by secondary flash effects. Plasma Burst Cannon: Great for taking on groups of enemies, this gun fires six plasma balls in a spreading circular pattern, each ball causing damage upon impact. 84 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 www.computergaming.com "

Notice the light sourcing and lens flare on the enemy Slave. CAGED DEATHMATCH The battle with Argilus, the first boss you face, is typical of SLAVE ZERO's boss philosophy: You find yourself in a limited space facing down a massive creature that's wielding incredible firepower. SL A VEZERO allowing the gamer to see the Slave straddling a freeway that cuts through a city of soaring buildings and blasting away at enemy behemoths, as tiny cars desperately try to avoid the battling giants, the enormity of the Slaves and S-19 is driven resoundingly home. The gameworld is one of SLAVE ZERO's most notable accomplishments, and it is easily one of the most vivid gaming environments I've seen. The city absolutely teems with life. It's not uncommon to find passing bus and show that enemy Slave what throwing hard heat is all about. Spot a personnel carrier approaching to unload ground troops? Drop one of those tanks that's pestering you on it. Feeling artistic? Make your own Jackson Pollock masterpiece by hurling pedestrians at a wall. This is what being a giant robot is all about. more involved mechanics to succeed, including jumping, strafing, hoisting, and torso twisting. By the time you reach the last levels, you'll be miles above the city and will have to skillfully jump, hang, and hoist yourself across the precipices of the Upper City as you face attacks from every conceivable angle. Other elements in the game follow this same incremental approach, with new enemies and weapons being introduced at the rate of about one per level. Every level has its own set of mission objectives. In one mission you'll have to destroy three separate generators, while another may ask you to escort refugees through S-19's enormous sewer system. Several missions will have secondary objectives that, while they won't need to be completed in order to succeed, will reward the gamer with more power-ups, weaponry, and challenge. Of course, Sovkhan will be doing everything he can to stop you, and Moving On Up SLAVE ZERO takes place across 16 increasingly large and complex Plasma Rail Cannon: Taking about two seconds to charge, this cannon sucks up negative particles before firing a ray of devastating energy.

Stone Dog Guided Missile System: This dog does hunt, firing homing missiles that relentlessly track targets, damaging them with explosive heat from their hydrogen plasma warheads. Zulu Mass Engagement Missile System: The Zulu's on-board sensor and sophisticated Al can automatically lock on to up to eight targets, tracking each individually when a salvo is fired. In addition, SLAVE ZERO has at least one special weapon, a Dark Matter Rifle that fires packets of hyperdense neutronium. The round's extreme surface gravity literally collapses atomic structures, fractures subatomic bonds, and eats through anything, including armor. It requires extreme amounts of power and fires in a straight, infinite line from its launch, gouging out trenches in walls and floors. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 85 "

"COVER_STORY that means you'll be facing enemy Slaves. A lot of them. You'll square off against speedy Piranhas, who'll attack you head-on; yellow Regulators, who fire missiles and roll to avoid your counterattacks: airborne packs of harassing Firefly units, who'll attack with \"Ripper\" machine guns. Damage taken by enemy Slaves is graphically represented by having the specific body parts flash with each hit. Designers for SLAVE ZERO haven't yet decided whether or not arms and legs that take sustained fire will actually get blown off. We're hoping they do. In any event, the Slave death animations are very cool, with the fallen enemies crumbling to the ground before they dissolve inside a cocoon of crackling electricity. While enemies will be positioned throughout the city, several will arrive suddenly via the Sentinel Delivery System, a sort of gargantuan pneumatic-tube system. Many of these tubes will be one-way, capable only of delivering enemy reinforcements; however, some tubes will be available to you, allowing you to take the fight to the enemy or to escape a battle that's going badly. Breaking up the parade of enemies will be unique minibosses on perhaps half the levels. The first hasn't quite finished gestating in SovKhan's labs. After an opportunity to stock up on weapons, you'll come upon Argilus trapped in his gestation vat, whereupon he'll attack with a titanic, sweeping energy beam. Later bosses include an enormous, mechanical wolf spider that explodes into several smaller spiders, and a sewer boss you'll have to fight while dealing with steadily rising water. SLAVE ZERO ZERO HOUR you'll face is Titan, a unit with heavy armor on his limbs and head. When attacked, he tucks himself into a ball, protecting his vulnerable midsection. Not all minibosses will be Slaves, either. The third level forces you to take down an enormous battle cruiser that keeps releasing flying Jammer troops until you destroy it. Of course the biggest battles will come against SLAVE ZERO's five bosses. Accolade has gone for a more traditional, console feel with the bosses, making them unique arena-type levels in which you're trapped with the boss until one of you dies. The first boss you'll meet is Argilus (see the \"Evil-ution\" sidebar), a Slave who Sound and Vision Visually. SLAVE ZERO is stunning. Accolade spent the first several months of the development cycle creating the Ecstasy game engine. SLAVE ZERO presented the designers with a complicated set of problems; most troublesome was How do you create a huge, open city, crawling with life, without absolutely tanking the frame-rate? The end results are impressive, with virtually anything in the game capable of animating. Slave Zero himself is the best example of this. Like all the game's creatures, Slave Zero has body parts that are capable of individual animation, allowing your alter ego to move and act in an organic, less-scripted way. In INCOMING You'll have to weather attacks from manned flying units such as these if you expect to make it through the game's levels to reach SovKhan's palace. Evil-ution s the first boss you face in the game, Argilus typifies Accolade's approach to designing the bosses in SLAVE ZERO. Each boss possesses unique attributes to challenge the gamer in a different way and, to some extent, to prepare him for subsequent levels in the game. In the case of Argilus, designers decided that he would be basically stationary, forcing the gamer to utilize more strafing and dodging than the game had required up to that point. With that fundamental idea in mind, concept sketches were then drawn and refined. The first sketch was too human, while another concept looked too much like Slave Zero himself, and was not in keeping with the overall game design. After deciding on the second sketch, the designers made a wire-frame model, rendered it with flat, shaded textures, then completed it with the final textures. From there, designers began the difficult process of tuning the boss for gameplay. 88 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 www.computergaming.com "

Cut-scenes between missions are rendered using the game engine, as well. Since SLAVE ZERO will require 3D hardware, it should come as no surprise that the game supports all sorts of full-color lighting effects. In addition to precalculated lighting for smooth, realistic shadows, the real-time lighting support allows for rockets, spotlights, and spectacular explosions to illuminate surrounding buildings and characters. The support for lighting effects extends to the enemies themselves, some of whom will have light sources on design. As HALF-LIFE has shown, great audio can greatly enhance the gaming experience; to that end, SLAVE ZERO will support A3D technology, allowing the game to build suspense through sound effects. For example, you can expect to hear the ominous clicking feet of a horde of spiders long before you face them. Even without positional audio, the sound in SLAVE ZERO is suitably epic, with shattering explosions, monstrous gunfire, and the earthshaking footsteps of the Slaves themselves. This is one game that truly cries out for a subwoofer. 0108 POWER OUTAGE His body crackling with electricity, an enemy Sentinel dies after taking one rocket too many to the head. deathmatch game that will remove all the weapons from play, forcing gamers to hurl buses, cars, trucks, and the odd schoolteacher at each other.

It's pretty cool stuff compared to the stiff, SLAVE ZERO ZERO HOUR their bodies that will shine at you during a fight. Finally, the real-time lighting lets the designers incorporate the effects to affect gameplay-expect at least one dimly lit level that will require you to pick up a vehicle and use its headlights as an impromptu flashlight.

"SPEED FREAKS 3D CARD ROUND UP BY LOYD CASE Strap in and hold on-CGW puts the latest 3D contenders to the test. t's been a few months since we checked out the graphics card scene. Back in December, we reviewed more than a dozen new 3D accelerators. Since then, some fresh players have arrived, and several cards that weren't quite ready then are now on your local store shelves. So it's time to strap in, hold on, and put another set of contenders to the test. Two clear leaders have emerged in the past couple of months. The RIVA TNT from cycle-time king nVidia and the Banshee chip from 3Dfx grace many a gamer's system. A number of card-makers have jumped on the bandwagon, supporting either TNT or Banshee, or both. But over that same period, a new horse has entered the race: ATI's Rage 128. We'll put them all through their paces and see if we can reach some conclusions as to which card is best for you. One other trend has emerged: The number of games that support only 3Dfx's Glide API is diminishing. We've seen quite a few titles that had been Glide-only games pick up support for either Direct3D or OpenGL-or both. This is welcome news for gamers who resisted having more than one card in their system, due to cost constraints or slot limitations. OpenGL is getting more attention now as well. ATI will showcase its OpenGL driver in its upcoming Rage Fury and Rage Magnum cards, which use the new Rage 128 chip. Still, most games that support OpenGL either are still based on one of the QUAKE engines or support more than one API (for example, Direct3D). Now, without further ado, let's dive into the card reviews. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  MARCH 1999 "


"PEED REAKS EGAU GAM UGE 452.6 GAMING Hercules Dynamite TNT MENDED Saw V AN SY EDITORS CHOICE 875787311 SA Anteceuuwwww 121131 A SSISTS 1993 wwwwwwwwwwww wwwwwwwwwwww WTST! 6160 S wwwwwwwwwwwwww SPEA KOREA K * * *** e've struggled with Hercules products in the past. Whenever we'd get a driver release from the company, it would cause more problems than it solved. I'm happy to report that Hercules hasn't strayed too far from nVidia's reference drivers, and stability on our 400MHz Pentium II test-bed was rock solid. And the news gets better. Hercules' performance was right up there with the competition. It edged out all the other boards to take top honors, with a 3D GameGauge score of 452.6. The 3D WinBench score was a decent 473, also up there with the other cards. The Dynamite TNT is a no-frills board without a software bundle. The card is very compact and has a fan attached to the NVidia RIVA TNT chip to keep it cool. There's no TV out, and the control panel is a bit limited. I've seen the card for under $150, though. Given the performance of this board, we give it a big thumbs up. Dynamite TNT. $147 (street). Hercules, (510) 623-6030. www.hercules.com PROS: Relatively inexpensive for a TNT board; stable. CONS: Mediocre 3D GameGauge score for a TNT board. \"R081 AOpen Navigator PA70 Diamond Monster Fusion AGP ** * * * here's finally another Savage3D board available in the United States, from Taiwanese component-maker AOpen. The PA70 is pretty much a generic, SDRAM-based board with TV-out and very generic drivers. There's very little you can do in the way of tweaking in the AOpen's control panel. In fact, there was no discernible way to disable V-sync, so we set the refresh rate to 100Hz and hoped for the best. Still, the Fusion AGP can be found for around $120, and as of this writing there was a $30 rebate offer on retail versions. It also has a software bundle: the full MOTOCROSS MADNESS and a limited, 11-level version of UNREAL. All in all, not too shabby for less than a hundred bucks. Bron EGA GAME The board's 3D GameGauge performance was mediocre. Part of the problem may have been that flipon V-sync was still on. But I also suspect the generic nature of the drivers came into play. For example, the card barely eked out 81 Business WinMarks-by far the lowest 2D score we've seen in recent testing. MOTORHEAD at 1280x1024 was almost painful to watch, and its 3D GameGauge score was very underwhelming. The bottom line? If you're desperate for an AGP 2x board and can't afford anything else, the PA70 may be a good fit. But if I've only got $90 to spend, I'd rather go out and get a Banshee board. Navigator PA70. $90 for 8MB. AOpen, (888) 8526736. www.aopen.com PROS: It's cheap. CONS: It's generic it's slow, it's not a good deal. VE 39 384.1 3D G Swv2 he Monster Fusion is one of the few boards now shipping that uses SGRAM in place of SDRAM. It also comes with a fan-the Banshee runs a bit warm, especially since Diamond clocks its board higher than does the competition. Be warned also that its 2D WinMark score is deceptive. Diamond supports only 24-bit color for the normal Windows desktop. But we tested all the other boards at 32-bit color, so the Diamond's higher score is partly attributable to the lesser color depth. The SGRAM and higher clock rate show up in the 3D GameGauge tests. The Fusion pumped out the higher score of the two Banshee-based boards we tested. The Voodoo Banshee chip is 3Dfx's low-cost, 2D/3D part. Unlike Voodoo? (or the upcoming Voodoo?), the Banshee lacks a second texture-mapping unit (TMU), meaning that games such as QUAKE II and other multitexture games will run slower than they would with Voodoo2. Savage GAME 277.4 The Monster Fusion is just about the fastest Banshee board you can get. It doesn't quite rank up there with Voodoo2 or TNT, but neither does its price. Monster Fusion. $120 (street) for 16MB. Diamond Multimedia, (800) 468-5846. www.diamondmm.com PROS: Polished utilities, good performance.

"PEDREAKS Wicked 3D Vengeance Number Nine Revolution IV espite having a product name that could have been inspired by the limber Lara Croft, the Vengeance proved somewhat cranky to get running. Earlier driver releases ran pretty well, but the latest driver release, coupled with a new BIOS, crashed our 3D WinBench 99 here's not a lot you can say about a card that claims to have full OpenGL compatibility but won't run QUAKE or QUAKE II in OpenGL mode. That's the main reason for the Revolution IV's abysmal 3D GameGauge score. To add insult to injury, this card simply would not run 3D WinBench 99 on our Pentium II test-bed. Not long ago, the Revolution series ranked as about the best 2D card around, but even that's no longer true. The 2D WinBench scores are pretty low compared to the competition's, and the competition has caught up in terms of 2D image quality. control panel and set it for 1024x640. But be prepared for the fact that games may look a little odd at settings different than their native aspect ratio. The Vengeance isn't quite as speedy a board as the Monster Fusion, though, and there's no software bundle. However, the drivers do support stereoscopic shutter glasses, and Wicked3D will sell you a SON set if you're interested. You can buy the card direct from Wicked3D or from Electronics boa Boutique. If you're really hankering for 3D glasses or oddball resolutions, the Vengeance may be a good choice. But you can find cheaper, faster boards out there. Wicked3D Vengeance. $119. Wicked3D.

There's no TV-out and no other expansion options. While some 3D games (F22ADF) ran fine, others ran poorly (FORSAKEN) or not at all (MOTORHEAD). The only upside to all this is that you can get one loaded up with 32MB of RAM and you can find the card for under $170 (under $120 for 16MB). Steer clear of this card if you're a gamer. It doesn't even make a good companion for Voodoo2. Revolution IV. $120 for 16MB; S170 for 32MB. Number Nine Visual Computing, (781) 6740009. www.nine.com PROS: Supports 32MB of RAM.

Go into the DGA UGE DED:39 A6 TEXCON  Daw WAGA LIFE THIS ALL The Distant Future Is Nine Months Away W omen e'll see the next generation of 3D accelerator chips by October 1999. Most of the companies are keeping mum, but it's likely that products from Rendition, 3Dfx, nVidia, Matrox, and others will hit the streets. But will there be games to use all that horsepower? The 3D chip-makers are adding features like mad and increasing the transistor count along the way. But if there are no games out there that use some advanced feature, then it's not of much value to gamers. Rendition has shelved the V3300 (Redline) and is busy work ing on its next-generation part. The company has vowed to make its schedules this time. Not much is known about the detailed specs of the 4400, but it may have up to 16MB of embedded memory. The next-generation part from nVidia may well support rendering methods other than triangles. This means that nVidia will have come full circle since its original, ill-fated NV1, which used quad patches for rendering. The world may finally be catching up with them. With Voodoo behind it, 3Dfx will be playing catch-up in the features game. The company cannot afford to miss the boat on 32-bit rendering, stencil buffers, and other features. If 3Dfx loses the affection of high-end users, its cachet will vanish, and it will be just another chip-maker. It's a tough position to be in. There are also signs that Matrox is hard at work on something. It fell just a bit short with the G200, but it's certainly not as far behind as the original Mystique was. Maybe Matrox can pull even with the rest of the pack in its next-generation part www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 "

More interesting is that Skywell ships a version of Powerstrip, the Swiss Army knife of graphics card tweaking tools. It lets you do some very useful things, like setting a universal refresh rate. It also allows you to get into big trouble by altering the clock rate of the graphics memory he V3400TNT differentiates itself by offering TV-in as well as TV-out. However, while you can perform video capture with the TV-input, the capture rate will be limited since there's no hardware compression. You can capture still frames as well. The 3D GameGauge performance of the V3400TNT lags slightly behind the top TNT performers, but it's certainly not bad. The 2D and 3D WinBench scores are pretty typical for a TNT product. The card ships with Rage Software's INCOMING and a set of video capture and playback tools. The only odd behavior I noticed was in F22ADF's opening splash screen, which showed some image corruption. There were no other apparent image-quality issues with the card. The most recent drivers seem very stable, and the control panel is a some. what cleaner variant of the RIVA TNT reference panel. ASUS has done a good job of offering driver updates on its past graphics products, which gives us a greater level of confidence than in the past.

AGP-124005 55 3D G Expo de los pad PiS Multimedia Sand The 3D API Wars News From the Front here have been a number of casualties in the 3D API skirmish, and as the dust settles three combatants remain standing: Glide, OpenGL, and Direct3D. OpenGL made its way into the gaming space thanks in large part to the fact that John Carmack and the crew at id decided to use it for QUAKE and QUAKE II. Most chip-makers have developed OpenGL ICDs (installable client drivers), but we have not heard of any current games planning to ship that are OpenGL-only. Some titles, like Jane's WWII FIGHTERS, run on OpenGL but also on Direct3D and Glide. Still, OpenGL will be around, and since OpenGL drivers have arrived from most major chipand board-makers, OpenGL-only titles may yet materialize. OpenGL and Direct3D will begin to merge in Microsoft's Fahrenheit, which should arrive with DirectX8 sometime in 2000. Glide has been 3Dfx's way of allowing game developers to get the most out of the different Voodoo chipsets, and it still finds favor with developers. Now that 3Dfx has entered the 2D/3D chip market with its Banshee and its upcoming Voodoo3, 3Dfx may sustain Glide as a viable alternative to DirectX. But we've seen fewer Glide-only titles of late; it's more likely that games support Glide in addition to DirectX Meanwhile, Microsoft has poured tremendous resources into improving Direct3D, and to the company's credit, DirectX6 has come a long way indeed. We've seen games of all genres run well on it. Microsoft is now working on DirectX7, due out probably about the middle of this year. New features will include extensions, a longtime feature of OpenGL. This will allow a chip-maker with a new, killer rendering effect to expose that feature to games via Direct3D. This lack of extensibility has been a sore spot for chip-makers; in the past they had to wait for Microsoft to revise Direct3D in order to get their fea tures implemented. In addition, DirectX7 will have transform-andlighting (T/L) acceleration. In other words, if a chip-maker wants to take T/L work off the host to make it go faster, that will be possible. Another cool effect due in DirectX is environment mapping, whereby a game can take an entire scene and turn it into a texture to be used for reflections in, say, flight-sim cockpit canopies. Even though the 3D API field has narrowed to three, you still need to read those system requirements on the box. Most cards support Direct3D and OpenGL, which covers the majority of games currently shipping, but some titles are still Glide-only.-Dave Salvator 104 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"SPEED REAKS Almost There he following cards were not quite ready as we went to press, but they will definitely warrant consideration when they ship. And when these cards are primed to hit the market, you can bet we'll be the first to put their feet to the fire. is that users don't need it, most games don't support it, and it would slow things down anyway. Voodoo3 smells like a stopgap product; other offerings give users a choice of running at 16-bit color or true color. If nothing else, this relegates the card to consumers only, since 3D modeling users on a budget will want the true color output of an ATI or TNT board. From the gamer's perspective, though, Voodoo3 is interesting. AGP 2x transfers of vertex (polyg on) data will help keep the chip from being idle. By the time it ships, we may see the first Katmai systems. For users who have been slot limited. Voodoo promises hiah performance while taking up only a single AGP slot. higher clock rate, but also run cooler at that higher rate. If the yield is good, it can also be cheaper, since the chip is physically smaller. The TNT2 will not add additional 3D features, but it will support 32MB of RAM, AGP 4x, and digital flat-panel displays. In fact, at the higher clock rate made possible made by the 0.25micron chip density, the TNT may once again take the performance leadership. Until we have products in hand, though, it's too difficult to say. MOTORHEAD running at 1280x1024 due to driver problems. I suspect there's a lot of horsepower unused by the current state of the drivers. The Rage 128 also supports DVD acceleration, including motion compensation and fast MPEG2 decoding. Overall, the card looks extremely promising, and we'll wring it out thoroughly once we g et final drivers. We're already seeing prices for 32MB Rage Fury cards well under $180 on the Internet, so it's not far off. If ATI can work out its driver issues, the Rage Fury may well be the fastest performer in games as well as synthetic benchmarks. 3Dlabs the category of \"missed it by that much.\" The Rage Fury is based on ATI's Rage 128 accelerator, which is not just a warmed-over Rage Pro but has been redesigned from the ground up. It has dual texture-mapping engines and will ship with Direct3D and OpenGL drivers. The Fury will support most of the 3D features that its competition does, including stencil-buffering; bump-mapping: and 16., 24., or 32-bit z-buffers. About the only thing it lacks is anisotropic filtering, which isn't commonly used today. I'd hoped the card would be ready for review in this roundup, but it wasn't quite there. Still, what I saw looked very promising. Even with beta drivers, the card installed without a hitch, and it posted just about the fastest 2D performance we've seen. In fact, many of these cards score so high on the Business WinBench that we're fast approaching the limits of the benchmark, and the Rage Fury cranks out Business WinMarks like there's no tomorrow. The 3D WinBench 99 score was also the highest we've ever seen, but its game performance trails a bit. The curious thing I noticed was that 32-bit benchmarks ran only marginally slower than 16-bit game tests. Either ATI has really tweaked the 32-bit performance or the drivers need more tuningmaybe both. At any rate, until we see more 32-bit source textures and multitexture games, 32-bit rendering won't be prevalent in games. But MOTORHEAD looked beautiful in true color mode. Unfortunately, we couldn't get nVidia RIVA Vanta and TNT2 he Vanta is essentially a TNT with a 64-bit memory interface instead of 128-bits. It will probably run games slower than the standard TNT, despite being a 0.25-micron part. The TNT2 (or whatever its final name may be) is more interesting. It's essentially the TNT taken down to a 0.25-micron semiconductor process. By itself, this has a couple of benefits—the chip can run at a Permedid S The Permedia 3 is 3Dlabs' first chip designed around DirectX (DirectX6 in this case). At the same time, the company hasn't forgotten its OpenGL roots. One of the most interesting features of the card is that it can predict what texture data it will need next and retrieve it before it's needed. This can reduce delays while texture data is fetched from system memory. It also supports the usual DirectX6 feature set, such as stencil buffers and bump-mapping. Like most of the new chips out on the market, it has two rendering pipelines. Look for Permedia 3 cards to hit the streets about the time you read this. CGW Making the Right Choice 3Dfx Voodoo3 t last November's Comdex, 3Dfx announced its Voodoo, which is essentially Banshee with a second TMU, running at up to 183MHz (depending on the model). Because of the tight, single-chip integration and high clock rate, Voodoo can achieve Voodoo2 SLI speeds in 3D graphics but can run at higher resolutions than can Voodoo2 SLI. Its 2D speed should be as fast or faster than Banshee. What Voodoo promises is raw speed, but it gives up some features in the process. Some of the signature features of the competition are missing, such as anisotropic filtering, bump-mapping, and stencil buffers. Voodoo supports only 16MB of onboard RAM. Although it supports AGP 2x speeds for moving data over the bus, it does not texture out of system memory-it still needs to copy whole textures over the bus. Also missing is 32-bit 3D rendering output. The marketing spin from 3Dfx ooking at the cards in this roundup, my personal favorite of the shipping cards is the Magic TNT. It's simple and unpretentious and damned fast. Of the rest, the ASUS TNT board offers the best value in a TNT card, while the Monster Fusion is the best of the Banshee boards. As you read this, the ATI Rage Fury is shipping. I wanted to like this card a lot but can't really pass judgment because of the beta drivers. I suspect it will be a strong contender, though. Of all the cards we've reviewed in the past four months, the ones to beat remain the STB Velocity 4400 and the Canopus Spectra 2500. The Spectra is more expandable, but pricey. The Velocity 4400 remains a solid performer and a great value. Recent price drops have resulted in Velocity 4400s at less than $140 on the street. Of course, for the ideal setup, you should consider adding a Voodoo? card to the mixbut with fewer Glide-only games coming out, that may not be as necessary as it once was. 100 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  MARCH 1999 www.computergaming.com "

A Turtle Beach Montego handled audio chores. We tested each card with a clean Windows 98 installation and with only DirectX6, ZD benchmarks, and test games installed. Our test suite consisted of 3D WinBench 99, WinBench 99 Business WinMark, our own 3D GameGauge, and Motorhead 2.2. 3D GameGauge 1.0 consists of six game tests: QUAKE, QUAKE II, F22ADF, INCOMING, TUROK, and FORSAKEN. The average frame rates are calculated by the game, and the 3D GameGauge score is the sum of the averages. We ran the games at 800x600x16, except MOTORHEAD, which we ran at 1280x1024x16. Interestingly, despite having 16MB of RAM, the Banshee boards could not run with trilinear filtering enabled on MOTORHEAD at 1280x1024, reporting an \"insufficient memory\" error, so all the MOTORHEAD tests were run with trilinear filtering off. The Business Graphics WinMark tests were at 1024x768x32-bit color unless the board supported only 24-bit color. We ran 3D WinBench 99 at 1024x768x16-bit, triple buffered. With the excep tion of the Number Nine board, all the shipping cards could run all the tests. Because we used a different test-bed and current versions of MOTORHEAD and the ZD benchmarks, it's tough to go back and compare to previous roundups. To make it a bit easier, we retested the Velocity 4400 and the Hercules Terminator Beast. These were the top and bottom performers in our last roundup, and should give a frame of reference. We also tested the Monster 3D II in 3D GameGauge as a reference point. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. MARCH 1999 "

"IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE 3Dfx Jilts Diamond, Creative TechWatch Rendition RRedline Multimedia Accelerator This product was originally slated for arrival sometime in Q1 '99, but Rendition has scrapped it. Instead, they're going back to the drawing board to design an entirely new part, whose name will most likely be 14400. Not much is known about the V4400 as of yet, but it appears that it will have embedded video memory, which may provide a performance advantage. ETA: Unkown. here's never a dull moment in the graphics business. 3Dfx recently announced its acquisi. tion of board-maker STB Systems. For 3Dfx, the deal creates an entrée into the lucrative system-maker (system OEM) graphics market, which represents the lion's share of the PC graphics business. 3Dfx has had some success in this area, with both Voodooand Banshee, but it's looking to expand its prospects. Taking a cue from the industry's volume leaders, 3Dfx is looking to join the ranks of ATI and Matrox, both of which are integrated chip/board-makers. Future 3Dfx products will carry 3Dfx branding, and the chip-maker will tightly integrate its chip production with STB's board production facilities to achieve faster time to market. Not everyone is jumping for joy over the deal, how ever, since it means that 3Dfx will no longer supply chips to other board manufacturers. Diamond, Creative, Hercules, and others have been successful selling 3Dfx-based cards. As to how 3Dfx smoothed over this abrupt change, one 3Dfx official said, \"Have you ever broken up with a girlfriend?\" Chip-maker nVidia can't be pleased with the deal, either, since STB has been the No. 1 mover of nVidia chips, including the RIVA 128, the RIVA 128zx, and, most recently, the RIVA TNT. While STB will continue to sell TNT boards, it's highly unlikely that any future STB boards will use nVidia chips. The 3Dfx/STB deal still needs to be approved by both companies' stockholders and by regulatory bodies, including the Federal Trade Commission. The mood at nVidia in the wake of the announcement was actually very upbeat. A spokesman there said that the deal leaves nVidia in a stronger position because it will now be the top contender in the chip-maker business. Further, it's probable that companies like Diamond and Creative-all bracing for life without 3Dfx-will be keen to shore up their relationship with nVidia. We gamers have yet to feel the full implications of the 3Dfx deal, but one advantage of the former arrangement for consumers has been that board-makers using the same 3Dfx chipset have had to compete with one another on price. While 3Dfx will still have to compete against other boards using other chipsets, the self-generated price pressure factor will disappear. Stay tuned to 3D IronWorks for more about this acquisition and details about Voodoos.-Dave Salvator AMD K6-3 AMD's next CPU, the K6-3, will retain AMD's 3DNow! for accelerating transforms and lighting for 3D rendering. K6-3's biggest improvement will be its onboard 256KB Level 2 (L2) cache, which will run at the CPU's core clock speed. Initial clock speed will mostly likely be 400MHz, and with its onboard L2, K6-3 will be even more competitive than a Pentium II. ETA: Q1 '99 AMD K7 AMD's revamped high-performance CPU.

"special advertising section Why NOT-RACINGY another With Jeff Gordon on board, we had one decision, Racing Sim or not? Fortunately, everyone agreed the world didn't need another Racing Sim. create a game that makes up for it in other ways by providing a whole new racing experience. Fritos For us, it was about being a smart driver and thinking on your toes at 300 MPH. First of all, if you've seen Jeff on the racetrack, you already know that he's all about action and excitement. So it came as no surprise to hear that the game he wanted to make was action and excitement times 10. It's not that he didn't have an interest in doing a racing simulation, but even the average gamer knows that simulations never really capture the full, real life experience whether it be racing, flying, or battle games. Well, if this is the case, imagine how much less a racing simulation mimicked the actual racing experience to a professional race car driver who also happens to be a threetime Winston Cup Champion. You see, Jeff always felt that racing simulations never really captured the speed, the competition, and the pulse-pounding exhilaration of jockeying for position while flying by another car at over 200 miles an hour. We totally agreed. Also, keep in mind that simulations don't always equal fun. For example, the few racing simulations that came the closest to being 'realistic' were loaded with the small details such as tweaking a car's performance to shave a fraction of a second off lap times. While this helps to create a more realistic experience, it doesn't necessarily make a game fun. In the end, that's what it came down to: Racing Sim vs. Fun Arcade Racer. So, the direction we decided to take was to keep it somewhat grounded in reality with a physics model that players could actually feel, while giving them a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, but at the same time, making the game easily accessible. So, if it were possible to capture the excitement of professional stock car racing in a video game, than we would have gone that route and created the best racing sim ever. However, since it's almost impossible to simulate the experience that Jeff feels behind the wheel of his own race car, we decided to To accomplish this and get the level of competition we all wanted, it quickly became clear we must heighten the experience. Oval tracks and straightalways are exciting when you've got a screaming engine over your shoulder and howling wind rattling both windows, but on a computer screen that just won't cut it. won't cut it. 256.ph 437 17pm 4th EVERYONE DEVELOPED BY Windows 95 Real Sports PC CD-ROM COMEDY PlayStation ESRB ASC Games is a registered trademark of American Softworks Corporation.  1998 American Softworks Corporation.

"So, we projected competitive stock car racing into a world where boundaries didn't exist. We took the iberty to assume that cars would get Faster and faster and track designs would become more exciting and dangerous. These are the elements hat would make this game more competitive and challenging and separate us from all other racing games. And guess what? The more outrageous we made Ehe tracks, the more fun not to mention fast the game became. Think about it for a minute: with a realistic physics model, how fast does a two-ton race car have to be going to make it through a 360 degree loop? As you might imagine it has to be going very, very fast.

"The 100,000-Mile Mark Does That Pentium 166MHz Still Have Another Season Left in It? (MSCONFIG.EXE) to manage your AutoStart programs. With MSCONFIG you can also manage the stuff in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Since computers are a big part of how I make my living, upgrading fairly often makes sense for me. But like anyone, I have a budget for computers, mine just happens to be bigger (the wonders of business tax deductions help). Most of us don't have big budgets, though, and many of us have to live with hand-me-downs or used computers. Or it could be a matter of choice---spending a et's talk about living within your means. I drive a 1992 Ford Explorer with 83,000 miles on it. I say this not to brand myself as some kind of aging yuppie-though probably am-but to point out that this vehicle is now seven years old. Seven years ago, we were barely into the 486 era in personal computing, and most of the people reading this are proba bly not using a computer that's seven years old. Still, I've beaten on the issue of fast-moving technology many times. I'm confessing to driving a seven-year-old car to point out that I have a budget for cars. As much as Detroit or Japan might like it, I can't buy a car every two years. Luckily, cars are a relatively mature technology, and I can happily continue cruising well past 100,000 miles. Lately, I've been getting a flurry memory can work wonders in Windows games. Memory, at least, is fairly cheap now. In most Pentium systems, though, more than 64MB doesn't do you any good, and may even slow down your system. So don't get more than 64MB. Beyond dropping more dollars, you can spend some time tuning the performance of your system. All the usual tricks work well. To begin, create a fixed-size swap file. Assuming your disk budget is as tight as your dollar budget, make it a relatively small number, such as 64MB. You do this in the Windows system control panel, under the Performance tab. The virtual memory button will take you to your virtual memory settings. Next, make sure you're not loading unnecessary programs on startup. This eats into both Better than DOOM DOOM, that breakthrough shooter from id Software, ran pretty well on a 66MHz 486. So it stands to reason that a CPU that's 100MHz faster and has other optimizations should do far better. One thing you need to ask yourself is \"How much better can I afford?\" Frame-rate is life in an action game or flight sim, so eye candy becomes a fairly low priority in your budget. What's useful is to use a game like DOOM or DUKE NUKEM 3D (which looks a little better) as a point of reference. Let's assume you get decent performance out of DUKE NUKEM 3D. Let that be LOYD CASE of emails like the one below, so this month I'm going to try to collectively answer all of your tweaking/upgrading questions. Think about how to m aximize tomorrow's purchases when you're making one today. Dear Mr. Case: I own a lowly Pentium 166 (no MMX) and would like to know if UNREAL will run with all the options? Thanks very much. Horsepower-Challenged few grand a year on computer gear simply may not be a high priority, even if you do enjoy computer games. Now, let's think of your computer as having its own budgetthe performance budget. You have a Pentium 166 or a Cyrix-based system or even if you're lucky, a 200MHZ Pentium MMX. Given the demands of today's latest game titles, how can you best use that limited resource? memory and valuable system resources. Also, some memory resident software can either eat CPU cycles or create a frenzy of disk activity. If you don't have Windows 98, take the time to download one of the Ziff-Davis benchmarks—but be aware that any of them is a big download or spend $5 and buy a WinBench 99 CD, which also comes with Audio WinBench and 3D WinBench. While the benchmarks can help you determine how your system's performance changes as you tweak it, the real gem is the Startup Manager. Startup Manager can turn off the autoloading of those pesky applications that are set to AutoStart in the system registry. If you have Windows 98, use the System Configuration Utility your budget standard for graphical eye candy. When you run a newer game, like UNREAL, think about how you can tweak the settings so it doesn't look worse than DUKE 3D. That way, you can manage your expectations. While UNREAL may look gorgeous on a fast Pentium Il with a new 3D accelerator, you probably won't be able to achieve that glossy sheen on your system. Of course, you may have to adjust the resolution as well. Face it: You won't be able to run QUAKE Il at 800x600—that's a fact of Dear Horse, First off, not even my daughter's friends call me \"Mr. Case,\" but I do feel your pain. Will UNREAL run on your Pentium 166 with all the goodies turned up? Well, in a word, no. But with some trade-offs and system tweaks, it will run with an acceptable frame-rate. Here are some things for you to try. Cheers Loyd Maximizing the Budget First, take a look at your system and make sure you're getting the best possible use out of it. If you don't have the money to spend on expensive upgrades, consider at least moving to 64MB of RAM. It's surprising how a little added detract from your enjoyment of a title. Some games, like QUAKE II, won't let you easily tweak many of the graphics enhancements, but QUAKE Il does support many 116 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"Tech Tips Here are a couple of frequent email questions I've been getting. I just got a system with a PCI modem in it, but the ping times are much slower than with my old 28.8 modem. What gives? It is a sad truth that PCI modems are slower than their ISA counterparts. There's only one PCI modem chipset out there, and it is a \"Winmodem,\" meaning that the CPU does most of the actual work. The PCI modem simply provides the connection and translation to the phone line. My advice is, don't get a PCI modem. If your system comes with one, get an ISA modem or, better yet, an external modem. Better still, get a cable modem or DSL. AGGRESSOR I've heard that AGP 2x boards (like the RIVA TNT) don't work well with K6-2. Is that correct? The problem wasn't the K6-2, but the so-called \"Super 7\" motherboards. The latest AGP drivers seemed to have fixed most of the problems, though you may have to actually get a new version of the motherboard itself. Check also with your graphics card vendor for recent drivers. In most cases, the new motherboard AGP drivers and graphics card drivers have fixed the problem. (ALi can be found at www.acerlabs.com. VIA is at www.via.com.tw. SIS is at www.sis.com.tw.) different resolutions. So start at 320x240 and work your way up until your framerate starts to tank. Remember, 320x240 was good enough for DOOM. Don't forget to tweak your game's audio as well. You may get a surprising frame-rate boost by going to four audio streams rather than eight, assuming you can dial that down in the game. The loss in ear candy is often less noticeable than reduced graphics goodies. by new technology. If a reader asks me if he or she should get a RIVA TNT board for their Pentium 200, I tend to steer them to a Voodoo2 card instead. The RIVA TNT is a great chip, but if you're upgrading in the future, your new system will almost certainly have a fast AGP card (maybe even a TNT-based board). But the reliable Voodoowill come over to a new system just fine. So think about how to maximize tomorrow's purchases when you're making one today. That rule applies for any component purchase. Buying a new hard drive? Get one that supports UltraDMA/33. Looking at a new monitor? Get a big one-a 17inch or 19-inch monitor. Need a sound card? Get a good PCI sound card if you have a free PCI slot. To save in the long run, get a component upgrade that will play well with a future upgrade. F16: Aggressor Copyright 1998 GST Limited. All Rights Reserved. Distributed under license from Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Limited RTFB One way to avoid the frustration of games running deathly slow on your rig is to read the system requirements on the game's box before you buy it. I know it sounds dopey, but it can save you much pain and suffering. Some turn-based strategy games might run fine, despite the difference in system performance between what's recommended and what you have. You may just have to wait longer between turns while the Al moves. But if it's a realtime strategy game or an action game, it's best to get something else. Part of budgeting is setting priorities, and an important priority is to avoid things that won't work. I may be able to put 15-inch-wide slicks on my Explorer, but it won't make driving in snow any easier. Mach 2 is faster than a .22 caliber bullet. The Performance Dilemma Living within a performance budget is sometimes frustrating. Think of it as a learning process. As you tweak your system, you may learn more about configurations, Windows, and the Device Manager than you ever wanted. But knowledge is a good thing. So when a hot new title comes out that screams for huge system requirements, don't despair. If you're willing to make a few sacrifices in eye candy, audio fidelity, and resolution, you may find that game playable. CGW When You Do Buy When you buy an add-on, buy with an eye to the future.

"You're Making HARDWARE The Generation of Extreme Control Metot menye d Shot Patent (/) r na L eat can kill PC components. As the temperature rises above acceptable levels (over 110 degrees Fahrenheit), it begins to cook semiconductor components. In the short term, you may just experience occasional lockups. In the long term, electromigration may occur. whereby actual molecular elements within the chip move, creating unwanted gaps or unwanted merging of the ultrafine lines that move electrons within a chip. This can permanently damage the microscopic traces inside of CPUs, memory chips, and other semiconductor chips. Needless to say, it's important to manage heat, and there are two ways to do it: locally and globally (no, this isn't about the ozone layer). On the local level, you can cool components that get hot. Most people are aware of CPU fans, but we're now seeing cooling fans on graphics cards. If you have a high-performance hard drive (7,200RPM or higher), you can find hard-drive cooling kits that move hot air away from this critical component. But where do you want all that hot air to go? Most ATX power supp lies have a fan that sucks air out of the case. That's a good step, but adding a little muffin fan (one of those cheap black fans) to the front of your PC case definitely helps. These cost only a few dollars. Orient the fan so it exhausts air out of the case (if there are nearby holes). One last tip: Don't run your rig with the case open, unless you have a big fan blowing directly on the motherboard. Even then, it's not a good idea. Systems are designed to cool most efficiently with the case closed. Running with your case open can actually create local hotspots. Also, make sure all your I/O device shelves have either cards or blanks insert ed for the same reason. With the addition of these few low-cost items (are you listening all you overclockers out there?) you can beat the heat and keep your rig lockup-free. -Loyd Case You've been gaming ever since you got weaned on Pong as a kid.

"REVIEW  MICROSOFT DIGITAL SOUND SYSTEM 80 GAMING Rumble from Redmond EDITORS CHOICE HARDWARE by Loyd Case lowly but surely, Microsoft is expanding its hardware reaches, entering markets that will push technologies it wants enhanced. The DSS 80s are a good example. AS with all Microsoft products, the company adds its own twist to the COMPUTER GAMING ***** WORLD idea of computer speakers, and they are superbly executed. But it comes at a cost that may be too high for many folks. The satellites look vaguely like black versions of the tentacle crea. tures from LucasArts DAY OF THE TENTACLE adventure game. The bass unit, which contains the amplifier, looks very much like a car battery. However, that \"car battery\" hides a 76-watt amplifier-44 watts for the bass unit and 16 watts per channel for the satellites. Bass is provided by a 5-1/2-inch bass driver and a 5-1/2inch passive radiator. The DSS 80s are fully digital, meaning you can run them without a sound card-provided you've got a working USB connection and Windows 98. In fact, it was a pleasure to install them, as Windows 98 auto-configures the speakers. The right satellite has buttons along the top to control the main volume, bass volume, and a mute switch. The speakers have an auto-power mode, meaning they sleep when there is no audio playing, but lack a headphone jack. The overall tonal balance is pretty good, but with the equalizer bypassed, they show a definite tendency to sound bright on musical material. They can get loud, but at really high volumes you can sense that they're straining. The software equalizer, which works with or without a sound card, can hide a multitude of sins with careful adjustment. The stereo imaging was quite good; instrument placement was very easy to pick out. Also, when pumping out sound from a Diamond Monster Sound MX300, these speakers had very clear A3D audio imaging. If you do use digital audio mode Cie., play audio through the USB port to be rendered by the speakers), expect to take a huge performance hit in DirectSound3D. In APPEAL: Gamer's wanting heavily tweakable, solid audio. PROS: Good sound quality, software equalizer CONS: USB digital audio without a sound card eats CPU cycles: pricey. REQUIREMENTS: DOS 5.0 for sound card-only support Pentium 166 or better with USB and Windows 98. Price: $259 Manufacturer: Microsoft Redmond, WA (425) 882-8080 www.microsoft.com/hardware Audio WinBench with 16 audio streams at 22Khz, 8-bit resolution, the DirectSound3D test produced CPU usage of 19.6 percent-higher than most PCI sound cards. But the \"3D audio\" is laughable, and it was often impossible to get a sense of anything beyond front/left or front/right. The DSS 80s sound pretty good, but cost a bundle. They're in the same category as the Cambridge Soundworks Microworks, but take up less room. But at that price, they're in heady territory, and that may be too big a bite for most users. CGW MICHAEL FALCONER REVIEW GAMESTICK 3D USB Stick It by Loyd Case ticks like the Gamestick 3D are inevitably a compromise, but the CH spin on the 3D joystick is better than most. And what's more, CH is now shipping a COMPUTER GAMING **** WORLD USB version, which makes installation a bit easier, though at the cost of DOS compatibility. Installation was a snap. though the stick wasn't detected automatically on bootup like other USB devices I've tested. When I would plug it in while the system was running, though, the device was detected. The drivers installed cleanly and calibration was a snap. There are \"only\" four usable buttons, and no programming tool. The Gamestick 3D is a symmetric stick, meaning it should be equally comfortable for either left-handed or right-handed folks. Being a USB device, it doesn't work in DOS. In fact, it wouldn't even work with REDGUARD, a recent, Windows-friendly DOS release, when run in a DOS box under Windows 98. I tested the Gamestick on a system with a USB keyboard and mouse, and all three devices played together nicely. In addition, the Gamestick 3D USB ships with CH's utility set, including a spiffy Windows-based calibration tool. I took the Gamestick for a tour through EUROPEAN AIR WAR, FORSAKEN, and QUAKE II. EAW worked great, though the throttle slider seemed too short for delicate adjustments. What's worse is that throttle placement is very awkward, and the throttle slider seemed hard to reach for my stubby fingers. The rotational axis, used for the rudder, didn't offer really fine control for lining up shots. It also suffers from the \"walking-andchewing gum\" effect. Sometimes you'd inadvertently shift the rudder or the yank the stick left or right when you really only wanted to adjust one parameter. QUAKE II lets you configure the stick, and it was handy using the \"throttle\" for sliding left and right. But the best game I found for the stick are six-degree of freedom games like FORSAKEN, where after some experimentation, I was able to set up the Gamestick 3D to work very intuitively. This may be just the thing for the upcoming release of DESCENT 3. If you're willing to work within the stick's limitations, then it may serve you well. But with other lowcost offerings on the market from Logitech, Thrust Master, and Microsoft, you might do better to shop around. CGW APPEAL: The Gamestick is a balanced, ambidextrous stick for action games and light flight sims PROS: Good for leftor right-handed users; twist handle. CONS: Some people don't like the twist handle; throttle placement is awkward. REQUIREMENTS: Windows 98 and a USB-equipped system.

"REVIEW. TOSHIBA SD-M1202 DVD DRIVE CAMING DVD—Straight, No Chaser EDITORS: CHOICE HARDWAR by Loyd Case nyone who has ever shopped for a DVD drive knows that they've been much slower than the fastest CD-ROM drives...until now. The third-generation DVD drives are COMPUTER ING WORLD now shipping, and most sport up to 5x DVD performance and 32x CD-ROM performance. Among these new entries is Toshiba's thirdgeneration drive, the SD-M1202. The 1202 wasn't entirely unfamiliar to me. I'd just completed testing a host of off-the-shelf PCs, and almost all the rigs that came with DVD drives came with this one. There's a good reason: It's fast, stable, and well-mannered. The 1202 is an ATAPI device that connects to the standard EIDE port on most motherboards. Although it supports mode 2 DMA transfers, it's not an UltraDMA device. However since it can handle DMA transfers of data, the CPU usage is pretty low. It does suffer from one problem common to most high-speed CDROM drives: It spins down after a few minutes and has a spin-up delay that can be annoying in some games (although the delay doesn't seem as severe as in other IDE drives). We ran the WinBench 98 CD tests on our 400MHZ Pentium Il test rig. The CD WinMark came in at 1,590, right about on par for a 32x CD-ROM drive. The data transfer rate at the outer tracks measured at 4,870KB/sec, or 33x speed. Access time was 115ms-slightly slower than the best CD-ROM drives, but certainly respectable. CPU usage came in at 4.29 percent. Toshiba is offering a kit with a Reelmagic hardware DVD decoder board, but you won't find it under the Toshiba name. Look for it under names like Hi-Val or Pacific Digital. The full kit will probably run a bit device. APPEAL: Anyone looking for a DVD drive that doesn't compromise on speed. PROS: Fast DVD and CD-ROM performance; good DVD playback. CONS: Not an UltraDMA device; a bit more expensive than a 32x CD-ROM drive REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 90 with free EIDE connection. Price $135 (street) Manufacturer: Toshiba Irvine, CA (949) 457-0777 www.toshiba.com/taecdpd/ more than $225 on the street, but you should be able to get the bare drive for as little as $135 if you purchase from a mail-order outfit. The Sigma Designs Reelmagic decoder is a competent performer, and the image quality in action scenes on DVD movies reproduced without noticeable artifacting. At these prices, there's almost no reason not to make the move to DVD. Its performance is nearly as fast as the fastest CD-ROM drives, a it works well, and it isn't terribly expensive. That's a tough combination to beat. CGW MICHAEL FALCONER CAMING REVIEW DIAMOND MONSTER SOUND MX300 EDITORS: G Diamond's Flexible Flyer CHOICE I wanna by Loyd Case like it. I like it a lot. Diamond's follow-on to its successful MX200 is a hit. The MX300 uses Aureal's new Vortex 2 chip, which is quite a bit more powerful than its predecessor, the Vortex 1 (used to power numerous sound cards). Vortex 2 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD * * * * * offers full hardware support for A3D 2.0 (Aureal's latest version of its positional 3D audio technology) and DirectSound3D. It currently supports Creative Labs' EAX to DirectSound in software, but Diamond claims it will be moving EAX support into hardware with a later driver release. The MIDI audio is much improved over that of the Vortex 1. though not up to the standards set by the MX200. Still, it sounds good. The MX300 supports 64 hardware MIDI voices and an additional 64 in software. Best of all, there's a connector for a wavetable daughtercard, and I wasted no time connecting a Roland SCD-15 Sound Canvas daughtercard. The MX300 also supports fourspeaker DirectSound3D, if you want the fullest possible positional 3D imaging, and its A3D imaging sounds even better than that of the Vortex 1. Aureal's A3D 2.0 supports four speakers, though the rear speakers just fill in the rear information; the front speakers still handle the bulk of the 3D audio imaging. While playing HALF-LIFE, I spent a lot of time spinning in circles to hear the positional 3D effects, and they were quite good. (Remember, of course, that different ears will localize 3D audio with varying ability.) Overall, digital audio sounds very clean, and no hissing at high gain was apparent. There's even a terrific 10-band graphic equalizer for maximum tonal control. In Audio WinBench testing, CPU usage was a bit higher than we'd like. Audio WinBench reported that the MX300 ate 7.1 percent of a Pentium II 400MHz CPU with 16 voices (22KHz, 8-bit resolution) streaming through DirectSound3D. For comparison, Sound Blaster Live APPEAL: Those looking for the ultimate in flexibility in a sound card. PROS: Clean digital audio: A3D support: good MIDI: highly expandable. CONS: CPU utilization could be better. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 90 or better, 16MB RAM, 16MB hard drive space. used 3.4 percent on the same test. Still, the DirectSound imaging is very good through two speakers, and it's possible this will decrease with subsequent drivers—we saw a 30-percent drop from Diamond's beta 2 drivers to the shipping version. One other downer: The ThrustMaster Rage 3D gamepad won't work, but just about every other controller works fine. The bottom line: The MX300 is a great buy, offering superb sound quality, solid 3D audio performance and compatibility, and impressive expandability. Now, where's my checkbook?

"REVIEW  LEADER RETOUR DE FORCE Force Feed-Lack HARDWARE by Dave Salvator t seems the computer hardware industry moves in swarms. A technology gets hot, and suddenly a pack of companies are building products around it. Force feedback is just such an animal, and the swarm COMPUTER GAMING WORLD has converged on force-feedback wheels, with products coming from Microsoft, Logitech, ThrustMaster SC&T, ACT Labs, and Saitek just to name a few. Well, enter yet another offering, this time from Guillemot International. Dubbed the Race Leader Retour de Force (where it's returning from I have no idea), this wheel developed by Guillemot unfortunately looks a lot better than it actually works. The initial warning sign is the flimsy clamping system, which doesn't do a very good job of actually holding the wheel in place. Four suction cups on the bottom of the unit do an adequate job of holding the wheel, but they don't combine well with the clamps. The result is that the wheel wiggles around at the most inopportune moments, which often leads to spectacular wrecks. The unit also arrives with the abominable wall-wart power ***** supply, which eats most of an AC socket. The driver installation is pretty straightforward, although it requires two reboots for the wheel to be ready. As for the game performance, the news doesn't get much better. Taking the Retour through NEED FOR SPEED III and VIPER RACING both force-feedback driving titles, the wheel's force rendering was barely discernible, and what forces could be felt were very weak. The wheel's all-plastic construction felt very flimsy, and its unwieldy pedals made quick braking and returning to the accelerator more difficult than it should be. One cool thing the unit does have is a view-hat APPEAL: Gamers who are looking for a futuristic-looking wheel PROS: Good-looking design. CONS: Very weak force rendering, very flimsy clamping system; club-footed pedals, redundant buttons. Price: $129.99 Manufacturer: Guillemot International Montreal, Canada (877) Guillemot (toll-free) www.guillemot.com/usa2/index2.html that can be very handy in titles like INTERSTATE '76, in which you have to worry about where opponents are and may want to quickly look behind or to the side. In addition to working with Directinput titles, the Retour also supports Immersion's I-Force standard, so force-feedback gaming titles that have been written using i-Force will work with it. In a crowded field of products, the Retour fails to deliver the goods. Its price point might make it appealing compared to the Microsoft force-feedback wheel, but the money you save isn't worth the performance you lose. CGW PHOTO: Michael Falconer REVIEW  YAMAHA YST-MS28 GAMING Back in Black EDITORS CHOICE by Dave Salvator amaha is no stranger to the audio world, and has been in the PC speaker market for several years, delivering competent, although not outstanding speakers. With the arrival of the COMPUTER GAMING WORLD YST-MS28s, that has changed. Here's a pair of solid speakers for about $60 that deliver more volume than Cambridge SoundWorks' venerable PC Works low-cost units, and have audio quality on par with Boston Acoustics' BA-635s. That they come in black is gravy. Setting the 28s is a snap, and because the power transformer is built into the woofer unit, there's no wall-wart to supply the unit power. The 28s use the now-conventional small satellites (each has a 2-inch driver rated at 5 watts per side) and woofer unit, which has a single 5-inch driver that gets 15 watts. The bass unit has two line. level inputs, and both satellites also plug into the bass unit. The only downer here was Yamaha's deci sion to put the 1/8-inch headphone jack downstairs on the bass unit rather than on one of the satellites. The 28s are yet another pair of small speakers that seem almost to fact, the 28s develop very good volume level before going into audible distortion, and while they may not get you an eviction notice, they'll still do an adequate job of annoying your neighbors in the next apartment. tested the 28s on a Dell Dimension R450 that has a Vortex2-based Turtle Beach Montego II, and the 28s produced good 3D imaging in HALF-LIFE, which supports the A3D positional audio standard. I also ran them through Audio WinBench, and again the 28s produced good 3D imaging in DirectSound3D tests. If you want to spruce up your sonic setup-and want a great bargain-Yamaha's YST-MS285 are a serious contender. CGW defy the laws of physics by producing a lot of volume from a very small package. Frequency response is good across the board, with punchy bass and clean mid-range and high-end response. Music CDs sounded excellent, with my only complaint being that on some recordings the stereo imaging felt a bit narrow. But with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band infamous for making speakers beg for mercy, the 28s held their own. Gaming audio s ounded equally impressive. A spin through NEED FOR SPEED III and HALF-LIFE produced very good sounds throughout, and neither explosions nor weapon fire ever sent the speakers into distortion. In APPEAL: Gamers looking to perk up their existing audio setup PROS: Great price, solid sound very good volume output top-mounted volume and power controls. CONS: Stereo imaging is somewhat narrow; headphone jack mounted on the woofer unit.

"REVIEW. GALLANT AUDIOSTORM MT7 F/X In the Flat HARDWARE by Dave Salvator he trend in PC speakers has been headed in two directions: smaller and cheaper. But Gallant Computer has a different approach: Use flatpanel technology and couple it with a Dolby ProLogic COMPUTER GAMING converter to try to entice would-be home entertainment buffs and gamers. A different approach it is and it works pretty well, but for gamers it seems like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. Setting up the MT7s is pretty straightforward, although the fact that the center channel and bassunit speaker are permanently attached means you wind up either screwing the sonic imaging or having to place a bass unit on top of your monitor. We opted for the latter configuration and, to the unit's credit, didn't see any interference on our test monitor's image. The MT7s include a \"universal audio adapter\" (UAD), which converts two-channel stereo input to 4.1 Dolby Prologic output. One problem with any multispeaker array setup is cable clutter, that is, having to trip over the cables used WORLD to feed the rearchannel speakers. The other downer is a clumsy UI found on the UAD which controls individual channel volumes, balance, and imaging mode. The MT7s also have a \"Surround\" imaging mode and can add different reverb settings. But most audio we ran wound up having a \"slap-back\" echo effect that sounded awful. Staying in ProLogic mode got rid of this effect. The sound quality isn't bad overall, but it isn't great either. The MT7s don't produce good top-end volume, and when they go into distortion it really isn't pretty. Frequency response for both music and gaming audio is mixed, with weak low-end response, but both mids and highs are pretty well defined. As for 3D audio, the units WO *** produce good imaging, although there was something of a phase-shifter effect when running in ProLogic or Surround modes. Gallant has produced a pretty good offering in the MT7 FIX, but for gamers, these speakers probably aren't the ideal choice, mainly because of their home theater design bias. If you watch DVD movies on your PC and play some games, these might be worthwhile ? speakers, but there are better pure gaming speakers to be had for less & money; this makes the MT7s a less than optimal choice. CGW APPEAL: Gamers looking for a flatpanel Prologic speaker setup. PROS: Good positional 3D audio imaging: decent overall sound quality. CONS: Speakers lack overall volume; no headphone jack; wall-wart power supply. Price: $150 Manufacturer: Gallant Computer Fremont, CA (510) 656-5887 www.gallantcom.com PHOTO: Michael Falconer REVIEW  AIWA SC-C78U SPEAKERS Bass Hit by Dave Salvator y now, most of us have a \"subwoofer\" at our feet when we sit at our PC. Of course, these units aren't true subwoofers, but rather are bass speakers that handle low-end frequency chores for our audio. A small satellite/woofer BEI STANUD COMPUTER WORLD on-the-floor config has become de rigueur among lowcost speaker offerings. But if space is at a premium, you may not want a woofer on the floor. Aiwa, Sony's premium homeaudio subsidiary, may have what you're looking for in its new SCC78U speakers. These units feature a built-in bass speaker in the left channel, and they sound great. But there are a few gotchas to consider. Setting up the units is stupid simple, and, because the power transformer is built in to the leftchannel speaker, there's no wall wart to wrestle with. The 78s also feature a QSound \"spatializer\" that widens the perceived stereo field and a headphone jack that mutes the speakers when used. These speakers feature a four-inch bass driver that gets 14 watts, and each satellite channel gets 7 watts. Aiwa brings a solid reputation from the home-audio world into the PC speaker market, and for pure sound quality these speakers don't disappoint. In fact, with some minor adjustments to tone down the bass volume, these units didn't clip even while playing punchy audio CD music tracks at full vol ume. And they sound very solid across the spectrum, from low-end frequencies to high and everything in between. Gaming audio sounded equally impressive. But there are two flies in the ointment—one minor, the other not so minor. At higher volume settings, the units do give off some audible hiss when sitting idle. A bit more troubling is that the speakers magnetic shielding doesn't prevent the their bass driver from causing some distortion of the monitor's image. This is one of the perils of bringing the bass driver upstairs. This wasn't a problem at lower volume levels, however. If you're an apartment dweller not looking to rattle the rafters that often, Aiwa's latest offering might be just the ticket with their solid sound and readily accessible headphone jack. These guys will also kick out higher volume levels without a complaint, though your monitor may not be so happy. Still, this distortion occurs only at very high volume levels; the units are stellar performers otherwise. CGW * * * * APPEAL: Gamers who want to upgrade their audio setup but don't want a bass speaker on the floor PROS: Very solid sound, good bass response; no wall wart: headphone jack. CONS: Some audible hash when idle: some magnetic interference with monitor at higher volume levels.

Larka hen I was growing up I had a very active imagination that sometimes got me into trouble. But it also led me to read some very good books that delved into, oh, shall we say, darker aspects of society. Among my favorite book series of the time were the adventures of Gord the Rogue in the city of Greyhawk. Gord was a thief, an exceptional thief, and I yearned to be like him. But since my fear of incarceration was stronger than my fantasies, 1 abandoned my plans of being a superthief...until I found a package on my doorstep emblazoned with the title THIEF: THE DARK PROJECT. In THIEF you play the part of Garrett. An established thief of no small skill, Garrett is one of those rare individuals who has the ability Obviously, stealth is your most valuable asset, so slinking along walls and lurking in the shadows is absolutely essential. It's easy to determine how well-hidden you are thanks to a jewel that visibly darkens according to your degree of concealment.

At times had to max out the gamma correction and set my monitor to its brightest setting just to see the barest details. Adding a shuttered lantern to see by would have been a definite plus.

May aving been a big fan of Raven Software since 1993's SHADOWCASTER, I'll admit to being predisposed to liking anything brothers Brian and Steve Raffel dare to conjure. Yet nothing could have prepared me for the dizzying highs, terrifying lows, and outrageous fun of HERETIC II. This game is a blast. A conceptual follow-up to Raven's original HEXEN and HERETIC titles, this is one of the few games of its kind to actually enjoy genuine plot history.

Raven also includes the level editor used to create the game, which runs as a stand-alone Windows app. Alas, neither the publishers nor the designers offer any support for this potentially fun accessory.

First it released SHOGO: MOBILE ARMOR DIVISION, and now it has struck again with BLOOD II: THE CHOSEN, the sequel to the original BLOOD. Picking up where the previous game left off, BLOOD Il features the antihero Caleb as he continues to wreak bloody vengeance on the Cabal. Players may play as Caleb or one of the other \"Chosen.\" The game lets you waste everything in sight, and gives you the standard action fare of finding the right switch or key to progress to the next level. 198 Plenty of Ways to kill... BLOOD Il offers a wide variety of weapons including a sawed-off shotgun, a Howitzer cannon, and a COMPUTER voodoo doll. All provide a satisfying array of effects, with body parts being blown all over the place and blood spurting copiously. One of my favorite weapons was the flare gun--there's just nothing like setting your enemies on fire and hearing them scream \"It burns, it burns!\" In addition to the usual weapons mayhem, you can also play soccer with the heads of freshly killed opponents. You can carry only 10 weapons at a time, so you'll need to make careful choices.

"CENTIPEDE 3D REVIEW A Bug's Death ACTILON This Arcade Tribute Gets It Half Right 934 4799 4799 by Dawn Jepsen or those waxing nostalgic for the '80s, it's been a pretty good year. Software companies have cashed in on the ever-profitable market of recapturing lost youth with re-releases and new adaptations of classic arcade games. While ASTEROIDS is essentially a color copy of the original, Hasbro Interactive, creators of BATTLEZONE, altered the original CENTIPEDE into a completely different (and greatly underappreciated) new game. CENTIPEDE 3D attempts to bring gamers the best of both worlds by offering a new take on the arcade game as well as a com pletely new \"adventure\" mode. Aside from the annoyingly angled 3D screen, the Arcade mode is unremarkably true to the original. While true CENTIPEDE devotees may find the remake initially amusing, the experience is undermined properties, as well as special power-ups (the flame-thrower is a personal favorite). The levels aren't just shooting—there are puzzle elements and some rather annoying platform-jumping sequences. With 30-odd levels, the Adventure mode offers plenty of play. There are a number of ways to view the action. The most useful is an overhead, angled view, but other views put you behind, or even in the cockpit of the centipede-killing vehicle. CENTIPEDE'S 3D support is limited to 3Dfx Glide. With a non-3Dfx card, you're likely to find the graphics a bit blocky. Without 3D acceleration, the game was sluggish even at 512x384 on a Pentium II-300. At 320x200 on the minimum recommended Pentium 133, it was too jerky to be fun. DYNAMIC DUO Along with network and Internet play. CENTIPEDE offers a single-computer split-screen cooperative play mode. when timing and smoothness of play is hampered by slow response times and the need to lift the mouse just to move all the way across the game screen. So, the arcade experience is unfortunately, not duplicated. Players reminiscing over the days of blaring Joan Jett and pockets full of game tokens will, no doubt, be happier with the much more authentic version found in Microsoft's ARCADE.

Play begins in Weedom, where the centipede weaves its way through a small village and blows up anything it touches. Aside from destroying the centipede, the gamer must defend the houses of the town and rescue its wee people. After you kill a few centipedes, a bridge to the next level will open up. Complete six levels, and it's off to a new land—the ice, lava, and sea worlds are especially challenging. Things are kept interesting through the introduction of new insects, with various destructive WORLD Team Destruction CENTIPEDE's Adventure mode can be played with two players, either split-screen or via a LAN or Internet. Gameplay is cooperative: You can't shoot each other, but you can compete for best score. While CENTIPEDE's Arcade mode will likely cause you to turn off the computer in frustration and head to a real arcade, quarters in hand, the Adventure mode is worth a look. Its fast, original, challenging play, and is a worthy tribute to the arcade classic. CGW A New View What redeems CENTIPEDE is its addictive and challenging, if misnamed, Adventure mode.

But in reality this action racer is a 3D grown-up version of MARIO KART 64 with a nod to the classic WIPEOUT. DETHKARZ players climb behind the wheels of futuristic rocket sleds on wheels, then race to the finish line; along the way they grab power-ups and weapons to help beat the clock, wreck their opponents, and take the checkered flag.

"REVIEW  O.D.T. ACTLON (O)bvious (Doppelgnger (T)itle Try as It Might, O.D.T. Can't Escape Being a Weak TOMB RAIDER Clone by Kenneth Johnson that hath Lara Croft wrought? Store shelves crowded with wheezing TOMB RAIDER aspirants, hoping to capture the minds and wallets of gamers, that's what. Into this jumble you can toss O.D.T, another action/adventure, thirdperson, platform-jumping game. 0.D.T. does distinguish itself by providing multiple characters and by incorporating character experience and skill development systems. ASTIONE DON'T PUSH Some limited character interaction will fill you in on objectives and net you a power-up or two, but the same characters can get in your way and force you off a platform. Special Delivery The game's atmosphere borrows heavily from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The opening FMV depicts the flight of the dirigible Nautiflyus as it struggles COMPUTER ammo for your weapons, weapon and armor upgrades, and energy. As in TOMB RAIDER, your character is best controlled with a gamepad. Jumping from platform to platform isn't hard. Although died many times due to a fall, could not blame it on poor character control—sometimes I was forced off a platform by crew members who wouldn't get out of my way. You'll have to be careful if you expect to get through all eight levels to restore the pearl. For a game aspiring to be TOMB RAIDER, O.D.T. suffers from less fluid character animation, uninspired visuals, and technical glitches like visible seaming. At times, the camera view will be blocked if your character is too close to a wall. Several times I missed a jump or fell due to the view being blocked in this way. Save points are few and far between, leading to repeating sections of a level ad nauseum. Enemy Al is lacking as well. Monsters will stand still until you fire upon them. Their reactive attacks can be nasty-until you step over an invisible \"triggering\" line. After that they'll leave you alone until your next onslaught. O.D.T. will much likely appeal mostly to hard-core fans of third-person platformers. It is way better looking than SPACE BUNNIES MUST DIE but beyond the character develop ment and spell casting features, O.D.T.is Otherwise Distinctly Tired. CGW GAMING *** through a storm over uncharted territory. In its hold, in a glass container, the Nautiflyus carries a magical, glowing green pearl that may hold the cure to an epidemic. But magnetic interference makes the pearl go wacko, causing the airship to crash into a towerlike structure. The tower teems with mutants who kidnap the captain, steal the pearl, and shatter its container. It is up to you to find the pearl, restore the container, and collect 30 bottles of gas to power the airship's escape. The moody atmosphere around the mysterious tower is effective, but there are gaps in continuity. For example, the storm rages fiercely on the rooftop levels, but if you descend a bit into the structure you can look out from a ledge into a clear, moonlit sky. There are four crew characters to choose from, each with different ratings in armor, weapon control, and magic skills. As you progress, you gain experience that you distribute among the skills. In addition to affecting your performance, skill levels determine when you can use certain power-ups that increase the strength of your weapons or give you access to magical spells. Once you learn a spell you will need to find mana power-ups to cast it. Other power-ups include WORLD APPEAL: Gamers who love thirdperson action but have already played TOMB RAIDER III and HERETIC II.

The pack expands your arsenal of playability options with the standard free-for-all deathmatch, team-onteam deathmatch, cooperative single player missions, and team vs. team single player missions, in which one side gets to assist the \"enemy\" Al in preventing the Rangers from completing their mission. New tours of duty include Bosnia, Iraq, and Vietnam '68. It's too bad you can only play these campaigns while connected to the Internet, even in single-player mode. And when you play as \"enemy\" in multiplayer mode you look and dress just like them but you're carrying U.S. equipment The in-house player lobby works great for setting up games. Finding opponents and communicating during the game is a breeze. I was coordinating attacks like I had IVIS on my desktop. However, some annoying bugs persist, such as sticking your head through objects, and weapon fire frequently fails to track high threat targets when it locks onto faraway enemies. Lance A.

You can play this game in either Crime War or in Precinct Assault mode. Crime War is the straightforward action segment where you play through various missions, fighting criminal scum. Precinct Assault is the action/strategy hybrid where you and one opponent each control a base, vying to capture neutral factories and turrets while making units to invade each other's bases.

The 1963 Slick Chick table and Bicentennial-themed 1976 Spirit of 76 are recreations of the simple mechanical tables we 30somethings enjoyed in the dark days before SPACE INVADERS.

There's also variety in the asteroids themselves, such as crystal asteroids that can regenerate. There are 75 levels in all, broken into five zones.

"REVIEW. WWII FIGHTERS GAMING WORLD EDITORS' Not Just a Pretty Face Choco IMULATILO Jane's WWVII Sim Offers More Than Dazzling Visuals instrument panels and exteriors. The terrain is really quite plain, with lots of snow-covered turf and brown pebbly forest texture with a few polygonal trees sticking up. And while the game is a visual feast, you'll need plenty of CPU horsepower and a 3D card to get a ticket to the show. by John Nolan eny it if you will, but first impressions are usually based on looks. And looks are the first thing you'll notice about Jane's WWII FIGHTERS, which sets a new standard in visual excellence. The aircraft exteriors are exquisitely beautiful; the instrument panels are accurate and legible; sky, sun, and cloud effects are superb; explosions, flames, and flak are awesome. Hose a bandit and pieces fly as holes appear in his airframe. Crashes are spectacular. Nobody does it better. Of course, dazzling looks don't make for a great game, and WWII FIGHTERS isn't perfect. Its missions have a bit of a canned feel, and even the graphics aren't perfect. Cockpit frameworks don't live up to the very high standards of the FLAK TRAP When those puffs start blooming, change altitude quickly and head for clear skies. Flak gunners are quite competent, as evidenced by the destruction of this P-51. COMPUTER GAMING Better Than You Think There are seven flyable fighters--the P-51, P-38, P-47, Spitfire Mk IX, Bf-10966, FW-190A8, and the ME-262A-that await your steady hand. In addition, seven computer-controlled multiengined planes flesh out the missions: the B-17, B-24, B-26, C-47. Arado-234, HE-111, and the JU-88. The adjustable flight modeling spans the range from rookie to pro. The Easy model will continue a slow vertical climb with full power even at 60 knots-welcome to Arcade City. However, the Hard setting is more demanding, with better drag, some torque effect, a bit of inertia, and simple stall/spin characteristics. Here, the aircraft require a gentle hand and begin to show some characteristic distinctions between types. The models are detailed enough to provide challenging play and should satisfy all but the most hard-core purists. Jane's needs to add an input scaling routine for the controls, however, since some joysticks don't allow full control deflection. The weapons tilt a bit strong in terms of killing power. A 15-round burst from the twin 13mm guns on a Focke-Wulf will tear the wing off of a B-17. Still, kills don't come all that easy, and diving into a multiplane furball often sends you hunting for the Revive key. The cockpits are stunning, but the frames seem overly wide and block quite a bit of your view of the action. There are numerous visual aids for tracking targets, including a padlock, a mouse-controlled fully virtual cockpit, and Propeller Destroyed snap-view keys. The o n Dropping joystick view hat inexplicably pans the view-useless in combat-instead of snapping it, but that's supposed to be addressed in a patch that should be available now.

"REVIEW. REDGUARD Prince of Daggerfall ADVENTURE REDGUARD Is an Intelligent, Swashbuckling Action/Adventure by Thierry Nguyen very month, the CGW editors puzzle over where to put the increasing number of crossgenre games. When a new copy of HEROES OF UNREAL TOMB RAIDING JEDI MECHS comes in. we're left arguing about how it's a sim, adventure, action, and strategy game all at once. Such is the case with Bethesda's REDGUARD. Instead of making its usual massive RPG, Bethesda has dared to blur the line between action and adventure this time around. Though it is ultimately a very cool adventure game, there is enough action that it will undoubtedly turn off those adventure gamers with less-thanstellar reflexes COMPUTER Back to Basics The setting for REDGUARD is Stros M'kai, an island in the Hammerfell province in the world of Tamriel. You're playing Cyrus, a Redguard mercenary and the \"prodigal son\" of Hammerfell. You fled Stros M'kai because you killed your sister's husband in a drunken rage, and you've been wandering the world ever since. Now, a friend of yours writes a letter telling you that your estranged sister, Iszara, has been missing for the past three months. Hence you sail back to Stros M'kai to investigate her disappearance. Since REDGUARD takes place in Tamriel, the design team had the bonus of a fleshed-out fantasy world to use for the background. The plot starts simply enough, but there's a heavy dose of political intrique that makes it a lot deeper than it initially appears; overall it's a good break from the hackneyed \"evil-demons-sweep-the-land\" fantasy plot. Also, more kudos should go to the writers, because they've written some great and intelligent fantasy-style dialogue for REDGUARD. There's a lot of dialogue, too; at times equalling or even surpassing the amount found in the original GABRIEL KNIGHT. LOOKING GOOD With 3D acceleration, the gameworld looks much more vibrant and detailed than the earlier Xngine games. WORLD a heavy dose of swashbuckling action, with the atmosphere of such films as the Zorro series or The Adventures of Robin Hood. It features adventure gaming ele. ments (lots of dialogue and puzzles) mixed in with action elements found in third-person games (jumping and fencing). Like any good adventure game, puzzle. Heck, there's even a treasure map puzzle for pirate aficionados. Also, the game is quite nonlinear. Certain triggers move the story forward, but you can basically tackle the game in any order you choose. But adventure fans need to know that REDGUARD isn't a game with a few action elements.\" It's a true hybrid of both genres. It will help greatly if you have played through the TOMB RAIDER series, as A True Mix and Match If REDGUARD were a movie, it would undoubtedly star Errol Flynn. Essentially, it's a semitraditional adventure game and There's the requisite \"let's trade items!\" dialogs and MYST-style logic puzzles, along with more original ideas, such as the Gremlin Speech APPEAL: Adventure gamers who like action too; action gamers looking for a deeper story, fans of Errol Flynn movies. PROS: Good plot; good use of Elder Scrolls universe; well-written dialogue; large variety of puzzles, nonlinear game play, decent voice acting CONS: Way too much jumping; DOSbased Xngine leads to bugs and various quirks; Cyrus' animation isn't very smooth; some of the voice-acting is truly abysmal. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166, Windows 95, 32MB RAM, 350MB harddrive space, 4x CD-ROM, Windows 95compatible sound and video cards. 3D SUPPORT: 3Dix Glide, MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: None.

Don't write this off as an action game; there's more dialogue here than you can shake a crystal at. LEAP OF FAITH Be sure your jumping skills are up to snuff, because they form a major element in REDGUARD's gameplay. 170 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"ADVENTURE there are a lot of jumps to be made. Some are no sweat, like jumping a broken bridge; others, like the Goblin Caverns, will test even TOMB RAIDER veterans. Even the memorable Dwarven Scarab puzzle requires a lot of jumping to complete. On top of that, there's the swashbuckling combat. Cyrus is a Warrior, so there's a lot of swordplay throughout the game. Thankfully, combat isn't that tough, and is usually avoidable. With the exception of a few set encounters, you can just run away from most fights. In the fights you do have to play, there's usually an extra puzzle element in contrast to just more hacking and slashing. The interface is very straightforward, and to help poorly reflexed adventurers there's an auto defend option that makes parrying a lot easier. TRADE OPTIONS FOR MY BEETLE REDGUARD's puzzles range from mental to physical tasks, or are a combination of both, such as the beetle puzzle shown here. Act Like You Like It Amidst all this coolness, however, there are a few quirks that bring the game down. While this game is very clean and bug free compared to previous Bethesda products, some nasty bugs still creep up. For one thing, REDGUARD uses the Xngine, which is DOS-based. This means that your acceleration options are limited to either 3Dfx Glide or ugly software rendering. Also, the game is really finicky for gamers with fancy PCI-based A3D cards; I had no problems with mine, but there have been many tales of woe concerning SB Lives and similar cards on Usenet. Finally, the game occasionally threw me back to the desktop for no apparent reason. Cyrus' animation is a bit stiff, and not quite in sync with the background; it looks more as if he's floating rather than walking. While combat is pretty good, sometimes Cyrus becomes a bit hard to control in other activities. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what the problem is, but controlling Cyrus isn't quite as fluid as controlling Lara, or even the Prince of Persia. Also, if there's a lot of activity on the screen, the movement of both the camera and Cyrus slows down noticeably (this is on a P11/400 with 128MB of RAM and a Voodoo2 card). There were also a few technical glitches, such as AM TIBER SEPTIM'S PROUD SOLDIER, LOYAL VASSALA DEWER OF THE CROWN IT'S NOT MY FAULT 1 HAVE TO KEEP COMPANY WITH THE COVERNOR. DRAGON YOU DOWN Most cut-scenes, such as this meeting between Cyrus and Nafaalilargus the Dragon, are rendered with the in-game engine. clipping problems (guards' swords sticking through walls), and some NPCs were either stupidly trying to walk through a wall or magically levitated in the air. Also, while it's great that the game is generally nonlinear, it's advised that you not return the amulet to Richton too soon. This is a quest that is offered to you the moment you start the game, but if you see this quest through, it will cause every guard to want to fight you. I suggest you try to do as many quests as you can, and then save Richton's amulet for last; otherwise you'll have guards hacking at you throughout the game. Finally, the voice acting is very uneven. At times, it's perfect (I loved Governor Richton, J'Ferr, and Nafaalilargus the dragon) or at least very solid (Cyrus and the pirates of the Restless League). Other times, well, let's say that the Inca games have some competition for horrendous voice acting. Anyone who didn't turn their volume off when listening to Lakene, Erasmo, Favis, and Mariah has a stronger constitution for bad acting than do I. Some of these characters ruined the immersion for me. REDGUARD is a thrilling game, one of Bethesda's best releases in a while. Check it out if you're looking for a swashbuckling adventure with a good plot. Just be ready for the technical issues and jumps that would make Lara quake in her short shorts. Also, keep hand on the volume knob when talking to certain people. CGW 100 HEH-HEH-HEH HAVE AT YOU! Combat has that fast-paced swashbuckling feel, with you and your opponent trading barbs and quips.

"REVIEW  REDJACK Ho, Hum, No Bottle of Rum ADVENTURE THQ's Latest Is All Jacked Up With Nowhere to Go by Scorpia ith a little swash and a little buckling, REDJACK aspires to be a pirate game, but it's a far cry from SID MEIER'S PIRATES or any of the MONKEY ISLAND games. Our hero, Nick Dove, lives on the small island of Lizard Point. He has a slightly obnoxious older brother and a slightly more obnoxious girlfriend. The girlfriend holds the mortgage on Nick's farm, which she may have to sell to pay her father's debts. Little surprise, then, that Nick decides to board a buccaneer ves. sel that just happens to be docked in the harbor. Being a landlubber, Nick of course has to do a few things to prove he's pirate material. That accomplished, he's taken on board, though not all of COMPUTER been restored a few times. So, while fighting, you also have to look at the scenery and move your cursor around to find whatever it is that just might help you defeat your opponent. REDJACK descends into the absurd on occasion. A fantasy pirate romp is one thing. But when a flying ship appears, complete with balloons instead of sails, or Nick fights off a small army of assassins with a primitive machine gun while riding a sort of roller coaster, one has to draw the line. KISS OFF What Nick sees in this wench, we'll never know. Why does she hold our mortgage? the crew is thrilled to have him. Nick may not have picked the best ship, either. It's captained by one of the few remaining members of the Brethren, a group of pirates originally gathered under the notorious under the notorious Redjack, who's long dead through someone's treachery. Seeing Red Most puzzles aren't particularly difficult; the only challenging one is opening the temple doors. In that respect, the game is (ahem) pretty clear sailing. For what it's worth, REDJACK sports a simple interface, and saving and restoring is very quick. If the game is running slowly, you can switch between 16-bit and 32-bit modes without any real loss in graphic display. In the end, even though REDJACK tries to combine action and adventure elements, it fails to satisfy especially given its banal storyline and occasional absurdities. If you were looking for a real, rousing pirate experience, you on't find it here. CGW GAMING ** WORLD Worse, Nick doesn't do much in the way of real pirating-no captured prizes, no boarding or desperate fighting on deck, no real blazing sea battles. Most of what you do as Nick is either escape from someone or rush to rescue someone else. There are some one-on-one encounters when you get to use a sword, but the DOOM-like view proves very restricting, making it difficult to manipulate your sword via a mouse. You can attack or parry, but there is no movement to speak of in any direction. At times, it's possible to go forward a bit, forcing your opponent to take a step or two back. Fights are mostly won by trickery, not swordsmanship. This is deliberate, though you may not realize that until the game has pirates with lots of UREDACRT Aye, It Be the Ninjas The Brethren are being hunted down by a group of ninjalike assassins with quasimagical powers, to whom the captain falls victim. Since Nick is nearby, he gets the blame, and the story is terribly predictable from this point on: There's the jailbreak, the daughter of Redjack disguised as a crew member, the cursed treasure, the ancient temple ruins, the mysterious secret enemy in the background...you get the idea. APPEAL: For pirates with lots of patience PROS: Technically, it runs well in either 16-bit or 32 bit graphics mode; nice interface. CONS: Bland at best more often boring and hackneyed.

"COMPUTER REVIEW . FIFA 99 GAMING WORLD Shot on Goal EDITORS' CHOICE SPORTS RACING EA Doesn't Go Much Further With FIFA 99, but It Doesn't Have To by Joe Vallina he Major League Soccer season had just wound down and the European leagues were just starting up when the new FIFA game hit my desk. I'm a big fan of the series, and I couldn't wait to see how the EA Sports team had improved upon an almost perfect formula. Well, FIFA 99 does have some great additions, but it also has a few unexpected problems. However, fear not, fellow soccer fiends; it's still head and shoulders above any other soccer game on the market. The first time I saw FIFA 98 on a big monitor, I thought the guy playing it was watching a game on TV. FIFA 99 looks just as good. The player animations are incredibly COMPUTER GAMING detailed and realistic, the uniforms are accurate and the dead-ball animations are at times hilarious. Also, some of the nonaction animations have been removed to make the games flow without as many interruptions (I'm thinki ng of the nowabsent throw-in animations). There are a couple of glitches in the graphics, RAINY DAY GOAL Kiko gives Spain's FC Barcelona the equalizer in a UEFA Cup though.

"Milan, Arsenal, FC Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Inter Milan (sans Ronaldo, ugh. Stupid licensing!), Real Madrid, and 13 other European powers. SPORIS RACING didas Dorld's A Manager's Dream Come True One great new addition to FIFA 99 bears special mention, the IGM (In-Game-Management) option. This much-needed tool lets you choose three different formations (and aggression levels for each) that you can toggle through on the fly during a game in progress. Thus, you no longer need to stop play to go to the team management screen and alter your lineup. This option works very well. There were several times when I saw an opportunity for a fast break and was able to capitalize on it using the IGM.

Of course, there are still gajillions of skill moves you can perform using different button combinations. One new addition, which actually works quite well, is the sliding kick. Or you can go with a rainbow kick or 360degree spin move to be more flamboyant. You can even take a dive to try and draw the card, if you're feeling really dramatic. lost more FIFA 98 matches to lastsecond corner kick/headers-on-goal than I care to remember.) That doesn't happen in FIFA 99. However, the three difficulty levels are still too far apart. Amateur is too easy, and professional is too difficult (world-class is for gods or masochists only, thank you very much). But, to be fair, the professional level has been toned down from FIFA 98. Now, you can beat it, it's just frickin' hard to do. (Which can be a good thing.) Also, regarding goalie control, in FIFA 99 you can actually control the goalkeeper at times, although it's normally better to just let the Al do it-unless your keeper is deaf, dumb, and blind (which some are). CGW CUP FIFA 99 focuses on club play, so Cups are all important. You can create your own with tons o' options. Another addition, which is less useful, is the IGT (In-Game Tactics) option. This consists of four preprogrammed moves (offside trap, attacking press, through-ball run, and wing-back run) that you can also use during the game by hitting a certain key combination. These moves are not available if you use only a twoor four-button controller, but I could never get them to work Tough Cookie The Al has been improved in FIFA 99. In previous incarnations of the game, if the Al opponent was down a goal or two near the end of a match, you could count on a \"miracle\" shot or free kick to equalize or win the match. (I've What About Poland? The Final Whistle All in all, FIFA 99 is still the best soccer game out thereby far. Go buy it right now. There are improvements to be made, no doubt, but it still looks incredible, is superfun, and the icing on the cake-you can still play for all your favorite teams. It's worth your time and cash. CGW o what do you do if you're a Warsaw-born-and-bred soccer fanatic and you would kill to play on your hometown club? Well, go to www.fifa 99.net and download to your heart's content. At press time, on the FIFA99.net league download page there are updated rosters and uniforms for England, France, Scotland, Greece, the Spanish second division, Croatia, Israel, Poland, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, and Malaysia. Keep in mind that all of these hacks are just that...homemade mods, so back up any saved games before you try them. Other goodies available for download are kits and a patch to add Ronaldo to FIFA 99. You can also get a FSH Flash Editor on the site that will let you add your own teams to the game and even change the ball, turf, logos/flags, and the like. Good luck!

"REVIEW DEER HUNTER II Time to Die, Bambi: Part II SPORTSVRACING In a Big Improvement, Our Furred Friends Eat It Like Never Before Back by Joe Vallina hen the first DEER HUNTER came out, everyone laughed. Especially the folks at Wizard Works...all the way to the bank, that is. But for all the money it made, DEER HUNTER was still a big step below almost every other game out there in terms of gameplay and technology. You couldn't even walk around, for Pete's sake. I mean, you could do that in DOOM back in 1993. And don't get me started on the crappy map screen. Still, DEER HUNTER only cost $20, so what the hell. Well, in DEER HUNTER II, you can walk around, the horrible map screen has been replaced by a cool GPS device, and the game looks a lot better, albeit not to the quality of most 3D shooters. Walk Look Me: 1; Bambi: 0 One new addition to DEER HUNTER II is the Hunter Screen, where you create a hunting identity that keeps track of your hit ratio and other stats. You can create several different hunters (which will keep little Johnny from screwing up your hit ratio while you're at work). There are 12 new places to h unt, and you can choose from nine weapons, including a crossbow, a muzzleloader, and a longbow. All of the weapons are pretty good, but I still prefer the standard bolt-action rifle. The game's inventory list has expanded to include a deer decoy, a fleece jacket, and the GPS positioning device (which displays your longitude/latitude, shows a localized map of the area, and gives the time of day and ele vation). You can also use cover scent, two types of attractant scents, and several other gadgets. The game does a great job of showing tracks, scrapes, rubs, and droppings. When you do hit and injure a deer, you can follow bloodstains on the ground to round up your quarry. This is one of the best features of the game, and realistically mimics real life. GOTCHA! This dead buck got a little too close to the king of death me. The game's graphic details are somewhat mediocre, even with the new facelift. Terrain is still pretty blocky, and trees stand out in the middle of nowhere rather than being formed into convince ing forests. The deer animations, on the other hand, can be quite realistic, especially when seen from a distance. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Ahma Goin' Huntin'! DEER HUNTER II is much more realistic than the first game. You must sight in your weapons before going on the hunt, which is completely realistic: If your gun's sights are off, you won't hit the broad side of a barn, much less a deer. However, this higher level of realism comes back to bite the game when it comes to waiting around for a deer to show up. I had several hunts that seemed as though they would never end, and, in fact, after waiting 15 minutes or more for a deer to show (and yes, I did use the calls and attractants), I had to quit the hunt and start another. This has happened to me on real hunts, too, but when I'm playing a computer game, by golly, I want to kill something. Overall, though, DEER HUNTER Il is a solid, fun game, and is definitely an improvement over its predecessor. Another plus is that, despite all of the enhancements, the game still costs $20. DEER HUNTER II is a game that, while it won't appeal to the non-hunting, hard-core gaming crowd, is just right for real-life hunters or anyone who wants a fun diversion between work assignments. CGW Back APPEAL: Real-life hunters with a PC: anyone who wants cheap, killing fun. PROS: Lots of weapons, very realistic tracking: 3D good gadgets.

In an effort to more closely recreate the action of a real swing, Access has also added the PowerStroke, which uses horizontal mouse movement rather than just clicks. At first this option excited me, since it seemed to emulate a real swing, but I found the movement difficult to master. LINKS offered an unsolicited adjustment to me along the way, almost as if the software sensed my frustration. Happily, it helped. More feedback is available from the postswing analyzer, which measures club-head speed and the angle of the club as it strikes the ball. Despite the advice of the program's virtual caddie, I found the PowerStroke awk. ward and chose the three-click. As a left-handed golfer, I must say I was jazzed to see a \"lefthanded PowerStroke swing\" offered, but I was then dismayed to see the animated visual of the golfer still hitting right-handed. If the game is going to offer a lefthanded option, the player should appear that way onscreen. now sports a tournament environment, with galleries of hundreds of spectators lining every fairway, waiting to cheer a great shot. Crowds react to each shot; additionally, noises coming from other areas of the course, press cameramen and camera towers, vehicles, officials, ropes, and grandstands add to the \"you are there\" feeling. All of this, combined with event banners, tents, and leaderboards (not to mention the Goodyear blimp drifting across the sky). give the game a different feel: You're not just a player on a course, but a pro in the midst of a tour event. Atmosphere is great, but what about gameplay? One of the most significant enhancements is the new Mode of Play (MOP) Game Designer, which lets you develop play styles and share them with friends. The designer includes 30 new MOPs to get you started, including such games as Skins, Match Play, Bingo-Bango-Bongo, and Stableford. It's easy to use, so that anyone can add that variation of golf they developed with their drinking buddies.

"REVIEW NFL BLITZ Blood Bowl SPORTS/RACING NFL BLITZ Starts Strong but Fades a Bit in the Second Half well when you're out on the town doesn't succeed quite as well on your desktop at home. 0 0:46 1ST 0.8 ATL DOUBLE-GASK by Brett Todd ootball without rules. It's a great concept and one that may finally have found its place in the sun now that the National Football League has put shaved monkeys in the striped shirts (\"Um, that was tails, right?\") and Midway has released NFL BLITZ for the PC. If you've entered an arcade, pub, or pool hall anytime in the past few years, you undoubtedly know the game already. Like its close relative NBA JAM, NFL BLITZ removes both rules and reality from the authentic sport, leaving behind nothing but pure mayhem. The coin-op edition proved to be a huge hit, earning tons of cash for Midway and giving barflies something to do after they've been cut off. Unfortunately, what works so THE NAME OF THE GAME IS... NFL BLITZ lives up to its name on defense. Get into the backfield quick enough and you'll pile up the sacks quicker than you can say \"compound fracture.\" Keep It Simple, Stupid The basic concept is simple: seven-on-seven football with nothing approximating strategy to interfere with crippling your opponents. Each NFL team's roster is complete with the best and brightest on offense and defense. There are no injuries or substitutions, so you'd better get used to seeing an awful lot of folks like John Elway, Deion Sanders, and Ryan \"I Love Reporters\" Leaf. All the clubs share the same basic playbook, which features generic calls for both sides of the scrimmage line Downs and points are all you have to worry about as far as rules go. The scoring system follows that of the actual NFL, but your offense needs to get 30 yards for a first down here (don't worry, that's not as hard to pick up as it sounds) Once the ball is snapped, any thing goes. Holding and hitting are the best ways to cover opposing receivers, since pass interference seems to be a foreign concept here. As you might expect, picks and fumbles occur fairly frequently because of this. Visual and audio presentation pumps all this up. The 3D-accelerated graphics (a 3Dfx or recent D3D card is required) are bright, blocky, and cartoony, making it clear from first glance that this is not a sim. Everything is overblown in NFL BLITZ, from the \"hip-hop by way of NFL Films\" music through the \"Vince COMPUTER GAMING WOR **** fe EMIDWAY HE'S FOAMIN' AT THE MOUTH! APPEAL: Action fans, anyone sick of supporting Midway a quarter at a time. PROS: Fast gameplay, lots of fun to play against a friend. CONS: Not much in the way of depth or replay value; no multiplayer options. DIFFICULTY: Easy. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166 (with 3Dfx cards) or Pentium Il-233 (with other 3D cards), Windows 95/98, 32MB RAM, 8x CD-ROM, Sound Blaster or compatible sound card. 3D SUPPORT: 3Dfx, second-generation Direct3D-compatible cards (all major chipsets).

Hits are always larger than life, due to the dynamic animations and crunches that'll shake your subwoofer. Once you get out on the field, expect to do things that would make Bill Romanowski blush. Instead of just wrapping Michael Irvin up in a nice, legal tackle, you'll grab him by one arm, spin him around a couple of times, and then drive him and his ego into the turf of Texas Stadium. Rather than merely push Terrell Davis out of bounds like a nice little linebacker, you'll hit him with a flying forearm that leaves him saluting a faceful of dirt. The mayhem doesn't stop when the play does. Is your opponent helpless? Good. Then I guess it's time to show him that spending all those nights watching WWF RAW wasn't a waste of time: Go ahead and repeatedly body slam and DDT his tackled ass. The game encourages this with hilarious play-byplay lines like \"That was totally uncalled for—but a lot of fun to watch!\" and \"He's going postal!\" There's no learning curve to speak of. Like the arcade title, the PC game is designed so that people will pick things up immediately. ere are just two of the after-thewhistle ways you can toss around the opposition.

Many of these even a mission you're forced to accomplish using only the shaman—you'll be saving often here. Some later missions add nods to the original game, such as a cameo appearance by the Armageddon spell, which calls all the world's armies to a single location to fight to the death. Unfortunately, there's no random map/skirmish mode or miss ion builder, so there's little singleplayer replay value. There is a multiplayer skirmish mode, however. This works well on a LAN, but when we tried connecting over the free Populous.net matchmaking service, it wasn't unusual to find that one or two players couldn't connect to a game. Overall, POPULOUS: THE BEGINNING is a mixed bag. The gameplay is unique and a nice change from most RTS fare. Some You've Been Demoted hen POPULOUS II was released seven years ago on the late, lamented Amiga, a game that let you take the role of a god was considered somewhat controversial. In today's world of 3D shooters starring murdering angels, that may seem a bit naive. Still, POPULOUS: THE BEGINNING bypasses the issue completely by making you not a god, but rather just a slightly better-than-mere-mortals shaman. In a significant departure from the conventions of the original games, you now have direct control over the actions of your followers. In the original games, you could only influence your people's behavior by leading them into enemy territory with your Papal Magnet, or causing their general mood to be one of settling, gathering together, or fighting. You could directly alter the landscape, building lands for your people, pulling the ground out from under unbelievers and casting them into the seas, and raining destruction on them through tidal waves, volcanoes, tornadoes, and other unnatural disasters. Now these sorts of things are done through your shaman. By giving you direct control over individual members of your population, POPULOUS: THE BEGINNING gains a play style more familiar to gamers weaned on COMMAND AND CONQUER and STARCRAFT, at the expense of play that sometimes borders on micromanagement. To the game's credit, however, your followers often do take some initiative when idle. The Classic While we miss POPULOUS II's innovative gameplay, we'll take the new version's graphics any day. of their guard towers, leaving my town's perimeter undefended. into the skies and spits them out) spell, another may decide to save up for a deadly volcano to unleash in the enemy's town center, while a third might continuously use the low-mana Lightning spell to cause smaller, harassing damage. Many of the spells, such as the Volcano, Rain of Fire, and Tornado, are destructive weapons reminiscent of your powers in the earlier POPULOUS games. Others alter the terrain-building land bridges to enemy islands, or sending coastal settlements crashing into the seas. The terrain deserves special note. It not only looks really good, Stay a Spell In addition to armies of followers, your shaman boasts some powerful magic. In early games, you may start with only Blast, Lightning, and Convert spells, but eventually you'll find obelisks, stone heads, and totems that will give you access to additional spells and buildings. In fact, these various spell sites are usually the key to successfully completing missions. Each spell you cast uses up some of your valuable mana, are of the typical \"build your armies and kill, kill, kill\" nature. In fact, other than the occasional annoying time-limited mission, the first nine missions have a repetitive feel, with the monotony getting broken up only by the too-infrequent introduction of a new spell or new unit. Stick it out, though, and you'll find the later missions have plenty of twists one starts with the enemy shaman sinking your people into the sea within the first minute of the game, while another begins with your shaman imprisoned and powerless. Toward the end, there's missions, however, are overly puzzle-oriented, perhaps to make up for the computer players' Al, which at times seems a bit dense. Still, it's a fresh entry into a stagnating genre, and even with its limited replay value it's worth a look for fans of the original POPULOUS and newcomers alike. CGW Denny Atkin was addicted to the original POPULI, but wasn't a fan of the bastard-child POWERMONGER. Lately he's been playing POPULOUS ll on the WinUAE Amiga emulator, as well as HALF-LIFE, WWII FIGHTERS, and EUROPEAN AIR WAR. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 189 "


"REVIEW RAILROAD TYCOON II GAMING EDITORS WORLD All Aboard! CHOICE STRATEGYZWAR Hop This Locomotive for Addictive, Cutthroat, Robber-Baron Capitalism zoom in from a view of an entire continent to see towns, farms, and factories (with smokestacks puffing). And once the trains get rolling, it's a busy, bustling world. To satisfy the train watcher in all of us, the designers have made sure there's a wide variety of authentic railroad equipment from all time periods. About 60 different locomotives are available, from George Stephenson's Rocket to the TGV and trains that will levitate magnetically in the 21st century. by Bob Proctor he original RAILROAD TYCOON was one of the first computer strategy games based on building instead of fighting. But unlike SIMCITY, it had a high degree of competitiveness. It's good to see this favorite return in RAILROAD TYCOON II (RT2). The sequel has more of what the original had more commodities, more locomotives, more maps-but nothing that radically alters the concept. 1 would have preferred to see more new features (see sidebar) but I still think it's a great game. The first thing you'll notice is that the graphics have been beautifully upgraded.

The goal of the game is usually to maximize your personal wealth, the value of your company, or both. Because the game allows all the nasty tricks that 19th-century robber barons used, you make 90 percent of your money on the stock market rather than running your railroad. To play RT2 competitively, you must master the market. You can neglect your railroad; you can even run it into the ground to drive the stock price down and make money by selling the stock short. If you find that sort of behavior distasteful, you can tone down the game by selecting from three levels of complexity for both the financial and industrial models. You can't turn off the stock market completely without also turning off the industrial model (an oversight), but you can turn both off. This is called \"Sandbox mode,\" and it lets you build to your heart's content without worrying about running out of money or being bought out by Jay Gould. In spite of the claims printed on the box that RT2 What's Missing in RT2? SURVEYING: Because railroads are so expensive, they must be carefully planned before construction starts. RT2 should at least allow you to undo the last section of track as you build. Even better would be a survey mode in which an entire line could be laid out so that grade and cost could be determined before you make the decision to build it. 190 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MARCH 1999 www.computergaming.com "

Cart  JOUNI We WANI Eur Per Share: MANNO JAN 1901 ENGINEERING: The classic trade-off in railroad construction is between the cost to build and the cost to operate. You can keep the grade on almost any railroad to 1 or 2 percent if you are willing to spend money tunneling, bridging, and looping to change elevation. If you don't pay up front, you end up paying later with higher fuel and maintenance costs and slower, less reliable trains. RAILROAD TYCOON II should give you the option of buying lower grades on any section of track. HELPER ENGINES: The economic model in RAILROAD TYCOON II pays big bonuses for longer trips, but this makes it more difficult to choose the right locomotive. You might have mostly easy grades with one or two places where steep grades are unavoidable. Real railroads cope with this by adding a \"helper engine\" at the bottom of the hill. RAILROAD TYCOON II should replicate real life by letting you assign locomotives to helper service to boost train speeds uphill. SEASONS: My trains get stopped by bandits all the time, but they never suffer from something far more common in the real world-snow. Lines through the Alps, the Sierra, or the Rockies spend lots of money to operate during winter months. RAILROAD TYCOON II could have modeled this and allowed you to overcome it in two ways. You could buy an upgrade to a section of track (representing snowsheds, avalanche protection, and snow removal equipment) or use a special car, the Snowplow, which you could put on trains the same way you attach a caboose. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"REVIEW  WEST FRONT Second Front STRATEGYZWAR WEST FRONT Takes the Conflict Farther Than Its Eastern Counterpart by Jim Cobb alonSoft's game systems are a lot like wine: They improve over time, and gamers are advised not to reject them even if the first sip proves a bit disappointing. WEST FRONT is a fine example of this maturation process. Its sister game, EAST FRONT, debuted to mostly tepid reviews and has been patched seven times with increasingly successful changes. WEST FRONT not only incorporates these changes, it moves beyond them and is superior to its predecessor in almost every respect. My Kingdom for an Action Point WEST FRONT is a tactical, turnbased, simulation of combat in the COMPUTER GAMING WWII western front during 19401945. The scale is 250 meters per hex, 6 minutes per turn, and focuses on platoon/battery-sized units. Combatants include not only the typical forces of Germany, Great Britain and the United States, but also Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Yugoslavia, and two kinds of Italian and French troops each. The basics of play are similar to EAST FRONT, with units being rated on strength, morale, fire and movement costs, and assault and defense capabilities. Unit capabilities are restricted by a set number of action points. Actions can be ordered from a menu, toolbar, or keyboard. Function keys bring up DARBY'S RANGERS This amphibious assault of Gela shows the screens that explain unit capabilities improved graphics, from the miniatures-style soldiers to the in historic as well as game turns. new contour lines of the terrain.

The high point of the German glider and paratroop operations are well depict. ed in WEST FRONT, from the early landings on Crete (above) to the chaotic situation that develops later as the British counterattack (below). units and follow the actual course of wartime events. However, replayability is assured because the player faces different engagements based upon his performance. WEST FRONT hits its stride with the dynamic campaigns (DCG). Here, a player becomes part of the unit mix as either a tank or infantry leader. Although the campaigns start and end on the historic dates, what happens between is wildly variable. The gamer begins commanding a battalion and can place units before the battle. Good results in missions increase both the commander's and his command's experience points, leading to more favorable combat results. The number of missions per campaign varies, with the percentage chance for a mission changing weekly. Too many missions can be hard on an outfit since losses to the player's core units are carried over. Replacements dribble in unpredictably so the only way a player can increase his core force is to be promoted to regimental or divisional command. In fact, you may be stuck playing a number of missions with dwindling numbers of troops, unless you get a \"million-dollar\" wound and end up on leave until the campaign ends. During the campaign, equipment may be upgraded automatically. There are seven DCGs but, because the tank and infantry modes are completely different, WEST FRONT actually has twice that number. Fifty-two single scenarios provide an opportunity for quick play. WEST FRONT has a scenario editor with detailed terrain and unit libraries, so that you can re-create virtually any engagement. For the busy player, there's a scenario generator that creates a battle after the player sets parameters of month, year, region, command size, nationality, and engagement type. TalonSoft took a drubbing with the skimpy initial documentation of EAST FRONT. The company has not made the same mistake twice.

"STRATEGYZWAR Morale Problem or all of its fine points, WEST FRONT suffers from three rough edges that will irritate serious gamers. First, the infantry is too strong in the early battles. During this period, most infantry was unprepared to deal with armored attacks and tended to withdraw when the tanks came on. In WEST FRONT, infantry stands in the open like a rock against tanks, and swarms of Infantry platoons are the most efficient tank killers. As the war progressed, infantry became proficient against armor, but not in 1939-41. Second, and more important, morale effects are too limited. While the morale routine for units being attacked works well, nothing affects adjacent units. Consider two scenarios: Three units are in the same 250meter hex; two either die or retreat. In WEST FRONT, the third always stays put. The same applies to three units in a three-hex line: The middle one will hold regardless of its flanks. This system precludes routs, which are really what lose most battles. Limiting morale effects to single units is unrealistic and makes battles too long and bloody. Finally, the Al is conservative and predictable. On the two lower levels, it doesn't press home advantages, especially when close assaults would work. It becomes more aggressive at the two harder levels, when it has larger forces and receives boosts in supply and combat resolution, but doesn't become cleverer tactically. The Al misuses indirect fire by always targeting where mobile units are instead of where they should be next turn, and it makes its own units vulneraSUPER GRUNTS This many British ble by clusterMatilda tanks should be able to send the German infantry runing them at ning in 1940, but they don't in obvious aiming WEST FRONT. points fine detail. Extensive data tables and bibliographies will help scenario designers, while questions are covered in a five-page FAQ. The manual includes a tutorial for experienced gamers, while the READ.ME file contains a boot camp for beginners. WEST FRONT is a worthy entrant into a genre that still appeals to serious gamers, despite a few rough edges (see sidebar, above). One wishes TalonSoft, having polished the detail work on WWII tactical combat, would take a closer look at the large-scale factors and relationships of battle in this era. WEST FRONT is a fine platform for this and is the most entertaining, informative, and accessible product on the subject.

"REVIEW. WARHAMMER 40,000: CHAOS GATE STRATEGYZAWAR Order Triumphant CHAOS GATE Heralds the Return of Turn-based Squad-level Gaming by Tim Carter -COMmies rejoice. After long and oh-sobarren years of bad knockoffs and paltry imitations, at last we turn-based aficionados have a game we can sink our teeth into. CHAOS GATE, SSI's latest venture into the WARHAMMER universe, delivers a solid turnbased, squad-level game engine. Finally. CHAOS GATE puts you in command of large and small groups of space marines on a quest to defeat, basically, an army of other space marines. While CHAOS GATE owes some inspiration to the now venerable X-COM, the combat system, game story, and tactical battles have a distinctive feel that is more loyal to the WARHAMMER universe than anything else. For instance, the equipment and types of troops available to you in CHAOS GATE are dictated by the fiction underpinning all WARHAMMER games. This, in turn, has a considerable effect on your tactics and long-term strategy. I must confess, however, that! found myself gravitating away from many of the \"true\" WARHAMMER solutions to tactical problems in favor of what! thought worked best.

"STRATEGYZWAR VITAL STATISTICS The handy targeting HUD shows that this targeted Chaos marine is not long for this world. to handle during actual battles. Hang back and wait for any and all assaulting enemy troops to leave their covered positions and attack, then kill them using directed and overwatch fire. Then, isolate and destroy the defenders that remain at their posts one at a time. I often found that as a group the CHAOS forces simply didn't work together enough to get the most out of their troops. The game is set up so that most troops (on both sides) are pretty durable, making full-blown firefights quite interesting, as you have to decide where and how to concentrate your fire to have a measurable effect. In many instances, however, the dysfunctional tactics of the Al Combating Chaos iven the somewhat dysfunctional proclivities of the Al in CHAOS GATE, aspiring marine heroes may want to take a \"piecemeal\" approach to dissecting the enemy. As the enemy's armor is as good as yours, you can't reasonably assume that enemy troops will die following the first or even second accurate shot (assuming your soldiers have the skills to hit what they're aiming at). Instead, try to isolate individual defenders and gang up on them with three or more attacking marines. If you have time and favorable terrain, sneak one or more marines close enough to use grenades to soften up heavily armored enemy troops or armored vehicles (especially vehicles). Don't be afraid to sit back at long range and pick apart Chaos defenses-no one said that winning had to be pretty. Use heavy bolters and krak missiles to do your dirty work for you, and move in only when you have to. Remember: Ammunition shortages become a problem only if you forget to forage. A clever marine commander will know what he is likely to run short of later (like grenades and heavy bolter clips) and pick it up whenever possible.

(This is easy enough in a small grid whose first word is \"big,\" but ulcerinducing in a large grid whose first word is \"rangy.\") There is some repetition—for instance, both Butterflies and Balloon Kaboom ask you to clear a grid of its contents by moving shapes around until similar ones are side-by-side, and both Gumball and Take A Seat ask you to fill receptacles according to esoteric rules. Even the more straightforward games, such as Paper, Scissors, Rock, have enough special rules to make them quite enjoyable. Unlike most series, which tend to start running out of steam by their third installment, SMART GAMES' PUZZLE CHALLENGE still has all of its original spirit and most of its creative spark. It's showing its age a little, but no puzzle lover will leave disappointed. CGW STEPPING TONES This variation on the second game's Say What? once again asks you to put together a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are snippets of a famous melody. Trust us, it's fun. tricks this time, choosing between offering increasingly subtle variations on old favorites and introduc ing genuinely novel puzzles that are a little too arcane to \"get\" at first glance. They've done a little of each, and the latter especially takes some getting used to. COMPUTER WORLD A Puzzling Development You really have to read the rules this time out if you want to understand just how some of these puzzles work, and that's a shame. Deciphering how to play Gumball or Shopping Cart becomes something of a puzzle itself: You have to familiarize yourself with each puzzle's unique set of controls and rules, and the handful of explanatory sentences the game provides is not always as helpful as it is meant to be. That said, once you get the hang of a given puzzle, it's generally worth it: All but two or three are excellent, and a couple are simply brilliant. Meteor Mayhem is one of the best, a tricky little number in which you control one or more robot spaceships that have to clear a grid of asteroids in a limited number of moves and/or firings of the ship's laser cannons.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY. CHEATS WALKTHROUGHS Grim Fandango Having a Bad Day of the Dead? Scorpia's Here to Help At the Office by Scorpia RIM FANDANGO is an extensive adventure, with far too much to cover exhaustively in a single article. Here we'll take a look at some of the puzzles most likely to give you trouble. A First-class Client: You have to get in ahead of Domino to really start the game moving, especially after picking up the low-class poisoning victim. Gumming up the works can do wonders. But you'll need an ace in the hole (or vice versa), and you should insert it in the message center tube downstairs to read Mercedes Colomar's card. Puerto Something Petrified Forest Weird Marrow Tree: Okay, Manny, it's time to really rock and roll. You do the rolling, and the tree will rock. It's easiest to accomplish in the center, but timing is definitely essential. And you'll be needing some help from Glottis at the end; just don't wait too long. Sometimes you have to be naughty to be nice. Demasiado Tarde: Too bad that message from Salvador came in too late to save the ship's crew. Now you have to save yourself and Glottis. In this case, half a loaf (or ship) is better than one. If you hear \"Anchors Aweigh\" in your head, that's a hint. Just be sure you get off to the right start. Edge of the World Demon Beavers: Blasting from the front just doesn't do the trick. Maybe you found that out already. However, in the right place, with the right bait and the right timing, you can cool these hot little critters in practically no time. First, throw a bone into the pit, then hose each beaver with the fire extinguisher as it jumps in for the bone. TALAS Vault: If you're having trouble with the tumblers, keep in mind that the four flat sides have to be facing and aligned with the right side of the door. It's best to work from the top down here. When they're set properly, think sharp to keep them from moving when you open the door. See the Review FEBRUARY ISSUE  4.5 STARS 204 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  MARCH 1999 "

Take your time and scope out the whole area, so you know where all the places are (it was a long time before I discovered that the elevator by the Blue Casket brings you back up to the Calavera Cafe!). The three main goals in this section can be accomplished in almost any order, not just the one given here. 1. Set the conveyor belt to move downward, then climb up out of 2. Get in the crane and drive it to the other side of the city. 3. Push the down arrow key to lower the crane claw, and exit the crane. 4. Use the Bust-All on the claw. Lower the chain. It should be 5. Get back in the crane. between the rollers; if not, move the crane slightly and try again. 8. Go back to the other side of the city. 9. Lower the chain onto the conveyor 10.

It's Cupty. Naranja: No, you don't have to kill him to join the crew, but it's better all around if someone thought he was, um, \"dead.\" Technically, of course, he's dead already. But in the world of GRIM FANDANGO, there's dead and there's dead, as in pushin' up posies, marigolds, whatever. Naranja's getting tattooed, which makes things slightly easier. After he's been basted (good for what ales him, and a little distraction helps), you'll have half of what you need. Carla can supply the other half, provided you're flaky enough and fast enough to be detected. Rubacava Again Bonewagon: If you're having trouble with the gelatin setting, check out Toto's place. Back Home Again Note the race photo showing #6. Disguise: Hot stuff! Too hot to handle. Speaking of which, it's too bad Manny doesn't have a third hand. Maybe he can get one. Think flowery thoughts. Joining the Union: Chowchilla Charlie is willing to deal: a union card for a suitcase. Sounds easy enough, eh? Maybe. First, you'll have to shut up the waiter and have barrels of fun. Then, as Yogi said, \"When you come to the fork in the road, take it.\" Take it right into the elevator. You can probably figure out what to do after that, but be quick about it. Seeing Hector: When you talk to the couple, go against your better instincts. A con job now will be better in the long run. Listen to the clerk, who mentions \"Tuesday.\" The Cat Trick . Bay G GYOTO Seabee Tools: Viva la Revolucin! Strike while the iron is hot, or at least the Seabees should. Bet you could write a book about that, but someone else already did, and that's the start. Unfortunately, you now need a lawyer, and, even more unfortunately, he doesn't want to help you. Well, a little blackmail in a good cause never hurts. A picture is worth a thousand words, especially when it comes to evidence. Get Carla on the case, and the way will be lighted for you. Check out with Lupe, and then you're ready for some tricky tickie work. After that, Nick should be very willing to help get your pal out of the slammer. If you're having trouble finding the second betting window at the track, don't feel bad—you can't see this when you come up the stairs. So walk to the left to find the window. Read the plaque by the stuffed cat, showing \"second week.\" Putting it all together, it means you use Charlie's machine to fake a stub for Week 2, Tuesday, Race #6. Then take it to the other window and show it there. The photo the clerk shows you is the blackmail shot; you switch it for the race pic.

"Half-Life GAMER'S EDGE Sound Advice for Killing Your Friends Datacore by Jesse Hiatt f you're fortunate enough to have access to a LAN and some speedy rigs (Pentium 300+), the following maps and strategies will help you to master the Datacore and Stalkyard levels. These are both closequarter maps in which the action is fast and furious. So saddle up, lock and load, and get ready for carnage. This is a great level for honing your skills on the MP5 and its handy grenade launcher. Note the three places where grenades are available, including the one hidden in the shadows at point A. If you're fond of the crossbow, resist the temptation to lurk under the stairs or at point B-both positions are vulnerable. If you set up shop at point you won't have as much coverage, but by scooting around the ledge you can maintain the element of surprise. And if you just gotta have 'em, crawl through the duct at point D and jump to a handful of snarks. See the Review FEBRUARY ISSUE. 5 STARS 206 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

A sliding door at point F will grant you access to three satchel charges, and the Stalkyard is rife with opportunities to use them. For you sniping fans, by far the best place to hide is at point G. There's great coverage from this point, no one can see you in the shadows, and there are two health power-ups that you can grab if you get routed. There is a hole in the floor at point H that you can use to drop satchel charges on passers-by in the passage, below.

Riders should look about 20 feet down the trail to the path they next want to take. If you look down that smooth line along the left side of those whoops, that's where you'll go. Look at that big rock in the trail and you'll be pulling your helmet out of a tree. The point is that you need to plan which line you are going to take through the next section of the course.

All serious gamers will use at least some of the command and fog-of-war options. These features set a premium on organized movement, so don't charge ahead like a herd of kamikaze turtles. Instead, turn on the \"Show Organization.\" \"Save Points for Firing.\" and \"Save Points for Unloading\" toggles. Have one unit take the point on advance, then follow up with an organized, massed fire or close assault next turn. All missions have enough turns for a planned, thoughtful approach. Use the big guns. Artillery is always an ace in the hole if you hit something. Check if your target is immobile or in cover. If so, target its present hex. If not, consider if the target will advance toward cover, toward one of your weaker units, or toward a victory hex; then target the anticipated move. The Al has a habit of stopping in a victory hex instead of moving through it. You can take advantage of this by pulling back from a victory hex and then pounding it in anticipation of a counterattack. Likewise, keep your units moving so the computer's artillery hits empty air. Leapfrog your staff officers. Handling battalion headquarters (HO) is the most important command decision in the game. They are the essential last link to the \"sharp end\" but have the shortest range: eight hexes. Fortunately, they come in pairs, so you can leave one stationary while you move the other forward.
