"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH CGW'S DARK CONSPIRACY I just picked up your November issue and enjoyed it as always, but was left with a nagging suspicion. There is an evil bias at work in the office of CGW There is a deserving game withheld from your list of Top 10 Games From The Dark Side, and I fear I know why it isn't there: It's a (Yikes!) console game ported over to the computer. I, of course, am referring to RESIDENT EVIL from Capcom. Perhaps your noses are upturned at this game due to its lowly pedigree, but it is excellent The story slowly unfolds before you as you creep from room to room. Character animations are fluid and realistic and the character you pick to play and the decisions you make really do lead to different results. Management of your supplies is crucial as running out of high-powered ammo can leave you in very precarious situations. Plus, it's fun and the scariest game I have ever played! I used to have a superiority complex about my computer, but RESIDENT Evil made me purchase a PlayStation. Now your readers don't even have to do that. I don't know if anything has been lost in the port, but if it's the same game, you are depriving your readers, and yourselves, of a great experience. Try it, you'll like it. And, if you can get off that high horse long enough, COLDENEYE 007 is, even as we spcak, attempting to persuade me to buy a Nintendo 64. Aaaaarrrrgh! Looking forward to the glowing review! Bill Harries, Phocnix AZ I WANT MY AGP! I subscribed to your wonderful magazine when I first bought my computer. At the time, it was state-of-the-art: a blazing Pentium 120MHz with an incredible 16 Megs of RAM, 1.6GB hard drive, and a 6x CD-ROM. I was very happy. I love computer games, and so I was content. Now, two years later, my once wonderful machine is below the system requirements of many games. I have AH-64D LONGBOW, and was eagerly awaiting LONGBOW 2. I heard about the game being finally posted on the Jane's Web site, so I went for a look. On the FAQ list, a question asked, \"Will I need a supermachine to run LONGBOW Z?\" And they answered, \"No.\" I was overjoyed, until I read the rest. It read, \"LONGBOW 2 will run on any P133.\" I wanted to cry. I am new to this computer game stuff, with only two years behind me. That's why 1 am writing the experts. I want an MMX, 3D Card, fast machine, and more RAM. I want DVD. I want AGP big-time. So, tell me, when will I need to upgrade? I want to be able to run these games badly. But I love the computer I have right now. How will I find a good machine that will last me, say three years, without blowing my wallet and without many problems? Thanks. John McClain from the Internet We can help you find a smoking computer around the $2,500 mark that shouldn't blow the budget. Just check out the second part of our annual Ultimate Game Machine series. It's right here in this issue (pg 122). Unfortunately, I can't promise you three years. Processor capacity seems to be doubling every 18 months or so (Moore's law originally had this happening every two years, but everything's speeding upeven the rate of advancement) and new generations of machines seem to hit every six months or so. You can't expect design teams not to want to use the latest and greatest, so this hobby seems to have an upgrade curve faster than any other. Of course, you can always hang onto it for three years and hang out in the bargain bins of software stores, waiting for the old stuff to trickle down to your machine. All of us have been there at one time or another. Unfortunately, as you'll notice in this month's review, the computer version of RESIDENT Evil had lots of bugs (and we don't mean the kind in the Starship Troopers movie, either). We hope that any eventual computer versions of ColdenEye 007 will be spared such indignities, since it is truly a marvelous game, but we can't be surc. As for our anticonsole bias, we plead guilty, but consider this: NIGHTMARE CREATURES is in that Top 10 list and it had its debut on the PlayStation. So, I guess we've alreadly fallen off that horse. (But, it was rocking very fast, and Jeff Green got caught in the rockers.) Ultimate tama  OUT OF LINE ROLE-PLAYING I have recently been playing both DRACON REALMS and ULTIMA ONLINE and I'm sad to say I have found both a rather off-putting experience. I have been playing RPG since Dungeons and Dragons appeared in around 1977 or 1978. I've played on computers since the C-64. I still found both of these games, as different as they are, to be quite a disappointment. On the technical front, both have problems with lag, much more so with U than DR (I presume because of its graphic intensive nature). To what extent it is also a function of totally inadequate server capacity is a The $2500 Challenge Page 122 CGW JANUARY 1998 "

"the computer Same Magazine LETTERS computer Gaming world question that remains, although I suppose the fact that I am in the UK may make this worse than for you Yanks! On UO, there were several instances of my character being frozen in place, whilst other players went about their business, after which I might be able to move or might get dropped due to a lost connection. Both games, however, turned out to have a quite unexpected drawback to this newbie.\" I had thought that other real players time taken to get going. To have them arbitrarily frustrated leaves me mad. Both games need to have a bit of a think about what they do with this problem. Lots of people clearly play and enjoy them immensely, but I seriously doubt that they can keep getting new players at a good rate with these problems. Lots may join but they will churn-cancel their subs and move on. I have already done so with DR. Having bought the UO software (for $40 in the UK) I camot as easily walk away from UO. Both games nccd nursery areas to allow new players to get going without have to meet unmatchable risks and both game publishers need to rethink their policing policies. UO, in particular, seems to pride itself on being a real environment. That it is not. Most of the cash in circulation in that economy must have come from theft from new players! Chris Airey from the Internet Designers who fail to learn the lessons of virtual history are doomed to repeat them. We've always known that online games need a beginner zone cquivalent to a ski lodge's \"bunny slope.\" What we can't understand is why this type of environment isn't being designed would be great and certainly in DR they were, by and large. In UO, I did not manage to stay alive and connected for long enough to really find out. The surprise is that the players in both are a real problem. Preying on newbies is a favorite tactic: In DR, thieves clean you out all the time, and in UO, other players will kill you. Worse, in DR, preying on others is a design feature. The thich class has no real choice and must prey on other players to prosper. Oddly though, you are not allowed to fight back, and unless you catch them at it, which you won't if they are much more skilled than you, you won't even be able to seek redress. You'll get dragged out by them and killed, or sanctioned by the GMs for causing trouble with another player. I have no objection to taking my chances with a game. If you could not lose, it would not be fun, but I am afraid that in these there were no chances. Players of such great superiority prey on you that you cannot do anything about it. If I, asa GM in a conventional game, did that to my players, they would rapidly stop turning up! In a real-death environment, where you cannot restore a backup and try again, I personally find this inequality very off-putting. Local calls are not free in most of the UK and spending hours and hours laboriously training up a character is expensive, given the PUBLISHER Dale Strang EDITORIAL Editor-in-Chief Johnny Wilson Executive Editor Ken Brown Features Editor Denny Alkin (Simulations) Reviews Editor Terry Coleman (Wargames, Classics/Puzzle Games) Technical Editor Dave Salvator (Hardware) Associate Editors Jeff Green (Adventure, Sports) Elliott Chin (Action, Strategy) CG-ROM Associate Editor Kate Hedstrom News Editor Charlotte Panther Assistant Editor Allen Greenberg Copy Editor Joe Vallina Editorial Assistant Matthew Schaefer CG-ROM Assistant Thierry \"Scooter\" Nguyen Editorial Intern Tahsin Shamma Contributing Editors Scorpia (Adventure Games) Charles Ardai (Interactive Fiction) Loyd Case (Hardware) Martin Cirulis (Science Fiction) Founder Russell Sipe DESIGN Art Director Dan Fitzpatrick Associate Art Director Steven Wanczyk Web Commander Jack Rodrigues PRODUCTION Production Director Carlos Lugo Assistant Production Mgr.

"News MicroProse Takes Aim Sneak Peeks at Its Hot Games Lineup 000000000000000 >> Simutronics Corp. and Universal Studios Online are teaming up to develop an online multiplayer game based on the Hercules: Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess series. The game environment will feature the creatures and locations from the TV series, marking the first time a television property has been translated into an online fantasy role-playing game. The game is set to pre. miere in the second quarter of 1998. For more information. check http/Ixena.play.net. Guardians: Agents of Justice Starship Troopers T Interactive might own MicroProse now, but the folks in Alameda and their five development studios are conducting business as usual. We recently visited the company and took a peek at its holiday and early 1998 prod. ucts, many of which will recall the vibrant and sophisticated games of MicroProse's heyday. Leading the lineup was ULTIMATE Civ II, which includes the original Civ II, the first expansion pack, and the long-awaited multiplayer mode. The mere idea of playing Civ II with friends is enough to make our mouths water. Unlike CivNet, there will be no simultaneous movement, but you will be able to man. age cities, chat, and trade with other players when the primary player is moving his units. ULTIMATE Civ II will support up to seven players, and gamers will be able to join games dynamically by jumping into an Al civilization's shoes. MicroProse says that ULTIMATE Civ II will ship sometime around March 1998. The other Civ product on display was the scenario pack, FANTASTIC WORLDS, which includes a graphically based scenario editor and a collection of great fantasy and sci-fi scenarios. This product, which should be on store shelves by the time you read this, offers a dinosaur scenario; a Jules Verne map, in which the key to victory is discovery and exploration, and MASTER OF MAGIC and MASTER OF ORION Scenarios. The pack includes all new units, buildings, and terrain. Probably the second most anticipated multiplayer patch is MAGIC THE GATHERING'S MANA LINK, which was also shown at MicroProse. This multiplayer mode will be available in the DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS bundle pack, which includes >>Continued on pg 74 » The release date of DOUGLAS ADAMS STARSHP Titanic, the upcoming graphic adventure from Simon & Schuster and The Digital Village, has been postponed until early 1998.

Gamers who purchase Tex MURPHY. OVERSEER will find that they can choose to play the game using either four CD-ROMs or one DVD. Access is excited about the leap to DVD, believing it to be the best possible medi um for their graphically heavy adventure games. Right now, though, they are anxious to accommodate all users, until the full conver sion to DVD occurs. cutting edge of technology and wants to stay that way, and sec. ond, Access believes that the path that DVD technology is tak ing mirrors exactly what the company is striving to create in its games-a combination of \"technology with artistry.\" Jones believes that the new medium will allow Access to involve the audience at a level they've never been able to achieve before. Jones works closely with screenwriter Aaron Conners, who joined the Tex Murphy development team for UNDER A KILLING Moon, and later wrote the novel that became THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE. The two of them wanted to include elements of film noir, along with gritty, compelling characters, in the game. Both are quick to agree, though, that, first and foremost, OVERSEER IS a game, not a movie. Nonetheless, Access has managed to snag a Hollywood-caliber cast for OVERSEER, with Michael York (fresh from his Austin Powers success) heading up the list as a wheelchair bound, billionaire recluse The first of three new Tex Murphy adventures, OVERSEER takes place directly after THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE, but the storyline-a recounting of the events leading up to Tex's first great case-is told in flashbacks by Tex to his \"long-standing almost girlfriend.\" Chelsee. The story relates how Tex is hired by the beautiful Sylvia Linsky, his first client-later to become his wife-to investigate the apparent suicide of her father. Access has also revealed that a feature film of THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE is in the works. Tentatively titled A Black Sun Ascending, the movie, adapted from Conners' novel, will cross three genres, incorporating elements of science fiction, P.I. movies, and Indiana Jones-type adventures. Adrian Carr, who directed the last two Tex Murphy games, will also be directing the movie, so Access can rest assured that the character of Tex and the general atmosphere of the games will remain intact. Carr promises that the movie will focus upon elements that were overlooked in the book and that it will have a different ending. Look out for updates on the movie and on the next two Tex Murphy games over the next few months. -Charlotte Panther >> Empire Interactive recently announced that it has teamed up with master golfer Gary Player for its latest golf game-aptly titled THE GOLF PRO. Gamers can choose to play as Gary Player, or against him, and can receive golfing tips from the man himself. THE GOLF Pro will also feature an innovative mouse control, Mousedrive, which Empire claims feels remarkably close to a real golf swing. Mousedrive allows players to make the widest range of shots with just a flick of the wrist, instead of using the traditional three click method of swing control. THE GOLF PRO will offer three major game play typesstroke play, match play, and Stableford-all of which can be played multiplayer (up to 32 players) via network, modem, and Internet. Look out for a full sneak preview of GOLF Pro in next month's CGW.

Cirulis Westwood Studios, (800) 874-4607 PC CD-ROM Reader Service #: 308 THE X-FOOLS Is it a government cover up? An alien invasion? An insatiable need to cash in on The X-Files? When you're talking about Parroty Interactive's new spoof, THE X Fools, I'm afraid it's the latter. You play an agent trainee working with two ex agents. Mully and Scudder, to uncover an alien plot that uses the X-Files show to control the world. The dialogue is usually funny (Scudder's voice sounds a lot like Scully's) and some of the interactive bits are laughable (albeit groaners), but the game doesn't spoof the actual show enough, and focuses too much on generic conspiracy lore. It could have been bet ter. Only for hard-core X-Philes. ---Joe Vallina Parroty Interactive, (800) 910-2696 Win/Mac CD-ROM Reader Service #: 309 >> Disney Interactive recently made a decision to drop its OT Sports division, developers of the MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL and HEROES OF THE Grillion titles. Although two thirds of the OT Sports staff were laid off, General Manager Deborah Wahler confirmed that a skelelon crew has been retained to finish INDY RACING, which will be released in time for the holiday season, and to provide support for MNF and GRIDIRON. According to Wahler, this move follows a decision by Disney to concentrate on its core market of Children's and Edutainment software.

Last year, it was Fox's INDEPENDENCE DAY. This year it's MEN IN In the Works BLACK: THE GAME, developed by Gigawatt Studios (formerly Chronic Entertainment) and brought to us by South Peak Interactive. At least this game isn't just another piece of FMV-tiller-there's actually a game intercut with comic book style mon tage scenes that tell the story. Gameplay is similar to the classic ALONE IN THE DARK Or the recent RESIDENT EVIL, in that you control a character in the third-person perspective as you solve puzzles and engage in com bat with a variety of enemies. In the first part of the game, you play Edwards (Will Smith's character). You move about in the game world, gradually learning about the MiB and about a global conspiracy that serves as the game's main plot. As the game progresses, you can choose to continue as Smith's character or become one of the other main players-Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K or Linda Fiorentino's character, the first \"Woman In Black.\" All in all, while the comic book style montage is a bit strange, the gameplay is better than other movie licensed games.

A Discovery Channel release, Byzantine alms to educate as well as entertain, couching its lessons in geogra. phy, history, and more in a traditional adventure game focusing on a mystery filled hunt for an ancient diadem in Istanbul. While extensive full-motion video is good at capturing street life and landmarks, it feels as if the game is constantly interrupted by an average TV documentary.

But with only one melee allack, half a pocket ful of spells, and a tiny menagerie of monsters, MAGESLAYER's limited gameplay quickly deteriorates into a dreary, repetitive exercise in carnage, despite the frequently hectic action. Traps and puzzles are similarly lacking originality, coughing up the same old crushing walls and moving platforms gamers have been dealing with for years. Even four character types and three multiplayer games can't keep this game from being a ho-hum affair.-Robert Coffey GT Interactive, (800) 469-5961 Win 95 CD-ROM Reader Service #: 311 COLD CGW JANUARY 1998 "

And, as anticipated, it has caused quite a stir-though not a uniformly positive one. After forking over their $60, plus $9.95 a month to connect, early adventurers in the ULTIMA ONLINE World have bombarded the Internet newsgroups complaining of a host of frustrating problems (experienced by CGW staffers, as well), including serv er crashes, slow lag-times, overcrowded environments, lack of direction or objectives, poor NPC interaction, lack of a decent printed manual, and more-leading to cries that the game was released before it was ready ULTIMA uber-lord Richard Garriott (Lord British) remains mostly unre. Garriott says that though they were pentant about the game's release, well aware of problems when they and displays great optimism about chose to shrinkwrap the game, the its continued future and viability. public beta tests were simply not help. \"We're confident that we released ing the team achieve any kind of real it at the right play balance. time,\" says \"We felt that we Garriott. \"We were in a hold thought about it ing pattern, and very hard on a that the only way weekly basis, with lo really balance much debate, and the game was to it was unanimous let people in and across the team play it,\" he adds. that now was the According to time.\" Garriott, the game's biggest problem is that there has been The Ultima Online far greater Development Team demand for it Now (as of October 27] we have seven servers, and we'll soon have 10 to 15,\" says Garriott Garriott argues that these kind of numbers actually point to the game's success. \"We've had 10,000 new users a week since day one,\" he says. And the \"Average amount of play time is four to six hours every day per person. Sure there are people bitching, but there are a lot more people having a great time.\" Regarding bugs, server crashes, and game balancing issues, Lord British has this to say: \"People have to understand that this is a gigantic, grand experiment, with tons of new code, a new type of code, running around the world across a number of large servers. (Game balancing and bugs) will be issues forever, since we intend to add features for ever. We have to educate people that it will always be this way. Our attitude that everyone must be happy at every moment is changing. There are lots of people who get what we're doing and are having a great, great time, and that's who we're making this game for. If you don't get it, well, we hope we catch you the next time around.\" So, is Lord British worried about his longtime, ambitious project? \"I'd be worried if there was this much complaining and the game was not selling-then I'd feel we were doing something horribly wrong. People are finding many valid things to complain about, but we're working to fix them as fast as we can. We want this to be a journey that we all take together.\" Jeff Green than anyone anticipated, which is over. whelming the team and the servers. Because of what was perceived as a prohibitive Internet requirement, early expectations put sales at around 25,000 copies, but by this summer, after gauging vendor interest and preorders, the number had swelled to over 150,000. Says Garriott, \"This had a profound impact on the development team,\" as it meant they had to rescale the game to meet the new expectations. \"Originally, we were going to run the world from here at Origin, with one server set and a couple T1 lines. Just a few weeks before the release, though, we realized that we needed three server sets, which proved insufficient even in the first week.

DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS will be available by Christmas. Among the other games showcased by MicroProse were its Star Trek titles, which include two first-person action games using the UNREAL engine-FIRST CONTACT and KLINGON HONOR GUARDand a new turn-based strategy game, BIRTH OF THE FEDERATION, which is like a Star Trek MASTER OF ORION. BIRTH OF THE FEDERATION allows you to take the reigns of five of Star Trek's premier races-Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Ferengi, and Cardassian-and take them from prewarp times to control of the galaxy. In addition to fighting and dealing with your neighbors, you'll also have to contend with the Borg, who will appear from time to time to terrorize the inhabitants of the galaxy. FIRST CONTACT is a late 1997 release, while KLINGON and FEDERATION are slated for mid-1998 releases. Look for a preview of these Star Trek games in an upcoming issue of CGW. The other movie license MicroProse has is Starship Troopers. The game currently on display at MicroProse is reminiscent of MECHWARRIOR 2. You X-COM: Interceptor run around 3D terrain in a powersuit, but you're blasting insectoid aliens instead of mechs. STARSHIP TROOPERS will feature small tactical control of squadmates, as well as a deathmatch mode for over 20 players. The game is listed as a Spring 1998 release. Other games on show included FALCON 4.0, the revolutionary sim that is this month's cover story: XCOM INTERCEPTOR, which is a 3D space sim that takes place in the X-Com universe prior to APOCALYPSE; WORMS 2, a funny and irreverent game of dueling, armed worms that is a cross between LEMMINGS and CANNON FODDER: AGENT OF JUSTICE, the X-COM-like superhero game that MicroProse says will ship by spring; and MECHCOMMANDER, the real-time game based in the Battletech universe. Most of these latter titles are all slated for spring 1998, at the earliest. So, while MicroProse has been quiet lately, the news is good for strategy and sim fans, as the company is hard at work on bringing back big names, such as Civ, FALCON, MAGiC, and Star Trek to the gaming community. --Elliott Chin Wwwmnegames.com : GED de ese Klingon: Honor Guard ou'll no longer find 3D Iron Works in READ.ME, but if you IRON WORKS turn to page 194 you'll find it in its new home at the beginning of the hardware section.

"PREVIEWS POPULOUS: THE THIRD COMING Your Best Source for the Hottest Games in Development WRATH OF THE GODS The cinematic intro to Pop 3 sets the tone for this game of religious conquest. All pagans will be converted or die. Highlight of the Gods POPULOUS: THE THIRD COMING Has What It Takes to Be a Religious Experience by Scott A. May ime sure does fly when you're busy ruling the universe. POPULOUS: THE THIRD COMING, the long-awaited, third installment in Bullfrog's breakthrough fran chise, is finally nearing comple: tion. And not a moment too soon. While veteran gamers grow misty eyed just thinking about the beloved original, a new generation of players is clueless to the whole phenomenon. For those unfortunate souls, here's a brief history lesson. DUNGEON KEEPER. Molyneux recently split with the company to form LionHead with Steve Jackson. Does this mean an end to the Bullfrog we know and love? Not hardly. POPULOUS: THE THIRD COMING, the first Bullfrog game since Molyneux's departure, promises to recapture the flavor and simple purity that made the original such a ground-breaking hit. brand-new gaming genre: the god-sim. Its premise, both simple and ingeniously clever, cast players in the role of gods, nurturing a primitive race of mere mortals. As gods, gamers c ould raise or lower land, and trigger earth quakes, floods, and volcanoes, all with a single click of their mighty mouse. Lead by programming virtuoso Peter Molyneux, Bullfrog followed the success of POPULOUS with POWERMONGER, arguably the fore. runner of today's real-time multiplayer strategy games. A year later, POPULOUS II: TRIALS OF THE OLYMPIAN Gods appeared. It attempted to merge the best elements of the two previous titles. Despite strong sales, neither game captured the imaginative qualities of the original POPULOUS. In recent years, Bullfrog has emerged as one of the leaders in cutting-edge game design, with titles such as SYNDICATE, MAGIC CARPET, and POPULOUS 101 Originally released in 1989 and since ported to 20 different formats, POPULOUS sold more than three million copies worldwide and launched the career of then-fledgling British developer Bullfrog. The title also introduced a THEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING In THE THIRD COMING, gamers are cast in the role of gods, each competing for control of a planet. Your alter ego on this mortal coil is the Shaman, a spiritual leader through whom you cast all spells. Upon entering the world, the Shaman creates a Reincarnation Site.

"PREVIEWS JOURNEYMAN PROJECT 3: LEGACY OF TIME Target Release Date: Christmas 1997 Developer: Presto Studios Publisher: Red Orb Broderbund Time Travelogue There's More Time-travel Magic in JOURNEYMAN PROJECT 3 by Terry Coleman Now, two years later, Presto seems ready to pull another rabbit out of its magic hat. JOURNEYMAN PROJECT 3: LEGACY OF TIME is bigger, more mysterious, and much more beautiful than any previous PC time-travel trip. And, irony of ironies, this well-traveled JOURNEYMAN will be released this time around by the publisher of Myst itself, Red Orb. I'm really wor. ried. Could I possibly be forced to admit a fondness for two Myst clones? have a confession to make. I didn't much like Myst-though I did grudg. ingly respect it as a form of art-and like the dozens of bastard children Myst has sired even less. The original at least had a certain Twilight Zone quality to make up for its lapses in plot, its predictability, and its empty, sometimes barren, environment. Most Myst-clones lack in atmosphere (and basic coherency) almost as much as they do in characters with which you might converse. It's only fair to point out that there are two sides to every story, even mine. You see, much as I hate to admit it, there's one Myst-alike I truly enjoyed: BURIED IN TIME, the second of the JOURNEYMAN PROJECT series from Presto Studios. I wanted to loathe that game just as I did the first overhyped and overacted JOURNEYMAN PROJECT but I couldn't. It was too nicely constructed, too gorgeous, and well...it was actually fun. TIMING IS EVERYTHING While time travel is a sci-fi staple, its uses for both plot and characterization have varied wide. ly over the past century. LEGACY OF TIME tries to position itself squarely between the social com mentary of H.G. Wells' The Time Machine and the crowd-pleasing frivolity of Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future. In reality, the game is clos est to Poul Anderson's Time Patrol novels, which is not at all a bad thing. As in BURIED IN TIME, here you portray Temporal Agent Gage Blackwood, whose dash. ing, handsome brand of heroism fails to hide his ignorance of the majority of events from the previous game. The confused Gage is hardly to blame; after completing his mission, Gage was brainwiped. This is, admittedly, a novel way to ensure that any LEGACY gamer unfamiliar with BURIED IN TIME will be on an even footing with veterans of the series. Still, such treatment of heroes-especially one who overcomes being framed, then manages to preserve the proper flow of history-can hardly give you confidence in this particular sci-fi future. If this isn't bad enough, you find that the Temporal Security Agency is being shut down while the government investigates a danger from beyond the solar system. Just when you begin to contemplate a respite from 24thcentury sitcoms and processed soy/meat products, what could possibly be sighted but a temporal rift? But what can you do? Your timesuit's power coil is under government control along with all the others! There's no time to cut through the red tape, but luckily, your head technical officer is as much a maverick as CGW's. He sneaks you into a hidden alcove, straps you into the top-secret Chameleon timesuit (while he gives you a quick tour of the interface), and tosses you into the temporal breach. O 026 010 MY OWN PRIVATE EL DORADO The source of the temporal rift is none other than your old nemesis, the beautiful and deadly Agent 3, still at large after BURIED IN TIME. She leads you on a wild chase through the past, where you see the fabled cities of Atlantis, El Dorado, and Shangri-La. The problem is, all of these mythic lands have been destroyed. And what's more, they have been left without a single survivor. LOST PARADISE The best part of JOURNEYMAN 3 is that you get to investigate cities like Shangri-La both before-and after their untimely destruction. CGW JANUARY 1998 "


"PREVIEWS 6 Under a Blood-Red Sky Your trusty Chameleon timesuit lets you store images from different time eras, so you can disguise yourself as a native. This is important, because unlike most Myst-alikes, JOURNEYMAN 3 actually has nonplayer characters. As in any good sci-fi mystery, the questions begin to pile up. What news could be so terrible that Agent 3 would turn herself in to share it? Who was that mysterious man fleeing the destruction of Atlantis? Were those truly spaceships belonging to your alien allies, the Cyrollans, that you saw firing on the temples at Shangri-La? Why, with all of this going on, is the Earth's government willing to shut down the Temporal Security Agency? Since the beta is almost totally complete, I could give you all the answers. But that would be even more cruel than causing Atlantis to once again sink beneath the waves, because JOURNEYMAN 3 looks to be one of the true sleepers of this year. The game's new 3D engine alone is a vast improvement over that of BURIED IN TIME. While you don't get the sense of vertigo one experiences looking TILTING AT WINDMILLS This is a real gameplay screen, over a and you can interact with several of the objects, such as precipice in the oars in the lake. JEDI KNIGHT, JOURNEYMAN 3 does have a sense of visual depth that is sorely lacking in most adventure games. When you add in the well-constructed puz: zles that derive from the game's plot, and the taut sci-fi/mystery storyline, this game has the potential to be not only the best Myst-alike in some time, but also one of the best adventure games of the year. If there's any justice, the game will sell well enough that a year or two from now, we'll get a fourth time-travel tale. What a true LEGACY OF TIME that would be. Arthur returns as your Artificial Intelligence sidekick. While he is, if anything, more annoying than in BURIED IN TIME, Arthur is informative and a great source of hints. Plus, you can control the number of comments that he makes. For all its visual style, JOURNEYMAN 3 still carries some traditional adventure-game baggage. At least when you bring up your inventory by clicking here, it looks as though you're accessing data from inside a timesuit. 1 The view from the inside of your timesuit is similar 1 to viewing a movie in wide-screen, or \"letterbox\" format. Sure, it's a little corny, but it's a visual metaphor that we're all familiar with and it works well here. This bar, inactive now, is your interface with the timestream. While it's really just a fancy pull-down menu, it looks neat, and it is simple to use. Puzzles in JOURNEYMAN 3 are varied: Unlike those in most Myst-alikes, however, almost all of these puzzles derive from the plot. Here, you must repair the rope and get aboard the hot air balloon above. 7 Terrain is more than just pretty pictures. Looking directly into the sun or walking through the volcano's mist will obscure your vision. O Your Chameleon timesuit won't shield you from some O horrific sights: in this case, scattered debris that comprises the remains of the beautiful, mythical city of El Dorado. JANUARY 1998 CGW "

"PREVIEWS AIR WARRIOR III Target Release Date: First Quarter 1998 Developer: Kesmai Publisher: Interactive Magic Brains and Beauty AIR WARRIOR III Gets Intelligence and Graphics Updates by Denny Atkin WHISTLING DEATH Improved Al means that AiR WARRIOR III's Corsairs won't get into turning fights with Zeros. esmai's AiR WARRIOR set a number of prece dents. It was the first online multiplayer flight simulation, one of the first high-resolution Aflight sims, and the first World War II sim to attempt realistic flight modeling. By the time Interactive Magic published Air WARRIOR II in 1996, however, the program had a \"retro\" feel, with graphics not much improved from its late 1980s incarnations. Although the program had lots going for it, many gamers wrote it off because of its outdated look. Soon, Air WARRIOR will be back in both boxed and online versions with a whole new look--one so good that you'll spend enough time with it to notice its interesting personality. AiR WARRIOR III'S most obvious enhancement is its support for 3D graphics cards. If your system has a Direct 3Dcompliant graphics card, you'll be treated to fully textured aircraft and terrain. And between its hardware graphics acceleration and its use of fewer polygons in objects when texture maps provide additional detail, you should see a frame rate that's much improved over the earlier version's. (The original unmapped polygon graphics will still be available if you don't yet have a 3D card.) BOGEYS AT SIX In online play, you can fly as a gunner, offline, you can put the plane in autopilot and jump to any crew position to defend your craft. ALUMINUM OVERCAST The B-17s may look better here, but they're still inviting targets for Axis fighters. boom-and-zoom techniques, taking a shot and then extending their range before coming around for another pass. Turn-fighters, of course, will take advantage of their maneuverability. In addition to the new graphics and better Al, the boxed version will feature some 150 new missions along with the 250-odd missions from the previous game. Many of the new missions will take place in the Pacific theater, an area neglected in the first release. PILOT TRAINING AIR WARRIOR I had one glaring deficiency: the single-mindedness of the computer-flown air. craft. Fighters would almost always engage in turning fights-which wasn't much of a challenge when you were flying a Zero and the computer was in an energy fighter such as the P-40. In the updated version, Ace level Al pilots who are flying energy fighters will examine the energy. state differential between their planes and yours. If they have the energy advantage, they'll use proper Now, historical play has been automated. While the free-for-all battle arenas will still be available, there will be ongoing historical campaigns as well. You'll be able to go online, view a briefing, and then join others on organized missions with concrete goals. The mission editor will support branches for outstanding victory, success, partial victory, and failure, so that a campaign can take a variety of turns depending on the performance of each side. These missions will be much like those in the solo campaign, but with humans flying each plane. The boxed version of AIR WARRIOR III should be available in January 1998. The online only version is slated to go into beta-testing in late November 1997 and should be available as a free download, with free play during the beta period, at www.bigweek.com. CAMPAIGN PROMISES AIR WARRIOR'S online component will see big improvements as well. In the past, most Air WARRIOR online play involved pilots flying for three imaginary countries in a constant battle for territo ry. At times, historical missions would be orga. nized, but they would take much planning and constant involvement from scenario organizers. CGW JANUARY 1998 "

"VVhen [the team] started FALCON 3.0, this was what they wanted to do. But what could you really do on a 386? They had to say, 'Okay, this is what we can do.' So this is the continuation of that dream. -Tom Nichols, MicroProse CGW JANUARY 1998 "


"Falcon Finally HUFlies Test Flying the Long-Awaited Sequel to the King of Jet Simulations BY DENNY ATKIN JANUARY 1998 JANUARY 1998 CGW "


"FALCON 4.0 or a long time, it seemed as if FALCON 4.0 was just a concept for a future flight simula. tion, not a product that would actually ship. I first saw a demonstration of the program way back in the fall of 1994, when Spectrum HoloByte gave everyone a \"sneak peek\" at a party the company held to unveil TOP GUN. A lot has happened since that time. Spectrum HoloByte became MicroProse, which then became a divi sion of GT Interactive. Numerous members of that original FALCON 4.0 development team have moved on to other places (\"worked on FALCON 4.0\" is a common entry on résumés throughout the simu lation industry), and the design, which originally featured a trendy (at the time) full-motion-Video interactive airbase, has seen a number of revi sions and at least one \"ground-up\" code rewrite. With all that under the bridge, many gamers became concerned that FALCON 4.0 would never make it to market. And even if it did, they feared that it might either be outdated or just a mess. After spending some quality time with a late devel. opment version of the game, I'm happy to say that neither of those is the case. In fact, despite the sim's troubled gestation, the version I've been fly. ing gives every indication that FALCON 4.0 will advance the flight Simulation genre at least as much as FALCON 3.0 did. FINAL APPROACH Notice that the detail of the plane extends down to textures on the inside of the wheel wells and speed brakes that was to upgrade the graphics, sound, and flight models to--and past-the current state-ofthe-art. In addition, the sim now focuses on the latest technology Falcon, the F-16C Block 50/52, including its new engine and avionics. Leon Rosenshein, who developed F-16 simu lation technology for the U.S. Air Force before joining MicroProse three years ago as the tech nology lead on FALCON 4.0, said another initial goal was finally to bring the electronic battle field\" concept-in which different simulations can hook up and battle over the same terrain-to life. The beginnings were there in FALCON 3.0, which could share a networked battlefield with the HORNET and MiG-29 add-ons. But that inte gration was via add-ons, this time the team want ed to design the sim from the ground up to fully realize the electronic battlefield. \"Looking back at FALCON 3.0,\" says Nichols, \"one of the things that kept it on the shelves and selling was the campaign. It wasn't the same 30 missions over and over again. The dynamics of the campaign kept changing. We knew we had to do that again, and we had to do that better. We started with the assumption that there will be a real war in the background-full-blown strategy covering the whole theater, and you're a part of that. Not branching trees or prescripted deci sions-it's all dynamic. At any given point the tanks could be anywhere, and your mission could change in the middle.\" Not that any of these ideas are really new to the creators of the FALCON series. \"When they started FALCON 3.0,\" Nichols says, \"this was what they wanted to do. But what could you really do on a 386? They had to say, 'Okay, this is what we can do. So this is the continuation of that dream.\" Gestation The development team's goal with FALCON 4.0 was a simple one: Build the greatest air-combat sim, «just like FALCON 3.0,\" says MicroProse's Tom Nichols. Of course, part of accomplishing The Plane FALCON 3.0 was the first simulation to make a serious attempt to accurately model a real jet fighter's systems and flight characteristics. And although the F-16A portrayed in that sim flew more like an F-15, its modeling PULLING G'S Vapor forms above the Falcon's wing as set new standards. But the comit pulls up sharply. Note the AMRAAM missiles on the petition in those days would be wingtips, a new loadout being used by the USAF considered arcade today. This JANUAR "


"FALCON 4.0 FALCON team has to stand up to much more seri. ous challengers. In fact, there's already been a sim that did a very good job of modeling the F-16C Block 50's systems and performance: MSI'S BACK TO BAGHDAD. But while that sim did a great job mod eling the plane, its canned \"you against the world\" mission structure didn't capture the environment of an F-16 pilot. Although FALCON 4.0's F-16 still had some incomplete cockpit systems in the version I took home from MicroProse, it was evident, even at that late-alpha stage, that it would match or bet ter the systems modeling in BACK TO BAGHDAD. The team is very concerned with making the cockpit experience as accurate as possible. In addition to Rosenshein's defense simulation experience, MicroProse has enlisted the help of F-16 pilot Pete Bonanni (see the sidebar \"Expert Advice\"). Even Gilman Louie, who founded the company when it was known as Spectrum HoloByte, can provide some expert input, since Bonanni took him for a ride in the back seat of an F-16D. The detail and push for authenticity in the FALCON 4.0 cockpit is evidenced nowhere better than in the radar system. Bonanni explains: \"The way modern radars work, a pulse goes out, but another pulse goes out before that pulse will return from a target that's beyond seven miles (that seven miles is called 'the ambiguous range': this is true of F-185, F-15s, and F-16s). The way Leon has it, if he detects a target, he puts it in a slot. The beam has to hit a target a certain amount of times before it will actually display the target, just like in the airplane. If it doesn't get the target a few times, it'll say, That's not a target, that's a false target. He's got it modeled just like the airplane does it, as far as how the airplane sweeps. What it gives you is a really good, accurate radar.\" All of the useful modes of the real F-16C's radar will be modeled; only a few esoteric modes such as the rarely used ground-mapping mode are omitted. If you don't have an interest in learning about radar azimuth, ambiguous ranges, and other aspects of realistic radar, fear not. In addition to realistic radar, a \"God's eye\" radar and a simplified U.S. NAVY FIGHTERS-style display will also be available. The original attempt at a simplified radar didn't go over too well with the less hard-core team members. \"They told Pete and that we weren't allowed to do a simple radar,\" Rosenshein says. \"We did a simple radar,\" Bonanni adds, \"but nobody thought it was simple. So somebody else is doing it.\" One aspect of the FALCON 4.0 that will sport unprecedented detail is the radar warning receiver (RWR). Real-life RWRs don't just display a contact, they emit a tone based on the frequency of that radar's emissions. Although real-life F-16s don't automatically identify what's tracking you-they simply show a symbol-pilots can often determine what has them locked up by the tone of the RWR. I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW You can fly from a full instrument panel, a virtual cockpit view, or pop-up MFDs. FALCON B URE ACESS_X olisited 355TH FRAD ORDER Caters SCHLUSS Later PS TE tar.

"TICIDCO The Computer Gaming World We Test 9 PCs Under $2,500 to Find the Best for Gamers rand Prix race cars cost upwards of several million dollars a pop. That puts them out of reach of most normal humans. On the other hand, there is a class of cars out there that folks call \"pocket rockets.\" No, not that kind of pocket-rocket. These cars are generally small, with a high power-to-weight ratio, sticky tires, and stiff suspensions. Aspiring Andrettis on a budget could buy a pocket rocket and have a car that accelerated handily, turned on a dime, and gave them the illusion that they were in a high-priced sports car. So if the silicon Lamborghinis we wrote about last month seem too exotic (and too expensive) for your needs, here are our takes on the gaming version of the pocket rocket, all of which are available by mail order or right off the shelf of your local computer superstore. We told the systems vendors to send us their best shot at a system for a dedicated gamer who had only $2,500 to spend. That's still a lot of moolah, but at least it's in the realm of reality for many people. Decisions, Decisions... To stay within our maximum $2,500 price point, the vendors actually had to make more interesting choices than they did with their high-end systems. At this price, compromises are necessary. Do you give the user a somewhat faster CPU or better game graphics? How much memory do you install? And what type? Do you ship separate speakers or \"multimedia\" monitors with built-in speakers? These tradeoffs and others make for an interesting set of systems. We saw a lot more variation in both performance and \"fit-and-finish.\" Some systems worked great, right out of the box. Others required a little tweaking (okay, in a couple of cases, a lot of tweaking) to get working. Let's take a look at their choices so we can help you make better choices. After all, it's your $2,500, not theirs. by Loyd Case and Dave Salvator THE ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE UNDRED DOMAT WARSIMINIMUMXZXILMAPAISAW/TALIKX123*786 "

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE IBM \"Aptival31 Its Direct3D game scores were also lacklus. ter, and because the system comes with only 2MB of video memory, several games had graphic or performance problems. The only game that ran reasonably well was Microsoft's FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98, but even it suffered serious texture aliasing. We'd suggest you look elsewhere with your $2,500.-DS ig Blue has certainly had a bumpy ride through the PC revolution. Now wiser for the mileage, IBM is making PC systems that use open-market commodity components, and it has even managed to show some flair for design with its Aptiva line. The unit's monitor features an embedded Bose speaker system, a USB port, and jacks for headphones and a microphone, as well as a volume knob. Getting into the system is fairly straightforward, thanks to a side panel that comes off sans tools. The Aptiva detected the USB joystick without incident, though DirectX was nowhere to be found on the system. Despite the high-profile name, Aptiva's Bose speaker system was unable to produce much in the way of volume, and the speakers seemed strained at higher volume settings-unfortunate considering the presence of Crystal Semiconductor's beefy PCI-based 4610 chipset, a high-powered audio DSP capable of producing impressive 3D-positional audio. IBM Apliva L31 Price: $2,398 (800) 426-3333 www.us.pc.ibm.com/aptiva This Aptiva posted unimpressive numbers. IBM is using Trident's 3D Image 975 chip, but with only 2MB of video memory, which made for glitchy performance. Its 3D WinBench 97 performance was among the slowest. Its 2D Windows numbers and its Business Disk WinMark numbers were also unremarkable. CPU performance ranked on par with other P55C 233MHz systems, and its CD-ROM WinMark numbers were competitive. Quake and WINQUAKE numbers were the slowest of all the boxes we tested. PROS: Interesting monitor design; heavy-duty audio chipset. CONS: 2MB video memory; shaky Trident graphics drivers; uninspired overall performance. RATED ***** GLABS Hewlett-Packard Pavilion 160 The Pavilion 8160's components are fairly typical, though HP's choice of ATI's now aging Rage II + 2D/3D chip hurt it in sever. al key performance areas. Getting into the box is relatively easy: getting back out is another mat ter. That old adage about things being much easier to take apart than reassemble applies here. With a little gentle brute force, we managed to get the unit's side panel back in place. competitive. But Direct3D games caused more than a few headaches: WIPEOUT XL did not run at 640x480, and Moto RACER delivered a frame rate of only 10fps, with incorrectly drawn palm trees. Pavilion did manage 18fps on the TERRAMARK test, but only after we reduced the texture resolution. Despite a few highlights, we can't recommend the Pavilion as a gaming rig.-DS Motherboard layout is clean, and parts are readi: ly accessible. One good piece of news is that the ASUS motherboard will automatically disable the on-board ATI graphics chip if another PCI graph ics card is present in the system. The 8160 arrived with DirectX 3 installed, but not DirectX 5.0. However, real-mode drivers for audio, mouse, and CD-ROM were present and config ured. The unit also detected our USB joystick without any trouble and installed its driver. Put to the test, the Pavilion was an underachiever. Like the IBM Aptiva, the HP box was dogged by problems owing to its slim 2MB of video memory. Its 3D WinBench 97 performance was last among systems with 3D accelerators. Its 2D Windows performance was also unim pressive, as were Disk WinMark, CPU16, and CPU32 numbers. HP's CD-ROM WinMark num bers redeemed the unit somewhat, and its QUAKE unit somewhat, and its QUAKE and WINQUAKE TimeDemo scores were certainly Hewlett-Packard Pavilion 8160 Price: $2,298 (800) 426-3333 www.hp.com/hpd/hp-at-home.html 2  SEWLETT en serie SLABS PROS: Real-mode drivers ready to go.

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Performance Tests How We Tested It's always a challenge to test systems. We assembled quite an arsenal of benchmarks and games to exercise all the systems we gathered. General system testing was performed with WinBench 97; we used the Business Graphics WinMark, Business Disk WinMark, CD-ROM WinMark, CPUMark 16, and CPUMark 32. Benchmarking 3D graphics began with 3D WinBench 97 and continued with a host of games, including MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98, EA's Moto RACER, Psygnosis' WIPEOUT XL, Eidos! TERRAMARK, and QUAKE (DOS, Win Quake, and GL QUAKE where appropriate). We also benchmarked DOS performance using CBench. We conducted the synthetic tests with each system just as it came out of the box, since most people don't tweak with BIOS settings or defrag the hard disk to move all the applications to the outer tracks. The Graphics WinMark tests were conducted at 1024x768x65,565 colors and The $2500 Challenge 800x600xtrue color (24-bit color for some sys. tems, 32 bit color for others). In addition to the CD-ROM WinMark, we measured the CPU utilization for the CD-ROM.

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE SLABS track performance will be better. Since most CDs aren't full, though, you'll rarely see the maximum performance possible on some systems. Many system tests are performed out of context, to stress a single part of the system. While we did our share of those kinds of tests (3D WinBench 97, for example), game testing was performed with audio enabled and, where appropriate, joysticks connected. After all, you wouldn't play FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 with the keyboard and no audio, would you? Ultimately, we wanted to see how the systems behaved with realistic loads. We conducted all the game tests at 640x480, unless otherwise noted. The QUAKE numbers are collected using QUAKE's built-in TimeDemo feature. We ran TimeDemos 1, 2, and 3 and averaged the results. We ran MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 with detail features cranked up and in full screen mode. You enable the frame-rate counter by pressing Shift Z twice when in flight mode. We cap tured the frame rate using the supplied \"new features\" VCR replay that comes with the title. To enable the frame counter in Moto RACER, start the game from a DOS Window and type \"moto -ijklmnop\". Then, in the racing screen, hit Shift-F1 to turn on the frame counter.

CPU for under $2,500, it had to cut some fairly serious corners to get there. Most notably, by using a 440FX-based Intel mother board in lieu of the newer AGP equipped 440LX chipset, it limits performance. The LX chipset better handles system traffic-cop chores for memory access, and AGP allows 3D games to make better use of system memory as well as use more textures and polygons for more realistic scenes. The Trident 975 graphics chip turns out to be not such a great choice for gamers, especially with better offerings like the NVIDIA'S RIVA 128 proliferating the market. For about the same money, either Dell or Gateway can deliver a P Il system with AGP, and because both use the RIVA 128 chip, Direct3D performance will also be better. For a first outing in the gaming space, Packard Bell has delivered a decent system, but until some of its kinks are smoothed out, we would recommend taking a pass on this one. -DS Packard Bell Platinum 3000 Price: $2,398 (888) 474-6772 www.packardbell.com/ Packard Bell PROS: Easy installation; embedded headphone/microphone jacks in monitor.

It did find the USB joystick and installed its driver without incident. Presario's numbers are not surprisingly, not impressive. The unit was able to run 3D WinBench 97 in software emulation owing to its lack of 3D hardware. Its WinBench 97 Business Graphic WinMark scores were just about the slowest of the lot, as was its Business Disk WinMark score. About the only favorable bump for Compaq came in CD-ROM WinMark, CPU16, and CPU32 tests, where it was competitive with other Socket 7 systems.

"ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE Long Story Short What's Cool/ What Sucks What Sucks: Sculpted Cases To paraphrase Indiana Jones, \"Why'd it have to be a sculpted case?\" Take a standard case and leave it in the sun for a while to round the edges (you need to have that hot rod rig streamlined, right?). Guess what: Adding compo nents that are exposed in the front panel becomes a royal pain. If you want it to look good, you need to buy it from the same vendor-if it's available. Imagine the phone call: «T'd like the new Plextor 30x CD-ROM drive to fit in your drive bay.\" Sales rep: \"Huh?\" f the nine boxes we looked at this month, your best choice boils down to three, and among those three, it comes down to polish versus power. Dell and Gateway both delivered P-II AGP systems powered by RIVA 128 graphics accelerators, and they turned in very solid numbers for $2,500 systems. Both boxes, however, leave it to you to \"tighten the last few screws\": installing real-mode drivers, getting a game controller, getting the latest rev of DirectX. Falcon Northwest, on the other hand, delivered a 233MHz Pentium with MMX PCI-based system with a PCI RIVA 128 board and 3Dfx's Voodoo graphics chipset to boot. And because gaming rigs are Falcon's bread and butter, it sweats the details to make this version of the Mach V ready to roll. The difference in performance between the Falcon and the two P-MAGP systems bear out the Pill's superiority, however the Falcon includes the 3Dfx Voodoo graphics that will run all 3Dfx/Glide titles. The Dell and Gateway units are pretty much Direct3D-only boxes until a GL miniport driver to run GL QUAKE becomes available later this year from NVIDIA. Over time, how. ever, both the Falcon's Pentium MMX CPU and the PCI bus will run out of gas before the PIAGP systems do, making major component swaps necessary sooner. If you're leaning toward out-and-out performance, consider the P-IMAGP boxes, but if you're a serious Quake-head, or want to run 3Dfx or OpenGL titles, then we'd give the nod to Falcon. As for the other six systems we evaluated, each either had serious trouble running our test applications or had some glaringly weak performance component that kept them out of con sideration. Compaq forgot about 3D graphics altogether, whereas Micron shot behind the duck in opting for S3's unim pressive ViRGE 2D/3D accelerator. Solid Computer arrived with too many rough edges despite good base components. HP, IBM, and Packard Bell were dogged by driver issues and sub. standard performance. To be fair, it gets harder to produce a killer system as you lower the price point bar. But we found three systems that will serve you well in your gaming exploits, none of which requires a Las Vegas jackpot to cover the bill. Of course, system prices are always a moving target, and by the time you read this, the systems featured here may have new (and it's hoped, upgraded) components for about the same amount of money. Check with each vendor to see what kind of system you can have built for your hard-earned $2,500. Uneasy Access Opening cases should be as easy as opening the hood on a car. In some cases (Falcon Northwest), the tool-free case is a snap to open and close-we're all for that. Outcome the thumbscrews, off comes the side panel. In the Dell and Micron systems, opening the case requires either another person or the growth of a third hand. Then there's the IBM case, which doesn't have any screws, but does require an advanced degree in jigsaw puzzles to put back together. Finally there's the Packard Bell, which requires you to remove two screws from the bottom (that's right, the part that sits on the floor) to open the case. Mezzanine Buses Opening up the Compaq presents you with a high tech version of a Rubik's cube. First, the cards are mounted in a different direction than in most tower cases. Secondly, getting to them is a challenge. While it's nice to have a welfare program for unemployed mechanical engineers, this is ridiculous. What's Cool More Zip The Micron and Compaq systems come with a built-in Zip drive. You get 100MB of removable storage, perfect for storing those pesky patches and driver updates for that inevitable day when you have to reinstall Windows 95-not to mention backing up all those save game files. Color-Coded Cables Inside the HP system are so many cables that it looks like two squids mating. Luckily, all cables and receptacles are color-coded. It makes setup much easier.

"2D/3D COMBO CARDS Jazz Adrenaline Rush 3D azz Multimedia's Adrenaline Rush 3D continues Jazz's tradition of shipping low-cost graphics hardware.

Like other Voodoo Rush boards, its 2D Windows perfor mance is probably its weakest link, but if you're not running heavy Windows business applications, it's not that important Recently, there's been a lot of ink about the 3D performance of the Voodoo Rush chipset. Voodoo Rush has some problems with applications that use simultaneous alpha blending and z-buffering. It so happens that GL QUAKE uses-you guessed il-simultaneous alpha blending (for lighting effects) and z buffer. i ng. The engineers at 3Dfx are aware of the problem. We saw beta drivers that significantly improved GL QUAKE's frame rate, though at press time they had not yet shipped. The Jazz Adrenaline Rush scores lower across the board than the Intergraph Intense 3D Voodoo we tested in November. Of course, it's also less expensive, so that's a consideration. The software bundle is nice, too, with 3Dfx-enhanced versions of INTERSTATE '76, MECHWARRIOR: MERCENARIES, and TUROK: DINOSAUR HUNTER. But for a few dollars more, you can do better.

"ELSA Victory Erazor ATI Xpert @ Play ELSA VICTORI A XPERT@Play ot to be left out, ELSA has jumped on the RIVA 128 bandwagon. Unlike most vendors (save for Canopus), ELSA has put its own spin on this hot chip du jour. Like the Canopus Total3D 128V, the Victory Erazor supports video capture, not just TV out. One nice feature of the video setup is the breakout cable. Rather than having a plethora of connectors right on the card, ELSA supplies a breakout cable that attaches to the card; the other end of the cable has the video input and output connectors (both composite and S-Video are supported). The performance is what you'd expect from a RIVA card. There's still some visible cracking at the texture seams, but 3D WinBench reported that fog table is supported, which indicates that the Erazor (who thinks up these names?) has drivers based on the latest build from NVIDIA. However, ELSA has undoubtedly tweaked the drivers a bit. The Erazor's 2D WinBench scores were slightly better than those of the Canopus or ASUS cards. While its 3D WinBench number was Price: $179 (4MB, MSRP). about the same, its FLIGHT SIMULATOR $155 (4MB, estimated street price) 98 frame rate was a bit higher. Contact: ELSA.

Since then, it has continued to tweak its drivers. The shipping version of the Xpert@Play we tested performed pretty well. The beta drivers we saw in October posted around 70 on 3D WinBench; the current, shipping drivers are scoring just shy of 92. However, we got hold of some beta drivers that boosted the 3D WinBench score to a sizzling 121. putting it within shouting distance of 3Dfx. After the shortcomings of the Rage I and II, ATI has redeemed itself with the Rage Pro. Alas, all is not yet perfect. We saw some annoying texture defects in FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98, particularly in dense scenery. Flying over Paris, we noticed the terrain textures flickering on and off. ATI is aware of the problem and is looking into it. The 2D performance is respectable, and the SVGA-graphics performance is a definite improvement over the Rage II. The only oddity was the unusually low score for DUKE NUKEM 3D. ATI's performance with digital video play back is stellar, and the company has recently begun shipping the All-in-Wonder Pro, which couples the Rage Pro with a TV tuner.

"PERFORMANCE TESTS How We Tested e used the same test-bed for the PCI cards that we used in our November reviews: a 200MHz Pentium with MMX technology in an ASUS TX97-XE motherboard and 32MB of SDRAM. For the AGP reviews, we used an ASUS P2L97 motherboard with 64MB of SDRAM, running a Pentium II at 266MHz. (This is the same board that Falcon Northwest uses in its AGP rigs.)

Whereas Canopus has delivered extra features for extra cost, ASUS uses its manufacturing prowess to bring to market the least expensive RIVA 128 board yet. Perhaps in keeping with its price tag, it is a stripped down board in terms of software. There's no software bundle and no fancy control panel. It's just an incredibly fast 2D/3D board, as we've come to expect from the new NVIDIA part. But ASUS' relative newness to the graphics card scene could be a serious concern.

One note about AGP graphics cards: You will have problems finding one on your retailer's shelves. Currently, most AGP graphics cards are going right into systems from big vendors and mail-order companies.

The Xpert@Play's AGP texturing mode doesn't work consistently, even on a properly configured system (you need OSR 2.1 with the USB supplement installed and a new version of VGARTD.VXD). Using 3D WinBench 97's large texture scene, we saw frame rates on a 4MB board increase from roughly 1.6fps (for the PCI board) to 20fps. However, sometimes it just didn't work-and we still saw 1.6fps on the AGP board at times.

MATRI sub nusis MAGIX he very existence of the m3D amounts to acknowledgment from Matrox that its Mystique line of 3D accelerators is fea. ture poor relative to the competition and getting somewhat creaky on the performance front as well. Matrox has applied a bit of driver-writing talent to NEC's PowerVR chip to eke out a bit more performance than the Videologic version we reviewed last time around. Still, it generated the lowest 3D WinBench score in the roundup. This is indicative of the mixed performance we've seen with the PowerVR in Direct3D. The Direct3D games we tested ran relatively slowly luake on the m3D, at least com pared to the competition. When you move away from Direct3D, though, the Matrox add-on begins to show some spunk. While the Direct3D version of WIPEOUT XL managed to pull only 20fps, the PowerVR-enhanced version chugged along at 25fps. The custom GL QUAKE driver got around 28fps, but the PowerVR's image quality wasn't quite as good as that of the 3Dfx. Matrox has simplified the control panel: You can turn the D3D HAL either on or off-that's it. This enables the m3D to coexist with other 3D accelerators as needed. Installation is quite easy: You don't need a pass-through cable, just a free PCI slot and the installation CD. The real kicker is the m3D's price: $99.

The 100SB is basically two complete 3Dfx boards on one PCI board with a PCI bridge chip connecting them. It's the single-board equivalent of the dual-board setup we first saw in Falcon Northwest's high-end rig. At testing time, the drivers were still unstable. For example, the board couldn't run 3D WinBench 97. possibly due to how it combines the dual texel processors. There are two texel processors, each with 4MB of dedicated texture memory. However, there's effectively only 4MB of texture memory since each individual 3Dfx chipset renders every other scan line. This allows the board to have an incredible fill rate of around 75 megapixels per second. Take GL QUAKE, for example. Imagine GL QUAKE at 65fps. Egads. Then, there's TERRAMARK, in which we saw frame rates no less than 70fps and as high as 136fps (100fps at the start of the scene). WIPEOUT XL clocked in at 84fps. Did we say this was fast? The 100SB is a big board-an honest-to-God full-size board, which we haven't seen in an eon (measured in computer time). Whether you get one or Price: $795 Contact: Quantum 3D, not is up to you, but if you do, it will require some (408)919-9999; www.quantum3d.com care and feeding. But then, so does a racehorse.

IT'S A WRAP iven the boards we reviewed in November and this crop of cards, the choices are tough. If we focus just on this month's set of boards, there are some clear standouts. The Canopus Pure3D is a hands-down winner, offering 3Dfx image quality and speed at a great price. The Permedia 2 boards proved interesting, but ultimately didn't seem really well suited for gaming. The Voodoo Rush boards work pretty well, but their 2D performance is far behind the others. Of the 2D/3D combo boards, our pick is the Thriller 3D from Hercules. Its image quality seems a bit better than that from the RIVA gang, and you can get it in an 8MB version. The extra time Hercules has taken to polish the board has paid off. Of the RIVA 128 boards, the ELSA is probably your best value, while the Canopus offers slightly superior video capture (if that's your thing). ELSA has a good record of developing robust drivers and supporting its products. Of the AGP crowd, the STB Velocity 128 stands out; newer boards will probably have a more recent BIOS, but the effort STB has put into its drivers definitely shows. The ATI card strikes us as quite interesting, and once the driver situation stabilizes, it could also be a compelling choice. The Diamond does offer a flash BIOS, but Diamond hasn't quite matched STB's pace on releasing new drivers. Our nod on the AGP front goes to STB-for now. Finally, the matched pair of ASUS boards, combining fast RIVA 128 performance with low prices, are interesting choices, but their relative lack of polish and support gives us reason to pause. If you want the Ferrari of 3Dfx accelerators, there's always the Obsidian 100SB. It's priced accordingly, and will require some patience. Just remember that a year from now, there will be something faster and cheaper. Count on him to always crack under pressure.

"HARDWARE Processor Wars Faster Storage MD, Cyrix, and Intel unveiled plans at the recent Microprocessor forum that could dramatically affect the PC market in the coming years. AMD and Cyrix are developing new processors to increase floatingpoint performancean arca where Intel has long dominated. AMD's upcoming K6 3D and K6+ 3D chips will add 24 instructions that, like MMX instructions, will use the CPUs floating-point registers to help accelerate the CPU portion of the 3D pipeline. But unless games are written specifically to take advantage of these new instructions, the benefit may not be that great The K6+ 3D will have an onboard 256KB Level 2 cache that will rm at the processor's core speed In addition to speeding up access to the 1.2 cache, having it onboard takes that traffic off the main memory bus, allowing other tasks to execute faster. K6 3D is due in the first half of 1998, and K6+ 3D is due in the latter half of the year. AMDs other announcement was for ils Super 7 CPU socket to help further boost performance of their CPUs. This new sockets main highlight is that it boosts main memorys bus speed to 100MHz. For its part, Cyrix is working a new CPU based on its current 6x86MX architecture, code-named Cayenne. Like AMD, Cyrix has implemented its own unique instructions, dubbed MMXFP. And while these new instructions will help accelerate 3D graphics, the benefit to gamers may not be appreciable unless the game is written to use those new instructions. Unlike AMD however, Cayenne will feature a dual-issue, pipelined floating-point unit that should also improve floating-point performance, and is slated for a late 1998 arrival. AMD made other news with some initial information about its next-generation K7 processor. Intel, despite Federal Trade Commission inquiries into antitrust practices, has opted not to license ils Slot! CPU bus interface to other x86 CPU makers. The move has left these other players-AMD, Cyrix, IDT/Centaur -to seek out their own higher-performing CPU interfaces. AMD seems to be going it alone in licensing Digital's new 21264 CPU interface for its K7 processor. MeanIntel will not license its while, all the non-Intel Slot 1 CPU bus interface x86 CPU makers are in to other CPU makers discussions about a single standard for a Slot I altemative for their nextgeneration processors. This new design coull very well splinter the motherboard market, perhaps creati ng more problems than it solves. Intel also made a splash in unveiling details about its IA-64 architecture being codeveloped with Hewlett-Packard. It will implement a new technology termed EPIC (explicitly parallel instruction computing). The first CPU, Merced, is slated to ship sometime in 1999.-Dave Salvator or those of you who still aren't satisfied with your 24x CD-ROM drives, performance CD-ROM specialist Plextor is prepping its UltraPlex CD-ROM drive. The UltraPlex is a CAV (constant angular velocity) drive that runs at a minimum 14x and maximum 32x speed. It's also the first CD-ROM drive to support Ultra SCSI speeds-up to 20MB/sec burst data transfer. With an average access time of 85 milliseconds, the UltraPlex's specs make it nearly as fast as hard drives of only a few years ago. In a new twist, Plextor will be offering a caddy model alongside a tray model. Customers had demanded the return of the caddy after Plextor dropped it in its 12/20Plex. Plextor is also shipping the PlexWriter CD-Recordable drive, which can burn CDs at 4x speeds. Unlike most CD recordables, this drive can act as a 12x CD-ROM reader as well. Plextor is shipping the drive with a one-button backup tool that will even create a bootable CDROM. Look for the UltraPlex to be around $225 on the street and the PlexWriter to come in under $500. Until now, most computer users could only eye high-performance, 7200RPM drives with envy. Hard drives that spin faster than 5400RPM have long been expensive and available only to those with SCSI interfaces in their PCs. Hard-drive giant Seagate recently announced a pair of 7200RPM Ultra ATA (a.k.a. UltraDMA/33) hard drives: a 9.1GB model and a 6.4GB drive. Rounding out the mass-storage news is Tomega's announcement of the Jaz 2. Building on its successful Jaz 1GB removable hard-drive technology, Jaz 2 boosts capacity to 2GB and performance to over 7GB per second over the SCSI bus. The list price will be around $650 for the external version. ---Loyd Case ACRONYM O' THE MONTH BEDO Burst EDO: a type of EDO (Extended Data Out) RAM that's been advertised by motherboard makers.

"LOYD CASE HARDWARE TO >>Continued from pg 195 including the ability to remove or reinstall DirectX at will. It seems that the computer business, as it explores the \"consumer» market, is going through a rather odd thought process. You see it on off-the-shelf systems, which have all manner of resource-sucking friendly shells over Windows 95. You see it in the attitude of the developer who informed me that users could get into trouble with the DirectX 5.0 control panel. The computer companies, in collusion with the boys in Redmond, have decreed that computers should be as casy to use as toasters. Get real. Computers are not toasters. However, there is a device that's analogous. Almost everyone in America has one, and it costs a bundle --many years income for some people. It takes several weeks just to learn the basics and years to master. Some people never get it right. Some people become so fascinated with them, they delve into the innards and share their nerdy discoveries with anyone within earshot. It's called the automobile. There was a trend 15 or so years ago to \"dumb down\" the manuals you got with a new car. About the only thing the car manual would tell you was how to tum it on. Car dashboards were similarly cumbed down, too, with idiot lights replacing more informative gauges. I mcan, geez, all that oil pressure and temperature stuff was too confusing for most people. The manuals, well...my goodness, who would want to change their own oil, anyway? The drivers (users) certainly didn't appreciate this cearth of information. Some new car manuals actually discuss oil changes, and a rare couple actually discuss changing items such as air filters and spark plugs Microsoft and the hardware manufacturers need to take a cue from the car companies, who learned through bitter lessons that people want more information and control, not less. Most people will never take advantage of it (just as many will never actually look at an oil pressure guage or even check their own oil level). But it's certainly comforting to delete the joystick control panel and joyknow it's there. Can you get into trouble? stick driver. vjoyd.vxd and joy.cpl.

It doesn't want to do this because it would be a support headache... as if Microsoft really supported DirectX users. Alternatively, the company could release it to the graphics card manufacturers, who would probably be willing to absorb a lot of those support headaches. Or release it to some other third party, along with source code.  Microsoft could allow developers to release OpenCL MCDs for Windows 95. Yep, it would be slower than a native mini-CL or even a full OpenGL ICD, but it would at least let me use whatever damned card I want.  Silicon Graphics, the original inventors of OpenGL, could aggressively (please note that word) support OpenGL ICD and MCD hardware driver development under Windows 95. It would certainly make for a nice marketing coup As it stands, the hardware guys have to do cither their own mini-CL port (à la 3Dfx or PowerVR) or a full ICD (installable client driver) à la NVIDIAS RIVA 128 (which is a time-consuming process).

"***** REVIEW THRUSTMASTER RAGE 3D GAMEPAD HARDWARE A Gamepad for Grown-Ups innovative design twist on the conventional gamepad, and bundleware includes EA MOTO RACER, and POWERPLAY'98. The larger size makes for less fatigue after prolonged usage, and for gamers with large paws, this is one to check out by Dave Salvator incling the right gamepad is a difficult proposition. The 'Thrust Master Rage 3D gamepad is nolable not only for its larger size (to accommodate adult hands), but also for its lizard-eye\" thumb dish, which has two settings: one with a more relaxed throw allowing for more subtle\"3D\" control, and a 2D setting, in which the throw is greatly reduced to allow for much quicker movements. Installation is a breeze. Plug the unit into your joystick port and feed the driver CD-ROM, and the unit is good to go. Rage 3D features Thrust Masters proprietary DirectConnect technology, which allows multiple ThrustMaster controllers to be simultaneously connected, and you can then pick and choose which controller(s) will be active. The downside is that DirectConnect works only with Thrust Master digital controllers. \"ThrustMapper, Rage 3D's programming front-end, is pretty straightforward to use. If you have several Rage 3Ds daisy-chained together, mapping will then apply to all of them. The units overall feel is pretty good, though I found myself leaving it almost exclusively in the more responsive 2D modelo get quick enough response.

"NASCAR PRO RACING WHEEL REVIEW *** * Did Someone Say «NASCAR»? HARDWARE by Greg Fortune hrustMaster, no stranger to the driving controller market, has got a new offering to serve up in its NASCAR Pro Racing Wheel. The ThrustMaster software installs easily under Windows 95 and provides support for multiple game controllers. You can easily calibrate the unit through the Thrust Master Panel, which configures the Windows 95 jovstick control panel for you. The wheel holds its calibration fairly well, and needs calibration only at the beginning of each session. The setup features a shift lever, a twobutton wheel, and gas and brake pedals. The pedals support combined and separate modes, which determine whether or not the two pedals are mapped as halves of the same joystick axis; some games prefer one over the other. The biggest annoyance here is that to change the pedal mode, you have to power down your computer, make the change, and then restart. The layout of the controls works well, but the wheel feels a bit small and the buttons could have been placed slightly farther out on the spokes. The pedal positions are also awkwarc, extending almost vertically from the base, and can be uncomfortable and cumbersome to use if you don't have much leg room under your desk. One final note: This setup worked flawlessly with every game I used for testing. except one. Yes, the NASCAR Pro Racing Weel doesn't always want to be recognized by...get this... NASCAR RACING 2. eventually got it working, but I almost dubbed it the \"NASCAR No Racing Wheel.\" I expect a lot from ThrustMaster gear, but sadly, this wheel doesn't quite make the grade. It's a good system, but several shortcomings keep it from being great. It will serve you pretty well, but be aware of its rough edges before you buy one APPEAL: Those who just have to have ThrustMaster. PROS: Solid design; holds calibration well; everything's included. CONS: Size and layout not optimal; that NASCAR irony. RATED **** Price: $179.95 Vendor: ThrustMaster (503) 615-3200 www.thrustmaster.com Reader Service #: 317 NETGEAR NETWORK STARTER KIT REVIEW ***** One-Stop Network Shop by Loyd Case HARDWARE ost strategy and simulation games these days have built-in multiplayer capability. While playing with anonymous strangers on the Internet has its charms, there's nothing quite like fragging your best friends in an up-closeand-personal way. If you have a second computer, or want to get together with friends for some network gaming, then the NetGear Network Starter Kit may be right for you. The starter kit is a complete\"network in a box» solution, and is pretty representative of a number of similar products out there. NetGears starter kit comes complete with a pair of PCI Fast Ethernet cards (capable of either 10Mbps or 100Mbps); a 4-port, 10Base-T hub (10Mbps); two 25, Category 5, twistedpair cables; a floppy with drivers; and documentation The manuals are a bit sparse, but are relatively complete. Installing the 2 PCI cards is straightforward, but you do need to read the manuals. NetGear's PCI cards use an Ethernet chip made by DEC; Windows 95 recognizes the chip and would install the drivers for said chip-but NetGear's docs specifically say not to let Windows 95 install the drivers. Windows 95, being the ornery creature it is, did list a DEC chip network card in the Device Manager, which I had to delete. Once past that little hurdle, both cards worked quite well. The four-port hub is very compact, not much larger than a paperback book. The supplied twisted-pair cables had sturdy connectors at each end and were reasonably flexible (some Category 3 cables can be very stiff and hard to manage). Once Windows 95 networking was configured, gameplay proceeded without any apparent performance problems. The floppy disk also included DOS IPXODI drivers (including LSL for out-of-the box IPX support), Windows NT, Windows 3.11, and Netware drivers. \"The NetGear Network Starter kit is a solid value and is perfect for the gamer interested in network gaming. APPEAL: Anyone interested in trying network gaming with a minimum of fuss. PROS: Everything you need for a LAN in one box. >CONS: Setup is a little tricky; sparse documentation.

"**** REVIEW  SAITEK PC-DASH HARDWARE Dash Away MFD Blues 2000 0000! by Loyd Case n modern combat airframes, one thing thats used to simplify the plethora of controls is a panel of buttons that usually lies close to-or in some cases surBrounds--the multifunction displays (MFD). I've always yearned for a setup like this, but didn't want to go to the length of building a virtual cockpit in my basement And then along comes Saitek, with its PC-Dash. Using the same technology featured in the chess boards in the company's stand-alone chess computers, the PCDash is a fully programmable device that plugs into your keyboard port with a passthrough cable. There are 35 touch-sensitive hotspots and three \"shift\" toggles. You can have more than 180 controls in all. There's also a gamepad-like 8-way control and two Price: $79 buttons that can be set up as fire buttons. Vendor: Saitek (310) 212-5412 The programming tool is a straightforwww.saitek.com | ward, Windows-95 application. While its Reader Service #: 319 relatively easy to use, some of the controls are not entirely intuitive. For example, when you enter keystrokes, the PC-Dash defaults into an automatic mode that makes it impossible to backspace or correct an error. There's a manual entry mode, but that switch is buried in a submenu. You can assign each hot-spot multiple kcy-presses, as well as Control and Alt combinations. You can download programs, as well. One cool feature of the PC-Dash is the ability to print out your own control sheets in color, if you've a color printer. The PC-Dash also has a built-in barcode reader, which allows you to program the controller without downloading the whole program. Every control shieet you print includes a bar code to ease reprogramming. Saitek will make additional setups and printable images available for free on its Web site. Other than the somewhat awkward user interface on the programming tool. there are few downsides. It does take up a healthy chunk of desk space. There are tilt-up feet that let the PC-Dash sit at an angle, but they don't have rubber suckcrs. Still, the ability to have a complete control setup-labeled, no less is pretty appealing & APPEAL: Any gamer looking to simplify complex control setups. PROS: Flexible, programmable device; nice programming tool. CONS: You have to program it; desk IRATED  GLABS hog.

"HEXEN II  REVIEW ACTION 01997 SegaSoft Networks. Inc. Viglance. HEAT.NET, and the HEAT logo are trademarks of SegaSoft Networks, Inc. Al rights reserved. 058) OSE GHOST IN THE HOOD The monsters and weapons in Hexen I are interesting, but both are in short supply. WHAT'S THE HUB, BUB? Like its predecessors, HEXEN II is divided into hubs-groups of interrelated levels that the gamer must traverse in a nonlinear fashion.HEXEN II has five hubs, each with its own theme. There's a medieval village, a Meso-American temple, Egyptian ruins, a CrecoRoman environment, and a gothic cathedral. The first four hubs end in a confrontation with one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (famine, death, pestilence, and war), and the final hub ends in a confrontation with the Serpent Ridler Eidolon. The theory behind hub design is that it will help remove the linear key hunt that composes the single-player portion of most first-person action games. Players must go back and forth between levels, hunting for objects and opening passages that grant access to new areas. Multi-Role-Play fter QUAKE's release, many people were protesting its uninspired single-player component. The game was geared for the multiplayer experience from the beginning, and it showed. HEXEN II falls into the opposite trap. The single-player game was obviously the focus, and the multiplayer options seem like an afterthought. HEXEN Il offers the basic options, including 2-16 player deathmatches and cooperative play over the Internet or on a localarea network. Unfortunately, there are no modem or direct connect options. The five multiplayer maps are decent for deathmatching, but the majority of the game's single player maps aren't suited for all-out fragfests. The distinct elements of Hexen I have varied effects on deathmatches. The idea of character classes and experience points make things a little more interesting-players become more powerful as the match wears on. Those on the bottom of the heap also get more experience for taking out advanced players. Unfortunately, the power-ups that help add diversity to the single-player game have an adverse effect on the balance in multiplayer. The game basically deteriorates into a race for the more powerful items, and those with a good supply of Glyphs of the Ancients, Stones of Summoning, or Force Cubes will usually emerge victorious against even the most powerful adversary.

Probably because, in spite of all its efforts, TNP comes up short as a shooter, delivering mildly enjoyable yet unengaging play. TNP makes a lot of noise about the freedom of its «nonlinear\" territories. which discard the traditional concept of sequential levels, but the claim is misleading. True, many of the environments can be explored in any particular order, but completing them is another matter you'll need passcodes from some levels to finish others, and some areas won't open until others are completed.

"*** REVIEW RIVEN DIFFICULTY LEVEL ADVENTURE/RPG LMyst Again With its Familiar, Lever-yanking Gameplay, RIVEN Emerges as the Ultimate Myst Clone by Robert Coffey ou don't mess with success, you don't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, and if you're Cyan Productions, you don't screw with the best-selling adventure game of all time when you design the sequel. RIVEN is basically MYST all over again -only more so. All the trademarks of the earlier game are there: the unbelievably beautiful images, the evocative sound effects, and the strange and wonderful worlds, along with the same button-pushing, lever-cranking puzzles in the same sterile, noninteraclive, slide show environments. The legions of Myst fans will love it while the legions of Myst focs might find the five discs ideal for skeet. ONE-WAY TICKET TO PARADISE If anything, RIVEN supplies even less plot than the first game. At that games end, Myst veterans will recall, the writer Atrus was concerned about the welfare of his missing wife, Catherine. As RIVEN starts, Atrus gives you one of his famous linking books so that you can travel to Riven to find his spouse. Unlike the others, This book is strictly one-way, stranding you in the lush archipelago of Riven until you find Catherine and send word that you're ready to return. Unlike Channelwood and the other ages from Myst, RIVEN has native fauna and people as well as an actual enemy, Gehn. Unfortunately, all this plot is merely back-story: Once the game proper begins, storytelling gets thrown out the window-rather odd for a game that features a godlike writer as its central character. It should be no surprise that Riven is the most gorgeous game you're likely ever to see. Somehow Cyan has found a way to improve Mysr's legendary graphics, with each screen besting the one before it in use of light, color, and simple beauty. The exquisitely rendered textures of veined rock and rough metal are so beyond real, you can practically feel them through your monitor. The result is a game world of eye-popping splendor. The game handles sound and music with similar finesse. Evocative noises ranging from thunderous volcanic rumblings to subtle beetle buzzes add to the sense of wonder that RIVEN creates. As in the original, sounds provide clues as well as ambience. RIVEN WE GOT YOUR INTERACTIVITY In a nod to increased interactivity, Riven includes this hangman type minigame. Playing the game won't help you progress, but it provides valuable clues.

"RIVEN  REVIEW ADVENTURE/RPG opted against taking any risks in expanding the game world from the first game. Where you'll stand on Rivens gameplay boils down to how much you liked Mysis. As in the first game, puzzles here have no real connection to the story and focus greatly on getting various machines up and running. Faced with my first stcam valve, I found myself thinking, \"Here we go again.\" Playing RIVEN is a lot like being dropped into a big shoe factory. There's a big shoe-making machine missing a few parts and an instruction manual in a foreign language. Sure, getting the machine to work is a challenge, but do you really care? RIVEN's lack of a compelling story leaves you feeling more like a mechanic than a gamer as you run MYST-ERY TRAIN Mine carts and trams like this take the place of around the islands sunting steam and pressing buttons.

The D'ni slam doors in your face, run away from you, sound MYST-Conceptions: alarms and then run away from you, and even leave without a word when you rescue one from a prison. But as a vital part of the game, they are a virtual nonfactor. ame reviewers such as myself are often accused of having some sort of ven The tone is pretty well established when detta against Myst. Invariably someone asks, \"If Myst sucks so much, why has the one guy who seems to want to talk to lit sold millions of copies?\" Well, if public acclamation alone denoted worth, Dirty you is killed at the beginning of the game. Dancing would be great cinema and Citizen Kane wouldn't even make it to public Ultimately, Cyan plays it safe with access cable. So why is Myst every game reviewer's whipping boy? RIVEN. Fans of Myst will no doubt revel in As a game, Myst is okay. But as a wildly successful game, Myst has wreaked the incredible graphics, great sound, and havoc on adventure gaming. The gaming industry is a lot like Hollywood, churning out the rich extension of the original game copies of whatever does great box office. Piranha followed Jaws, Ice Pirates followed world. 'Those less in awe of MysT will find Star Wars, and so on. What these pale imitations failed to understand was that the little improvement: RIVEN falls back on the models they were striving to equal succeeded because they were original, not because same old gameplay, the same old lack of they had killer fish or star fighters.

And now there is F-16, a product so derivative that you have to wonder if the developers simply ran out of ideas. Not only is it an F-16 Fighting Falcon sim-something of a cliché in itself-but despite the new plane and a few incremental improvements, its gameplay options, graphics, and battlefield environment are almost identical to HIND'S. As with its two immediate predecessors, IF-16 includes an instant-action mode, a sct of 20 training missions, and 10 single missions, plus one campaign in each of three theaters (Israel, Cyprus, and Korea). The campaigns all share a linear structure with 10 stages. Win, and you progress to the next stage.

The designers have dipped into this well one too many times. Though the landscape looks nice enough at maximum detail, with an impressively high visibility limit, it isn't exactly eye-popping compared to other sims. That would be easier to accept if this game rendered terrain at a high frame rate, but it is actually quite jerky on all except the fastest hardware. Reasonably smooth updates are attainable with most Pentiums if you dial back the detail far enough. However, on anything slower than a P5-166, the results will not be pretty. There's no 3D card support, although a Digital Integration support rep said a patch to support 3Dfx cards will be available around January. DOS and Win 95 frame rates are comparable, with the former having a slight edge on some systems. Performance issues aside, the terrain graphics are certainly functional CGW JANUARY 1998 "

"REVIEW.PANZER GENERAL II Alles on the March example, in 1943, most Soviet lanks lack long-range guns. The Germans, outclassed at short range, must play a delicate game of fire and move to hold off their numerically superior enemy. One thus learns why the Allies feared the German 88, particularly carly in the war. he addition of Allied campaigns stands out as one of the highlights of PANZER GENERAL II. As each Allied army comprises different units with dramatically different abilities, each campaign presents different challenges and opportunities. STRATEGY / WARGAMES 070 1: (-010-DP-80 =($)-O 636 The Americans, for instance, benefit from impressive heavy artillery and tactical air power. U.S. tanks are weak, but even they can blast through defenses by using combined arms. Generally, the U.S. campaign (which begins, as does the British, at Salerno) involves repeated races against time, rather than difficult opposition. RECON IS NO LONGER A LUXURY The spotting and visibility rules have also changed, making reconnaissance units absolutely essential. Air units no longer have a huge range of vision and are almost useless in bad weather. Movement of any kind becomes highly dangerous without proper recon, and it's possible to set traps and ambushes for your opponent. Air power in general has been downgraded considerably. The German Stukas are still fearsome when attacking ground units, but on the whole it's no longer possible to steamroll defensive positions with air power alone. Purists will be glad to hear that the distribution of antiaircraft units has been scaled back to more historical proportions, particularly in the early British, French, and Soviet annies. The German fighters are especially weak early in the war, and you will have to work much harder in the Blitzkrieg campaign to attain air supremacy. While some scenarios remain walkovers, many are genuinely difficult, a welcome change from PANZER CENERAL, in which only Norway and France offered a serious challenge. When you play the Germans on the attack, the final two scenarios against the United States can be very intimidating-though I think it's a dirty trick for the designers to give the U.S. access to 1945 equipment while restricting the Germans to 1944 models and less prestige, to boot). This objection aside, the campaign paths are fun, challenging, and diverse. In another change from PG, there's no apparent limit here to the size of your core force. You are greatly limited, however, in the prestige you have available, meaning that you won't have the resources to build your army too quickly. Over time, you must decide between buying new units and upgrading those you already have All this gives force management a more dynamic feel, and you must plan The British come equipped with wimpy aircraft and guns, although upgrades are available. British tanks improve quickly, however, giving them a fighting chance in the slugfests around Caen. Because their tactical bombers are so weak, the British must be more creative and persistent to destroy the Panthers and Tigers that stand between them and victory. The Russians have some great equipment in close, but suffer from a tragically weak air force and a lack of long-range firepower. Speed and multiple attacks in the face of heavy losses will usually carry the day, but as the Russians you must be willing to lose many more units than as any other army. CGW JANUARY 1998 "

"REVIEW  PANZER GENERAL II STRATEGYZ WARGAMES GET IT EVERY MONTH SPEARHEAD AT KURSK An unfortunate Soviet T-34 bites the dust in an overrun attack. TM computer carefully to meet the demands of upcoming battles. With the need for more recon units and the overall weakness of fighters (as the Germans and Soviets), you will have to build and use units that were completely unnecessary in PANZER GENERAL. On my way to world domination as the Germans, I had three mobile antiaircraft units and two recon units in my core as early as the first battle in France, circa 1940. I also made good use of one or two 88 antitank units. GENERAL II move in phases, allowing them to scout and retreat as they would in real life. When one of my infantry units acquired a leader with this skill, it was able to move like a recon unit but was unable to use its motorized transport. Infantry on foot, regardless of their skills, are of minimal use in a blitzkrieg. Also, could they possibly have found wimpier bagpipe music for the British background score? Yuk, As you might expect, these admittedly minor quibbles hardly detract from an otherwise fantastic game. As if the single-player options weren't enough, PANZER GENERAL II comes with a scenario generator and extensive online and email options for two-player games-promising would be Guderians and Pattons endless hours of entertaining and challenging play. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I hear the General Staff calling my name.... Visit our special Web site at YOU VILL FOLLOW MY ORDERS, JA! Unit leaders constitute another interesting addition to the game. Some units start with leaders, while others gain them after winning a particularly difficult engagement. Leaders give units additional special abilities or strengths, many of which significantly improve their combat and movement. PANZER GENERAL II isn't entirely without glitches. On my computer it had a tendency to freeze momentarily during play. It never crashed completely, but it did get stuck for 10 or 15 seconds every now and again. There is also a bug in the Soviet campaign that allows the Russians to build 134/4 is free of charge. Now, I know these tanks were used en masse, but.... At least one leader attribute-reconnaissance movement-can also be a detriment. Recon units in PANZER APPEAL: Fans of the first PG, and anyone who remotely enjoys challenging strategy games.

"AGE OF EMPIRES. REVIEW is a tendency for all players to build up an ultimate army before attack, this population limit can present a frequent problem. Although the delete ability lessens the negative effect of the population limit (Ensemble should have included a dismiss button on the interface, STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Cheating the System 23 though), it still would have been nice if gamers were allowed to tweak the limit in multiplayer setups. It also would have made sense to at least give population bonuses for, say, building additional town centers or advancing to a new age. Aside from the population limit, there are few other problems. ACE should have cmployed the innovations that DARK REICN and TOTAL ANNIHILATION did unit queues and 3D terrain, for example. Also, the walls in AGE are too strong, especially the heavily fortified ones with 800 hit points (your massive Wonder doesn't even have that many).

One annoying Al glitch is that your villagers will tend to get stuck in light spaces. I can forgive these small annoyances, though I really think population limit should have been fixed. However, even with ACE OF EMPIRE'S few problems, the game is great.

Kemper, in the center, is currently selected, and you can see the destination markers for the five regiments in his brigade. 2. Kemper is a competent brigade commander, but that won't be enough to prepare him or his men for this camage. 3. Confederate artillery batteries desperately lay down a torrent of fire in an attempt to cover the Rebel infantry as they advance. 4. The four buttons to the left of the toolbar allow you to change formation easily. Right now, all units of Pickett's Division are in Battle Line. 5.

Notice how the victory point sites are in blue, to show Union control. Their total point value (65) is the equivalent of 6,500 infantry casualties. 7. One of the great things about the real-time engine is that everything doesn't go exactly as planned. There are gaps in the Confederate line, and the troops to the north aren't properly positioned to support the troops in the center. treat matter points to a direction for the whole genre. The graphics and sound alone combine to create a visual treat akin to a movie. The user interface-elegant despite its quirks lets you interact meaningfully, while the degree of difficulty and game speed can be adjusted over a wide range, allowing a broad audience to have fun playing the game. The tutorials make it easy to start playing: you leam as you go from voice-over and small text boxes. You can play six different scenarios in tutorial mode without ever reading the manuals. Sid really understands human nature, doesn't he? continually monitor your troops. You should order them to fall back or retreat before they get routed, or reinforce them if the position they hold is critical. Flanking fire is deadly and learning how to get it or keep your opponent from getting it is very important. After surviving a dozen engagements, you'll read situations like a veteran. This emphasis on the \"feel\" of battle is completely appropriate in a real-time game, particularly since it's very fast. Even with the game speed at the slowest of four sellings, the clock runs 1.5 times normal speed on a P120 system-a one-hour scenario takes 40 minutes of actual playand about twice real-life speed on a P200. This is fast enough to keep you pretty busy in the larger engagements, where you have to give orders to several corps. To give orders, you click on a regiment to select it and a row of buttons along the bottom of the screen lets you change formations, advance, or fall back. Or, you can draga regiment with the mouse and drop it where you want it to move. Selecta Brigade Commander and the orders you give apply to all regiments in his brigade. \"I HAVE LOST THIS FIGHT...\" So, does this mix of flexibility and playability in Sid Meier's version of the Civil War mean that I'll be removing Talon Softs BATTLEGROUND: GETTYSBURG from my hard disk anytime soon? No, I still need it if I want to construct my own\"What if' scenario. There's just no way to do this with SD METER'S GETTYSBURC. Nor is Meier's design perfect; there are a few rough edges with the interface. For example, it's impossible to select an object near the edge of the screen (including the menus at the top) without scrolling the map. Tuming off scrolling completely is a bigger problem; what the game needs is a key that tums off scrolling as long as the key is held down. There are also minor problems with oblique movement (which sometimes reverts to normal movement) and casualties infantry losses are made good the following clay, but dead leaders never get replaced.

"REVIEW. TOTAL ANNIHILATION STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Cavedog has even modified the traditional construction rig to make it more interesting. Instead of the usual trundling and vulnerable derrick we see in so many other real-time games, TA gives some sense of realism and tactical importance to this icon. Your alter ego is actually in the construction rig, and it's not just a building prop but a very powerful robot, built around a matter/energy converter device. This not only gives you a halfway reasonable excuse to build stuff out of raw materials fairly quickly, it also lets you throw yourself into battle using your converter as a powerful disintegration gun. Of course, should the enemy blow you up, it's all over for you.

"REVIEW  7TH LEGION Play Your Cards Right STRATEGYZWARGAMES IDPE THE LUCK OF THE DRAW Battle Cards add a new dimension to real-time gaming. You can reverse your fortunes just by playing a destructive card like this Fist of Doom. on't be so sure that your perfectly planned strategy will work against your nearly down-and-out opponent. MicroProse has taken a cue from popular card games and added Battle Cards, with which a player can really surprise an opponent. You begin with four Cards and you gain another every two pay periods. These Cards add randomness to play. Your enemy can play a Battle Card and change the tide of battle in an instant. Your big bad force might end up Cursed, Confused, and Immolated before it gets anywhere near its objective. Your legions of infantry could be burnt to ash, your tanks could take a thunderous pounding, or your assault robots could go mad and start shooting each other. Suddenly you are out one expensive army with nothing to show for it. In a way, the Cards are a disincentive to massing a single large force, because units grouped together become much likelier targets for area-affecting Cards. If you use smaller groups, you won't be able to sweep a field clear without heavy casualties, but your opponent may exhaust his reserve of Battle Cards while affecting fewer of your units. Or your opponent might choose not to use Battle Cards against such a small force, which will allow you to use your Cards to support your assault. A small attacking force may be Blessed or enter into a killing Psychosis, suddenly mowing down forces twice its size. Yes, you could do the same with a larger force, but if the enemy plays one of his Cards, you may have wasted a beneficial Card as well as your costly army. Take care, though, because dispensing death directly via Battle Cards or simply running over infantry with your tanks doesn't count toward completing your special mission directives. Likewise, despite being an attractive way to reduce attacking forces in a crisis, sneaky tricks such as luring units within range of gun emplacements get you zero bounties. You may find that you've destroyed a dozen units but haven't gotten credit for a single kill toward your mission objective. There's a full deck of fifty-two cards, so be sure you know the difference between Psychosis, Battle Rage, and Chaos. You can bet the enemy does. other's path or run into an obstacle, they stand still or look for a new route, spreading out and straggling. Some never get to the battle. This calls for close management of large forces, which is a bother and another push toward using more small groups of forces. The dangers and benefits of Battle Cards (see sidebar) also drive the pace of battle. Overall, the use of small forces and time-constrained missions causes players to engage often, and with more balanced forces. The result: heavy casualties and bounties all around. While it's true that 7TH LEGION doesn't nearly have the depth of a game such as TOTAL ANNIHILATION, it also doesn't present itself as anything other than a fast-paced, action-oriented realtime game. Although it suffers some Al deficiencies and poorly crafted indoor missions, 7TH LEGION deserves points for its refreshing \"kills for cash\" and Battle Card features. absolutely unredeemably boring. You have only three marines, so unlike in the main portion of the game--you really don't want to engage the enemy unless you absolutely must. The only special Battle Cards you have are medikits to heal those marines. Also, if your units were stupid on the land map, they are tragically so here. It really doesn't serve much purpose to shoot barrels and walls when enemies are in the next room, especially if shooting all day won't put a dent in anything that isn't flesh and bone. Luckily for your intrepid \"elite\" units, the enemy is just as stupid: In some cases, guards won't even notice you mowing down their compatriots if you can place your gunners just far enough away. These infiltration missions could just as well have been left out for a purer strategy game. Luckily, these missions are short and you'll soon be back in the fray. PICK A CARD Unfortunately, some mission scenarios leave the standard game and ask you to lead a small band of «marines\" into an enemy base to capture or destroy something that advances the storyline. These levels are totally different from the rest of the game and are APPEAL: Real-time commanders looking for something light, fun, and a little different. PROS: It's a good, simple, fastpaced real-time game; cool Battle Cards randomize gameplay. CONS: SO-SO storyline; a few throwaway missions; bad AI. CGW JANUARY 1998 "

"INCUBATION  REVIEW *** * 3D Hatchling DIFFICULTY LEVEL X-COM-lite-a New Breed of 3D Wargaming? by Loyd Case STRATEGYZ WARGAMES 3202001 gives you clues as to their position. QUAKE it's not, but it is interesting to see tactical action from a different viewpoint. The combat animations are nicely done, with different motions for different weapons. The voice-overs are effective, though simple. The lead narrator, who plays Bratt, does a nice job of playing the combat-weary veteran, and for once, the writing isn't overly lyperbolic. The cutscenes are all 3D animations and are graphically awful. This is the first game I've played in some time in which the gameplay animation is far superior to the cul-scene graphics. The 3D characters in the cut-scenes look as if they were created with about six polygons (okay, now I'm being hyperbolic). We're talking about square necks and square heads, folks. Still, they do a nice job of moving the story along. Fve Machine Gun WARGAME, YOU SAY? This is the 3D glory of INCUBATION, which is a departure from the traditional, boring-looking tactical combat game. 'm always mystified why huge numbers of real-time strategy games monopolize store shelves while good tum-based combat games have few, if any, imitators Sure, COMMAND & CONQUER spawned a host of imitations, but you'd think that X-COM and JACCED ALLIANCE would have done the same. Along comes German develOper Blue Byte to the rescue with its now Windows 95-based, science-fiction combal game, INCUBATION. It might just have more than its turn-based novelty going for it as it battles for shelf space. Rutherford has been assigned to defend the remaining healthy population while a CUC is developed. The plot thickens as the causes of the mutation are discovered, and the integrity of higher command becomes suspect. It's all classic space opera fare. In the games missions, you carry out Rutherford's orders as Corporal (and later Sergeant) Bratt THE CAMPAIGN The campaign is the main single-player story, with as many as 30 missions. The campaign does branch occasionally, but only to present alternative paths through a linear story. Each battle represents a slightly different tactical challenge, but the variety of mission types is fairly small ---clean out an area, escort a civilian, get to an exit point. You choose battles from a nicely rendered view of the city, with hotspots identifying locations. Alocation may be a culscene, an armory, or the next battle. BIOHAZARD WITH A BITE INCUBATION takes place in Blue Bytes BATILE ISLE strategy games universe. The game's story is smaller and more personal, though, following the adventures of a squad of space marines trying to make sense of a growing phenomenon. Apparently, the inhabitants of the planet Scayla are rapidly mutating into killer aliens (are there any other kind?). A small detachment of marines under Captain I NEED PERSPECTIVE One of the unique features of INCUBATION is its use of true 3D technology. There's even a 3Dfxenhanced version of the game. You not only have the classic isometric view so common in games such as X-COM, but you also can see the view from an individtal squamates perspective.

Although the game is one of many real-time strategy games currently glutting the market, it offers so many original ideas and nifty features that it's hard to decide where to begin. WHAT'S GOOD The back story, featuring alicns conquering the Earth, is familiar, but CONQUEST EARTH gives it a nice tilt by offering you the choice of playing as the Earth's human protectors or as the invading Jovians. Better yet, the difference between CONQUEST EARTH's forces is actually significant. While the humans develop the usual assortment of guns, tanks, and airplanes, the Jovians learn to morph into a variety of forms, from the humanoid Walker to the scorpionlike Glider to the seemingly innocuous rock. CONQUEST EAKIUS 64,000color graphics feature handpainted backdrops, nighttime lighting effects, semi-transparent explosions, and more.

The little things you click to issue orders have an active area that is a whopping 20 pixels tall. Accidentally move past it and the screen scrolls. If you're on a fast machine, it scrolls really fast.

"CONQUEST EARTH  REVIEW good, because when you give orders for a group of units to escort another unit, everyone invariably fires a round or two at him first. Their default mode is to stand still, without returning fire, while they're being gunned down. Troops won't defend themselves unless you specifically tell them to do so. And those defensive orders don't stick; tell troops to do anything else-move or fire, for instance--and they drop back into their default catatonia. I found the direct control of little use. More useful is your ability to manually direct the fire of selected units with the left mouse button. Most early missions can be won by simply selecting a big group and manually moving them around while using their concentrated firepower. But even this simple action is harder to do than it should be. If you manually direct fire to a specific location, selected units will just stop in their tracks and fire in that direction. If they're spread out, it means most of them are out of range. If they're in a clump, they'll shoot each other. Fortunately for you (but unfortunately for realism buffs), troops don't take damage from friendly fire.

"MAN OF WAR  REVIEW ** ** Sea Quake? DIFFICULTY LEVEL P A Third-Person Wargame/First-Person Action Hybrid-With Mixed Results STRATEGYZ WARGAMES by Bob Proctor f you believe things always come in threes, then you aren't surprised by the fact that 1997 has produced three games on sailing ship battles: Avalon Hills WOODEN SHIPS & IRON MEN, Talonsofts ACE OF Sail, and now, Strategy First's MAN OF WAR. As with the others, MAN OF WAR has scenarios for some of the great battles of the Revolutionary and Napolconic wars. What makes MOW different? It is the only game of the three to use a first-person perspective. That is to say, you are right there on deck, with the sea, sky, and other ships all around you. This is a common format for simulations, including every submarine sim ever made, but it's the first attempt to bring the idea to sailing ship warfare. MG RNM m Check out MAN OF WAR on this month's CG-ROM! WHERE'S MY CREW?Though you seem to pilot a ghost ship, the quarterdeck view of this large warship does give a good view of the action. Notice the compass across the bottom and the four-minute timer (with controls to set the clock at 1x, 2x, 4x, or 8x speed). SIM OR STRATEGY GAME? Forget the marketing: MOW is, at heart, a tum-based strategy game. You give orders to all your ships for the next fourminute tum; then the clock starts and you watch as movement and combat occur. At the end of the turn, the clock stops and it's time for orders again. Orders are given using an overhead isometric view of the ships on an ocean that looks like an old parchment map. Only instead of watching the action from this view, you are transported to the deck of your flagship. For me, this attempt at first-person point-of-view falls short. It never gave me the \"you are there\" feeling that the back of the box claims. There are two reasons for this a lack of realism and impotence. Let me explain that last one first. From the gamer's perspective, the \"Action Phase\" is really a time of inaction; you have nothing to do for four minutes except watch. Oh, you can use the arrow keys to move around the deck of your flagship, but there isn't a single order you can give until the four minutes are up. If you're like me, you'll quickly have the clock on 8x (the fastest setting) or be hitting the Skip button to get on to the next orders phasethat's where the real action is. As for the realism aspect, you'll find the deck a lonely, surrealistic place; there isn't another soul on deck! No helmsman, no lookouts, no midshipmen waiting to carry orders below decks where all those cannon go off every few minutes. I think I understand why: It's a huge programming effort to put a crew on deck when they're just a decoration in game terms -you couldn't give them an order if you wanted to. On the other hand, they spent time depicting a dozen or more different weather and lighting conditions and the sea and the sky are beautifull), so why not include some crew members as well? At night, the gun flashes reflect off the sails nicely, although all the ships look the same. That is, there are about six different classes and all the ships of a class look alike, even in regard to color. The largest class is «Ship of the Line,\" so these all appear as three-deckers, even though most are 64s and 74s and should only have two decks. Large Frigates are all two-deckers, even though no Frigate ever had more than one full gun deck. Smoke is one thing MOW gets right. When your broadside fires, a huge cloud of white smoke obscures your vision until it dissipates in the wind. The cannon also boom realistically, with sound attenuated by distance. When a mast goes overboard, there is the sound of splintering wood and snapping cordage. Other than these however, sound is an arca badly neglected why do I never hear the wind or the sails above me? Where is the whistle of cannonballs flying by or the sound of the splashes (which I can see) when they fall short? And why can't I hear the sounds of Price: $49.95 Minimum System Requirements: Pentium 60.

"***** REVIEW  BATTLEGROUND 8: PRELUDE TO WATERLOO DIFFICULTY LEVEL L Ground to a Halt Napoleon's Last Campaign Marks the End of an Era STRATEGYZWARGAMES by Bob Proctor une 16, 1815. France is threat ened by two armies: one British, one Prussian. Napoleon, hoping to defeat each enemy in turn, moves quickly to block the roads that would allow his enemies to join forces. The rapid march of Napoleon's army surprises the allies (whose officers are attending a ball in Brussels). Sensing that Wellington's forces are less than prepared, Napoleon hopes to stall the British at the crossroads of Quatre Bras, while simultaneously smashing the Prussians near the village of Ligny. This bold planwhich came very close to succeeding -is the subject of PRELUDE TO WATERLOO, last of the famed BATILEGROUND Wargame series. effect, infantry that can use horses for greater mobility. In PRELUDE, the cavalry fights from horseback with swords and sabers, so each turn has an addit ional phase -the Cavalry Charge. Cavalry gains pow erful bonuses by charging into a EXTREME ZOOM-OUT Here's a portion of this viewing mode, melee. It's so effec new to PRELUDE. It's useful if you want to see the terrain tive that an infantry approaches to Quatre Bras without units getting in the way. unit of comparable size cannot stand against them unless it serve many uses: as forward scouts, uses a special defensive formation-the guards for your flanks, or harassers of square. The square allows you to shoot in enemy artillery. You can also sacrifice any direction (albeit with reduced fire skirmishers to blunt an infantry assault. power), but its less mobile than either They generally give as many casualties as line or column formation. they take, and every turn the enemy Also, infantry units in PRELUDE can spends fighting skirmishers is another split off groups of 100 men as skirmish turn you can reduce his numbers with ers. Some units can do this once; light ranged fire. And you had better reduce infantry can do it repeatedly. Cavalry him because Disorganization does not likewise can split off squads of 100 riders. keep an infantry unit from melee (unlike T hese small units have no facing (thus the ACW games). they may fire in any direction) and they given these differences, PRELUDE IS more complex, much richer tactically, harder to play well, and therefore more rewarding. Unfortunately, it also means it's harder to program the computer to play well. Once you've mastered the game, you should be able to beat the Al in any scenario playing either side. I guess that means the scenarios are balanced, at least! PRELUDE Waterloo NAPOLEON VS. ROBERT E. LEE PRELUDE, the third BATILECKOUND game covering the Napoleonic Wars, uses a slightly different set of rules than those dealing with the American Civil War. In the ACW games, cavalry can be mounted or dismounted, but they can fire only while dismounted.

"BATTLEGROUND 8: PRELUDE TO WATERLOO REVIEW * Prelude to a Short Scenario STRATEGYZWARGAMES to-head play using the Extreme Fog of War optional rule. Extreme FOW hides the identity and quality of enemy units as well as hiding the data that «normal» FOW hides (exact strength and fatigue). While they might be of little interest to those who want to analyze history, both Extreme FOW and the Art of Warscenarios make head-to-head play much more interesting. Maybe Talonsoft will bless us with Art of Warscenarios for earlier games? Napoleonic games take longer, turn for turn, than the ACW games because there are more choices to be made and because there are lots of units, especially when skirmishers can double the number. Thus, PRELUDE comprises a wonderful variety of long scenarios, but only four (of 23 total) can be played in a single sitting (see the sidebar for details). If, like Wellington, longer battles are your cup of tea, then PRELUDE has a unique feature. Owners of BATILECROUND: WATERLOO can save their results from PRELUDE as the starting setup for a Grand Waterloo campaign game. Nice as this feature is, though, with such extremely long games, I'm disappointed that Talonsoft hasn't improved the user interface by adding player aids. For example, artillery is more accurate after it has acquired a target. However, it can be really hard to remember which target a particular unit shot at in its previous fire phase. Another useful tool would be some way to remember which units need to change formation. A common example is artillery that needs to unlimber. Normally, this can happen only during the Defensive Fire phase, but the \"Next Unit\" tool will find only units that can Interesting parallels exist between this game and BULL Run. Both have enormous maps with terrain well suited for head-to-head play, both include historical coverage of two major battles, and both have a wealth of long scenarios, but only a few short ones. only a few short ones. The two short Quatre Bras scenarios are hypothetical events on the evening before the historical battle The Vanguard is a gem. Half a dozen French regiments try to capture Quatre Bras from a similar number of British units. The French units are all cavalry and the British are all infantry; both sides have two artillery units for support. At a mere eight turns, the scenarlo can be played in an hour and is a great introduction to cavalry tactics. Fifth Corps at Frasnes is a 12 tum scrap in which the French must press the attack against superior numbers. While you can win this scenario versus the Al it's doubtful 24 you'll be so fortunate leading the French against a competent human general. By contrast, the two short scenarios for Ligny are historical. They portray the initial French attacks on two different salients of the battle. Ligny is just 6 turns in length, so you might conceivably hold that town. St. Amant, at 12 turns, is another story, however. A river separates the village from the majority of the Prussian army, and all of the Prussian units across the river are fixed. What's worse, the Prussian units around nearby Ligny are also fixed in place, but the French are not! I sus pect this was just a mistake, but the result VANGUARD The best small scenario pits French cavalry is a very unbalanced against British Infantry at the crossroads village of scenario indeed. Quatre Bras. BE3 BATTLEGROUND series, Talonsoft has fire, which never includes limbered artillery. If you don't remember to do it, you lose two more fire phases before your next chance. wargame design. We can only hope the company's next venture will be as successful.& STRIKE THE COLORS While there are more than a few points about which to quibble, PRELUDE TO WATERLOO still ranks as a very good game. It's historically accurate, challenging (especially in multiplayer scenarios), and still as attractive as a tabletop miniatures game, despite the age of the engine. With this grand finale of the APPEAL: BATTLEGROUND series fans and students of the Napoleonic Wars. PROS: New \"Art of War\" scenarios for head-to-head play; campaign links with BATTLEGROUND: WATERLOO; still the best on its subject. CONS: Only four scenarios can be played at one sitting; no scenario editor; engine and interface starting to show their age. 1990 BATTLE OF LIGNY St. Amant is to the left, Ligny proper to the right. The heavy fighting will be at the bridges across the stream behind the two villages. JANUARY 1998 CGW "

Wilson UCCANEER gives a bad name to more than one type of port. A conversion of SSI's adventure/strategy game, originally designed for PlayStation, it is to SID MEIER'S PIRATES! and Impressions' Hich SEAS TRADER what former Vice President Dan Quayle was to John F. Kennedy. To wit:\"I know PIRATES! and BUCCANEER is no PIRATES!\" BUCCANEER starts out as a good idea. In addition to tactical real-time combat with 3D ships and shifting wind direction, it has better graphics than either PIRATES! or HIGH SEAS TRADER and music that exceeds all but the Amiga version of PIRATES! BUCCANEER also gets kudos for having multiple campaignscach with its own unique objective. Do you take to the high seas to rescue your lost love, avenge your late brother, clear the family name, save your brother, restore your fortune after a betrayal, or find a particular treasure? There are twists in some of the campaigns, but the game mechanics are the same, whatever you decide. The limited, almost skeletal, narrative unfolds with slight differences and victory screens each time, but anyone who bothers to listen to the voice\"OH, I COMMAND A STURDY BAND OF PIRATES BOLD AND FREE.

Want to name your ship? It's not an option. Since the PlayStation has no keyboard, the port doesn't need one either. Want to add a little swash to your buckle as you slide your rapier deftly through your opponents viscera? You don't control the fencing or shooting during the tactical combat. It is a mere animated portrayal of the programs calculations, while you watch as an innocent bystander. Your one valid interaction is to retreat Amazingly enough, though the ship-toship combat offers real-time action, the man-to-man combat doesn't Even the smallest matters bear a negative legacy from the PlayStation interface. Want to restock your ship with food and water? You'll have to click on the cursor for every unit (one for each day you expect to be at sea). Want to replace the cannonballs you used in the last battle? You'll have to click for each and everyone. If you just spent 200 taking down a fortress, you'll have to click 200 times.

"REVIEW . BUCCANEER send a prize party over to take that ship you've just defeated? You can do it, but you'll lose the ship you already had. Imagine my chagrin when I captured a heavily laden Dutch Flute in my first campaign and subsequently discovered that I had left behind my fast, maneuverable sloop forever. PIRATES! allowed you to take that prize to the next port, unless you were defeated by another ship en route. BUCCANEER expects you to scuttle either your current ship or the valuable prize at sea. STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Wa:0:n Also, while the tactical combat at sea is the best part of the game, it's also lacking. You set the course for your ship from an overhead oblique perspective-standard, adventure-game threequarter view. Then you hastily hit the Insert key on your keyboard (obviously an analog for one of the Sony gamepad buttons) and get the gunner's view. You use the Plus key to raise the cannon and the Minus key to lower it. Unfortunately, the on-screen perspective doesn't let you know how many quoins you've used to raise or lower the gun. Although there is a place on the screen to show the approximate elevation, it doesn't actually show what you've done to adjust the gun, so you are forced simply to fire and hope you've remembered correctly. Still, it's painful to think you've raised the cannon to a certain height so that you can bombard a fortress from a safe distance, only to discover that you haven't raised them as high as you thought you had. Such a small change would have made a big difference. BORING PARTY You'd think from this screen that there would be plenty to do, but you're stuck in spectator mode. Play the game New...

"REVIEW  BUCCANEER New! Cyberstik Gante Resuliy C ORONAM AMIVEL AULA It's How You Play The Game! STRATEGYZ WARGAMES HAPPY ENDING BUCCANEER uses the familiar splashpage victory screen. Affordable Virtual Reality Is Here! \"I LOVE TO SAIL IN A PLEASANT GALE ACROSS A DEEP AND BOUNDLESS SEA.\" Still, the ship-to-ship tactical battles are more interesting than those of Pirates! The 3D ships really matter as you try to take the wind gauge on your foe and put his ship under your lee in order to sail faster. The wind shifts realistically and offers an extra challenge: You have to watch the direction in which your flags are flying. The graphics shown as the other ship takes damage provide better cues for how the battle is going than those in PIRATESI and slightly more than those in HICH SEAS TRADER. This will save you from sinking ships that you intended to batter and board. Frankly, it's good that the ship-to-ship battles work, because that's all there is to the multiplayer game. You can connect with one other player by modem or serial port, three others by LAN or TCP/IP. You get to choose from the six ship types, but you'd have to be really good to try a flute in this quick-combat mode. Sadly, BUCCANEER doesn't feature different types of ammunition, You're stuck with round shot-there is no sign of grapeshot or chain shot. Fortunately, however, the game doesn't simulate fortresses using heated shot, so ships don't catch fire quite as easily. There are a few nice touches. Fortresses, for example, are tough enough that you will gladly fool them by flying a foreign flag instead of your pirate's flag whencyer you can. Flying a foreign flag will allow you to sucak into port, sell your cargo, and restock the ship-unless you have achieved such notoriety with the country controlling the port that they recognize your ship on sight. Of course, knocking down the walls of the fortress with cannonballs is APPEAL: Swashbuckling fans both more satisfying and a with lots of patience. bigger visual payoff.

"ELLIOTT CHIN ACTION 3C 3 man Why You Should Care Do Stories Matter In Action Games? movies. These games have been monopolizing my time, despite the fact that I very much wanted to play HEXEN II because of its fantastic artwork and QUAKE heritage think QUAKE will be the zenith of the jam-packed, adrenaline-pumping action game, the kind that relies solely on awesome technology and graphics to win favor. QUAKE had that intangible quality that vaulted it over other action games; part of it was its inspiring 3D engine and atmosphere, the other part was its addictive multiplay. For the single-player experience, though, I think action games have reached an cpiphany Things must change soon, and I think in JEDI KNIGHT and HEXEN Il we are seeing the baton being passed in the action world, from the sensory overload package to the more compelling, storydriven experience. \"What a minute,\" you might be saying. \"Hexen II and JEDI KNIGHT are both story-driven, role-playing-like action games.\" However, without trying to diminish the excellent artistic work at Raven and id, I think JEDI is a shining example of a story-driven shooter, while HEXEN II, by not getting everything right, shows you what not to do when you're trying to meld story and gameplay. What set me on this contemplative path on the future of action games were my gaming choices over the past few weeks. To be honest, I've been immersed in a variety of games, but what I've been playing most are FINAL FANTASY VII on the PlayStation (don't tell our Editor-in-Chief or I'll get fired!) and JEDI KNICHT on the PC. Both games, especially FI-VII, have great stories that unfold bit by bit, as if they were THE VANGUARD The more I tried to play HEXEN II, though, the more I turned to JEDI KNICHT. Then it hit me. While HEXEN II has great graphics and some incredible puzzles, I just didn't care enough to keep booting up the game. On the other hand, JEDI KNIGHT, which to my eyes doesn't look quite as good as HEXEN II, compelled me to return again and again. with its story and tantalizing promise of learning Force Powers. In a nutshell, I cared about playing JEDI, and I didn't care about HEXEN II. Why did I care? First, I was role-play ing the main character, Kyle, and he had a story to be told, one that unfolded the more I played. By creating a story, LucasArts has made JEDI a must-play title on three levels: in the general sense, on a per-mission basis, and on a personal (player/character) level. All you learn in the beginning is that the dark Jedi Jerec is after the Valley of t he Jedi, and that this is somehow connected to your father's death. The more time you invest in the game, however, the more you learn about your character and his story. Cut-scenes reveal key plot elements, and the missions themselves are tightly interwoven into the story. In addition to uncovering more of the story, I play JEDI to improve my character's abilities. When I learn a Force power, its a big event because I am learning an ability that directly affects the gameplay. I can jump farther, to previously unreachable areas; use new In JEDI KNIGHT and HEXEN II, we are seeing the baton being passed in the action world, from the sensory overload package to the more com compelling, story-driven experience. U UPPING THE ANTE HEXEN II is a good game, but JEDI KNIGHT, with its successful narrative, is better. JANUARY 1998 CGW "


"ELLIOTT CHIN NOTI)V offensive powers on enemies; and heal myself when health packs are nowhere to be found. On a per-level basis, I play cach mission not because I need to kill all the monsters and find the exit, but because there is a story-clriven reason to do so: finding a droid, decoding a disc. Basically, having a reason to play a level is always better than not having one. station. Outlaws did a fantastic job of piquing your interest and compelling you forward with its spaghetti Western theme, plot, and music. It isn't story alone that makes a game great, because OUTLAWS was otherwise a mediocre product. But when in-depth story combines with excellent level design and immersive gameplay, as in JEDI, you get that ultimate action game. HEXEN II is in direction. There is much to do in the large levels, but the game offers you little direction. In JEDI, you get direction via mission briefings, but in Hexen Il you simply spawn in a new level and are challenged with finding the exit. There is nothing inherently wrong with this type of gameplay, but there's nothing too compelling about it either. On the role-playing front, while Hexen Ils different character classes are a nice touch-especially in multiplayerin single-player, your character never grows enough to feel as if he is embarking on new paths of discovery. You remain essentially the same character with a few more hit points. By these comments, I don't mean to say that Hexen II is a bad game. It's pretty good, but because of the great disparity in the narrative experience, it just isn't in the same league as JEDI KNIGHT. THE OLD GUARD If JEDI is an example of how to make a game compelling with story and roleplaying, Hexen II is a good illustration of a game that falls short of that goal. HEXEN II has the role-playing elements and great puzzles, but it has 110 overriding story to tie it all together. The story is there only to serve as an introduction to the game. You don't care about your character because you're just a walking weapon-rack whose sole mission is to run through the levels until you find the end boss. Nor do you learn more by playing more. In Hexen II, you get no sense that you are making progress. People will keep returning to a game if it rewards them regularly throughout the gameplay. JEDI KNICHT does this wellwith its cul-scenes, mission briefings, summaries, and unfolding story--but HEXEN II doesn't Another area where the lack of a binding story hobbles was OTHER EXAMPLES? Some of the most compelling games of the past year-Outlaws and INTERSTATE 76—are also story-driven. These were games that had mediocreto-good action, but presented deep stories and goal-based missions to hook gamers. In both these games, you felt immersed in the universe and eager to continue playing to learn more about the story. INTERSTATE 76 did a successful job with its goal-oriented missions, which made you feel as if you had a role to play in the universe. You weren't there just to kill, but to make a difference in the world, whether it be saving schoolchildren from auto-villains or racing to find and save a friendly gas WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD? Aside from JEDI, where's the proof that the best action games are moving toward that story-driven goal? Zack Norman, lead designer on INTERSTATE 76 and MECHWARRIOR 2, agrees that story-telling makes a better game:\"There are any number of ways to immerse the user, but story probably happens to be the most compelling one. There will always be a place for disposable experiences (such as QUAKE and HEXEN). Personally...I prefer to play games that have narrative. I don't think I could make a game that doesn't contain story and 3D characters.\" Other game designers agree. Ritual is making SIN mission-based with specific goals per level, and will attempt to offer an unfolding story as well. DAIKATANA'S designer, John Romero, has also been very vocal about making it a story-driven game. You can also bet that LucasArts action games will continue to have strong stories, as will Activision's in-house games, such as the INTERSTATE and HEAVY CEAR franchises. Even id is trying to add a few in-game cut-scenes and a story to QUAKE II. As Norman says, there will always be a place for games that offer instant gratification via straight-up action. The games that will earn a place in gamers' hard drives as classics, though, will be those with deeper stories. These will be the games that lure players along, using the promise of more story, information, or deeper character growth, as the enticement. By doing so, and by making the gamer's progress translate into tangible results, action developers will finally make their audience care about characters and about what they play. STORYBOOK '76 The success of INTERSTATE \"76 can be attributed to the ongoing, continuously unfolding plot and story-driven, goal-based missions. CGW JANUARY 1998 "

I know, I know, I could have loftier goals. I know there are more important things to worry about. My daughter's education might be one, I guess. Those land mines in Bosnia. Global warming. But I can't help it. Ever since Denny began cleaning my clock in ACE OF EMPIRES -regularly, soundly, and with cold, warriorlike precision I've been longing for the moment when I could exact my revenge.

How How does Dennythat freakin' flight sim geek-keep getting to the Iron Age while I'm still futzing around with cavemen??? I wasn't exactly thrilled to be that guy, but there was one guy I wanted to be even less. Because I wasn't particularly good at sports, I channcled my energy into pinball and video games. One of the defining moments of my youth came when I saw a grown man cry over a pinball machine. It was at the Silverball arcade in Berkeley, the machine was \"Tommy,\" and this pathetic 30-year-old wretch was actually shedding tears-cursing and hitting the machine because the game wasn't going his way. This, I thought, is a sign. This is some one telling me something. Don't be that guy, Jeff Stop now. It's not that important. Then I promptly got $5 worth of quarters, marched over to Missile Command, and played until the pimply faced clerk who ran the place told me I'd have to leave if I wouldn't stop banging on the machine. Today, I wouldn't dream of banging on my machine; computers don't tilt, and there's nothing much worse than getting on the bad side of the fiery dominatrix from our IS department. But, I have to admit it: my game lock-my Right now, it's ACE OF EMPIRES. On the train, at home, at my desk, my brain keeps swirling with thoughts like: How does Denny-that freakin'flight sim geek-keep getting to the Iron Age while I'm still futzing around with cavemen??? He must be cheating!!!I can't stop thinking about this stupid game. I walk around in public, oblivious to the world around me, saying \"erectus» and \"hommus» out loud, working myself into a rage over the idiotic 50-character population limit, and of course, scheming about how to crush Denny the next time we play. I study the game's growth chart like a desperate fool-looking for the key that will ensure my future victory. I hear the drums and attack horns in my dreams, and have nightmares about being stuck in the Stone Age forever because I can't find any food, while Denny, in the meantime, is researching rocket science and nuclear power and has begun inhabiting other planets.

When I reported an odd bug that caused Windows not to recognize a properly installed joystick in late September, the company apparently hadn't heard that the problem existed. Yet l'd seen numerous reports of the same problem on the Internet ever since DirectX 5.0's release. It's true that creating an API that works with thousands of machine configurations is a daunting task, especially with third parties doing the drivers.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: IMPERIALISM GAMER'S EDGE Quick Start Guide Start Guide UNE MPERIALISM on the Nigh-OnImpossible level can be intimidating, Here is my guide to getting off to a good start. two of these countries. You should be able to build and sell finished goods periodically, but all surplus cash should be invested in your diplomatic efforts. Don't rush to increase the population of your capital city. Early in the game you will need more money than workers, and it will be useful to hoard as much food as possible for the middle game, when pressure on your railway network becomes intense. Incona If you can spare the timber to create paper, you may want to upgrade your work force. Don't forget to build depots or ports in every city in your empire. As your economy grows, these cities will Victory at Sea! begin to produce Tailand Ordure materials independently, a great bonus to your overall proSHIPS AHOY Keep ships, such as these three vessels off Ordune, on duction. Regardless the ready to run blockades in the event of war. of your domestic production, you should buy every scrap of raw material you can. All of them can be put to good use or stored for later consumption. Trading in raw materials is important, and should be limited only by your shipping capacity, which you must increase as much as possible. Sea of Tromso T ant ek toe te anda sedan bod de of 11 Ons Toter 10 understan Opening Moves First, pick a city site with the best possible population. Second, send your engineer to get timber, either by a quick rail line and depot or by building a port amid faroff forests. Third, go to the diplomacy screen, find a nearby minor power with coal and iron to offer for export and open trade consulates there. The trade screen also shows you which other great powers have opened consulates, try to start with minor powers that do not have trade consulates from anyone else, thus minimizing early economic competition. Don't pursue more than two potential colonies, because your money is scarce Fourth, build all industrial buildings necessary in your capital city. Use the surplus materials for rail and merchant ships, and get one extra population point. Buy a miner and use any extra paper to upgrade workers. Any idle workers should convert food to canned goods, and all timber should go to making lumber, rather than paper. Fifth, sell the rest of your finished goods to augment your cash. Take note, however, that the price of finished goods often rises after turn one, so unless you are desperate, you may want to wait a turn or two before selling. While at the trading screen, immediately place offers on wool or cotton, iron, coal, and timber. You are bound to run out of all of these resources, so start buying right away. Onto Clausewitz While military measures must take a back seat to economic growth, you have to build a few military units to keep the other players off your back. If you are fortunate enough to be an island nation, concentrate on ships. Even if a small deterrent force doesn't keep the peace, a four-or five-ship navy should keep your shores secure in the carly going. When you are at war, check cach coastal square each turn to see if your enemies are preparing an amphibious landing. Race your ships into any threatened areas, and move your land army to garrison threatened provinces. With quick movement a very small force can keep a much larger opponent at bay. Internal lines of communication are crucial to all defense maneuvers. Keep a single striking force in your capital province and zip it around your empire as provinces are threatened. Don't be too worried if a province falls, as there is no pillaging in IMPERIALISM. Instead, be ready to immediately counterattack. If you are faced with a strong enemy, consider building a raiding force rather than an invasion force. On the ocean, the benefits of raiding are obvious the computer Al tries it all the time, with considerable success. On land, build a few cavalry and light artillery and go hunting for weakly garrisoned provinces (Both these units can usually escape in the event that you make a mistake or fall victim to faulty reconnaissance.) Your raiders should bash whatever militia is on hand and move on as soon as possible. Don't bother to garrison conquered territoryif you could afford garrisons you could afford a bigger army. Often, the computer will be very sluggish in counterattacking, and you can impede your opponent's economic growth for some time. Also, you may end up signing a peace treaty while still holding useful territory. Transportation Network On subsequent turns (the first five steps should be taken on turn one) JANUARY 1998 CGW "

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS Achtung Spitfire Controlling the Tumultuous Skies Above the Thames by Robin G. Kim ging cynics lament that youth is wasted on the young. Could it be that a few reflex-impaired wargamers out there say the same about air-combat simulations and the virtual fighter jocks who fly them? No one can deny that the opportunities to delve into the fascinating realm of air-toair combat are few and far between for those gamers who prefer to ponder every move. However, if you fancy your self an armchair flight leader more than a joystick jockey, Avalon Hill/Big Time Software's ACHTUNG SPITFIRE offers the perfect opportunity to strut your stuff. Unlike most traditional wargames, however, ACHTUNG SPITFIRE pays strict attention to the laws of physics. The accurate modeling imposes complex restrictions on movement, which in turn raises the importance of proper maneuvering. Air-to-air fighting is also exceptionally fluid: At 20,000 feet there are neither battle lines nor terrain considerations. Positional advantages are purely relative, appearing and disappearing quickly in the heat of battle, So, if ACHTUNG's formidable Al has your pilots diving for cover, the tactics explained here can help you turn the tidle. Since the Battle of Britain is the heart of the game, we will focus mainly on the bomber interception and escort missions typical of this epic conflict. The Best British Defense Is a Good Offense Fighters are, by their very nature, offensive weapons. As an RAF squadron commander, you have to defend your homeland from its would-be invaders the only way you can: by knocking down their bombers. Unfortunately, the Germans are rather protective of them, so they are almost always accompanied by Bf109s or Bfllos. The trick is to penetrate this fighter screen and lay waste to the bombers without suffering significant casualties. The importance of keeping your pilots alive cannot be overstated: Too many costly victories will spell defeat in the long run. Ironically, the computercontrolled escorts intelligence is also their undoing. The Als immediate response when attacked is to turn toward your fighters, presenting your pilots with the worst possible shot opportunities. To take advantage of this self-preservation instinct, strive to approach from behind and to the side of the enemy, such that the escorts must turn away from the bombers to turn toward your fighters. If done correctly, this will put them completely out of position, neutralizing their threat potential for some time. With the escorts safely sidestepped (yelling \"Toro!\" at this point is appropriate), drive on through to the heavies. Don't waste ammunition on the THE BETTER PART OF VALOR If you drive your Spitfires straight through these German Bf109s, you will take horrendous losses. The safer option is to turn away and work for a better angle before attempting to slice past the escorts to get at the bombers, CGW JANUARY 1998 "


"STRATEGY & TIPS: ACHTUNG SPITFIRE GAMER'S EDGE The Thin Blue Line SURROUND AND POUND Forming a circle (or partial circle) of fast-moving fighters around these more maneuverable Spitfires is an effective means of neutralizing their turn-rate advantage. escorts unless presented with truly primo shots. Killing fighters may be glamorous, but it's hardly why you are here. If the German fighters are hot on your heels when you reach the bombers, do one quick pass and break off. Make it count by firing only at close range, then steer clear of the crossfire in the middle of the formation. If, on the other hand, the escorts take themselves far enough out of position, you can execute a more deliberate assault. In that case, throttle way back and try to camp your planes about 400 yards (four spaces) behind the rearmost bomber. From there, you can blow it to bits while remaining outside the firing range of its mates the lightly defended German bombers are extremely vulnerable without supporting fire. Once the first goes down, move onto the next. Keep your fighters close together to concentrate their firepower, but not too close or the movement system's one-plane stacking limit will force your planes to make unwanted maneuvers to avoid overlapping. Because of the uncommonly poor rearward visibility characteristic of early Spitfire and Hurricane models, lining all your fighters in back of the bomber group will cause you to lose track of the German escorts scrambling to catch you from behind. Let this go on too long and you will be in for a deadly surprise. The casiest solution is to take one plane that is either damaged or low on ammo and assign it lookout duty. Have it turn 45-90 degrees away from the bombers and weave back and forth at high speed, staying nearby while maintaining visual contact on the approaching escorts. Once the escorts are within 900 yards or so, it is time for you to firewall the throttles and break off. Any planes low on ammo or heavily damaged should get the heck out of Dodge. Those that remain combat-ready can try to circle around at high speed and do the dance all over again. Committing all your forces this way will likely allow the bombers to escape before you can reengage, however. Instead, use the lookout described earlier to keep tabs on the bomber group while the others lure the escorts away. The bombers will thus be prevented from fleeing, allowing your fighters lo bide their time, waiting for just the right moment to slip by the enemy fighters once again. or the RAF player in the Battle of Britain scenario, optimizing response time to incoming raids is a crucial part of any winning strategy. The idea is to keep as many fighters as possible ready for action at the forward airfields in Hawkinge and Manston. The problem with using these fields is that the Luftwaffe, cognizant of the airfields' strategic importance, will do their best to bomb them into oblivion. Such attacks will not damage any aircraft or personnel on the ground, thankfully, but it will increase the time it takes to repair, refuel, and rearm any of your planes that land there later. The solution to this problem is simple: Don't send your fighters to bombed-out airfields! If some of your planes take damage in a dogfight, split them off and send them to Hornchurch (assuming it hasn't been hit); they can be repaired there faster than at any other airfield. Vector the rest to the least damaged base near the eastern shores. As planes become ready, ferry them back to Hawkinge and Manston. Since aircraft require no servicing after a ferry flight less than 30 minutes long, your fighters will be instantly ready for action after they land, no matter how damaged the destination may be. There is no need to worry about these extra flights tiring your pilots, either, they don't affect fatigue levels. The more interceptors you have available, the more raids you will be able to deflect and the more casualties you will inflict. Keep an agile and efficient defense and victory will eventually be yours. Achieving Air Superiority If you're lucky, you'll be able to embroil the interceptors in a furball after or preferably LAND JANUARY 1998 CGW "


"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS: ACHTUNG SPITFIRE German Escort Service just as the RAF must attack bombers to defend Great Britain, so must the Luftwaffe defend the bombers to further its strategic offensive.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS The Space Bar Hop Aboard Starship Scorpia for a Guided Interplanetary Tour of THE SPACE BAR by Scorpia Fleebix and Thud HE SPACE BAR is a tough game to write up as a Scorpia's Tale. Much of the time, the puzzles don't lend themselves to helpful little mudges in the right direction. While I prefer not to give outright answers, in some instances it will be necessary to do that, at least partially. The first thing to keep in mind is that time is crucial in this game. You can't afford many wasted moves in and around the bar, each move is a tick on the clock, and those ticks add up fast. One way to save time is to save the game, explore the various rooms, making note of what's there, then restore. You may also want to do that when the computer terminal in the entryway is fixed; the info on the alien races is vital to completing some of the puzzle sequences. As noted in my review last month, THE SPACE BAR isn't all that nonlinear. Some flashbacks have to be done early, or you may become stuck in a nonwinning position. For best results, solve the Fleebix/Thud and Deven-7 flashbacks at the carliest opportunity. SeedRot and Click should be completed before you start finding any bodies. Soldier (the bartender) ought to be finished by around 8:00 or so, before the infrared jamming begins. Cilia and Bettaker can be left as the last ones. Always save as soon as you enter a flashback, just in case. In some instances, if you miss an important item or action early on, you won't be able to go back to it later. hud's flashback is simple, so get it out of the way first. Then go to Fleebix, who has perTHUD haps the most complicated of all the game's flashbacks. After taking the wrong bus and arriving at Glom Hole, check out the mailbox (don't forget the mailing label on the ground!). Naturally, you search the crash site for whatever you can grab after the mystery plane smacks into the fuel truck. A close examination of the fridge carton is also in order. Of course, out in the middle of nowhere, it's not likely to be picked up for delivery. Another location might be more suitable. On the way to the delivery, don't just sit there, see what else is inside the truck. Also listen carefully to the conversation between the two drivers for some important information. After delivery, do some more listening. You'll need to nip in and out twice, doing something both times. Then simply sit back and wait for your arrival at Quantelope Lodge, where the clock needs fixing before Fleebix can take his navigator's test. Unfortunately, you'll be sending Thud up and down the ladder a number of times during this sequence; it can't be helped. After the first visit, you'll know what's up there; pressing the yellow button will generate a report. Note especially the location of the «X» on the diagram. The next step is to get the crystals, which requires a little experimentation (hint: lever and one button), then put them back in properly. When that's all done, close the apparatus and start up the clock. Now Fleebix can take the test. There are four tests, all of the same type: Making deliveries around the galaxy without running out of fuel. Typically, it's best to get rid of the heaviest loads first. Remember, as the ship becomes lighter, It uses less fuel during the hyperspace jumps. So keep an eye on the hyperspace multipliers as you travel around. All four problems can be solved. Soldier Getting the egg to the shuttle is no easy task, especially as this flashback has two real-time segments with absolutely no margin for error. Move the egg into Food Prep, and explore the upper rooms for whatever you can grab. Make your way down the lift shaft, then back up via the SOLDIER mine tracks.

Here are a few tips to help you along (and to cut through some of the jungle): You need to negotiate with the environmentalists, politicians, Swonza-5, Gild-13, Dork-44, and Yeef-8. Deven has two of the bidders-Irk and Quosh-as guests in his home. You will have to talk to them personally to get them to put in their asking prices for Armpit III. When all negotiations are complete, work up an offer. Keep in mind that you don't need to have a bid on all items on the spreadsheet.

It needs to be centered, and the spear replaced with something else. After starting a flood, open the ventilation grate. This must be done before pushing the egg, as that starts the real-time segment and there is no allowance for even one wrong move. When you come out the other end of the shaft, act immediately. Take a breather, then get ready for the next real-time segment on the mine tracks. If it reminds you of Indiana Jones, you're not mistaken. Again, there is no margin for error here.

"CJIPS! Strategyl Wargames Simulations/Space PANZER GENERAL II 1. Ambush: 'The new recon rules make for much easier ambushes. If you know the other side doesn't have recon units in the area, put a decent defensive unit in the path of attackers about 3-4 hexes from where the attacker will begin his move. 2. Antiaircraft ambushes: Don't place your defensive AA units right beside high priority targets, such as artillery or weakened damage -save your best attacking units for last, when the defender is weakest, 4. Taking out Allied air forces: If you don't want losses to your wimpy Messerschmitts, you'd better employ antiaircraft guns to soften up the Allied air first. If necessary, trap enemy planes between two fighters and move a mobile AA unit underneath the fighter. On the next turn you should get a shot with the AA and then be able to mop up with your weaker fighters. 5. Move and defend: Most units \"unpack\" when attacked, unlike in PANZER I. This means that you can move antitank weapons right up to enemy units without fear of a disastrous counterattack. 6. As the Germans in the Blitzkrieg campaign: Don't worry about buying infantry, OKW will give you plenty as the game progresses. Instead, use your prestige to get artillery and aircraft. Focus your early spending on artillery, as your best units are available for purchase from Poland on and won't require costly upgrades later. 7. Use the computer's aggressiveness against it: If you want to take out an especially strong enemy unit-particularly entrenched infantry-get your artillery in place and then move one of your units next to the target. Don't attack, just wait for him to come after you and let your defensive artillery and direct fire do the rest. -Tim Carter armor. Both the computer and any human opponents are vulnerable to AA units too far away to see in advance, but close enough to provide defensive AA coverage. 3. Wearing down tough guys: Any defending unit will lose two defense points and one level of entrenchment for the duration of a turn for every attack against it. This means that even the toughest unit can be cut down to size if enough firepower is brought to bear, a crucial factor when you go against T34s and those tough Panthers and Tigers. Use artillery and air power even if it will cause no FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 If you get an error that says you don't have enough disk space free when you try to install FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98, you'll need to copy the MSCVRT.DLL and MFC42.DLL files from the sim's CD to your \\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM directory If you're having problems seeing the runway over the instrument panel, use ShiftEnter and Shift-Backspace to simulate moving your seat up or down. To see your frame rate, hit Shift-Z twice. To save some hard-disk space and achieve a faster program startup, delete the MSLOCO.AVI file from your FS98 directory. The program will function fine without the opening animation. Easter Egg: First, set \"Image Complexity\" to \"Very Dense.\" Then choose \"Go To/Exact Location\" and set Latitude to N47° 39.08', set Longitude to W122° 8.69', Altitude to 0, and Heading to 342.

MAN OF WAR W hile each country is limited in general to the types of ships it built historically, there are no restrictions as to when you may build and use them. So, in any American Revolution scenario, feel free to give the US 74-gun ships of the linewhy wait for the War of 1812 (when these vessels were actually built)? Also, all scenarios are determined by point totals, and the smaller force always starts the GORENG 116 game \"ahead.\" So, if you want a cheap victory with Admiral Nelson, you can win Trafalgar by running away without firing a shot. Likewise, the British can flee from Chesapeake Bay, leaving poor Cornwallis stranded in Yorktown. Such behavior can't be called a victory in a historical sense, but if you're in a cheating mood....

Here you'll find, raised upon pedestals, the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. ALONE IN THE DARK (1-Motion, 1992) Lovecraftian horror goes 3D, with shifting camera angles adding to the creepy atmosphere. KING'S QUEST V (Sierra On-Line, 1990) Redefined the graphic adventure with non-text-based parser and VGA graphics. THE BARD'S TALE (EA, 1985) Pioneered three point animation, 3D color mazes and automapping BATTLE CHESS (Interplay, 1988) The Franklin Mint of computer chess games with violent and funny animation disguising a solid chess engine. LEMMINGS (Psygnosis, 1991) The lovable cartoon Lilliputians were real-time hits on every platform THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND (LucasArts, 1990) Comedy adventure that sel new standards in writing quality and social sensitivity. BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR (Dynamix, 1993) As rich and imaginative as Raymond Feist's world itself, its 3D perspective was fresh. LINKS 386 PRO (Access Software, 1992) Topped the leader board in graphics and realism for its era. THEIR FINEST HOUR (LucasArts, 1989) WWII sim with great campaigns and crew member options some current sims lack CHESSMASTER (Software Toolworks, 1986) The Cadillac of castling, this chess masterpiece gets better with each version. M-1 TANK PLATOON (MicroProse, 1989) Realistic sim that properly focused on armored forma. tions rather than single vehicles, good mission designs DUNGEON MASTER (FTL Software, 1987) Trend-setting graphics, digitized stereo, and great hack-and-slash from a decade ago. MASTER OF MAGIC (MICROPROSE, 1994) The atmosphere and variety of MAGIC: THE GATHERING with the sophistication of CIVILIZATION MASTER OF ORION (MicroProse, 1993) Remarkable diplomatic Al: deep and varied technology tree; aliens required radically different playing styles. TIE FIGHTER (LucasArts, 1994) Most satisfying Star Wars space-combat game to date lets you live on the dark side.

"MARTIN CIRULIS whatchwor, 2 man What's the Deal With... Fortune Telling? when the review is pretty much a fait accompli? Regardless of how great or awful STARCRAFT turns out to be the reviews are, for all intents and purpos es, already written. The pressure on any critic is simply to rubber stamp all that has been said. Hands up out there—who thinks this trend is a good thing? And it's not just STARCRAFT; two or three games every quarter reach this critical mass of coverage, in which expectation can shoulder reality aside. For Clin see a growing danger in computer game mags today, we are slowly becoming soothsayers instead of reporters. There was a time when, except for the occasional preview, we were pretty much grounded in the present. Reviews were the bulk of any given magazine, and Overview or comparison pieces were generally about games that were already published-verifiable commodities. Gamers could then use this information to make choices, with a reasonable guarantee that whatever they were reading was on the up and up. If it wasn't, then there was little room for the guilty or mistaken to shuck and Jive. But times are slowly changing. Now the big games are previewed not once, but two or three times. The fact is that magazines and Web sites are hungry to get the news out first and flashy, and sooner or later, accuracy becomes an endangered species. Games of similar subject matter are rated against each other while most are still in the mid-beta stage. The Buzz has grown to such biblical proportions that the odds of having unbiased reviews of hot games are dwindling-across the industry A case in point: STARCRAFT. Now at the time that I write this, no one has seen final copy on this blockbuster, and while I am pretty sure that it will be the slickest thing since sliced cheese, I have to wonder: What if, for whatev. er bizarre reason, it isn't? What's a reviewer to do when everybody in the business has previewed this puppy at least twice, given it a half-dozen gush blurbs and covers apiece, and proclaimed it, ipso facto, \"strat game of the year\"? What the hell do you do if this game ends up biting the big one, ( The odds of having unbiased reviews of hot games are dwindlingacross the industry.72 Gaming Monthly could smear the words \"QUAKE 9 I N 4D!\" across the cover, fill a page and a half inside with a few bad jpg's lifted off the id Web site, and print a paragraph interview with some guy who might have seen a design spec for the game in a dumpster while he was taking out the trash...and sales for Bubba that month would skyrocket. No ifs, ands, or buts. Satan himself could appear in every store across the land and claim a magazine is printed in the Kingdom of Lies, and if it has yet another preview of a big game on the cover, or a promise to help you decide which games that aren't even fin. ished yet) to buy, half of you would buy it anyway. It's hard to argue with an economic truth like that, and the effects are beginning to show. And it's even harder to say what should be done about it. Other than observe that maybe we should all relax and wait for Christmas morning to open our presents, or commit a publishing blasphemy and urge you to quickly scan the alluring article in question before you buy a mag to see if there is anything relevant being said, there isn't much we in the business can do. In the end, you people have the dol. lars, and it's you who call the tune most of the time. If you, the readers, want fortune-tellers instead of reporters, then we have to dig out our swami gear or you'll go elsewhere I will leave you with this one dark thought: This hunger for information before a game is finished is going to eventually give the industry the handle it has always wanted on review mags. Someday soon, the game companies are going to start dribbling out their little preview morsels only to the mags that make them happy, and you don't need an econom ics degree to see the writing on the wall for the end result of that one. It'll be a question of playing ball or getting trampled in sales by those who will. every four games that are rightful winners, one turns out to be a dog. And a whole bunch of you end up wasting your hard-earned bucks and curs. ing the fact that all us reviewers are corrupt, lying bastards or bastardettes. But who is to blame for this seductive undermining of the critical eye? I blame you, the gaming public!
