"JOHNNY WILSON editne in What Makes A on Good Game? The Eightfold Path To Great Game Design conquer cities in a given order, it's not the kind of classic game that keeps them coming back time and time again. For example, we here at CGW loved MERCHANT PRINCE and its remake, MACHIAVELLI, when we ALERT WARCRAFT uring the holiday season, was privi leged to be interviewed by a number of broadcast journalists about computer game gift ideas. Many of the reporters wanted to know what makes a good computer game. At first, I wanted to hedge. After all, what makes a computer game seem good to me may be irrelevant to you. Yet, I felt that I could go a long way toward building understanding of the hobby if I could articulate a few coherent thoughts on the subject, so here is my eight-step path to great game design: A good game is winnable, with the possibility of defeat. Gamers like to win, but they savor a victory when it's a close call, a hard-fought triumph. Games that are too easy aren't fun, but neither are games which are too hard. Play-balancing-the art of adjusting the game's values so that the possibilities for victory and defeat are either even or only slightly in the gamer's favoris even more important to a game's success than the depth of the graphics palette or the quality of its soundtrack. Good games offer authentic choices so that gamers' decisions really matter. If the game forces players through a cergiven task. It may be that they tain pathway, regardless of their gain more command capability earlier choices or successes and and, as a result, are allowed to failures, or both, they won't feel deploy more, or better, units or like their decisions make a differ resources. It may simply be that ence. When gamers don't feel like they are granted appropriate they're making a difference, they recognition through the presenta don't get any satisfaction out of tion of medals, citations, promoplaying. tions, knighthoods, etc. Yet, howGood games allow gamers ever it is accomplished, a good to feel like they are getting game lets gamers feel like they're more proficient. This can be getting somewhere. Good games allow gamers to continually discover new things. Games like CIVILIZATION II, CONQUEST OF THE NEW WORLD, WARCRAFT II, and C&C: RED ALERT let gamers discover the game world piece by piece, uncovering a map from unexplored realms. Games like CIVILIZATION II, MASTER OF ORION II, MASTER OF MAGIC, DEADLOCK, and even lesser games such as ASCENDANCY allow gamers to unfold a technology or discov. Men PROTEery tree so that their capabili ties constantly increase. For What makes these adventure and role playing games like DAGGERFALL, DIABLO, and games great? MISSION CRITICAL, discoveries often shown in several ways. It may require finding artifacts, getting become easier for them to wipe information, and uncovering trea. out the initial enemies faced in a sure through encounters with game, so that those spiders or aliens, monsters, suspects, or rats that used to take two or three townspeople. hits to destroy now only take one Games should have more or two hits. It may merely be that than one path for winning. If gamers are told that they have gamers always have to build the gone up a level in skill so that same technology at the same point they can succeed more easily at a in the game or they always have to ( Gamers should never think things are so hopeless that they can't make a comeback. ID 14 BLO first started playing them. Unfortunately, as soon as we discovered that you could always win by purchasing influence in the church, we lost interest. Replayability, if not a certain open endedness, is part of what makes a good game great. Good games have solid pacing. Gamers should never feel that things are so hopeless that they can't make a comeback. Even when they're losing, there ought to be a sense that they can get things under control with the right strategy, even if they have to play a longshot to make it so. Being out of control is only fun for a short time; restoring order is what makes the victory sweet. SG MARCH 1997 "

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH R m ON LAWYERS, ON-LINE, AND WASTED SPACE The January 1997 issue touched briefly on three important issues which I feel deserve some commentary Johnny Wilson's piece on corporate lawyers attempting to stamp out custom levels and user-generated scenarios depicts the sad state of affairs at some (but not all) game publishers. Because many of these publishers seem ica mun of these publishers seem unable to give us what we want in a gaming experience, they will attempt to destroy through litigation, things like cheat programs, editors, and other utilities devised to make the games more enjoyable. I cannot believe that LucasArts Star Wars license is threatened by an externally-developed level editor. This is a standard response from copyright holders, who claim that the value of their properties will be lessened, but it's a claim that doesn't cany the burden of proof on the copyright holders. Prove to me the value of your property will lessen. If anything the value of the property will increase because many of these extemallydeveloped editors increase the accessibility of the game to other users. So, screw LucasArts. I can get along just fine without playing their games. There are other companies which actually encourage user participation with their games. Two notable examples include Sir-Techs JACCED ALLIANCE: DEADLY GAMES, with its ultra-cool Scenario and Campaign Editor, thus allowing us to make game after game with the JA engine; and, of course, id's QUAKE. Id did some thing completely revolutionary with QUAKE. The game itself is just more of the same, and indeed, even dull (I got bored playing the single player game and quit without finishing) But where the revolution occurs is in its allowing everyone to have access to the code, and to make whatever they want out of that. From QUAKE, we are getting things like QSOCCER, a football game, vehicle driving, bizarre patches that allow for new weapons, new monsters, and on and on. It takes a gutsy company to do that, and they should be applauded for delivering an entertainment product that doesn't punish the uiser, and that encourages continuing developent in its name. OK, point number two. Ken Pritchard's Letter of the Month mentions a fact which I think is underestimated by most gaming publications. There are a lot of us gamers who simply don't want to play online games. Of course, online gaming is hot, but I think people need to be careful about overhyping the new phenomenon. It won't replace singleplayer gaming, it will be another option. Some games will find their strength in multiplayer online gaming, others will find their strength in being played by a single person alone with their computer. The standard line is \"Why would you want to play against a poorly-designed Al when you could play against human opponents?\" Well, Pritchard mentions several reasons why human opponents may not be optimal. Plus, there are a lot of assholes out there whom I really don't care to meet, online or not. I just don't feel the need to link up with someone and play the latest computer game. I'd rather play the game by myself. And there's no reason why a game has to have poorlydesigned Al except for laziness on the part of the publisher. The new trend of releasing a game that supports both single-player and multiplayer modes -with the single-player mode being completely lame and tacked on REAL-TIME: NO DEAL Real-time wargames? (\"What's the Deal With... Real-Time?\" December, \"96) Please, NO! While I enjoy COMMAND & CONQUER and even WARCRAFT 2. I always fall back to a boardgame or a computer wargame for a good strategic/tactical game. I do not wish for a more realistic game in the sense that I'm pressured for time and trying to click on a group of infantry faster than my opponent (oh, yeah, this really adds to the realism!). I would like, however, an intelligent, playable, and reasonably historicallyaccurate game that rewards good strategic thinking, not fast reflexes. Turn-based works much better in this regard. I would absolutely love to see companies adapt existing boardgames to computer format so that the bookkeeping is less of a chore and the player can concentrate on actually playing. Avalon Hill's COMPUTER THIRD REICH is a good start. If I wanted to be held hostage to real-time, I'd pick up a tank simulator program or stick with C&C. Incidentally, I can recall one game that did combine real-time with wargaming. 'That was PATTON STRIKES BACK. Remember that one? I didn't think so. It would indeed be a sad day for wargamers if Mr. Cirulis gets his wish and we do one day see the \"End of the Turn-Based Games as we know them.\" If that happens (heavy sigh), at least I will still have my closet full of board games. Kirk M. Carroll Charlotte, NC QUAKEWARRIOR? Game editors such as Quake C let you make custom mods like this MechWars hack. For more details, see this month's Quake Page in \"Gamer's Edge.\" On the CCW editorial staff, we like both real-time games and turn-based games. To us, the real-time games offer more of a sense of urgency, and the turn-based games provide more of an opportunity to scor the options. The former is better at presenting the reality of tactical command levels, but the latter gives one a better sense of feeling in control.

"LETTERS UNA 90290 29 9 . ATLATOR The V eld! LESECOMBAT 1-800-931-2343 ET Zone IT'S NOT REAL Let me quote from your recent preview of LucasArts REBELLION: \"In both the strategic and tactical portions of the game, your enemy is moving his picces simultaneously with you in real-time.\" Now, since the strategic portion of this game encompasses wresting control of an entire galaxy from the opposition building bases, staging invasions, and sending fleets on missions of conquest how in holy hell can it be staged in real-time? Are you seriously suggesting that it takes several years to complete the game? And if you actually have full years in which to move your units around, but can accelerate time, then what benefit is offered by this real-time hype-besides being able to print \"REAL-TIME!!!\" on the box? Or does real-time as you are using it here translate to the player needs to make a decision (that would actually be made by a full general staff over the course of several weeks) in 15 seconds?\" Aren't we talking about enormously accelerated unreal time? What it boils down to is that most Benedict REAL-TIME WARGAMING CLOSE COMBAT is in the middle of the debate between real-time and turn-based wargames. The game sold well, and has become popular on Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone at www.zone.com. IN should choose the mechanics which best fit the design intent. This issue definitely seems to have hit a nerve, though. Check out this next letter. Gammy STAR WARS Eachuset LETTER OF THE MONTH 3 die New Star Wars Games The Ultimate Gaming PC Die, Robot Dark Ron far, haven't felt like I missed anything. Anyway, that's it for this letter. I still like CGW quite a bit and hope you continue to improve. Thanks for listening, Mark Rose via the Internet >>>Continued from pg 22 to increase sales should be halted forever. Finally, point number three. Walt Huber's letter brings up two interesting thoughts. You definitely should let people know if the game can support multiple players in network mode or if each player needs to have a separate copy of the product. And, I want to give a rousing \"Hear! Hearl\" to his comment that your magazine spends way too much time talking about alphas and previews of upcoming games. CCW isn't the only offender, of course. All the game magazines do it and, frankly, it's pretty liseless. Half the time the games come out with a completely different feature set than previewed, and the other half of the time the games never come out at all. Usually, previews and alpha looks are written in an optimistic tone, and when the game is released, that optimisrn turns to disappointment. Short looks at games to be released in the next two months or so are OK, just so we know on what to spend our gaming money. But I would much rather read an in-depth review of the released game, or a discussion of the patch and how it affects an already released game, than anything about a game that isn't yet on the shelves. Again, this isn't CGW's problem, it's all of the game magazines. What I do now when I read CGWor any of the others is to simply skip over the Preview pages. Never read'em at all, and so real-time games are simply mechanisms for camouflaging deficiencies in the Al by forcing the gamer to hurry. At a platoon level, perhaps real-time offers some benefit, but in a game of galactic grand strategy? So long as I have a full hour to decide when to invade Coruscant, then perhaps I'll believe your claim that REBELLION IS a real-time game. Scott K Stafford from the Internet We hear you, but we also want to make sure you noticed that Joly Wilson's editorial also womed how copyright protection was necessary or companies would have to resort to encryption and protection schemes that would mitigate against scenario and campaign editors. So, the game editors are essentially under siege from two directions: overly-aggressive interpretation of copyright on the one hand and interational complacency with regard to copyright violations on the other, We also hear you about online games. One reason why we only focus on online games in a few issues per year is because we think the hype is too far ahead of the curve. As for your comments about sneak previews, you'll notice that most of our editorial space is devoted to reviews and strategies of games that you can play now: Since we only review from final copy, sneak previews provide early information that many of our readers use to see if upcoming games will appeal to them. We agree that the industry trend is to cover games too far in advance to be useful, but gamers often state that they want previews, u nd our job is to give them what they want.

The new world view is so secret that Bullfrog wouldn't even allow CGW a screenshot. We did get an early peek at the title, though, which looks very advanced for a game not scheduled for release until summer. It is being produced under the supervision of Alan Wright (MAGIC CARPET 2), and follows the same basic scenario as the other POPULOUS games: Worshippers do your bidding and Wildies wander around aimlessly, lead. ing shallow lives until they're converted to your religion, in an all-too-accurate portrayal of mankind's history. There are plenty of 3D disasters to contend with, including insect plagues, a ghost army, earthquakes and volca noes which can be called down from the heavens at whim, as you battle against up to three Al opponents. With three other titles due out before POPULOUS 3, including THEME HOSPITAL, (a sophisticated sequel to Theme Park), Bullfrog is worried about letting the cat out of the bag too soon. But from what we've seen, POPULOUS 3 is likely to be the most user-friendly God sim to date, and could well broaden the genre's appeal even further.-Alan Dykes "

The problem was solved by drawing from top writers in both game design and scriptwriting worlds. Dan Greenberg, an award-winning paper game designer, wrote the original interactive material.

"GAME TRACK FIRST LOOK PIPELINE 3/97 ere's your first look at games in development. These games aren't even playable yet, but we thought you'd want to see how they're coming along. Black Dahlia in January, 1947, the tortured and dismembered body of an aspiring actress named Elizabeth Short was discovered in a vacant lot in Los Angeles A reporter immortalized the memory of this once raven-haired beauty by writing about her as the \"Black Dahlia.\" The murder of Elizabeth Short was never solved, and still provides fod der for true crime aficionados to this day. Take 2 has taken a different tack with cerning the involvement of Nazi spies into a fascinating fiction built around some intrigu. ing research and art deco-period art. Players take on the role of a special agent for the C.0.1. (predecessor of the O.S.S. which, in turn, was precursor to the CIA). As a special agent, you have to investigate reports of a Nazi bund operating in Cleveland, and the resulting strands of evidence will take you through 80 different locations in both the U.S. and Europe. DECO ETAGE Of course, the 1940s still had their share of classic art deco hotels left over from the Jazz Age. the Black Dahlia story. Although the game still deals with the murder of Elizabeth Short, you'll wonder if she is truly the Black Dahlia or if that is a term for something else.

"SNEAK PREVIEW DARKLIGHT CONFLICT Space Combat Sans Chrome A Space Opera That Relies on Gameplay, Not Video Footage, For Its Voice by Cal Jones n action game that stands on good old-fashioned gameplay is a rare commodity these days: It seems that you can't even have a humble platform game without a million bucks worth of special effects tacked on in the form of a few non-interactive cut-scenes. It's as if developers aren't sufficiently confident to sell a game on its own merits. Are they frightened that games won't sell without the requisite flashy intros, FMV, and animated renders? Well, there's one company which refuses to follow the trend towards producing expensive GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT eye candy. Rage Software, based in Liverpool, Developer: Rage England, believes that fun is more important Publisher: Electronic Arts than flash, and is currently hard at work on a Target Release: March game which promises to be so utterly playable that it will knock your socks off. DARKLIGHT CONFLICT is a mission-based 3D space combat game that has more in the way of gameplay than the entire WING COMMANDER series put together. GPREVIEW SPECTACULARLY SPECULAR Explosions cast blinding light on your battles. FAMILIAR PLOT Set in 1999-a scant two years away—the game places you in the role of a U.S. Navy pilot fighting drug barons in South America. In a plotline reminiscent of The Last Startighter, you're suddenly whisked away by aliens and sent to war in some godforsaken galaxy millions of light years away from your home planet. Despite having pressed you into service, the reptilian Reptons seem like a decent enough bunch. Their foes, on the other hand, the bird-like Ovons, are truly fearsome. However, what you don't yet realize is that the Reptons are evil carni. vores who eat their captives, and so ultimately you'll end up fighting both races in a bid to save humanity from a nasty fate. While the plot is not exactly original, it's mere window dressing, The game's main attraction is its white-knuckle action. The game offers three modes of play, starting with an arcade mode comprised of five levels, where the object is simply to score by destroying enemy ships. Alternatively, the game caters to network play, and includes missions designed specifically for multiplayer action. For a greater challenge, opt instead for the campaign mode, which includes five separate campaigns of ten missions each. In this mode the plot becomes more relevant, but unlike WING COMMANDER, DARKLIGHT isn't one of those games where completing or failing a mis sion affects the storyline. Progress is linear, and if you flunk a mission you have to do it again until you get it right. RING OF FIRE Jumpgates are your entryways into hyperspace, CGW MARCH 1997 "

THE BADLANDS Just because you're traveling through hyperspace, it doesn't mean you're safe from attack. GOD HELP the anarchy planets of Elite, you'll be more than happy with DARKLIGHT's exhilarating combat. Although I've stressed the gameplay element, DARKLIGHT isn't an ugly game by any means. Rage, whose previous projects include the highly underrated 3D blaster PYROTECHNICA, has kept the graphics clean and attractive. Rather than go overboard on texture mapping, Rage decided to up the number of polygons in order to create complex 3D objects which look clean and solid. Using unlimited light sources, specular reflection and a bundle of lens flare effects, light from stars, explosions, and nearby stuns forms reflections and shadows on the ships as they whiz past, so that they appear as though they're really there, rather than pasted in as an afterthought. DARKLIGHT CONFLICT is shaping up to be one of the surprise hits of 1997, and it's refreshing to see a company more concerned with impressing the dedicated gamer than the graphics connoisseur. Beauty, in this case, is not so much in the eye of the beholder as in the hand holding the joystick. And that's where it counts. YOU. SHIVERS THERE IS NO TRY, ONLY DO This doesn't make DARKLIGHT boring, however. Each mission has a different objective, whether it's retrieving a valuable object with your tractor beam, destroying an installation, or mining ore from asteroids.

To help you, you'll have access to 15 weapons and five differ. ent types of ships, from bomber to gunship so variety is clearly not a problem.

"SNEAK PREVIEW  ABE'S ODDYSEE What's Eating Him? ABE's ODDYSEE IS A Dazzling Adventure In The Tolkien Tradition by Ken Brown Alias software. It was originally rendered in 1024 x 768 in 24 bit (16 million colors), so that the developers could save the environments for future games in the series (four are planned). Since today's PCs can't quickly process that much data, Offworld reduced the pixel depth to 640 x 480 x 8 bit color, and they apply a real-time interpolation algorithm to the game to enhance resolution. The result is a beautiful, MYST quality visual experience through which you can actually move very quickly. The character movements have also been carefully crafted. The sprites in ABE's ODDYSEE are composed of approximately 18 ani. mated frames per movement-comparable to good cartoons. The movements look realistic on a Sony PlayStation, but on the PC the game will likely require a good graphic accelerator to move briskly. GPREVIEW n an age when most computer games either have a \"2\" in the title or bear a striking resem. blance to earlier successes, it's refreshing to see some. thing different. While the makers of this game, Offworld Entertain-ment, haven't reinvented the wheel, they certainly did away with most of the elements common in SNEAK other action/ adventure games. There are no keys or GAVE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT crystals to pick up, you aren't controlling an armed soldier hellbent on destruction, and there Developer: isn't even an inventory per se. Instead, the game Offworld Inhabitants focuses on an original story, interesting charac Publisher: GT Interactive ters, and puzzles that logically \"fit\" in the environTarget Release: ment. The mechanics are similar to Broderbund's November. '97 side-scrolling PRINCE OF PERSIA II or Psygnosis SHADOW OF THE BEAST, but the story and execution are decidedly different. ABE's ODDYSEE is the story of Aboman, the forlorn gollum-like protagonist under the play. er's command. Aboman is far from hero caliber, appearing rather homely and weak, whose stitched lips symbolize his enslavement by the Magog Cartel. As a Mudokon, Abe was getting along okay on a diet of meat dishes like Paramite Pies and Scrab Cakes, but when he saw a poster advertising new Mudokon Pops, that did it. Suddenly Abe had a mission: save his fellow creatures from extinction by destroying the cartel and its evil leader. So off he goes, one pissed Mudokon with a major axe to grind. GAMESPEAK: GIMMICK OR GESTALT? Offworld devised a clever way to get to know your character: an interface called Gamespeak lets you control Abe's speech. While he blinks at you from the screen, a list of options appear around him with their control keys so you can make him talk. Gamespeak teaches ABE'S WORLD The world in which Abe lives is a splendidly designed and rendered 3D environment, thanks to Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 Extremes running HANG TIME Abe can hide from scrabs in shadows, but he needs to use that hanging basket to get away CGW MARCH 1997 "


"ABE'S ODDYSEE. SNEAK PREVIEW he's not immune to mistakes-Abe can blow him up just like the rest of the characters-So you'll have to be careful (after you blow him up once or twice for grins). OMMMM Abe uses his chant to control the slig above. That's Abe's trusty pal, Elum, at right. PLANE HOPPING As you know, Abe's Oddysee is a side-scrolling affair, which is a design with known limitations. To add variety. Offworld threw in some z-axis twists. The first is a series of pendulums that swing forward and back and serve to block Abe's movement. It creates an effective puzzle while suggesting that all of the action isn't under glass. The second is more elaborate. It consists of a sort of vacuum tube that transports your character to another place. When Abe hops on an inlet, he sometimes pops up on another screen, and other times he reappears on the same screen in the background. When this happens, Abe's size is perspective corrected, and his audio cues are subdued since he's talking from a distance.\" Offworld made these \"boom tubes\" an integral part of the game design, GOING POSTAL The slig under Abe's control so that Abe's pas. can be lead back to his friends to share the sage through them magic of machine gun fire. isn't just for conve. nience Offworld has also put some thought into players' fondness for save games. You can save the game anytime you choose. You may not need to save, though, since Odvysee automatically restores your character after you die. This is graphically depicted by a flock of birds that swarm to the reincarnation point and morph into Abe. you how to make Abe whistle, chant, and say \"Stay.\" \"I don't know.\" \"Okay,\" and \"Follow me.\" He can also express anger, issue a respectable Bronx cheer, and fart at will. These cues function as a kind of inventory, since they can trigger other characters' actions. Once you've played with Gamespeak, you're ready for the adventure. The action consists primarily of side-scrolling maneuvers across bridges, ledges and other terrain. Abe's movements include: walk, sneak, run, jump, roll, hoist, crouch, and running jump. Abe can also use primitive elevators, throw items, set explosives and do other kinds of crafty things. Pretty soon, you'll run across a creature that wants to kill you. The most common enemies are sligs, a sort of foul-tempered guard with a big gun, and scrabs, bizarre, ugly creatures that trounce their victims and stamp on them. Sligs are susceptible to Abe's mind control chant, which subjugates the little thugs to your control. Since the slig carries a machine gun, this comes in very handy as you direct the slig back to his buddies and burp several rounds into them. The other common villians, scrabs, aren't susceptible to mind control, which presents a tougher challenge. You can elude a scrab by distracting it with food, or you can agitate scrabs to trigger a fight. Scrab duels are to the death, which makes your life a little easier, Other puzzles require you to hang from ledges, hide in shadows, or set explosives. Most of the puzzles are consistent with the game universe, but taken together they connote adventure in the classic fantasy tradition, a Tolkienesque journey in a strange land populated by evil creatures. Another Tolkien similarity can be The Slig found in Abe's discovery of a loyal He's mean, mechacompanion, a strange two-legged nized, and loaded. beast known as Elum.

Light infantry is more maneuverable, but can't hold for long against the shock value of heavier units.

"SNEAK PREVIEW THE GREAT BATTLES OF ALEXANDER The Battle Song Remains The Same It's one thing to imagine the power of a Macedonian pha lanx, it's quite another to see a phalanx with a full head of steam scattering light infantry in its path when 21-foot spears collide with enemy shields. ere's a look at how the units of ALEXANDER are depicted on both boardgame and computer. Keep in mind that any information displayed on the cardboard counters is readily available from the com puter game's interface. PHALANXES Note the limited movement, due to the long spears, and the familiar double-wide, unwieldy formation I'M IN COMMAND Another departure from most strategy games for ALEXANDER is the realistic and fun-command control and movement systems. Instead of the usual method of you move everything, then I move everything, ALEXANDER employs a different turn structure. The player with initiative, (usually Alexander) selects a commander, and orders units under his control to advance, withdraw, rally, or attack within that turn phase. The opposing player then selects a commander and follows suit, with players alternating until all commands are exhausted. The twist is that no one, not even Alex himself, can issue orders to every unit under his command in a single phase. After a player has finished with a commander, he may attempt to sustain momentum, based on the leadership and charisma ratings of that particular commander. This could result in another immediate orders phase for that leader, the passing of initiative to the other side, or even (rare, but possible) the abrupt end of the entire turn for both sides! Meanwhile, the opposing player may decide to use his own initiative to trump his enemy and move a for. mation instead! Not only is this an exciting game mechanic--you never know for sure whose phase will come up next-it's quite psychologically realistic in practice, captur. ing the ever-changing momentum of the battlefield. PERSIAN CAVALRY Fast and maneuverable, but they had trouble with phalanxes. Where are stirrups when you need them? COMPANION CAVALRY Probably the finest troops of the ancient era. If phalanxes were the anvil, these guys were the hammer. WAR ELEPHANTS When fighting mad, they could trample all, even Phalanxes. Of course, they could also go berserk at the most inopportune times. CHARIOTS These were hot wheels in the Pharaoh's day, but were somewhat dated on the Macedonian battlefield. EYGINUS OGEMUM TROOP QUALITY IS JOB ONE The other key to Alexander is troop quality, which takes into account the training, morale, and confidence the various troops had in their respective leaders. Every time a unit moves, fights, checks its morale, etc., its troop quality (TQ) comes into play. TQ tends to decrease with fatigue, and as TO SAMACHANDIS goes, so does a unit's cohesion.

Unlike the boardgame, ALEXANDER has a PANZER GENERAL like campaign. Thus, without a lot of complex rules and sub-systems to cover rout, casualties, and stragglers ad nauseum, ALEXANDER realistically-and elegantly-simulates the essence of ancient battles. Crushing your opponent's will to win, rolling up his flank, and watch: ing his army fall apart at the seams is a tremendously satisfying experience. ALEXANDER also shows, in a way that no history book can, why the Macedonian military system held sway on the battle field until the rise of the Romans. There are still questions to be answered, particularly concerning the Al and how smoothly network and modem play will be implemented. Nevertheless, the boardgame on which ALEXANDER is based already has that rare combination of being the definitive historical treatment of its subject and a riot to play as well. We'll be surprised, given what we've seen so far, if the computer game isn't even better. MARCH 1997 "

"\" TRESPASSER: JURASSIC PARK COVER STORY BREATHTAKING 3D SCENERY whatever is happening in the world. Whenever there is a collision in the game world, the program's physics engine sends out location information, data on the intensity of the collision, and databased information on the materials involved (density, objects, etc.). Then, a portion of the program known as the Sound Daemon receives the message and decides upon the appropriate sound, volume, pitch and location cues. One of the test programs used by in-house sound designer and associate produc er Brady Bell and in-house sound engineer Brandon Lee models a steel cube. By dropping the steel cube on different terrain (flat ground, side of a mountain, water, etc.), it makes different sounds according to the collision routine. To enable this Sound Daemon program, SoundDelux has had to revise their foley tech: nique. Now, they do one-sided foley work. This means that, for example, they might record one sample of wood being hit hard and another of wood being hit softer. Now, assume that the player wants to hit a smaller piece of wood against a tree. There are actually two sounds involved: a hard hit related to the tree as one object and a softer hil related to the wood used to strike the tree as another object. The sound engine will determine how loudly to play each sample and THIS IS GAMEPLAY! Dreamworks' sophisticated graphics techniques include 3D modeling of how to combine both samples into a convincing every dinosaur's skeleton and musculature.

At the same time, other cool events have occurred in the usually sedate world of mass storage. Let's take a look at what's going on now and peck into some future developments. concerning the demise\" of magnetic hard disks over the years, but every time the pundits once again predict the end, disk speeds and data densities dramatically improve. Hence, optical technologies, flash memory, and other potential heirs to the throne haven't become mainstream. Lately, though, things have gotten even crazier. Several companies have shipped EIDE hard disks in excess of 3CB, with 4and 6CB drives on the horizon. You can Will game makers feel the need to fill up a 5GB DVD disc? IL THE MYSTICAL HARD DISK I've long believed that of all the different technologies built into modem computer systems, the hard disk is the one item that works purely by magic. When you get down into the world of magnetic domains, flying heads, and other arcane technolo gics, hard disks seem like bumblebees: The damn things shouldn't work, but they do. There have been a number of reports also get 9GB SCSI hard disks. The speed of hard disks has improved dramatically as well. Access times-a measure of how quickly the magnetic head moves from one part of the disk to another-have dipped below 8 milliseconds (ms) in some cases, and even average drives have access times in the 12 ms range. The average rotation speed has increased as well, with speeds of 5,200 and 5,400 RPM becoming common in EIDE drives; a number of SCSI drives now spin at 7,200 RPM. Seagate has recently announced that it will be shipping 10,000-RPM SCSI drives soon. \"There's another speed increase that's hidden in many newer drives. The bit densities on the drives themselves the number of pits that can be crammed into a square inch-have radically increased. So a newer drive with a given platter rotation speed can read or write more bits than the older oncs. Ergo, more data can be transferred, but there's a catch. Due to all of thiese performance-increasing factors, an EIDE hard disk can actually feed data to the system faster than the motherboard can handle it. Although most newer motherboards support Mode 4 PIO (Programmed I/O) transfers of up to 16.6MB/scc, for various technical reasons, the best you can get out of standard EIDE drives is slightly less than 8MB/sec. Riding to the rescue is Quantum Corporation, who has developed an enhancement to LIDL called Ultra ATA you may you may also see it referred to as Ultra DMA/33). To Quantum's credit, the company has licensed the technology to other drive vendors at no cost, and Intel has already announced that they'll ship Ultra ATA-enabled chip-sets for future motherboards.

The downside to Ultra-SCSI is its maximum cable length of 15 meters (much shorter than the previous six meters) — irksome if you mix internal and extemal devices. floppy replacement. The high end of the removable storage business has heated up. Iomega shipped its Jaz drive in mid-96, but the product was so popular it was hard to find one. \"The Jaz is a ICB removable hard disk, rotates at 5,400 RPM and has a 12 ms average access time-so it's a true hard disk replacement. At roughly $120 per ICB cartridge, it's reasonably cost-effeclive, too. On this front, however, lomega's chief competitor, Syquest, didn't wait very long before shipping the 1.3GB Syjet toward the end of '96 and has recently uipped the Syjet's capacity to 1.5GB. THE STORAGE ELEPHANT Overshadowing all these CD-ROM drive developments is the looming prescncc of DVD drives. DVD drives offer more than 6GB of storage on a roughly five-inch platter. They will be faster than CD-ROM drives, and the consumer drives (and probably many computer DVD drives) will have MPEG-2 decoders built into them. It will be a while before DVD game titles become common, but DVD drives will be able to read standard CDROMs as well, though how well is still an open question (see this month's Editorial). By the way. DVD doesn't stand for anything. Until last summer, there were two competing DVD standarcls. The groups merged but couldn't agree on what DVD incans, so it's an acronym without words. Go figure.... TO INFINITY AND BEYOND One of the most useful trends in the last year is the increased capacity of removable devices. On the low end, Iomega has practically stolen the market with its ubiquitous I0OMB Zip drive. Toward the end of '96, Syquest shipped the EZ-Flyer, their second (and more successful) attempt at penetrating the low end of the removable drive market. Its removable 230MB media deliver nearhard-clisk speeds. Tomega hasn't been sitting still, though, and is busy trying to sign up vendors for its newest version of the Zip drive, which is intended to be a bootable replacement for a floppy drive. The downside with the Zip is that it's not backward compatible with the old standard 1.44MB floppies. A new company, O.R. Technology, is offering the Drive, a 120MB magneto-optical \"floppy\" drive that can also read standard 1.44MB 3.5\" floppies. But it'll need a BIOS update in most computers to be a true bootable CD-ROM DRIVES: WRITE 'EM COWBOY In the past year, the prices of some recordable CD-ROM drives have dropped to under $500, though these are still all SCSI drives. Some can be used as a standard CD-ROM drive, too, but due to the need for a much more massive head (for the write laser), they'll never be as fast as dedicated, rcad-only CD-ROM drives. Last November, a consortium of companies announced the CD-RW standard, which will bring to market CDROM drives that will make CDs true mass storage devices, allowing lisks to be written, crased, and rewritten as needed. CD-RW has the potential to be a great backup device. CD-ROM drives have, predictably, gotten faster and faster. Coldstar recently announced a lox CD-ROM drive, and there are a gaggle of 12x drives out now. The newest twist is Western Digital's new SDX connectivity standard, where SDX MUNDANE NO MORE In the past, mass storage has seemed a pretty mundanc topic, but recent developments in storage will mean significant new capabilities for computers and, hopefully, for future games. Bigger, faster storage begs an interesting question, though: Will game companies feel compelled to fill up a 5CB DVD platter? Just how many 3D-animated sequences and video cut-scenes can we tolerate? After all, we're game players; we're not into watching movies on the computer. Let's hope this new space frontier will be used for something other than massive cut-scenes and 50-games-on-a-disk compilations. The game, after all, is the thing & CGW MARCH 1997 "

"Hot Rod Your PC Turn Your Current Clunker Into The Ultimate Gaming Rig by Loyd Case n the last three issues, CGW has covered various takes on the ultimate gaming machine, but all three were based on the assumption that you wanted a whole new machine. Most of us have computers already, so buying a whole new machine may not be in the cards, particularly if you bought your system in the last year. But it is possible to move your current systemt up to ultimate rig status, one step at a time. ILLUSTRATION: CARY HENRIE. PHOTOGRAPHY: JOHN POPPLEWELL CGW MARCH 1997 "


"he key to wringing the best possible performance out of your current box is to build it into a well-balanced system. Buying a big hard disk won't help much with Windows 95 if all you have is 8MB of memory, for example. Sit down and take a good, hard look at what's in your existing system, find out where the bottlenecks are, and prioritize the upgrades. Then, you'll be ready to launch into the upgrade process. The big questions are the following: What do I upgrade first? Which components will have the most impact? What's the right strategy for planning an upgrade? Think of your upgrade strategy as a sort of triage, where the slow est component gets the first upgrade, so as to allow the rest of the system to better perform. Since upgrade budget sizes vary, we have two upgrade plans: turbo and nitro. Our turbo plan options for upgrade components are solid additions to any system, but with an eye towards price and performance. The nitro plan options are top-shelf components where price is less of a consideration than all-out performance. instead, that you have to budget instead, that you have to budget your purchases and upgrade gradually. You're beginning to become dissatisfied with your system's TURBO Micronics M55Hi performance on some of the newer, state-of-the-art games, Plus (Pentium motherboard) Note: Be sure to get but you haven't yet reached MMX-compatible version. the point of desperation. The obvious thing would be to buy NITRO AIR PONPI (Pentium a faster CPU or more RAM, Pro motherboard w/embedbut instead I'd actually recomded SCSI controller) mend a new motherboard. Why a new motherboard? The newer chip-sets from Intel, the 430HX and 430VX, offer signif icant new features, such as connec tors for a universal serial bus (USB). What's more important in the short term is that Micronics, AIR they're more effi cient at moving data through the system with features such as concur. rent PCI and support for faster memory types like EDO and SDRAM. If you pick the new motherboard carefully (look for Socket 7), you'll be able to drop in a Pentium MMX CPU. One thing to be cautious about is the form factor of the motherboard. Most older systems use motherboards with the baby.AT layout, which is directly descended from the original IBM PC AT layout. Lately, there have been a number of motherboards on the market which use the ATX form factor. ATX motherboards are laid out differently, yielding more efficient cooling, easier installation and better access to the expansion slots. The catch is that an ATX board will require a new case and power supply. This is not nec essarily a bad thing, but it does add cost. He's Dead, Jim First, let's deal with old systems. I mean, really old systems-you know, 486DX2/66s and slower. In computer years, these babies are pretty much Smithsonian-bound. Don't waste money upgrading them. Unless you have a very savvy local dealer, or are technically capable of building a system from scratch, just get a new computer. You can cannibalize the Old Gray Mare and recoup the floppy disk drives, Sound Blaster card, speakers, the keyboard, the mouse, and maybe even your monitor. So if you do have one of these babies, stop reading this now, go get the last three issues of CGW, and read the first three parts of the ultimate gaming rig series. The Mythical System Let's look at a system that may have been, at worst, middle-of-the-road a scant 18 months ago. Our system is a Pentium 90, in a mid-tower case, with a 14 or 15-inch monitor, 8MB of RAM, and an 850MB EIDE hard disk. It has a PCI graphics card, but it's probably a 32-bit card with a slower graphics chip, such as a Cirrus Logic or Trident accelerator. If it came with a CD-ROM drive, it's most likely a 2X or maybe a 4x drive, connected to a proprietary controller. For audio, there's probably a Sound Blaster Pro or 16 (or clone) and a pair of small, self-powered speakers. Topping it all off is a formerly state-of-the-art 14.4 Kbps modem. As for the not-so-mythical user of our typical system, let's assume you're either technically savvy enough to eviscerate the guts of this beast, or you know some one who can. TURBO 166MHz or 200MHz Intel Pentium Processor with MMX Technology (P55C) Brain Transplants But back to our gradual upgrade strategy. After the new mother board, the next addition is probably more RAM. Surprisingly, adding more memory has a significant positive impact to performance, particularly if you're running Windows 95 games. If all you have is 8MB, consider getting 32MB of EDO DRAM-60 nanoseconds (ns) or faster-which will work very nicely in our suggested motherboards. If you already have 32MB of RAM, and it's 70ns or faster, it's Start From the Start The hardest part of the upgrade process is deciding where to begin. We want to create an incremental upgrade strategy that will allow the user to grow their system gradually. If you're simply going to buy a pile of hardware and replace it in a couple of days, just buy a new system. Let's assume, NITRO 200MHZ Pentium Pro.

"THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE  PART 4 ally speed up memory accesses. Also, get a good CPU cooling fan, and consider adding a second fan to your case, because Cyrix chips tend to run a bit on the warm side. probably not worth replacing. Instead, it's now time to consider a new CPU. Of course, if the budget is a bit bigger, it's probably worth the few extra bucks to get the new P55C processor, not so much for the new MMX technology (see sidebar), but because of its double-sized 16K Level 1 cache. On the other hand, if you're taking no prisoners, and you're getting a compatible motherboard, why not go whole-hog and get a Pentium Pro? It's worth con. sidering, but bear in mind that the next generation of Pentium Pros, code named Klamath, are just MONITOR around the corner-and they will require different motherboards. That TURBO Princeton Graphics said, if your lust is for the best 32 E070 17\" bit processing power you can get, the Pentium Pro is it. NITRO ViewSonic It's also worth debating alterna PT810 21\" tives to Intel, such as Cyrix's 6x86 and AMD's K series.

However, the P55C has MMX support and is now faster than the equivalent 6x86, so if raw performance rather than cost is the deciding factor, then Intel, once again, is the leader. If you plan on adding a Cyrix (or IBM) 6x86 P200+, make sure your motherboard can support the 75MHz memory bus speed, which will actu Painting Pictures Okay, now we have a fast CPU and ade: quate memory Unless your hard disk is very small (in today's terms, very small is anything Princeton, ViewSonic under 850MB), the next thing to add is a graphics card. Maybe you've seen your friends playing the 3D accelerated vers ion of TOMB RAIDER, QUAKE, or NASCAR 2, and the idea makes your mouth water. There are two possibilities: You can add a fast combination 2D/3D card, or (if you have a fast 2D board already), you can consider a dedicated 3D accelerator. The second approach may yield the best overall performance, but if you are truly on a budget, your wallet will not be happy. Consider a good 2D/3D combo card to start. All have their strengths and weaknesses, but probably the best solution for serious gamers is cards based on Rendition's Vérité chip. Be aware that the standard VGA graphics performance of the Vérité is sub-par, though Super VGA graphics are quite speedy. Surely you're not upgrading your system to play VGA graphics games? Remember that buying a combo card doesn't preclude you from adding the dedicated 3D accelerafor at a later date, if your budget and inclination allow. After you pop in your new graphics card, you'll suddenly become aware of an unusual phenomenon: your monitor has gotten smaller. Well, not really, but it'll seem that way. After upgrading the card, the next logical step, unless you already have one, is to consider a 17-inch monitor. With some very nice 17-inch monitors available for less than $600 these days, it's hard to resist. MMX: Gaming Panacea? intel By Dave Salvator There's been much ado from Intel and in the computer press about MMX technology, which is now available in 166 and 200MHZ Pentium chips, code named P55C. Pentium Pro versions of the chip, code-named Klamath, should be available soon. Intel has given a long winded official name for these new offerings--Pentium Processor with MMX Technology (we'll stick to calling them P55C) and will be looking to aggressively move these chips into mainstream machines this year. The result will most likely be a minimal price difference between similarly clocked MMX and non-MMX Pentiums. You should go ahead and buy the MMX Pentium, not so much for the MMX technology, but for the improved overall performance that will come from the doubling of the Level 1 (L1) cache from 8KB to 16KB. When Intel's new MMX-equipped P55C CPU looks for data or instructions, it first checks the L1 cache, a 16KB area of SRAM running at the CPU's inter nal clock speed. If the desired data or instruction isn't found, this is called a cache miss, and the CPU next checks the Level 2 (L2) cache (usually 256KB or 512KB), another area of SRAM which runs at memory bus speed (66MHZ). If the search of the L2 cache yields a cache miss, the CPU must then go to slower system memory to find the desired data. There's been a good deal of debate as to whether MMX will do much to speed up games, especially 3D action titles. The fundamen tal problem, which Intel has quietly acknowledged, is that the MMX unit uses the same physical part of the chip used by the floating point unit. And since 3D action games and flight sims tend to be very floating-point-intensive, especially for geometry setup early in the rendering pipeline, too many mode switches (each of which requires 50-60 clock cycles) might actually introduce a performance hit. Despite the potential pitfalls, a Pentium with MMX is still a worthwhile investment for the larger L1 cache. Whatever else MMX brings to the party most likely for less demanding multimedia titles) will be gravy. inside pentium CGW MARCH 1997 "

Data rate claims range anywhere from 6X to 8X, though we've heard anecdotally of lower performance from early models. DVD versions of game titles probably won't be forthcoming until sometime next year, so you might do well to hold off getting a DVD ROM drive until your next round of upgrades. Fortunately, there are sev. eral alluring alternatives in the form of 12X EIDE drives well under $200, and 12X SCSI drives for less than $250. NITRO Aura Series 700 SOUND CARD TURBO Creative Labs Sound Blaster 32 NITRO Creative Labs AWE 32 with a Yamaha SW 60XG MIDI Card Space Exploration The next thing to tackle is the hard disk. Think big. Think really big. Anyone who thought that CD-only games would save on disk space was astonishingly wrong. Games-not to mention other applications -have a seemingly endless appetite for disk space. At a minimum, get a 2GB drivebut consider a larger drive if you can swing it. If you've got a true performance Jones, you'll also upgrade to ultra-or wide SCSI at the same time. But if you do, don't settle for slower hard disks running at 5,400 RPM or less. You've just shelled out over $200 on an ultrawide SCSI controller-adding a hard disk that's no faster than an EIDE drive just doesn't make sense. Go for a 7,200 RPM drive, or wait for the newer dri ves that spin at 10,000 RPM (Note that there are a number of motherboards out there now with built in SCSI controllers; you might look into one of those when upgrading your motherboard). For most of us, this level of performance is something of a luxury, so get a bio EIDE drive instead. Even then, the performance differential is smaller than it used to be. The new Ultra DMA/33 (a.k.a. Ultra-ATA) drives can theo retically move data at 33MB/sec, compared with ultra-wide SCSI'S 40MB/sec. SCSI still holds the edge in CPU utilization, though. Just be aware that Ultra ATA drives may not run at full performance on DISK CONTROLLER your standard EIDE controller, but when you move up again, you can TURBO Motherboard-based take the drive with you, saving on a PCI EIDE future expense and getting better performance. NITRO Adaptec 2940-UW Of course, now that you have a (PCI Ultra-Wide SCSI) seemingly infinite amount of disk space, you'll need something to DISK DRIVE back up your critical files. A remov. able drive such as lomega's Zip TURBO Seagate Medalist drive or Syquest's EZ-Flyer should Pro 2540 (EIDE) fit the bill nicely. If you have a larger thirst for backup capacity, Iomega's NITRO Quantum Atlas II Jaz drive, with its somewhat pricier (Ultra-Wide SCSI) 1GB media, should quench it. After you have your humon. CD-ROM DRIVE gous hard drive, the next step is to upgrade the CD-ROM drive.

They're also backwards compatiSound and Fury Probably the last thing to upgrade is your audio system. In the past, the squeaky music that emanated from the old-fashioned FM Quickshot, Aura synthesis of Sound Blaster Pros and SB 16s would make your teeth itch, but these days it seems most music in games is digital rather than MIDI. Still, you can get pretty good wavetable MIDI and better-sounding digital audio by upgrading your sound card. There are a number of contenders out there, too, including Creative Labs' new AWE 64, Aura's model 140, and the Turtle Beach Tropez Plus. With more Windows 95 games hitting the store shelves, we're looking to the day where Sound Blaster compatibility is no longer the limiting factor in choosing a sound card. PCI-based sound cards are in the works from several vendors, with some delivering positional 3D audio. While titles that take advantage of this new feature may be few in number early on, this is a cool technology on the horizon. Speakers, despite their importance, are often the weakest link in an audio chain. If you have those dinky multimedia speakers on your desk, try hooking up a good set of headphones to your sound card and playing one of your favorite games. You'll be surprised at what you've been missing. Get a new set of speakers and if you can afford it, get a set with a self-powered woofer. BACKUP Are You Connected?

"THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE  PART 4 Individuality Rules Probably the single best piece of advice about upgrades is to be sure you buy some future with your new components. That is, spend enough on a component so that it won't have to be upgraded for some time. Your system may not be exactly like our mythical gamer's. You may already have a good graphics card and big hard disk. I hope that this strategy can be used as a template in developing your own upgrade strategy.

"The Most Respected Reviews In The Industry For 15 Years om te REVIEWS DMT 1.80 p. 146 p. 100 Classics/Puzzles: Classics are old stand-bys and parlor games that appeal to many different types of gamer. Examples include backgammon, bridge, chess, and MONOPOLY. Puzzle games emphasize spatial relationships, word games, and/or problemReviews Policy We only review from the final copy of the game. Though it has become popu. lar among PC gaming magazines to review from late beta copies, we feel that the reader is best served by reviews of the same version of a game that readers can buy. While we recognize that this may cause some delay in coverage, we believe the reader is better served by such caution. We expect our reviewers to finish the game. CGW reviews are not based on early impressions of a game. In some cases, bugs make it impossible to finish a game, but we identify those cases in the review. p. 164 from a first-person perspective: you may control a submarine, fly an aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed sci-fi environment. Sports: The sports category is a broad genre which includes sports action games (NBA Live), sports strategy games (FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO) and sports simulation games (NASCAR RACING 2). . Strategy: Problem-solving, short and long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk-management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X.COM, MASTER OF ORION), as well as \"pure\" strategy games (WARCRAFT II, COMMAND & CONQUER) and \"building games\" such as SIM City and CAESAR II. Wargames: A subset of strategy games, wargames recreate historical con. flicts from a command perspective. They may be tactical, operational, or strategic, and stress anything from logistics and fire. power to morale and leadership. How We Classify Games  Action/Arcade: The emphasis is on hand-eye coordination and reflexes, usually emphasizing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure: Games where you control an alter ego and move through a storyline or sequence of events, where puzzle solving has a more important role than conver sation and combat. solving without requiring gamers to follow a storyline. Examples include SHANGHAI and TETRIS. Role-Playing: RPGs are a subset of adventure games which allow you to choose a character class and increase their attribut es. Conversations with non-player characters (NPCs) and tactical combat are generally more important than in Adventure games. Simulations: Highly realistic games HOW DO WE RATE? We only review finished product, not pre-release versions. The ratings are as follows: Outstanding: The rare game that gets it all right. The graphics, sound, and gameplay come together to form a Transcendent Gaming Experience. Our strongest buying recommendation. Very Good: A high-quality game that succeeds in many areas. May have minor problems, but is still worth your money, especially if you're interested in the subject matter or genre. Average: A mixed bag. Can be a game that reaches for the stars, but falls short in several ways. Can also be a game that does what it does well, but lacks flair or originality. Weak: A game with serious problems Usually buggy, seriously lacking in play value, or just a poorly-conceived game design--you should think long and hard before buying it. Abysmal: The rare game that gets it all wrong. This is reserved for those products so buggy, ill. conceived or valueless that you wonder why they were ever released in the first place.

ADVENTURE/RPG TREAD LIGHTLY Be careful not to walk too far into unexplored territory, or you might end up like this poor soul. cable connections, and Blizzard has given the world free access to its battle.net online multiplayer arena. All you need for battle.net is an active internet connection, and you're in. Setup for every connection type is unbelievably painless, with no configurations to tweak and no learning curve to master. Multiplayer games are primarily cooperative, but there is an option to make your character dangerous to others in your party if you prefer deathunatchstyle dungeoneering The multiplayer levels have tougler opponents earlier on to compensate for the additional heroes, and all of the stairs from town are open, allowing a party of highlevel characters to head directly to the lower levels of the dungeon. The first time we had a multiplayer DIABLO session in the office, this game became an instant musthave for everyone on the staff. The one feature we would have liked to see is the ability to use single player characters in multiplayer conquests, but sadly that's not included. Another serious bummer is that to play the full version of the game in multiplayer mode, every user must have the CD. \"Spawning\" is supported, but this only lets users play a limited version of the game tel BUBBLE BE LEADING YOUR FRIENDS INTO DARKNESS The game's multiplayer options let you descend into the dungeons with up to four friends, leveraging the strengths of the different character types. DIABLO SUPports TCPIP, IPX, modem and direct CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM Try to organize your inventory wisely. With the limited space available, you can't afford to waste any. Missing In Action DIABLO has had a noticeable impact on my life. I now get of average one hour less sleep each night, and my wife is about to check me into the Betty Ford clinic. I had an casier time quitting smoking than I do putting this game down. From the first steps in town to the final battle with DIABLO, this game is a solid bull's-eye. If Blizzard isn't careful, they might find DIABLO regulated by the goverment as an addictive substance. My recommendation: If you are interested in this genre at all, you have to have this game. TABLO is a great game, but it's missing a few elements that keep it from getting our highest rating. First of all, there isn't enough interactivity with the town and its people. It doesn't feel so much like a community with living people as it does a pit stop where you restock on health, mana and weaponry. We get a good feel for Tristam's back story when we read the manual, but not when we play the game. It just doesn't feel like a real town Instead of just showing Griswold standing outside his shop, Blizzard could have let us go inside and see him forging and fixing weapons. Or we could have gone into the tavern, bought a drink and talked to Gillian the barmaid about the town's troubles. We know Tristam's supposed to be desolate, but it still feels more like a static snapshot, especially given the depth of traditional RPGs like DAGGERFALL. How about seeing the caravan that delivers the town's supplies come in? Or how about seeing running water in the streams? Simply put, the town could use more life. The game could also use different endgames depending on which character you play. This is supposed to be role-playing, right? So why do we see the same movie whether we're playing the male warrior or the female rogue? The experience and the reward should be different depending on the character you play. Blizzard has come up with an exciting game here. Now that they've perfected their engine, hopefully they can spend their time on making Diablo 2 a better role-playing experience. APPEAL: Anyone who enjoys thirdperson action/RPG games and has a pulse. PROS: Great interface, awesome gameplay with excellent replay value, exceptional multiplayer setup and play, added value with battle.net. CONS: Only one save game slot per character, shallow role-playing elements, limited play in \"spawned\" games. MARCH 1997 CGW "

"REVIEW  NOIR ADVENTURE/RPG works is heavy into Eastem decor, but you won't be very popular here. the death of his racchorse, Pegasus. No way to know which case led to Slayton's disappearance, so the only thing for you to do is start investigating them all. This is the game's first and biggest problem. It's good for an adventure game to contain multiple stories and subplots, but it's bad to dump six storylines' worth of exposition in the player's lap right at the start of the game. It's just too much to absorb all at once. The game starts in the most boring and conventional environment imaginable the detective's messy office--and asks you to spend your first hour or so opening desk drawers one by one and reading through Slayton's files on each case. The most exciting moment comes when you get to use a key you stumble upon to unlock Slayton's Rolodex. KILLING MOON, PHILIP MARLOWE, and THE DAME WAS LOADED all started in what was, for all practical purposes, the same office. Note to designers contemplating starting their games in this way: it's been conc. Where do you go next? Well, if you're brighter than I am, you follow up on a hint in the Rolodex and visit the apartment of Joan Lafontaine, Slayton's girlfriend. If you try going anywhere else either by walking out the front door and clown LA's mcan streets or by choosing a location from a map in the office), you're likely to hit a lot of locked doors and dead ends. While the cases can nominally be investigated in any order, in practice you often can't visit certain locations until you've made progress at others. Unfortunately, the part of the game when it is hardest to make progress is the very beginning. I spent several hours wandering aimlessly around empty locations before I found one that let me get started on a case. As you progress, the bottlenecks become fewer, but the empty locations do notand this is Noir's second big problem. Great still photos of period locations napped, and a bootlegger-gone-legit is looking for his wandering daughter. The other three cases are more varied: a friend of Slayton's hired him to find out how much a rare German book might be worth; Watkins Cryptography hired Slayton to test the firm's security and track down a suspected leak; and philanthropist Charles Winthrop hired him to look into IN 1914, YOU COULD SAFELY RIDE THE NEW YORK SUBWAY,  Broderbund Software, Inc.

"NOIR . REVIEW or a bus that's right in front of you, you sometimes have to click on it four times before the game, which has been inching you forward in baby steps, allows you to get inside.) The net result is a lot of turning in place and getting lost, mostly on silent, static, black-and-white screens. There and there are video interludes triggered by your actions, and some of these are effective. But they are too few and too sporadic. They are also too obvious: easy jokes, familiar situations, scenes you've seen a thousand times before. Yes, after you've pounded the pavement for a while, knocked on a lot of doors that remained shut, and gotten thrown out of more joints than you can count, the stories begin to come together in a satisfying way. But it's too little too late. The gameplay remains a chore, the writing and acting never rise above the level of a picture (though the plotting does), and the whole enterprise smells musty as a mothballed fedora. ADVENTURE/RPG FIERY PASSION PLAY These hot love letters tie together one of the intricate plot connections between the six murders. may make good background art, but they do not make a good game. In far too many of the game's locations there is nothing for you to do except exit, often onto a screen that itself offers similarly little to do. The game's disorienting navigation scheme doesn't help: most scenes contain too few visual links between one view of a scene and the next for players to keep their bearings as they move around, while some perversely slow down the action by throwing in extra steps between two locations. (When trying to enter a taxi THE PLOT THICKENS, BUT TOO LATE Where the game stops being obvious is in the intertwining of its stories.

And who do you think penned the screenplay for the dog-loving movie star's biggest hit? Max. APPEAL: Fans of old detective flicks may get a charge out of seeing a game done in black and white.

"** * REVIEW .CLANDESTINY DIFFICULTY LEVEL Scotch Whimsy ADVENTURE/RPG Scooby-Doo Meets THE 1171 HOUR In Trilobyte's Scottish Cartoon Tale by Robert Coffey GROOVY GHOULIE Solve CLANDESTINY'S puzzles and you'll lift the curse on your ghostly ancestors like this delightful monster baby same mix of puzzles and riddles featured in the hour. All your old favorites are here: the coin game, the word maze and two slider puzzles. And don't worry, CLANDESTINY hat do you get if you mix Saturday morning cartoon animation with the eerie but beautifully rendered environments of THE 7 CUEST and THE ITHOUR? Something very much like CLANDESTINY, Trilobyte's weird and umeven adventure game/interactive cartoon that mixes traditional 2D animation with photorealistic 3D backgrounds. CLANDESTINY's creators deserve credit for trying to shake up the traditional horror puzzler, but this effort never quite pulls it together; it is hampered by limp gameplay and attempts at humor that often fall flat CLANDESTINY casts you as Andrew McPhiles, a meek American and last heir to the McPhuiles clan of Scotland. Summoned to Scotland to claim your legacy, you're faced with dispelling the curse that has plagued 12 generations of your heretofore unknown family CLANDESTINY borrows hcavily from other games, including using the mousedriven interface from The HOUR, though the beckoning skeletal hand of that game seems oddly out of place here. The co-opting of elements from other games wouldn't be so bad if something new were done with them. At the very least you'd hope that throwing cartoon characters into the genre of stuffy, selfimportant adventure games would result in some pointed satire, Who doesn't want to see Sam and Max let loose in the pompous world of Mysi? But CLANDESTINY passes up this golden opportunity in favor of doing a Scooby-Doo episode without the laughs or the great dane. It would be easy to overlook this shortcoming if CLANDESTINY's gameplay were strong, but it isn't. CLANDESTINY uses the Vam NO as they charge right through the game. CLANDESTINY's art is top-notch, with castle rooms sporting the same eye-catching attention to detail that distinguished THE 7TH GUEST and The TMT HOUR. The animated cut-scenes may lack any unique sense of character, but they are a dead-on re-creation of the Hanna Barbera style both in look and voice-acting. In the end, there's not a lot to say about CLANDESTINY, if only because there's so little to it. Newbies tentative about gaming may enjoy it, as may kids, though! doubt many kids are going to get jokes with obscure references to Men Without Hats \"Safety Dance.\" Despite its quality production values, CLANDESTINY just doesn't amount to much. Price: $49.95 System Requirements: Pentium 60 or better processor, Windows 95, 8MB RAM, 8MB harddrive space, local bus video with 1MB RAM compatible with DirectDraw 2.0 or later, 2x CD-ROM drive, Microsoft-compatible mouse.

Trilobyte's old standby, the knight puzzle, is here as well, only with dinner plates tak ing the place of chess pieces. Anyone willing to assist me in stealing all the chessboards from Trilobyte's offices late some night, please contact me via CGW. Another big problem is that it's just too easy: the game's three difficulty settings are basically moot. Should you run into a problem, the online hint system will blatantly nudge you toward the answer or even solve the puzzle, all without penalty. Absolute beginners may welcome the effortlessness of the challenges, but seasoned gamers are bound to feel cheated APPEAL: Novice gamers and cartoon fans; anyone who thought THE 11TH HOUR wasn't cute enough. PROS: Trilobyte's usual high-quality graphics; tanimation and voice-acting that re-creates that special Scooby. Doo feel. CONS: Easy gameplay, lifeless humor, a wasted opportunity to either satirize or do something new with the genre. Reader Service #: 321 CGW MARCH 1997 "

"TOMB RAIDER  REVIEW NOT1) game's secret areas each level has a handful -where you'll find ammo for the game's advanced weapons or first-aid kits. This is not to say that TOMB RAIDER IS ideal. The game engine has some quirks, the concept some limitations; developer Core Design will need to address both if the sequels--two are in the works are to cement TR's status as a classic. The camera angles are an occasional problem. While the camera reacts dynamically to setting and circumstance, it typically follows the heroine by a few paces. In tight and twisty places, this sometimes means that surrounding scenery slips between you and the young woman, and you can't see her at all. Moreover, the camera position is subject to the same constraints as Lara herself — it can't move outside the level's walls, and this can lead to some bad moments in combat when Lara's back is to the wall and the camera swivels to show us Lara herself, neglecting to show the lion or bear she's fighting Sure enough, the game enables you to look in any direction with a keypad combo. That's very handy for finding secret areas, calculating jumps or just getting your bearings. But it's effective only when Lara's at rest. (You can't change your view and fire at the same time. In back-to-the-wall situations, the game should be a bit more forgiving and adopt cither over-the-shoulder or top-down views. Here, the engine's getting in the way of the game. Clipping or collision detection is off throughout. Most of the violations are minor-Lara's leg disappearing briefly as she brushes an adjacent stone block isn't likely to send people back to the shops waving their receipts but still annoying There are moments here and there when this threatens to puncture the suspension of disbelief. At one point, you have to trigger the fall of a great hammer, which in tum knocks loose a pair of large stone blocks, which have to be used as steps to make progress. I pushed one of them into the hammer's head. Not up against it. Into and through it. That said, I didn't find any crash bugs. But I did come across a glitch. Swimming against the current under water in a fastflowing river in 4 8 the Lost Valley-not exactly pushing the boundaries of what the player might be expected to do-I found that, upon going over the falls, Lara was teleported to the ceiling and OUR KINDA WOMAN Many of the creatures you'll encounter are dropped into aggressive monsters, but Lara knows how to handle a variety of the top of the weapons. What a babe. falls. Very weird. The auto-targeting mechanism is another sore point. When her guns are drawn, Lara will automatically target the nearest available enemy. Now, leaving aside the issue of whether she should be doing the targeting for you-shades of Descent II's annoying Guide-Bot found this tended to spoil the game's surprises. The auto-targeter routinely noticed enemies before I did and gave it away by CRETACEOUS PARK The pacing isn't shifting Lara's aim appropriately. Who's ideal.

"**** REVIEW SKYNET DIFFICULTY LEVEL NOTTOV INTERMEDIATE Short Circuit Eight Missions In The Sequel To FUTURE SHOCK Can't Change History by Thierry Nguyen RADIATION SAFET Y ARMOR HEALTH ay the word \"SKYNET\" to most people and you'll probably get either a blank stare or a sign of recognition as they recall the evil computer that altered history in the Terminator movies. Say it to sci-fi fans, and they may talk about SKYNET being one of the more maniacal Als to be introduced in the sci-fi genre, even though it never makes an appearance. But say that word to an action gamer and you you're likely to hcar complaints about game design and mechanics. A while ago, Bethesda brought us the sleeper Doom-clone, TERMINATOR: FUTURE SHOCK. The only pre-QUAKE game that featured a true 3D engine, FUTURE SHOCK was mostly overlooked when DUKE NUKEM 3D took the market by storm. SKYNET was originally planned as a simple multiplayer patch for FUTURE SHOCK, but it grew to become a fullfledged mission-pack. Now it's finally arrived, but gamers hoping for a killer gaming experience will cliscover that this was one \"patch\" that was released way too early. HASTA LA VISTA, BABY SKYNET, originally planned as a multiplayer patch to FUTURE SHOCK, is a stand-alone game. It does offer SVGA graphics and multiplay, but is short on missions and full of bugs. sion is multistaged (i.e., enter the base, find the nuke, then run like hell out of the base and into your jeep), but still, eight is a small number. Some missions end with very nice looking cut-scenes, and you are given an MV briefing (with the usual bacl acting) in between every mission. look different from each other, rather than being the exact same character in differcnt color schemes. Despite its many weaknesses, the Xngine does have a few good features. Water is modeled more accurately than in other games, rendered as a clear liquid rather than a sheet of solid color. You can also enter every building in the ruins of Los Angeles, which are all realistically detailed (a bookstore has book shelves and a disco club las a dance floor).

"REVIEW  SKYNET ACTION Terminate The Bugs thing is red and the motion tracker has a sinaller range. But, hey, how often do you get the chance to play the Terminator? Too bad this unique point of view wasn't used in the single-player game. I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP! The Xngine used in SKYNET looks like it needs some major polishing. While the engine is true 3D, the levels look more like the 2D design in DUKE NUKEM 3D. The s mentioned, the inclines are the cause of most of SkyNET's bugs. Bethesda put in a model that calculates falling damage based on height. But this model was flawed to the point that small, one-foot rises on a hill hurt as much as a 10-story drop. Also, you can climb only to a certain point on these inclines, which wouldn't be so bad except that enemy robots can go farther. How did they get up there when I couldn't? In the first mission, there is a building next to a hill. Squeeze yourself in between the two and you will die instantly. Why? Because you are technically falling, but the building is in your way. When you finally touch the ground, the game thinks you've been falling the whole time and kills you on the spot. One interesting bug is that SVGA doesn't work in some cases. When I used a small TSR to install the VESA 2.0 standard, SKYNET wouldn't go to SVGA. I had to turn off this utility and use my barebones VESA 1.2 config to get SVGA. SciTech Display Doctor 5.3 should give you SVGA, but I find that it slows down my performance. Also, gamers have complained online about having problems getting SVGA working on their Matrox boards. ated with finding some one in a large level, SKYNET gives you a device called the motion sensor, Just arm and point it, and anything moving will show up as a blip on your screen very nice innovation from Bethesda for hunting down clusive deathmatch buddies Perhaps the coolest multiplayer feature of all though, is the ability to play as a 'Terminator Playing as the Terminator gives you infrared vision and a built-in motion sensor (so you can keep a  l t all times).

"SKYNET. REVIEW ACTION JUDGMENT DAY SKYNET held great promise. It does complement FUTURE SHOCK (giving FS the SVGA option) and supplies the multiplayer option that was promised in S.

"**** REVIEW  MARATHON INFINITY NOTI) DIFFICULTY LEVEL ERMEDIATE Phorget Me Not MARATHON INFINITY Brings Bungie's Mac Shooter To A Classy End by Jeff Green HIV GUN ENVY MARATHON INFINITY's new rapid-fire Flechette gun will mow down your enemies with deadly precision, but the rocket launcher foregoes precision for punch. eing a Mac gamer can really suck sometimes. Just ask me. Here I am, the sole Mac gamer at the CGW office, forced to listen to my fellow editors prattle on endlessly about such hoo-hah as the latest QUAKE hack or the new 5,000 level DUKE add-on, while I'm still gratcful just to be able to play Doom on my stinkin' machine. Adding insult to injury are the lots of derision that greet me every time I sing the praises of Bungie's outstanding MARATHON series. The sad truth is that it wouldn't really make a difference if this was the grcatest game since Twister. The answer would still be the same: \"Yeah, but it's just a Mac game!\" Well, rice my boomstick, weisenheimers. For while the MARATHON titles may \"just\" bc Mac games, they still offer a cool combination of intelligence and bloodshed that few shoot-em-ups on any platform can equal. What Bungie does best is combine fast-paced, first-person action with a story that actually is a story. Part Neuromancer, part Aliens, part 2001, Bungie has fashioned a witty, complex space opera around what could have been just another point-and-shoot fest. MARATHON INFINITY, the latest and apparently final game in the series, continues where MARATHON 2 left off with a new scenario called Blood Tides of Lh'owon. Though it doesn't break any new ground, it should offer enough thrills to please longtime fans. evil Phor have unwittingly unleashed and that now threatens to destroy the galaxy. As usual, the primary goal is to kill everything that moves. But each level has its own secondary objective, as well as a distinct look -that makes you want to continuc, just to see what's next. As you attempt to discover what's going on and destroy the Phor, you'll travel all over, from the wide-open moonlit canyons of Lh'owon to the claustrophic, labyrinthine pathways of enemy spacecraft. Last year's MARATHON 2 was a quantum leap over the first game, with better graphics, a better engine, and better levels than the original. Bungic makes no such leap this time—the engine is essentially the same, and there's only one new weapon-and for some gamers, especially those familiar with the stunning immers ion of QUAKE, this will be a letdown. The good news is that this game is actually much tougher than MARATHON 2. Even when playing on Normal difficulty, there are a few levels, like the maddening Acme Station, that will defy you to survive beyond the first few minutes. And is it just me, or are the levels much stingier with ammo, techarges and pattern buffers this time? INFINITY PLUS TWO For many gamers, the biggest reason to buy MARATHON INFINITY is the inclusion of Forge, Bungie's level editor, so you can create your own levels (hence the game's title). The editor is wonderfully easy to use, with a palette-based interface that should be familiar to anyone who's used art programs such as Adobe Photoshop. Also included is Anvil, a super utility that lets you add your own graphics, sounds and physics to any MARATHON 2 or INFINTIY map. Bungie has said that this will be the last of the MARATHON games, and you can't blame them for wanting to move on. Credit them, at least, for taking the time to develop a cool scenario that closes the series out with a bang. It's not QUAKE or DUKE, but if you only have a Mac, this is still the best shoot-em-up around. 99 $123 Price: $34.99 Requirements: Macintosh with 68040 or better processor, 13\" 256-color monitor, System 7 or higher, 6 MB RAM Protection: None # of Players: 1-8 (2 players with each copy) Designer/Publisher: Bungie Software Chicago, IL (312) 563-6200 Reader Service #: 320 LH'OWON SHARKS When the game begins, you find yourself on a distant space station in the Lhowon solar system, where the normally arrogant Al Durandal is freaking out over a mysterious, chaotic force that the APPEAL: MARATHON fans, Mac 3D shooter fans who can't wait for MacQuake.

"***** REVIEW. RISK CD-ROM DIFFICULTY LEVEL A Lot Of Risk, A Lot Gained For Hasbro CLASSICS & PUZZLES by Terry Coleman Toss The Dice WW hile it never sold as many copies as Monopoly, Risk was still popular enough over the past few decades that old Mr. Pennybags himself might have occasionally felt a twinge of jealousy. After all, who wouldn't be tempted to leave even the lavish confines of Boardwalk and Park Place for a chance to visit much less conquerthe mysterious lands of Yakutsk, Madagascar, and Kamchatka? Make no mistake: like its cousin STRATECO, RISK is no wargame, despite the neo-military trappings; yet it certainly has more depth than MONOPOLY, CLUE, or any other classic board game we grew up with. But all the attempts to bring Risk to the computer up to now have been lackluster at best. hampered by middling Al and a lack of good multiplayer options. Luckily, Hasbro learned its lesson, because now in some ways, Risk even outshines MONOPOLY CD-ROM on the computer. addition of new Free Test Drive maps -with more oddsounding territorial hile I would heartily recommend Risk names--for America, CD-ROM to anyone, some Risk purists Europe, Asia, and the may be nonetheless unsure about the world is the perfect way prospect of ULTIMATE Risk.

CLASSIC RISK is the game we grew up with, complete with unpronounceable territories except the \"armies\" are now called \"battalions.\" The Com RISK GROWS UP But the best toys are to be found in the aptly named ULTIMATE RISK.

"REVIEW  RISK CD-ROM Breaking Down The Battlefield CLASSICS & PUZZLES unlike territory cards or mission cards, are retained and reused from one turn to the next; it's better to think of them as options rather than cards per se. The best part of ULTIMATE Risk is that all of these enhanced tactical options merely add to gameplay, not complexity; the computer handles all the various combat modifiers. In ULTIMATE Risk, each time you battle for a territory, you are greeted with a tactical display similar to this one, where there is a lot more going on than a succession of 3D models in military parade dress. (The terrain here is normal, but the tactical display will reflect mountains, heavy forests, etc., as applicable.) Troop strengths in this battle are almost identical, but Green's 29 battalions lack the charisma of the famous General Ali Pasha, who leads Purple's 32 battalions. Green is in desperate straits over most of the board and launches an all-out attack with a frontal assault card. Purple would like to conduct a fighting withdrawal, but decides against it, as Pasha would lose effectiveness should he abandon the Purple capital to the enemy (note the capital symbol next to the general in the display). Thus, Pasha plays an attack card of his own and meets the enemy charge in the center. Unfortunately for Purple, the scales of fate (in the center of the display) tip dramatically toward Green. Note how the display shows Green's forces enveloping those of Purple, forcing their retreat, and capturing the Purple capital. Worse, the brave Ali Pasha is struck down! Alternatively, Purple could have tried defending one flank or the other, with a smaller chance of losing his general. And all is not lost in any case, as Purple may simply trade three of his battalions received as reinforcements next turn in for another general-provided he can afford it, given his worsened strategic situation. Keep in mind that tactical cards, E|} more human field marshals join in the fun, and there are several \"historical\" scenarios to keep things lively for many campaigns to come. Is there anything to dislike? The documentation is minimal, but this is one game where an online manual works well.

WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT? The major buzz with FPSFB '97 is that it's now a native Windows 95 product. The transition is seamless, provided your system files are up-to-date. The game has a very clean graphic look, and player numbers finally adorn the jerseys. The player movement is better than ever, and there are far fewer phantom tackles than in past releases. Sierra's league-leading Camera Angle Management System (CAMS) is back, with its infinitely flexible views of on-field action. The '97 version has also added team-specific profiles and game plans, making coaching chores easier, but more about that later. While the graphics are mostly fine, a few design zits do manage to blemish the game's good looks. First, if you want the game to run in full screen, you'll have to set your Control Panel to 640x480. At 800x600 an annoying black border surrounds the field. On offense, receivers rarely seem to catch balls in stride. Even in practice mode with no defenders on the field, wide outs often stop their fly pattems and wait for the rock to arrive. And, in a shortcoming that's unfortunately universal among football sims, FPSF'97's stadiums are totally vanilla. When will pigskin gamers be treated to authentic renditions of classic NFL venues such as Cleveland's Dog Pound and Chicago's Soldier Field? Are baseball gamers the only ones destined to enjoy the graphic flavor of their favorite sports shrines? COACH WITH EASE FPSF '97's move to the Windows 95 platform has made coaching chores decidedly easier with a new 32-bit play editor using pull-down menus and a Quick Plan feature that speeds up creation of game plans. The new edition also offers team-specific coaching profiles and game plans. The game's innovative new CGW MARCH 1997 "

Beassured that Papyrus/Sierra's NASCAR RACING 2 continues down that near legendary road of glory. Like INDYCAR II, NASCAR2 is a sequel to what was already an outstanding game.

"NASCAR RACING 2. REVIEW Right on Track SPORTS ws 130 130 130 131 131 131 RR WATKINS GLEN CRUMPLED HOODS That speed and gear overlay on the left may be switched on or off in-game. So can those tire temps, but they're far more valuable, especially on ovals. ne of the best things about NASCAR 2 is that the tracks have been significantly altered and improved over the original version. For starters, the new game ships with sixteen circuits. That's seven more than the original, and although licensing issues still block the inclusion of the storied Daytona Speedway, there's more than enough variety (including both the Watkins Glen and Sears Point road courses) to keep anyone occupied for a long time. Speaking of Watkins Glen, there is perhaps no better spot to check out the big changes Papyrus has furnished this time around. When you first hit the track, you'll notice a furious attention to detail-buildings, towers, clouds, distant farms and even the individual leaves on a tree. There's far more shading too, on objects like grandstand supports, foliage, signage, and more. Even track texture, which has been there all along, has | been improved so it really does simulate blurred pavement. Virtually everything in the game has a newfound clarity with | a lot less \"sparkde,\" from the rear bumper of that far less angular and jagged car ahead to yon silo on the horizon. Interestingly, Papyrus has managed to package all this stuff with an improved frame rate, one that had me running highresolution, full-field races at the Glen with all but grass detail cranked wide open. And the good news doesn't end with hot graphics. NASCAR 2 offers a schedule brimming with character-laden tracks, While narrowing the gap between the frustratingly difficult and the apathetically easy. At the Glen for instance, that horrid Inner Loop has been widened and marginally \"de-Kinked,\" as a result claiming far fewer victims than in the past. At Phoenix, the desert demons have been completely exorcised and it's suddenly become a great track. Just try blasting out of the pit exit then hurtling through its dog-legged back straight-a veritable impossibility in the past-and you'll see what I mean. But while traditionally tough courses are less intimidating, the mundane \"easy\" tracks have a new edge that make them that much more compelling. Wide multi-grooved NASCAR 1 courses like Michigan and Talladega for example are still wide but far less grooved in NASCAR 2, with an apron and low line that can be positively hellacious. Stand on it and turn left? Hardly. Darlington too has seen a ton of refurbishing, and now you've got a no-banked low line that transforms abruptly to a high-banked high line, something that's sure to keep racers honest and up near the wall. replay mode that now gives current position and stats throughout and the usual superb crash effects and break-apart cars, NASCAR Racing 2 is one hell of a ride. What about the two dozen drivers out there with you? Well, for the most part, they're up to Papyrus' high Al standards. but some of what was broken back in NASCAR I hasn't been fixed in the sequel. This means it's entirely possible to have a full train lined up behind you following a spin, the poor numbskulls getting diagonal and knowing not where to go. It also means they may refuse to recognize your existence if you've done something stupid, like get wobbly along the apron. Should a pilcup occur, there's a bevy of crash sounds that vary depending on the severity of the incident. There's also a nice ka-chunk when shifting, improved wheelspin noise, and most importantly, the talking crew chief/spotter. Ah yes, a guy who'll undoubtedly save your bacon time and time again. He'll guide you through traffic (\"Car high! Still there! Clear!\"), around accident scenes (\"Watch that crash straight ahead. Stay lowl\") apprise you of current status (Okay, those three cars ahead are for position.\") and both berate (\"What a bonchead move!\"), or congratulate (\"You just won yourself a race. Dinner's on me.\"). He can be adjusted or turned off, but since he'll do everything for you but save your current race (where did that feature go?), he's better left on. NASCAR 2 ships with support for 3D accelerator boards based on the Rendition chip, and is ready for 32-player Net racing via T.E.N. when that system is up and running later this year. When you factor in the typically stunning Papyrus APPEAL: Anyone with an appreciation of what it takes to modify and race stock cars. NASCAR Racing vets looking for more excitement and realism. PROS: Graphic detail and clarity that blows away any other Papyrus game to date. Exceptional car model and more sensible track depiction. Less quirks than the original and a second pair of eyes to help you through. CONS: Basically wonderful Al goes wacko under unusual circumstances. No save race feature. **** RATEDI MARCH 1997 CGW "

Wien landing, if you touch down too hard or while improperly aligned, your gear may collapse or it may only bend, remaining usable but frozen in place, for the durafion of the mission. Shock waves from explosions are also well represented. If an enemy Su-25 attacking your base drops a bomb a short distance away, your plane might be shoved to one side by the blast, in addition to any structural and systems damage it sustains.

A wide assortment of ordnance types is available for each mission, from cluster bombs to Maverick missiles.

"REVIEW  JETFIGHTER III Aira killed by Shr16 SIMULATION/SPACE This sim features a relaxed, but not totally unrealistic, light model. There are some quirks—the ailerons are effective in full stalls, and rudders work at high speeds. Also, there seems to be little cliscemable difference in flight dynamics between the F-22N and 1/18 Homet-certainly not the case in real life. Still, while the hard-core crowd may scoff, the flight model is basically satisfying, ulike arcadish games like SILENT THUNDER There are many nice touches, such as turbulence bumps and concussion shocks when flak explodes nearby: The best effect, howerer, is the game's tangible sense of vclocity, whether you're screaming down the carrier deckor zipping 200 feet above the landscape. l'ew flight sims can match the realistic, gut-level fecling of speed like JB3.

Cirulis t's been more than three years since I reviewed MASTER OF ORION, a game that revived the entire genre of spaceploitation games almost by itself and estab lished the designers as the flavor of the half-decade in strategy gaming. Now, after three name changes and six-odd months of misscd release dates, the sequel SF gamers have been sweating in their spacesuits for is finally here! MASTER OF ORION 2: BATTLE AT ANTARES is a big game with a big name, but does it measure up to all the long-in-waiting expectatious?

The basic idea is unchanged; the 4Xs are still important to win the game you have to explore, eXpand, eXploit and exterminate your way to a controlling interest in the Galaxy..or at least your neighborhood of 40-vxll stars and their surrounding planets. As far as background for this game, MOO2 is more like a remake than a sequel. | The mysterious and bountiful Orion is still here, its devastating technological treasures still protected by the Uber-Dreadnought known only as The Guardian. But now, taking out this city-sized battleship to get a tech edge on your fellow empires is not the only subplot. It seems that the old enemies of the Orions, the pesky Antarans, are still alive in hyperspace somewhere, and they pop out from time to time to harass the remaining races of the galaxy.

"***** REVIEW  RED ALERT DIFFICULTY LEVEL Red War II & STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Westwood Sheds Real-Time Light On The War That Might Have Been by Martin E. Cirulis ack story is usually an after thought in strategy games. With one or two notable exceptions, the premise is usually just enough to rationalize going there and killing that. So, it was a real switch when Westwood's refinement of real-time wargaming, COMMAND & CONQUER, offered us a story so good that it enticed you to play just to see the next cut-scene. The matcrial was strong enough that it even prompted a prequel. whatever is pseudo-science for us is a realily in this game, and it is nicely reflected in both unit technology and storyline. Here we have 'Tesla's work going into giant coils that fry Allied units at long range and Einstein himself is a prize of war. Even the dark and terrible Stalin is a prominent figure in the storyline, and his frightening grin and gallows humor will haunt you in just about every cut-scene on the Russian side. RA picks up a lot of points on style alone Whether you play Allies or Soviets, the basic action is much the same as in time to think. While it is possible to adjust the game speed up to above-average C&C time, the increased size of the onscreen playfield still allows for more realistic maneuvers and planning. Also, you can now give large groups movement orders and force them to remain in their original formation. This alone practically doubles the tactical value of the game. The unit Al is also strong on defense, and units tend to react very well to intrusions into their zone of control, allowing you to rely on them defensively. And speaking of Als, the computer players in RA may not be anything to write home about, but they have learned a few nasty tricks. In general, any lack of wit is well compensated by numbers, and enemy harassment attacks are now much stronger and tend to come from two directions simultaneously. The only real disappointment here is that your opponent is still usually as blithely unaware of being blasted from long range as he was in C&C. Pathfinding Al is still sometimes questionable, and players should avoid long-clistance movement commands. RED ALERT 100 UNCLE JOE The cut-scenes, acting and storyline of RED ALERT are first rate, as you meet Einstein, encounter strange science fiction and get briefed by the evil Josef Stalin.

(714) 833-8710 Reader Service #: 344 RED ALERT is a real-time strategy game that takes us into the past of C&C«realily,\" where your job is to fight an alternate World War II with the Western Allies facing off against the Soviet Union for control of Europe. Whatever the result, this world will be the one that greets the arrival of Tibcrium and the Chaos we battled in C&C. C&C; you build bases, harvest \"minerals,\" build structures and units, and move through the plot by completing one combat scenario after another. The biggest change for RA is the switch to true SVGA graphics. While this is a purely cosmetic thing for most wargames, here it has two important effects on gameplay. First, the increase in resolution translates into smaller and clearer graphics, effectively cloubling the viewable area of the playing arena. Second-for those who complained that C&C was only about mouseclicking--the SVCA graphics have slowed the action clown, allowing more IRON CURTAINS AND FORTRESS EUROPA C&C fans looking for new toys won't be disappointed. The new units for the Soviets range from guard dogs that can tear a sollier to shreds in a second (but die very easily themselves) to hunter-killer subs and ground attack fighters. Even their standard artillery piece is the deadly and exotic V2. The Allies have less flash to their new weapons, but there are interesting additions to the usual tanks and machine-gun jeeps. The Western answer to the Russian sub fleet is a whole set of naval vessels: the gumboat, the destroyer and even a heavy cruiser. The Allies can also produce medics who automatically EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN The world of RA seems to be drawn from the journal of non-reproducible restinis results; from the Philadelphia Experiment to Tesla's nuttiest purported breakthrough CGW MARCH 1997 "


"RED ALERT  REVIEW heal any soldiers they come in contact with. STRATEGYZWARGAMES Apart from the new units, the culscenes and music are both at least equal to the very high quality mark set in C&C and the introduction alone is one of the hipper things to be found on a CD-ROM these days. Both storylines are involving and actually quite graphically pleasing from the get go, especially for the Allies. There are some scenes that should be kept out of the hands of kids-unless you think Hannibal Lector is a fine role model. The acting is good by computer game standards (though Einstein is creadful and Stalin isn't quite spooky enough), BETTER RED THAN DEAD In this alternate world history, the Soviets are especially nasty, and it's a treat seeing the imaginary history brimming with \"what if\" technology-including the electrical fury of the Tesla coils. of C&C, including the birth of the Clobal Defense Initiative, being fleshed NEW WORLD ORDER? There are a couple of other flaws that out. My only complaint about RED ALERT is may aggravate some players. Undying The scenarios themselves are tough, that some aspects look much better than DOS aficionados will feel cheated by the being much better designed than those in others. Sometimes it feels like you are buggy and inadequate DOS version of C&C, and they are meshed more tightly playing with the roots of a much more this game, which doesn't play in SVCA. to the storyline. There is still the mix of ambitious design that was tied up quickly The other small problem is the choice of base battles versus quests, where you must about halfway through.

LORDS OF THE REALM II, from Sicrra's Impressions, demonstrates that you don't need flying cragons or Elven wizards to make the Middle Ages interesting and fun. Some good old-fashioned warmongering will do nicely, thank you. As a run-of-the mill European nobleman circa 1200 A.D., you find that you cannot in good conscience allow the recently vacated throne to go unclaimed. That selfsame conscience, of course, also precludes your recognizing the pedigree of the other pretenders to the throne. Conflict is inevitable and won't be resolved until one of you has united the kingcloi11, Imost likely under a unail-COVered boot. There are numerous thrones to vie for, as the game provides maps for England. Scotland, France, and Germany, as well as for the Crusades and for a number of Oriental locales. A few generic maps are also included, although I found that the game lost much of its atmosphere when not set in a particular locale.

"REVIEW AGE OF SAIL Age Of Sail vs. Wooden Ships & Iron Men STRATEGYZ WARGAMES can be fixed in patches-version 1.02 has already been released but I think they show that this title was hurried to market in time for Christmas shoppers. The campaign game has similarly rough edges, the text explaining the battle does not always appear, and the red X showing the battle's location is sometimes in the middle of a land mass. These peculiarities have little bearing on play; more significant is the apparent lack of thorough play testing. If you're successful, you eventually get promoted to a ship of the line and then spend the rest of your career trying (and failing) to catch smaller craft that know better than to engage. After ten or a dozen of these futile cfforts, retirement begins to look appealing he most obvious difference between AGE OF SAIL and WOODEN SHIPS & IRON Men is that AOS is real-time and WS&IM is turn-based. Real-time for ships, planes, etc., works best when the player has a single point of view. If, in a flight sim, you also had to fly your wingman's plane, you'd go crazy jumping back and forth. Thus, In AOS, the emphasis (75 of the scenarios) is on single-ship action. In battles with multiple ships, however, you are forced to jump around, and the interface begins to get awkward. Take navigation commands, for example. There are only two: Turn Right 45 and Tur Left 45... If you want to make a 135. turn, you click the button 3 times the ship will \"remember\" the commands and perform them even if you jump to another ship. If, however, you want to turn 45. left (say, to bring guns to bear) and then turn 45 right to resume the former course), you can't just click the buttons in that order, since the right tum button also serves as the cancel command for any left turn orders (and vice versa). You have to order the left turn, wait several minutes for it to complete, then order the right turn. As long as this situation occurs on only one ship at a time, it's not hard to command a squadron of five or six ships. Things are happening slowly, remember? In large battles (and there are 11 of these) there are usually four to six squadrons and you can give commands to an entire squadron. So it is possible to manage dozens of ships in real-time and only go a little crazy. Squadron commands are tricky, however, since different things happen depending on which ship you have selected when you give the order. And when your squadron gets out of a neat line of battle, it becomes impossibly confusing, because all ships perform the order no matter where they are on the map. AOS and WS&IM do share some qualities. They each have 8 points (directions) of sailing, 5 levels of crew competency, and omit land, shallow water, and anchoring (although AOS allows ships to remain motionless, even in a strong breeze!). Each game includes scenario editors but not ship editors, and both have \"campaigns that are little more than random scenario generators. In AOS' scenario editor, you choose from 2000+ ships listed alphabetically (no dates given); in WS&IM, you choose ships by period, by country, and by class and can rename them. They differ most dramatically in that WS&IM has a more realistic sailing model, with drift and tacking maneuvers: AOS' model lacks momentum and drift and all maneuvers are combinations of 45-degree turns. In both games, crew quality affects the accuracy of cannon fire; but AOS crew level also affects the rate of fire (score one for real-time!). WS&IM crew quality affects strength in melee; in AOS crew size affects strength, but crew quality does affect willingness to surrender. WS&IM is limited to 25 ships per battle, while the AOS limit is unknown (but is at least 70 ships). The bottom line for now is that the TRADITION OF VICTORY Another problem with the game is that a crew of the poorest quality will surrender automatically when damage or casualties reach some arbitrary threshold, even if you are winning the battle! Really bad crews are rare in scenarios, but in a campaign, you almost always get a ship with a poor crew at some point. Although I've done a lot of fault finding, there are things to like about AOS, particularly the graphics, the absence of program crashes, and the enormous ship library. AOS does capture some of the flavor of the period, and it is a game with lots of potential. Many of its problems (Al and otherwise) could be fixed with patches. TalonSoft has shown with its BATTLECROUND line that the design team improves steadily from one game to the next in a series, l'or those of us who enjoy real-time sailing, we hope they'll do the same with AGE OF SAILE MITGLIM 10. CREENCHEDONDASEGIR 320 SINO APPEAL: Old sailors, officer trainees, and powder monkeys. PROS: Beautiful graphics, huge number of scenarios, enormous ship library. CONS: Weak AI, slightly awkward interface, lack of network play. THIS IS MUTINY AGE OF SAIL (left) and WS&IM (right) appear very similar here, and we were winning in both battles. But unlike WS&M-where you decide how long to fight-a couple of hull hits and our poor crew forced us to surrender in AOS, even though we were winning! CGW MARCH 1997 "

Tako The Anthon BI DOL Mail Beri Qeplay All Song Com Heb STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Doeszes OOSOLRICH Udine 9.2013 September 141842 Conden kaverne Phare.Dhere are 25 scenarios, of which 18 deal with September 17, 1862. Four represent the entire battle-all day, all locations. One is historical and three are \"What if?\" scenarios. Five scenarios represent \"half battles\" with half the map and about half as many turns. Three of these are the northern half (one historical and two \"What if?\" scenarios) and two represent the southern half (one historical and one, slightly longer that asks \"What if Burnside had attacked sooner?\") The other nine scenarios all portray pieces of the action, seven of them historical. The names-Carnage in the Cornfield, Bloody Lane, Burnside's Bridge-will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has read about the battles or walked the battlefields. They range in length from 5 turns to 23 turns (about half the full battle), with four of them in the 8to 12-turn range, a good amount to play in one sitting. The battles in the north center on Miller's farm and cornfield, an open area surrounded by woods on three sides. Farther south there are fewer trees, but the rolling hills provide cover, and there runs the sunken road known as \"Bloody Lane.\" To the far south, the Confederate forces around the town of Sharpsburg face Burnside's Corps across Antietam Creek, the banks heavily wooded but the heights on either side relatively open. In the center is the bridge where Burnside struggled for hours to force a crossing, but close by are the fords where his troops could have crossed easily. PLUG THAT GAP! This 640 x 480 screen shows Fox Gap from South Mountain. The rebels (on the left) take advantage of stone walls and uphill positons. Of the remaining seven scenarios, six cover the Battle of South Mountain, which occurred three days before Antietam. Three of these portray the entire day's fighting (two are what ifs) and three show the key actions in short 10-turn scenarios. The map has much higher hills and is mostly wooded, but many roads and trails make flanking maneuvers possible. The Rebels are always outnumbered but have the advantage of good defensive terrain and an uphill position. These are good scenarios to begin with as they have low unit density. The last Scenario is a skirmish on the evening before the big event. It is just six turns, with relatively low unit density and good balance. d ios seems even. A few seem to favor the Union if you avoid the historical mistakes, but you'd expect that with any hallway ecent simulation. Of course, if you're willing to sacrifice a bit of realism, you can adjust the balance in any scenario by using the \"Advantage\" slider to give one side or the other a permanent die roll modifier in combat.

"TERRY COLEMAN STRATEGYZWARGAMES BRIEFINGS Landry's Novastar Games has cranked out numerous scenario disks for TANKS, STEEL PANTHERS, and other popular wargames, but we'll always remember him for his early SSI designs with Chuck Kroegel, particularly the classic BATTLES OF NAPOLEON. X-Com: APOCALYPSE by MicroProse will evidently not be real-time! The design team decided that it was historical articles, previews, and new scenarios for SSG products. In other SSG news, THE LAST BLITZKRIEG, Roger Keating/lan Trout's epic Battle of the Bulge treatment featuring some exciting new combat mechanics, is finally scheduled to ship this Spring. And Broderbund looks to knock one out of the park by distributing SSG'S WARLORDS III. Finally, SSG's long-awaited REACH FOR THE STARS II should challenge MOO II's galactic dominance sometime this summer when it will be distributed by Microsoft.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY Red Alert Alternate History 101 by Martin E. Cirulis kay class, listen tip. You want to get out of CDI Academy, then you've got to know your history. Military history, that is. Today we're going to take a look at the birth of the Global Defense Initiative in the fires of World War 11 not the weird, alternate war where that creepy geek who wrote Mien Kampf managed to take control of our German allies and threaten the entire world. No, today we're going to stick to real life and study the Allied response to Josef Stalin's aggression. The monster may be dead, but there are still many lessons to be learned from his corpse. First, let's look at the weapon systems your brave predecessors had to work with and how they used them to push back the rabid Russian Bear. GENERAL TACTICS Compared to the uphill fight the Allies had in terms of firepower and technology, the CDI's war against NOD is a cakewalk. Let's imagine for a moment that you were an Allied commander. The Allied powers suffered most from a lack of sheer destructive capability compared to their Soviet counterparts. With no real answer in mobile hitting power to cither the Soviet heavy or mammoth tanks, except for naval bombardment, and with very low unit-survivability when assaulting bases protected by Tesla coils, your Allied commander had to rely on numbers and STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW Longbows, working with medium tanks, precise, coordinated are the key to cracking the Russian Bear's back. attacks to carry the battle, while layered defenses kept the Russians naval combat you had to keep your ships Movat bay and bought you the time to build up ing and present the narrowest possible target to your forces. enemy torpedoes.

During inferior armor, money was of supreme importance to any base commander, and you had not only a steady supply of minerals, but also a fast turn-around time for your mining trucks. While the automatic response was to simply buy one or two new mining trucks, congestion at the dumping station itself could severely impair efficiency. The smart commander would establish at least two ore refineries, situated close to different ore patches if possible. As far as defending your base until you were ready to strike, you had to think layered. Between Soviet armor and aircraft, odds were that one line of defense would be ineffective. Against ground forces, a primary line consisting of a pair of turrets Destroyer Flotillas The best bang for your naval buck, and excellent all-around attack/defense units, destroyers survive more than the very expensive cruisers. Though not heavily gunned, their missile racks can bring down air units and also harass enemy ground forces. Destroyers should be employed carefully in flotillas of at least three, especially when hunting subs. Where possible, use them to interdict ore sites well behind enemy lines. CGW MARCH 1997 "

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY War Wind Destroy Your Enemies And Rule Yavaun As Tha'Roon Or Obblinox by Martin E. Cirulis n WAR WIND, SSI brings us a real-time wargame set on Yavaum, a world in political turmoil, where four distinct alicn races struggle against cach other for dominance of the planet. Unlike the WARCRAFT series, where Orc and human units are virtually identical, the four races of Yavaun have analogous but distinct units types and specific racial advantages. This means there are important strategic and tactical strengths and weaknesses for each race that will affect your style of play. In this part of the strategy guide, we'll be looking at two of the stronger races in WAR WIND, namely the physically weak but technologically superior | Tha'Roon, and the walking tanks, the Obblinox. The strategies in this article are intended for Tha'Roon Ministers and Obblinox War Generals. Eaggra and Shama'll commanders can turn their web browsers to www.zdnet.com/gaming for strategies for their own forces. tles, sacrifice one or two hardy units by placing them farther alcad to pin large groups of enemy units in melce while the rest of your force blazes away from a distance. The Tha'Roon The former masters of Yavaun are quick in the lab but less adept at managing construction tasks and open warfare, jobs previously handled by their former slaves, the Eaggra and the Obblinox, respectively. In general, Tha'Roon should research their technologies as carly and as quickly as possible. Since cyberctic upgrades cost less for the 'Tha'Roon than any of the other races, players should outfit their warriors and scouts with new parts, specifically strength and resilience packages, to compensate for the Tha'Roon's subpar melee skills. As far as combat tactics themselves, the Tha'Roon are very powerful in ranged combat and should avoid melee with opponents as much as possible, especially the Shama'Li. In large batThe Rover These touring knights are the most expensive mercenary unit in the game, yet they don't deliver much damage for your dollar. They are best used as an early boost to your defenses or as fast scouts for scanning the countryside and harassing enemy workers. Unless you are incredibly rich or desperate, avoid the mover. FIRE AWAY The Tha'Roon have, by far, the best ranged units in the game. Attack from afar as often as possible, because they will lose in hand-to-hand combat. This close-up shows how the Tha'Roon can chew up an Obblinox before it even reaches them. before they are destroyed, as they are too valuable to waste on a failed attack. The Executioner This is your basic military unit. Outfit with the strength and resilience upgrades and try to have your units cithier firing at range or screening even more valuable ranged units. The Destroyer These command units should be outfitted with a full array of upgrades (though they can probably do without the stealth module unless you have a specific subtle plan in mind). Use them in conjunction with three executioners to maximize their effect. Group those four in a truck or a cruiser for a fine assault group. Pull these units back for repair The Rogue Give these units the stealth and speed upgrades and use them in groups to get close to an enemy base. Once there launch surprise attacks against specific targets simultaneously with your main assault elsewhere. If it looks like a superior number of enemy units is about to engage them, pull back quickly and hide, as rogues are very poor hand-to-hand combalants. Produce large numbers of them if you have the money, so that you can build the very valuable assassin and jump troop units. LEAPIN' LIZARDS The Tha'Roon are physically weak but technologically superior. Upgrade your Tha'Roon troops early and often. CGW MARCH 1997 "


"GAMER'S EDGE 23 The Assassin 'This is the most powerful ranged unit in the game and should be outfitted accordingly. With a stealth modification, it can lead a group of rogues deep into enemy territory and terminale specific, powerful enemy units before the chemy can react. With full upgrades, players can make the decision to use them as is or upgrade them to jump troops, which offer less ranged firepower in return for a massive mobility advantage, a decision which should be based upon the tactical needs of the moment TOWN THA'ROON Here is a typical Tha'Roon settlement. If you want to keep it alive, upgrade your troops immediately. Tha'Roon start out weak, but with technological upgrades, they approach physical parity with other races. ROCKET RANGING Upgrading to the jump troop means you lose the assassin's superior ranged capabilities, but you gain mobility and limited flight. These capabilities are useful for dropping behind enemy lines or picking up hard-to-reach special items. them out quickly so they can auto-heal. A good trick to use on many maps is to use a jump trooper to collect goodies that are set aside on islands or guarded by hostile animal life. Jump Troops These ultimate fastattack units are rare, and most times you will be lucky if you can get three of them into the air at once (a task that would require you to have 12 active rogues at the same time), but if you can do that, then no enemy unit or building is safe. Use their limited Night capability to bypass walls and enemy front-line defenders to wreak havoc in your opponent's backfield. In combat, keep a close cyc on them, and when they are in danger, pull the time and money, it may be worth it to produce the four psychics and the psionic just to get your hands on the Command Voice spell. Once researched by a psionic, it can be learned by your lesser mages without trouble, and casting five of these spells can turn a massed enemy assault into a rout. You could end up with a whole new army at your disposal. Psychics and Psionics Tha'Roon magic users are the weakest of all the four races and aren't really worth the cost of creating them. If you have The Obblinox These proud warriors of Yavaun are the masters of the battlefield, but they also liave the most demanding infrastructure needs of all the races. Since an Obblinox mead ball supports only three units, you will need lots of space to support your forces, so keep this in mind when choosing village sites and placing buildings. In general. your units are most powerful in close melec, so when combat occurs, make sure you force your units to engage the enemy in melee instead of letting them fire from afar, as they will tend to do. Most Obblinox units pack ammor, so never be afraid to go in and slug it out with a slightly superior force; unless you are oulnumbered badly, you will probably give far more than you get. Though your tech research costs are almost double that of the Tha'Roon, equipping your units with speed, strength and resilience can make your forces truly frightening Units Bikers While Obblinox mercenaries can hit a little harder and cost a little less than their Tha'Roon counterparts, they aren't much more useful and should be employed seriously only during the carly stages of a game. They can also be used to pursue fleeing units or keep tabs on chemy positions. Later on they can make a useful screen for a larger attack, as they will attract most of the enemy units' attentions while you move in for the kill with more expensive and useful soldiers. Agents and Spies The Obblinox are not a subtle A race, and this shows in their clandestine units. While spies have hitting power equal to that of the soldiers of other races, and can be effective sncak attackers when coupled with stealth cybernetics, they are not durable enough to justify the cost of their production. Wien you take into account that you must create four of the terribly inadeOBSTINATE OBBLINOX The elephantine Obblinox were once the soldiers of the Tha'Roon but are now applying their military might to rebellion.

When deploying in a straight-up attack, truckloads of veterans should be accompanied by a cruiser filled to bursting with captains, who should then strike as a group into the strongest of the enemy's ranged units. Veterans 'These hardly warriors are the backbone of any Obblinox campaign and should be produced in large numbers. They are fairly cost-effective, and wise commanders will resist the temptation to outfit them with anything more than the resilience and strength cybernetic improvements. Instead, save some of that money for more mead halls and worker recruitment.

Unless the cnemy commander is fast or you're fighting against the Shama'li, victory is almost a certainly. Sorcerers and Warlocks While one would think using magic was less than honorable, a wise Obblinox commander with some money to spare will take advantage of the melee strength of these magical units, as well as the great power of their spells. The bottom line is these are the only mages in the game capable of protecting themselves somewhat, especially if enhanced cybernetically, and this gives them the opportunity to not only deliver spells, but also to survive and retreat until their spell points recharge. Phantasm is largely ineffective, but Blood Boil should be researched so the lesser sorcerors can use it.

Some will work better on the computer (such as sneaking in disguised troops-humans tend to notice when a group of their own workers stands around doing nothing, not responding to commands), while others will reap the best rewards when employed against human limitations. I'm sure more exhaustive works will appear eventually, but in the meantime, these basic tips and tactics should give you a leg up on dealing with the computer opponents, and perhaps give you an edge when fighting over exotic Yavaun with a few friends.

Climb inside the in-bound container, which the bots will then obligingly bring within the walls. The base has two discrete sections. The one you want is to the rear and is reached by a descending ramp. Throw the switch atop the nearby tower to open the door at the bottom. Once inside, you'll find that most switches have an effect close by. (However, don't overlook the express exit.) Use the switch atop the tower near the gate to make your exit.

Don't shy away from the dropoff you'll encounter on the way by conventional means -but an adjacent structure with a tall mast on its roof. Knock down the mast with a blast to its base, and you'll have a launch pad for the long leap to the top of Cyberlync. You'll have to fight your way down through the structure to reach the auxiliary power switch (in a storage room down a short flight of stairs off the lobby). The stairs only take you so far, though. When you see an air-hockey table, blow it up and then blow a hole in the floor beneath it to proceed. The power switch opens the elevator doors on the ground level. The elevator, though, remains at the top of the shaft, so you'll need to make your way back to the top. Riding back down, watch for an otherwise inaccessible arca off the shaft. The two terminals here will open the way to the cellar command center. Access all the terminals there, and then make your way to the roof, where a Hunter/Killer craft will come to pick you up. Don't go back via the elevator; it's now flooded with bots. mission three: Core Wars The infiltration of the Cyberclync Systems HQ is a long and rigorous mission.

Lords of the Realm II eft to their own devices, your bowmen and Lacrossbowmen will frequently make bad decisions or focus too much on only a small portion of the enemy army. This is particularly true in sicge encounters, where your defending archers must be instructed to direct some of their fire toward the enemy bowmen outside the walls. Remember, until the wall is breached, only enemy archers can hurt you. If you direct, say, half of your defenders to fire back at these archers, you may be able to wipe them out, thus leaving the rest of the besieging army at your mercy. !The Sun also rises Removes fog of war !Oh come all ye faithful = laster in recruitment !On a mission from gawd Accelerates building and harvesting !I am the bishop of battle = Win current canbonly1 = 'Turns all the Al empires against you crunch = Completes your current construction task (type at colony screen) einstein Gives you all teclis iseeall = Bestows omniscience menlo Completes current research project moola = Cives you 1000 credits scenario Adventure/Role-Playing Titanic: Adventure Out Of Time TITANIC is a pretty easy adventure game, but you can get tripped up and end on an undesirable path. Rule one, of course, is to save often. Now here are some tips to keep you on course. Finding the Rubaiyat in boiler room 3, coal chute 4 is easy enough. Holding on to it, and not getting killed by Vlad, is another matter. Here's the deal: do not take the book with you after finding it. Instead, simply hide it behind any other control box doors before going back up. After you retrieve the package from Barbicon, you can then go back down and give it to Vlad, and he'll go on his merry way. You can now leave safely with the Rubaiyat. If you fail to get the painting out of the cargo hold early on, fear not. You have another chance. Go see Beatrix, and trade the letter incriminating her husband for Shailagh Hacker's baby. You can then go to Jack Hacker and trade the baby for the painting. If you want to make sure World War II never takes place, don't leave the ship without the painting. CGW MARCH 1997 "


"TIPS! Simulation/Space Sports F-22 Lightning II Having troubles getting through the seemingly impossible Mission 8 in Campaign 4, where you're trying to protect Air Force 1? Even if you take out all the enemies, sometimes AF1 Wanders into a SAM area. Here's our winning technique: First, keep your radar turned off unless damaging him slightly. He'll veer off the flight path and away from the major danger. (Realism sticklers can just target him, but then the allied escorts target you.) Now, take out any enemy planes remaining; try to avoid attacking aircraft also being attacked by the allied escorts.

Unrealistically, your radar makes all allied planes more detectable, not just yours. Launch all your AMRAAMs at enemy planes from maximum range, then quickly land and reload. Next (Republicans will love this one), fire a couple of bullets at Air Force 1, water. Air Force 1 is still in danger from SAMs. You have two options here: Either take out the offending SAM sites (difficult to do when you're not armed with any JDAMs), or simply distract the SAM sites so they fire at you instead of the president.

Just make sure to copy all your former league's SEATTLE SEAHAWKS Classics & Puzzles Risk In games of Ultimate Risk, a simple but effective tactic is to exchange prisoners of war with the same nation that you ally with, especially if that nation is slightly weaker than yours. This allows you to concentrate on eliminating very weak players, or to cut into the lead of any nation significantly ahead of you.

"HALL OF FAME elcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for untold hours. HIGHLIGHTS PIATHLERARIS GEROWEERG Front Page Sports Football Pro Sierra/Dynamix, 1993 ost pigskin games are either realistic stat-based sims dryer than our favorite martini, or so reflex-dependent that your gridiron savvy is rendered totally irrelevant. FRONT PAGE FOOTBALL Changed all that, somehow combining the best of both worlds, and improving up through FPS FOOTBALL '95, winning an unprecedented three CGW Premier awards in the process. From the early 3D perspectives of FPS FOOTBALL PRO, to the rotoscoped play. er animations of FPS FOOTBALL PRO '95, to the rich SVGA Windows 95 color palette of FPS FOOTBALL PRO '97, the series has offered the best game graphics possible-a lesson designer Patrick Cook learned from his involvement with TV Sports Football back in the heyday of Cinemaware on the Amiga. In addition to the appeal of great graphics and flashy replay features, FPS FOOTBALL Pro models the physics of the game on the field: the precise pass patterns run by receivers, the quick release of a Dan Marino pass; the block. ing power of a 300-pound offensive lineman. From the play editor to the updated rosters of NFL players (who actually play like their real-life counterparts) and the career league options, no other game brings its sport to life quite like this one. Some computer football games offer better stat models and some console football games offer better action, but when most gamers think of computer football, they automatically think of FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO. Gettysburg: The Turning Point SSI, 1986 he American Civil War is suddenly a hot topic again, with games such as ROBERT E. LEE and Talon Soft's BATTLEGROUND series combining exquisite graphics and plenty of historical flavor. Still, it took eight long years for GETTYSBURG: THE TURNING POINT to be toppled from its perch as the top Civil War game. And despite the acclaim and strong sales of its descendants, GETTYSBURG still has value as a seminal design that effectively captures the feel of the Civil War's most famous battle. GETTYSBURG was one of the first computer games that seriously challenged board wargames in terms of realism. Chuck Krogel and David Landrey's design placed an emphasis on leadership and the difficulties of command control on the 19th-century battlefield. The rules for melee, double time marches, and limited visibility added to the fun and showed a good under: standing of Civil War tactics. Replayability was helped by random \"what-if\" set-ups and a reasonably challenging Al that would vary tactics from one game to the next-something that many high-powered games today still have trouble achieving. The later games in the series, notably SHILOH, are still worth a look, provided you can get past the dated CGA graphics. But of all the early SSI games, GETTYSBURG has aged the most gracefully.

Video Games? ads for these new 64-bit machines, but only in the sense that they are eagerly taking credit for \"inventing\" a few things that computer games have been working out the bugs on for years. \"Full 360 degree movement!!!!\" they squeal. Yeah, I got that in ULTIMA 8-tell me something else. Despite this, my only real reserva. tion about console technology is the same I have about any limited (i.e. ing off the shelves now. l f Nintendo wants to shuck their For-Rabid-Teens-Only image, then perhaps they should have showcased the SHADOWS OF EMPIRE game instead of dumb ol' Mario jumping for coins. \"Oh sure, it's the same damn game... but now you can jump in ANY direction!!!!\" or \"...but now you can kick off your opponent's head in 3D!!!\" What a bloody waste of the tech. I'll stop considering the cartridge market mainly for kids when side-scrollers and fighting games (even in 3D) die on the racks instead of selling mil. lions t seems every time I make some backhanded grumpy comment about Super Mario and his ilk in this column, CGW is bombarded by, oh, a handful of letters from loyal readers who feel per sonally affronted by my casual disre. gard of their beloved Console Game Machines. The bruised responses usually run along the lines of: how could I ever dismiss such a great boon to gamers as (fill in the name of their console); and obviously I have never played the games because if I had, I would know better; not every body can afford to buy a high-end PC and I should thank the gods that affordable game technology exists; not just kids play them; and so on and so forth...yakity shmackity... blah, blah, blah. First of all, I have no dislike of the technology itself. Console machines have been bringing cheap gaming thrills to the masses since before there really were home computer games, and I have some very fond memories of them. Hell, I still have my Vectrex somewhere. (Well, okay, I really do despise the GameBoy.) If all you really want is a game machine, then certain ly it would not be clever to shell out the two Gs for a basic Pentium rig. You would be much better off spend ing $200 on a 64 bit console. I am mildly annoyed at some of the ( Is it just me, or is it goofy to make a big deal out of DONKEY KONG COUNTRY? be able to add onto your Nintendo 64, which will make it as versatile as a PC, and that may well be true. On the other hand, it's been tried before Anybody remember ColecoVision? The Adam? No, the thing that really feeds my disdain for the console scene are the games themselves. Those endless, huge selling, inane games that nobody seems to notice are exactly the same game with different sprites. Again, save the list of very cool car tridge games you have played. I have probably played most of them. There must be nearly a dozen cartridge games that are equivalent to PC titles in complexity, gameplay and novelty. Hell, until the '97 edition, the car tridge versions of EA's hockey games actually had better gameplay than the PC versions. But c'mon, we are talk ing a handful of games amongst hun dreds, and most quality cartridges get a minuscule amount of coverage compared to the endless clones. Is it just me, or is it goofy to make a big deal out of DONKEY KONG COUNTRY? Do you dedicated cartridge fans notice that for all intents and purposes, it is the same bloody game as the first Mario? You scroll around jumping over and onto things while finding secrets and power-ups. is swinging instead of jumping really that thrilling of a diff? The first DONKEY Kong that started it all 17 years ago was more original than what is leap lobotomized) technology: the fact that at the end of the day, your game machine is just that, a game machine. I have the same problem with these new Web boxes they are hawking now. Sure, it's $200 for a self-contained Web browser. Great! It gets me on the net cheap, but I sure hope I don't ever develop the urge to type. Now I am sure some of you out there are just itching to tell me all the wonderful gadgets you are going to And if I ever need to find a paranoid rationale for my dislikes, I can always look to companies like Sega, Virgin and Sierra, which seem to believe that Auto-Play CD-ROMs = Cartridge Games. I have no problem with PC games leaking over and making cartridge games cooler. 1 have extreme problems with execs who think the two markets are interchangeable and all we need are a few more VIRTUA SQUADS, GRID RUNNERS, OR THEXDERS to get the PC market going. So if you are an adult gamer who is using a game console to supplem ent your aging PC, using it to gain access to interesting games with cutting edge graphics, then relax. When slack up Mario, I don't mean you. On the other hand, if you can't wait for SONIC 3D...go right ahead and get offended.
