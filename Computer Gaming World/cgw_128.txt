"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD being attempted by many publishers. It may make sense from a perspective of efficiency to have a sound specialist, an AI specialist, a connectivity specialist, an interface team, an animation team, and a 3-D team, but it doesn't make sense if these specialists and teams are not integrating throughout the project's timeline. For example, this year we have seen games where publishers expected Al to be injected as the last module and games where publishers expected to add-on modem and network play at the very end of a game's development. This doesn't work. Good artificial opponents and efficient connectivity both require some early input into the design decision process. Neither Al nor connectivity are afterthoughts. At some companies, the low-level programmers and the high-level programmers don't talk to each other. So, is it any wonder that a recompilation of one set of code could set the other side back by months? With the assembly line approach, project leaders have a tendency to try to reuse the code or techniques from other games to jury-rig aspects in a given game. What this means is that the design teams aren't considering the \"best\" way to accomplish something in a game, but are merely re-engineering old code to meet the minimal requirements of a design. Few seem to be asking how to accomplish a game function in the best way to meet a need within a specific game environment or necessary game mechanic. Is it any wonder that some interfaces seem clunky and some musical scores and sound effects seem repetitive? Indeed, after observing this year's deja vu all over again, we have two requests to make of the industry as a whole. First, don't be afraid to try something different. You don't have to copy your competitors to be successful. Second, get some synergy going within your design teams. Cross-pollenization may not only help you build the products more seamlessly, but it may help you build them better.

He is Edward Carnby, and for the third time he is ALONE and IN THE DARK, courtesy of I-Motion On this occasion, some seismic activity near the infamous San Andreas Fault, combined with the mystery of a missing Hollywood film crew, conspire to draw Carnby to the lost town of Slaughter Gulch. The place, of course, turns out to be a ghost-town in the truest sense of the word, and once again it is time for the hero to put more than his share of evil spirits to rest.

Because time keeps marching along even if you don't do anything, and because each session is so short, the whole shebang is over in a little more than half an hour. Just when things are starting to get interesting, in other words, they stop. This is a shame. When other CD-ROM games are boasting several hours of video and more hours on top of that of gameplay, it's hard to think of Voyeur as anything other than slight. The script is as good as a random episode of \"Dallas,\" which is to say competent but about as filling as popcorn. The visuals are blandly ordinary: nothing awful, nothing great. The single most disappointing thing about the game is this air of averageness and timidity that hangs around the project. Modest ambitions are one thing, but for a title that wants to sell itself as pushing the envelope to trade in nothing but conventional characters, conventional images, and conventional events is a matter of imaginative impoverishment. As for the rest of it, I can only shrug. Why make a game called Voyeur and have people in it half-undress and halfkiss and flirt tentatively like teenagers on a first date? Making a game that is a little bit sexy is not a way to please everyonethe prude will still be offended, and the libertine will go away unsatisfied. If you want to make KING'S QUEST, make KING'S QUEST. If you want to make an interactive movie about lusty, nefarious, backstabbing scalawags, drop the towel, fling the bra on the floor, and be done with it.

Domark Software and Interactive Creations have teamed up to develop a multi-player air combat simulator entitled CONFIRMED KILL (a project that was formerly confirmed dead, but has arisen again). A stand-alone version of the game will allow eight players to link via modem, serial and network. Special modem code will also enable three-player games over normal telephone lines. But the big news is that a dedicated high-speed Internet host will also allow over 300 players to duke it out in cyber-airspace at prices far below any other major on-line game. Players will be able to choose from an initial offering of over 50 fighters and 12 bombers rendered with an enhanced version of Domark's SVGA texture-mapped graphics engine. Concerted efforts are under way to woo the \"hard core\" on-line sim fan with superior graphics, realism, and scope, while giving budding sim aces a friendly and fun environment to wage war in. Testing is under way now, and the final product is scheduled to debut in May. WHERE TO GET THEM The actual books carried by pilots are available from numerOus sources, but your best bet, of course, is pilot-supply stores. Many airports have plates for sale, or you can mail order them.
