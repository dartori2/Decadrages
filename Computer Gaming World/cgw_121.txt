"AUGUST 1994, NUMBER 121 From the Publisher COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Publisher Russell Sipe Associate Publisher Jonathan Lane Editor-in-Chief Johnny Wilson You Can't Change That! Editor Cluris Lombardi On-Line Editor Alan Emrich Managing Editor Ken Brown Technical Editor Mike Weksler by Russell Sipe Assistant Editor Terry Coleman Art Director Susan Zurawik Graphic Artist Jack Rodrigues Production Assistant Christine Kloss M.I.S. Manager Gene Allen Advertising Manager Lee J. Uniacke Advertising Sales Coordinator Kathy Garcia Account Representative Marci Yamaguchi Contributing Editors Scorpia (Adventure Games), Evan Brooks (Wargames) t the recent Computer Game Developer's Conference (CGDC), I ran into an old friend. She is one of the top computer game designers in the business. In 1981 she designed the classic CARTELS AND CUTTHROATS for the Apple II. In 1983 she became a regular writer in CGW with her column, Dispatches: Insights From the Strategy Game Design Front. In the same year she designed M.U.L.E. which to this day is still one of the very best computer games ever conceived. In fact, rumor had it that a redesign of the game was in the works. M.U.L.E. was designed by Dani Bunten. She used to be named Dan Bunten. That's right, she made the Big Change. When Dani came to the CGDC in 1993 for the first time as a woman (she had been coming many years as a man), she was prepared to discuss the change. Dani spent several informal sessions with many of her friends and fellow designers describing why this was the right choice for her. In addition to discussing the emotional and chemical aspects of the change, she described how at the conclusion of a 12 month process, an operation would be performed to complete the transformation. A year later, when I ran into her in a hallway at the 1994 CGDC my first words were \"Well, if I remember the schedule right, it must be finished now,\" commenting on the fact that the operation was to have been done. In her distinct Southern drawl she replied, \"Well... I didn't do it.\" \"What? Why not?\" \"Oh...,\" she said pensively, they wanted to put in guns and bombs.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Electronic Arts wanted me to put guns and bombs in M.U.L.E. so I decided not to redo the game.\" Dani saw the look of utter hilarity on my face and realized that we had been having two very different conversations. We both had a good laugh. Changes are all around. Some are harder to understand than others. Dani went through with the operation and is now a woman; I think I'm learning to live with that. But guns and bombs in M.U.L.E.? That's unnatural! That's a change I can't accept. Perhaps Electronic Arts will reconsider. M.U.L.E. is a classic that the new generation of gamers is poorer for not having played. They should get a chance to enjoy it in its original, award-winning form. Come on EA, give us M.U.L.E. with Smithore and Crystite as its creator intended, not with bombs and guns. Contents are copyrighted by Zill-Davis Publishing Co., 1994.

The Media Vision PREMIUM 3D and Pro 3D sound cards use SRS 3D sound technology and are wave-table upgradable using a Korg-based daughter card. The first VESA-compliant audio cards, they come with either a single SCSI-2 or combined Mitsumi, Sony, and Panasonic CD-ROM interfaces. The PREMIUM 3D's digital audio is handled with Media Vision's Jazz 16 chip, which is compatible with SOUND BLASTER and SOUND BLASTER Pro digital audio. FM synthesis is handled with a genuine Yamaha OPL3 chip. The most impressive feature, however, is the SRS Labs 3D audio. SRS (Sound Retrieval System) creates a field of sound from any two speakers that seems to come from every direction, eliminating the old stereo \"sweet spot.\" It can make mono music sound stereophonic and even enhances OSOUND (which places sounds at coordinates relative to the listener). Using SRS with a flight sim gives one a strong sensation of being in an actual cockpit.

"SP The BEAST Handler Photo by Larry Maloney With The Fierce Beauty Of Super VGA Graphics And The Handling Characteristics Of An Ox, NASCAR RACING Will Be One Tough Game To Tame. by Gordon Goble T STARTS WITH A DULL, FLESH-CRAWLING REVERBERATION, AND QUICKLY ESCALATES INTO THUNDER. AS IF TIED TO A CENTRIFUGE, THE UNDULATING SNAKE BEGINS TO CIRCLE WITHIN IIS CONFINES. FASTER AND faster it goes, the segmented serpent tossing aside chunks of itself, only to meld together again and speed ever onward. NASCAR. Brutal and beautiful, it is host to some of the best drivers and arguably the tightest racing in the world, and it's coming soon to a computer near you. It's going to look fantastic. That Papyrus Design Group is the group of people responsible for bringing the world's premier stock car series to the PC is not a complete surprise. \"First in a series from Team Papyrus Racing,\" it said on the packaging of INDYCAR RACING, and we were all left speculating as to the next logical step. This is it, and if pre-season testing is any indication, NASCAR RACING is yet another breakthrough product from a company that's getting awfully used to podium finishes. Although actual wheel-to-wheel competition was impossible at this early stage of the game, it can be safely said that Papyrus has once again raised at least the graphical stakes in this game of dueling racing programs, bettering the hand laid down by INDYCAR RACING. Tomorrow is yesterday faster than you can say \"multiple car collision\" in the sphere of computer game technology, yet the word \"ultimate\" kept coming to mind as the early NASCAR RACING build flashed before my eyes. Imagine a driver's perspective that mixes the depth, texture, and intricacies of INDYCAR RACING with the clarity of WORLD CIRCUIT, and you're getting the picture. Logos, numbers and billboards are legible from distant vantage points, walls and barriers are rich with depth, yet suddenly smooth and flowing. Subtle track texture and crisply outlined cars are certainly easy on the eyes, and that is the high resolution (640 x 480 vs. 320 x 200 for INDYCAR) environment of NASCAR RACING. Papyrus is shooting for a standard-setting screen refresh rate of 30 frames per second, doubling the capacity of INDYCAR. If they even come close to their goal, this officially licensed NASCAR product will surely be one huge gaming step into the future. Yet NASCAR RACING crew chief (and game producer) Adam Levesque is quick to inform us that the obvious striking visual achievements are not the end of the story. Â«We felt that with INDYCAR we had a great game, but we've enhanced that experience...added some flash,\" says Levesque, who with INDYCAR top gun David Kaemmer and Papyrus veteran John Wheeler make up the three man core behind NASCAR. Levesque's \"flash\" is going to delight a grandstand full of digital racing fans. Pleasant appointments will include printer support from within the program (Levesque maintains his desire that race stats reflect real life newspaper and magazine summaries), modem and direct link capabilities (9600 baud and up only), a save game feature (probably accessible from the pit area only-in keeping with the realism that is a Papyrus staple), accelerated time, replays, and a high resolution car paint utility. 20 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  AUGUST 1994 "

"Even Interactresses Get The Blu Behind The Green And Blue Screens On Computer Game Sets by Johnny L. Wilson since most of the mass market is already used to seeing video images on television, they could have a potentially larger audience for their products if they could get the video to look enough like broadcast video. T WILL COME AS NO SURPRISE TO FANS OF THE CINEMA THAT THE URBAN SCENERY PASSING BEHIND THE CAR IN ON THE WATERFRONT, AS MARLON BRANDO'S CHARACTER TOLD HIS BROTHER that he coulda' been a contender,\" wasn't actually passing behind the two actors. Almost everyone knows that the movies use what is called a \"process shot\" to fool you into thinking that the actors are in moving vehicles. In reality, most cockpit shots in air combat movies and most driver close-ups in racing movies prior to the 70s were filmed while a rear projection screen provided the action in the background. In general, this technique has served the film industry well. Since the camera lens is only equivalent to looking at an image with one eye, and both eyes are required to provide accurate depth perception, the camera, and later the viewer, is fooled into thinking that both the foreground scene and background footage are in the same space. Occasionally, however, the background footage would be grainy, slightly out of focus or showed images at unrealistic angles. Almost all of us can remember watching a scene and saying, \"That looks fake!\" With Hollywood's growing involvement in the computer and video gaming industries, it's interesting to see what is happening in the current state of the art of game production. Software publishers have noticed that putting more realistic looking characters on the screen of a computer or video game seems to broaden the appeal of the product to a wider audience. They speculate that, Invisible Hands One of the most common sights wherever video for games is being taped is a blue or green wall, floor and/or screen. Whenever you see one of these in front of a camera, you'll know that one of two film processes is being used: Chromakey or Uluramatte. Both work essentially the same way and have been used for years as Hollywood special effects. The process is relatively simple. If the camera and film are set up to filter out blue or green, anything on the set that is blue or green will be invisible to both camera and viewer. Hence, if you are using the Chromakey technique and dress an actor up so that every square inch of his or her body is covered by a blue or green cloth that is exactly the hue you are filtering out, that actor will be \"invisible\" to the camera. If you happened to see Chevy Chase in The Invisible Man, you know how this technique works. In the movies, this technique is often used to make things disappear or to have objects float around on screen without benefit of \"wires.\" In computer games, this technique is more often used to make things appear rather than disappear. Often, the actors in Activision's RETURN TO ZORK sat or stood in front of a green screen and went through every conversational possibility for their lines. 24 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1994 "


"render all of the environments as detailed 3D rooms. In other games, there was a problem between the computer generated sets, which worked reasonably well with the limited palette of the computer, and the myriad of real-life hues that were captured and leveled out too much by the computer palette. This causes \"hot\" edges on the images of the actors so that the \"alias\" of the image edges look like they are insects buzzing around the actors' shape and causing the images to stand out against the background like a cutout. Sierra tried to solve this problem by using a digital camera to capture backgrounds, then melding those digital backgrounds into the Chromakeyed area of the video for POLICE QUEST: OPEN SEASON. The characters still stood out, but the art team was then able to reduce MAX HEADSHOT An actress in EA's SHOCK Wave is filmed against a blue screen so the \"hot\" edges by \"dithering,\" that a digital backdrop can be added later. adding gray pixels in between the black pixels of the video outlines and the lighter pixels of the digiThis was a stretch for the actors because decided that the retized sets.

They also discover that they have to find a way to change the ship's course before it drifts into a nearby sun. LOADSTAR, UNDER A KILLING MOON and SHOCK WAVE all use a mixed approach. They are TEX'S DIGITAL DINER Scenes from Access' UNDER A KILLING Moon were not building elaborate sets, but shot using crude props that were then given a digital makeover. they have done some set de sign. In LOADSTAR, Barry Primus sits in a cockpit with a familiar blue screen as the view screen for his cockpit. Digitized game scenes can be processed into the shot to make it look as if he is staring out into scenes from the action sequences in the game. Both LOADSTAR and UNDER A KILLING MOON have bar scenes in which tables and a bar serve as props around which the artists can digitize more detailed sets at a later date. In SHOCK WAVE, the company built a console for a control panel and painted it the correct hue in order to be able to project computer-generated dials, read-outs and computer screens onto it. In this way, they were able to get a hi-tech looking piece of equipment at a bargain basement price, but the actors were able to touch, lean on and look at something that was tangible. In Media Vision's THE DAEDALUS ENCOUNTER, all of the alien sets and aliens are created by computer artists and processed in at a later point, but the actors do get to use physical props like a round orb and certain weapons to enhance the illusion that they are in the scene. On this set, we observed filming delayed for up to 15 minutes because of a scuff mark on the blue surface of the floor, since it would have shown up incongruously on the computer art for the alien deck. We were also surprised to realize that the actors were willing to work longer hours for these shoots than they work on a typical Hollywood schedule. Chris Roberts opted not to try to digitize the aliens for WING COMMANDER III. The Kilrathi are combination human/puppet characters that look like something of a cross between Planet of the Apes and The Dark Crystal. Since a lot of the action takes place on large sets like throne rooms and hangar decks, it is a lot cheaper to completely render computerized sets than to try to build costly sets on the sound stage. The Chromakey approach makes considerably more sense. There is still considerable debate, however, over the value of digitized video in computer games. If the look and feel of the characters vs. the sets does not become more credible and satisfying, this may well turn into a trend that goes the way of 3-D movies. It will be particularly interesting to see how popular the cinematic sequences in LOADSTAR (90 minutes of live video footage), SHOCK WAVE (25 minutes of full motion video) and WING COMMANDER III (90-100 as yet unedited minutes of video), which basically segue gamers between action sequences and provide motivation for those sequences, compared with the interactive movie style that uses digitized video in every scene. 26 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Those who have experience in peopleand-paper role-playing know better. Hack and slash is a good way to get started in RPG'ing; it's easy to understand and helps players to learn the game mechanics quickly. After awhile, though, running around with nothing more to do than kill things and fill your pockets becomes boring. That's the time when the mature roleplayer of whatever age) turns to thinking of character development, the relation of his or her alternate persona to the world and the people in it. The scenarios they participate in focus more on character interaction and growth rather than endless combat, although combat still has its place; role-playing without action can be just as dull as action without role-playing. This is extremely difficult to pull off well in a CRPG; most products simply avoid it entirely. Yet there is hope; there has been a trend of late to get some more story, at least, into the games. Perhaps, in time, actual character development may edge its way in there, too. In ULTIMA IV, aside from developing the virtues, the concept that gave people the most trouble was self-sacrifice. Invariably, letters came in saying, Â«Hawkwind keeps telling me I still have a long way to go, but I've been giving away all my money to the beggars every chance I get! What's going on here??\" What was \"going on there\" was that people were forgetting that the virtue in question was self-sacrifice. Handing out gold is generous, but it isn't giving of yourself, which is what self-sacrifice means. Donating blood is self-sacrifice. Guarding the retreat of your comrades from the battlefield is self-sacrifice. Did backing off cost you some Valor points? Screen boredom annihilated!!!

"GAME HINTS All The Clues Fit To Hint Lands of Lore Eye of the Beholder II Arena Ultima VIII: Pagan Ultima VII: Serpent Isle Return To Zork Sam & Max Hand of Fate cm : O HERE WE ARE IN MID-SUMMER ALREADY. THE YEAR CERTAINLY seems to be going by quickly; Fred's got his eye (one of them, anyway) on the calendar, counting the days to the Annual Grues Convention in August. On the other hand, the year also seems to be going by rather slowly, as there sure haven't been too many new games released lately, and time drags when there's nothing new to play. Let's hope that situation changes for the better soon. Before we get to the mailbag, I have an update on the DAEMONSGATE situation mentioned in the previous column. For those who didn't read that article, I related the experiences of a reader who was trying to get tech support for the game, and how he ended up having to call England to get it. Just recently, I heard from Harold Lehman, who advised me that tech support for the game was now available in the US, and provided me with a couple of numbers. I called one of them (the 800 number, of course) and verified that Imagitec is now doing support for the game. If you have DAEMONSGATE and need help with it in any way, you can call 800438-3566 for tech support (wow, an 800 line-ya don't see that very often!), or 713-580-2148 for hints. Both lines are open 9AM-7PM central time weekdays. If you have DAEMONSGATE, I suggest you get in touch with these folks, as there is a patch available for the game, and you'll probably be needing it. And now, on to the good stuff! Lands of Lore: So ya made it through the infamous pit room without your map, and now you're wondering how to get on to the next level of the castle. Well, if you left the pit room, you went the wrong way. Just because something isn't obvious doesn't mean nothing's there. Go back in and look around a little more carefully this time. Eye Of The Beholder II: Those game multi-packs sure are good for revivals. At least, that's the only way I can explain the resurgence of questions about EOB II. Anyway, it seems that some adventurers are having a problem at the old \"Leave many things behind\" sign, which was a pain back when this game first came out (some things never change). Remember, it says \"many,\" not \"every.\" In other words, you don't have to put something on each plate, just some of them. I hope that Xplains the matter now.

That's because position is everything here; all the pieces must be placed in exactly the right locations for the gate to open. That means putting each piece in the same relative spot on the pentagram as the path to the Titan you defeated with that piece. Once everything's in place, the rest is automatic. Serpent Isle: Everyone helps the Gwani, and then they can't go any further. They're sure that one of the Gwani can tell them something about the password to open the gates to Skullcrusher, but how to get that information is another matter. The answer to this one is by no means obvious. You need to start looking for Batlin again; once you do that, the Gwani's memory will show an amazing improvement. Return to Zork: So you rented a boat, but you can't make it go, and Ben isn't talking about it he probably doesn't rent many boats because of that). Rats! What a terrible predicament. Almost as bad as walking in on the Troll chieftain and not being able to get the necklace from him. Hint: you don't have to say a word; just look the part, and you'll get what you want. Sam & Max Hit The Road: Okay, you're at the end game, you have the snoglobe in one hand, and a corked boltle in the other. You're pretty sure that cork would just fit into the bottom of the globe, but you can't get the cork out of the bottle (arrgh!). Well, of course not; ice picks weren't designed for that little job. This is where you have to get bent all out of shape, and you probably know someone somewhere who can help you with that. Hand of Fate: Some adventurers have made it to town, and beyond. If they could just reach that rope, they could swing over to the other side of the chasm to see what's there. So near, and yet so far! Ah, the frustrations of gaming. Y'know, thinking is thirsty work. Why not get yourself a cool drink while you consider the matter; I believe there's a fountain located conveniently near the town entrance. And that's all for the mailbag for now. In the meantime, if you need help with an adventure game, you can reach me in the following ways: On Delphi: Visit the GameSIG (under the Groups & Clubs menu).

There is one hero who starts the game as a second level corsair with predetermined statistics. He gains experience points primarily by successfully solving puzzles, discovering things, and finishing quests. Some experience points are awarded for killing creatures, but combat is not really stressed in this game. Levels are gained after enough experience points are collected, and increases in levels are accompanied by increases in hitpoints and by the opportunity to learn new combat skills. The interface is extremely easy to learn and to use. Movement and almost all object manipulations are mouse directed, although keyboard and joystick alternatives exist. All actions aside from movement and using projectile weapons (i.e., talking, fighting, picking up objects, breaking things, moving things, reading, etc.) occur by pressing the same key or mouse button. When you press the action key or mouse button you automatically do the appropriate\" thing with the object. In this way, the tedium of finding the right thing to do with objectsâ€”a tedium prevalent in adventure games-has been eliminated. Inventory management has also been thoughtfully designed.

If the orb is not returned, neither will she. The land in which INHERIT unfolds is a sprawling one, and there are many locations for the fox and his traveling companions to visit. While traveling in between these locations, you are able to determine Ril's path by way of an overhead view of the continent. As the game progresses, it becomes necessary for Rif and his friends to move into the unexplored \"Wild Lands.\" At this point, you must procure a map from Tycho Northpaw, canine cartographer. His map, however, is useful for only a portion of the Wild Lands, beyond which you will need to explore on your own. While in towns or villages, there are several streets and pathways to scout out. This can take a while, because only a very small portion of the area surrounding the lead characters is shown on the screen at one time. Among the town and city streets are buildings that are outwardly undistinguished, yet contain important objects or information. Once you have visited these buildings, it is often necessary to find them again once you have been elsewhere. MAZED AND CONFUSED Much of the time you invest in INHERIT will undoubtedly be spent moving back and forth between its many sites. An inordinate number of locations may only be reached by negotiating mazes of varying complexities. INHERIT contains a number of different mazes through which Rif will find himself traveling at least a dozen different times. Mazes, of course, like any other gaming device, are a matter of personal preference. However, even the most wel42 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1994 "

"SYSTEM HERO PARTY MISSION Robomop's chance to hit the nasties is improved for that turn. The party also has the opportunity to flee at the end of any round in which one hero is still conscious. Of course, there is always the chance that the party will lose a valuable weapon, artifact or piece of armor, but discretion is often times the greater part of valor. If the party is successful in combat, each character gleans experience points and there is a very good chance that they will find some treasure. Even though the treasure is often found in weird places like crusty, old pizza boxes, these repositories of goodies can be booby-trapped. So, as in most role-playing games, you'll need someone to detect traps\" before opening those treasure chests. That's where a party member like Mlle.

As with the XANTH interface, clicking on a given object will often cause new verbs to appear in the verb list at the side of the action window. If only one new verb shows up, clicking again on the object will create the logical command with that verb. If several new verbs show up, you'll have to choose the best verb. Within the adventure game locations, there are additional \"rooms to explore. In the various marketplaces, these may be hardware stores, pawnbrokers, shaman's tents or weapons shops. In old ruins like the SHL headquarters building, these may be additional rooms. At any rate, these other \"rooms\" will show up on the compass rose in the lower left-hand corner of the screen as new directions to travel. Clicking on the compass rose will cause a \"Yes or No\" dialogue box to appear onscreen which will enable the party to exercise or decline the option of entering these supplementary locations. Within the supplementary locations are non-player characters. These characters are open to limited conversations and, particularly for merchants, these conversations can become repetitive and redundant. Nonetheless, there are some humorous conversational gambits to be tried with these and other characters, and such lines can be easily selected from short menus of possible phrases. O You'll be right here! With Girlfriend\" DOCTOR, DOCTOR The goal of the game is to thwart the overall bad guy, Dr. Entropy, in his quest to prevent civilization from undergoing a rebirth. The Superhero League of Hoboken is a group of misfits who are considered to be incompetent. As the Crimson Tape, you are expected not only to assist civilization in becoming a phoenix, but to restore the reputation of these mutants who have grown beyond the power of mortal men. Accomplishing this task will require clever puzzle-solving, astute management and solid combat tactics. Frankly, I think that adding the roleplaying elements to THE SUPERHERO LEAGUE OF HOBOKEN helped improve the pace of the game, since you never know when you are going to be ambushed, and provides variety between the adventurestyle puzzles. It is a unique and clever blend of adventure and role-playing that makes it ideal for beginners and veterans of both genres. Experience erotic virtual romance with Girlfriend!

"REVIEW Four More For The Road Tired Of All The Yapping About Superhighways And Information Roadkill? Check Out Four Racing Games Where Digital Rubber Really Meets The Road by Gordon Goble ARK, THE SOUNDS OF THE SEASON ARE IN THE AIR. IF YOU'LL LISTEN CLOSELY, YOU'LL HEAR THE CHIRP OF the fair birdie, the hissing of lawn sprinklers, the whack of tennis ball against racquet, the roar of the powerful racing engine and the squeal of hot rubber. But far off in the distance, there's another, subtler sound. Listen, and you'll hear it.... Why, it's the hushed tone of computer game manufacturers nervously anticipating reaction to their latest fare! Yes, it's late summer, and the race to get automobile racing games to market has, this year anyway, nicely coincided with the racing season. In this issue, we'll be looking at no less than four new releases in the world of computerized, motorized competition. LOTUS: THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE FOR YOUR PC, LAMBORGHINI AMERICAN CHALLENGE, NIGEL MANSELL'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP, and FORMULA ONE are the four new entries into this suddenly burgeoning realm of gaming, and although the latter pair are indeed based on the Fl circuit, there is not a WORLD Circurr in the lot. That's not to say there's nothing here worthy of praise, just that those intent on serious \"simming\" should stick with WORLD CIRCUIT or INDYCAR RACING. But if mountainous learning curves and absolute realism aren't your thing, and fast action is we might have a game or two that will somewhat perturbed. light up your life.

Pick a track, any trackâ€”it just doesn't matter-they're all the same! Well, not identical, but certainly with little in the way of individuality, and definitely a far cry from their real life counterparts. I would go so far as to say that corners sometimes bend in the wrong direction, and what little there is in the way of elevation changes is also usually incorrect. Race distance is predetermined at live meager laps, opponents are jittery with nothing in the way of AI, slipstreaming has been overlooked, and rear mirrors are decorative only. The painted background never changes, even after a 180-degree hairpin, and it took me quite some time to realize that the PacMan power pill gobbling sound I was hearing was actually tire squeal. NIGEL MANSELL comes with driver's training course called \"Improve with Mansell,\" and is supposed to teach the enthusiastic rookie a little of the correct racing technique. With Nigel's disembodied head floating in the upper corner, like some Monty Python sketch gone wrong, and the \"proper\" racing line painted on each track, the Great One will instruct over and over again to \"Don't Hit Things.\" This exercise sounds easier than it is in application, considering car handling characteristics that successfully mimic that of a garbage truck. \"Keep on the racing line,\" Nigel's head will utter profoundly, but with NIGEL MANSELL, there is no reason to do soâ€”trust me.

"appropriate gear selection is invaluable, and proper racing lines really do mean something. When a degree of proficiency is attained, championship points will soon begin to accumulate, and soon your name will be proudly displayed alongside other grand racing names from the past and present, such as Jackie Stewpot, T. Hairy Bootson, Nigel Mainsail, Demon Hill and Ayrton Sendup. Ah, yes, a little British humour.... But the star of the LOTUS show is surely the racing environment. I, for one, was dazzled by the number of variables instituted into such a tiny package. Tracks vary from narrow dirt trails meandering through forested groves, to vertigo-inducing cliffside ribbons, from sweltering desert endeavors to six-lane super highways, and even a futuristic setting with roadside geodesic domes, laser beams and powerful car magnets. Be prepared to navigate through wellrendered digital representations of fog, rain, high-velocity windstorms, snow and ice, and remember to take on fuel when the tank begins to empty. LOTUS won't confine its drivers to daytime affairs either, and battles may be fought in the darkest night. Such divergent driving conditions calls for a variety of driving styles, from the flat-out, \"THIS FRIGGING CAR HAS NO BRAKES!\" style required in Futureworld to the pick-and-choose method one will need to adopt when the road is obscured with fog and surrounded by trees. This Lotus won't fall apart when crashed, but making contact with obstacles will certainly detract from your effort. And if a few less obstacles might make the ride a little easier, or the addition of a little more elevation would make things more interesting, then the LOTUS track designer awaits. This track building feature won't allow you to put down specific pieces of track one at a time, but instead allows for modifications to an overall feel. More mud, more darkness, a wider track, a few traffic cones and barriers, or perhaps an overflowing marsh-whatever seems interesting at the time-can be quickly and painlessly programmed. Needless to say, you will never get bored with the same old track. Movement though the various LOTUS screens is lightening fast (if installed to the hard drive), there is nary a lock-up, and the game manual leaves nothing in the way of guesswork. Car setup options, replays, game saving and printing capabilities are, unfortunately, not part of the package, yet what LOTUS does do, it does in admirable fashion. For what it's worth, I found this a difficult program to review, as each time I went back to check on a specific detail, I ended up playing the thing for an hour.

"REVIEW An Aging 18 Casey At The Bat Casey At The But The Revered Strat-O-Matic Baseball Has Thrilled Fans For Years, But It May Be Stepping Out Of Its Prime by Jim Gindin STRAT-O-MATIC is one that won't affect game play. Last year's release suffered from a copy protection system that was undeniably user-hostile. The master disk could only be installed once. For future use, an \"uninstallÂ» was required. Worse, if there was a hard disk crash, users had to call the company and request a \"remote reser.\" News of this system traveled quickly and drove many potential buyers to purchase other products. In an attempt to better please customers while still retaining a degree of protection for their product, STRAT-O-MATIC now uses a key disk. A more convenient alternative allows installation of a key file which bypasses the floppy drive check. UITE OFTEN, REVIEWERS CRITICIZE EVEN BOX SEAT VIEW THE BEST IN THEIR FIELD.

Perhaps the biggest improvement in ROLL THE DICE AND MOVE JIM RICE Aside from the graphics and league functions, STRAT-O-MATIC is an exact computer replication of its board game. The board game is centered around a set of player cards Strat-O-Matic produces every year. Each major leaguer has an individual card, reflecting his statistical performance for the entire season. Players roll dice to start an at-bat, with half the die rolls resulting in play resolution on the hitter's card and the rest using information from the pitcher's card. One out of every seven outcomes on the pitcher's card leads to an individual's fielding rating, which is how the game incorporates individual defensive abilities. The computer version rolls its own digital dice internally and follows the same algorithm as the board game. This means 50 percent of all plays are solely determined by the hitter, about 36 percent solely by the pitcher and 14 percent by the 76 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1994 "

Is SUBWAR 2050 a simulation or by Tom \"KC\" Basham ON THE RADAR AUGUST 1994  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 81 "


"an action game? MicroProse advertises it as a simulation of submarine warfare in (another) mercenary-filled world. Howeyer, the submarine fighters and carriers featured in SW2050 do not exist in the real world, nor are they likely to exist by 2050 AD. The world of SW2050 operates with the same basic rules as our own (at least pertaining to an underwater environment), the story is purely fictional, and the \"simulated\" devices are purely fictional. Simply recreating a few laws of physics does not earn a product the title \"simulation.\" Suppose, for example, I write a program that models every aspect of the Earth's atmosphere and aerodynamics known to man. Then I program a mass-less, inertia-less, friction-less object that I can move through my complex world. I wouldn't consider that a simulation of a massless, inertia-less, frictionless object operating in the real world. Further, I wouldn't consider this product even an Earth simulation since there is no way for me to experience or interact with atmospheric and aerodynamic elements programmed therein. In like vein, I do not consider SW2050 a simulation. It does not either a) simulate a real world technology, nor b) allow you to interact with a realistic underwater environment. That doesn't mean SW2050 isn't fun, it simply means I consider it purely fictional and not a simulation. COMMANDER. I therefore contend that try to be a simulation then the question of STRIKE COMMANDER is not a simulation. \"realism\" comes in. Realism is invariably When discussing a simulation, the ques an emotion-filled, subjective debate. Why? tion invariably arises: how realistic is it? Because this third check, Â«how realistic is How well does it approximate the re it,Â» has many subordinate questions to be sponses of a real-world item? I believe that answered.

Illustration by John Ball courtesy of Electronic Arts For example, compare INDYCAR RACING from Papyrus with WORLD CIRCUIT from MicroProse. Both model a real world vehicle. Both provide reasonable approximations of car handling. The key words, though, are reasonable approximations. Everything does not conform to realworld specifications; corners were cut somewhere. For example, ever try driving backwards down the track? Â«Death Indy,\" or racing the wrong way around the track trying to cause wrecks, was a favorite among the original players of INDY 500.

Second, a simulation must approximate the functions of the simulated item by ac cepting the appropriate inputs and providing a reasonable facsimile of a response. This is a harder issue to deal with. STRIKE COMMANDER, for instance, made it through the first check as a simulation of an F-16 set in the future. Now, the second check gets down to the nuts and bolts: is it really a simulation of an F16? The game takes many liberties with the flight and weapons models for the sake of game play.

Now what? Which one is \"more realistic.\" overall? Once we get into the third check we have many individual aspects to evaluate. So let's revisit F-15 STRIKE EAGLE III. Avionics-wise, it's one of the most complex flight simulators ever. The flight model is a mixed bag. Some aspects of flight performance, such as weight and altitude effects, broke new ground. Other aspects, such as aircraft response to flight inputs, were somewhat dismal. The aircraft wonderfully performed differently at 40,000 feet than it did at 10,000 feet. However, the aircraft responded to joystick movements as if it was mounted on rails in the sky. Changes were instantaneous. Every pilot, from novice to tripleace, got maximum-performance handling response. This doesn't disqualify F-15 SEIII as a simulation, especially since it excels in other areas, but it does reflect poorly on its overall \"feel.Â» E CHECK 4: ARE YOU THERE? The \"feel\" of a product is the fourth and final check of a simulation: given that the PC cannot recreate a world full of physical and sensory indicators, does the simulation make you feel as if you're really there. You could program a blank screen with blocks of numbers indicating airspeed, altitude, heading, throttle setting, etc, that conform to every known aerodynamic aspect of a given plane, but gives absolutely no feel to it. In my opinion, feeling that \"you're there is of extreme importance. I want every aspect of my flight/racing/submarine simulator to conform religiously to real-world specifications, but equally, I want to be convinced that I'm really in a virtual world. F-15SEIII meets checks #1 and #2, excels partially against check #3, and fails a single aspect of check #3 that really disrupts check #4. Further, F. 15SEIII featured the you-versus-theworld, take-a-dozen-hits-and-keep-going world interaction. Although F-15SEITI conformed to many real world specs and exceeded FALCON 3.0 in many flight modeling areas, in the end there were many things in F-15SEIII that \"burst the bubble,\" that constantly reminded me this isn't for real. In summary, something can be an excellent simulation yet provide little or no feeling of being there, which is what we all come to this hobby for. Check six, Pete Bonanni, there's a new air follow.

"don't fly with a lot of imagination. It's in a one-on-one fight that it becomes obvious there's a little confusion within the computer. I've deliberately entered a big bogey-gathering turn to see what would happen and have been surprised at how long it takes for the computer to decide that enough is enough. At best it can be described as hesitant behavior. I don't want to mislead; my quibbles aren't huge, and I find the bigger fights very challenging and fun, but I hope MicroProse will continue to refine the AI code as the series progresses.

Ever try finding T' and 'C' quickly? This is one area that needs to be rethought and reworked. It's cumbersome enough to turn off some potential fans of the game. PACIFIC AIR WAR is a winner, especially when played with the right support equipment. There are a few weak spots, most notably the poor control layout, but if the READ.ME file is any indication, MicroProse wants to go all out to support this series of programs, and may yet address most complaints. (To start, Micro Prose has promised a free modem-play upgrade). With these minor refinements, 1942 may well become the date on every simulation fan's lips. 5 TORPEDO RELEASED 4 Doug Fick's other car is an F-16.

The view modes within the aircraft are of limited value, so you'd better get good at the virtual cockpit or suffer. With a set of rudder pedals and a THRUSTMASTER MARK II WCS, I was set to fly with style. Once I disabled these great add-ons, the game became much more demanding. Keystrokes and control layout didn't receive the attention they deserve, and play suffers for it. The best example is FINAL INSPECTION When seen from the larger perspective, it is apparent that MicroProse was aiming at the serious flight sim fan with 1942. While it might be fun for the more casual pilots, there is a good chance that the difficulty level might turn off some. Those willing to work through some of the small annoyances will be rewarded by the game. With most sims, my interest wanes fairly quickly, but 1942 has staying power to spare. With its great graphics, frame rate, virtual cockpit, and overall feel, 1942: THE 1942: THE PACIFIC AIR WAR Rating: **** PROS Great graphics, frame rate, the virtual cockpit, and the admiral's-eye strategic game make this one a contender for flight leader in the WWII sim squadron.

Although clearly no history documentary, PACIFIC STRIKE provides enough of an overview to introduce younger players to the war. PACIFIC STRIKE's storyline follows the same format as Origin's other products. Two-dimensional faces with blank eyes stare directly at you and quote often-corny dialogue. You are, naturally, the hero of the World War II saga, a newly graduated pilot with no combat experience but an heroic serving of responsibility. The aircraft carrier you now call home contains the standard array of characters used in other Origin products, including a roughand-gruff wing commander; a cocky, fresh-off-the-farm wingman full of spunk; a battle weary and shell shocked Flying Tiger who has a strange insight into the Japanese; an ordnance officer full of technical wisdom; and, of course, an aged cook who comes filled with opinions on almost everything. Gameplay also follows the standard Origin mold. An autopilot cinematically teleports you and your flight between \"action points.\" Each action point requires you to complete some specific task. Tasks vary from torpedo runs, dive bombing, and dogfighting. As with STRIKE COMMANDER, the main objective of the mission may not always be clear, and you may have to replay missions several times to discover what the \"success secret\" is.

The change of allegiance was perceived by many as an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fan appeal of a direct rivalry with the city's other team. Fans already were speculating what it would be like watching a player like Bobby Bonilla face the other league's pitchers. According to sources, Front Page Sports Baseball made the team's move easy. League play can be configured for up to 48 teams in one to three leagues. Talk around the league centered on what it would be like to have Toronto and Atlanta in the same league and division.

Women in VELIKIYE Luki are shamefully oppressed by patriarchal notions of history, and their heroic efforts for victory are disregarded. 5. Patriotism. A simple equation. WARLORDS II is English, the universal language of the Western Alliance, of which Australia is such an integral part. VELIKIYE Luki is Russian, which is the language of the bad guys. 6. Realism. VELIKIYE LUKI has some pretensions to realism, but only WARLORDS Il conveys the true essence of generalship. The noted WWI historian Captain Edmund Blackladder stated that the secret British war plan on the Western Front was \"to continue until everyone was dead except Field Marshall Haig, Lady Haig and their tortoise Alan.\" This is exactly the style of warfare that only WARLORDS II can deliver, although there must be some doubt over any general exemption for tortoises. 7. Nomenclature II: What could a company called Â«Strategic Studies Group\" do except produce wargames, probably under the auspices of the CIA or Pentagon? On the other hand, what could a company called \"Atomic\" produce? I'm afraid that I have insullicient evidence to clearly state that Keith hasn't made clandestine trips to North Korea or that a special room in his house isn't lined with lead. 8. Examination: When the combat graphic comes up in WARLORDS II, it says \"War!', not 'Strategy! Pretty obvious, I would have thought. 9. Realism II. A game of VELIKIYE LUKI leaves one with a realistic appreciation of WWII combat on the Russian Front. A game of WARLORDS II leaves you feeling that you'd like to annex your neighbors house, raze his garden shed, and conscript his children, before he does the same to you. Obviously, WARLORDS II is a much more realistic experience, and a much better guide to urban survival. 10. Seniority: SSG has been here much longer than Atomic. Show some respect. Gregor Whiley, SSG\" And so these little debates rage. In the meantime, we should all laugh, play war and strategy games, and be glad that our hobby is thriving.

You have complete control over practically every aspect of unit design; all types of bonuses are included, and you can set unit values to practically any setting you like.

Temple allies and allies have their own restrictions, but these flow naturally from the game design and should not stymie anyone. City Sets are less flexible; all you can really change is the appearance of the icons. Each city's production and income is set independently in each scenario, however, so this is not a major concern. There are several customizable controls for your scenario's presentation.

You are able to paint with a remarkable degree of control. All the familiar terrain of WARLORDS II is at your disposal, as well as the more unusual terrain of the Mud and Ice terrain sets. Once the broad outlines of your land are in place, it is time to use the \"Smooth\" function. This creates realistic shoreline, modifies terrain slightly (i.e., your mountain range may be ringed by hills), and in general causes the map to look right. Perfectionists can change the map details after smoothing to make things look perfect, or to create terrain that the smoothing function disallows (like mountain ranges in the middle of the ocean).

City improvements BUILD POINTS ARE FLEETING such as \"opera\" increases culture and, Each scenario begins when you purchase thus, victory points. Universities have a similar function and are required for certain research items. However, the university actually decreases a city's victory points. I suppose having those \"radical commie pinkos\" on campus is not conducive to supporting the war effort. The university is essential to building missile bases, which are a city's strongest defense. In the shorter scenarios, you will be unable to quickly improve the R&D capabilities and will have to rely on coastal forts. Their cost is affordable, although their placement can often be troublesome. While they can be placed in a land hex within four hexes of \"downtown,\" it is often a matter of trial-and-error to determine which hex will in fact support a fort, and an incorrect placement will force one to begin the acquisition process from the beginning. Cultural improvements are best left to longer scenarios. In a limited turn-based game, victory must be achieved too soon to effect any major changes, and the optimal strategy seems to be the rapid deployment of new capital ships. A strength of TGF is that the different options require different playing strategies, and the longer scenarios do in fact give victory to the \"Most Cultured\" conqueror. ROCK BEATS SCISSORS Simply put, TGF is a \"rock/paper/scissors\" wargame. There are eight classes of ships, including carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, PT boats, submarines, transports and minelayers. Like a myopic American admiral of the 1920s, the game crowns the battleship as king, and it is clearly the most effective unit. However, its high cost and extreme vulnerability to submarines requires that you develop a more balanced mix. 112 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. AUGUST 1994 "

For inin the past year, and compare favorably to stance, Genghis has 15 body points each other strategic wargames.

Trade occurs when a merchant visits one of your territories, and is one of the easiest ways to build your empire. Some merchants travel from as far away as Venice, and offer many opportunities to sell silks or porcelain at great profit. Arms can be purchased to strengthen your military forces, or you may simply want to buy and sell various goods in an attempt to corner the market. Still, merchants tend to hit the wealthier states more often, so a ruler who lingers in Lower Mongolia is likely to find himself stuck there with a penniless purse. Inexorably linked to your fortune is the happiness of the populace, expressed as a support rating. To keep the natives from rebelling, you must allocate the labor so that enough food is produced through herding and harvesting. Construction is a must to improve the economy, provide shelter from disasters, and defend against ill-tempered neighbors. Taxes are a last resort, as they drive support down, while a few gifts of food or furs go a long way toward ensuring loyalty. While not exactly \"Merchant Prince Khan,\" the economic module provides plenty to juggle, as there are never enough body points or gold pieces to cover every eventuality. As if a ruler didn't have enough headaches, conquered lands must have g overnors appointed from a pool of generals. Problem is, a general loyal in war may soon fall prey to ambition as the glory and grandeur of governing puffs up his pride. Even if loyalty is not in question, great warriors do not always make good bureaucrats. Thus, the game system allows you to appoint an advisor to address the balance, but with the trade-off of lost time and body points. Diplomatic options allow you to extort 116 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Amazingly easy to learn and bug-free, it is difficult to master. Although the game system is strong, it also has a charm and elegance missing from many games these days.

Q.Q.P's Strategies of the Month Playing above difficulty levels 12-13 (of 21) can be tough, yet interesting. I (Bruce Williams) enjoy level 16. Sometimes at that level I can't buy a win and other times (with enough thinking) I can kick butt. When you first get Grandest Fleet, start at levels 1-5 until you get used to the mechanics of the game. In the short games forget super-ships. In the medium to long games, create the economy to build these super-ships. Almost inevitably, your opponent will be doing the same. A string of super battleships and/or super carriers, aiming down the channel at your basic conventional fleet, will make you want to melt in your shoes. My favorite ways of playing Grandest Fleet is in either the random map or the balanced historical maps. In the random you pretty much set your own balance by your choice of cities at the start. In the historical, the balance is set by playing both sides in tandem (ala Perfect General). In the shorter historical maps 10-12 turns, playing both games against the computer shouldn't take longer than 1.5 to 2 hours.

Generally, this means hiring workers so that each of the assembly lines (there are six per factory) has an optimal number of workers building successful models. Since starting salaries and benefits are randomly generated at the beginning of each game, it is critical to adjust these numbers so that researchers and assembly line workers are making a decent wage (i.e., one that creates a few new prospective hires in the employment pool each turn) while your company is making a healthy profit. Henry Ford once said, \"People can have our cars in any color they want, as long as it's black.\" But once your company is running in the black, your cars no longer have to. At that point, you can create your own designs of various model cars, painting them in any color you want. Through a scrolling variety of fronts, middles and rears, various car sections can be combined to make sports cars, sedans, luxury models, trucks and a variety of other car types. The body design, choosing from a variety of painstakingly researched features such as engine types, braking systems, and luxury options, is the next order of car design. While each feature adds to the quality and value of a particular car make, it also increases the cost to produce it. With a design completed, the prototype can be taken to a test track for evaluation to help you determine the car's potential success in the marketplace.

"STRATEGY Setting Traps For Desert Rats Strategy and Tactics for Avalon Hill's OPERATION CRUSADER by Robert R. Mayer IELD MARSHAL ERWIN ROMMEL: DASHING AND DECISIVE, THE PERFECT EXPONENT OF THE BLITZKRIEG STYLE of warfare. General Bernard Montgomery: deliberate and determined, the personification of the indomitable fighting spirit of the British army. In 1941, these two men, and the forces they commanded, would clash in the deserts of North Africa. While often bitterly fought, the campaign the Allies called Operation Crusader was not the decisive engagement that either side desired. However, with Avalon Hill's OPERATION CRUSADER and the insights into game mechanics provided in this article, you can change all that. odds shifts. What's new is the prospect for negative odds shifts. If the defender's total anti-tank value is greater than the attacker's total armor value, the attacker can incur up to -3 odds shifts. As a result, strong anti-tank defenses can wreak havoc on illconsidered armored assaults. Armored infantry units incur no negative shifts to odds due to armor/anti-tank matchups. Negative shifts only apply to pure tank or recon units. In another new twist, CRUSADER also allows defending armor units to apply their armor values to create negative odds shifts. A non-armor stack attacking an armored or recon unit can incur up to -10 odds shifts in this way. Anti-tank companies are now very valuable additions to an attacking stack because they can limit the negative shifts from defending armored units. Tanks in the open desert truly do reign supreme, as Table 1 shows. ducting the overrun. Yes, even leg infantry units can overrun a hex if they are stacked with an armored unit and can generate the required odds. Overruns occur when an eligible stack plots tactical movement into an enemy occupied hex and can generate at least 10:1 odds. All modifiers except air and artillery support count, and each overrunning stack calculates its odds separately. A successful overrun usually eliminates the enemy and any enemy zones of control (ZOCs) exerted into the overrun hex. Overruns can occur before or after combat, in effect allowing multiple attacks on a single hex. You cannot overrun stacks that contain any unit with an armor value greater than zero. Nonetheless, overruns add enormous flexibility to the game, and open up many possibilities. On the defensive, tanks can do wonders in stiffening a line, but they are better employed as a mobile THE RULES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' With scads of new rules, veteran gamers of Atomic's V FOR VICTORY series (of which CRUSADER is a descendant) will have to adjust their thinking if they want to succeed in CRUSADER. While there are numerous small changes, the major new rules affect three general areas: combat, headquarters and supply. Tanks in CRUSADER are much more decisive than they were in any of the V4V games, and players must plan accordingly. Armor shifts are still determined by dividing the larger value by the smaller and assigning a negative or positive sign as necessary. If total attacking armor values are greater than total defending anti-tank values, the attacker receives up to +10 TABLE 1: Maximum Odds Shifts (+/-) for Armor vs. Anti-tank Values Defender Armor/Recon Arm. Inf. Infantry Attacker Armor/Recon +10/-3 +10/-3 +10/-3 Armored Infantry +10/-0 +10/-0 +10/-0 Infantry +0/-10 +0/-3 +0/-0 counterattack force. On the attack, tanks can turn mediocre assaults into important breakthroughs. OVERRUNS: RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY! As in many boardgames, overruns in CruSADER occur during movement, not combat. CRUSADER, however, allows any unit to participate in an overrun, provided there is at least one armor unit in the stack conNIGHT OPERATIONS: LULLABY AND GOODNIGHT...

"HEX, BUGS & ROCK 'N ROLL The Lighter Side Of Doom CGW Peeks Behind The Gloom Of Doom To Shed Light On The Program's Lighting Techniques by Paul C. Schuytema through level creation and the placement of lighting effects in a level he was working on for DOOM II. Shake off this downy sleep, deaths counterfeit, And look on death itself! Up, up, and see The great doom's image! Shakespeare, MacBeth, Act II, Scene III UST WHAT IS IT ABOUT ID SOFTWARE'S DOOM THAT MAKES IT SO FRIGHTFULLY REAL? AS FAR AS HIGH-CONCEPT, there really isn't any. In the words of Doom's level designer, Sandy Petersen, Â«DOOM is nothing more than the computer equivalent of WhackA-Mole.\" Even so, when you're immersed in an adventure, surrounded by a maze of charred and eroded support columns, growls heard from all directions, corpses littering the flagstones, and suddenly, the fluorescent lights which line the ceiling flicker on and off, what do you feel? Perhaps you feel like running? If only you could see your way out; if only the lights would illuminate the room for long enough to get off one clean shot at that.... Anyone who has played Doom knows that the atmosphere, the visceral feel of a dark and dangerous world, is the key component to the game's success. Undoubtedly, one of the most dramatic components of DOOM's environment is the use of lighting. Some lights are dim, others cast a blue pall over the room, while still others are malfunctioning, flickering incessantly, or burning out at the most awkward moment. How do they do it? How is this dramatic lighting created? Why play around with so many lighting effects at all? I asked John Romero, one of id's wunderkind programmers, and the answer rolled off his tongue quite easily, Â«The lighting helps the game seem more doomy, it adds life to the environment.\" I sat down with John in his morosely dark office (the lighting was strangely familiar to that found in level E1M6) as he talked me WELCOME TO THE NEXT LEVEL The designers at id create levels much as role playing game masters create dungeons: by drawing them on graph paper. For Romero, though, this graph paper appears in a window on his 486 PC configured to run the NeXT computer's operating system, NeXTStep. Drawing with a mouse, he creates the game's levels, which are wholly divided into sectors when seen from a bird's-eye view. Within any given room, the walls will create the borders to a sector, yet there may be other, invisible sectors within the room. He might create an area where, if stepped in, a wall would open up and a horde of hungry imps would descend (ever see a room like that?). Or he could create a dramatic lighting effect, perhaps a bright light illuminating a still twitching corpse. In actuality, every group of lines that define a space is considered a sector, so each individual stair is its own discrete sector, for example. When working with the level design program, Romero, or Petersen, or whomever is creating a level, has the option to select many different qualities for each sector, such as the look of the walls, floor or ceiling. Will a severed limb be hanging from a meat-hook? What will the lighting be like? As an example, consider a barren room with a skylight in the ceiling (you've run across several rooms like this in Doom, I'm sure). The light pouring in from the skylight illuminates the floor under it, creating a patch of bright flooring in an otherwise dimly-lit room. While a 3D rendering program will actually place a light source above the skylight and calculate the path the light takes (a technique known as ray tracing), the DOOM team took quite a different approach. Everything in DOOM has been optimized for manic speed, and calculating the light rays emitting from 200 200 50 50 300 AMMO | HEALTH ARMS ARMOR 180 YOU'VE SEEN THE LIGHT Unlike the starkly bright environment of WOLFENSTEIN 3D, the world of Doom uses subtle lighting techniques to evoke its unique brand of terror. 140 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"HEX, BUGS & ROCK 'N ROLL UNE BENELLI melalui LL API . every light source would bog the computer down to a crawl. In the words of Romero, \"The only way to get an engine as fast as DOOM's is to fake a lot of stufl.\" Instead of being created by a rendering algorithm, the rectangle of light on the floor is actually a sector, assigned its own light value in the level-design program. When designing the room, a pattern is selected for the floor, say, a moldy, lichenencrusted array of flagstones. This pattern, in and of itself, has its own brightness (if you were examining it in a graphics program). In DOOM, though, each texture can have a light level imposed upon it. For the sector under the skylight, the light level is relatively higher than normal while the rest of the room is dark and gloomy. When the Doom engine calculates how to draw the room, it fetches the pattern for the floor, and then the light level for the portion it is drawing. If it is dim, then a subroutine looks to a translation table for the pixel in question, to shift the color to a more muted tone. If it is lighter, then a color from a more energized section of the palette is assigned. Then the floor is drawn, and presto, light seems to pour down from the skylight. Initially, this color-shifting of the game's 256-color palette was calculated during the rendering loop, as a routine utilizing RedGreen-Blue mixture levels to calculate what color in the game's palette was the closest match to the dimmed color. This ate up valuable rendering time, so id employed a program that worked through their entire palette and precalculated what color was the best match, building a translation table that could be referred to very quickly. CURRENT TEXTURE Tee SKINTEKI Terms light levels), then brighten up to the initial light level. With any of the flickering or strobing lighting effects, the individual sector always takes stock of the light levels that surround it. In a dark corridor, a strobe light just wouldn't look right if it diminished entirely to black. Instead, it diminishes to the dim light levels surrounding it, creating a very natural, very real illusion of light.

Each band represents the 25. The strobe lights flash in sync to the next dimmer (or brighter) light-level. Lighting effects are all interpolated mathematically during the vertical texture mapping routine (one of the few routines coded in assembly code by programmer John Carmack; the bulk of Doom's code is written in straight ANSI C). with other point-of-view engines (WOLFENSTEIN included), floors and ceilings are drawn first, meeting at the horizon point, then walls are drawn over the fields of color to create the TEXTURES SESAME There's no question that the art is incredible.

PATCH PATTE  DIMINISHING RETURNS There are two types of lighting in DOOM: diminished lighting (which is always brightest where your character is standing and diminishes across distance), and strobe lighting (synchronized strobes, unsynchronized strobes with flashes just a little off, and broken fluorescent lighting). A sector has an initial light level, which can be any one of 16 levels, from totally dark to full-bright. In addition, each sector can have a special capability, such as applying damage to your character or performing one of the active lighting functions. An area may also be assigned a glow value, which means that the light will be of a more ethereal, pulsing quality. The area begins at an initial light level, and through time, the light level will lower to that of the immediately surrounding sectors (which are often assigned lower initial 142 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"UNDER THE HOOD Talk Shop With A Tech Jock 1890 CGW's Technical Editor Locates CPU Upgrades And Finds Homes For Wayward Peripherals za by Mike Weksler HORNYAK 894 Does DOS leave you feeling as if you've wandered into a cold, dark and mysterious dungeon? Do memory monsters wrest control of your rig, leaving you RAMless in a RAM-demanding world? Look here for answers to your technical dilemmas, delivered by our resident digital dragon-slayer. between the Sound Blaster Pro, Sound Blaster 16, Sound Blaster MCD, Sound Blaster SCSI, and the others? I plan on adding a CD-ROM too, by the way. Jorge Asch, Miami, FL T his is useful if you want to mess with Osound, reverb, chorus and other exotica like audio MPEG compression. For more info, contact Creative Labs at (408) 428-6600. SNAP-ON HIGH PERFORMANCE Greetings! I own a 486SX-33. After purchasing TERMINATOR RAMPAGE, I found it to run too slow. I'm now paranoid to buy software rated for DX2, DX4 and Pentiums! Is this an isolated case? Please help. Colin Pestinger, Shawnee Mission, KS No, it's hardly an isolated case. The hardware demands for high-end games, particularly fast action and simulation games, continue to creep up. Many developers have established the 486DX-33 as their target minimum machine for the rest of 1994. One economical upgrade solution is the new Intel 1486 DX2 OverDrive Processor, Depending on your motherboard configuration, it will either drop into the OverDrive socket, or replace your existing 486SX CPU. With the bit-crunching power of a 486DX2-66, this chip will undoubtedly get your games running as fast as can be expected. The processor is sold as a complete upgrade kit. You get the DX2 OverDrive Processor (with heat sink already attached), a chip puller, a utilities disk, concise documentation, and technical support. The chip is very easy to install, even for a novice. The suggested retail price is $399, but you can probably hunt down a much lower street price. Beyond that, it's Pentium time. Let's start with the Sound Blaster Pro Deluxe. With this package you get an OPL3 FM synthesis chip, 8-bit stereo digital audio, and a UART MIDI port. Creative Labs' even throws in a Panasonic (Matsushita) 40-pin CD-ROM adapter. If you want to forgo the one-slot solution for upgrading your FM music to wave table at a later date (you'd have to add a separate synthesis-only card), and you don't mind listening to 8-bit digital audio on an 8-bit card (most games use 8-bit audio sampled at rates between 8 and 22KHz), you could stop here. If you get a Sound Blaster 16 Basic, you get an MPU-401 MIDI port (so you can jack in your MPU-401 compatible keyboard or Wave Table synthesis mod ule), 16-bit digital audio CODEC, the same OPL3 FM chip, the Panasonic CDROM adapter, and a feature connector which lets you snap-on Creative Labs' Wave Blaster daughter card for a wave table synthesis upgrade. This year will be the year of the Wave Blaster compatible daughter card with offerings from Aztech (Wave Power), Roland (Sound Canvas DB), Turtle Beach (Rio) and Media Vision (Wave Table Professional Upgrade). PUT THE JOY INTO JOYSTICKS Many of our readers own several joysticktype devices for playing a variety of games. For instance, they might use a Gravis Gamepad for action games like Doom, a CH Flightstick or Thrustmaster for serious light sims, or even a driving wheel for racing simulations. For many, switching joystick cables is a major hassle. If you're tired of the back of your computer looking like a telephone operator's nightmare, then you should get to know a company called Lead Pursuit. The Lead Pursuit folks have just introduced a clever solution for joystick management-the Joyswitch. This baby can handle up to four different joysticks, including your Gravis Gamepad, CH Flightstick, Thrustmaster FCS Pro and driving wheel-all at the same time! Also, you can jack in two different foot controllers so you can have your driving pedals on Footswitch 1 and your rudder controls on Footswitch 2. It even supports the Thrustmaster WCS Mark II. No cheap stuff here, as both cables have thumb screws to secure your rig for combat. The list price is $49.95. For more information contact: Lead Pursuit, Inc. (714) 362-8698, or the Check Six BBS (714) 362-8299 (8N1, 1200-28.8kb). needs, period. The Panasonic CD-ROM adapter is fine if your CD is compatible, otherwise, Creative Labs offers the Sound Blaster 16 SCSI with an Adaptec 50 pin SCSI-2 host and the Sound Blaster MCD (Multi-CD), which sports three different CD-ROM adapters-Mitsumi, Panasonic and Sony. The Sound Blaster 16 cards can be purchased with or upgraded to use the Advanced Signal Processing chip.

Sex Doux Benson Brett Butler Ellen Cleghorne CASTLES: SIEGE & CONQUEST Lest there be confusion in the ranks, this game is actually CASTLES II for the Macintosh, with the full-motion video of the DOS game rendered in Quicktime. Featuring film clips from Sergei Eisenstein's classic Alexander Nevsky and the BBC documentary The Private Lives of Henry VIII, the game is rich in the atmosphere of the period. Although much more of a wargame than the original CASTLES, there are plenty of castles to build and many adStevie Ray the digitized photos of charging and wounded Mexican soldiers to make you believe for a moment that you are watching a good Mexican War re-enactment. No arcade stuff here-this one demands sound tactics, including when to sortie, where to place cannon, and how to stop Santa Ana's massive forces before running out of precious gunpowder. Perhaps the biggest complaint to be levied against this game is that you can only play the Texan side, which is always a losing proposition. IBM, $29.95 (plus $3 S&H). Circle Reader Service # 3.

Subtitled Victory or Death, this is a quaint little strategy game reminiscent of the old SPI ALAMO board game from the 1980s. Don't be put off by the scant rule book; there's a lot of fighting for those gamers hankering to brandish their Bowie knives. Basically, your role is that of Colonel Travis, commander of the beleaguered Alamo garrison. You must send off messengers to enlist help from Goliad and other nearby towns, hoping to stave of defeat longer than the garrison did historically. The artwork blends well enough with OOO COMEDY CENTRAL-DATING & MATING In yet another attempt to turn existing video content into a \"multimedia\" product, Time Warner has gathered various video vignettes related to life, love, passion and unrequited romance, and shoveled them onto a CD. Taken mostly from stand-up comedy routines, the 50-odd video clips are sorted into joke categories. Among the comedy talent are some heavyweights, the most prominent being Brett games using mouse or keyboard, your reflexes will eventually hone to the point where overhead kicks and sliding tackles become almost second nature. A modicum of managerial control keeps this game from being just another thumb exercise, but those expecting the soccer equivalent of EARL WEAVER BASEBALL are advised to look elsewhere.

"NOW PLAYING FULL COUNT BASEBALL 6.0 The fastball pitcher of sports simulation, Lance Hallner, has once again refined his baseball game, and hold on to your VGA monitor-he has included graphics this time around. While retaining its easy-tolearn game system, the latest version inHARPOON II This magnum opus of modern naval warfare has sailed in vapor land so long, we expected it to emerge laden with seaweed. No one seriously doubted project leader Carl Norman's sincerity, but the big surprise is that the long wait has significantly helped the product, despite the complications surrounding its difficult birth. One of the designers' intentions was to create a DOS environment that would run like Windows, without the time lagâ€”and generally, they have succeeded. The game is complex, even intimidating, but the new toolbar interface and thorough manual, combined with solid tutorials, should make admirals out of landlubbers in no time. Those concerned about the slippage of our crew are in natural G.I. jargon. Similar to Rene Vidmer's other designs, U-BOAT and BOMBER, this game is best played in seclusion; too many interruptions will find you missing important messages, and looking down the business end of an '88. Don't be fooled by the plain brown packaging, because M4 has a lot of wear in its treads for the gamer who doesn't need a complex simulation. Windows, $44.95. Circle Reader Service # 8.

How many other board games keep normal families up until the wee hours, haggling over the relative worth of a railroad deed? Luck-dependent and patterned, the game's great success stems largely from its simplicity, which has been largely captured in this painstakingly faithful version. The interface uses color and familiar MONOPOLY icons in such a way that anyone will feel right at home. While the AI is OK, the best thing about this product it that it allows you to play more home-brewed versions of MONOPOLYEFEPERT came ton erition Board Bode m old nemesis, the Soviet Union, should rest easy, as the designers have devised a number of new villians and clever scenarios for endless naval war delights. 360 Pacific has finally launched a full spread of ship-toship missiles with this release.

"THE SCORE Welcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. | . . .    HALL OF FAME BATTLECHESS INTERPLAY, 1988 CELE Shese When Interplay's BATTLECHESS was released on the Amiga in 1989, it shot straight to the top of the CGW Poll. Its beautiful slapstick animations showcased the Amiga's sound and graphic capabilities, and put an interesting new spin on an ancient game. BATTLECHESS became not only a perennial in the CGW Poll ratings, but also a showcase product for the first level of multimedia standards. It sold hundreds of thousands of copies covering just about every game platform imaginable, and spawned an entire genre of animated chess products. By introducing BATTLECHESS, Interplay became the Franklin Mint of computer chess publishers. Interplay's improvements to the chess engine and animations have taken many forms, perhaps the most successful being their use of claymation techniques in BATTLECHESS 4000. Sparked by a keen attention to detail, the sequels to BATTLECHESS are a fine example of the Interplay formula for success.

When introduced into the CGW Hall of Fame, it was generally accepted as the strongest chess engine around. Although the competition among chess simulations is much tougher these days, CHESSMASTER continues to develop. Recent additions include advice given in digitized speech, SVGA graphics, and improved sound support. For the chess enthusiast, the myriad of classic games and chess problems provide entertainment for players of all skill levels. The current version, CHESSMASTER 4000 (sce CGW # 114), offers over two dozen opponents based on great chess grandmasters throughout the ages. Defined by 17 different attributes, these computer players each have a unique style, and add not only challenge, but endless variety to this most consistent and prestigious line of chess games.

Also, every title listed on the survey card may not appear in the Top 100, either because they did not score high enough or because of an insufficient number of responses on a particular game (usually due to a title's distribution delays or low initial retail penetration).
