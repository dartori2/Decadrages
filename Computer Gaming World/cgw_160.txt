"JOHNNY WILSON editor Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Byte tele WOY Why Computer Gamers Like the Dark Side Why is fear important? Why are we likely to jump (nearly) out of our chair in surprise when a Shambler leaps out at us in QUAKE, scattering our onscreen characters in every direction? Why do we relish the feeling that something is not right in GABRIEL KNIGHT 2 as we explore Schloss Ritter or the crypt below s it really healthy to have games filled with mon sters, violence, and gore?\" Family, friends, acquain tances, and mem bers of the gener. al media have asked me that ques. tion on numerous occasions during my 15 years of covering games. The corollary question is often, \"Why do there have to be so many negative images in games?\" The simple answer, for those with no patience for my philosophical/ psychological perambulations, is that there must be evil in order to allow for the heroic. Positives demand negatives and vice versa. The deeper answer is that we need fear in our lives. Greek civilization used the word phobeo (\"1 flee\") to express the basic reaction to fear or terror-1 run. I run because of a perceived threat to my continued existence. I run because of biological reactions (adrenaline flow, rapid pulse rate, tensed muscles) that propel me toward action. Yet the Greeks also recognized that by overcoming fear, we become masters over our circumstances. Phobos, the god of fear, was often listed as the second god in the pantheon after Zeus. Alexander and Theseus both sacri ficed to Phobos in order to pave the way for conquest. Sparta was dominated by a temple dedicated to Phobos. Aristotle believed that we must learn from fear. ( By overcoming fear, we become masters of our circum| stances. between. As James observed in his Principles of Psychology, \"The progress from brute to man is characterized by nothing so much as by the decrease in frequency of proper occasions for fear.\" So why do we like to experience fear or perpetrate ferocity in our gaming? It is largely because we have to practice in vicarious experience through virtual combat and problem solving-the skills that are instinctual to humanity but rarely given opportunity for expression. Gaming becomes a release for the ferocity within and satisfies the internal longing to practice self-preservation through both flight and ferocity. But it's more than that. Fear is also the flip side of curiosity. Modern psy chologists recognize that when fear drives the individual, curiosity and exploration are reduced. If fear is reduced, curiosity can dominate. Humans experience the fear of solitude, the fear of the unknown (related to both the threat of extinction and of solitude, as expressed in fears of dark places), and the fear of extinction. Such fear can both protect us from danger and shelter us from growth opportunities. Games with macabre themes; dia bolical evil; eerie sounds; and dark, lonely environs give us an opportunity to move past the immobilizing fear that reduces curiosity and move into symbolic areas of growth and discovery. To be sure, the conquests and the victory over fear are ceremonial since they take place in fictional universes and only exist digitally in some silicon memory, but they form a pattern for problemsolving pattern recognition, and resource management that can become a creative lifestyle. Finally, computer games that include elements of the diabolical, monstrous, and horrific tend to affirm basic virtues. Stephen King, master teller of hair-raising tales, claims in Danse Macabre that horfor stories reaffirm virtues by showing us what happens to people who venture into taboo lands. The stories of evil characters hoist by their own petards are as ubiquitous as a Tales from the Crypt episode. This idea of chaotic doings swinging back into balance is enhanced in computer games because the gamer's character is usually the instrument that the game's designer uses to redress the balance. It is learning by doing. As with all philosophical discussions, this one probably proves little. Yet, if it helps to address some of the anxiety that parents, spouses, and friends have about negative charac ters, images, and deeds within computer games, it will have increased our understanding. Why do we need the \"delightful fear\" of a dark com. puter game? It keeps us alive-in more ways than one. for a different perspective on the darker side of computer gaming, see Martin Cirulis' column this month on page 446. the church? Why do we savor decapitating the zombies in NIGHTMARE CREATURES or leaving entrails on the ground in a host of mediocre first-person shooters? It is because, as psychologist William James told us in the last century, fear and ferocity are the flip sides of each other. Both are necessary impulses for survival. \"We both fear, and wish to kill, anything that may kill us....\" The first impulse represents self-preservation through flight while the second represents self-preservation through action. The truth is that while both are necessary for indi. vidual survival, opportunities for the latter are fewer and farther bies for NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "

The caption identifies it as a 1987 Ferrari 328 GTS, when in fact it is actually a Ferrari Testarossa. The 328 is powered by a V8 with a displacement of 3.2 liters (hence 328). It also has a removable targa top (spider in Italian), hence the 'S' designation, The Testarossa is powered by a 5.0 liter V12 and has a fixed roof.

Here's what they found: (RATINGS ARE FROM I TO 5 DOVES, 5 DOVES BEING EXCEPTIONAL) TBIS IS THE KA POINT #1: Making Internet Gaming Easy. After trying every internet game network, we found HEAT.NET had the easiest start-up: Log on to HEAT.NET, get the free HEAT software and play free, OR purchase the retail box (includes six months' premium membership. HEAT CD with games and internet access from MCI). HEAT.NET's simplified start-up process will jump-start world peace by allowing people to start diverting their aggressive urges away from reality immediately! NETWORK STUX-UNIT. POINT #2: Creating The Fastest Internet Gaming Experience. We found that HEAT.NET delivers the fastest, smoothest gameplay on the net. With the new millennium and the threat of Armageddon looming, the faster every human can purge their evil Reptilian Complex buildup, the better for all of us! POINT #3: Making HEAT.NET Compatible With Nearly Every Multi-Player PC Game. Nearly every aggression-intensive game out there can be played on HEAT.NET! We played some of our favorites, like Quake,\" WarCraft Iland Scud: Industrial Evolution, as well as games designed exclusively for HEAT, like Death Drome.\" Alien Race\" and Net Fighter, plus some intense HEAT-only Quake Mods. This wide range of Reptilian Complex outlets puts the power of peace into the hands of the masses! Soud: Industrial Evolution     POINT #4: Rewarding Cyber-Aggression With Points And Prizes. We found that HEAT is the ONLY internet game network where aggression is rewarded with frequent player points (they call Degrees) that can be redeemed for prizes. What an idea! If people play more often, they will quell aggressive urges more often and decrease real-life aggression more often. We believe HEAT.NET should win the Nobel Peace Prize for this point alone! POINT #5: Creating Competition With Ladders And Events. The ability to compete against the best players for prizes in automated, secure events and rise to the top creates an environment for Optimum Diversion Release (ODR), or the release of the most aggressive Reptilian urges, and the attainment of individual peace—which we believe will lead to a greater world peace!

"LETTERS personality. Then, perhaps, we'll see games that go much deeper than shoot-'em-ups. both the Butcher quest and the Lcoric quest (so it seems the completion of one is not a prerequisite for the granting of the next), but now we can't get the latter back. If you could tell us that we don't have to re-solve every quest in order to go on with the game, and give us a hint as to how to proceed, it would help keep us from giving up on what otherwise seems like a great game. Eric Hill from the Internet CURSE OF DIABLO A friend of mine and I recently purchased a couple of copies of DIABLO, based mostly on CGW's reviews, and we must agree that the gameplay is great. There is only one problem which is really starting to interfere with our agreement that its worthy of game of the year. You see, my friend and I like to play gamnics cooperative ly. I think that saving your buclelys life when he is attacked from bschind by a demon is more satisfying than merely blowing him away in a deathmatch. Well, the problem, as you have probably guessed by now, is the method (or lack of such) of saving games in multiplayer. OK, we got used to the fact that when we die we lose everything in our hands and half our gold, and we even got used to the fact that the dungeon levels seem to regenerate after we clear them out. What is killing all our enthusiasm now is the fact that we completed our first quest (killed the Butcher), went back to town, and then quit the game to go get some dinner, and when we came back, the Butcher was alive all over again! Does Blizzard expect us to complete all the quests in one sitting?!?! I find it quite frustrating, not only that the save game is implemented so poorly, but that there is nothing in the documentation anywhere to warn us of regenerating quest monsters. Anyway, I am not writing you just in order to gripe. Maybe you can help us. Do you know what causes subsequent quests to be granted to us? Twice, so far, we have had The four multiplayer quests are always present. Just go to the appropriate level and the Butcher, Leoric, Lazarus, and Diablo are always there and ready for fresh meat. As for the save implementation, this was a design decision related to play-balance. A cooperative scenario should be designed differently than a deathmatch scenario or a solitaire scenario. Playing DIABLO COOPcratively throws off the play-balance. Making it possible to have saves which allow you to pick up where you left off would throw it off even more.

What each of these games had going for it was a hilarious sense of humor, a well-written plot, and great gameplay (the superb art of Peter Chan didn't hurt either) Now, Schafer is bringing these same qualities to his next adventure game: GRIM FANDANGO. Announced at ECTS in London, GRIM FANDANGO is set for a Fall 1998 release. Tim Schafer lightly sums it up as \"a little Nightmare Before Christmas and a little Chinatown.\" Set in the Land of the Dead, you play a skeleton, Manuel \"Manny\" Calavera, in a film noir-like adventure game told in four acis, span ning four years. -Tim Schafer In the first act, Manny is a travel agent at the Dept. of The four-year journey Death, selling boat and train tickets to dead souls who don't want to spend their Dead screamed four-year journey walking or swimming adventure In the second act, after discovering a game to me. ring of corruption in Act One, Manny jumps ship, literally, becoming the captain of an ocean liner. In the third act, he is stuck in an underwater prison mine at the end of the world. Finally, the two part fourth act sees Manny traveling to a snow.covered Mayan temple, and then back to the first city. Tagging along throughout the game is your buddy Glottis, an elemental spirit summoned from the earth to be Manny's driver and mechanic. Through the four acts, the two develop a rare friendship and bond. GRIM FANDANGO has a very stylized look, brought to life by Peter Chan's artwork. However, unlike LucasArts' previous adventure games and its upcoming title, CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND), GRIM FANDANGO will have pre-rendered, computerdrawn 2D backgrounds and real-time 3D characters. Going into the project, Schafer knew that 3D had certain limitations. That was one reason why he chose a simplistic art form for GRIM FANDANGO's look. Says Schafer, \"Mexican folk art has primitive depic tions of skeletons, and it would be great to see them come to life. I thought it was the kind of thing that would look really good in 3D, unlike a realistic human figure with the low poly count that you are sometimes restricted to.

"Diablo 2 Announced at ECTS in London News t last, Blizzard has confirmed the inevitable, announcing DIABLO 2, sequel to our Game of the Year, at ECTS. Blizzard says that DIABLO 2 will be available late 1998. The company also says that it will shore up the weaknesses of the original by adding more depth and role-playing. Following the aftermath of DIABLO, it turns out that our hero from the original was too weak lo contain the spirit of the Lord of Terror Now, Diablo has con sumed the soul of the hero and added his (or her) power to his own. This does not bode well for Tristam because Diablo, now more powerful than ever, has escaped the underworld and is free to terrorize the earth. In DIABLO 2, players assume the identity of a new hero who must follow Diablo's wake of destruction and stop his renewed bid for power. Tristam is now nothing more than a smoking ruin, but your hero will be able to visit different towns while hunt. ing for Diablo. Blizzard plans to add many enhancements over DIABLO. Gamers will now be able to choose from five, rather than three, distinct character classeseach with its own unique abilities. DIABLO 2 will also have quadruple the area to explore, allowing gamers to adventure in four towns, each with randomly generated dungeons, as well as nearby wilderness areas. There are plans to include more than 20 quests, which will be more inte gral to the plot, as well as W revealing the secrets of Diablo. Blizzard also hopes to place over 30 nonplayer characters in the game for you to interact with and learn from. DIABLO 2 will, naturally, offer more spells, armor, and weapons. Battle.net support will also increase, and Blizzard has plans for more players in multiplayer games, a trading post, and worldwide player rankings. -Elliott Chin >>> Jill Cunniff, lead singer of the rock band Luscious Jackson, is the latest rock star to venture into the world of computer gaming.

"READ.ME Galapagos: Mendel's Escape News Anark Unveils a Genre-crossing Game With Astonishing Al ALAPAGOS: MENDEL'S ESCAPE is one of those unique, weird little games that may not sound too exciting when you hear about it seems kind of dumb when you first look at it, but, once you actually get your hands on it turns out to be surprisingly compelling and dang near impossible to put down. Unlike most synthetic war machines, however, Mendel is a harmless, cute little fella, who emits little burbles and squeaks like R2D2. So, natural ly, it's our job to rescue him. Your job is to lead, coax, and prod Mendel through a series of bizarre, dangerous landscapes-such as moving platforms, electric rails, and hidden ledges-until he makes his way to freedom. GALAPAGOS' coolest concept is that Mendel truly has a mind of his own, responding to your actions, and learning from and reacting to them. If you send Mendel plummeting over a cliff, for example, he might move a little more hesitantly upon regen eration Guide him successfully, and his confi>> Sierra On-Line announced that it is devel. oping and publishing HELLFIRE, the only authorized add-on disk for DIABLO. Developed by Sierra's Synergistic Software division, this eight-level expansion pack will add enhancements and gameplay features for the single player mode to the original DIABLO uni verse. Twenty new mon sters will be introduced, along with thirty new magic items and five unique new spells. HELLFIRE will be available in November for a suggested retail price of $29.95. Developed by Anark Games Studio and distributed by Electronic Arts, GALAPAGOS is a \"Cross-genre\" game, combining elements of action, adventure, and puzzle games into something wholly original. The game takes place in the world of Galapagos, a futuris. tic, imperialist society that is in the process of creating experimental, autonomous machines of war to further expand its power. Such a machine is Mendel, a synthetic, four-legged spiderlike creature, who at the game's beginning is trapped in a lab, on the verge of being subjected to torturous experimentation. dence grows. He also moves more quickly and more bravely through the world. In this way, you really begin to grow attached to Mendel the longer you keep him alive. The only problem I really had in the beta was that it was, surprisingly, way too difficult The designers use save points rather than a save anywhere\" feature, which I believe is the right call, but there's just not enough save points, which means you play long sequences of the game over and over. A few more save points would severely reduce the chance of gamers destroying their keyboards, throwing a raging hissy-fit, or going completely insane. I did all three. Nevertheless, I do plan on playing it when it ships later this year. Like those stupid little Tamagotchis that kids are carrying around these days, Mendel really gets under your skin.

CRUSH DELUXE, the latest sci-fi \"sport\" plays a lot like a boardgame: it's turn-based and requires that you move your aliens over a square grid, searching for the BALL (Bionic Augmented Life Form). There are some nice touches, such as customizing and outfitting your team members with spiked battle armor, gravity boots, and other high-tech toys.

Playmates and Shiny have entered into an agreement with Mainframe Entertainment, Inc., to develop and distribute a television series based upon MDK, with worldwide distribution rights targeted for Fall 1998. Mainframe Entertainment is a computer animation production company, whose credits include the currently airing series Beast Wars and Reboot. The progression from computer screen to the tube comes as no surprise to either Shiny or Playmates. In fact, Gary Rosenfeld, vice president of development and business affairs at Playmates, says that MDK was developed with the possibility in mind of expanding into another medium. This is not the first time that one of their products has engendered interest from the television industry. Playmates and Shiny also worked together on the popular EARTHWORM JIM games, which Shiny then licensed to Universal Television. The Earthworm Jim animated series can currently be seen on Saturday mornings, on the WB Kid's Network And don't be surprised if you see Mr. Hectic gracing the shelves of your local toy store one of these days.

"READ.ME Dancing With the Dead >Continued from pg 42 Instead of fighting the tech limitations of 3D, you have to embrace (them) and turn them into a style.\" Thus, GRIM FANDANGO has a very distinct style, mixing the macabre skeletons of the Day of the Dead festival with the gritty look of film noir. Schafer also decided to use Latino actors for authentic accents-a nice touch. When asked about his inspiration for this unique-looking and uniquely plotted game, Schafer says, \"The earliest inspiration was a folk. lore class I took at UC Berkeley. We had a whole unit on the Day of the Dead of Mexican folklore, and the four-year journey through the Land of the Dead. When I heard about the four-year journey, it screamed adventure game to me. \"It was interesting how the Day of the Dead folklore had an element of corruption to it, how people would hide money in the lining of their coffin. That gave me an idea for the Land of the Dead being a treacherous place. That had a similarity to film noir, that treachery and corruption. Lots of games have tried the noir thing before, but it's pretty standard, with the detective behind the desk. I thought the Day of the Dead would be a new way of doing it.\" In addition to presenting us with an interesting setting and story, Schafer also gives us more character development than in typical adventure games: \"In an average adven. ture game, you spend a few days with a character. Since this game spans four years, the character really goes through some major transitions and develops much deeper interpersonal relationships.\" It is still very early in the game's development, but already the story and art look extremely promising. It has a unique look, a funny and clever story, and a four-year-long plot that allows more character development and deeper relations between characters. With all of Tim Schafer's signature game design, GRIM FANDANGO bears watching. CGW will bring you an in-depth preview in the coming months as we learn more about Schafer's humorous foray into the Land of the Dead. -Elliott Chin MANNY CALAVERA Most of the characters. including the main skeleton, Manny, have Latin accents provided by Latino actors.

The idea is to clear your marbles off the grid by lining up three or more of the same color, before your opponent clears his. If you manage to line up five in a row, you'll dump more marbles on your rival. While the single player game provides a terrific distraction and a chance to brush up your skills, playing multi-player (hotseat or LAN) will really awaken those competitive urges. LosE YOUR MARBLES is fast BIRTHRIGHT BIRTHRIGHT is one of those cross-genre titles that does only a fair job in each genre, but actually is a pretty good game as a whole. As a Regent of a province, you must build up your forces and defeat the mighty Gorgon. The game combines a heavy dose of strategic realm management with a bit of tactical combat and a dash of firstperson adventurelrole playing. You can play each type separately, but it's better to play as a whole package. BIRTHRIGHT has a pretty steep learning curve, but, if you have the time to figure it out, it's a pretty good way to spend $30.

Once the acquisition is complete, Raven will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision. Activision does not expect the acquisition to affect Raven's business relationship with id Software. Id executive produced HEXEN II. hen CGW interviewed Tom Clancy recently about his new company, Red Storm Entertainment (a joint venture with Virtus Corporation), Clancy stated that one of the goals of Red Storm was to bring PC gaming to the mainstream. A recent announcement from the Berkeley Publishing Group, publishers of Clancy's latest novel, Politika, marks the first step in doing exactly that. Berkeley will package Politika, the book, with an interactive CD. ROM of Red Storm's upcoming game, also called POLITIKA. The paperback and mini-CD package will retail for $7.50. The mini-CD allows players to play the first few levels of the game. If you wish to continue playing, the rest of the game will be available for download on the Web for an additional fee of $29.95. The good news is that Red Storm has included most of the heavy graphic-intensive material on the mini-CD, so your download shouldn't be too painful. The book and the game follow the same basic plot. The death of President Boris Yeltsin, in Russia, leaves the country e frundle Tailowy aadr with no obvious successor, and the major factions are struggling for control. The interactive game, however, will allow players to develop their own plot line and outcomes. The book and the game may be packaged together, but Red Storm is emphasizing that you don't necessarily have to read the book to enjoy the game-both can be treated as indepen. dent entertainment vehicles. All in all, though, the paperback and CD bundle, which will be available the first week in November, sounds like a great deal.

"READ.ME Frivolous Patent Claim Causes Headaches News Jasn lawyer representing Craig Enokian, of Palos Heights, Illinois, has sent letters to several software compa nies, including Electronic Arts and LucasArts, informing them that they are potentially liable for patent infringement for computer programs containing video sequences of performances by living beings. Enokian's attorney, Ernest Kettleson, is demanding that software companies cease and desist in the manufacture and sale of these games, or that the companies pay licensing fees to his client. Scott Miller, president of Apogee Software, said that his attorneys don't believe that the claim has any merit, but that it could get expensive if Mr. Enokian decides to go to court Enokian owns US Patent No. 4,662,635, issued on May 5, 1987. The patent allegedl y covers a video game which uses a televi sion or cathode ray tube to display plays previously performed by living beings and recorded on a video medium. Mark Traphagen, counsel for the Software Publishers Association, says that SPA has been tracking the case for over a year. \"We're not aware of any suits that have been filed. It hasn't engendered much concern,\" he says. Enokian's patent specifically describes a device which plays back one or more video tapes. The example cited is a football game in which one player chooses a play for his team to execute and the opposing player chooses a defense. The selected plays are encoded on the device, which then plays both actions back on the television display. SPA is championing patent reform legis. lation currently before the Senate that would give software companies low-cost alterna. tives to litigation involving \"junk patents.\" The bill passed the House this spring, and SPA hopes it will be enacted by the end of this year. -Kate Hedstrom >>Other news from LucasArts: The X-WING vs. TIE FIGHTER expansion pack, BALANCE OF POWER, will be available this fall.

There was a time, not so long ago. PANZER when gamers were expected to worship at the shrines of paper GENERAL RPGs, and boardgamers were relegated to the status of peasants, barely worthy of setting foot in the TSR castle. Computer gamers were treated as an even lower form of life, often banished to small dungeonelles, lest they poison the minds of the faithful with their silicon heresies. How things have changed. This year it seemed that everyone wanted to turn their famous-or infamous-paper game into a computer extravaganza. There were new games, like the sci-fi grand strategy online game from Red Sailboat Software that lacks even a working title so they were offering prizes to whomever came up with the best name. There were several old standards as well, including a real blast from the past: Chivalry & Sorcery. Winner of the PANZER GENERAL II tournament, CGW subscriber brought back by the original design team, with all the medieval Matt Drew. realism and half the calculator intensive fat of the '70s version. But even with all this activity, the traditional computer gaming companies had the edge. Westwood showcased the sumptuous graphics and production values of BLADE RUNNER and wowed the gaming crowd at GenCon every bit as much as they did the buyers at the E3 show. Of course, the many role players in the throng warmed to Westwood's LANDS OF LORE II, just as they did to Activision's LEGACY OF KAIN. Holistic Design group formed an interesting hybrid, pushing both the paper and computer versions of their EMPIRES OF THE FADING SUN, as well as in progress shots from their upcoming computer version of Games Workshop's WARHAMMER: REDEMPTION. But the most significant trend was the handful of computer gaming tournaments, sanctioned and run by the companies themselves. The most impressive of these was the PANZER GENERAL II event hosted by SSI, which had a better competiIRON WORKS tive field than several board and RPG tournaments.

"AH-64D LONGBOW 2 Your Best Source for the Hottest Games in Development PREVIEWS Longbow Restrung The Best Simulation Game From 1996 Is Getting Even Better by Denny Atkin ast year's AH-64D LONGBOW cer. tainly made a splash. It not only won the CGW Premier Award for best simulation, but it also did well in a market that tends to ignore anything that doesn't involve fastaction dogfighting. Accessible to beginner pilots, but accurate enough to please the most hard.core, LONGBOW seemed to do almost everything right. But in their success, Andy Hollis and the Texas branch of Origin Skunkworks set a tough challenge for themselves in developing LONGBON 2: How would they top a sim that everyone already thinks is \"the best\"? ual ground troops (the latter two limitations were addressed on the FLASH POINT: KOREA add-on disc). Those omissions gave the team some obvious issues to address in the next version, as did changes in the marketplace. Support for 3D cards is a must in today's simula tion market, and Internet play is a big selling point for a small, but emphatic (and vocal) group of gamers. In addition, there were a number of minor features that the developers had to leave out of the original LONGBOW, due to time or PC performance constraints. Add in a year's worth of LONGBOW-player feedback and you have a signific ant list of potential improvements. LONGBOW 2 is the culmination of the Skunkworks team's desire to address these wish lists-if the version I've been playing is any indication, Andy Hollis and team may be responsible for nearly as many smiles on Christmas morning as the guy in the red suit. All the big-ticket items are there: a fully dynamic campaign, multiplayer support, mission editing, multiple MID-LIFE UPDATE The original LONGBOW'S acceptance is actually a testament to how well it was designed. Because despite its popularity and accolades, it was miss ing a number of elements that many experienced simulation gamers demand. The campaign, for instance, wasn't dynamic in nature, but instead consisted of prescripted missions. This wasn't as obvious a limitation as it is in many sims, due to the sheer number of missions and their nonlinear ity, but, nevertheless, it left room for improvement. There were other missing features as well: no multiplayer support, no ability to fly in the Co-Pilot/Gunner (CPIG) position, and no individ helicopters, and support for the 3Dfx Voodoo 3D card. Add in a number of more subtle improve ments, and it becomes evident that Hollis and company have another hit on their hands. THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL The most significant change in LONGBOW 2 is in the missions you'll fly. Instant action and single missions are still there (you'll find more control in the singleSPEEDY 3D Support for 3Dfx Voodoo graphics cards makes for cleaner graphics as well as faster frame rates CGW NOVEMBER 1997 "

Dynamic lighting makes for dramatic missile firings and explosions, particularly at night. mission setup, but things aren't dramatically different on this front), but the campaigns bear no resemblance to those in the first game. LONGBOW 2 features two campaigns: Fallen Crescent, set in Azerbaijan, near its border with Iran and Iraq, and Azure Rune, set at the Army's National Training Center at Ft. Irwin, California. Fallen Crescent is your typical, near-future local ized conflict, with U.S. Army forces battling primarily Russian equipment. Azure Rune, however, takes a unique approach, simulating a large-scale Army training exercise. The difference here is that live weapons are fired, and opposing units do expose There are two setups for the Azure Rune cam paign: Blue vs. Blue, and Blue vs. Red. In Blue vs. Blue, both forces use American equipment. In Blue vs. Red, the Blue side uses American hardware, while the Red side flies what appears to be Russian equipment. In real life, most of the \"Russian\" equipment flown at Ft. Irwin is actually American hardware that has undergone VISMOD, or visual modification. For instance, the \"Hinds\" flown in these exercises are actually UH-1 Hueys with Russian-style paint schemes and rather goofy-looking fake noses to give the helicopter a Hind-like profile. In LONGBOW 2, however, the VISMOD is more effective, as the designers chose to use the actual Russian equipment models instead of modeling the VISMOD equipment. While the Red team looks Russian, the performance of each unit matches its American counterpart. Azure Rune's odd setup makes for perfect balance in multiplayer play, but the campaign should prove quite challeng. ing in single-player mode as well. planning in the field. The primary interface here is a map that, at first glance, looks much like the mission planner in the original LONGBOW. A closer look, however, shows not only more detail, but also four sets of waypoints from four different FARPs (Forward Arming and Refueling Points) You're now able to task up to four flights of two helicopters. Each time you complete a mission and return to the MMPC, you'll find new missions assigned for each available flight. You're free to modify these, altering waypoints, times on target, or even discarding missions completely and choosing your own targets. The MMPC offers a number of functions to aid in planning a successful mission. Click the Rehearse button, for instance, and icons will move across through the waypoints relative to each helicopter's assigned speeds. This is useful for making sure everyone arrives on target at the appropriate time when you're setting up a coordinated attack. Another helpful feature is the Terrain Profiler, which gives you a side view showing terrain altitude around your target. It also shows ranges for each weapon, aiding in planning bob-up attacks. Choose the type of helicopter you want to take on the mission and you're good to go. The campaign is fully dynamic, so you'll return from the mission to find the MMPC updated with troop movements that reflect the performance of your own teams, and you'll see evidence of previous missions each time you fly. You can also enable resource management in the game, setting replacement rates for lost helicopters as well as resupply rates for mis. siles and rockets. There's also a «fog of war\" setting, which may prevent you from receiving accurate information about enemy forces in your briefings. Finally, you can choose all day missions, all night missions, or a mixture; similarly, you can set visibility as always good, always poor, or random. CAREFUL PLANNING Once you choose a campaign, you're off to the Mobile Mission Planning Cell (MMPC), a truck-mounted system used for tactical mission THE RIGHT TOOLS The original LONGBOW let you fly only the AH-64D Longbow or the earlier AH-64A model.

Nearly two decades later, Activision has decided to resurrect BATTLEZONE, purchasing the license in the hopes of creating another ground-breaking title that's a little differentand a whole lot of fun. Those who think this is merely an update of the old BATTLEZONE will be very surprised. Though the name is the same and many enemies make reappearances, this game goes far beyond the original. In many respects, BATTLEZONE typifies a completely new type of game-one that mixes action and strat egy together in a unique blend. Activision's BATTLEZONE is an action strategy hybrid.

CGW: How would you describe the gameplay in BATTLEZONE? Goldman: You command your army from the battlefield. You get the intense combat of an action game, combined with the complete strategic control you get in a real-time strategy game, without ever leaving the first-person-perspective combat. We call it combat strategy. The original BATTLEZONE was the first 3D game ever. When we decided to remake BATTLEZONE, we wanted to make it every bit as innovative as the original, and I think we've done that. CGW: What exactly is the bio-metal you harvest? Goldman: Bio-metal is an amazing raw material that actually \"remembers its previous forms. It's kind of like Stretch Armstrong--you can change its shape, but over time it reverts to its original form. The United States and the Soviet Union both discovered it after a meteor shower over the Bering Strait in 1957. This was the real cause for Kennedy's speech about making it to the moon---the space race was actually a cover-up for our drive to win the amms race. CGW: What enemies do you fight in the game? Goldman: Well, American forces clash with the Soviets, and that's just the beginning.... CGW: What weapons will be available to you? Goldman: You start with cannons, rockets, mortars, and mines. As you discover more of the bio-metal, your weapons get increasingly exotic. CGW: How do you acquire new weapons or technology? Goldman: You acquire all of your new weapons by discovering elements from the alien race that created the bio-metal. You have a reconnaissance camera that allows you to take pictures of objects you find in the game world.

Once you select a type, you get a pointer to each of the appropriate vehicles on the topographical grid-map, as well as a hotkey for selecting them.

Once you select a vehicle, a number of commands become available, again accessible by hotkeys displayed on the current menu. You can also select a unit by moving your cursor over it and hitting an appropriate hotkey.

"PREVIEWS THE CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND Target Release Date: November 1997 Developer: LucasArts Publisher: LucasArts More Monkey Business Guybrush Returns in the Third Chapter of the Hilarious MONKEY ISLAND Series by Thierry Nguyen i! My name's Guybrush Threepwood! I want to become a pirate!\" These were the opening words of the game that hooked me on gaming. With its beautiful graphics, sharp writing, and excellent game: play, THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND entranced me and convinced me to buy a PC. It was the first game I bought, and when the sequel came out I bought that, too. MONKEY ISLAND 2 lived up to the standards set by the original, with all the witty dialogue and clever story I'd come to expect. Now, nearly six years later, LucasArts has finally completed the trilogy with THE CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND. Why did it take so long to make CURSE? After all, the first one came out in 1990, and the second followed only two years later. The delay owes to a combination of long develop ment cycles and a deliberate decision by LucasArts not to launch another MONKEY ISLAND for a while. It also didn't help that Ron Gilbert, creator and designer of the first two games, left LucasArts (he's now working on TOTAL ANNIHILATION for CaveDog.) Luckily, longtime LucasArts developers Jonathan Ackley and Larry Ahern picked up the torch, develop ing the new game in their free time over the last two years. FLASHIER PIRATE HATS The new game's graphics technique is a significant departure from both earlier titles. Rather than continue with the rotoscoped characters used in the earlier MONKEY ISLANDS or THE DIG, CURSE uses the cartoonlike anima. tion style of FULL THROTTLE Or DAY OF THE TENTACLE. Thanks to six years of technological advancements, the new art is a huge improve ment over the older games. With lushly painted backgrounds and well-animated characters, island paradises seem more vibrant, while voodoo temples seem more ominous. Some old-time fans may disagree, but from what I saw, the new look of the characters completely fits the theme of the game. In addition to the new look, there is a new multimedia glitz. Expect a number of cinemat ic scenes that serve as transitional points in the game. Ahern explains that they wanted to show some of the scenes that they were never able to include in previous games. \"We remembered wondering what happened in MONKEY ISLAND when you arrived on Monkey Island,\" he says. \"Sure, it said you had a storm, but you never saw it. Here's our chance to show you what happened so you know the A HORSE IS A HORSE One of the \"celebrity guest voices\" is Alan Young, who played Wilbur in the old Mister Ed TV show.

"PREVIEWS deal.\" Other visual touches include such details as seeing your reflection when you walk by mirrors. The graphics may have changed, but the LucasArts take on voice-overs has not. Authentic-sounding voice talent has long been a LucasArts hallmark, although the company tends to use more unknowns than celebrities.

SWASHBUCKLING GAMEPLAY Along with classic adventure game fare, expect a few FULL THROTTLE-type action sequences, such as a fun, arcade-style ship battle. Reminiscent of Sid Meier's PIRATES!, you first have to make passes and fire cannons at each other. Once one ship has sunk, you will automatically board the enemy pirate's ship, Then, you'll engage in a sword fight with the other pirate captain. But while PIRATES! had you pressing keys, CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND employs the classic \"insult-sword-fighting\" pioneered in MONKEY ISLAND. That famous sequence was an absolute must for Ahern and Ackley, and they have brought it back with style. Of course, if you're truly all thumbs when it comes to action sequences, you can always change the game mode on the fly to \"Pathetically Easy to the point of Click and Win\" (not the actual name, but close to it). So even if you do foray into some action gaming, you can turn it off at any time and concentrate more on brainwork than reflexes. And you'll definitely be needing that brain. \"We thought The Dig would take a while,\" said Ackley, \"and then people came on the Internet and whined about finishing it in two days, so we made a CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND Mega Monkey difficulty level just for people like them.\" The game is huge, encompassing at least two large islands (each about the size of MONKEY ISLAND 2) along with a lengthy ship segment in the middle, and bits and pieces of other places. A huge game world calls for nonlinearity, which is a godsend because you're bound to get stuck in many of the puzzles. \"We wanted *** CANNONS AWAY! One of the early arcade sequences in the game has you firing cannons in order to dispatch a good portion of LeChuck's undead crew. NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "

"PREVIEWS JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER Target Release Date: January 1998 Developer: Innerloop Publisher: Eidos Smooth Flying This Action Sim Promises Performance Without a 3D Card by Denny Atkin Inside the cockpit you'll find six multi-func tion displays, very similar to those found in EF2000 (even down to the lo-res look), but with many of the functions you find on the instruments in F-22 sims. In following the popular trend, the sim lets you adjust the MFD functions by clicking the onscreen buttons surrounding them. 999: y the early 21st century, the F.15, F-16, and FIA-18 aircraft, which are so popular now with simulation design ers, will be considered thirdworld fighters. The F-22 Raptor will assume the pure fighter role currently served by the F-15, but the F-16 and FIA-18, which are used for both air combat and ground attack, will also need to be superseded by a more advanced aircraft. That plane will be the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Both Boeing and Lockheed Martin are competing for the lucrative JSF contract. The USAF, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, and the U.K. Royal Navy are all slated to buy variations on the plane. Only one of the prototypes will be chosen to serve the needs of all the services--and neither has flown yet. JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER, from Eidos, will let you climb into the cockpits of both contestants even before the real planes take flight. BUZZ CUT When you buzz the airfield you notice trees and hazing in the distance, the sim maintains a smooth frame-rate on a P166. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS Six MFDs give you status updates; they're readable in virtual cockpit mode at resolutions of 640x480 or better. V/STOL AND SUNROOF OPTIONAL Because neither JSF prototype has entered testing, developer Innerloop has had to rely on unclassified estimates from the manufacturers as to how the planes will perform. The Boeing X-32 is the faster and stealthier of the pair, while the Lockheed Martin X-35 can carry more weapons and is more agile. How realistic the flight models are is any. one's guess at this point, since the real planes are still being built. From a general realism standpoint, the flight modeling is fairly convincing, even in the program's beta stage, with energy burning off in turns, pilots losing control in stalls, and speed affecting agility. TERRAIN RIDE An Su-35 skirts a darkened Allied airbase on a stormy day, the terrain in JSF features real-time shading. CGW NOVEMBER 1997 "

CAMPAIGN PROMISES JSF will offer four campaigns, in addition to quick-action and deathmatch-style multiplayer combat. Set in Colombia, Afghanistan, Korea, and the Kola Peninsula, the campaigns aren't dynamically generated-the starting condi tions are always the same. Once the action starts, however, the campaigns become dynamic in nature, with troop and aircraft movement dependent on the success of your squadron's strikes. You can plan missions from scratch, first choosing a target and then setting waypoints to (and from) it, or you can let the computer gen. erate missions for you. The mission editor was fairly basic in the build I examined-you could not set precise altitudes for waypoints, you could only specify whether they were high or low.

"n the history of computer gaming, no genre of game has captured the imagination of gamers in as little time as real-time strategy games. True, we had a few real-time games in the early years-RAILROAD TYCOON ranks as a classic-but when COMMAND & CONQUER and WARCRAFT II debuted, they became instant hits, creating almost overnight the new category dubbed action/strategy, or real-time strategy, games. And after each game sold more than one million units within a year, a generation of clones quickly followed Already, nearly 20 clones have made it to market, yet none has come close to dethroning WARCRAFT | as the leader in real-time combat. This holiday sea. son, that could change. The biggest clone war to hit the PC, even bigger than the Doom or Myst phenomenon, is about to be waged. There will be no fewer than 40 real-time strate. gy games competing for gamers' attentions this holi day season. All this fierce competition means, unfor. tunately, that many good games could get lost in the shuffle, but it also means you'll have plenty of good aren't due until early 1998. Because we thought it unfair to directly compare a complex strategy game, such as REBELLION, to a tactical combat game, such as MYTH, we have divided the field into two categories: Tactical real-time games and Strategic real-time games. We have categorized, and then ranked, each game in comparison to the other games in its group. We arrived at our rankings by answering a variety of questions: How much did we like the design? How well did the game play? Would it be released in time for the holiday season? After all, we intend this to be a buying guide, so it doesn't make sense for us to recommend a game that won't make it out by Christmas. Since all games are ranked, you'll know you can't go wrong with a Number 1 or Number 2 pick in either category. But be wary of the titles near the bottom of the list. In each entry, we've summarized the game's premise; described the more impressive, innovative, or different features of gameplay, and highlighted any cool extras. We didn't include all features, simply because of space limitations, but we tried to capture what makes each game unique. KILL by Elliott Chin titles from which to choose. Many developers of the games in this roundup knew they'd be going head-tohead with the next WARCRAFT or COMMAND & CONQUER, so they worked to make their game even better. The result is a field of real-time strategy games that sur passed our expectations-games that truly advance this booming genre. To give you a taste of what lies beyond the horizon, we've also listed the more exciting real-time titles coming later next year. And, we've reported on a few new games that are true hybrids of action and realtime strategy. Lastly, we've put together an index of all the real-time games we've ever reviewed and rated, just in case you want to go back and play the great games that started it all. It's true that the sheer number of games can't be good for the market-a lot of good games will go unnoticed, but the competition will force the cream to the top. There can be only a few winners, but one of them will be you, the gamer. How We Ranked Them To help you sort through the glut of real-time strate gy games and decide what to buy and what to ignore, we've looked at preview versions of every game that's slated for a holiday release-as well as a few that NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "


"REAL-TIME SHOOTOUT Tactical Real-Time Games actical real-time games are the ones we are most familiar with-think of DUNE II and WARCRAFT. Here, combat is the mainstay of gameplay. You harvest resources and build structures, but the goal is to amass enough troops to massacre your opponent. In most cases, the gameplay takes place using a single, constant engine: You build structures, recruit troops, and fight your enemies all in the same screen, unlike a game such as REBELLION, in which you build and recruit in a strategic screen, then jump to a tactical engine to resolve combat. Some of these games have strategic elements CONQUEST EARTH, for example, has an X-COM-like strategic overlay to the combat-but since they emphasize the tactical combat as the majority of the gameplay, they fall into the tactical category.

Since then, Blizzard has changed the resource model again. Now, there will be two resource types: EOS CGW NOVEMBER 1997 "


"REAL-TIME SHOOTOUT Creature Features Among STARCRAFT's many features are the experi ence and role-playing elements. You'll be able to carry units over from battle to battle, and your units will grow in experience. However, these abilities won't be enough to unbalance the game; they will probably simply equate to better defense and survivability. All units will be able to carry items in inventory that can bestow special abilities. You will also be able to upgrade units with weapons, armor, and shields to a higher degree than in WARCRAFT II. There will be dynamic lighting, translucencies, and shimmering transparencies for the cloaking units. The fog of war will be blended, to make for a more realistic darkness effect. Finally, STARCRAFT will include command queuing. That means you can issue a unit several orders at once, in addition to queuing the production of units. These are by no means all of STARCRAFT's fea. tures. Though it will debut much later in the year than many other real-time games, it will definitely be worth the wait. Any serious real-time gaming fans will want to catch a ride on this ship. won't involve any resource gathering, but you will sometimes have to use and com bine items. Installation battles will be more goal-oriented and will include role playing elements. In these cases, you'll be given a set number of troops and a spe cific goal. These missions will figure prominently in the story, as you could meet up with unique characters and engage in dialogue before blasting your enemies. In contrast, land and space bat tles will be more traditional grand battles in the WARCRAFT II style. Extras: STARCRAFT will have modem, LAN, and Internet support for up to eight gamers. On battle.net, STARCRAFT will provide support for clans, rankings, and gamer handicapping. Blizzard also plans to include in the game a campaign editor that has the intuitive interface of the WARCRAFT II editor, but adds more power so you can string together scenarios, create variable victory conditions, and record your own voices. enjoy several benefits, such as having mobile buildings and the ability to scavenge resources from hulks and debris. However, they will lack the Zerg's prolific reproduction and the Protoss' psionic powers. The Zerg will be a hivelike race. All Zerg units begin play as larvae, spawned from the hatchery. As you expand, both your larvae and buildings will create a blanket of Creep, a substance required for building Zerg structures. Zerg units will be more plentiful than those of the other races; you'll always hatch two Zerglings from the base larvae, and all units will be cheaper in comparison to the other races. The Zerg will also have special abilities, includ. i ng regeneration and burrowing. Offsetting that will be the hive mind, which requires that you keep many omniscient, floating Overlord units on hand to control your hordes. The Protoss will be the most difficult race to master because they are few in number but powerful. Most units will have shields and more powerful ranged weapons, as well as cloaking technology. In addition, Protoss units will have psionic powers, which will function similarly to the spells in WARCRAFT II. The new feature here is that you can cast psionic power from groups of units. The Protoss have to maintain the Khala, a psionic link to the their homeworld, which can restrict their growth. You will need to build pylons to channel the Khala in order to link your structures together. Without these pylons, Protoss buildings will be bereft of psionic energy and rendered ineffectual. The Triumvirate E ach race will have a different storyline that tells one part of a grand story, which weaves its way through Terran, Zerg, and Protoss history. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, demanding a different style of gameplay. Terrans will be most familiar to WARCRAFT | fans. They will have no restrictions on where and how they build structures. They will also ore and gas. Terrans and Protoss will mine gas by building an extractor on top of a gas mine, at which point har vesting vehicles can go in and take resources. But the Zerg will be able to enter gas mines and directly harvest the resources, eliminating the need to build an extractor. For ore, the Zerg will need to infest a mine, while Terrans and Protoss can mine it directly. Also, the harvesting units will carry resources in their inventory so if you destroy resource carrying units, you'll be able to strip the resources from them. In both land and space combat, there will also be neutral outposts, with whom the Terrans and Protoss can trade for sup. plies. The Zerg, however, will need to attack the outposts to plunder the supplies. Installation combat (the third type of com. bat aside from land and space skirmishes) FRESH MEAT The Zerg are the most vicious of the three races in Blizzard's STARCRAFT. Each race will have a different look, interface, and abilities. NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "

One world ravaged by the galaxy-wide war was the Togran homeworld. Only a few have survived the planet's destruction, but as one of the lucky, you drift in space and chance upon a probe left by Togra, the legendary founder of your people. Inside are instructions for traveling back in time and eliminating the Freedom Guard-Imperium threat before it begins. When you enter the probe, you find all the recorded battles between the Imperium and the Freedom Guard. You must play all their battles and familiarize yourself with both sides' weaponry and strategies, for once the probe arrives in the past, you will have to fight the combined might of the two warring factions in one final battle. Gameplay: DARK REIGN is an innovative realtime strategy game that strives for increased depth, complexity, and realism. Many games in this roundup have tried simply to make them selves more fun or more action-oriented, but DARK REIGN seeks to advance the genre. Activision has ensured that the game will be easy to pick up and provides a detailed tutorial to walk you through the enhance ments, such as waypoints, formations, and an Al you can customize. The two campaigns are well designed, challenging, and well paced, MOVE OUT Here is an example of the waypoint setting. Some of the game's most striking enhance ments are the terrain and Al. The terrain fully affects combat: Units attack better on higher ground, elevation affects your line of sight, and your movement varies over different terrain. You can set waypoints and save paths. And you can also toggle your units' Al, telling them roughly when to retreat and how far to follow an opponent, among other commands. As for resources, you harvest water to pro. vide cash for buildings and units, and crystals to power your buildings. When you build, you can adopt either the WARCRAFT model (each barracks builds one unit) or the C&C model (each barracks increases the speed at which you build from one central barracks). These aren't all the cool fea tures in DARK REIGN, but we have no problem recommending that you try the game to see just how many more there are Extras: Certain troops in DARK REIGN possess some very special abilities.

There will also be weather effects, a dynamic camera, and dynamic lighting. The campaign should be well designed, with some aspects dependent on your previous performance. If you lose too many troops in one mission, for example, you may be crip. pled in the next because of lack of forces. On the other hand, if you manage to trounce all the enemies in one mission, you could ensure that the enemies in a later scenario are robbed of reinforcements. The storyline behind Myth is also first rate, telling a nontraditional tale of good versus evil in a dark fantasy world. The story is so rich that each individual unit will have a name and a history. Extras: MYTH will have great support for multiplayer gaming as well as 3D cards. There will be Internet, LAN, modem, and serial play, but the Internet capabilities are the most seductive of all. You'll be able to play over Bungie's free online-gaming service, as well as on the commercial gaming services. On Bungie's metaserver, all players will have their wins and losses continuously recorded and ranked, allowing people to sort gamers by skill. Premise: As a commander of the forces of Light, you must lead a legion of troops against the might of the evil Fallen Lords. Gameplay: Myth is a great-looking game with a narrow focus: combat.

Gameplay consists of the tactical combat engine, which is full 3D, and the strategic overlay, which has role playing influences. In the strategy/RPG portion of the game, you meet with NPCs, decide which of several missions to undertake, recruit additional troops, and nurse your wounded. This role-playing aspect--with its evolving story, NPC interaction, and branching mis. sions-is DARK OMEN's most appealing feature. The combat is strictly tactical, without any resource management or building, though there is impressive magic. In each scenario, you get a set number of units, the exact amount of which is influenced by your performance in previous missions and by whether you've hired or recruited more troops during the strategy/role playing portion of the game. Maps are smaller than in SOTHR, to better facilitate imme. diate action and eliminate the need to scroll around a big map. The interface has been streamlined and the game sped up considerably, creating a more fluid and intense combat experience. Extras: DARK OMEN, in addition to its immersive role playing and story, is technologically impressive. The engine is full 3D, with 16-bit color and support for MMX and all major 3D cards (it's best with Voodoo and Power VR). DARK OMEN, unlike SOTHR, will have serial, modem, and network support for head-to-head play. G NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "

The humans, on the other hand, have a machinelike interface.

Premise: The inhabitants of Jupiter have invaded Earth, attempting to terraform it into a silicon-based world for their coloniza tion. The Jovians must ensure the process succeeds; the humans have to repel the alien invasion. Gameplay: CONQUEST EARTH emphasizes the action part of the action/strategy real-time genre. There is resource harvesting and building, but one of the most compelling features of the game should appeal to action fans: You can actually take control of your units, move them, and direct their fire as in an action game. Everything still occurs in the topdown perspective, but this greater degree of control adds a more immediate sense of action. During campaign play, there is a strategic portion similar to that in X-COM, in which you have to watch the planet for signs of alien invasion while you research new units and fortify bases around the globe. Once you've spotted an alien infestation, you zoom down to the planet and conduct battles in the tactical mode, using the units you've researched previously. You can play the entire game without using this mode, but it adds a strategic dimension to complement the mainly action-oriented gameplay. Extras: One of the most exciting features in CONQUEST EARTH IS the great interface. You can save locations on the side viewports and always keep an eye on your key installations or troops. With day and night missions and multiplayer support, CONQUEST EARTH should be one of the better realtime games in this crowded field.

However, the resource model is much more intricate and, frankly, more impressive. You har. vest crops, but you also get to plant them. So after depleting a supply of crops, you can plant more and harvest anew. You get to choose which of a vari ety of crops to plant, a decision that will in part be affected by the changing seasons.

"REAL-TIME SHOOTOUT 7th Legion SUMON DRAIN NetStorm Category: Tactical Developer. Titanic Publisher: Activision www.activision.com ETA: Late 1997 Premise: You own a Engine: 2D Resource Management: Yes floating island in the Bullding: Yes atmosphere of a fantasy Setting: Fantasy Multiplayer Max: 8 world, where the godlike Furies-Thunder, Rain, and Wind-engage in titanic battles. Battling against other islands, you sacrifice enemy leaders to the Furies to gain more knowledge and power. Gameplay: NETSTORM is admittedly a strange and different kind of game. In order to harvest the game's resource (storm power), you need to build bridges to the floating storm gey sers using TETRIS-like pieces (a fun brainteaser on its own). Combat is very different, as there are no moving military pieces to command. Battles occur when you put in place offensive weaponry such as cannons and explosive discus throwers, which operate on their own. The strategy comes from deciding where to place your weaponry, and responding to your enemy's placements by deploying counterweaponry and defenses. And since the weapons act independently, you have to take into account the capabilities, intelligence, and preferences of each piece before you place it. The object of battle is to carve a path to the enemy priest, whom you capture and sacrifice to the Furies to gain hidden knowledge (read: additional buildings and units). On the down side, hard-core wargamers might feel cheated by not being able to command stationary units and may be dismayed at their attack procedures. Extras: The design of NETSTORM, while different, is fresh and fun. It's also perfect for Internet play. Hundreds of gamers will be able to play over active.net (Activision's online gaming service) in dozens of arenas, each with multiple islands that can support eight gamers in a single deathmatch. NETSTORM will also have an RPG-like aspect, with the islands growing in level and the priests growing in knowledge.

Gameplay: 7TH LEGION is a fast and fun real-time strategy game with a fresh take on the genre. You must build structures and armies to battle your opponent, but there is no resource management. Of course, buildings and troops cost money, but the way to get cash is to kill, not harvest. For every kill you make, you earn cash. The more powerful the opponent, the more money you get. You can then use your cash to build factories and barracks. This dynamic means that no one ever has to quit in frustration when they run out of money; all you need do is go on a killing spree and you're solvent again, with money available for creating a bigger army. The interface is one of the most intuitive in our roundup. In addition, gamers can specify unit behavior, such as how far to pursue opponents and to what degree orders to move will be dis. obeyed in favor of firing back at encountered opponents. Extras: Playing cards add another twist to the gameplay in 7TH LEGION. These special items are found about the map and are placed in a hand at the top of the screen. When you play a card, a special effect will ensue. There are numerous cards, with a plethora of effects, from healing to berserker bonuses to instant destruction of all troops (including your own). 7TH LEGION will have LAN, modem, and serial support, as well as Internet play.

"REAL-TIME SHOOTOUT Real-Time Horizon A Glance at the Upcoming Fourth-Generation Titles of 1998 JAGGED ALLIANCE 2 Then question on gamers' minds is \"What about WARCRAFT III and C&C 2?\" Most games covered in our roundup are Christmas 1997 or early 1998 releases. There are, however, many more real-time strategy games in develop ment for later next year, and this is where WC III, C&C 2, and a few other games fall. Interplay has another game, tentatively titled DEAD SPACE, due out in early to mid-1998. This one includes real-time battles in space and on planet surfaces with fully customizable ships and units. Newcomer Soundsource Interactive will release an \"aliens vs. humans\" real-time game in early 1998 as well. EA will follow KKND XTREME with KKND 2 sometime in the spring. Mid 1998 The most promising early title in the works is Sir-Tech's JAGGED ALLIANCE 2, which will offer turn-based and real-time gameplay. There will be more mercenaries and more tactical depth, along with multiplayer support and improved graph ics. Look for it in April 1998. Interplay will release MAX 2 in the early part of the year. This sequel will offer real-time play in addition to turn-based and simultaneous play. It will also feature 16-bit color, updat: ed graphics, streamlined gameplay for easier real-time gam ing, and aliens. Late 1998 Westwood plans to release the third C&C game, COMMAND & CONQUER 2: TIBERIUN Sun, in the summer of 1998. Not much is known, but Westwood intends to create a whole new engine for the game (probably 3D), as well as take the battle into the future of the first C&C game. We'll have a preview of the game as soon as we hear more. ION Storm and Todd Porter plan to release their real-time strategy game, DOPPLEGANGER, in mid-1998. In late 1998, 3DO is slated to release THIRD DOMINION, which will be a top-down strategy game with a 3D engine. Also coming in late 1998 are Interplay's Star Trek real-time game, STAR FLEET COMMAND, set in the classic Trek era, and CONQUEST OF THE NEW WORLD II, which is moving to real-time. WARCRAFT III is slated for an early 1999 release, so don't hold your breath. It will pick up where WARCRAFT ADVENTURES leaves off. Apart from that, Blizzard isn't talking.

Gameplay: What makes EXTREME TACTICS stand apart is that you can completely customize the game's units and Al. As in most other real-time strats, you start with a central construction yard unit, and churn out units for resource hunting and defense. You can produce cookie cutter units, but you can also-unlike in most other gamesdesign your own units from scratch, using a number of basic chassis and a wide variety of weapons, defenses, and special equip. ment. The number of possible variations is immense, and the components tend to foster balanced designs, thus preventing run away killers. You can likewise configure your units' Al--including when to retreat, how far to pursue enemies, and how to target oppo nents-and rename these config urations to personalize your army. There is no structure building in the game, though there is resource gath. ering. The resources are energy and metal, the latter of which you get from natural desposits or by scavenging scrap metal from destroyed vehicles. Extras: In addition to eight-player LAN support, EXTREME TACTICs will have a skirmish mode for one player deathmatches against computer foes. The game's terrain is 3D, while the units are 2D sprites. The terrain, though, does not seem to be as tactically influential as that in DARK REIGN or TOTAL ANNIHILATION, in which the 3D terrain governs everything from line-of-sight to firing bonuses.

The aliens living there, the Lux, slaughter the human colonies, leaving only a few survivors. As the leader of the surviving humans, you must battle the aliens and retake Adhara 3. Gameplay: ADHARA 3 is a realtime game striving for increased realism. There is no resource management or unit creation. Instead, you start with a handful of survivors and must use them as engineers or soldiers. In order to grow, you must find captured humans and free them, thus increasing your army's size. To gain additional technology and weaponry, you have to capture abandoned buildings or those already held by the Lux. If you don't have appropriate buildings for your scenario, you can convert them to more useful structures with the help of engineers. The only things you can build are makeshift walls, bridges, and other simple structures. This type of gameplay adds realism and fosters the feeling that missions are real-life surgical strikes to infiltrate enemy camps or reclaim lost settlements. The game will have both day and night missions. In fact, because the plantlike aliens are strongest during daylight, many missions will have to be conducted during the dead of night. In all sce narios, the sun will rise and set, so during a given mission, you might wait until nighttime before moving into enemy camps. Extras: ADHARA 3 will have an extensive plot fleshed out by ani. mated cut scenes. The art is unique among the games in our roundup in that it has heavy anime influences, both in the movies and the actual gameplay. There will be multiplayer support for LAN, modem, and serial connections, as well as skirmish mode against computer players. NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "

"REAL-TIME SHOOTOUT War Wind II Extras: WAR WIND II will include more vehicles, as well as the regular ground units. There will also be more air units, and each race will still have its mega. unit. In addition, certain races will have units that can burrow, swim, and cloak themselves (like the stealthy Tha'roon from WAR WIND). SSI hopes to streamline the upgrading and spell-casting. WAR Wind II will include multiplayer support for head-to head play and up to four gamers over LAN. Premise: The Obblinox and Tha'roon have joined forces, as have the Shama'Li and Eaggra, while two groups of humans (sci entists and marines) suddenly enter the world of Yavaun. As any of these four factions, you must battle for your survival and the subjugation of all others. Gameplay: The complex game. play of WAR WIND returns, but with a more streamlined system of introducing you to the game's depth. There will now be a tutorial involving the marines' side. The gameplay will have the same detail and depth of the original. Now, however, instead of recruiting units through your Inn, you will have to increase the size of your army by finding settlements around the map. If you find a set tlement of your race, you can recruit new units. The inhabitants will join gradually of their own accord, but you can also enlist them quickly by persuading them with your leader. If you find a set tlement of the enemy's race, you can destroy it and deprive him of his most vital resource. The resource model is basically the same as in the original.

In multiplayer games, DARK COLONY has power-ups and one-shot artifacts strewn about the map for the taking. See our reviews section this month for a full review. RABKY 21B Premise: Earth has invaded Mars, and now the organic Martian army and mechanized human forces are engaged in a bloody war, with the red planet as the prize. Gameplay: DARK COLONY's gameplay will be very familiar to real-time wargamers, as it is similar to C&C and WARCRAFT. However, the game does have most of the enhancements of real-time's third generation, including the ability to queue multiple units for production and set waypoints for moving troops. DARK COLONY has an impressive graphics engine, with nice special effects, such as translucency and day and night cycles.

"REAL-TIME SHOOTOUT CyberStorm 2: CorpWars your bioengineered henchmen. Each Bioderm will have several different abilities, from sharp shooting to battle hardiness, which you can upgrade as you gain more spending cash. Extras: CYBERSTORM 2 will have support for eight-player LAN play. Battles will be small, squad-level affairs, as you command a handful of Hercs. Combat will thus be more specific in scope, with escort, rescue, ambush, and base attack missions; rather than being huge build-and-attack massacres. Premise: You play in the Earthsiege universe as a powerful space corporation, buying Hercs and breeding pilots to conquer planets for riches and to defeat the scourge of the Cybrids. Gameplay: Whereas the original was a turn-based game, CYBERSTORM 2 has moved to real time. Sierra assures us, though, that the realistic features of the old combat engine, such as facing and line of sight, will make the transition to this engine. So will the terrain, which will affect movement and attack. In CYBERSTORM 2. you will have to control both the pro. duction of your Hercs and the growth of your Bioderms, the Herc pilots. You'll begin the game with only enough cash to purchase a low level of Herc technology and hulls, but as you complete more missions, you'll earn money to buy better technology, bet. ter hulls, and better weapons to create more lethal Hercs.

The big difference between ARMY Men and other real-time strategy games is that you are the larger than life sergeant on the battlefield, not the commander in the skies. It is this \"in the heart of the action\" feel that brings the battles up close and personal. While we haven't gotten to play the final Al as of press time, it appears that the subordinate Al will avoid the careless mistakes we've seen before, such as units that walk single file into ambush areas and soldiers who are oblivious to known enemy locations. In demo games, we've even seen soldiers wait until they attained critical mass before attacking and, sometimes, use combined arms to maximize success. Extras: The game will support four-player LAN and head-to-head modem play. Multiplayer play will use eight different cus. tom maps, each of which will be designed expressly for standard, elimination, and deathmatch competition. The game will also ship with a very robust 3D terrain editor. -Johnny Wilson yen Premise: You'll swear that Sgt. Rock and Sgt. Fury have come to life as you command the plastic army men of your misspent youth in a clever, fresh-looking approach to realtime strategy.

The squads will then either aggressively search for and attack enemy troops or defend your base The United Civilized States will have more conventional weaponry such as tanks and planes, while the Eurasian Dynasty will have exotic units, such as androids and robots.

Gameplay: Coming two years after the release of the terrible movie on which it's based, WATERWORLD needs something to distin. guish it from both the film and other real-time strategy games, The gameplay is much more squad-based, as you control individual units with names and inventories.

In most cases, you pick or buy your weapons and items, outfit a small group of units, and then maneuver them through a level to accomplish their task while causing major damage.

"REAL-TIME SHOOTOUT Strategic Real-Time Games trategic real-time games actually resemble turn-based games such as CIVILIZATION and MASTER OF Orion in that they involve more strategic thinking and the competition extends beyond the arena of combat. Aside from X-COM APOCALYPSE, few games that are currently available fall into this category. Generally, these games have a discrete strategic engine for the majority of gameplay, in which you manage resources, research knowledge, build up your empire, and engage in diplomacy and espionage. Combat is only a facet of the game, and it is typically resolved in a separate tactical module. In some cases-AGE OF EMPIRES is a good example-both fighting and empire-building take place in the same engine, but in these games, there is still much to do beyond fighting. Age of Empires Chat Diplomacy Premise: You are one of twelve ancient civilizations, rang. ing from the Persians to the ancient Greeks. Though you start as only a small village, with just a few tribesmen, you must hunt and gather food, advance to more a sophisticated age, learn self-sufficiency and technology, and then make the full leap to civilization. Competing against you are other cultures with whom you can fight, trade, or negotiate as you all try to progress from the Stone Age to the Iron Age. Gameplay: Apparently, Microsoft has finally learned something about games. AGE OF EMPIRES, its second strategy title, is not just a good Microsoft game, but a damn good game in general. It's a unique, intriguing example of the real-time genre, one that adds the depth and com. plexity of a Civ-caliber game to the intuitive, intense, and multiplayer-friendly feel of real-time games. The two games that seem Victory By Any Means GE OF EMPIRES offers much more gameplay beyond combat, so it stands to reason that there are more ways to win than simple I conquest. True, most games will boil down to combat, but vic tory can be supplemented by economic and scientific achievement. There will be four campaigns in the game, each with varying difficulty, stories, and goals. In multiplayer, gamers can win purely on points (which are computed by adding totals from four categories: military, economy, technology, and religion). You can also win by being the first civilization to build a wonder. Each cultural region has one wonder available to build. It's a massive undertaking, but victory goes to whoever builds and sustains it for 2000 years (400 seconds). You can also win through religious means, by finding all the world's artifacts (there are a limited number of carts strewn about the map) or by claiming all the world's religious ruins (a small number of Stonehenge-like ruins that go to whichever civiliza. tion last touched them). to have inspired Age most are CIVILIZATION (which Age cocreator Bruce Shelly designed with Sid Meier) and WARCRAFT II, whose interface, simplicity of execution, and multiplayer support AGE seems to emulate. It's not often that a game can be described as a mix of two of the greatest strategy games ever designed, but then it's not often you see a game this good. AGE is much like other real-time games in the beginning: You start with your town center and from there build houses to support a growing population, train more villagers, gather resources, and build requisite structures for military troops. However, Age then adds the dynamic of \"evolution\": once you finish building all you can at your current level of technology, you can advance to the next age of discovery, acquiring the ability to learn a new set of buildings, troops, and nonmilitary advances. You can bet that your rivals will be advancing, so you will have to do likewise if you want to survive and thrive. AGE OF EMPIRES has four ages through which you can advance: Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron, in that order. You can advance to the next age by demonstrating your proficiency with your current Category: Strategic Developer: Ensemble Studios Publisher: Microsoft www.microsoft.com ETA: October 1997 Engine: 2D Resource Management: Yes Bullding: Yes Setting: Historical Multiplayer Max: 8 196 CGW NOVEMBER 1997 "

When you advance, more buildings and troop types become available (think of it as upgrading your WARCRAFT Il castle to a keep and then a fortress, but on a much larger scale). However, when you advance to a new age, you gain more than just new buildings and troops. You acquire additional trappings of civ. ilization. In the Tool Age, you'll learn how to build farms for self-sufficient food harvesting, and develop various technologies, such as the plow for better farming and the wheel for faster unit movement. During the Iron Age, you'll be able to research writing (which expedites the sharing of map knowledge between cultures) and government. The technologies are a good mix between military and nonmilitary achievements. For example, you'll research better tools in order to make rock and gold mining more efficient, and to improve your warriors' armor from hides to leather to bronze and, finally, to steel. In a feature that mirrors reality, the resources you need to gather change as you progress. In the Stone and Tool Ages, you need to gather only food and wood for your units and build. ings. When you advance to the Bronze Age, you begin to need stone for construction. Finally, in the Iron Age, you need to accumulate gold to train units and construct buildings. You acquire food by gathering berries from bushes, by hunt. ing wild animals, and, eventually, by farming (simple but pleasantly realistic). You chop trees Hunter 20/20 Allack to get wood and mine quarries and mineral veins to get stone and gold. Dealing with your neighbors is a big part of AGE OF EMPIRES. Most likely, you'll fight them with your troops, all the while researching more devastating troops and weapons and building up massive armies to wage war. Still, you can always trade with them to earn a little extra gold or buy their kindness through reguTar tributes (though we haven't tried it, so we can't say if it really deters hostilities). The tribute system also allows you to give resources to your allies in multiplayer games. AGE OF EMPIRES is a good game, and one the smartest and most sophisticated games of our real-time roundup. Extras: Multiplayer support for Age is good, with many user-configurable fields and a variety of selectable victory conditions. As many as eight people can play over LAN or Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone. Age will also come with a scenario editor for creating your own maps, as well as with an impressive encyclopedia of historical information. A World of Difference later have access to In Age of EMPIREs you can play as one of twelve cultures. Each has its own special abil ities and each has a slightly divergent set of technologies to learn. For example, while both the Shang and the Persians learn the same sciences during the early ages, the Shang more agricultural discoveries than the Persians, while the Persians learn to tame elephants for military use. The twelve civilizations are grouped in four regions-East Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa--and the cultures of a given region share a distinct style.

Playing as either the Empire or the Rebellion, you attempt to crush the other side before The Empire Strikes Back Gameplay: STAR WARS REBELLION is a grand strategic game that in many respects is like a real-time MASTER OF ORION, though with a more epic storyline and a confrontational twist. The game will begin differently, depending on who you choose to be. As the Empire, you start from a position of strength, with a large fleet and many worlds under your control. As the Rebel Alliance you start with a smaller fleet and fewer worlds, but with a mobile base that begins play from a random location. Gameplay consists of recruiting or conquering planets to add to your cause; building facilities on planet surfaces to supply raw and refined materials and build troops, ships, and structures; sending units and characters out on mis. sions of diplomacy to neutral plan. els and espionage to enemy worlds; and commanding fleets in battle against enemy armadas. You can gain worlds either by stationing a garrison on the planet or by swaying them with a diplomatic envoy. Planets are very important in the game, because the more you have, the more facilities you can build, the more resources you can acquire, and the more troops and ships you can build.

However, more often than not, you and your foe will end up set. tling disputes tactically, in the game's separate tactical engine, where combat is played in a 3D cube. During combat, you directly command only your capital ships (Star Destroyers, frigates, Mon Calamari cruisers), but you can issue simple orders (\"Attack selected target,\" for example) to your fighter complements. If you choose (and if there are simply too many battles to manage), you can have the computer resolve battles automatically. One of the most intriguing fea. tures in the game is the character aspect. Culled from the movies, books, and comics, the characters, including Darth Vadar and Luke Skywalker, are yours to command in special missions like diplomatic envoys, espionage, sabotage, kidnapping, and assassination. Certain characters also apply bonuses to combat and research. Extras: REBELLION will have modem and LAN support, as well as Internet play over Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone for two gamers. The game will have various galaxy sizes--100.150. or 200 planets-for short or long games. There's a unique twist in the conditions required for victory in REBELLION: Each side needs not only to take the enemy headquarters, but also to capture two vital enemy characters.

Gameplay: The heir to Sierra's LORDS OF THE REALM II, LORDS OF Magic is actually a turn-based strategy game with a real-time tactical module.

Category: Strategic Developer: Logic Factory Publisher: Virgin Interactive www.logicfactory.com ETA: November 1997 Engine: 20 Resource Management: Yes Building: Yes Setting: Fantasy Multiplayer Max: 4 Gameplay: TONE REBELLION IS a strange and unique strategy game in which you have to collect three types of Tone from your world by building various receptacle buildings. Using this Tone, you build more structures that give you magic abilities and offensive troops. You start in one region of your island world (each world contains several regions-each one screen in length), while the rest of the world is held by the Leviathan's creatures and structures. You can build structures only on Tone nodes, but most nodes already house Leviathan buildings. That means the Leviathan must contract in order for you to expand. As you claim more ground, you advance region by region, world by world, toward the Leviathan's stronghold. You will encounter the other three clans of floaters and will have to either fight them over scarce Tone or ally with them to defeat the Leviathan. Tone suffers from an uninformative and cumbersome interface. If the designers can offer better help and a more intuitive interface, TONE could be a surprising gem. Extras: There are various artifacts peppered around the world hidden inside Leviathan buildings). These combined with a magic system, create even more depth for the game. TONE REBELLION also features a powerful musical score. NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "

Oro Premise: You're a new real-estate developer out to make a name for yourself. Whether you want to create an urban heaven or just get filthy rich, you'll basically try to create the most utopian neighborhood for your tenants while making your opponent's neighborhood more like a red-light district. Gameplay: CONSTRUCTOR re. sembles SimCity, but with a focus on people. In addition to erecting buildings, you'll be attending to the wants and needs of the ten. ants in your establishments. Building construction is more like that of WARCRAFT Il than that of SIMCITY. Instead of just placing a building square on the screen, you'll actually have to first lay out the plot of land and then assign construction workers to build the actual structure. You'll then have to search for suitable tenants to live in the building and determine whether they will pay rent or have children who will become new ten ants or workers. Finally, you'll need to keep your tenants happy by building factories that produce goodies (such as double paned windows or picket fences) that im prove your apartment houses. On top of that, you get the \"attitude\" aspect when it comes to sabotaging competitors' netitors' neighborhoods. Your methods include mob hits, jail breaks, frat parties, hippie sit-ins, and psychotic clowns. Sometimes these things can be resolved only through combat, adding a little real-time combat to the city management. Extras: CONSTRUCTOR has five types of games, each with a different goal, such as building a neighborhood or taking over the entire world. There is also multiplayer support over LAN or in head-to-head modem play. CONSTRUCTOR should be a decent game that adds a dash of realtime combat and lots of humor and attitude to a genre dominated by SIMCITY. -Thierry Nguyen Evolution Anak FATULATION TITTE Premise: You start out as an amphibious creature from the Carboniferous era.

Gameplay: EVOLUTION is a fair ly open-ended real-time game, as you start from the very dawn of life. You choose from a variety of amphibious creatures to play and then evolve into a more advanced organism over various epochs. No matter what type of creature you play, you must guide it around the world, finding ideal grazing or hunting lands for it and evading or defeating its predatory enemies. All the while, the planet itself changes, as the game's timeline stretches through hundreds of millions of years. Continents drift apart and collide, as tectonic activity shapes and reshapes your world, while extraterrestrial phenomena, such as asteroids and radiation from supernovae, alter the planet at random. you'll play against up to five other players, and your goal will be to keep your crea: ture alive and evolve it toward one of six intelligent life forms (humans are but one).

"MARDWARE HARDWARE On the 11 and it seems to be one indication of the imma. turity of both D3D titles and drivers. Despite the high 3D WinBench score, game scores were less impressive. The TERRAMARK Score was fairly low and the FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 frame rate was simply mediocre. Overall, the Revolution 3D is quite a speedy Windows card, and may be a dandy card for CAD or publishing applications, but its game performance is just a little slower than we'd like to see.

The net result was a number of near-shipping or very late beta cards (mostly driversthe hardware was solid). So to be fair, we're dividing this roundup into three sections: cards that were shipping (or about to hit the street) when we tested them in August, cards that are shipping now, as you read this, and cards that are out there on the horizon. The next few cards were actually in or on their way to store shelves when we reviewed them. Jaton Blaze 30 Ultimate This low-cost card offers a slew of bells and whistles (TV-out, optional video capture, and TV tuner add-ons). Based on the Trident 975 2D/3D accelerator, the Blaze 3D boasts a wide assortment of 3D image-enhancement features. This card shows how much 3D cards have advanced-last year, the Blaze 3D would have been near the top of the heap, but now it's near the bottom.

Okay, so that's an exaggeration. It did, however, post the single fastest 3D WinBench score in the roundup-a blistering 136. Benchmarks don't tell the whole story, though. Direct3D games ran very, very fast as well. The only fly in the ointment was a page fault generated in the beta version of FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98. probably due to a driver bug. The Viper's TERRAMARK Score was among the leaders and it generated the fastest Moto RACER frame rate tested. This card is no slouch at 2D either, generating the highest true-color WinBench 97 score and a very close second at 16-bit color. VGA and SVGA-graphics were stellar as well, cranking out a startling average of 17.771ps on QUAKE's TimeDemos (at 640x480). About the only downside to the onboard RIVA 128 chip is that it's limited to 4MB of RAM, though the RIVA supports a special DMA mode that allows it to rapidly retrieve textures from the main memory.

And the word is good. * ** * While the Intense 3D INTENSE 2 Voodoo isn't Voodoo quite as fast as the Hercules Stingray 128, DYNAMITED/GL TO How We Tested hile it was tempting to use the latest Pentium II sys tems for the testing, we chose instead to use the latest incarnation of CGW's budget gamning rig. The system uses an ASUS TX97-XE motherboard (430TX chipset), P55C/200 (Pentium with MMX Technology), 32MB of SDRAM, a 3.2GB EIDE hard-disk, and a Panasonic 24x CD-ROM drive. The monitor was a 19-inch Hitachi 751. We ran a total of four synthetic benchmarks: 3D WinBench 97 to test raw Direct3D rendering performance; WinBench 97 Business Graphics WinMark at two resolutions (1024x768x16 and 800x600x32): Eidos Interactive's TERRAMARK benchmark (based on their Direct3D game TERRACIDE): and the CBench SVGA-graphics benchmark. With TERRACIDE, we measured the frame rate at the opening of the first save game that comes with the demo. We also used several Direct3D game titles that had performance metrics (such as frame-rate counters) built into them. These included Electronic Arts' Moto RACER and a release candidate version of Microsoft FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98. In Moto MOTO RACER FR 3D WinBench 97 1 33 MS FLIGHT SIM 98 Demo TERRAMARK Init.

To test DirectDraw performance, we used WinQUAKE (specifying the -nowindirect option to force DirectDraw usage) and averaged the three Time Demo tests at 640x480.

While we'll comment on performance in a general way, we decided against publishing benchmark scores in order to be fair. We'll revisit the performance of these products when they ship. Jazz, Adrenaline Rush 3D The Adrenaline Rush is yet another Voodoo Rush card using the Alliant Promotion AT3D chip for 2D acceleration. Jazz supplied us with a production card and beta drivers that were pretty close to shipping quality, although the Windows 2D per formance needed some fine tuning. The 3D perfor mance was pretty much what we've come to expect for Voodoo Rush. At a street price of $215 for a 6MB card, this is currently the lowest priced 6MB Voodoo Rush part to hit the market. Bundle information wasn't final at ATI's last efforts in the 3D game, the Rage and Rage Il chips, met with mixed reviews, particularly when it came to 3D performance. Based on our preliminary testing, ATI should probably win an award for most improved chip design. The Rage Pro is much faster in 3D than the Rage II, even with the early drivers-and ATI has indicated that the best is yet to come. The Rage Pro has a much more robust set of 3D image-enhancement features than the Rage II, as well as some inter esting features, such as true 2X sideband support for AGP and a 4KB texel cache. The proof is in the numbers: In running 3D WinBench's Large Texture test, the beta AGP version of Xpert @ Play's frame rate was 8X that of the PCI version. And while games won't neces. sarily see that kind of delta running on the AGP version of this part, it shows that AGP can make a very palpable difference. ATI has joined the VESA-graphics acceler ation bandwagon, linking VESA 2.0 fea tures directly to the accelerator, which makes for fast DOS SVGA-graphics per formance.

Based on the long-awaited Rendition V2200 chip, the 3D performance looked very good using very early drivers. Hercules has paired up the V2200 with 8ns SGRAM. The card will have both TV-out and video inputs. Initial Windows performance was ho-hum, but DOS SVGA-graphics scores looked good. And true to Rendition's form, Thriller's initial 3D WinBench 97 performance (running beta drivers) is on par with the RIVA 128 boards we looked at, and Hercules may be able to wring a little more 3D performance out of the chip yet. The V2200 is backward compatible with the V1000, but some titles may need to be updated (VQUAKE, for instance) The overall Direct3D performance looked very balanced and solid; we're eagerly awaiting the final drivers.

Price: $199 Contact: Videologic (800) 578 5644 www.videologic.com ince our debut of 3D WinBench 97 at CGDC earlier this year, it has quickly become the industry standard for evaluating Direct3D performance. The Ziff-Davis Benchmark Operation (ZDBOp), a sisby Mark L. Van Name ter organization to CGW. designed 3D WinBench 97 and Bill Catchings to employ not only scenes like those in current games but also more complex and rich scenes such as those that next year's games will feature. The benchmark's main score, the 3D WinMark 97takes into account both performance and capability features. 3D WinBench produces this score by displaying a series of ten scenes that vary in both complexity (900-6,300 triangles drawn per frame) and in the rendering options they employ. In some scenes, the benchmark uses only a minimal set of quality options: point-sampling, perspective correction, and Z-buffering. In other scenes, it applies more demanding quality options, such as bilinear filtering, fog. specular highlighting, and MIP-mapping. Direct3D drivers may claim to provide a 3D rendering feature but actually not do it correctly or even not do it at all. 3D WinBench 97 provides a way to show how a scene should appear if an accelerator implements the associated feature(s) correctly. If the accelerator renders a scene incorrectly, 3D WinBench 97 will use the Direct3D software emulator rather than the much faster hardware acceleration for that scene. 3D WinBench determines the frame rate for each scene and then takes the average of the 10 individual frame rates and scales it to the score of a baseline machine to produce the 3D WinMark 97. Higher 3D WinMark scores are better than lower scores-but be aware that because the score's calculation includes quality factors, the score is a measure of overall 3D ability rather than simply a frames-per-second performance metric. 3D WinBench 97 also provides many other tools for exploring 3D performance. You can look at the frame rates for individual scenes or check triangle or fill rates to validate vendor claims. To aid in testing AGP ZDBOp recently made available a scene with more than 5MB of textures (see AGP sidebar). You can download this scene, as well as the rest of 3D WinBench 97, from www.zdbop.com.

Initial growth Gaming ou've been wanting to go online and get immersed in gam. ing, but you're discouraged by what you hear: Some peo ple consider the online-gaming mar. ket to be a real mess. Initial growth predictions about online gaming seem to have been wildly optimistic. Getting games up and running can still be a major hassle. And it seems that just when the online gaming services find ways to address latency delays, the Internet gets more bogged down from steadily increas. ing traffic. Even the games that claim to be point-and-click and ready out of the box for Net play often require you to learn about esoterica such as IP addresses. Last year, the pundits jumped on the bandwagon and proclaimed online gam: ing to be the future; this year they're ready to pronounce the genre stillborn. Despite all these issues, don't stick to solo gaming and using your modem just to read email and browse Uma Thurman Web pages. It's true that online gaming is still a nascent science-that you're more likely than not to hit a few roadblocks as you play-but the effort is worth it. Real human opponents offer an unpre. dictable playing style that even the best artificial-intelligence foes can't match. And while you feel a sense of accomplishment when you send a computer opponent into retreat, it can't match the sheer exhilaration of defeating a human foe. As for ease of use, we're seeing almost daily progress in making connecting to online games a smoother process Seeing the Sites Because so many online game sites offer play free of charge-requiring only that you have an Internet account and perhaps the boxed copy of the game you wish to play-the most perplexing dilemma isn't whether to try online gaming, but rather where to start. No matter what genre of game you're interested in-real-time strategy, simulation, role playing, sports, or even puzzles and adventures-you'll find more than enough outlets for your gaming Jones on the Net. Just as there are many genres of games available for online play, so are there numerous types of gaming services. Various Internet-based services offer pay by the hour, monthly fee, and free games, or a combination thereof. Stand-alone online games also offer a variety of pricing options and are frequently free of charge during their test phases. And of course, online services (remember those?) such as AOL and CompuServe offer a number of games, usually for an hourly fee. Finally, many off-the-shelf games now include free online play, while others can be modified for online play through the use of third-party utilities such as Kali. On the following pages, you'll find a road map to guide you through the maze of onlinegaming options. NOVEMBER 1997 cow "

This experience seemed every bit as exciting as today's Quake frag-fests, despite the fact that only some of us had 300. baud modems--the rest were using 110-baud connections. Online gaming got its real start, however, on the classic online services. Long before the masses jumped on the information superhighway hype and turned the Internet into the monster it is today, CompuServe, Genie, and a number of now.defunct services hosted online games that ranged from space-trading simulations to role: playing games. These were almost exclusively text-based, but a small cadre of gamers flocked to them, despite the primitive interfaces and the hourly charges of $12 or more. The social aspects made these early experiences worth the price. Gamers could find free alterna. tives on local bulletin board services.

TRADEWARS and other popular BBS-based online games were almost exclusively turn-based, in part because many smaller BBSes supported only one user at a time. BBS systems still exist--some even host games--but online gaming to prominence. Game producers looked at the combination of flat-rate online access and the flood of gamers coming online and realized there was money in them there phone wires. Those companies are still trying to figure out the best way to mine for dollars, but that hasn't stopped online gaming from popping up everywhere, with prices ranging from $2 an hour to the ever-popular free. \"I want n a mplay! Quake ie 10 by and large they're used by folks who have been active since preInternet days. The advent of the graphical front end widened the appeal of online gaming--albeit only to a bigger niche market. One of the first popular graphical online games was Kesmai's Air WARRIOR, an online flight sim that got its start with a Macintosh release on Genie. Amiga and Atari ST versions came soon after, followed finally by a release for MS-DOS computers. Even when Air WARRIOR was new, the graphics were fairly primitive, but hundreds of gamers quickly became addicted to the air.combat arena in which every kill was personal. (Many went cold turkey after getting their first $300+ monthly phone bill, which is why many old-timers chuckle when they hear complaints about monthly fees of $19.95 for some of today's services.)

With a little perseverance, you can be a double-click away from a world of gaming. Getting to that first time, though, can seem like Xenophon's march to the sea. many games can't handle latencies in excess of 100 millisecondsmost require shorter times, The key to shortening your latency is to find an ISP that connects directly to one of the high-speed telecommunications backbones. In telecom parlance, a backbone is one of the major data communica. tions superhighways that ties smaller networks together. Just because an ISP is big doesn't always mean that its latencies are short, so check carefully. It's relatively easy to switch ISPs, but that often means your email address will change, too. Secondary WINS . TCPIPS DUw P romotion Uno detour gateway cromo network O Concel INTO THE GUTS Windows 95's dial-up networking setup looks intimidating, but your ISP should provide you with all the numbers you'll need to plug in. Check with your phone company and cable TV company to see if these options exist in your area and what they cost measured in \"baud rate,\" an arcane measurement first used to measure the speed of teletype machines. Baud rate can pretty much be equated to bits per second, with 8 bits equaling one byte. At the very least, get a good 33.6 Kbps (kilobits per second) modem. Be wary of the newer 56 Kb modems, as there are competing standards at this speed. In other words, some 56-Kbaud modems may not be able to conect to others at 56 Kbaud. However, you'll always be able to connect at 33.6 Kbaud or slower, because all of the 56-Kb modems support the older standards. You can connect to the Internet by other methods, depending on what part of the country you live in and your amount of disposable income. These alternate methods include ISDN and cable modems. What You Need Before you plunge into the Internet gaming fray, you'll need a few essentials. The first is a good modem. Whatever you do, don't skimp on your modem. Cheap modems often fare poorly on many phone lines, resulting in overall slower speeds and lost data. In terms of gameplay, this means that the game can get out of sync.\" When some games get out of sync, they may simply quit; other games may exhibit strange behavior, like being able to aim and shoot, but not hit anything. The bottom line: Get a good modem. There's been a lot of hype about modem speeds. Modem speed is n Service Providers home computer connects to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP for short), and that's your next essential. Picking the right service provider is critical for Internet gaming. The reason for this is network latency Data travels the Internet in a series of small packets-and no two packets have to take the same route. The more servers a data packet passes through, the longer it takes to get from one point to the other. Latency is a measure of the amount of time packets take to get from your computer to the game server and back. The problem is, Software Necessities Now that you've got your modem and have picked your ISP, it's time to configure Windows 95 to connect. I assume you're using Windows 95, because most of the newest, coolest multiplayer games use it. You'll need three pieces of software to get connected: a dialup adapter, TCP/IP networking software, and a browser. The first item is a dial-up adapter. Add the dial-up adapter to your system through the network control panel applet, which exists in your Windows 95 control panel (see figure 1). The dial-up adapter makes your modem look like a network interface card to your TCP/IP software. Just because an ISP is big doesn't always mean that its latencies are short, so check carefully.

The original model was the hourly rate. Although AOL's new WorldPlay service just reverted to an hourly fee, most providers who started with this model have moved on to other pricing plans-or at least offer them as options. Surprisingly, though, hourly fees appeal to some gamers. TEN president and CEO Jack Heistand says that approximately 40 percent of his service's users choose the hourly rate, despite the availability of a flat-fee rate. Many people think flat subscription fees are the way to go, since it simplifies the billing and takes the \"clock is ticking pressure off gamers while they play. It's like paying your cable bill: The rate is the same no matter how much you use the service. Even here, prices vary quite a bit. At press time, TEN charged $19.95 a month for unlimited time, while Mplayer's fee for its Mplayer Plus service is $29.95 for an entire year. A new model, which a number of services may soon adopt, is \"session pricing.\" You'll purchase a \"ticket to play the game, which may be good for one play session or for a 24-hour period. The Internet Gaming Zone is expected to offer gamers a choice of ses sion or monthly prices when it introduces its premium games. Of course, the most popular price is no price at all, and you would be surprised how many games you can play for only the cost of Internet access. Many boxed games support free play out of the box, complete with access to no-charge matchmaking servers. Among the bestknown are Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone, which hosts games from Microsoft, Hasbro, LucasArts, and others; Blizzard's battle.net: Westwood's Westwood Other Cool Stuff If you get heavily involved in multiplayer gaming-and the temptation to play other people (rather than the sterile Al in most games) is enormous-there are some other useful items that will make life easier. One of the nicest items to have is a second phone line that's dedicated to your modem. If you don't, your friends might won. der what's up with the constant busy signal. A second phone line enables you to still have a life. Windows 95 comes with a very useful tool, WINIPCFG. Most ISPs assign your computer's IP address dynamically--it changes from one session to the next. You may need to know your own IP address if you're hosting a Kali game session. WINIPCFG shows you your current IP address Disk OK Coricu FIGURE 2 You'll need to make sure that the Microsoft TCP/IP protocol is set configured for your dial-up networking connection. The second item, your TCP/IP software, is the Rosetta stone that enables disparate computers to communicate. Windows 95 comes with its own TCP/IP software. You use the Windows 95 control panel to con figure TCP/IP (see figure 2). There are a host of arcane configuration options that need to be set up. Your service provider will usually supply you with all the settings for its servers. Many service providers have automated the setup process--all you need to do is run their install utility and all the necessary parameters are automatically configured. Even if there isn't a setup utility, your ISP will supply you with instructions on setting up your TCP/IP software. There are really only a handful of important parameters: the IP addresses of your ISP's servers, the domain name (such as pacbell.net or dnai.com), your account name, and your password. If you plan on using email and Internet news feeds, you'll also need the names of the mail and news serversthose are usually just mail.domain name and news.domainname.

"LOYD CASE  HARDWARE tech LOCO Garage Mechanics A Refresher Course in Digital Anatomy Sometimes, mixing new and old technology results in a whole that is much less ike a lot of people, I grew up in a suburb in the shadow of a larger city. It was a pretty idyllic life, although in our teenage angst, we believed we were living only one level above the nether regions Cars were a popular pastime in my high school. You couldn't go anywhere without someone pontificating about 'em. There were the muscle car guys, the tiny little British sports car guys, and the rest of us who got to drive our parents cars--if we were lucky. That didn't stop us from talking about cars, though. On weekends or after school, you could go to any of a number of garages and find a school kid and often, his dad--peering under the hood of a car, figuring out what to do next Now it's time to peer undereath a different kind of hood (usually beige colored) that lics either on our desks or just undemeath them. Last month, I talked about how a new system might look a year from now, from a fairly high-level perspective. This time, we'll dive into the guts of your current PC and take a closer look at some of the new and emerging standards — and maybe try to clear up Some confusion than the sum of its parts. boring stuff that needs to happen. These chips are the core logic chipsets. The most common ones out there are made by Intel, but there are a few others by companies such as SIS, Via, and AMD. These little-appreciated chips take care of a lot of housekeeping and communication such as EIDE disk interfaces, serial and parallel ports, interfaces to the secondary cache, and data paths to memory and the CPU. Often, limitations on the chipset are the root cause of some problems. For example, the 440FX chipset was used in most Pentium Pro and Pentium II motherboards until quite recently. It almost always surprises someone who gets a hot new 300MHz Pentium Il system only do discover that, for example, DUKE NUKEM runs slower than on their buddy's creaky old Pentium 166. It's not the Pentium II that's the problem, it's the 440FX. Or, rather, its how the 440FX handles the graphics data stream between the PCI bus, the memory, and the CPU. Those in the know realize that odd utilities like FastVid tumn on certain features of the Pentium II or Pentium Pro that bunch up (cache) graphics data and fire it out in bursts that greatly improve graphics performance. In addition to implementing the new AGP (accelerated graphics port) connection, the new 440LX chipset is supposed to have streamlined all the I/O handled by the Pentium II. Another chip that's caused grief for some gamers is the keyboard controller. Sometimes a separate chip and sometiines integrated with other chips, the keyboard controller is a critical part of the system. Some time ago some systems used keyboard controllers that polled the keyboard port more quickly than the commonly accepted standard. In other words, the keyboard controller would check for keyboard input much more often than earlier systems -but the time they had to read the data was shorter. The result was that a number of visible, highpriced game controllers that shared the keyboard port sucklenly stopped working when users upgraded. The manufacturers of the controllers had to make some internal design changes to set things right. HELLO, MR. CHIPS Inside your PC is a handful of chips that handles all the traffic cop chores NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "


"LOYD CASE HARDWARE wisdom is that SCSI hard drives are faster than EIDE drives. In fact, this is partly true because most SCSI drives rotate faster and have faster access times and bigger internal buffers. But wliy should two drives that are identical run differently? Most high-performance SCSI controllers used for hard drives are bus-mastering controllers. If you drop in a bus-mastering EIDE driver (which you can get from your motherboard vendor), suddenly EIDE now UDMA 33 has significantly increased the potential throughput of the EIDE interface by as much as twofold. In the past, it didn't make sense to have a 7200 RPM EIDE drive--the bus couldn't handle it. That's now changed. So perhaps we'll begin to see EIDE drives with the kind of rotational speed and buffer sizes that have in the past been restricted to highperformance SCSI drives. noticeable in a Panasonic CD-ROM drive I tested. I got the usual 70-80 percent CPU utilization at full speed until I installed the bus-mastering EIDE driver Panasonic supplies with its retail kit. Suddenly CPU utilization cropped to MASTERING THE BUS Another area of confusion is the PCI bus. Now, I firmly believe that PCI is a wonderful invention, and PCI 2.1 is a big improvement. But guess what? Not all PCI buses are created cqual. Maybe it's a bug in the vendors BIOS. Maybe it's a slightly out-of-spec capacitor causing problems. Maybe the phase of the moon is incorrect. But sometimes, bus-mastering just doesn't work. Not too long ago, I was benchmarking the Matrox Mystique 220 for another publication. In discussions with Matrox, I found out that the system I was using —a Pentium 166— should have run 3D WinBench much faster. According to the Matrox utilities, bus-mastering was turned on, and an IRQ was properly assigned to the card. On a hunch, I moved the card to a different system (also a Pentium 166). Lo and behold, the 3D WinBench score suddenly jumped a full 25 percent. Sometimes, mixing new technology-a bus-mastering PCI 2.1 compliant graphics card-and an older version of the PCI bus results in a whole that is much less than the sum of its parts. All bus-mastering does is allow the peripheral or expansion card to take control of the PCI bus for brief periods of time, usually to perform some kind of DMA (direct memory access) transfer. It's like the crosswalk cop who stops cars to let the neighborhood kids get to school. Take the trusty EIDE interface as another example. The conventional THE MOTHER OF ALL BOARDS Motherboard designs continue to evolve. In the near future, systems will become much easier to use, and adding new enhancements will be easier. This simplicity comes at the price of extra internal complexity. Tweaking and building custom systems that actually hang together and work properly will get more difficult in the future. It's like a modem computerized car engine-tweaking a carburetor was always a bit of black magic, but touching a computer-controlled fuel injection system is a recipe for disaster. Despite this creation of a sort of virtual mini-van approach to PCs, there's still room for the hot-rod fans to dive into the guts of their systems; talk motherboards, chipsets, CPUs, and memory clocks; and argue incessantly over which are the better parts and configurations. Most of us will never want to be that garage mechanic, but at least we'll all get to learn from him. around 13 percent. In a game environment, this might translate to smoother video or audio cffects during gameplay and fewer pauses while data is loaded from the CD. On the hard drive front, the new UltraDMA/33 standard for EIDE drives will probably have a positive impact on performance. Early results with Intel's 430TX chipset, which has built-in support for UltraDMA/33, show only a modest increase in performance. But into a directory and then run its setup program. You can force a reinstall, just in case an older version trashed your system. FORCING DIRECTX Got the DirectX blues? The latest Windows 95 game hosed your system?

First, if you have an older S3 card (such as the Diamond Stealth Video series) that uses an S3 868 or 968 chip, get the S3 fix from the 3Dfx Web site, www.3dfx.com. If that's not the problem, one thing to try is to move the cards around so that they're in different PCI slots. The Matrox Millennium, in particular, seems to suffer from this problem. Usually having one or two slots between the two cards (if possible) can cure the problem. (It doesn't matter if you have cards between them.) CGW NOVEMBER 1997 "

"***** REVIEW  CYRIX 6x86MX HARDWARE Cyrix Fails to Stand and Deliver Despite Impressive Integer Performance, Floating-Point Performance Still Falters CY by Loyd Case and Dave Salvator Cyrus his may well be the year in which Cyrix almost catches up to Intel. Their new 6x86MX processor with MMX is billed to be a less expensive, but equally capable chip when compared to Intel's offerings. Originally code-named M2, the 6x86MX has got ten quite a bit of buzz, due to its sophisticated internal architecture and revamped floating-point unit. The marketing tack that both Cyrix and AMD have taken in comparing their chips to Intel's offerings is to focus on integer performance almost exclusively, since this is the data type most heavily used by business applications. And while this aspect of performance is very important for gaming as well, 3D titles need fast floating-point performance from the CPU to keep data flowing smoothly to the 3D accelerator at the other end of the 3D pipeline. Also, there's MMX performance to consider. The 6x86MX PR200 really clocks at 166 MHz, but Cyrix positions it squarely the integer side when compared against Intel and AMD, but on floating-point performance, a crucial consideration for gamers, the results weren't pretty when compared to Intel Looking to the numbers, all three chips are comparable in 16-bit integer performance, and while Cyrix is slightly ahead of Intels P55C in 32-bit performance, both are well behind AMD, which comes in about 18 percent faster than Intel and Cyrix. It's here that the similarity in performance ends. In 3D WinBench 97, whose 3D pipeline stresses a CPU's floating-point unit, Intel is the clear winner, delivering close to twice Cyrix's performance. We saw similar results running QUAKES Time Demo tests, where Intel was the top finisher, AMD was a respectable second, and Cyrix well behind. Civen that Intel has radically dropped prices recently, Cyrix doesn't even command much of a price difference. In fact, if you're on a really tight budget, it might be worth checking out the AMD K6, as AMD has cut their prices by as much as 40 percent. It's still not as quick as the equivalent P55C for gaming, but its low price makes the K6 much more interesting than the poorly performing 6x86MX & APPEAL: Those totally committed to the Cyrix product line. PROS: Good integer performance; makes a great little space heater. CONS: Slow floating-point performance compared to Intel; not a good 3D gaming CPU.

"MICROSOFT SIDEWINDER FORCE FEEDBACK PRO REVIEW Programming the stick is a snap. Simply open the Side Winder profile editor, select the joystick (if you have more than one SideWinder device configured), and choose the button you wish to program. The software can handle multiple-key combinations and can differenti ate between the numbers on the main keyboard and on the numeric pad. Note that only the buttons can be programmed; the eight-way hat switch and throttle dial have fixed functionality. Microsofts stick uses the joystick ports MIDI capabilities for communication, so you'll only need the single connection. Owners of SoundBlaster-compatible sound cards shouldn't have any problem with this, but some multifunction cards may not implement the MIDI protocol on their joystick ports. disable the handle-twist ridder support, the SFFP will not work with an extemal throttle or rudder pedals connected.

HARDWARE with beta versions of SABRE ACE and FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98. Overall, it's very impressive, with effects such as driving over a rough surface or an illing engine vibration handled with more subtlely than is the case with the CH stick. The effects really enhance vehicle simulations, even in arcade situations like flying the snowspeeder in SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE; they're more gimmicky in sports and first-person games. Note that games must have force feedback support builtin, or the SFFP will act just like a standard programmable joystick The SFFP does have some annoyances. To cool its electronics, the base packs a fan that sounds like an idling 737 and which is loud enough to drown out all the sound coming from your computer. To be fair, this is really noticeable only when you're using the computer for quiet, boring pro ductivity stuff. Also, while the stick can emulate a CH FlightStick Pro or Thrustmaster FCS in Windows or DOS programs running in a Win 95 DOS box, it will not function in pure DOS mode.

"***** REVIEW  HITACHI SUPERSCAN ELITE 751 ight for Sore Eyes HARDWARE by Loyd Case Windows applications and game titles is quite crisp, and the monitor is certainly bright enough. Using ZDs monitor-test utility, convergence looks good, as do geometry and color tracking The combination of reasonable cost, modest size, and high-performance fealures makes this monitor a real winner. Maybe it's finally time to move up have a confession to make: I don't have a 21-inch monitor. I'd really like to have one, but I have two constraints: They're expensive and they're huge. Then comes Hitachi, with its new Superscan Elite 751. It's a 19-inch monitor (18-inch viewable) that can handle resolutions of up to 1600x1200 at a refresh rate of 75Hz. At $1,149 (less on the street), it's not as cheap as a good 17inch monitor, but it's far less than even mediocre 21-inch monitors. Nineteen inches isn't a new form factor; it used to be commonly available on graphics workstations until 21-inch monitors took over the high-end. However, the prices are now much more mainstream, and the form factor is compelling. Weighing in at a relatively svelte 55 pounds, it's not much heavier than a 17-inch monitor. It's also only slightly larger than most 17-inch monitors, so it should fit comfortably on most desks. The button-activated controls live on the front panel and are fairly intuitive to use. In addition to the typical horizontal/ vertical size and position controls, you can tweak pin-cushioning, trapezoid, color temperature, and rotation. The monitor also puts up a refresh-rate number for a few seconds every time you start up or switch resolutions--a very handy feature The only downside is that Hitachi doesn't supply a Windows 95 INF file. The 751 is configured as a Windows 95 Plugand-Play monitor, meaning that refresh rates over 75Hz aren't available unless you manually specify a different monitor type. With most monitors, this can be dangerous since many can't handle very high refresh rates, but the 751 handles them with aplomb. Still, a custom INF from Hitachi would make this jury-rigging unnecessary. This monitor isn't quite as bright as the aperture grill monitors I generally favor, but that's relative.

I spent a couple of hours cut-scenes that showed how your successes added to the plot. Before I bought X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER, I knew it was mainly a multiple player game. My hope was that it would be a better single-player game than it turned out to be. I guess I'm still glad I bought it-the graphics are great, but I keep wondering if $50 for good graphics was worth it.

Suddenly, a violent thunderstorm rocks Twinsen's quirky village and a stray bolt of lightning strikes his trusty airborne steed, the Dino-fly. Twinsen sets out to heal his pal, and in the process uncovers a plot by the alien Esmers to rocket the nearby Emerald Moon into Tivinsun, thus releasing its inherent magical power.

"TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY REVIEW ADVENTURE/RPG I AM THE WALRUS Among the legion of enemies Twinsen must face is this fireballspitting flying walrus. Goo goo ga joob, indeed. riful keys will change camera angles to provide a more advantageous look at the situation, but in a few rare instances even that won't help children of Twinsun, he will develop his own magical powers, battle fearsome enemies, ally himself with fantastic alien races, solve several subquests, and explore more than 200 locations across all three planets. It's a big job, but somebody's got to do it. The most striking aspect of TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY is its graphics. With everything rendered in polygons for full 3D, the rich SVGA-graphics game world is simply breathtaking, especially when Twinsen is scampering across the game's outdoor locations. Every landscape is teeming with lifeand what wildly imagined life it is. Nasty Franco soldiers (giant hot dogs) patrolling Twinsun on in-line skates, rabbibunny tourists snapping pictures at sacred volcanoes, and roly-poly scientific genius elephants are just some of the hundreds of fanciful characters, all of who carry on independently when not interacting with Twinsen. The landscapes of TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY are similarly alive, with exag. gerated swoops and peaks lending a vibrancy to every exterior location. One of the great joys in playing this game is the constant surprise of finding something fresh and wholly original around every corner. Interior locations are no exception. During the course of his adventure Tivinsen will gamble in a casino, ride a mining cart in an underground temple, storm a women's sauna, leap across lakes of fire in dank gem mines, and infiltrate a seedy waterfront bar with the requisite drunks and exotic Franco dancer. The game's generous cutscenes are always beautifully animated and entertaining If there's any knock against the visual design of TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY it's that some of the camera angles make a few tasks more difficult than they should be. Tapping the Return and Backspace INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY Cameplay in TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY is pretty fairly divided between adventure fare and platform-style action. As the plot unfolds, Twinsen will have to solve several subquests, such as having to find fuel for his rocket-pack. The subquests are tied in so well to the plot and are so much fun to pursue that you never feel as if you're simply running one errand after another-even though you might be. It helps that many of the items you collect come in handy more than once over the course of the game. But TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY isn't just another scavenger hunt adventure game. To save Twinsun, our hero will have to crack a few skulls and indulge in more than a sinattering of swaslbuckling derring-do. Employing his magic ball, a blowgun, a laser pistol, a really nifty sabre, and, of course, his fists, Twinsen will square off against a host of adversaries, including multiarmed gorilla assassins, spiny demons, gun-toting cacti, and hostile aliens that resemble James Woods. A generous supply of power-ups that replenish magical power, health, and extra lives keeps Twinsen going. Puzzles are primarily presented in the form of obstacles blocking Twinsen's path, and many involve jumping sequences. Twinsen Icaps onto moving platforms, jumps from one precipice to another, and scales ladders, frequently while dodging enemy attacks. There's even a spectacular Evel Knievel-style car jump for good measure. While movement can be handled with keyboard or joystick, I found a gamepad works best. With its unparalleled sense of marvel and imagination, engaging story, and deft mix of action and adventure, TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY is a true delight and simply the most charming game I've ever played. Gamers who pass it by are depriving themselves of one of the most rewarding games of this, or any other, year. way to reach the very high exit. Push one crate onto the right elevator. Put the other crate on the other lift, jump the spikes, throw the ball at the switch, and ride up. Push the crate over and down on top of the first crate and jump down on top of the two. In Discreet mode, lob your ball at the switch and ride up. You can now jump to the next room. It's tough to please the Queen of the Mosquibees; that trial by vicious metal balls is tough. Stand right by one of the doors to avoid the balls and go into Aggressive mode. While you'll still get bounced around a bit, you'll be relatively safe and you can attack the balls that bound by until you bust one open for a key. The door containing the blowtron is randomized so keep trying until you find the right door and satisfy the Queen. APPEAL: Anyone who savors a rich, thoroughly satisfying gaming experience. PROS: Lush graphics in a constantly inventive world brimming with life; perfect blend of adventure gaming and platform-style action; subquests and gameplay tightly woven into plot. CONS: Awkward camera angles can occasionally complicate play. RATIE NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "

"ATLANTIS: THE LOST TALES. REVIEW Hey, Tarzan! To add insult to injury, after you die, you often regress five minutes or more in the game. This means you must replay large parts of the game just to get back to the difficult action sequence (usually only to fail again). The claw marks on the sides of my monitor are a mute testament to the needlessly frustrating work involved in solving such puzzles. ADVENTUREZRPG arly in the game, there is a difficult escape puzzle involving two ambushes by the tavern. Here's the solution: After jumping out of the palace window, head toward town and climb up the stairs outside a nearby house. Find the flowerpot and toss it just in front of the guard as he moves in the alley below. Enter the inn and speak with Lascoyt until Meljanz appears. Immediately after, turn left, go forward, left again, and up the stairs. (You have to be really fast or you'll get creamed.) At the top of the stairs turn left, move forward, and turn left again, all the while looking down. Use your knife on the rope and then click on Meljanz to grab the rope, swing down, kick Meljanz, and leave the inn. HELP! SAVE ME! Making replays even more exasperating is the fact that there is no way to selectively save your game. ATLANTIS automatically saves it, but only at somewhat randomly predetermined points. Sometimes your game is saved only after several long sequences of moving and puzzle solving; sometimes it is saved more frequently, obviating the need to replay much of the game if you fail or when you return after leaving. An automatic save upon quitting, to avoid replaying long sequences on resuming the game, would have been a considerable improvement. The way objects are used in the game is also frustrating. Sometimes you must place a new object in your inventory before you can do anything else; the rest of the time, the object either automatically ends up in your inventory or you can tum and use it nearby without having to place it in your inventory first. This haphazard approach makes for some tense moments in the game-in particular, when you must pick up an object and quickly turn to use it on someone or something. You can waste precious moments and ATLANTIS can be very unforgiving in this aspect of gameplay) trying to tum when you can't or trying to place something in your inventory when you don't need to. Conversations are similarly inconsistent in nature. Sometimes they are automatic, sometimes you have to click on someone to start talking or to discuss some topic, and sometimes you actually have to click on somcone in your inventory (if they're traveling with you) before you can talk to them. The puzzles in ATLANTIS vary greatly. The predominant puzzle element is figuring out what you must do or where you must go next. This TARSHIP TITANIC. It's meant to be full of water.

RATED game is relentlessly lincar, and traveling through the world is exceedingly time consuming. It can take a lot of time to determine what to do next. Other puzzles involve helping Seth escape or avoid deadly encounters, either through moving along predetermined paths or through finding and using objects, or through both. Some simple puzzles involve finding the right object with which to open a door, to climb through a window, to show someone, and so on. The remaining puzzles are games: sliding-block puzzles and puzzles that require you to place elements in some correct order. Often you don't get much in the way of hints and you can spend a lot of time on these little problems. Still, these are often fun, and you have plenty of time or chances to solve them. 24 Fortillian can't fix it, you shouldn't be drinking it. IS BEAUTY ITS OWN REWARD? ATLANTIS is a stunningly beautiful game with superb animation sequences. The storyline is also fine, displaying low-key humor to liven things up en route to the predictable ending. The game's conversations are often entertaining even taking into account the somctimes (perhaps unintentional) hilarity of the voices themselves and the occasional puerile comment. While you can use subtitles, there are sequences where important information is conveyed without subtitle translation.

"***** REVIEW  BETRAYAL IN ANTARA DIFFICULTY LEVEL ADVENTURE/RPG Not Feisty BETRAYAL IN ANTARA Tells a Good, Strong Tale, But It's Not Quite KRONDOR by Petra Schlunk Gregor Infornie to Sencroan Goodbye everal years ago, fantasy writer Raymond E. Feist teamed up with Dynamix to create one the greatest role-playing games of all time, BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, a game with a depth of storytelling that was unparalleled in its time. After many delays and false starts, Sierra has finally produced a follow-up to this landmark game, BETRAYAL IN ANTARA. Although this is not the sequel to KRONDOR (that honor belongs to the upcoming RETURN TO KRONDOR, which Feist is now developing with 7th Level), BETRAYAL IN ANTARA is a strong spiritual descendent of that classic, drawing heavily on its predecessor's game engine and emphasis on storytelling ANTARA's long tale is told in nine chapters, beginning near a small town in a land called Ramar. An innkeeper's son, Aren, rescues a young nobleman from a deadly attack through the use of heretoforc unsuspected magical abilities. A friend of the nobleman dies in the ambush, however, so the two youngsters embark on a quest to learn the meaning behind the attack, as well as to find a magic teacher for Aren. They join forces with a young huntress and quickly become embroiled in political intrigue of enormous scope. Suspected of kidnap ping a royal consort, they must split forces and discover what is at the root of the conspiracies within the empire. SHADDAP ALREADY Exhausting the many conversational options with the people you meet is a must to solve the main quest in BETRAYAL IN ANTARA. basic attributes of strength, health, and stamina never change, characters improve their skills (such as melee and lockpicking) through use. Skills have maximum levels that increasc slowly from chapter to chapter, so your party can keep pace with new challenges.

The world map indicates your current goal for solving the main quest within cach chapter. However, the games many side quests are often well worth solving. It pays to retread old ground in new chapters to see if new quests appear, but retracing steps over a vast world also extends the already long play time enormously. Of course, to get anywhere in the game, you have to talk to everyone Clicking on people generally calls up a conversational window from which you can pick topics. Many conversations are recorded by the game and can be recalled in the game's \"flashback mode.\" Be wary of relying on this too heavily, though, as many important game points go unrecorded. As in KRONDOR, the number of adventurers in your party varies from chapter to chapter. Fortunately, when characters move in or out of the party, you have a chance to rearrange everyone's inventory. Although a character's INTERFACE LIFT ANTARA's point-and-click interface is virtually identical to that of BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, but with a graphic facelift.

Some of the objects in the world (like buried treasure caches) do not appear on the automap, but you can make additional notes on the map manually. increases in combat challenges and the slow, but consistent, acquisition of better spells, armor, and weapons also serve to keep the game moving, Nevertheless, BETRAYAL IN ANTARA is a very long game, and is made more so by the slow combat system. For those who found KRONDOR too reading-intensive, ANTARA offers little improvement, although the reading between chapters is spread out over a series of pages in a book. Sadly, there is no real ultimate bad guy (for whom you are presumably honing your skills) to fight at the end. In fact, the last chapter's combats are almost ludicrously casy compared to those in the previous chapters. Despite this failing, the cheese screen» at the end of the game (your reward for running through the maze) is good, if a bit long, and it lies up the story very nicely. One further problem with BETRAYAL IN ANTARA is a bug that prevents your party from entering the last chapter (chapter 9) in the game if it performed all the side quests in chapter 5. As of this writing, there is no patch for this and gamers should look for such a patch or avoid the few side quests in that chapter. Overall, ANTARA is a fair-to-middling role-playing game that lovers of KRONDOR should enjoy, but others probably won't. While it is disappointing that this game is not a step forward-as it only serves up a heaping helping of MOTS (more of the same)at least it's not a step backward in this stagnant genre, and it does offer a rich story and lots of rewards for extra efforts taken to solve everything the game world offers. Le mcdow TELL ME ANOTHER ONE Between chapters and at the end of the game, action is played out by reading the pages of a book. defenses. Using most inventory objects does not prevent characters from moving, resting, casting spells, or attacking in the same tum. Combat takes place on a grid and provides new challenges (requiring new tactics) as the game progresses. There is also an optional autocombat feature. Early in the game, it is important that you attempt to capture and kill all foes, so that all their loot (including food and moncy) is collected. Later, defensive spellcasting becomes critical to protect characters from near annihilation by powerful archers or spellcasters. The difficulty setting of the game influences how difficult combat will be. If your party gets massacred, the games excellent automatic save feature allows you to try again. other than a staff, are his increasingly powerful spells. He starts with no spell skills, but learns them (20 in all) through combat, from books, and from talking with, and helping others. When Aren becomes adept enough in several spell skills he can often research new spells. The game does a good job of automatically researching new spells. BATTLE WEARY There are hundreds of combats in ANTARA. You can prepare in advance if you can see the enemy or when you get a waming of an ambush ahead. Other combats spring on you by surprise, so your party should always be prepared. During combat, characters can use items in their inventory to heal others, or to improve their weapons, skills, or ALL STEAK, NO SIZZLE Even for fans of KRONDOR, BETRAYAL IN ANTARA takes a long time to get into The world is dark and dreary-looking, the characters and their voices are not particularly interesting, the music is uninspired, and the interface feels dated and often counterintuitive. If you hang in there, however, the game does grow on you, and the story is sturdy enough-especially with its numerous side quests -to keep things from getting too bogged down. The incremental APPEAL: Traditional RPGers who loved BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, and others who enjoy a (very) long, story-rich, role-playing adventure. PROS: A fine automap; interesting spell system; numerous side quests; and a long, involved story. CONS: Lengthy and extremely slow combat; a cumbersome interface, an overly large world, dreary graphics, and uninteresting heroes divest ANTARA of much of its potential charm.

"ATOMIC BOMBERMAN REVIEW ***** Bombs Away DIFFICULTY LEVEL P ACTION Not a Complete Bomb, but Not a Complete BOMBERMAN, Either by Kelly Rickards sa 2 5:0 K:0 50 KEO 59 K: OMBERMAN will surely be known as one of the greatest console multiplayer game series in history. It has appeared, in one form or another, on several different platforms, including the NEC Turbographics-16, Nintendo GameBoy, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and Sega Saturn. And, later this year, it will appear on the Nintendo 64. Although the series has collectively sold millions of copies over the years, BOMBERMAN is just now being ported to the PC. I have played just about every game in the series and I am a rabid fan of all the console BOMBERMAN games. Although ATOMIC BOMBERMAN for the PC has the general look and gameplay of the Hudson Soft classic, this game turns out to be quite a different BOMBERMAN than I'm accustomed to KA-BOOM! ATOMIC BOMBERMAN has translated much of the fun of the console version over to the PC, but doesn't quite get everything right. on the grid with your bombs, plain and simple. The last one standing earns a win and the first player to accumulate three wins conquers that round. Power-up items enable players to increase their speed, increase blast range, kick or throw bombs, drop multiple bombs, and much more. BAD DUBBING I have two main gripes with this verBOMBASTIC TALES The original BOMBERMAN was designed in Japan by Hudson Soft, and the game adheres to the Japanese style of presentation and visual concepts (with cutesy, big-headed characters; bright, pas tel colors, yadda, yadda), which I happen to like. ATOMIC BOMBERMAN was designed in the U.S. by Interplay and has a more American look and feel to it. The game now has rendered characters (as opposed to the previously hand-drawn Bombermen) and comy catch phrases like \"cha-ching\" and \"sssmokin\" when you blow up barriers and other players. As a BMAN purist, I thought these changes were about as appealing as a bone marrow transplant, but the average PC user may now find the game less annoying than it was in its original Japanese state. In a nutshell, the object in BOMBERMAN is to destroy all the other players main appeal of the console version of BOMBERMAN is its party element. It's the perfect game to get a bunch of your friends together, plop down in front of the TV and blast each other to smithereens while ingesting soda and popcom and talking trash. This is what BOMBERMAN is all about and, sadly, that crucial group experience is lost in the PC version (I guess that's why it's called the Personal Computer), which, to be fair, is not Interplays fault. A multiplayer game can be played through either a LAN, modem, or serial network, and four players can squeeze together and play on a single screen via the Gravis GrIP, but it's just not the same. The second problem I have with the game deals with its attempts at humor. Everything you blow up has an annoying canned sound effect. This is one of those games that beats you over the head with its \"Isn't this game funny\" rib pokes and knee slaps. I got tired of it in 10 seconds and I'm sure you will too. This game also lacks the oneplayer story mode (present in other BOMBERMAN games), which further segregates this PC game from its console brethren. The saddest thing about all of this is, ATOMIC BOMBERMAN could have been a much better representative of the series. This is not a bad game, by any means, and it's still fun, but unfortunately, its not really BOMBERMAN. APPEAL: Fans of multiplayer arcade games. PROS: Multiplayer pyrotechnic mayhem; lots of multiplayer levels and cool power-ups. CONS: This game bastardizes the series; much of the appeal and well-honed gameplay of the Japanese console games didn't make the boat ride over the Pacific.

"***** REVIEW  MOTO RACER NOTI) V DIFFICULTY LEVEL TERMEDIATE Hell on Wheels EA's Fun, New Two-Wheeler Has Speed to Burn by Gordon Goble TIME 1 person t's a pretty safe bet you won't find many motorcycle racing games down at the local software store. Even if you do, you'll be hard-pressed to find any that actually treat the subject seriously; you know, a title that doesn't cater to the seemingly obligatory farm animal obstacles, bike gang references, and oil slicks. That's all changing now. Electronic Arts has finally released the type of bike game that I have been anticipating since Accoladle's interesting, but flawed, CYCLEMANIA. It may not be the motorcycle equivalent of INDYCAR RACING, but its the most realistic approach the genre has ever seen: much like a twowheeled NEED FOR SPEED. 259 MPH WICKED WHEELIE Moto RACER looks great, but also has lots of fun, realism, and speed madness. onboard or chase perspectives. When you complete a course, expect a slick replay with multiple chase, lookback, and trackside cameras. the competitors a tiny little motorcycle and is more silly than gratifying Came audio is crisp and imaginative throughout: Wonderfully apropos jazz, funk, and rock sclections give way to high-pitched, yet throaty engine notes; authentic tire squeals, and positively painful brake yelps. Crashes, although deprived of break-apart machinery, do feature detached riders and smoke. Fast, sensible menu screens with lots of flair, tons of user-definable options, and a thorough manual complete the picture, one that shows motorcycling on the PC much improved. Price: $49.95 Minimum System Requirements: Pentium 90 (P133 recommended), Windows 95, 16 MB RAM, 5 MB hard-disk space (80MB recommended), 2x CDROM drive, 2 MB SVGA card, 8-bit or 16-bit sound card.

Designer: Delphine Software International Publisher: Electronic Arts San Mateo, CA (800) 245-4525 www.mracer.com Reader Service #: 332 BURNING RUBBER MOTO RACER is the name, and unadulterated speed is the game. But you'll need more than just raw speed to succeed. Your best rides will be a result of four factors: raw reflexes and skill, experience, cornering awareness, and a smart pre-race choice of mechanical setup What else do you want from a racing game? How about eight unique tracks that run the gamut from dirt motocross to cityscape to roller coaster whirl through the English countryside -even a frightening tear atop the Great Wall of China? How about an admirable physics model that gives different rides on snow or dirt than on pavement, slows as you go uphill, and begs for authentic racing lines? Throw in a first-person view that jiggles you during tight comers and heaves you viciously up and down during a motocross jump and you've got one hell of a compelling product. Though Moro RACER events are relatively short (at less than five minutes each), they are amply exciting through any of the very workable IT'S GOT THE LOOK MOTO RACER's in-game graphics are likewise impressive. They're not perf ect --hairline cracks are evident between scenery segments, and distance drawing is noticeably slow but they're great otherwise. The 640x480 textured graphics are extremely sharp in the foreground, plentiful in the background, and sport a killer frame rate when they're run through a 3D accelerator. Don't be surprised to see low-flying aircraft, tunnels and bridges, all manner of structures, gorgeous backdrops, and much more go whizzing by The polygonal bikes are particularly stunning. They lean and pitch just when they should and their appearance is oh-sodetailed. Riders, meanwhile, move realistically and independently in their seats, twisting and tuming and casting evil glances backward when bumped from behind or bouncing off the (sadly) noninteractive scenery. Completing a Moto Racing Championship opens all tracks to reverse racing. On the other hand, the \"Pocket Bike\" enticement simply gives all APPEAL: Speed fanatics, bikers who have grown tired of the strict \"arcade\" approach, sim fans with a taste for two-wheeled adventure PROS: Extremely fast action and frame rates (with 3D card); semirealistic feel; pretty graphics; good replay mode; and great sound. CONS: Hairline cracks in the graphic engine and a slow draw of distant objects; some scenery is guarded by an invisible \"wall\"; senseless \"Pocket Bike\" bonus. RATED CGW NOVEMBER 1997 "

"LINKS LS 1998 EDITION  REVIEW POGO plus. The only hitch I encountered was with the Amold Palmer animation Occasionally there is a slight hiccup in his swing, and the sound timing is just a little off. Overall, though, with the excellent selection of camera views, the immersive environment, the realistic golf physics, and numerous other options, desktop golfers will not tire of this game for a long time. SPORTS around the green. It may have been my imagination, but I am sure I could see Arnie looking unhappy as I rolled in a long putt. Another great new feature is the use of \"smart\" cameras. Eight views are available and you can have them all open at once. Using 1024X768 or better resolution, you can watch your shot in the main screen on the bottom and surround it with camera views from Golfer Cam, Pin Cam, Green Cam, Landing Cam, and Putting Cam. You no longer have to obscure part of the main screen to open additional windows. GECODSOTNO Online Play Intro WINDOW WATCHER The new version has up to eight separate cameras that you can position around the main view. CA advantage of the games graphic enhancements and install the four included golf courses on your hard disk, you need 218MB of free space. I chose the 140MB installation that fully installed the game and left the four golf courses on the CD-ROM. Smaller installations are available, but you may have to forgo some bells and whistles. As I began my first match, revisiting Latrobe and taking on Amie once again, discovered the games new environmental animations, which make the simulated course feel much more alive. As I was lining up my very first shot, I suddenly noticed a blimp passing by in the background. Of course, I imagined that it was the Goodyear Blimp covering our big match! (It tumed out to be the \"Access Blimp.\") As the round unfolded, I later saw a jet going into the Pittsburgh airport and a hot air balloon floating by. Never a boring moment! In another round, remembering the first time I played at Kapaluas Bay course in real life, I decided to try adding the new haze and fog feature. It was truly realistic, and the waving flags and flapping noises reminded me of the constant trade winds. As one of my shots stopped near the water, I noticed reflections of trees and clouds dancing in the water, another new touch of realism. The new player animations are also nice additions, with grimacing faces and golfer gyrations that really seem realistic following a missed shot. Remember, playing golf, whether in real life or simulated, is a series of misses, some less extreme than others. Very seldom does the ball actually find the hole until the putts get short. You'll sometimes see your playing partners on the screen as you prepare to take your shot. This is especially realistic YOU GOT NEXT Want competition? You can set up offline toumaments and keep them active over as long as you like. You can even challenge friend and computer opponents in the same toumey. Even more competition is out there via the Internet. You can compete with up to eight players. While the game doesn't offer a course editor, Access avoids any chance of boredom by rolling out new courses and players on a regular basis. I can say from experience that avid golfers constantly change their equipment and explore new courses. The Tour Player Series is an ongoing package of new players and their home courses. (Arnie and Latrobe are just the beginning: the first expansion pack features Davis Love III.) The Resort Series includes golf courses, tours of the resorts and virtual clubhouses, and so on. For those of us who don't find ourselves in places like Hawaii nearly often enough, it's fun lo experience them virtually. The Celebrity Player Series also adds excitement for stargazers, featuring famous personalities, including golfer animations, commentary, and video. All in all, I remain a big fan of LINKS LS, and feel the 1998 enhancements are a big APPEAL: All desktop golfers. PROS: Faster screen redraws than in the '97 edition; easy Internet play options. CONS: No course editor, high system requirements; inability to shift the player position on tees to add more RATED aiming realism. in the original LINKS LS, multiplayer play was very difficult to set up. The new version supports Microsoft's DirectPlay, making it a snap to get up and running. I was very nervous setting up my first Internet play venture, being more of a computer user than hacker. My opponent offered to be my host and it was a breeze. Once we were set up, the game progressed as if we were taking tums at the keyboard. The chat feature makes it easy to comment back and forth during the game play. Access offers matchmaking services on the LINKS LS Web site, and the game will soon be supported on NetPlayer. Access tosses a nice bone to beginners-there's an icon in the LINKS LS menu group that you can choose to show your IP address, nec essary for Internet play. After you find a game, which isn't really that tricky, it really does open up a world of fun competition. Because latency isn't an issue with golf games, there's virtually no limit to where your opponents can be located. My first try was a short game against my son, a nongolfer better known for his expertise in simulated aerial dogfights. Although not a golfer in real life, his mouse prowess taught me a lesson in cyber golf! Internet play gives any two people (up to eight) an endless source of real competition. NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "

"***** REVIEW  BASEBALL MOGUL SPORTS DIFFICULTY LEVEL Franchise Player BASEBALL MOGUL Is the Freshest Baseball Game in Years by Jim Gindin begin with last seasons stats to evaluate veterans. But rookies, minor-leaguers, and part-time players clon't have established stats. MOCUL assigns letter grades for power, contact hitting, speed, pitching control, pitching power, and endurance, among other attributes. There's also a brief assessment of each player, something along the lines of «with just a little more development time, he'll be a fine second baseman.\" The accuracy of these assessments and the letter grades depends completely on how high you rank in scouting expenditures. t first glance, this seems like just one more of the many text-based baseball simulations aimed at fans who simply aren't interested in joystick-twitching or watching an accurate representation of Albert Belle driving a fastball deep into the Chicago skyline. But while BASEBALL. MOGUL is based completely on the numbers of the game, it offers a perspective different from the standard baseball simulation. You portray one of Major League baseballs 28 general managers. Starting with the 1997 roster, you decide which players to keep and select a starting lineup and pitching rotation. As scasons progress, you trace players, bring up rookies from the minor leagues, set budgets, and vote yea or navy on new contract demands When the contract for a star player expires, an agent pops up onscreen, asking for, let's say, a five-year, $22.3 million deal. Either you sign that contract or the player becomes a free agent. There's no negotiation. How do you say no to Barry Bonds in San Francisco? Or Mo Vaughn in Boston? That's just one of the pressure-cooker clecisions general managers make every year. Should your team run out of money, you can't sign new contracts and you can spend only the minimum on scouting and farm system development. Without good scouting, you're at a huge clisadvantage during trades. Without a good farm system, you're completely dependent on tradling to develop your roster. And without new contracts, Vaughn and Bonds are headed for free agency anyway. means trading your high-priced stars before they drag you into bankruptcy. It also means avoiding George Steinbrenner's favorite means of improvement: the free-agency list. Assembling a cast of All-Stars is easy, and that alone will carry a team into the playoffs. But a team with an $80 million payroll isn't going to stay assembled very long. And your fans aren't going to enjoy watching a couple of-easons of rebuilding from the division cellar. Decisions like these give Mogula different feel from other baseball simulations. Success is measured by having the money, year after year, to field a highly competitive team. If Bonds' $11 million salary keeps you from assembling a decent pitching staff, you've got a tough decision to make you also need to monifor your players' performance constantly, as top prospects don't always turn out to be great major-leaguers, and even stars dim with age. A s it is in real life, good scouting is essential in MOCUL. If you don't rank among the top few teams in scouting expenses, you won't get accurate assessments of player abilities. That's line for established players. You should always BY THE NUMBERS Statistically, MOCUL does a decent job of simulating baseball's numbers. It isn't as exact as the top text-based simulators, but players will perform within a realistic range. Theres also a fair amount of unpredictability built in. This doesn't cause freak individual performances or statistical deterioration in later seasons, and that's quite an achievement, given the current state of most baseball sims.

"***** REVIEW  CREATURES DIFFICULTY LEVEL \" It's Alive CLASSICS & PUZZLES CREATURES IS Bound To Tickle Your Fancy by Dawn Jepsen THE BIG PICTURE To minimize awkward scrolling, run CREATURES in the highest resolution that your video card will support. creatures Ibia is a paradise, filled with lush plant life, beautiful mountains, and clear waters. It's inhabited by cute, peaceful crcatures called Noms, which resemble less furry versions of Gizmo from the film Gremlins. Alas, Albia is also Sinhabited by the green, diseased Crendel. Happily, Albia has you as its overseer, and your job is to help keep the Nors happy, healthy, and prolific. CREATURES isn't a traditional game. It's an artificial life program without set goals -imagine the classic LITTLE COMPUTER PEOPLE, only with breed ing and genetic factors. The creatures in question, Norns, are cute little animals that are hatched from an egg and, with your guidance, mature into adulthood, have families, and eventually die. Each Norn has a very distinctive personality controlled by approximately 246 different variables within the Norn's neural network. A Norn's actions are determined by its individual genetic makeup and its reactions to its constantly changing environment; Norns can breed, and their characteristics are convincingly passed on to their offspring. Your role in all of this is as a guardian to the Norns. In the game, you are represented by a hand, which also serves to move things, tickle or slap the Norns, and to point to objects in Albia. IN THE BEGINNING Before hatching my first Norn, I decided to take a quick peek around Albia. Unfortunately, it's quite difficult to take a leisurely scroll around Albia, due to slow screen updates. I found it quicker to save locations such as the pond, bechive, kitchen, incubator, island, and garden using the game's Favorite Places feature. Albia's landscape is detailed, varied, and beautifully drawn. Just the kind of place you'd want to raise a family. Because female Norns take longer to develop, I chose a female egg from the hatchery, placed it carefully in the incubator, and waited anxiously for the birth of my first Norn. Within a few minutes, I had an adorable baby girl that looked like a cross between Gizmo and a lopeared rabbit. She had the biggest blue eyes and the cutest little grin. I decided to call her Abbie. Abbie responded to my profuse tickling with the funniest little chuckle. When Norns are first born, they will usually follow the hand. It's very important to reward your Norn with a tickle whenever she follows the hand or responds appropriately to a command. If your Nom doesn't respond correctly, give her one slap only and she should become more obliging. If you slap her too often, even accidentally, she will fear you, run from the hand, and eventually slap other Norns. I led Abbie to the computer where she quickly learned her verbs. This is an imperative step in the Nors' development, as failing to do so may hinder their survival skills. It seems that word retention is quite difficult for most Norns, so have your newborn repeat the words she learns several times.

"CREATURES  REVIEW Norn Adoption Agencies here, I coaxed Abbie into the garden where my intent was to teach her the names of objects in Albia. This proved more difficult than I anticipated, and I soon realized that Abbie was referring to me as \"food.\"I eventually determined that Abbie was looking at the hand, not a carrot, when I typed in \"food.\" Take plenty of time teaching your Norn how to eat, sleep, and identify objects and you'll be spared a great deal of frustration in the long run. Since I was managing fairly well at this point, I introduced a male Norn to Albia-and to Ablic. Andrew proved to be very cute, with a fluffy tail, knee boots, and dark colored bands on his arms. I tried in vain to lure Andrew to the computer. It was here that I discovered one of the most frustrating aspects of rearing Norns. The most interesting thing to a Norn is another Norn, and Andrew and Abbie were virtually inseparable. The solution was to temporarily export Abbie, which not only saved her as a file which could be shared with other CREATURES fans, but also removed her from the program. Once Andrew acquired adequate life skills, I imported Abbie back into Albia. While older Noms will teach your babies words, they are often fragmented or altogether incorrect, and older Noms will often regress to \"baby talk\" after spending time with unlearned newborns. n the short time since its release, CREATURES has gathered an amazing online following. On developer Cyberlife's Web page (www.cyberlife.co.uk), you'll find tips, background information, and add-ons including free Purple Mountain Nors. Also here is information about the much anticipated genetics kit which will allow you to make test tube Norns and a Grendel/Norn hybrid, amongst other things. You'll also find links to well over 50 user-created CREATURES pages. Some feature Nom editors, as well as hacks for getting rid of the Grendel for good or making him as nice as your Nors. The widest variety of pages allow you to \"adopt\" Norns from breeders all over the world. Especially popular are unique Norns with unusual colors, brain size, or life spansmutations that speak well of the complexity of CREATURES' genetics modeling CLASSICS & PUZZLES CREATURE COMFORTS Soon, my Noms were ready to explore Albia without a lot of direction from me. I was however, anxious for my lovebirds to breed. Thinking I could help things along, I opened up the breeder kit to see if my Norns were in the mood. Determined that Abbie and Andy would be more than just good friends, I fed each a tomato aphrodisiac and waited. Before long I was the proud mother of my first natural bom Nom baby. Beth had characteristics from both parents and proved to be a rather quick learner. After hatching a mate for Beth, I found I had more than enough to keep me busy. With the ever curious Norns ever increasing their numbers, trouble is bound to come along. It does, in the form of a Grendel. The Grendel is a nasty green lizard-looking creature that seeks out your innocent Norns for playtime. In playing with the Nors, the Grendel passes on diseases, steals food, and slaps them silly. To prevent your Norns from getting sick or violent, teach them to defend themselves. Whenever the Grendel approaches, direct your Norns to either \"run\" or \"push Grendel.\" If you have several friendly Noms slapping the Grendel at once, he will usually tuck his tail and run. For a more permanent solution, entice the beast to cat a death cap mushroom. The Grendel dies and you will have about 30 minutes before another is hatched. After investing a great deal of time and affection to my Noms, I found I had grown quite attached to them. It was then, quite despairing to watch my ailing Abbie grow frail and ill. I scanned the health and science kits for herbal cures, pain medicine, and just plain shots of energy. It was futile. After bearing three delightful children, Abbie curled up as if she were sleeping, let out a little moan, and died as I watched helplessly. Andrew stood faithfully at her side, calling her name and «pushing\" her. On the verge of deciding that all of this was just too clepressing, I discovered I had a new egg. A bittersweet cycle began again in this delightful and well thought out game. I've now played CREATURES so much that my real-life family is seeking an intervention. APPEAL: Gamers who enjoy SimCity-style games, people who live in apartments that don't allow pets. >PROS: Noms exhibit very convincing behavior; detailed genetics model; strong support from the company for online additions. CONS: 12-Nom limit means otherwise healthy Nors must die to make room, a depressing experience; program scrolling could be better TICKLED OUT Tickling a sleep-resistant Norn will usually lull it into a nap.

"***** REVIEW PACIFIC GENERAL DIFFICULTY LEVEL Pacific Vacation STRATEGYZ WARGAMES The GENERAL Series Closes With a Big Bang by Tim Carter 84th Hohel 1940 Infantry Fuer 60 ANMO:7 Entrenchment: 1 Prestige GOD Beach. (13,0) Turn 2 <15) co een XI 3 JOLIE DOLL La la la la la lam dala Veles hen I initially received the box copy of PACIFIC CENERAL for review, my first question was: shouldn't they call it PACIFIC ADMIRAL? After all, low could you simulate the war in the Pacific without a healthy dose of naval combat, particularly carrier-based naval combat? Well, I was wrong; PACIFIC GENERAL lives up to its name. The bulk of the fighting (although by no means all of it) happens on land, and virtually all of the big strategic challenges revolve around land combat and land units. And the game does a fine job at it, too. While there are a few minor glitches in the interface, and while the play balance is a touch out of whack on some scenarios, on the whole, PACIFIC GENERAL is fast, fun, and challenging. It marks SSEs retum to the roots of the GENERAL series with a solid, WWII campaign that provides strategic management and context to a diverse range of individual scenarios. LLC AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT HEAVEN The new graphics aren't just cosmetic-ships move differently through deep and shallow water, not particularly ligh, ils sometimes difficult to see what the weather is like. (The solution is to check at the beginning of cach tum, when the tum change screen will tell you the current weather and give a forecast for the next tum.) Also, unit statistics in the upgrade/purchase screen are displayed using a confusing set of icons. Properly understanding this screen requires extensive referencing in the manual to figure out what all the numbers mean. as the stats for each unit may be called up in concise written form during the game itself, I see no reason why this same information has to be displayed in such and ugly and confusing format during the one time when a careful reading of all the stats is important. What's interesting is that, in some scenarios, the computer does not allow you to place all of your forces. For instance, when I invaded New Guinea (as the Japanese) I had no set-up squares in deep water. As a result, my carriers and battleships had nowhere to go and were excluded. I'm not sure if this was done on purpose to balance the scenario or through an oversight, but it didn't prevent me from enjoying the scenario, so I won't complain too loudly. Other historical faux pas include your ability to use land-based air in the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the possibility of building and using an armored Japanese NAVAL LINT PACIFIC GENERAL marks a retum to the good campaigns and smooth and simple interface of the original PANZER GENERAL.

As per PANZER GENERAL, realism and scale take a back seat to playability, and purists looking for logistics, line of supply, and grognard-pleasing minutiae will likely be disappointed.

(In general, the Pacific was an infantryman's war, a fact that is reflected in some, but not all of the scenarios.) I also have to question the initial strengths of the 414 Wildcat, which here can be found knocking Zeros out of the sky with impunity, and the U.S. cruisers, circa 1942, which generally hold their own against the big Japanese cruisers. The computer doesn't handle naval forces as well as it might. During the battle of Midway, computer-controlled Japanese forces never ventured an airstrike of any kind against either the island or the U.S. camers. While some fighters flew CAP, several carriers were left unprotected and the entire air arm was deployed so badly that I easily destroyed it en masse Variable water depth also makes for interesting tactical situations, as shallow water can scriously impair the maneuverability of your heavy sluips. A clever Japanese player can often exploit the supe riority of smaller Japanese ships along the coastline, and both sides will want to develop a decent shallow water force to provide ground support fire inland. Fortunately, on the ground the computer is much more able. Even using land-based air it seemed to be better at attacking niny air forces and prioritizing strikes against naval and ground units. The end result is that Midway, a battle where the U.S.victory came only through great intelligence, great leadership, and phenomenally good timing (luck?), becomes a duckshoot while the Solomon Islands campaign, which should mark the beginning of the end for the Japanese, is much, much more difficult Of course, if you don't like the scenarios given you can always make your own using the new scenario builder that comes with the game. The construction kit is not limited to the Pacific campaign, and includes German and Russian units and all of the map files from Pac GENERAL, PANZER Hitting the Campaign Trail ACIFIC GENERAL Offers gamers a range of campaign choices, which gives the game considerable depth. For the first time in this series players may elect to play either side in the conflict. As the Japanese, you begin by conquering Nationalist China and then sneak-attacking Pearl Harbor. You later gain the option of attacking the British Empire via Malaysia, Singapore, and India or going after the United States through New Guinea, Australia, and Hawaii. While there is no British campaign, as the Americans you can elect to stay in the South Pacific or move toward Japan via the Central Pacific. These multiple, independent campaign paths add much to the game's replayability, particularly when you consider the unique strategic challenges and shortages facing the Japanese: lots of upgrade options but scarce resources and generally inferior equipment. I have to question the Japanese path to victory in the campaign game: Not only are the battles of Midway and the Coral Sea missing (Midway is part of the U.S. campaign, though.), but it is possible to completely vanquish the United States without ever facing the U.S. Navy. A decisive victory in New Guinea (which assumes a victory assumes a victory a in the Coral Sea) 10 10 takes you to 10 Australia, Hawaii, and then San Francisco, which, POOR MAN'S PANZERS The Japanese and Allied combined, offer a campaigns really play differently. The Sons of single U.S. carrier Nippon could use a few Tigers to flesh out their task force for naval woefully inadequate armor opposition. 10 APPEAL: Anyone interested in strategy games. >PROS: Fast, easy, and fun with good campaigns, multiplayer options, and scenario generator. CONS: Al has serious lapses in sea battles; play balance is skewed in some scenarios; this grand game engine is beginning to RATED show its age. NOVEMBER 1997 CGW "

A little more be doing hard time. No, the most serious balancing of game factors may have flaw in DARK COLONY is the fact that helped, but SSI has already proven they many of the scenarios become a grind have something relevant to bring to the instead of wide open combat, clue mainly real-time table with WARWIND, a game to the fact that the game is seriously stingy that is more original and innovative the when it comes to resource vents. Limited third or fourth time around than DARK supplies can be an interesting factor in a COLONY is right out of the box & ARK COLONY is very stingy when it comes to resources. You must be very aware of your money supply and how easily it runs out. The first thing you need to do in every scenario is to get your drilling rig on top of the first vent, so the dollars start flowing in immediately. Then scout as much terrain as you can, without draining the defensive force that will be vital in surviving the enemy's initial, inevitable rush. Once you get established and can put together a reasonable expeditionary force, always try and seize control of the vents farthest away from you in order to establish a \"front\" that puts most of the map's resources on your side of the broken red line. This initial step is vital, as he who controls the most vents invariably wins. Mines make for excellent quick defensive perimeters around vulnerable rigs. The greatest mistake you can make is spending too much money on tech upgrades for your units. It makes little difference if you have the best troops in the game if you only can afford five units after doing all your \"research.\" First, try and build up a large enough force to take on the enemy, and then worry about improving it. The only upgrades that should be bought early on, before you have a clear idea of how short money is going to be, are improvements to your Reaper/Sy Demons and your Firestorm/Xeno Wart turrets. APPEAL: Fanatics who need that real-time fix, newcomers to the genre, or UFO hype fans. PROS: A slick, bug-free C&C clone that does some interesting things with day and night missions and lineof-sight. >CONS: A generic mishmash wearing a cheap coat of hip sci-fi words and images; poor game balance leads to repetitive, drawn out battles.

"SCORPIA ADVENTURE/RPG Roberta's Gold adventurn rus, fut parmi undertak tion A Scorpia Gets in the Way-Back Machine for a Look at Some Classic Sierra Adventures his month, I was supposed to be reviewing Steve Meretzky's new comic adventure game, THE SPACE BAR. Then the CD drive on my new Pentium failed. I sent the drive in, and as I write this, thanks to the UPS strike, I'm still waiting for the replacement. Since the game is a Windows 95-only product, I couldn't use my 486 as a backup, and there wasn't anything else new available for an article. Panic button time. After talking it over with CGW, we decided that I would do a piece on Sierra's recent ROBERTA WILLIAMS ANIHOLOGY. This is a collection of all the games Roberta has written, going back to the early days of the Apple II. Included are five from the Apple eraMYSTERY HOUSE, MISSION: ASTEROID, WIZARD & THE PRINCESS, TIME ZONE, and DARK CRYSTAL along with MIXED-UP MOTHER GOOSE, the entire KING'S QUEST saga (I-VII), the two Laura Bow products (COLONEL'S BEQUEST and DAGGER OF AMON RA) and PHANTASMACORA I. That's quite an assemblage, particularly as it is mainly the work of one person. If nothing else, Roberta Williams is certainly the single most prolific adventure game designer in the industry today. review those would be unfair, at the (replayed, really), since very least.

The move also brought something that the Apple didn't have: sound. Aside from the tinny speaker and a few sound cards that never caught on, Apple games were usually silent (all the games in the collection are quiet). Hard to believe these days, but true. You can see this best by following through the sequence from the early games to the latest. Spend, say, 10 minutes with each of the Apple games, move to the KQ series and do the same, with a little time out inbetween for a look at LAURA Bow, then finish up with PHANTASMACORIA. By the time you're done, you should have a pretty good picture of Roberta's development as a game designer. That's what the collection is about, after all. It's a tribute to her achievements, her contributions to the adventure game genre. Not all the games are good, but every author-in whatever medium produces a clunker now and then. What matters is the overall quality of the output, and the amount of maturation over time, Roberta Williams has certainly excelled at both of those So yes, the ROBERTA WILLIAMS ANTHOLOGY is worth picking up, for a look at the bygone days when all this was still new, if you missed some of the earlier King's QUEST or LAURA Bow games, or if you'd just like to follow the development of an expert game designer over the years.

"PIGSKIN PHANIES by Dennis McCauley \"Show me the football games!\" Well, that's not exactly the famous line from Jerry Maguire, but it's close. Hyperactive NFL wide receiver Cuba Gooding, Jr. spends the film in search of kwan, his word for that mystical combination of all things good. With a slew of bigname football simulations hitting retail shelves this fall, sports gamers have a chance to find their own brand of kwan, pigskin style. NFL junkies will have five new games to choose from to get their pro football fix. Arcade All-Pros will blister their fingers on Acclaim's NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB and EA Sports' MADDEN NFL 98, while would-be GMs can assemble their own dynasties with Sierra's FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL PRO 98. Accolade has opened an NFL time warp with LEGENDS FOOTBALL 98, which features action in four eras, from 1932 to last Sunday. ABC captures the magic of prime time with MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL 98. Prefer the rah-rah, sis-boom-bah of college football to the pro game? Both EA Sports and ABC Interactive are debuting hotly anticipated college sims. EA follows the action-oriented formula that made them famous with NCAA FOOTBALL, while ABC hits the sports nostalgia road in HEROES OF THE GRIDIRON. The good news is that each sim features a mix of strategy, stats, action, and play calling. The bad news? With a roster of games this exciting, your choice won't be easy.

Could be, as the veteran MADDEN design team has channeled its energy into beefing up last year's best-selling football game. Expect this year's MADDEN to be a more robust all-around simulation that still captures the essential MADDEN virtues of fast-paced, good-looking NFL action. FALCONS STRENGTHS MADDEN has always been strong on arcade play, and the '98 edition will be no different, with support for up to 8-button joysticks. This time around, however, the AllMadden Team will strut its stuff in beautifully rendered 3D stadiums. The players themselves are drawn in what EA Sports calls \"V-Poly,\" a hybrid of 2D and 3D renderings, using multiple sprites for the players' arms and legs. You can view the action from a flexible array of camera angles. MADDEN's computer players should be smarter this time around, with improved A.I., especially among linemen. Once relegated to simplistically attacking a given area, the big lugs now employ more sophisticated blocking techniques to suit the play that's being run. There are more choices at the line of scrimmage as well, with enhanced, team-specific playbooks that simulate the offensive and defensive styles of the actual NFL teams. And watch out for those unexpected blitzing linebackersthis time around the wily computer opponent can call defensive audibles at the line of scrimmage.

It looks like a clear winner in this year's football gaming playoffs--provided it makes it out of the locker room. With release scheduled for January-that is, at the end of the football season there's not much room for error. It would be a shame if delays somehow kept MADDEN off the field this year. WHAT'S NEW Internet play, 8-button game pad support, Win95 code, improved A.I., enhanced Madden University, the airport!) What you can look for are more Madden NFL 98 promises to add playcomplex book depth to its popular arcade play. coaching scripts that will guide your opponent's decisions as they match gridiron wits against you. While MADDEN doesn't offer a career mode, it provides an NFL-style schedule generation utility which gives coaches the opportunity to play multiple seasons, albeit with the same cast of players. The game does permit trading, however, and the computer G.M.'s ability to haggle over talent has been improved. Salary cap considerations add a welcome element of realism to the player personnel aspect of this year's game. With full NFL licensing, MADDEN offers complete rosters for all 30 professional teams. Gamers who grow weary of the 1997 players will find plenty of classic teams included from distant cras. While the lineup of older clubs hadn't been finalized at press time, the design team may reach as far back as the leather helmet days of the 1920's. After all, Bronco Nagurski and Jim Thorpe would make nice additions to the All-Madden Team. And what would this game be without Madden himself? The famed coach and color analyst is back with more lessons from Madden University. Using his trademark Telestrator, Big John will discuss play design, and offer insights on the classic teams. MADDEN 98 offers arcade and coach mode against the computer, as well as modem and Internet play. EA Sports has made arrangements with MPlayer that will allow owners to do their Internet gaming there for free. Unfortunately, Internet play is coach-only, as latency issues preclude the use of a joystick. On the plus side, expect additional A.I. enhancements in Internet games, including a coaching editor that won't be available in the single-player version. X-and-o freaks will appreciate the ability to design and swap plays online While there's no support planned for 3D accelerators, a patch may be released for the more popular cards later on. 3D shouldn't be a major concern, however, since the game's hardware demands are not steep, a design decision aimed at making the game accessible to the masses (something that didn't quite happen with the previous version). Theoretically, MADDEN should perform very well on a P100 or better.

What makes this game so intriguing to football fans? How about Red Grange blitzing Dan Marino, or Johnny Unitas throwing the deep post against Deion Sanders? LEGENDS offers authentic NFL action that spans four distinct eras: 1932, 1950, 1968, and today. Gamers can generate cross-era matchups, or stay within their favorite time period. The opportunity to experiment with the effects of NFL rules changes and the evolution of offensive and defensive strategy makes LEGENDS '98 an NFL time capsule and a football simulation rolled into one. STRENGTHS LEGENDS should thrill hardcore NFL fans with its crossera play. The design team has packed an enviable amount of historical research into the game. Coaches can select teams as well as the era in which they do battle. For instance, you could easily match up the '97 Super Bowl champion Packers against the 1932 Green Bay team. What's more, you could play the contest using either today's rules, or those of '32. Your decision will have a massive impact on both gameplay and strategy. For example, rosters were limited to 20 players in 1932.

Support is provided for a variety of controllers, including Gravis GRIP and Microsoft Sidewinder gamepads. 3D renditions of all 30 current NFL parks are included, as well as representative stadiums for each of the historical eras. Period Navor is enhanced by team uniform changes as you progress through time. While the 1932 players are a drab bunch, clad in leather helmets and earth tones, by 1968 players had evolved into the colorful, heavily armored gladiators we associate with the sport today. The game tracks a variety of individual and team statistics, and also offers league management functions, including a career mode in which players are drafted, age, and retire. Coaches can tinker with the LEGENDS playbooks, or roll their own with the game's play editor utility. Gamers can also scrimmage cross-country, as well as cross-era, using LEGENDS' options for modem, LAN, serial, or Internet play. PREDICTEO FINISH: 2ND Game Plah ABC Interactive ABC Monday Night Football '98 and OT Sports are back with Developer: OT Sports MONDAY Publisher: ABC Interactive NIGHT FOOT Target Release Date: August '97 BALL '98, the second edition of a game that failed to live up to expectations in its debut last season. Things are looking up for the MNF franchise, however, with vastly improved graphics, better sound quality, less system drain, and well-supported multiplayer options. STRENGTHS Are you ready for some football? Let's hope so, because MNF '98 seems poised to give MADDEN and LEGENDS a serious run for the crown this year. Unlike last year, MNF's pluses encompass more than just its famous announcing trio of Al Michaels, Dan Dierdorf, and Frank Gifford. To be sure, the Monday Night broadcast team is back in the booth, offering insightful play-byplay commentary, as well as providing a brief pre-game show. Add in appearances by Chris Berman (yes, he's back-back-back) and Lynn Swann, and the game captures that MNF mood perfectly. MNF 98 is much better looking than its predecessor. Player graphics are larger and crisper, with uniforms that feature numbers, stripes, and helmet logos. There is also more stadium detail, although the venues themselves seem generic. Last year's unwieldy play-calling interface has been upgraded. Coaches can now quickly select their basic fo mation, then scroll to the play of their choice. MNF has thankfully retained the slick play-design interface that was last year's saving grace, since the game's ability to generate plays on the fly is a real plus. WEAKNESSES LEGENDS was originally scheduled for release last year, but stalled in development. The state of the gaming art has taken several quantum leaps since that time. Will the game's design show any ill effects of its long delay? And, while LEGENDS offers a coach mode in addition to arcade play, the producer's primary orientation is toward entertainment. Look for an emphasis on action rather than strategy and statistics. Finally, the task of accurately "

Your Notre Dame team could have Joe Theismann and Rick Mirer competing for the starting job at QB. "


"PIGSKIN PLAVAFES Last season's biggest surprise, Acclaim's QB Club returns with better, deeper football action. ling, it's almost too similar. Do the college teams and playbooks justify an entirely new game, rather than an add-on module to MNF? Fans will have to decide that one for themselves. Another personal choice revolves around the \"heroes\" concept, which limits the game to an allstar fantasy realm. Gamers who want to try their hand at authentic college replays or who would like to experiment with recruiting will have to look elsewhere-say, in EA's direction. STRENGTHS Since HEROES is essentially MNF in a varsity sweater, it bears a strong family resemblance to its NFL big brother. This includes attractive, detailed player sprites, an easy-touse play editor, and the ability to match up with other coaches via the Internet. Oddly enough, HEROES may be the first college game to feature real NFL players among its more than 1,700 top all-time college stars. The ability to move the players between rosters creates an array of interesting fantasy team possibilities. OT Sports went to some lengths to create an NCAA flavor with HEROES. Each team's fight song is available, as is historical background on the universities. The presence of ABC's longtime college football commentator Keith Jackson and former Purdue All-American Bob Griese add to the Saturday afternoon lookand-feel of the game's interface. The inclusion of playbooks featuring the Wing T, Double Wishbone, and Option offenses are yet another tipoff that you're not playing in Detroit or Green Bay anymore.

Would-be general managers will find plenty to occupy them in QB CLUB, which permits trading, drafting, and free-agent signings. Gamers also have the option to create a player, or even an entire team. (Why not put yourself on your favorite team?) QB CLUB '98 allows you to play only the games you choose, while the computer simulates the remainder of the schedule. If you like the variety of a hefty playbook, QB CLUB is for you, with over 1,000 stock plays available. Unfortunately, there's no way to edit or to design your own. Each team comes with ten signature plays, however, so watch out for Jerry Rice on the slant pattern when you're up against the 49ers. Despite being a console game ported to the PC, Acclaim's NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB was a pleasant surprise among last season's crop of football games.

"PIGSKINPLAYOFES EXHIBITION 1 M NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS O WHAT'S NEW Updated engine, enhanced playbook with plays designed by Brett Favre, more robust stats and roster management. A new, more friendly interface is one of the changes to this year's FPS Football Pro. PREDICTED FINISH: 6TH Game PlanFront Page Sports Football Pro '98 Developer: Synergistics Publisher: Sierra On-Line Target Release Date: September '97 | As close to a dynasty as it gets in the sports gaming world, Sierra's FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL PRO series has enjoyed an unprecedented five-year reign as front-runner among gridiron simulations. All that changes this season, however. Much like an NFL team hampered by salary cap restrictions, FRONT PAGE is going through a badly needed rebuilding year. What gamers will see in the '98 version is essentially a dressed-up version of the same game that earned a 4.5 star review in Computer Gaming IVorld last season. That is, it'll be good, but as measured by last year's standards. To their credit, Sierra has tacitly acknowledged this by offering the game at a very reasonable $29.95 list price. included with the game, or use FPS' robust play editor to craft their own blitzes, traps, and screens. Once the plays are designed, gamers can draw up a game plan, and test their coaching mettle against a computer opponent, or take on live opposition via e-mail, modem, or the Internet. Coaches who haven't the time for extensive tinkering with their playbook can take advantage of major improvements to the stock plays included with the game. Sierra called on play-design experts to tweak the X's and O's. In addition, NFL backup QB Will Furrer was employed to craft team-specific playbooks for all 30 NFL clubs. As a result, the available formations and plays should reflect each team's persona. Look for the 49ers to line up in the West Coast offense, while the Steelers come roaring at you with their blitzing 3-4 defensive set. And if life on the bomb squad is your style, take heart. This year's edition offers the ability to edit special teams lay for the first time. The game offers the ability to control any player on the field, or just sit back and coach while the computer does the grunt work. Games can be left entirely to the CPU, in fact, allowing users to simulate as many or as few games as they choose. This is a handy feature if you want to control just one team while letting the rest of the league schedule play itself out. Perhaps the most engaging feature of FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL PRO is its career mode. Team ownership can continue from season to season, with individual skills improving or declining as the players gain experience, age, or even retire. Prior to each campaign, the game generates fictitious rookies and conducts a draft, allowing coaches to restock their rosters. Next comes training camp, where decisions have to be made regarding the allocation of training time. In this way, your team's character evolves over time, much like real NFL clubs. Game interface screens are more colorful and easier to navigate than in the past. FPS: FOOTBALL PRO '98 also enhances the game's league management utilities. Commissioners of the numerous online leagues will be excited by the ability to export HTML formatted data directly from the game to a league web page, making rosters, schedules, injury reports, trades, and draft picks much easier to handle. p WEAKNESSES With FPS' Windows 95 game engine pretty much untouched from last year, gamers are primarily getting enhanced cosmetics patched onto the old engine. But it may be the gaming industry's worst-kept secret that Sierra is really putting their energy into a complete makeover of FPS: FOOTBALL for the '99 edition. STRENGTHS FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL PRO rightfully earned its place in the sports gaming Hall of Fame by combining the best elements of arcade action with realistic statistics and league management tools. Using a physics-based game engine, FPS: FOOTBALL rates players across eight categories such as strength, intelligence, speed, and throwing ability. Armchair coaches can utilize hundreds of stock offensive, defensive, and special teams plays W HAT'S NEW WHAT'S NEW Better stock plays, cleaner user interface, HTML output for league management, improved stadium graphics.

"Racing into the Winners Circle by Johnny L. Wilson Three New Auto Racing Sims Rev Up For The Fall acing is the perfect blend between technological sophistication and human skill. Engine, chassis, tire, and aerodynamics are designed to space-age specifications. Computer-aided fuel management can make the difference between a winning and losing performance-just ask the Pac-West racing team, whose two drivers ran out of fuel in the last lap of this year's Detroit Grand Prix. But winning still requires the daring skills of drivers who know how and when to make the right moves, with split-second precision, in the midst of fast and intense competition. Naturally, successful computer racing games allow you to find the winning edge in both ways: setting up your car to the limit of existing technology and making the right moves against either a challenging Al or other human opponents. This year promises to be better than ever for racing sim fans, with three serious new games that should press INDYCAR RACING II, NASCAR II and GRAND PRIX RACING II —the reigning champions of the computer racing world for dominance. (complete with doppler effect), and a fascinating mixture between real and imaginary tracks and cars, but the most detailed telemetry read-outs ever seen in a racing game.

As for open-wheel racing-the high-performance modern descendant of the wheel-to-wheel chariot duels of the Roman Era-both Microsoft's CART PRECISION RACING (due first quarter '98) and ABC Interactive's ABC SPORTS INDYCAR RACING: ROAD TO INDIANAPOLIS (due this Christmas), feature serious physics models, celebrity licenses representing both drivers and racing teams, and sophisticated car set-up options (see chart, page 22). In terms of human opponents, all three sims feature multiplayer options. X-CAR only allows modemto-modem or IPX play, however, while both ABC and CART have Internet strategies built into the products. In the case of the latter two, you can expect to eventually be able to sign up to compete in racing leagues via the Internet. All three sims know that the bottom line of any racing game is to have fun. So, all three allow you to set the race lengths for a comfortable duration, and have options for beginning a race immediately or going Player Assistance Start Your Engines All three sims take seriously the technology underpinning modern professional racing.

"Golfar! By Scott A. May No lie—it's getting mighty crowded on the PC greens. Take a tour with our golf pro. Forget alien invaders and demon-infested dungeons. The year's most intense computer gaming battles are being waged on gentle fairways and peaceful greens. We're referring, of course, to the Golf Wars--an all-out blitz by software publishers to turn your PC into a digital country club. Though somewhat unexpected, the current explosion of quality golf simulations should be welcome news to any sports fan. Faced with photorealistic graphics, course architects, and multiplayer online capabilities, today's computer golf games are nothing short of phenomenal. Some may sport more chrome and sizzle, but in the end, everyone's a winner in this battle of the links. Here's a brief rundown of the best new golf sims to emerge this year. Looking Glass, the high-flying publisher of FLIGHT UNLIMITED, makes the move from wild blue yonder to terra firma with BRITISH OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF. It's a quality effort, but cast in the shadow of its feature-rich competitors, it feels somewhat mundane at times. There are, however, some unique aspects to this game. For starters, Looking Glass is one of only two software publishers granted official license to use Scotland's historic St. Andrews course. It also heralds the return of designer Rex Bradford, creator of the infamous \"swing meter,\" first used in Accolade's MEAN 18. History aside, the first thing most jaded American sim-golfers will notice about this game is its scenery-or rather, the lack thereof. Graphics are well drawn and feature quick redraws between strokes, but beyond a few patches of trees and brush, the game's two courses are quite flat and barren, giving the whole experience a somewhat desolate look and feel.

"GOLF WAR! FITNESS GOLF FPS: Golf The game's best features are its ultrarealistic ball fight physics model, adjusting for wind, humidity, temperature, and surface texture. Then there's the absolutely vivid audio commentary by veteran sportscaster Jim McKay. Armed with more than 5,000 unique phrases, McKay's banter is seamless, giving the game much-needed personality Overall, BRITISH OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF is a worthwhile simulation of two historic links. Unfortunately, the game's lack of amenities remote multiplayer modes, course designer, and recorded play-ultimately pale next to its more dazzling rivals. INGATLUE Another newcomer to the digital greens, Sierra's long-delayed FPS: GOLF has survived the vaporware void and emerged victorious. By all indications, it was well worth the wait. Designed by golf sim legend Vance Cook, best known for Access Software's WORLD CLASS LEADERBOARD and LINKS series, FPS: GOLF captures something uncommon to the genre: personality. From the intuitive interface to the innovative swing mechanics, this game just feels unique. And it's this sometimes intangible quality that sets it apart from the pack. Graphics are photorealistic, utilizing a combination of digitized bitmaps, 3D-rendered objects, and texture-mapped polygon terrain. Unlike most other golf sims, the game uses polygonal golfers, not videocaptured images. Though obviously less lifelike, the payoff comes with faster animation and a much wider range of motions (and emotions). The game's biggest innovation is a new style of swing mechanics dubbed TrueSwing.

LINKS LS 1998 may lack some key features now in demandnotably, a course architect but in terms of overall style, it's still the gold standard in golf sims. gold plated, and polished to perfection. Although the game may no longer be the genre's top contender, even detractors can't help but feel awed by its presence. Perhaps feeling pressure from new competition, Access has wisely chosen not to rest on its laurels. The 1998 EDITION is a 4-disc extravaganza, designed to convey more than just the game of professional golf, but the entire lifestyle. Indeed, two entire discs are devoted to virtual tours of the Latrobe and Kapalua Resort courses, the Plantation Clubhouse, as well as host Arnold Palmer's office, workshop, and trophy room. Still arguably the best-looking golf sim ever made, LINKS LS 1998 boasts more than 25 new features.

Despite all this window dressing, screen redraws are also significantly faster. Other enhancements include 8 new version offers fewer frills than its competitors, yet is by far the most polished of the bunch. The game's most readily apparent improvement is its new 32-bit game engine, producing crisper animation, more fluid play, and almost instantaneous screen redraws. Also improved is the game's intuitive, context-rich interface, which uses the same model as Microsoft's other recent sports titles (FULL COURT PRESS, SOCCER). Though only two courses are included with the game Banff Springs and Harbour TownGOLF 3.0 allows you to import greens from the vast collection of LINKS CHAMPIONSHIP COURSES. A separate, built-in converter automatically updates old courses to GOLF's new high-res format. All in all, Microsoft Golf 3.0 plays it safe, pushing no boundaries in this crowded genre.

So it's only fitting that the latest computer game to bear his name, Accolade's JACK NICKLAUS 4, should be the preeminent golf simulation of our time. Nearly every thing you could ever hope for in a golf game is included in this comprehensive package. It's an absolute model of perfeclion. course designer, a course converter (for importing INSE courses), and a choice of four multiplayer modes (serial, modem, TAN, and Intemet). The only thing missing is post-game cocktails at the clubhouse. Pre-game options include course, game length, golfing buddies (with updated stats), a choice of caddies, gimmes, mulligans, and weather conditions (rain, log, or clear). Three of these options can be further defined: clearing fog, maximum distance for gimimes, and total number of mulligans allowed per found. The real kicker is the varicty of available game styles, the most of any golf sim on the market. These include Best Score Championship, Best Score Handicap, Stroke Play, Match Play, Sucken Death, SI Million Skins Challenge, Bingo Bango Bongo, and Certified Came (recorded Stroke Play for deferred mail or email matchups).

There's also a built-in design wizard, which automates many of the tedious tasks for beginners. Starting with a flat piece of land, you build your course from the inside out, applying fairway shapes and greens, setting pars and handicaps, and arranging your overall layout with an eye for natural continuity. Next, fine-tune each hole with variations in shape, elevation and terrain type. From there, a plethora of tool palettes are available to customize your basic design: trees, bushes, rocks, bunkers, lakes, streams, cart paths, objects, sky, and horizon. Using CAD-style boundary points, everything on the screen can be moved or resized using simple dragand-drop mouse commands. Auto-rendering lets you see in precise detail how your designs will appear during play. Not only that, but every change is instantly updated in the rendering window. Every square foot of your course can be viewed from virtually any distance or angle. A few faults are readily apparent: There's no option for importing user-created objects or sounds, and no way to automatically tile view windows on the screen. Finally, there's no provision for testing your design as you go, except to save, exit, and load the unfinished course into the game. These detractions aside, however, the course designer is a powerful, versatile tool guaranteed to give this product long legs in the marketplace. PACKIN' THE TOOLS Everything you need to design new links-or modify existing ones-is at your disposal in JN4's unsurpassed course architect. n real life, Jack Nicklaus is in semi-retirement, playing only select senior tournaments. Far from inactive, however, St. Nick devotes much of his energy to course designs. To this end, I can't think of a better testament to his architectural prowess than JACK Niclaus 4's superb course designer. Modeled after Nicklaus Productions' own CAD system, the course architect is amazingly robust. It can also be daunting, particularly for first-time designers eager to duplicate their favorite links.

Not only do you get five courses and a built-in designer, but you'll also inherit what amounts to an instant library of thousands of custom-designed links. JN4 has the ability to import and convert courses created with its predecessor, JACK NICKLAUS SIGNATURE EDITION. All you need is a modem and access to the Internet or other major online services, including America Online, Compuserve, and Delphi. There you'll find enough courses to make your putter flutter indefinitely. The conversion process only transfers terrain shapes and elevations, so you'll have to add objects such as trees and bushes.

Course graphics consist of a combination of computer-rendered terrain and digitally captured objects. The result is a very crisp, clean display that's realistic enough, but not overdone. The main play screen features a large third-person view of the course, with options to overlay or tile multiple view windows: top-down, profile, landing, pin, and ball view. An icon bar runs down the left side of the screen, offering easy access to instant replays, a chat window, scorecard, multimedia tips, and online documentation. The Course Architect is a separate program that interfaces with the game. Essentially a CAD program with cleats, the Course Architect is industrial strength, using an intricate combination of menus, previews, and dialog boxes to pick and place terrain styles, objects, elevations, slopes, green sizes, bunkers, pars, and fairway shapes, among many other variables. SIMGOLF's course architect is powerful, though not as intuitive as Accolade's JN4. With SIMGOLF, Maxis also introduces the first real attempt to change the physics of simulated club action, dubbed the Mouse Swing. Rather than rely on click-and-twitch reaction timing, players now visually pull the club head for backswing, then move forward for impact. It's a great idea that falls slightly short in execution. This feature has since been eclipsed by Sierra's betterimplemented TrueSwing controls in FRONT PAGE SPORTS: GOLF. Overall, SIMGOLF is an earnestbut-flawed first try from Maxis that, given support, may eventually evolve into a first-rate contender "

"Her ostanemes Baseball strategy to bring out your inner Lou Pinella by Robert Coffey s sophisticated as baseball sims have become, they still haven't come up with a virtual George Steinbrenner, ready to bounce you the moment you make a managerial decision he disagrees with. Well, at least, not yet. As clownish as the real Steinbrenner's antics may be, they do underscore an important point: Basic managing strategy can play as much a part in deciding the outcome of a game as player performance. Play smart baseball and you can keep Steinbrenner in the owner's box and off your back. disruption of that timing. Mixing up the speeds of your pitches will throw off even a computer opponent's timing. San Diego's closer, Trevor Hoffman, will throw a couple fastballs in the low 90's to set up a devastating change-up that will have hitters swinging about a week and a half before it reaches the plate. Overreliance on a fastball will kill you later in the game. Good players will eventually catch up to and crush even Randy Johnson's blistering fastball if they see it enough. probably something the hitter can drive. You don't have to serve up something fat to get that first strike, just choose your pitcher's best pitch, throw it on the edge of the black and get that hitter in the hole. The importance of keeping the count in your favor cannot be stressed enough, especially in a game like Sierra's FRONT PAGE SPORTS: BASEBALL PRO '98, where computer players won't swing at anything out of the strike zone. Beyond that, staying ahead puts the hitters in a position where they will more often than not get themselves out. Isn't it nice of them to do your job for you? With two strikes on them, hitters have to bat defensively, swinging at close pitches that may or may not be in the strike zone. Staying ahead is particularly effective when playing a multiplayer game. With the count 0-2 or 1-2, you can waste a couple pitches out of the strike zone and get an overanxious player to swing at something bad. Make sure you change speeds and don't fall in love with heat. Hitting is timing, and effective pitching is the On the mound When pitching, the most important pitch anyone on your staff can throw is strike one. Getting that 0-1 count gets you ahead of the hitter right away, giving you instant breathing room and letting you dictate the course of the at-bat. Miss with the second pitch and you're still sitting pretty at 1-1, which is much better than a 2-0 count that forces you to make sure you get something over the plate, probably a fastball and Calling the bullpen While the wealth of stats in MICROLEAGUE BASEBALL 6.0 can help you determine the ideal reliever for a given situation, there are some things that can contribute to your relief efforts that don't show up in any charts. For instance, while fireballing save specialists like Mark Wohlers can be devastating, they aren't always the best answer for a given situation. With runners on base and less than two outs, a hurler with a diving sinker can get you a routine ground ball for an inning"

"BASEBALL STRATEGY ESTADOS UNISINOS HITRONI STTITY two strikes on them, and, actually, that's not such a bad idea for your stronger hitters either. MEBERRI ladle MUSIC killing double play. If you're drafting a team for league play, make sure you've got a couple relievers with wicked breaking stuff and off-speed pitches. And while you're at it, take a good look at player animations. FPSBB does a good job mixing up delivery styles for various pitchers. Bringing in a sidearmer can totally disorient a human opponent for a few at bats until they can adjust to the change. Even a generally mediocre pitcher like Sid Fernandez can get some much needed outs late in a game when he's snapping off pitches from waaayy inside on left-handed batters. SLINGING IT Sidearm pitchers like Sid Fernandez can be effective relievers by forcing hitters to adjust to a totally new delivery late in the game. MICROLEAGUE DAREBALL 6.0 TEAM EDITOR MICRO ACUE Tong G COM ULUUT 2 MANGE ORAL Pitchers S! options San Diego ' 9G SounLoad D Create Help BATMAN FOREVER For hit-and-run plays, check your roster stats for hitters high in average and low in strikeouts, like San Diego's Tony Gwynn. In the batter's box Nothing beats slamming a tapemeasure home run, but sometimes the best way to get that homer is not to swing the bat. Don't be afraid to take a pitch. Taking pitches helps in more ways than one. It gives you a chance to get used to a particular pitcher's pitch movement. Also, taking a pitch forces hurlers to pitch to you-they can't throw out of the strike zone lest they fall behind and are obliged to serve up fat pitches. Not being afraid to take a few pitches also lets you run up a pitcher's pitch count. In games that pay close attention to pitchers' fatigue -like FPSBB and MICROLEAGUE BASEBALL 6.0they'll wear out earlier and become more vulnerable. Obviously, you can't take every first pitch or the other team is guaranteed to throw nothing but certain strikes to get you in the hole early. The only time you really should ignore the first pitch no matter what is if you're trailing late in a game and need baserunners. In that situation you need to try to work out a walk. Your weakest hitters shouldn't swing until they've got Running the bases Stealing bases is a great way to create runs, but don't get carried away. Never make the first or last out of an inning trying to swipe third. Why? A man on second with no outs has a great chance to score anyway, and with two outs you're going to need a base hit to score from third--the same base hit that'll score you from second. Stealing third in those situations needlessly kills scoring opportunities. Hit-and-run plays can be a useful tool for creating runs and avoiding double plays, but to succeed you need to have the right players in the right place at the right time. Since the batter has to swing to protect the runner, you should only call the hitand-run when the count favors your getting a good pitch to hit. like 2-0 or 3-1. Speed on the basepaths helps, but the hitter is the crucial part of the hit-andrun equation. In FPSBB look for a bitter with a high contact rating; in MICROLEAGUE BASEBALL 6.0 you'll want a bitter with a high average and few strikeouts. In the rock 'em, sock 'em action of TRIPLE PLAY 98 it pretty much boils down to «Do you feel lucky, punk? Well, do you?\" A double steal with runners on the corners can be very effective against a human opponent. With less than two outs, tell the runner at first to steal second. As soon as the catcher throws to second take off from third and steal a run. Share in the love as your buddy smashes his joystick in impotent frustration. Baseball is a game full of unwritten rules. Pay attention to them and you can keep yourself in the game until the final inning. I MOON SHOT Working the count to your favor as a hitter increases the odds of getting a pitch you can send into orbit. 2 BW BONEHEAD PLAY Even a good baserunner like Chipper Jones would be foolish to risk stealing third and killing a rally by getting the third out.

"CHARLES ARDAI  CRITIC AT LARGE A Woman's Place From DONKEY KONG to TOMB RAIDER, How Women's Roles Have (and Haven't) Changed How many but there is a place in the world for sexy caricatures. If teenage boys get an extra thrill out of the game because of it, I say bully for them. Put her on the cover of more magazines; star her in more games! What I worry about is that Lara currently stands almost alone on a list of prominent female computer-game characters, and the heroines we're bound to see in the wake of her success are likely to look just like her. On TV, you may have Xena, but you also have a wide range of alternate female roles, from Mrs. Cleaver and Jessica Fletcher to Lieutenant Uhura and Agent Scully. Sexpots and scientists, ingenues and investigators, Charlie's Angels and Cagney and Lacey-viewers can take their pick. In computer games, you have Lara Croft and that's about it. Today, more than 95 percent of the readers of this magazine are men, but that won't always be the case. Not if computer gaming continues to broaden its appeal, not if we in the industry do our jobs right.

"DENNY ATKIN NIGNTY OFF AUTO -DAY DIM 15 VOL SIMULATION/SPACE COM2 IR COOL ORIDE OPF MAP GAIN ON OFF ATT 009 REMEMBER THE NEWBIE The radar in GSC's F/A-18 HORNET 3.0 is wonderfully realistic, but the lack of a simplified mode for beginners makes it harder to talk friends into joining network games. of JANE'S F-15 and FICHIER SQUADRON: SCREAMIN' DEMONS OVER EUROPE have announced they'll use this key layout as well. Its hoped that all developers follow sulit, giving gamers one less set of keys to leam-and to reprogram on their joysticks. With padlock views, its important to include cues to indicate which direction your head is looking, so you can bring the plane's nose around to face the enemy. EF-2000 does this particularly well with the chevron reflections on its canopy: Microsofts FIGHTER ACE uses canopy frames to good effect here. Ideally, sims should include two levels of padlock views. The expert padlock should lose track of the enemy when it passes behind an obstruction, while, to make things easier for newbies, the arcade padlock should continue tracking the enemy even when it passes under the plane. Padlocks should track everything you could normally track with your eyes. Believable aircraft performance is vital. Although accurate performance is best, it's It always 100 percent achievable on today's hardware. At worst, a program shouldn't have flagrant behaviors that jar you out of the impression that you're flying a real aircraft. Not long ago I decided to see how far into the stratosphere I could push a simulated jet. 'The jet continued climbing until it hit 65,000 feet, at which point it stopped climbing, though it maintained a sim should include all three types, as does FLYING NIGHTMARES 2. Fixed views should afford all the flexibility of the human head. For instance, it was hard to dogfight in carly test versions of SABRE ACE and EUROPEAN AIR WAR since there was no way to look 90-degrees straight up. This vicw is vital to tracking enenty aircraft when you're in a tight, tuming fight. Both sims will include this view in their shipping versions. WARBIRDS and Air WARRIOR II share a common view key set that allows ultimate flexibility, the developers Direct3D patch. Without a smooth frame rate, planies are hard to keep under control, and combat is nearly impossible. That said, realistic looks are important as well. Witness the widespread sales of Novalogics F-22 LICHINING II a very basic simulation with a limited number of canned missions, but with fast, detailed graphics versus the niche popularity of SSIs Su-27 F.ANKER, a very sophisticated simulation with a detailed mission clitor, but only a simple, polygon-based engine. With 3D card support becoming the norm, there will be no excuse for 1998s sims not playing fast while looking superb. Detailed graphics aren't just necessary from a flash-and-dazzle perspective they help you suspend disbelief and become immersed in the sim. Next is the view system. Beginning sim pilots usually stick to looking directly forward through the windscreen. But to cxcel in sims, as in real-life combat, you need to be able to look all around to target enemy threats. The three primary view systems are panning, virtual cockpits; fixed views, which let you look immediately in any direction; and padlock views, which track enemy aircraft. View systems are a religious issue, and you'll never convince a proponent of one type that another is better. To succeed, a WHERE'S THE KABOOM? When we crash, show us the explosions and burning wreckage: don't cop out with still images, as in iF-22 and LONGBOW, or a simple \"Crash\" line, as in FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 (pictured).

"TERRY COLEMAN  STRATEGYZWARGAMES strat GenCon XXX The Premier Gaming Con Adapts for the New Millennium PANZER GENERAL II This tournament from SSI outdrew many of the boardgame and paper RPG events at GenCon. he naysayers were in rare form as they oozed from the woodwork and slid along the poured concrete floors of the Milwaukee Convention Center, which was once again home to the CenCon convention. The same people who just a year ago said that nothing in gaming history could match the phenomenon of Magic: The Gathering now were convinced that gaming was in a tailspin. Their evidence was simple: Attendance at CenCon was down; Magic had glutted the market for card (and other) games; and there was no single game ready to assume Magic's throne. So bad was the situation, they crowed, that Wizards of the Coast (the Magic folks) would either move the con to its Seattle headquarters or cancel the event entirely Most of these rumors, I found out, were wishful thinking (or worse) spread by competitors of Wizards of the Coast. After all, Wizards didn't buy TSR just for 66 If you're looking for fresh and clever game designs, check out some collectible card games. D&D. GenCon, now in its 30th year, is a very profitable enterprise, one that dwarfs most other gaming shows in attendance. Attendance was slightly lower this year ---some 28,500 by the best estimate I could pin down-but that still places GenCon just behind E3. Keep in mind that more than 95 percent of the GenCon attendees are paying customers, and you begin to get the picture. All but two of the vendors I polled said that sales were up over last year. O ne official from Wizards of the Coast (who requested anonymity) said not only that the organization was under contract to stay in Milwaukee for next year, but that it was already negotiating to renew the contract for several more years: \"The Milwaukee site is relatively inexpensive and very accessible to thousands of gamers--and the con has been here for decades. To be fair, there is some truth to the rumor that TSR is being dismantled: Evidently only four to five senior people are being kept, and the staff is being moved to Wizards' digs in Seattle. As for the lack of aspirants to Magics clominance, a Magic, D&D,or DOOM comes once a decade, if that -and if you saw the crowds at the Wizards booth, you wouldn't worry about Magics future. In fact, far from being diminished, the influence of the Magic collectible card game was everywhere. The Marvel Superheroes RPG is currently being redesigned for the SAGA card-based system. Many boardgames contested in CenCon toumaments, such as Avalon Hills Hannibal and We the People, already use cards to resolve combat and random events, with more in the series on the way. And there was even a Star Trek: The Next Generation collectible dice game, which sold for less than $15 and was gamering healthy crowds. BRIEFINGS MAGIC MULTIPLAYER? In other trading-card gaming news, MicroProse insists that Manalink, the long-awaited multiplayer code for Magic: THE GATHERING PC, will be up and running before Christmas. Moreover, it's supposed to be a free downloaddraw your own conclusions. Whether or not Manalink comes off on time, the first expansion pack for Magic will be available soon (maybe even as you read this). The add-on promises better Al (more consistent, we hope) and a host of new virtual cards.

"TERRY COLEMAN Pick A Card, Any Card US SENTENAS NCC 1701:1. STRATEGYZ WARGAMES ith all due respect to AD&D and PANZER GENERAL II, the legacy of GenCon XXX is simply this: If you're looking for fresh and clever game designs, check out some collectible card games. They were everywhere-the heart and soul of the show. And while they aren't technology-driven, good card games do share some similarities with computer games. They tend to be fastpaced, playable in under two hours, and require that you pack a lot of form and function into the interface. Here, then, is a look at what I consider the best collectible card games from GenCon. As the computer version of MAGIC: THE GATHERING is selling quite well, don't be surprised to see at least a few of these on your desktop in the next couple of years. SART THE EXI GEERA. FCUIBUE DIGE GAME COW INVASION OF THE SILICON HORDES Part of the gloom and doom among the paper gaming types may have stemmed from the increased presence of computer games at GenCon. Westwoxxl and Activision in particular crew a lot of traffic, but SSI stole the show with their PANZER GENERAL II toumament (sec READ.ME). But these events, while reasonably well-attended, couldn't begin to match the sheer variety of the remainder of the show.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS IF-22 RULES S OF EN GAGEME Energy Management Can Give You the Edge in Air Combat by Tom Basham clcome to the first installment of «Rules of Engagement,\" our new series focusing on the nuts and bolts of air combat. In each installment of the series, we'll examine some issue of real-world air combat and illustrate our points by applying them to your favorite flight sims. This month, we scrutinize one of the most critical aspects of air combat energy management, and how it comes into play in l-Magic's IF-22. Sim jocks talk a lot about «energy.\" From its conservation to its waste, energy is an integral part of air combat. What exactly is energy, though, and how do you manage it or waste it? F-22 Facts and Figures Turn performance is primarily dependent upon airspeed and gload. In turn, g forces are dependent upon airspeed and angle of attack (AOA). The angle of attack is the angle between the wing and the airflow; in simplest terms, think of it as the angle between where the aircraft's nose is pointed and the direction the aircraft is actually moving. For a set AOA (say 10 degrees), you'll pull more gs flying at 400 knots than at 200 knots. Given the importance of AOA and gload, let's examine the F-22's performance. Flight tests indicate that 1F-22's simulated Raptor has an instantaneous g-load of at least Og's above about 400kts, and as much as 10.5g's above 500kts. The jet bleeds speed quickly, though, and rapidly decelerates below 300kts. With a standard combat loadout of 6 AIM-120C and two AIM-9X, sustained g varies with altitude, ranging from about 5.5g's at 330kts at sea level, to 4.3gs at 290kts at 11,000 feet, to 3.Og's at 230kts at 25,000 feet. Although these figures will vary somewhat, they illustrate a very important point: 1F-22's simulated jet has a very impressive instantaMoney in the Bank In simplest terms, aircraft \"spend\" energy to«buy\" maneuvers. Pilots, like greedy bankers, try to maximize energy before a battle, then invest it wisely to purchase\" critical maneuvers during the fight. First, let's briefly review those high-school physics classes. Energy comes in two types: kinetic and potential. In terms of air combat, kinetic energy equals airspeed. The faster an aircraft moves, the more kinetic energy it has. Potential energy, meanwhile, equates to altitude. But the two forms are interchangeable: An aircraft moving at high speed can convert its kinetic energy into altitude by climbing; an aircraft at high altitude can convert its potential energy into airspeed by diving. (As we'll explain in the sidebar, tum performance depends directly on airspeed.) If we push the banking analogy, kinetic energy (airspeed) works like cash, letting pilots immediately purchase maneuvers. Potential energy (altitude) works more like a savings account: You have to \"withdraw\" the money (by diving) before you can spend it. That's all well and good, but what exactly does it mean? Obviously, no pilot whips out a slide rule and starts calculating in the middle of a dogfight. Instead, you need to learn the capabilities of your aircraft and the amount of energy various maneuvers require. That's where energy management enters the picture. In short, energy management means ensuring that you have enough energy to execute the maneuvers you need to beat your opponent. CGW NOVEMBER 1997 "


"STRATEGY & TIPS: IF-22 GAMER'S EDGE neous turn capability, but it bleeds speed rapidly. Despite high-thrust engines and supercruise capability (supersonic flight without using afterburner), one good yank on the stick cuts the F-22 down to size rather quickly. The thrust vectoring system provides excellent nose control at low speed if you disengage the AOA limiter, but you risk departing the aircraft from controlled flight if you maneuver too aggressively. The F-22 might be the new king of the hill, but you still need to exercise good energy management to fly it effectively. The bandit will gain some airspeed during his clive, but he'll have to expend it in order to climb back to the fight. You'll have a substantial energy edge when the bandit returns to your altitude. Any chance to relax your g-load without surrendering angles to the bandit is a chance to regain energy. Also, look for opportunities to convert energy instead of simply bleeding it away. For example, if you come charging into the fight at extremely high speed and see that serve your energy. Sim pilots, who don't benefit from actually feeling the gs they're pulling. tend to execute harder turns than necessary in many circumstances. If you find yourself on the defensive, you must be especially judicious with your turns. Don't waste energy in a high-g turn when the enemy's nose isn't approaching a firing angle. Let up on the stick a little, lower the gs, and try to regain some airspeed. Wait until the bandit becomes an imminent threat, then give a good heave on the stick to increase the aspect angle and disrupt his shot. Pulling 8g's just before the bandit fires is a far more effective defense than pulling 4g's continuously. Next, look for opportunities to recoup energy. Say, for example, that the bandit dives past you during thic fight. If you're on the offensive and close to taking a shot, you should press the attack. If, however, you're in a more neutral position, you might let up on the g, level out, and try to regain soine airspeed without giving up any altitude. The G Spot First of all, con't waste gs. Don't pull into a 9-\"bat turn\" when 2gs will do this will conTurn and Burn lighter aircraft measure turn perI formance in two ways: turn radius and turn rate. Ideally, a fighter wants a very small turn radius coupled with a very high tum rate. As the name implies, turn rate specifies how quickly the aircraft's nose moves through the turn. Usually measured in degrees per second, turn rate is basically dependent on g-load divided by airspeed. In other words, increasing g-load usually increases tum rate, while increasing airspeed generally reduces it. Turn radius, the second measure of aircraft turn performance, measures the size of the invisible circle being circumscribed in the sky. Measured in linear terms, such as \"2,500 feet,\" turn radius is determined primarily as airspeed squared divided by g-load. In other words, a high g-load substantially decreases turn radius while high speed substantially increases it. Unfortunately, lift is a \"bounded» quantity compared to airspeed; fighters can reach maximum g's (generally between 6g's and 9g's for modern aircraft) well before reaching maximum speed. Consequently, attempting a turn while flying too fast degrades overall tum performance and wastes energy. The speed that maximizes turn rate while minimizing turn radius is called comer speed. 398 AIM-120C 2 G WHIZ The smoke trail from this damaged F-22 shows the plane's ability to pull very high angles of attack. 2 OVERSHOOT To avoid flying past your target, convert excess speed to altitude, 3 BROKEN PADLOCK Unfortunately, 1F-22's padlock doesn't always focus on the enemy, and you'll need to check the edges of the screen to locate the enemy. TURKEY SHOOT A single F-22 should eat these three MiG-23s for lunch, so don't send your entire flight against them. 6 TIGHT TURN Use the F-22's high instantaneous g capability to bring your weapons to bear on target NOVEMBER 1997 CCW "


"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS: IF-22 you're going to overshoot the target, you could slow down by chopping the throttle, extending the brakes, and dropping the gear. This will slow you, but you'll lose that energy forever. A better tactic is to roll out and climb above the target. Climbing will slow you, but some of that lost airspeed becomes altitude which you can later convert back to airspeed. This aspect is especially important in IF22: With the plane's supercruise capability and high-altitude performance, you'll prob ably start most fights with a substantial speed or altitude advantage. If you cnter a fight at mach 1.3, you shouldn't consider pulling a high-g turn and scrubbing away that energy Know your enemy's capabilities. If he has a better turning aircraft, don't waste precious energy trying to outturn him. Instead, try something else, like hit-and-run tactics.

Usually, this means that stacks containing heroes or other powerful units are easy to spot and follow. A sneaky Warlord will alter the order in which his units fight, putting, say, light infantry at the back of the army. Then, every powerful stack accompanied by a single light infantry unit (or other weakling) will be effectively camouflaged. Back Defaut Strier Caree Sey HIDE AND SEEK To prevent the enemy from seeing your heroes or powerful stacks, reorder your troops so they see only the weakest unit. The Best Defense Is... Defense Once you have a relatively large empire in place, take some care to garrison it well. Every city should have three to four decent defending units. These units need not be expensive, but they should be able to repel a nuisance attack and take out at least one or two attackcrs from even a powerful invader. There's no point in trying to make every city you own impregnable. You'd never have enough units to attack, and the cost would be prohibitive. Moreover, while you are busy securing what you have already, you can be sure that your stronger opponents will be expanding the size and strength of their empires. You can improve your defense through judicious spending on fortifications and by choosing the right defenders. In general, you can expect to gain attack strength through fortification bonuses. It's therefore a good idea to use relatively cheap infantry with low attack but high defensive values as garrison troops. These guys take a long time to die and should give you ample opportunity to wipe out one or two attackers. Generally, its a bad icca to use specialized units like elven archers as garrison troops. They don't have the hits necessary to sustain a siege and they tend to die easily if their archery attack fails. A sneaky raider with a few high hits and low attack units can often kill archers and the like at little cost to his troops.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: WARLORDS III GAMER'S EDGE GOOD GEOGRAPHY PAYS OFF This is a perfect border city in the classic \"Illuria\" scenario. All enemies must either march past it or attack it. Both options allow most cities behind it to be garrisoned with a weak force. others hold the enemy at bay until you are ready to deliver the coup de grâce. Race-Specific Tips Here is some advice to guide you in selecting and using the more popular race types. Undead While some undead troops are wimpy, almost all carry a negative, bonus via fear or chaos. This gives you a huge potential advantage because it offers the possibility of negating the total advantages normally available to your enemies. The most powerful of heroes may have little or no effect on their own armies when confronted with undead, troops. Concerted attacks can take out the most powerful enemy armies quite easily. Cavalry Races such as the Selentines and the Horse Lords work best in the open. You must use your mobility to confront the enemy on the plains. Your armies tend to be less well-suited to sieges, although cheap heavy-infantry can be used to soften up just about any position, as long as you don't mind heavy losses. Elves Elven archers are among the most fun of all the units on the board. Generate these units en masse and throw them at anything that looks dangerous. Be prepared to lose a lot of them, though, and remember, they make lousy garrisons. Most of your units have weak defenses, so be prepared for high losses. You can't count on a stack surviving for long unless you have special troops, so make sure your attacks are Coordinated and that any stack with a hero can be quickly reinforced. Dwarves/Orcs Slow but durable, your troops are ideal for attrition warfare. You'll have to work hard to surprise anyone, though. Also, your lack of a truly impressive unit means that you will have to depend on numbers to win your wars. A large city pool is critical, as is the proper convergence of forces at the right point. Giants Strong units combined with fear and chaos bonuses make the giants a fearsome enemy-if they can get established. Guard your troops well, as your armies are harder to build and cannot be thrown away. Don't alienate the elves, as their archers are tailor-made giant killers. If you make it to the mid-game with any sort of empire you should do well. The World of Difference Ceography is also important to winning scenarios against human opponents, as they are considerably less trustworthy than the computer. If you follow the principle of having a well-defended frontier combined with a relatively weakly held interior, then geography and reconnaissance become vitally important factors. Assume for a moment you are playing against multiple opponents with hidden movement as an option. You must have a system in place for discovering invading armies before they are in a position to attack. One method is to station picket units along logical invasion routes. You may also want to attack and raze an enemy city that lies close to your border. This must be done with some carc, as you definitely want to avoid an all-out\"scorched earth\" war in which any city that is lost is immediately torchicd. Also, if an opponent has a city in an awkward position and you aren't positive that you can hold it against counterattacks, you may want to consider flattening it so that invaders have to walk rather than vector into your territory Speaking of razing, if the raze option is on, you need to beware of punitive missions by computer opponents on the verge of losing. If a computer-controlled empire is nearly destroyed, the computer will sometimes create a single killer stack out of its remaining strong units and go on the rampage. Every city taken will be burned to the ground, and you may find yourself considerably weaker by the time that particular race has been defcated. To avoid this, try to take a dying empire's last few cities simultaneously. Remember, once all cities have fallen, any troops in the field are destroyed at the beginning of that player's next turn ARMY OF DARKNESS This undead stack scores 4 for chaos and 4 for fear, allowing it to negate up to +8 of enemy modifiers.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS X-COM: Apocalypse Strategies to Counterattack the Insidious Alien Menace by Tim Carter ne of the nice things about X-COM: APOCALYPSE is how diverse the alien menace is in the way it evolves over time as you discover more about the aliens and the alien dimension. You'll likely spend most of your time in the tacticalcombat modle, but there is still a lot of planning to be carried out at the strategic level. Contrary to what the manual suggests, don't go overboard on research spending, particularly early in the game. You'll have lots of time to research all of the techwology you need with only a few lab complexes. However, at the start of the game you may wish to buy a second biology lab, as you should reap a rich harvest of live and dead alicns in the first battle.

You can root aliens out of difficult positions by literally shooting the floor out from beneath their feet. In some cases you can finish off whole gaggles of brainsuckers by blasting a supporting pillar and causing them to fall a few stories. On base defense, the computer deliberately gives you a lousy starting placement. You can overcome this by realigning your squads so that two soldiers start each defense mission with your unarmed workers. This will disperse your troops while moving them closer to the entry zones. Also, you can have your soldiers drop a weapon or two near your scientists before they leave, giving them a rudimentary defensive ability if they are discovered. It's a good idea to have your scientists hide, by the way. (Bathrooms are my favorite hiding spots.) When you use psionic attacks, don't be discouraged if the aliens you control have no movement points left. Team up your psionic troops so that you control an enemy with one attack, then recontrol him with a second trooper on the following turn. If you know you won't get a second shot and the controlled enemy unit has no time left, you can still order him to drop all of his weapons. If the aliens gain control of some of your soldiers you can free them by killing the controlling alien (identified by a tiny red skull).

Even if all your vehicles are fully loaded, buy, buy, buy. Trust me, you'll need the ammo later. What about vehicles, anyway? Until you're flush with cash, don't waste money buying big aircraft -they are very expensive, tend to draw enemy attention, and don't carry that much more firepower. For the price of a single Valkyrie Interceptor you can buy about 10 Hovercars, cach carrying two thirds as many missiles as an Interceptor. This means that when you attacka UFO you can have 20 missile launchers firing instead of only three. Also, having multiple craft means that the enemy's fire will be dispersed, and losing a ship won't le a financial catastrophe. Agoxxl attack strategy is to fly toward the enemy at kwaltitude, then pop up to level two and switch to aggressive mode. Your craft will immediately begin firing missiles at the targeted UFO. When the UFO fires back, wait until the first hit and then retrcat. Iften attackers follow this strategy simultaneously, you should knock down UFOs left and right. Cenerally, beam weapons are a waste of time until you can build advanced craft and shields, at which point your ships will be durable enough for beam weapons to have an effect. (By then, you should also have heavy disruptors, which pack quite a punch.) On the ground, don't expand your operations too quickly. You don't nced a second base right away; a properly equipped I lovercar or Valkyrie will get you to any crash or investigation site quickly and easily If you feel you must have another base, make sure you can afford it.

You must bring up your forces equally. In a tum-based game a sollier can throw two grenades and duck for cover. If the grenacks are gas, be or she will have a decent chance of disabling anything dangerous. In realtime, though, the enemy will open fire before you see them and keep firing as you move. Don't be afraid to cluck your advance in order to concentrate your forces. Ambushing aliens as they come through the doors of a ship is much more effective in realtime: Many units can fire at once and you are not dependent on reaction times.

"GAMER'S EDGE WALKTHROUGH Extreme Assault Part 1 of the Ultimate EXTREME ASSAULT Walkthrough and Strategy by Gordon Goble  T 00 -00 XTREME ASSAULT wants to kill you. It wants to fry you amid fire and brimstone and a furious clash of metal-crunching weaponry. To make an already serious situation downright grave, you'll have to slice and dice your way through either the \"Difficult\" or \"Extreme\" levels to even stand a chance of finishing the thing In all honesty, the game is so big and so treacherous that a thorough strategy guide would fill a book. As it is, we're splitting our strategy guide into two parts. This month we take a walkthrough of the more difficult missions of Operations 1 and 2, along with tips and tactics. Next month, we'll reveal mission walkthroughs for Operations 3-6. Rather than discuss every mission, we'll sample some of the more important ones--spots where a few carefully implemented tactics will help you gain an advantage. Good luck and happy hunting, 10:34 CORE 0009560 HOLY POWER-UPS Who says church is boring? This one in Operation 1, Mission 4, has lots of goodies stashed inside.

MISSION SUCCESSFULI OPERATION 1 MISSION 5 Severely outnumbered and frightfully outgunned, you must start working right away, before the convoy spreads itself too thin. Get the center of the pack into targeting range by lowering your chopper to the ground, select any of the vehicles in the center, and hit the Smart Bomb space bar. If you've moved fast enough, you'll take out two or three helicopters as well and be blessed with one hell of a fireworks display. Mission 5 also gives you your first shot at the Tl tank, but finding it is another question. After you dispose of any bad cludes who survived your initial onslaught, move up to the top of the hill just before the village, turn around, and follow the road back down.

Extreme Pointers  Shoot everything, including your own equipment and bases or seemingly benign foliage. You never know where shield or weapon upgrades may be concealed.  Disregard the clock. It takes some time to finish each mission thoroughly, and even more to find secret spots. In the grand scheme of things, time bonuses are of little consequence.  Running your chopper along the ground rarely causes damage, aids in stability, and sometimes offers a comfy refuge. Hey, who needs a tank? . Most power-ups and upgrades evaporate after 25 seconds.

When the opportunity presents itself, hammer away at targets in close proximity to one another. The resulting concussion will damage an area's worth of enemies, and that makes for a happy pilot. . Press the Target Lock button constantly to locate hidden enemies.  Use guerrilla tactics. Jump out from cover, take a shot, and duck back in again. When the current target is terminated, lock onto another before you fall back. It will remain locked while you're out of sight, so you can continue tracking it for a quick kill during your next foray. . Don't go for every power-up. Some of them are designed to bait you into the line of fire.  Many of the later missions demand a large supply of guided multiple-warhead ordnance (such as Smart Bombs and Thunderbolts), so don't drain your supply in scenarios that provide plenty of cover.

"Sports GRAND SLAM Computer-controlled batters do a poor job of protecting the plate with a twostrike count.

Backspin kicks in on the ball's second bounce. -Scott May TENNIS ELBOW The most difficult thing to master in this game is how to play the net. To hone your serveand-volley game, do what Joli McEnroe used to do: Skip practice and play lots of doubles!

Don't be afraid to back out of captured terrain. If your armies are losing badly, retreat to your reserves and heal back to full strength, since the Al will rarely take over two terrain sets in the meantime. Use dragons to create a defense perimeter. Summoning dragons to unoccupied terrain will keep computer units from entering. Use this to create a buffer zone between you and hostile missile units. Capture the Tower terrain if you have lots of missile units or spellcasters. Missile units can exploit the Tower to fire upon any terrain from a safe distance.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what a wot, ME What's the Deal with... Being Politically Incorrect? All they had to do was put a catalog of real-life shooting sprees on their Web site, and suddenly they're the Bad Boys of Computer Gaming, with the mainstream press giving them all the publicity they can handle And for every attack on their blindly repugnant behavior, their defense will be the clichéd, \"Hey, man, you're just ell, the time has rolled around again. Another company is scared that its game is going to make about as much of a splash as a turd thrown into the Atlantic, so it decides some controversy will take the place of talent...and the mainstream press falls for it hook, line, and sinker. Yes, folks, we're looking at another NIGHT TRAP Christmas, and this year's lovely contestant is a pretty average number called POSTAL, which comes to us from a bunch of cynical cephalopods known as Running With Scissors Games. (And you know they are bad boys just from the name of their company! What would their mothers say?) Gamewise, there's nothing shocking about this one, at least not in the demo-a guy running around shooting up things that may or may not be zombies in traditional arcade style. Nothing in the package is really going to take the world by storm, except for a subtle little maneuver on the company's part to link their game with real-life incidents-the kind we see every so often on the news, when sad, disturbed individuals go berserk and murder or maim their coworkers. And guess what? It's working like a charm. ( Gee, why doesn't the Scissors bunch come out with Genocide: The Home Game? over at 3D Realms spend all day together coding, debugging, eating Chinese food, giggling about strip pers, and throwing fortune cookies at each other. Some of it's going to leak into their work! And if English sitcoms are to be believed, who can blame Bullfrog for thinking that it wasn't that unusual for someone to be cheered up by a spanking? But this POSTAL business is noth ing as charming and socially incom petent as exploding dancers. This is manipulative, dark, and cynical in the way it tries to work the numbers, not only of the gaming crowd but of the public in general. It has all the spon taneity and creativity of walking into a school yard and picking out the kid who's small enough for you to safely push down in the mud, just so all your friends will think you are tough Gee, why doesn't the Scissors bunch come out with Genocide: The Home Game, Kickboxing the Blind or Custer's Rapin' Rampage? (Those of us with long arcade memories might wince over that last one.) You want to know why? Because the groups who suffered such tragedies in real life are too big and powerful to be laughed at, and Scissors would have its little ass kicked all over the place. No, somebody has obviously decided that the number of people whose lives have been forever damaged or destroyed by someone's psychotic episode is still small enough that controversy and publicity can safely be generated on their backs. You can poke fun at these victims' suffering without much risk of lawsuits. In a smarter world, we'd just let this thing come and go without anything more than a sneer. Hell, I feel bad even giving it as much press as this, but since CNN and a few newspapers have already caught a whiff of another \"controversial\" game, I decided a little reality check couldn't make things much worse. Unfortunately the scam is going to work once again. Is the general-interest press going to freak out and give POSTAL free publicity? Probably. Are other creatively bankrupt goons going to try this routine every time they feel the need to make a media splash? Without a doubt. Are the real-life victims going to feel like they have been kicked hard in the gut by these cretins? Sadly, yes. But will POSTAL be a great game? Hard to say at this point, but if the designers were so sure of themselves and the quality of their work, I doubt they would be planning to waste half their strategy guide on a study of reallife massacres. Not much on game. play, but it sure will stir people up, eh? As for why games focus on the vio lent and dark in the first place, see Johnny Wilson's editorial this month, as he discusses the rationale behind the \"fear factor\" in computer gaming. being Politically Correct! We're just saying what we think is funny. We're rebels, man!\" What utter and complete crap!
