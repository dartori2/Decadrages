"JOHNNY WILSON edito in Bring Out Your Dead! How Gamers Will Pay for Dead Game Companies chased common stock (for public companies) and vulture...er...ven ture capitalists (for private compa nies) who all want a return on investment (ROI). If games are big hits at 100,000 units sold, and oday's com puter game industry is a lot like the old geezer in Monty Python & the Quest for the Holy Grail who insists that he's not dead, yet. To be sure, the list of obituaries for 1996 is fairly long: Crystal Dynamics, Digital Pictures, Intracorp, QQP, Sanctuary Woods, and Viacom to name a few. Already in 1997, GTE Entertainment has closed ils doors. In addition, 1997 layoffs at Interplay and 3D0 (including serious reductions at New World Computing), as well as 1996 reductions at Acclaim, Sierral Dynamix, and Spectrum HoloByte, have some buzzards (not to be confused with vulture capitalists) circling atop the emaciated bones of the entire industry. Does that mean that the com puter game industry is in danger of disappearing? No, the overall number of dollars being spent on computer games is growing. The entertainment software industry as a whole hit pretty near the $1 bil. lion mark in 1996, and more titles are hitting the 100,000 mark in sales than ever before. So, what's the problem? There are four forces putting the squeeze on computer game pub. lishers in 1997: MDF, development budgets, investor expectations, and Moore's law. I'll briefly describe each one to show you how they affect publishers' financial health. First, MDF, or Marketing Development Fund, is the price that publishers pay in cooperative advertising, catalog insertions, shelf-talkers, end-cap displays, racking fees, and the like, in order to get products on the shelf in a retail chain. Companies that want to have their games on the shelf are paying an increasingly high price to do so. Even then, products are only given a few weeks to prove themselves because there is a such a glut of titles in the retail channel. Few products are given a chance to get legs by being discovered by gamers. Second, development budgets have skyrocketed. Some of us call this the \"WING COMMANDER IV effect.\" Developers reasoned that it games could cost $2,$3, $4., $6and even $12 million, respectively, that their games should have those kinds of budgets, too. So, in a two year period, we've seen game budgets move from an average of less than $500,000 each to a point where every developer thinks $1 million is a puny budget. Assume that a publisher gets an average return of $20 per unit. That means you have to sell 50,000 units to break even on a $1 million develop ment budget. Third, these ever-increasing development budgets have been funded by investors who pur ( The list of obituaries for 1996 is fairly long: Viacom, QQP, Digital Pictures Intracorp, Crystal Dynamics and Sanctuary Woods, to name a few. Fourth, Moore's Law essentially states that computing power is doubling every year. Currently, the 18-24-month long development cycles for computer games simply cannot keep up with the pace of new systems. If a game slips radically from its scheduled release, publishers may have to sink hundreds of thousands of dollars into salvaging projects which, upon release, seem archaic and outdated. Such products can really cost publishers. So, what's going to happen? In 1997, these pressures will close another 2-5 game companies. Another 3-4 will be merged into other game companies. The envi. ronment won't be right for new start-ups, and the total number of available titles will drop for the first time in many years. What will that mean for gamers? First, it will mean reduced selection. Of course, judg. ing from the sales numbers, we weren't buying too many of the lower echelon games, anyway. Second, it will mean that the industry will want to take less chances on fresh, new game concepts. Sequelitis will increase at a frenetic pace and game companies will try to build and milk franchises. Successful role playing games will spawn combat sims and real-time strategy games, and vice versa. Third, it will mean that online will become the experimental platform that PCs used to bebreak-even is 50,000, that ROI doesn't look very good, does it? Over the last couple of years, game publishers have essentially extend ed their credit to the breaking point in order to fund (over an 18-24 month period) these more aggres. sive budgets. Now, the loans are coming due. CC APRIL 1997 "

Wright ( li there is anything the Internet has taught us, it is that people don't like to pay for what they're accustomed to getting for free. 72 \"Dead\" or \"Not dead?\" It may be a morbid game, but it conveys a truth: sometimes, people and their life's work affect us so much that they seem alive to us, even when they have physically died. Frankly, 1 believe that online gaming is the future. I believe online multiplayer games will be the dominant form of gaming by the year AD 2005. Yet, when I see the circa 20,000 subscribers at Mplayer and TENwhen they need significantly more than 100,000 subscribers to make their business models work-1 know why some people may be asking whether online gaming is dead or not dead. When I see multiplayer game developers suddenly gasping for cash flow because of AOL's ill-considered utopian panacea of flat-rate monthly pricing, I have to ask: dead or not dead? After attending Mpath's 2nd Annual Online Game Developers Conference in February, I feel like online gaming is at a critical juncture. Financial models are announced and subsequently dissipate faster than some of those new elements on the periodic table. Rumors were flying at the conference that AOL was planning to add an hourly surcharge for games. It's logical, but it could also be disastrous for them. If there is anything the Internet has taught us, it is that people don't like to pay for what they're accus. tomed to getting for free. So, game subscriptions for various seasons, corporate sponsorships, and oldfashioned commercials have become a vital part of the everevolving online gaming strategy. Dead or not dead? It's way too early to declare online gaming as dead, but if some more viable financial models don't appear pret ty soon, we may have to move it into intensive care U.S. Publications Group President, U.S. Publications Rooni Sonnenberg President, Business Media Group Claude Sheer President, Consumer Media Group J.

In issue #150, Jan.\"97, page 236, as part of your review of NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB '97, a screenshot is displayed of the Packers' Reggie White putting the rush on the Patriots' Drew Bledsoe, thereby fullfilling your prophecy of the up-coming Super Bowl! Wow, I only wish you could have shown a shot of the scoreboard late in the 4th Quarter. (By the way, Bledsoe completed the pass for a 36 yard TD to Terry Clen.) Keep up the good work.

"READ.ME THE GAME IS OUT THERE. GL Quake Unleashed -Files fans will be relieved to hear that the much-anticipated adventure game, based on the popular TV series, sounds like it's going to be worth the wait. The script will be written by X-Files creator Chris Carter, and the game will star Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny as FBI agents Scully and Mulder. Some minor characters from the show will make appearances as well. The X-files' director of photography has also signed up to work on the project, which is being developed for Fox Interactive by Hyperbole Studios, and is slated for a December 97 release. The game will be based upon one episode from the show's second season, but original live action footage will be produced specifically for this project. Fox is keeping this project tightly under wraps and we've yet to see any actual code, but rumor has it that all will be revealed at E3 in June. Charlotte Panther armack and Abrash have done it again. The QUAKE engine was very impressive, and VQUAKE showed why 3D hardware will forever change action gaming. So what do you do for an encore? Well, id Software has released GLQUAKE 0.9, written to the Open GL (OGL) API. This version runs on any 3D graphics board that supports OGL in Win 95, though the reference platform is 3dfx's Voodoo chipset. On Diamond's Voodoo-based Monster 3D board, we ran GLQuake at 640x480x16, and were wowed by the image quality. Gone was any texture swim, but most visually stunning was the alpha blending effect on water. The translucency is striking, and when you jump in, underwater surfaces undulate to simulate refraction. These visions need some serious horsepower, though id is still optimizing GLQUAKE to squeeze out more performance. For 3Dfx owners whose Renditionowning friends have razzed them over not having QUAKE support, this should end that debate.Dave Salvator Livin' Large: the left image s from unaccelerated QUAKE running at 320x200x8-bit.

Here's the scoop on some of the goodies you can expect to find on store shelves later this year. Sierra will introduce the newest member of their sports lineup, FRONT PAGE SPORTS: Golr, in April. Designed by Links 386 designer Vance Cook, FPS: GOLF will let desktop duffers indulge in 12 types of play on two complete courses, the Prince, in Kauai.

BETRAYAL AT ANTARA BETRAYAL AT ANTARA, Sierra's \"spiritual descendant\" to BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR (the real sequel is being published by 7th Level), is finally nearing completion after months of delay. This all-new RPG, which Sierra says is being targeted more towards the casual gamer than the hard-core role player, takes place in the decaying and corrupt Antaran Empire, where characters will become entangled in a huge story of political intrigue and magic. The graphics, interface, and spell ODE and combat systems all looked fansound, and the Vision 360 panoramic engine, which allows you to move in any direction. Although the game is single-player, it will have an online chat feature for exchanging information with other players. SHIVERS: HARVEST OF SOULS Sierra continue its SHIVERS series with ShivERS: HARVEST DF Souls, an adventure game aimed at twenty-somethings, in which you venture to the mysterious town of Cyclone to make a music video. Problem is, the other members of your band are missing, and weird things are happening in the town. You must uncover the mystery and save your friends.

"READ.ME Pacific General Sailing This Summer Twinsen Returns hen we last saw V 3D action/adventure hero Twinsen, he was collecting his in the works CGW award for 1995's Best Adventure of the Year, RELENTLESS. Created by vision ary French designer Frederick Raynal (ALONE IN THE DARK, TIME COMMANDO), RELENTLESS was a goofy, surrealistic, ahead-of-its-time romp. Now Raynal and the folks at Adeline Software are finishing the sequel, TWINSEN's Odyssey, to be published by Activision this June. TWINSEN's Odyssey begins with the planet Twinsun in deep trouble once again, when aliens land and begin kidnapping all the magicians and children It's up to Twinsen, of course, to set things right. With a brand new 3D engine, deep gameplay via multiple paths and side quests, and, most importantly, Raynal's uniquely artistic approach, TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY looks like one of the most promising adventure games of the coming year.Jeff Green with the photo-realistic splendor of PANZER GENERAL 10 looming on the horizon, PACIFIC GENERAL is forced to stretch the original PG engine to its limits. The naval aspects, especially carrier operations, have been totally revamped to reflect the war in the Pacific, in the works while still retaining the simple learning curve of other games in the series. Unlike STAR GENERAL, campaigns are included, both for the Allied and Japanese sides. Planned historical scenarios (numbering over two dozen at press time) include Manchuria in the mid-1930s, the capture of Singapore, the Coral Sea, and the battle of Midway. In classic GENERAL fashion, alternative scenarios and campaign pathways are also available. Brilliant victories may see the Japanese capturing Hawail, overrunning India, or even fighting for faraway Madagascar. The Allies may end the war sooner than they did historically, or even forgo the atomic bomb and launch Operation Olympic—the never-executed invasion of the Japanese home islands.

How many of us have wanted to say those words, command the Enterprise, and save the galaxy in the nick of time, just like our favorite starship captains? Soon, gamers and trekkers alike will be able to step into the shoes of Captain Picard and maybe even into those of the best starship com mander of all time, James T. Kirk. It'll then be up to you to stop the evil scientist Soran in Spectrum Holobytes adaptations of the success ful Star Trek: Generations movie. portion, where you move from planet to planet. Navigation takes place in stellar cartography, the interactive planetarium from the movie, where Data and Picard walk onto an observation deck that appears to be thrust into the very depths of space. From this screen, you scan for Soran, as well as enemy Romulans and Klingons, and then send away teams to various space stations and planets. CURSED KLINGONS You'll fight the Duras sisters and the dreaded Romulans in the arcade-style space combat sessions. a member of the away team, you'll explore aban. doned installations, derelict space stations, and planet surfaces. There will be enemies to kill, but that won't always be the thrust of your missions. Some missions will also involve puzzle solving. WOLF IN THE FOLD STAR TREK: GENERATIONS is being billed as an action game, but this title plays more like a jumble of different genres, and the resulting brew isn't half bad. GENERATIONS, due to ship in the late sec ond quarter of '97, is equal parts space combat and first-person action/adventure. Added to these two styles of gameplay will be a space navigation WE'RE NUMBER ONE Riker's on the receiving end of a phaser blast. The first-person gameplay does have action, but there is also a good amount of adventure elements and puzzle-solving here. MAKE IT SO The game also features many cut-cenes lifted straight from the movie. It's exciting footage, and seeing Jean-Luc giving orders in smooth full motion video adds to the game's enjoyment. The pre-bela version is only playable in sepa. rate sections, and some of the gameplay still needs tweaking. I hope that the first-person mode will be playable in SVGA graphics (the VGA graphics of the early version looked dated) and that the controls for action and space combat will allow for customization. Though the decision to release a game based on a two-year old movie is perhaps dubious (First Contact, not Generations, is fresh in everyone's mind). GENERATIONS still has the mak. ings of a good \"Star Trek\" game. I hope that Spectrum can pull all the pieces together for the ultimate \"Star Trek\" adventure. ENGAGE Once you've identified an enemy fleet or a place of interest, you can enter space combat or the first person action mode. Space combat is simplified, but there are such options as redirecting energy to different systems (such as shields and weapons) and targeting specific locations on enemy ships (such as engines or weapon systems). The first-person aspect of the game looks very much like any other first-person 3D shooter. However, the gameplay isn't quite as cutthroat.

"COVER STORY COVER STORY 'Mech Killer The Makers Of MECHWARRIOR 2 and MECH 2: MERCENARIES Turn Their Guns On Battletech With HEAVY GEAR. With a Richer Universe and New Weapons, HEAVY GEAR Features a Much More Realistic Combat Environment BY JOHNNY L. WILSON AE fter the smash hits MECHWARRIOR 2 and MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES, Activision has decided to bite the hand that bleeds them. When FASA opted to regain control of their MechWarrior property, Activision licensed a new game universe and abruptly turned-guns blazing-on FASA's upcoming MECHWARRIOR 3. Now, it's dueling giant robot games, with Sierra's EARTHSIEGE 3 in danger of getting nailed in the crossfire. HEAVY GEAR uses an enhanced version of Activision's popular MW 2 engine, but the game's universe is strikingly richer and more realistic than anything I've seen of its kind. Instead of the sparse Battletech universe where combat usually involves a small number of 'mechs, HEAVY GEAR'S universe includes a much wider variety of military units and combat tactics. As a result, realistic miltary tactics for combined arms play center-stage in HEAVY GEAR's drama. He who has the biggest armored assault unit doesn't always win. It may well be that he who has the most well-placed artillery or the closest assault aircraft will win. It may also be that he who has the fastest Gear will win. However, one thing is certain, this isn't your father's Battletech. Getting In Gear HEAVY GEAR is the future of war-hot, fast, violent, and deadly. Imagine Bosnia and Vietnam rolled into one, a civil war with guerrilla overtones in the far future. So, terrain and objectives dictate tactics in HEAVY GEAR, and one-on-one engagements between two giant robots are decidedly rare. The giant robots, or Gears, in HEAVY GEAR are not restricted to lumbering walks and jump-jet assisted aerobatics, but have secondary move. ment systems consisting of wheels and treads, or both.

This will be depicted in the game with fluid animation for rolling Gears. In HEAVY GEAR, the pilot is seated in the chest of the Gear, viewing the action from exterior sensors. The input is displayed on a laser crystal screen inside the pilot's helmet. This fictional detail has two very important effects on gameplay. First, it means that there are no cockpit struts to deal with, so the Heads Up Display is full-screen rather than broken up. This allows for easy-to-read con trols like the new wrap around radar/compass display. It also allows for new special effects like the wire-frame damage display to see how badly you've trashed your enemies. Second, it means that a damaged sensor array can force the pilot to look through a small viewing slit. Naturally, this will give you a very reduced view and add a nerve. wracking challenge to gameplay. HUD'S UP! The new Heads Up Display used in HEAVY GEAR offers a less obstructed look than the constricted cockpit in MECHWARRIOR 2.

At first, the population tried to find habitable planets using generation ships, but these efforts failed. Eventually, they discovered that worm holes could lead to other star systems. Shortly after the establishment of several colonies, a war broke out on Earth and the colonies lost contact with the mother planet On Terra Nova, the planet where all of the computer game action will take place, the colony balkanized into approximately 10 city-states. Eventually, these small city-states banded together into larger factions. The Confederated Northern City game seems very compelling. Your unit was captured by an enemy force. You even tually escaped, but you couldn't bring help before the rest of the unit was executed. Your character is labeled a coward and a traitor. To make matters worse, your com mander's son was a member of the unit that was killed. Guess how popular you are at your base? The only one who still believes in you-your girlfriend, who happens to be another Gear pilot—is then captured by the enemy Naturally, the game will feature an Instant Action option for those who don't want to bother with the story. However, those who like to have story interwoven with their battle scenarios will enjoy the elaborately produced cut-scenes in HEAVY GEAR. Those who like story elements will also enjoy the fact that characters who appear in the cut-scenes will also be heard in voice-overs on the battlefield and some may die or become wounded on the battlefield, increasing the number of ethical dilemmas faced by the player.

"COVER STORY LET'S MECH A DEAL Getting Your Bearings In The 'Mech Universes Weapons are the heart of combat, and I particularly like the handling of weapons in Heavy GEAR. Each Gear has grasping claws, and many of the weapons are designed as giant analogs of human hand-held weapons. Some heavy weaponry can be mounted on a Gear's shoulders, but most of the weapons can be picked up by the claws and used very quickly. Analog weaponry has enabled the design team to create a Gear con struction utility that is more versatile than any 'mech lab in the MECHWARRIOR 2 products. The construction utility features \"snap-on\" graphics and easy database modification so that you can build robots on the fly in WYSIWIG (What You See Is What You Get). In the past, even the limited 'mech lab tools allowed you to change the functionality of a 'mech, but not necessarily the way it looks in the game. HEAVY GEAR'S WYSIWIG is an extremely nice touch that has the added benefit of making the salvaging process easier and more meaningful. Finally, each pilot has an N.Net (short for neural net) box that works with him like a low-tech Star Wars R2 unit. The N.Net boxes learn from the pilot's own behavior, and the human and net work better and better as a team after each successful mission. The N.Net boxes start to take on a minimal personality (nothing like the more elaborate R2 units we know and love). Pilots shot out of their Gears will usually grab their N.Net boxes as they evacuate, because starting over is painful. In the game, a veteran N.Net unit will boost the pilot's control over various functions on his Gear. Consequently, players will hate losing their N.Net boxes. New Gear Resolutions Those who are worried that Activision is simply going to place HEAVY GEAR atop an unimproved MECHWARRIOR 2 engine will be relieved to know that this is not the racing the paths of giant robot game licenses through their relat ed companies is like trying to track a pack of Novas from a BattleMaster. So download this data into your onboard computer and it'll help you rapidly identify the combatants. FASA practically invented the giant mechanized fighting vehicle genre with its Battlelech game world. Since 1986, FASA has offered its Battletech products for role-playing fans. In July, 1987, FASA licensed the Battletech universe to Activision for use in the first 'mech combat game on the PC. But the first product to appear under the license was a roleplaying game from Infocom, THE CRESCENT HAWK'S INCEPTION. It was developed by Westwood Studios, the COMMAND & CONQUER folks. At the same time, Dynamix was defecting from EA and began building the 3Space engine. Activision struck a deal with Dynamix to use its 3Space technology in building the first Battletech combat sim, now known as Check out the MECHWARRIOR. The game was a solid suc. designer notes on cess on the PC, selling close to 100,000 MechWarrior 3 at units at a time when few PC games did. htlp://www.com In the early '90s Activision began work putergaming.com on a sequel to MECHWARRIOR. Dynamix was now part of Sierra and, ironically, working on the first EARTHSIEGE. Then, the first Activision team encountered plenty of unanticipated difficulties. After years of delays and several design team changes, the company released MECHWARRIOR 2, MW 2: GHOST BEAR'S LEGACY, and MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES, all of which more than doubled their ancestor's sales. Now, FASA wants the franchise back and, just as Activision has grown to dominate the giant robot genre, the partnership is over. That means that FASA--not Activision-will release MECHWARRIOR 3, currently in development. FASA is adapting its Baltletech virtual reality game (playable at Virtual World Entertainment centers) to the PC, but this will be FASA's first PC game for home users. Without rights to the Battletech game universe, Activision could have opted to design its own giant robot universe from scratch, but the MECHWARRIOR 2 design teams advised against that. The teams suggested that they would end up with a universe like Sierra's EARTHSIEGE series, where the technology is excellent, but the background wasn't as involving and deep as Battletech. The team felt this had hurt EARTHSIEGE and didn't want Activision to make the same choice. So Activision went out and bought the license for a new giant robot role playing game, Heavy Gear, from Dream Pod 9. Finally, to make matters even more confusing. Spectrum HoloByte has purchased a FASA license for a real-time strategy game using the Battletech game universe. That means that between now and next spring, we can expect four all-new, giant robot games to play out our futuristic combat fantasies. Blaseep 25 HOT WIRED!

"COVER STORY DESERT FOX In a tactic similar to those in desert tank battles, Gears can go virtually hull-down behind sand dures and spring an ambush at the optimal time, case. Activision isn't throwing away their success ful engine, but there are a host of changes. First of all, the new engine supports 640x480 resolution and Direct 3D support out of the box. This means that you get 3D card support from the start: you don't have to wait for an enhanced version. It also means that D3D will handle the potential floating point problems with new MMX systems. Also, HEAVY GEAR will feature rolling terrain, more detailed texture mapping, terrain interaction, and terrain deformation. In terrain interaction, the Gear's performance can be either impeded or improved, depending on the surface type. It also means that Gears will be able to duck and cover behind 3D objects in a dense, detailed terrain world. It's amazing what a difference it makes to have your enemies disappear behind sand dunes and reappear over the rise or duck behind the cor ner of a building. Terrain deformation means that there are not only more \"live\" buildings that can be pockmarked and destroyed by fire, but that structures and terrain will have a campaign persis. tence. Destroy a building in one scenario and that building stays destroyed throughout the campaign. If that building happens to have strategic significance as a reloading center for ammo or a com munications center for calling in air strikes, you could be hurting. HEAVY GEAR role playing game (a '98 product to follow the combat simulation). Mamais contend. ed. \"In the past, we were constrained to tell stories that had already been told. Now, Dream Pod 9 has agreed to publish stories from the computer game in the paperback universe.\" He also suggested that HEAVY GEAR, in both its boardgame and computer game form, will benefit from its ANIME look (Anime is the popular Japanese animation style used in films like Robot Carnival, the grand ani. mated robot battle, and made-for-television videos like Macross, the original title of RoboTech.) Gear And Loathing Jack Mamais, the Director of both MECHWARRIOR 2: GHOST BEAR'S LEGACY and MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES, is particularly thrilled to be working with a new universe. Currently working on the HERCULEAN COMPETITION High Gear Rather than rehashing the past glories of the giant robot genre with HEAVY GEAR, Activision has the potential to create its future. The competition from EARTHSIEGE 3 and MECHWARRIOR 3 will be sav. age, but HEAVY GEAR has a great lineup. With more combat options and vehicles, increased terrain interaction, persistent terrain deformation (destruction is persistent through the campaign), cleaner HUD design, better animation, and more Anime. style story than its predecessors, HEAVY GEAR IS likely to keep the metal fires burning into the next millenium. of content to be an \"also ran\" in the Battle of the Giant Robots, Sierra's Dynamix division is pulling out all the stops for this Fall's EARTHSIEGE 3. Dynamix created the original MECHWARRIOR for Activision, and from meeting with EARTHSIEGE 3's development team, it appears the group is tired of all the newcomer upstarts stealing its glory. On a recent visit to Dynamix's offices in Eugene, Oregon, CGW got an early look at the engine that will power EARTHSIEGE 3, and we were quite impressed. An even further evolution of the updated 3Space technology that will power RED BARON II and X-FIGHTERS, the engine convincingly and smoothly rendered fully-textured 3D hills, valleys, and flatlands. In fact, the textures were so realistic and inviting (even before 3D card support) that we were surprised when Hercs were unable to travel into the water. Missions will be of much greater scope than in earlier EARTHSIEGE games. Look for hovercraft, tanks, and other vehicles to play a part in the larger battles-all of which you can pilot, in addition to the 'Mech-alike Hercs. The Cybrid enemies now have a menacing, organic machinery look that should add nicely to the game's atmosphere. It's still a bit early to call the game, but with all the user suggestions Dynamix is incorporating into the game, it looks like EARTHSIEGE 3 may have what it takes to grab the attention of even devoted MECHWARRIOR fans. EARTHSIEGE 3 URBAN GUERRILLA The urban environments in HEAVY GEAR are denser, more detailed and more varied than those used in the MECHWARRIOR 2 series. CGW APRIL 1997 "

"LOYD CASE TECHNOLOGY worry about multiple versions of your Windows graphics drivers, plug-and-play headaches with your sound carcl, getting a dedicated game card to be recognized, whether or not networking conflicts with your game. the list is seemingly endless. Every time you solve one problem, another seems to pop up to confront you. The DirectX installation routine just makes things worse. Who hasn't shuddered at the message \"Your video drivers are not certificd for DirectX Do you want to install new drivers?\" sonably stable Windows 95 configuration. Then there's the issue of technical sup port. One of the promises Microsoft kept was that DirectX would help reduce technical support costs, a serious issue in the game biz. If you make a single tech support call, all the game company's profit from that game you just bought goes out the window. Fewer tech support calls means having fewer support engineers, lowered infrastructure costs, and so oneverybody's happy. As anyone who has perused the Usenet news groups or the game forums in some of the online services knows, the volume of support problems has seemingly increased. I've had to walk several gaming buddies through the hassle of download ing and reinstalling recent drivers for their graphics card when a DirectX installation completely based their Windows 95 installation--even the game wouldn't run. IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T OVERWRITE IT Of course, some game developers compound the problem. One of the really nice features of Windows 95 is CD-ROM AutoPlay. Unfortunately, in their zeal, developers have done really \"fricnclly\" things, like run the DirectX installation routine in a kind of auto-pilot mode, liappily overwriting your carefully crafted, reaTHEN THERE'S DIRECT3D When Microsoft bought Rendermorphics, and with it, Reality Labs (a.k.a. Direct3D), they bought a decent tool-set for writing real-time, 3D graphics applications. In fact, Direct3D (D3D) is one of the better software renderers, meaning your system's CPU handles the chores of turning 3D geometry into images you see on the screen. Unfortunately, the world is moving to hardware 3D accelerators, where D3D's performance is spotty. Hardware vendors have expressed dismay over performance hits they've encountered (sometimes upwards of 50 percent) running on D3D as opposed to their own chip-specific APIs. The most recent release of CLQUAKE, along with id Software's abandonment of a D3D vers ion of their flagship 3D shooter, doesn't bode well for Microsoft's 3D API. Another problem is that D3D offers a somewhat rigid framework for graphics hardware vendors to support. For example, D3D doesn't make use of bus-mastering clirect memory access (DMA) to move data across the PCI bus, putting cards which can use DMA, such as those based on Rendition's Verité graphics chip, al a disadvantage. het SEE BILL RUN \"Then there's performance.

NORTON UTILITIES COMUNE DATIN DRIVER'S ED: EDITING THE REGISTRY DATABASE  In the old days, Windows kept all information on drivers and installed software in WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI. While those files still exist in Windows 95, the modern way is to edit the Registry database. This consists of two hidden files, USER.DAT and SYSTEM.DAT which live in your Windows directory. The easiest way is to make backup copies using XCOPY or some other copying method. You should do this before installing a new Windows 95 game or piece of hardware. Don't run REGEDIT, the registry editor, and use the export function. If you make some changes, then re-import the old data (it's only merged with the new stuff), rather than returning to the old state. The latest version of Norton Utilities has a registry tracker. allowing you to make multiple backups of the registry. In addition, it supports the new FAT32 file system and has some other cool features, so you might consider getting it. If you do, don't run System Doctor by default, as it eats CPU cycles you might rather have for that demanding Windows 95 game. pause every few minutes because it's polling for a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. which supplies dynamic IP addresses. Some ISP's use DHCP to ration IP adclresses, giving you a session-specific address in lieu of a fixed one. Tivo possible solutions are cither to use a fixed IP address, which your ISP may not like, or to un-bind TCP/IP from the Ethernet card. Loyd Case, the gearhead, loves cigging into this type of technical stuff. But why should Loyd Case, the gamer, have to spend his valuable time worrying about it? LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL Windows 95 gaming is not all that bad, and works surprisingly well most of the time. But it's far from the panacea the marketeers at Microsoft promised (surprise, surprise). From many users' perspectives, DirectX-based games have simply replaced one set of headaches with a new, unfamiliar sct of others. Over time, Windows 95 will evolve into a fully 32-bit operating system-likely absorbing parts of Windows NT in the processand the current state of DirectX will get better. But there's still a long road ahead for all of us. As game designers become more comfortable with the tools, and as Microsoft begins to take gamers more into account, things will get better. Until then, remember to keep your latest drivers handy, back up your Windows registry before installing a game, and invest in a good un-installer utility CGW APRIL 1997 "

"Push It, Click It, Pull It, Flick It: the New Crop Contro] Intial of Game Controllers by Loyd Case Fetisi U ne mest of the most personal decisions gamers make is their choice of controller. Everyone has an opinion, from those who demand the utmost realism to those who want a fast, comfortable gamepad for fighting games. A few years ago, you could find a few joysticks (of varying quality) and maybe one gamepad for the PC, if you wanted anything else, you were out of luck. Then CH Products shipped their original yoke and rudder pedals, but these seemed limited to the Microsoft FLIGHT SIMULATOR set. This began to change when Thrustmaster burst onto the scene with their original WCS-a combination analog throttle and button controller that introduced the concept of HOTAS: Hands On Throttle And Stick. Other vendors realized that there was money to be made in controllers, and the trickle became a flood. This month, we'll look at a variety of game controllers, but we'll leave the high-end, hyperrealistic flight controllers, throttles, and rudder pedals for next month. MIGHTER PHOTOS BY JOHN POPPLEWELL "


"Gamepads or a long time, the only gamepad available for the PC was the sturdy, limited, but inexpensive, Gravis Gamepad, Lately, though, with more arcade action bursting onto PC screens, a host of gamepads have landed on store shelves, entic. ing players with dreams of snappy action and high scores. We tested these pads with FX FIGHTER, RAPTOR, and FIREFIGHT to gauge their capabilities. G our CASANG CH Gamepad The Gamepad is CH's first shot at the gamepad market. It's a very basic, but sturdy, gamepad with a good feel and simple controls. The button presses seem very solid and the response to trigger presses seems quick. The thumb dish is pretty tightly sprung, however, which can lead to some fatigue after prolonged use. This solid, inexpensive controller is a good choice for people who only play the occasional arcade game against a computer. Pros: It's simple, inexpensive, and has a good feel. Cons: It's too simple for some newer games and has no multi-controller capabilities. CH Gamepad: $29.95 CH Products (617) 598-2518 www.chproducts.com Creative Labs GamePad Though known for their sound and graphics boards, Creative Labs offers an inexpensive, very easy-touse digital gamepad for about $30. The GamePad is Directinput-compatible, and you can run two GamePads with a standard joystick Y-cable. In terms of game-play, the GamePad is very responsive, and has two index-finger buttons that can be mapped as third and fourth buttons, or can be programmed for different functions. A utility for programming comes with the GamePad, as does a copy of BATTLE ARENA TOSHINDEN. The only downside is that the buttons and thumb pad both feel soft and a little flimsy, and an overzealous gamer might wear this controller out pretty quickly. But the GamePad is very comfortable for gamers with larger hands, and is very affordable. It also offers easilyconfigured dual user mode with two controllers. Overall, it's a fine controller for part-time arcade or sports title players. Pros: It's inexpensive, designed for larger hands, and responsive. Cons: Its overall feel is somewhat soft, and it may not withstand prolonged hard use. Creative GamePad: $29.95 Creative Labs (800) 998-1000 www.soundblaster.com Gravis GrIP Gravis advertises its GrIP as a gamepad system, which is a pretty accurate description. The street price for one of the GrIP kits is over $100, but you get two gamepads and the multiport module for your money. While the gamepads themselves are responsive and quick, the Multiport hub is the real heart of the system Refreshingly, it only requires a single game port connection, but supports up to four Grip-compatible devices and two standard joysticks. The pads themselves support an analog mode, so any game that uses an analog joystick can use the Grip. However, when the Grip is in digital (\"GrIP\") mode, the pad can be programmed with keystrokes using a Windows 95 utility, GrIPKey. If a game supports GrIP mode-many EA sports titles do--the pad is a little more responsive than in analog emulation mode, though the action is light and fast in either mode. The combination of easy multiplayer setup, nice feel, and a high degree of flexibility makes the Gravis GrIP a real winner if you can afford the entry fee. Pros: Up to four players can use one module; it's also light, with quick response. Cons: Pricey to get started, and there are cheaper single player solutions. Gravis GrIP: $115.00 (two pads and multiport module) Grip kit: $29.95 (2 pads only; must own GrIP module) Advanced Gravis www.gravis.com APRIL 1997 CGW "


"HARDWARE Contro) Gamepads reisi RATED A Gravis Gamepad Pro Last year, when Gravis shipped the Grip, it got a lot of attention for being a great game controller, but its high entry price put some people off. Gravis has now shipped an updated version of their venerable Gamepad, right down to the little detachable joystick handle. It looks a bit like a lite version of al Sony PlayStation controller. This gamepad felt very nice under my hands-it was very responsive to trigger presses and pad action. The assembly felt good in my hands, too; however, those with larger hands might want to look elsewhere, as it is a bit on the small side. A flip of a switch will turn the Gamepad Pro into a standard analog gamepad. It comes with a dual-headed connector, so you can add a second player easily, and you can plug into the GrIP hub where it's fully compatible. It looks like Gravis has come up with a real winner. Pros: Two player support (more with Grip Hub), a good feel, and quick response. Cons: Skimpy manual, and the gamepad assembly is too small for larger hands. Microsoft Sidewinder At first blush, the Sidewinder looks like a killer gamepad. It feels good to the touch, too, but extensive play reveals a couple of warts. First, it's a Windows 95-only controller. It will work with DOS games, but only if they're launched directly from Windows 95. Since FX FIGHTER consistently crashed from Windows 95, we had to get a demo version of FX FIGHTER TURBO (a Windows 95 game) to test the Sidewinder. Second, the Sidewinder's action is solid and quick, but despite the seemingly ergonomic feel, my fingers grew weary after about 15 minutes. However, one nice feature is the ability to daisy-chain up to four Sidewinders for multiplayer action. Pros: Easy setup in Windows 95, a good feel, and multiplayer support. Cons: Can be tiring after long play, doesn't work in DOS, and is problematic with dedicated game cards -Thrustmaster Phazer Gamepad As with its joysticks, Thrustmaster has put its own spin on the gamepad, offering a fully programmable device in the Phazer. The Phazer has very light but precise action, and it actually works reasonably well as a crude driving controller. There are also switch-selectable settings for standard analog gamepad and fully programmed Phazer mode. Unfortunately, the Phazer is a little clunky to program, and occasionally programs wouldn't take, even after downloads. Once you get it working with a game, though, you'll probably like the feel, if you can remember which control performs which function Pros: It's programmable, has an analog throttle, comes with many options, and has a light control action. Cons: Expensive for a standalone gamepad, and its programming tools are finicky and too complex Gamepad Pro: $34.95 Advanced Gravis Computer Technology (604) 431-5020 www.gravis.com Sidewinder Gamepad: $50 Microsoft Corp.

(503) 615-3200 www.thrustmaster.com Catching the Next Bus: USB 7 is shaping up as a year when PCs sprout several new appendages. Intel's Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) will move graphics data off the PCI bus. But perhaps a more important arrival will be the Universal Serial Bus (USB), which will most likely replace serial, parallel, keyboard, mouse, and joystick ports. With a USB hub on your desktop, you'll only have to run one USB cable down to your CPU box, a welcome change from the spaghetti mess most of us currently endure. Why does this matter to gamers? Anyone vexed by an analog joystick whose calibration drifts after a while will welcome USB, as will any gamer with multiple game controllers for different types of games. In addition, USB gaming devices should all but eliminate the CPU overhead that current analog gaming devices create. USB has two data rates: 1.5-Mbits/sec and 12-Mbits/sec. Game controllers will operate at the slower data rate, which is still an order of magnitude faster than current joystick ports. USB will also allow devices to be hot-swapped while your PC is on. It gets better: USB can accommodate up to 63 devices. Many new game controllers have digital input, and USB versions of them will most likely hit store shelves later this year. Logitech, Thrustmaster, and Alps (Alps Gamepad shown at left) have already announced USB devices, and others will follow suit. Should you wait for USB? If your system has Triton II CPU support logic, it's most likely USB-ready with a BIOS update. Some companies have USB controller cards in the works for older systems. But, Microsoft has yet to provide the key missing ingredient: Win 95 support of USB, which should come out later this year. If you want to wait for USB, save your pennies for a higher-end USB controller later this year.Dave Salvator CCW APRIL 1997 "

"ARDWARE Control Misc. There are a few controllers that don't easily fit into other categories, but certainly have their place. With 3D shooters coming out of the woodwork, a new host of curious controllers have come to market providing alternatives to the traditional keyboard/mouse combination. Also, a gaggle of driving titles has helped usher in several driving controllers, bringing a little more realism to these games. Depending upon your gaming tastes and budgets, you might want to check these out. Space Orb 360 At first glance, the SpaceOrb 360 looks like a gamepad with a cancerous tumor on one corner where the pad controller is. In fact, the ball that takes up a quarter of the left side of the controller offers a full six degrees of freedom-fancy language meaning that the controller works in 3D space. The SpaceOrb takes a lot of getting used to but if you're heavily into 3D shooters, this might be just the controller you want. My most frustrating issue with QUAKE, for example, is looking up and down while moving. SpaceOrb's QUAKE driver allows you to free-look while running in circles, jumping up and down, and shooting. The initial learning curve is steep, though, because the ball is quite sensitive, and operates in every direction. You definitely need to develop a light touch. Until you get the hang of it, it's very easy to over-steer, which in QUAKE or DUKE 3D means a toe-tag. Another reason for developing a light touch is to prevent your left hand from getting fatigued. There is one other problem with the SpaceOrb 360: After playing DUKE and QUAKE with the SpaceOrb for a while, it will be very, very difficult to go back to the keyboard and mouse.... Pros: It's a true 3D controller that works very well in 3D shooters. Cons: Steep leaming curve, and it needs a serial port. nected to the unit. Assassin's configuration software is DOS-based, but pretty straightforward. A Windows 95 Directinput driver was in the works at press time. Also, documentation is detailed, with setup instructions for a dozen titles. Like Spacetec's SpaceOrb 360, we had to get through a learning curve before the Assassin got really fun. On the upside, Assassin provides excellent free-look control, allowing minute movements in Quake and DUKE 3D, handy for shooting through those hard-to-reach places. If you're a hard-core action gamer, you may want to consider the Assassin as a tool of the trade. Pros: Allows very smooth freelooking in 3D shooters. Cons: Somewhat sleep learning curve, and it requires editing of config text files for each game. Grand Prix 1 Thrustmaster pioneered the concept of HOTAS for flight controllers. Now they've brought that RATED A concept into con concept into the relatively low-cost Grand Prix 1 racing wheel. All you need for most driving games is on the main base, including the wheel itself, two trigger buttons (duplicated on the wheel) and a pair of paddles vaguely reminiscent of driving aids for the disabled. After using it, though, I would be reluctant to return to a more traditional driving wheel with foot pedals. Once you get used to the paddles for throttle and braking, the driving wheel is very easy to use. It only took about half an hour to get up to speed on INDYCAR 2. a game that has always made me feel like! needed to go back to driver's ed class. If having all the controls on the wheel doesn't bug you, then check it out. You might be pleasantly surprised. Pros: Hands-only throttle and steering for the driving set Cons: It's not the most realistic driving controller Grand Prix 1: $89.95 Thrustmaster, Inc. (503) 615-3200 www.thrustmaster.com SpaceOrt 360: $99 Spacetec IMG LOW (508) 970-0330 www.spacetec.com PowerrampThe Powerramp looks like one of those arcade control platforms available for a number of console game units. It uses only a keyboard pass-through (no game port needed). You can program it with the keystrokes you want (as with the Eagle max, up to 10 keystrokes per button) or you can download a preset program. It's a fun controller for games like TOMB RAIDER and other 3D shooters. Pros: It uses only a keyboard connector, and has easy programmability. Cons: Its keystrokes occasionally lag. Assassin: $49.95 First-person Gaming (510) 264-9577 www.fpgaming.com -Wingman Warrior At first glance, the Wingman Warrior looks like a fairly GA standard flight controller, until you notice the spin-knob. The knob is used to spin your character, which makes the Warrior suitable for 3D shooters. It was a gas firing up DUKE NUKEM 3D with the Wingman Warrior setup. The stick is configured so that side-to-side action of the stick strafes (i.e., side-steps) while the knob spins you around. This makes for some very interesting tactics, like being able to easily run in an arc while maintaining your target acquisition. Bear in mind that it does require a free serial port, but it will not interfere with a mouse on another port. The only downside, other than the use of the serial port, is that the documentation is spotty and inaccurate in a couple of cases. If you're heavily into 3D action games, you might give this one a close look. Pros: Innovative design for 3D shooters and easy setup software. Cons: So-so as a flight joystick, and it requires a serial port Wingman Warrior: $99.95 Logitech, Inc. (510) 795-8500 www.logitech.com First-Person Gaming Assassin Another new kind of controller is First-Person Gaming's Assassin which has been designed primarily for first-person shooter games like QUAKE, Doom, and DUKE 3D.

HOW DO WE RATE? We only review finished products, not pre-release versions. The ratings are as follows: Outstanding: The rare game that gets it all right. The graph ics, sound, and gameplay come together to form a Transcendent Gaming Experience. Our strongest buying recommendation. Very Good: A high-quality game that succeeds in many areas. It may have minor problems, but is still worth your money, especially if you're interested in the subject matter or genre. Average: A mixed bag. It can be a game that reaches for the stars, but falls short in several ways. It can also be a game that does what it does well, but lacks flair or originality Weak: A game with serious problems. Usually buggy, seriously lacking in play value, or just a poorly-conceived game design-you should think long and hard before buying it. Abysmal: The rare game that gets it all wrong. This is reserved for those prod ucts so buggy, ill. conceived, or valueless that you wonder why they were ever released in the first place. APRIL 1997 CGW "


"**** REVIEW  LEISURE SUIT LARRY 7: LOVE FOR SAIL! DIFFICULTY LEVEL The Lust Boat 9d87180INSAO Leisure Suit Larry Takes His Salty Act to Sea, but Is the Series Sinking? By Charles Ardai ans of Sierra's long-running LEISURE SUIT LARRY series will be glad to hear not only that there is a new game out LEISURE Surr LARRY 7but also that it ends with a promise by the designers to deliver, in short order, LEISURE Surr LARRY 8. Even though fresh material and ideas don't appear to be in great supply, Sierra keeps churning these games out. Installment number seven is subtitled LOVE FOR SAL! and is set on a cruise ship. Number eight is referred to, variously, as LUST IN SPACE and LEISURE Surr LARRY EXPLORES URANUS, and seems likely to be set on a spaceship By the time Sicrra gets to LEISURE SUIT LARRY 10, or 20 or 30and I have no doubt they will --good old number seven will surely be remembered only as the one on the boat head\" than in LEISURE Surr LARRY. But even the funny stuff is, by and large, predictable. Love FOR SAIL IS a clever pun, and some of the character names are brilliant (Al Lowe outdid himself by naming a bigbreasted mother/daughter country music duo \"Wydoncha and Nailme Jugg\"), but otherwise most of the jokes are the obvious ones you'd come up with if asked to imagine a Larry game set on a ship: \"blow the man down,\" \"thar she blows,\" \"long and hard and full of sca men.\" \"yo, ho,\" and on and on. Is there anyone not still in grade school who will find these jokes fresh and witty? pays his way by making balloon animals, all of which come out looking like phalluses, and so on. Is it funny stuff? Sure, some of it is though a lot of it doesn't go beyond smiggering at dirty-sounding words and juve. nile gross-out humor (How do you clear a crowded casino?

"REVIEW  LEISURE SUIT LARRY 7: LOVE FOR SAIL! ADVENTURE/RPG WHEN ARE THESE DUE? Among Larry's on-board tasks, he must woo the prim-and-proper ship librarian, Victorian Principles. Should he succeed, he'll be rewarded with a tour of of one of the ship's more off-limits sites. Man Trophy. Our boy Larry wants to spend a week cruising on the captain, but he has his work cut out for him since he can't bowl, is no good at horseshoes, only thinks he's a great lover, throws snake eyes at the craps table, doesn't cook, and wears polyester outfits that date back to the first time John Travolta was popular. LARRY DOES MACGYVER That's the basis of the game's puzzles: One way or another, Larry has to win cach event. This means turning the horse shoe pole into an electromagnet (so that it draws his horseshoes to it), persuading a sexually supercharged stand-in to have sex with the Lovemaster 2000 robot in his place, chemically treating the bowling ball and pins to make them more responsive to one another, making some special nolose dice, whipping up a quiche that will drive three celebrity judges into an orgasmic frenzy, and convincing the world of haute couture that leisure suits are the height of high fashion That would be plenty to do in one game, but it's not all you have to do. There are also a half dozen women other than the captain, and to finish the game Larry has to make time with every one of them. There's also a mysterious woman in black, who hires you to kill her husband. In the game's most distasteful sequence you do just that, by jumping into the old man's bed and humping him to death (Larry then spends the rest of the game insisting that he's not homosexual). I certainly could have lived without that. LOWE BROW if you're a long-time adventure gamer, you'll recognize some familiar Al Lowe touches in the above description. Aside from the lip-smacking delight in smuttiness, there's the use of a single, fairly small environment to contain all the action (the entire sluip comprises only about twenty locations) and the abundant interlocking, multi-stage puzzles. However, the territory the game covers is familiar for other reasons as well. I already mentioned the \"Beavis and Butthead\" overtones; the game also draws inspiration from earlier games such as Steve Meretzky's SPELLCASTING 301: SPRING BREAK and from 'IV shows like \"Three's Company,\" which also featured a naive, balding loser named Larry whose sole goal was to score with chicks. As it happens, though I don't much care for \"Beavis and Butt-head,\" I am a big fan of both Meretzky and \"Three's Company,\" and I'm generally fond of Al Lowe's work. So why did LOVE FOR SALL! leave me a bit dissatisfied? Part of it may be the technical glitches. For instance, shipboard announcements play at random times throughout the game, often talking over important audio you're trying to hear. Another problem is the interface for using objects: The syntax always has to be \"Use door with key\" or «Use pot with cheese\" rather than the more intuitive \"Use key on door\" or \"Put cheese in pot.\" But the bigger problem, I think, is that the series is showing its age. The graphics have never looked better and the puzzles are fine, but how many times can you put this wretched out through the same paces? How many times can you laugh at a rehashing of the same dirty puns? Worst of all, when the designers run out of dirty jokes, they start making self-referential jokes about the earlier LARRY games (\"There's nothing in the trash can,\" says the narrator: \"But Al Lowe always hides something in the trash can!\" Larry replies) It gets to the point where the writers start making jokes about how how predictable and lame their jokes are. Where can you go from there? LOVE FOR SAL! will probably sell a lot, and a year from now we'll be talking about the next sequel, but that doesn't change the fact that the whole affair is getting routine and more than a little limp. Al Lowe and his crew are having to work harder and harder to keep it up, and the effort shows, LARRY 7 never rises above halfmast, and I have a bad feeling that number eight might not make it up even that far. & APPEAL: People who enjoyed \"Porky's\" and \"Hardbodies\" in the theater and who haven't grown up much since. >PROS: Few designers these days create puzzles as clever and well integrated as Al Loweno \"collect the crystals\" or \"push the levers\" here. >CONS: Relentlessly and repetitively smutty. Even smutlovers may yawn when they can see the jokes coming from a mile away. CGW APRIL 1997 APRIL "

Up close, FIFA players are quite hideous, looking somewhat like mutant QUAKE rejects. The best way to avoid the heebiejeebies is to play the game from a wideangle, overhead view. The biggest disappointment, and one that will come as no surprise to many of today's frustrated gamers, is the game's killer system requirements. Even if you satisfy its recommended conditions-a Pentium 133, 16MB RAM, and a IMB PCI video card, many details of the game must be dumbed down to achieve smooth gameplay. Those with less-thanstellar systems shouldn't even consider buying this game, because clipped frame rates and sluggish control response render it virtually unplayable. Solutions include reducing the graphic detail, which makes it downright ugly, and decreasing the screen size; neither of which are satisfactory options. . Overall, FIFA SOCCER 97 holds a slight advantage over its competition, with fluid gameplay, a variety of play modes, better roster size, and multiplayer capabilities but be sure you have the hardware muscle to power it Microsoft spectators gives the backdrops a certain clegance.

While Microl eague has licensed the names of NFL players, they did not obtain rights to the team names or logos. Be prepared to invest a few minutes manually editing team names unless you don't mind watching the Philadelphia Hawks play the Dallas Rangers. Although this game system has been around for years, there are still a few warts. It's a liability not to know which unit your opponent has on the field, particularly on defense. On forth-and-one, for example, are they going for it or punting? Should you call a punt return or a short-yardage defense? MPF keeps you guessing. Did your opponent send in his three-wide-receiver formation? Should you bring in your nickel package? Again, you just don't know. This lack of insight can badly burn you, especially against a human opponent. Also, while the game thrives on stats, their presentation could be better. For instance, the rushing and receiving stats are lumped together in one table. There are, however, excellent drive summaries and play-by-play charts. The bottom line is that MICROLEAGUE PRO FOOTBALL 97 offers a refined game engine loaded with realistic NFL flavor. The new version takes a big leap graphically over its predecessors, and will please hardcore pigskin fans with a solid Al and multiplayer options.

"REVIEW  PRIVATEER 2: THE DARKENING Crash and Burn SIMULATION/SPACE RIVATEER 2 is unusually unstable for a WING COMMANDER-series game. Among the program's unpatched (at press time) bugs are numerous potential crashes during video sequences and transitions, as well as incompatibility with some rendition-based video cards (3D Blaster owners may find relief in the latest BIOS update on Creative Labs' Web site, www.creaf.com). In addition, this DOS game requires you to reboot Windows 95 in exclusive MS-DOS mode--it's getting a little late in the game not to support running in a DOS box. Until the inevitable patch is released, save often; especially before and after accepting any mission, or when leaving a planet. If the game crashes when you try to land on certain worlds, try making sure that CD number one is inserted before you touch down. ogy, look, or plot devices to the Kilrathiravaged sectors we have seen evolve and grow elsewhere. PRIVATEER 2 continues the slow clcterioration of flight models that we've seen since the advent of the movie tochmology. While WC4 allowed a choice of a slightly realistic inertial flight model (that felt a little like flying), or a simple arcade mode (that was more like driving a space-truck); PRIVATEER 2 only lets you drive the truck. The combat portion would be much more exciting if your ship didn't go from flat-out to dead-stop faster than my old car. The graphics are truly beautiful, but the movement makes them seem sterile and unrealistic. The flight Al for your opponents is weak. Apart from a few distinct maneuvers for some of the ships, they all fly straight in at you, guns blazing, and then tum aimlessly trying to pick you up again. As long as you stay moving, you can win any fight by simply refusing to go head-tohead with another ship. Freighters and capital ships also all posses blatant blindspots, and once you find them you can basically pull up, match speeds in a slow crawl, and blaze away until they immolate without even trying to roll themselves over and bring a turret to bear. N o longer are you the brave freighter captain trying to make a buck with strange and exotic cargoes. Now you're a fighter pilot who hires freighters to haul goods. While this might have been an interesting option from the first PRIVATEER, which made you choose between fighters or freighters as a career, taking the freighter almost completely out of the loop takes much of the flavor out of the non-video part of this game. Even if I am expected to believe, despite my contrary experience from the first PRIVATEER, that these big freighters can make a living from the paltry sums!

"PRIVATEER 2: THE DARKENING. REVIEW doesn't sound like enough mileage for your gaming buck, then you should probably pass on PRIVATEER 2. I truly doubt that there will be many people playing this one far past the storyline's conclusion. The sad truth is that even though the game is open-ended, once you get to the bottom of things, the trading and sim portions are just too weak to keep an experienced gamer happy for an extended period of time. MIXED IMPRESSIONS Despite my misgivings on the superficiality of the simulation involved here, I have to admit that I enjoyed PRIVATEER 2 a great deal.

"REVIEW OVER THE REICH Play To Your Aircraft's Strengths STRATEGYZWARGAMES he hardy P-47 Thunderbolt is the game's toughest fighter, with impressive firepower to match. High altitude engagements are its bread and butter, since it is less affected by the thinner air than most other aircraft. If the fight turns sour, the Jug's ability to dive like a brick means escape is generally a viable option Imost an exact opposite of the P-47, the Spitfire's sustained turning ability is unsurpassed. Chaotic furballs expose the Spitfire's biggest failings: an inability to absorb damage and a meager ammo supply. Your best bet is in tight turning fights that leave German fighte rs struggling to stay in the air. ntended primarily to intercept bombers, the Focke-Wulf 190A is nevertheless a dangerous opponent in a dogfight due to the awesome firepower of its four 20mm cannon. Though handicapped by a very poor turn rate, its lightning-quick roll rate often allows it to elude more maneuverable adversaries. and makes several other significant improvements to gameplay. aircraft are encountered, spotting, surprise, escape opportunities, and maneuvering for advantage are all handled abstractly. This operational aspect of the game works well, condensing the tedium of pre-engagement positioning into a concise list of options. As a turn-based game, there's no way OTR can possibly capture the immediacy of a conventional first person flight sim. Nonetheless, serious students of air combat who aren't hopelessly addicted to adrenaline-pumping action should find the varied tactical challenges it presents to be both fun and educational. % vail against the outstanding computer Al. OTR's dogfights provide a good testbed for experimenting with modern tactical doctrines that weren't formalized until after the war, such as loose deuce, where one plane ties a bandit down while the other goes for a blind-side kill. Between movement phases, planes in firing positions have their targets highlighted with approximate hit probabilitics to help you decide whether to pull the trigger or wait for a better opportunity. l'iring options include picking which weapons to use and selling gun burst length (long bursts do more damage, but tend to cause jams). Armament types are historically accurate, ranging from cannon and machine guns of various caliber to rockets and bombs. Damage modeling is quite detailed, with a host of possible system failures. Excellent sound effects and animations make every solid hit or kill a gratifying experience. If a single engagement drags on for long enough, random reinforcements may arrive for either side. The frequency with which they appear can get ridiculous at times, leading to battles that seem to grow without end. Fortunately, a patch is available from Big Time's web site. www.bigtimesoftware.com, which tones reinforcements down to believable levels THREE WAYS TO PLAY Scenarios include the following: canned or player-designed dogfights; over 100 historical missions containing a mix of fighter sweep, intercept, bomber escort. and air-to-ground action; even a tour of duty option that has you manage a squadron of fighter pilots through a series of sorties, possibly changing the outcome of the war in the process. This latter role playing element is very well done, accounting for increasing experience, fatigue, casualties, and special attributes like keen eyesight. You may opt to fly for the USAAF, RAF, or Luftwaffe, and all feature a large assortment of aircraft from which to choose. Each is unique, and demands a different fighting style for maximum cffectiveness. Tivo players hot-seating on one PC, and Internet play with multiple participants per side are both supported, but only for d ogfight missions. Non-combat flying is donc over a large scale map so you can speed through the boring parts. From here, you can set your cruising altitude and decide whether to send some or all aircraft home if they're too battered to continue. When enemy APPEAL: Flight Sim players who enjoy experimenting with multi-aircraft tactics. Wargamers holding any interest at all in WWII air combat. FLIGHT COMMANDER 2 fans looking for a prop-plane fix. PROS: Detailed and accurate simulation of flight, weapons, and damage; excellent Al; nice graphics, sound, and period feel; great interface; very manageable learning curve CONS: Some limitations inherent in a traditional boardgame format, and the order in which planes move occasionally cause strange results. **** CGW APRIL 1997 "

"REVIEW  STAR GENERAL Tactics in Space STRATEGY Z WARGAMES ecause of the computer's emphasis on weak units for ground combat, you should build a smaller, but better-equipped, force capable of operating a unified command. Use long range units to soften up the enemy defenses, and armor for the kill. The Al seems to keep a hefty reserve of resource points, so don't overextend yourself early in the battle. Be prepared for large numbers of enemy reinforcements the first time the computer gets the chance. It is often a good idea to have reserves yourself, or at least to be prepared for a protracted fight. In space, employ the two principles which SPACE DUST GETS IN YOUR EYES Particularly around nebulae and other have shown success in earlier GENERAL games: space terrain, recon units are a must.

If you feel a buming desire to fight endless space battles with relatively little thought, STAR GENERAL is for you. Otherwise, I suggest dividing your time between MOO2 and a dusted off version of PANZER GENERAL, which remains the strongest game in the series. APPEAL: Only for those craving a scoop of vanilla-flavored operational space combat. PROS: Clean interface, simple learning curve, with some fun moments in space fleet actions. CONS: SO generic and lacking in flavor that it generates little of the suspense needed to make a truly addictive strategy game. *** CGW APRIL 1997 "

"***** REVIEW  CAVEWARS DIFFICULTY LEVEL UVANCED STRATEGYZ WARGAMES L Dark Side Of The MOO Battle Beneath the Dirt in AH's Murky CAVEWARS by Mark Clarkson Ifics t has been years since our race was banished to the dim caverns beneath the surface of the world, to dinc on mushrooms and contemplate our shame. Worse, we are forced to share these dreary caverns with other races, each more loathsome than the last the ever-copulating Tarchons, the slug-like Advari, who leave foul, slimy trails in the dirt; and the humans...don't get me started. But our time of shame is at an end. The finest brains of our kind are researching new weapons, more potent magic, and new technologies of all kinds. The time has come to raise up vast armies, lo purge the caverns of Ibido of the other foul races, and to forge an invincible empire here in the dark. And then let those who hold the surface beware! Tv Rovarch pun Alog YUTH rker MINING FOR MITHRIL You'll find that the random maps may leave you in a mineralpoor area, where it's often better to pack up and move on, unlike in Civ II or MOO. Price: 39.95 System Requirements: IBM-compatible 486DX or better, 8MB RAM, 20MB hard drive space, DOS 5 or better, SVGA graphics, 2x CDROM, mouse; supports Sound Blaster and 100% compatible sound cards. # of Players: 1-5 (hotseat only) Protection: None (CD must be in drive) Designer: Broken Arrow Entertainment Publisher: The Avalon Hill Game Company Baltimore, MD (800) 999-3222 Reader Service #: 329 SPELUNKING WARS Welcome to Ibido, the world of Avalon Hill's new strategy wargame, CAVEWARS. Think of it as MOO played in a big hole in the ground. Gameplay takes place on five levels, with holes leading up and down to connect them. You must explore all levels of the vast caverns, locate food and minable metals, and conquer all the enemy races within. There are also a sprinkling of neutral cities throughout the caves, although these needn't be defeated in order to win There are eight different races to choose from, their basic characteristics defined by population growth, combat abilities, strategic movement, and research ability. Research ability is further divided into four specific areas: weapons, transport, cave technology, and magic; and finally, magic is subdivided into the following types: earth, summoning, transport, and viewing. Each race has a unique combination of abilities. Some are incredible with weapons but terrible with magic, and vice versa. Each race (except humans) also has a special ability. The Bergbui cat rocks instead of food, trolls carry out blitzkrieg attacks, the Cakkar are mass murderers..all in all, an appealing lot. You can play either on the Ibido standard map, the Ibido map with random starting locations, or a randomly generated map where you control the densities of metal, food, and open space. At the start of the game, the entire map is blacked out except for the area within one space of your initial city. Intelligence is the name of the game: First, you need to know where the enemy is. Second, you need to know where the metal and food are and how to get them. You can either employ magical spells to reveal new parts of the map, or send units there on foot, in a tank, or mounted on a giant toad. The caves are maze-like and filled with tiny, cramped passageways. Units can only see a space away from them, and you cannot send a unit into non-revealed territory, so movement at the beginning of the game is rather tedious. You'll need metal for most things you build, and it's an exhaustible resource. Metal comes in three flavors: bronze, iron, and mithril; each better than the last. A mithril tank will drive farther and hit harder than a bronze tank, for example. Tomine metal, you'll need engineers. You can use engineers to bore mines or new tunnels up and down to adjacent levels of the cave or through the cave walls, Engineers can also build new cities. When you start the game you're able to build only the most rudimentary weapons: Spears, bronze swords, and the like. To win you'll need to research more and better weapons---flintlocks, machine guns, mobile artillery, and more. CGW APRIL 1997 "

"***** REVIEW  HARPOON CLASSIC 97 DIFFICULTY LEVEL Ship-Shape STRATEGY / WARGAMES Harpoon's Latest Refit Makes the Game Better and Adds New Features by Jim Cobb Det tal SOODNOS EDITO NATO S U VERDE TRIPLE-DECKER SUB The Win 95 interface lets you keep an eye on the fleet and the movement of enemy vessels while you maneuver individual units. ARPOON is the lowa class battleship of serious naval games. The underlying structure is so solid that it's worth any number of patches and add-ons to keep it around. This latest refit not only polishes the model and centralizes the many battlescts, but also adds features that enhance the original. Interactive Magic correctly chose HARPOON CLASSIC as a base, avoiding the multimedia excesses of HARPOON II. The click-and-drag interface is well suited to Windows 95, making the setting of sensor, movement, and weapon parameters; sizing; opening and closing of windows; and designation of waypoints and targets much easier than before. The updated data base, including over 119 entries, utilizes Windows 95's graphics to great effect. The geography in the group map now has textured color graphics; Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean never looked so good. Combat action uses animation instead of movie clips, showing the relative position of weapons and targets, and retains the tension of anticipating hits and misses in one of the first real-time games. Cameplay is left unchanged from the original. You command task forces of varying sizes and objectives, with different combinations of air, surface, and submafine assets (now including marines and minefield operations). Orders are given at the operational level through a set of prompts, and unit micro-management is not absolutely necessary to win. Rather, you must develop a feel for time, space, and the capabilities of assets. HARPOON97 N fare, in limited actions against traditional allies who were backed by Russia? The Scenario Editor is a pleasure for players who'll want to create their own battles. A few familiar bugs still exist. The autoformation of defensive assets doesn't work quite right, and in-flight fueling remains a problem. Experts will find some ciscrepancies in the unit depictions, and synchronizing attacks on the same target from different bases requires more work than seems necessary. However, Interactive Magic continues to correct these with patches. In a nutshell, HARPOON 97 continues a tradition of elegant and enjoyable, if admittedly complex, gaming. The openendedness and continuing improvement of this series make it one of gaming's jewels, and it's well worth the purchase for any naval enthusiast. & Cup Price: $49.95 System Requirements: 486DX-50 or better processor (Pentium 90 or better recommended), 8MB RAM (16MB recommended) Windows 3.1 or better, SVGA graphics, 2x CDROM drive; supports Windows-compatible sound cards. Protection: None (CD must be in drive) Designers: Larry Bond, Alliance Software Publisher: Interactive Magic Research Triangle Park, NC (800) 789-1534 Reader Service #: 330 NOT JUST A GAME, IT'S AN ADVENTURE The interface and graphics allow ready access to an enjoyable and tense simulation. Proficiency, however, requires some study of naval technology. And while the Al is better than most, especially given the complexity of the game, it is still somewhat predictable. A nice plus, then, is a module allowing HARPOON 97 play on AOL versus other human aclmirals (an offer for ten free hours of AOL is included). Veterans will enjoy not only the complete collection of HARPOON battlesets, covering the Cold War and the period after 1990, but also a new calculus for conflict with the EC2000 battleset. Its paradigm is that an European Union, free of NATO, challenges the economic interests of the U.S. Ensuing trade wars heat up into a series of small conflicts involving the latest deadly toys. How would the U.S. werden APPEAL: Serious naval enthusiasts, or anyone who wants some depth with their real-time gaming. PROS: Gameplay and graphics of this proven system are enhanced by the Windows 95 interface. Still the most realistic experience this side of the Naval War College. CONS: Minor bugs, some problems with synchronizing attacks mar an otherwise excellent product. 0 HARDWARE HEAVEN HARPOON 97 is worth owning just for Larry Bond's exhaustive data on naval platforms. ** CGW APRIL 1997 "

"REVIEW  WAGES OF WAR STRATEGYI WARGAMES move, you click on the movement icon (crawl, walk, run) and click on the destination, rather than dragging out the movement line. You click another button to crouch or drop prone. In JACCED ALLIANCE DEADLY GAMES, the right button was very handy, allowing you to casily change the facing of a FIRE IN THE HALL WAGES suffers from quite a few merc. In WAGES OF WAR, problems. For one, the enemy Al appears to cheat at changing facing is a pain, times, having better accuracy and vision. It also doesn't requiring a movement help that there's no compelling story to drive you along order. Actions like picking the campaign up objects are particularly tedious. Worse, finding the much more vulnerable than in, say, cgress point in some missions becomes an JACCED ALLIANCE exercise in hunt the pixel. There's an excessive amount of mouse The movement Al seems to be one of clicking for any action. For example, to the stupidest l've seen in a long time. I would click on a piece of clear terrain only a few steps from my merc, only to be punished with a «sorry, cannot comply\" message. As for getting them to run out of an open door with a single commandforget it. You have to issue multiple commands-run to the door, run through the door, then run to the final destination. There must be a lot of static on that radio. By the way, the voice messages from your mercenaries only adds to the generic feel of the game, as there are only two voiccs-one female and one male-once you get into combat. It's a huge contrast from the wide variety of characters available in JAGGED ALLIANCE. On the other hand, the combat system seems to work well, even though the enemy has the suspicious ability to hit you with small arms fire at extreme range with greater accuracy than you, and also seems to have the best night vision this side of a cat. On the realistic side, proper small unit tactics are rewarded with relatively light casualties and greater chances of mission success. The number of enemies you face is pretly realistic, too: It's not you against the world. CRACK COMMANDOS MASSAGERAL ne of the more annoying user interCrossboa See face quirks in WoW is assigning weapons and gear to your mercenaries before a mission. Check and double check what you order from the catalogs, because once you place the order, you can't return to order more stuff later. Also, when actually handing out goodies to your team, make sure to allocate all the gear-once you leave the weapons loadout screen, you can't go back, and leftover gear is gone. Note any special gear that may be required in a SUIT UP When outfitting you team, make sure mission. Attempting to rappel from a helicopter withyou do it right. You only get one chance to order out rappelling gear means you've hosed the mission. weapons and equip teams. Also keep in mind On the other hand, some government assignments that certain missions might require certain spealready come with special gear, so don't burn up dolcial equipment lars duplicating equipment. Watch the dates at the bottom of the screen when ordering intelligence summaries, planning travel, or sending your unit out for training. Exceeding the completion date is an automatic mission failure. A few missions also have time limits once you launch, so keep an eye on the mission clock. Stance in this game is critically important. Go prone whenever possible-you're much harder to spot and hit. Click the AP Saver button, which reserves action points for opportunity fire. You can exceed an action point limit, but it's made up in the next turn, so watch those negative numbers. Understand the movement order of your team. Since movement order is based on initiative, make sure you don't block a vital door with a late-moving character, or else your high initiative shooters will get stuck. Unlike JAGGED ALLIANCE, there is hilly terrain, which you can take advantage of for defensive bonuses. The enemy Al never seems to take advantage of hillsides, although they will take cover behind obstacles and go prone. WHERE'S THE GAME? Despite its warts, the combat engine in WACES OF WAR is mostly enjoyable. The rest of the game, though, leaves a lot to be desired. Just a little more custom artwork and a bit more personality in each mercenary would have helped a lot; adding an overarching storyline would have been icing on the cake. If you want to practice small unit tactics, then WACES OF WAR is worth checking out. If you're looking for an immersive gaming experience that ties it all together, though, take a look at the JAGGED ALLIANCE games or the quintessential squad-level strategy game: X-Com. APPEAL: For gamers who like turnbased, tactical squad-level combat. PROS: Solid, turn-based tactical combat engine, good graphics. CONS: Engine without a game; awkward interface, generic feel.

"***** REVIEW  BLOOD & MAGIC DIFFICULTY LEVEL STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Blood Without The Magic This Real-Time Version of AD&D's Forgotten Realms is Forgettable by Arinn Dembo RESEARCH ENPROT 1645 MER: 127 ZOMBIE FAITH HERRE 2 DENS EE 12 MOVE 9 YOUR WREITH IS READY cre's an odd combination for you: a strategy title set in the Forgotten Realms of Advanced D&D. It seems like a strange idea at first but, actually, the idea is a natural. In the collected manuals owned by TSR there are literally hundreds of units and characters, all of which have their statistics and special abilities made to order. A strategy game which made good use of this creative backlog would blow HEROES OF MICHT AND MAGIC and WARCRAFT out of the water like so much flotsam, But alas, before anyone gets too excited, I should tell you that BLOOD & MAGIC doesn't blow anyone out of the water. Despite some classic D&D monsters on the unit list, this game of real-time tactical combat comes across as a poor man's WARCRAFT-and mind you, I'm comparing it to the original, not the sequel. Although real-time wargames are currently the rage, virtually everything else about this title is at least two or three years out of date. It's a game that I might have reviewed enthusiastically in 1991-but nowadays, it just won't cut the mustard. MUD AS HELL The basics of gameplay all boil down the basal golems, who can collect mana as little obelisks or become troops in their golem form. Use them to form buildings and upgrade them to other unit types. Blood&blogle Price: $39.99 System Requirements: 486/66 or better, 8MB RAM, 25MB hard drive space, VGA graphics, 2x CD-ROM drive, Microsoft compatible mouse, DOS 5.0 or Win 95, IPX or NETBIOS for 2-player games, 16550 UART for direct link # of Players: 1-2 Protection: None (CD must be in drive) Designer: Tachyon Studios Publisher: Interplay Irvine, CA (800) 468-3775 Reader Service: 333 radically changed the face of war, much like the Tiberium plant in COMMAND & CONQUER. In this case, the McCuffin is a raw, glowing pit in the ground which can collect up to 300 points of magical energy-mana---at once. In the hands of a strong mage, a Blood Forge will also produce a near-endless supply of magical slaves called basal golems. They are the elemental stuff of all your magical armies--the troops, the resource base, and the economy all at once. They will obey any command and can be shaped into virtually any form you desire, so long as you have a facility available and the stored mana to affect the transformation. It takes forly points of mana for the Blood Forge to produce one golem. In its active state, the golem is a little man which walks, fights, and picks up objects on command. At rest, the golem reverts back to an obelisk of mud. As it meditates in obelisk form, the golem collects mana— like a solar cell, I suppose and transfers it automatically back to the Forge. Put four golems together on the naked foundation of a mystical site, and they will join to make a building. Order them to transform out in the open and they'll become a wall of stone--and the more g olems added to the wall, the stronger it becomes. Once you've raised a troop building, you can send fresh golems to the vicinity to transform them into lighting units. And, if your fighting units get too bally beaten up out in the field, you can send them back to the Blood Forge, which will transform them back into basal golems with full hit points. Now this is an interesting notion without any doubt, but it sounds a lot better on paper than it works in practice. Veteran war-gamers have probably spotted the problem already: The system is just too powerful. Logistics is an important factor in real warfare; in BLOOD & MAGiC, it has been completely eliminated. At the beginGO-GO-GADJET-GOLEM! For those of you hoping that there is a lot of Forgotten Realms material in the game, I'm sorry to say that there's very little role-playing involved here. There's a little bit of plot material in the pre-combat animations, but it's all just filler, and has little to do with the game itself. As we begin the game, we are introduced to the Blood Forge, a new technology which las CGW APRIL 1997 "

Mapping isn't generally needed, except in one place where you have to go through a maze. Happily, the maze isn't too large, and since it's logically constructed, it's easy to map out. The game also includes its own map. In three of the lands, an overall view of the area appears when Quickthorpe exits certain screens. When you move the cursor around, the map lights up areas you can travel to, and clicking on one sends Quickthorpe that way. You can save and restore games any time outside of conversations.

"SCORPIA cramped, though, and the save names are restricted to a maximum of 10 characters. The only technical problem I experienced was the game's tendency to lock up on occasion when changing screens. This could happen any time Quickthorpe moved from one place to another. I finally got around this problem by using a boot clisk that loaded EMM386, instead of my usual QEMM. Other than this one glitch, however, the game ran flawlessly. ADVENTURE/RPG played was highly unsatisfactory, and the first, and unpublished, version of this review was highly critical of the whole game because of it. Since you'll never play it this way, I'll ruin it for you: The whole adventure is imaginary, taking place entirely in the mind of a murderous nutcase behind bars. Obviously such a conclusion wouldn't go over well with serious gamers, and I made SHIP HAPPENS Quickthorpe's search for four precious stones will no bones about saying so.

We are all familiar (too familiar) with game companies releasing patches to fix bugs in their games, but it is unusual (unheard of in my experience) for a game to receive a major revision after it's in the box when it has no real technical problems to speak of. But that is exactly what has happened here. FABLE's original ending-the one pot with D-pad and gun, shoot with gun in each hand.

"CHARLES ARDAI extravagant multimedia simulation of Tic-Tac-Toe. Personally, I'm holding out for the CD-ROM virtual touchscreen version of Pattycake & GHARLES TRULY TRIVIAL The multimedia \"enhancements\" of TRMAL PURSUIT can't touch those of MONOPOLY, much less You Don't Know JACK. Stick with the boardgame version. CLASSICS & PUZZLES the questions (a few are read aloud, others contain tiny animations), but these are paltry and desperate attempts, especially since the animations rarely run to completion before locking up YAHTZEE, on the other hand, has somewhat more involved rules and scoring than your typical parlor game, and unlike TRIVIAL PURSUIT, YAHTZEE does provide a simulated opponent. The problem here is that, despite some very rational and useful computer input (it calculates the odds for you before, and suggests plays to you after, each dice throw) and some stunning 3D animation for the dice, YAHIZEE definitely bumps up against the \"who cares?\" problem. True Yahtzee enthusiasts will play it with real dice, and if no opponent is around, then they'll play without one (Yahtzee is, at heart, a kind of solitaire, only using dice instead of cards). The whole concept of a virtual dice cup that uses a precise simulation of the physics of dice throwing YAITIZEE's main attractionborders on the obscene. Simulating brain surgery, driving a race car, or building a cily makes sense. Simulating a dice cup is preposterous. It's a brilliant simulation, but why in the world would you buy a computer game that brilliantly simulates throwing dice? The Rift Between Worlds Is Open Again! The New York Times Bestselling Author RAYMOND E. FEIST Volume Three of The Serpentwar Saga SANITY CHECK To answer this question, the designers throw in extras, such as a version featuring tetrahedral dice, a version with multicolored dice, a battle version in which you can knock your opponent's dice off his rack with your throw, and some especially nice boxtops. There's also a slick, pounding soundtrack, a la TRIVIAL PURSUIT. In the end it comes to the same thing whether the game is as well made as YAHTZEE or as poorly made as TRIVIAL Pursurr. Neither has a reason for existing, and if Hasbro sells any copies at all it will be purely from trading on the popularity of their brand names and consumers' sheer curiosity. Someone, I hear, has produced a multimedia version of Hangman.

"DENNY ATKINSIMULATION/SPACE simulatio ing sim Birth Of A Flight Sim chat cater A-10 CUBA!'s Designer Describes the Creation of His Next Sim ERIC \"HELLCATS\" PARKER t's hard to imagine a software product more difficult to create than a combat flight sim. A successful sim incorporates the historical and technical background that you'd find in the most hard-core wargame, and it has to simulate real-world physics in a convincing manner. The designer must, however, balance realism and historical accuracy in order to provide a fun gaming experience. To be immersive and commercially successful, a sim needs graphics and sounds to rival the best action games. And while not a total necessity, an adventure game-quality background story can do much for drawing in gamers who aren't aviation buffs. Cee, and you thought designing sims was all fun and games... To get a better idea of some of the issites designers face when creating a game, I talked to Parsoft's Eric \"Hellcats\" Parker, creator of HELLCATS OVER THE In two years, we'll be able to do sims that are almost like virtual realitiesbased on real physics. release-lo see the kinds of decisions a game designer is faced with as a new project progresses. PACIFIC and A-10 ATTACK for the Macintosh, and A-10 CUBA! for the Mac and Win 95. Parker's next simulation looks to up the ante in the graphics department and to add some unique enhancements to his already impressive physics model. As of this initial look, Parker is still developing the game's underlying engine; specific aircraft, missions, and other details are still in the planning stage. Throughout the year, we'll follow this project — from initial design, through development, to final -Eric Parker EUROPEAN AIR WAR This sim will focus on the Westem Front during World War II. The primary aspect of the game will be dogfighting, although there will be some groundattack operations as well. Parker shelved the original plan of doing a Gulf War A-10 simulation next (that project may still appear in the future) due to overwhelmSSI's still mum on the top-secret features of Su-27 FLANKER 2.0, the sequel-which is due out around year's end-to their acclaimed hard-core flight sim. ON THE RADAR But the company is about to lift the veil on an unexpected bonus: Su-27 FLANKER 1.5. This mission disk will sport 150 new missions, a new random mission generator, and 16-player head-to-head combat. The game's mission editor has been extended to allow designers to create mission files that last over a period of days, or even weeks. Direct 3D support means that 3D card owners will be treated to ultra-smooth, Gouraud-shaded (but not texture-mapped) graphics. A thorough training manual will be included, designed to get even novice players ready to battle FLANKER 1.5's improved enemy Al. How does Parker make an A-10 fly?

"DENNY ATKIN If Parsoft does publish the file formats, gamers would be able to look forward to a wealth of user-created mission editors, probably with features Parker never imagined SIMULATION/SPACE with fewer dialog boxes than the A-10 series, in order to allow pilots to get in the air faster. One of the tougher decisions centers on mission-planner capability. The current plan is to offer a basic capability that will allow users to set up simple mission parameterswith more detail than the mission generators in the ACES scries or CHUCK YEACER'S AIR COMBAT but not to allow micromanagement POLY WANT A TEXTURE A-10 Cubal used flat-shaded polygons to of every detail.

One of Parker's big concerns is to make the Parker does want to please the players who game as accessible as possible to less expert want to set up excruciatingly detailed missions, fliers, although not at the expense of authentichowever. \"We're toying with some ideas,\" he ity. «As a World War II sim it's more accessible says, \"such as hidden editing features that are off the bat,\" Parker says, \"as it's casier in terms documented in the manual, or going ahead and of controls and instruments.\" publishing specifications for some of the file forThe sim will have a fairly flat user interface, mats and the Al language.\" OPEN SKIES Creating realistic aircraft models is another area that requires much development effort. The developer must make tough decisions to create a small list of planes wanted by the largest groups of gamers. Thus, sim pilots end up getting a lot of time in Mustangs, Corsairs, Zeroes, and lockeWulfs; while fans of Brewster Buffaloes, Yak3s, and Fiats are left grounded. Parker hopes to provide unprecedented flexibility, and to make a lot of aviation buffs happy with what he calls the \"Open Plane Interface,\" which will allow third parties to create new aircraft (FLICHT SHOP for Microsoft's FLIGHT SIMULATOR offers a similar capability, but it's difficult or impossible to properly model the flight characteristics of many types of aircraft using the FICHT SIMULATOR engine).

At that point you've got a world where there's as much to do as in the real world; you could take boxes, stack them on top of each other, and put a gun on top of them to build a defensive position.\" In other words, with real physics, you'd be able to perform actions other than the ones programmers anticipated. Programmers will be able to create their own aircraft, complete with accurate 3D models and realistic physics. \"Since we're doing physics, not programmed motions, planes should come apart realistically,\" Parker says. Other companies could take advantage of the \"Open Plane Interface\" to create a universal API that would let planes be shared between sims. \"With the Open Plane Interface, designers can bypass my physics,\" Parker says, «so real aircraft designers could bypass my physics, supply their own, and just use the collision detection in the sim. They could take up simulated new designs, fly around the pattern, and shoot landings to test them.» end looking simulation.\" Parker plans to take advantage of a variety of 3D cards, but he didn't want to tie the engine too closely to the firstand second-generation cards currently on the market. \"We built a sort of software emulator for 3D cards,\" Parker explains. \"We didn't want to design an engine that would only have a life span of a year, so we built a version of the game that simulates the most important aspects of a 3D card, such as the Z buffer and perspective-corrected texture mapping.\" Parker says the emulation is fast enough that those without 3D cards will still find the game smooth enough to be playable. Parker thinks that the current technology will let him make sims that are much cooler than in the past; but what really excites him is a market-a couple of years down the road when he can assume the gamer has a 3D card. Parker says that freeing up all the processing power that's normally used just to draw the screen will open amazing new possibilities. \"We'll be able to do stuff that's almost like virtual reality not with goggles, but based on real INFORMATION OVERLOAD Parker went on to talk about how physics are implemented in his current sims, and how he's able to work around the limitations of current PC hardware to create cxacting flight models.

Little do they know, though, that the horrors in those halls are but a prelude to a greater cvil that lurks in the catacombs and caves beyond. This month's strategy guide looks at the best strategies for using each character class in DIABLO, in addition to uncovering a few more singleplayer quests. The lower levels are much harder than the dungeons, so you'll definitely need to understand the strengths of your character, and master his strategies, lest your first journey into the catacombs be your last.

BUILDING A FREIGHT TRAIN When adding experience points to a warrior, put an emphasis on strength; we suggest adding two-lo-four points per level up. What's left can be fairly evenly distributed, with more emphasis on vitality than magic or dexterity. Once your warrior's strength hits the 65 mark, be more aggressive about adding points to OH, THE HORROR Rather than be surrounded. the other attributes. fight enemies from just outside doorways. This way, you only need to deal with one enemy at a time as they stream out to fight you. CROWD CONTROL Despite his power, a warrior must be careful when approaching new areas. Marching into rooms and fighting creatures on all sicles will lead to serious trouble in the lower levels. If you enter an area and notice that you've attracted a lot of attention, retreat. This will string out your enemies and allow you to fight fewer at a time as you work your way back. Also, keep your eyes open for doorways, narrow passages, barrels, or anything else that keeps your enemies from flanking you. Last tip-use the shift key when fighting in doorways. It'll keep you from stepping forward into the room after killing the monster in front of you. CGW APRIL 1997 "


"GAMER'S EDGE Quests Galore his month we'll reveal five quests: two on the CG-ROM, and three in this article. Ogden's Sign and The Hall of the Blind are on the CD; and Griswold's Magic Rock, Arkaine's Valor, and The Chamber of Bone are here. MAGIC OCE TO Questo Magic Rock What is the object? To find a meteorite fragment for Griswold that fell to earth and was stolen by the demons of the catacombs. Where will I find the Magic Rock? The Magic Rock is on a pedestal located on level five. It will be in a nondescript room or hallway, but you'll notice it as a rock on a table. What level should I be to recover it? There is no minimum level requirement for Griswold recovering the Magic Rock. If you can already survive level five, then you can recover the Rock. It's only a matter of wandering around and finding it. What will I face there? Typically, glooms and blinks will be hovering around the hallways near the Magic Rock, but as with all DIABLO games, the monsters you encounter will be random. You could face overlords or goatmen, or YOU WANT A ROCK? This is the Magic Rock even Horned Demons. Just deal that Griswold covets. Nothing special, but if you with them like you do any other bring it back, he'll give you a magic ring. monster in the catacombs and you'll have the Rock What do I get? Once Where will I find Valor? Valor you take the Rock to can be found on the sixth level below the Griswold, he will fashion the cathedral. Empyrean Band for you. What level should I be to find it? Your character should be strong Quest: enough to kill Horned Demons fairly easily, Arkaine's Valor as you will have to face several of them at What is the object? To once to complete this quest. retrieve the legendary armor What will I face there? of the warrior Arkaine from its Horned Demons guard Arkaine's Valor, chamber in the catacombs. How do I get it? On level six you In the lower levels, when more powerful opponents (such as night clan goatmen and mudmen) surround you, you'll need to click away furiously and keep your fingers ready over the number keys to replenish your mana when you dip below the 25 percent mark. YOU GOT AXE FOR ME? While having a shield handy to block attacks is nice, nothing beats the crushing power of a good axe. While it's slower to swing than a sword or mace, many times you only need one good hit with the axe instead of several hits with other weapons. It also has a much better chance of hitting scavengers, zombies, devil kin, and their kind. Once you get to the lower levels of the dungeon, you might consider switching to a one-handed weapon and a shield. The faster attack rate coupled with the ability to block and the extra AC come in handy against the tougher opponents you'll find there. Sorceror he sorceror initially seems like the weakest of all classes, but can grow to become the most deadly of all characters. The first thing to remember with the sorceror is to not be afraid to waste mana. You can't wander the catacombs and fire off firebolts at a cautious pace. DON'T BOTHER WITH MELEE Another idea to dispense with immediately is fighting in melee. Don't bother addling too many points to strength; you're a sorceror, not a warrior The sooner you realize this, the better off you are. You would do better to add lwo-to-three points to magic every level, and one point to every other A SHOCKING DISCOVERY Never hesitate to fire attribute. Avoid off your spells at rapid-fire pace. This sorceror melce at all has cleared the room with multiple charged bolt costs, and when spells. IMBUNS MAGIC WEMO A MACHINE GUN WITH SPELLS Always click as fast as you can, because you can fire off magic spells as quickly as a warrior can swing a blade. In the dungeons, you can cleara room full of undead and fallen ones by rapid-firing your charged bolt spell, which blankets the room with a sheet of lightning balls. APRIL 1997 CGW "


"DIABLO STRATEGY & TIPS GAMER'S EDGE Quests Galore will find a long chamber with two doors on the south side. Inside are four Horned Demons and a book about Horned Demon Arkaine. After killing the Demons and reading the book, go through the door at the back of the room. Here you will find the Pedestal of Blood and a bloodstone. Pick up the bloodstone and click on the Pedestal to place the stone there. That will open a passage in the west side of the structure, which was previously all stone. Enter there (go out and to the left) to find two Horned Demons and a second bloodstone. Place it on the Pedestal and another passage will open in the stone wall on the east side. Inside are two more Horned Demons and the last bloodstone. Place it on the Pedestal, and the wall behind the Pedestal of Blood will disappear. Walk past the torches, kill five Horned Demons, and pick up Arkaine's Valor. What do I get? Arkaine's Valor is magical armor that has an armor class of 25, adds + 10 to vitality. -3 damage from enemies, and bestows fastest hit recovery, Chamber of Bone. Walk down The Chamber and you'll see a main door for a large room, and hallways on your left and right. At the end of each hallway are two Horned Demons, one unseen, and a lever that opens a secret door on the right wall of The Chamber. Once you deal with the Homed Demons and unseen in both hallways, open the main door in the middle of The Chamber. You will find 45 horror captains and five unseen. Kill them, and proceed to the room beyond. There will be a few more unseen and a couple of Horned Demons to kill here. In this room you will find a spell book. What do I get? Read the book and you will learn the guardian spell, which causes three dragon heads to burst from the ground, and attack any enemies nearby with firebolts. Quest: The Chamber of Bone What is the object: To survive passage through The Chamber of Bone and gain the knowledge that lies inside. Where will I find the Chamber of Bone? The entrance to The Chamber of Bone can be found on level seven. What level should I be? Your character should be strong enough to dispatch unseen, Horned Demons, and horror captains with relative ease. Sorcerers should be aware that horror captains resist lightning and are immune to magic. How do I get it? First, read the mythical book on level six. It will remove the walls surrounding the stairs leading to The OUTTA MY WAY, UGLY On the automap you'll see the chamber that holds Valor Find the bloodstones, open the secret doors and claim Valor after defeating the Homed Demons. MAGIC CANNONS At the end of The Chamber of Bone lies your treasure: a book of the guardian spell facing a hordle, employ hit and run tactics like the rogue. creatures close to the explosion. Another good spell is wall of fire, which you should always have ready before you open any rooms in the catacombs. As soon as you open the door, lay down two rows of fire walls inside the room, to prevent any monsters from attacking you, and to roast any creatures stupid enough to walk through the roaring blaze to come to you. WHICH SPELLS TO USE It's a good idea to always ready at least one electrical attack, one fire attack, one arca effect, and one defensive spell with your hotkeys. In the lower levels of the dungeons, you'll face off against a collection of monsters, some of whom will resist fire, and others who'll resist lightning So always be ready to switch from fireball to lightning with your hotkeys. Also, flash is a good spell to have if you know you'll be swarmed in the lower levels. Holy bolt is only good in the first six levels of the game because it harms undead, but it is useless against all other creatures. Lightning should be your spell of choice. It can deal multiple hits to a target as the entire lightning bolt courses through an enemy's body; and it continues un-interrupted, so use it to destroy a whole line of creatures. The other major attack spell to have ready is fireball, which is a much better version of firebolt that erupts in a blast that harms any MORE HIT POINTS FOR SORCERORS Since the sorceror has low bit points and high mana, he should always cast the mana shield spell in cach level. With this spell, you'll lose mana points when creatures attack instead of hit points, allowing you to endure more damage than usual. You also eliminate the need to switch between drinking liealing potions and mana potions, and can instead fill your belt with cight fill mana potions, every time you replenish your mana for spells, you'll also be replenishing your hit points. & Join us next month for a guided tour of the Halls of Hell.

Maneuvering on the map sets you up to strike. Here are a few tips on how to bring the hammer down on your enemies: In general, don't engage slow land units. If you have elves, don't march dwarves out against the slow and plodding iron golems. Let your missile units whittle them down before you engage them. Early in the game, relatively weak forces may defeat powerful, but slow, resources guardians by inflicting damage from a distance. If you know the enemy has powerful and fast missile units, you might want to send in flying, fast, or sturdy ground troops instead. A cavalry unit or a pack of ogre lords is a good match against guardian elves, because they can withstand heavy damage and move in quickly. However, if you send in rangers to fight the elves, they'll only trade shots, and you'll lose your valuable AUTO23 83 SKIP FOOLS RUSH IN Don't rush forward to the full extent of your unit's movement-within range of enemy melee attacks-without attacking first.

"GAMER'S EDGE HEROES || STRATEGY & TIPS ranged troops (if you have to lose one or the other, it's better to lose the ground troops) Besides being used to deliver the coup de grâce to the last of an enemy force, flying units can be used to negate missile units by engaging them in melee, a particularly helpful tactic in laying siege to castles with missile defenders. An unconventional tactic is preempting enemy flying units with your own flying units when you are certain they will attack your missile troops. The beneficial effects are two-fold: When the enemy flies across to attack your units, they will already have suffered losses or damage; and, any units remaining in your original formation may strike without fear of retaliation (one exception to this rule is griffons). The drawback to using flying units this way is that you expose your preempting units to attack by enemy ground units. However, if you can use a flying unit for a preemptive attack while negating a missile unit's ranged attack, it's worth the sacrifice. While not as flexible as fliers, slow units have tactical advantages too. Powerful, but dismally slow, units like hydras and ogres may serve as bodyguards for missile units, which tend to be targets for quick land and flying units. When in a melee and prevented from using their missiles, such units shouldn't attack at all because of melee penalties. Instead, your slow units can lumber forward to the rescue. If the enemy unit is extremely powerful, such as one containing a few dragons or a horde of gargoyles, you might decide to sacrifice your missile units by attacking in a melee. This prevents retaliation against your following attack, which uses your slow, but more deadly, melee units (again griffons retain retaliation priviliges, which is why they are such excellent BLUDGEONS AND DRAGONS Flying units are units, despite excellent troops for disabling missile units. Here, indifferent hit the gargolyes and dragons have prevented three points). In most ranged stacks from firing their bows, thus allowcases, just pass ing the slower ground troops to move forward. and allow your slow guardians to rescue your missile units. Besides taking out those powerful melee monsters, those precious missile units you've been protecting often duel with other ranged attack creatures. It's essential to upgrade your units, not just because their attacks become more powerful, but because they tend to speed up. In a duel of missiles, whoever is quicker on the draw may very well be the last one standing. SO Yound Sh the trudne SHE SAY. DE cripple your production, but also, in a pinch, you can sell off resource reserves for gold to raise armies or to exchange for other resources at the marketplace. The exchange rate is better with more marketplaces and though you may feel initially gouged, if you need gems, and all you have is a lot of coal, you'd better take the loss and move forward. Exploration of the map also creates a waming zone-a buffer between the time enemy armies become visible on the map and when they are in position to attack your holdings. You can track their movements, learn how far a given hero travels per day, and also, with the help of a Thieves' Guild, get a fair idea of their troop strength. Sometimes, a powerful group of monsters appears to block your access to important resources. Try to look for another way around them. If you can't find onc, you'll just have to quickly build up a force sufficient to remove them. On the bright side, these monsters can buffer you from the enemy while you develop your forces; however, this works both ways, and your opponent may develop forces free from your interference as well. It's likely that enemies will have access to many more resources and castles, so you still need to press onward. If you wait until you have a very powerful anny before exploring, you'll probably find a lot of resources, artifacts, and mines already claimed by the enemy. OLAY BOLDLY GO... The first thing to do is explore the map. You need to capture mines and treasure chests, and free resources as soon as possible in order to recruit troops and build dwellings. Exploration will also reveal magic sites, such as these standing stones, which boost your basic skills. RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!

Skills are rated as excellent, good, average, and useless. Archery: Excellent. Especially if you plan to have missile troops or have sorceresses, barbarians, and wizard castles, or a combination of the three. This skill is especially deadly if combined with a hero's high attack skill. Ballista: Good. Excellent if you plan to attack castles. Speeds the destruction of castle walls. Higher ballista skill also helps you destroy castle towers more quickly. Diplomacy: Useless. And, if you pick it and refuse to buy up neutral armies, they always attack in anger. At least without this skill, neutral armies sometimes retreat without a fight. Eagle Eye: Good, if you're a spellcaster (provided it is upgraded to expert use). However, it is nearly useless for barbarians and knights, who need a high wisdom first. Estates: Good, or excellent if you don't have many castles or gold mines. Extra gold always helps in recruiting troops. Leadership: Good, and excellent if you plan to have multiple troop types. The higher the skill, the more likely you are to get extra movements or attacks. Logistics: Excellent. It increases land movement, meaning you can cover more ground, visit sites and mines earlier, flee faster, hurry reinforcements to the front lines, and catch up to fleeing enemies. Luck: Excellent. It inceases your chances of delivering maximum damage in combat. Mysticism: Excellent, if your hero casts spells in combat. It allows you to recover mana points so you won't be mana depleted after many battles. Navigation: Practically useless, unless you are in a waterintensive scenario, when it's a good skill to have ABSOLUTELY USELESS When given a choice of secondary skills, never pick diplomacy, it is useless. Eagle eye, on the other hand, is a good skill for a spellcaster, provided it is upgraded to expert use. Necromancy: Excellent for necromancers, but useless for everyone else. When you're attacking many weak troops, you can create a throng of skeletons, which are a powerful force. It's not good for other characters because pesky skeletons will disrupt morale. If you do get this skill, you must upgrade it or it's as good as useless. Pathfinding: Excellent. It cuts down on movement penalties in rough terrain and grants the same benefits as logistics. Scouting: Average. It increases range of sight for exploration, which is helpful in the beginning for spotting sites and mines, but useless in the end game. Wisdom: Excellent. It is absolutely critical, since no wisdom equals no spells above second level. Plus, upgrades are a must to achieve fourth and fifth level spells. beating fact in the face of a superior force. You can rehire a retreating hero for 2,500 gold, but a defeated one, and all of his artifacts, might soon resurface on the other sicle. It's better to flec, then simply rehire your hero and keep the artifacts. You have to preserve the option to flec. This means paying close attention to enemy forces and spell power.

However, if you keep at least one fast or very fast unit remaining in your army, you have a better chance of moving first and flecing.

Cirulis to scream at you for not being born carly enough to win his war for him. o you thought that mastering Allied strategies from WWII would give you an ace in Warfare 101 here at the GDI Academy? Well think again, you misbegotten bunch of second louie wannabe's. Look out the window and tell me what you see on the paracle ground..that's right tanks! And lots of them!

They are also completely vulnerable to chopper attacks. Successful base defense is an expensive prospect for the Russians, as it means multiple tesla coils surrounded by extensive SAM sights with overlapping fields of fire---at least three the speed of the thrust can be maintained.

Though the tesla coil is a terTELL IT TO TESLA The Soviets, despite having the very cool tesla coils, are at a disadvantage in base defense. To complement the tesla coil defense, set up SAM sites near them, and position V2 vehicles nearby as well, for good measure. UNIT BRIEFING trucks in dangerous territory, and a few should be scattered around your base perimeter for added defense, or as a tactical reserve, should anything happen to go wrong. Hind Helicopter: Again, another weapon system dedicated to the Soviet obsession with the anti-personnel role, Hinds are very expensive for their relatively limited uses. If you must use them, employ them in ship-harassment and rocketeer-neutralization roles. Mammoth Tank: The most familiar weapon system to CDI students, this monster takes on an even more vital role in Soviet missions due to its anti-aircraft missiles, which provide the only mobile air-defense in the entire Soviet arsenal. If possible, any Tank Rush or amphibious assault should include at least three Mammoths. employed in close formation in order to concentrate their anti-air and anti-personnel assets, and to serve as a lure for Allied firepower while the heavy tanks mop up. They should also be used to immediately destroy the Allied shroud, even at the expense of defensive fire. Soviet bases should hold at least one Mammoth in reserve. MiG Ground Attack Aircraft: While slightly less vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire, these jets can be useful if you have the money to employ them in groups of three or more. Even against heavier Allied base defenses, they are swift enough to take out A guns in crucial positions while only losing one of their own. After neutralizing Allied air defenses, your MiGs should give priority to destroying helipads. MiGs are especially useful for striking Allied ships and for hunting down ore trucks. Submarines: Your single naval units, they serve only to deprive the Allies of their vaunted naval assets. Use their long-range torpedoes to cut up enemy destroyers and gunboats before they can close to depth charge range. Avoid engagements close to enemy bases, as various shore guns can damage your sub while it is surfaced. To maximize their effectiveness, submarines should be deployed in multiple wolfpacks of three subs cach. V2-Launcher: These missile launchers are slow, have long reload times, and are extremely vulnerable to any Allied unit which gets in range. Despite this, it is your only artillery piece and its extremel y long range means it will serve you invaluably in multiple roles. Foremost, it is a defense cracker. Before your tanks roll in, at least four V2s should demolish the turrets and pillboxes in the assault path. Its second most important role is as a shore battery; a few V2s positioned along vulnerable shore areas can discourage bombardments from all but the heaviest cruisers. V2s should also back up tesla coils, and be set up to interdict valuable ore fields. Because of their vulnerability, they should always travel with armor, and should be escorted by at least two grenadiers at all times to guard against infantry attacks. Yak Ground Attack Aircraft: The Yak is useful only in the field, as even minimal Allied air defenses can ravage a flight of Yaks in seconds. Employ Yaks in attack groups of two or three, to break up infantry groups in the field and to harass any Allied formations that sit still for even a moment.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS RED ALERT The Great Tank Debate The Soviet Tank Rush is so devastating a tactic that there is much debate amongst RED ALERT players whether it represents a severe imbalance in the game design, especially in multiplayer mode. While die-hard students of base defense, myself included, stridently claim that there is no thrust that cannot be deflected by careful base RED AND BLUE DEATH The Soviets have an enormous construction-which advantage with their heavy and Mammoth tanks. In fact, makes the path to your rushing the enemy with a massive force of these tanks is construction yard a path of usually enough to lay waste to even the toughest of bases. quick and certain death there is little doubt that the Tank Rush is a problem for the Allies, and a near-sure bet for the Soviets. Russian commanders in multiplayer games should try and put together an armor assault as quickly as possible, before their Allied opponents have time to sufficiently defend themselves. Then drive for the construction yard, so that even if the assault fails to eradicate your opponent, it will at least cripple them. launchers on the very expensive Mammoth. The only real counter to this problem is to gather your strike force under your SAM umbrella and then move fast and often when it is time to attack. Longbows are deadly, but require a near-stationary target to do their worst damage. Long-range bombardiments from the sea are the bane of any Soviet base, and so it is very important to neutralize Allied naval assets as quickly and efficiently as possible, before they become a threat. Just two cruisers can take out a construction yard in a few seconds, all the while staying safely out of coil range. A combination of sub wolfpacks to handle destroyers, and a pair of Hinds to harass and hunt gunboals and cruisers, is the most painless way to keep your shores safe for the greater glory of Stalin. STUDY HALL This primer should be enough to get you hamsters through the Soviet portion of the tactical history exam. I haven't bothered covering free assets such as the spy plane and the Badger bomber, but their uses are obvious enough for even a cadet to grasp. So take what you've learned and employ it in the RED ALERT simulator. And remember, if it takes a few tries to get it right, just be mindful of the fact that you have it easier than your Soviet counterparts. They had to get it right the first time, or else face a.45-caliber demotion from Stalin himself.& per coil. This line of death should be supported by a few scattered V2s in order to break up Allied infantry making sacrifice plays. The Soviet commander's second-best friend is concrete. Concrete walls are crucial for protecting tesla coils and power plants from direct assault, and should be used liberally While Soviet armor rules the land, their extreme vulnerability to airand sca-based attacks make long campaigns difficult and dangerous. The Russians have the edge in striking power from the air, but are desperately short on air defense themselves, lacking any sort of mobile anti-air assets except the rocket SAVE YOUR MONEY Guarding your ore trucks is vital; if you lose them, you lose your means of making money. Guard them with at least one heavy tank and two grenadiers. TAKE IT TO 'EM A Soviet commander shouldn't waste his time on subtle maneuvers and ambushes Direct firepower often pays bigger dividends, especially when a rush of heavy tanks and V2 launchers is used in fast and furious offensives.

"STRATEGY: TOMB RAIDER GAMER'S EDGE is another platform and doorway cleverly hidden in the vegetation. Jump onto the hidden platform, and walk into this last secret area to find another medikit. small raised area near the second bridge. To cut down on time and distance, get onto this small area and, with the action key held down, jump onto one side of the bridge, and then climb up and run the rest of the way (this maneuver jumping and then grabbing onto something -is called the \"jump'n'grab\"). DART AWAY You can either keep running ahead and watch the darts shoot out of the walls in your wake, or you can inch forward slowly and trigger the darts before each move. THAT AIN'T YOGI BEAR DOWN THERE... Now you'll be in a room with a chasm in the middle. Rather than simply jump across the gap and move on, take a small pit stop. First, get as close to the edge of the gap as possible and, with guns armec, look down. There is a nasty bear wandering about below, and it would be in your best interest to snipe him from above. If you then decide to descend into the chasm, be sure to execute a safety drop, since a full drop will hurt you. When you touch down on the ground, get up, arm your guns, and proceed into the doorway. Two bats will appear and annoy you; shoot them down. After killing the bats, follow the corridor and you will find a medikit tucked into an alcove, as well as a floor plate that opens a secret door that leads back to the room with the bridges. Go back to the room with the chasm in the middle and jump across the chasm. When you see a staircase, go down, but have your guns ready. There will be two wolves waiting to attack, so be prepared. After taking care of the two wolves, you should see two large platforms with a small platform in between. The switch on the first large platform activates the door on the other large platform. Ignore the switch and door for now, and make your way to the platform where the door is. To get there, jump onto the small platform between the two larger ones, and then jump'n'grab the platform that holds the door. Once onto this platform, start walking to the left. Walk all the way to the tiny plank that juls out from the platform. Look carefully, and you'll see that there JUST FLIP THE SWITCH... Okay, back to the door on the large platform. Simply flip the switch and open the door. Easy enough, right? There is one slight problem, however: It's a timed door. To time your jumps and get to the door, use the small platform as a boost. Jump onto the small platform and then dlo a jump'n'grab onto the platform where the door is. This should enable you to reach the door in time. Beyond the door is a large staircase. Don't take a leisurely walk to admire the architecture; keep on running. This staircase is lined up with dart launchers, and only by running will you avoid them all. Also, get your guns ready, as a lone wolf Jurks about at the top of the stairs. Taking him out should be relatively easy, as the element of surprise will be on your side. Okay, it's almost over at last. Now, walk to those funny-looking tiles on the floor, and let them break under you. However, do not drop down to the nearby hallway yet: there are more dart launchers down there. Instead, go along the passage you're currently in until reaching a gap. Jump or jump'n grab across the gap, and walk on Get your guns ready, as the last wolf will be bearing down on you near the medikit at the passageway's end. Pick up the medikit, go into the small room, and flip the switch there. Once you flip the switch, execute a safety drop from a nearby ledge, to bypass the dart launchers. Walk into the open doors, and finish the level LARA'S LONG JUMP This gap in the room leads to a secret area with a medikit, but you need to take out the bear from your sniping point before you descend below. IN THE JUNGLE The third secret area is cleverly hidden behind the foliage. A simple jump'n'grab will get you there. DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS This level should get you acquainted with some of the necessary skills a good Tomb Raider needs to survive and prosper. It's a tough virtual world, so be careful out there, especially in St. Francis Folly and Natla's Mines. But, be persistent, and the Scion will be yours. CCW APRIL 1997 "

Using ResEdit, I swapped in a bunch of sounds from different movies, cartoon characters, and the like. Surprisingly, changing just the sounds really changed the overall feel of the game, especially since the original sounds took themselves a bit too scriously QUAKE's engine, with its modular design, uses PAK files to store all resources: character models, level maps, and sounds. If you look in your QUAKE IDI subdirectory, you'll see PAKO.PAK if you've got the shareware version, and also PAKI.PAK if you've got the full retail version. Sites like Stomped and Blues News have uploads from Quake-heads all round the Web, including new sets of sounds, new models, and even new levels. Among the possible hacks, tweaking sounds is pretty much the easiest, but first you've got to hack the PAK There are several utilities useful for cligging work with the copy there.

Of course, this being the magazine biz, we do things way ahead of time, and it's really January as I write this, so spring is still a bit in the future. Somehow, it always seems to get here sooner than I prefer anyway. The Christmas season was somewhat disappointing this year. A number of products made it to market, but little was really noteworthy. This was reflected in the mail I received. By far, the most inquiries came in about DAGGERFALL. After that, interestingly enough, the questions were mainly about older games, not newer ones. Either the new games are really easy, or gamers are going back to the old classics. Game designers ought to take note of that. But enough philosophy --on to the mail! is no longer possible to join everything in sight, especially temples. You will have to be careful and more selective about which organizations you join now. Finally, quite a few people are having trouble getting out of Privateer's Hold. The exit is in the room with the bat, rat, and imp; it's the black alcove with skull on one of the walls. Simply click on the alcove to leave (this, by the way, is the standard exit from all dungeons). there myself. I do know that, asicle from always being a good guy in the game, you have to go to the Mamingo without Chelsce. This means handling the conversation at her apartment very carefully, if you do it wrong. you can end up at the club getting drunk, which is not what you want. The-Comory Crusaders Of The Dark Savant: Some adventurers can't quite get into the Rattkin Ruins. A bit of prep work is needed for this. For example, you need the bonsai Tree from Murkatos' Inner Sanctum. Then you have to find the right place to plant it (no easy task, either). After all that, you'll be able to enter the Ruins. And if you haven't come across the Sanctum yet, you need to pay a visit to the Orc castle. Daggerfall: Well, we have another update or two here. First, in my original review, 1 said if you maxed a primary or major skill at 100 percent, you would stop gaining levels. Then in the followup, I said this was an error, and you could continue to gain levels with a skill at 100 percent. It now turns out that I was both right and wrong (this could only happen to me...). In the original, unpatched release, you will stop gaining levels when a skill hits 100 percent. However, that was changed with the very first patch, which removed the 100 percent-level cap. Speaking of patches, the most recent one has put in some restrictions regarding guilds. It Wizardry Nemesis: A lot of folks are having trouble with the jaw traps on DEONESIS Hargani Underworld Level 3. I don't blame them for being frustrated; this one isn't all SIRTECH that easy. You need to have the bone on the left side of the jaw, roughly about one tooth in from the end. Then start clicking, but don't click wildly or you'll just put it in and take it out again. Lots of patience and some timing will eventually do the job (twice, since there are two traps to pass; but don't worry, it's only this one time, as there is another way out of here later). That's it for this look into the mailbag Happy adventuring! Eye Of The Beholder II: It's always interesting to see how older games suddenly regain gamers attention, thanks to the miracle of shovelware. It's also interesting to note that the new gamers tend to get stuck in the same places we did. There must be some unwritten law of gaming at work here. Anyway. a popular obstacle in this game is the area with the floor plates and the somewhat misleading sign that says, \"Leave many things bchind.\" Here's a big hint: Do not put something on every plate.

"HALL OF FAME elcome to the Cooperstown of computer games. Here you'llments, the games that broke the records, established the benchfind, raised upon pedestals to commemorate their achieve marks, and held gamers in delighted trances for untold hours. HIGHLIGHTS 6  GUNSHIP A hen ACHO POR Harpoon 360 Pacific, 1989 hen miniatures gaming was king, there was no game that could quite match the balance of realism and compelling gameplay-not to mention complexity-in HARPOON. When Tom Clancy needed the best in declassified naval data for his book The Hunt for Red October, he turned to Larry Bond's gaming masterpiece (Clancy and Bond later met and used HARPOON to work out all the battles for the best-selling novel Red Storm Rising, as well). When this epic finally made it to the computer, it was widely hailed by gamers to be just as accurate as the tabletop version-with a thorough and accessible database to boot. Bond's experience as a retired naval officer and NATO wargames referee was reflected in the quality of play, which was more intense and involving than anything this side of the Naval War College. HARPOON was proof that hard-core wargames could still sell in big num bers, and that real-time games could have plenty of depth and still be accessible enough to be fun. Rumors persist that Larry Bond is considering a HARPOON III design. But in the meantime, we recommend that you check out HARPOON CLASSIC 97 by Alliance and Interactive Magic, which features an exhaustive HARPOON package folded into a welcome Windows 95 interface. Gunship MicroProse, 1989 or many years, MicroProse was the undisputed champion of computer simulations, and it was games like GUNSHIP that got them there. GUNSHIP was designed to be an accurate simulation, and the design team didn't skimp on the sim's look and feel. The polygon-filled graphics moved quickly, considering that the game debuted on the 8-bit Commodore 64. Sim pilots found the distinctive handling capabilities of the Apache a refreshing change from the reflex-intensive jet simulations of the day. The game also included a useful keyboard overlay that greatly simplified the controls. Obviously, newer simulations have passed GUNSHIP by from a graphics standpoint, but few of them have modeled more high-tech toys-inertial nav. igation systems, anti-torque tail rotors, 30mm chain guns, flare decoys, radar jammers, and a treasure trove of rockets and missiles were only some of the fun stuff included in GUNSHIP. GUNSHIP was the first combat flight sim to offer character continuity through a linked series of missions, with such nice touches as R&R for fatigued pilots, and the option to pass on hazardous missions by taking sick leave. Although GUNSHIP spawned a host of imitators, it's significant that it took seven years to finally surpass it: Andy Hollis (GUNSHIP's co-designer) and Arnold Hendrick finally outdid GUNSHIP with last year's AH64D LONGBOW.

"PATCHES omputer game programs have grown so massive, and the number of hardware configurations has become so huge, that glitches are frustratingly common. Software patches to fix buggy programs have become a necessary evil that we'll just have to live with until we reach the golden age of standardized platforms and bug-free programs. New patches are in red. A-10 Cuba: Upgrade 1.01 allows you to reverse the rudder settings, press Enter or Esc without problems, and even center your joystick. What's more, the original A-10 CUBA serial numbers now work. Heroes of Might & Magic II: (DOS and Win 95 Versions) This powerful patch spell adds a random map generator in the World Editor fixes numerous small bugs, and clears up anomalies from the documentation. NHL Hockey Win 95 V1.1: Only for Win 95 versions, this has a number of fixes and enhancements. Don't try modem play unless both you and your opponent are patched, or you may suffer a lockup penalty. Check for new patches on the demo disc. American Civil War V1.21: Many of the speed problems with the game on 8MB machines, or Windows 3.1, or both, are fixed, and the Al is also improved. Jagged Alliance Deadly Games: Cleans up your mercenary mayhem: no more \"No Turn Limit\" problems, or rare speech crashes. It also includes a fix for the final mission of the main campaign and mission 34 of infinite campaigns, plus all the new turn limit options. Over the Reich V1.01: Gameplay hits a higher ceiling, with several adjust m ents to bomber defensive fire frequency of reinforcements, angle of interceptions, high-G maneuvers, and banking. ZDNet Baldies DirectX3 Patch: Fixes lock. up and sound problems in Baldies. Download the patch from www.baldies.com, or receive the patch on disc by calling Panasonic Interactive Media Technical Support at (408) 653-1889. Third Reich V1.21: Mein Herr, we need concern ourselves with neither the Russian deselect unit bug, nor the freeze-up in Win 95. Answer \"ja\" to any prompts to overwrite. Lighthouse Patch: The light does shine more brightly. Palette thrashing is fixed, lock-ups in dark domain are ban ished, and the error opening resource 65535/56 in submarine cavern is cor. rected. The dark side is that you have to start the game over. These patches can usually be downloaded from online networks such as CompuServe and ZDNet, from CGW's Web site (www. computergaming.com), or from individual software publishers' Web sites. Total Mayhem Patch: Improved walking in groups, revised map layouts, and a new settings.exe file make for more mayhem, less frustration. Battlecruiser 3000 AD Release 3C: The latest patch-release 3C-in this ongoing saga fixes a host of bugs. but don't go in with lofty expectations. Links LS V 1.30: Tee off without worrying about the ball flight bug, sound script bug, or match play bug. Use only if you have V 1.0-this patch is not for the European version! Battleground Antietam: Even cau tious General McClellan would be more at ease with this newest battle plan from Talonsoft. Lords of the Realm II: Milord, with this patched sword, you may slay the Internet Explorer scourge, without reinstalling yon Microsoft application. Civilization II V2.42: This prevents crashes with auto-settlers, help, and Civilopedia screens, in addition to other tweaks. If you have V2.41, the only addi tion is that heralds will now animate if you are using 32-bit video for Windows MechWarrior Mercenaries V1.05: All clans will benefit from this latest upgrade from Activision, which repairs a number of Mech deficiencies. F-22 Lightning V1.01.00.18: This strangely numbered file adds chat mode, additional look views, and more native joystick support to NovaLogic's sim. Also, secret missions have been unlocked, and VESA compatibility issues, static sounds, and high IRQs for modems are properly enabled. MechWarrior 2 Windows 95: From Direct X difficulties to terrible torso twists and sinking Mech syndrome, this patch corrects a host of errors. Regardless of your clan affiliation, don't pilot your Mech without it!

"MARTIN CIRULIS what Chwor manna How To Play Games With Women that the last successful western military commander of a female persua. sion was burned at the stake (a cou ple of revisionists are now trying to make us believe she was actually a guy with some odd equipment prob. lems), rather than a nebulous differ ence in brain structure. Despite the endless drivel about women being from Venus and men being from Mars, and the even more half-baked nless you are an utter \"Married with Children\". watching goober most computer gaming guys would rather be sharing our slightly geeky hobby with our significant others, rather than hearing that distant sigh as they shuffle off to bed without us. Lately, especially after the reminiscing I did in my 15th Anniversary column, I've received a few inquiries asking what's the secret of couples' gaming. Benedict and the boys down in the Lab even suggested that I devote a whole column to it. The absolutely dismal ratio of men to women in computer gaming is evident by this mag's demographicsor any trip to a gaming conventionand it tends to make life difficult for those of us who have moved out of our parents' basements and are attempting actual adult relationships. While some choose to interpret the rarity of female gamers as an indica tion that women just don't enjoy games, I tend to think this disparity has more to do with the fact that the past couple thousand years have not exactly encouraged martial skills in women. The fact that women aren't much interested in strategic conflict probably has more to do with the fact CC Women are just as competitive and vicious as men, given the chance. \"odd\" women, but on the other hand, I can also find a hell of a lot more guys who think games are stupid than guys who don't. I think this whole \"boys game, girls don't\" rationale is a cultural red herring. Given that that women don't get much of a chance to indulge the \"gaming\" side of their natures, I think couples gaming is less of a \"What games will a woman play?\" issue than it is a simple issue of \"How to introduce computer games to a non gamer.\" The first thing is to try and find some subject that interests the light of your life. It doesn't matter how easy SPACEWARD HO! is-if silly science fiction isn't her thing, then she's not going to have fun, no matter how simple it is. If your S.O. is a history fan, then you are better off trying something like MACHIAVELLI than Risk. The current wisdom in getting women to game seems to be dump ing them in front of an adventure game or role-playing game and say ing \"Call me when you're done,\" because it seems that the adventure/RPG genre has higher female demographics than the rest of the industry. Even worse is the assump tion that because you've managed to dig up a game that has a female protagonist, your scheming is done and you will have a two-gamer household Here's a news flash: neither the Barbie-voice of LAURA Bow nor the make-up escapades of PHANTASMAGORIA are going to con vince most women that the bells of equality are ringing through computer gaming. Instead of inflicting a selfconsciously \"girly\" game on your mate, you should try working your way through complex games like the ULTIMAS or the GABRIEL KNIGHTS together, trading screen control and note. taking duties while you argue about which characters you can trust. If you want to enter the world of conflict and mayhem with the light of your life, pick a game where both of you can pound on the computer player first. Creeping nervously through QUAKE's gothic halls as a couple, or hunting the Al opponents together in HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC 2, is a perfect way of showing what you find So cool about computer gaming, Blizzard should get some sort of an award from the American Marriage Association for DIABLO. Now you can turn to your mate and say, \"Holy Cow, it's dawn!\" instead of just muttering it to yourself as you lurch off to bed. Once the experience gap has closed, you can move into actual competition-but that's secondary to just sharing what is so fun about the whole thing, and showing her why you play these things every night. if you can do that, you can look forward to increased harmony and a household where nothing ever gets done because there's just one more discovery to make in NETC. studies showing that \"girls want to build and boys want to wreck stuff\" (which frankly seems a little too much based on that whole \"snails and puppy dog tails\" theory), I have found women to be just as smart, competitive, and vicious as men, if given half the chance My 5-year-old daughter is a hell of a DIABLO player, and is great at yelling \"Shoot! Shoot!\" while I try and play NHL '97.
