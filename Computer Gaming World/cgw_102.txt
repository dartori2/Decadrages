"Skepplug lubo TurBillus Bus A Sneak Preview of Electronic Arts' UltraBots by Johnny L. Wilson INGVAR uring the last incursion of the alien cometoid, that 60 year cycle of conquest and destruction where robots (straight from the minds of Japanime screenwriters) destroy everything in their paths (faster than \"The Dirty Pair\" can even manage to destroy whatever they are trying to \"save\" in a given episode), earth's survivors were able to assemble 120 nuclear devices and direct 10 of them at each alien base. The nuclear devastation was great enough to conquer the conquerors and the gigantic 18 meter tall Humanoids, 22 meter tall Net Builders (Scorpions) and smaller Scouts (15 meters high) sat silent. Now, humanity has assembled clones of the alien robots, clones which give humanity an equal playing field with the cosmic threat. Sneak Previews are not designed to be reviews. They are feature articles based on \"works in progressÂ» that CGW's editors have deemed worthy of early coverage. These articles are not intended to provide the final word on a product, since we expect to publish appropriate review coverage when the game is finished. Player BattleTech (on GEnie), MechWarrior (available in Activision's new Bat00000 tleTech value-package) or perhaps, even RoboSport or CyberEmpires. Yet, both the fictional set-up and the style of play is different than one finds in these similar tributes to Japanese visions. BattleTech, in all its permutations, reflects the feudal ideal that still has adherents in modern Japan.

Of course, careful readers of CGW will remember that UltraBots, a game which NovaLogic was originally developing for Data East and is now releasing under the Electronic Arts label, uses some of the hottest 3-D rendered technology we have seen in the last couple of years. They will also expect a game where the players will enter the cockpits of these 3-D robots in order to engage in battle with these similarly armed alien forces as in a half-dozen games before it.

"Sneak Preview influence, it will automatically be repaired. This means that one can have a robot shot up early in the battle and have it return to the fray in a little while after the enemy 'bots have moved on. Since the repairs can only take place within the influence of one's own net, there is a definite strategy regarding how one places the laser relays that cause the net to function. Where the battles really work is where the player struggles to expand the net (the power grid), then draws the enemy robots into a minefield or ambush. In the preview version, the enemy Al is just aggressive enough to blunder into these traps and one gets the satisfying experience of a wellplanned victory. Where the battles can get SSSS 50 frustrating is when a light probe is taking place and the player is frantically jumping from cockpit to cockpit in an attempt to locate the enemy. Then, every time the targeting computer locks onto a robot, the gamer gets the warning message that he/she has locked onto a friendly target. 'Bots Before My Eyes Whatever one's feeling about the gameplay in UltraBots (and it is certainly different than we originally expected it to be) may ultimately be, it is clear that the game features: the most impressive terrain and robot graphics ever seen in the genre; tactical considerations (as well as some limitations) that are distinctive from other games in the genre; and more of a feeling of small unit military actions than has been seen in other robot games. NovaLogic (developers of the game for first, Data East, and then, Electronic Arts) has raised the stakes for simulation graphics and has proven, with both UltraBots and their upcoming Comanche: Maximum Overkill helicopter simulation, that they are going to be a major player in first person perspective, three-dimensionally rendered simulations from this time forward.

"Review The Puzzling Plight of a Princess in Peril King's Quest VI: Heir Today, y Gone Tmofrow by Chuck Miller Nollowing a very successful series of installments, the latest chapter in one of adventuredom's most popular game series is ready to unfold. Sierra's King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow looks to outdo all previous installments in quality of story line, graphics and audio, sheer number of puzzles, player amenities and overall game play. An Heir Raising Experience As the story unfolds, Prince Alexander, heir to the throne of Daventry, finds himself shipwrecked and washed ashore on The Isle of the Crown, one of several mysterious islands which provide the backdrop for this quest. It seems that young Alexander was on his way to visit Cassima, Princess of the Green Isles, when his ship went down. (It was when King Graham rescued her from the evil wizard, Mordack, that Alexander and Cassima first met, apparently, with more than a passing interest in each other.) However, upon his arrival at the Royal Palace, Alexander finds events have taken a turn for the worse. While Cassima was away, her parents became ill and died. Now, he finds her sequestered in mourning, taking no visitors. At least, that is the sequence of events according to Vizier Alhazred, the man in charge and Cassima's recent intended. His inhospitable stance toward Alexander and refusal to allow him to even see Cassima, seems more than a little strange. Determined to see the Princess, Alexander sets out to discover the true nature of the events that have transpired. Thus, the stage is set for yet another King's Quest or, in this case, that of a prince. Get That Heir Out of Your (Inter)Face One of the most difficult acclimations I have ever undergone is the transition from Sierra's old text parser to their new icon-driven one. This is not, of course, because it is more complex, but because of the loss of some of the conversational interaction and depth of personality (if only perceived as such) found in the characters resident in the game world. It seems that the move from a textual to a graphical parser has forever changed the nature of the puzzles and interactions of the past. Yet, with its demise, the textual parser has taken with it the last vestiges of the multifaceted difficulties and cumbersome nature associated with pre-graphic adventures, and replaced it with a more intuitive, user-friendly window to game interaction. It has taken some time on the part of seasoned adventurers (those who cut their teeth on text parsers) to become acclimated to the new interface, and for Sierra to begin to really exploit its possibilities. However, the new parser seems to have finally come into its own with King's Quest VI in a way beyond that of any previous offering. This is a result, in part, to the increased overall scope of the adventure and the many optional puzzles included. Such additions serve to provide a more expansive, and consequently more enjoyable, playing environment (it is nearly twice the size of King's Quest V, weighing HEIR TODAY, GONE TOMORROW in at 18MB). Indeed, this is the first of Sierra's newer adventures where I actually did not miss the character interaction of old. TV Ouest VI TITLE: King's Quest VI: Heir Today.

Background music is also very good, providing a rich, atmospheric environment in which to explore this new world.

"Review faced with an overly perplexing puzzle, and then return to solve it at a later time. Up until the end of the game, the player is relatively free to travel between the four islands making up The Land of the Green Isles. There are even two possible ways into the Royal Palace at the game's conclusion an easy and a more difficult route. The choice made determines the parts of the palace seen by the player. the advancements exhibited in the animation department. Character movement is improved over previous efforts, offering a more lifelike appearance. Especially effective, though, is the spot animation provided throughout this newest King's Quest. Leaves on trees and ferns move realistically, indicative of a \"digital breeze,\" and water appears to lap against the shore. These little touches all help bring the game world to life. Only Her Heir Dresser Knows Many stylistic additions accent King's Quest VI. A unique introduction created by Stanley Liu of Kronos (best known for his work in Batman Returns and Lawnmower Man) features realistic 3-D perspective animation and incorporates powerful \"camera angles\" to provide dramatic effect. This six megabyte animation (based on an original design that used 1.2 GB of hard drive space) does a more than ample job of setting the background for the story that is about to envelope the player. Art and animations employed in inset boxes have also received significant attention. Other new and notable additions include a built-in help facility for the novice gamer, a brief history of past King's Quest games, playing hints for King's Quest VI and a beginner's walkthrough for the first few puzzles all available on-line from within the game. The help feature, in actuality, is an animated tutorial that walks the player through the use of the game interface and the exploration of the opening game screen. Use of icons, insets and object manipulation are fully explained, as are the mechanics of the graphic interface. Information is also provided about the song Girl in the Tower, a love ballad from King's Quest VI that will be one of the first computer game songs to be played on the radio (DEVO's \"Some Things Never Change\" was digitized for Neuromancer prior to its being released on the Total DEVO album). As part of a special marketing effort, 1000 radio stations have been provided with a copy of the ballad to play by request. A listing of these stations with their request line numbers is included in the game box. All the player need do to hear the full rendition of the song is call a local station and request it. Neither Here Nor (T)Heir Since I had played beta versions of the game prior to playing the finished release, I ran across a particular bug early on which necessitated running the game without sound and music to keep a certain action from locking up the computer (it, of course, has been corrected). This left only the IBM speaker available for sound. Gag! Ptooie! Yuck! It has been so long since I played an adventure without a quality sound card, I had forgotten how bad the emanations from a IBM speaker sounded. I could not believe what I heard, or rather, did NOT hear. Players still without a sound card should install one before playing King's Quest VI. It will be money well spent, and will greatly enhance the playing experience. The only area where Sierra adventures still lack polish and professionalism is that of digitized speech. Though there is little speech encountered in King's Quest VI, what speech there is suffers from the contrived and corny sounding voices exhibited in the CD-ROM version of King's Quest V. Professional voice actors are desperately needed. Hopefully, Sierra will make use of trained professionals, rather than their staff personnel, in the CD-ROM version of King's Quest VI that is scheduled for an early 1993 release. Though King's Quest VI supports both 256-color VGA and 16-color EGA on the same set of disks, there is no contest between the two versions. All serious gamers should have a VGA card installed by this point in time, as well as a quality sound card. It is the only way to get the greatest enjoyment from the playing experience. Heir Apparent As mentioned previously, King's Quest VI benefits significantly from a larger game world, featuring more puzzles and sub-plots than actually need to be completed in order to finish the quest. Nearly 50 percent of the total puzzles in this adventure are optional, with many having multiple solutions. To Heir an Opinion It is evident that a great deal of time and talent was invested in this animated adventure, which is, in my humble opinion, the best of the King's Quest games to come out of Daventry, and Sierra's finest adventure to date. The game world is intriguing and entertaining, and the puzzles are varied in difficulty and style, providing a rich and enjoyable playing experience for gamers of all skill levels. King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow has all the signs of becoming a classic. I guess it would be fair to say that King's Quest VI has a certain heir about it. Cow Due to an open-ended game world, no fixed order is imposed on most puzzles encountered. The player is free to move on to solve other conundrums when Page 14 Computer Gaming World "

Wilson illed as the world's first story-telling screen-saver cartoon, Johnny Castaway is a great launch (and subsequent shipwreck) for Dynamix' Screen Antics series. We weren't sure what Jeff Tunnell intended when he formed a smaller creative group under the aegis of Dynamix, but the first few products we've seen from Jeff Tunnell Productions look very different from the award-winning designer's other works.

Johnny will always be a key, will read the disk and start another round of animated slapstick. This staggered pacing shouldn't bother the casual viewer who occasionally glimpses a sequence or two while performing other tasks, but it could be distracting to someone merely wanting to view the computerized cartoons. Also, computer users who use Photo Styler, or any other program that requires the computer to work for long periods without keyboard input, should avoid inlooking in the wrong direction or doing the stalling Johnny Castaway. Those cute aniwrong thing whenever potential rescuers mated sequences can certainly play havoc (whether yachtsmen, aviators, ghost ships with a .TIF file conversion. (Wonder how or whatever) pass by.

The artists obviously emulated the Hart style, as the background is minimalist (the tiniest imaginable desert island, decorated by a single coconut tree).

"Review Athlete's Feats STARCRAFT Accolade's Summer Challenge by Gordon Goble TITLE: Summer Challenge SYSTEM: IBM PLAYERS: 1 10 PRICE: $54.95 PROTECTION: Code Wheel DESIGNERS: Jeff Sember, Mike Benna Mindspan Technologies PUBLISHER: Accolade San Jose, CA Woligang Terme at CE RN E469 nutarur It was a searing summer afternoon as American ironman Brock Studley strode confidently into competition. Days of exhaustive and repetitious training had led to this moment...but that was all behind him now. Once in the heat of battle, there was no turning back. Less than 45 minutes and eight events later, it was all over. Studley had performed well, perhaps better than anticipated, and in the end was bested only by Canadian superathlete Richard DeReux. The day had begun on a high note on the archery range. Studley's 107 point total after the 12 required shots had topped his own tournament record of 103, as he hit a golden bull's-eye. The American's winning ways were to continue next on the cycling oval and the standings after the first two events showed Studley with a dominating lead. Hopes were high for three in a row as the javelin competition began. Yet, Studley would crack under pressure on this day, foot-faulting twice and tossing the sleek missile almost straight up and back down through his own head on his third and final try. His woes continued on the kayak course, as the rattled American missed 10 gates on his way to finishing last. A better result than his training sessions, when an overturned kayak would most often signal his presence on the course. The main stadium was the sight for the next event, the 400 meter hurdles, and although the stumbling Studley would knock no less than three hurdles to the ground, his inherent speed propelled him to the silver medal. Studley found himself clinging to a slim overall lead as he mounted his trusty steed in preparation for the equestrian competition. Less than one minute later, a bruised and battered Studley was picking himself from the ground, being thrown viciously from his uncooperative horse. Another last place finish in the books, this feat would be duplicated in the penultimate event, the pole WINA SPECIALIZED BIKE! vault, as Studley twice ran past the take-off $1000 VALUE area and straight into the cushioned mat Contest without ever getting off the ground. EmbarDetails Inside rassed but undaunted, Studley knew he'd have to be perfect in the day's finale, the high jump, to have a chance at a top three finish. Indeed, he was up to the task, being the only competitor to clear 2.15 meters. A triple gold medal winner at this challenge, Studley finished the competition a strong second. He turned off the computer, all the while mulling over the fact that in the future, he would be going up against professional, then world class athletes. He had timidly watched them before, and although he knew performance enhancing drugs were banned from Page 18 Computer Gaming World "

"Review Three Moe Stooges Coktel Vision's Gobliiins by Chris Lombardi The King Has Turned into a Raving, Drooling Lunatic! Like these Sesame Street characters, the Gobliiins of Coktel Vision (Part of the Sierra family\") creation have set out on a task that only the cooperative use of their individual talents can accomplish. You see, the king of the Gobliiins is being terrorized by a mysterious voodoo-magician prankster. The silly animated introduction to the game shows the poor king poked, prodded and terrorized into a psychotic state, to the horror of his previously peacefully dining family.

"Review again. This is one world where one does not want to use the Force. When one gobliiin commits such a flub, the others in the group don't hold it against him. No, they hold it against you, the player. They realize that the player holds the puppet-strings and they'll let him or her know what's on their minds. They'll gesticulate wildly, hold fingers to their heads to encourage the player to think, and non-verbally plead with the player to get his or her act together. While the player takes their advice and carefully considers the situation, these goofs will wait impatiently for the next Diamond very much in line with the Sierra protocol. The game is entirely mouse-driven and the individual actions of the gobliiins are represented by different mouse icons (a fist, an arrow, an open hand) which the player can cycle through by clicking the right mouse button. A good deal of work has been done to ensure that the player can make a single click with the arrow button and thereby move a Gobliiin to any point on the screen, regardless of whether he will have to walk in a straight line or traverse an intricate path of several ladders. A small feature, but appreciated by those who have played the earlier graphic adventures without such \"path tracing.\" The overall feel of Gobliiins it's simple interface, it's \"click-around\" exploratory nature, the goofball antics of the trio and the silly animations that abound in their world suggests a younger audience appeal. However, many of the puzzles can be quite sticky, and some require a very careful eye â€” occasionally causing even this salty gamer to pause and think. Younger gamers might get a bit frustrated going this one alone, but the game would make great \"lapware,\" where the older gamer makes suggestions about the next move and the younger does the clicking and enjoys the animated results. This is not to say that older gamers won't get anything out of Gobliiins â€” far from it. There is plenty of good fun here for the graphic adventurer enjoying a respite from the more plot intensive quests. Of course, like most graphic adventures this is a \"crack it and rack it\" game, where there is little replay beyond the few nights one will spend the first time through the game. Even so, Hooter, Dwayne and BoBo will entertain a variety of lighthearted gamers so long as these players remember that cooperation is the name of the game, and that the best fruits of labor are those that are shared. Nectarines! Cow mi NIAK, whose magic could counteract the voodoo curse and restore the king's state of mind. This Gobliiin Quest will take the zany trio through a dozen or so puzzle-filled screens of the standard Sierra graphic adventure style. Mastering the puzzles on each screen requires the use of each Goblin's gift. Hooter, a graying lesser magician, casts a general sort of spell that has unpredictable effects. Bobo, a horn-helmed ruffian, is a pugilist and all-around athlete who can climb ropes and land a solid right jab when required. Dwayne, a spry young technician, is the only one of the three that can pick up items and use them appropriately. Thus, with a punch, some item manipulation, and a little magic, the Goblins are on their way. When the Gobliiins find themselves on a new screen filled with items, creatures, and pathways they have little to tell them what exactly is the goal they seek so, a little exploration is in order. The player will pick a character by clicking on him and proceed to punch, zap, or pick up everything he can. Sometimes this hunt-and-click procedure yields fruit a new object or a change in the environmentand the overall gist of the screen's puzzle will begin to unfold. More often, the Gobliiins will end up doing something silly, like causing something to fall on their head or invoking the wrath of some creature or another. Like the old \"Three StoogesÂ» short subjects, it is not only the offending Gobliiin who reaps whatever punishment is due, but the whole lot of them ends up paying the price. You see, the group has a general allotment of collective energy, represented by a bar on the screen, and when one member screws up, the energy is sapped. When this karmic well has run dry, the level is over and must be started TIC move yawning, shrugging their shoulders, turning back flips, chewing gum, playing with yo-yos and whatnot. All of this is entirely too cute and thus, endearing to the soft soul. The world of the Gobliiins is a cleverly created one. The puzzles mostly involved discovering strange contraptions in the bizarre fantasy landscape which will enable the Gobliiins to bypass some obstacle. Most steps toward a puzzle's solution are accompanied by a short, simple and funny animation, and one can always be sure of getting a non-verbal haranguing after every wrong step. Interacting with the Gobliins is quite easy; facilitated by an interface DE LES VELD 1 January 1993 Page 23 "

QG3 takes Lori and Corey Cole's popular adventure series to new heights with an exotic fantasy setting littered with difficult obstacles and malevolent monsters. Gamers can bring along their favorite adventurers from the first two games in the series or start anew with one of three characters: fighter, magic-user or thief. The story begins with the player assumPage 26 Computer Gaming World "


"Review ing the role of the hero who vanquished the evil wizard Ad Avis in QG2, thwarting the evil spellcaster's attempt to unleash the evil djinni, Iblis. While the passing of any evil magic-user should give ues (I would love to see an RPG based upon the ancient Aztec civilization in South America). TORTO None may enter unless requested to do So. gamers ample cause to rejoice, it seems that the death of the evil wizard has released an even greater evil in the Quest for Glory gameworld. Specifically, a demon was released when Ad Avis met his death, and is believed to be the instigator of a war brewing in another part of the Quest for Glory gameworld. Exotic New Landscape While QG1 was based loosely on a medieval European setting and QG2 opted for an exotic Arabian tableau, QG3 offers perhaps the most exotic and intriguing backdrop in the Quest for Glory series to date. QG3 takes place on the sprawling continent of Fricana, a land patterned heavily after the real-world African continent. In this land, a humid tropical jungle skirts a large, sweltering savanna of grasslands. In the midst of the jungle are the crumbling ruins of a lost city, filled with dark, foreboding secrets of its own. The city of Tarna itself is a cosmopolitan center of activity, where a variety of fantasy and real-world cultures collide. Honor-bound Liontaurs mingle in the streets with Arabian shop keepers, while Simbani warriors, strongly patterned after traditional African Zulu, observe with watchful eyes. The world of QG3 is a rich and alluring one; a world where Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan would feel right at home. Indeed, QG3's exotic treatment of different cultures proves itself to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game. Roleplaying adventures have traditionally been centered around medieval European culture, using the same western batch of monsters (dragons and Ogres), backdrops (castles and hamlets) and conflicts (dwarves vs. elves, orcs vs. everyone). I especially enjoyed QG3's treatment of African culture, complete with a list of verbal greetings and other terms taken from actual Swahili. Non-European cultures such as the African tribal empires, Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates have been traditionally underrepresented in fantasy RPG's; this reviewer would like to encourage game developers to explore the rich, relatively untapped material for adventure gaming in these and other cultures. With QG3 proving that a RPG based upon a non-European gaming world can be just as enjoyable and entertaining as one that is, one can hope that this tradition continMoving the character about this rich gameworld involves Sierra's tried and true point and click interface which displays all of the commands the player can use in the game. These controls can be perused by toggling through them with the right mouse button or accessing the pop-up control panel at the top of the game screen. Icons for looking, grabbing, checking inventory and accessing disk functions are all present. Three aspects of the interface have been modified considerably in QG3. First, the speech icon has been given additional flexibility. Conversation with non-player characters in earlier Sierra titles (such as King's Quest V) were frustratingly one sided often little more than dead-end dialogues where the only control the player had over what was being said was how fast it could be read off the screen. Clicking the \"talk\" icon on a character in the game now brings up a menu of topics. Speaking about some topics may bring up other topics of discussion, allowing the player to modify the course of discussion to some degree. While a far cry from a full-blown text parser, OG3's expanded dialogue is definitely a step in the right direction. The second modification is the special action bar, which contains all of the specialized commands particular to the Quest for Glory series. This menu allows the player to access special character actions, such as sleeping, character information, fleeing combat and sneaking up on an opponent. Finally, QG3 offers a specialized menu of combat actions. Closer in appearance to an embossed tablet than a menu, it is divided into three areas corresponding to three types of combat options. Tailored individually for the Fighter, Thief and Magicuser classes, these combat menus make navigating the pseudo-arcade combat sequences an exercise in point and click simplicity. QG3's sumptuous handpainted graphics make the exotic backdrop of Tarna spring to life. Most of the artJanuary 1993 Page 27 "


"Review LON@l.12 HON 2 : 17 PORT work excels at presenting the world of QG3 in a grand scale, with towering pyramids, sphinx-like statues and thick green jungles all rendered in 256-color VGA. Adding to the visual display, QG3 sports a sound track with a broad scope of styles, ranging from driving passages filled with jungle drums to sprightly Persian bazaar music, reminiscent of snake charmers and spice sellers. Blemishes on the Landscape As polished a product as QG3 is, a few blemishes need to be mentioned. Traveling across the open savanna seems to be more difficult than it should be, with monsters attacking the player's character from all quarters. True, the character can opt to flee, and QG3 offers three levels of playing difficulty to dial down the difficulty of the arcade sequences, but regardless of the difficulty level, combat seems to occur more often than necessary. I also encountered a few minor bugs regarding conversation with some NPC's. During a nighttime encounter with Arnie Saknoosen -a gregarious, diamond-hunting aardvark -the game ghosted out all of the action icons, preventing me from leaving the area. Visions on the Horizon Minor program foibles aside, QG3 is yet another excellent product from the creative characters at Sierra. With every new release in the Quest for Glory series, designers Lori and Corey Cole have been steadily improving the line, offering gamers an exciting mixture of hard-core fantasy role-playing and traditional graphic adventure games. QG3 is far and away the most satisfying and entertaining game yet in the series. With such a commendable tradition, we can hardly contain our expectations for Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness. It will be tough to surpass the expectations generated from the excellence already found in Quest for Glory III: Wages of War.

"Scorpion's View New World's Clouds of Xeen as told by Scorpia Scorpia is an experienced and respected adventure game expert. CGW is pleased to provide this forum for her distinctive and often controversial perspective. T ourth in the Might & Magic seKries, Clouds of Xeen bears a strong resemblance to its predecessor, Isles of Terra. Character creation, interface and game play are pretty much the same as in the previous M&M; if you played Terra, you'll have no trouble at all jumping into Clouds, with perhaps a quick glance through the manual as a refresher. However, Xeen is a stand-alone (of sorts; more on that later). If you've been hanging on to saves from Terra in the hopes of transferring your characters over, you're out of luck. A new party will have to be made for this one or you can use the pre-created group that comes with the game. All the usual classes are available: Knight, Paladin, Archer, Sorcerer, Druid, Cleric, Ninja, Robber and Ranger. Six characters is the maximum, though, so you will have to choose carefully which professions you want in the party. Dice are rolled for all the starting stats and you can swap values between them if you have good rolls, but they are not quite allocated where you need them in order to create a particular class. This is a very nice feature and helps to cut down on creation time. Characters you create come with no equipment at all, but the pre-created group is outfitted to a limited extent. You can save some money by using the traditional canard of stripping the original group of all their items and giving them to your own people. That will require a couple of trips into and out of the inn, since exchanging items is no longer possible once you've \"checked in.\" No doubt this was done to get around the problem of the previous game, where any object could be duplicated endlessly with a little judicious trading around. That doesn't work any more, so remember to do all your trading outside the inns. A New \"Day\" In Magic Many of the old familiar spells from Terra are here, along with some new ones. Particularly welcome are the Day of Sorcery for mage types and the Day of Protection for cleric types. These are packages that cast multiple spells at once. No longer is it necessary to cast individual Heroism, Holy Bonus spells or a mass of several Elemental protection spells. One dose of Day of Protection from a clerical character provides light, protection from all elements, and group Holy Bonus and Heroism, simultaneously. In the same fashion, Day Of Sorcery casts Wizard Eye, Power Shield (for the entire party), Levitate and Clairvoyance, all at once. Clairvoyance is a new spell, handy for little tips when deciding whether or not to attempt opening a chest or similar object. Two heads on the display will nod \"yes\" or \"no,\" depending on the situation. Both say yes when a chest is safe and has goodies inside. One says yes and the other no when the chest is trapped but contains treasure, and when both say no, it's best to leave the item alone. Of course, you can still purchase the individual spells of Light, Heroism, Page 30 Computer Gaming World "


"Scorpion's View Wizard Eye, etc., so you can tailor your spellcasting to the exact situation. As you might expect, those Day packages require a lot of spellpoints (75 for Protection, 40 for Sorcery), and it would be silly to use up that many points when all you need is light or Wizard Eye. However, for those occasions when you need it all, you can have it all without a lot of fuss. Another new feature that is sure to bring cheers is the appearance of the auto-note utility. The game automatically records for you all the important information and clues that you come across during play. This includes the locations of all those neat little wells/fountains that give temporary boosts to stats, and shrines that provide daily protection against elemental powers, as well as the passwords, obscure hints, and whatnot that turn up as you ramble around the world. RE So you don't need to make any notes of your own, at least as far as those items are concerned. With the quests, it's a little different. The game does keep track of quests for you, what you have to find (or do) and where the person is who sent you out. However, the quest-tracking utility often does not record the place where you're supposed to go to complete the errand. This can be a problem if you take on several quests at once, which is an easy thing to do. People who want some mission accomplished are all over the place and there seems to be no limit to the number of errands you can accept. The quest notes faithfully record all of them, but when you look at those notes, they might just say \"Find the lost Book Of Foobar and return it to Fred at A1, X3, Y9\" with no mention of where Fred told you to look for it. Therefore, you'll have to do some note-taking of your own for the quests, at least as far as errand locations are concerned. Quests On \"Spec\" Quest items are clearly marked as such when you find them, and they go into a special inventory where you can see them, but can't touch them. There is no worry that you might inadvertantly drop, sell, or use up a special object. Once you find such an item, it's safe until you return it to the proper person. There are, however, a couple of prob their contents tend towards the lower lems with the quests. One is the fact end of the potency scale. Don't expect that you can find a quest item, or com your party to be decked out with obsidplete a quest errand, without having ian weapons and armor by the end of been sent out to do the task. For in the game; you'll be lucky to have so stance, in Castle Basenji, I came across much as an obsidian cape (the only a Scroll of Insight, which was clearly a such item I ever found).

This is all to the good, since it Similarly, the group cleared an area makes the better stuff you do find all that more valuable to you, and keeps of monsters, and only much later came the party from becoming too powerful across the person who had wanted those monsters cleaned out. In all these too quickly. situations, you do get the rewards for Using the town teleporters to get the item or actions performed, even around is much more sensible now. In though you hadn't been asked to per the previous game, you had to find out form the quest, so \"jumping the gun\" the \"codewordÂ» for each town, and cerdoesn't cheat you out of anything. Still, tain other areas, before you could 'port it is unsettling, and sometimes annoy to them. That's been done away with, ing, to find yourself on these \"unknown and you only need to type in the name quests.\" It would have been far better if of where you want to go to arrive there. The party can travel to any named dungeon, castle, or town on the map that comes with the game. Some places, while shown on the map, have no names, so you'll still have to trek there on foot, but you can usually 'port to some other location nearby to cut down on travel time. Perhaps the most interesting addition to Xeen is the choice of \"Adventurer\" or \"Warrior\" mode. Adventurer mode is described in the manual as being \"less combat-intenAnker sive.\" What that means is, the requisite items did not appear in the monsters are a bit easier to kill and you game until after the party had been don't have to fight quite so many of commissioned to find them. them in most areas.

"Review Alens, Hippies And Ghouls Oh. Mu! Konami/Gremlin's Plan 9 From Outer Space by Charles Ardai AND RESURSES THE VERDE still find much to enjoy in the game but they probably won't \"get\" it any more than they get\" the movie. FROM OUTER SPACE Bus A3/A4 OLLA Listas VARPIE LTLE TALBOT KONAMI GREMLIN TITLE: Plan 9 From Outer Space SYSTEM: Amiga, MS-DOS PRICE: $39.95 GRAPHICS: VGA 256-Color SOUND: Ad Lib/Soundblaster, Roland PROTECTION; Documentation Look Up DEVELOPER: Gremlin GraphicsSoftware PUBLISHER: Konami Buffalo Grove, IL rt is in the nature of shoddy films, if they are sufficiently shoddy, to acquire the reputation of being \"so bad, they're good.\" Enjoying these films is not a matter of enjoying their intrinsic merit; nor even of affectionately indulging in a caliber of entertainment which, however obvious its flaws may be today, once passed muster with less sophisticated audiences. Rather, it is a matter of smirking at the shoddiness, of sharing a knowing wink and nudge with one's fellow smirkers in a peculiarly contemporary ritual of condescension. To say that a movie is a \"cult classicÂ» often means that, while it offers so little to enjoy that it invites mockery, one can, if one is so inclined, at least enjoy the mockery. So it is that, 34 years after its release, director Ed Wood, Jr.'s shoestring genre stinker, Plan 9 From Outer Space, has won what passes for acclaim (in the same circles that watch such gems as Santa Claus Conquers The Martians and Rockership X-M and howl till tears stream down their faces at how rotten they are) as \"The Worst Film of All Time.\" That Plan 9 is the worst film ever made is open to debate, but not much. It is a perfect example of what will happen if an atrocious script, a tenth-rate director, wooden performers, and a virtually nonexistent budget all get assembled for a single project. Add a star, Bela Lugosi, who dies after completing only a few minutes worth of footage and a prop crew that thinks cardboard, tarpaulins, and pie-plate flying saucers can get viewers to suspend disbelief and you've got a major flop in the making. As Leonard Maltin accurately put it, Plan 9 is \"mesmerizing in its awfulness.\" However, even if Plan 9 is the worst film ever made, it is not clear that it is the \"Worst Film of All Time,\" with all that those capital letters imply. Is it, for instance, so bad that it is funny? Some people think so, but I am not one of them. To me it just seems pitiful and headache-inducing. How one responds to Konami/Gremlin's new computer game based on the film depends largely on how one responds to the movie. People who find the movie a laugh riot will probably find the game equally engaging. People who stare in bewilderment at the film's popularity will Game Plan The game is adaptation, homage, and spoof all rolled into one. The player is a private eye hired by the head of Cheapflik Studios to recover six reels of the movie \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" which have been hidden around the world after having been stolen by Bela Lugosi's double. (Tom Mason, the poor chap who was saddled with the thankless task of finishing Lugosi's scenes after the star died, played all of his scenes with a cape over his face.) The player also has to screen the film, piece by piece, in Cheapflik's editing room to make sure that the rascally thief hasn't harmed it in any way. (The joke, of course, being that it is impossible to imagine the film getting worse as a result of being re-edited. Still, one wants to retain its auteur's original \"vision.\" Ho ho ho.) Actors from the film make cameo appearances throughout the game: Vampira appears as a clerk in a shopping mall, Lugosi's corpse turns up in a crypt, and most of the living male characters bear a suspicious resemblance to huge, pug-ugly Tor Johnson. The game's plot also has some overlap with the movie's, since the theft of the film is in some way connected with the appearance on Earth of aliens who can only be appeased by gaining ownership of the sole remaining print of the movie. None of this makes much sense; nor, one suspects, is supposed to. The storyline is a glorious mess, reveling in its own incoherence. Things happen, and as a result, other things happen and a lot of jokes are made along the way. Then, the game is over. Playing Plan 9 is a dizzying experience, though not, for the most part, an unpleasant one. The game's worldwide conspiracy of aliens will remind some players of Lucasfilm's Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders, another would-be zany adventure. The biggest difference is that this game has an excuse for being a mess also, that Plan 9 is funnier and has more of an edge to its humor. (For instance, there's the bit with Lugosi's corpse, which will make some players cringe. The game also skates on thin ice with references to Ed Wood's transvestitism and sequences in which the player tangles with hippies in Australia and Fidel Castro in Cuba.) Plan 9 is a genuinely, intentionally funny piece of work, which puts it several notches above the movie (in my opinion). Sardonic descriptions and running gags abound and, while the atmosphere is sometimes sordid (Â«This is a small... office that smells a bit like somebody's dog got sick in it\"), the game is thoroughly enjoyable. Grave Reservations Where Plan 9 falls short is in its implementation. To begin with, while it uses a fairly standard point-and-click interface, it looks like it was made on the cheap. The most noticeable shortcoming is that only a small portion of the screen is used for the graphic window that shows what is going on. The rest of the screen is taken up with an ugly blue background, a hard-to-read inventory list, a gravestone displaying possible actions (one has 10 to choose from), and a small text area. The graphics are acceptable, but never more than that, and the soundtrack that goes with them is grating. Page 36 Computer Gaming World "

"Review The writing is at a high level, full of acid wit and self-referential fun, but it could have used a once-over by a good proofreader to catch missing words and punctuation. Along similar lines, place names You must seek out the aliens. esport ber of items that can be taken, but only a few that are actually useful. One is never sure what to take away from a scene; and since one cannot take everything, one is likely to take the wrong things and be forced to replay large sections of the game to correct such mistakes. Finally, there are times when it is extremely inconvenient to return to an object's orginal location to retrieve it. For instance, if one makes it to Cuba but accidentally drops the Spanish dictionary, one cannot just pick it up; one would have to go back to the studio's storeroom in the U.S. to get it again. Granted, any approach to handling inventories has its tradeoffs. Giving the player an unlimited inventory would make the game easier, and therefore shorter. It would also make the on-screen inventory isn't nearly as shoddy, does this make the game a failure?) Are the game's flaws calculated or accidental? Which would be funnier? Similarly, is there some sort of hyperobscure in-joke buried in the fact that the game's instruction manual looks amateurish and is riddled with typos, even to the point of transposing the last two digits of the publisher's hint line? (\"-HINT\" does not come out to \"-4486.\" After all, 'N' tends to precede 'T' in the alphabet.) Is this mock sloppiness or the real thing? If it's a joke, I'll say without embarrassment that I don't get it. One thing that can be said in defense of Plan 9 From Outer Space is that while Ed Wood was apparently a nut, he seems at least to have been a sincere, dedicated and original nut. As Bill Warren writes in Keep Watching the Skies!, his encyclopedic analysis of B-pictures, Â«[Wood] lies somewhere in the twilight zone between idiocy and inspiration, between genius and hopelessness ... Plan 9 From Outer Space ... is testimony to Wood's guilelessness he can't even make a cheap bad movie right, but he makes it his own way.\" +385Sport hub-ephone...jelydenetlenek POR EUROTUS Passport have been poorly thought out: it is bad, especially in a game with no directional commands or mapping, for there to be two different locations, side by side, called \"the street.\" (It is also confusing that inside an airport one of the movement choices is to the airport.\" by which is meant \"the runway.\") One wishes that the game were better designed in other respects as well. For example, there is no consistency in how it responds when the player does something wrong-sometimes a response appears in the text area, sometimes nothing happens at all, and sometimes a new window appears in the middle of the screen saying, \"Nope, sorry, dead end that.\" The game is not very successful at letting players know when they have done something right, either. When one finds Bela Lugosi's house, one can enter if one is carrying a certain key, but one is never told that this key is the reason one has been allowed in. Most games would contain a sequence in which the player has to use the key on the front door in order to get in, rather than simply be carrying it. This type of problem, which might so easily have been corrected, crops up over and over again in the game. Another problem concerns the way the game handles the player's inventory. That one is allowed to carry no more than eight or nine items at a time is bad enough I much prefer unlimited inventories, even if they aren't realistic. (What else in this game is realistic, after all?) Worse by far, however, is that any items one drops are instantly snapped up by \"a little creature\" and returned to the place where they were first located. The problem is threefold. First, it is not immediately obvious that the little creature is returning the dropped objects to their starting points (as opposed to, say, swallowing them), so one goes through the first half of the game terrified to drop anything for fear that dropped items will be irretrievable. Second, the game contains a large numPode more cumbersome to use, since one might have to cycle through a list of 30 or 40 items. On the other hand, eliminating all non-essential items from the game would take away some of the game's flavor, while leaving them in but making them non-acquirable would frustrate the gamer in an entirely different way. No system is perfect. Nevertheless, I doubt that the system the designers chose for Plan 9 was the best they could have come up with. Or, if it was, they might at least have warned players about its idiosyncrasies. Other Idiosyncrasies Plan 9 has other peculiarities as well which, because they mirror flaws in the movie, may have been put into the game intentionally. In the movie, for instance, the background occasionally changes from day to night and back again within a single scene. In the game, a taxi driver appears to be bald and bearded when one looks at him from outside the cab, yet grey-haired and clean-shaven from inside. Also, while the movie studio is called Â«Cheapflik Studios\" repeatedly, the front door says, Â«DCA Films.\" These \"continuity errors\" may be deliberate, but the fact that it is ambiguous makes it difficult to decide whether to laugh at them or with them. More generally, it is unclear how one is supposed to take the game. Is it supposed to be as shoddy as the movie? (Since it The game, with its smirking digs at this rather pathetic relic of a movie, is funny: but it sometimes has the tone of a schoolyard bully taking cheap shots at a defenseless victim. If a person is going to mock something for being lousy, that person had better be pretty sure that the same charge can't be applied to their work. Since, despite its good qualities, there are things about Plan 9 that are pretty lousy, some of its digs at the film that inspired it do nothing so much as highlight its own weaknesses. Yes, that's part of the joke and yes, it's worth a chuckle, but there is a level of irony underneath the laughter. The movie, crappy as it was, had elements of honesty, innocence and integrity that the game a licensed product, parasitic on an original work, full of self-aware sarcasm cannot approach. In this respect, the game attains a degree of cheapness that even the movie didn't reach, which is quite an accomplishment. Maybe 30 years from now people will sit around and laugh at it. It would be fitting and might even be intended. CGW Page 38 Computer Gaming World "

"All Terrain Software The Third Part in a Series on Course Design by Mark Alan Willett let those electronic buildizers. ready, because this issue installment looks at the construcidat of terrain features from tee to green for the Jack Nicklaus Golf and Com a Desigte (UNSE) software. Of course, once a gamer gets ready to do some heavy duty construction, there is always a need for on-the-job safety. JNSE construction is no exception, so I always keep two copies of the course I'm working on, one of them as a backup. When I start each work session, I decide if I want to keep what I did from the session before or copy in the backup. It's a good practice to develop. Fairways: The Straight & Narrow? Ever wonder how the designer decides where and when to narrow the fairway? Many fairways on new courses seem so often scalloped that it is not apparent what the logic is behind the design. In fact, there are many reasons for the scalloping that should be known to the designer of home computer courses: First, stands of trees or other objects which intrude on the course are usually based in rough or heavy rough. Crossing Your Tees With rare exception, tees need to be flat horizontally. Since JNSE takes pitch, left or right, into account on its shots, a tee which slopes across its width will affect play. In JNSE, a ball which is beneath the golfer will tend to push to the right, and a ball which is above the golfer's feet will tend to pull left. So, flatness at the tee is critical and fair. After that, tees can have a downhill slope for visibility or an uphill slope that matches an uphill tee shot, but that's a matter of designer preference. In terms of appearance, designers may wish to outline their tees with a row of fairway and maybe consider a row of rough (particularly if a tee is in heavy rough terrain). This simply assists the appearance of the neatly-manicured tee which is found at most courses. Second, hills at the side of the fairway which may be so steep as to be considered impediments to a shot may be covered in rough. The point here is to help distinguish the good shot for the golfer. Third, the narrowing or widening of the fairway can add simple visual variety to the hole and to shot-making. Finally, there is the important idea of using typical shot-length to determine the narrows on the hole. Page 40 Computer Gaming World "

Sometimes JNSE bunkers seem to have spikes of Greens That Create Envy Since the standard unit of course construction in JNSE is an 8' x 8' cell, it is very difficult to create subtle and elaborate elevation changes on the green. Nevertheless, here are a few quick tips which should help: Think of the green as being laid in with two to four planes of height. Keep variations within those planes at one to two units of elevation. Raise the outside edge of the green at least LAKE 1-unit to help prevent the ball from rolling off. To stop the green from having visual spikes (like the traps), make terrain immediately adjacent to the green at the same height or higher than the outside edge of the green.

It's just that I told the boss that I needed a Super Whizzo Everything Sound Card and now I've heard just about every game I can find that supports it. Frankly, they're all pretty disappointing and now I feel kinda depressed about our project. I mean, I just don't see how we can come up with a great game-enhancing musical score for The Scratch And Sniff Kill The Sewer Rat Arcade Game if those seasoned experts that did TSGSWAWSNBMBGWBTPWLFAD couldn't come up with music that I didn't want to turn off! It just looks hopeless.\" Although the preceding conversation is about fictitious characters and, hopefully, fictitious products, it does sound like conversations I have witnessed between real computer game developers. The real issue here is music. This article will suggest some philosophy and background concerning the problem of music in computer games. he Scene: Two computer game developers chatting over the industry standard brain food ... pizza. \"Hey Tom, have you heard the music in The Super Great Space War Adventure Where Some Nerd Battles Medieval Bad Guys With Brain Teasing Puzzles While Looking For A Date?\" \"No, Harry you know I always turn the volume down when I hear music in computer games.\" \"Oh I know, Tom. Believe me I do the very same thing. I just heard that the music was really good. I had the game and had just bought a Super Whizzo Everything Sound Card. So, I wanted to hear how it sounds. Well, at least I did at first. Then, it all started to sort of drive me crazy. I couldn't concentrate on the game, so I just sorta turned it down until it didn't bother me anymore.\" \"Harry, why don't you just say what you really mean. You turned the sound down until it was all the way off!\" during the time frame of the story? When viewing a space battle in Star Wars, does it ever occur to anyone that sound can't travel in space? And that Native American music in the old westerns, does anyone ever think about what great violinists those Native Americans would have had to have been to generate those sounds? The answer to nearly all of these questions is probably \"No!\" In order to make computer game soundtracks that really touch the gamer's emotional center, computer game composers simply must take advantage of this cultural pre-conditioning. They shouldn't play disco during the death scene and shouldn't launch space ships to reggae. Another problem is what I call the tune mentality. Most game developers think of music in simple, convenient, compact units that they call songs or tunes. They think of each situation as needing a simple, unique and, often, all-too-short tune. This leads to a lack of continuity throughout the game. It seems that each tune stands alone and has no reference to anything else in the game. This also leads to music being thought of as an \"easter egg\" industry slang for an amusing but non-essential piece of fluff that adds delight to a game but could just as easily be left out. The tune mentality also leads to an expectation that a piece of game music must be able to stand on its own and still be entertaining. Frankly, if anyone listens to a movie Soundtrack album, they tend to hear the music edited to sound like individual tunes, but in the actual movie there are times when the music would seem downright boring if there wasn't plenty of action Let's Go Hollywood! Currently, there is a lot of talk about whether computer games should \"Go Hollywood,\" Some think this would be a giant step backward. Others say, \"Why not? Their stuff sounds better than ours.\" I say that following the Hollywood model would do a little of both. First of all, Hollywood has created a sense of cultural expectation. It is pretty tough to compose music that doesn't borrow from our collective past. When one watches Ben Hur and sees the chariot race, does it ever occur to anyone that most of the instruments in the score didn't exist Page 44 Computer Gaming World "

"Theme Article Computer game developers should learn these same lessons. Score a game, don't tune it. Use music that plays off cultural conditioning. Don't be afraid to make the music very simple and thin in parts and heavy and thick in others. If it works well in the game, it will seem perfectly natural for a 9 or 18 voice sound card to be using only one or two of its voices at a time. The generally excepted rule (which means it's okay to break it is that the density of the activity in the scene and that of the music should be opposite. \"Did he say opposite!?\" Yes, I did. That's one big reason that people turn the music off. When the movie or game demands most of one's concentration, busy music is a distraction an irritation. Movie directors will say, \"This is an important scene in the movie, but it is also kinda' dull and slow, can you add some music that is interesting?\" or they will say, \"There is a lot for the audience to follow during this chase scene, so make the music exciting but keep it out of the way.\" CREATIVE LABS, INC SOUND BLASTEREO taking place on-screen which that boring music just happens to fit perfectly. Anyone who ever views a traditional (1920-1970) stage musical has probably noticed how often musical themes come back over and over again (reprise). This is partly because of the familiarity syndrome. The first time a person hears a melody, they are almost certain not to like it as much as they will after they've heard it a few more times. Part of this effect is due to the fact that people like to sort of hum a tune in their head as they are listening to it. Naturally, they can't do this until they have heard the tune enough to remember what comes next. By playing all of the basic musical themes in the opening music (overture) and touching on them a few more times before the point in the show where the song is actually sung, they are setting up the audience to be more familiar with the tune when it is finally presented to them with full force. In computer games, both the familiarity syndrome and the tune mentality must be taken into consideration. Can the music be planned as an integrated part of the whole (i.e. with a beginning and, maybe, several alternate endings)? Can the music be hinted at several times before the big scene happens? Developers must start thinking of how the music will fit in all through the game and whether the music and the game are stepping on each other at points. The music must not be listened to as a tune but as another shadow or flash of color that adds that little bit of mood that a silent game lacks. Game developers ask for tunes. Hollywood directors ask for scores. A score is, literally, the sheets of music that the conductor uses. These pages have every note of every instrument. Scoring a movie means creating a full package of music that encompasses every moment where music is appropriate from the beginning to the end of the movie. This is very important to have. Hollywood learned their lesson about scoring a movie versus just playing a few songs at key places. For awhile during the 70s, it looked like the movie score composers would soon be out of work. It was discovered that a popular tune in a movie would boost sales of the movie as well as the record. For awhile, they went crazy. Then they realized that they had drained the emotion out of their movies just like pulling the drain plug from a bathtub. That is, it left them feeling cold and uncomfortable (and soapy). Today, the most popular Hollywood formula is to put pop tunes wherever possible and to fill in the rest with a good old fashioned movie score. Disco Duck just doesn't cut it in a suspenseful courtroom scene or during an encounter with aliens. it more or less like an OPL-2. Roland's MT-32 Synthesizer Module and LAPC-1 Synth Card essentially improve the quality of the synthesizer, resulting in a sound that is roughly twice as good but still uses the same idea. In all these cards, sounds are being built from scratch by generating simple waveforms and modulating them with other simple waveforms. Using this method to try to get the score to sound like it is being played by real instruments is not only difficult, but it is essentially a hit-ormiss operation. Many sound cards now have PCM sampling at various resolutions in stereo or just mono. This means that they come with the ability to record real sounds as numbers that are stored on a harddisk or floppy disk and can then be converted back to real sounds at a later time. This is the same technology that makes music CDs work, only at a much more economical level. Though this technology has been around, at least since the first Sound Blaster, it is not used very much. The reason, as is almost always true in computer games, is space. The OPL-2 and OPL-3 mentioned above create the sounds themselves. Obviously, they only need to be told what notes to hit and when to hit them, using a particular instrumental sound. This data takes very little space on either disks or in memory, since a typical MIDI file is between 5K and 50K. MIDI files or something similar are used to contain the tunes or instructions to tell the OPL-2 or OPL-3 or LAPC1 which notes to play and when. This takes an acceptable amount of disk and memory space for most game developers. PCM, that is Pulse Code Modulation, is very different. PCM files, called VOC files by Creative Labs and WAV files by Microsoft, are actual recordings of sounds and they are very, very big. The data required to play a hit tune on a standard CD player is about 10 MB per minute, 200 times the size of a large MIDI file! In fact, the original Wing Commander, still one of the largest games around in terms of disk space usage, is about the same size as just one minute of CD quality music. Using the upper limits of the Sound Blaster and cutting the 16-bit down to 8-bit, 44 Khz down to 22 Khz, and stereo down to mono, that same one minute of music is still 1.25 MB or a whopping 25 times the size of a large MIDI file. This all means that PCM isn't being used much because it just takes too much space. So much for VOC or WAV file music.

Although I want to stress that the quality of the music is crucial, the quality of the sound hardware through which the music is played is also very important. Most gamers today listen to their games with the benefit of a sound card based on Yamaha's OPL-2 or OPL-3 FM synthesizer chips. Adliband Sound Blaster music cards use these chips.

"Foreign Correspondence First Samurai superb control system, and amongst the best scrolling seen in any IBM game. It is, in essence, a horizontal and vertical scrolling arcade martial arts game. It's all been done before, but never to this standard. If you want a couple minutes of relaxation from Crusaders or Might and Magic IV, or you can't find the dog to kick, give this a look. We don't want to give CGW readers the feeling that we're slacking on our side of the white cliffs, however. Impressions continues to be a prolific UK publisher. Their latest offeringis Discovery, which is part-celebration of the finding of an obscure continent by some Columbus fella' and part strategy game. The player starts in 1480 and has to raise funds, buy, equip and crew a fleet and then sail off into the blue yonder. It feels very much like a development of their fairly successful Merchant Colony, and uses a similar system. Not bad, but I just can't see this New World thing taking off <grin>. Hope it does better for them than the movie on the same theme did for Paramount. Mirage Software of the UK is well into the development of a Lemmings beater in their forthcoming release The Humans. This is an arcade-style strategy game, where the player guides a tribe of cavemen through an evolutionary cycle to the present day and beyond. Think of a cross between Lemmings and a scrolling platform game and one has both a headache, and The Humans! Finally, snooker is an invention of a British Prime Minister, one Neville Chamberlain (peace in our time\", etc.), and has a large multimillion dollar, world-wide professional circuit. One of the best known players is a Londoner called Jimmy White, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind because of his speed of play. Now, Virgin has released Jimmy White's Snooker on the Amiga (several months ago) and on the MS-DOS machines. It is without doubt the best MS-DOS snooker game released, with superb floating camera views and a very versatile control system. The graphics are crisp, sound support is OK, and there are some hilarious touches not to be spoiled here!

Just make sure it's yours. n ambitious attempt at combining the isometric control scheme of Populous with a Tolkienesque tableau of warring humanoids, Realms offers a challenging twist on simulated world domination. With Realms, publisher Virgin Games and designer Graftgold are attempting to draw both strategy gamers and role-playing fans into a narrow niche of computer entertainment: fantasy wargaming. While SSI's Sword of Aragon and SSG's Warlords proved that fantasy wargames could be successful, Realms attempts to take this gaming genre to new heights with sharper graphics and an increased emphasis on resource and city management. According to the hackneyed storyline presented in the book and in the game's animated introduction, the player has been given a \"divine mandate\" to rule over the Realms gameworld by a powerful Nordic god. The player will soon discover that divine endorsements serve as poor armor indeed against the sharp weapons of an aggressive, warmongering enemy. In other words, nothing in Realms is a sure thing. Every kingdom in Realms goes to war at the drop of an iron helm so that borders and cities constantly change hands. As if keeping foes at pike's length wasn't enough, however, the player must also assume the role of a medieval city planner, making tough decisions about city and resource management.

Heimdall's universe consists of three progressively difficult worlds: Earth (the men's room), Utgard (land of the giants) and Asgard (gods' country). Within each world are a series of islands which are also arranged according to difficulty. The various locations appear to be uniquely decorated, but each contains a similar series of passages containing traps, treasures and grim-faced guardians.

"Game Hints random pool of points, and a random set of starting attributes plus a random number of points. You can \"re-rollÂ» in any of these methods as much as you want, and you can even switch from one method to the other. Try all three and see which one works best for you. Typical for a single-character game, your alter ego is both a fighter and a mage. This means that almost all your stats will be important. The one I found least useful was Accuracy, which governs missile weapons. Since the critters in this game move around (some of them rather quickly!), and you have to be in a direct line with them to shoot with a bow (or throw a knife), I found missiles to be limiting weapons. They were only good against the creepers, the slowest-moving monsters in the game. Your other stats, however, are really important, especially Strength. You can never be strong enough in this game. Each point of Strength allows you to carry 5 kilos (all weight is measured in kilos) of stuff. I recommend a starting Strength of at least 18, and higher if you can manage it (20 is the max for any starting attribute). As you begin to accumulate items, especially armor, you will appreciate the need for lots of muscles. Don't skimp on Agility, either. You want to be able to move fast, and that means a high score here, at least 15. Ditto for Endurance. In the latter stages of the game especially, fighting is going to be a fatiguing exercise, so prepare for it now. On the magic front, Talent and Power need good scores, too. Spellcasting is an important part of this game, and you'll want to (a) be able to memorize as many spells as you can, and (b) cast spells that are potent or long-lasting. So, take your time in character creation to get the best numbers you can; it's worthwhile in the long run. Choosing your weapon and magical specialties finishes creation. I favored Hacking/Clubbing weapons because that skill gives you a nice, powerful axe with which to start the game, and Healing, because starting without armor was a little nerve-wracking. That doesn't mean you're stuck with just your specialties. The Summoning operates on the use it or lose it\" principle. As you cast spells, or fight with different weapons, your abilities with that class of weapon or spell increase. So, fight with different weapons, and cast spells from all the disciplines whenever you can. As you go through the game, you'll be finding all sorts of things: weapons, armor, magical runestones (one-shot spells), amulets and necklaces, etc. Lots of Neat Items. The trick is, most of these are going to wear out after a while. Weapons break, armor degrades, magical amulets get used up, and so on. Very little is permanent in The Summoning. So, at the start, your main consideration is going to be accumulating a small armory. Pick up weapons whenever you can, and keep a couple near the top of your inventory at all times for easy access...it's in battle that they break, and you will want to get your hands on a replacement quickly. Remember also that you can fight two-handed, so two one-hand weapons are usually better than one two-hand weapon. Armor is heavy (some of it very heavy indeed). So, until you find at least one Bag of Lightness, you're better off not lugging spare armor around. When you come across new armor, just swap your old set for the new one (the old one is likely to be in bad shape by that time anyway). Your Foozle, Should You Decide To Off Him Okay, so your job is to make it through the labyrinth and do something about the evil Shadow Weaver, who, in the time-honored fashion of all Foozles, is out to conquer the world. How to foil those plans is what you learn as you go through the underground, since you're tossed into the area without much preparation. You'll certainly be doing a lot of trekking (you may end up feeling like the pink funny bunny, just going, and going, and going, and...). After the three beginner levels, there are the five broken seal levels, followed by the three elemental barrier levels, followed by the domains of the five knights, and then the five end levels, until you get to Weaver's citadel (four levels, plus basement). I almost hesitate to mention a few underground levels here and there (heh). Like I said, it's a big game. There's more than just fighting here, too. You'll come across a fair number of NPCs. Many are helpful. They'll give you information or teach you spells, so talk to everyone who isn't immediately hostile. It is not necessary to kill everyone you meet (so curb your bloodthirsty instincts!). There are also, of course, puzzles. Lots of puzzles. The majority of them involve doing tricky things with floor plates and/or teleporters, and sometimes levers. This is where that neat-o automap is very helpful. It's almost as good as the one in Ultima Underworld, lacking only a feature for writing notes on it. On the other hand, it has the virtue (ahem) of being printable, and some important features are put on the map for you: locations of teleporters, pits, rune floors, portals (doors to another section of the game) and stairs. This map is your most important tool in figuring out puzzles, because it always represents the current state of the level. As I said earlier, many puzzles revolve around floor plates. Suppose you stand on one. Did it do anything? Maybe a door out of vision range opened, or a teleporter appeared. How can you tell? Look at the map! (The on-screen map, of course). If you triggered something, it will show up. Keep in mind, though, that multiple plates may have to be weighed down before something is opened or turned on. Naturally, the map only shows those areas you've actually explored, so it's possible something happened in a blank area. If there appears to be no result from stepping on a plate, or pulling a lever, leave it and go wandering around some more. This will be critical when you are in the Blue Knight's domain and fiddling with the levers (many levers) in the Control Room. Your map will be particularly vital here. Also important are the bodies. Critters don't vanish when killed, they leave a corpse behind. These are wonderful for weighing down plates. Finally, a use for a dead monster! Pushing them around can be tricky though, so move carefully. You want to avoid walls, and especially corners; if a body ends up in a corner, it's almost impossible to get it out of there. Teleporters have their own little tricks. The most common is the double: one behind the other. The front teleporter is usually a 004 Page 62 Computer Gaming World "

"Game Hints knockback, sending you back a few steps when you enter it. The rear teleporter usually goes to a plate somewhere that needs to be weighed down. That means throwing items over the first one to reach the second Weight considerations are the major factors in determining which items to throw. Different floor plates have different thresholds. For some, almost anything will do. For others, you need really heavy weight. Any item you can hold in your hand can be thrown. When faced with a double, save the game, then start tossing objects, checking your map in-between to see if anything is happening. Remember to try every teleporter twice. Sometimes, on the second entry, they will send you to a different location. Let's Game At The Very Beginning The beginner levels are just that: a sort of training ground devised to give you a bit of challenge and allow you to become familiar with fighting and spellcasting. Puzzles are few and easily solved. Opponents are not too tough, so long as you don't get overconfident. Remember, unless you're boxed in, you can always run. The best technique overall is \"divide and conquer.Â» When faced with multiple opponents, try to lure them away one at a time. This generally works well, except with spiders. Spiders are very fast and can be deadly (poisonous, you know). Spiders show up in the broken seal levels. Expect to be poisoned regularly here. Until you learn the Cure Poison spell, you'll have to depend on Cure potions, and there aren't many of them. Sometimes, you may have to run around poisoned (it's slow poison, you don't drop dead right away), using healing spells to keep you alive. In Broken Seal 4, you will find some white pearls. PICK UP THESE PEARLS AND HOLD ON TO THEM, THEY ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!! Didn't mean to shout, but this is critical, and you'll understand why when you read about the Citadel further along. Occasionally, especially in the later levels, it may seem you have nowhere to go and a lot of empty space on the map. This is when you try the three teleport runes of Raido, Thurisaz and Gebo. Some floor spots are inscribed with these runes symbols. Invoking the companion rune will send you to the spot immediately (be prepared for a \"welcoming committee\"). If there is no such rune symbol in that section, nothing happens and the rune is not used up. Some of your most difficult opponents will be the knights. You have to kill four of them (Greenie is honorable), and of those, by far the toughest is the Black Knight. In our first encounter, two shots and it was time to restore the game. Ouch! Try to find the Invisibility spell before you take him on. Going toe-to-toe with this guy is simply suicide. He's also fast, so don't stay in one place for very long. Beyond the Knights are the end levels. Of these, End Level 3 (where Raven the Assassin hangs out and End Level 1 (the lava level where the fire giants live) are completely optional. You don't need to do these to finish the game. The fire giants do have some Neat Things in their treasure rooms, though, so you may want to pay them a visit they aren't friendly). End Level 5 is the most important. This area has a small castle in the center, surrounded by skulls that ask for donations. Each donation opens a door in the center of the castle, most leading to small rooms with a little treasure. It is not necessary to feed all these skulls. Only a couple of them are really important. As you make your way through the castle, be on the lookout for skull-requested items; these are the crucial ones. A word about the sewers: stay out of them! We all know what sewage is, and unless you enjoy walking up to your waist, your neck, or over your head in sludge (taking damage, too!), there's no point in going through them. Entering Shadow Weaver's citadel by the front door is really the better way. The Citadel is four levels high and you-know-who lives on the top level. To get there, you must explore the first three, picking up black and white pearls, until you have five black and five white. It is here that the designers really slipped up. Until now, whenever you needed a door key or a special item, it was found either on that level or somewhere nearby. Amazingly, while you need ten pearls, only nine are in the Citadel. The tenth white pearl is... way, way back in Broken Seal 4. How this got by two sets of playtesters is unimaginable, but there it is. Hence my big notice earlier to grab the pearls. Event Horizon (the people who did this game) are working on a fix so that all the pearls will be in the Citadel, but just in case, grab those pearls in Broken Seal 4. On level 4, your best bet is to go up invisible and kill everything in sight before going through the skull teleporters. You must go through all of them to reach Shadow Weaver (a token entry, you might call it, hehe). Shadow Weaver is not immediately hostile, so take time out for a chat... it may clear up a few things. And then it's time forThe Summoning. Did you think that referred to your call to glory? Hah! Nothing so mundane. It's something quite different, and we'll hope the right choice is made at this dramatic moment. It isn't quite over yet, though. There's still a little something you have to do and you may find the actual end of this game...interesting. Short, but in one way, very sweet. Get there and decide for yourself. Whew! Well, that's it for now.

"Review RUNWAY TYCOON OR AIR DISASTER Impressions\" AIR BUCKS AIR BUCKS $49.95 BUILD YOUR OWN AIRLINE NAME: Air Bucks SYSTEM: IBM # PLAYERS: 0-4 PRICE: PROTECTION: None SOUND CARD. Adlib GRAPHICS: EGA DESIGNER: Edward Grabowski PUBLISHER: Impressions Farmington, CT Impressions by M. Evan Brooks ir Bucks was the subject of a \"sneak preview\" in CGW #98. Alan Emrich was impressed with what he christened Â«Railroad Tycoon with Wings.\" Other magazines have rated the simulation highly, so I was looking forward to an entertaining and educational experience. Were expectations fulfilled? Was this a product that makes Railroad Tycoon \"hard drive-deletable?\" The quick answer, at least for this reviewer, is a resounding negative (even if it doesn't correspond with the, pardon the pun, impressions of my editors). The simulation of civilian airline growth from the post-World War II period to the mid-80s is a subject that is inherently fascinating. Impressions has done an excellent job of whetting one's appetite, but a less-than-satisfying job of satisfying such appetite. In-Flight Reading (Documentation) The documentation comes in two manuals: a main instruction manual and a technical support/tutorial book. A new version (1.01) is available to registered users and it includes a strategy guide. However, as of the date of this review (mid-October), neither was available. The manual was written by the British designers, thereby giving proof to the adage that we are \"one people separated by a common language.\" While all major aspects of the game are covered, deciphering what actually happens is an exercise in cryptology and one must often rely on actual playing experience. The actual instructions are only 15 pages, while the remaining Page 72 Computer Gaming World "


"Review half of the manual is an interesting, albeit brief, overview of the historical evolution of civilian airlines. Overall, the manual is a decent \"prop jobÂ» when a Mach-1 Concorde would have been more appreciated. VIEW ALL ROUTES INTERNATIONAL GT INT2. San Juan OMBS OFTSHMAV1921 Noise Abatement (Graphics and Sound) The sound and graphics are obviously from the minimalist school of game design. A melody provides background Muzak, while the graphics are limited to a colored world map during play. A black line between cities will illustrate routes and way points. A problem exists with Pacific routes in that the routes do not \"wrap-around.\" Thus, a San Francisco-Wake Island-Tokyo route is graphically and incorrectly) illustrated by the eastern route (San Francisco-cross country-cross Europe-Far East). All user input will be made through drop-down menus which consist of tabular entries a la Lotus. Each year begins with a banner newspaper headline (which gives appropriate flavor) and, occasionally, a new airplane will be announced with an attractive screen shot of it coming out of wraps. The remaining graphics consist of a banker (used for securing loans), an airport site (for securing landing rights) and four or five other colorful screens. However, 90% of the game will be played in the world-map views and the only thing appearing on this will be the current route selected plus a bank balance changing at the bottom of the screen. Initially, the game did have a plane traversing its routes. However, both Johnny Wilson and Alan Emrich suggested that it was \"too juvenile\" and it was deleted from the final product. Maybe so, but if there is a resemblance to Railroad Tycoon, it is in the strategic map there is nothing else to entertain the player while the program is running. A game like this shows why Sid Meier is such a creative designer. Gamers, like rats in a maze, like their \"cheese\" screens; here, internal satisfaction is the only \"rat pellet\" offered. Hangar Time (Game Mechanics) Game mechanics are selectable by keystroke or mouse. The mechanics themselves are easily understood; it is only experience that will show how cumbersome the play can become. With four competing airlines, a total of 400 airplanes can be flying. One should ensure that his fleet is at least the size of his closest competitor; remember, once a player's fleet exceeds the magic number, he is literally stealing airlift from his competitors. Of course, even 100 airplanes can become difficult to manage (for those who criticized Railroad Tycoon for its number limitation, this is a good answer). What is most critical is fare management. One must determine which air route and aircraft he needs to adjust (generally from the \"Planes Listing\") and then switch to the financial analysis to determine how profitable a route is. From there, it is back to the \"Planes ListingÂ» to alter the ticket prices. Luckily, game time is frozen whenever any pull-down menu is accessed. One must also be careful in switching a particular plane from one route to another; it is all too easy to switch the entire route. Also, a command for merging duplicate routes would have been appreciated. Plane Speaking (Game Play) Initially, one begins in Miami, Florida. I found an initial short route (e.g. Palm Beach or Orlando) to be necessary to obtain a positive cash flow. Quickly, one should obtain landing rights to New York City and then, the sky's the limit. As play progresses, landing rights take more and more time to obtain. So, it would seem logical to go after the large cities. Despite a 40 year passage of time, the sizes of the cities do not change, so one can quickly determine the long-haul routes. Due to aircraft range, trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific flights will have to use Wake Island and the Azores, respectively, so their acquisition should be emphasized. No more than two airlines can have landing rights in any city, so optimal planning is mandatory. Fortunately, one can actually acquire virtually every large city by 1950. Then, the remainder of the game consists of maximizing profits and routes. A sub-phase allows sale and acquisition of stock in the various companies, but the computer opponents are notoriously reluctant to issue shares in their companies. Follow their example; as Woodsy Owl the Investor says, \"Give a Hoot, Don't Dilute!\" Each year, an overall performance appraisal is issued in three areas: turnover (number of passengers), fleet size and number of routes. Victory goes to the company with the highest performance rating. Beginning with a DC-3, one can quickly upgrade to the DC-6 (with a corresponding range change from 1,000 to 3,000 miles). While this occurs within two years of the game start, the next major aircraft (Boeing 707) will not appear for a decade. (Actually, the Vickers Viscount appears soon after the DC-6, but its short range and relatively high cost do not make it attractive). By 1950, one should be turning over a tremendous profit. The air fleet should be completely upgraded to DC-6s, and everything appears optimal. Wrong! In 1951 and 1953, aircraft occupancy will drop to virtually nothing unless one increases worker's salaries. Access the \"Research\" option, and ensure that the flight crews are not growing surly. Even dropping the rate from New York to Tokyo to $30.00 will not increase passenger occupancy! Fortunately, increased salaries will soon have one's airliner back in the AB CARGO JOBS AVAILABLE More OK Site Volume Landing Rights Washington Detroit AB Pago Pago Paris AB Madrid Barcelona AB TGI black, although the user might well question the validity of the economic model.

"Strategy Soaring Profits Strategy for Impression's Air Bucks by Jennifer Schlickbernd t first, Air Bucks can be pretty overwhelming. One follows the tutorial, gets an airline started, and then, what next? It's easy to go bankrupt in this game, but with a little knowledge, it's also really easy to make lots and lots of money. For starters, set the computer players to the Hardest difficulty level. This will stop them from being too aggressive in the site acquisition race. Introduction To Airline Management Be aware of how the computer weighs the various elements of the simulation. The main element is the ticket pricing. Price the fares right and more than half the profit battle is over. Price them wrong and bankruptcy will be stepping on one's coattail. In order for ticket pricing to be effective, the pricing must reflect the demand for the plane's services and routes. So what factors are important? Here's a chart: Most Important Size of Sites Special Circumstances First Class Travel Plane Speed Wages Very Important Customer flow /seasonality Age of planes Competition Advertising Reliability Cargo Comfort Level Length of plane route The simulation interprets these factors to mean that the bigger cities will generate more demand and customers will gravitate toward faster planes, even if they aren't as comfortable (or are old or even have a grouchy staff). Seasonality means that certain places can be more popular at different times of the year. Exclusive or monopoly routes are more profitable. The computer players will generally avoid competitive routes, so competition is usually not a big problem in solitaire games. If an airline's staff feels as if they are not being paid on a scale commensurate with profits, the demand for the airline will go down, since the staff will be crankier and won't service people as well. The older the model of planes flown, the less passengers will want to ride on them, perceiving that they are out of date. Old planes make good cargo planes, but don't be afraid to sell them if costs get too high. First Class travel is special. Don't bother with it on any route other than a large city to large city (large-large) route, but on a large-large route, it is crucial. On a large-large route, one should make 30% of the space available for first class in order to guarantee a profit. (It is always wise to check the Service Income menu item to be sure). Cargo can only be picked up when it shows up in the Jobs Available report. If there isn't much cargo in the cities the plane flies to, don't bother fitting planes with cargo space (though one can still make a little money on cargo even though no cargo shows up in the Cargo Report). Office of Operations (Route Management) The next major part of the battle is site acquisition. Until many hours of play are spent with the game, concentrate on large cities, only picking up small or medium cities where they allow for connection to a large city, such as the Azores or Wake Island. It is more difficult to make money using small/medium city routes. Acquire sites at the beginning of each month. At the beginning of the game, go for New York. Put two or three planes on the New York-Miami run, and there should soon be enough cash for a DC-6 when it is available. After New York, acquire Los Angeles and San Francisco. Make the first transcontinental runs Miami-Los Angeles and Miami-San Francisco runs with DC-6's. Soon after LA and San Francisco are acquired, get either the Azores or Wake Island, otherwise Europe will be unreachable until the big planes become available. When planning routes for planes, try to maximize the plane's range in the route. This means that if the plane can travel 3000 miles before refueling, put it on routes that are as close as possible to 3000 miles to ensure maximum efficiency. If long range planes are put on short routes, extra cost will be incurred. Every stop on a route increases costs. Full planes are needed to make multi-stop routes profitable. Finally, remember that faster planes are more popular planes, since time inevitably means money to some people. Costs for each plane are basically equal to (plane mileage)/10 (Fuel Costs). Any comfort factors increase the cost, along with a poor plane size-to-route-length ratio. Maintenance costs and landing fees are paid at the end of the VIEH ALLE ROUTES year; all other fees and fuel costs are paid at the end of the month. Keep a very close eye on the cost/income ratio of each plane. If it is poor (i.e. the plane is incurring TAB Hashington DC541722 SUUSAS:* more cost than its return on investment), check the percentage of the plane's capacity that is being utilized and adjust ticket prices as necessary. If the percentage of the capacity in use is greater than 50%, try raising ticket prices. If the percentage is lower than 50% (particularly if it's lower than 25%), lower ticket prices and lure in more people with a fare war. Another approach is to re-examine the plane's route. Obviously, it is not economical to fly planes outfitted with plenty of cargo Page 76 Computer Gaming World "

"Theme Article VOC file to a sound card efficiently enough that it could be played properly. Still, the existence of cheap CD-ROM drives signifies the existence of many CDROM drives which, in turn, means potential for many new CD-ROM products. CD-ROMS can hold quantities of data near 900 MB, but more typically around 500 to 600 MB. This is a staggering figure when one considers how it compares to the capacity of a 3.5 inch high density floppy at just under 1.5 MB. Of course, everything that goes onto a CD-ROM has to be paid for by somebody, so most current CD-ROM games tend to be anything from the same old game but on a CD-ROM, to the same old game again but with the MT-32 music recorded in normal audio format (called Redbook) which just plays the music out of the CDROM drive. This may sound okay, but it's hardly a bargain for those who already have an MT-32 or LAPC-1. E-MU Systems is providing their previously mentioned Proteus Technology to Creative Labs for a daughter card PCM synthesizer similar to the Yamaha TG100, Roland Sound Canvas or Turtle Beach Multisound. The good news here is that this small card plugs into a Sound Blaster Pro 16 card and uses some of its circuitry for amplification and such in order to reduce the cost over adding an entirely separate PCM synthesizer card. This type of approach may be what finally puts good music and sound effects in the hands of the gamer-on-a-budget without having to give up good old Adlib or Sound Blaster compatibility in order to do it. (Continued from Page 46) PC sound card to use General MIDI: a list of instruments and ways of organizing MIDI files that would allow some level or portability of MIDI music files between synthesizers made by different manufacturers. Built-in PCM sampled instruments that sound very much like the real thing (because they are actually the real thing recorded and manipulated) make this class of synthesizer a giant step-up music-wise from anything that existed before. One problem with this kind of sound support, however is the difficulty it has in providing flexibility for sound effects. Turtle Beach has a sound card called the Multisound based on what E-MU Systems, a well established professional synthesizer maker, calls Proteus Technology. With both PCM instruments and the ability to do custom PCM recording and playback, this is a great sounding card like the Sound Canvas, but the $800 street price is still too much for even most serious gamers. Although their price may soon come down, there are now other sharks in the waters. Yamaha now has the TG-100. With sound in the same league with the Sound Canvas and a special connection for direct connection with a PC or MAC as well as the standard MIDI connections. This card has a distinctly DX-7 flavor although the technology is PCM. Meanwhile, Roland is planning a new version of their Sound Canvas card with the instrument list reduced to the General MIDI list, but with the welcome addition of PCM recording ability at a more competitive price. Roland also has their new SC-7 module which will connect to the serial port of a Mac or PC or to the MIDI port of anything MIDI. This module will be essentially a Sound Canvas on General MIDI instruments and Roland says it will sell for about half the price of the Sound Canvas. Media Vision has its Audioport Card which is similar, internally, to a base level Sound Blaster. It fits easily into a shirt pocket and plugs into the parallel port of any PC. It is battery powered with a small built-in speaker and volume dial. This means very portable OPL-2 and PCM for laptops. CD-ROM is essentially just like a music CD that contains different information and requires a special CD-ROM drive to use. CD-ROM drives came into the market at over a thousand dollars but I have seen ads for $199.00 CD-ROM drives. Caveat emptor â€” price tends to beget quality. Some CD-ROM drives are just enough below standard that they perform simple functions okay, but cannot feed a WAV or Other Neat Stuff Newer technologies are always being developed and, strangely enough, computer gaming is often at the cutting edge. There are a lot of very creative people in this industry and a mistake in a computer game never kills someone, so taking chances is acceptable. FM and PCM synthesis are not the end of the road for synthesizers. Research is going on in many corporations and universities to find new ways of creating sound. New methods for processing and controlling the sound already available are also being developed. QSound Lid. recently announced that Virgin was licensing QSound's full 3-D sound processing technology for use in Sega CD-ROM systems. QSound processes and reproduces sound for the gamer in a full, wrap around world, using only existing stereo equipment. Using just two speakers, QSound tricks the gamer's ears into thinking the sound is all around him/her. Award winning music from Madonna, Paula Abdul, Sting and Luther Vandross, as well as Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves (the film, not the game) have used the QSound Technology. With realtime software control of this kind of technology, gamers could well hear jets screaming up from behind them or cannons firing from their right without major hardware expenditures. Rock recording engineer Bob Clearmountain uses QSound to mix music. He says QSound \"enhances the music and its emotional power a lot.\" Frankly, the CD-ROM approach has a vast potential for providing fantastic sounding music for computer games, but it is expensive to pay people to do real studio quality music compared to just asking for a composition in the form of a MIDI file for an OPL-2 type sound card. This form of sound is also difficult to coordinate with events in the game. Using the vast space available on the CD-ROM for WAV or VOC PCM recordings which then must be sent to a sound card for playback is seen by some as a more workable solution but requires one to own both a CD-ROM drive and a sound card. Creative Labs and Media Vision both sell kits for just this purpose with new 16-bit sound cards which use OPL-3 synth chips and SCSI interfaces for a CD-ROM drive which they include in the kit. Needless to say these kits are not cheap. The Meaning of Life (Or, at least, a Conclusion) Gamers don't touch that volume dial! Listen to the music in computer games, then talk about it, complain about it or praise it. It can and will get better when developers know that we care. Developers â€” make the music a part of each game, not a last second add-on. Remember that the competition is Hollywood. I don't remember who it was, but a very wise composer once told me that all the equipment in the world didn't matter if I couldn't write good music for it. Now, that's where the state of the art is.

Next fiscal year will close March 1993. Sierra Stock Rebounds From Slough of Skepticism Sierra On-Line's common stock (NASDAQ: SIER) recently recovered from a disappointing low in August. That low was believed to be the result of investor disappointment with The Sierra Network on-line service and an announcement that the latest addition to the company's flagship series, King's Quest VI, would not ship during the fiscal quarter ending in August. Since the company could estimate sales of over 250,000 on the King's Quest title (based on the performance of past titles) and had anticipated a much more positive response on TSN by the present time, investors feared that TSN had become a \"black hole\" and KOVI would not perform as well as its predecessors. A few short weeks later, the stock experienced a significant recovery. Sierra CEO Ken Williams believes that the rebound was directly related to both the successful launch of and response to King's Quest VI, combined with a very optimistic earnings picture for the last six months of the fiscal year. Williams observed that the company shipped 15 products during the previous fiscal year with eight of those products shipping during the first half of the fiscal year. He estimated that the company would ship 27 products by the end of the current fiscal year and, even though only seven of those products shipped during the first half of the fiscal year, revenue was up 17% over the same period. Though revenue was up, Sierra reported a loss per share in earnings for the second quarter (ending in September, 1992). The loss per share was the first in, at least, 13 quarters (dating back to June of 1989 in the Standard & Poor's summary). The loss can be laid directly at the feet of The Sierra Network, but the company has high expectations about the network's future. Since the nadir in stock price, TSN 2.0 has began to penetrate the market and the subscriber base is growing at a rate of 300-500 per day (seven days per week). So, though it has been slower than expected in reaching its desired user base, many investors are seeing renewed hope in the project. Sierra is circa 71% institutionally owned and 13% insiderowned. There were approximately 2,500 shareholders of record at the end of June, 1992. CGW Page 80 Computer Gaming World "

"LLLLLLLLLLL COMPANY REPORT QOP Little Things Mean A Lot At QQP more than 13,000 feet of track, contains 400 bridges (some with more than 12,000 pieces of wood) and has 13-14 ft. high mountains that consist of more than 75,000 pounds of plaster. Bruce says that there is enough lumber in the set-up to build six ranch houses, and the entire set-up contains literally thousands of scale buildings and over 1,000 switches. In 1977, Bruce was able to combine his obvious interest in model railroading and his longtime wargaming hobby (Bruce states that he began playing Avalon Hill wargames in 1966) by opening a hobby shop. At this point in time, he was managing the hobby shop by day and performing music by night, a pace that he kept up through 1982. Dovetailing with his hobby interests, he formed the Flemington Wargame Society and The Perfect General was born. At least, the game which was played over a permanent hexgrid protected by polyurethane and had terrain and point values painted on top of the coating was born in 1978. According to Bruce, most of the club's members became so engrossed in their custom miniatures game that How Bruce Williams Zaccagnino Went From many of them stopped playing \"boxed\" wargames. When we visited Bruce, we met some of the old wargaming Hobby Store To Publisher crew and they all still played The Perfect General, though they now play the computer game version, while the old table-top sits idle. Yet, as if all of this activity was not enough, Bruce From 1972 until 1982, lots of people would have elected to pursue yet another hobby. In 1983, he purthought of Bruce Williams Zaccagnino as a musician. He chased a theatre pipe organ from a small mansion in played in supper clubs in the New Jersey area and later Connecticut.

"Company Report onto the scene in late 1991. The Perfect General had a more up-to-date interface and flashier graphics, but gamers tend to think of The Lost Admiral as having a more sophisticated artificial opponent. The tactical scale of The Perfect General seemed extremely attractive to many wargamers and it became a phenomenal first product, especially for a wargame. Wargames were supposed to be the marketing kiss of death when TPG and TLA hit the shelves. Now, they are experiencing a rebound due to the success of several titles. Several things happened with the success of TPG and TLA; one was that they hired Steve Cohen to serve as vice-president of operations. The second was that they accepted an unsolicited submission from Andrew Visscher; a card game which had more solitaire variants than any game they had ever seen. The third was that they learned from their simultaneous release of two quality products that it pays to offer a nice graphic look in addition to gameplay. That's why they hired graphic artist Tim Cuccolo to spruce up the look of their upcoming Conquered Kingdoms (see the related story in this issue) and Gary Stephens to provide a more polished touch to the box and manual art for all QQP products. The addition of Steve provided a competent and personable \"jack of all trades\" for both the marketing and development of all the QQP products. There is an exuberant, all-out \"go for it\" quality in Steve that lets one know that things are going to be done and they are going to be done quickly. Bruce tends to work quickly and quietly. Steve tends to be the pacing coach on the sidelines. The duo make for a solid management team. The solitaire product, Solitaire's Journey, was solid, but Bruce wanted it to have a little something extra. He conceived of the quest ideas and Andrew put them together, even though he concedes that he wasn't entirely convinced in the usefulness of that approach. Again, Bruce's instinct proved to be right and Solitaire's Journey proved to be a bigger hit than TLA and, at last report, was moving up on TPG in sales. Now, both Andrew and Bruce are happy. Indeed, so happy that Andrew is hard at work on a complete remake of TPG. The acceptance of Cuccolo's and Stephens's work remains to be seen, but we definitely think they will help make Conquered Kingdoms yet another QQP hit. Indeed, the boxes are looking better all the time and Cuccolo is learning new tricks on the computer every day. This bodes well for the company's future. The Perfect Game Design Speaking of the company's future, it is not about to put four fascinating titles on the shelves and disappear. The company is making big plans for the future. For one thing, they still accept unsolicited submissions like that of Andrew Visscher's solitaire program. An Atlanta-based developer has recently sold Battles of Destiny to QQP and it looks like it is getting the same type of playtesting and design effort as any of their other products. Visscher, as noted earlier, is hard at work on a remake of TPG, and Conquered Kingdoms is nearing completion. In addition, CEO Zaccagnino states that he has design notes for 30 unique new games and expects to produce them over the next decade. He wisely admits that the company may have to stay small in relation to other computer game companies in order to continue molding games into his overall philosophy, but he is willing to do Scenes from \"The World's Largest Model Railroad.\" so in order to reach his life's goal. Â«I'm on a quest to make one of the best games ever built-a Monopoly or Bridge or Chess that will last a person a whole lifetime. Asked the secret of QQP's successful game designs, Bruce summed matters fairly succinctly. Likening the process of creating a game to that of writing a novel, he stated that he felt more people knew about the Napoleonic era due to TolThe stoy's War and Peace than from the history Losit books. \"You have to write the historical roAdmiral mance as opposed to just the history.\" His Theyer Lana Destur goal, then, is to be the historical romance writer of computer games, one who offers just enough flavor ofan era, a style of warfare or strategy, to capture the imagination and pull the gamer into the alternate universe. To Bruce, the game itself is more important than the details, but the details have to fit together smoothly to build the game right. Part of his five year plan blends many of his QQP. accomplishments together. The success of QQP has allowed Bruce to acquire property on a highway, rather than off the rural road where the company is currently quartered. QQP plans to build a large threestory facility that will serve as a permanent (and more accessible) home for \"The World's Largest Railroad\", a doll museum, a new and larger recital hall for a larger version of the restored theatre organ, a residence for the Zaccagninos and, of course, a new headquarters for QQP. The variety of talents pull together to create enough income to be able to both build the new facility and give the railroad and the organ to the world. Bruce will have to charge Perfect some admission to be able to maintain the railroad, but he thinks considerably more peoGeneral ple will be able to experience it than the four or five thousand people who used to attend his rare, open house weekends. For computer gamers, the good news is clear. QQP will be adding three or more programs per year to its product line, and each will have that magic touch that Bruce Williams Zaccagnino puts on every product. Then again, what less could we expect from a fellow gamer?cow The TUNDY KOOPJanuary 1993 Page 85 "


"Review CV SSKS Prophecy of the Shadow by Jeff James VETER ROW.PLAING APATA. TITLE: Prophecy of the Shadow SYSTEM: IBM PRICE: $59.95 PROTECTION: Document look-up DESIGNER: Jaimi R. R. McEntire PUBLISHER: Sunnyvale, CA PROPHECY SHADOW SSI Cince 1988, Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI) and TSR, Inc. publisher of the famous Advanced Dungeons & Dragons people and paper role-playing game â€” have enjoyed a mutually propitious partnership. The products of that creative union have been slaking the adventuring thirst of thousands, if not millions of adventure gamers since then. While this partnership can undoubtedly be considered a success, SSI's latest role-playing offering, Prophecy of the Shadow, is a solo effort. Far from signaling a breakup in the TSR, Inc./SSI partnership, Prophecy can be viewed as SSI's attempt to have \"it's own space.\" Prophecy represents a number of firsts for SSI. Other than being the first adventure game published solely under the SSI label since the Phantasie trilogy, Prophecy is also SSI's first single-character adventure. Most notably, Prophecy also breaks new ground by being the first fantasy role-playing game to use digitized animation of costumed human actors. All of these aspects combine to make Prophecy a refreshingly enjoyable adventure, targeted primarily at role-playing neophytes. Prophecy's storyline is nothing new. The player-character's master has been slain, a princess must be rescued, an evil ruler must be deposed, and an even darker evil lurks in the shadows. While seasoned RPG'ers may almost disregard the masterfully redundant storyline, tenderfoot adventure gamers should find it a welcome background for adventuring. SSI is aiming STRATEGIC SIMULATIONS, INC. this product squarely at rookie role-players and most of Prophecy's characteristics reflect this. Character generation is a prime example of the Prophecy design philosophy. After choosing a name, a gender, and answering three short questions about the character's childhood, the player is ready to play. Instead of the lengthy list of character ability scores found in other adventures, Prophecy relies on only three attributes: health, agility and magic. No equipment to buy, no spells to memorize, and only one character to keep track of. Gamers fond of platoon-sized adventuring squads which must be equipped, fed, washed and scrubbed before hitting the trail would be well-advised to look elsewhere. Most of the game is controlled by accessing a strip of icons which vertically divide the Prophecy screen in half. These ten embossed icons control all of the actions in Prophecy, ranging from saving games to casting spells. While this interface works best with a mouse, SSI has thoughtfully included a full set of keyboard equivalents for stubborn keyboard users. The left side of the screen is devoted to listing character statistics and character inventory, while the right displays an isometric, overhead view of the action, much like the vantage point offered in Microillusion's Faery Tale Adventure or Origin's Ultima VI. Underneath this display is a text window which reports the results of searches and lists damage to both your character and any engaged enemies. The remaining space at the bottom of the screen is used as a text display. This sense of frugal simplicity exhibited in Prophecy's interface reveals itself in other aspects of the game as well.

Seen while conversing with the character in question, a short animation of perhaps 4-12 frames is seen of the character posturing, turning, walking The music is appropriate, with a sprightly marching tune for overland travel, and a collection of creepy dungeon ditties for subterranean travel. Some of the tunes can become overly repetitious, although the music can be toggled off if the player desires. Sound effects are also welldone, with the blood-curdling scream of a fallen foe sounding almost too real; I pity the poor SSI staffer induced to emit such Prophecy is a solid, albeit limited, offering from SSI and designer Jaimi McEntire. Seasoned adventurer gamers who demand huge game worlds, multi-character parties and difficult puzzles might frown at the design philosophy behind Prophecy. Prophecy is not, nor does it intend to be, a replacement for SSI'S AD&D series of role-playing games. However, gamers looking for something new and refreshing â€” where byzantine game mechanics take a back seat to ease-of-use and an engaging storyline â€” should find playing Prophecy to be well worth the quest.

"Review by Alan \"Slap Shot\" Emrich and Chris \"The Goon\" Lombardi INSTROD Though CGW's primary emphasis is on games for personal computers, we occasionally run across a quality game on a cartridge game system which we think would be of interest to our readers. Shot On Goa EA's NHLPA Hockey Scores With Two CGW Editors EN NHLPA NHLPA 11 INSURANS TY 113 USTURS The blades, the ice, the crack of the slapshot off the glass. The speed, the grace, l and the wicked crunch of a brutal check in the corner. The throngs in their sweaters and caps exploding with release as the overtime shot careens off the goalie's shoulder and into the net. There's nothing to match the passion, pulse and power of hockey. As certified and institutionally committed hockey nuts, we have been looking for a game that captures these sights, sounds and emotions of the sport. As equally rabid strategists, we needed a game that would capture the sport's tactical elements without sacrificing the visceral 'oomph' of the play. When Electronic Arts released their NHL Hockey for the SEGA Genesis, we were so impressed that a couple of CGW editors broke down and bought a system... in the name of their kids, of course, When we heard that EA was upgrading NHL Hockey, getting a National Hockey League Players Association endorsement contract, and renaming the game NHLPA Hockey, we heard little sirens in our heads, raised our editor's pens high in the air and formed a circle of cheering, macho celebration. NHLPA Hockey improves on its predecessor in many ways, but the most exciting is the inclusion of real hockey teams and player names. All 24 NHL teams are represented including the Tampa Bay and Ottawa expansion teams â€” and each team fields a near complete roster of players as they stood near the end of the '91-'92 season. Unfortunately, since the sport's general managers love to play 52-pickup with the league during the off-season, many of the rosters are inaccurate (i.e. there is no Lindros and Philadelphia still has the half-dozen players that are now Nordiques). Still, it's fun to look on the scorecard and see listings like, Lemieux from Jagr and Stevens: or Oates from Neely and Bourque. Like Wayne, I Want To Be Like Wayne More interesting than the names is the fact that the players will play somewhat like their ELECTRONIC ARTS SEGA Licensed the sees Enter Lad fplace the SECA GENESIS SYSTEM TITLE: SYSTEM: PRICE: DESIGNERS: NHLPA Hockey '93 SEGA Genesis $59.95 Michael Brook.

"Review mostly because there are far too many break-aways on the tiny rink, and in part because excited players tend to put an enormous number of shots on goal. Though not terribly realistic, these factors make the game that much more dynamic. BITIOS flesh counterparts. Each player is rated in a dozen significant categories: from energy level, to skating skill, to shot and passing accuracy, to fighting propensity and skill. One knows by the player's strength and shooting skill that they are controlling Mario Lemieux, the passes are almost always on target when controlling the Great One, and one certainly isn't surprised to see Marty McSorley skating to the box for a roughing penalty. The game play in general is quite realistic as well. With the \"Penalties\" option on, the refs will call the full gamut of infractions, and in a fairly realistic way. \"Offsides\" and \"icing\" create their usual headaches for the team on the offensive; players com22 230 mitting major penalties will be slapped with fives minutes in the box; \"interference\" will be called on a player who invades the goalie's crease; and the ref will even signal delayed penalties (and the goalie will even come off the ice!) until the offending team takes control of the puck. The only rule omission takes control of the puck The only rule omission we were able to find, besides some of the new rules for the '92-'93 season, was the \"two line pass\" â€” which would have been a problem given the somewhat skewed scale of the rink-to-player size in the game. The Goon Squad Defensively, NHLPA Hockey is a whole new puck game compared to its predecessor. Goalies have become much more intelligent and more difficult to score against. The animations have them diving, lunging and kicking away slapshots like their real-life counterparts. Players also have a wider variety of defensive commands to choose from. Hooking other players or hip checking them off-balance is easily done (perhaps too easily), but the refs will only let so much go by before blowing the whistle. Vicious body checks can be thrown with a combination of a speed burst (button C) and a \"check\" command (button B). If the check is vicious enough, the victim may be knocked for a loop and forced to leave the game for a period or two. This capability lends naturally to goon or \"enforcer\" tactics wherein a coach assigns a burly Neanderthal to rough-up the opposing team's finesse men. With the line changing feature, players can set up such a \"checking line\" in addition to 6 other lines) and put that line into the game with the flick of an \"A\" button. Each team's lines can be edited by the player and saved to the battery powered cartridge for future play. These features make NHLPA Hockey a more strategic and defensive game, though the scores between practiced players will tend to be a bit inflated Frills and Chills Beyond the hot game play, NHLPA Hockey has a rink full of features and cute fluff that really fleshes out the excellent core game. Cheers and boos from the crowd correspond with the hometeam's play, and there is a Crowd-Meter that records the decibel level of the crowd to give players a gauge as to how much the crowd is into the game. A high crowd rating will even give the home team a psychological shot in the arm advantage. An arena organist will play the cliched sound-bites during appropriate game situations. During line changes and at the end of penalties, the players will PIT 1 hop over the bench wall or come out of the penalty ISHSH 2 box. During period breaks one can view other scores from around the league and can even view highlight films of the game's exciting goals! The net can be dislodged from the posts and the rare slapshot will break a pane of the plexiglass. The game offers a replay feature that will not only allow one to rewind and review 10 seconds of game-play, but one can even focus on a player or section of the rink so as to better visualize how a goalscoring play developed. The replay feature is a great \"in your faceÂ» feature as one can illustrate to their grumbling opponent how to properly run a power-play or set up a \"trailer man\" for a rebound goal. NHLPA Hockey is as littered with cute features as a rink after a hat-trick. Single games can be played between two players or the computer, or players can enter a play-off tree that is structure like the NHL play-off system. As players progress through the four \"best of seven\" steps in the tree their statistics are compiled and saved to the battery-powered cartridge. If players power-down, they can come back to the saved position on the play-off tree at any time. We should also point out that, though we didn't use it much, there is an option that allows two players to play on the same team against the computer. The Parting Shot As we wind up for a last blue-line slap at NHLPA Hockey, we must first tip our helmets to EA for an excellent upgrade to a decent game. The addition of real players, the refinement of the play action and the inclusion of detail that only true hockey fans could program and appreciate, all combine to create one of the best action-oriented sports games we've seen. While it's no Wayne Gretzky Hockey in terms of statistics and league play capabilities, it is a great time and just about as realistic and detailed as one could hope a cartridge game to be. With hoarse voices from a night of too much noisy fun, we give NHLPA Hockey two red and blistered thumbs up. Cow Page 92 Computer Gaming World "

"Review The Icing On The Puck Bethesda's Wayne Gretzky Hockey 3 by Gordon Goble ETZKY IKEY TITLE: Wayne Gretzky Hockey 3 SYSTEM IBM (3/4 rink view requires 585K Base Memory and an additional 512K Expanded Memory) PLAYERS: PRICE: $59.95 PROTECTION: Documentation Look-Up DESIGNERS: C. Walton, D. Gregory PUBLISHER: Bethesda Softworks Rockville, MD I grew up watching hockey, playing street hockey and really enjoying a good game of table hockey. I guess you could say I like hockey. The first electronic hockey I ever played was a marginally more complex adaptation of \"Pong,\" nearly twenty years ago. Engaging in interactive entertainment on my family's television set was, at that time, an unbelievable sensation. Bethesda's Wayne Gretzky Hockey 3 (WGH3) represents just my second experience with computerized hockey, and I was drooling (like Homer Simpson over a good steak) in anticipation. The box was torn open in a frenzy of cardboard and shrink wrap, and my assessment had begun. WGH3 is a slightly flawed attempt at the perfect sports simulation. It looks like the real thing and, at first, seems to play like the real thing. But after a little experimentation, it becomes apparent that as far as definitive computer hockey goes, the Great One should have waited a little longer before lending his name. The sheer magnitude of WGH3 is the first surprise. At 9 megs of installed size (13 megs of free disk space are required for a fast load), it is indeed a fat little fellow. Yet once installed, running WGH3 to its full potential involves two somewhat annoying procedures; adding the name of your sound card to the command line each and every time you play (batch this to save time), and the initiation of your computer's expanded memory facilities. There are two main interfaces to WGH3; a press box view of the rink, wherein specific team, roster, coaching and mode-of-play choices are presented; and the game view itself. It is abundantly clear that game designers have poured a tremendous amount of effort into the former. Decisions, decisions...pre-game options are indeed plentiful. Game action can be viewed from two angles; the nosebleed overhead roof cam, or the new (and infinitely superior) \"3/4\" view. Length of game, duration of game (for those fitting a little pro hockey between appointments), choice of referee, fights on/off, penalties on/off... these are but a sampling of available variations. Last, but definitely not least, the teams involved in the upcoming tilt must be decided. Choices of those teams include all NHL rosters from the 1992 season, Bethesda's own makeshift squad made up of WGH3 programmers and designers, or any new powerhouse group that comes to mind. Once participating teams (and, if desired, the color of their uniforms) have been decided, any player can be modified by enhancing or detracting from up to ten of his on-ice strengths and weaknesses. Even his name can be changed (somehow Wayne Gretzky became Gord Goble, for instance). Having gotten this far, an important decision must be made -to coach or not to coach, that is the question. If coaching is defaulted to the computer, it will make the decisions as to which players are thrown into the fray at what times and which of a variety of pre-set plays will be put into action in given circumstances. However, if the armchair Gretzky elects to coach himself, these time-consuming, yet possibly very effective options can be tailored in any fashion he wishes. One more important stop before the action commences the Coach's Clipboard. Here, deep in the bowels of the locker room, in the coach's own sloppy handwriting, certain critical options are decided. Will the overall team plan include frequent \"dumping-in\" of the puck or is this going to be a tic-tac-toe passing unit? Which player will be under human control? This is one area not to be skipped, for it involves a most important choice, requiring a little preliminary explanation. Once on the ice, Mr. Armchair Gretzky will be in total control of just one of his team's players at a time. This will never change. While a set of standard plays can be preconceived generalizing his chosen team's style, there will always be one player only responding to his human coach's signals (via keyboard, joystick or mouse). The player under human control operates in one of two ways, and that decision must be made now. Choosing the \"Puck Hog\" (Continued on Page 98) Page 94 Computer Gaming World "

"Review \"Wolfing Down\" Takes On New Meaning In id Software's Latest Call of the TITLE: Spear of Destiny, a Wolfenstein 3-D Adventure (Original Wolienstein 3-D not required to play) SYSTEM: IBM PRICE: $59.95 PROTECTION: Documentation Look-Up DESIGNER: id Software DISTRIBUTOR: Formen Corp. North Andover, MA by Bryan A. Walker Wolfenstein 3-D episodes will be right at home. The regular troops â€” SS, killer dogs and mutants â€” still prowl around in droves. However, there's now a variety of new scenery, devastating new bosses, and smart, fast SS Officers. Sound effects are generally the same, with some great new \"death rattlesÂ» added. Very good new murith Wolfenstein 3-D, (reviewed in CGW #98) id Software sounded a clarion call to gamers who thought that entertainment software of exceptional quality came only from the established publishing leaders. Whisper-smooth first-person graphics, great sound, nail-biting game play and violence o' plenty set the first episodes apart from the gaming crowd. Now, fearless hero B.J. Blazkowicz returns in this, the stand alone finale of the Wolfenstein 3-D saga, Spear of Destiny. The prelude to the mission reads as so; Hitler, notorious occultic artifact collector, has acquired the weapon that was used to stab Jesus Christ as he was crucified. The possessor of this legendary Spear of Destiny is said to be invincible, prompting the Allies to send B.J. on a suicide mission. The objective: steal the Spear away from the Third Reich. Rules of engagement: kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out. And everyone knows that FLOOR when B.J. takes on a \"suicide mission,\" it's murder on the Nazis! Those familiar with the earlier sic adds atmosphere to the proceedings, particularly on the final levels. What Spear of Destiny really offers the player is additional challenge and even more of the trademark violence and gore of the earlier episodes. New players might be advised to start on a lower difficulty setting. Having played through on the \"Death Incarnate\" level, I encountered many areas absolutely jampacked with enemies. The resulting exchanges of gunfire were so intense and visceral, I could almost smell the cordite! If Mack Bolan fans find out about this game, id Software will have the biggest cross-over hit in software history! As with the earlier Wolfenstein 3-D episodes, gamers who expect the slain enemies to \"de-res\" while dying neatly and quietly will be woofing their milk and cookies. Be that as it may, there's an appeal to mowing down a line of Nazis with a sweep of a red-hot minigun that just can't be found in other games.

"Review took the Destiny Spear. A system lock-up was the result, but turning off the Soundblaster digitized sound option provided the fix. There are those sensitive people who are going to be scrambling for the smelling salts after seeing Spear of Destiny. It's brutal and bloody, no doubt. It's also a well-executed and enjoyable game. The real gaming warriors who like a lot of \"oomphÂ» in their entertainment will find Spear of Destiny can rock 'n roll with the best of 'em. Girly-gamers need not apply! DIMMA HTA: 2901932032 2001 esc ONE 000S 01 CGW The four new Bad Guys, along with a surprise Ultimate Bad Guy, are tougher than those of previous episodes. Even worse, they're often surrounded by their own escort of regular enemies. Standing toe-to-toe against these ugly chumps, or trying to fight them and ignore the escorts will rapidly result in a severely ventilated those who think that obtaining the Spear of Destiny is the final step are going to be thrown a curve. I won't spoil the surprise, but be prepared for an environment and enemies that would scare the bean dip out of Clive Barker. This surprise final-level endgame is an excellent touch! The only real weakness of the game is that there are no technical improvements over the earlier episodes.Spear of Destiny has many situations that cry out for new weapons and equipment. Proportional joystick response alone would have been a huge improvement in gameplay. Joe Garagiola might say \"Spear of Destiny is more of the same, only a lot more so.\" While suggesting these features for future Wolfenstein 3-D episodes to Jay Wilbur of id Software, I was informed that Spear of Destiny is the final installment of B.J.'s adventures against the Third Reich.

"Strategy Bringing Enlightenment To The Darklands A Player's Guide to Darklands -Part II mo by Samuel B. Baker II eep in the dark forests of medieval Germany, a wise alchemist unveiled arcane secrets regarding the world of \"Darklands.\" Unfortunately, too few people could read those secrets, so we published them in Computer Gaming World. Since the wise scholar has continued to disseminate the ingredients of successful role-playing, we have acted as the custodians of said knowledge and elected to publish another installment in our continuing effort to bring enlightenment to the \"Darklands.\" After further experimentation on unwilling dwarves and other nasties, we discovered that a longsword seems to be the best allaround weapon choice. It is fast and can deliver 20-30 points of damage when strong edge and deadly blade are applied. Medieval vivisection also indicates that long bows with Trueflight spell enhancements are also quite effective. In addition, adventurers who plan ahead might consider buying darts to improve the throwing skills of the party. In this way, when the crunch comes, potions may be delivered with lethal accuracy. As parties can afford it, it is wise to train, train, train. One should pay particular attention to increasing religion and alchemy skills, since ineptitude can have incendiary consequences and townspeople tend to have little patience with parties that dissolve the inn and the like. The party's religious specialist may prove to be a good secondary alchemist for making the easy 3 potions, such as Sunburst, Stone Tar and Essence of Grace, since that character will most likely have some brains. Some consideration should be given to marching off to Nurnberg. Nurnberg is a wonderful city. Its shoppes have very nice hand weapons and armor (37 quality) and it also has a university. Universities are expensive places to train, but they teach Healing. Physicians teach Healing as well, but most of the time they are much less willing to give instruction. Since the higher the party's local rep goes the less things cost, a move to Nurnberg will bear good fruit as the party increases their local rep. Remember, when moving about in a city, never sneak out or stay in the ghetto areas, as it messes up the local rep. Always try to charm the guards or sneak into a city. Both of these will increase skills, and if one has success talking with the guards, the party's local rep will go up. Virtue seems to be one of the things that new players have problems with. Once the party has some cash (say 10 to 15 florins), start donating at village churches (that aren't devil worshipers!) and wellknown churches in town. This will work better as the character's religious skill goes up. Escorting caravans and pilgrims also may give an increase. When the party has chain or better armor and has primary weapon skills in the 40s, start looking for evil lords. They live in the same sort of keeps that the Raubritters do. They can be found out by talking to the peasants. If the peasants are reticent, keep trying; eventually they will talk. It will be obvious from what they say whether all is well or not. When confronting the problem of getting inside an evil noble's castle, the best way is to sneak inside. However, most of the time, the party member selected for this task will blow it and fall, thus alerting those inside. If the party has the money, bribe the guard. This way the party starts out on the ground level and should be able to fully loot the castle before encountering the lord of the manor. Most of the time, if one of the party asks politely, a Raubritter will let the party in and feed them dinner, planning to kill them later. If the party retires to their rooms, they can sneak out and pillage at their leisure, facing only one or two of the Raubritter's men at a time instead of eight men at once and the Raubritter himself in plate. In either of these cases, if the party accidentally runs into the head honcho early, they will get booted out of the castle after Page 104 Computer Gaming World "

"Strategy killing him, and a message will say that the party has looted the castle. Lies, lies, lies! An industrious party can easily make 20 florins cash and items if allowed to work their way completely through a castle. If the party gets booted out early, simply make note of where that bad old boy is and load the game from the saved position players created prior to entering the castle. (Guild regulations require CGW readers to save prior to entering castles, dungeons, mines, caves and software stores with no exchange privileges.) The Raubritter will be in the same place, so that location may be left for last on the itinerary. Also, if the party runs DET 4 28 30 99% Ganther 1 35 40 99 creases. My party's virtue went up by six points at the conclusion alone. Victory over the witches will require about a dozen New Wind potions and several Sunbursts or Eyeburns. Of course, the other means of improving the party's reputation is to slay a dragon. Basically, going after a dragon is an exercise in pain management. Many pitfalls await the player in the forms of mists and rains that tend to degrade the quality of all weapons and armor that the party is carrying and zap the party's store of alchemical components. Dragons are most easily found in forests during the winter. Those with a sound board who have left the music on will hear a prolonged gong note repeating when the party is near. One should expect to spend at least two months searching for one of these beasts. Fighting a dragon is easy. Use Firewall on every party member or pray to a flame-retardant saint when the party is on the battlefield. Throw something to discommode the beastie, walk forward and wail away. The party will be rewarded with 50 florins and a 100-point increase in fame. Before the party enters the Templar's abode, be sure that it has a couple of dozen or more Stone Tar potions and an equal number of Sunbursts. Throwing a Sunburst or two at the same time a Stone Tar is tossed in the doorway slows down their reactions long enough for the Stone Tar to deploy. One can then set up the two best fighters in the doorway or hallway while the other characters find a good line of sight into the room and ply their bows. With the Lise of potions it is possible to kill a Templar with three bowshots. With Stone Tar blocking their path, the fighters in front can use their bows for one or two shots before having to engage in hand to hand. Any Templars that make it into melee should go down quickly since they have all probably gotten hit by at least one arrow. In the large courtyard, one can station the three best shots of the party in one corner of the courtyard and have the other fellow run up to rooms on the opposite side and open doors. This usually attracts the attention of those within, but some bashful beasties 1 19 25 34 into him in a large room with several doors, some of the party can run to the doors and open them, giving the party more bodies to loot.

Ubile heis invoked, the party may travel on water as though it wereland for a period of one day Mines are a decent source of loot and may provide a few items of quality. The party should have a good supply of potions of various sorts to ease the burden of fighting. If the party should stumble upon a chest that is trapped, consider long and hard whether the party's EOD fellow can dispose of the device. Eaterwater will not work on a trapped chest. It will be the skill of the individual that will determine the outcome. The penalty for failure is an explosion that is triggered each time the disarm attempt fails on that device. This can quickly lead to tattered armor and tattered bodies as the dangerspace is quite large. After such an experience, one may be forced to withdraw. This may be done in some safety, as the mines do not reset for several weeks. What is killed will stay dead if one returns in a matter of days. I would not recommend an extended interruption, because part of the mines may change and some creatures may return to life. When the party has defeated several Raubritters and evil lords and has been through one or more mines, it may be time to consider finding and wrecking a witches' sabbat. If the party cannot find a village that has turned to witchcraft, it is possible to find out the date of the next sabbat by praying to a saint at a sabbat location. These look like lopsided monasteries in grey stone. Once the date and place is known, the party will most likely have to hustle to get there in time. Having superb quality horses and sticking to the roads will save lots of time. To use horses, give one to each party member. They cannot be equipped. And remember to give one to Hanse when he offers to help. I forgot to give one to Hanse myself. One of my friends pointed this out to me and suggested that I tie a rope to Hanse and drag him along behind. When encountering pilgrims on the way to a sabbat, giving them money may return a virtue increase and save the party valuable time. The party might also consider boats. There are few encounters on them and they make good time. Defeating a sabbat will produce a raft of skill and virtue inSuccess: 49 DF Remaining:59 ore divine Favoris spent ess divine Favoris spent Saint Day ray now For.. is on't pray right now 1 September 11 may have to be enticed to come out and play by darting into the room and shooting them to attract their notice. When they give chase, the track star of the party can run around, staying out of harm's way while the three stalwarts make colanders out of their armor. While wandering the halls of the Templars and delving in the mines, the lead character should not wear his or her Sunday best as it may soon be ruined by the odd booby trap. One may always change into the good armor when lighting draws nigh. We can only hope that dispensing such wisdom will enable characters to survive and succeed. Here's hoping our readers find the light of victory rather than a dark demise in Darklands. CGW Page 106 Computer Gaming World "

"Review SALO a s . S Legend's Spellcasting 301: Spring Break . by Charles Ardai 3/H DIARY SIPERCADERIG 201 IBM VO 256-COLIH LEGEND OTTANUT writes interactive fiction should take a good, hard look at what Meretzky is doing, because he is doing it right. Those Are The Breaks, Kid In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love. --Tennyson Ah, the spring. Season of renewal, of the Earth's rebirth, of effervescence TITLE: Spellcasting 301: Spring Break SYSTEM: and delight; of balmy PRICE: $59.95 breezes, hot beaches, cool PROTECTION: None DESIGNER: Steve Meretzky beer, loud music; string PUBLISHER: Legend Entertainment bikinis, tanned bodies and Chantilly, VA well-oiled muscles; of adolescence in full, ribald flower. It is about this season that Alan Jay Lerner once wrote, \"It's wild! It's gay!/A blot in ev'ry way./The birds and bees with all of their vast/Amorous past/Gaze at the human race aghast\" and boy, was he right. Can anyone who has ever tuned in to the Spring Break reports on MTV or \"A Current Affair\" doubt that Mssrs. Lerner and Tennyson knew whereof they spoke? In recent years, Spring Break has even eclipsed Mardi Gras to become the defining annual event of American hedonism. Of course, it should be noted that Mr. Lerner put his words into the mouths of the Knights and Ladies of the Round Table in \"Camelot\" and that Mr. Tennyson wrote his paean to youthful excess way back in 1842. So, while the phenomemon of Spring Break is a decidedly modern one, it clearly has its bacchic antecedents throughout history. It is true that one can hardly imagine a proper Victorian lad cannonballing into a pool or Merlin the wizard hanging ten in the Fort Lauderdale surfbut then, not all Victorian lads were proper and not all wizards were Merlin. That springtime frolics know no cultural or temporal bounds and that all wizards are not Merlin, by a long shot is demonstrated most effectively in Spellcasting 301: Spring Break. In this latest installment of Legend's Spellcasting series, the incomparable Steve Meretzky imagines what his nerdy, fledgling wizard, Ernie Eaglebeak, would do over one particular spring break from arcane, old Sorcerer U. What Ernie would do, according to Meretzky, is scope girls, drink beer, attend oil wrestling matches and wet t-shirt contests, body surf, run weird errands for a local Sorcerers' Guild, and lose money in a crooked casino (not to mention have dalliances with any number of willing young women). With activities like these to adapt, it was probably inevitable that someone would eventually turn Spring Break into a computer game. We should be grateful that this adaptation has one of the best crews in the business at the helm. Spellcasting 301 is vintage Meretzky, up there with his earlier classics such as Planetfall, Sorcerer, and Leather Goddesses of Phobos. Everyone else who After what Ernie went through in the first two games, the poor boy certainly deserves a break. (In case anyone has forgotten exactly what he did, the new game offers an irresistable recap to start things off. Irresistable mainly because it is delivered by a bodacious babe wearing a mortarboard, an open graduation gown, and very little else.) A break is not what Ernie gets, however, mostly because he has to spend Spring Break defending his manhood and the manhood of his equally geeky frat brothers against the assaults of the manly men of rival frat Getta Loda Yu. As in the movie \"Revenge of the Nerds, Part Two: Nerds In Paradise,\" which this game occasionally resembles, the plot revolves around the battle between the amiable schlubs of the good-guy frat and the brain-dead, musclebound he-men of the bad guy frat. The player's job is to use Ernie's ingenuity and magic to balance out the natural advantages the GLY brothers possess, such as good looks and muscles. The story is divided into a number of separate challenges, with Ernie having to tackle a few every day. This plot device helps keep the story fresh and the action moving as long as the player keeps doing something (time doesn't advance between moves), the story keeps progressing. This means that it is possible to do almost everything wrong and still get fairly far into the game. It is also possible to win the game without beating every individual challenge.

"Review Picture, for instance, what Meretzky would want done with the studfinder Ernie finds in a hardware store. Picture what solution he'd devise for winning in a casino where the house is crooked. Go ahead. Picture. Too Darn Hot Speaking of pictures, Spellcasting 301 has an advatage over older Meretzky hits in that it is not a pure text game. Though the text is delicious, the graphics here are half the fun. All the Spellcasting games have featured sexy scenes, but this installment really goes over the top (becoming \"topless?\"), with few locations lacking in specimens of feminine pulchritude. There are even a handful of full-screen digitized images of beach bunnies in pin-up poses and bikinis which would do credit to any edition of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. While there is nothing more raunchy than might be seen on, say, \"The Benny Hill Show,\" that still leaves plenty of ground to be covered (or uncovered, as the case may be). Because of this \"open\" design, and the fact that Meretzky does not throw in some grave threat to humanity that Ernie has to thwart while on his break, the atmosphere of the game is relaxed. Appropriately enough, it has something of a vacation feel to it: the player samples the sights, chats with the natives, has a great time, and leaves feeling refreshed. This is not to say that the game is easy. It's just not difficult in any of the irritating ways that adventure games often are. The parser is friendly (even when it doesn't understand a command one enters, it says so in a witty way); the game draws its own map; there are a number of well-thought-out dedicated interfaces for special activities (flying a magic carpet, getting around one's hotel, playing the casino games); and the puzzles demand reasoning on the part of the player, not just an easy association of ideas. This last point is worth emphasizing, especially in light of the growing trend toward point-and-click adventures in which a player's possible actions are limited to a small number of verbs set out as buttons on the screen. Of necessity, these games typically require the player to do little more than pick up an object on one screen and deposit it in the appropriate location on another. (Some games even have a catch-all *Use\" command, but it is the computer that figures out what \"Use\" means in any given situation, not the player.) In Spellcasting 301, one enters commands in plain English and must come up with detailed, step-by-step solutions to the game's intricate puzzles. Except in one instance (which is clearly a parody of similar scenes in other games), there are no quests doled out along the lines of, \"Young man, I will give you the sword you seek, but only once you have brought me the Lost Lariat of Laredo.\" Here, instead, each situation embodies a unique set of obstacles, subtly presented, which can only be overcome through the use of one or more of the objects and spells Ernie has collected along the way. The spells, in particular, are interesting because each is, in effect, an additional verb: one casts a spell by typing in its name followed by the name of the object on which the spell is meant to act, exactly the same way one \"invokes\" a verb. This means that the player not only has a wide range of English verbs to choose from outside Restore of the usual, boring \"Push,\" \"Open,\" \"Take,\" and so forth, but a wide range of exotic verbs as well. There's a \"Spunj,\" for instance, which means \"Enlarge tree rootsÂ» and Â«Voy,Â» which means \"Create dungarees.Â» Adding to the fun is a spell which mutates other spells (effectively doubling the number of spells in the game) and the fact that spells can be cast on themselves. The result is that Spellcasting 301 is command-rich. There are a lot of different things one can do, and one can do them in such a large set of locations that the game really succeeds in doing what only the best interactive fiction does creating the sense that one is exploring a roomy, well-simulated alternate reality. Capping things off is a large dose of Meretzky's devious and inimitable wordplay. (Who will ever forget the \"Textractor\" in Leather Goddesses that turned a rabbit into a rabbi?) Puns and gags enliven all the puzzles and are central to one or two of the best. Help Picture HAR Inventory Ei Exane bathing at DIP soll Drop I LA You climb the winding store and enter the roon at the top Open coral eyeglas TOY spell PAIH  harbor Two display modes are available. In \"Nice\" mode, black censorship bars cover particularly risque portions of the graphic window. In \"Naughty\" mode, anything goes. The graphics are sometimes stunning and sometimes just okay, sometimes erotic and sometimes not, and there is very little outright nudity. Players apt to be offended by the next closest thing, or by the relentless (though all-in-fun) portrayal of women as sex objects, should think carefully before booting this one up. Be prepared that the Naughty mode also features some fairly salty dialogue, including one memorable catfight after an oil wrestling match, and a good deal of matter that the more prudish among us might find objectionable. At one party, for example, Ernie's frat brothers pass around a plate of magic mushrooms (though in this game, who knows, maybe they really are magic mushrooms). In another scene, a hundred men line up for a go at insatiable nymphomaniac Hillary Tickingclock (you might say Hillary swings like a pendulum). When Ernie's turn comes, he can take the encounter as far as he wants, to the accompaniment of digitized heavy breathing on the soundtrack. The parser understands every obscenity I could think of (and I'm from New York), responding appropriately to one's explicit instructions and requests. My position on the issue of adult content such as the above is one of indulgence, both in the sense that I enjoyed indulging in the shameless, bawdy material myself and in the sense that I think those who don't enjoy it should at least indulge those who do. It is a harmless enough pleasure; and no one who sees this game in a store, with its cover painting of a nearly naked spring breaker, could possibly mistake it for the latest addition to the Carmen Sandiego line. Also, while Meretzky is well on his way to being a dirty old man, he is no pornographer. More explicit material abounds at any newsstand. Still, the emptor should get his caveat and I feel obliged to make this point clearly: gamers should not buy this game if they would not want sexual matter on their hard drives.

"Review Laveny Spring Break Errs Even Homer nods, or so the saying goes, and as talented as he is, Steve Meretzky is no Homer. The game does have a handful of flaws which, if they had been corrected, would have made playing Spellcasting 301 an even more enjoyable experience. The most striking flaw is a technical one: if one is impatient with the game, it crashes. Specifically, if one tries to alter one's bet when playing Blockjock after typing \"Play Blockjock\" but before the special Blockjock screen comes up, the computer goes haywire, beeping endlessly until rebooted. Also, if one tries to sell a second item at the pawn shop before the first sale has been fully processed, the result is an on-screen memmum wawa ory dump followed by the player getting Map kicked out of the program. Fortunately, there is a simple way to avoid these bugs: slow down a little and wait until a command is requested before typing one in. More trivial, but also fixable, are vocabulary quirks such as the fact that when trying to heave a sack of gold off a flying carpet the player can say \"Throw sack\" or \"Throw bag,\" but not \"Throw gold.\" Then, there are occasional throwbacks to the old days of adventure gaming which I wish would be thrown back: if I never love again see questions of the form, Â«Which door do you mean, the front door, the back door, or the refrigerator door?Â» (when the best choice is obvious) and comments such as \"You are not holding your spellbook\" (when it is stashed in a valise one is carrying), it will be too soon. Other gripes could be raised as well, but these are mostly matters of taste. For instance, there is a bit too much attention given to exactly how much money Ernie has at any given time and how many items he is carrying for my taste. If I had written the game, I would have removed all instances of the response \"You are holding too much to pick that up,\" because it serves no useful function. For the most part, though, gameplay is extremely smooth. The game understands a lot of synonyms, many puzzles have multiple solutions, and the plot is structured with enough care to make it almost impossible for the player to slip accidentally into a no-win situation. In the 30-or-so hours it will take the average player to finish the game, problems will crop up only sporadically, maybe three or four times in all. The rest of the time, Spellcasting 301: Spring Break offers great entertainment and nothing but. There is more creativity and cleverness Em evident in a typical sequence of Spellcasting 307 than there is in some entire games; when you play this game, you are constantly aware that you are in the hands of a master. The game may not have much about it that is socially redeeming, but as low comedy goes, it is peerless. And now that Benny Hill is gone, we need Steve Meretzky more than ever. It comes down to this: I can think of no better way to while away some cold winter nights than with this sexy, funny, nutty little treasure of a game. Or, at least, none that could be printed in a family magazine.

"Letters GREETINGS from without having the wave pass by quickly. But for a brief moment in time ... One article I have not seen in 100 issues was how each of your gaming staff would purchase a computer given a reasonable amount of money, and what features they would insist on and why. Would M. Evan Brooks insist on the same speed as Scorpia? Would Johnny Wilson buy the same sound card as Russell Sipe? While on the subject of sound cards, a few years ago, you published an article on picking the \"right\" sound card. With the technological changes, is it time for an update? It was interesting to re-read Chris Crawford's article in Volume 1.1 to see how clearly he could see through time. I hope to be able to write you a letter after your 200th issue with the same enjoyment it gives me to write this one. Bruce Johnson Buckeye, AZ The truth is that Scorpia is faster than Evan (just kidding Scorp, I was talking about your machine, could you put down that axe? Please? Preferably somewhere besides in my head). Actually, Evan upgraded to his present 386 prior to Scorpia's upgrade, but Scorpia increased her processor speed very recently. Wargames do not usually require as much processing power as graphic adventures and CRPGs, but Evan also likes simulations and they require the faster processors. Evan is looking to upgrade. Also, while Johnny and Russell both like the Roland, Johnny's too cheap to buy one. As for the sound card article, we had intended to publish one in this issue. Unfortunately, we are still waiting for several manufacturers to release some of the cards we were getting excited about. We'll have to give you the same answer they give us, our next sound card article will be RSN (Real Soon Now). requie Johnny ancor the sounfortunatel Long Time Passing I would like to congratulate you and your staff on your 100th issue. It is remarkable considering the tremendous changes that have taken place since your magazine was established in 1981, I picked up a copy of your first issue in some forgotten computer store in Costa Mesa in December of 1981 I subscribed without hesitation and my subscription has run without interruption for 10 years. I am not sure how many of us there are, but I have every issue, 1.1 through 100. However, I have not collected them for sake of collection alone. I would like to compliment you by stating without reservation that I enjoyed every issue. Although I am a wargamer at heart, growing up with Avalon Hill boardgames in the mid-late '60s, I want to let you know that I enjoy reading about all the various facets of the industry. I don't play the role-playing, sports or arcade games, but still enjoy reading the reviews and articles because I want to know what direction the industry is heading. I entered the computer age partially due to the vision that someday I could sit down and play Third Reich without having to coerce an unwilling friend, travel umpteen miles through rural Arizona to find another gamer, or endure the necessary delays of PBM. I have owned and enjoyed an Atari 800, an Amiga 1000 and currently own a 386/25 clone. I am now laying down the specifications for my next generation of computer. Although it will be used for business purposes on my Arabian horse breeding farm, 1 will also ensure that it has the state of the art technology to keep me entertained. After all, what is the fun of growing older if you can't afford to indulge yourself now and then. Even if I get less and less time to game on the computer, I can at least make it \"quality\" time! Although, the research is incomplete, I will generally be looking at a 486/33 local bus with 32-bit hard drive controller and video card. A 16-bit sound card to tie into my stereo system at 100 watts/channel. An oversized monitor. CD-ROM to position myself for future advances in that technology. 8 MB RAM, 256K cache, 340 MB hard drive, etc. With all of the advances in computer technology, it is hard to climb to the crest of the technological wave and ride it very far Bomber, Man! In the October, 1992 article by Mr. Brooks, \"Carrier Strike: A Campaign Replay II,\" he laments that the Japanese dive bombers can only deliver a 250 lb. bomb (as opposed to the American 1000 pounder). It should be noted that in the game it is a 250 kilogram bomb (one kilogram = 2.2046 pounds), so the bombs he laments are equivalent to 551.15 pounds. Keith Maehren Tigard, OR Gee, no wonder his deck crew had hernias. Hundred Years Score The HYW review in CGW #100 was nicely done, but I have a few comments on some of the erroneous statements made. Ken went on about the value of the ducat and the cost of things in the game. Apparently he missed the item in the documentation (specifically the glossary) that stated: \"Ducat â€” A currency invented for this game because of the multiplicity of different currencies used during the period. One English Pound is worth 600 Ducats, one French Livre is worth 132 Ducats. All prices in the game are expressed in terms of Ducats (which, coincidentally, are also worth one dollar US (1992 period). A common unit of currency in the game is the kDucat (1,000 Ducats).\" Al [Nofi] and I really dissected the medieval economy, which was possible because they kept a lot of financial records during the period and used vellum (which does not rot) rather than paper.

"Letters now, just imagine how it would be with crude auctions at border marketplaces for foreign exchange and having to deal with all sorts of traveling moneychangers\"-p. 149). Also, Johnny Wilson insists that the file he downloaded only had definitions of characteristics (pages and pages of them) and nothing about how to raise or lower them. You didn't expect him to download more than one file did you? You think he has enough room on his cheap little hard drive for all your documentation?<grin> GOY Not So Polloi You gave Sid Meier the Game of the Year award again. It took guts to recognize brilliance. It would have been easy in the cigar smoke filled back rooms) to say, \"Well, we already gave this guy Game of the Year awards, let someone else have it for a change (spread it around so to speak).\" You didn't. My hat's off to you! Putting my hat back on, can't you make the awards ceremonies longer and more detailed? Also, announce the month before that the awards are coming. It's a big deal! Steve Gatewood Brownsville, TX What guts? Our readers would have destroyed Civilization as we know it if we hadn't. If you thought the L.A. riots were something, imagine what would have happened if we had denied Sid on this one. By the way, Sid also has the most titles of any designer in the CGW Hall of Fame. Duty Full Observation holds. A lot of that is transparent to the players, but the fact remains that mercenaries were expensive and there was no way of getting around it and still remaining historical. He also mentioned how long it took to do things. He mentioned this in the round table (forum) and other players were astounded that it took him so long. I played a large position in the alpha test (the Count of Armagnac) and had 16 fiefs to manage, plus I was running around with an army most of the time. I kept track of how long it took me to take care of business each day and it averaged 20-30 minutes. Not only that, but I was tinkering with my fiefs to test new routines and seducing every female in sight to test the pregnancy routines. He was told that he probably had a slow node and there was nothing the HYW crew could do about that. The game was designed to be cheap to play (at least, compared to the other on-line games). We only have a few players who are spending $100 per month and many who are spending less than $50. We have constantly tweaked the menus (and even added an \"expert\" mode) to cut down on time needed to do things. Ken was the only player to make a big stink about this and we never could figure out what his problem was. As for there being too much in the game, you don't expect grognards to come on-line and be happy with electronic Chutes and Ladders? The game is modular, you don't have to play every aspect of it in order to play. You don't even have to manage your fiefs (some players don't, but rather hire themselves out as hired swords or live off plunder). Some of the non-grognard types pay more attention to the social aspects of the game. Since email is free on GEnie, they spend most of their time in the gameÂ» at no charge by writing a lot of email. Even the round table can be very cheap if you download and reply to messages off-line (particularly, if using GEnie's Aladdin communications program). Johnny questioned the play balance in the game. The beta game has been going for over two months and neither side shows any sign of imminent victory. He mentioned the inattentive French king, but didn't mention that several of the major French nobles, in effect, deposed the king a few weeks into the game. In the beta game, the well-organized French are currently raiding and pillaging throughout England (using a historically accurate scheme I cannot divulge at the moment, as the English could make use of such information...). In another area, Johnny wondered why all his pillaging and storming fiefs did not increase his stature. The fact is, those two activities decrease stature. He didn't look at the Stature list to see those actions that will increase Stature (taking a keep through negotiation, winning pitched battles, etc.) The same thing is true about the use of many skills. The beta docs point out that not all skills are implemented yet, but the system for generating them is. About half the skills were live during beta and, every week or so, a new one would kick in and an announcement would be made. Other than the above, it was a nice review. James F. Dunnigan New York City, NY Would you believe we only said those things so we could list Jim Dunnigan as a contributor to CGW? The sneak preview (we try not to review games until they are fully implemented) was designed to let readers get a glimpse of a work in progress. If we waited to cover the game until it was finished, a lot of gamers would miss out on a fascinating experience. Note that Johnny Wilson also disagreed with St. Andre about the ducats during the latter portion of the article in question (\"If he thinks the game is complicated I am in the U.S. Army, stationed in Germany. If it wasn't for CGW, I wouldn't have a clue to what's going on in the gaming world. Thank you for being there for US so far away from home. Love those reviews and previews. Michael Davila 45th Med Co (AA) We think it's fair enough. You folks wear fatigues, these massive issues are giving us editorial fatigue. What's New in a CPU? I'm just a guy who reads your magazine and doesn't even own a computer. Could you tell me how to find out what would be the best computer investment for me. I need something that plays all the fantastic games in your magazine and, at the same time, can put up with those business programs nobody I know ever uses. Money is an object, but I might win the lottery. By the way, your magazine makes excellent written entertainment! Darin Kalpakoff Bellflower, CA We think it would be a mistake to get anything less than a 386 clone with, at least, a clock speed of 33 mhz. If possible, get a 486 clone with a faster speed. Get four megabytes of RAM and at least 100 MB on your hard disk. If you've never dealt with a C> prompt before, do yourself a favor and put Windows on the machine as your primary interface. If you're comfortable with the same DOS that you see on your friends' machines, go with DOS 5.0. Get a mouse, if you can afford it, and a sound card that is either Adlib or Soundblaster compatible. If you do win the lottery, throw in a CD-ROM, too. That's the basic game machine for today's games. Page 120 Computer Gaming World "

"Letters The Darker Half First, congratulations on Computer Gaming World's 100th issue. Your magazine is a continuing force in our industry and you all are to be commended. Next topic: THE HORROR-ible review of The Dark Half in your November issue. We greatly appreciate publicity from reviews of our products, respect the opinions expressed and try to learn from reviewers' remarks. However, in the case of Charles Ardai's review of our graphic adventure, The Dark Half, we believe he went too far in his criticism. We sent a beta version to you for pre-release analysis. The accompanying letter stated that it was only a beta version and that there were bugs in the program. Apparently, Mr. Ardai used this beta version in writing his article. Except for the \"double\" Thad in one screen, after the save/restore menu is used at the restaurant (which is being fixed), none of the bugs mentioned are in the master version of the program. Mr. Ardai spent an inordinate amount of space in his article citing bugs that do not exist in the final product. Of even greater concern is Mr. Ardai's complaint about the changes from the novel's storyline. Our license is for the Orion movie based upon Stephen King's novel so we were obligated to follow the Hollywood script. Yes, in retrospect, there are changes we would like to incorporate into The Dark Half, but as our first entry into the graphic adventure genre, we believe that we have delivered a solid game faithful to the King tradition. Isn't it also a tradition of die-hard King fans that they despise any adaptation of his work? Could this be at least a partial motivation for Mr. Ardai's scathing comments? Fortunately, there are lots of other King fans who have purchased the program and are enjoying it. We only hope that Mr. Ardai's zealous remarks will not discourage others from giving it a try. Angie Niehoff Director of Marketing, IntraCorp, Inc. Why, yes. It is a tradition of die-hard Stephen King fans to despise any adaptation of his work. It also seems to be a tradition of software publishers to object to any of Ardai's reviews (grin). Maybe the fact that Charles (as editor of the Great Tales of Madness and the Macabre anthology from Galahad Books) likes King well enough to have purchased the most non-King-like King short story ever should have disqualified him from writing this review. In all honesty, however, we thought his knowledge of King would provide a wonderful perspective from which to view The Dark Half. Of more concern to us, however, from your remarks is the fact that you believe that the review was based on a beta version. Unless the beta version came in a box with the actual shrink wrap on it, Charles did not review the beta. It is our policy to only sneak preview beta versions (in which case we give the benefit of the doubt to such bugs) and to review only released versions of the game. We are glad that there are people who are enjoying the game and realize that no everyone is the same type of literary purist that we consider Charles Ardai to be. Of course, what would one expect from a published fiction writer in both the science-fiction and mystery genres?

"Review SON ENT Channeling in Kulthea GEnie's GemStone III by Johnny L. Wilson Things are looking better in Kelfour's Landing considerably better. Even though the red dragon high atop lorak's Reach seems to be awakening from his Loul the Enchanter induced sleep; even though there are hints that indicate there may be a cult of dragon worshippers nearby: even though the unlife threatens to permeate the kingdom with undead once again; and even though the dwarven messenger has prophesied that there are only 13 days before \"THE END,\" things are looking better. In fact, things are looking better all over Kulthea since the last time I ventured there. Kulthea is the realm, the cyburb, that one visits on GEnie after typing \"m930\" or \"Gemstone\" from any prompt. The last time I entered Kulthea, I was filled to brim with high expectations. I had undergone a rigorous character creation (using the RoleMaster \"pen and paper\" method published by Iron Crown Enterprises) and created a bard character. I had tried to read the documentation as it scrolled down the screen (rather than cogently printing it out or copying it to disk for a later print out) and entered the realm. As CGW #79 (p. 53) recounts, I could not get shopkeepers to talk to me; I could not attract the attention of experienced adventurers to help me; I could not get the universe (i.e. the parser) to understand me; I could not examine items which were present in the rooms I explored; and I left with very atypical, but hostile feelings toward the game. I noted that the documentation was available, but pointed out that the \"meter\" was running while it was being downloaded and many gamers would not take the time to get into it. I suggested that they needed some kind of on-line help. It was a very frustrating commentary to write. Since I didn't really get into the game very much, I could not call the article a review, but I had promised readers and game designers alike that there would be an article on GemStone in that issue. I had heard of the marvelous bard contests, the special quests and the Infocom-style puzzles, but I was able to experience none of it. I knew there must be some good experiences there, because the room descriptions were the most well-written I had ever encountered in a text adventure. Still, good descriptions don't accomplish very much if one cannot get into the action. Fortunately, as good is occasionally born out of the bad and dawn regularly breaks forth from the dark, Simutronics (designers of the game) were frustrated about my experience (or lack thereof) and did some redesign. They urged me to return to the environs of Kulthea. Â«We heard you,\" they told me. I am glad that they did. This time, my sojourn in Kulthea was a rewarding experience. Oh, my character was simply along for the ride with a bunch of more powerful adventurers, but what a ride it was. First, by printing out the documentation, I discovered that I needed to type the command, \"Order,\" to bargain with the merchants. The command opened up an entirely new menu. Yet, what would have happened if I had acted as before and simply perused (rather than read) the documentation? An experienced character or one of the design team's NPCs would have come along and explained everything, even as I observed occurring with other novices on my very first foray into the land. Plus, I was approached, during a time when I was trying to get my bearings, by either a more experienced adventurer or a member of the design team in NPC guise. The character politely informed me that he could see I was exploring and hesitated to bother me, but if I needed any help, to type the \"Assist\" command. The \"Assist\" command is a wonderful addition to the command list which enables novice players to get a quick instruction about the parser or important locations. It is essentially an on-line hint service with a heart. I particularly liked the unobtrusive way I was informed about the command. That is the friendly touch of humanity I needed to feel during my first venture. On that last sojourn. I lamented the fact that I had created a bard character and could not find a place to perform. This time, I was matched to a master bard. After some preliminary training, he took me to a small tavern and showed me the \"Sing\" command. With that command, bards can type long verses with each phrase separated by a semicolon. For example: Sing She must have been pretty, her destiny starred,; Before her complexion was marred.; Here's a warning to orcs, trolls and kobolds and fiends,; To beware of fair Megan the Scarred. Then, the program will print out the verse to read: She must have been pretty, her destiny starred, Before her complexion was marred. Here's a warning to orcs, trolls and kobolds and fiends, To beware of fair Megan the Scarred. (For masochists, the full text of the song is printed in a sidebar within this article.) Another welcome sight I observed during this peregrination was that experienced characters were taking novice adventurers on training expeditions. One particularly important aspect of training was the explanation of Parry Tag.\" In the GemStone (RoleMaster) combat system, characters can rob Peter to pay Paul in order to modify either their offensive or defensive stances. As in many systems, characters are given combat bonuses based on attributes, superior weapons, skill ratings and magical enhancements. There are bonuses for offense (OB) and defense (DB) which are, in turn, affected by adverse conditions (e.g. being knocked down, stunned, or seriously injured). The nice touch is that gamers can set their Page 124 Computer Gaming World "

"Review puzzles are there and the possibilities for using one's skills are realistic. There is more to this on-line CRPG than combat. Indeed, I cannot wait for the next bard contest. I want to regale listeners with some of my exploits (I'm a bard. It's my job to have an ego!). GemStone III is available to all GEnie users and costs $6.00 per hour. It is one of the most popular games on the service and, at last, I know why. Cow Parry Percentage from 0% (absolutely no protection/berserk mode) to 100% (super cautious). In what the veterans call \"Parry Tag,\" an adventurer sets the Parry Percentage to 100% and ventures into a part of the forest where the vicious furred torkaans reside. When the torkaan tries to bite the character, usually failing because of the added defense). there is a time lag before the beastie can attack again (the game calls this round time). If the player adjusts his/her Parry Percentage to 0% and types ATT TOR (all commands can be abbreviated to their first three letters) fast enough (most experienced players create macros for combat commands), there is a good chance of stunning the torkaan before it can renew the attack. By bouncing between 100% and 0%, the player gets the best of all possible worlds. Thanks to Llorien, my master bard mentor, I was actually able to encounter some of the Infocom-style puzzles. One was a diabolical set of runes in which one served as a cipher and stone steps were raised or lowered according to a tricky little formula. Even Infocom veterans are liable to spend a while trying various systems with that one. Another was a variation on the original Zork's puzzle with the dam. This time, we needed the water from the dam to work the paddlewheel to power our conveyance. As lousy as I am at solving puzzles, I managed to solve this one ahead of my colleagues. Finally, we encountered the most unique variation on a maze. This time, the twisty little passages all looked alike, but they were filled with rushing water and swept us down the stream. We could lean forward, left, right or back to adjust speed and direction. It was the only time I've really enjoyed a maze puzzle, even though it took entirely too long for me to get through it. So, the upshot of my experience is that Gemstone III is no longer a \"Gem in the Rough\" as I called it in that earlier opinion column. If one can match up with the right parties (and Simutronics is making a spectacular effort to help gamers do so), the classic-style Megan the Scared She is light on her feet, on a path or the street, And she turns torkaans into minced meat. And karnelian blood she will turn into mud For she kills without missing a beat. Chorus: Oh, she must have been pretty, her destiny starred, Before her complexion was marred. Here's a warning to orrs, trolls and kpbolds and friends, To beware of fair Megan the Scarred. Though she handles her papier with delicate touch, She doth nun villains through in the clutch. And wien dragonts doth stoop, Megan serves dragont soup, For dealing with Megan's too much! Chorus: So, you see why I love her and I can't resist, Though I know I am taking a risk. If she found me unfaithful, she'd call me ungrateful And rip out my heart with her fist. Modified Chonis: Oh, she must have been pretty, her destiny starred, Before her complexion was marred. Here's a warning to orrs, trolls and suitors and friends To beware of fair Megan the Scarred. MABOARD) COMM.

"Announcing Computer Gaming World's T year's ballot. Remember you are judging the ad, not the game. Here are the rules. THE RULES elcome to the Fifth Annual Computer Gaming World Top Ad Awards. Every January we ask the most discerning gamers in the computer gaming world (i.e. our readers) to pick the best computer game ads. Last year's full page winner, Strategic Simulations (with their Eye of the Beholder II \"Bigger... Better... Meaner Than Ever\" ad) faces some tough competition. The undead cast from last year's ad were the first to record repeat victories in the CGW Top Ad awards. You see, those lovable undead fellows were featured in the prior year's winner as well. However, the competition this year is better, meaner, louder, funnier, more colorful and, in some cases, sexier than ever. All computer gamedom awaits to see what the readers of the premier computer game magazine declare to be the best ads in this year's contest. As always, we ask you to determine the best ads. On the CGW Poll post card is this vote for three different ads. These are ads which are less than a full page in size. 6. On the ballot, list the company names and page numbers of the ads you are voting for. For example: to place a first place vote for Acme Company's one-half page ad on page 345, write Â«Acme pg. 345\" on the line for first place in the fractional ad column. 7. The criteria for evaluation are very simple: consider the graphics, copy, and Overall impact of the ad. 1. Use the Ballot Section of this month's Reader Input Device card located opposite page 16, or a facsimile thereof, to cast your votes. 2. In the \"Full Page and Spreads\" category, vote for three different full-page and/or two-page spread ads. 3. A two-page spread ad would be an ad that appears on adjoining and facing leftand right-hand pages and is one continous advertisement. A two-page spread ad counts as a single ad for voting purposes. 4. Select a first place, a second place, and a third place ad. 5. In the \"Fractional Page\" category, 8. The votes will be weighted, added and then averaged. 9. The reader that comes closest to picking the final correct order of winners will win $250.00 cash and a lifetime subscription to Computer Gaming World. 10. Entries must be postmarked by February 1, 1993. No purchase is necessary. Winners will be notified by mail. cow Page 128 Computer Gaming World "

"Rumor Bag Rumbles Cheese The Artful Bagman 1 SOUP Jest by Andy Pollack I don't really think I look anything at all like a burglar, even with the bag on. Yet, it didn't matter where I waited in the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art, the ubiquitous security guards were watching my every move. I wanted to point at that empty space where the Matisse exhibit (that had been loaned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art) usually rested and tell them I wasn't responsible. They kept looking at me as though I were going to bag a Degas. I know my head is supposed to be big, but the bag still won't hold one of those ballet dancer paintings I've always wanted. I turned the corner and came face-to-face with one of the ugliest monstrosities I have ever seen. I mean, I don't understand these off-white canvases with one big black stripe on them. Give me Surrealism, Pointilism or Impressionism, but don't give me this. Of course, I could almost say the same thing about RAW Entertainment's upcoming experiment. It seems they are going to put out a platform-style arcade game on the Amiga, IBM and believe it or not) C-64. The game was probably named after the canvas I had just seen, Ugh! Anyway, that's the way that company is. Just when you think you've got them pegged, they try something else. Needless to say, the camouflage green smudge on the canvas next to it didn't offer much more encouragement. It did serve to provide a mental reminder that Steve Jackson Games' Awful Green Things From Outer Space is being converted into a computer game. It seems that QQP has retained a developer to program the conversion and it should come out sometime in '93. I know QQP is working to improve their graphics, but as I looked at yet another canvas I didn't appreciate, I sure hoped they weren't going to retain the artist responsible for that piece of art. Instead of hanging around in an alcove where I wasn't impressed, I walked over to where I was supposed to meet a source. I hoped she was going to tell me about Nintendo's new raster chip that fits right into the cartridge and makes it possible to do vector graphics, terraced shading and all that stuff you couldn't do on SNES before. Maybe she'd even tell me if Activision plans to use those chips in MechWarrior II. If I could take the action from the newest Battle Tech Centers and offer graphics significantly better than the ones in their upcoming MechWarrior, I could be in absolute heaven. As I was thinking, I stopped in front of the 30 soup can paintings by Andy Warhol and tried to figure out their significance. It was an incredible amount of work to be positioned in front of my unappreciative eyes. Then again, there were plenty of people who really liked his visual statement that common items could be elevated to art. Maybe that's why so many construction set products sold in the computer game world. Even though gamers might spend months of their lives creating scenarios that only a few friends would play, they got a chance to make their own personal statements. \"It's like SSI's Unlimited Adventures, the gold box construction set I had written about in an earlier column,\" I thought. \"They're giving gamers the chance to make masterpiece CRPGs from the heart.\" Then I was looking at another masterpiece. She was dressed in white like the protagonist in one of those gothic romances and that served to emphasize her ebony black eyes and rich, full lips. In fact, she looked a lot like a mature version of Winona Ryder and she mesmerized me just like a vampiress in Sony Imagesoft's new multimedia Dracula game, to be published for multimedia platforms. It's supposed to use actual footage from the Francis Ford Coppola film and I was anxious to see both. As usual, though, didn't expect to see the game until at least six months after the movie was to open. We greeted each other with our traditional kiss and she turned to look at the soup cans. \"So, how do I look?\" she asked with that breathless way she has of speaking out the side of her mouth. I told her that she looked like something out of a gothic novel and she said that was appropriate. She had wanted to tell me about Strategic Simulations, Inc.'s Veil of Darkness. It's a new CRPG from the makers of The Summoning. The player's character is a WWII pilot who gets shot down over the Transylvania Alps. Naturally. the character encounters some pretty strange creatures. \"Well,\" I countered, \"if they encounter anyone who looks like you, O undeath where is thy sting?\" She laughed graciously and I gave her the line about how she ought to be in pictures. \"Any particular ones?\" she asked. \"After all, I just saw some of the most beautiful Renoir portraits upstairs.\" \"He couldn't do you justice,\" I flattered, although I couldn't think of a time I had ever seen a Renoir without wondering how he had captured so much of the vivaciousness in every model's face, and I didn't mean you should be in paintings. I meant you should be in film.\" I told her that I had just visited the set where Activision was filming footage for Return to Zork and was very impressed. They hadn't cast Winona Ryder, but they had cast Jason Hervey (Wayne on \"The Wonder Years\"), Ernie Lively (Cooter from Â«Dukes of Hazzard\") and Robyn Lively (who appeared on \"Twin Peaks\") in the roles of troll, adventurer and fairy, respectively. \"You're so sweet!\" she responded. (Well, actually, she said that I was so full of something that started with the same sibbilant as what my meddling, censoring editor put into this column.) \"Actually, I wasn't quite sure where we should meet for this month's rumors,\" she told me. \"We could have met at the Natural History Museum and I could have told you about Sega's upcoming Jurassic Park title. It's supposed to be multimedia, but it's very hush-hush. We could even have met at the Air & Space Museum and talked about Microsoft's Flight Simulator 5. Of course, they haven't even announced either one of them and I don't have the faintest idea when to expect them to be released, but I knew you'd be interested. \"Interested?\" I shouted vigorously enough that two security guards immediately began to converge on our position, \"Why, I'd let you bite my neck for those kinds of rumors!\" \"Sorry,\" she laughed as the guards drew nearer, \"I'm afraid I'd get paper cuts.\" One of the guards asked us to keep our voices down and, as they departed, she giggled, \"You should have seen your face! I thought you were going to make like Tearaway Thomas and zip up those stairs faster than Sonic.\" \"Tearaway Thomas?\" I asked. \"Sure,\" she answered, \"It's from RAW Entertainment and it's like Accolade's SNES game, Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind or Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, only it's going to be on the Amiga. Then, she left me standing beside the soup cans as she began to glide up the stairs faster than, well, Sonic, Bubsy or Thomas. Was it something I said? Cow Page 130 Computer Gaming World "

"Editorial COMPUTER WARGAMING WORLD \"I Came, I Played, I Conquered\" Broadsides & Gripeshot SSG'S ROGER KEATING TELLS ALL! (well, some...) Interview by Alan Emrich CGW: Welcome to CGW, Roger. It's a long way from Sydney to here. We're all glad that you stopped by while you were sightseeing in Southern California. have their own graphics program, such as DPaint, to generate original ships, planes, etc. CGW: Naturally, the legion of CAW players want more information about taking the game to the Atlantic Ocean. Any plans for that in the future? Art by Rodger MacGowan; Copyright 1992 RK: It's always good to stop off at CGW. After spending the last six months working seven days a week on Carriers at War I thought I needed a break and what better place than here? HOMPUTER WARMAMITIA World In this issue... CGW: Right now, there's a great deal of excitement and anticipation about the Carriers at War Creation Kit. Can you tell us, specifically, what it will do? RK: We programmed the surface action module into CAW so that scenarios potentially could be created with only a few real carriers around. This would allow several of the North Atlantic battles to be represented within the CAW system. At the moment we are working on a number of North Atlantic scenarios although we will wait until we see the reaction to CAW before proceeding with the extension kit. CGW: When and where is the Macintosh version of CAW?

First, the data section allows you to enter all the fixed forces in the game such as ships, planes, carriers, etc. The second section allows you to type in the messages about the forces in the game. Each ship in Carriers carries with it a breakdown of its armament, complement and a brief history (mostly where it was sunk or when it was broken up). The last and, to me, the most interesting section is WarRoom, the place where the Al is added to a scenario. The intelligence for any scenario is carried in a kit which allows the shifting and changing of forces within the scenario data, and any number of various plans to go out and destroy the opponent. Two friends could design each side separately and then merge them to see which will win in a best out of 10 contest. All the graphics from the original game will be provided but the user will have to RK: When CAW was originally designed, I tried to keep the interface compatible with the Mac interface. During its development, I was given considerable advice as to changes that would make the conversion easier. It still surprised me when we discovered that the whole conversion project took about two months, considering the Warlords project that took about nine months. Our one compromise is that only a color version will be done. Most computer companies now have a policy of only producing color Mac games and the extra effort to support black and white would not be justified. CGW: Are there any plans to do a new version of Warlords in the future? Page 132 Computer Gaming World "


"Editorial RK: We have been working on an improved version of Warlords for about 12 months now and will be putting it into a final development cycle soon. All of the design work has been finished and only a few minor points have to be cleared up before we will announce the game and dates to the world. We expect to have it on sale next year but I do not want to be too specific, only to say that anyone who enjoyed Warlords will have to buy this program. operate. Due to the fact that a map may be random, a boat is now produced in cities and moved to the surrounding sea, but it is a warship only; it cannot be used for transporting armies. If you wish to transport armies you must go to a port (something similar to temples in the original game) and hire boats (the details here are still to be finalized) and each army will maintain their \"boat\" status until it reenters a land area. As each army is equipped with its own boat, it will be easy to break up stacks at sea for maximum flexibility, but using boats to ferry armies will not be allowed. CGW: What new features can we expect to see in this, the CGW Wargame of the Year for 1991? Will the revisions be minor, or is it a complete overhaul of the Warlords system? Roger Keating over and over again. This system is still in initial development, so don't expect to hear much about it till the middle of next year. RK: Originally we looked at setting the game in a completely different format but decided to go back to the basic Warlords look. There are many new features in Warlords II including random maps, diplomacy, and different hero/army structures, but anyone who has played the original game will quickly cope with these new features. I don't want to be more specific about these at the moment. Official statements from SSG will announce these soon. CGW: Okay, everyone has been asking about the 10-year-delayed Road to Appomatox Civil War game. Well...? CGW: What other wargame projects are pending at SSG? RK: Well, the project has never been abandoned! We did a lot of work on the game before we realized that we just did not have the necessary ability at that time to do it justice. We merely put that project on hold while proceeding to do others. It is still a topic that is very close to the people at SSG and, when possible, it will be resurrected. RK: At the moment, we are starting development on a new land based wargame, but have not defined the scale or area to be developed. After completing the WarRoom system for CAW, we would like to incorporate it into a land based design. One of the ideas I am currently working on is an intelligence system that learns from game to game even to the extent that the computer could learn the system by playing itself CGW: How about the navies? They were the weak link in the original Warlords game. Will you be doing something with the Al so that there will be naval campaigns? CGW: Unbelievable! Thanks, Roger.

"Review Iding on Succe The Red Baron Mission Builder B3827 by Doug Fick ynamix has released the first of their expansion disks for the Great Warplanes Series of flight simulators. Using the Red Baron program as the basic vehicle, the Red Baron Mission Builder (RBMB) adds a lot of chrome and accessories to what is already a hot-rodded simulation. hed What's \"Nieu\" Tired of shooting down the same aces in the same planes time after time? RBMB provides some relief to the dogfight blues with several new aces and five new aircraft. 'Nieu' for the allies are the nimble early war Nieuport 11 and the mediocre Nieuport 28 (which was outdated even before making its first combat appearance). The Germans can take to the skies in the (fragile Fokker DVIII, the excellent Siemens Shuckert DIII or the early-war Halberstadt DII. .DOS 15. By themselves, these new birds are a nice SAS VGA addition, but it is what can be done with all these aces and planes that makes RBMB really fly. As can be surmised by the program title, SYSTEM: PRICE: Red Baron Mission Builder allows one to DESIGNER: create unique air combat scenarios. In its PUBLISHER: original form, Red Baron gave quite a few options when selecting single missions â€” everything from dogfighting a single ace through busting balloons and on to taking a four ship formation against an enemy formation of four. Hmm, that number four keeps popping up and only one ace and one type of aircraft could be selected for any one mission. A lot of Red Baron fans asked Dynamix to open up the single mission options and RBMB is their response. To get a feel for what the RBMB is all about, I'll jump in and design a mission. When the Fly a Single Mission option is selected, two new choices appear: 'Build a Custom Mission' and 'Fly a Custom Mission.' The program does come with several custom missions included, but for now, I'll build. The build menu is very easy to use. With the mouse and just a few minutes of experimenting, the interface and options are easily mastered. Five different maps are user selectable and for my mission, I selected a hypothetical battle over the city of London. I'll be heading eastbound with my four planes, two SE5a's and two Sopwith Camels, at the tree-hugging altitude of 200 feet. To my northeast are two observation balloons that I've been assigned to protect. To my southeast, and set to intercept my flight, are two Fokker DRI's and two Albatross D5's led by the Red Baron himself. www o d ayam ROS TITLE: Red Baron Mission Builder IBM $29.95 Chris Shen, Damon Slye Sierra/Dynamix Oakhurst, CA Page 134 Computer Gaming World "

A little farther to the east and set to enter the fight about a minute after the first battle is joined are two more DRI's led by Carl Degelow.

Taking a look at the totals shows 11 aircraft, five types of aircraft. two balloons and three aces. I could elect to have every aircraft flown by an ace if I'd wanted. This whole mission took 20 minutes to build. If I want, I can add briefing text so when someone else plays the mission, they'll know what to expect and what they're tasked to do. These numbers are typical of the maximum levels the program will allow in any one mission.

"Review Locking Under by Johnny L. Wilson Srategie Simulations Erant Not Battles: North Atlantic 11939 ADVANCED SIMULATOR BERIES TITLE: GREAT NAVAL BATTLES ANOTHER SYSTEM: PRICE: PROTECTION: DEVELOPER: PUBLISHER: Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic 1939-43 IBM $69.95 None O Design Group Strategic Simulations, Inc. Sunnyvale, CA SEL T have spent my share of time 1939-43 crawling about on the floor with protractors and tape measures as we moved scale model ships about and rolled percentage dice to determine whether or not we had managed to \"hit\" our targets. I can remember purchasing said models and avidly reading about each ship in Jane's Fighting Ships in order to find strengths to exploit and weaknesses to avoid, as well as a sense of history regarding my ships. I remember the pain of placing an \"X\"in each box as the referee ruled that a shell had penetrated the armor of my ships. With fondness, I remember the times I was commanding a fleet and watched the gamers serving as my captains turn simultaneously out of \"Line Ahead\" formation or when one of my captains managed to \"cross the T\" on a larger ship (allowing both a better chance of hitting the target ship, while reducing the number of guns which the enemy could bring to bear on himself). As one can readily tell, tactical naval miniatures gaming has always been very satisfying to me. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as it used to be for me to be able to locate two fleets worth of captains. So, regular readers to CGW may remember how that I said that Simulations Canada's series of tactical level naval wargames (Long Lance, In Harm's Way and Grand Fleet) had something of the feel of naval miniatures, yet they did not have the tactile satisfaction of holding a model in my hand or the visual satisfaction of seeing two fleets spread out over a large floor space. RAW Entertainment's Action Stations offered a more realistic combat and command model, even down to the handling of damage control, but did not possess anything like the aesthetic appeal to be found in a miniatures battle. Some may note that I felt a certain amount of satisfaction in MicroProse's Silent Service II. I thought the digitized ship (i.e. target) images offered something of the visual thrill I had experienced in miniatures battles. Yet, I've never come as close, in a computer game, to experiencing that \"joy of miniatures\" as I have with Great Naval Batles: North Atlantic 1939-43 (GNBNA). Contemplating My Â«NavalÂ» GNBNA has managed to convey to this miniatures gamer something of the thrill of watching several ships maneuver in action. The tactical screen enables me to access and command each ship of my fleet, as well as to observe them engaging the enemy in much the same way as I used to observe my fellow-gamer captains in the Falls of the Ohio Wargame Society maneuvering their ships across a large floor. GNBNA allows the satisfaction of resolving large naval actions and allowing gamers to see the overall battle without having to gather human skippers. But that's not all! GNBNA offers a view in the gunnery station of each ship that allows the gamer to see the full deck and superstructure of that ship. The deck views of the ships are beautifully rendered (better than we ever painted our miniatures â€” some said we painted our ships, others called them \"primed\") as though they were colorized versions of those drawings we studied so intently in Jane's Fighting Ships. The best part, however, is that these deck views are animated so that the guns swing into full broadsides and there is a sequence where the barrels belch flame and smoke after they are fired. One has, in essence, the sense that the miniatures have come alive. Now, of course, any person can easily object that the perspectives from which the gamer is allowed to view the battles (on the tactical screen) and the actual broadsides of a given ship (at the gunnery station) are unrealistic. After all, no one (except, perhaps, a pilot flying overhead) is going to see the battles from these perspectives. Both fleet commanders and gunnery directors see a much more limited portion of the action. Yet, these are satisfying perspectives for those of us who like the aesthetics of miniatures along with the challenge of tactical wargaming. For those who are more concerned with a realistic portrayal of the target ships, GNBNA offers a satisfying aesthetic, as well. The target ships are depicted in a similar way to those in Silent Service II, but the resolution seems better and the animated explosions (and resulting smoke) are much more satisfying. I even liked the way that smoke was realistically used by the computer as a smokescreen in order to cover destroyer movements in some scenarios. Though some gamers would like to see more variety in the way the ships actually sink, it is clear that the overall presentation of the battles is superior to products which have come before. What's So Great? As a game, GNBNA is satisfying on many different levels. It has a nice variety of ships (with more on their way via add-on disks), Page 136 Computer Gaming World "

From the beginning we had wanted to give some from that reasoning, if one can control a battleship, there is nothing feel for the overall strategic situation of the German navy, but so CAUCAMIELE WESTLADIES LH:31 January 1993 Page 139 "


"Game Design long as the focus was on command of a single ship this could only by done by implication (ie., by setting up battle scenarios with \"typicalÂ» situations). Once the single-vehicle barrier was broken, however, it was easy to envision how to give the player control of the whole campaign. Or so it seemed. This aspect of the simulation proved the most challenging of all to develop. The simple reason was that this portion of the game had to be much more abstracted, partly because we didn't have the time or disk space to simulate the entire Atlantic Campaign in detail equal to our simulation of individual ships and, partly, because that much detail would have been more than everyone but the most 0 120 130 140 1501 1900 dedicated players would care to handle anyway. For both reasons, we had to choose carefully which aspects of the situation to give the player control over, which to handle automatically, and LUTZON 5020. YOS which to handle abstractly. In the end, we chose to keep the game tightly fo000 cused on the operations of major surface vessels, keeping other aspects of the naval campaign in the background. Thus, land-based air operations, both reconnaissance and airstrikes, are handled automatically, as are assignments of ships to patrol stations and convoy escorts. Submarines are abstracted completely since subs almost never cooperated directly with surface units, with attacks on major warships handled as random events. Land combat, too, happens in the background, conveyed via periodic news reports. We feel that this disciplined focus pays off in spades since it makes possible a clean, manageable game with plenty of strategic options and exciting tactical interludes. Problems in Miniature(s) While the strategic game posed many of the most serious challenges, it would be a mistaken impression to think that the tactical game posed none. The ships, in particular, posed two very different problems: how to represent them internally (as data structures and game elements, and how to represent them graphically when the player is aboard. On the first aspect, we started with the conventional wargame approach of treating the ship as a series of boxes, which get checked off as hits are sustained until all the boxes are gone or a \"critical hitÂ» occurs by chance. However, it quickly became apparent that this approach squanders the strengths of the computer (ie., its abil. ity to hold lots of data and manipulate it quickly). Therefore, we switched to a much more sophisticated conceptualization based on compartments, each of which represents an actual (albeit A OMSLCA abstracted) location in the ship. Some of the compartments contain portions of the ship's vital systems and critical hits\" can occur when one is penetrated by a shell. This penetration is not a random or arbitrary occurrence but, instead, is based on a careful calculation of the armor thickness of the bulkheads at the point of impact and the caliber of the shell. Additionally, if the shell's warhead does not go off, its path is tracked from compartment to compartment until it either explodes or passes through the ship. If it does explode, the effect of the blast is calculated on the compartment it is in and, where appropriate, on adjacent compartments as well. This conceptualization of the ship's compartments can be seen on WETTERE 00 ABBU TEE READY 00 MICROLEAGUE -ACTION SPORTS MICROLEAGUE ACTION SPORTS SOCCER MICROLEAGUE BASEBALL4.

"Game Design the game's Damage Screen. Here, players can even select an option that enables them to watch the progress of each shell as it penetrates a ship, if so desired. While the solution to the first problem of representing the ships came early and easily, the solution to the problem of graphical representation came relatively late. In fact, it came only after we completed the alpha version of the game (the software equivalent of a rough draft). The core problem was how to give a feeling of immediacy to the training and firing of the big guns when they were actually controlled by operators encased in heavy armor far removed from the turrets that housed them. The solution we hit upon was to partially abandon the first person perspective in favor of a \"bird's eye\" view. By combining on a single screen the \"out the window\" view generally associated with simulators with an overhead view more remiHAC DE niscent of table-top gaming, we realized we could have the best of both worlds. Now, one can look through the director at the target in the top portion of the screen while below seeing the turrets trained in the appropriate direction. Then â€” boom! â€” players can watch the blast of fire and smoke as the guns fire. It is Written... Another feature of Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic that was added around this same time was the historical section. We knew that SSI was interested in including some of the background 13000D WISHERITE 125 TERG information within the game itself (rather than just in the manual) and, when we happened to visit an archive overflowing with old photos, we knew we had struck gold. We digitized a slew of the pictures, matched them to the historical material we were preparing, and the result was the on-line historical information included in the program. We think that by deepening the player's knowledge of this era of naval warfare, it would add to their overall enjoyment of the game. The material that we uncovered in 119. 120. 150.140.150 creating this game was so rich, in fact, that it proved impossible to include everything we would have liked. In particular, we were intrigued by the many \"what-if\" possibilities in the situation, both on the strategic and the tactical levels. On the strategic level, we wondered how different the contest would have been if the Germans had SUNSET stuck to the \"Z-Plan,\" the strategy by which they were to delay hostilities until the mid-1940s in order to build up a fleet of massive warships. Tactically, there are a host of ships that could have fought but didn't, particularly if the hypothetical ships and the Americans are considered (an Iowa class battlewagon versus the Bismarck, for instance, is a fascinating duel). All of these possibilities, as well as a \"personal career\" role-playing game, are under development right now to be released as a series of Expansion Disks over the course of the coming year. Thus, we plan to keep Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic on people's hard drives indefinitely (or at least until we finish its full-blown successor).

"Replay Flattops Ho! A Carriers ad War Replay by Michael Peck Japanese player: Michael Peck American player: Carlos Gomez The following article is a replay of Carriers at War by Strategic Studies Group. The article describes a random Midway scenario in which the computer secretly chooses whether the scenario will follow the historical battle or whether the starting positions of the American ships will be changed. Prologue The early summer of 1942 was a glorious time for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Fresh from their attack upon Pearl Harbor and a naval blitzkrieg throughout the Pacific which succeeded beyond imagination, the Combined Fleet was eager to destroy the last remaining obstacle to Japanese naval supremacy the American carrier forces. AdFute Piay display Control miral Yama-moto's plan was to o send a strongly escorted invasion force to the island of Midway, forcing the U.S. Navy to commit the last of its outnumbered fleet to defending the vital outpost. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, deciphered Japanese codes had warned Admiral Nimitz that the Combined Fleet was sailing for Midway. The extra intelligence gave Nimitz an edge in surprise but could not make up for his lack in numbers. He had only three carriers one of which was still damaged from the recent Battle of the Coral Sea. This was pitted against four heavy and two light Japanese carriers, backed by an overwhelming battleship fleet. American plan was to stay out of range until the Japanese carriers had been sighted, then close in and attack in concert with Midway's airplanes. During the night, Admiral Spruance's carriers steamed to the northeast of Midway to put some distance between themselves and the approaching Japanese carrier-led armada. First contact came shortly after midnight (around 0100), when the Japanese submarine 1-166 attacked a task force near French Shoals, far to the south of Midway. Though the sub commander reported the group contained two carriers, its position made it likely it was a minor force whose size had merely been exaggerated. Commanders must expect to deal with a lot of inaccurate reports and try to find the kernel of truth which they might contain. Midway's planes were fueled and armed at night to be launched immediately the next morning. The stage was set for the curtain (and dawn) to rise... Dawn of Decision As dawn broke, the Japanese were quickly spotted by Midway's search planes. With Nagumo's force about 200 miles southwest of Midway, the Japanese elected to launch a coordinated strike from all four carriers (which takes longer to launch, but has a more devastating effect on the target and preserves the attacker's forces). The all-or-nothing nature of carrier warfare discouraged keeping a reserve, and it seemed more important to the Japanese commander to concentrate on immediately destroying Midway's aerial threat. Meanwhile, part of Midway's planes were launched at the Japanese carriers, while the remainder flew to Pearl to sit out the initial enemy blows which the Yanks rightly expected would come. As the veteran Japanese air crews launched into the rays of the rising sun, inspired by the significance of the sight, their commander shuddered when he realized with horror that he had forgotten to strengthen the Combat Air Patrol (CAP) over his carriers. Lacking radar, Japanese task forces required stronger standing CAP than their American counterparts. But it was too late Advance to Contact (P.M. June 3, 1942) As the battle commenced on the night of June 3, the Japanese fleet was split into several task forces scattered to the west and northwest of Midway. The Japanese plan was to bomb the Midway airfield into dust and then destroy the American fleet by exploiting the greater range of their carrier-based aircraft. (Ed: A masterpiece of simplicity in military planning. I A few hundred miles away, the American fleet waited south of Midway (Ed: Historically, they were deployed to the north).

"Replay 23:00 Jun 6 1942 L AMA. F RANCUTECE carrier, so the best and only defense is to get the enemy flattops first. The worst thing for a carrier is to be hit while its planes are being armed and fueled, so it may be better to launch a strike too soon rather than too late. A major Japanese advantage in CAW is that their carrier-based planes have a much longer range as much as 100-miles â€” than their American counterparts. A hunHileliau UDA contrai dred miles may not sound like much, but for a 25-knot American carrier, it means steaming for four hours within enemy air range without being able to reply to hostile action. Worse, the American Wildcat fighter's range is so poor (170 miles each way) that the Americans are better off keeping all their fighters on CAP and letting the bombers fend for themselves. The second lesson is to keep a strong CAP screen up. This is particularly true for the Japanese, whose lack of radar means less warning time. Also, Japanese carriers are more prone to damage and less likely to self-repair than their American counterparts. Although escorting friendly bombers is important, it's more important to keep an adequate screen; if one's bombers are on the way towards the enemy, count on an enemy strike heading back to counterstrike. A third lesson is that carriers are often sitting ducks. When they have launched planes or have transferred them to land bases, they cannot move out of the local area until the planes return. Given that four or five hours might elapse before an air wing returns from a strike, players must consider where the enemy will be later in the day, or even if the targets will be in range once the planes arrive. This is compounded by CAW's limited intelligence system. Put simply, most search reports are erroneous in the numbers and types of ships they report. A task force that previously had two cruisers ---..--. and three destroyers can abruptly mutate into a reported force of carriers and battleships. Nor are pilots able to distinguish well between seaplane carriers and aircraft carriers. The only way to increase cer2 SHAPE tainty is to wait 15 or 20 minutes for LO PIA as several consistent reports to conne UP firm the sighting. Finally, the weaker side should beware of surface combat. Surface GIUS I Ships combat might seem easy to avoid PEPE but it happens with surprising freOPUP'E quency. A 300 mile gap at dusk between a friendly carrier group and enemy battleships may seem vast, but when ships are steaming at 30 knots and darkness lasts 10 hours.... Worse, both sides normally lose contact with each other at night, so fleets could be steaming towards each other and not know it until the disconcerting sights and sounds of gun flashes erupt. Carriers At War requires players to focus on only a few key decisions which must be made regarding movement and combat â€” particularly as to their timing. Yet, battles will rest upon these plainly obvious choices and victory will to go the admiral who makes the best prediction as to his enemy's intent.

"Review No 25 AIRSO 26 sthitiliated STTHE ABC ON LOCK standard by which all future products are judged. The 230-page manual is scattershot and, at times, seems to serve merely to pad out the copy protection scheme. There is a totally useless bomber identification chapter. The section on German fighters omits an important type, the Bf-110, that is abundant in the skies of the game. A player unfamiliar with German craft of the era may think he has come up against a huge German trove of captured De Havilland Mosquitos â€” the only small, two-engine craft identified in the booklet. As is common these days, there are discussions of features in the manual that did not 300 make the final cut. Two are acknowledged in the READ.ME file. For example, a player can no longer let the computer land the plane. Apparently, allowing this meant that the human player might be able to go through an entire flight without putting his/her mitts on the aircraft controls. The change is a pedantic one. Landing correctly, as in most other flight simulators, is a tedious and pain-staking process. Here, the player can, at least, choose an easy landing mode, in which putting the plane down becomes a kind of horseshoes-and-hand-grenades affair (close is good enough). However, this reduces the rewards for the mission, such as they are. Those rewards, of course, consist of medals and promotions for the crew, and the knowledge that the human player is one step closer to a 25-mission goal. There are no numerical ratings or measures in the game. It is a worthy notion and a tip of the hat to simulated realism, but may not be gratifying enough to the average, possibly more number-oriented computer bomber jockey. More pertinent to the theme of the game, however, is the problem of fighting fires inside the aircraft, or lack thereof. Described in the manual, this occurrence has been summarily excised from the final design. Additionally, problems with the crew oxygen and heating systems, also mentioned in the manual, never arise (or didn't, in the nearly fifty missions flown by this reviewer.). Lastminute changes are understandable, but this book shows much that might have been. One yearns for the game that the inaccurate manual hangs teasingly before the player's nose rather than the WO 2007 limited one which was actually published. Career Decisions The most important deficiency is the inflexibility of the campaign game. A campaign consists of following one bomber crew from 1 NOVEMBER 1943 until they are either killed, captured or fly 25 missions. There are no collateral crews to follow and there is no skipping ahead. That is, if a player wants to start a new crew, that crew travels mysteriously back in time to 1 NOVEMBER '43, even though the player will be working from the same \"campaign\" file that contains a bomber that has flown missions. If the player dares to set up more than one bomber at a time, strange things happen when the file is saved, and then, loaded later â€” like the loss of entire bombers, along with their accumulated missions. Again, the documentation is not forthcoming on this facet of the program. Perhaps too much was read into line on page 38 that states there are \"six Flying Fortresses available to your squadron.\" Perhaps it was just wishful thinking.

Now, picture that wizard mixing together the arcane ingredients required to make powerful magic; not the commonplace conjuror's confectionery like eye of newt or lizard's tongue (rescuing some helpless princess won't bring this story to a happy ending). No, this is a great wizard pulling out all the stops for the mighty task ahead â€” bowel of ogre and a necklace of dragon's teeth will be required for him to teleport entire armies and cast fireballs the size of meteors onto his foes. After all, there are kingdoms to conquer this time! Powerful magic, like powerful games, usually requires the blending of strong, proven elements in order to get the results which will become the stuff of legend. No one knows this better than one of the hobby's newest game wizards, Bruce Williams Zaccagnino. While he might look a bit comical wearing a pointy hat bearing a crescent moon (but then, who wouldn't?), the magic in the games his company, QQP, has released to date tells an undeniable success story. Bruce has had his hand in the cauldron as each of his games has stewed to perfection, and now his latest conjuration is ready to once again enchant strategy gamers. Brain of Admiral & Brawn of General Within the ever-improving graphic look of the QQP game box (be sure to look for the tiny giraffe hidden in the cover art of Conquered Kingdoms), a fine set of standard QQP game components resides. Players familiar with The Lost Admiral or The Perfect General will recognize the black and white manual and attractive color battle map cards. More importantly, veteran strategy gamers will quickly decipher the gaming ingredients which were sprinkled into Conquered Kingdoms. Personally, it appears to me to be three parts Lost Admiral, two parts The Perfect General and a pleasant dash of SSG's Warlords thrown in for atmosphere. Describing how all these elements have been combined, of course, will be this gourmet gamer's delicious task. Naturally, having many flavored ingredients does not a delicacy make. Faithfully assisting Bruce Williams is his programming sidekick extraordinaire, Thurston Searfoss, whom many will remember as the programmer behind The Lost Admiral and its challenging levels of computer opponent skill. Fortunately for strategy gamers, the team of Bruce & Thurston is at it again, doing what they do best. Put Out The Cascatia In Conquered Kingdoms, players fight battles over one of eight different, finely-crafted game maps. Varying in size and complexity of terrain, through repeated play one will become familiar with many of their nuances and see that each was carefully designed to prohibit \"perfect plans\" from emerging. There are multiple ways to siege and sally across each one and, to add to the need to do so, every new game finds the game's crucial resources gold, coal and wood â€” randomly scattered across the map. Thus, opting to fight from a favored position on, say, map #2, might leave a player at an economic disadvantage. Successful Conquered Kingdoms players will have to maintain skills and flexibility rather than Page 154 Computer Gaming World "


"Sneak Preview relying on set, \"perfect plans.\" To further add to the adventure, there is even a random map scenario where anything can happen! Topping off all this variety are the varying ways to adjust the game set-up options: single city starts, normal two to three city starts, etc. Basically, one is never playing the same game twice, even though it might be on a familiar map. Besides the economic objectives and a wide variety of terrain types (oceans, rivers and bridges), the two key objectives are cities and castles. Cities, naturally, are straight point generators, as in The Perfect General. They must be garrisoned and the points flow in every turn that they remain under unchallenged control. Gargale Gangolgets Dragons T EST Luengo PS4883 OROSH HETE Perfect General). For example, spies can assassinate officers with considerable ease, but are themselves quite vulnerable if caught (fortunately, they have a sighting range twice that of other units and can only themselves be seen if the enemy happens to blunder into their exact square). Likewise, the antidote to enemy cavalry is friendly lancers; enemy lancers are best dealt with by friendly swordsmen; enemy archers by friendly gargoyles; enemy gargoyles by friendly catapults, and on and on In other words, no piece is invincible or singularly decisive. There is an antidote for every problem and keeping a combined arms force is invariably a key to victory. Combining the right blend of exotic abilities is another important element of success in playing Conquered Kingdoms. Having spies scout out enemy strength, phantoms amidst friendly forces to scare enemies within three space to doing only one half damage, trolls as front line fodder to blunt enemy cavalry and regenerate four (of their 16 maximum) hit points back per turn, catapults and archers for missile support from the rear, ships and rogs for amphibious support or gargoyles, and dragons for air support can all be decisive \"combined arms\" elements in every battle. There are many ways to fight and win each battle with such a wide variety of pieces to choose from and much of the replayability comes from this very delicious diversity of combat units. Thus, the most routine element in the game has been made one of the most intriguing. Conquered Campaigns While the game maps use the hex-brick pattern found in The Lost Admiral (where each space has a stacking limit of two units), this hexagon pattern is also found on the eight different campaign game maps. These are the Cascatia campaigns which can range from a reasonably short number of games that are required to win the campaign, to outright epics. Each area on the campaign map has two pieces of information on it. The first character indicates which battle map is used when fighting for that area (numbered one to eight or \"R\" for a random selection. The second character denotes what special bonus is afforded the owner of that area in future battles (\"D\"ragons, \"Wizards, \"$\" for gold and \"#\" for additional officers). COTOON MA Castles, too, produce points (in geometrically increasing amounts as one acquires more of them â€” similar to owning multiple railroads in Monopoly). More importantly, however, castles are one's recruitment centers. Newly produced units (which all take two turns to arrive) are placed in friendly controlled castles. Finally, castles are tough nuts to crack. There are a variety of ways to try to capture them, but none are particularly easy and each requires a fairly powerful force to attempt their liberation while an enemy resides there. At the end of a prescribed number of turns (game length may vary by player selection of either the short, normal or long play game option), both player's points are compared, modified for game length, and then displayed in terms of \"notches.\" These notches will adjust a player's rank, which begins at \"seri\" and rises through \"marquis,\" \"duke,\" and so on. Naturally, in the best QQP traditions, map scores, player scores, averages, and such, are all stored so that one can reference them later. A player's legacy in the land of Cascatia will continue as long as the game remains on his or her hard drive (which, in the case of Conquered Kingdoms, could be a very long time). N auary Prum. 40 sa UPS E22832 DUT Fantasy Chess comiat! The pieces used in the game give it the same distinctive boardgame-on-a-computer feel that the three games Conquered Kingdom emulates happen to possess. Players may opt to use either of two sets of pieces, normal or advanced. The normal set includes all of the various human army units, including: swordsmen, lancers, knights, cavalry, archers, catapults, ships, spies and officers (the latter only being available when playing a campaign game). The advanced set adds gargoyles, trolls, ogres, rogs, phantoms, wizards and dragons (the latter two being the much dreaded \"heavy\" units in the game). In the tradition of The Lost Admiral, each unit has almost a Scissors-Rock-Paper combat quality against certain other pieces, particularly when playing with fixed combat results (as opposed to random â€” an excellent choice of features borrowed from The A campaign is decided by either conquering a certain number of areas on the campaign map or by capturing all of the thrones\" hidden upon it. A player begins with a single area and selects an adjacent region upon which to fight the first battle. When that game is over, the winner receives a new fief on the campaign map with additional ones awarded for achieving more decisive victories. Basically, this system works fine between two balanced players, but once things start to snowball between less evenly matched opponents. A campaign could really go downhill fast!

A Department or the V le W of additional external fuel tanks. AH-64s in the Gulf War used this configuration extensively. ince my initial review of Gunship 2000 appeared in the December 1991 issue, MicroProse has released several revisions and patches for the game. The most significant of these releases is the new Islands and Ice Scenario Disk (1&/), which contains all of the previously released patches and much more. This review focuses on the effects of upgrading the initial release of Gunship 2000 (Version 2) with the new scenario disk.

The excellent documentation explains the new features and provides detailed histories about the new theatres. After a disk swap or two, and perhaps changing some settings to take advantage of the new hardware options, the player is ready to enjoy the following new features: Owners of Soundblaster and ATI Stereo cards will be pleased to know that I&I acknowledges their hardware. A glitch I encountered with my ProAudio Spectrum in the Version 6 upgrade has apparently been eliminated in 1&l. While the sounds presented with the different cards are still, in my opinion, anemic, at least a broader base of hardware owners can enjoy them. Of course, I am used to hearing sounds in a specific decibel range when it comes to this aircraft. I don't know if other gamers would consider the sounds anemic or not. a two-joystick control option. I&T provides this and much more. Additional control choices include joystick emulation for the keyboard, foot-pedals and the popular Thrustmaster control system. (Designer Jim Day advised me that there have been hardware conflicts when using the Thrustmaster and Soundblaster together.) These new control options take some getting used to, but significantly reduce the player's workload and increase the enjoyment of the game. ET More Fuel With most combat helicopters having a two hour endurance on internal fuel, I was irritated to find the helicopters in Version 2 running dry after a mere 30 minutes of game time. I&I provides more endurance, which helps, but still not nearly enough. If the designers insist on leaving the internal fuel endurance at its current level, then players should be allowed to equip the helicopters with the \"Zippo\" configuration Improved Flight Model Perhaps the most offensive fault of Version 2 was the atrocious flight model the player was forced to deal with. A smoother and more flyable model was fortunately incorporated into I&I. I'm sorry to say that the aerobatic capabilities of a combat helicopter are still missing, making air-to-air engagements trying at times. Nonetheless, the improvement over the original GS2000 is pronounced. Land More Control Options While evaluating Version 2, I longed for Page 162 Computer Gaming World "

"Review OPO own army, it is necessary to click on an entirely different screen. When numerous battles are taking place and the clock is running, this is not necessarily a costeffective option. Plot Twists One of the most interesting elements of the game is the addition of logistics. Pieces exhaust energy and health through movement and combat. Many pieces are capable of missile fire and may run out of ammunition. Pieces can only be eliminated when they are out of both health and energy. Keeping one's army healthy and armed is, therefore, one of the primary keys to victory. Logistics are different for each set, but can make the difference between winning and losing in each. For instance, in the Ancient set, the catapult unit can destroy any enemy unit on the board at (relatively) long range. However, it loses energy with each shot and too many consecutive shots will result in it becoming immobile and highly vulnerable. Since damage is never permanent, logistics emphasize the need to keep one's army intact, fighting limited engagements and retreating units when they have become weakened. The use of realtime, however, reduces the decision making role of the player. There are simply too many things happening at once to effectively control the flow of battle. The game is set out in such a way that operational planning requires one to establish a battle plan and organize one's forces based on this plan. Once battle is joined, there is little that one can do to alter the overall nature of the melee, at least until the initial uproar has died down. In one sense this is more realistic than most wargames, since they usually allow unlikely levels of micromanagment, but in another sense, it is less enjoyable to play. A Predictable Ending By far the most critical weakness of this program is its artificial intelligence. Simply put, the game is much too easy to win. If scenarios are going to be only 30 minutes long, they have to be challenging or at least have serious replay value. Neither is evident here. For each set of pieces a few experimental games should reveal the most effective deployment WERP strategy. Once this has been determined, the scenarios become both easy and repetitious. Furthermore, a generic strategy for each set of pieces is effective regardless of the scenario. For instance, using the Great War set, the most effective strategy revolves around the use of missile units. While the computer opponent advances, I deploy my machine guns and cannon so as to have clear lines of fire and to be easily supplied. Then, all of them are set on auto-fire and the rest of my army is held in reserve. The enemy attack is usually broken up by massed fire before it can mount an effective counter-attack. Compounded with the fact that the computer does not make effective use of its missile units in any of the scenarios, this means that all of the Great War scenarios can be fought and won in a single evening. One note when using missile units. For some reason, when missiles are fired over the heads of friendly units those units suffer damage. Therefore, it is important to leave missile units up front, and to stop firing ifenemy forces get behind the firing line. When using the Modern set, this can lead to some innovative tactics. Because of the speed of aircraft and the slow rate of fire of missile units, a clever player can cause enemy units on auto-fire to shoot at their own pieces. This is done by flying over squares onto which the enemy is advancing. Enemy missile units will fire at the aircraft when it is in the square. However, unless the aircraft lands, it will not be in the square when the missile arrives. Instead, advancing enemy forces will take the hits. In the process of adding so many options to the game of chess, the designers have inadvertently removed the element of chess that makes it so attractive to so many people a variety of structured strategic approaches. This game represents the triumph of style over substance. It looks impressive and, with a few minor quirks, the interface is effective.

"Review TII Falcon 3.0 to done before the line OOOOO DEE < Soecilam Vespe dion'fio Mareer oo Basham TITLE: SYSTEM: #PLAYERS: ELECTRONIC BATTLEFIELD SERIES' CAMPAIGN DISK FALCON30 PRICE: PROTECTION: DESIGNER: PUBLISHER: Operation Fighting Tiger IBM Supports dired connect, modem and network play $39.95 None Gilman Louie Spectrum HoloByte Alameda, CA OPERATION: FIGHTING TIGER ATWRATES pectrum HoloByte's latest addition to the Falcon family, the Operation: Fighting Tiger add-on package (also called Falcon 3.01), is composed of two major components: bug fixes and new features. Regardless of which version of Falcon 3.0 one currently owns, Operation Fighting Tiger will upgrade it to version 3.01. At the time of this writing, Spectrum HoloByte has released one patch to Operation: Fighting Tiger, entitled version 3.01.1. This patch is free, and can be obtained directly from Spectrum HoloByte. Despite the introduction of such an odd numbering scheme, Operation: Fighting Tiger and its associated patch hold many nice surprises for Falcon 3.0 pilots. Unfortunately, Operation: Fighting Tiger has many incompatibilities with prior versions; any campaigns one has in progress will be wiped out, and one will need upgrades to the user-made utilities, Falconr and F3maps. Originally, Spectrum HoloByte stated that the bug fix portion of Operation: Fighting Tiger version 3.01 would be made available as a free upgrade to registered owners. This patch, entitled Falcon 3.0e, would not introduce the new campaign theaters and features of Operation: Fighting Tiger. However, immediately after the release of Operation: Fighting TiFurthermore, the Operation: Fighting Tiger 3.01.1 communications mode is compatible with version 3.0d, provided that the player with 3.0d originates the call. During a several hour, direct-connect, allied play session several glitches were encountered and both the calling and answering machine experienced an occasional lockup. Overall, the allied play was highly successful. Be warned however, due to the large amount of data being transmitted, 2400 baud is the minimum usable data transmission rate. Below 2400, screen updates are simply too slow. Users at 2400 baud will want to reduce the graphics detail levels to the Medium setting to ensure playability. Despite the problems, Falcon 3.01. 1 has what this reviewer considers to be the best multi-player flight system currently available for the IBM. Campaign debriefings have been overhauled, but still fail to be reliable, unfortunately. The briefing is much more informative, giving detailed stats on kills, Spectrum HoloByte. ORADALOZITETIT Bug Killer In the category of bug fixes, Operation: Fighting Tiger version 3.01.1 corrects the majority of problems associated with landings that remained in version 3.0d. For example, the ILS system now has two modes of operation: the previously incorrect \"beacon\" mode, and a new, correct, \"directional mode. Beacon mode ILS still operates incorrectly, simply directing the pilot toward base, while the new directional mode ILS actually aligns the pilot with the runway like an ILS should. Also corrected is the extremely annoying forward view shift whenever the ILS is engaged or the gear is lowered. By default, the view shift still occurs, but users may disable it. Finally, VASI approach lights have been added to runways in new theaters, but not to runways in the original three theaters. Communications mode has been vastly improved. While some instabilities still exist, direct serial port connections and modem-to-modem play is highly reliable. After several hours of modem-to-modem play, no lockups have been encountered. ger, Spectrum HoloByte announced that it would take at least 30 days to generate version 3.0e. At the time of this writing, Spectrum HoloByte has made no further indication of when version 3.0e will be released. friendly pilots and aircraft survival information, but is often inaccurate. It is not uncommon for the debriefing to report more F-16s were shot down on the mission than were present. Kill stats are often inPage 170 Computer Gaming World "

All three theaters place the United States in the \"limited warfare\" role, with only a handful of units in the region to fulfill political promises. Between these theaters, both friendly and enemy forces are equipped many new weapons, aircraft, ground forces and ships. By far, the most interesting theater is the Kurile Islands, where the player must take a single squadron and support Japanese troops on the islands which are under assault by the Russian Fleet. A new, upgraded F-16 called the FSX is available in the Kurile Islands scenario. Although it does have improved performance, most pilots will probably find the improvements negligible during combat. However, with the FSX comes many new weapons, including improved AIM-120 missiles, the AIM-9R Sidewinder and the AGM-86 Harpoon anti-ship missile. These new weapons and platforms, however, do not make the Kurile Islands an easy place to fight. The player is equipped with only a single 18-plane squadron and ordered to protect Japanese forces in the Kurile Islands against a formidable Russian naval task force led by the aircraft carrier, Admiral of the Fleet Kuznetsov. To further complicate matters, the player's squadron is not permitted to start a war between the US and Russia. Instead, strict rules of engagement (ROE) prohibit the player from firing on targets in many circumstances. Violating ROE can result in escalated levels of conflict and/or the court martial of the offending pilot. Based on the ability scores, computer pilots (both friendly and enemy) can occasionally lose their nerve, and either run for home or open fire and violate ROE. This sets the stage for some very intense air combat where the participants are constantly jockeying for position, waiting for the enemy to run for home. Version 3.01.1 greatly improves sound support. Although some glitches still exist for IBM speaker users, anyone equipped with a soundboard will be greatly pleased with the new performance. Many new digitized voices have been added, vocalizing the text of old messages as well as announcing new messages.

"Review been fixed. The auto-range function is still present (this is an actual feature of the APG-66 radar), but no longer resets the elevation scans. Also, ACM mode now has two user-selectable scan patterns for different combat situations. The dusk missions at 1900 hours have FOSCA mation regarding bandits, and the Hi-Fidelity flight model is still unflyable when the aircraft is loaded over 30,000 pounds. G-limits are not enforced when the aircraft is heavily laden (pulling 9G with 30,000 pounds of ordnance on the wings would rip them off). Most notably, no flight path information is provided for other friendly aircraft in the area, not even for aircraft the player is assigned to escort. Overall, despite the weaknesses Operation: Fighting Tiger makes Falcon 3.0 a stable, reliable platform, correcting most technical problems and adding new challenges. Based on technology available in Falcon 3.0, the features available, and the RBS mixes such complex digitized phrases during real-time combat. Campaign mode has received some attention, also. First, users now have three choices of campaign difficulty level (at easier levels, enemy units receive fewer supplies at longer intervals, limiting their offensive potential). Many new types of missions have been added, especially in the Kurile Islands theater, such as suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) and anti-shipping strikes. Falcon pilots should be warned that the Russian fleet has heavy surface-to-air defenses, and attacking the Russian warships will usually result in heavy allied casualties. The High Fidelity Radar (HFR) has also been modified. The problem with radar locks being broken when the auto-ranging function resets the elevation scans has been removed and replaced with night missions at 2100 hours. The night missions use a very nice dark palette, rendering most objects invisible except at extremely close ranges. Pilots are forced to rely on their HUD and their instrumentation to fly and fight. Termite Inspection Operation: Fighting Tiger does still have some serious flaws, though. The AWACS still do not provide useful inforgeneral user-interface, Operation: Fighting Tiger earns a high commendation on its performance review.

"Hardware Review Homegrown Flight Simulation Enhancements Brad Bowman by Mike Â«Moondawg\" Weksler Yurrently, entertainment software companies are hard at work pushing the envelope for state-of-the-art flight simulation software. The following, however, represents what is being done by an elite few in their garages and basements during their spare time. They represent the vanguard of flight simulation enthusiasts and the genre as a whole will benefit from their endeavors. Jeff Heeszel sitting in the nearly completed Hellseat 2000. Home Cockpit: The Hellseat 2000 Recently, out of the clear blue sky, we received a communication from Jeff Heeszel which described an inexpensive home-built cockpit for flight simulations. This is, by far, the most significant attempt (as the accompanying photos disclose) at a realistic fighter cockpit that we've seen. Not just a cheezy car seat setup, the Hellseat 2000, as Jeff refers to it, is based on the plans for a 1/12th scale model kit of the F-16 cockpit and ACES II ejection seat (manufactured by AMT). On either panel, one can see the Thrustmaster equipment mounted at a forward angle of 30 degrees for comfort. The rudder pedals, seen in the accompanying photographs, are entirely of Jeff's design. The sound system Jeff has installed is thundrous, consisting of a 12\" kicker woofer, a base speaker (installed in the lumbar portion of the seat), and a boombox for the mids and highs. To quote Jeff, \"Sitting in this thing with the bass pounding you in the back as you fire your cannons cannot be described!\" With a sound rig like that, Jeff's roof probably raises a few inches and blasts the entire neighborhood with air combat sounds and explosions. I can't help but wonder how well it would play Metallica or Guns 'n Roses <grin>. One key fires up the rig with all its peripheral equipment, using a sophiscated array of timers, sequencers and latching relays. The panels light up and provide switches and sound amp controls. The materials, in addition to the sound equipment and other electronics, merely consist of a good deal of plywood and over 1,000 1.5\" screws. As for the cost, Jeff sums it up best: \"For the basic cockpit, maybe $45 in lumber. Paint, $25 or so. The Kicker woofer, $125. The bass amp was purchased at a garage sale for $40 and I had the other amp as a boombox with detachable speakers. It is most costly in manpower to build, which is free, but might cost a few sixpacks to get your buddies to help you.\" For more information regarding the Hellseat 2000, contact: Jeff Heeszel 5946 W. Feemster Ct. Visalia, CA 93277 Steve Edwards' HOTAS, The Next Generation Joystick Controller Of the more innovative products I've had the privilege to try out here at the CGW Labs, Steve Edwards' and Ralph Robinson's HOTAS (Hands-on Throttle and Stick) system seems to be the most promising. It is a system of hardware and software that allows one to use multiple analog joysticks and controllers. It is unique in that one may program any button to perform any function in a given simulation. Additionally, the analog devices may be programmed to reproduce keypresses in other words, one can program an analog joystick to return keyboard values to control an aircraft in simulations which do not allow for analog joystick control. I received a HOTAS prototype system in an alpha state. That is, it was very rough, had no Graphical User Interface for software, featured no cases for the hardware and arrived with almost no documentation. Even so, it was impressive! At the heart of the system is the proprietary controller card. The keyboard plugs into it, and then another connector runs from the card to the keyboard input on the motherboard. The joystick connector (attached by ribbon connector to the controller card) has connectors for the provided modified Thrustmaster Weapons Control System (throttle), the modified Thrustmaster Flight Control System (joystick), and even a rewired video game controller which was included as an additional device for more optional buttons. Two more connectors would allow for rudder pedals and another joystick. One can select the Thrustmaster FCS as joystick #1, the throttle on the Thrustmaster WCS as the Y axis of joystick #2, and the rudder pedals as the X axis of joystick #2 (joystick mapping), and still have extra connectors for more buttons or another joystick. To accomplish this, the HOTAS system has eight analog channels allowing the user up to four joysticks, rudder pedals and up to 40 buttons! While Ralph was the hardware virtuoso who actually built the system, Steve (known online as \"Auger\") performed the software wizardry. Button mapping is accomplished with the HOTAS programming language and events may be triggered based on button pressing and button releasing. Once functions are defined, the following actions may be assigned: key press, key release, delay, and flag setting, allowing for an almost limitless combination of keyboard commands. The most notable feature of the HOTAS Page 174 Computer Gaming World "

Using a traditional Tarot deck (from which users select cards by using their mouse as a Ouija-like device), it offers prophetically vague advice on the question of one's choice. The graphic presentation of the cards and their detailed explanations really steal the show. For those who know there is magic in 3s, one is pleasantly rewarded with three different computerized soothsayers (Nostradamus, Queen Victoria and Solitaire â€” the Southern Belle) and three different spreads to choose from (including the traditional Celtic Cross). Though the title uses the nearly meaningless term \"multimedia,\" the game has none of the properties usually assigned to \"true\" multimedia titles (i.e., CD-ROM, extended music, digitized video), though it does have nice sound affects to match each card.

As for the game mechanics, they have been dumbed-down a bit to become more Nintendo-like and the graphics have lost some detail, but the game still plays much like the original Amiga/IBM release. The most disturbing thing about this, the most interesting title of any we've seen on the platform, is the sound track, which is an absolutely inappropriate, generic video game theme that clashes horribly with the game's ancient Japanese setting. The games on the TurboGrafx system still have a long way to go before they will draw much interest from hard-core computer gamers. TurboGrafx-16 with CDROM. Circle Reader Service #24. Son diesem Rex Nebular SEX COBRA MISSION: Ja'porn'imation has finally made its way to the U.S. in this package oozing with repressed adolescent sexuality. Voluntarily rated \"R\" by the manufacturer and promising \"nudity in graphical and text (?) formÂ», this game seems typical of the pitifully executed smutware we've seen in the Japanese software magazines for years. The stated objective of this wretched quest is the destruction of an international sex slavery ring, but the real point, it seems, is to break into houses to steal women's underwear so that one can trade the articles with the town pornographer for photos of naked young girls. The graphics take one back to the early days of the Apple II, the interface and combat system are primitive, the story is absolutely horrendous, and the game's text reads like it was translated in Japan by a first year student of English (J.R. take 14 damages!\"). Though we usually try to reserve such strong criticism for full reviews, this game begs for a beating. IBM ($79.95). Circle Reader Service #22.

The Tangram is simply seven pieces of basic geometry formed by the dissection of a square. Players are given a model figure formed of the pieces and are challenged to create that form with their pieces. It is a very simple puzzle system that is currently used by many grammar school teachers to educate their young pupils about geometric relationships and fractions, in the guise of creative play. Why anyone would feel the need to create a computer version of this simple puzzle is beyond us.

"Editorial Back to the Retailer by Johnny L. Wilson State of the Industry: Gamers say that the publishers have dug their own graves with \"buggy\" and unsatisfying software. They claim they are sending a message about quality to the software publishers in a language they will understand, sales. Publishers say that consumers are stealing from them by copying the software and returning it. Retailers and distributors claim that they are stuck in the middle. Who is right when it comes to software returns? It seems reasonable to expect that a gamer could return a game that doesn't do what he/she wanted it to do. Yet, there is something more than the age-old \"satisfaction guaranteedÂ» ideal at stake. Some retailers, even in major chains, are willing to take returns and reshrink wrap the products for resale. Other retailers are concerned about the possibilities for virus infections and wisely refrain from \"reshrinking.\" Is it to the gamer's advantage for a retailer to be so free with software return policies that it may put the gamer's computer system at risk after a future purchase? Probably not. In the early '80s, gamers who had a defective product were inevitably referred back to the manufacturer for satisfaction. The retailers functioned under a \"We just sell the stuff attitude. This meant that it was difficult for consumers to get defective disks replaced or get a refund on games they didn't like. Fortunately, customer service and discounts eventually put stores like Egghead, Babbages, Software Etc. and Electronics Boutique on the map and the cornerstone of this pro-consumer revolution was the ability to return unsatisfactory software. Unfortunately, open return policies have led to retailer expenses in handling returns (they must be physically sent back to the distributor or publisher) and publisher fears that gamers are copying their products, keeping them on their hard drives and then, returning them for a full refund. For the publishers, this means reduced sales and extra shipping expense. For the retailers/distributors, this means extra employee hours to tabulate, package and ship returns. Like the retailer, the publisher cannot resell the copy of a returned game (if it has been on a consumer's machine), so the disks are degaussed and used as extra disks in-house and the package materials are usually destroyed. This is a wasteful procedure and now one current marketing strategy has been suggested where publishers cough up an additional percentage discount to retailers/distributors in order to cover returns. Then, the retail end would destroy the game and the publisher would save on the shipping charges. Publishers, naturally, are afraid that the retailers may claim higher returns than they really receive. What this means is that publishers would receive affidavit returns (the retailer tells the distributor that they had X amount of returns and the distributor tells the manufacturer that the total from all of his/her retail accounts was many times X). That's the way it is in the magazine business. As it is now, the software publisher can physically count returns, but must pay for the shipping in order to do so. Further, the return percentage is going up. Retailers estimate a 5% increase this year alone. Of course, this may relate to more complex games (where more can go wrong) and an economy, of late, where every consumer dollar must count. What this proposal means, of course, is that the retail end of the market is going to, in effect, charge the publishers for having to deal with returns. In turn, the publishers are going to be unsure of the reasons behind the returns. If consumers are trying to send publishers a message about quality, it isn't working because the publishers simply believe their products are being used at no charge. As a result, the publishers will simply pass along the extra charges to the consumers. In turn, raising the prices for everyone where, ultimately, the honest users end up paying for the dishonest ones. We have had reports of consumers purchasing games that were obviously resealed, even from major chains. They complain that a \"new\" price for \"used\" software is not fair and, worse yet, that they don't know where that software has been. Perhaps, it has been corrupted while with its previous owner. Even more alarming might be the spread of a potential computer virus. If a consumer picks up a consumer virus in this manner, we would venture to think that there could be a stink like this industry has not seen in a long time imagine the potential law suits as deep pockets are picked from all directions! For publishers, besides having the possibility of being hit for their deep pockets in the case of such a law suit, there is another major problem. Since they have to back up that software to the hilt, they must answer customer service calls the same for a pirate as they would for a legitimate owner of their game. They must also offer an olive branch to the retailer. Plans such as stock balancing, fixture allowances, marketing development funds, shelf talker fees, etc. to extend both the economic viability and shelf life of computer games, but these mean that the manufacturer has to accept a reduced profit for the game(s) involved. So, it seems, where there is a software return to the local retailer, the store's policy may create something of a consumer crisis if the product is resealed and sold again; a cash flow and employee time crunch for retailers if they follow established return procedures, and an economic crisis for the software publishers if they have to accept additional discounts and affidavit returns to assuage the feelings of the retailers. Naturally, one can see that the additional discounts to retailers come out of the publishers' profit so that retail prices will be raised to cover the new expenses and are passed on to the consumers. So, we would like to urge consumers to think about the chain reaction that is beginning in this industry the next time they are tempted to return a product just because they don't care for it and decide to keep something on the hard drive (just for their trouble). We would like to urge retailers to provide that \"satisfaction guaranteed\" for each customer by following the proper procedure. Those re-shrink shortcuts are a disaster waiting to happen. We would further urge publishers to choose whether to opt for better and more comprehensive quality assurance from the beginning or to get ready to bite that bullet of affidavit returns. It's everybody's problem! CGW Page 194 Computer Gaming World "
