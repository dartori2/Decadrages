We came up with about 363 different ways to improve the look of the magazine. We laughed, we cried, we held hands, and we talked--a lotabout our hopes for a dreamy-looking CGW 6.0. And then we turned it all over to Art Director Steve Wanczyk, and waited anxiously to see the results. Steve, to his credit, considered all of our ideas...and then threw them out. You know why? Because editors have no aesthetic sense whatsoever. How are a group of guys who have the collective artistic mind of an almond going to make a magazine look better?

To Steve's credit, he has been extremely patient. When we talked about things like \"white space\" and \"gutters\"words editors use when we have no idea what we're talking about-he shrugged his shoulders, smirked, and went back into his office. In fact, with the exception of that one time when he crushed Editorial Assistant Tom Price's head between the elevator doors, it was smooth sailing. For all the appealing aesthetic changes inside, our core mission is not changing one iota. In fact, with the addition of our Inside Gaming section, which offers opinions and analysis on all the major game genres, I hope you agree with me when I say that CGW is now even closer to our goal of being the ultimate, definitive word on PC gaming.

"JOHNNY WILSON Count Geiger's Blues It's About Time, Johnny Wilson! ometimes, you have to take what Kierkegaard termed the \"leap of faith.\" Sometimes, for your own personal growth and satisfaction, you have to leap the chasm of the unknown even though you don't know what awaits you on the other side. I've been writing for Computer Gaming World for more than 17 years. I've done everything from pasting address labels on envelopes, manually entering Top 100 data into a spreadsheet, and cleaning toilets to speaking around the world at conferences, on television, and on radio on behalf of CGW and computer entertainment. I've been privileged to visit the world's top designers in order to bring sneak previews and behind-thescenes stories. Most importantly, I've had a wonderful tenure in determining the editorial content of the world's oldest and finest computer-game-specific magazine. With its founder, Russell Sipe, I helped to shepherd the magazine in your hand from 5,000 subscribers and about 15,000 readers in the early '80s to its current status of over 300,000 paid readers. In the process, I saw the PC game industry move from square, blocky images of light on a black, amber or green screen to its current spectral panoply of color depth. I saw PC game marketing move from the days when Mom-and-Pop computer stores carried game disks and monochrome manuals in ziplock bags to the period where you can buy games in discount superstores. I saw the market broaden from predominantly wargamers and role-players to a variety where there is something for everyone. touch. I can only say that I worked very hard to stay in touch with this industry and I never believed that I knew enough about it. I will still be learning about this industry until the doctor fills out the death certificate. I really do care. Perhaps, I care too much. I started writing for CGW as a gamer first and a writer second. I'll leave CGW as a gamer. When I first met many designers, executives, and technicians in this industry, it was as a fan. I wrote about these people because they fascinated me, and I wanted to share them with all of you. I'll continue to be a fan. I wrote my sometimes pompous editorials because I'm a true believer in interactive entertainment, and I wanted to do what I could to make it better. Even as I leave the best pulpit in computer gamedom, I leave as a true believer. I recently read a marvelous science-fiction novel by I was chastened by my own myopia and naivete, even as I admonished designers, executives and readers for their own lack of vision and understanding. D ew people laugh anymore when I talk about comHputer gaming becoming a mass market entertainment experience. Even though we've been through Round One and Round Two of the so-called media convergence, I think there are more rounds to go, and I don't see as many eyes glazing over when I talk about the connected household of the future. We're headed for exciting times in online gaming, and I'm opting to become part of it. I'm stepping into a new position where I can serve on the boards of directors of companies who are making these exciting games, and I'm hoping that I can feel as much like a pioneer in the next generation of gaming as I felt like in the last. So, I'm leaving CGW, and I wanted to say a few words to all of you, including those of you who feel that I've cast aspersions on your favorite gaming genres, publishers, or designers, and those of you who felt that I was cramming an unwanted dose of pretentious, pedantic castor oil down your throats. To everyone who remembers my blunders or thinks I pontificated too much in these pages, I'd just like to say the following. There have been many times when I was chastened by my own myopia and naivete, even as I admonished designers, executives and readers for their own lack of vision and understanding. A lot of people over the years have believed that I was arrogant and out of Michael Bishop. Count Geiger's Blues is the story of a critic who becomes a hero, someone who becomes a doer instead of a commentator. At one point, the critic writes his farewell column to his readers. My eyes and throat went through the kind of emotional calisthenics that might cause onlookers to doubt my manliness. I determined that when I wrote my farewell column to you, I would use a portion of it. How I resonate with the sentiment expressed here! \"But, most of all, I thank the would-be artists who strive to show us the rainbow, and the beholders among us who seek to see as rainbows the jury-rigged arches winched into view by their hopeful makers. Sometimes the noise is horrible. Sometimes the guy-ropes are harder to see than threads. Sometimes the sky is afire with color and light and passion. Sometimes...\" Here's to all of the design teams that try to show us the rainbow. Sometimes, we can't see the colors for the clipping problems. Sometimes the frame rate seems like a PowerPoint presentation. Sometimes, we are swept into virtual worlds afire with conflict and love and passion that are seamless enough to make us forget our everyday problems and experience the ecstasy of victory. GAME OVER, MAN! Or maybe, this last column from the old geezer of computer gaming is just the beginning for all of us. Johnny leaves us to become Publishing Director at Wizards of the Coast. We wish him the best. CGW 26 OCTOBER 1999. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

Ghost in the Machine is a cyber thriller chronidon't want to start a village. All I want is that maybe we should be trying to push that envelope in the other direction just a little. Tony Travers San Diego, CA Gore! What Is it Good For? TA7ith respect to the violence in gaming issue, I would first like to say that I don't want to be anyone else's parent. As Charles Barkley once said, \"I am not a role model.\" However, I do believe that just to say that it is the parent's sole responsibility to regulate what their children are watching or playing is a little naïve. The point is that there are boundaries that most people would not like to cross. You can call these whatever you like-moral, ethical, political, religious, legal, whatever. It really doesn't matter what you call them, they do exist. If they didn't, a game where the object was to push human beings into an oven in 1940 Germany and Poland would not be met with outrage. There are times when things go too far or are just plain wrong. It seems that in today's gaming world most publishers and developers are always trying to push that envelope. How violent can it be? How graphic can it be? How sexy can it be? How far can we go? Look, I don't want to build a bridge. I We agree, Tony. The concept of parental responsibility does not free game publishers of their own responsibility. And game publishers can go too far. Deciding what \"too far\" means, though, is a really sticky matter. We do know that we don't want some entity in Washington making the call. And parents taking more interest in their childrens' media consumption can only help matters. Ultimately, the best we can do is talk about the issue, to keep a constant dialogue between game publishers, the gaming press, and game players. We're glad to get letters like yours and we encour age others to write to us and to publishers. The publishers push the violence envelope because they think gamers want them to. Well, do you? Walk the Talk Tam a long time reader and fan of CGW and find it unfortunate that the hypocrisy of your July issue requires comment.

"ETTERS the RSAC) approach because of its emphasis on evaluating the content of games. Bravo! I have enjoyed games that I felt are inappropriate for younger gamers, and feel that this is the correct approach to help parents monitor the content of the games for their children. I am also very aware that most individuals are able to play these violent games and enjoy them in context. The sick individuals who commit heinous crimes will do so whether the catalyst is a video game or 10 years working for the United States Postal Service. It is slightly different when discussing the adolescent psyche, however. In no way, though, should these games be banned. The need for self regulation of the gaming community is articulated very well by Mr. Wilson With that said, how the heck could your magazine package extremely violent crap like KINGPIN in your CGW July CD. There was no warning I could find, and this program is available to millions of children through your magazine. If any game needs an \"R\" rated label, it is this program. It is just not appropriate for younger gamers. Please be more careful in the future, and if you advocate content labeling try to practice it. With that said, off to play more HEROES III. Colin Linehan Maryland Great point, Colin. As something of a \"publisher\" of game demos, we're just as responsible for content labeling as the game publishers are. We did include a warning with the KINGPIN demo, but it obviously wasn't prominent enough. We'll do better in the future. cling the story of a single mother tormented by the computerized ghost of a serial killer. This, to all of you who aren't animation fans, is known as a live action. The movie that inspired ONI is none other than Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell, based on the manga by Masamu Shirow. Although this small mistake is deemed trivial, I don't think that anyone should get credit for another person's success. Thus, I am quick to point out this mistake. Nathaniel Plain Can't Beat It T just finished playing the BEATDOWN demo from your LJuly '99 issue, and it really stank! What sort of criteria do you use in selecting the demos that go into each issue? Josh We charge a buck a meg. Just kidding, it's two bucks. We allocate space on the disc based on gameplay quality, with preference towards interactive demos over non-interactive movies. But if we have extra space, we try to include every new demo we can get. Not all are winners, but that's the point of a demo, no? Vox Populi T'd like to thank Loyd Case for his article on voice Il communication software (July, page 90). I am a frequent player of TEAM FORTRESS CLASSIC (ain't we all) and communication is the hardest thing about it. But, today I picked up Roger Wilco on the advice of a clan member. We played two hours straight, and it was pure bliss. It never broke up too heavily, but I did have to ask for a couple repeats because his voice was kind of muddy. But it was pure bliss. I'd like to thank you guys, and the folks at Resounding Technology, makers of Roger Wilco. Joey Garrison The Ugly Truth Toystick and graphics accelerator card makers U probably think that gamers are a bunch of Idiots. Just look at the depiction of their product Musers\" of the joystick/soundcard/graphics accelerator (choose one, they're all unoriginal) on the packaging. Most of the pictures show some doofus with his mouth open almost as if he's drooling and eyes look ing real shocked at the screen. Some even show the gamer with hair standing on end as it electrocuted. What about the ones where the gamer just looks as if he's trying to stop himself from peeing in his pants. Go ahead. Imagine the face you'd make.) Yes, all they want to do is sell their stuff and convey the excitement the product would bring. But they should come up with some original ideas. The mouthwide-open depiction doesn't cut it anymore. If you don't believe me, just take a look at the packaging at your favorite games peripherals shop. This, however, does not apply to Thrustmaster which seems to have done the opposite and taken a laid back approach to marketing, right down to recommending other people's programming utilities on their own website. Furthermore, other people have come up with better utilities than Thrustmaster. Shame but they seem to be happy with that. But the pilot and plane pica ture on their boxes is enough to tell you what a joystick does. Colin J. Smith Yeah, the bug-eyed gamer is getting a little old.

"Read.Me The Latest News From Around the Gaming World  Edited by jeff green@zd.com EA Scraps Jane's A-10 Another Month, Another Flight Sim Bites the Dust H U lectronic Arts' highly touted JANE'S A-10 WARTHOG is the latest sim to get shot down in a recent wave of cancellations. Pile A-10 onto the heap that now includes Dynamix' ACES OF THE PACIFIC 2 and X-FIGHTERS. and Eidos' CONFIRMED KILL. Does this mean flight sims are going the way of the dodo? That's certainly the impression some had after hearing of A-10's cancellation. Although Origin claimed that WARTHOG was cancelled because it didn't match the company's new focus on online-only games, sim enthusiasts were quick to accuse EA of backing away from its commitment to hardcore flight sims. A petition urging EA to reconsider attracted more than 600 comments within days of the announcement (www.limech.com). While it may be true that EA wants higher sales than a typical flight sim achieves, sources close to the development team say A10's cancellation was due to serious problems on the project and not to lack of commitment. \"A-10 was in very bad shape graphically,\" 913 Quake 3 Arena Update Reporter Vic Long Visits id Software and Takes a Bullet for the CGW Team A hen your goal is to design the new benchmark in multiplayer action, perfection takes more than programming skill and design savvy. It takes dedication and perseverance...and lots and LOTS of deathmatching Deathmatching is about all I've done in my recent visits to id Software. The design team's daily, frenzied DeathMatch and Capture-the-Flag sessions are invariably followed by a central office gathering to breathlessly recount incredible long-distance rail gunnings, cowardly escapes and dirty tricks. It may look like a bunch of goofs screwing off, but this is how designing the ultimate multiplayer splatterfest is done. From what I've seen, the id team is well on its way to yet another smashing success. The latest QUAKE 3 test release adds many subtle improvements. The higher-level menus now incorporate a mouse-driven cursor. A new circular targeting reticle (customizable in the final release) changes from white to yellow to red as your health declines. The server menu contains a Zone option for helping players find servers. And a Sprite option allows players to squeeze even more 3D performance out of their systems. On the design scrap heap are the three character classes and the flamethrower weapon, as originally conceived. Why? They simply did not add enough to the gameplay. Also nuked was the chainsaw because it was chewing up too much network bandwidth. The current weapons list includes the gauntlet, machine gun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, grappling hook, lightening gun, plasma rifle, rail gun, and a BFG of some sort. This new BFG (still in the works) is more like a Heckler & Koch 40mm machine-gun than the BFG of DOOM or QUAKE II. The new king of weaponry will crank OCTORED 1999. mamaennt cam.

In addition to the Quad damage power-up, there will be several new goodies like Flight, Regeneration, Invisibility, and Haste. Whenever a player nabs an upper, a voice message will be broadcast to everyone in the arena. Many new characters will be added. The few I've seen include the Orb, a bizarre mutation of giant eyeball and ET doing handstands; the Hunter, a female warrior who looks hotter than Leeloo from The Fifth Element; and Lucy, a homely and squat wearer of abused stockings. My favorite new character is Uriel, the winged gargoyle, but only because it's as ugly as I am. Several characters from id history make an appearance. Tank Junior is the offspring of the Tank from QUAKE II. Artemis, the female soldier from QUAKE II, makes a comeback. The original QUAKE marine returns with a spiffier look. Even the DOOM guy gets a role. Bots, or computer-controlled players, will be an important feature in the final release. The bots are intended to provide a multiplayer experience, even for those playing solo, and to help newbies train for matches against other humans.

Based on ancient mythology and the alignment of stars at the millennium, the story will take Lara through a series of Egyptian locations and pit her against a host of native and mythological enemies As predicted, THE LAST REVELATION will employ a new game engine, and for the first time there will be a dedicated PC version that will not be constrained by the limitations of the Sony PlayStation. The PC version will make use of hardware. specific features, thus ensuring that it will look up-to-date, technology-wise. To add to the atmosphere, lighting effects such as spotlighting have been added, and surfaces can now reflect and react to light sources. Locations and enemies will be a lot more detailed, while Lara herself has been remodeled and given a whole range of new moves that will be central to solving the puzzles and avoiding traps. Unlike TOMB RAIDER III, which was made up of five separate adventures, THE LAST REVELATION will focus on a single objective, and while the plot will contain several unexpected twists, your goal will always be in sight Another key difference is that the game will be based entirely in Egypt instead of taking place in different locations throughout the world.

Notice the nice threads and the fact that the two guys are actually interacting with women, Well, we at CGW felt the ad didn't quite represent what we consider a \"typical\" gaming experience, so we went out and found a few \"models\" of our own to present a sadder, but far truer, picture of the situation. istration HOME WORLD HASBRO Interactive Q. You know the drill. A. Alex Garden, CEO of Relic Entertainment, makers of the upcoming HOMEWORLO. Q. CEO, eh? What is it you actually do? photo by Michael Falconer A. Glad you asked. I'm in charge of three things: Creative direction (working with the programmers and artists), press relations, and business development issues. Q. What's it like being the CEO of a 40-person company at the age of 24? A. It's great. Much better than being an unemployed CEO at the age of 24. Besides, I feel like I'm 50. Q. You like fast cars and motorcycles. Any scary moments? A. Yeah, I bought a '98 Honda CBR 900, and the first week I had it, I wasn't used to the power. I took a curve and saw a pothole and swerved to avoid it, and just then a car appeared out of nowhere. I had to go off road and almost laid the bike down in a patch of gravel. Glad I have those RTS reflexes. I hate to think what would have happened if HOMEWORLD was turn-based! Q. Speaking of HOMEWORLD, what was the inspiration for it? A. I was having a conversation with a bunch of friends about games, and suddenly it flashed in my mind how to make a convincing 3D world in a flat 2D monitor. I left Electronic Arts and founded Relic, and we had the basic engine banged out in a month and a half. The rest of the time we've spent working on the \"details.\" 2. Was it always called HOMEWORLD? A. The original code name was \"Spaghetti Ball.\" We like HOMEWORLD better. Any other game company is welcome to use \"Spaghetti Ball.\" We release it to the public domain. Q. What are some of your favorite games? A. TWINSEN'S ODYSSEY, FALLOUT, and TOTAL ANNIHILATION are some. Believe it or not, I also love SOLITAIRE-there's a mystique about that game. Q. You've been working in the game industry since you were 15. How did you swing that? A. When I was 15 I saw a guy pull up in a black Lamborghini Diablo. He was Don Mattrick, then President of Distinctive Software (now with EA). I told him I wanted to do whatever it was he was doing. We talked a bit and he told me to contact him in a couple of years. I went home that night and cooked up a bogus resume and had it delivered to his desk the next day. He hired me as a part-time summer tester. That was where I met Chris Taylor of TOTAL ANNIHILATION fame. Since then Don and Chris have been my respective business and creative mentors. Q. HOMEWORLD is in the homestretch. Are you going to Disneyworld when it's finislied? A. Actually, I think I'll just go to bed.

"PREVIEWS Dark Reign 2 Pandemic Pushes the RTS Into the Third Dimension by George Jones he third dimension can be a frightening place if you're a real-time strategy gamer 11. (or a Picasso fan). Exciting, but scary. I am used to plotting strategies by scrolling around flat maps viewed from a fixed, isometric perspective. I am used to certain types of interfaces, and the prospects of the upcoming 3D revolution worry me Don't get me wrong: 3D views and effects and terrain make for gorgeous games. But I worry-oh, how I worry-that it also means awkward controls and swiveling, rotating, maddening interfaces. Recently, my worries were eased by the guys at Pandemic Studios, the developer working on the sequel to DARK REIGN for Activision. A highly innovative title that kind of got lost in the deluge of realtime strategy games DARK REIGN 2 two years ago, DARK GENRE: Real-Time Strategy REIGN was one of the RELEASE DATE: 04 '99 first games to incorpoPUBLISHER: Activision rate such modern effiDEVELOPER: Pandemic Studios ciencies as unit queuing, waypoints, and even rally points. From the look of things, they're about to bring the same level of innovation into the 3D environs of DARK REIGN 2. Authority (JDA). Most people, however, still live outside these domes in tribe-like communities scattered about the world. Collectively, these tribes are known as the Sprawlers. As you may have guessed, they don't get along very well with the soft, protected dome-dwellers. The story begins on Earth, as the Sprawlers-who are actually the unorganized precursor to the Freedom Guard in DARK REIGN-are trying to break into the domes. From here, the battles move into space onto a variety of colorful, exotic alien worlds and even space stations that showcase the game's HEAVY GEAR II-based 3D engine. Part of the joy of playing DARK REIGN 2, in fact, is enjoying the exotic beauty of the different worlds, and using the terrain features, geography, and even the time of day to your advantage. The Action Much like its predecessor, DARK REIGN 2 emphasizes infantry units over vehicles, which gives the game an immense amount of personality-especially given the scaleable 3D graphics, which get more and more detailed as you zoom in. Watching grunt infantry units like the Sprawlers' Rumblers grimace and grin as they wage war on the front lines gives the action an extra kick of entertainment, particularly when you're winning. Some absolutely monstrous vehicles also come into play as you craft prerequisite buildings. The Sprawler's humongous Zeppelin, for example, doubles as an air attack craft and as a unit transport, while the Big Brother is a cool, long-range artillery vehicle. On the JDA side of the battle are vehicles Think Phantom Menace DARK REIGN 2 is a prequel, with a story that explains the conditions of the universe existent in the original game.

"(DARK REIGN was )... a highly innovative title that kind of got lost in the deluge of realtime strategy games two years ago ... like the Growler, a slow-moving, frontline vehicle with a massive gun. Take all these units, pit them against each other, and the advantages of using a 3D engine in this type of game are instantly obvious. Colored light-sourcing, when combined with the 3D terrains, make for some impressive, dramatic battle scenes. During one dramatic mission, my troops were trying to break through a massive gate that protected the JDA encampment. In an epic battle scene, my artillery hammered away at the gate with orange and purple bursts of light, while my infantry units fought it out at the bottom of the gate. This battle drove home the key advantage of 3D terrain: You can move your camera anywhere you'd like at any time, which can make you a better commander. Padded Landing After the first few warm-up missions, you'll engage in the usual variety, from all-out slugfests to smaller puzzle-like quests. In some cases, you'll encounter both types of play within a single mission. You might have to figure out how to free up some prisoners at the start of a mission, and then use the units to set up traditional base-on-base combat. In most base-on-base missions, your Landing Pad-base headquarters-is the holy of holies. Through the Pad, you order new units, extra buildings, and base improvements that arrive from space via shuttle. One nice touch is the way buildings and base improvements pop out of the shuttle as tiny vehicles and then expand into their full size once they're placed. The Landing Pad adds an extra dimension of strategy to the game. Because your shuttle has to take the time to go into space to retrieve any goods you've ordered-larger loads take longer to retrieve-you're forced to make tough decisions. Do you wait that one crucial minute you need to gather enough resources to purchase that Repair building? Do you want your shuttle to make a quick run to get the units to defend your baseforegoing the buildings you'll need to gain access to new and better units-in exchange for a faster delivery time? The game's currency is a resource named Taelon, which players of the original DARK REIGN may remember. A molecular byproduct of terraforming that will be more fully explained this time around, Taelon is gathered with the usual slow-moving, vulnerable Harvester-type units.

I Wish I Could Be Like Walt. by Chris Lombardi many years now. In addition to the original THEME PARK, they've done THEME HOSPITAL and THEME AQUARIUM (released in Japan). For their next project, THEME PARK WORLD, they've taken all they've learned and created a game that nails the work-play balance to the wall. THEME PARK WORLD is pure game-design gold. Or, in this case, a gold ticket. n my real life, the distinction between work and fun is easy to make. Getting Jeff Green to turn in his articles: work. Launching pointy projectiles at Jeff Green with the Cavedog catapult tchotchke: fun. But in my gaming life, this distinct tion isn't so clear, especially when we're talking about a typical \"builder\" game like Maxis' SIMCITY or Bulldog's original THEME PARK. Building a gorgeous city of my dreams and then setting it aflame: clearly, a blast. But laying 12 miles of sewer pipe? Building my own theme park from the ground up, designing roller coasters, and watching little computer kiddies romp: a good time. Ordering supplies for my concession stands and cleaning up the vomit of queasy kids? This is entertainment software, right? Designing these games well is a real challenge. You want a game that offers enough flexibility and depth to engage the player's creativity, but not a game that gets bogged down in details and monotonous activity. You want fun work, recreational labor, the joy of creation without the pain. The team behind Bullfrog's THEME PARK WORLD has been plugging away at this fun-work equation for Midas Touch The gold ticket is what you're after in this completely remodeled game, the reward you earn for designing a park well and the pass key to more of the game's features.

There's the thrill factor, of course: Do you have a variety of rides to keep your patrons on a constant adrenaline high? Do your coasters keep them screaming?

"PREVIEW 5 THINGS Five Best Finishing Moves in PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D 1. The Backhand Plunge The prince slashes his enemy with his sword and then, turning away from his opponent, drives the blade with a backhand move into his gut. 2. The Neck Twister The prince wraps his staff around his opponent's neck, turns, and shakes the guy like a rag doll until things start snapping. GARGOYLE MOHEL Watch out for motion-captured executing various those swinging blades! Traps like this sword-swingmoves, none of that motion capture is ing statue are everywhere in PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D. being directly used in the game; instead, it's being employed as a template for the Prince's actions. This lets the designers create a character who moves realistically-turning by leading with his head, for example-but also with the flair and embellishment that are inherent in traditional animation. The end result is a character who can leap with incredible realism while enjoying the incredible unrealism of a five-foot vertical jump. The combination of gameworld and animation really shine in the combat LEAP OF FAITH Leaping over hazards sequences. The prince will have four like this bed of spikes will make up a large portion of gameplay and is a direct carryaver from previous weapons, including three close-comPRINCE games. bat weapons (sword, staff, and double blades) and a bow. The control scheme is remarkably simple, especially for a game that stresses the strategy of sword fighting over simple twitch ability. Gamers will have to pick the appropriate weapon, then sculpt attacks, feints, and blocks into a piece of strategic combat art. Each combat weapon has combos to learn and each also features up to five different finishing moves (see sidebar). The exception to this rule is the game's only long-range weapon: the bow. But while it has no combos or finishing moves, the bow does have an arsenal of nine magical arrows at its disposal. The Water Freezing arrow, the Blue Fire arrow, and the Lifestealer are not only weapons but also keys to solving puzzles. The Charmed Lights arrow has no offensive capabilities at all, but it can be used to draw the attention of enemies, allowing you to sneak past them. 3. The Tear With the double blades, the prince stabs both blades into his opponent, gives them a little twist, then tears them apart. 4. The Chest Thrust The prince tosses his sword in the air, catches it, and drives it down into his opponent's rib cage. Then, in a very nice animation touch, he has to brace his foot on the guy in order to pull his sword out again. 5. The Back Skewer The prince spins toward his opponent, hitting him multiple times with the staff in the process, and finally smacks it into the base of his spine with a satisfying snap. Arabian Knights Picking up where the last game left off, PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D opens with the Prince's new bride being kidnapped by the evil Hassan in order to marry her off to his corrupt son Ragnor. Thrown in prison, the prince must escape and, of course, rescue his love. True to the spirit of the series, the prince starts out unarmed and must find a weapon while dodging the diabolical traps that fill the game. You'll never be stumbling blindly through the levels; be it through brief cut scenes or other clues, you'll always have an idea where you need to go and roughly what you'll need to do to get there. This approach carries over to the trap design as well; while there are loads of hazards like guillotine doors, decapitating blades that spring from walls, and pillars that suddenly drive up from the floor to impale you on spikes set in the ceiling, the cautious player can pick up clues to avoid the traps. It's a happy break from the school of game design that alerts you to trap location by killing you. There is no inventory system, though there are items such as keys that must be found and used. But instead of forcing you to fumble through an inventory screen to use the key, the game will know that you have it and just unlock the door. The only drawback we see to the lack of inventory is in the handling of the potions. These magical elixirs pepper the gameworld and give the gamer temporary powers such as camouflage, featherfall, and increased attack power. While these will most likely be placed right where gamers will most need them, the inability to carry healing potions for later use could rankle some gamers It's the only potential weak point in a game we are frankly dying to play.

"PREVIEW THEY'VE GOT GUTS This intestine-intensive shot demonstrates Raven's no-holds-barred approach to graphic violence. Soldier of Fortune Raven Pushes Gaming Violence and the QUAKE 2 Engine to Extremes by Thierry Nguyen WARLORDS: BATTLECRY GENRE: 3D Action RELEASE DATE: Q4 '99 PUBLISHER: Activision DEVELOPER: Raven Software ard as it may seem, it is entirely possible to switch from a medieval fantasy theme to pulse-pounding action. Paul Verhoeven went from the obscure Flesh & Blood to Total Recall and managed just fine. The Raven development house has done a spells-for-guns exchange program in their shift from HERETIC II to SOLDIER OF FORTUNE (SOF), all while hoping to retain the same fast-paced gameplay that firstperson shooter fans are looking for. SOF casts you as John Mullin, the real-life mercenary consultant from Soldier of Fortune magazine. The exact plot details are still being worked out, but essentially, you'll be hopping around various hotspots-Iraq, Siberia, Kosovo, New York?-to take on terrorists. Raven is going for the feel of a blockbuster military action movie like The Rock or Navy SEALS, and the focus of the gameplay is the fastpaced firefight. Mullin consulted on the project to make sure the tactics of the enemy opponents and the general feel of the game were accurate, so expect high risk (one or two shots can kill both you and your enemies) and fast and furious gunplay. The various levels will have different mission goals, ranging from sneaky assassinations to balls-out showdowns. the thigh, and could actually see the shattered bone stump sticking out. In deference to the current controversy over violence in gaming, Raven will include a special parental lock. At press time, they were still deciding whether the lock will be \"all or nothing\" or have gradual settings. At its maximum setting there is no blood, dismemberment or screaming, resulting in enemies literally rolling over and dying. Also, there will be civilians in some of these missions, and you will automatically lose if you accidentally shoot one. The weapons list includes several standard real-world weapons that you've seen in countless magazines and movies. At press time, there are some licensing issues with the names of the guns, so while you may not be officially using, say, the Desert Eagle, you'll be using a differently-named gun with similar characteristics. Also in your arsenal will be two AI mercenaries who will provide support in key missions. STYLISH GUYS ACCESSORIZE The hit-location modeling is so sensitive that you can shoot accessories such as hats, sunglasses, and even guns out of enemies' hands. Just a Flesh Wound The character design is the most drastic improvement Raven has made on the QUAKE II engine. Just because you're fighting other humans doesn't mean you'll be fighting endless armies of clones, as in WOLFENSTEIN 3D or even HALF-LIFE. The character body type will be the same, but there are a variety of different clothes, weapons and faces to differentiate the enemies. What really makes the enemies stand out are the injury and animation systems. Wound location is modeled to an uncomfortably accurate degree. Not only can you individually target body parts, but the hit location system even allows you to shoot between an enemy's legs. For the character animations, Raven has motion-captured sequences for each wound location; hit someone in the neck, and he'll clutch the wound in agony, or go for a groin shot to watch him writhe in misery. The wound modeling and animation will surely be controversial. Even I was shocked the first time I saw a shot that severed an enemy's leg at Multiple Ways to Flay For multiplayer, Raven is thinking of adding a variety of new game types to stand beside traditional deathmatch. There's Assassin, where every player is given a specific player to kill, and upon success is given a different player, until everyone in the game has been fragged. There's also Arsenal, where the winner is the first person to score a frag with every weapon (no more rocket hogs). While SOF may have deviated from the original design concept (as reported in April), it still looks like a very solid game. It's a direct foil to the military sims featured in our cover story, but if you're craving some hard-boiled, movie-style military action-and have the stomach for extreme gore-look for SOLDIER OF FORTUNE when it hits shelves this November.

"PREVIEW How Does a 500-Pound Gorilla | Design an Online Role-Playing Game? Any Way it Wants To. by Thierry Nguyen You know you're onto something hot when the Evil Empire wants in on the action. After the success of Origin's and Sony's online role-playing games, it wasn't long before Microsoft made its play. Just as I was ending my EVERQUEST binge, an ASHERON'S CALL (AC) beta landed in my hands. While Microsoft's RPG has many trappings of a traditional RPG, it is by far the most original of the three big massively-multiplayer RPGs. Character generation is similar to other games, but here there's an additional level of detail. While other games let you pick your character's face and clothing colors, AC lets you pick all the individual components of the face and clothing. The AC design team wanted to make sure that every gamer has a chance to make a truly unique character, rather than a cookie-cutter clone. Characters are skillbased rather than class-based; gamers can use either a default template like \"warrior,\" or choose which skills the character will focus on. You then pop into Dereth, the game world. One of the big features being touted in AC is the lack of zones; you can walk from one end of Dereth to another without seeing a load screen. And don't expect a short walk either, as Dereth has over 500 square miles of terrain. For faster travel, there are teleportation portals scattered around the landscape. Entering dungeons will be the only time you'll have pause for data transfer, and it's barely noticeable. Since all dungeons are small downloads, it'll be simple for the design team to seamlessly add new acreage. Asheron's Call ASHERON'S CALL GENRE: Online RPG. RELEASE DATE: 04 99 PUBLISHER: Microsoft DEVELOPER: Turbine Entertainment Software FEE FI FO FUM This giant Monouga is an example of the unique creatures in ASHERON'S CALL, as the design team has eschewed traditional fantasy critters in order to be original. Murder, Madness, Mayhem, Microsoft ASHERON CALL'S combat will make some innovations. The design team is straying from the traditional \"click-until-your-mouse-dies\" style of combat by adding additional tactical elements. Your enemies will vary in height, so your combat menu will have additional buttons denoting high, medium, or low attacks. You'll have to deal with high-flying wasps, and you'll have to decide whether or not that Drudge's head is less protected than its chest. In addition, you'll have a slider bar that determines how fast and powerful your blows will be. Speed and power have an inverse relationship, so that you can opt for quick, weak attacks or strong, slow ones. The design will also breathe new life into the death experience. There are Life Stones scattered throughout Dereth, and you can bind yourself to any of these; once you die, you'll be resurrected at the last stone you were bound to. Upon resurrection, you'll lose half your money and your most valuable item. Finally, you'll suffer a five percent penalty to all your skills and stats. This penalty fades as time goes by, but if you die again, well, those penalties start to add up. It's an interesting compromise, in that while you do get penalized, it's not as harsh as other games where your items are with your corpse and you must retrieve them. VORPAL BUNNY SLAYER Combat is more than just point-and-click. You need to weigh factors such as target height, and speed versus power of your attack.

CGW Westwood's Multiplayer May Challenge DIABLO by Thierry Nguyen NOX GENRE: RPG RELEASE DATE: 01 '00 PUBLISHER: Westwood Studios XITO to our jaded eyes, Nox looks like a simple DIABLO ripoff. But after playing a few multiplayer sessions, we have to say that NOX has plenty to distinguish itself from the DIABLO clone masses. The backstory here is that your name is Bob, and one day you're zapped into another dimension. After choosing to be a Warrior, Conjurer, or Wizard, you embark on an 11-mission crusade against the evil Hecubah. Each character class has a different set of missions, with 33 total. Westwood is now tweaking the single-player campaign to make sure it feels different depending on your class. When NOX really shines is during multiplayer. The three classes are well-balanced against each other; the Warrior is the straight \"point-and-click attack\" fighter, who can use his shield for protection against magical spells. Meanwhile, the Wizard has an array of traditional spells, complemented by those that focus on teleportation. Lastly, the Conjurer has a spell arsenal concentrating on summoning monsters, and can also wield some ranged weapons. While the character balance is very well done, what's even better are the spell traps and combinations. Both the Wizard and the Conjurer can string three different spells together to create a particular combination-such as a Wizard teleporting the target into an open fire, blinding it, and then dropping a giant stone fist on it. With about 40 spells to choose from for each class, there will be lots of opportunities for new and more devious combinations. This feature alone makes Nox multiplayer a great ride. Not only will there be deathmatch, but there will be specific multiplayer scenarios, such as King of the Hill or Capture the Flag, all supported on Westwood Online. There are other features that make NOX a standout, but what really drew us in were the spell combinations and character-class balance. While there will be many DIABLO clones, we'll probably be too busy dropping giant stone fists on each other-in Nox-to notice. CGW 84 OCTOBER 1999cow.gamespot.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"COVER STORY Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun Kane We visited Westwood Studios and locked ourselves into a tiny, dark room for days with just one purpose-to play the hell out of C&C: TIBERIAN SUN and find out if it will live up to the hype. by Robert Coffey and Tom Price T he most hotly anticipated real-time strategy title of the year, COMMAND & CONQUER: TIBERIAN SUN I will hit shelves burdened with the crushing weight of the high expectations of gamers. After the enormous popularity of both C&C and RED ALERT, what could Westwood do to top themselves, let alone to stand out in the most crowded genre in gaming? What will set TIBERIAN SUN apart from the pack? The world is huge and dangerous, an active player in the game. The action is blistering. The units are alternately brutal and devious. So will it be worth the wait? The answer is a resounding \"yes.\" After days filled with nothing more than the relentless playing with a days-from-finished build of TIBERIAN SUN, we can report that while it won't be the huge leap forward in the RTS genre that STARCRAFT was, it's a solid, compelling game in its own right and on its own terms. KANE LIVES IN DEATH. NO, REALLY, HE DOES. It turns out that Nod's megalomaniacal leader Kane may not have actually died at the end of the last game. That's bad news for the law-enforcing Global Defense Initiative, who are now faced with suppressing another NOD assault. This conflict is played out over two entirely separate campaigns which can run anywhere from 12 to 19 missions, depending on how many optional missions a player takes on. Unlike other games which try to tell one huge story through numerous mini-campaigns, TIBERIAN COMPUTER GAMING WORID. www.cnnntarnaminn enm. NCIORER 1999 "


"COVER STORY-C&C: TIBERIAN SUN A BRIDGE TOO FAR Heated battles on bridges not only look cool, but destructible bridges mean you can cut off access routes or even drop your enemies into the drink. SUN tells two distinct stories, with each side successfully driving toward victory. Elaborate video cut scenes between missions tell both stories with Hollywood stars like Michael Biehn and James Earl Jones slumming in key roles. As well done as they are, it can be a little hard to take the videos seriously, what with hordes of Nod true believers chanting \"Kane lives in death!\" and a chesty, crosseyed mutant named Umagon with tiberium sprouting from her forehead. While there are a slew of new features in the game, players will find much that is familiar. The iconic construction interface is still fundamentally the same, though up to five units of both infantry and vehicles can be queued up for production. Unfortunately, although TIBERIAN SUN sports an incredibly robust waypoint system, units still simply spill out and collect at the door of their production center, since you cannot set MOTOR POOL Even though rally points. TIBERIAN SUN features a great waypoint The campaigns are broken up into system, the game's lack of rally points both production and non-production means your vehicles and infantry still bunch up outside the buildings that produce them. missions, with a few hybrid missions that ask you to seize an area with limited forces and then build a base. The GDI undertake more non-production scenarios than the Nod, for example, one GDI mission charges you with destroying a dam, following a fairly-fixed winding path through the map. After clearing each big Nod defensive position, a transport arrives bearing fresh units. This mission is also indicative of the branching structure of the campaigns-completing it makes a subsequent mission easier. These missions aren't required, you can choose to skip over them, but the following missions are so difficult that most gamers will want the edge that completing the optional scenarios gives them. The campaigns are welldesigned and consistently challenging, with frequent surprises. For example, one Nod mission asks you to employ your newfound mutant allies to eliminate a small GDI presence before setting up a base to prepare for a larger assault. Typically devious Nod planning results in a royal backstabbing of the mutants who then turn on you, suddenly forcing you to deal with an enemy that is more than likely hovering around your base. A few of the non-production missions fall flat, unfortunately, in particular, one Nod rescue mission hinges more on stumbling across the right path than on tactical ingenuity. Still, we expect most players will be happy with DEEP IMPACT As if dealboth the length and challenge of ing with the Nod and GDI forces weren't hard enough, random events both campaigns, as well as a cunlike this devastating meteor storm ning AI that is as likely to launch a make the gameworld even more full-scale assault as to distract you dangerous. with a distant skirmish so it can surreptitiously capture your base structures with engineers.

"COVER STORY-CSC: TIBERIAN SUN WHAT'S NEW?  Unit veterancy rewards players for keeping units alive with better attack and occasional special abilities.  Robust waypoint system allows for multiple patrol and guard routes.  Terrain reflects battle damage and lets players strategically blow up bridges and collapse tunnels. Ice floes spanning rivers will crack under the weight of heavy units, sink the units, and then refreeze over time.  Random map generator for multiplayer action.  Random ion and meteor storms that damage or shut down units add another layer of strategic complexity.  Mobile sensor units detect cloaked or burrowed units. the Nod and GDI unit sets. The GDI leans heavily on massively-armored units capable of dealing punishing amounts of damage. Mech-like units such as the Wolverine, Titan, and the vicious Mammoth Mark II make for devastating assault forces in numbers. The GDI is all about classic tactical stratagems, relying on pincer maneuvers and straightforward, withering assaults to beat their opponents. Even their infantry units are powerful, with grenade-lobbing Disc Throwers and Jump Jet Infantry that can hover across the rivers and streams that lace game maps. The Nod, on the other hand, are just plain evil. Relying on stealth and surprise, the Nod units will probably hold the most appeal for gamers. Burrowing units like the Devil's Tongue Flame Tank or Subterranean APC let Nod commanders pop up in enemy bases to wreak havoc, while Stealth Generators can be built to conceal entire Nod bases. We found that hit-and-run tactics that disrupt enemy production are an especially effective tact to take in multiplayer games; in fact, the Nod can win multiplayer matches without ever launching a typical full-scale assault, thanks in large part to their devastating Chemical Missile. By harvesting veins of tiberium, Nod forces can create warheads that unleash clouds of horrible tiberium waste, mutating enemy forces, destroying their buildings, then spreading a toxic vapor that turns its victims into mutated visceroids that attack anything near them, including former comrades. Few weapons have said \"Screw you\" more effectively. The visceroids are just one part of a landscape that is as much a part of the game as other players or the AI Bridges can be blown to shut down avenues of attack; tiberiumtainted creatures and mutants will attack both sides; huge sucking maws (like DUNE 2's sand worms) gobble forces that try to cross plains veined with tiberium; frozen rivers can be crossed by lighter units; and fields of tiberium will poison human troops or, in the case of blue tiberium, explode under fire. Ion storms shut down technology-based units while showers of tiberium meteors re-seed the land with tiberium, but could contaminate or wipe out entire bases. All of these things add challenges for gamers both to avoid and to exploit, especially in multiplayer.  Subterranean units allow for devious base assaults.  Tiberium-based plants and animals present new hazards.  Blue tiberium, more valuable than the standard green variety, lets players collect money faster. The unstable nature of the substance means that firefights taking place on blue tiberium fields can end in devastating explosions.  While other infantry units take damage in tiberium fields and can eventually turn into vicious tiberium-based creatures, cyborg commandos actually heal in tiberium fields. Unit production queuing.  Base cloaking technology lets Nod commanders hide in plain sight.  Includes both hostile and friendly mutant units and civilian vehicles.  Colored lighting makes for a much more visuallyinteresting battlefield. BALANCE AND POWER We went into our marathon playfest with some skepticism. First off, we couldn't understand why flying units couldn't penetrate unrevealed portions of the map. Westwood's reasoning was that airborne units can scout out too much of the map in multiplayer games and throw the balance out of whack. While we fully expected to hate this choice, we found that it wasn't really an issue-flying units are far enough down the technology tree that if you hadn't done extensive scouting by the time you were ready to build them, you were probably dead anyway. While this will still infuriate some gamers, we're now convinced it shouldn't be too important. We were especially heartened by the efforts being made to halt the tank rushes that plagued previous C&C's in multiplayer. The most significant change comes in unit production-multiple production buildings no longer supercharge your production rates. While you'll get a slight production bonus with a second war factory, anything after that is just a waste of money. Also, Electromagnetic Pulse Cannons will literally halt a tank rush in its tracks. With every unit having a counter on the other side, players are going to have to develop new tactics and constantly re-evaluate their strate. gies in order to crush their opponents. Unit veterancy is an interesting new idea, with units gaining improved attacks and, in some cases, new abilities after inflicting so many enemy kills. But this cool idea may turn out to be irrelevant. As cool as it is to have your veteran Rocket Bikes suddenly gain the ability to attack aircraft, the \"expendable horde\" play that dominates RTS games COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. www.computereaming.com .

While we expect this to change, we have a few concerns about the game balance in the multiplayer arena. As powerful as the GDI units are, they're slow and seem to be at a distinct disadvantage against the stealthy and disruptive NOD forces, especially the Chemical Missile. In at least one-on-one contests, a well-fortified Nod base hurling Chemical Missiles seems assured of winning almost every time. As much as Westwood seems to want to avoid rushing, it would seem the GDI might have to lean on early assaults to stay in the game. In spite of our concerns on these points, TIBERIAN SUN seems assured of a long, healthy life on the hard drives of gamers. The single-player game is looking extremely solid, with a pair of bruising, incredibly addicting campaigns highlighting the strengths of both factions. Multiplayer contests might be cause for some small worry as the Nod seems to have an edge over the GDI, but the great assortment of units on both sides, a fantastically customizable random map generator, and the hardcore, militaristic flavor of multiplayer combat should create a nonstop flood of games on Westwood Online. The bottom line is simply this: Just days before completion, COMMAND &CONQUER: TIBERIAN SUN is a stronger game than most RTS titles after 15 patches.

Once 40 pages long, the list now contains only a few dozen items. To lead designer Adam Isgreen, and designers John Archer, Michael Lightner, and Patrick Pannullo, it's the telltale sign that COMMAND & CONQUER: TIBERIAN SUN is almost ready to ship. \"We just fixed the bug where the GDI Orca Carryall could use its grappling hook to pick up enemy troops and transport them,\" says Stojsavljevic with a slight grin on his face. The designers all crack up, their laughter spilling into the building's corridors. Down the corridor in his office, Executive Producer Brett Sperry sums it up: \"We're probably going to be done within 48 hours. It's just surreal-four years of our lives and it's all coming down to this.\" For Sperry and his team, building TIBERIAN SUN has been a \"Herculean task,\" commencing just days after the original COMMAND & CONQUER shipped in 1995. Since then, a talented group of programmers, designers, and artists challenged themselves to build a sequel worthy of the C&C name. \"Even the smallest call, like whether the Jump Jet Infantry should be able to be fired upon by Nod lasers, is an incredibly important balance decision, explains Sperry. «We really wanted to reinforce the whole Achilles' heel concept so that every single strategy has a counter strategy others can figure out.\" -Geoffrey Keighley Excerpted from GameSpot's Behind the Games: Tiberian Sun.

"COVER STORY-ESC: TIBERIAN SUN Tactical Advantages ABOMINATION PROFILE M h ere are general strategies for attaining victory in COMMAND & CONQUER: TIBERIAN SUN that will work no matter which side you're playing on, and there are other strategies that take advantage of the unique strengths and abilities of each force. Here's a look at a few tactics and their respective counter-tactics that will have your multiplayer opponents wishing they could join Kane in the land of the living-in-death. RING OF FIRE Set up your waypoint system in a tight ring around your base; you don't want units patrolling large empty areas. THE CIRCLE OF STRIFE (NOD & GDI) This tactic works well as a cheap and flexible defense system, as well as early in a war. Loop a waypoint system around your base and link it up using the shift key. Build a lot of low cost units, machine gunners, disc throwers, and rocket troops. Space groups out evenly, then press (ctrl-alt) to put them in guard mode and send them along on the patrol route so that your base is completely surrounded by troops ready to fire at will. Activating guard SPREAD OUT mode will make them aggressively Try to avoid leaving big assault any nearby enemy. Just gaps in your \"circle of strife,\" for your enemy is telling them to move means they'll sure to exploit them. ignore enemies. Avoid large gaps in the procession; your opponent can time a desperate engineer dash for a vital resource when your guys are clumped on one side of the base. Also note that when a repair bot or a medic is placed on a waypoint system, they will heal and repair your troops as they make the rounds. The tactic works well at the beginning of the game when attacks tend to be more exploratory than all-out assaults. As your enemies climb the tech tree and confront you with more advanced and powerful units. you'll probably be forced to build the more effective permanent ground defenses to repel the attacks. One added benefit to this tactic is that it serves as an early defense system that can immediately be turned to offense if an opportunity arises. The more flexible you keep your force, the better off you'll be. Windows of opportunity open and close quickly in this game, and you need to take advantage of them. Name: Karl Wagner Call Sign: Creepy COUNTER Find gaps in the circle and rush an ON GUARD Setting your troops to engineer though. You guard mode will ensure can also try attacking that they attack intruders, from one side, until all or instead of just continuing most of the members of the on their merry way. circle are concentrating on your diversion, then rush an engineer in on the exposed side. You can also refrain from attacking at all for a while. The circle requires spending a large amount early on for cheap units, money that could have been spent on refineries and harvesters. If your opponent devotes time and resources to the circle, he'll probably fall behind in his development and you'll be able to stay ahead on the tech tree. Skill: Camouflage 19 Personal Details: Recruited by Project Nemesis in 1998, Karl is the son of a German Diplomat living in London. Karl joined the N army and then moved into the SAS in 1993. He was transferred to a special attachment unit and seconded to a SEAL unit out of Kinmore Field in 1997. Karl's entry sinto Project Nemesis was : a result of his never ending quest for adventure; he volunteered for 27 assignment to the project. Download the demo: leidos.com project 101 "

"COVER STORY-CSC: TIBERIAN SUN | . SPECIAL DELIVERY (GDI ONLY) The Orca Carryall is one of GDI's most useful units, if you know how to use it. Build a Mammoth Mark II and airlift it right next to your enemy's construction yard. It can lay waste to the yard in three or four shots of its rail gun. Another good way to use the Carryall is to airlift in an APC full of engineers and take over a base en masse. The Carryall can also place sensor arrays in spots normally unreachable. Efficiently using Carryalls can torment an enemy to no end. Just make sure you know where any SAM sites are and avoid them like the plague. Also, you can't land on a spot that is still cloaked, so some early scouting will be needed. A well balanced air force of Orca fighters to scout an area, Orca bombers to suppress anti-aircraft weapons, and Orca Carryalls to deliver ground units to the landing zone can be formidable indeed. PROFILE es COUNTER SAMS, SAMs, and more SAMs. The best way to make a Carryall-dependent enemy pay is to infest your bases with SAM sites and to knock the Carryall and its cargo out of the sky. Putting SAMS in unexpected places can hamper your opponents' attempt to avoid the flak field above your base by landing close by, and moving in on the ground. Rocket troops and other anti-air units are NEED A LIFT, BIG useful, but nothing does as much damage to a BOY? The Carryall can drop flying unit as a SAM site. heavy units like the Manimoth Mall into the middle of the Nod camp. Cloaking your base helps as well. After you where a single mech can wreak cloak your base, move your Construction some serious havoc in short order. Vehicle so that your Carryall friend won't know where to attack with his Mammoth Mark II. Name: Matt Lansing Call Sign: Savage Skill: Extreme Strength THE DAVID COPPERFIELD (BOTH SIDES) At some point during a battle with Nod forces involved, the Stealth Generator will come into play. It's a frustrating device that makes everything your enemy owns invisible within a certain range. You can uncloak a cloaked base with sensor arrays, or you can take out power generators until the thing turns off. Whatever you do, don't kill the Stealth Generator. If you can commandeer it with an engineer, all of your troops will become cloaked and all the NOW YOU SEE, enemy buildings visible. NOW YOU DON'T AIL Then you can attack it takes is one engineer ferried in with a huge force that's by Carryall to take over a Nod just become invisible. stealth generator, and the next Executing the maneuver thing you know, that invading successfully is one of force has vanished, and your the most satisfying once-invisible structures are moments in any multiexposed like a raisin in the Tiberian sun. player game. COUNTER Immediately destroy all sensor arrays. Without sensor arrays, your attacker should have no idea where your stealth generator is. As an added precaution, build a bunch of laser turrets around your stealth generator so that any engineer who gets anywhere near it will be quickly torched. Sensor arrays have a wide range, so you'll have to make sure you know what's going on around your base. Aircraft on a large waypoint patrol route will keep you updated on what is where. Personal Details: Matt served in the US Marines for 8 years, mostly in \"police\" actions around the world. He was retired from the service in 1995, after he broke his spine in a helicopter crash in the Middle East. He spent the next three years paralyzed from the neck down. Project Nemesis offered Matt the possibility of a surgical solution to his chronic disability; Matt volunteered for the team immediately. Download the demos eidos.com 103 "


"COVER STORY-CSC: TIBERIAN SUN SPREAD IT AROUND (BOTH SIDES) THE GENERAL CUSTER (BOTH SIDES) So, you've finally been able to build up a large assault force, but you're terrified your enemy's EMP cannon will turn your battalion into a fleet of Yugos. The EMP cannon shuts down all mechanized weapons for about two minutes, rendering them useless and vulnerable to attack. Instead of rushing in, go in a few units at a time. Fire up the edges of the base. Attack and withdraw. Keep the torment up until he finally fires the pulse cannon. The cannon takes about four to five minutes to recharge, giving you enough time to rush in and start reducing his beautiful base to rubble. Build a second or third Construction Vehicle as soon as you can. Move them to key points and deploy them. Throw down defenses, refineries, whatever. Then move the Construction Vehicle to another spot and repeat. Put SAM sites under flight lanes. Put a couple obelisks in a choke point. Put a refinery right next to a nice patch of blue tiberium in a remote area of the map. Open as many branch offices as you can and all will be well. COUNTER Don't fire that EMP until you absolutely have to. Have patience and wait until his most powerful units are descending upon your base-then let him have it. Build walls and conventional defenses while he's toying with you and make him pay for the time he's wasting. His massive force is probably nearby, waiting to strike. Find it with air patrols and assault it with weapons like the multi-missile and chemical missile. This might also be a good time to attack his base if he's concentrating all his efforts on HOOK, LINE & yours. With all his big weapons out in SINKER That incoming the field, it would be good to tunnel over force might bait to get you to fire some flame tanks if you're playing Nod, your EMP cannon. The real invaor Orca Carryall over an APC full of sion is coming from the other direction. engineers if you're GDI. COUNTER Construction Vehicles are expensive and not well armored. Take them out as soon as you see them. Also, second and third bases are rarely defended as well as base number one. They are incredibly susceptible to take over with engineers. So, let your expanding friend do all the work for you. Just comman deer his weaker satellite bases, not only will you deprive him of resources, but you'll pad your own coffers as well. ION CRUSH (GDI ONLY) The lon Cannon is immensely powerful, but don't waste it. One blast will not quite destroy crucial buildings like construction yards. Soften structures with conventional attacks, then fin ish them off with a mighty blast. This is a good rule of thumb that can be applied to any long-range, ultra-powerful weapon for both GDI and Nod. Buildings and units can be repaired, so just causing some damage is not good enough. Use these weapons in conjunction with a ground attack or an air raid to make them count. TUNNEL OF LOVE (NOD When using tunneling units, don't just pop them up and let them take fire. Once trouble arrives, burrow below the base and pop up somewhere unex pected. Attack one side of the base, and once you start taking fire, tunnel under and head to the other side. Find the weak spots. The flame tank and the APC don't have the best armor, but the enemy can't hit what's just tunneled underground. COUNTER An engineer running inside a friendly building repairs it completely. If you sense an enemy is softening up a building so he can finish it off with an lon Cannon, run an engineer inside between the ground assault and the lon blast. Repairing buildings to full health with an engineer is sometimes more cost efficient than using the conventional repair command. COUNTER One word: concrete. Tunneling units can't come up through concrete, so build a lot of it around your crucial buildings. If you pave over enough of your property, you'll find that you can funnel the tunneling units into areas you have heavi. ly defended. Don't forget to build plenty of sensor arrays. They see below ground and act as an early warning system for incoming moles. Team I'VE GOT MY ION YOU The ton cannon is a precision weapon, so it is important to first scope out your target, weaken it somewhat, and then quickly drop the hammer before your opponent has a chance to repair it. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN Burrowing tanks can easily slip under your sentries for a direct attack on your base, and once detected can easily burrow away and pop up somewhere else.

"TACTICAL SIMULATION SITUATION REPORT VLBIMUL DELTA FORCE 2 by Raphael Liberatore, Army Special forces, retired ROGUE SPEAR SPEC OPS II: GREEN BERETS ast year, the special-operations shooter took the gaming world by storm. These games I brought realism, special tactics, and true teamplay to a genre that was desperate for new ideas and greater depth of play. With their gritty blend of military-grade weapons and equipment, accuratelymodeled ballistic effects, and real-world small-unit commando tactics and missions, games like RAINBOW SIX, SPEC OPS: RANGERS LEAD THE WAY, and DELTA FORCE led the rush toward an exciting new subgenre of action games. In computer gaming, success breeds sequels and imitators, so it's no surprise that Fall will bring several more games into the tactical simulation battlefield. With NovaLogic's DELTA FORCE 2, Red Storm's ROGUE SPEAR, Zombie's SPEC OPS II: GREEN BERETS, and Sierra's SWAT 3: CLOSE QUARTERS BATTLE all in development, there will be plenty of special-ops options for the armchair killer. We took these games out into the field and tested them with a team of genuine special-operations guys to see which had what it takes to survive the battle for gamers' bucks. SWAT 3: CLOSE QUARTERS BATTLE OPERATIONS OVERVIEW What set RAINBOW SIX apart from the throng of firstperson shooters crowding the market? Red Storm would say it was the realistic combat model. After playing a beta version of ROGUE SPEAR, the sequel to RAINBOW SIX, we can report that the combat model is still the strong point. ROGUE SPEAR's refinements of the original include improved artificial intelligence, better graphics and sound, realistic ballistic effects, an improved interface, and an observer mode. Not only do computer-controlled team members move and support your actions with more effect, but nearby terrorists actively seek you out during a raging battle. Add some really awesome ballistic and wound effects, like shooting through windows and doors, or taking a round in the leg that will leave a trail of blood, and it's clear that ROGUE SPEAR is on track to becoming a more true-to-life game. The same goes for SWAT 3: CLOSE QUARTERS BATTLE, the latest addition to the already popular Sierra Studios SWAT adventure series. Based on real-life SWAT missions of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). but set in the year 2005, the game casts you as the leader of a five-man team in either career or single-play. er modes. SWAT 3's dynamic missions focus on highintensity close-quarters combat instead of the puzzlesolving of its predecessors.

Mission Shortfalls: Separate multiplayer release. ers trained with the LAPD SWAT; the resulting tactical realism is apparent, for example, in the way your team systematically sweeps an area for suspects. In DELTA FORCE 2, you continue to serve as a member of the elite U.S. Army Special Forces unit known as SFOD-Delta DF2 now uses a true 32-bit Voxel Space graphics engine so players can actually see the enemy, instead of nondescript pixels, at 200 meters. The upgraded graphics are smooth and crisp, though the buildings pixelate up close and would benefit from 3D acceleration. Still, the vast outdoor environments are second to none in subtle detail and now have tall grass, trees, and other objects use. ful for stealth maneuvers. According to Mark Long, head honcho of SPEC OPS developer Zombie, \"We want players to feel like they're actually Green Berets.\" To that end, Zombie completely rebuilt its SPEC OPS Viper engine while adding a fluid in-game control for a more dynamic team-oriented combat experience. There are over 30 real-life special forces missions stressing Green Beret teamwork for direct action, special reconnaissance, and hostage rescue operations. SPEC OPS II follows its predecessor in using teams of two and three members to enhance gameplay, even though a U.S. Army Special Forces \"A\" team has 12 men. The simulated men do, however, train and fight like real Green Berets, with obstacle courses modeled after real Army training courses, and their skill development in weapons, demolitions, recon, and sniper tactics shadow the real deal. All these titles share one common gameplay element: missions based on realistic military or paramilitary commando operations at the tactical level, aimed at direct action, counterterrorism, hostage rescue, and special reconnaissance. One thing is certain-all the developers have done their homework, as the level of authenticity is quite high. Whether it's SPEC OPS II's co-op mission with the British SAS to address a Pakistani nuclear situation, or SWAT 3's terrorist takeover of the control tower at LAX, the action is gritty and authentic. SWAT 3 QUICK DRAW in SWAT 3. good reflexes and sound tactics will be crucial to surviving standoffs like this one. You'll also have to deal with the added challenge of not shooting-first-and-askingquestions-later, since you're prohibited from shooting civilians. ROGUE SPEAR SNIPER CROUCH ROGUE SPEAR has added crouched movement and sniper support for a more comprehensive team assault. TEAM SELECTION Team command and control is an important element in these games, since most operations depend on support from your computer-controlled teammates for success. The flawed AI in ROGUE SPEAR has been measurably improved. \"There were a lot of rough edges to the original AI,\" says Greg Stelmack of Red Storm. \"We took the lessons learned from the original AI, scrapped it, and rewrote it from the ground up. The computer-controlled members navigate much more cleanly, and their combat routines have been improved. They'll duck for cover, run away, try to avoid grenades, and generally act much more human than the origiSPEC OPS 11 nal AI.\" DELTA FORCE 2 and SPEC OPS II have also beefed up team AI to better support you (your SPEC OPS teammates shouldn't wander into your line of fire anymore) All four games have refined their team command and control screens for bet IT TAKES TWO To kill tangoes, ter team response during that is. SPEC OPS II has distilled the usual the heat of battle. Each 12-man Green Beret teams to smaller units approach is unique. SPEC for more manageable gameplay. OPS II uses a single keystroke to dispatch operatives to a location, without your having to micromanage their maneuvers. DELTA FORCE 2 uses a Commander's Screen and waypoints to control Al teammates. ROGUE SPEAR has streamlined its team mission screens for better planning and rule-of-engagement management. And SWAT 3 lets you split your five-man element into two smaller elements to better sweep an area for bad guys. Only DELTA FORCE 2 won't allow you to select team operatives. SPEC OPS II WHERE'S THE LIGHTS? SPEC OPS Il's Viper engine will spice up the game action with its realistic but ominous environments. OCTOBER 1999  www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

ROGUE SPEAR and SWAT 3 look really sharp, SWAT 3 having the edge with more impressive graphics and physics modeling. Sierra used over 500 motion-capture videos for very lifelike SWAT 3 character movement. SPEC OPS II's updated Viper engine powers its ominous outdoor environments, 3D sounds, and outstanding lighting effects, including realistic searchlights that seek to pinpoint your position and alert the enemy.

Of the four, DELTA FORCE still uses the largest outdoor environments for endless patrolling maneuvers; the new game employs indoor environments as well, for hostage rescue and reconnaissance. SWAT 3D is the lone holdout on the inclusion of weather effects, but since the game takes place indoors, it's not an issue. The other games add most of their weather touches for ambience, but DF2's use of fog should help balance sniper-favoring multiplayer matches. DELTA FORCE 2 INSIDE, OUTSIDE NovaLogic's Voxel 3 Space engine has been upgraded to offer true 32-bit graphics. The payoff is even better outdoor environments and weather effects, and missions that move the action indoors. ROGUE SPEAR BATTLE DRILLS The arsenals from these games are bulging with more weapons and equipment than ever before.

SWAT 3 uses the traditional LAPD arsenal of MP5s, CAR-15s, and 1911 pistols, while adding new technology like the Kevlar tactical helmet. DELTA FORCE 2, on the other hand, adds unique weapons like the H&K P11(which fires flechettes underwater), an M4 with shotgun, and fixed weapon emplacements sporting mini-guns. SPEC OPS II added some unique weapons like Chicoms, M270s, Steyr Augs, and some of the heavier stuff like grenade launchers and machine guns. Picking your team's flashlights, light sticks, binoculars, tac vests, and grenades add to game strategy. DF2 now uses equipment slots in addition to primary weapon slots so you can choose Kevlar vests, rebreathers for underwater action, and field surveillance cameras for watching your back. SPEC OPS II allows you to pick up and drop objects during the game, which is good if you run out of ammo and an AK-47 happens to be laying nearby, but bad if you get too greedy and weighed down. Shot placement and ballistic effects are heavily emphasized in all four games. Not only do most weapons have a choice of rounds, but bullets now penetrate doors and walls (and DELTA FORCE's previously bulletproof tents). ROGUE SPEAR handles ballistic effects by assigning modifying values to weapons, so you can't snipe with an FIRST CLASS TICKET TO HELL Hostage rescue is a ROGUE SPEAR mission specially.

MP5 from 200 meters without the 9mm round losing energy at point of impact. You'll need to use the right weapon for the job at all times. Likewise, wound effects will force you to aim your shots more accurately. Each game models wounds according to their location on a character; if the hit is in the arm or leg, the character limps and leaves a trail of blood. OPERATIVE: BLACKHAWK SPEC OPS EXPERIENCE. Retired U.S. Army Special Forces Operations and Intelligence Sergeant, and police arson-explosives investigator. Served with U.S. Army SF during the Vietnam War. Current investigator for a large metropolitan district attorney's office. EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT HIM. Place flash bangs in a room by edging as close to the opening as possible without compromising yourself, and then drop them inside the door for more effective placement H-HOUR Multiplayer is where these games really shine. If you're looking for a frag-fest, look to DELTA FORCES 2 and SPEC OPS II, both of which support 50-player matches. ROGUE SPEAR and SWAT 3 can be played as a realistic tactical simulation, because team command and control and support are vital to mission success SPEC OPS II will allow you to pick up a fallen enemy's weapons and equipment, while DF2 is adding the option of an armory for its online action. The armory will let the gamer restock weapons and ammo and will be the only destructible building in the game-expect to see teams lead armory-destroying charges against their enemies. Typing commands during battle takes too long and leaves you vulnerable, so voice support is on most gamers' wish lists. SWAT 3 and SPEC OPS II have no plans to support voice right now-not surprising, considering how hard it is to do it right. Hopefully, Red Storm will improve the shoddy voice technology of RAINBOW SIX. NovaLogic has the leg up on voice technology with its Voice-Over-Net, already working well on the NovaWorld servers, but it's not the ideal solution; it allows communication with only one player at a time rather than your entire team. OPERATIVE: DOG SOLDIER SPEC OPS EXPERIENCE Current U.S. Army Special Forces Commo and Operations and Intelligence Sergeant in the Army National Guard. Qualified for specops tactics and target interdiction. EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT HIM. Engage moving targets by leading them slightly ahead of their movement direction with your firing reticle. Also, try not to silhouette yourself along a hilltop or skyline. AFTER ACTION REPORT Without a doubt, all four tactical simulations are looking sharper and more immersing than the originals, and at this point there seems to be no clear victor emerging from the trenches. But I'd bet a few weekend passes to Vienna that ROGUE SPEAR follows in RAINBOW SIX's footsteps as the benchmark game of this new crop of tactical sims, while DELTA FORCE 2 will come in a close second. The popularity of NovaWorld gives DF2 a huge boost for quick action seekers. When SWAT 3's multiplayer feature gets released-several months after single player-the game should be a heavy-duty combatant due to its realistic environments and COB combat. SPEC OPS II is the underdog of the bunch, having to fight its way out of the bad reputation earned by its lackluster predecessor. However, don't count this game out. Its interface and AI upgrades are a huge improvement, and besides, it's a game about Green Berets. What more could an armchair commando ask for?

Moving closer anly narrows any chance of escape once the enemy pinpoints your emplacement. hresh versus a real Green Beret who wins? It's this kind of question that led us to match up our team of real-life, battle-hardened, special-forces veterans against the development teams of DELTA FORCE 2 and ROGUE SPEAR. With four commandos at my side and over 50 collective years of real experience under our tac, vests I felt somewhat confident squaring off against the NovaLogic team. However, after the first team deathmatch it was obvious that NovaLogic was having a field day, dropping real-life commandos like fattened ducks on the first day of hunting season. While ISP and communication problems hampered the effectiveness of the pros, there's no way to candy-coat the fact that our team got whomped, 50 kills to 20. Still, there was some satisfaction in knowing that any one member of our team could easily kill all four members of NovaLogic's squad with his bare hands. More ISP trouble prohibited two of our spec-ops operatives from joining in the ROGUE SPEAR CONtest, but SF Commando and. Mad Dog did their best in holding off a skilled Red Storm team. At one point, Mad Dog took out an entire four-man team rushing through the door. The results of this matchup were much better than the odious NovaLogic battle, with our team winning four out of six matches, even though outnumbered four to two. It's a great testament to the authenticity of the game that our real-world training and tactics gave us the edge over the twitch skills of the game developers.

"FOOTBALL ROUNDUP KILL YOUR TV! WITH THIS SEASON'S LINEUP OF FOOTBALL GAMES, THE PC IS THE PLACE TO BE FOR THE MONSTER HITS, THE CLUTCH PLAYS, AND THE BIG THRILL OF GAME DAY. BY GEORGE JONES IS FOOTBALL The year 1999 marks the beginning of the fourth era of PC football games. In the first era, we talked about text football games, and which ones best simulated the real deal. The second erathe era of FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL-had us gushing over pretty graphics and great coaching options, while simultaneously complaining that if only the controls weren't so cruddy, we'd actually be able to play the game. Then we entered the third era. Here we could finally play football games on our PC, but the graphics missed the 3D boat and the gameplay was still a long way off from that of the best PlayStation games. With the upcoming release of MADDEN 2000 and NFL FEVER 2000, we have now entered the football Age of Aquarius, marked by a harmonious blending of visuals, animations, and gameplay. It's a groovy time to be alive, brother. ST.

"FOOTBALL ROUNDUP SHOTGUN DEEP POST toward the TV viewing experience. This year's game strikes a perfect balance between arcade action and strategic play by offering several different game modes. The Arcade mode gives you a run-and-gun shootout, while the Exhibition and Season modes allow for a more authentic simulation. The previous few incarnations of the game featured tough run-stopping defenses, but MADDEN 2000 makes the running game more viable. While I wasn't breaking away for 10 yards a carry, neither was I consistently stuffed for a loss every time my backs touched the ball. The passing game and Madden NFL 2000 defense are excellently 9 Amazing visuals and animations; superior handled, as gameplay that strikes the right balance; a myriad usual, with the typical of cool new features like the Great Games and set of special moves Franchise modes; LAN and Internet play. enhancing your game.

If you happen to get fired, you can get picked up by another franchise...if anyone wants you. THE LONGEST YARD ADDEN 2000 anticipated our wishes and added one of the coolest features I've ever iseen in a sports game: The Great Games mode allows you to replay key moments in 10 different legendary games. The first is the 1981 overtime game between the San Diego Chargers and the Miami Dolphins that saw the Chargers score with less than three minutes left in overtime (and carry legendary tight end Kellen Winslow off the field). As you win each scenario, you gain permanent access to the two teams involved and you move on to the next Great Game. It's kind of like beating \"bosses\" in a fighting game. At the end of the day, gameplay rules over all, but it's these little touches that keep MADDEN consistently ahead of the pack. From the look of things, MADDEN will head that pack again this year. And, for what some may argue is the very first time, MADDEN 2000 for the PC will make console owners green with envy.

But this has been the lot of the Redmond giant ever since they broke into the sports-game game. NFL FEVER 2000 leans toward a more realistic style of play than MADDEN. From the moment you take the field, it is an eyebrow-raising experience-the game's graphics are as close to TV quality as we've ever seen. Whereas EA Sports' graphics are more muscularly exaggerated and beety, NFL FEVER's players resemble human players. And the player animations are absolutely stupendous. NEL FEVER, which uses a default camera angle that is a little further behind the line of scrimmage than most games, successfully mimics the pacing of football. When a play begins, it takes some time to develop, but once it does, the action comes swiftly. For example, on a roll-out pass play, I was able to make the proper reads on the defense and my receivers, but I couldn't hold onto the ball forever-the pass rush was on me in no time.

"SPORTS I BACING REVIEW NEED FOR SPEED: HIGH STAKES Is a Dream of a Racing Game GAMING EDITORS Auto Eroticism CHOICE SLIPPERY WHEN WET Driving with the weather turned on can be quite a challenge, especially with all the eye-candy distractions. Tec 1:24.28 EED FOR SPEED: HIGH STAKES is a racing enthusiast's dream. With a new financial model, new exotic cars, over a dozen tracks, and more racing modes than a Ferrari has gears, this game truly has something for everyone. Sporting an absolutely beautiful engine that is balanced nicely between arcade and simulation, NFS:HS is a blast to drive. With a number of new sin. gleand multiplayer enhancements, it's easily the best ver sion yet of this stellar racing series. NEED FOR SPEED: HIGH STAKES Awash in a Sea of Options HIGH STAKES offers so many different racing modes it borders on ridiculous. There are well over a dozen tracks that can be run normally, backwards, mirrored, or mirrored and backwards. There are 13 cars to choose from, with new cars available for download on the Web (www.earacing.com). The new career mode is an awesome addition to single. reviewed by Greg Fortune player gameplay, featuring a financial model that requires you to win circuits of several races to advance. As you win, you'll earn money that you can use to repair your vehicle or to upgrade to a better car. The Hot Pursuit races (introduced last time around) are still a blast, especially when the police use coordinated tactics to trip you up. Then again, I really also available as multiplayer options, so you can get online with your friends and play \"cops and robbers,\" run a single race or a tourna. ment, or race for pink slips. The game is supposed to let you participate in a beta test for EA's upcoming Internet racing, but as of press time in late July, EA still hadn't gotten that running. WHICH WAY DID HE GO, GEORGE? The replays are great to watch and to point out where you blew your line (and why that tree ate your car). Let's Rock The most amazing thing here besides the tremendous selection of racing modes is how well they are all executed. There are no turkeys here. Whether you want to outrun the police, be the police, race alone or in a pack, you will not be disappointed. The Al opponents are challenging, but not invincible. The tracks are beautiful, well designed, and fun to race again and again. The cars' driving model is a perfect blend of a simulation and an arcade game made even better with stellar force feedback effects. The result is cars that behave the way you'd expect them to in varied conditions, without being so pure that the game is inaccessible to novice drivers. A note to the purists out there: You aren't going to be able to micromanage your cars in NFS:HS. You can buy upgrades to your cars to affect acceleration, braking and handling, and that's about it. But as far as I'm concerned, if I wanted to adjust the toe-in on my front wheels, I'd be out working in an alignment shop not playing computer games. CGW RATED PROS Beautiful engine; awesome track selection; lots of cars; more racing modes than you can shake a stick shift at. enjoyed being the police and getting to drop a spike strip in the path of a $100,000 McLaren F1. Call it envy if you like. Honestly, I could think of only one race that was left out a demolition derby and using a Ferrari for that seems pretty stupid anyway. The good news, in any case, is that you can damage these cars now though the effect is more a cosmetic one than one you'll notice on the track. All of the single-player modes are The Final Lap Where other publishers would have split this much gameplay into a game and two expansion packs, EA once again delivers a product that offers more than anyone could have expected.

"REVIEW ACTION Kill Your Way to the Top in Xantrix's Shooter Blood on the Streets KINGPIN: LIFE OF CRIME he role of brutality in art and entertainment has STREET SMART The NPCs may not be the brightest thugs on been argued over at least since Plato, and the phethe planet. but they will help you take down enemies like this. nomenon itself is, of course, older still. Nothing in Saving Private Ryan is more brutal than the descriptions of battle in The Iliad, heaven knows. And nothing in a modern computer game is, either. Yet the arguments rage on, especially in the wake of a senseless modern tragedy like the shootings in Littleton, Colorado earlier this year. Games like Xatrix's KINGPIN do little to calm things down. Set in an urban environment peopled with thugs and junkies, KINGPIN is one long killing spree punctuated with occasional puzzle solving. The plot is opaque at besta throwaway about one thug seeking revenge against a bunch of others and the action is reviewed by Charles Ardai bloody in the extreme. Toss in a soundtrack by bad-boy rappers Cypress Hill and lots of explicit, gory visuals and what you've got is a poster boy for the anti-DOOM crowd. But here's the snag: the game is actually quite good. Not perfect, no but so much better than the average first-person shooter that no objective observer could fail to see it. So what is a gamer to do? If the level of gore disturbs you more than the quality of the game entices you, you don't have to put the disk in the drive, and you don't have to let your kids play it either. (There's also a \"low violence\" mode, if you're the sort of person who likes halfway steps.) But for the many of us, KINGPIN has enough to offer that it more than makes up for the more egre. THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A MARK A sample of the game's most extreme vio gious excesses of which the game is guilty. Hence Sent to rescue a mohster's kidnapped girlfriend, you find her with her head chopped off. Pipe Dreams To set the tone, the game opens with not one but two savage beatings. The first you receive; the second you inflict. Your first weapon is a length of lead pipe, found in an alley. With money scavenged from your victims' pockets you buy your second, a crowbar, which you then use to beat up a couple of rent-a-cops guarding a warehouse. This gets you a shotgun, which you use inside the CGW RATED warehouse. And so on, through level after level of increasingly fastPROS paced combat against Suspenseful and foes ranging from ordinary street toughs results.

"REVIEW On The Defensive How scared are game designers and publishers about the new antiviolence backlash? Plenty, judging from this \"editorial\" by KINGPIN designer Drew Markham which all new users must read before completing their installation: vast majority of what you do). KEEPING IT UN-REAL For all its gritty realism, Each sequence contains goals KINGPIN does stray from the real world with some of its beyond the killing, and attaining Towlifes-a hard life and drugs have scarred this girl's arms with those goals requires creativity countless sores but her tremendous breasts have miraculously flourished in this rough environment. on the player's part.

There are also various problems after all, how many shooters have any real with the graphics (enemies vanishing into story at all?

How many But this sort of micro-criticism, though times can the word \"fuck\" be used in a sin valid, is a distraction, much as abstract critigle sentence? More than you can imagine. cism of the game's level of violence is. What makes KINGPIN SO satis. fying is that it succeeds in immersing you in an environment, much more than most other games have. As stunning as HALF-LIFE is, for example, I've never felt as deeply immersed in its locations as did in the impeccably rendered and convincingly familiar city streets of KINGPIN. And as scary as HALF-LIFE's headcrabs are, KINGPIN's filthy rats and DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH Whether it's vicious dogs and even more vats of molten steel, sweeping twilight skies, or just the con Vicious humans gave me a more vincing granularity of the brick textures, KINGPIN is one of the visceral jolt. most graphically striking and believable games you've seen. KINGPIN offers an effective and memorable thrill ride, well paced and well designed. More than that I don't believe is fair to demand. When did we start expecting to get our models of moral conduct from our computer games? All I can say is that you won't find any here. But if what you're looking for is a compelling piece of entertainment, that you will find. Assuming your stomach is as strong as your trigger finger is fast, KINGPIN will blow you away. CGW In light of the recent acts of youth-related violence that have taken place across America we thought that you should know how KINGPIN was initially conceived. KINGPIN was never intended for children. This is a game with mature themes made for a mature audience. There was never any attempt to market or influence children to buy KINGPIN. In fact, magazines in which advertise ments ran were carefully selected to only have an adult audience. We also took special care to insure that the \"Mature\" rating appeared very prominently on the package as well as within the game. As the creator of KINGPINI sought to make something that would appeal to a mature audience. My influences in making this game were mostly cinematic, and I wanted to explore those themes and share them with other adults who have similar tastes. As a parent, I also realize what my role is in protecting my child from influences that might have a disturbing effect. I certainly do not consider KINGPIN appropriate fare for my child, but I cannot sit back and hope that the government or some public interest groups will protect her; that responsibility is up to my wife and myself alone. As soon as we as a society abdicate our personal responsibility towards protecting and caring for our children we give up our basic freedoms as Americans; freedoms that have been hard fought and even harder won. As parents, we must look into our own backyards and see what our children are doing and become more personally involved with their activities, ideas and friends. www.planetkingpin.com The premier news site for KINGPINrelated happenings.

The flight and weapons model ing, enemy artificial intelligence and linear campaign layout can't hold a candle to the detail of other F-16 games like FALCON 4.0. On the other hand, F. 16 AGGRESSOR is a well-designed title for less demanding fliers, especially those just beginning to experiment with flight sims. F-16: AGGRESSOR C209 Africa On $900,000 A Day The storyline casts you in the role of Reyas, commander of a mercenary F-16 squadron under the direction of a shadowy CIA operative known as O Icarus, who uses the Aggressors against Maldonado, the typical evil drug lord bent on world dominance.

"REVIEW views\" to quickly scan outside the aircraft is a major oversight. This \"straight ahead through the HUD\" emphasis once again underscores the entry-level aspect of this sim, since most vets keep their heads on a swivel. COME IN HEADQUARTERS! Nicely detailed ground structures populate a high level of the airbases but you'll rarely get close enough to appreciate the view. Targeting is done success in with simplified controls at long range. moderately difficult situations. F-16 AGGRESSOR does a particu larly good job with graphics.

The only compensate. The one major gripe against the concern is to be well inside your particular visuals is the pilot's view options. There are a weapon's range when you shoot; you'll rarely slewable view and nine \"keypad\" fixed views miss. If you're not a hard-core flight simmer, that, with the exception of the HUD view, focus these features make the game fun to play, with mainly inside the cockpit. The lack of \"snap Debriefing Taken as an entry-level flight sim, AGGRESSOR gets the job done. The interface is simple to navigate, the aircraft is easy to fly and fight, success is not difficult to achieve, and multiplayer options allow the competitive instinct to run free. These are the things that will draw a beginner deeper into the realm of flight. But other elementsmore interaction and depth in the storyline, a dynamic campaign, and greater emphasis on the economic aspects of a mercenary operation-would more fully absorb the player.

Such a view would seem ideal for portraying the chaotic scene aboard a man of war during the Age of Sail. Unfortunately, MAN OF WAR II's \"full-immersion view\" can be both confusing and antiseptic, voiding its advantages. MAN OF WAR II's full-view shows the decks of five types of Warships. Using the cursor, you move your view from the stern up to the bow. * * The graphics show nearby vessels well, but something is noticeably absent: everything. You're on a ghost ship! There are no guns, no crew, and no standing rigging, which might be acceptable if other aspects of the view worked well. Unfortunately, maneuvering around the deck and down the companionways reminds me of a bad first-person game with the main mast as obstacle. Worse, the control console surrounds the view, diminishing the \"immersion\" effect. Finally, the virtual captain is invulnerable, immune to shot and impervious to boarding actions. The game is not entirely without merit. The gunnery model, multiplayer game, and fleet actions are handled quite well. But MOWII makes it only halfway to a decent sequel. It is an improvement on its prede. cessor, but the designers are still hampered by the original game engine. Jim Cobb pounding missions and appear to be modeled correctly.

"HARDWAR IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE REVIEWS NEWS CPU Shoot-out Intel Pentium III vs. AMD Athlon T by Dave Salvator and Loyd Case It's high noon in the fight for the fastest chip in gaming. Backed by its posse of he landscape was littered with the burnt CPU chips of those who dared challenge the mighty Intel. National Semiconductor had thrown in the towel, selling off Cyrix, its CPUmaking arm. IDT and Rise struggled to gain a foothold at the low end of the market, where Intel's Celeron could squarely outgun them in price/performance. Finally, one last challenger remained that posed any kind of threat: AMD. AMD's K6-2 and KO-III processors had fared well against the juggernaut, but always lacked comparable floating-point performance, a key consideration for gamers seeking optimal 3D performance. But AMD had a trick up its sleeve: the K7, AMD's 7th generation chip. And for the first time, Intel had a fight on its hands. The K7 has arrived under a new banner, Athlon, and this new CPU is taking no prisoners. Bloodied by repeated price wars with Intel's Celeron and Pentium II, AMD is hoping to use Athlon to reverse its fortunes and start dealing some blows of its own. AMD is in a must-win situation, since it cannot afford another war of attrition with Intel, whose manufacturing and market share leave it in better stead to wage such war. But even if Athlon can win the performance battle, it hasn't won the war. Intel, who sits on 80 percent of the CPU market, is not going to go down easily. Intel is firmly entrenched with system makers-not only with its CPUs, but also with system chipsets, motherboards, and numerous industry standards that it defines (PCI, AGP, USB). AMD faces the challenge of besting Intel's chip performance, and also of delivering CPUs in quantity, along with stable, compatible system chipsets and motherboard reference designs. But we must now set these weighty issues aside and address the biggest question of all: Who now has the best gaming CPU out there? standards and computer manufacturers, Intel's got lots of muscle. But it no longer has the fastest gun. AMDA Athlon AMDA And the Winner Is... Fellow gamers, we find ourselves at a historic moment. This shoot-out marks the very first time that Intel hasn't come out on top as the best gaming CPU. That's right folks, read it now and let it sink in later: Athlon bests Pentium III clock for clock. For those in the love-to-hateIntel camp, it is a time of much rejoicing. For Intel devotees, it's time to sit back and ask \"what the hell happened?\" For over a year now, Intel has been using their Pentium II core to cover the three main CPU market segments: low end, mainstream, and workstation/server. The Pentium III brought us SSE, those special instructions that help make 3D games go faster, but that aside, this CPU core hasn't fundamentally changed since Pentium Pro. Meanwhile, AMD has introduced two generations of CPUs: first the K6, and now Athlon. With Athlon, AMD is going for the jugular with a CPU that outguns Pentium III on integer and, more importantly, 10 H O CTOBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "


"HARDWARE GADGETS FOR GAMERS There Can Only Be One uns were drawn, bits were fired, and when the smoke cleared, there was only one chip standing: the AMD Athlon. The Athlon matched or exceeded the Pentium IIl's performance in nearly every benchmarking face-off. In one of the most important areas of chip performance for games, floating-point math, the Athlon posted significantly better marks than the Pentium III. But speed is not everything in the chip game: There's the price, and then there's delivery of the chip in sufficient How Much Faster Is It? quantity to match demand. Intel is sure to best AMD AMD Athlon 600 43% faster in price, and there's some doubt about AMD's ability Pentium III 600 31% faster to deliver chips in quantity. So if you want the ultiPentium III 500 0% faster mate chip for gaming performance, look to the Athlon, but expect to pay a Pentium II 450+ baseline premium and to do some \"Posting-point performance as measured by ZU's WeBench FPUMrk.

This AM/FM/CD in-dash stereo sports a 35-watt, four-channel by Denny Atkin amp, as well Directions floating-point mathematics performance. As you'll see from our tests, the results are faster benchmark scores and, most importantly, faster game performance. In just about every game we threw at these CPUs, Athlon was either faster than or equal to Pentium III at the same clock rate, which is no small feat for AMD. So AMD has taken Round 1, the performance battle. But it must also win the war of delivery, manufacturing these speedy CPUs in quantity along with solid chipsets and compatible motherboards. And that, despite Athlon's superior performance, could still trip up AMD. tional Pentium III CPUs, since Intel's next generation Pentium III-code-named Copperminewill have 256KB of L2 cache right on the chip running at the chip's full clock speed, and it's rumored that Coppermine will use a socket format. The current Pentium III's cache bus and system bus are actually separate (Intel calls this design Dual Independent Bus), allowing cache access to be executed separately from system memory access. There is 32KB of Level 1 (L1) cache, separated into a 16KB instruction cache and a 16KB data cache. Contrast this with Athlon's 64KB instruction cache and 64KB data cache, for 128KB total L1 cache. Like the Athlon, the 600MHZ Pentium III uses a 0.25-micron manufacturing process, so cooling fans are a must at this frequency.

"HARDWARE How We Tested ing 3D graphics transformations and lighting goes by the sexy acronym SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions). SSE works with single precision (32bit) floating point instructions and can operate on up to four pieces of data in a single cycle. Some of the new instructions also speed up memory transfers, particularly transfers of graphics data. The Road Ahead Until now, Pentium II/III's strong suit has been its X87 floating-point performance. This fast floatingpoint unit (FPU) handles transform and lighting (T/L) calculations in 3D graphics, making Intel CPUS optimal for gaming. Despite the existence of fast 3D cards and even SSE, it's been the FPU that's done the transform and lighting calculations in 3D games. With respect to floating-point performance (once Intel's ace in the hole), Intel now trails Athlon's new and improved FPU. The now-venerable 440BX chipset is another limitation. The entire front-side bus-both access to the North Bridge (the circuitry through which the CPU talks to system memory) and from the North Bridge to the system memory bus-runs at 100MHz. AMD's chipset accesses its North Bridge at 200MHZ. By this time, we expected to see both the Coppermine CPU and Intel's 820 chipset on the market, complete with faster bus access and RAMBUS DRAM (RDRAM), but the 820 chipset has been delayed.

Willamette, but Source: PriceWatch it isn't due to surface until the second half of 2000. Rather than just another incremental evolution, Willamette will involve a substantial rearchitecting of Intel's CPU core. It will still be a 32-bit architecture like current chips (called IA-32) but will likely deliver great increases both in integer and floating-point performance. Intel will be more than a year behind AMD in delivering their 7th generation chip, giving AMD a fighting chance. More near term, we've heard that Intel will be adding its SSE instruction set into a lower-cost Celeron product, though Intel is still keeping mum, so we don't have a release date as yet. n testing CPUs, there are three performance areas to consider: integer (whole numbers), floating-point (decimal numbers), and floatingpoint SIMD (the ability to work on multiple pieces of data at once). To test integer performance, we ran WinBench's CPU Mark99, which simulates the integer workload generated by leading business applications. To evaluate floatingpoint performance, we used a combination of tests: WinBench's FPU Mark and our own 3D GameGauge, which uses games that make heavy demands on the CPU's floating-point unit to do transform and lighting of 3D graphics. To evaluate FP SIMD (Intel's SSE versus AMD's 3D Now), we again used a combination of tests. 3D WinBench has two tests to evaluate CPU performance running Direct3D's transform and lighting (T/L) engine. One tests the speed of doing just transforms, while the other tests both transform and lighting performance. But there's a technical issue that we need to cover here, so brace yourself. If you're not into techie detail, just know that Athlon still wins the FP SIMD contest and move on. Direct3D has a feature called guard-band clipping, a process that determines which part of an object at the edge of the screen is on or off the screen. We tested with guard-band clipping enabled, so that this function How They Stack up was performed by Intel's SSE and Performance Results for AMD's 3D Now. The Athlon vs. Pentium III two architectures delivered roughly the same perfor56.1 mance, though AMD is a bit faster. But in 43.8 transform performance alone, AMD is much faster, to the tune of about 65 percent. This is important, because games are more likely to use the transform part of D3D's T/L engine, rather than both transform and lighting, since Winbench 99 1.1 CPUMark lighting in a game is what gives it a 3260 distinct look and 2980 feel. Game developers in the past have written their 2500 awn T/L engines to achieve their own unique look. But of the two, lighting is what brings the unique look/feel, where as transforms (the movement of polygons from scene to scene) is a more generic Winbench 99 1.1 FPUMark process. Pentium III GOOM HZ Atlalon GOMEZ Pentium 111 500MHz AMD Athlon 600MHz: Welcome to the Winner's Circle We had been hearing rumblings about Athlon's performance potential, and we wanted to believe. But given our past experiences with AMD CPUS, we were skeptical as to whether AMD could really pull it off. Well, they did. And as it turns out, not only do they beat Intel at the same clock rate, but they'll most likely have a 650MHz Athlon shipping before Intel ships a 600MHz Pentium III. What really impressed us wasn't just AMD's clock-for-clock performance versus Intel, but the system's stability as well.

"HARDWARE How We Tested (continued) 91.1 77.6 Pentium III Athlon 600 Pentium III 3D Winbench Transform & Lighting * 211 91.1 brought Athlon to its knees. In each of the three main performance categories-integer, floating-point, and FP SIMDAthlon scored a knockout. In the 3DNow versus SSE battle for FP SIMD superiority, AMD once again bested Intel. We used 3D WinBench's Transform and Transform and Lighting tests, which measure the CPU's ability to crank out triangles in Direct3D (see How We Tested). We then turned to three games that have been optimized both for SSE and 3DNow: POWERSLIDE, DESCENT 3, and EXPENDABLE. Running at a lower resolution of 640x480 to shift the workload more onto the CPU, Athlon trounced Pentium III by 20 percent on average. And in looking at 3D GameGauge results running at 1024x768 (our standard test resolution), Athlon was still 10 percent faster. So now Intel finds itself in the unusual position of giving up the performance lead across the board (integer, floating-point, floating-point SIMD). Since it can't win this round on performance, Intel will no doubt play the price card, dropping prices on the Pentium III to maintain a price/performance advantage, a strategy that has served it so well in the Celeron-versus-KO-III battle. So the 64-gigabyte Question is: Given that AMD now has the performance edge, what will their pricing look like? As you can see from The Price War table of press-time street prices, AMD is pricing Athlon slightly higher than a Pentium III of the same speed, but not substantially so. At press time, there was some concern that AMD might not be able to meet consumer demand for their new performance champ, leaving gamers and system makers scrambling to lay hands on this hot new chip. AMD is in the process of building a new \"fab\" (chip factory) in Dresden, Germany, but it's not yet online. We'll keep you posted on availability as we hear more news on this front. CGW We then did a series of game tests at a lower resolution (640x480x16) because the 3D card becomes much less of a bottleneck at this resolution; it draws the scene much faster, and shifts the processing burden back toward the CPU. We also tested using six games, including three (POWERSLIDE, DESCENT 3, and EXPENDABLE) that have optimizations build into them for both FP SIMD architectures. To round out the mix, we added QUAKE II, HALF-LIFE, and BATTLEZONE 2. Athlon again won the day, its performance about 19 percent faster on average. Our test systems were as identical as we could make them, except for motherboard and CPU. Common components included a clean install of Windows 98SE, DirectX 6.1a, 128MB of SDRAM, a 32MB TNT2 Ultra graphics card (chip clock 150MHz, memory clock 183MHz) running nVidia's 2.04 reference drivers, a Soundblaster Live sound card, and EIDE storage components. We included Pentium III results to serve as a baseline for comparison. Pentium ili Athlon 630 Pentium Ill 3D Winbench 99 Transform * B2EE 61.1 58.7 50.7 Rome Wasn't Built...

AMD's situation won't be quite that bad, but the company faces an uphill battle with motherboard makers and systems suppliers if they want Athlon to have a wide market penetration. Intel currently ships about 60 percent of all motherboards in the world. Companies like Dell, Gateway, and others depend on Intel motherboards in their high-end systems. If you're talking about the kind of volume a Dell generates, you're talking a lot of motherboards. AMD's new chip fits into a slot, much like the current Pentium III line, but the slot is different. The slot is called Slot A; the A stands for Alpha, since it is based on DEC/Compaq's Alpha CPU bus and socket AMD is dealing itself a better hand by developing a chipset that motherboard makers can deploy into Slot A motherboards. However, whenever a chipset is built, it needs to be extensively tested to make sure all of the 12 zillion expansion cards on the market will work with it properly. Via, All, and others have run into problems with their chipsets. Being the market heavyweight means that most peripheral manufacturers will design to Intel's chipset. It will be up to AMD and other chipset makers to make sure that the motherboards and core logic work with the huge combinations of cards that are out there. There can't be a repeat of the AGP 2x fiasco, when several alternative Socket 7 chipsets didn't work correctly with AGP 2x graphics cards. If you are thinking about upgrading to the Athlon, make sure the gear you want in your gaming rig will work on an Athlon motherboard. The Athlon looks like a very good CPU, so the extra upgrading effort may be worth it, but don't ignore the need to check motherboard compatibility with your add-in cards first. 57.2 *GUARD-BAND CLIPPING ENABLED **GAMES USED: POWERSLIDE, EXPENDABLE, DESCENT 3, HALFLIFE, QUAKE II BATTLEZONE 2 Pentium III Athlon 600 Pentium III Game tests at 640x480** 198 OCTOBER 1999. cow.namasnet.com  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"HARDWARE PERFORMANCE PC SYSTEMS HYPERSONIC \"Which 3D Card Should I Buy?\" f there's one question readers have asked us more than any other, this would have to be it. So, you've got the question, we've got answers. Look for this 30 card guide every month here in CGW. Choosing the right 3D card depends on your CPU and your motherboard. So we have two recommendations for you. Choice A. If your CPU is a Pentium 233MHz or slower, or your motherboard is all PCI (10 AGP), or you've got a motherboard-down AGP graphics chip with no AGP slot, then get 3dfx's Voodoo2 1000 board. At about $100, it will do a very good job with current games, and a pretty good job with games coming out soon. And the best part is that when you swap in a new motherboard/CPU, you can migrate the Voodoo2 board to the new setup. Choice B: If your computer's motherboard has an AGP slot, then go with Hercules' Dynamite TNT2, which is currently the fastest 3D gun in the West. At about $180 street price for the 32MB version, this card is actually quite a deal. Even if you're running a Pentium II 233 or 266MHZ CPU, when you upgrade your motherboard/CPU, you can migrate the card into your new setup, and it's got room to grow with whatever CPU you mate it with.

The next Pentium III, code-named Coppermine, will have 256KB of Level 2 cache built onto the chip itself, running at the full clock speed of the processor. It will also be made using the new 0.18-micron process, much tighter than the 0.25-micron currently being used. The new manufacturing process will make for higher clock rates without causing a heat wave. Also slipping is Intel's next core logic chipset, the 820 (code-named Camino). If you ask around, the Camino is the real reason for the Intel delays. Camino will support a new type of memory called RAMBUS DRAM (RDRAM). Rumors abound that RDRAM hasn't been hitting the performance targets Intel wants.

TNT and TNT2 chips slave their OpenGL color bit-depth off the desktop resolution, so if you bump your desktop color-depth up to 16or 32-bit, both KINGPIN and QUAKE I will run with 3D acceleration, since they require at least 16-bit color to run in OpenGL mode. I just installed Windows 98 SE and noticed a yellow exclamation mark in the Device Manager next to \"Advanced Power Mangement Support.\" I found this just after my PC spontaneously rebooted. I also noticed that the power fan stopped working. So I looked at the properties sheet for Advanced Power Management and forced it to use APM 1.0 mode. That got my fan sort of working (I think that could be the problem) and the yellow exclamation sign disappeared beside the power management support device. Was this the problem? You're probably fine. You probably A purchased early PC100 memory. which lacks the tiny SPD (serial presence detect) ROM that all memory modules now have. All the ROM does is tell the system what type of memory it is, and what parameter settings (such as CAS type and so on) should be used. C) I am planning on building a new computer and I have a question about the video card(s) I am planning on putting in it. For my main video card I am buying a Diamond Viper V770 Ultra. I was also planning on putting in a Creative Lab's 3D Blaster Voodoo2 for Glide support, but do I really need to spend the extra money for its support of Glide? I am not a die hard first-person shooter, and I don't live and die for frame rates. But I have heard some games will only run on 3dfx video cards. I just bought Diamond's Viper V770 Ultra card, hoping to improve the looks of the games I play. However, I'm quite disappointed. First, QUAKE 2 will only run in software mode. The game won't change to OpenGL (as if it doesn't see my hardware card). Secondly, also bought KINGPIN, but it won't load OpenGL, saying it didn't detect my hardware card. The card installed okay, as per the instructions. Both UNREAL and HALF-LIFE look great, though. I have a Pentium III 500 MHz Aptiva 731 running Windows 98. I updated the drivers from Diamond's site. The support at Interplay could not give me any direction to fix my problem. You don't want to enable APM 1.0, as it's an older standard not widely supported. What you need to do is to enable the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) setting in your BIOS setup program. The exclamation point will disappear from the Device Manager, and your ATX power supply will behave properly. I have a Pentium III 450 on a C SE440BX motherboard (latest BIOS), and I get a \"Serial Presence Detect (SPD) device data missing or inconclusive\" whenever ! boot up. This occurs after the computer performs the memory check. What does this mean? What can It's true that some 3D games only support 3D acceleration if there's a 3dfx-compatible card present. But there are relatively few of these (something like 22). A few games used to run better in Direct3D on 3dfx hardware, but that's rapidly changing. We suggest waiting until you have a compelling reason to add a Voodoo2 card before you buy.

The four USB ports work great. But the parallel and serial ports are problematic. Some devices, like a modem attached, worked fine. But I couldn't get a Wacom ArtZ graphics tablet to even detect the serial port. I also attached an HP 722C inkjet printer to the parallel port. Both the USB parallel port and printer were detected fine, but I could never actually print anything. Also, Windows 98 detected the printer as a new device every time the system booted. Given that this was a clean install of Windows 98. I'd say it was problematic. Now, the 722C is a \"dumb\" device that depends on the PC to do the actual print rendering. It's possible that a printer with its own RAM and controller would work fine, but I wouldn't bet on it. Don't expect to use another parallel device like a Zip drive, either, there's a \"For Printers ONLY\" warning sticker next to the parallel port connector. USB devices, such as a Microsoft Freestyle Pro gamepad, a USB mouse, and a keyboard, all worked fine. I've used other Entrega hubs with good results, but if you're hoping for additional connection options for traditional serial or parallel devices, take your business elsewhere. -Loyd Case joystick/trackball combo controller is the only shooter controller to have any real fans. Others have tried, and others have failed, but Madcatz has cultivated a following. Building on that success, Madcatz has now released their Panther DX digital joystick, which nixes the trackball in favor of five well-placed buttons. The DX can connect via USB or your joystick port, and there's even a port where you can connect your rudder pedals. On paper, this looks like one slick stick, but in actual play we came across some glitches that kept the DX out of the winner's circle. I took the DX for a spin through ENEMY ENGAGED: APACHE/HAVOC and FIGHTER SQUADRON, and while the stick was connected via the joystick port, it fared well, with smooth movement and response during gameplay. The dial-a-throttle configuration isn't my favorite, but it gets the job done, and allows minute adjustments. The \"paw.pad\" upon which your left hand rests, is comfortable, and the five buttons (three for fingers, and two for your thumb) are eas. ily accessed. The trouble began when I tried connect ing the DX via USB. The controller was recognized and appeared happy, but after about a minute it would lose its connection and become unresponsive while appearing to be connected in the game controller control panel. Disconnecting/reconnecting brought it back to life, but after a minute or so, the cycle would repeat itself. And whether connected via USB or joystick port, my Thrustmaster Rudder Control System pedals were never usable despite repeated calibration attempts. A driver update may address these problems, but the extras that make this controller interesting don't appear to be ready for prime time. -Dave Salvator PLANTRONICS HS1 STEREO HEADSET Requirements: Sound card.

Headphones seem an obvious choice, but now that voice communications is getting big, not to mention voice recognition pack ages like Game Commander, maybe you should consider a complete headset. Telephone headset maker Plantronics has decided to jump into the \"hi-fi headset\" market, and their HS-1 headset deserves a serious look. The HS-1 uses 45mm neo-dyium speaker drivers and delivers very solid sound across the spectrum. Low-end response was beefy, and mids and highs were nicely defined as well, both for music and gaming audio. And these things could handle plenty of volume. The HS-1 also has a noise-can celing microphone that worked well with the Game Commander speech recognition utility. When not in use, the microphone nests neatly in the headphones and stays out of the way. About the only thing missing from this solid offering is a splitter for your sound card's audio output where you'd plug the headset into one output and your speakers into the other.

"HARDWARE PCLJD AVDIO ICC1412 is generally not a problem with gamepads that have a rough, textured surface, like those made by Gravis or Microsoft. But the glossy finish of CH Products' new USB Gamepad can cause the controller to slip out of my hands like a greased weasel at the most inop. portune times (like when Johnny Wilson is serving up a crushable curveball in HIGH HEAT 2000).

Tom Price EDITORS CHOICE ASUS MEW MOTHERBOARD/INTEL P810-0C100 CHIPSET Requirements: Socket 370 Celeron Price: $165 Manufacturer: Asus Contact: www.asus.com Turtle Beach Montego, Montego II based on the Vortex 1 Quadzilla audio chip, was a smash success. So a lot of us waited for Turtle Beach's spin on chip-maker Aureal's much more capable Vortex 2 chip. We waited...and waited. Well, the wait is over. At first GAMIN blush, the Turtle Beach Quadzilla hardware seems almost as physically awkward as the product name. The full package includes a primary card and a small daughterboard that adds four-speaker support and digital audio output, but takes up a slot panel in the back of your PC to do so. The MIDI quality was on par for the Vortex 2 chip; that is, good, but not stellar. The 3D audio sounded good through two speakers and even better through four, but the best 3D audio rendering came through headphones. Using CGW's Pentium 111/500 testbed, Audio Winbench reported a 2.95% CPU utilization streaming 16 voices through DirectSound3D at a 22KHz, 8-bit sampling resolution. Turtle Beach uses 18-bit D/A converters for cleaner output, so there was little ambient hissing at high volumes. The software utilties are slick, especially the audio diagnostic tool. If you've ever struggled with sound problems, this little gem is nearly worth the price of the card. The Montego Il is one of the best Vortex 2 boards I've seen to date. The only drawback is the daughtercard, which eats up a precious slot. But if you have the slot to spare, then check this card out. Your ears will love you for it -Loyd Case Vhat Were They Thinking? This is a slick little motherboard. As motherboard installations go, it was a piece of cake. The only installation hassle I had was to make sure that the custom INF file (a driver, of sorts) for the Intel 810 chipset was properly installed. But after actually testing the thing. I have only this to say: if you're a gamer, run like hell. I'd probably feel that way about any motherboard using the Intel 810 chipset. In its infinite march for increasing profits and greater world domination, Intel has built the graphics controller into the motherboard chipset. But Intel has used its old 1740 core as the graphics chipset, which even in its heyday was a weak performer. It also has built-in audio, but most of the audio chores are actually done in software, with just a hardware CODEC (compressor/decompressor) chip onboard. I tested the MEW with a 466MHz Celeron CPU certainly no slouch in perfor mance. However, 3D GameGauge performance was an anemic 15.9, less than half the average score of cards tested in our recent roundup. The 3D WinBench score was a paltry 349, and WinBench's 2D Business Winmark was 91. Something smells, and it ain't the fish. The only good news about this graphics chipset is that you can deactivate it and replace it with a PCI card. Voodoo2/2000 anyone? Asus isn't really to blame here; Intel is, for trying to foist off such a mediocre piece of crap on the world. If you see a really cheap PC for sale, check to see if it's using the 810 chipset. If it is, slap a warning sign on the system to steer away other gamers and leave quickly. -Loyd Case CH PRODUCTS USB GAMEPAD Requirements: Windows 98, USB port.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGIES. TIPS  TRICKS. CODES. CHEATS . WALKTHROUGHS Might And Magic VII Blood, Honor, and Some Really Weasely Tricks by P. Stephen \"Desslock\" Janicki ight & Magic VII is a game for the party animal the role-playing party animal. Your success hinges upon picking the right party members, developing their skills, and prepping them for battle. Picking Your Party Since each character class has distinct advantages, choosing your party members is a major decision. Race doesn't matter, so feel free to choose whichever races you'd like, but character classes are extremely important. The default party comprised of a Knight, Thief, Sorcerer and Cleric may not be particularly original, but it's actually one of the better combinations. A Sorcerer is nearly essential, since the Lloyd's Beacon and Starburst spells and the identify LORDY skills are so useful. A character capable of disarming traps is also important, unless you're willing to have an expensive NPC tag along with your party. Hand-to-hand combat is sometimes a real Archers are useful all-around characters, as they can cast many powerful ly bad idea. Unless you have grandmaster spells, are extremely good with missile weapons, are decent melee fighters, level protection from magic, use missile and can disarm most traps. The grandmaster spell abilities of a Cleric are weapons and spells (including slow) to also very useful, as they can render your party immune from instant death take Minotaur Lords out from a distance. spells and can heal the entire party. Druids and Rangers are widely skilled if you want to use them as substitutes for a core character class. Knights are naturally the best melee fighters, but the additional magical abilities of a Paladin are handy. Exploration and Character Development Once you clear out the Harmondale area, go to Erathia or the Tularean Forest, which are both considerably less difficult than Barrow Downs. Nighon is only accessible through the mountain entrance underneath Stone City, and you can reach the Evenmorn Islands only through the Tatalia docks, after you complete the Priest elevation quest. The barrows in Barrow Downs and the maze in Nighon are great places to pick up gold if you're running low. Elevate the primary skills of your characters as soon as possible. There are two expert trainers for each ability, but only one master and grandmaster trainer. Only one character in your party needs to develop the Merchant Identify item, Identify monster, Disarm trap, Stealing, Alchemy and Repair skills.

"GAMER'S EDGE Trading Places If you're hard up for gold, you can always earn some by lugging around a big, ugly crate of goods to a prospective buyer. Since the crates take up so much room and the reward for completing a delivery isn't significant, trading wouldn't be worth your time if you didn't have the trading table on this page, which specifies exactly where to make your deliveries. There are two separate delivery chains, each with three stops, but one is ten times as lucrative as the other and will cost you ten times as much for raw materials. Using the Town Portal or Lloyd's Beacon spells you can quickly rack up as much money as you need DEATH FROM ABOVE Meteor Swarm, which can be cast by both archers and sorcerers, and Starburst are extremely effective spells outdoors, especially when your party is flying out of range of melee weapons.

Arrowheads (200 gold) ence points, and then dismiss them (or pick up a banker NPC) prior to collecting gold and looting corpses. If your characters are inept at disarming traps, pick up an NPC thief, but avoid aquiring any treasure until you've disarmed all the traps in the area and dismissed the NPC. When playing Acromage, use cards that boost your Quarry, Magic and Zoo level (and reduce your opponent's ratings) before any others unless you need to quickly elevate your tower to avoid destruction. Once you start outproducing your opponent, you'll be able to win easily by building your tower or by just accumulating resources. April Key To Genie Lamps Genie lamps are extremely useful items; they are found lying around in barren areas such as Bracada Desert and Nighon. Genie lamps Desert and Nighor bestow different powers depending upon the date of their use. Avoid using them on weekends, as characters will be turned to stone on Fridays, killed on Saturdays, and eradicated on Sundays (some day of rest!). The benefits granted by a genie lamp will be different each month, as you can see from the Year of the Genie table, and will get successively stronger during each week of a month. Skill points are probably the most useful benefit, at least early in the game.

Acromage is easy, provided that you focus on increasing your Quarry, Magic and Zoo scores. Player*** Sroky Quarte Enetty Combat Tips Pick up the bow skill for all of your characters right away. In real-time mode, your party will be able to take out almost any opponent with missile weapons (even the dragon on Emerald Island), but you'll have to learn to master the keyboard \"ranged combat rumba\": launch arrows, turn 90 degrees, and move your party forward to dodge incoming fire; turn to face your opponents again and launch more arrows. The strafing keys are too slow to be effective. Once you get the Fly spell, you can dodge incoming fire in turn-based mode by moving upwards and downwards. When outdoors, Starburst and Meteor swarm spells are extremely effective at wiping out armies of enemies. You can maneuver into position to launch a fly spell to great effect, and can also retreat quickly from pursuing enemies. Avoid hand-to-hand combat with monsters like Minotaur Lords that can kill instantly. Instead, hit them with slow, paralyze and berserk spells, and then pick them off with missile weapons or offen. sive spells. Effective spell casting can clear out areas such as Nighon's Maze, which otherwise would be too deadly for lower-level characters. For a low-level spell, Sparks can be very effective at close range. Prepare for major battles by casting all of the defensive spells you have, such as Bless, Heroism, Haste, resistance spells, Protection from Magic, Regeneration and Stoneskin. Melee weapons are often the most effective way to quickly take down enemies indoors, but ensure that your characters are as well protected as possible before charging into battle. 50 bricks 101 bricks beasts 28 brost 23 12 Party Prism Brick Shortage A player's magie egual Damago.

"GAMER'S EDGE EverQuest The Journey of a Thousand Hours Begins With Your First Character by Andrew Park If you value your social life greatly, then the best advice I can give is to avoid EVERQUEST altogether. Otherwise, you may catch the addiction, and find yourself forsaking food and real-world social interaction in favor of monster slaying, treasure hunting, and meeting the other people who happen to be there for the monsters and treasures as well. If you still want to game on, then by all means stay and read this guide. I know how hard it is to start out in the land of Norrath; the only items out of the box that will be of any real use are the CD and the reference card that describes the keyboard shortcuts (with which you should familiarize yourself as soon as possible). The thoroughly uninformative game manual and the game's own quirky user interface won't do much to help get you started, so I will. THIS BEETLE AIN'T FROM LIVERPOOL Be sure to set your hotkeys for some combat options before picking a fight. The CHot) Keys to Success GIMME SOME PALE ALE While your initial water and bread cakes are fine for now, try to get some more food when you can. INVENTORY IDEAS BERSAL River Almaker 031221914 DENTRO After you've created your first character, get ready to jump into the world of Norrath. The first thing you should do is look around; use the F9 key to change your perspective to one of five different camera angles. F10 will choose between the default minimized-view (which you should use at the beginning), halfscreen view (which you should stick to after you've familiarized yourself with the hotkeys), and full-screen view. Now, bring up your inventory (if you didn't play the tutorial to learn how to open it with the mouse, then just press \"T\" on your keyboard). You should have five bread cakes, five water skins, a weapon, a note, and a book of discord. The bread cakes and water are essential; run out of these, and you'll eventually become so hungry and thirsty that you'll suffer continual exhaustion and become unable to recuperate from your wounds. Equip your starting weapon (a short sword, a dagger, or a club) and then have a look at your note; this is the slip of paper you turn in to your guild master. Right click it once to read the contents and find the name of your guild master, then seek him out. Lastly, you should get into the habit of assigning hotkeys to important actions, such as fighting. You can do this by left-clicking and holding down over an important action button, then dragging it to your hotkey box in the lower left-hand corner of your screen. You can now access that action by pressing the corresponding keyboard number; if you assigned melee attack to the first slot, you can toggle it on and off by pressing \"1\" You'll want to hotkey all your important abilities; for instance, warriors and monks should hotkey kick: barbarian, ogre and troll characters should hotkey slam (both examples are for use in combat). 0 002 MORSETAS SMOKELT You no longer have a target Your long have a toront.

You have a pool of 12 races and 14 character classes to choose from. Seven primary statistics make up the rest of your character: strength, stamina, agility, dexterity, wisdom, intelligence and charisma. Don't take the choice of deity lightly, as religion determines both your starting point, and how the various factions treat you. All the races have innate abilities and quirks that make them suitable or unsuitable for certain classes. Erudites, being the smartest race in Norrath, have the high intelligence points needed to make them good spellcasters. Agile Halflings have innate abilities to sneak and hide, so their best bet is a career in roguedom. There's no \"best race/class combination as just about any combination will work to an extent. However, at some point in your EVERQUEST career, you'll want to develop a mainstay character. Good test characters to get accustomed to the basics of the game are either a half-elf warrior based in Freeport, or a halfling warrior based in Rivervale. Both of these race/class combinations have the ability to see in the dark (infravision, and they begin in safe, well-populated areas with plenty of easy monsters to fight, minor quests to perform, and other players with whom to interact.

"GAMER'S EDGE EVERQUEST ONE MEAD TOO MANY Use the F9 key to get additional camera views of your drunken self. How to pick up Elves Now that you've gotten used to the basics, you can get to the meat of the game-meeting other people. Just press Enter and type whatever profound wisdom you have to say, in a con versational tone. Use the /tell command for direct and discreet messages for specific players; respond to /tells with the /reply command. There are also three general channels that can be heard by anyone in the area: /shout (for calls of help, warnings or group requests), /auction (for buying and selling goods), and looc (for out of character discussion). Thankfully, excessive chatter can be filtered out using the options menu. Interacting with computer characters is slightly different. It's often a good idea to /consider them first (either press the \"C\" key, or press Enter and type in /con, or right click on them); this will reveal how tough the character is, as well as how they regard you (with respect to faction standing). If a powerful character regards you threateningly or is ready to attack, it's best to turn and run. Of course, when you get past the city gates, you'll find monsters that won't be too interested in chitchat. Before you engage, /con the monster to make sure you can handle it. At Tin I ndiet Career Changes COMPUTER SOLILOQUY After hailing NPCs, pay attention to what they say, and ask questions containing the words within brackets. 131 EVERQUEST may focus on combat, but there are NPC-related quests, trade skills, and player interactions to break it up. Trade skills allow characters to become proficient in such formidable arts as pottery, brewing, smithing and tailoring. There's no Heald Institute in Norrath, so being a successful tradesman requires your character to purchase the appropriate \"How To\" book and materials, and have at it. Trade skills, like all other skills, will only improve with repeated use. One thing to remember is that the land of Norrath is constantly changing. The next time you log in, don't be surprised to see a patch with a number of minor tweaks or fixes added by the designers. Since the beta test, several things have changed; level requirements for skills (at press time, bash has been lowered from a level 9-12 skill to level 6; dual wield has been lowered from a level 15-17 skill to level 13-16), faction shifts and quest completions have been changed. This sort of constant flux has the unfortunate side effect of outdating the information, but also serves as the designers' dynamic set of checks and balances to keep the playing field as level as possible and, ideally, to make the game as enjoyable as possible. Hopefully, you'll now be able to make some sense of the gameworld, and progress smoothly into Norrath. rache Your r espot D MOTOSE L You any. hal Trento MOS TRATION wast of De lower levels, a green, blue, or even a black/white con should be all right, but more dangerous yellow and red /cons should be avoided After combat, there'll be a body to loot (either your target's or your own). Right-click on the corpse first, then loot by right-clicking on the items. You probably gained some experience from the battle; the orange bar in your persona menu will indicate this. Once all five bars are filled, you'll gain a level. Thumping on weak monsters yields less experience, so you'll soon need to seek out tougher opponents. In order to tackle the nastier beasts, you should band together with some like-minded adventurers of a similar experience level; a well balanced party of healers, magic users and fighters can collectively bring down monsters several levels higher than their own.

"GAMER'S EDGE The Art of Drafting: Building a Winner An Obsessive-Compulsive's Guide to Drafting a Killer Fantasy Sports Team o you've joined a computer sports league, draft day is quickly approaching, and you still don't have a clue how to sort through the rabble to craft a team that will crush your rivals and break their spirits. Well, don't be frightened, success is simply a matter of preparation. Follow our suggestions and Draft Day will live in your memory as a day to remember, not as a day of shame. by Robert Coffey Reading Is Fundamental ince the odds are you'll be drafting for a sport when that sport's season starts in real life, check newsstands for annual pre-season reports. Given the huge popularity of rotisserie leagues there are loads of magazines that can be useful, and you should get more than one so you have at least two different perspectives. Since every worthwhile publication has comprehensive stats, look for publications that rate every player not just by position, but also by how they stack up with everyone else. There are many good online options, but keep in mind you're going to want hard copy come draft day. Don't forget to take a look at the game's stats/scouting reports as well. You'll find useful nuggets of info there as well, especially behind the numbers. For instance, every pitcher's delivery is described in HIGH HEAT BASEBALL 2000, allowing you to pick up a player whose numbers may not be spectacular, but whose unusual sidearm delivery could be very effective in relief situations against human opponents. Know Thyself n efore you start your player wish list, think about what kind of team you'll want. In football, do you want to emphasize a running or passD ing game? In baseball, do you want a team that clobbers opponents with the long ball, or would you rather humble your foes with dominating pitching? While you obviously need some sort of balance, these early decisions are crucial since they'll dictate the early picks that will determine your star performers. Deep Thoughts Darwinian Principles don't know how to tell you this, but you're not the only guy who's heard of Mark McGwire or Terrell Davis. As you start to compile your list of I hopefuls, make sure you look beyond the superstars at every position. The best of the best won't be around long enough for you to snag more than one or two. Looking at player depth for every position will also help you shape your general strategy. For instance, if there's an abundance of quality first basemen but only a couple of top-notch second basemen, you might want to grab your starting second baseman early and hold off on selecting a guy for first base until later in the draft. A dapt or perish. Even with all this prep work, some of your short list guys might well be taken by others, but there's an upside you might predict wrongly and Brett Favre may still be available come your turn. So expect the unexpected. One final note: If you're ever totally unsure whom to draft, just pick the best player available he can't hurt you and you might be able to trade him later. Also, later in the draft, if your team is looking good but you see glaring holes in other teams (someone only has two guys in the bullpen) you might want to consider drafting players that can fill their needs. A desperation trade that favors you is a good thing. CGW Reality Check Now you're ready to start planning your picks in earnest. Look at your dream list; odds are you won't get them all, but with planning you can come close. First, look at your position in each draft round since this will shape your game plan. If you pick early you'll probably get exactly who you want in the first round, but if you're further down the line, you'll need make a guess as to who will be available when your turn comes. In a baseball draft, expect elite pitchers to go early in the first round with marquee offensive players starting to get picked in the middle of the round. In football, the best quarterbacks will go early, then the top runners and receivers. Look at your short list again: Who can you reasonably expect to get based on your draft position? All this preparation should lead up to a short list of five to seven guys that you have a great chance at acquiring. These guys will be the foundation of your team, so take a last look at them to make sure they're filling your most basic needs. For example, in a baseball draft you'd want that list to include your top two pitchers, your number three and four hitters, and your closer. After that, your picks should fill out your starting lineup and starting, pitching before filling your bench. 220 OCTOBER 1999. cgw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE ACTION by Thierry Nguyen Jumping off Q3A Deathmatch Is Dead t press time, one of id Software's level designers, Brandon James (better known as \"Killme\" within the online community) abruptly left the company. James is probably best known for designing \"The Longest Yard,\" the infamous jump-pad level in Q3ATEST. James wouldn't comment on why he departed, but Paul Jaquays (a fellow designer) posted to a message board saying that James left of his own accord, and wasn't fired. As for development, Jaquays said that James' remaining maps and responsibilities would be divided among the rest of the team. It's the second major blow to id, following the departure of Brian Hook to Verant. Everyone can Hear You Save, ust as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven was the last great western, so will QUAKE III: ARENA be the last great deathmatch game. After Q3A, deathmatch can be safely declared dead. Sure, there will be plenty of post-Q3A shooters that will include deathmatch, yet the very feature that made shooters so successful is starting to wear thin. The Killer App Honestly, how many of you are living and breathing the deathmatch experience for Shooters behind HALF-LIFE, SIN, SHOGO, or UNREAL? Who's salivating at the prospect Has Run Out of of deathmatch in STAR TREK: ELITE FORCE, AMEN: THE AWAKENING, or even the infaAmmo mous DAIKATANA? Chances are, not a lot of you. It's a sign that deathmatch is rapidly being eclipsed by teamplay. Teamplay has always been around, even since the DOOM days when it was limited to co-op mode. When the QUAKE games came out, one of the first things to happen was the clan-phenomenon: people were unofficially dividing themselves into teams during deathmatch. The real catalyst was Robin Walker, John Cook, and Ian Caughley's creation of the TEAM FORTRESS mod for QUAKE. Due to its incredible success (at any given point, there were more TF servers than traditional DM servers), designers started rethinking teamplay from the ground up. Then, Dynamix's STARSIEGE: TRIBES proved that a game with teamplay as its foundation could indeed be successful. What was once an afterthought is now becoming the principal focus; if there was a trend in action design in this year's E3, it was teamplay. Iter vehemently detending the lack of an in-game save, Fox Interactive and Rebellion finally caved in to public pressure and released a patch for ALIENS VS. PREDATOR that includes in-game saves (it's also on our CD to save you some download time). But before you pat yourself on the back for another victory against The Man, be aware that the patch allows only a limited number of saves per level, depending on what difficulty you're playIng. Then again, something is better than nothing, and Fox should be applauded for finally listening to their customers, even though the result is less than perfect. OUT DEATHMATCH For Love of the Game Why is teamplay dethroning deathmatch? Academics will say that humans tend to be social creatures; we can't help it. It's instinct to want to accomplish a goal with like-minded folk, rather than to take on the world single-handedly. If you don't trust academia, then take a good look at popular culture, specifically the enormous popularity of team over solo sports. People identify with sports teams, whether it's because of ideology, geography, acquaintance-or due to the simple fact that most of us know what it's like to work with others to achieve common goals. Track-and-field's focus on the individual hampers its popularity (except during the Olympics, when the athlete is working for the ultimate team-their country), while the Super Bowl and the World Cup are two of the most revered events in sports. How do I explain golf, then? Frankly. I don't think anyone can. I'll put myself on the line and say that by this time next year, the prospect of deathmatch play will excite no one. There's just too many titles in the pipeline that are tapping into our basic love of teamplay, and deathmatch will be relegated to an occasional break, rather than remain a productivitykiller. With titles like TEAM FORTRESS II, TRIBES 2, and one game I'm still not allowed to talk about coming out this year (stay tuned next month), 03A will be deathmatch's chance to go out with a bang, rather than a whimper. CGW IN TEAMPLAY CGW: A Case Study in Teamplay Dominance In what could be considered an omen for the whole \"print vs. web\" debate, the CGW staff had a friendly game of Q3ATEST with our online I brethren over at GameSpot. It seemed to be GameSpot's lucky day, as their staff surprisingly had the high scores for the match. Then again, we've already embraced the teamplay phenomenon with frequent games of STARSIEGE: TRIBES and TEAM FORTRESS CLASSIC. We're so focused on teamplay that our deathmatch skills have suffered. That's our story. Think of us as poster children for teamplay design. If we had a team match against GameSpot.... 226 OCTOBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "


"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE RPG ADVENTURE by Desslock Breaking the Rules AD&Daptations Sheriff Brody snarled defiance at the awesome denizen of the deep bearing down upon him. \"Smile, you son-of-a....\" Brody screeched as he fired his rifle and exploded the air tank perched within the Great White's gaping maw, blasting the beast to a watery grave. ---Peter Benchley, Jaws How faithful should a designer be when adapting a paper RPG to a computer game? We went straight to the source to get a few different viewpoints. and-Paper RPGS PLANESCAPE: TORMENT Chris Avellone, Designer: \"Changes should be made to the pen-and-paper rules when the rules don't follow any sort of programming logic. The AD&D spell system has a number of spells and items that are hard to quantify. Try to sit down with a programmer and explain how the combinations of rings of protection, cloaks of protection, magic armor, bracers of defense are supposed to work when someone is wearing all of them, and you'll both be driven mad within minutes. Basically you pick and choose what is implementable or not, and try to keep the flavor of the pen-and-paper game as much as possible\" nyone who read Peter Benchley's pulp classic knows that director Steven Spielberg took a few creative liberties with the author's work. While Benchley labeled Spielberg's flashy ending \"ridiculous,\" the movie became the biggest box office success of its time. Apparently there's On the Woes of at least commercial justification for making changes when crafting a movie adaptation of a Translating Penbook. What works well on the page doesn't necessarily work best in a visual medium. So what changes are justified when a computer game developer adapts a pen-and-paper role-playing game? Even the most hardcore RPG ideologues would admit that some changes are inevitable due to technology limitations. The most formidable computers available today still can't create a malleable and non-linear milieu as well as an experienced, creative, and suitably demented game master. But what about rules that could be put into a computer game, but would rarely be used or appreciated by gamers, such as AD&D's religious tithes, or the stats for dozens of obscure medieval weapons, such as vouges and glaives? It's understandable that most developers include only those features relevant to the game they present, rather than shallowly trying to include all the expansive rules of a gaming system. Adaptations should also emphasize the strengths of the new medium and avoid the limitations of the old. A film adaptation of a play shouldn't needlessly restrict its setting to a handful of rooms. Similarly, a computer RPG shouldn't hesitate to rely on visual cues, as opposed to statistical abstractions. For example, AD&D relies upon dice rolls, or saving throws, to simulate a character's ability to dodge spells. The BALDUR'S GATE expansion pack didn't banish AD&D's saving throw system, but it allowed characters to dodge spells by moving out of the targeted area. Those types of changes enhance gameplay by adding features impossible to implement in a tabletop game. But game developers often make rule changes simply because they feel that aspects of the original game aren't balanced, or just don't work well. While I feel some sympathy for game designers, who are typically too creative to want to rigidly adapt a system without adding their own embellishments, those are the kinds of changes I feel should be minimized. Veteran AD&D players know that certain character classes are initially more powerful than others, and that some spells, items and abilities are so powerful that they occasionally unbalance the game. But that's part of the charm of a system that's been successful for over 20 years. I want \"hold person\" spells that take powerful enemies out of a fight; I want to feel threatened by the level-draining abilities of undead creatures; I want my thief character to be able to use a ring of invisibility to clear out a dungeon single-handedly. Even though developers are trying to reach a broader audience than hardcore RPG fans, they should do so by offering compelling gaming worlds and stories and intuitive interfaces, instead of second-guessing the decisions made by a game's original designers. Give us faithful adaptations, and only make changes when they are necessary or enhance a game in ways previously impossible. Anyway....Spielberg's ending was ridiculous. CGW BALDUR'S GATE: TALES OF THE SWORD COAST Ben Smedstad, Producer: \"[Follow the rules) as closely as possible without sacrificing gameplay. which is more or less what we did with BALDUR'S GATE. We followed the rules to the letter and only strayed when the game mechanics were not adequate or when a spell, for example, seemed to be too powwerful and/or unbalanced. With a limited time frame in which to work, you can never put everything you want into a game's programming, design, or art. As soon as you vary the rules from the original game, you jeopardize the balance that its developers worked so hard to maintain. It is up to the designer of the computer RPG to maintain gameplay balance while still being able to make a fun and interesting game setting for players.\" VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE: REDEMPTION Ray Gresko, Producer: \"Obviously the most important aspects that define a license are the back ground/world and the game mechanics. The 'world of the license is the most sacred, and the designer should be devoted to a faithful representation. Whether the core mechanics transfer is dependent upon the type of game you're doing, but a computer RPG based upon a paper RPG should do its best to be true to the license's inner workings. Any good RPG will have a fino rules balance that can be upset dramatically if you start tinkering around too much with it.

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE SPORTS by George Jones The Perfect Sports Game? the success of nly three PC sports games have ever gotten it absolutely, totally, 100% right: 1. GBA CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL (Gamestar, 1986) Full court two-on-two basketball action with season play. 2. FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL PRO (Dynamix, 1992) The first great PC football game. Boasted amazing graphics for its time and a career play mode with rookie drafts. 3. HIGH HEAT BASEBALL 2000 (3DO, 1999) Because it stays true to the game while playing up the most enjoyable aspects. And because I'm winning the CGW league. The common element running The difference in through my top three is season play. This has been the strength of the PC sports game for years. But when you combine the PC platform's strengths console sports around season play with the console platform's strength-human oppogames when nents at your side-magical things happen. I still remember the fanatical devotion to SNK'S BASEBALL STARS for the Nintendo my friends and I had in college, and I see the crowd of CGW editors that gather whenever a dramatic. league game of HIGH HEAT 2000 is under way. So when are we going to see the holy grail of sports games--the game that takes season play and places it into an Internet environment where you can play in a league online against human beings? From the sound of things, it's only a matter of time. I had a chance to talk to John Vifian, Executive Producer of MADDEN FOOTBALL, and Marsh Gardiner, producer of several Fox Sports Interactive titles, about this topic. I came away from the discussions with the belief that PC sports game designers are ready to embrace the future. The difference in the success of console sports games when compared to their PC counterparts is dramatic. In 1998, four sports games were among the top 30 console games sold. On the PC side, the number of sports titles on the list was zilch. This discrepancy can be chalked up to one primary dynamic: human interaction. You could play NHL HOCKEY on the Sega Genesis for hours at a time because, in most cases, you were playing against a friend. This type of social dynamic is hard to find on the PC. \"With console games, you and your friends can gather in the living room,\" says Marsh Gardiner. \"It's been hard enough to connect two controllers to a PC, and Internet bandwidth just isn't there yet.\" But the bandwidth will get there, probably in the next five years. In John Vifian's mind, \"Online play is a given. The next step is a community on the Net that is all about the gaming experience, including stats, stories, and match-making.\" Does this mean you'll eventually play in 22-player football games that let you play as a lineman? Probably not. \"It would be extremely challenging to make the parts of the game that don't involve the ball fun,\" Gardiner argues. But, assuming that bandwidth gets there, multiplayer games that featured human-controlled receivers, quarterbacks, and running backs could work. If the team approach works for games like TRIBES and TEAM FORTRESS, why not MADDEN? Whenever the next great game arrives, you can be sure that excellent gameplay will lie at its core. \"The perfect game would still have to require jaw-dropping graphics, accessibility, and depth of play.\" Vifian reminded me. \"And that alone is no small order.\" CGW compared to their PC counterparts is Hitting Logic he CGW baseball season has resulted in more excuse-making and abuses of logic than a presidential campaign. The successful hitters among us argue that it's all skill, while the .220 hitters in our group argue that when Sammy Sosa grounds into a double play yet again, it's not their fault. But it begs a bigger question. How do baseball games calculate play results? Michael Roca, a HIGH HEAT 2000 programmer demystified his game's batting voodoo for us. \"In HIGH HEAT 2000, the results of a hit pitch can be boiled down to a few simple steps. First, we measure whether a swing is going to make contact with the baseball. Since it wouldn't be fair to place the bat at very specific coordinates in space-this would make hitting way too hard-we use a zonal approach. It's almost like you're swinging a tennis racket through the zone you select. From here we determine three things. First, we check how good your timing was, which is based mostly on your reflexes. Second, we measure how good Sammy Sosa in Red Sox garb? ... Yep \"Complicating matters a little bit, each pitcher has various ratings for certain pitches that will affect the kind of contact a batter is capable of making with each pitch he throws. It's almost as if a pitched ball has properties attached to it. So a Randy Johnson fastball is extremely hard to make good solid contact with. But, given its high velocity, if you do connect with one, you have a higher chance of hitthe contact is on the ball, which depends ting a homer. partially on your skills and partially on the \"The bottom line is this,\" Roca finished pitcher's and batter's. Finally we measure up. \"If you do everything right, and the how hard the ball is hit, which is almost pitch is hittable, you will probably get a solely based on the batter's statistical hit. The only exception would be in cases abilities. when a Clemens faces a backup catcher.\" CGW Baseball League uick results from the CGW HIGH HEAT 2000 baseball league: While holding off stall mutiny, George Jones' Boston Red Sox sat on top of the standings with a stunning .889 winning percentage. Fighting for second place in the AL East, each with records that would put them in the lead in the AL Central, were Robert Coffey's Yankees and Steve Wanczyk's Baltimore Orioles. The AL central, otherwise known as the Homerun Derby, featured a tight race going into the mid-summer months of the season, with Jeff Green's White Sox, Dave Salvator's Indians, and Tom Price's Tigers all within a single game in the standings. The most stunning event of the still young season: Steve's Orioles lost Ken Griffey. Jr. for 30 days. Wow, rough luck, Steve. We feel for you, big guy. 230 OCTOBER 1999 COMPILTER GAMING MORIN "

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE STRATEGY by Robert Coffey Stop Making Sense... ...And You imple goals. Simple means. Complex options. These are the building blocks of successful strategy games. If the game looks good and offers something new, that's even better. But the fact is, if gamers have to bend over backward to understand a game because it's loaded with too many \"features\" or is just flat-out obscure, then, with few exceptions, the game loses out in the marketplace. Even if it Start Losing rocks. Gamers Reinventing the Wheel No matter how steep the learning curve, if there aren't hand-holds along the way, the game is going to lose players as they skid helplessly down that curve. Even a legendary designer like Sid Meier can fall victim to this just take a look at ALPHA CENTAURI. As deep and challenging as CIVILIZATION II, ALPHA CENTAURI is an intimidating package, even though it successfully alleviates much of the micromanagement of its unofficial predecessor. A huge part of CIV's appeal is how incredibly accessible it is pretty much any goon on the street can tell you what inventing the wheel is all about. But what the hell is nerve stapling? Or the Gaia Project? Profoundly nonintuitive, ALPHA CENTAURI forces gamers to tack the tech tree up on their walls while reading the manual with a Sidspeak-toEnglish dictionary Gaming shouldn't be work, and our own polls seem to bear that out. Since its February release, ALPHA CENTAURI hasn't even managed to crack the CGW Top 100 list, a list compiled from the input of the very core gamers targeted by the game. While it's too early to give sales figures a lot of weight, it's worth noting that ALPHA CENTAURI released strongly-hitting #2 in PC Data's sales chart for February-but then dropped sharply in its third month of release, barely exceeding those of the over-a-year-old STARCRAFT. Of equal interest is that the inferior CIV sequel, CIVILIZATION: CALL TO POWER appears on track to match ALPHA CENTAURI in number of units sold. there are tons of strategic options and choices to be made in any STARCRAFT game, its tight conceptual focus is easily grasped and makes the game tremendously accessible in spite of the overwhelming alienness of the units. It's the same clear-cut gameplay design that keeps the fantasy trappings of the HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC series from crippling it-play for 10 minutes and you'll have a pretty good grasp of what needs to be done, if not the minutiae of gameplay. Sadly, it seems that some developers seem intent on muddying their focus by obscuring their game with too many features that don't directly help gamers play the damn game. It's the Death-by-menu-buttons syndrome that whacked GANGSTERS and worries me about BRAVEHEART. Conversely, the slew of AI features promised in CONQUEST: FRONTIER WARS has me excited simply because they offer a better way to play the game, a way that simply makes sense. CGW HOMEWORLD BOUND e got our hands on some beta builds of Sierra Studios/Relic's much-anticipated HOMEWORLD and took them for a multiplayer spin. The game is still gorgeous and creates a mood unlike any other game. And it emphasizes the kind of spatial thinking that Khan from Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan lacked. We have some concerns, though, as a lot of the game is spent on a far-out radar view, where your beautiful ships become mere dots on a 30 plane. Also, the multiplayer pace is on the slow side: we'd sit and construct our fleets for a long time, and then have to hunt opponents in the large 3D space arenas before ever seeing any action. We still have faith in Relic and in the singleplayer game, but as of now, multiplayer HOMEWORLD seems a bit plodding. Perhaps we just need to lay off the coffee. Focus! Does this mean the gobbledygook that's part and parcel of science-fiction games prevents them from succeeding? Of course not-look at STARCRAFT. In STARCRAFT, mixed in with the Mutalisks, Dark Templars, and Corsairs, is the very straightforward concept of \"Wipe out the other guy.\" While Putting Time Into Real Time I would seem that making time pass in a real-time strategy game would be a no-brainer: Time's going to pass while gamers play, so that should take care of it. But the actual mechanics of time in a realtime title are more complicated than that, since designers have to juggle little issues like game balance and playability Take DUNGEON KEEPER 2, for instance. Underneath the continuous stream of onscreen activity is a counter-based system chugging along, allowing the designers to ensure that things happen at an appropriate pace. Certain game events are set to occur after so many \"ticks\" of this internal clock; this approach also allows the game to determine unit abilities (100 ticks to research a new spell for a first-level warlock, just 50 ticks at fifth level), how deep into a mission you must go before enemies begin breaching your dungeon, and more. Along with giving the designers more flexibility in game design and balance, the big payoff is for the gamer: by not using the CPU's internal clock to keep time, gamers with slow machines will still have appropriately paced games. 232 OCTOBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE SIMULATION & SPACE by Gordon Berg Playing Favorites On the Radar: ACES HIGH Our New Sim Guy Takes His Virgin Flight CES HIGH, the new WWII online simulator from WARBIRDS creator Dale \"HITech\" Addink, should be in open beta by the time you read this. This time around Addink is insisting on no distractions can you say RAIDER WARS?), and has committed the next three years towards bringing more of a \"real world\" experience to the flight sim enthusiast. Says Addink. \"It's the development of the little nuances that will make big dillerences between ACES HIGH and other games.\" ACES HIGH plans to incorporate more user interfaces within a 3D environment: a new communication scheme; greater scalability; and fewer game limitations than those found in previous efforts. Point your browser to www.hitechcreations.com to check it out. llow myself to introduce...uh, myself. I'm Gordon Berg and I'll be taking over the flight sim column here at CGW. It won't be easy following the likes of my predecessor, Denny Atkin. After all, I'm a huge fan of his and know what a wonderful job he has done. So why me? Well, I got my start covering flight sim newsgroups on the Internet for Gamepen.com (\"Flight Sim Therapy\"), and here at CGW there must be a minimum quota of writers with beards at all times. To help you get to know me a little better, the editors at CGW thought my first article should be about my favorite sims. So, without further ado... RED BARON: Ah, the sim that started it all for me. In fact, Dynamix's RED BARON (1990) was why I bought my very first computer, a 486/33. The graphics at the time were amazing, the missions were truly random, and the flight models were realistic enough so that tactics mattered. There was also the discovery of multiplayer RED BARON On The Sierra/Imagination Network. My life has not been the same since Trivia note: RED BARON creator Damon Slye took a sabbatical of sorts after ACES OVER EUROPE. He finished school, attained his pilot's license, and gained an expert rating in chess. He currently has plans to come back this Fall and start work on a new game (make it a flight-sim, Damon). WARBIRDS: Bar none the best multiplayer dogfighting on the Internet today, this sim is where I often spend my free time. None of the recent retail WWII sims on the market hold a candle to WARBIRDS when it comes to flight modeling. Put 250+ players in the Main Arena with great lag code and consistent updates, and you have one hell of a good time. Although not perfect (drag at low speed is way too forgiving and don't even get me started on proper six views), WARBIRDS is premium value for your entertainment dollar. Did you know: Offline AI has been introduced with the latest version (v2.7) of WARBIRDS. Now you can simulate the chaos of the Main Arena for free! LONGBOW 2: I never got to experience the joy of the original Longbow or the critically acclaimed FLASH POINT KOREA add-on-my computer back then simply refused to run it. By the time I had a system up to the task, LONGBOW 2 had arrived and opened up a whole other world for me. It had nice tutorials, was accessible to both beginner and expert alike, and offered a dynamic campaign that allowed for cooperative multiplay, a feat accomplished by few sims since. Easter Egg: Type iwannasee during the end credits and see some interesting \"comments.\" RED BARON 3D: Hang on, didn't I already mention an earli. er RED BARON product? Isn't that cheating? Maybe, yet I'm still flying RB3D to this day, not the original one. Yes, the AI is barely adequate and the flight models found in the final patch are questionable, but God help me, I love this sim. The campaigns are varied and fun, the dogfights are tense, and RB3D does a great job at conveying a \"you are there\" feeling. Better still are the endless user hacks that continually breathe new life into this aging product. About those hacks: Denny mentioned how you can change the graphics in the August CGW, but there's more. Check out Sygrod's page at home.golden.net/-ksharman/th/Main.html Now, I realize at this point that some of you are asking, Rocket Ral \"Where are the jets?\" I'm not saying I'm not a fan of modern air combat, I'm just not listing any in my top picks. I love the idea of FALCON 4 and hope it one day truly becomes all that it can be. I found JANE'S F-15 a bit too realistic for my taste (missions were a little long), but I loved its atmosphere and flight model. I'm also eagerly looking forward to the upcoming JANE'S A-10. Nonetheless, I'll admit that shooting at my opponent with guns instead of missiles is what excites me most; not because I abhor modern weapons, but because I enjoy the thrill of earning that spot behind their six.

"GREENSPEAK by Jeff Green I Got The Scoop! My World Exclusive Preview of the Greatest Game of All Time t's not often in life that you get a chance to knock on the door of genius. But that's what was going to happen to me, quite literally, when-with a mixture of pride, trepidation, and a sweaty back-I traveled to the home of legendary game designer Sid Meier for my exclusive hands-on world-premiere scoop of the new CIVILIZATION game. Unfortunately, as it turns out, I wrote the address down incorrectly, and when I knocked on the door of what I thought was Sid's house-located under a freeway, with a dismembered tractor on the front lawn-a very scary-looking man in a blood-stained undershirt pointed his shotgun and Rottweiler at me and asked me to get off his property. Undeterred by this minor setback, I returned home and began working on Plan B. This, unfortunately, never materialized. Plan C, however, was a doozy, and would almost undoubtedly have reaped a slew of international jour. nalism awards and fawning nekkid female groupies; but in another frustrating setback, I was unable to convince the rather uptight (I must say) Powers That Be around here that breaking into the Firaxis office and stealing all their equipment was the right thing to do. In any case, it's now 3:00 a.m., the story is due tomorrow morning, and I still have nothing. Our new managing editor, Chris Lombardi, kind of scares me. What if he hits me? I could sue, of course, but would it be worth the pain? I don't want to find out. No, I must simply turn in a CIVILIZATION scoop-no matter the cost. And so, dear reader, I present you with Plan D. unannounced (another scoop!) teledildonics peripheral. As far as new units go, you can definitely expect to see some. Shown on this page, in a world-premiere exclusive scan, is a stick figure sketch of the Egyptian Guy, which I drew based on my concept of what the unit, if I could convince Sid to include it in the game, might look like. Other cool units are no doubt in the planning stages. Although the singleplayer game will be as robust as ever, the expected massively multiplayer component is, of course, the feature that many gamers are anticipating the most. Imagine logging into an online CIV game and being part of a functioning civiJelf Creet Art may not be reproduced under any because why would you want to? circunse Our new managing editor, Chris Lombardi, kind of scares me...No, I must simply turn in a CIVILIZATION SCOOP no matter the cost. he next game in the legendary, award-winning CIVILIZATION series, as I envision it, is going to be the best one yet. Though it's hard to guess exactly what they have in mind, I think it's safe to say that the new game will remain faithful to the franchise, while branching out in bold new directions. To appeal to many different kinds of gamers, it will probably incorporate a number of exciting new modes. The ability to switch from the standard isometric perspective to a fully 3D first-person perspective will be key, of course. Now, not only will you have the ability to build civilizations, but you'll be able to actually walk around and live in them as well. Running out of food at your granary? Well, now you can switch to first-person mode, pick up a fully interactive wheelbarrow, and grab your self some hearty grain! First-person mode will be even more meaningful in light of some of the game's new units and buildings. The brothel, for example, key to any successful civilization, will be a fully functioning environment made even more realistic by the expected support for Thrustmaster's lization, a single unit, without the pressure of doing it all yourself. As your civilization evolves, so will you. Thus, a food gatherer in the Stone Age becomes a serf in the Feudal Age, an indentured servant in Colonial times, and finally, a cubicle worker in the Modern Era, complete with unfiltered air and flickering, cancer-inducing fluorescent lighting. Now, you'll be able to sit in your office at your real job, and play your online job while ignoring your real job. Maybe you'll even be able to get your online \"boss\" to yell at you too! Just kidding! Of course, all this gaming goodness will come at a price. The expected minimum system is a Pentium 500 with the as-yet-announced Voodoo 4 chip with 300MB RAM, though the company is likely to announce that it will be possible to play it on a 286 machine in DOS. As you can see, the new CIVILIZATION game is already shaping up to be one of the monster gaming hits of the next year. I'll be keeping you up-to-date on this project as it develops, including some hands-on exclusive beta-testing, assuming I still have a job. I am literally foaming at the mouth in anticipation! What Jeff doesn't realize is that interactive brothels go all the way back to 1985's SIMGONORRHEA. Give him the clap at jeff green@zd.com.
