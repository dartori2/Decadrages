In many ways, SEAL Team is extremely realistic the missions follow a logical progression, and the team has adequate resources to accomplish them in contrast to the chaos faced by the grunts in the jungle). Some missions only require intelligence gathering and return, while others require the player to use demolition skills or set up an ambush. The weapons have accurate rates of fire and ranges, the role of the support boats and aircraft seems reasonable, and the objectives are based on actual mission data from the Vietnam era. Verisimilitude breaks down somewhat (as in most simulations) when one considers how much damage the gamer's character can take before being killed. On one mission, my unit was shelled by a mortar attack as soon as we stepped out of the river. Although one of the team members was wounded, this had very little impact on our ability to carry out our mission. After another ambush, one of the team members was forced to carry the other member and this did slow us somewhat. Yet, I think we would all have been wasted in a real ambush. Of course, being too realistic can kill a game. Further, although the game has extremely attractive graphics, current machine speeds do not allow programmers the ability to really make the jungle as dense as it truly is, and travelling through the underbrush and swampy rice paddies seemed significantly easier than I would have expected it to be in real life. Again, a simulation should not be so TO realistic that it is no longer interesting to play, each recruit who had graduated from SEAL but I would have liked to see some game training and carefully nurtured him through feature that indicated something more of the the campaign.

I also think that the skill-based nature of the character selection adds something to this personalization, as do the atmosphere-serting conversations between team members prior to each mission. The deaths of my brother SEAL members on various missions and the cinematic segues between an extraction and the mission debriefing certainly brought the message home. Further, I will never forget the time I switched my weapon from semi-automatic to automatic fire and pulled the trigger (by hitting the ENTER key), only to watch a VC stand to surrender just before my burst sliced through him.

"CGW STUCI WATCH A monthly look at the Computer Entertainment Stock Market 120 8 Intel Corporation NASDAQ Symbol INTC One week per bar. 8 Stock Price per Share 8 want to them MAF who wa BIELE W 8 They only 8 o 1990 1991 1992 Intel Processors Drive Profits And Computers Apparently, computer gamers aren't the only ones who think processing power is important. There seems to be a real hunger for faster, more powerful processors in the marketplace, and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has the earnings to prove it. On February 10, 1993, Intel announced earnings per share of $4.97 for 1992. This was approximately a 27% increase over the earnings of the previous year ($3.92 per share, representing a 23% increase over the previous year). In addition, the company paid its initial quarterly dividend in December of 1992 ($.10 per share). In an interesting move which occurred at press time, the company announced its intent to offer a 2-for-1 stock split on their common stock. As the chart shows, Intel has had a tremendous run over the last year, from around the $46 per share mark to its press time quote of $116. In order to provide more affordable shares for the average investor, the company's directors have elected to offer the split which would, in effect, halve the price per share (while doubling the number of shares held by existing shareholders). As readers who peruse the story on the PentiumTM processor (see the following pages) should realize, Intel is expecting to play a big role in the lives of gamers. At press time, the Pentium processor had not been officially announced and Standard & Poors (providers of the most followed rankings on Wall Street) had already estimated 1993 income at $6 per share. Whether the new technology will have significant impact on these earnings estimates or not will remain to be seen. In the meantime, cutting-edge technology, strong demand for existing processors, and sound management make Intel a stock to watch over the long haul. Ironically, Intel's success is a mixed bag for computer gamers. Their continually improving processors make new and improved games possible, but the proliferation of advanced machines creates an accelerating pattern of obsolescence (meaning gamers have to upgrade more often) and provides a templation for some game developers to try too much (resulting in \"buggy\" products). In the long run, the introduction of new processors should create a better gaming atmosphere. cow Page 10 Computer Gaming World "

"Unn older gamers. Sometimes the game doesn't play fair, by having objects show up without warning in places they weren't before (so the fact that a cabinet is empty at one time is no reason to assume that it will be empty at another); but this resembles real life, especially for a child living in his parents' house, so I think it is acceptable. GENCE Willy is a good kid but he's no angel. He lives in a fantasy world out of a 1950's sitcom (everyone seems to be white and upper-middleclass), but his world is not untouched by evil: his father loses his job; the town is at the mercy of a nasty, rich woman named Leona; and the plumbers go on strike, leaving the town faucers full of brown glop. Lots of the comedy is sepia-toned and sweetly nostalgic, but not all â there are also moments of satire that could come out of the pages of Mad, Spy, or National Lampoon. In short, Willy Beamish offers a mix: things that a nine-year-old player will enjoy, things a nineteen-year-old might, and things that only a person even older than that will appreciate, such as an encounter with a street gang that saunters down the street snapping its fingers a la West Side Story. This mix worked fine in the original because the player was free to read the game's text at his or her own pace and to take away from it as much as he or she understood. Alas, in deciding on a set of voices to use for the game, Dynamix also had to decide on a single tone for the game to have. They could have chosen subtle, quick, ironic readings, but they were probably concerned abour alienating younger gamers. Or they might have done a straightforward, child-oriented reading; while that would have sacrificed a lot of the game's humor it would, at least, have been bearable. Instead, Dynamix went for something in between, and the result comes across as, at once, insulting to children and inconsiderate of adults, whose skin it will make crawl. JEEP The game's graphics and animation are neither better nor worse in the CD-ROM version, though there is slightly more of the latter, including a new opening sequence. Willy's features still devolve occasionally into a two-dots-and-a-squiggle smiley face, but none of the other characters suffer from this odd malady, perhaps because they have less screen time. The animation is not breathtaking, but it is funny, abundant and well-executed. One of the original game's more peculiar quirks that has survived into the new edition is the characters' emphatic sexuality. Between the huge-breasted school nurse, an impossibly well-endowed volleyball player, Willy's tank-topped mom, and teenaged Tiffany who (at one point) leaps out of her bath to towel-whip Willy, a person might wonder whether he is playing a Steve Meretzky game rather than a game intended for young people. This is not a bad thing per se, but it is odd for a game about a pre-adolescent hero to have such an adolescent sensibility. It's all of a piece, though. The smirking, adolescent sexiness goes hand in hand with the self-indulgent, immature performances of the actors, which are no better than what one might expect from a high school drama club. The only mature performance in the game comes from Andrew DeRycke as Willy's beleaguered dad, and given the company he keeps, it's no wonder that the guy is beleaguered. There is little in the world more cruel to the ear than the sound of presumably normal adults gurgling in thick-tongued googly-woogly voices. The worst offender here is the Narrator (played by Ed Ragozzino, further proof that in the Ragozzinos Dynamix has turned up a family whose calling ought to be mime). The Narrator manages to put exactly the wrong emphasis on every word he speaks, mis-read jokes so that they are no longer funny, and affect a voice that makes Pee-Wee Herman sound like Sir Ralph Richardson all at the same time. Oh, Frabjous Day Of course, not everything about the CD-ROM edition is terrible. There is the game's story, for instance, which hasn't changed a whir from the original. Willy's main goal is still to help his per frog, Horny, win a frog jumping contest so that he (Willy) will have enough money to go to the Nintari videogame championships. Along the way he still has to contend with the school bully, boring teachers, a sinister babysitter, his deceased but talkative grandfather, a family of Japanese tourists, and any number of other fun, oddball characters. Gameplay, too, is the same as before: rather than a complex interface, the player just moves a cursor around the screen, clicking on hotspots to get information about, or to interact with, parts of the environment. Most puzzles demand only simple interactions (\"Use item X at spot Y\"), but they do require enough thought to be challenging even to Willy Beamish deserved, and Dynamix could have done, much better, This is a game best played with the voices turned off. Given that it is a CD-ROM game, that's saying a mouthful. cow Page 10 Computer Gaming World "

"jnside the mdustru intel. pentium @@INTEL '92 Gentlemen, Start Your Simulations! How the Pentium\" Processor Will \"Hot RodÂ» Gamers' Computers by Johnny L. Wilson ture in itself adds a 25% performance boost over the highest rated 486. The screen shot provided with this article illustrates the way the Pentium processor optimizes its processing. Earlier processors funneled all data, whether required as part of the program instructions or as data for a given calculation, through the same bus. As illustrated on the color-coded screen shot, the Pentium uses a bus for both sides of its \"brain\" and the branch prediction further speeds the process. Today's games cat up processor time with the same kind of ravenous zeal for feeding shown by the title character in Spiel1 berg's Jaws. At the same time that computer pilots are looking for more sophisticated shading techniques with no degradation of performance, even the cfficiency of the fastest 486-based processors is topping out. At a time when new genres are moving to the 3-D environment with increasing speed, the processing power of existing machines is being tested to its limit. So, it is very likely that gamers are wondering what the next generation of microprocessors will do for them. Will it help them handle memory more efficiently? Will it speed up frame rates? Will it speed up floating point calculations so that sophisticated shading techniques won't cripple the frame rate? The good news is that the Pentium processor will most definitely speed both floating point and integer calculations. Obviously, this means that the calculations required for dynamic 3-D environments can be completed very quickly and the visual effect will be faster. How did Intel manage to speed up the processing power in this next generation of computer chips? First of all, the secret is to be found in its superscalar structure and use of branch prediction. The superscalar structure means that the CPU has been redesigned to function almost like two Intel 486 processors. It has a true 32-bit CPU and bus, plus separate 8K caches for data and code for double access the former with a 256 bit bus and the latter with a 32 bit bus). Further, the new design features built-in multiply, add and divide features. Most chips use a proliferation of add functions to multiply such that each addition function requires a clock cycle. With the true multiply function, Pentium-based computers will only use one clock cycle to multiply any two numbers. Branch predicrion means that the computer predicts which direction the program will go next. When it's right, it speeds processing. When it is wrong, the program simply backs up to the last known stage, but neither affects the answer to the calculation nor adds to the processing time over what the nonpredicting chip would have used. This fcaHow Fast Is The Pentium\" Processor? for those who want to know exactly how much faster this new generation of chips is likely to be, consider the following. Not only will the Pentium-based computers run at 66 MHz and process 112 MIPS (million instructions per second) compared to 54 MIPS at 50 MHz for 486 DX2 machines, but they will utilize optimization tools which Intel has worked out with compiler publishers. These are software solutions that allow programmers (and hence, gamers) to get more performance out of the chip. Interestingly enough, the optimizers are so useful thar code compiled using the new compiler options will run significantly faster, even on a standard 486 (the new code will not affect 386 owners either positively or adversely). This means that the Pentium processor runs more than twice as fast as today's fastest PC processor. In addition, the company plans to upgrade their technology in order to surpass the 200 MIPS mark by the mid-1990s. Consider also how fast the new chip performs in comparison with industry standards. A non-profit organization called the Systems Performance Evaluation Cooperative (SPEC) has developed a standard group of benchmark programs to measure the performance of computing systems with actual applications. SPCint92 is a numerical rating based on performing the same calculations using six real-world applications in: circuit theory, LISP interpretation, logic design, text compression, spreadsheet calculations and software development.

Add, and Divide application benchmarks which require floating point calculations. A SPECp 92 number of \"1\" would be roughly equivalent to the performance of a standard VAX 780 mainframe performing the same benchmarks. For comparison, consider that an Intel486 processor running at 33 MHz performs at 8.5 SPECfp92 and the new Pentium processor performs at 58.6 SPECfp92. Comparative SPEC performances are presented in chart form on these pages. Note, however, that the best performer on the SPECint92 chart runs at 133 MHz compared to the Pentium processor's 66 MHz; the Pentium pulling less power and creating less heat. Intel's marketing department insists that the Pentium processor will be the first chip to provide performance for under $1.00 per SPEC point. In a similar fashion, Intel uses a group of benchmarks for internal testing. The goal is to significantly improve performance on these benchmarks over previous processors. Using the same battery of applications, the new processor (at 66 MHz) was 14 times faster than the Intel386SX (at 25 MHz) and almost twice as fast as the Intel486DX-2 (at 66 MHz). Tremendous performance boost for applications like Final Analysis  Engineering Simulation 3D Modeling Spreadsheets pabrik Figisu Higher Perfomance For Scientific Modeling, CAD, And More Own Cache SPEC92 Performance What Won't The Pentium Processor Do? Unfortunately, the new chip design won't do anything about memory problems that chain gamers to the 640K barricr. It won't handle those memory management problems that seem to be driving gamers up the wall. Apparently, many of those problems are a result of 16-bit compiler code being written in such a way that part of the program uses DOS and the rest of it uses the processor's protected mode. It is possible that new 32-bit compilers like the one from Watcom and those expected from Microsoft and Borland (among others) will solve much of the problem, but the chip cannot fix this. Intel's Director of Engineering (for microprocessor design), Avtar Saini, explains that designing the architecture so that it ignores the arbitrary 640K low memory limitation would make future chips incompatible with existing chips. The Pentium processor's architecture has been designed so that gamers should still be able to use software purchased for older machines (286 up) with Pentium-based machines.

By next year, there will be an Overdrive chip for these upgradeable Intel-based computers that will enable computer owners to gain something of the benefits of Pentium-based processing. The override chip will not make a computer quite as fast as the true Pentium-based computers, but it is expected to boost 486 DX2 performance by at least 50 percent. In staying true to the architecture, it's nice to know that Intel hasn't forgotten its loyal customer base. Further, the Pentium-based computers will also feature the built-in slot for an Overdrive chip that should allow Pentium processor owners to get a P6 (the next generation of processors) style of performance upgrade. COMPTM Index Summary Inte/386 Inte/486* Pentium Processors What's It To Me? Intel's introduction of the Pentium processor means that an affordable rival to RISC-based workstations is in the offing. The high SPEC ratings mean that gamers will be able to count on faster frame rates, even on programs that use advanced shading techniques. In summary, the upside and downside of the new processor are two sides of the same coin. With new processing power, we can expect games that push the limits of the new technology. This will antiquate the older generation of computers (forcing gamers to buy new machines) while simultaneously giving rise to a new generation of games that we simply have to have. That's a mixed blessing for all of us.

"Breach 3 At least it gets him up the stairs, where he hears enough to know that nefarious plors are afoot! (Like we're all surprised by this). So, before long, Bud has Eric pull Bananacalibur from the stone, to prove he's the one marked by destiny (or at least by designer Bob Bates) to rescue Lorealle. Eric has to pick up five magic items that will get him past The Black Gate (this thing shows up everywhere, doesn't it?), and he's only got a week, so let's go do it! The pitchfork is the first item on the shopping list, and Eric begins his search in the Enchanted Forest. That is, he will, just as soon as he gets past the nasty-looking tree. Looks dry, doesn't it? Anyhow, Eric waltzes past and finds himself in a clearing with branches. Of course they're meant to be moved (hey, there's a lot of obvious stuff in this game; keep that in mind). Underneath is a trap door that leads to ... well, shades of the original Zork! Which is exactly what it is, white house, mailbox, and all. Okay, not really all, but the house is there and so is the mailbox, which contains a winner's sweepstakes notification. A pity Eric is human and not a dwarf, eh? Onward he goes to explore the rest of the GUE, or what's left of it, which isn't much. A couple of Dwarven shops and that's about it. At least Fran (yes, DO talk to him) is helpful. Getting back to the white house (no relation to the one on Pennsylvania Ave), Eric should have no trouble finding a way in, or doing what's necessary. Like I said, it's all obvious. Remember, though, a six foot man doesn't look like a three foot dwarf, unless he's willing to be humble. Coming this Fall! The best-selling science fiction squad level combat game is back and better than ever! Breach 3 will feature state of the art graphics, music and sound effects in addition to the great interface, proper mission builder, plentiful challenging missions and unbeatable playability that you've come to expect! \"Don't be daft. I think you're a perfectly good knight who's just had a run of bad luck. You keep trying, that's the main thing. If I ever got in trouble. I'd much rather be rescued by you than by one of those stuck-up prima donnas who come preening around the castle. So Eric collects the prize, a day at the fun park, which is built before his very eyes! Wow! That's service. Let's check this out. There's a game of Concentration off to one side, just like the one on TV (or used to be on TV; not owning one of those insidious devices, I can't be sure). And yep, Eric has to win to get that magic slingshot! Then, maybe a ride on that neato Ferrous wheel (well, it is made of iron) is order. After all, how else is Eric gonna reach the pitchfork in the branches of the upside-down tree? Speaking of down, the only way down is to jump (after taking the proper precautions, naturally). The rest follows pretty automatically, and it's time to move on for the crescent wrench. So, Eric is now outside a tavern. This is a good time to open up the book, if he hasn't already. Then, he can go inside and try to capture the attention of Bruce the Waiter. When Eric finally gets a look at the menu, what to order should, by now, have been made pretty obvious. Then, it's time for a stroll to the castle. Well, they aren't rolling out the red carpet there, so Eric is just gonna have to find another way in. Try something dangerous (hey, that's what Restore is all about, heh), but check out the bush first. In hardly any time at all, our boy has made it to the rear entrance where he is confronted by, oh no! Killer Turtles!! Good thing he has something to take care of these tortoises.

You Say Tomato, I Say Tomto Psygnosis fans who have found pleasure in helping hapless lemmings find their way to safery will enjoy aiding Terry in the attempt to rescue his true love, Tracy. Although not quite as addictive as Lemmings or Ob No! More Lemmings, Bill's Tomato Game is still capable of capturing one's attention for hours on end. Except for several puzzles, difficulty builds well on a scale of increasing complexity. Playing time should extend for several weeks until one is able to master all 100 levels and rescue the damsel (or is that vegetable) in distress. Those itching for joystick action, however, should avoid this offering as there is actually nothing to shoot. In fact, joysticks are not even supported. All input is accomplished with the use of either the mouse or keyboard in this game of logic and timing. Plump, Juicy and Delicious Graphics are a mix of high and low resolution images. Hires 16-color art is employed for the Radio and High ho and High Score Screens, while each level of puzzles makes use of 32-color low resolution images. Overall, visual quality is very high, providing an attractive environment. Audio accompaniment is also of high caliber. Background music and digitized sounds effectively enhance game atmosphere and can be toggled on and off if desired. There should be no need to turn them off, though, as the catchy tunes and realistic sound effects add immensely to the game without becoming monotonous even after extended play. In the Basket Unfortunately, Bill's Tomato Game employs disk-based copy protection (as well as manual-based) and cannot be installed to a hard drive. Psygnosis promised almost a year ago that they would be moving away from disk-based protection and making provision for hard drive installation. So far, they have not made good on this promise. Still, the game loads quickly and, with IMB of RAM or more, there is little disk access during play. The documentation is comprised of Psygnosis familiar four-language manual (English, French, German and Italian), its contents sufficient for instructional purposes and quite humorous. Also included is a handy \"bookmarkÂ» which acts as a quick reminder of mouse controls and item descriptions. How About a Game of Squash? Bill's Tomato Game is one of Psygnosis best Amiga offerings of late and is much more original and enjoyable than any of their other releases during the past six months. It is the most entertaining and addictive Amiga title I have played in a long time. Puzzle difficulty and variety is balanced, and evidently a great deal of care and thought has gone into its creation. Amiga owners who have been longing for an excellent means of challenging their mental powers now have a valid reason to visit their local computer store. Bill's Tomato Game is more enjoyable than soup de jour or a fresh garden salad, and has fewer calories. In fact, spending time with Terry Tomato is guaranteed to get the juices flowing and paste a smile on your face. Cow LORDS OF DESTINY Discover the pbm game sweeping the nation!

"Deview The Gilded Cage Wi lithe Avator ver Baba na Underwond? by Doug Sencat Underworld Libyrinth of Worlds Iltima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds, is the second of Origins' and Looking Glass Technologies' 3-D dungeon games. With the success of their first \"you are there\" environment in Underworld I, the folks at Origin have gone on to a more ambitious plot within the same environment. Surprise, surprise, the Avatar is needed again. The rubes in Britannia can't seem to do anything for themselves. So, they are once again a potential targer for destruction. Fortunately, they have the Avatar to save them, on his supposed ninth quest for them. This time, the Guardian of Black Gate fame has reappeared (as I'm sure most players of that game certainly expected). This enigmatic red-faced nemesis has decided to stop Lord British's interference in his works directly, by sealing off Castle British entirely from the ourside world. He has surrounded the castle in Blackrock, a substance impervious to magical and physical manipulation. The imprisonment will isolate both the heroes of Britannia and the Avatar himself, while the Guardian wreaks havoc outside, converting followers, inciting warfare, and in general doing nasty, evil things. There is hope. The Avatar must descend into the centuries-old dungeons of the castle in search of clues about the Guardian's sources of power. Before long, this search takes the Avatar on a multiple-world quest of exploration to eight centers of the Guardian's strength, each of which must be nullified to save Britannia, and the Multiverse, from the Guardian's manipulation. The Rudiments of Disbelief Character creation is a short and simple process, since this is a solo-adventure.

"DUBIND words are a little crude, they give the feeling that one's choices matter. Following both of these problems comes the feeling that the world is non-dynamic. The Avatar often feels like the only active person in the multiverse, which reduces the game's involving atmosphere. Ar times it feels like the Avatar is the only capable individual in the entire universe. Lord British wanders around doing nothing, and all the Avatar's companions complain that they wish they could help, but won't. The few times assistance is given by other people, it feels contrived. Granted, the player should take the active role, but the game would have seemed much more rich and involved if other people were doing things independently of the Avatar's actions, especially as time passes. Instead, the NPCs are reduced to information sources and training posts. LHYSICILOR Hell, Bene, let us resume the questioning I snad askinge cost thou come from?

As it is, the situation is comparable to walking into a doorway but getting stuck by catching a la one's shoulder on the door frame. Some of this should be automatic. It's fine and good to have the Avatar's body take up 3-dimensional space, but they've made it awkward. Another small but very irritating problem is the game's inability to put things down where the player wants.

These opposite extremes can really Ultima IV) which would have given the game throw one off. a much freer conversation scope. While keySkills within the game were largely disillusioning. While they had a definite affect upon the character's actions, few of them were useful or important. Most of the skills just help in nonessential situations, or can be obviated entirely. Despite not having the Â«swimming\" proficiency, my character could swim well enough to get everywhere necessary. Those few skills which seem to have some potential can be easily replicated by spell casting ability. I was rather depressed, using a \"Tinker\" character, to find that the \"Open\" spell was much better than picking locks, and there exists a spell which repairs armor better than any tinker. The only real skills which seem to be necessary are Mana, Casting and Combat Knowledge. One reason for these problems is that the designers wanted the game to be solvable by any profession â another contrivance. If a Mage is just as good as a Tinker at every puzzle, why does it matter which you are? Indeed, if a Tinker can get through the Academy Final Test of Magic (one of the puzzles in the game), isn't something wrong? The player can only find so many conveniently placed wands (in case he wasn't a spell caster) before it seems entirely phony. Many times, the game seems much more frustrating than enjoyable, due to the elements listed above, and due to the nature of the puzzles. There were a few convoluted mazes in the game which made me want to toss my computer out the window. Including mazes in the game can extend the play-duraPage 38 Computer Gaming World "

"Deview to start from scratch. Ultima has abused the Avatar long enough. If they want to keep him, they should at least give him some sense of power and grandeur. If they want a first level character, have it be another follower of the Virtues, a new novice who will rise and save the world in the Avatar's name. I know it'll be hard for Origin to let that plot-gimmick go, but I think it's long past due. tion of the game with little effort. Few players the bulk of the puzzles.

It would have been which took the player's character outside! nice if the members of the castle could provide more support. For example, if the player has HOJA been wandering around for hours getting absolutely nowhere, one of the NPCs could provide a clue, which could become more explicit if the player still doesn't make progress. This would be perfectly feasible since the entire population of the castle is supposedly working on the dilemma, together with FEBIH the Avatar. This could ease frustration, while also making the NPCs seem more involved and alive. Further, the NPCs could, at infreFinally, why is it that the Avatar, savior of quent intervals, descend into the Labyrinth Britannia eight times over, enters the game as themselves, perhaps to solve a class-specific a first level character?

However, I can recommend it only with reservations. Hard-core Ultima players will definitely want to play the game to continue the Avatar's exploits. Further, those who love 3-D dungeons will find much enjoyment. Still, those who purchase the game should be aware that they are in for a long and grueling quest, which will task their patience. While testing their stamina is a good test of the Avatar, it won't suit all gamers. Further, the game is in many ways a gilded cage: it looks very nice, and is in many ways comfortable, but it is still a cage. The contrived plot and setting have the player imprisoned, forced to follow a certain set path to freedom. By the time I finally saw daylight again, emerging from the Labyrinth, I must admit that it wasn't exultation i felt, but sheer relief. Frankly, I don't want to go back to that prison again.

"world. Still, when approaching an object, texture and detail remain amazingly intact, more so than the competition. Clearly, smooth 3-D graphic scrolling is Valour's key selling point, enhanced by the overall quality of its 256-color VGA graphics. However, next to graphics in caliber is the game's documentation. Both creative and entertaining, the manual is written with just the right amount of information and humor, making the experience of pouring through its pages an enjoyable one. 152 EN WS   overly distracting to play. I died from lack of food and poor health so often just when the game was getting interesting that I soon tired of the whole process. Fantasy adventures should remove one from the distractions of real life, not impose an overdose of these minute distractions upon them. Another distraction to the flow of the game concerns interaction with the NPCs encountered. More often than nor, conversing with the local inhabitants is a reperitive process of issuing \"Whar is\" and Where is\" questions which result predominantly in the same pithy answers (though insults do show greater variation). A general lack of atmosphere also prevails in Valour, the primary culprit being the background music and sound effects, or rather their dearth. Sound effects are sparse and music is almost entirely lacking Is There Any Value to Valour? By now, one must be wondering if Legends of Valour has any value to offer. In spite of all its failings, yes, it does. The interface, though a triflc cluttered, is well designed and offers good mouse and keyboard support. Smooth scrolling 3-D graphics, as claimed, are exceptional and provide the player with a well detailed window on the world of Mitteldorf. The size of the display window is adjustable (reducing its size makes play acceptable on slower systems), though, even at its largest size the view provided is about 50 percent smaller than that of Ultima UnderThe Stuff of Which Legends are Made? As already stated, Legends of Valoursuffers from a significant number of weaknesses. Its restrictions on game saves, numerous distractions, general lack of atmosphere, and absence of sufficient audio enhancements all contribute to an overall lack of enjoyment and staying power. While the graphics are as good as claimed, they cannot make up for the game's numerous deficiencies. I have high hopes for SSI's upcoming releases: Dark Sun, Eye of the Beholder III and Veil of Darkness. All portend to be excellent products. As far as Legends of Valour is concerned, though, I believe the wise choice would be to leave the task of discovering what legends are made of to some other adventurer.

"Devlet Return To Known Space unami's Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriar by Charles Ardai arry Niven's Ringworld is enormous. Not the novel, which weighs in at a tidy L 342 pages, but the Ringworld itself, the huge alien artifact which gives Niven's bestknown work its title. At one point, Niven likens the Ringworld to 50 feet of Christmas ribbon circling a candle. Only, in place of the ile, imagine a sun â and suddenly one is dealing with a Christmas ribbon that has three million times the surface area of the Earth. The size of the thing is one of the crucial points of the book, and it is inevitably the one that suffers in the computer game adaptation from Tsunami. There are only so many screens of the Ringworld wall that one can scroll past before getting bored. Â«How could Speaker stand it?\" Niven writes. \"Hour after hour of driving... beneath the belly of proach the extreme foreground), and the game is relentlessly faithful to Niven's conceptions; but this is all beside the point. The point is that the game resembles a cartoon. One does have to solve puzzles to unlock\" each section of the game, so the player does have something to do, but Niven fans should not come to the game expecting to have a chance to roam free on their beloved Ringworld. What they should expect, instead, is a single, new tale of Show the Ringworld, with them participating minimally in the telling. Chmeee For Wu and Wu For Chmeee The story picks up shortly after the end of the novel and, in fact, maps itself to the novel quite well. In place of jaded adventurer Louis Wu we get jaded mercenary Quinn, a friend of Louis Wu's. In place of the nameless Kzin, Speaker-To-Animals, we get Speaker's son, Seeker-Of-Vengeance. In place of sassy, sexy Tecla Brown we get sassy, sexy Miranda Rees. In place of insane Puppeteer Nessus running the mission for his own purposes we get a different Puppeteer, also \"Hindmost\" (that is, pulling the strings), though this one only appears in holographic form. In short, we get a new (but not very) band of four adventurers out to reclaim Slaver technology from the backward Ringworlders. LINGWORLI this...artifact.\" So Tsunami gives us three and lets it go at that. With so much room, the Ringworld is home to an unimaginably huge number of alien cultures; Tsunami shows us five, and shows them to us briefly. There is probably no way of getting around this limitation short of nutring the game a couple of CDs and spending a decade or two writing it. Still, Tsunami has to face the fact that it has chosen to adapt an essentially impossible-to-adapt work. One could create a comprehensive simulation of War and Peace's Russia before one could exhaust the slightest fraction of the Ringworld's surface. Readers might wonder why I mention this at all â surely Niven himself didn't exhaust the possibilities of his creation in his novel, and no one gets on his case about it. Yet, as I keep stressing in my reviews, there is a difference between a novel and an interactive game. A novel, like a film, is an author-directed journey through however immense a landscape. A game, on the other hand, is supposed to be a player-directed journey. In a game, the entire landscape, or as much of it as possible, must be accessible. Not here. In Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch, Tsunami has taken the opposite tack, shuttling the player through a storyline so rigidly constructed that one might as well be in the hands of an intrusive, Dickensian author who says explicitly, Â«Now, Dear Reader, I shall take you to see the colony of the Canyon People...\" Never before has there been a game so movie-like in its construction. There are great strerches of action during which the player literally does nothing. The last several minutes of the story contains several events in which the player could participare, bur he is never given the chance to do so. Even when the player's input is requested it is often irrelevant (i.c., all of the player's choices produce the same outcome), or else it sets in motion an animated sequence over which the player has no control. The animated sequences are well done (though the graphics sometimes become embarrassingly rough when the characters apRevenge of the Patriarchi Ladan MS-005 3.5\" VGA TITLE: SYSTEM: GRAPHICS: SOUND SUPPORT: Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch IBM VGA Ad Lib, Pro Audio Spectrum, Roland, Sound Blaster $59.95 PRICE: PROTECTION: DESIGNERS: PUBLISHER: Documentation Look-up John Jarrett Chris Hoyt.

"Telecommuting to the Cyburbs ach workday evening, millions of workers flee urban areas all over the world in order to reach their comfortable suburban homes. There is something important within the human condition that makes everyone want to have a place where they are not only comfortable, but feel a sense of identity, importance and inclusion. Ilustration by Henk Dawson For many computer gamers, the commute to more comfortable surroundings is both faster and further than ever before. Instead of commuting to and from the suburbs, they compute to and from the cyburbs. What are these cyburbs? They are communities of online gamers where one's neighbor may be geographically located a full continent away. They are both real and imaginary locations where gamers can find a sense of identity (or another identity), importance and inclusion. They are cultures and sub-cultures with their own social dynamics of language, ritual and politics. According to a recent CGW poll, almost 40 percent of our readership is connected to one on-line service or another. So, it is very likely that many are already effecting their own great escapes, and others will be interested in what it means to do so. With this in mind, we have created a survey of on-line games and a host of special features for this month's theme section. This is our on-line world and welcome to it. May 1993 Page 59 "

"als vival). Each module enhances the player's ability by increasing firepower, movement, speed or vision. The catch is that the player is limited on what kinds of modules he can carry. Each module bay is assigned a level, and only modules of that level or lower may be installed. As the player earns points, the level of the bays advances and the player can add modules on a higher level. Experienced players will assist the \"newbie\" in knowing what modules he needs for cach individual city. One of the goals David Whatley had in designing this game was creating a multi-player universe that was easy to learn but difficult to master. CyberStrike excels in its simplicity. The keyboard controls are easily mastered and the game mechanics uncomplicated. The only necessary option I find missing is a timer display that shows how long the player has been on-line. At $6 per hour there will be some real surprises at the end of the month. Of course, once I got in, my friend and I played for nearly twelve straight hours. I do understand the meaning of the term \"game-lock.\" Although I spent the majority of my time for this review in ALPHA, the training city, and, as a result, was able to move about and survive pretty well in the beginner-level cities, I was usually instantly annihilated in the upper levels when Whatley jacked me into higher levels just to get a feel for the game. The depth of the upper level cities is utterly amazing. I was really impressed with the graphic portrayal of fog. You can't get more real than this. The fog was the most believable effect that I saw, but I was dumbfounded at its ability to portray reality. The storms were well done, but I discovered it rains inside the tunnels just as hard as it does outside them (hopefully, that's just a beta-version quirk). One of the basic necessities of the upper levels is an Infrared module, which enhances images in dark or fog. According to Whatley, there are over 50 modules which a player can pick up when another player is destroyed (those little suckers go everywhere) or purchase with points (earned for each second of sur$ Attenpting to pick up Module. * Installed Rapid Fire noduic! * Attenpting to pick Up Module. & Attenpting to pick up Module. # Installed High Jump nodule! * Attenpting to pick up Module. * Attcnpting to pick up Module. 2 Installed High Speed nodule! warcloud MOS just wasted by B-hon. The Killing Yields (Conclusion) I noted from the multi-player games bulletin board that I was not the only person who had problems getting into the game. My modem was not working properly with the software. The thing that some people are having to do, from terminal mode within the software, is to give their modem a direct command, 2988830888 \"AT&CI\" to wake their modem up. Then, the software is generally ready to call and connect, if the comm ports are set up properly. Simutronics cheerfully assists anyone having trouble getting 2 iallallallall into the game (not just reviewers). Leave E-mail and they will assist you, I guarantee it's worth it. CyberStrike is addictive, action-filled and downright fun. The violence is bloodless (since everyone immediately gets carried back to their bases and receives new Cyberpods), but the challenge is exhilarating. Since it is played against real people instead of artificial intelligence, it varies every time it is played. And it will be played a lot!

"i en mense Teleqamming Mining the BBS On-line Games A survey of gems to be found on private bulletin board systems 5/ by William J. Shefski The geology of the Bulletin Board System (BBS) scene anywhere is ever-shifting. Private boards come and go, and so do the games I they carry to attract and amuse their faithful callers. Just as distributors of commercial games show little mercy towards an unsuccessful game, the cruel dictates of available hard-drive space cannot tolerate the presence of an on-line game which fails to attract players. The evolutionary pressures of the BBS world are strong, and only the fittest seem to survive. This article covers some of the games suitable for use on local bulletin bulletin board systems. Even CGW readers who do not operate their own BBS may want to look for the same or similar games on local boards in their areas. To offer some guidance in this maze of on-line games, I have rated the games on a three point system. The highest number represents games which are so interesting that a gamer could fill his/her whole rime rarion with it, if the BBS ser-up would allow it. The medium rating suggests games which are amusing enough to keep a player coming back often, but not necessarily losing any sleep if they missed a session here and there. The lowest rated games are probably best avoided. Nearly without exception, these on-line games generate a bulletin that can be posted somewhere on the board. Some keep track of the high scores for the month, week, day and/or all-time. This is an important aspect, maintaining high caller interest through the gamers' desire for cyber-glory. (Please note: Because of the shifting nature of the BBS scene, the telephone numbers and addresses listed here may have been changed by the time this issue reaches the stands. No guarantees as to the currency of the boards they may or may not reach is possible.) generate stats. This is a perfect use of the computing power of the host machine. This game and sports games like this generate a high degree of user interest. Sooner or later the big sports game companies will realize the potential of this forum and the deficiencies of Crunch will be apparent. For now, it's just about all that's out there. DRAW POKER: (INS Software BBS, 304-733-4148) This is one of a series of well-executed card games implemented by the prolific Rusty Johnson. Most of the others are solitaire, but Draw Poker is one step above that. It's five card draw one-on-one versus the computer. GET OIL IN KUWAIT: (Gordon Wheat & Andrew Brown, Amoeba Ware, Nuclear Amoeba BBS, 410-4791828) Although Saddam makes no appearance in this game, it is an interesting arcade-type puzzler. The gamer must pump the black gold from pockets of various shapes and sizes under the sands. Then, the oil must be removed before one's drilling rigs are destroyed by gas pockets and dynamite blasts. GLOBAL WAR: (Joel Bergen, ProVision BBS, 206-3536966) With a bit more than a passing resemblance to Risk, Global War provides a widespread and active door. The map is a bit different than the one in the boardgame classic, as are some of the minor rules. Many games can be played at once and there are provisions for team games. The computer resolves all combat and there is an interesting allowance made for missed calling days (i.e. Armies awarded at the beginning of one's turn are multiplied by the number of days missed.) Also available is a terminal emulation program called GWTERM which can, when running in the caller's computer, use the machine's graphics capabilitics. Not only do the maps refresh almost instantly, they are much more attractive. It also allows the use of a mouse, a unique feature in an on-liner. KANNONS & KATAPULTS: (Alan Davenport, Al's Cabin BBS, 717-686-3037) An entire game of K OK can be played during any logon. Player and computer are king or queen of an all-text kingdom, taking turns managing or defending kingdom and castle with cannon, catapult (oddly, more powerful than the cannon), soldiers and assassins. Beware, the computer fights back fairly well. LABYRINTH: (Randy Hunt and Mark Goodwin, The Lighthouse BBS, 207-942-6575) Gamers looking for an interesting quest simply must wander through this 160-room text adventure game. 2 LADDERS: (Al Lawrence, Sunrise Software, Sunrise-80 BBS, 404-256-9525) This is a rather simple dice-rolling game where the possible rolls on two dice are ladders which have to be climbed in order to win. 1 BBS BOWL: (James Fair, The Fishing Hole BBS, 615-6465550) This game features bowling on an unforgiving lane. Indeed, a real bowler might say it was over-oiled. Still, this features an attractive screen and it is likely that the smart-alecky commentary will bring the player back to try again. It has an increasingly more common \"hold-back\" enhancement for the registered version make-up days. This allows the caller to play their daily limit of games from days they missed during the month. BUGS! (Rick Salinas, Dark Side of the Moon BBS, 209225-6824) This arcade game invites players to take on the role of exterminator and slaughter the crawlers. Gruesome ... and snooze-some. CRUNCH LEAGUE FOOTBALL: (Stephen David, Crunchware, Temple of Nine BBS, 703-820-6824) Allows the board to moderate a full blown football league with divisions, stars and a Super Bowl game. Users can draft fictional players who Page 64 Computer Gaming World "

"Telemainino and places them. Spaces open up by matching pip cards that add to a total of 10. No room for a face card? It's \"Game Over!\" Scored in the manner of duplicate bridge tournaments (as are many of the efforts from this company) where everyone plays the same hands. Thus, users are measured against each other using the same challenges. MAHJONGG PYRAMID: (Mike Wilson, Secret Service BBS, 304-429-6838) Unfortunately, Mahjongg Pyramid is no more than a variation on regular pyramid solitaire with uninteresting tiles used instead of cards. MAT MANIA: (Hack, Spiko and Doctor Z, the Cutting 977 Edge BBS, 203-233-8993) This is an all-text game where the player names, trains and manages a wrestler. Matches can be picked at random by the computer, or one can choose a grudge march against a particular baddie (or goodie). The wrestlers, computerand human-controlled, are ranked according to whom they have beaten. The text of the action scrolls by, and one's wrestler finds himself in and out of hammerlocks, pounding his opponent with Brain Busters, and climbing the turnbuckles. Training allows improvement of attributes and even the invention of a trademark Â«rasslin' move. There could be no better testament to how surprisingly entertaining the game is than when, while tolerantly looking over his shoulder while he played, a certain non-computer-game-interested spouse of a certain reviewer couldn't contain herself. \"Go for the pin! Go for the pin!\" she urged. It is truly an impressive little game. MONTE CARLO SOLITAIRE: (Al Lawrence, Sunrise-80 BBS, 404-256-9525) Players try to match up card pairs on a square grid. Then, they consolidate. Frankly, there are better ways to waste one's valuable recreational time. MC RACE: (Motor City Software) Drag racing is the theme of this texr-based game where one is required to maintain and race a rod. The excitement level probably depends on how aroused one gets by the real ones. 88 ON THE EDGE: (JNS Software BBS, 304-733-4148) 177 Rusty Johnson has provided an intriguing solitaire effort in this game which is built on a 4X4 grid of open spaces. Face cards are placed around the edge and, of course, the gamer turns over cards POST TIME RACING: (Parole Software, The Parole Board BBS, 919-965-4696) If one is enough of a horse racing fan to thrill to the sight of three \"horses\" â represented by what appear to be hair pins â stutter across the screen, this game could be a good bet. Otherwise, one might be better off watching text phosphor burn into the monitor than trying to pick the winners in this one. 1 PUZZLE: (Rusty Johnson, JNS Software BBS, 304-7334148) Consider this game to be an electronic version of one of those party favors where squares with numbers are moved around until the numbers are in order. Between the host board's computer, the home computer and the phone system in between, enough energy is burned in one play of this game to buy a six-pack of Cracker Jacks, in which the same game will likely be found as a prize. SCRABBLE: (Christopher Hall, P.O. Box 26025, Austin TX, 78755-0025) Anyone looking for an excellent electronic rendition of the word game by which all others are judged\" will do well to check out this version. The host board houses the dictionary, adds up the points and keeps track of all the moves in up to 20 games at a time. The \"challenge\" rule is not invoked, but a player has only three chances to input a valid word or the turn is lost. Oddly, some proper names are acceptable in this version. That would take some getting used to for the Scrabble purist, but it's well worth it. Could there be any better glory than being listed as the leader in the Scrabble bulletin of one's local BBS? We think not. COMPUTER COMPUTER TRACK TENNIS SPORTS GAMES IBM.APPLE IL C-64 THE MOST REALISTIC STRATEGY/SIMULATION COMPUTER GAMES ON THE MARKET TODAY!

"Jelenama SINK 'EM: (Jim Wilcox, IHS Software, P.O. Box 5103, Macon, GA, 31208) This Battleship look-alike allows \"fleets\" of 10 players plus the computer to shoot five shots a day at each other. 108 STACK 'EM: () & W Software 9426 N. China Pink Way, Crystal River FL, 34428) Anyone who can spell Tetris knows the score. 27 SUPER SLOTS: () & W Software 9426 N. China Pink way, Crystal River FL, 34428) Who could dislike a game that starts out with \"The House will stake you to $500,000$? This is a five-spot slot that spins cherries and lemons, bells and bars (not pictures, the words.) The progressive jackpot starts at $100,000,000. Addicrs might play all day, if the sysop would let them. 7 THE PIT: (James R. Berry, Midas Touch Software, MTS BBS, 806-797-2239) A tolerably interesting fantasy-themed work, this game might easily be labeled, Â«Let's Pound Each Other.\" This one at least tries to go beyond the text readout of how many hit points have been lost by letting the player's character maneuver around the arena with the number pad. There is nothing that will excite the hard core electronic dungeon diver, but it's a hair above the rest of the Pound'em Pack. 179 TRADE WARS: (Chris Sherrick & John Morris, The Aban1 doned Land BBS, 702-746-1364 & 65) For many players cruising the boards, there is no other on-liner than Trade Wars. Many versions are circulating and they are, apparently, highly configurable. Except for the core concepts and basic mechanics, no two boards seem to carry the same exact game. The basic format is that the galaxy has 1000 sectors to explore. The trader can build up his or her wealth moving commodities and building a fighting force. At higher levels there are planets to acquire and even terraforming. Keep an eye out for the computer enemy and, of course, for fellow users. The beginning player has a long apprenticeship, but the persistent can build a large and complex empire. This game will be around for a while, in one form or another. TRIPLE YAHTZEE: (Al Lawrence, Sunrise Software, Sunrise-80 BBS, 404-256-9525) The enduring poker-dice game has seen many a programming exercise. This is Yahtzee times three, where one can place one's dice roll in any of the three consecutive games. It could conceivably serve as a twoor three-player game, all at the same calling computer. \"TRIVIA TIC TAC TOE: (Mike Wilson, Secrer Service BBS, 304-429-6838) There are a lot of trivia doors circulating. This one does a bit more than just add up how many a player answered correctly. The gamer places an \"O\" in the square if an answer is correct. If not, X gets the spot. 88 VIDEO POKER: (Worldwide Programming, The Lighthouse BBS, 209-252-7968) Just like it sounds, Video Poker is a pleasantly-rendered Jacks-or-Better coin-eater. The computer keeps track of how many pairs, two-pairs, three-of-kinds, etc. the player scores. Then, it generates a bulletin with the records in each. As much action as any casino (or the corner bar), and one isn't likely to lose the rent money â unless calling long distance. Il WHEEL OF FORTUNE: (Michael Goetz, The Speak Easy BBS, 407-291-4626) Vanna in ANSI? (No. But it had to be said, didn't it?) \"The Famous Wheel\" is not present in its familiar form. The numbers spin more like the \"Showcase Spin\" prop on \"The Price is Right\" but the word puzzle game is the same. For the solitary player.

Most users of the Internet have accounts through their association with an organization with Internet/Usenet access; usually a large company with government connections or a university. Some universities do offer accounts to private individuals for a fee, but most restrict access to members of the school. The only other way for one to get access is through a private bulletin board system (BBS) that is an official Usenet/Internet site. Many private BBSs have access to a limited number of Usenet news groups and offer limited e-mail capability. Finding such a board is a matter of poking around the BBSs in your area. Phone numbers and information can usually be found in local computer weekly magazines and at local user-group meetings. There are several good sources of information on the Internet/Usenet. A nice overview of worldwide networks is John Quarterman's The Matrix, Computer Networks and Conferencing Systems Worldwide published by Digital Press, 12 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730 (800) 343-8321.

But in Freddy Pharkas, Frontier Pharmacist, even a scrawny, sissified, one-eared Pharmacist can be a good guy. Al Lowe, creator of Leisure Suit Larry, spins a yarn of schoolmarms and chorus girls with hearts o'gold, cowboys and Indians, and varmints and heroes. It's the brand-new, age-old tale of Freddy Pharkas, a gunslinger who gave it all up for his love of pharmacology. Together with his faithful Indian companion, Srini Bagdnish, Freddy sets out to save bucolic, boring Coarsegold from a fate worse than Hollywood adaptation. So don't just groan at all those old horse-opera clichÃ©s. Be one. Strap on your spurs for a saga that skewers every Western under the sun. Mosey on down to your software store and ask for Freddy Pharkas, Frontier Pharmacist, And smile when you say that. 23:3DD22 PEARES FRONTIER PHARAOST.

This is not nearly enough to carry all the quest items one will acquire, special items that can cast spells, and potions to restore health points and mana. If it were not for the mana trick (explained later), players would be popping back and forth to the store after every other fight, a rather large nuisance and a process which I believe would quickly degrade the performance of the game. The Reception Upon entering the field of play, the first you encounter i Snake 1 Snake. A Battle Begins! things one will see are the three structures that control a player's life. There is the Tavern where one may read posts from players and easily determine who is there. One may also converse with anyone in this area by clicking on their name and typing a message. Next, is the castle-like structure called the Guild Hall that serves as a training hall, general store and pawnshop. Before doing anything else, one should enter the keep and purchase equipment. Lastly, there is the volcano itself with a top and bottom entrance. The bottom entrance is for people who have saved their position and need to step out to the store to get a cup of mana or such like. One may teleport out and re-enter here without having to slog all the way back down on foot. Combat works as a series of rounds, and each member of the party arty gers to act once every round. Each round one may hack with a weapon, pon, cast a spell, use a skill or use something in one's pack. When all the party has been polled, their actions results and those of the monsters are shown in the small text window below the picture of the monsters. At this point, the player may be dead. A beginning player should expect to die a lot. However, in most cases, someone else in the party will be able to cast a resuscitate spell and bring the player back to life. 116175 Refresh yourself in the fountains nearbu. but do not take long!

If all of the party dies, one is sent back to the opening screen and may enter again at the top entrance. After a while, most fighting will become routine. All members in the party will cast death darts and most of the monsters will die. Those that are left will eventually succumb. Fortunately, most fights may be fled from. Since fighting takes more time than fleeing, Choose Your Action this is welcome for those in a hurry to comK plete a quest before leaving. Except for location-triggered encounters, the number of opposing monsters is nicely tailored to the number of people in the party. Quest for Story This is not the case for quest encounters. Quests are the staple dier of adventurers in the volcano. The rewards for completing them are quite generous. In some cases, skills or stats are boosted or weapons are gained, rather than experience. Even at the highest levels, the later quests were quite exciting. I found my palms sweaty on several occasions, especially during the Quest of the Four Parapets. The final battle took about a half hour and was nip and ruck for a party of ninereench ro thirty-fifth level players. I was a level 19 wizard ar the time. I did not die during the fight, but was occasionally down to under ten hit points. About 20 minutes into the fight, I had no mana points and was using items to cast spells. I had one charge left in a Stalf of Life when Arnakkian finally expired. In the Enlikil quest, I was at level 25 and with a level 35 barbarian and a level 84 cleric. Several times during the running fights I was dead and these two players were down to 5,000 or fewer hit points. Since many high level monsters can deliver blows of multiple thousands of hit points we might well have all died. Most quests can be completed in one or two hours and may be resumed at a later time if necessary. A couple of the quests require the participation of another party. I thought this was a nice touch, and it was not hard to find another party that would cooperate. Party Time There is a social life growing under the volcano.

An interesting product has just landed on my desk which, I'm sad to say, I have not had adequate time to thoroughly examine. Howcver, Aide de Camp from HPS Simulations looks like a product that I've long dreamed about. It is a \"design your own play-by-email kit\" for board wargames. In other words, I could pull virtually any Avalon Hill, GDW, SPI, 3W or other board wargame off my shelf and, using this program, put it \"on disk\" for casy electronic transfer of my moves and combat. It takes some time to create the maps and counters (they are graphically represented, not just lists of hex numbers and unit IDs), but it is a product I've longed to see. Designer Scott Hamilton said he created it for his own personal use and has now marketed it. I can't wait to spend some time with Aide de Camp. Battle of the Network Wargamers Last issue, in the preface to the Empire Deluxe tournament announcement, I hypothesized, \"Wouldn't it be great to get the Command HQ players on CompuServe to play the ones on Prodigy?\" Well, the truth is that they actually have been. This issue, I'd like to report on it. Command HQ is a rousing, real-time game designed for wargamers connected by modem. The map represents the entire globe, and units represents armies, fleets and air forces in a grand strategic scale. Each group of CHQ players had a leader emerge to parlay the ground rules for the competition. Representing CompuServe was Bob (76170,1537) while the legions from Prodigy selected Â«The General\" Robert E. Lee, Jr [BSWW20A) (and, yes, that's his real name). They agreed to set up four teams of five players each. Each player would play two games against each opponent from the same team, for a total of ten games per player with each player initiating one phone call against each opponent (to keep the phone bills reasonable). They agreed that all games would be the \"????\" scenario, where each player begins with a capital on a world where the cities and resources have been placed randomly. Due to the possibility of beginning with an obviously unbalanced start, \"restart\" rules were created, agreed upon and enforced to assure fairness for individual games played. Interestingly, both network teams had their own ideas about what the restart rules should be, so each devised their own set and whoever was the caller determined which set of rules would be used for that match. The Call of Destiny Both networks generated a lot of messages about this tournament. Mostly it was the players recalling their tales of games won and lost. Some of the stories were very amusing (so much so that many bystanders would stop in to read them on-line). The Prodigy Players got off to an early lead over the CompuServe Comm-rades, but shortly after the halfway mark, CompuServe had pulled up very close in the win/loss column. This inspired Prodigy leader R.E. Lee to post the following address to his troops: \"Team Prodigy, Fhall in! AttecehhhnnnSHUN! Har Ease. \"Men, I don't need to tell you the importance of our mission. The very fate of the free world lies on our shoulders, not to mention the braggin rights for all the CHQ players on our Prodigy ladder, which you represent. Â«We have been chosen to perform a sacred duty for God, country and the Prodigy Information Service and in this effort we must not fail!

He listed symptoms as including a reduced ability to type due to hasty messaging back and forth during a real time game (sighting a sample sentence as Â«Nivce glame, yu relly suurpised m wit tat clap atach!!!\"), strained relations with members of the opposite sex, dreams involving little blue and red squares, and the use of the phrase \"warmongering enemy\" in everyday conversation. There Were Only Winners This was one of those cross-cyberspace rivalries where every player was certainly a winner. We all know that there is a kindred spirt among fellow wargamers, and in this tournament it lived and laughed aloud. Unfortunately, when I had to write this article, two games remained unfinished (and the suspense is excruciating!). The score stood ar Prodigy 100, CompuServe 98. However, CompuServe had more winning \"reams\" than Prodigy did, so as far as this observer is concerned, both networks can claim a legitimare victory. Let me end this month's column with a roster of the matches. Perhaps next time, you'll be on-line and enjoying this kind of wargaming camaraderie. CGW Mark Dave W. Barry Stuart Tim M. Tim K.

Sometimes the battle might be miles away and trying to claw for altitude while covering territory at only 75 knots (150 knots typical climb speed divided by two for the network half speed) can eat up a lot of time. In addition, to receive full credit for any kills scored, the player has to fly all the way home and land. In fact, the program won't let the player exit unless they land or bail out/get shot down. At times, I found myself hanging around the fight long after fuel and ammo dictated a withdrawal, just to avoid the long flight home. Ar 10 cents a minute, all this droning can add up. I would have liked to occasionally see the option of airborne start points. Something like five thousand feet of altitude within friendly airspace and not so close to enemy aircraft that it would provide an unfair advantage would be nice. Also, if I decide to egress the fight and get well clear of any enemy triangle with common edges. Once a nation there be cliques or a holier than thou attitude aircraft, let me exit with full credit.

"Aito Ztrategy you are firmly planted on the bandit's six, it's time to exit padlock mode. For the final stages of combat, try using the forward-up view, accessed by pressing the \"3\" key followed by the \"Scroll Lock\" key. This will place your HUD at the lower edge of your screen and allow you to see more of the sky directly in ance front of you. By using padlock view, you should now SPEED 0491 have your bandit in view, slightly above your HUD and in the middle of your screen. Increase your turn rate, either by pulling more Gs or executing a series of Yo-yo turns, trading small units of speed for small bites of altitude, to pull your target directly into your HUD. Watch your speed closely; if you stall, the bandit will pull away and ruin your shot. If your speed goes too high, you'll overshoot and the bandit will reverse onto your tail, putting you on the defense! Once you've pulled the bandit in the HUD, it's time to fire. If the bandit is less than 1.5 miles away, firing a missile has little effect. Rarely will a missile hit at this range, although the launch of a missile may frighten your opponent into making a reckless move. Your best bet is to switch to your 20mm cannon. Use short, controlled bursts of gunfire while watching the gunsight \"funnel\" on your HUD. Maneuver so that the wing tips of your target touch both edges of any point within the funnel and open fire. If the target fills the gap between the lines at any point on the funnel, you should score a hit. Be warned, however, gunfire hits cause unpredictable damage it may take several hits to down the target, so use your ammunition sparingly. The Padlock view also works for defensive maneuvers. Using the above procedure, you can quickly locate bandits at your six o'clock position, and maneuver to force them in front of you. More importantly, perhaps, is the ability to padlock incoming missiles. Introduced in version 3.0d, the padlock view will lock onto any missiles headed your way. This is an excellent tool in evading missiles. To avoid an inbound missile, switch to padlock. Usually, padlock will immediately lock onto the nearest incoming missile, although sometimes you may have to press the \"t\" key to cycle through several targets before locating the missile. Look at the upper left hand window and identify the missile type. Knowing whether the missile is radar or infrared guided is extremely important. If the missile is radar guided, use whatever amount of throttle you need to maintain a corner velocity of 380 to 400 knots. If, however, the missile is a hear-seeker, you should reduce throttle and reduce your heat signature. Begin firing chaff or flares depending on the missile type. Since enemies may fire both missile types at you simultaneously, it is advisable to always fire chaff and Nares in unison. Now that you have the missile padlocked, turn in any direction you choose to gain a 90 degree flight path offset from the missile (i.c., your heading is 90 degrees different from that of the missile). That means, turn your F-16 until the red targeting box in the upper middle window is positioned halfway between the HUD symbol and either edge. Maintain enough turn to keep the red box in this position. Don't turn too tight or you will turn head-on into the missile. If you have an ECM pod, turn it on now, regardless of the type of the incoming missileâyour enemies launch a different missile with a different guidance type while you're preoccupied with the first. At this point, the missile should appear as a white dot in the lower window. As it approaches it will get larger and begin to look like a missile. At some point you will be able to see the exhaust plume behind the missile and, shortly thereafter, the missile will impact. To evade the missile, you must execute a perfecrly-timed, high-G break in the direction of your turn, just before the missile hits. Timing of the turn is both critical and extremely difficult to judge. Just as the missile changes from a small white dot to a recognizable shape, you want to execute your break turn. Pull the stick all the way back to the limit and dump chaff and flares like there's no tomorrow (if you don't succeed, there may not be). If you're successful, the missile will buzz harmlessly past you in the lower padlock window in dramatic fashion. If you fail, Berry will quickly notify you of such! Proper timing of the break turn is much more of an art than a science, but the above guidelines in conjunction with practice should provide satisfactory results against both surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles. Through the padlock view, your improved defensive ability in conjunction with your greater offensive skills will make your F-16 the most feared weapon in the simulated sky! Cow TARGET SAUER Becoming a Fighting Falcon 3.0 On-Line by Victor Â«Duke\" Zaveduk One of the most popular modem games being played in Compuserve's MTM-Lobby is Falcon 3.0 from Spectrum HoloByte. Falcon puts gamers in the cockpit of an F-16 fighter jet with some of the most realistic flight modeling this side of a multi-million dollar military simulator. Modem play takes ultimate advantage of the simulation by pitting one human player against another in a classic one-on-one dogfight, The game is so popular that an ongoing competition ladder has formed. Over 70 players have signed up since the competition began last October. This means that, at any given moment, nearly 50 active players are competing in a continuing struggle to determine the top \"Ace\" among CompuServe members. While there are a couple of active or ex-military pilots competing, most of the players are armchair fighter jocks. Put them behind the controls of Falcon 3.0 and their adrenaline starts pumping, and the experience becomes as exhilirating and exhausting as \"real\" aerial combat. The MTM-Lobby often resembles a fighter jock hangout with a large number of Falcon pilors looking for \"friendly\" matches to keep their competitive edge finely honed. Anyone interested in joining the competition ladder should contact Victor \"Duke\" Zaveduk at 76711,27 in the MODEMGAMES Forum or just drop by the MTMLobby for a little \"friendly\" competition. Just make sure to have that helmet strapped on and that parachute packed. CGW Page 104 Computer Gaming World "

":Strategy A For Want Of A Hint A Kingdom Was Lost is Strategy Tips For QQP's Conquered Kingdoms by Randall Black T Tith a rich armory full of pieces and a vast playing area, Conquered Kingdoms (CK) from QQP has the feel of chess on steroids. Only by careful placement and a mastery of the strengths and weaknesses of the 16 kinds of units can the player consistently beat CK s strong artificial intelligence (AI). Winning the objectives 15 squares away. Beware: a wizard-borne army can be quickly decimated if it rematerializes in the midst of enemy forces. Clusters Bomb! (Avoiding Diminishing Returns) \"The early battles, usually taking place among clustered forces, are the most treacherous. The Al excels at maximizing damage in a cluster fuss, and a review of the casualty report often reveals huge losses during these early battles among bunched forces. Preserving one's units can hinge on the ability to avoid large, uncontrolled battles. Remember the strategy made famous by brave Sir Robin and his fellow HolyGrailsmen: run awaaay! When forces are bunched up, a single fireball can ruin your whole day. Goad fully loaded wizards into fireballing early by baiting them with a couple of units before approaching with larger numbers. Although touted for their ability to kill kings, a pair of spies are another creat way to take out a 9x wizard. Dragons, too, punish clustered forces by hitting both units in a square. Spread our units to a square when these fearsome beasts are present.

The far flung scale of the playing surface rewards speedy acquisition of key objectives (castles, resources and cities, and transforms the first few turns into a foot race for the goods. The choice of starting cities is crucial to victory. However tempting it may be to occupy cities based on victory points alone, prudence demands starting at some low point cities for their strategic positions. Occupation of castles should be top priority, and the winning player sets up fast units such as cavalry to move in as soon as possible. Once occupied, castles are vastly more difficult to take. With even a single ore difficult to take. With even a single friendly unit inside its walls, a castle can be reinforced with cheap-butdeadly units like catapults and archers that can snipe with impunity from the protected keep. Manage to take all the castles, and the enemy can't reinforce, even with a mountain of gold. The only source of replacement units, resources, are as important as cities for ultimate victory. The proximity of these sinews of war gold, coal and wood -should exert a strong influence on the choice of starting cities before the initial mad dash begins. If possible, keep balanced supplies of wood and coal to maximize their purchasing power. Cities should be occupied as soon as possible, but usually require wellplanned garrisoning with strong forces to hold them over the long haul. An early sprint to a city by a single fast unit is often rewarded by a crushing attack, especially at the high value cities which act like magnets for enemy units. Units purchased during the initial set-up should reflect the need for speed. Except on maps with lots of obstacles (mountains, oceans and rivers), cavalry are ideal starting units and should account for up to half of the initial budget. Spies are a must, at least one in each starting city, not only for vital intelligence but also for high-speed travel to resources and uncontested cities. Wizards may seem like powerful fighters, but they are most valuable for their speed, teleporting themselves and adjacent units to Paying Scale (Dragons and Gargoyles) Dragons may seem expensive, but they constitute an extremely desirable offensive unit. For 20 gold pieces one gets a fast, all-terrain unit that can attack at a distance, often from the safety of mountains and seas. Notice how much the AI likes dragons. In clustered battles ar close quarters they can dish out up to 16 points of damage per round of combat. Once most of their impressive 32 points of damage are depleted, severely weakened dragons can move off to make excellent sentries for cities and resources. A badly crippled dragon can destroy wave after wave of small units blundering into range of its city, and dragons don't frighten easily. A poor man's dragon, the gargoyle, is good for crossing bad terrain to tap resources and attack out-of-the-way cities. Without ranged firing, however, gargoyles have to mix it up during combat and eventually get whittled away. At nearly half the price of a dragon, these escapees from Notre Dame are best left for spreading out over inaccessible terrain or attacking archers. A Wiz at Some Things (Overpriced Units) When starting in the lap of the enemy, a wizard or two can be a good Page 106 Computer Gaming World "


"anticipate. Knowing where enemy units will be next turn is often more important than where they are now. One should set up ranged units (archers, catapults and dragons) just within striking distance of squares where the enemy COME! units will be after they move. This allows for a double barrage; first, at the end of the Al's turn, and then again on the player's turn. By simply mixing it up with enemy units, one will only trade hit points. By taking advantage of action at a distance and picking the right fights, the player's units can exact a toll (or troll) without getting a scratch. F insurance policy but their best roles are those of long-range transports or keep sitters, not pitched battle fighters. Limit purchases of these exotic luxuries to the demands of specific missions. Certain units hardly seem worth buying, except in very special circumstances. Phantoms are valuable for \"scaring\" in clustered fights, but given their low speed, exorbitant cost of 15 gold pieces, and the fact that one should be avoiding those massed attacks anyway, they are of dubious value. At a cost of seven, land bound and remarkably vulnerable ogres aren't much of a bargain, even though they can attack at a range of one and inflict damage without making contact. Glorified lancers, trolls can heal (if they live), but they cost as much as three-and-a-half regular lancers. Instead of a troll, one should try buying a squad consisting of a swordsman, a lancer and an archer for the same price. Take along an officer and they can heal as well. Arch-enemies (The Archer Ploy) One of the most effective and satisfying ploys in CK is loading boats with archers. Cruising out of reach of many land units, and hard to kill even with the most powerful units, archers in boats are a terror to coastal cities and make an excellent counter to dragons. When things get hot, their high speed can get them away from trouble (spelled g-a-r-g-o-y-l-e-s). Perhaps, the most important key to success in CK is the ability to 1 Mixmaster (Strategic Overview) Much of CK's charm lies in the scissors/rock/paper interaction of the units. Even the lowly Rog can be incredibly deadly when a weakened Al begins to spit out droves of cheap lancers. Yet, a single lancer on a bridge can stop a massive cavalry charge. A knight can walk right into a cascle held only by archers. Every unit has an Achilles Heel that can be exploited. Becoming too reliant on a few favorites can give the AI an opening.

It appears to take direct attack and target orders to get the squad to accomplish anything at all. Generally, the missions are a combination of retrieval and combat, with completion requiring the elimination of one or two specific entities, and perhaps the retrieval of a data disk. At times, doors will be locked, and a card key is necessary, which generally means finding another entity, killing it, and searching the body. Combat, as I mentioned earlier, is best handled by a direct order. When an entity appears to be hostile, order every squad member in the area to specifically atrack the enemy. Grenades seem to work the best, and they appear to be the only weapon which makes the foes stagger back from the hit. This, at least psychologically, is far more satisfying ore satisfying than the less efficient weapons. Since mercs are a precious and unmodifiable commodity, a tactic to generally ensure success in a mission is to save the game immediately when the mercs are deployed. Then, scroll around the map and figure out what points need to be hit, accessed or interacted with. Bring up the file screen and reload the mission, this time armed with concrete information. When the mission is complete, the player is paid in credits, with fees deducted for needless casualties (an odd stipulation since it's hard to tell a needless casualty during the run) and squad members killed. General Tegel will immediately issue orders for another mission, and recruiting may begin again. Since there is only a stock stable of mercenaries, it is very possible for the game to end due to a lack of warm bodies for hire. One problem with the credit system is that mercenaries aren't all that expensive to hire and there is no provision for purchasing new weapons. The only way to get new weaponry is to find it or pull it from a warm corpse. Having the option to re-equip the mercs would make the logistical aspect of the game much more appealing The overarching mission of the game is to find and kill the Kkistik queen who controls a race of aggressive insectoid creatures.

"Deuneu :HALH  strength and the actions of the entities. The mission builder is a very helpful tool which enables the player to learn the logic behind Tegel's missions, and it is a good idea, once the player has some familiarity with the game, to go in and build a mission. When returning to Tegel's scenarios, the player is armed with a wealth of information which makes the whole system a lot clearer. Building the missions is a trial and error affair, since the interface is as clunky and as inconsistent as it is in the game. At one point a menu will pop up which warrants a mouse selection, at another time, the player HITUNES HAS DIED!!! cycles through choices with the left mouse button, and in yet another instance, the player must type in the requested information from the keyboard. To make things even more inconsistent, these parsers seem to pop up everywhere: at the top of the screen, on another menu screen, or in an almost invisible message box. The manual provides a slight and abbreviated tutorial, but nowhere does the manual even mention how to use the custom rools. It took me several attempts before I found the Â«Custom Game\" menu selection when starting the game to be able to access my scenarios. The graphics are probably the strongest point of Tegel's Mercenaries. The artists chose a cartoonish look which seems to work very well. There is very little dithering, and the colors are all vibrant, making the screens stand out exceptionally well. When in the scenario mode, the entire screen is filled with the overhead view, and menus are accessed by clicking on a squad member or one of two unobtrusive buttons. Clicking on the red button brings up the file save and exit menu, while the green button brings up a somewhat muddled, but helpful, overhead map of the entire scenario. Sound is generally well handled, with a refreshing sparseness to the musical scores. Digital sounds are provided, but the version I reviewed was missing one of the needed drivers. The only problem with the game sounds is that they don't really help the player assess the mission any better. Sometimes a weapon makes a sound, other times not, and the threats seem to be uncomfortably quiet, making the player pay extra attention to all of his squad members to find the little blue puffs of combat smoke. All in all, Tegel's Mercenaries is a pretty game with a handful of good ideas. The problem is, not many of those ideas are very well executed. Control is clunky, inconsistent, and downright frustrating at times. The logistics aspect is downplayed to a fault, and the successful completion of the scenarios is accomplished more through rote than through any intuitive and creative decision making. Hopefully, future editions will clean up the game and add the depth needed to keep a player's attention. Until then, the twenty-second century is a hit or miss proposition. CGW NEW!

"Deview Combat Air Patrol (CAP) options to cover each other's \"six.\" This is a dangerous situation and one which led me into severe trouble on many occasions. This trouble leads to the subject of air threats. I found the opposition too severe especially for the supposed quality of the enemy I was facing. This situation was made more aggravating by the limited information received by the attendant AWACS (who offer air threat bearing, but not range), plus the poor performance of the AIM-OM Sidewinders which had a lower than expected performance. Dont Rain on my Campaign (Campaign Construction) If the player does not wish to follow the game's campaign he can design one of his own. Using the campaign manager, TAWADS, one can allocate waypoints for Harriers (attack and reconnaissance), helicopters (attacks, reconnaissance and troop insertion) and troops (via landing craft). The fleet, itself, can be allocated waypoints along the coast of the island. However, even though TAWADS utilizes mouse commands and a menu tree, the system is long-winded and tiring to use. The command system cries out for global commands to speed up campaign orders and tactical decisions. The frequent slow screen updates that blank the screen also help to irritate, especially during the heat of the action. Eccentricities also occur when using TAWADS. For example, in the Wargame view, Harriers become invincible apart from the odd loss over a target (presumably from SAM attack). Also, helicopters are similarly impregnable. I never lost one chopper during the whole campaign. The Harrier situation is a temptation to cheat, however. If one's Harrier is under attack from an enemy aircraft during the simulation mode, merely switching to wargame/campaign mode defuses the threat. Domark has admitted that the game switches to a simplificd wargame set of rules. This one point is typical of the generally poor Al routines in the game. Another difficulty presented via TAWADS is the lack of air threat representation on the map; the only air threat seen is the infrequent supply C-130. One final criticism is the no-win situation. Winning the game is, apparently, triggered upon achieving 70% occupation of the island. I managed to occupy 89% of the island without seeing a \"win screen.\" This is a bug, it appears. On the positive side, though, the real-time action seen on the TAWADS map is made more atmospheric when one realizes that all of the movements are actually happening in 3D. It brings the normally staid 2D map to life. In addition, the map can be zoomed almost indefinitely and the presentation is commendable via the hires screen. Amiga owners have their own problems, I'm afraid. This version does not include night missions. Domark alleges that the lack of RAM in most Amigas is to blame. However, when one considers that night missions merely warrant a simple palette change and that Domark recommends a 68020 Amiga to play the game and most 68020 Amiga owners have 2 MB+ of RAM), this seems unlikely.

"pame nesigm It's A Small, Small, Real-Time World Crossing Computer Gaming with Miniatures Design Notes from Impressions' Ed Grabowski czasu WODOVINS los dos azt az egese on the fall of 1989, I first decided to create a computer system whereby I could fight some of the great heroic battles of yesteryear. I had spent a large part of my youth in painting, literally, thousands of miniature soldiers and attaching them to cardboard bases for ease of movement and for reconstruction of the battlefield whenever my sister wreaked mass destruction equivalent to an act of God). In spite of the obvious gratification carned from this pursuit, I always felt thar the \"turn-based\" rules could never recreare the incredible mental challenge of simultaneously commanded thousands of troops. Instead of taking the sensible approach and creating said computer program in my spare time, I decided to leave my career as a systems analyst, working in Management Information Systems which utilized large water-cooled IBM mainframes, and go for it! My original game was Rorke's Drift, and it has been followed by a series of games based upon new historical subjects and full of refinements. Conquest of Japan local Al and the orders set by the player.); carry out the move and decide on the animation pose required. Three frames of animation are used for each soldier's walk, but 24 total frames are required to reflect the eight different directions in which he can walk; detectif said soldier has collided with a fellow soldier and work out how they can move around each other to allow both soldiers' orders to be fulfilled; detect collision with the enemy; if firing, automatically seek out the most suitable target and attack it; resolve any missile firing; and finally, draw the soldier on the screen! Of course, the most difficult part of this algorithm is that it all has to be done in as short a cime as possible â ideally, five times per second. To further complicate matters, gamers need to be able to scroll around the battlefield while all this is happening, so the computer must also detect and keep track of mouse clicks and key presses. High Road or Low Road? The next decision I had to make was whether to use a \"high level\" language like C or a faster \"low level\" assembly language. I solved this by electing to use a mixture of the two. First, I would write the routine in C. Then, once I had it working, I would often rewrite it in assembler in order to speed it up. So, with a game that was both playable and working reasonably well on a 20 MHz MSDOS machine, I suddenly discovered what a difference a higher clock speed can make. The game played entirely too fast on a 33 MHz machine. The computer executed its battle plans so quickly that I was being outmaneuvered before I knew it. There I was, busy gerring my men in formation for an assault on the enemy's left, when the rascally computer had already attacked and routed most of my right with his cavalry. So, I would have to turn and try to rally my right while the computer nonchalantly charged my center. In short, I was being out-fought, not because I was being out-thought, but because everything was happening too quickly. I Aiming High So, what did I really want to accomplish. The basic aim was to recreate the same resplendent battle formations one could command on the table-top, but allow gamers to command these units in Â«real-time with artificial intelligence controlling each soldier. I didn't want to lose one bit of the visual splendor of the armies, and I desired to animate the troops as well. This meant that, while the battle is taking place, the machine would have to perform the following calculations for each soldier depicted on the screen: work out the AI for each soldier.

"Lame neshon Advertisers List COHORT 101 UPRESSIONS 75 FROM THE PRODUCERS OF RORKES DRIFT didn't have time to react. Therefore, I was forced to introduce an option which may increasingly appear with new generations of faster machines â a speed reduction option. With this toggle in place, the game player can ser how fast the men move on the screen. This, of course, provides time to see what's happening and respond appropriately. Looking Good When designing this system, I wanted to select a viewpoint which would give an impression (pun intended) of a three-dimensional battlefield. I rejected a straight overhead view because I wanted the player to see as much of the uniforms as possible. After all, miniatures players spend days researching and painting the clothing and armor of a given period. I decided that my design shouldn't offer any less. I chose, therefore, the isomerric 3-D view which is used in some arcade action games. Naturally, this solution had its attendant problems, the biggest being that once a piece moves behind a tree or building, it can become remporarily hidden. My solution was to give the player the option of viewing the conflict from the opposing player's viewpoint. To do so meant having to draw the scenery graphics from two viewpoints. I didn't have to worry about the soldiers, since all of their angles were already drawn, but I did have to do this for the scenery. The Loyal Opposition In the discussion to this point, I have neglected to speak of another major programming conundrum, the Al. Getting the computer to control an army is a never-ending task. The more we work on the Al, the more changes we come up with. Right now, I work on a general rather than specific approach.

Keeping in mind what overall strategy has already been factored into the process, the AI decides what the unit is most likely to do. Naturally, however, the whole affair boils down to whether the individual soldiers are going to follow orders or not. The AI performs the same calculations on an even smaller scale for each soldier depicred on the screen. If the evaluation shows the soldier to be too weak or his morale to be too low, he simply will not obey the commands from the higher levels. These general calculations are then supplemented by algorithms for fighting units with unique skills, such as artillery and cavalry. This keeps units from performing atypical attacks such as artillery units charging cavalry (The Charge of the Lugubrious Brigade?). 137 65 103 148 Historical Notes Hopefully, this article has given some insight into the way my miniatures wargaming system originated and evolved.

If I were only simulating a particular conflict, I could use pre-programmed attack/defense movements. So, I rework the general Al for the period (tactics, weapons and unit types) and geography (basic terrain advantages and disadvantages) in which the game takes place. My routines work by looking at the army's composition, position and morale. Ir evaluates these points at three levels: Overall, Unit and Individual Soldier. First, it examines the overall strength of the army against the opposition, measured both numerically (number of men) and positionally (what type of terrain is held). If the Al algorithms controlling the player's units perceive that he has numerical superiority and terrain advantage, it shifts to attack mode.

Regardless of which mode is chosen, the four opportunity to give a custom name to their unit. After choosing one grunts that the player controls seem to possess an incredible amount of four difficulty sercings, the player is presented with a file cabinet holding all 16 missions included in SForces. These 16 missions are of stamina. Even at the most difficult play settings, these soldiers seem divided into four geographical regions: arctic, tropical, temperate and to absorb an unearthly amount of damage, taking several rounds of fire desert. The missions in each zone pit the player against unnamed from a machine-gun pillbox at close range.

Missions can be chosen at random or gamers looking for a more accurate representation of damage received played in order, allowing gamers to enjoy a quick game or to invest during combat will be disappointed.

"Cview while changing weapons is as easy as selecting the appropriate character and using the \"+\" and \".\" keys to scroll through that character's available weaponry. Graphics, though nor excessively detailed, are crisp and bright and bright, making the flora and geographical features of the battlefield easily distinguishable. Sound is limited to firing weapons and exploding ordnance, although a fittingly somber military melody is played whenever a mission is completed. The 88-page instruction manual is somewhat of a disappointment coming from MicroProse, which has historically produced some of the most well-written game documentation in the industry. While I had hoped that the manual might devote a dozen or so pages profiling the elite military units of several countries, backed by a brief history of the accomplishments of special forces used throughout history, it did neither. Purple Hearts And Promotions Once the objective for the current scenario is accomplished (retrieving a valuable object, assassinating the enemy leader, et al), the player the player must shepherd units back to \"pickup zones.\" Once the team arrives at one of the designated retrieval points, a helicopter can be called in to pluck the players from the warzone. Even here, SForces leans more towards the arcade end of the computer gaming spectrum. Even if the pickup zone is surrounded by dozens of enemy soldiers, gun emplacements and other enemy units, the player's chopper happily zooms into almost certain death, slowly picks up the team, and vanishes from the combat scene without even a single shot being fired in its direction. If any soldiers end up being captured by the enemy, the player has the opportunity to fly back into the warzone and retrieve the missing soldiers. If any soldiers are killed in action, that soldier is permanently removed from the cight-man roster. After playing through the majority of the scenarios at a respectable level of difficulty, this loss of soldiers can be crippling. Once lost, a soldier is not replaced; players may find themselves braving the last scenario or two with less than a complete lere squad of four soldiers. Once the mission has been accomplished, each ch of the soldiers that participated in the mission are given the opportunity to be promoted or decorated. This process is entirely in the hands of the player, allowing gamers to reward favorite soldiers with a greater allotment of rewards. Once the 16 included scenarios are completed, the game ends and the player's squad is retired from active duty. Players can attempt those same scenarios at a higher difficulty level with a new squad, although the scenarios themselves will remain largely unchanged. One can only hope that MicroProse will release additional mission diskertes (or a scenario builder) to give the game playing appeal after the included scenarios are accomplished. The playing interface is the strongest feature of SForces. Although mouse support is nor included in the actual combat portion of the game, moving soldiers about by way of joystick or keyboard is clean and straightforward. Switching between soldiers can be done quickly, Mission Incomplete I had hoped that MicroProse U.K. would have heaped the same amou amount of lavish detail upon SForces that other U.K. designed MicroProse products hi Prose products have exhibited (with B-17 Flying Fortress being a prime example). Unfortunately, SForces ends up being a rather unexciting and easily forgettable entertainment product. With the game playing emphasis resting more upon arcade action than shrewd tactical maneuvering, SForces appears to be aimed squarely at male computer gamers in their early teens. Yet, even if SForces was classified as a true \"shoot em' up,\" it fails miserably to compete with more focused arcade offerings. In summation, SForces is a product which unsuccessfully attempts to straddle the barbed wire between arcade action and derailed, realistic infantry combat. Gamers looking for a vague, oversimplified introductory simulation of small-scale infantry operations might see something to admire in this game. Unfortunately, more serious minded gamers looking for a detailed, factually correct simulation of squad-level infantry actions should count SForces as missing in action.

Each airfield only holds one type of allied aircraft, either can be changed by applying different tactics (as the German side) or Spitfire or Hurricane. just failing to cope with German onslaught (as the British side). From the H.Q. to the Cockpit After running through the introductory demo that features digitized During flight, the player can control up to four aircraft per British squadron (or eight for the Germans). At any time, as in Flight of the Intruder (another Rowan Software production), the RAF player can transfer to the cockpit of any allied aircraft. Similarly, as in Flight of the Intruder, wingmen are available. They will watch each other's six\" bur, unfortunately, no orders can be given to one's fellow pilots. The player's wingman will follow his actions while the other aircraft will take events as they come. Radio messages in textual form (and digitized via a sound card) from the radar stations and other aircraft will appear on the top of the screen as the intercept progresses. For the Germans one can fly Me 109s, Me 110s and Stukas (plus the rear gunner). It is a shame that the heavier bombers (i.e.: Helli, Do17, Ju88) cannot be piloted. One can only be a tail or forward gunner. Rowan has been quoted as stating that flying the heavy bomber is an unexciting job; that they merely flew to the target, dropped their bombs and flew back again. Try telling the actual Helll pilots that their mission was never exciting! The decision not to allow the player to fly the heavy MODO Page 124 Computer Gaming World "

"piew STRASLLS TO SOUL TOUT 268 CG bombers is a poor one. It should have been up to Rowan to provide that excitement and leave it to the players to decide. Readers may be pleased to know that Rowan has implemented a workable rudder into the program, controlled by either the keyboard or separate pedals (even two joysticks are supported). However, Rowan failed to include auto-centering for keyboard users. Manual centering is a trial and is completely unnecessary. Cockpits for the British side are generic. On the German side there are three different gunner positions and a one-off cockpit for the Stuka. A generic cockpit is given to both the Me109 and Mel10. Esprit de Flying Corps Unfortunately, there are no medals awarded only points. A player flying for the British, if he does well on a particular mission, receives a visit from the King. Why the King would spare time to visit a pilot just because he had a good day and not toss him a DFC (Distinguished Flying Cross) through the post instead, is beyond me. I firmly believe that the awarding of medals and promotions is more satisfying. Postmission reports could have been better structured, too. As it is, they are rather woolly and, possibly, confusing to some players. It is good to see that morale plays a big part in the campaign. It is based, or scored, upon averave morale of the whole airfield rather than upon individual pilots. Although, if a pilot arrives from an airfield of low morale to an airfield of high morals, the average morale of that airfield will be reduced. If an airfield is garnering a lot of kills, morale will go up improving their overall skill. If they are losing pilots regularly, morale will fall. There is a slight morale loss for damaged aircraft too. Left to recuperate, airfields with low morale will improve in morale, but only very slowly Where do Airplanes Come From? There are four aircraft factories producing one aircraft each, every four days. From these, airfields can be re-stocked. Aircraft also can be repaired at home bases. However, if an airfield is damaged, aircraft repair is slowed. If factories are damaged, they will stop producing aircraft until fully repaired. If the British force drops down below 50% then Britain is proclaimed lost. What's in the Sights Two welcome cosmeric features are gouraud shading and light sourcing, highlighted by the addition of a 256-color VGA palette. Imagine observing a 3-D rendition of a Spitfire from the external viewpoint. Then, roll the aircraft. The effect of lightsourcing means that, as the wing's upper surfaces roll over to face the ground, the color of the upper wings progressively darken. Well, they turn away from the sun don't they? Conversely, lower surfaces lighten. It is an extremely nice effect to see. Sound can be driven by both Roland LAPC-1 and SoundBlaster simultaneously (via a mixer of some sort) providing satisfactory noises, but never anything special. The basic flight model for Reach for the Skies is a generic form that obeys the fundamental laws of aeronautics. Rolls and loops are well implemented, as are stalls. Progressively tipping a wing on a lazy roll will result in a loss of height and a possible stall which is easily recovered from. Height is realistically lost while flying straight and level with the throttle pulled to minimum. Checking the Specs There are supposed to be overlaid patches that specify the characMWYROZATGE E LES AG S NEG teristics of each individual aircraft. However, I couldn't find any. For example, even though the Spitfire Mark 1 carried eight guns, only two are simulated; its historical straight-and-level speed of 360 MPH can never be reached (speed tops out at 300 MPH); and high speed diving enforces no problem on the Spitfire where, in reality, it almost locked the ailerons, allowing only a little movement in the rolling axis, if any. Further, negative G or bunting never initiates the Merlin Ill engine modeled in the game to cut out as it did in real life (a significant feature and one of the very real disadvantages compared to the Me109 which never suffered from this complaint â resulting in challenging dogfights for RAF pilots). Flighrs can be recorded using a range of different orders, angles and so on, with the game's VCR utility. Recordings are portable and recorded files can be extremely long since the game uses expanded memory to store the information. However, options are limited and will never scale the heights observed in Red Baron, for example. One odd but handy utility is a DOS file that tidies extraneous files on the hard disk, depending upon what one wishes to dispose of. This is, indeed, a thoughtful gesture. A Real \"No Brainer\" Until this point in the review, one might weigh the pros and cons and decide thar Reach for the Skies is a pretty good simulation. Alas, I have yet to speak of the game's artificial intelligence. Actually, it has have yet to spe none to speak of -or very little, at best. For all of its technical and cosmetic excellence, RFTS is too easy. The enemy is no where near aggressive enough. While playing the RAF, I was never aware that I was under the cosh, while playing the RAI, I was never av a struggling nation keeping the mighty Luftwaffe at bay. Playing the RAF in RFTS is like shooting ducks at a penny arcade. Bombers can be easily brought down from any angle one wishes to fire from. The German escorts are poor and almost Gandhi-like in their aggressiveness. Another thing: German bombers hardly ever hit their targets. After dozens of missions flown in all phases of the campaign, flying as the RAF, I experienced one targer hir â one! I often repelled entire waves of German bombers plus their escorts with a single Spitfire. Playing the Germans is not much better. Again, another duck-shoot. Spitfires sit on a bomber's six, just waiting to be shot down (they always are, too). Fellow German bomber pilots/bombardiers are, again, very poor and hardly ever hit their targets, making the player very frustrated and itching to get into the cockpit which, of course, they can't. Thus, for this extremely important reason, Reach for the Skies cannot be recommended as a viable flight simulation. This is a shame because the game has a lot going for it. It is far more simulation-oriented than Lucasfilm's Their Finest Hour. However, it hardly contains a single percent of that game's challenge and gameplay. CGW Page 126 Computer Gaming World "

At Dinky's House, kids will try to find which shade-drawn window Dinky is hiding behind. Kids can also go inside the house and click on the various rooms to see what Dinky does in his daily life. (See screen shot.) There is a primitive paint program that allows kids to draw silly accessories on provided faces. Other games include the typical Concentration adaptation, a monster counting exercise, and a cute diversion that introduces kids to the alphabet.

Well, for those who might find it appealing, there is Jigsaw Puzzle from In Time which offers 15 VGA puzzles and Â«six hundred game variations\" (which they arrive at by generating all possible permutations of puzzles and the 40 different ways that they can be cut). Players can either take their time and relax while solving a puzzle, or they can race against the clock. In Expert and Master modes, if one doesn't place pieces fast enough, the computer will start removing the correctly positioned pieces and place them back in the unplaced pile (the compurerized equivalent of a young child or the household car).

Now gamers can experience the nail-biting drama of directing dozens of aircraft under dangerous conditions. Air Traffic Controller is a revised version of Wesson International's acclaimed simulation, Tracon. The new version allows gamers to direct pilots in six heavily trafficked metropolitan airports, the player-controller vectoring departing and arriving traffic under normal and emergency conditions. The revision adds new weather and pilot models, and spoken word communications from the pilots and controllers with most major sound cards. Ardent enthusiasts can even hook up by modem or null link with four friends flying aircraft in Microsoft's Flight Simulator, who can then be ordered around by the master controller. IBM (runs under DOS and Windows), Mac ($59.95). Circle Reader Service #13. F-3.01 Keyboard Template WHITE Treni F-3.01 KEYBOARD TEMPLATE: The situation is probably familiar to most flight sim jocks: while madly searching for that vital key on the keyboard, one's tail gets peppered by machine gun fire from a Mig. During that slow parachute ride to the ground, one has just enough time to go back to the manual and find the key that could have saved the mission. An equally frequent problem with complex sims is the re-learning curve necessary when jumping between, say, Falcon 3.0 and F-15 Strike Eagle II. Keyboard Commander's series of keyboard templates are designed to reduce this confusion and increase one's gaming pleasure. The remplates are printed on card-stock and fit nicely over most keyboards, and have color-coded icons for quick access (i.e. flight controls in blue, navigation commands in peach). Templates are available for most complex sims including, but not limited to Falcon, Aces of the Pacific, S.W.O.T.L, Chuck Yeager, A-10, and Megafortress. IBM Enhanced Keyboard ($11.95).

Rescue Air 911 takes pilots through eight rescue scenarios varying from fires to auto wrecks on the interstate. Two other adventures are currently available as well.

Despite their poor sense of timing, Ocean has put together a decent collection of Olympic contests. With over 30 events, Espana offers the most variety we've seen in this sort of game, including rarities like the steeplechase (both the 800m and 1500m varieties), judo, wrestling, boxing, and several less popular swimming styles. Like Psygnosis' Carl Lewis program, Espana allows the player to train athletes before the events, designing training programs that will maximize their stamina and skill without causing burn-out. Beyond all this, Espana is the same joystick breaking, keyboard pounding diversion that blistered our hands on the Atari 2600 and will continue to blister our hands in 1996, 2000, 2004, ...

A company puts a new sort of product on the market with limited expectations of success, and then finds, to their surprise, that the product is a major hit. Then they try to recreate the phenomena with successor products that employ the new idea in another way. Without exception, the successors don't enjoy the same sort of success. Witness SimCity, and now Lemmings. Creepers, like Psygnosis' recent Bill's Tomato, is undeniably a Lemmings \"metoo.\" It has cute but stupid creatures (in this case, inchworms) that require the guiding hand of the gamer through multiple levels of puzzles. It has a menu bar at the bottom of the screen that provides access to a number of tools necessary for the task in this case, the tools are fans, ramps, girders, and fly swatters). It even borrows the cute \"paws\" command from Lemmings. Unfortunately, the inchworms aren't half as endearing as the lemmings, the puzzle screens are cluttered and confused, and the game is simply lesser in many ways. Puzzle gamers may want to wait for the eventual return of our original furry friends in Lemmings 2. IBM ($49.99). Circle Reader Service #18.

It is a typical graphic adventure which flirts with mediocrity. It's a point-and-click adventure with a five-icon command system, and it has more than its share of typical graphic adventure problems (we haven't seen so many \"Why-would-you-want-tolook-at-thatsÂ» and Â«You-can-do-that-heres\" in quite a while). It has a colorful serting and a decent story, but fans of recent Sierra and LucasArts adventures will probably feel as if they've taken a flight back to graphic adventure neverever-again-land. Amiga, IBM ($49.95). Circle Reader Service #17. PUSH-OVER: Once beyond the contrived fictional set-up, one finds PushOver to be a rather nice puzzle game with a lovable protagonist, G.I. Ant. With an acknowledging nod to Psygnosis' Lemmings, Push-Over is composed of multiple levels of puzzles set in nine different graphical serrings. On each level is a configuration of dominoes which must be toppled over by G.I. Ant. G.I. only has one Â«pushÂ» in him per level, so the dominoes must be arranged such thar they all fall in one continuous reaction. To ensure a complete domino effect, G.I. must lug dominoes around the screen and place them in the proper sequence. To make things especially interesting, there are eight special domino types with special Energy 4600 Creepers SPACE QUESTS THE NEXT MUTATION SCORES SPACE QUEST V-THE NEXT MUTATION: The Space Quest series is nothing but garbage, and will always be nothing but garbage â at least as long as Roger Wilco, janitorial prodigy, is involved.

Mounted proudly upon his reeking steed, Roger rides out to save the universe from your everyday nefarious race of mutants. In the process he will: die many horrible deaths; encounter a grab-bag of very silly though deadly aliens (a baby-faced hugger with unusually acidic, uh, liquid waste product); and meet the woman from the holodeck in Space Quest IV.

Damon is the designer/programmer who has been pushing the edge of 3-Space since his first vectored graphics game of space-age tank combat, the original Stellar 7 on the 8-bit computers. At Dynamix, Damon moved the company through the Skyfox and Airfox series of 3-D action games (published by EA) and on toward their current success with A-10 Tank Killer, Red Baron and Aces of the Pacific. Red Baron not only features terrific graphics that dress up the traditional polygon-filled look with occasional bit-maps and shading, but offers campaign play from both sides, the largest selection of aircraft in a WWI air combat simulation, and a multitude of quick-combat missions. It is a rich, satisfying simulation that not only held a prominent position in the top ten of CGW's Top 100 for more than a year, but still stands as the high watermark of realistic air combat for many gamers.

The world of Underworld Il is more varied and engaging than ever before. We've added new terrain features (like shifting floors, water currents and thin ice), new spells (like Shockwave and Portal), new and nastier traps and puzzles, and new creatures (we'll let you discover these for yourself...) Underworld Il takes you beyond the traditional dungeon environment. Deep in the earth, the Guardian's magic has cracked the walls of reality, opening the way to eight new worlds beyond Britannia: a city buried in ice, a floating castle, an ancient tomb and more... From the halls of Lord British's castle, it's time to carry the battle forward and into the LABYRINTH OF WORLD... You see a black potion Vou see a potion Actual screens may vary.
