No Reviews Before Their Time Our commitment to Quality Computer Gaming World makes the following pledge to its readers: 1) We will only review from the final copy of the game. Though it has become popular among certain magazines to review from late beta copies, we feel that the reader is best served by having the reviewer look at the same copy of a game that the readers will find on the shelves. While we recognize that this builds in some delay in terms of coverage, we believe the reader is better served by such caution. 2) We expect our reviewers to finish the game. We want our readers to be assured that we do not review based on immediate or early impressions of a game. Our reviewers give a game ample opportunity to show its quality. In some cases, bugs make it impossible to finish a game, but we try to identify situations where that has occurred. 3) We make every effort to match the reviewer to the game. We take into consideration the preferences, background and possible biases of the reviewer and, where possible, we find people with actual life experience or intense special subject backgrounds to review games (.e. pilots and drivers for sims, political columnists for geopolitical/economic games, military veterans or aficionados for wargames, etc.). We believe this policy enhances both the credibility of the review itself and the enjoyment of gameplay when the real world and the game world are competently compared 4) We will not accept free travel from software publishers or hardware manufacturers. We believe such gifts have a tacit assumption of coverage attached to them. We will only cover such events/launches as we believe will benefit our readers.

"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Second, it's the game, stupid! The bottom line must be to make games that offer enough challenge, surprise, story and variety that gamers want to return to your game world. Too much of current game design is being spent on what we can do technologically and how to package the game (the box on the shelf and the on-screen presentation) rather than what the gamer wants. This is a dead-end street. Finally, gamers can help the process by avoiding bad games. Check out reviews, interactive demos, on-line comments and anything else that can give you information before you buy. Your purchase is a vote of confidence for a product, so don't settlebuy intelligently! Also, use the feedback mechanisms of registration cards, on-line support bulletin boards and web pages to let the publishers know how you feel and the kinds of games you really want. Without some effort on behalf of both publishers and purchasers, my prophecy of a crash where everybody gets hurt seems inevitable. With some effort and communication, we may end up in a new, perhaps even golden, era of gaming. TRUTH IN ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT For those of you newsstand buyers who are alert enough to realize that this issue does not have an actual 400 pages (as advertised), we apologize. The polybag is printed far in advance of the actual issue and the mistake was precipitated by a Pythonesque miscommunication between myself and another member of the staff. I won't bore you with details, except to suggest that 215 sounds a lot like 250. My optimistic nature misheard the higher number and I sent a higher total number to the printer of the polybag as a result. I assure you that it was not my intent to mislead anyone and I promise it won't happen again.

The graphics, sound, interface, and, of course, the game play come together to form a Transcendent Gaming Experience. Very Good: A quality game that succeeds in many areas. May have minor problems, but is still worth your time and money, especially if you're interested in the subject matter/genre. Average: A mixed bag. Can often be a game that reaches for the stars, but falls short in significant areas. Can also just be a game that does what it does well, but lacks flair or originality.

Quick Combat features 12 missions at three difficulty levels de signed to get you right into the heat of the action. For the competitive soul, this mode keeps high scores, giving you points for each kill. Simulator mode offers the richest missions. Even on missions where you're just learning an attack method, your EF2000 is generally part of a larger operation. You might, for instance, take out an enemy SAM site while F-15s providing cover engage in combat above; after you take out the SAMs and head toward the refueller, you can flip the view back and watch a group of A-10s move in for an attack on the SAM-free site. Campaign mode is where you'll probably spend most of your time. Instead of providing a canned series of missions like USNF, EF2000 uses an engine called WARGEN to algorithmically compute combat results for the entire war theatre-according to the manual, over 4,000,000 square kilometers holding over 1,000 planes, 2,000 ground units, and 500 ships (although I've never been given an Anti-Ship mission except in Simulator mode). You're presented with a list of possible EF2000 missions for the current time period—anywhere from four to a couple of dozen, depending on the war situation. Sometimes you can choose any part of a multi-phase mission, choosing between flying escort, Wild Weasel, or ground strike. If you take out a location in one mission, you'll see the damage next time you fly over. You'll also encounter other aircraft on completely unrelated missions. The campaign is the most ambitious I've ever seenwhen you're in close proximity to other missions, they're handled by the simulation engine and you can watch ground and air attacks taking place (and interfere at will). At a distance, the wargame engine takes care of things.

Campaign status is saved when you exit the program, but you can only play one campaign at a time. and the minimal ground-fire compared to what you'll encounter in Simulation mode gives the impression that the folks at DID didn't have time to implement campaigns as thoroughly as they would have liked Also, victory is terribly underwhelming—a small box that says \"War is Won.\" (And presumably, \"War ment. The astonishing graphics, the best virtual cockpit around, and a target-rich environment more than make up for a perhaps overly ambitious campaign module. You'll need powerful hardware: a 486-66 is probably the minimum for getting a playable frame rate in low-res, and you'll definitely want a fast Pentium for SVGA mode. (I found it playably smooth at full detail on Pentium-100). Like the real plane, EF2000 is a splendid example of the future that better technology has in store for us. And a bright future it is. WALI MINOR TURBULENCE The oddities in the campaign engine aren't the only problems. There are rare graphic glitches: at one point, I encountered smoking damage floating about 1,500 feet over neutral territory; at another, bomb damage outside my plane at mission startup obscured part of my instrument panel until my plane moved. I also encountered a situation where I could retarget the TIALD laser, which was alleviated when I exited and reloaded the program. You can't recalibrate your joystick from within the sim; you must use the external Config program. I had some lock-ups on one of two systems running QEMM that were cured by using a boot disk; Win 95 users will have to boot in DOS mode. THE EDITORS SPEAK EF2000 RATING RATINGE K PROS Revolutionary graphics and sound, excellent flight modeling, and an amazingly rich combat arena; the most ergonomic cockpit yet seen in a simulation. CONS Innovative Campaign mode doesn't seem fully implemented, as there's a lack of ground fire and naval activity. Only this and a few minor bugs keep this game away from the coveted five-star rating.

Creator Jane Jensen might want to start dusting off her awards shelf again, as The Beast Within mixes a strange, new brew of mutilation murders, a centuries-old curse, and criminal misdeeds on multiple CDs. Gabriel Knight, a detective of the supernatural, is summoned to Munich to investigate a series of murders blamed on werewolves. The edge-of-your-seat tale unfolds to implicate the mad King Ludwig II, a lost Wagner opera, and Gabriel's own dark past. Shrewd thinking and paying attention to details are rewarded as players unravel clues while taking on the role of Gabriel and his partner, Grace Nakimura. Shot on location in Germany and the U.S. with more than 40 surprisingly talented actors, The Beast Within is possibly the most visually stunning, realistic adventure game to come out on CD this year.

Those guys on cable TV, sitting in a boat, reeling in a big one, saying stuff to each other like, \"Oh, he's got a lot of fight in him there, Jim.\" NROPH At last count, there were 50 million people in this country like Jim who love to feel the tug on a rod. And now they've got their own computer game: Trophy Bass. There are three sides to Trophy Bass. You can choose tackle, pick your bait, read the water, set the weather conditions, and then finesse your casting technique on one of five virtual lakes. Option two is to play in Tournament Mode and try your luck against conditions and competitors dished out by the computer. Or you can get even more serious and watch the full motion video \"how-to\" section and pick up more than 100 nuggets of solid advice from America's top tournament bass fishermen. Now, obviously, the Jims of the world are going to love this game, because playing can bring you more success out on the water. But, surprisingly, you don't have to know what a lunker bucketmouth is to get a charge out of Trophy Bass. As Jim would say, \"It's a keeper.\" A city simulation? Hmmm, haven't I seen something like this before? Yes and no. Yes, you've seen amazingly-detailed 3D renderings before. And, yes, you've played sims that put you in the KRODASTLE municipal driver's seat. But, no, you've never played anything quite like Caesar II. For starters, if you do a good job quelling riots, dowsing fires, recruiting soldiers and building great cities, you earn approval ratings that grant you the right to take on another province. Then it really heats up. Along with wearing your city planner hat, you get to don the general's helmet and fight off hordes of barbarians in battle sequences (check out the Carthaginians on armored elephants). With each additional province you control, the closer you get to the best hat of all: the emperor's snappy laurel wreath. By combining great graphics, intricate strategizing and battle action, Caesar II isn't merely simulation. It's stimulation for those who hanker for action and power. File OptionsSpeed 18 AD.

But, no. They put the pads back on, threw out the old playbook, and came back with Football Pro '96. It keeps all the things that earned its forefathers the Best Sports Simulation award three years running: Slavish attention to real NFL player and team stats, a play book with over 10,000 combinations of X's and O's, and league play over CompuServe. Ah, but that's the old stuff. For 1996, you can suit up as a player for an arcade game or appoint yourself coach for the football sim. What's more, 3D animations were created using films of actual players shot from dozens of angles simultaneously, so tailbacks juke, wide receivers sprint, and linemen grunt just like their reallife counterparts.

While you don't need the voice command option to play the game, it adds yet another dimension to the realism.

While most other pinball games show you the table as if it were shot pointing straight up, Sierra's 3-D Ultra Pinball slants the table so you can see the whole thing easily without scrolling. This bit of clevemess was then TATTOMUS totally exploited with the most amazing spacescape graphics to appear this side of Alpha Centauri. Another innovation: 3-D Ultra Pinball uses advanced physics formulas to give you an uncannily accurate feel of a real table. Thanks to genius programming from some people who weren't sleeping during Physics class, flipper responsiveness, table bumping, ball rolling and ricochets look and react just like an authentic tavem machine. It even tilts like classic pinball. Damn! The game's three tables can be interconnected so you can keep going until the sun comes up. And action on all versions is super fast: an amazing feat especially for a Windows game. If there's one downside to this addictive game, it may be that the garbage isn't going to get taken out for a while, and the dog may have to start walking himself. Now that th TMEXDER Windows 95 frenzy i going full tilt, you ma wonder, \"is ther a game specificall designed for this amaz ingly cool new opera ing system that take full advantage of it multi-threading capa bilities?\" Or perhaps you'd like to know, \" there a game so incredibly wicked that it wil actually increase my supply of testosterone?\" The answer to both questions: Yes.

Actually, there are other enemies you can take on the bad dudes you play against on your network or your modem. All this battling is supercharged courtesy of Windows 95.

Start by parking yourself in its first-person, full-view, real-time combat simulator. The completely customizable cockpit, with continuous on-line help, locks on and destroys typical space fight games. The information overload as you plan an attack, while your radar and windshield fills with enemy ships, is truly stomach-churning. Then comes an even cooler part: You can grab a momentary breath during all this chaos by switching into strategy mode, where you can map out and execute your next attack from a mega-choice of battle strategies. Carrying the action game forward are spectacular interactive cinema clips, haunting original music, and enough mindracking tension to have you sweating an arsenal worth of bullets. While the action side of this equation beats most pure space arcade CDs at their own game, Last Dynasty shines again in the fully-rendered, high res scenes in the adventure portion of the game. This mind-puzzler takes place aboard a multi-level space station. From a first-person angle you explore, look for clues, remove a few ruthless strangers, and keep your nerve endings on alert-mode in wait for a surprise attack.

In this case, that something is The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain. This third installment in the immensely popular Dr. Brain series gives kids 10 different wildly entertaining puzzles to solve-each challenging the 10 learning centers in real live kid brains. Some involve mazes, others memory games, and there's plenty of fun with words and music. Since you can set the degree of difficulty, both ten-year olds and teens can have their brains put to the test. But here's the real truth. These puzzles are also a blast for those of us who, ahem, haven't doodled on a Pee Chee for many moons. (My favorite: sending the right colored balls down the railroad track maze to the station.) So don't get the idea this is some stuffy, bookish \"learning aid.\" The puzzles are pure fun, surprisingly funny, and always a challenge. If you've got kids, buying The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain is clearly a no brainer. The list of the awards MixedUp Mother Goose has won from magazines, parents' groups and the software industry could fill up the rest of this page. And no wonder. Here is a game that has introduced more than 500,000 little ones to the computer, while helping build their problem-solving and learning skills. Sounds like a textbook? It's not. In the new deluxe version of Mixed-Up Mother Goose kids search through Mother Goose Land to find missing objects from classic rhymes. A successful recovery is rewarded with a song-but not like you've ever heard before. Imagine \"Little Jack Horner\" done in reggae and you'll get the idea. The game can be played in English or Spanish, and there's a free bonus audio CD of the 18 songs in the game so kids can sing along after you've commandeered the computer so you can play your games.

"THE BRADBURY CHRONICLES by Shane Mooney An Exclusive Interview With SF Master Ray Bradbury On Media And Meaning, Interactive Entertainment, And His New Computer Game, The Martian Chronicles INTERVIEW here are those who write science fiction and there are those who are science fiction. Ever since Ray Bradbury sold his first short story in 1941, he has grown to become what many feel to be the greatest science fiction writer alive today. He's seen many of his books and short stories, such as Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes, turned into movies. He has even written screenplays based on other authors' books, such as Moby Dick. Yet, his most famous work is probably The Martian Chronicles, a collection of short stories chronicling man's attempts at conquering our red neighbor. With over nine million copies in print, this book has seen life not only on paper but also as a television movie, several stage productions and now, finally, as a CD-ROM adventure game (reviewed in this issue).

"The Clash Of Clans Battle-Tested Combat Strategies For MECHWARRIOR // by Paul C. Schuyte ma TRATE OMBAT IS, BY ITS VERY NATURE, A CONTEST OF WILLS. But combat is all the more potent, all the more human when it is also a contest of honor. We, as Clans, bear the ominous weight of tradition upon our shoulders. Even now, as we seek to test each other in the contest of war, our greatest warriors, of both Clan Jade Falcon and Clan Wolf, strive to uphold our honorable past. This war is costing us both dearly, and each passing day sees us relying more heavily upon the untested in our ranks. We may be asking them to honor the name of Kerensky too soon. This is our legacy-we cannot deny that—but we must give them all that we can, teach them all that we know of our honor and our vision so that combat will continue to reach beyond just rapid reactions and jump jets and into the hearts and minds of our warriors. It is for this end, honored Keshik, that we present to you this document. It offers the combat observations and suggestions pertaining to both Clan Jade Falcon and Clan Wolf. It is our hope that young warriors on both sides of the struggle can use this information to learn about their own challenges, as well as those of their combat brethren. And since we offer observations from both sides of this conflict, it is our hope that our young clan members can learn from us that it is not an immediate tactical advantage that is paramount, but something deeper. If war we must, then let us ensure that this war be honorable. Star Colonel Waller Kerensky CLAN WOLF MISSIONS be able to scrap the Mech in one shot without risking a scratch.

Fast mouse-clicking might work on Peasants, but against elite troops like Dragons, it would be best to heed these subtler strategies. 1. Hit Points Are Relative to Attack and Defense Scores Damage is always increased or decreased 10% per point of difference between the attacker's Attack value and the Defender's Defense score. So while that horde of Peasants (Att.1. Def.1) may look like a match for a Dragon (Att. 12, Def.12), in a real fight, a Dragon would do more than twice its listed damage to the peons, who in turn would barely scratch the beast 2. Heroes Make a Difference Heroes add their Attack and Defense ratings to those creatures under their control. meaning every creature under their command gets a significant strength boost. Always check the stats of opposing heroes-either with the identify Hero spell or when engaged in combat. A disadvantage of five points in either Attack or Defense means you have a serious handicap; a disadvantage of five or more points in both ratings means the enemy can inflict more than three times as much damage as your own troops. 3. Timing Is Everything Remember that fast creatures always move before the slower ones. Try to maneuver so that you strike the first blow in any exchange. During castle defenses, you can sometimes beat a far superior foe just by keeping your last flying unit out of his reach while the ballista chews him up. 4. Use the Right Creature for the Job Fast-flying units should initially be assigned to enemy missile troops to neutralize their ranged attacks. Slow defensive units, like Ogres, should be assigned guard duty for missile troops. Strong attack stacks such as Wolves and Rogues, are poorly suited to castle defenses, where they will languish behind stone walls. Keep critters with a two-space attack (Dragon, Cyclops, and Phoenix) far away from friendly troops, lest they fry an ally by mistake. 5. The Best Defense Is a Good Offense... Sometimes W hen fending off attacks on your towns and castles, it's sometimes better to initiate a battle against the invading army in open country, rather than huddling in your fortress. If you have few missile units and no destructive spells, but plenty of quick-moving attack, troops like Cavalry, a castle defense is suicidal, particularly if the foe has numerous ranged units available. 118 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Though the manual includes the basic stats for all the creatures, it only tells half the story. What the manual fails to tell you is that damage inflicted is increased or decreased 10% for every point of difference between the aggressor's Attack score and the victim's Defense rating. Here is a chart that takes that fact into account when rating each unit's worth. Modified Damage: The average damage caused in a single attack against a unit with a Defense rating of 5. Modified HP: The \"real\" number of hit points a creature has against an Attack value of 5. Cost Per Damage Point: An index of the troop type's attack efficiency as compared to cost, measured in the number of gold pieces spent for each point of damage in an attack. Lower scores are better, of course. Cost Per HP: A measure of the creature's defensive efficiency as compared to cost, counted by the number of gold pieces spent for each modified hit point. Lower values are better here as well. Total Attack Defense Per Week: Dragons are powerful, but you can recruit only a few every week, while Peasants and the like are more numerous.

Clausewitz: The Perfect General Carl von Clausewitz is perhaps the most army. In his later years, he was promoted to influential military theorist from the major general and served the War College in Western world. Born in Prussia in 1780, he had Berlin as director. a remarkable career in the military and went After his death in 1831, Clausewitz's theoon to write about his experiences and docries, notes, and experiences were published trines, which are still discussed by military_posthumously in a three-volume encyclopaedia students and leaders. titled On War. The work rivals Sun Tzu's Art of At 13, Clausewitz entered the service to War as the definitive doctrine of successful fight in the French Revolution. He also fought military strategies. In it, Clausewitz presents in the Napoleonic Wars before being captured his famous dictum: that \"war is a mere conand returned to Prussia in 1808. Soon aftertinuation of policy by other means.\" wards he became the chief military instructor Clausewitz also introduced the concept of for Prussia's crown prince. He entered into the \"total war,\" which posited that all assets of a war against Napoleon between 1812 and nation are subject to attack during wartime, 1814, fighting as an officer of the Russian including the war machine, civilians and property. Another of Clausewitz's tenets is that the likelihood of warfare is influenced by two factors: the equilibrium of forces and the intentions of the aggressor state. Both factors are interrelated, and imbalances in equilibrium, coupled with hostile intention, will lead to war, whereas an equilibrium of forces, despite hostile intent, will result in peace. Many of his points, so applicable to warfare in any time period, also hold true in wargaming.

JAGTERA ALLIANCE Phoros used to be a happy place, where all the hard work was done by large domesticated insects, collectively known as «jagtera.\" When Darkfall occurred ten years back, the jagtera suddenly disappeared, and the island went into a decline. Now, so the rumor goes, the jagtera are returning, and the population is celebrating-perhaps a little too soon. Your character, Squire Warrick, arrives on Phoros in search of his sister. It isn't long before he discovers the truth about the jagtera revival. The Phorovian nobles are giving special nectar to the inhabitants that morphs them into insects. Even worse, the nectar is tainted with evil: the jagtera created by it are all vicious and bloodthirsty. Those who do not become jagtera usually end up victims of their insatiable jaws. Naturally, no red-blooded hero could resist ing through some morphing himself, he becomes somewhat less than human in form and adds spitting to his repertoire, giving him a distance weapon.

For another thing, even veteran gamers can appreciate classic puzzles, if they are chosen well and executed with affection and skill.

"B IS FOR BRADBURY what order to play the 15 brief recordings. The really great Bradbury game, like the great Asimov, Clarke, or Heinlein game, remains to be made. I just hope that when someone gets his hands on The Illustrated Man, it's not Byron Preiss Multimedia. Someone who gave a damn about Bradbury-or about making good games-would not have let this one out the door. 3 RIS FOR ROCKET BY RAY BRADBURY (other than a brainteaser from the Jumbo Bag O' Yawns), it consists of turning on your all-purpose \"scanner.» This handy tool lets you see through walls, magnifies images, and translates alien inscriptions-but only when the designers allow. It isn't worthwhile to go on listing all the ways in which THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is deficient. Suflice it to say that this is a badly designed and poorly conceived game. What about the extras? Well, the readings from Bradbury's original text are nice; they remind you what the real Martian Chronicles has to offer. But the graphics that play in the background add nothing to the words-better to buy the book, or an audio version of it. The Bradbury interview, in which the author looks like Brando and talks like Yoda, may interest his old fans but isn't likely to win him any new ones. And it's only interactive in the same way that a record of a concert could be described as an interactive concert\"-you get to decide in THE EDITORS SPEAK THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES RATING  PROS The excerpts from Bradbury's novel demonstrate this author's enormous gift for language, even if the game doesn't CONS The off-the-rack puzzles and stiff gameplay feel 10 years out of date, and though the visuals are modern, they're an unattractive mess. S IS FOR SPACE bout a dozen years ago, back when the miniseries was God on network TV, NBC tried to make a miniseries out of The Martian Chronicles. They even drafted SF author Richard Matheson to write the 360-page screenplay. But all for naught: as anyone who catches it on cable these days can attest, it came only a little closer than the Byron Preiss game to capturing Bradbury's magic No, if it's Bradbury you're aching for, you've got to go back to ink on paper. Go to famous stories like \"The Sound of Thunder,\" with its gut-wrenching time travel twist, or \"The Veldt,\" with its early glimpse of virtual reality, or to some of the stories collected in R Is For Rocket or S Is For Space, such as \"The Million-Year Picnic,\" which also makes an appearance in The Martian Chronicles. Few yarns will give you a better taste than \"The Million-Year Picnic\" of what Bradbury calls his strange mixture of awe and wonder and beauty, along with terror.\" If you want to chow down on a double helping of short stories, a good place to start is with the two-volume Classic Stories, published in 1990, or with The Best of Ray Bradbury (1976), if you can turn up a copy. If it's novels you're after, there is no question that Fahrenheit 451— about to become a movie for the second time, incidentally--is the place to start. Something Wicked This Way Comes, with its powerful evocation of sinister small-town doings, is a good place to go next. For a less overtly science-fictional story, treat yourself to the charming and timeless Dandelion Wine.

"REVIEW Back To The Bullpen Accolade's Latest HARDBALL Is More A Changeup Than A Fastball by Jim Gindin This is a tale of two cities, one awash in enthusiasm, the other pessimistically expectant. The city of Seattle discovered baseball this year, and, amidst a lorrent of Jay Buhner home runs and a whirlwind of Randy Johnson strikeouls, watched their Mariners build their first playoff contender in franchise history. They filled the Kingdome with thunderous ovations, sending journalists in search of decibel meters and enough column inches to devote to the new heroes of the Northwest. Just being a part of the playof action was enough for them. The fans in Atlanta, meanwhile, had some what different feelings about their team's presence in the postseason. Sure they were excited, but having been there before and failed, they demanded nothing short of excellence. Outfielder David Justice was afraid his Braves would be viewed as a complete failure if they again fell short of a World Series title. Thankfully, they didn't fall short. Of course, the fans are already worried about next year. ... By this time, Accolade should expect more of an Atlanta reaction than a Seattle reaction from the gaming community to HARDBALL 5.

"on pass plays, the quarterback is locked into the receiver you've chosen. There is no such thing as a secondary receiver in PRO LEAGUE FOOTBALL, which means if you call a streak to your wide-out, and the defense calls a blitz, you'd better hope that the pocket holds up, because your quarterback won't dump it off to the tight end. Calling defenses is a more complicated proposition. After deciding whether to play the run or the pass, you select the defensive line play, the pass coverage, and the keys (offensive players to \"key\" on). Coaches who feel the need to create their own plays can do so easily by selecting the ball carrier, blocking schemes, etc. This method is much easier than the tedious systems found in most games, and can be accomplished even in midgame. The only drawback is that the plays designed in the game cannot be saved. There is a cow chip in this game's Astroturf, however. As a defense coordinator, you'll never know what offensive unit your opponent has sent in. For instance, if you saw an extra reciever or two enter the game (or were simply notified that the offense had a \"Hands\" squad in the huddle), you'd probably go to your nickel package on defense. Or, on 4th and 1, you'd know whether the opposing team was going for it or punting based on which unit took the field. Unfortunately, PRO LEAGUE leaves you guessing, so it's possible to get burned on unit matchups. WIND, RAIN, SLEET AND SNOW PRO LEAGUE simulates the elements graphically as well as on screen. AVERAGE GLITZ Graphically, PRO LEAGUE doesn't compete with sims like FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL, but it doesn't try to. Its player caricatures, although small and not-so well animated, boast near-flawless recreations of authentic NFL uniforms. Better yet, the action runs just swell on a 486/DX2 (it can be sped up even further by eliminating the players' jogging back to the huddle after each play). The onfield graphics boast eye-catching detail of end zone and mid-field markings, as well as added eye candy like photographers, TV types, and bench players milling about the sideline. that clearly hit the turf ruled an interception against my team (maybe the game is so authentic that the refs blow calls just as they often do in real life). On the minus side of the multimedia report card, Pro LEAGUE's sound is rather dreary, with down and distance given after each play, as well as a generic play result. What passes for crowd noise is so repetitive that most gamers will quickly toggle it ofl. PIGSKIN PLAY PRO LEAGUE offers plenty of play options. You can coach against the computer, let the computer handle both teams, submit game plans for remote play, or play via modem against a live opponent, an NFL PRO LEAGUE FOOTBALL staple over the years. It still works remarkably well, although noisy lines (seemingly on the increase) are a problem beyond even Micro Sports' reach. After one such \"dirty line\" problem, I had difficulty getting the modem feature up and running. It can be a finicky process. The unbeatable thrill of matching football wits against a live opponent, however, makes a little technical perseverance worthwhile.

"HEN lopen Call up TalonSoft for technical support or ask for some online advice and you might be surprised to find yourself talking to, or exchanging E-mail, with Jim Rose, TalonSoft's founder, president and chief game designer. It's all part of the company's philosophy of staying in touch with gamers to develop and produce the games customers want. Rose says he left Avalon Hill to gain more creative freedom and to focus his efforts on one or two projects. He started TalonSoft in February 1995, and teamed up with game programmer John Tiller. The company has since attracted former AH employees Steve Langmead (History of the World, FLIGHT COMMANDER 10), graphic artist Charles Kibler, and Bob McNamara (ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER). TalonSoft is staking its future on the Windows-based Battleview system featured in BATTLEGROUND: ARDENNES and its sequel, BATTLEGROUND: GETTYSBURG. The system was inspired by miniatures wargames that used hex-shaped terrain. But why was Windows chosen when DOS has, for so long, been the operating system of choice for games? \"I used to be one of the biggest opponents of Windows programs,\" Rose says. \"I said I'd never do a Windows game. I was wrong. I discovered that the more I worked in Windows, the more I liked it.\" He explained that Windows offers a far more stable programming environment and can greatly reduce programming time. Rose points to the lack of bugs in ARDENNES and the relatively few requests for technical support TalonSoft has received as evidence of Windows suitability for gaming. In the future, gamers can look for Battleview games from TalonSoft featuring the Napoleonic era (Waterloo in particular) and the American Revolution. Rose also isn't ruling out computer strategy games and futuristic wargames as possible projects. can teach you the game's basic mechanics portunity to change units or their deploywithin a half hour or so.

"til after research is complete. Of course, you can get such information from The Logic Factory's site on the World Wide Web (http://www.logicfactory.com/), but they made a design decision not to provide this detail in the packaged game materials. No, not to keep down the cost of goods on the product, but because a lot of scientific research in real life ends up taking you in directions you wouldn't have expected. Unfortunately, lew gamers appreciate such a nuance in design philosophy when they want control! Though the tutorial is very good at teaching the mechanics of the game, the utter lack of technical information about any technology is execrable. EMBARRASSING YOUR RICHES I really wanted to love this game. Even after discovering it was virtually pointless to play at this point, I still spent another two days slogging through it because it looked so good. ASCENDANCY has it all: cool technology, great graphics, intricate combat and funky aliens. Yet it all just sits there, disjointed, inanimate-like some sort of Baywatch Frankenstein, waiting for somebody to come along and provide the final jolt that will bring it to life. If The Logic Factory follows the SimTex system of continually putting out patches until they finally get a game right (and right now, it looks like they will, as a major Al patch has already been promised), then in about six months or so I might be playing this game again. But if you are the type who THE SPACE RACES or those of you who are giving ASCENDANCY a chance, you may have noticed that, while the pre-game racial descriptions are fascinating, they don't tell you much about an alien advantage, and there is no way of finding out until after you start a game. Well, to save a bit of time and help you make an informed choice, here are each race's advantages in specific game terms. Minions: These guys always succeed in a planetary invasion regardless of defenses. Snovemdomas: These walking tanks have the advantage of doubling the hit points of their ships. Orfa: A real estate agent's dream, Orfa can build on black planetary squares without having to terraform like other races. Kambuchka: Can see the homeworlds of all races in the game. Hanshanks: These are telepaths who are in diplomatic contact with all other races from the start of the game. A dubious advantage until the Al is improved. Fludentri: Busy little workers who can repair all damage on all of their ships once every 60 days. Balifids: The best diplomats in the game, they can force an enemy to make peace once every 100 days. Again, another dubious ability given the current game. Swaparamans: Can double the energy output of their ships every 62 days. Frutmaka: These evil spuds can teleport all enemy ships out of their star systems once every 77 days. Shevar: A race of energy leeches which can drain the energy from enemy ships in their space every 90 days. Govorom: Every 150 days, these busy little breeders can turn their lowest population world into a teeming Rich world. Ungooma: These guys can bump all enemy ships in transit along a starlane back to their point of origin once every 70 days. Dubtaks: Space thieves who can \"acquire any technology that at least two other races in the game already hold. This dastardly deed needs 63 days between uses. Capelons: Once every 66 days this race's colonies become invulnerable for one day. Mebes: Can increase the population limit on their colony worlds every 72 days. Oculons: For Astronomers who like to know where they are going before they leave, this race starts the game seeing all possible starlane connections in the cluster. Arbryls: These aliens just want to be left alone and can block all starlanes leading to their colonies. This ability needs 92 days to recharge and is not very useful considering how easily blocked starlanes can be blown open. Marmosians: Another diplomatic power of limited usefulness, this mind-control race can turn other races against each other once every 100 days. Chronomist: This race values speed and has the fastest travel speed along starlanes. A great choice if you like a quick game. Chamachies. These scientists-from-hell can instantly make a tech breakthrough once every 89 days. A very powerful ability in a game where a new device could mean supremacy. Nimbuloids: Energy creatures with a strong work ethic, these aliens can significantly cut building times across their colonies every 68 days. 13 Carlovedor SH Current Proxect. game-but for now, the search for a new SpaceWar King goes on. & Errent Encion Algus Coke Base THE EDITORS SPEAK Ion Wrap has little online access with which to track down the latest fix program (or you are a rightfully annoyed gamer who thinks a game better work right when it comes out of the box), then this should probably be a pass for you.

"The Options Staff Duties Planning Those Bradley's Nightmare One of the fictional scenarios in D-DAY: AMERICA INVADES Simulates an attack by the 2nd Panzer Division against the over-extended lines of the American Big Red One. Driving on Caumont, the 1st Infantry runs smack-dab into Rommel's tanks and the bocage becomes decidedly unfriendly. A small scenario, Bradley's Nightmare is much more fun to play from the German side, as the Americans really can't do much attacking. Even so, a German commander will have to push hard, for the American rear if the panzer troops are to celebrate a victory.

It's small, so the unit by unit micromanagement isn't as wearying as in large battles, but the limited number of units and the greater importance of each battle only highlights the lack of sophistication in the game engine. Combat factors and col-1 umn shifts are the only things that matter; subordination, formations, and unit boundaries, are all immaterial. The German player does face an interesting challenge in crushing the exposed American vanguard rapidly enough to push the Wehrmacht spearheads deep into the 1st Divisions sector. For the Americans, it's largely a matter of fall back and hold, while the boys in the rear dig like crazy. With little room to maneuver and a short timetable, Bradley's Nightmare inevitably becomes a short, brutal slugfest. Day involves. Scenarios that take too long to play, and degenerate into endless series of inconclusive and incongruous skirmishes.

Also, under the section \"Recruiting Hidden Units\" the callsign listed in item #3—ENZO should have read Enzo. We sentenced the freebirth cadet responsible for these errors to a Trial of Grievance against a BattleMaster, which shot his legs and arms off in short order, before stomping him to death.

Recruiting Hidden Units In MECHWARRIOR 2, you can use three undocumented units by following this procedure: 1. Select Trials of Grievance from the main menu. 2. Select the star configuration option (the five-pointed star) for the Mechs in your group. 3. In the configuration screen, erase your current call sign and replace it with the word Enzo. 4. Return to the Mech lab, and you'll be able to examine two new Mechs and a suit of combat armor worn by clan soldiers (the Tarantula, Battle Master and the Elemental combat armor). The Elemental and the Tarantula can both be used in combat. Using the BattleMaster in combat will cause a program error, but this problem can be remedied by using Louis C. Hendricks' Battle Master utility (BTTLMSTR.ZIP, described above) to patch the MW2 program files. WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, FTP IT!

Instead of a Finite State Machine, we have an Al system which is goal-based. An Al pilot doesn't really live in a state, but rather seeks to execute a goal.

"L ASG an easy kill. The Al pilots process a whole myriad of changing variables. In HEXEN, the monsters simply need to know where you are—if they're in attack mode, then that's all the feedback they need. In MECHWARRIOR 2, the AI must provide the illusion of being a real combatant, so the Al pilot is always aware of your distance, heading, relative angle and the type of mech that you're in. He also takes into account his own mech, the amount of ammo remaining and how badly he's hurt. All of this input streams constantly into the behavior algorithms, allowing the computer pilot to then determine the next appropriate move, based on the situational variable, pilot skill and the overriding mission goals. 42m Falcon Stormer eo CHaT et TOO MANY BITS This \"data overload\" can lead to some NOW TWIST AT THE WAIST This Stormcrow is utilizing torso rotation to get a better bead on you—definitely interesting situations.

"=SCORE Tal of fame Welcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. HIGHLIGHTS Ultima IT ULTIMA VI ULTIMA UNDERWORLD Under World ORIGIN SYSTEMS, 1990 ORIGIN SYSTEMS, 1992 The world of Britannia was no longer so vifor years, smooth-scrolling first-person 3-D brant by ULTIMA V, leaving some to wonder if gameplay was exclusively the province of driLord British was jaded with his creation. ULTIving, flying and space combat games. Then MA VI, then, was a bit of a shock, replacing the along came ULTIMA UNDERWORLD: THE STYGIAN tired Apple II graphics with a new three-quarter-screen VGA ABYSS. While there were first-person games before UNDERperspective. The world was large, the quests numerous. The WORLD, none could match the convincing look of its environcentral theme was ostensibly the elimination of the gargoyle ment, composed of dungeon walls \"painted\" with menace, but the storyline was darker than usual, with moral texture-mapped graphics. UNDERWORLD's innovative interface choices abounding in the quintessential ULTIMA tradition. At enabled movement through those corridors, not frame by various times, your character was called upon to make sacriframe, but with the environment smoothly recalculated and refices, conduct diplomacy, and fight racial predjudice without drawn according to your input. The combat (always a must for betraying your friends. Conversations were more involved real RPGs) was clever as well: a two-step process entailed than in previous games of the series, but the new six-button pulling a weapon back and then releasing it, with the severity of interface made the action flow more smoothly. Perhaps the the blow dependent on the interval between the strokes. Debest thing about ULTIMA VI was that it showed that Lord spite its ground-breaking technology, the game was designed British and Co. were still willing to take chances, and their for ease of use; even the auto-map feature let you input your continued enthusiasm for Britannia showed in the quality of own notes. All in all, a distinguished incarnation of the most the story-telling celebrated role-playing system yet designed for the computer.

"Yamaha sounds best, whether you play here... or here. BESTE On stage or on CD, Yamaha instruments set the standard for the best sound quality. Now the Yamaha WaveForce DB50XG puts all that sound on a daughter board that snaps right on to your existing WaveBlaster connector-equipped soundcard. It doesn't require any new software or messing with switches. The DB50XG instantly and dramatically improves the sound of your games, music and multimedia presentations. The DB50XG uses exclusive Yamaha Advanced Wave Memory (AWM) technology so you're hearing actual sounds digitally stored onto 4MB of wave-ROM (that's four times the amount most other cards use). More wave-ROM means more variety and better sound quality. And these sounds are identical to the ones Yamaha puts in our highly acclaimed professional keyboards: the best sounds in the industry. GENERAL It's not just the sounds, but the superior control of them that sets the DB50XG apart. The new XG format takes control far beyond General MIDI (GM). And with major game developers implementing XC, you won't want to be stuck with a card that doesn't keep up with the times. The DB50XC will play all of your favorite GM compatible software. And with its superior sounds, it will play them better than you've ever heard before. It's amazing what a simple upgrade can do. The Yamaha Waveforce DB50XG sounds so good, you'll YAMAHA need to check your CD-ROM drive to make sure you're not playing an audio CD.
