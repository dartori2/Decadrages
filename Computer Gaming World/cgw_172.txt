"Requiem for a Cruiserweight Avalon Hill Sells Out to Hasbro for $6M, Ending 40 Years of Game Publishing STRATEGYZWA and the eradication of smallpox. What I never thought I'd see is the end of Avalon Hill, which was sold in August to Hasbro for $6 million. Sure, the primary owners, Eric and Jack Dott, still run the Monarch printing company, but we'll no longer have paper tanks, pirate cards, or ASL scenarios coming off their presses. Over four decades, AH survived a lot of challenges to its gaming dominance. In the 1970s, rival SPI bout 40 years ago, Charles Roberts was struggling to come up with a probability system for a strategy game. Over a long night, he started rolling dice, and in a blur of inspiration and lost sleep. he came up with the first combat results table. This added a bit of uncertainty to combat, forever separating wargames from parlor games such as chess. No one knew then that Roberts' game, Tactics, would usher in the age of the commercial wargame. Tactics II, which introduced the concept of hexagons, effectively solved the problems inherent in square grids. By the early 1960s, the fledgling Avalon Hill Game Company (AH) had amassed quite a line up, with most of its games featuring the hexgrid mapboards and colorful cardboard counters that are still standard in many of today's strategy games. In 40 years, AH produced an incredible number of timeless designs: Third Reich, Football Strategy, We the People, March Madness, Up Front Panzerblitz, Squad Leader-the list goes on for hundreds of titles. It's hard to imagine a boardgame or computer game set in North Africa, for instance, that doesn't owe a debt to Afrika Korps. And where would games such as MASTER OF ORION or AGE OF EMPIRES be without the legacy of Diplomacy? Chances are, nearly all of your gaming buddies-including your favorite realtime strategy game designerhave enjoyed an Avalon Hill game. in the last two years, as PC development budgets soared. Even when it had grade-A products, such as ACHTUNG! SPITFIRE, AH didn't support products with ad dollars comparable to its competitors', and PC sales plummeted. Meanwhile, a disastrous attempt to cash in on baseball-card mania and the startup of Girls' Life magazine by the owners drained cash flow. Nearly two years ago, AH began searching for a \"strategic partnership\" that never materialized. Interplay (which had already purchased the PC rights to most of the old SP gaming line) tried to buy the AH game company for a price rumored to be between $3-4 million, but the Dotts wanted to sell all of Monarch Avalon's holdings, including Girls' Life and the dated printing facilities, and talks fell through. About a year ago, trying to fill out his collection of boardgames. As one observer put it, \"At least they let us have one last big party before they shut everything down.\" And shut it down they did: AH was sold to Hasbro the day after Avaloncon ended. The Dotts let the entire creative staff go the very next day-giving them severance pay only through the end of the week, even though the employees had worked all weekend at Avaloncon. That's some show of gratitude, especially to someone like ace developer Don Greenwood, who's been with AH for over 26 years. What I mourn most is the passing of the idea that you could make challenging games for adults that didn't cater to the latest fad. I'd hate to think that our current era of Clones & Conquer is the beall, end-all of strategy gaming. Chances are, nearly all of your gaming buddies have enjoyed an Avalon Hill game. published hundreds of wargames that they positioned as serious simulations, and smaller companies like Metagaming sold sci-fi games such as Ogre for a dollar-when the going boardgame rate was 10 times that. AH stuck to its guns, however, and outlasted all of its contemporaries. AH was still worth over $10 million in 1990, but its boardgame sales took a tremendous hit when the company lost its Toys 'R' Us and Children's Palace accounts in 1993. To make up the lost revenues, AH (led by Jim Rose) tried to jump-start its PC games division: KINGMAKER sold nearly 40,000 units in 1994. Yet AH continued to develop PC games on boardgame budgets, which became a liability MicroProse valued the entire AH game line at only $250,000. Things quickly got worse in 1998. When the smoke cleared from the CIVILIZATION lawsuit (see last month's READ.ME), AH paid out nearly half a million dollars and lost publishing rights to one of its all-time best sellers. Then HISTORY OF THE WORLD sold fewer than 10,000 units. Finally, Big Time Software announced it would no longer be doing COMPUTER SQUAD LEADER. In the end, Hasbro got a good deal, and probably didn't buy the AH brand to shut it down entirely. Still, having pretty plastic pieces in mainstream fare like History of the World or Acquire won't make up for the lack of new ASL scenarios, and it's unlikely we'll see any more sequels to Stonewall Jackson's Way. My cynicism aside, it is possible that Hasbro will keep the creative torch burning. But for some reason I'm left with one haunting image from Avaloncon: hundreds of copies of the General magazine, left behind on wire racks, unsold, their pages flipping unnoticed in the convention site's air-conditioned breeze. The General has since ceased publication-draw your own conclusions. CGW Thank You for playing Like the rest of my generation, I've witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall, the breakup of the Beatles, Cold Shutdown So, Avaloncon in August was essentially a wake, as even avid fans sensed the end was near.

Odd isn't it, that this will make the third ULTIMA product in a row to be, well, pathetic. Has any other once-proud series (or publisher!) dropped so low? However, we need not be so overly negative on Origin's laudable attempt to broaden ULTIMA'S appeal. Rather, we should support their valiant effort in this regard. After all, why should a role-playing series seek only to involve roleplayers? Stuff and nonsense! Despite my past quibbles with Origin over their vacillations on the Amiga version of ULTIMA VI, I'm willing to move on a mere six years later. In that spirit, I am proud to share my ideas for ways that Origin can further develop Ultima without changing the strategy they've used in PAGAN and ASCENSION. Not having the obvious skills of Origin's crack staff for naming games, I've just given them descriptive names. Because I am so excited about this bold new face of computer gaming, I'm actually giving these ideas to Origin without any hope of compensation.

"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD ETTERS You can see from this why game companies are backing away from adventures. Apart from Myst and River, most of these games probably lost money. For a gamer's perspective on this issue, read the following letter from an adventure. game fan. Mys-Adventures It takes guts to fess up after flaming puzzle-oriented, point-and-click adventures for so long (Johnny Wilson's editorial, August '98). But I think you missed an even more important point than that raised in your editorial (that Riven and Myst owners play other games). The statistics you presented illustrate that, across the board, the number one gaming genre for Riven owners, casual gamers, and core gamers alike is adventure games (number two is action games). Adventure games in general don't get much ink, but those figures indicate that the gaming public certainly gravitates to them. Clearly, game developers and publishers have not dropped their efforts to create enjoyable and challenging adventure games. Game magazines should not dismiss those efforts out of hand. -Jeff Sengstack via the Internet TU CURSE OM MONKEY STANIS PUBLISHER Lee Uniacke EDITORIAL Editor-in-Chief Johnny Wilson Executive Editor Ken Brown Managing Editor loe Vallina Features Editor Denny Atkin (Simulations) Reviews Editor Terry Coleman (Wargames) Technical Editor Dave Salvator (Hardware) Associate Editor Jeff Green (Adventure, Sports) Associate Editor Robert \"Machine Gun Coffey (Action, Strategy) Assistant Editor Allen Greenberg Editorial Assistant Matthew Schaefer CG-ROM Editor Jack Rodrigues CG-ROM Assistant Thierry \"Scooter Nguyen Editorial Intern Kenneth Johnson Gossip Editor Linda Y.

However, we've seen strong indications that publishers are backing away from adventure games. Broderbund, publisher of the bestselling adventure game of all time, has basically abandoned the genre. Blizzard canceled plans for WARCRAFT ADVENTURES Sierra, once synonymous with adventure gaming, is currently developing only two titles in the category (GABRIEL KNIGHT III and King's Quest: MASK OF ETERNITY). We expect to see very few classic graphic adventures in the next year. Between creating the game and marketing expenses, the cost of producing a graphic adventure is around $2—3 million. At $30 a pop, you've got to sell 67,000 copies just to break even. According to PC Data (Reston, VA), below are the top 12 best-selling adventure games for 1998, as of July: Cursing Curse It may be a little late to comment on this, but am I the only person who didn't appreciate CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND's attempt to bring adventure gaming back to how it used to be? I will admit that it was a funny game. However, what should drive an adventure game is its storyline and plot, which seem totally nonexistent here. We get nice cut-scenes at the outset of Chapters One and Two to get the ball rolling, but then it just seems to grind to a halt. We get few cutscenes beyond those, and at least 75 percent of the time I seemed to be performing foolish, useless tasks that, later, conveniently had some positive effect. When I launched the skeleton into the tomb, I had no idea why! was doing it; I was trying every possible action and then just got lucky. This instance and ones like it destroyed much of my enjoyment. When I play an adventure game, I want it to be immersive, with suspense and a developing plot. I want every puzzle to be linked to the plot. I want sensible dialogue that moves things along. I'd take GABRIEL KNIGHT II or PANDORA DIRECTIVE any day over CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND. They were much longer and more involved, but it took me longer to beat CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND because I booted it up only once or twice a week. Nothing was dragging me back to play. I didn't care what happened next. LeChuck, a good villain, was underused and would have added more incentive to play if he had appeared more often. You haven't reviewed FINAL FANTASY VII yet, but I'm sure the reason you'll give it a high grade is its epic plot. It's more enthralling than any I've ever seen in a game. More designers should emulate it-at least in respect to its plot. The madcap humor in SAM & Max HIT THE ROAD and DAY OF THE TENTACLE made up for their shortcomings in plot, but they still had good villains and reasons to keep playing.

"THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Edited by Ken Brown (Ken_Brown@zd.com) READ.ME Road Rage Rides Again Expect Skinny Ties, Bad Haircuts, and Vehicular Homicide In Activision's INTERSTATE '82 ans of INTERSTATE '76's funk-filled auto combat, take heart. Activision has dropped a new engine into this gaming hot-rod and should roll out the new model in early '99. Six years have passed in the gameworld, and I-76's hero, Groove Champion, is retired, having lost a leg in an unfortunate combine accident. The now onelegged Groove stumbles upon a government plot involving the Contras and promptly vanishesbut not before getting word out to the last living Champion sibling, little sister Skye. Adopting the autovigilante identity of \"Vixen,\" biker babe Skye recruits the Jeri-curled Taurus to help rescue her brother and foil the creepers' sinister plot. Taurus was easily the coolest character from the first game, so INTERSTATE road warriors should be elated to hear that the game casts you as the digital equivalent of Samuel L. Jackson this time around. The rusty, modified MECHWARRIOR II engine that powered 1-'76 has been scrapped for parts and the design team has opted for the added horsepower of the Dark Side engine that powers HEAVY GEAR II. This means that next year's model will require 3D 38 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"hardware, but you'll get all the 3D eye candy we've come to know and love, including fog, realistic wakes left in water, lightning, and reflection effects. 1-'76 drivers rightfully complained about the loss of framerates as their cars took damage, and the designers have listened: This time cars will sport textures (such as scorch marks from rockets) instead of the frame. gobbling hundreds of polygons that depicted crumpled bodies in the first game. Ricocheting README projectiles will also enhance '82's appeal. A virtual armada of new vehicles will hit the tarmac in l-'82, including golf carts, buses, helicopters, and more than 40 cars. While the autos of the '80s weren't all that memorable, the songs and burgeoning MTV cul ture of the time did display a preference for classic '50s cars. Remember ZZ Top's groovemobile? What about Springsteen's \"Pink Cadillac\"? Expect to see versions of those as well as a certain sports car with doors that open like wings. INTERSTATE '82's gameplay will focus even more squarely on action this time around. True 3D environ ments, such as multi-tiered parking garages and sewers, will add a whole new dimension to multiplay er games. Players will still be able to outfit their own cars, but there will be countermeasures for every weapon, such as reflective armor to foil energy weapons. The most radical change is the ability to abandon your car and head out on foot. As a pistol-packin' pedestrian, you'll be able to attack enemies or commandeer new vehicles; in fact, certain single player scenarios will require it. CGW will have more on this wild ride in our exclusive preview in the March issue. -Robert \"Bonebrake\" Coffey When Cavedogs Dream, They Fantasize About Total Annihilation: Kingdoms W ith a true 3D engine that was integral to the game, TOTAL ANNIHILATION (TA) was one of the top strategy games of 1997. Although the game's manic designer, Chris Taylor, has left the building to start his own company (Gas-Powered Games), the team that unleashed TA is now reworking it in a fantasy milieu. Cavedog recently opened its skirt long enough to give CGW a quick thrill, and we'll be bringing you more with our exclusive preview of the game in January. KINGDOMS will look totally unlike TA. Instead of alien worlds, you'll fight on islands and hills with roads, trees, and towns. TA's trademark 3D terrain will once again mean that elevation and line-of-sight are strategic factors. One of the levels we saw featured high cliffs overlooking the sea, and it was easy to see how a group of archers could wreak havoc on invaders. To further the impression of a living world, Cavedog also plans to have nonplayer characters and monsters. Players will choose from one of four sides: Earth and Water are good; Air and Fire are evil. Each side will have a unique interface, build hierarchy, and strategy. Resource management has been simplified, but you'll still need to acquire resources to conjure units and summon gods and deities. The game's designers say that KINGDOM's maps and battles will be at least as big as those in TA, if not bigger. Formations will facil i tate large unit movement. Current plans call for a total of 168 units, with each side's units having unique abilities. We only saw a small number of units, but we were impressed with the high level of detail and articulation they had. The ships have billowi ng sails that track back and forth depending on the wind. The unit graphics rival those in AGE OF EMPIRES, which is remarkable considering that KINGDOMS renders units in real-time (AOE uses pre-rendered bitmaps). Some of the units have different motions for individual actions, so that a swordsman, for example, might have six different sword swings. Cavedog will once again make additional units free to download, although not as frequently as before. Perhaps most impressive about KINGDOMS is its stunning graph. ics. The water graphics and 3D elevation combine to create the most beautiful shorelines we've seen in any realtime strategy game. Some coastal areas almost look like aerial photos of the tropics. What's more, when ships go down, they sink at the level of the terrainsome drop out of sight and others remain clearly visible below the waves, with their masts sticking out from the water. It's not just for looks: Coastal shipwrecks can become added defensive barriers. We can only hope that Cavedog can extend that level of detail while reinventing TA's awesome battles with a balanced mix of fantasy and medieval units. If they do, this game should breathe fire into the hearts of thousands of strategy fans. Be sure to catch our exclusive cover story on the game coming in CGW's January issue.--Ken Brown Spy Screens TA: KINGDOMS' 16-bit graphics and detailed 3D terrain make for stunning scenery.

Robert Ballard is the sort of person who would be handy to have around if you lost your car in a parking lot. Not only is Dr. Ballard the celebrated explorer who discovered the wreck of the Titanicmired 50 feet into the ocean floor two-and-onehalf miles underwater, he also located the Bismarck and, just this past May, the WWII aircraft carrier USS Yorktown, along with four Japanese ships responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor. Soon he'll be taking off for the Black Sea to search the oxygen-deprived waters for preserved artifacts of the \"Sea People\" of Ashkalon described in Egyptian hieroglyphics. He'll also look for evidence to support the theory that 7,000 years ago melting polar ice raised the waters of the Black Sea, leading to the Great Deluge recorded in the Bible. So, what is this man doing in front of a computer screen in New York City? Playing games. \"You have to do everything do,\" says Dr. Ballard when I find him, feet up on a table, his trademark baseball cap covering a slightly sunburnt head. \"Every damn thing that happens in the real world, you have to deal with in this game.\" The third game in recent memo ry to include the now-golden word \"Titanic\" in its name, TITANIC: CHALLENGE OF DISCOVERY is the first (as Dr. Ballard proudly points out) to be set firmly in the real world. Gamers wander around a seaside town modeled after Mystic, Connecticut, choose a nine-person crew and a ship, do the research necessary to find the wreck they're looking for, and then go out and test their mettle against the elements, the financial reality of running an expedition, and the headaches and glories of cutting-edge technology. Six missions give you the chance to locate, map, and explore three ships, including the Titanic. It took two years to finish the game, Dr. Ballard says, ticking off a list of participants from Germany, Russia, Italy, France, Japan, and the U.S. About six months of that time was spent ensuring the game's authenticity: Ballard took his team of 30 computer scientists from Moscow out to sea, where they got to experience the real thing firsthand while Ballard's crew of explorers got to pick holes in the simulation If the first game does well, Dr. Ballard is prepared to follow it up with a second title based on his explorations of the wrecks of the Battle of Midway. But the Titanic was the obvious, and perhaps nec. essary, starting point. \"I thought it had gone away 12 years ago,\" Ballard says about Titanic-mania, \"and it had until (James Cameron made the movie. It seems that each generation rediscovers the Titanic. It is, ironically, unsinkable.\" TITANIC: CHALLENGE OF DISCOVERY, from Panasonic, is now available in stores nationwide. -Charles Ardai Q4 '98 Q1 99 28 04'98 WHERE'S LEONARDO?

"README CGW Legal Brief: The UO Lawsuit with the lawsuit, the court will allow some time for factual investigation (discovery). Then the court will determine if the plain tiffs can certify themselves as a \"realtime,\" the latency is so bad that it takes minutes for keystrokes to be implemented on the screen; (4) the minimum system require ments listed on the box are far lower than what is actually needed to play the game; and (5) EA and Origin promised that all gameplay problems would be fixed, but noth ing has been resolved. Public reaction to the lawsuit has been mixed. Some gamers have flamed the plaintiffs and their attorney, San Diego lawyer George Schultz, by alleging that the whole purpose of filing the lawsuit is to make a quick buck. However, many gamers have praised the plainlawsuit where numerous similarly situated plaintiffs can file one big lawsuit against a provider of goods or services. It has the benefit of allowing individual consumers to band together instead of going it alone against a large company in smallclaims court. If the court determines the plaintiffs are sufficiently homogenous to be a class, then the floodgates BASIN his could be a watershed year in the computer gaming industry. For the first time ever, a group of gamers have filed a class-action lawsuit against a game publisher, alleging that a game does not measure up to the representations made on the box. The suit was filed in March against Electronic Arts and Origin Systems over ULTIMA ONLINE, and the case is gradually making its way to trial. The gamers allege that EA and Origin (the publisher and developer of ULTIMA ONLINE, respectively) are liable for damages on several legal theories, which include breach of contract, negligence, misrepresentation, and breach of warranty. Game companies have been sued on similar grounds before, but prior suits have generally involved the interpretation of semantics. For example, Apogee and Creative Labs were sued because the packaging for one of Creative Labs' sound cards stated that a free copy of Apogee's WOLFENSTEIN 3-D was bundled inside, when, in fact, only the shareware version was included. What makes the ULTIMA ONLINE suit unique is that the allegations against EA and Origin concern not only alleged falsehoods on the box, but also the belief that the game does not play like the defendants represented it would. In other words, EA and Origin have released (gasp!) a buggy game. The plaintiffs' suit goes on for 100 paragraphs of legalese, but the allegations can be distilled to the following list: (1) the ULTIMA ONLINE packaging failed to mention that there would be a $10 monthly charge to play and that a credit card is needed after the 30day free trial period; (2) EA and Origin represented that the game could be played \"24 hours a day, every day,\" when, in reality, the servers crash with annoying frequency: (3) whereas the box indicates the game can be played in tions, it is unlikely that EA and Origin will be able to get off without paying big time. Whereas the amount of damages recoverable by each plaintiff is most likely limited to the price of the game ($60) and maybe a few monthly charges ($10/mo.), the cost to EA and Origin could be huge if they are forced to make a complete refund to more than 200,000 gamers. It is a fact of life that suits of this type settle about 95 percent of the time and rarely for the total damages claimed. Instead of risking a financially devastating adverse judgment, defendants usually try to reach a compromise agreement Schultz has already told EA and Origin what his clients are willing to accept in settlement: a few months of free play to compensate the plaintiffs for the time they were, in Schultz's words, \"paying betatesters,\" and an enforceable promise from EA and Origin to fix some of the games' major technical flaws. EA and Origin have yet to respond. Whether the suit will herald a major change in the way computer games are published and marketed remains to be seen. Undoubtedly, developers and publishers will be keeping a close eye on the litigation. In the meantime, EA and Origin collect an estimated $1,000,000 per month from ULTIMA ONLINE's remaining subscriberswhich, by the way, include Schultz and most of the plaintiffs.

According to the plaintiffs' supporters, game companies have long gotten away with releasing bug-laden products that do not work as advertised. The supporters see the lawsuit as a wakeup call to publishers and developers that gamers are mad as hell and are not going to take it anymore. Detractors say the suit will have a chilling effect on the game industry such that innovative products, like ULTIMA ONLINE, will not be released for fear of litigation. Whatever the merits of the suit, the plaintiffs have a long road ahead before they will see any money. Now that EA and Origin have been formally served could open for just about everyone who has bought ULTIMA ONLINE to become a plaintiff. According to attorney Schultz, over 200,000 gamers have purchased ULTIMA ONLINE and every one is a potential plaintiff. If everything goes as planned, the court should have ruled on class certification by the time you read this. We'll follow up with more details as they emerge. As for potential damages, the culpability of EA and Origin will play a large role in any settlement or judgment.

"READ.ME The Buying Game Several Key Game Companies Change Hands, While Blizzard, Sierra, and Berkeley Go up for Sale ENTERT INMENT COMMY CHEST RENE 10RS CICE SGC August was a hectic month EA Acquires Westwood For $122.5M ugust was a hectic month on the business side of the gaming industry. Electronic Arts acquired Westwood Studios, Hasbro Interactive bought MicroProse, and The Learning Company purchased Broderbund. During the same NEWS ANALYSIS month, Cendant Corp. accounced its intention to sell Cendant Software, a collection of companies that includes Sierra On-Line, Blizzard Entertainment, and Berkeley Systems. We wanted to delve into the reasons for these purchases and explain some of the recent history behind the changes. We don't usually focus this much on corporate news, but given the number of recent developments and the importance of the companies involved, we thought it merited a closer look. lectronic Arts seized the jewel of Virgin Interactive with its August acquisition of Westwood Studios for $122.5 million. The sale includes Westwood's COMMAND & CONQUER properties, Virgin internal development, and select Virgin games in development. It does not include Virgin Interactive's distribution, which EA, with distribution in more than 75 countries, didn't need. Sellers Viacom and Spelling Entertainment had sought a buyer for the money-losing Virgin for several months. (Viacom owns approximately 80 percent of Spelling Entertainment, which in turn owns more than 90 percent of Westwood Studios, a division of Virgin Interactive.) Viacom made public its intention to \"dispose of its interactive entertainment business last year. Although Virgin acquired Westwood Studios in 1992 for an undisclosed sum, the relationship soon became a case of the tail wagging the dog. While Westwood Studios released a string of successful titles, including COMMAND & CONQUER and C&C: RED ALERT, Virgin consistently lost money by developing numerous titles with weak sales volumes. In the past year, Westwood co-founder Brett Sperry took control of Virgin's internal development, discontinuing several projects and strengthening the company's line. Still, much of the damage had already been done. Last year, operating losses at Viacom's interactive games business were $43.5 million on sales of $241.3 million, according to the company's annual report. EA's acquisition of Westwood is merely the latest in a series of purchases to increase its market share. By acquiring Las Vegas-based Westwood, EA takes over the rights to COMMAND & CONQUER, LANDS OF LORE, DUNE, and the brain trust that created them. Both Sperry and Louis Castle, who founded Westwood in 1985, signed five-year employment contracts with EA. EA's purchase also includes Virgin's internal development and some of its existing projects. Virgin has only a handful of titles in the works, and will eventually be shut down, according to a source close to the company. The same source indicated that the Virgin games EA acquired will either be under the EA or Westwood label. Electronic Arts, headquartered in San Mateo, CA, is the world's largest interactive entertainment software company. Founded in 1982, EA posted revenues of $909 million for fiscal 1998 as of August. Approximately 25 percent of the company's revenue is derived from PC game sales. -Ken Brown 54 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"CENDANT oftware Big Brother Is Still Watching READ ME New Adventure Game Goes 40 Years Beyond 1984 28 ERRA / MELN LITYHONORA / ant 7200 ans of George Orwell's classic novel 1984 can experience a fresh incarnation of his dystopic universe this winter. BIG BROTHER, a new adventure game from newcomer Mediax, projects Orwell's Oceania 40 years beyond the novel to an even grittier, more foreboding future. Prole Eric Blair is a soldier back from the front searching for clues behind his girlfriend's disappearance. In a suspicious world monitored by a repressive regime, you'll be forced to cut risky deals to discover if state agents or underground figures are behind her abduction. The game is set in firstperson, combining traditional adventure and puzzle-solving elements with sudden bursts of action. In addition to staying Molly can get you access to the alive, you'll have to stay out master computer in the Ministry of prison, judging each action of Truth, but there's a price. based on how arrestable you are. Rather than licensing an existing engine, MediaX developed its own to allow large amounts of character animation. The animations are designed to enhance the game's realism as Blair talks with a host of characters to further the story. Dialogue is especially meaningful since Blair's social standing plays a key role in the game. In addition to the dialogue, the game is filled with puzzles as Blair strives to access restricted areas and escape tight situations. He'll have to contend with giant steam-powered machines, clunky mainframe computers and ubiquitous observation cameras. Like the book, the game's retro tech feel is based on a vision of the future from 1948. Expect to see four-foot flat panel displays with big steam pipes protruding from them, dreary cityscapes and oily machinery. Watch for BIG BROTHER this December. -Ken Brown Hasbro Interactive Snaps Up MicroProse and Avalon Hill asbro Interactive cemented its intention of being a power player in the computer games industry by acquiring Avalon Hill and MicroProse for $6and $70 million, respectively. Hasbro, which owns Milton-Bradley, Parker Brothers, and numerous toy and game properties, has been in an aggressive acquisition mode for several years, and seems to have purchased the two gaming companies for different reasons. In the case of Avalon Hill (AH), some industry observers speculated that Hasbro bought AH for its computer-game division. This is unlikely, since no AH game in the past five years sold even 50,000 units worldwide. A more plausible explanation is that Hasbro wanted the more than 300 boardgame, card game, and paper RPG products for which AH owned the rights. This would seem a good match, since AH was losing money in recent years due to dwindling boardgame sales, while Hasbro's boardgame division had over $200M in 1997 revenues. Hasbro's superior distribution should introduce the more mainstream AH titles to a much greater audience. Tentative plans are to \"spiff up\" Diplomacy, History of the World, Acquire, Stocks and Bonds, and similar titles, replacing cardboard counters with plastic pieces, and providing slicker packaging. Hasbro's acquisition of MicroProse is quite another matter. Once an industry leader, MPS has fallen on hard times, losing $65 million over the past three years.

Wilson ssume everything you believe about the economic foundation of your universe to be wrong. Then discover that your most vicious enemies have access to alarming new technologies. Such is the setup behind COMMAND & CONQUER 2: TIBERIAN SUN (TS). In TS, you'll learn more about the properties of tiberium, additional background on Kane, Something New Under the Tiberian Sun Lead designer Erik Yeo has deliberately moved this game away from scripted events. The model underneath TS is driven by physical properties. Weight, flammability, and downforce play important roles, and the map can change as bodies of water freeze, bridges are destroyed, meteorites crash, or weather modifies the terrain. Add random multiplayer maps to this, and no one has the advantage of memorizing maps. The goal was to create a world with enough interesting terrain effects and possibilities that gamers wouldn't always be able to win with a brute-force, head-to-head attack. As Yeo told us, \"In the earlier games, I tended to design missions the way I would solve them. Now, you just do it your way. If you can think of it, it should work.\" In the early scenario we played, we got the distinct feel ing that this world is alive and that terrain matters. The building phase, too, has been revised and isn't tied to a linear path. When you click on a building, the possible upgrades are attached so that you can add whatever you want. If you decide in midscenario that you've upgraded unwisely (perhaps adding a SAM site when you needed a vulcan cannon), you merely sell off the former and use the money to build the latter. One of the nifty new base refinements in TS is a hunter/seeker droid that searches out an enemy, attaches itself, and allows you to observe whatever that enemy unit observes. When you tire of spying, you can selfdestruct at will. Further, you can add threat detection to a radar base, build a hospital to heal infantry, and construct an armory to upgrade units. TS promises another interesting wrinkle in the way it handles civilians. Civilians and mutants no longer just stand around. They tend to form militias. You won't be able to control civilians, but you will be able to protect or destroy them. Protecting them has certain advantages—you may get additional intelligence or support from them Command & Conquer 2: Tiberian Sun crash or GENRE: Strategy RELEASE DATE: Q4 '98 DEVELOPER: Westwood PUBLISHER: Electronic Arts 38 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"Shogo This Anime Actionfest Should Be the Surprise 3D Shooter Hit of the Year SNEAK PREVIEWS by Terry Coleman t wasn't very long ago that another CGW editor and I were lamenting how long it had been since a 3D shooter had really reloaded our BFGs. For me, QUAKE II was more evolutionary than revolutionary, and even MYSTERIES OF THE SITH, the add-on to JEDI KNIGHT, left me feeling on the outside of the Force. UNREAL was a decent single-player game, but its multiplayer mode (especially over the Internet) had such a bad framerate that I felt as if I was shooting in turn-based mode. Even when I played UNREAL solo, the graphics were so overblown that they detracted from my immersion rather than adding to it. By the time I got to the later levels, often felt as though I were cruising through a technology demo rather than playing a game. Although I might argue that DOOM's level designs, sense of imagination, and atmosphere made for a better game than a lot of recent 3D shooters, you can't go back-especially in this genre, which pushes all of our hardware like nothing else (with the exception of high-end flight sims). Of course, designers and programmers can point to any number of technical reasons why we have to put up with the same brain-dead Al and uninspired level designs product after product. But like most gamers, I want it all, and I'm getting tired of SHOGO 200 200 GENRE: Action RELEASE DATE: Q4 '98 DEVELOPER: Monolith Productions PUBLISHER: Monolith Productions YES, IT'S PRETTY Since the room isn't in 15 pastel shades, you can appreciate the energy blast, the iridescent explosion, and the gouts of blood all the more.

"SHOGO Anime in a Ghostshell SNEAK_PREVIEWS trictly speaking, anime is simply Japanese for animation, but the word more commonly refers to a branch of highly stylized art, Japanese in origin. Examples of anime can be found in a number of U.S. comics, in particular Spider-Man, but Japanese artists from all media, including film and TV, still account for most of anime's cutting-edge work. DE TRAIT OF WIND your Mecha) in a walled city swarming with enemies on the lookout for you. You turn your charm on the old lady manning the city gate, trying to talk her into lower ing the gate long enough for you to slip away. She'd like to help, but she's worried about her missing cat. You can either blast her away—the usual choice in a 3D shooter-or look for her cat. If you harm her, you end up facing her ex-warrior husband (hidden in the next room), who just happens to be more powerful than the big boss on the level. So, even if you take hubby out, you'll suffer tremendous damage, and the designers haven't left a bunch of power-ups conveniently near for you to heal. Then, you still have to figure out how to operate the gate, while a bunch of enemies converge on you, having heard the noise. Did I mention that the AI is way better than that of the typical action game? If you take the honorable path, as you should in anime, then you must track down the cat and return it to the old lady (so that, relieved of her worries, she opens the gate). Sounds simple, except that every time you ring the cat's favorite bell toy to call it, you run the risk of those same enemies hearing the noise and coming to investigate. To get through this level requires stealth and a cool head, as well as quick reflexes. On the flip side, SHOGO doesn't limit your moral or practical gaming choices. Just as in the original WING COMMANDER, you can fire on anyone or anything, even your compadres, provided you're willing to live with the consequences. Just for fun, I ran through my side's command center, blasting all of my buddies to that Big Animation Cel beyond. I was overjoyed to find that: a) the game had no problem with me trashing people, furniture, and even the occasional wall; and b) that my rampage didn't last very long. due to the swift and deadly response of the \"shoot them, then interrogate them\" security squad. Now, who ever heard of that in a recent action game? I could clue you in on the plot twists, spoil the surprise that the Big Bad Guy has waiting for you, or reveal all the subtleties of the later levels. But I won't, because I hate it when critics do that, and because you owe it to yourself to experience the joys of this game firsthand. Suffice it to say that the LithTech engine is the Next Big Thing, and it just happens to be wrapped around a terrific-looking game. SHOGO should support up to 32 gamers for multiplay, and even if you plan on playing it mostly solo, you need a hot machine: Anyone with less than a Pentium 200 and a Voodoo (or Voodoo-) card need not apply. As for me, I've already upgraded in anticipation of what might just be the most innovative 3D shooter since DOOM. Now, where did I put the keys for that new Mecha? CGW If you want a quick immersion into NAUSICAA anime, pick up a copy of Hayao Miyazaki's masterwork, Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind: Perfect Collection (translated by Toren Smith). It's a lot like J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings—if the good professor had grown up in Kyoto instead of England except that Miyazaki ranks as a more natural storyteller The most innovative work done in anime recently is Ghost in the Shell, a science-fiction film by CHOSTA SUELL Mamoru Oshii that blends traditional anime cel animation with the latest in comSPECIAL EDITION puter-generated art techniques.

"SNEAK_PREVIEWS NHL 99 Can EA Sports' Signature Franchise Keep Getting Better? STICK ON THE ICE, DON'T GET BEAT The action in NHL 99, especially at the All-Star level, is more intense than in past editions. of the $50 full version? OK, so that's wishful thinking. Although EA Sports makes you buy an entire new version every year (I think I still have NHL 95, 96, 97, and 98 crammed some where in the apartment-don't tell my wife), at least we get one heck of a new hockey game on time every fall-and this year is no different. by Tasos Kaiafas f you don't play sports games, consider yourself lucky. You don't have to buy a new version of your favorite game every year. If on the other hand, you're heavy into all the major North American sportsfootball, basketball, baseball, and hockey—then you probably spend $200 a year just to keep your teams, rosters, and stats current. What's the alternative-being left behind while every other sports gamer out there plays with cutting-edge technology and with the current teams and player rosters? Not much of an alternative-in fact, you could say it's not really a choice at all. Even big, bad Microsoft doesn't make us buy the whole new $200 version of Windows, just the $100 upgrade. Wouldn't it be great if we could just buy a $25 upgrade of NHL 99 instead Not Good Enough Last year, the graphics in NHL 98 amazed us. The 3D polygonal players when viewed on a 3Dfxjuiced system made many a jaw drop to the keyboard. Real text ure-mapped faces, lifelike player reactions during play stoppages, and fluid motion-captured animations brought the game to life. (Just think how far we've come since the days when developers would boast about the legibility of names on the play ers' jerseys.) The technology isn't perfect, but until the day when characters on a monitor look like real-life players on a TV screen, it's pretty good. In NHL 99, the graphical improvements are subtle but very noticeable. The EA Sports team redid all the player animations and models by motion-capturing the moves of Markus Naslund, Donald Brashear, and Mattias Ohlund of the Vancouver Canucks; Mike Sillinger of the Philadelphia Flyers; and John Vanbiesbrouck of the Florida Panthers over the course of a week at a rented ice hockey rink. Players now reach out with their sticks to pull in loose pucks, and even the goalies display a few more moves in their repertoires. Other neat visuals include ice sprays from hard stops, more arena detail, and TVlike screen transitions. The commentary, supplied by the NHL's own Jim Hughson and Daryl Reaugh, is pretty much the same as it was in NHL 98which was very good. You don't get those annoying disjointed inflection changes that so often plague the commentary in other sports games. The crowd noises are likewise as good, and some arena-specific chants have been added to this year's edition. since the graphics and sounds in EA's NHL franchise have always been as good as those of any sports game on the market. Instead, veteran hockey gamers have complained about Al and realism inconsistencies, and newbies have griped that the game has always been too difficult. The NHL 99 development team says it has addressed many of these problems and thinks it has fixed them this year. Computer-controlled teammates were one of the biggest problems in NHL 98: They didn't always react properly and were sometimes out of position. In NHL 99, some important Al enhancements make players react properly to situations like shot deflections, breaking out of your own end, neutral-zone play. odd-man rushes, and play behind the nets.

"King's Quest: Mask of Eternity SNEAK PREAVIEWS Sierra's Flagship Adventure Game Series Gets a 3D Makeover—and So Far, We Like What We See by Jeff Green hen we first took a look at KING'S QUEST: MASK OF ETERNITY, it was over two years ago at Sierra's office in Seattle, and frankly, we didn't know what to think. Sierra On-Line had long been one of the main purveyors of the traditional adventure game, and the KING'S QUEST series, begun in 1984, was one of the longest-running, bestselling series of them all. Now, however, the series' legendary designer, Roberta Williams, was starting to talk like a crazy person. The eighth game in the series, she said, was going to be a major step forward, with a 3D engine and action-style combat sequences. Remember-this was early 1996. QUAKE had yet to rear its monstrous head, Lara Croft had not yet donned her short shorts and adventure games were still d abbling with \"Hollywood-style\" FMV presentations, as in Sierra's own GABRIEL KNIGHT II and PHANTASMAGORIA. So, while Williams talked passionately about the game's new direction, we dutifully took our notes but kept thinking: Has she gone mad? If you're going to make a 3D action game, why attach the KING'S QUEST name to it? Why alienate the old fans? Now, however, it looks as though Williams' instincts were dead on. Like LucasArts' upcoming GRIM FANDANGO, KING'S QUEST: MASK OF ETERNITY is indeed going to be a huge leap, and should be a major shot in the arm for a genre that has been on its last legs creatively for over a year now. Over the last week we've been playing a beta containing the game's entire first three levels (there are seven total), and we've been able to log in enough time to tell based on firsthand play rather than marketing hype-that, barring any 13th hour catastrophes or bad decisions on Sierra's NEED BIGGER BRAIN The heart of the part-this game is going game will still involve puzzle-solving. to rock.

In fact, as I maneuvered Connor through the world-crossing streams, climbing walls, exploring hillsides-it crossed my mind that this is what MYTH would look like at ground level, rather than from a \"god view.\" Played on a P233 MMX with a 3Dfx board, the game runs smooth and looks great-instantly rendering a game like RIVEN laughably out of date.

You'll play most of the game in a TOMB RAIDER-style third-person point of view, but you can switch to a first-person perspective at any time. By holding down the right-mouse button, you can completely swivel the camera around in all directions, creating a wonderful sense of immersion-more than has ever been seen in an adventure game. The first level, set in the Daventry countryside, introduces the game's interface and gameplay, gently ramping you up with skills such as basic movement; camera manipulation; jumping; objects manipulation; and, yes, fighting. Combat is definitely a part of the game, but traditional adventure gamers can rest easy-it is not that tough, and anyone who's ever played DIABLO (which is just about everyone) should be right at home. It's your basic click-on-the-enemyuntil-he's-dead stuff. Fighting can be set on one of three levels, and on the medium-level setting I felt suitably challenged-dying a couple of times-but not frustrated. The designers have also added a rudimentary \"role-playing\" aspect to the game in the form of an experience bar that fills up as you defeat enemies. When the bar maxes out, you rise a level and your weapon skill grows stronger. It's a surprisingly nice touchgiving you another goal to focus on, another way to progress your advancement through the game. Overall, despite the huge changes in gameplay expectations that MASK OF ETERNITY is asking of adventure gamers, the balance and design is such that by the time you move on to the game's second major area, the City of the Dead, you should be completely at home with all the necessary skills. You'll probably be having a lot of fun, too.

SNEAK PREVIEWS ROCKETS AWAY The P-47D \"Jug\" is well suited to ground attack missions, thanks to its large payload capacity and rugged air-cooled engine. Combat Flight Simulator Microsoft's FLIGHT SIMULATOR Goes to War paign in Europe starting around 1943. Flyable aircraft during the Battle of Britain include the Messerschmitt Bf-109E, Spitfire Mk I, and Hurricane. Late war scenarios put you in the cockpit of a Spitfire Mk IX, P-51D Mustang, Pleast 14 other plane types present, from bombers to buzz bombs, which operate only under computer control. Mission objectives vary depending on the phase of the war and whether you fly for the Axis or Allies. Overall, a good mix of airto-air and air-to-ground action is provided against a variety of targets. Although the missions are There Is No \"Try\" Each time period has its own campaign, which consists merely of a linear sequence of canned missions. Unfortunately, you must win every mission to progresssurvival alone is not enough. The designers feel this approach strikes a good balance between ease of advancement and the ability to resurrect your pilot after dying, but in practice it is downright annoying. In addition to the campaigns, the game features 16 interactive training flights, 25 single missions, instant action dogfights, multiplayer team deathmatches (with no Al planes), and a peaceful free-flight mode straight out of FS98. The focus of the game is on what happens in the air, so preflight activities are kept to a minimum. After reading a short briefing, checking your route (which cannot be edited) on a large-scale map, and optionally changing your aircraft type, weapons load, and fuel percentage, you are transported into the pilot's seat. Cockpit instrumentation is reali stic in both form and function, with each type of plane having its own appearance and layout, right down to the units displayed (meters and km/h for German planes, feet and mph for the rest). Covering all bases, the sim supports three different cockpit view systems: AIR WARRIOR-style overlapping fixed views, a freepanning virtual cockpit mode, and an auto-tracking padlock view. The first two work well, but the padlock view's ability to lock onto targets through the floor of your plane makes it disorienting to use. For those having trouble maintaining situational awareness in dogfights, up to three artificial aids can be toggled on, including an overhead \"radar\" display showing the locations of nearby aircraft, an onscreen pointer toward the nearest threat, and textual plane type by Robin G. Kim rom its title, a cynic might suspect that Microsoft's upcoming COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR (CFS) is just FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 (FS98) with guns. After putting in some stick time with a mature beta version of CFS, I found that characterization to be not completely off the mark. Current FS98 fans should feel right at home in CFS—until the shooting starts, that is. Then it becomes clear that despite the strong family resemblance, more went into developing this WWII air combat sim than simply strapping .50 calibers onto the planes' wings. Combat missions in CFS occur in two separate periods: the pivotal Battle of Britain in 1940 and the Allies' strategic bombing camFocke-Wulf FW190A8-all hot rods compared to the older fighters.

Painted Land The view of the terrain below from the cockpit is nearly photorealistic at altitude, with impressive visibility ranges at the higher detail settings. However, like any other sim that plasters real-world images onto polygonal terrain, the effect is lost at lower heights. This one manages to look great down to around 1,000 feet, getting progressively more blurry (or pixelated, on PCs without 3D accelerators) below that. The landscape is made up of relatively few polygons in favor of framerate, giving the rare mountainous areas in the sim a distinctly blocky look. Based on the performance of the beta version, a good 3D card will be necessary to access higher resolutions even with a P11/400, but it should provide acceptable 640x480 framerates on mid-range PCs. Without a 3D card, you may need a very fast CPU just to run well with the minimum graphical detail. CFS features a complex flight model with excellent feel. It effectively simulates a variety of aerodynamic effects, such as accelerated (high-speed) stalls, spins, pitch trim variations, and the torque effects characteristic of these high-powered warbirds. Performance and landing characteristics of different aircraft types also vary in a convincing manner. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "

At first, Germany attempt ed to negotiate a settlement with the British Empire in an effort to avert further armed confrontation When he realized that a diplomatic solution to the crisis was out of the question, Hitler decided that the Wehrmacht would set about planning the invasion of Great Britain. As Hitler reasoned, once the British were defeated, he could turn his invincible war machine to the east, where it could be unleashed against what he believed to be a far greater threat: the Soviet Union. As German strategists pointed out, an amphibious invasion could be attempted only if the Luftwaffe could first sweep the skies clear of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and lay waste to much of the Royal Navy. thereby achieving air superiority over the English Channel and the proposed landing sites. On July 16, after dallying for several weeks to consider the situation, Hitler signed Directive No. 16: Seelwe (Operation Sea Lion), the intended invasion of England.

"North vs. South When I-Magic Comes Marching Home Again SNEAK PREVIEWS are orga by Marc Dultz nquestionably, the darkest chapter in the annals of American history transpired more than 130 years ago when the South sought its independence from the North in the fateful struggle known as the American Civil War. Initially arising over the issue of slavery, the brutal War Between the States would eventually pit brother against brother, American against fellow American in a ruinous conflict that would take five long years to resolve. When it was over, hundreds of thousands lay dead, over a million more were injured or permanently scarred, and a courageous president Abraham Lincoln, had been assassinated. In NORTH VS. SOUTH: THE EASTERN CAMPAIGNS OF THE CIVIL WAR, Interactive Magic revisits the topic of one of its earlier games. NORTH VS. SOUTH, however, has little in common with AMERICAN CIVIL WAR other than the epic subject matter. More Great Battles-Sort of With the release earlier this year of THE GREAT BATTLES OF JULIUS CAESAR, I-Magic had fulfilled its contractual obligations with Erudite Software to bring the critically acclaimed GMT-designed boardgame series to the PC. However, even as the game hit the retail channel, rumors began to give rise to increasing speculation that I-Magic wasn't ready to retire its eminently playable, if somewhat dated, game engine. As it turns out and the company confirmed these reports only recently-I-Magic had indeed struck a new deal with Erudite to develop a new game that, this time around, doesn't trace its roots to a boardgame. In NORTH VS. SOUTH, Erudite Software has crafted an all-new, turn-based operational-level wargame that steps out of the age of antiquity and onto the bloodied battlefields of American lore. Although the game stylistically portrays several of the most monumental battles waged in the Eastern Theatre of Operations during the American Civil War, the system triumphantly captures the tempo and intensity of massed firefights and the incredibly chaotic nature of 19thcentury warfare. All of the battles portrayed in the game follow a standard format. Each hex represents approximately 300 meters of terrain, while each game turn equals about one hour of realtime. Units are organized at the brigade level, with each brigade containing roughly 1,000 to 3,000 men. In certain respects, NORTH VS. SOUTH is similar to the GREAT BATTLES trilogy: Every unit will be rendered in 3D and will feature fully animated effects that include marching, charging, firing, and routing actions. Cavalry will be able to fight and move from either a mounted or dismounted position. Infantry and cavalry will be able to deploy into various close-order formations, such as column and line configurations, while artillery will transition from a towed to an unlimbered state. Shoulder Arms Gone are the swords, shields, and spears that epitomized ancient combat and, by default. the GREAT BATTLES series. In NORTH VS. SOUTH, infantry units are armed with muskets, muzzleloading rifles, or breech-loading rifles, while cavalry units are armed with an assortment of repeating carbines and rifles. Several types of artillery are modeled, including short-barreled howitzers for close-range supporting fire, and smoothbores or rifled guns for long-range bombardment. In fact, rifled artillery can fire out to a distance of seven hexes, making them extremely potent weapons. \"The Civil War battle mechanics employ a totally new combat system to make firepower the major cause of hits, comments designer Craig Taylor as he explains the many refinements made to the original game engine. \"A good bayonet or cavalry charge is just the thing to sweep a shot-up enemy from the field. However, charging prematurely can result in Bloody Antietam he Battle of Antietam-fought near Antietam Creek, at the town of Sharpsburg, Maryland-stands as the single bloodiest day in the annals of American history, costing some 20,000 men their lives and wounding tens of thousands more. The ensuing stalemate allowed General Robert E. Lee to extricate his imperiled forces from Maryland to Virginia, where they could be used to mount a second invasion of the North just one year later. This zoomed-out view shows Lee's units with their backs to the river, defending the town of Sharpsburg. A normal view shows Lee, mounted atop a white steed, west of Sharpsburg, making last-minute arrangements to repulse the Union onslaught. Zooming in along the western edge of the Confederate position, we can see men from two North Carolina regiments making preparations to defend \"Bloody Lane.\" General A.P. Hill dispatches his forces to defend the lower bridge while keeping a close eye on Snavely's Ford. In the game, Burnside's troops can ford the creek at its shallowest point. With more than 80,000 Federal troops at his command just west of Boonsboro Pike, Union General McClellan prepares to evict Lee from Maryland. 106 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"SNEAK PREVIEWS CIRCLE THE WAGONS! The proximity of ammunition wagons plays an especially important role in determining the relative strength of each unit. each point representing a battle that is connected to other specific points. Winning a battle will allow the player to select a connected point, which will then initiate the next battle. Therefore, it's possible, during the campaign, to fight some battles more than once and not fight others.\" Campaign games can vary in length determined by your level of success. For the Union, the campaign ends with the capture of Richmond; for the Confederacy. victory comes if it can manage to seize Washington, D.C. The game will also posit certain hypothetical events, such as \"What if General Joe Johnston and his army had stayed in the Shenandoah Valley during the First Battle of Bull Run?\" In the case of Antietam, Union General Ambrose Burnside learns that his forces can indeed ford Antietam Creek, and therefore they need not make a costly frontal assault against the heavily defended bridges to the east of Sharpsburg. Even treacherous night moves will be depicted, if the situation warrants. In all, more than 20 scenarios will be included, playable from either the Union or Confederate side. LONGSTREET'S DILEMMA Highlighted hexes determine where appear as separate figures all the way down to the divisional level. a painful clock-cleaning for the attacker.\" Since a unit's combat range and rate of fire is much greater, far more reactive and defensive fire will occur each turn in NORTH VS. SOUTH than in earlier games using this engine. In order to sustain fire, however, players must strive to position their allimportant supply wagons as close to the front lines as possible or risk running out of ammunition. NORTH VS. SOUTH should have a randomized reinforcement schedule, which will vary the arrival times but not necessarily the locales of follow-on forces. In addition, the system will now permit you to redeploy your forces prior to battle within certain predefined zones. This should enhance not only playability, but multiplayer games as well. A true line-of-sight/line-of-fire system has also been implemented that corrects for any obstructing terrain or other impediments during the sighting and combat phase. Because smoke would often obscure a battlefield, making command and control especially difficult for the typical commander, the developers were naturally compelled to somehow depict this situation in the game. Taylor discusses North vs. South how smoke has been handled: \"Although smoke could pretty well obscure a battlefield, we won't put the player through this. We don't want all the artwork hidden. Effects of this close-range obscurity are built into the combat system. The game's fog-of-war rule restricts players from seeing any parts of the map or enemy units that the line-of-sight rules do not permit their units to see.\" The command structure has been totally revised as well, and nicely reflects the sweeping organizational changes and general restructuring of armies into corps first instituted during the French Revolution. Individual phases (impulses) occur on a random basis, largely determined by which leader is in overall command. Leaders such as Robert E. Lee, Ulysses \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant, Stonewall Jackson, George Armstrong Custer, George Meade, James Longstreet, and so forth, Just Whistling Dixie? Although the build I was previewing from contained only the Battle of Antietam scenario, !-Magic has indicated that the finished product will ship with 10 stand-alone scenarios, including Gaines' Mill, First and Second Bull Run, Cedar Mountain, Brandy Station, Five Forks, The Wilderness Campaign, and Gettysburg. Even a scenario for Cedar Creek will be included, which is one of the few instances during the Civil War that a full-scale cavalry charge was actually launched. Several multiday battles will also be portrayed. In addition, NORTH VS. SOUTH will feature inde. pendent campaign games for both the Union and Confederacy. \"The campaign game consists of a series of points on the campaign map,\" comments Taylor, \"with Rebel Yell NORTH VS. SOUTH, much like the GREAT BATTLES trilogy, will feature full multiplayer support (modem, hotseat, LAN, and Internet connections). It's not clear whether or not several players will be able to split up into opposing teams, whereby one player on each team acts as overall field commander-instructing their subordinates when and where to commit their forceswhile divisional commanders set about engaging the enemy. What is certain, however, is that NORTH VS. SOUTH has all the makings of a classic wargame. And with a veteran game designer leading the charge and a powerful gaming engine under the hood, this is certainly one Civil War reenactment you won't want to miss.

"SNEAK PREVIEWS VR Baseball 2000: Next Generation Baseball VR Sports Sneaks in With a Great-looking New Baseball Game by Tasos Kaiafas he 1998 Major League Baseball season is undeniably one of the most exciting in years. The names McGwire and Sosa have been as per vasive in the press as Clinton and Lewinsky, and fans around the country are responding by revisiting their local ballparks. Unfortunately, the resurgent excitement of this year's Major League Baseball season has not permeated this year's crop of baseball games. Mediocrity at best is how most baseball gamers would describe what they've seen so far. But the year's not over yet, and there's one more game that's still in the on-deck circle. closer attention, so they've been urging baseball game publishers to hold off on the release of their games until then. That's what they told VR Sports, anyway. So the folks at VR Sports figured that since they needed time to convert the PlayStation's VR BASEBALL 99 over to Shiny's (a sister division of Interplay) MESSIAH 3D engine, they'd oblige. The result is the PC-exclusive VR BASEBALL 2000: NEXT GENERATION BASEBALL. We'll have to wait to see the consequences of this delayed release date, but the results of the extra development time and the conversion to the MESSIAH engine look good—very good. With the MESSIAH engine, Shiny (the makers of MDK) has developed a 3D engine that renders characters with more natural movement, by allowing \"skin\" to stretch when body parts turn and move. When a player moves his arms or upper body, you can see the letters on the front of his uniform move as well. There are other performanceenhancement features in the MESSIAH engine, but the end result is one of the best-looking baseball games to come around in a long time. Although there are still some niggling animation oddities in the early version of the game we're playing, we hope they'll be ironed out before it hits store shelves. If they are, this could be the first baseball game to bat over .300 this year. Looks Aren't the Only Thing Of course, the look of the game isn't the only reason we have such high hopes for VR BASEBALL 2000—it also plays as well as any computer baseball title we've tried so far. VR Sports seems to have gone to great lengths to ensure a substantial amount of realism on the field. Unlike in most other baseball games, there is the requisite number of foul balls, pitches are easy to read, and fielders are easy to handle. Fielding assistance can be set on a scale TOUS MM DICURE The Postseason Advantage Maybe it's not so important to release your baseball game at the start of the baseball season. Common sense would tell you that baseball gamers want to start their virtual seasons at the same time as Major Leaguers. But according to Major League Baseball, the postseason is when many casual baseball fans start to pay wiwi th VR Baseball 2000: Next Generation Baseball GENRE: Sports RELEASE DATE: 04 '98 DEVELOPER: VR Sports PUBLISHER: Interplay Productions THE HEAT IS ON VR BASEBALL 2000's pitcher/batter interface is intuitive and easy to use without sacrificing any of the game's realism and strategy. 110 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"VR BASEBALL 2000: NEXT GENERATION BASEBALL ARA DM 2000 SNEAK PREVIEWS RENDER THIS VR BASEBALL 2000 uses Shiny's MESSIAH engine for what are the most realistic 3D characters yet in a baseball game. The only question we have here is, What ball game is this guy actually playing? SIDDOWN! Just about every fielding interface in every baseball game released this year sucked, especially the one from Microsoft. But VR BASEBALL 2000 looks as if it's getting it rightalong with everything else in the game. from zero to nine, which determines how long a player will head toward the location of the ball before you must take over control. Hitting can be set to arcade or simulation, with the latter requiring more input and better timing to make successful contact. Off the field, team management is pretty standard, with the typical array of statistics and screens. But the arrangement of these screens thankfully breaks the recent trend of console-type interfaces in PC sports games an unfortunate byproduct of cross-platform development. Instead of forcing you to navigate through multiple screens to get to the one you want, VR BASEBALL 2000 arranges all of your options in a familiar tabbed interface so that everything you want to do can be brought up on the same screen by clicking on the appropriate tab. true gamersto know where to shop The One to Watch It's obvious to us that there are real baseball fans making VR BASEBALL 2000.

"Redguard Swashbuckling in the ELDER SCROLLS Universe SNEAK PREVIEWS by Johnny L. Wilson he sibling rivalry ran deep. He'd killed his sister's husband and had wandered for years as an exile. Now his sister, Iszara, had disappeared. In spite of their estrangement, he feels the need to find her and find out why. The former soldier books passage on a ship, and the adventure begins. Pirates board the vessel and the action quickens to a pace feverish enough to excite the most cynical Errol Flynn fan. Using his sword in fairly close analog to the movement of your joystick-he dispatches both cutlass-wielding buc caneers before the captain of the ship can even retrieve his sword. The dark-skinned prodigal-son hero is named Cyrus; the setting is 400 years before events in THE ELDER SCROLLS: ARENA; and this is not another first-person roleplaying game with loose plot and unlimited quests to ponder. REDGUARD is a focused, challenging action/adventure that may well be what some gamers were expecting in THE ELDER SCROLLS: DAGGERFALL. In terms of genre-blending, REDGUARD may have achieved what other multigenre games can only aspire to accomplish. Somehow, you suspect that you'll need to solve some deeper mysteries before you get to rescue Iszara. As you learn about the history of this empire within the Tamriel gameworld, you sense that many of the events are converging on something called \"The Dragon,\" the proud jewel of the Imperial Crown. Apparently, this jewel had something to do with the flight of a poison arrow that HERO WORSHIP REDGUARD's protagonist is a prodigal son who has returned to an infamous port in order to rescue his sister. as restore your position within your family. killed the crown prince to whom your loyalty was pledged.

"RED GUARD SNEAK PREVIEWS RICHTON MORTIS In this cutscene, we see the infamous Lord Richton, provisional governor of Stros M'kai and, potentially, the ultimate bad guy in this saga. combat sequences, as well as conversational sequences. The pace of combat is interesting, but not overbearing. It's particularly entertaining to learn the combat interface while attempting to take on two pirates at the same time. Turn your back on one and he'll hack at your stern while you're looking to berth your bowsprit in a vital organ of the varlet in front of you. Meanwhile, you can dance away while slashing with your sword, or you can jump onto higher or lower elevations using your best possible Douglas Fairbanks maneuvers. This ability to jump pays big dividends as you near the endgame and face one of the strangest and, potentially most memorable physical logic puzzles I can remember in an adventure game. The keyboard/joystick combination also serves you well during the conversations with nonplayer characters. Like many role-playing and adventure games, REDGUARD uses a keyword system in which you cycle through words and click to ask questions based on those words. The words gray out when you've gotten all the information you can get on that subject from your interlocutor. Unlike THE ELDER SCROLLS: DAGGERFALL, where, in medieval imitation of Cheers, \"everybody knew your name\" but little else about you, the characters in REDGUARD know quite a bit-information that can fill in spaces in the story and assist you toward a satisfactory conclusion. Also, unlike in DAGGERFALL and ARENA, the conversation is all handled via voice. But if the voices don't improve sig. nificantly from the placeholders used in the alpha version, it will be a bad thing. Should the final version feature professional voices like those used in RETURN TO KRONDOR—the atmosphere of the game will significantly improve. Still, the voice-overs were not bad across the board; in fact, the placeholder voices for some of the humanoid races were as terrific as the human voices were awful. Bethesda opted to use an artificial language for these characters and subtitle the translations onscreen The results ooze with ambience and provide by far the most interesting and entertaining conversations in the game. As with any keyword system, you can interrogate the nonplayer characters for as much or as little information as you want. There is a limited database of responses due to the use of voiceover, but the conversations are positively sparkling compared to those in REDGUARD's older siblings. ZORRO'S GHOST? Cyrus takes on multiple opponents in this tavern brawl at the Dragon's Tale. REDGUARD may be second only to The Mask of Zorro as 1998's Swashbuckler of the Year Show Me What You've Got The stores in REDGUARD are handled within the gameworld's 3D environment. The game displays a store's inventory as items on a shelf, and you get the option of examining these items as you traverse the interior. If you opt to buy the items, you'll click into a conversation with the shopkeeper or bartender and initiate a conversational sequence in which your transaction will be completed. The process maintains the sense of suspended disbelief in the game environment by keeping the same visual metaphor for all activities. if you talk to enough people in the city of Stros M'kai, you'll eventually find out about the Dwarven Ruins. Lord Richton, the provincial governor and a key player in the assassination of the crown prince, has been doing a lot of archaeological work in those ruins; and as Cyrus, you need desperately to find out what he's up to. If Cyrus is successful, this will lead to a marvelous puzzle. Eventually, you'll be faced with a huge, quasiAztec-looking artifact. As you begin to explore it, you'll notice that different actions cause the artifact to change shapes. Now, you have a quasi-Aztec \"Transformer\" at your disposal. Figuring out what to do with it will be fun, frustrating, and fascinating-all at the same time. I personally predict that this will be one of the most talked about puzzles in adventure-game fandom since the Babel fish. The bottom line on REDGUARD is that it is a small, relatively contained portion of the Tamriel gameworld seen in former ELDER SCROLLS games. It features swashbuckling and puzzles such as we haven't seen in adventure games for years. If the voiceovers improve and the system gets more stable than it was in our version, this looks like the best product ever to come out of Bethesda's studio. In fact, it just might scare that female archaeologist we see wearing shorts on so many computer and console screens. CGW 126 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "

BUT NOT ONLY GOD CAN MAKE A TREE The new engine allows for trees that look like trees, not gigantic toothpicks. Heavy Gear II A New Engine Puts This Giant Robot Series Into High Gear aging MECHWARRIOR 2 engine. Well, Activision has finally put that engine out to pasture and rolled out its replacement in HEAVY GEAR Il; the all-new engine makes for not only a smoother gaming experience, but also some innovative new gameplay elements. HEAVY GEAR II takes place after trees. Blow up a bridge and your opponents will have to wade slowly through the water-talk about sitting ducks. Force them to wade through lava and they'll take damage at every step. The Dark Side engine also allows for better-looking Gears. No more stiff animation for the Gears as in the original.

The company distributed Dynamix's original MECHWARRIOR, and then truly jump-started the genre with the release of MECHWARRIOR 2. While MECHWARRIOR: MERCENARIES had its problems, it did well building on the franchise's successes. Alas, Activision slipped off its pedestal with the release of HEAVY GEAR. After losing the BattleTech license, the company picked up the Heavy Gear license from Dream Pod 9 and cranked out HEAVY GEAR. Unfortunately, HEAVY GEAR was burdened with design problems and bugs that stemmed from its overuse of the came game's predecessor. While North and South were locked in arms against each other, Earth decided to come knocking down Terra Nova's door.

"STAR WARS GAMES As LucasArts Readies Games Based on the New Films, it Sends the Classic Series Out with a Death Star-sized Bang 134 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"STAR WARS GAMES A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH ven as we draw closer to the release of one of the most anticipated movies of all time, Star Wars: Episode I, it's obvious that we just can't get enough of the original Star Wars. George Lucas and his game gurus at LucasArts seem to know that which is why they're readying two new Star Wars gaming titles to feed our space-opera addiction. This could be the swan song for classic Star Wars games, as the other Star Wars titles in production are top-secret and are based on the upcoming Episode . The two new titles are fastaction, intense combat games that put you in the cockpits of the best fighters in the galaxy. The first game, which should debut this fall, is a shooter with great graphics, a simple interface, and loads of arcade action. It's called ROGUE SQUADRON, and it lets you don Luke Skywalker's jumpsuit to pilot X-Wings, A-Wings, and Snowspeeders against the Empire's endless hordes. The second game, which introduces a third element into the Rebel/Imperial struggle, is the main event. This is the space sim we've all been waiting for, and it should see the light of day in Spring 1999. At last, you'll get a chance to fly the Millennium Falcon in what could be the most immersive and rich Star Wars space-combat sim yet. This is one of the most exciting games we've seen all year, and we're excited to be the first to bring you news-and the first in-depth preview of this title. This preview will show you why we can't wait to fly the Falcon into the maw of the Death Star. From all we've seen, LucasArts couldn't have picked a better way to say farewell to the classic Star Wars universe. If they have to end it, they're set to do it with a bang, not a whimper. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 135 "

But before we mislead you into thinking LucasArts' next PC game is a Millennium Falcon sim, we must add that the Falcon is only the prize at the end of STAR WARS: X-WING ALLIANCE, Larry Holland and Totally Games' upcoming sequel to X-WING and TIE FIGHTER. From what we've seen of this third installment in the X-WING series, Publisher: LucasArts however, the journey will be as amazing as the prize itself. Holland, the primary creator of the X-WING series, as well as the WWII sims SECRET WEAPONS OF THE Developer: Totally Games LUFTWAFFE and THEIR FINEST HOUR, says that STAR WARS: X-WING ALLIANCE (the name is tentative, Target Release Date: Q1 '99 OLD WAR, NEW BLOOD Two-thirds of the game is classic X-WING, as you fly various ships against the Imperials, This is a new type of ship—the planetary fighter. AFTERGLOW While the engine is based on the X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER engine, the special effects, the models, and the cockpits are being completely redone. awaiting approval by Lucas Licensing) is closer to X-WING and TIE FIGHTER than to the multiplayer X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER. Where X-WING told the Star Wars story from the Rebel side, and TIE FIGHTER did the same from the Imperial side, X-WING ALLIANCE should bring a third perspective into the classic struggle: that of smuggler. The galaxy's seedy underbelly has always been a component of the Star Wars mythology. Consider Mos Eisley, the bounty hunters, Jabba the Hutt, and Han Solo's smuggling runs. Says Holland, \"We wanted to get a third perspective [on the war). There's the Empire and the Rebels, and then there are the smugglers.\" Holland and Totally Games thus complete the XWING series with X-WING ALLIANCE, a game that breathes life into that facet of Star Wars. X-WING ALLIANCE is a spacecombat sim, similar in style to its predecessors but with a story and missions that are distinctly different. You play a smuggler, deeply involved in a trading war with a rival family but also caught up in the middle of the larger Imperial/Rebel civil war. The action in the game takes place after The Empire Strikes Back and ends with events from Return of the Jedi. 130 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"STAR WARS GAMES MILLENNIUM FALCON Chapter Eight in X-WING ALLIANCE features the Battle of Endor from Return of the Jedi. You'll even get to fly the Millennium Falcon into the Death Star, The \"family business\" storyline, Return of the Jedi Meets The Godfather Plot drives the game in ALLIANCE, much more so than in TIE FIGHTER or X-WING. There are, in fact, two stories: the larger military drama we're all familiar with and a more personal tale that revolves around your character and his smuggler's background. \"The story is Return of the Jedi meets The Godfather,\" quips Holland. The military story tracks the war between the Empire and the Alliance from just after the battle on the ice planet Hoth until the final conflict in Return of the Jedi. In fact, Holland says, \"The main plot is the classic story that climaxes with the Battle of Endor. It's the climax to the movies and to this trilogy of games.\" is much less straightforward. But in many ways it is richer.\" The player is part of a trader family, in conflict with a second family. It's sort of a Mafia setup,\" says Holland. Your character is part of the Ozzameen family, principal rivals of the Viraxo family. Both families engage in legal trading and not-so-legal smuggling. D uring the course of the game you'll run contraband for the Ozzameen in the midst of the civil war. You'll also undertake missions for your family that drive the house rivalry story. As with all things Star Wars, both families will have no choice but to be dragged into the all-consuming conflict between Empire and Alliance, and the story will focus on how each family relates to the two sides. You can guess which force your family sides with, but there will be questions and indecision about which would be best to support. There will be several plot twists, but if you're successful in the family business missions, you'll put an end to the Viraxo family's encroachment X-WING ALLIANCE seems to tie into the classic Star Wars movies and books even more than previous Star Wars games did. Holland wouldn't comment on all the tieins, but Black Sun and Prince Xizor will appear in the family portions of the game. For those who haven't read the Shadows of the Empire novel and comic books, Prince Xizor is Darth Vader's chief rival and the leader of Black Sun, the most powerful criminal organiz ation in the galaxy. Jabba's holdi ngs are just a drop in the bucket for Xizor. As members of the criminal underground, your family and the Viraxo inevitably have to deal with Black Sun, although Holland wouldn't elaborate on how Black Sun will figure into the game. During the military story, you'll meet up with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Lando Calrissian, and Dash Rendar (another character from Shadows of the Empire). You'll recall that in TIE FIGHTER you got to fly with Darth Vader. In X-WING ALLIANCE, there is at least one mission in which you'll fly with Luke. Holland wouldn't say whether you'll get to fly with the other characters, but they will all www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 137 "

"SWPS figure into the game's dual story lines-some characters more than others. And you can bet some famous bounty hunters will show up. Again, Holland was coy about who those bounty hunters might be, but since this game has a healthy dose of smuggling, expect the same troubles that Han Solo encountered. begins with you running several smuggling missions for the Ozzameen. Right away you'll be roped into the intrigue and mysteries of the family business and be Introduced to several characters who will stay with you throughout the game: your sister and your sidekick droid. Your sister will fly a few missions with you and will play a pivotal role in the ongoing plot. Your droid is your co-pilot (Chewbacca to your Han Solo), and it's a wisecracking one, with plenty of information to throw your way when you need it. MARRIED TO THE MOB Smuggling missions for your Mafia-like family business take up one-third of the game. During these missions, you'll pilot the family transport, a cousin to the Millennium Falcon. Mission Briefings Like its predecessors, X-WING ALLIANCE is mission-based, but with the addition of family business and smuggling missions to complement the military ones. There are 50 missions broken into eight chapters. The most exciting prospect is that Chapter Eight will be a full re-creation of the Battle of Endor. You'll actually be able to fly in that famous conflict, when the Rebels tried to attack an incomplete Death Star only to find that it was fully operational. Reeling from the trap, Admiral Ackbar, the Rebel commander, wanted to flee, but Lando Calrissian pleaded with him to maintain the mission. You'll get to reenact that battle from the first hyperspace jump to the final run into the tunnel. Chapter Eight will thus encompass several missions, ending with the final run against the Death Star. You'll get to give Lando the boot and pilot the Millennium Falcon into the Death Star with Wedge Antilles. Although we've already seen what happens in the movie, Holland points out that the size of the Death Star is so great that there is much we haven't seen. He assures us that \"there will be a lot of surprises in the tunnel run.\" Just thinking about being in an interactive Battle of Endor is exciting. The game will feature sights and sounds from the movie, and the battle should provide a thrilling conclusion to ALLIANCE. Says Holland, \"The whole sequence will be a spectacular climax.\" However, that is the last chapter. Before that you'll have to play through seven chapters of smuggling intrigue and Imperial-versusRebel confrontations. The game PRICE OF POWER In LucasArts' latest Star Wars sim, you aren't flying for the Rebels or for the Empire-but for the money. Family Business Holland is mindful of the fact that some players just want to jump into the action and start shooting TIE Fighters. For those gamers, the family business storyline might not hold any interest. Thus, Holland plans to make that part of the game optional. Of the 50-plus missions slated for X-WING ALLIANCE, some two-thirds are military-based, while the remainder are family business missions. But if that plot is optional, why play it? Holland is trying to make the story interesting and the missions so different that players will gravitate to it. Plus, if you skip the family business missions, you'll miss out on story information during the military track. The type of missions you fly will be very different for the family business. There will be smuggling trips, rescue operations, s tealth, and blockade-running missions. Says Holland, \"[The family business gameplay) is a new type of game element. It will be compelling enough and different enough to make people play it.\" The game design starts you on the family business track to give you a taste of how different and engrossing it can be. So, even if you decide to bypass the rest of those missions, you'll start with a vested interest in the family business because you'll be several missions into that portion before you get pulled into the conflict between Imperials and Rebels. If you still choose to bypass the family missions, they won't just go TOUGH ON DEFENSE This is a defensive platform, just one of the many active objects, ships, and stations that promise to make the 50 missions in X-WING ALLIANCE come to life. 140 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"VI JUST LIKE SHOOTING WOMPRATS When flying your family transport (or the Falcon) against enemy ships, you'll have to man the laser turrets (shown here on the bottom of the transport). GATHER TOGETHER NOW During the military portions of X-WING ALLIANCE, you'll receive formal mission briefings. Family business missions are received via holo message. INSIDE VIEW Flying the Millennium Falcon is different from piloting other ships: You've got to remember when you're flying through tight spaces that the bulk of the ship is on your left. away. Along the way you'll be told that your family needs you for a certain task. You'll have a deadline to make your decision on whether or not to help. If you ignore the request in a few days you'll get a message telling you the outcome of the mission. If you choose to help, you start that family mission. The family business missions will be smuggling-oriented. You'll have to evade Imperial fighters and break blockades while moving contraband about the galaxy However, Holland says it won't be in the style of PRIVATEER: \"This is not an open-ended trading game.\" The focus is still combat, so even when you fly seemingly boring missions to drop off cargo, you can bet there will be violent surprises waiting in each mission. \"There is lots of combat-more combat than flying and dropping something off,\" laughs Holland. When you play the military missions, you'll get more conventional missions, of the type you've seen in X-WING, TIE FIGHTER, and X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER. There will be escorts, dogfights, bombing runs, search and destroy, cargo ID, and a full gamut of military scenarios. do your business, and then hyperspace back home. Now in every mission there will be four regions that you can fly back and forth between. They could be different sectors of space, different planets, or different orbits around a planet. Hyperspace will now be functional, rather than just a mini-cut-scene. When you want to jump to another sector, you'll have to find a nav buoy and make the hyperspace jump, whereupon your cockpit will be showered with streaking stars, just like in the movies. On a family business mission, for instance, you might have to hyperspace to planet A, pick up your cargo, go to planet B to drop it off, head to planet C to pick up payment, and proceed on the way home through region D, where you'll get ambushed by Viraxo fighters. Military missions could also be multipart. For instance, you might have to hyperspace to intercept an enemy fleet, use lasers to take down an enemy frigate's shields, and then hyperspace back to your base to pick up torpedoes to destroy it. Or, instead of switching weapons, you might be able to return to base and switch to a Y-Wing bomber after your X-Wing wipes out the frigate's shields. Imagine changing ships in midmission to suit the changing obiectives. However, because all four regions in a mission progress simultaneously, you have to be prepared for the fact that the enemy might have repaired its shields by the time you return. The new setup for missions creates the sense of a dynamic, living galaxy. Now, while you're off in sector A doing business, things are happening in the other sectors. Some missions will give you choices of what to do. You might be flying an intercept mission for the military when you get a distress call to help your family. You could either hyperspace to the military target at point B or abandon the objective and hyperspace to point C to help your family. You won't be able to do both because the dogfight and your family's business will occur at the same time but in two different spaces. Says Holland, \"You can decide to save the fleet or save your family, so you have to make a choice. By having four sectors, we can offer multiple goals and choice of goals.\" Holland says he is considering just how independent to make each sector. \"We're aware of timing problems. We want the player to be pivotal in the combat, but we don't want the activity to stop when he isn't there.\" So expect the regions to have simultaneous action, and for events to move along even when the gamer isn't present. Wherever your character is, that region will have paramount importance. article, so you're probably wondering what ships you get to fly. During the family missions, you will fly a modified Corellian transport. (The Millennium Falcon is a Corellian transport.) It doesn't look exactly like the Falcon, but you can see the \"family resemblance. The ship is thicker and the cockpit is centered (the Falcon's cockpit is on the right side of the ship). Unlike Han Solo (who modified the Millennium Falcon extensively), you won't get to tinker with your family transport (too bad). Over the course of the game, however, your ship will receive slight upgrades. During the military mission, you'll be able to fly whatever ship suits the mission: X-Wings, A-Wings, Y-Wings, and perhaps other ships. So, when do you get to fly the Millennium Falcon? Well, not until the climactic Chapter Eight and the final famous tunnel run through the innards of the Death Star. The normal fighters will fly as they have done in previous games (the flight model is not changi ng at all, except that you'll now be able to move in reverse), but the family transport and the Millennium Falcon will definitely fly differently. Both will be fast and maneuverable. However, they aren't fighters, so when you fight, you'll have to jump to the ships' turrets, which look almost exactly like the laser turrets that Han and Luke manned on the Four Times the Fun What will really make the X-WING ALLIANCE missions stand out, though, is their scope. In earlier games, you would make a hyperspace jump to a location, Ship Ahoy We alluded to the Millennium Falcon in the beginning of this 44 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"TARWARSGAMES Falcon in the movies. You'll aim the twin laser cannons and blast at TIE Fighters and other enemy ships chasing you. X-WING and TIE FIGHTER had good wingmen commands, but their capabilities are being expanded for X-WING ALLIANCE. We didn't see the improved wingmen interface, but Holland says it will be more intuitive, similar to the unit commands in BATTLEZONE. HOW'S IT HANGING The immersion is even deeper in X-WING ALLIANCE. Your ship selection and weapons loadouts are now done in a Calamari cruiser hangar. The Immersive Factor One of the biggest appeals of TIE FIGHTER was the immersiveness of the game. When you played TIE FIGHTER, the story and missions made you feel as though you were really in the Imperial Navy and part of the Star Wars universe. X-WING ALLIANCE takes that feeling a huge step further. Now, more of the nonflight portions of the game will take place in the game engine. For instance, your ship selection, weapons loading, and mission briefings take place inside a hangar aboard your family's personal Mon Calamari cruiser. The hangar and all the ships inside are rendered in realtime with the game's engine. That will enable Totally Games to create ambient motion and action in that game screen. So while you're choosing which ship to fly, pilots might walk across the hangar, ships might fly in and out, droids might be lowered into X-Wings. And when you pick a payload for your fighter, you'll see technicians wheeling the ammo to install on your ship. To get family missions, you'll enter your room in crew quarters and receive messages from your family. These will update periodically to give you the sense that things are happening even when you're otherwise occupied. The optional family missions will appear as holo messages (think Princess Leia's plea to Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars). During missions, there will be scripted events that will help make the universe come alive. You'll fly by drydocks where ships are being repaired, zoom past cruisers and frigates as they hyperspace to other locations, pass factories and processing plants churning out goods, and watch freighter tubs being linked together into trains. In one mission, you'll even see zero-G storm troopers swarming out of a troop transport to invade a friendly ship. Holland says that X-WING ALLIANCE will be able to pump out twice the number of ships per scene as X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER. There could be literally hundreds of ships and objects moving around each location. In essence, each mission will have activity and life to provide the illusion that this universe is real. The scripts and greater scene complexity will be vital if Totally Games really wants to pull off the interactive Battle of Endor for Chapter Eight. Hopefully, they'll succeed and make that final chapter as frenetic as it looked in the movie. There were swarms of ships in those space battles in Return of the Jedi, but Holland is confident that he can re-create the entire s equence on computer and make it even more visceral. enveloping you with the experience via scripted events, sights, and sounds. Speaking of sights and sounds, X-WING ALLIANCE will support 3D positional audio, as well as 3D graphics accelerators via Direct3D. There will be Redbook audio, but also context-sensitive music to heighten the suspense and action. It was disappointing to discover that Totally Games is using a retooled X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER engine, but Holland says that the old cockpits have been thrown out and new 3D virtual cockpits added. The turret cockpits in the Falcon and family transport will also have transparencies so you can see the ships as they pass by your guns and your meshlike cockpit. In addition, all the special effects and models have been completely redone, and every thing has been retextured. Holland claims that the in-game objects will be doubled in complexity. We hope he can do at least that much, especially since WING COMMANDER PROPHECY and DESCENT: FREESPACE have raised the bar on graphics so high for this genre; gamers might not be so forgiving of a dated look. But Holland says he understands the need to pay careful attention to graphics and insists the engine will be live up to people's expectations. Totally Games and LucasArts definitely have their work cut out for them if they hope to release X-WING ALLIANCE before the Star Wars film prequel hits theaters in mid-May. (To release the game after that might be too confusing for consumers, who'd face a classic Star Wars game mixed in with prequel film merchandise.) Holland's design specs are ambitious, but they signal a return to what made TIE FIGHTER so great. Not only that, but the mission designs-with the multiple regions, simultaneous action, mission choices, and dynamic objectives and the unprecedented immersion and fascinating story just might make this game better than the five-star TIE FIGHTER. And the mere thought of piloting the Millennium Falcon into the Death Star and pulling the trigger on the core elicits nearly uncontainable anticipation from this Star Wars fan. X-Wing vs. TE Fighter vs. Millennium Falcon? TAR WARS: X-WING ALLIANCE will ship with a multiplayer component (no word yet on whether you can fly the Falcon during dogfights). There will be about 10-15 multiplayer missions, as well as a mission creator that lets you specify the type of enemies, number of ships, and other options, and then hop into a quick user-defined game. Actual multiplayer matches will also take place in the new four-part levels, which should make for some interesting cat-and-mouse chases through hyperspace. 148 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"STAR WARS GAMES Rogue Squadron Shadows of the Empire: The \"Good Parts\" Version by Elliott Chin wo years ago, to help inaugurate the Nintendo 64, LucasArts launched SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE with great fanfare, including a novel, comic books, and the N64 game itself. Later, a PC port was made. But despite the huge push by LucasArts, SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE was only a moderate success. Of all the half-dozen game types in SHADOWS, the first level, in which you piloted a snowspeeder in an open area on Hoth, was the most fun. Although the feel was definitely arcadish (it wasn't a sim), it was exciting to pilot a snowspeeder over the expanse of iceand snow-covered hills while blasting at Imperial probe droids and tripping up AT-ATs with a harpoon cable. When the folks at LucasArts decided to create a follow-up to SHADOWS, they looked at what worked and what didn't. In the process, they jettisoned everything else about the game and decided to create a new game that Publisher: LucasArts would play like the SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE Hoth sequence. In essence, they turned the Hoth level into a full game. That game has become ROGUE SQUADRON, an all-new Star Wars title that will be Developer: Factor 5 Target Release Date: 04 98 released simultaneously this holiday season for both the Nintendo 64 and the PC. WHERE IS EVERYBODY? Those gamers who played the Hoth levels in SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE will find ROGUE SQUADRON very familiar. GIMME THOSE WIDE-OPEN SPACES In ROGUE SQUADRON, you'll fly in arenas six times larger than those in SHADOWS. This game isn't on rails. FIVE BY FIVE The action is intense, with an arcade physics model. You have health, but also extra lives, as in other arcade-style games. the full flames of revolt is up to you and the Rogue Squadron. Rogue's Gallery ROGUE SQUADRON is named after the X-Wing pilots made famous in the Star Wars movies and embellished in many official comic books and novels. The team is an assembly of the greatest hotshot pilots in the Rebellion. The action in ROGUE SQUADRON takes place between Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, and fills in that period of time for Luke Skywalker. Since he didn't start on his Jedi training until The Empire Strikes Back, what was he doing? Well, we at least know that he was an ace pilot; Brett Tosti, ROGUE SQUADRON producer, says it's conceivable that Luke spent that time flying for Rogue Squadron on behalf of the Alliance. In ROGUE SQUADRON, you get to play Luke Skywalker, and you'll pilot not only his X-Wing but a host of other Rebel craft as well. Tosti says that ROGUE SQUADRON will be actionintensive, but the game will also have a story that spins out over the course of eight chapters. The story will track the progress of Rogue Squadron during those critical months just after the destruction of the first Death Star, when a spark of hope was lit for the Rebellion. Whether that spark can be fanned into Red Leader to Red One You'll fly through 16 missions, divided among 14 classic Star Wars locales. The locations will be as varied as in the films, and terrain will run the gamut from forests to deserts to ocean surfaces to snowy plains. These environments will be sprinkled over a collection of Star Wars planets, including Tatooine, Endor, and Mon Calamari. There is also an ice planet that may or may not be Hoth (the Hoth scenario is unlikely, since ROGUE SQUADRON takes place before The Empire Strikes Back). Another level will put you in an environment not unlike Bespin, the action occurring against the backdrop of a city floating amid orange clouds. One thing ROGUE SQUADRON will not have is spaceborne missions. Even though you'll fly an X-Wing at times, none of the action takes place in space. Tosti says it is easy enough to do, but they opted for ground missions, as in the Hoth sequence of SHADOWS. This makes not only for more interesting and varied environments, but also for a bigger variety of enemies and objectives. 152 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"STAR WARS GAMES All the levels, though, are freeflowing. You aren't flying on rails, but instead have the ability to soar around your surroundings. There will be a limit to the size of a level, though, so don't be surprised if automatic controls steer you back into the allowable arena if you start zooming toward no-man's land. This mechanic was in SHADOWS and it wasn't very intrusive, although it remains to be seen whether gamers weaned exclusively on PC games can get used to it. The levels themselves in ROGUE SQUADRON will be six times as large as those in SHADOWS, so there will be plenty of space to fly around in. Mission objectives in ROGUE SQUADRON will be more complex than those in SHADOWS and will require flying to certain locations or around big areas. Terrain won't be boring and flat; there will be plenty of hills, canyons, trees, trenches, and other natural formations. There will also be man-made objects, such as shield generators, idle troop transports, and landing pads. Some levels will also sport nice doodads to spice up the terrain. The Tatooine level, for instance, has Jabba's palace on a hill, while Krayt Dragon skeletons lay half-buried in the sand. All the missions will have primary and secondary objectives that will pop up during the course of the action. Each mission opens with a brief cut-scene, which is rendered by the game engine, that sets up the action, and then it's time to get busy. For example, you might see a Tyderian shuttle lifting off from a shuttle bay and then start the scenario by flying by the shuttle as you attempt to escort it from harm's way. The mission variation is fairly extensive. There will be rescue missions, search-and-destroy missions, and surgical-strike missions. Plus, your objectives may change as the mission wears on. In one instance, you might have to fly toward a shield generator to disable it for an incoming troop transport, and once that objective is complete, (TOP) STAY ON TARGET This Y-Wing is good for bombing runs. Mission objectives vary, and will include escort, search and destroy, rescue, and heavy-duty bombing missions. (MIDDLE) WATCH YOUR SIX As an arcade shooter, ROGUE SQUADRON throws a variety of enemies at you in great numbers. You'll face plenty of ground targets as well as various TIE aircraft. (BOTTOM) LOW TO THE GROUND Each of the standard five ships in ROGUE SQUADRON (as well as the secret ones) has its own flight model. The speeder is highly maneuverable, but hugs the ground. have to wait until the final product ships to see how involved the wingmen actually will be you'll be called upon to provide air support against a surprise attack by TIE Fighters. Moreover, your progress in a mission will be recorded, and you'll be able to replay missions to get better results. Depending on your grade, you'll get commendations, rank increases, and, possibly. access to secret levels and ships. Don't be surprised if some very powerful and very interesting spaceships become available if you keep acing the missions. When other ships become available to you, you can replay earlier missions with the new craft. For instance, you might start on an ice level with only the snowspeeder, but once you acquire the X-Wing, later in the game, you might want to retry the ice level to see how the AT-ATs deal with your new, improved ship. During missions, you'll get to fly with Rogue Squadron wingmen, and they won't always be cannon fodder. Sometimes you'll have different objectives. You might have to provide escort while your V-Wing buddy has to destroy a power generator. But if you fail to protect him, you'll have to take down the generator with your weaker X-Wing. As for taking down the enemies, though, don't rely on your wingmen too much. As we understand it, you will conduct most of the action. We'll just Ship Shape While SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE let you fly only the snowspeeder, in ROGUE SQUADRON you'll be able to try your hand at several ships. You can fly the X-Wing, which is a good all-purpose craft; the A-Wing, which is a highly maneuverable and fast air-to-air interceptor; a Y-Wing bomber, which has powerful air-to-ground attacks; the speeder hovercraft, which also has a good ground attack as well as anti-AT-AT weaponry; and the experimental V-Wing, which is a prototype craft hinted at in Star Wars books. We'll have to wait for the game to learn its capabilities. There will also be a few more secret ships, but LucasArts is currently keeping quiet about them. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 153 "

"walkers, AT-ATs, shuttles, tanks, and missileand laser-turrets. Each of the craft will have its idiosyncrasies. The A-Wing will be fast and maneuverable, while the Y-Wing will be ponderous and slow. The X-Wing will be able to achieve high altitudes; the speeder will hug the ground. Individual ships will be better suited for certain missions. For instance, if you were making a bombing run, you might want to pick the Y-Wing, but if you were flying escort for the bomber, you might pick the A-Wing. Each ship will be equipped with only two weapons (it's an action game after all, not a sim): You'll get a primary weapon, such as lasers, and a secondary weapon, such as bombs or the speeder's tow cable. Although you're limited to two weapons per ship, you can find weapons upgrades by destroying certain special buildings, such as supply facilities or factories. Once you do that, you might get weapon upgrades that will apply to all your ships for the rest of the game. Your enemies will be even more varied than the ships. You'll go toe-to-toe (or wing-towing) against other aircraftTIE Fighters, Interceptors, Bombers but you'll also match laser fire with groundbased enemies such as stormtroopers, land speeders, Imperial probe droids, AT-ST Music is one area in which the PC version will benefit from association with its con sole counterpart. ROGUE SQUADRON will use MIDI to provide context-sensitive music. When things get rough, the tempo will quicken, while an impending disaster might be heralded by an ominous score. This will make the levels that much more immersive, as the music, combined with the graphics, will really draw you into the game's universe. There will be no multiplayer support in ROGUE SQUADRON. When I asked about deathmatch, Tosti sheepishly replied that there was no time to implement multiplayer (the N64 version won't have any multiplayer support either), so ROGUE will be strictly a singleplayer experience. As much as we'd like to see a deathmatch version, though, what we've seen of ROGUE SQUADRON has us feeling pretty happy. For action fans looking to jump into some intense dogfighting, ROGUE SQUADRON could supply a lot of mission-oriented but fast-paced arcade-style fun. It might not be a sim on the caliber of TIE FIGHTER, but it's definitely looking to be an action title that could be as fun and challenging as any of the other successful Star Wars titles. It's time to head back to Beggar's Canyon, Rogue Leader. CGW Return to Base Both the N64 and PC versions of ROGUE SQUADRON will feature the same gameplay. However, there will be some benefits to the game being developed on the PC. While Nintendo 64 graphics are beautiful, they can get blurred and muddy. On the PC, ROGUE SQUADRON will support much higher resolutions and possibly more detailed models. That means the ships you fly and the enemies you face could look even sharper on the PC than they do on the N64. The fogging distance is also being tweaked on the PC version. Because 3D-accelerated PCs are more powerful than the N64, the PC version of ROGUE will draw fog farther into the distance, allowing you to see more of the terrain. At this stage in development, it remains to be seen whether the drawing distance will be increased for better terrain or whether the ships will be more detailed. Either way, the PC version will look better than the N64 version. ROGUE PC tentatively supports Direct3D and Glide. Again, we'll have to wait until the game releases to see which other APIs, if any, will be supported. Where's the Force? You may be wondering why FORCE COMMANDER, the real-time Star Wars strategy game that was announced back in April, isn't included in this feature. The title has slipped into 1999, with a release in the same timeframe as the first film in the new trilogy. Our sources tell us that the game which was originally slated to take place over a period between the destruction of Alderaan in Star Wars: A New Hope and the battle of Endor at the end of Return of the Jedi is being redesigned, and will be set in the time period of the new films. We do know that this real-time strategy game will require a 3D graphics accelerator and will feature more than 100 vehicles, personnel, droids, and buildings. You'll be able to fight for the Rebel Alliance or the Empire. We hope to have new details on the game's direction soon. LIGHT ME UP The audio and visual quali-, ty in ROGUE SQUADRON should be high especially on the PC version-featuring dynamic lighting and lightsourcing and context-sensitive music. PROBE THIS This Imperial probe droid isn't too tough. You'll find them in all the game's levels, which include locations on Tatooine, Endor, Mon Calamari, and other famous planets. WHERE IT'S AT-AT Yes, you will get a chance to trip up AT-ATs with a tow cable during one of the levels in ROGUE SQUADRON, although not while you're flying the X-Wing. 158 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "

"RACING GAMES GET YOUR MOI This Year's Field of Racing Games Is Well tuned and Ready to Roll by Tasos Kaiafas 162 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"R RUNNING RACING GAMES uto racing sure has changed a lot in the last 30 years, hasn't it? Just ask our resident auto racing historian and Editor-in-Chief, Johnny Wilson, and he'll start gushing about the days when his beard was still black and race-car drivers were fearless; you won't get away for at least an hour. But could you imagine driving those old, wingless Formula One cars? Aerodynamics? What aerodynamics? Just reduce weight and drag—that's what mattered most. And the early power plants in those cars packed a punch, too 400 horses (or more, in some cases). No wonder so many crashes led to fatalities. Like the sport itself, computer racing games have also evolved considerably since the days of Papyrus' INDIANAPOLIS 500 and MicroProse's WORLD CIRCUIT. The games back then were certainly a lot of fun, but a lot of depth perception was lost in the low-resolution graphics. Today, 3D accelerator cards have turned almost every game in the genre into a jaw-dropping experience. This is an exciting time for racing game fans. Not only can today's CPU handle the floating-point math required to run the complex physics models in simulations, but they can do it while looking amazingly realistic and maintaining superb frame-rates. It should come as no surprise that so many game publishers are getting into driving games this year, many for the first time, with releases that span the spectrum of the genre from full-simulation racing to all-out arcade racing. There are superbikes and dirt bikes; touring cars and Vipers; Formula One of old and Formula One of new. Seems like just about anything with wheels is being modeled (except for a new CART sim; this is the first year in quite a while that there won't be a new one). To better serve your racing needs, we've parsed the games in this racing cornucopia into categories: racing sims, arcade racing, sports car racing, and motorcycle racing. There's definitely something for everyone in 1998, so buckle up—the green flag is about to drop, and the race to the checkered flag is about to begin! www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"RACING SIMS RACING GAMES or many years, when you talked about racing games on the PC, you talked about simulations. Oh sure, from time to time a console racing game would sneak over to the PC, but none of them was very memorable (how can you drive with a digital gamepad?). Papyrus continues to uphold the PC simulation tradition, this time with a retrospective visit to the old days of racing in GRAND PRIX LEGENDS.

"CING GAMES NASCAR Racing 2000 Edition NASCAR RACING Is Idling in Neutral Advice From the Experts on't miss GameSpot's interview with CART's Scott Pruett and NASCAR's Bobby Labonte, as they give their advice on each and every track in their respective series. Both Pruett and Labonte talk about track characteristics and how to drive them, as well as how to set up your car for each one. You'll find it all and more at www.gamespot.com. ARCADE RACING Ithough NASCAR RACING 2000 EDITION (formerly NASCAR RACING 3) won't be out until at least next year, and Papyrus is mostly unwilling to talk about the new design, here's a bit of what we do know. NASCAR 2000 will use a modified version of the GRAND PRIX LEGENDS engine, modifying it, of course, to the physics of the NASCAR automobile. A new driver Al and new artwork will also add to the realism of the experience. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that the new game will also be built to support Internet play from the ground up, considering how popular this has become with NASCAR RACING 2. Watch for more in the coming months in CGW. NASCAR Racing 1999 Edition As a fond farewell to NASCAR RACING 2, Sierra Sports will release a compilation package of everything that is NASCAR RACING 2. Due out later this year, NASCAR RACING 1999 EDITION will include the full version of NASCAR RACING 2, complete with updates to rosters and tracks reflecting the 1998 season, plus the Busch Series Grand National and the Craftsman Truck series. The package will retail for around $29.95. Ithough arcade racing games model real cars, they don't model them with the accuracy and realism of a simulation. Arcade racing games also characteristically supply numerous cars (that's why they can't possibly model all of them realistically), a multitude of exaggerated roads and tracks, and pumping pop music. These games are designed for fun, not realism, and are for those who don't want to practice to compete. Just mash the gas pedal to the floor and drive away.

"he'll go easy on you for your first ticket. If they find you speeding again, they'll call for help, so you'll have more than one squad car coming after you. After ticket number two, they pull out the serious stuff: a roadblock and a spike strip. If you choose to drive the squad car yourself, things can be just as much fun. Catch up to speeders, then flick on the siren and lights. A reticule targets the assailant, so you know who you're after, or use the spike strip to slow them down and pop out from your hiding place to apprehend them.

Each car is customizable through a selection of colors and tuning options, such as brake balance and gear ratios, which are tweaked with an easy-to-use but simplistic slide bar. EA will also offer more cars for download from its Web site (www.ea.com), making for a potentially limitless number of available cars. There are nine different tracks in all, plus an Easter-egg track and a couple bonus tracks set in hill country, a red rock desert, along the seaside, high in the mountains, and two futuristic areas: Aquatica, in which you can drive underwater through a glass tunnel; and Empire City, a dark metropolis with an industrial motif.

The 1998-model sports cars are the Dodge Viper, Chevy Corvette, Aston Martin Vantage, TVR Cerbera, Jaguar XKR Saleen Mustang S351-R. Chevy Camaro SS LT4, and the Nissan Skyline. The older muscle cars are the 1966 Shelby Cobra 427SC, 1967 Pontiac GTO, 1968-1/2 Ford Mustang 428CJ, 1969 Chevrolet Camaro ZL-1, 1969 Chevrolet Corvette ZL-1, 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS LS-6, 1971 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda, and the 1969 Dodge Charger Next come the locations, 11 in all, plus six circuit tracks, for a total of 17.

The circuit tracks are Cheddar Gorge, England, New Castle, England, Maui, Hawaii, Jarash, Jordan; Montego Bay. Jamaica; and Courmayeur, Italy.

Get ready to drop the clutch and race to the first turn, and don't be surprised if you get packed in—these cars can take a few bumps. Don't drive recklessly either; TOCA doesn't tolerate dangerous driving and will issue you three warnings before taking off points. Races run on nine tracks with variable weather conditions: sun, rain, or snow. Because these cars aren't being pushed by the 800-horsepower engines like the ones in CART, Formula One, or NASCAR cars, they are quite a bit more manageable. But TOCA TOURING CAR still provides a lot of high-speed racing thrills for drivers of all levels. And because their chassis and suspension are somewhat protected by body panels, they can take a few bumps without limping off the track and calling it a day. A10 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"MOTORCYCLE RACING RACI ong a big void in computer racing, motorcycle games are finally beginning to hit the track. No fewer than five motorcycle-racing games should be on store shelves by this Christmas, two of which are already available at the time of this writing. Collectively, they span most types of motorcycle racing, from street to dirt and from arcade to simulation. One great feature in most of these next-generation motorcycle games is their use of separate objects for the bike and rider. Sure, this makes for more spectacular crashes, as you watch the driver go sailing through the air like a rag doll, but it also makes rider and bike seem to operate much more naturally when viewed in a chase camera view. For racers who prefer two wheels over four, 1998 should be a vintage year.

You don't crash too often, but you slow down quite a bit if you hit the side of the road (you can't go off the road as in MOTO RACER).

You score points for pulling off any of the 16 preset stunts, and you can even set a time limit and tally the points for a little competition. The reward for a missed stunt is a bad landing, which can be just as entertaining, as you watch, the rider sail through the air, bounce off a large rock, and crash into the ground with his head buried in the sand. Sound violent? Better him than me. Besides the Stunt Quarry, there are three other ways to race: Baja, National Race, and Supercross. In the Baja, a course is set up on similar terrain as the Stunt Quarry, using a series of arched checkpoints. A guidance arrow always points you toward the next one, so you can't get lost. The National Races are like carved-out shallow ravines that snake around to form a course with tall jumps and tight turns. In the Supercross events, you can choose from 20 tracks set in six settings, such as a domed stadium or the inside of a large pyramid. In the stadiums, crowds react audibly to your stunts and crashes. There's even a track editor to let you carve and bulldoze your own motocross courses.

"1080 Or, Why Games Take 18 Months to Deliver by Loyd Case ean forward. No, closer-I have a secret I want to share. love 3D graphics. No, I'm not talking about APIs, hardware accelerators, or even UNREAL. I mean, I love 3D graphics creation tools. Although I qualify as only a dilettante, I fool around with applications like 3D Studio Max, Lightwave 3D, and Bryce 3D. But creating a simple model in 3D Studio is not the same as getting hundreds of models and texture maps into a game. So I thought it would be fun to get game developers to reveal how they did it. 3D-many real-time strategy games fall into this category. In these mini-case studies, we'll take a look at several genres and how they handle 3D art. of the genres, 3D corridor shooters, such as QUAKE II and UNREAL, have some definite advantages. The design challenges are still there, but shooters have smaller environments than flight sims, for example. It's a lot easier to render a handful of characters running through a corridor than two squadrons of fighters, multiple ground vehicles, and 50 square miles of realistic-looking terrain. Early in the history of 3D acceleration, flight-sim designers resisted using 3D accelerators because they often had huge texture sets in any given scene. Driving games fall somewhere in the middle: They feature larger environments than a corridor shooter, but the vehicles generally run within fixed tracks. Even racing games that seem to have a more open environment make some trade-offs, as anyone who has driven underwater for an extended length of time in MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS can attest. Let's take a look at the workings of three different games. GENRE DICTATES STYLE If you've ever watched a high-quality 3D shooter and a sophisticated flight sim side-by-side, you may have been struck by the differences in appearance. Both use 3D graphics, but with markedly different results, because of the different trade-offs that designers have to make to get good performance out of each type of game. There are also games that have a 3D look but aren't true 192 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"MechCommander: Not 3D—but a Living World ECHCOMMANDER falls into that special third category I mentioned: It has a fairly strong 3D feel, but it isn't really a 3D game. What MECHCOMMANDER definitely is, however, is one of the most graphically complex real-time strategy games ever shipped. Each map has huge numbers of \"live\" objects. For example, forest squares have five different states: standing, fallen, undamaged, burned, and burned and fallen. All the buildings are similarly live, as are fences, walls, and gates. The BattleMechs themselves are even more complicated. Each Mech comprises four different 2D sprites. Legs are rendered at 16 distinct angles, while torso and arms are rendered at 32 angles. There are 150,000 frames of animation for each Mech. Because of the artistic complexity of the world, designers had to make trade-offs; one was the removal of the \"save anywhere\" feature. With so many live objects and states in any one map, saving a game could take several minutes. Contrast this with the original DOOM, in which there were only eight single views of any live monster (DOOM used 2D sprites for creatures and wasn't \"true\" 3D). This brings me to an important point: Animation is an illusion that creates the appearance of realistic motion. Even 3D action games tend to have limited amounts of real animation for each creature or character. More on this later. If 150,000 frames of animation for each Mech seems like a lot, you're right. So the tools used to create these effects need to be quite sophisticated. FASA Interactive used Alias Poweranimator running on Silicon Graphics workstations for the Mech animation. Buildings and vehicles were built using Newtek's Lightwave 3D, a popular 3D modeling and animation package The seemingly simple running motion of this Mech can only be accomplished through long hours of programming and testing. Compound this by thousands of animations for a standard 3D game, and you can understand why development takes so long. Amiga but now runs on a wide One of the trade-offs the range of systems.

"Confirmed Kill: Gravity and Ground HOXO XOOH HOXO Here's a texture map for a Supermarine Spitfire. The primary texture map is the big one, and the Level of Detail (lod) MIP-maps are the successively smaller ones. 30 Studio MAX 112 Spa Masle GW YA BE DI MAS N ola klx 14Xen! ST ims are another story altogether when it comes to 3D graphics, and there are major distinctions within the genre. Space sims have it relatively easy. Games like TIE FIGHTER, FREESPACE, and WING COMMANDER: PROPHECY don't have to worry about rendering terrain or the constant effect of gravity. Flight sims, however, have to render real-world gravity and miles and miles of terrain, all of which tends to suck up either graphics accelerator cycles or CPU cycles, resulting in sacrifices that have to be made in image complexity. I spent some time at Eidos with the design team for CONFIRMED KILL, an upcoming WWII flight sim, to find out how they deal with such rendering challenges. One way that flight sims can manage levels of detail is through MIP-mapping, which uses a series of texture maps, each one slightly larger than the previous one. As an aircraft gets closer, a larger texture map with increased complexity gets applied to the now-larger aircraft. The programmer who writes the game engine decides at what point the new MIP-map is applied. The original texture map is created in Adobe Photoshop, but Eidos has a proprietary tool that automatically creates the smaller MIP-maps from the full-size original. Gare Cool Each \"world\" or mission typically has a set polygon budget. Even in the era of third-generation 3D accelerators and 450MHz CPUs, there is still a limit to what can be rendered at 30 frames per second. So tradeoffs get made here, too. For example, the gamer's plane consists of roughly 500 polygons. However, each enemy plane is rendered with only about 200 polygons. The CK team's thinking here is that most flight simmers will spend time in external views, looking at their own planes, but they're not going to spend a lot of time closely examining an enemy plane that's shooting at them. Ground texture maps in CONFIRMED KILL consists of terrain tiles that are laid out at run time, rather than the huge photorealistic textures of some sims. N ice 100        Selge 3 Here's the wireframe of the in-game Spitfire model. This yields better performance, but at the expense of terrain accuracy. The minimum distance between defined terrain points is roughly 20 meters. Some sims have more precise terrain; others, less. Even so, the texture maps for terrain can become quite large. CONFIRMED KILL loads up to 8MB of textures at a time but, interestingly enough, doesn't make effective use of AGP.

"BUDGETING FOR PERFORMANCE artifact of the 3D engine that the CK team is using, which was developed in the pre-AGP era and which forces complete copying of texture across the bus. Weksler pointed out, however, that the extra bandwidth and absence of bus contention resulted in better performance in CONFIRMED KILL. The design team has used two different tools to create the game's aircraft models. To create the ingame models the designers used a modified version of Flight Sim Toolkit, an old modeling package designed by Simis specifically for creating flight sims. But to create the complex models used for cut-scenes, the designers turned to 3D Studio Max by Kinetix, a highly sophisticated package widely used by game companies for a variety of 3D art. The CK team is also working on tools that would allow 3D Studio Max to export files for ingame models. As a result, noted 3D artist John MacKay, designers would need to create only a single model for use in both cut-scene animation and in the game. But, McKay added, it wouldn't be that simple. The cut-scene models can have up to 500,000 polygons; the in-game model, only 200-500. Getting from 500,000 polygons to 500-a 1,000X reduction in polygon count-isn't easy if you want the low-count model to look good. Gary La Rochelle, another Eidos artist, noted that working with programmers was a give-andtake process. In fact, this negotiation between artist and programmer was a common theme. The programmers want to add more features and increase performance, while the art team wants their stuff to look good. It all has to come together in the middle somewhere. 5% fart was all there was in a game, it wouldn't be much of a game (no MYST jokes, please). Graphics is only one piece of the action. There's also Al, physics modeling, game controllers, and audio, each of which has an impact on performance. Game designers and programmers wrestle with these issues all the time-essentially, they budget for performance. The first step is usually to determine a baseline CPU. At Eidos, according to CONFIRMED KILL producer Mike Gilmartin, the goal is to pick the CPU that will be mainstream by the time a game ships. The CONFIRMED KILL team is shooting for decent performance on a Pentium 150. Andrew Lunstad of Fenris Wolf said the company is aiming for good performance with REBEL MOON REVOLUTION on a 166MHz Pentium with MMX and a 3Dfx (Voodoo?) card. But performance budgeting is really the art of estimation. \"We try to keep these things a little bit rough, since they vary with game action,\" Lunstad said. Both producers agreed that the biggest chunk of the performance budget these days is graphics-as much as 75-85 percent in the case of REBEL MOON REVOLUTION (this includes both geometry and rendering chores). Al accounts for 5-20 percent; physics, 5-10 percent; and whatever is left is allocated for audio, networking, and other chores. Another issue that is fairly new is budget CPU BUDGET ing bandwidth. \"If we have to load 200MB of data to get at all the vertices, our game will Other stall on the memory bus,\" Lunstad added. The polygon counts for the final game are then decided based on the target CPU 10% and budget for graphics. In CONFIRMED KILL, the player aircraft consist of 500 Physics polygons, while the enemy planes are roughly 200 polygons. Of course, buildings and ground objects also use some of the polygon budget. REBEL MOON RISING budgets roughly 3,500 polygons for the environment and 250 polygons for each character and there can be as many as 16 characters running around at any time. Networking issues can sometimes result in trade-offs. Eidos' Gilmartin pointed out that the single-player game tracks every bullet fired, whereas in network play the bullets are calculated as groups of five. -Graphics Trying to track every bullet fired on the network would result in unacceptable net 75% work traffic. Tracking state changes also uses up some of the CPU: Is a building standing, partially damaged, burning, or completely destroyed? Still, it's clear that with modern games, graphics and animation account for the lion's share of the performance budget. So the next time you're running down a corridor in your favorite 3D shooter, remember that the graphics are eating more CPU horsepower than the Apollo lunar missions. -AI 10% Action Games: Where They Are ction games offer yet another set of challenges for 3D design. In any game, one of the biggest challenges is how to keep track of all the objects and their various states. The console gaming world has often made use of Multigen, and that tool is now finding favor among computer game developers. Graeme Devine of Trilobyte uses Multigen to aid the development of EXTREME WARFARE, a real-time, team-based 3D wargame. \"Multigen has a publicdomain format, which allows easy creation of level and game objects,\" Devine says. In fact, Trilobyte wants people to actively develop levels and new objects. Multigen also allows the Trilobyte programmers to easily set trigger points, which can range from doors opening to spawning points for new players. Like many other game developers, the Trilobyte programmers use 3D Studio Max as their primary www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 199 "

"The by Dave Salvator HARDWARE Bu HORIZON. New Levels of Performance Present Exciting Possibilities othing has shaken up the PC gaming universe so much as the arrival of 3D graphics accelerators. No other single piece of hardware has made more jaws drop or generated more fervor, hype, speculation, excitement, or frustration—not to mention some unprecedented stupid marketing tricks. But spin-doctoring aside, 3D graphics accelerators have come a very long way indeed. From the agony of Creative Labs' disastrous 3D Blaster and S3's ill-fated ViRGE line, to the ecstasy of 3Dfx's original Voodoo accelerator, many graphicschip makers have had to sprint up the 3D learning curve just to stay in the game. 200 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"3D HARDWARE in making 3D graphics happen and see what changes are looming on the horizon. Hot Potato Dfx's Voodoo2 was heralded at arrival, and there are several new chips (from nVidia, ATI, and S3, among others) that hope to equal Voodoo2's performance. How many actually will is the subject of much debate; and where multitextured games are concerned, Voodoo2 is still very tough to beat. But imagine for a moment a world where just about every new 3D accelerator had performance approaching that of a Voodoo2 board; where almost every chip was at or near 100Mpixels/sec of fill rate (the measure of how fast a chip can blast pixels onto a scene's polygons). What would game developers be able to do with that much performance? Well, a number of things, including more detailed models, greater resolutions (like 1024x768 and higher), multitexturing, full-scene antialiasing, and enhanced filtering effects. New accelerators are only part of the overall 3D pipeline in a PC, of course. Other system components—the CPU, system chipset, system memory, and AGP or PCI-will also play a crucial role in making the performance of new 3D titles either fly or flounder. 3D graphics is an ongoing game of \"hot potato\" as to which system component will be the bottleneck, and the 3D pipeline can be only as fast as its slowest component. Where is the bottleneck now? Turns out that for the most part, the new class of 3D accelerators is host-bound, waiting for the CPU to feed them more triangles. But CPU makers are laboring to increase their triangle output, and there are some interesting, lower-cost alternatives to Intel. Each new generation of games seems to up the performance ante. For the most part, game developers pine for five things: higher triangle counts, more textures with higher detail, multitexturing, better filtering, and higher resolutions. But how do these new demands tax your system? And which system parts should you consider upgrading to get ready for this holiday season? For the answer to these questions—and as a prelude to our 3D graphics roundup juggernaut next month-let's travel the 3D pipeline to understand the role played by each part of the system First Things First Consider, first, how the 3D graphics workload is divided. The CPU still handles the early stages of the pipeline, namely, translation and clipping, and transformation and lighting (T/L). Translation is the moving of a 3D object along one of the three axes (x, y, z); clipping involves determining which polygons from the 3D world are visible in the scene, keeping those for further processing, and discarding the rest. Transformation is the \"free\" moving of objects in 3D space; and lighting, as the name suggests, is the application of lights-specular, spotlight, ambient, colored-to the objects in the scene. After leaving the CPU, 3D graphics arrive at the accelerator via AGP or PCI. The accelerators handle a lot of the rendering work, and this stage of the pipeline is sometimes called the \"rasterization\" portion. A few years ago, games were \"fill-ratelimited,\" meaning that the 3D accelerator was the bottleneck. But those days are gone, and many newer chipsets are bound by the slower rate of triangles being fed to them by the CPU. The whole subject of 3D graphics is a complicated one, and oversimplification can be misleading. But two metrics (and their relationship to each other) emerge that game developers care about: triangle-rate (the number of polygons a 3D system can produce and draw) and fill-rate (the speed at which an accelerator can blast pixels onto the rendered triangles). Although game performance doesn't correspond directly to these rates, there is pretty good correlation. So, you need both good triangle-rate and good fillrate to make games look better. Right now, we have more of the latter than the former, so let's take a look at how the CPU contributes to making 3D happen, and what will be happening to that part of the 3D pipeline. CPU: Giver of Triangles Most of the 3D pipeline rendering work occurs in the floatingpoint unit (FPU) of a CPU, so that part of the chip needs to be able to move things along quickly. Better floating-point performance translates into more triangles being fed to the 3D accelerator. 3D Graphics Pipeline 4-0-0CPU Translation (x,y,z) Transformation (Rotational) Lighting Clipping 3D Card iacing Alpha (Transparency) Fog Fog Texture Gouraud Shading Antialiasing (Jagged to Smooth) Perspective Correction Movin' On Down the Line: As you can see, the 3D accelerator handles a great deal of the rendering work and, step by step, is taking on even more pipeline tasks. One very important step (not illustrated) is triangle setup, which many first-generation 3D chips didn't do. During setup, polygons are put into a data format that the 3D accelerator engine can understand. Setup also can involve the calculation of slopes of polygon edges, and incremental values for pixel interpolation across scan lines. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"3D HARDWARE Al: 10% Other: 5% (Networking, Audio, etc.) Physics: 10% Graphics: 75% Budget Impasse: Despite the many advances in 3D accelerators, CPU budgets haven't changed all that much from the days of software-only 3D engines. The graphics work still gets the lion's share of the CPU, with the other tasks getting whatever is left over. But because CPUs have gotten faster over time as well, the \"leftovers\" not used for graphics work allow other game-related tasks to get more processing power. sion detection, audio, controller 1/0, and networking overhead for multiplayer games. The actual max triangle count, therefore, would probably be more in the range of 300-500K polygons/sec, still leaving the graphics card waiting for more triangles. Even at this \"reduced\" rate, games could have approximately 6,500 triangles per scene at 60fps, far better than the few hundred polygons per scene we've seen in games past. In DirectX 7, the next version of DirectX, the capability to accelerate transform and lighting data with a dedicated geometry proces. sor instead of the CPU will be exposed. This could open up intriguing possibilities, as it would radically alter how the CPU budget gets divided among parts of the game. In theory, rather than having a great-looking game with dim-witted Al, plain-Jane audio, and questionable physics, you could have much smarter bad guys much better physics for things like recoil, explosions, and ambient physical effects, as well as more 3D audio streams to fur ther immerse you in the game. But this is still a ways off. see that the PCI bus would event ually be unable to handle the growth in polygon counts and texture sets. Intel responded with a new place for graphics to live, the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP). which currently offers from twice to four times PCI's maximum data rate and lets a graphics chip use system memory as an extension of its local frame buffer memory. Almost all new parts shipping this fall will feature AGP 2X, meaning they will move data out of system memory at 528MB/sec maximum. in addition, system memory bus speed has increased to 100MHz in Intel's 440BX and 440GX chipsets, which ups the system memory's maximum rate from 528MB/sec to 800MB/sec. There aren't any other imminent changes to main memory speed, although Direct RDRAM (DRDRAM) is on the distant horizon. DRDRAM can be used in channels, and the likely configuration will be two channels, each with a top-end speed around 700MB/sec, yielding a top-end data rate of 1.4GB/sec of peak s ystem memory bandwidth. DRDRAM will arrive with Intel's next-generation 64-bit Merced processors, due sometime in the year 2000. In the interim, Intel is planning on revving AGP to what will be called AGP 4X, which will up its maximum data rate to around 1GB/sec, hopefully allowing 3D accelerators to get at data in system memory even faster. Memory and System Buses From the CPU, the 3D workload makes its way across either AGP or the PCI bus to the 3D accelerator. About two years ago, Intel and the graphics-chip makers began to Traditionally, Intel has been the dominant performer in this area, because of deeper pipelining in its FPU. But that story may be changing, at least for a while. AMD, with support from IDT/Centaur and Cyrix, has established a single set of floating point instruction extensions, dubbed 3DNow!, which is designed to make 3D rendering work move faster through each company's CPU. In our recent review of AMD's K6-2 (formerly known as the K6-3D+), a 333MHz K6-2 fared well against Intel on floating-point performance, actually outpacing a 350MHz Pentium II running QUAKE 11. But the success of 3DNow! is far from a slam-dunk. There are several hurdles it will have to clear before AMD or its supporters can really declare any kind of vic tory: First and foremost, games don't get the performance boost from 3DNow! \"for free.\" A game must be written using either the Direct3D transform and lighting (T/L) engine, something very few game developers have opted to use, or custom assembly code. Ironically, in wooing game developers to use Direct3D's T/L engine, AMD, Cyrix, and IDT/Centaur may actually have a friend in Intel. Intel's next processor, code-named Katmai, will have its own set of instructions for accelerating Direct3D transforms and lighting if D3D's T/L engine is used. Given that both Intel and its competitors will have ways of accelerating the CPU portion of Direct3D's pipeline, game developers may find D3D's T/L engine enticing. Additionally, the DirectX 6.0 version of the D3D T/L engine has undergone a substantial rewrite, and should outperform its predecessor. Another downside for AMD is that aside from adding 3DNow!, it made no other enhancements to K6-2's floating-point unit, so games that aren't 3DNow!-aware will still trail Intel's performance. Plus, game developers tend to be very houseproud about writing their own T/L engines: They might be willing to do transforms using D3D's built-in engine, but they're likely to continue doing their own lighting to give their games a unique look and feel. About a year and a half ago, people in the industry were talking about clearing the one-millionpolygon-per-second hurdle. Now, a 400MHz Pentium Il system with a Voodoo2 board can top 1.7 million polygons/sec, assuming you don't want to do anything else. Of course, there are other minor details to consider, like, say, actual gameplay code: Al, physics, colliMax System RAM Speed EDO DRAM/SDRAM ca. 1993-98 528MB/sec PG100 SDRAM 1998-2000 800MB/sec DRDRAM 2000-2 1.4GB/sec RAM-ming Speed: System memory got a recent maximum speed boost of about 50 percent (from 528 to 800MB/sec). When Intel ships its next-generation Merced CPU, the system memory's maximum data rate will nearly double to 1.4GB/sec, mostly to accommodate hungry 3D applications. 214 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"3D HARDWARE AGP vs. PCI Intel's Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) allows game developers to use more textures and higher polygon counts without sacrificing speed. It does this with higher bus speeds and texture management. Here's how it works: Life on PCI Life on AGP Networks Sound P Disk Controller CI slots Standard System RAM AGP System RAM Sound Graphic chipset 72 chipset 1813882 Graphics CPU CPU PCI slots (132MB/sec. bus speed) Games are becoming so demanding that the 33MHz PCI bus can't handle the volume of information that needs to move across it. AGP (264 or 528MB/sec, hus speed) AGP gives the graphics card its own dedicated 66MHz, higher bandwidth bus. Graphics Card on PCI Bus AGP Graphics Card on Dedicated Bus Memory buffers Front Front Back PCI slots Mereka butions Standard chipset System RAM AGP System RAM Tekture Texture UTANT) chipset N BAN AGP is not without its critics, nor its shortcomings. In fact Voodoo2, the fastest-shipping kid on the block, achieves its industryleading performance on the PCI bus, which goes to show that a chip's architecture determines its performance more than which bus it runs on. But 3Dfx has seen the future, and it is AGP, with Quantum3D doing an AGP version of its X24 board (SLI on a single board), and 3Dfx's new 2D/3D part, Voodoo Banshee, which may already be out as you read this. In the AGP gospel according to Intel, game developers should be using AGP memory-system memory reserved by the graphics card for texture storage-as the primary storage area for textures for game engines. And while AGP is much faster than PCI in moving data from system memory to local video memory, AGP's peak data rate is much less than that of local video memory itself. That aside, AGP is still quite a step up from PCI: It allows textures to be processed in system memory and it enables side-band addressing, which lets the graphics chip talk directly to system memory. In terms of new chipsets, Intel should now be shipping its 440GX chipset, which 440GX increases the addressable memory from 1GB to 2GB. But the company designed the chipset for its Xeon processor, CPU When present-day graphics cards run out of onboard memory, they store texture data in System RAM. When needed, data is copied to the card's local memory for processing. AGP's \"Execute\" mode allows the chip to grab texture data directly from a specially allocated portion of System RAM, without first having to copy it to the card's local texture memory. which is intended to compete in high-end workstation and server spaces. So unless you feel that your system is really dragging with a \"measly\" 1GB of system memory, you probably won't need to seriously consider a 440GX upgrade for a while. 3D Accelerators There's a maxim in the computer industry known as Moore's Law, which states that CPU processing power will double every 18 months. That law has pretty Glossary much held true in years past, though the rate of increase in CPU performance has slowed some what. But in the 3D graphics business, Moore's Law is alive and well. Some 18 months ago, the peak performance from 3D accelerator chips hovered in the 40-50Mpixels/sec range (this from 3Dfx's Voodoo chipset). Today, every new chip coming onto the market has at least 80Mpixels/sec of peak performance, with some chips being specced at close to the 100Mpixel/sec mark, and nVidia's RIVA TNT chip specced at 195Mpixels/sec peak fill-rate. What's also interesting to note is that 3D accelerators are becoming increasingly complex chips: nVidia's RIVA TNT, for example, has about as many transistors as a Pentium II CPU. Between the increasing complexity and horsepower of these 3D chips, and the possibilities that AGP will create, the PC is starting to look a little like a Silicon Graphics workstation, with the graphics chip ceasing to be mere ly an \"accelerator\" and becoming almost a second CPU. It's still a faint resemblance, however, since most SGI boxes clearly outgun even well-equipped PCs for sheer performance. Antialiasing: A method of cleaning up the stair-stepping effect visible in diagonal lines that fall between pixel boundaries. It also cleans up some texture pixelation. Multitexturing: The ability to render two or more texture maps onto a surface, thus creating composite texturing effects. Bump Mapping: A multitexturing effect that allows a game developer to give a surface a \"tactile\" look, such as an embossing effect. Stencil Buffer: Used to create lighting effects; very useful in making shadows more realistic. \"A Fool and His FillRate Are Soon Gaming\" Even though many new chips can achieve triple-digit framerates on some games in our 3D GameGauge tests, any frame-rate over 60fps is gratuitous. A 140fps score may make for bragging rights (though it's more meaningful as an indication of headroom the chip has left for rendering). but when your frame-rate is much over the 60fps mark, your emphas is should switch to improving image quality. For now, you can do either or both of two things: Dial up the resolution or turn on additional rendering effects, like trilinear filtering. Future games will use such new DirectX 6 features as multitexturing, bump mapping, antialiasing, and anisotropic filtering, all of which are fill-rate-hungry ways to improve image quality. Why is higher resolution a good thing? Two words: pixel density. when you shift from, say, 640x480 to 1024x768, your monitor does not magically get bigger, you just cram more pixels into the samesized area. The primary net effect is to clean up \"jaggies,\" the stairstepping that occurs when a diagonal line falls between pixel boundaries. Higher pixel density cleans up these diagonal lines and very time we think we've got our brains around the lingua technica of 3D graphics, those design guys come up with a new set of rendering features. Here are some of the biggies to look forward to in DirectX 6: Anisotropic Filtering: An advanced type of filtering that cleans up the distortion of a 3D object whose surface is at an angle with respect to the plane of the screen. This is very computer-intensive. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 219 "

"3D HARDWARE 400x300 Pixel Density Table Resolution Relative Pixel (Pixels, WxH) Density 640x480 800x600 1.56X 1024x768 2.56x 1280x1024 4.27X 800x600 reduces stair-stepping (see the table and diagram). Another way to achieve a similar benefit is to enable full-scene antialiasing: several cards currently use a technique called supersampling to do this. This takes the 640x480 (or, in some cases, 800x600) image, \"blows it up to a higher resolution, and uses a downsampling algorithm to clean up stair-stepping on lines and some texture artifacts that are normally visible at lower resolution. Which approach nets the better image quality depends on the game. Gamers are accustomed to making frame-rate/image quality trade-offs. As chip performance increases, these decisions should become less painful, and we'll be able to run games at 800x600 with all rendering goodies on and still get good frame-rate. Of course, nothing in 3D graphics is guaranteed. One reason is that game developers seem to follow a sort of Parkinson's Law when it comes to processing horsepower. Their rule appears to be, \"We'll find a way to use every MIP you can feed us.\" This makes for newer, better, and better-looking games, and it pushes the technology forward. But it also keeps us Are You Dense? Greater pixel density at higher resolutions can clean up \"jaggies,\" and also improve texture image quality, especially in \"busy\" textures that have a lot of detail. Full-scene antialiasing can also achieve a similar effect. As to which one will look better, that depends on the individual game. returning to the computer store for upgrades every 9-18 months.

Tune in next month when Loyd Case and I exhaustively test the latest boards from Diamond, STB. Matrox, Guillemot, ATI, and Quantum 3D, among others. CGW Intel Aims Low Intel has a way-intentional or not-of making competitors nervous. The company has recently taken a strong interest in the \"low end\" of the computer market: sub-$1000 PCs, and even some that dip below the $800 price point. This is the one market segment where Intel faces stiff competition for price/performance from AMD, Cyrix, and IDT/Centaur. Intel's entrant here is the Celeron, a Pentium II with no Level 2 (L2) cache. Intel pulled the L2 to get Celeron's price down enough to compete with the non-Intel CPU makers, but its next lowend part, code-named Mendocino, will be a Celeron with an integrated 128KB L2 cache in the chip, running at the CPU's core clock-rate. To make these low-end systems even cheaper, Intel is working on a new chipset, code-named Whitney. This new chipset, still unannounced at press time, will integrate an i740 graphics core into the north bridge (which connects the CPU to the main memory bus). Whitney will also integrate an audio controller; Ultra ATA EIDE controller; USB; and a new bus called LPC (low pin-count), which will handle legacy devices such as serial and parallel ports, keyboard, and mouse. Gone is ISA functionality, meaning that all devices in a Whitney-based box will connect via PCI or USB. These systems can be configured to give the 1740 its own frame buffer, or the graphics accelerator can use system memory. Whitney will have a 100MHz system bus and will likely be paired with Intel's new 330MHz Mendocino Celeron. Other chip-makers have developed similar products, such as Cyrix's MediaGX processor and SiS 530 chipset, but with Intel entering the fray, should third-party graphics-card makers be nervous? Probably With Whitney, Intel hopes to build competitive low-cost systems, which of course involves making trade-offs. But Whitney will also take business away from graphics-chip makers in low-end systems. So while Intel will hit its desired price points, these systems are not likely to deliver top-end performance. All of which begs the question: Does Intel want to take this strategy into mid-range and high-end systems? Intel has been very mum about future plans, but system makers such as Dell, Micron, Gateway, and Compaq like being able to pick which graphics chips they use. They also like being able to change chips on short notice. Even if these makers offered a system using a \"new and improved\" Whitney aimed at the $1500-$2500 price range segment, it would probably be only one of many offerings. It's this desire for design flexibility on the part of the system makers that is the graphics-chip makers' ace in the hole. Choice is good. More than that: When you're putting together a killer gaming rig, choice is essential. And while integration works well for low-cost PCs, its dictated-by-cost rigidity isn't likely to lead to an optimal gaming box. ZZZ COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "

"IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE Creative Gets Back Into the Game TechWatch s audio has migrated to the PCI bus and sprouted a third dimension, a lot of pekple have been asking, \"Where's Creative Labs?\" It seems that over the last several years, Creative has been milking its Sound Blaster brand with incremental upgrades to the original Sound Blaster 16. Creative recently acquired Ensoniq and a major interest in speaker maker Cambridge SoundWorks. But despite these incremental moves, the company that pioneered audio in PCs in the DOS days (the late '80s) needed to reinvent itself in the PC audio space if it wanted to stay competitive. And it would seem that it now has. Creative recently unveiled its new, longawaited Sound Blaster Livel, a PCI-based sound card based on E-mu's 10K1 chip, a beefy audio processor capa ble of 64-note wavetable polyphony, DirectSound and DirectSound 3D acceleration, hardware mixing, and acceleration of Creative's own Environmental Audio Extensions (EAX). It's this last feature that is probably the most noteworthy. In response to Aureal Semiconductor's A3D 3D positional-audio API, Creative has delivered EAX to developers as an extension of DirectSound 3D. The main selling point of EAX versus A3D, according to Creative, is that EAX allows for acoustic characteristics of rooms to be modeled and applied. Say, for example, in a game environment, you move from a small room with many sound-absorbing surfaces into a much larger room with more ambient reverb. This effect would be applied to all sounds, and also applied to 3D audio as it is rendered. The effect was very apparent when I tested a demo of a tweaked, bundled special version of UNREAL that uses EAX. The results were impressive. General MIDI sounded solid as well, and because Sound Blaster Live! uses system memory to store its wavetable patch sets, you can pick and choose which patch set you want to use via Creative's SoundFont technology. We should soon be getting a test unit, so look for a full review next month.-Dave Salvator nVidia RIVA TNT This is nVidia's next-generation 2D/3D graphics accelerator, which may well outperform two, yes two, Voodoo2 boards running SLI.

"REVIEW MICRON MILLENNIA 400 The New Millennia Solid Performer Marred by Small, but Noticeable, Flaws HARDWAR GAMING What's in the Box by Dave Salvator icron is another one of those top-tier system makers who don't build a gaming rig specifically, but happen to make a box that turns out to be good for gaming. Micron's latest is its Millennia 400 Mini Tower, which, for the most part, has solid components that come together to deliver solid gaming performance, albeit with a few glitches. At press time, Micron was working on a new gamer's box, which will include a Voodoo2 board to beef up the 3D graphics. Setup is by and large painless; the system is up and running in about 10 minutes. It turns out that Micron and Dell have apparently found the same case supplier: both system makers' boxes have identical cases. The good news is that these cases are easily accessed once a single thumbscrew is removed. But it also happens that the similarities don't end there. These systems have the same motherboard, the same CPU, the same amount of memory, the same graphics chipset, and the same DVD-ROM drive. And—surprise, surprise—the two turn out to have pretty similar performance, COMPUTER although Micron does clearly beat out Dell in several tests. Although both systems use the same chipset, Micron's driver for the RIVA 128 chipset was well ahead of Dell's in 3D WinBench, although in 3D GameGauge the difference was in the noise, only about 1fps per game. But it seems that in tweaking its driver for better 3D WinBench performance, Micron sacrificed something in the area of Direct3D compliance, which became evident during game testing. In FORSAKEN, the Micron had drawing errors on the weapon-fire tracers; the two-triangle squares on which these tracers were being drawn and alpha-blended were visible. And when running INCOMING, I saw incorrect shadowing during the helicopter sequence. Diamond's newest driver fixed the errors in INCOMING but not FORSAKEN. Image quality in TUROK, F22 ADF, QUAKE, and QUAKE II was fine. When we look at benchmark scores, Micron has an edge in most tests, with the most noticeable advantage being the CD-ROM CPU usage, which was a scant 2.68 percent on the Micron versus Dell's 73.1 percent. The Dell's tweakedout hard-disk controller driver accounts for its unusually high score on the Business Disk WinMark score. The Micron ships with a 2x Hitachi DVD-ROM drive and Diamond DVD decoder board, and a quick visual inspection of playback of the movie Goodfellas showed solid image quality and good A/V synch. As for other considerations, because Micron uses Intel motherboards, this system arrived with a Phoenix BIOS, which allows for basic system tweaks but lacks the granularity provided by Award BIOSes. The system arrived with DirectX5 pre-installed, although a copy of the DirectX \"redistributable\" drivers wasn't on the system. Also, Windows 98's CAB files weren't copied onto the hard disk, although it's easy enough to copy them over yourself. Micron opted to use a motherboard-down implementation of Crystal Semiconductor's SoundFusion PCI audio accelerator chipset. The chipset sounds fine, and has a convincing General MIDI Wavetable patch set. Despite the SoundFusion's ample capabilities the bundled Advent AV390PL speakers are only adequate. On this particular point, Dell clearly 400MHz Pentium II W/512KB integrated L2 cache: Intel motherboard with 440BX chipset: 64MB SDRAM (running at 100MHz), Diamond Viper 330 4MB AGP (uses RIVA 128); Micron 17-inch monitor; Diamond DVD Decoder Card; IBM 9.4GB Ultra ATA Hard Drive; 2x DVD-ROM Hitachi GD-2000: Crystal Semiconductor SoundFusion PCI Audio Accelerator, Advent AV390PL speakers; 56K USR Fax Win INT modem: Microsoft SideWinder Joystick has an advantage with its AltecLansing AC-495s. We don't like seeing benchmark-tweaked drivers that eat into actual game performance, and this rig arrived with one. That aside, the system is otherwise solid, and at $2,499, it offers a lot in one box. But given that Micron will most likely be shipping a Voodoo2-equipped box by the time you're reading this, you might want to wait.

"REVIEW SC&T UP-300 PER4MER FORCE FEEDBACK WHEEL Muscle Car TARDWARE by Loyd Case t one point, while testing the UP-300 force feedback racing wheel, I had to yank my hands away when the wheel pegged over to one side and refused to budge. That shows you how strong this wheel really is—so strong that you COMPUTER GAMING WORLD sometimes find yourself actually wrestling with it. (You can dial down the force effects in the control panel if they're too much for you.) Regardless of how strong the wheel is, it just doesn't deliver a very realistic driving experience. To be fair, part of the problem isn't the maker of the wheel, but the relative infancy of force-effects design. The forces just don't feel real in some titles. The only vehicle that feels right with the UP-300 is the big bus in INTERSTATE '76, and that's because the plane of the UP-300 wheel is canted about 30 degrees, making it feel more as if you're driving a bus or truck than a svelte Indy car. It's a bit of a chore to do the initial setup. The wires from the power brick and pedal base are strung through channels (like those on the back of a wallmounted telephone), and the didn't seem as severe as the test forces in the SC&T control panel. SC&T has also reduced the number of buttons from its previous Per4mer. Now if the designers would move two of the 11 buttons to the back for a paddle shifter effect, it would be perfect. And then there's the angle of the wheel.... The cosmetics are much more subdued than those of SC&T's past wheel. The floor pedals are large and work very well. But overall, there's an unfinished feel to the controller, and I couldn't help thinking that with just a few more hours spent on prototyping, this could have been a great wheel. If you need to have your gear look like a Momo wheel right out of a European Formula 1 racer, then this wheel is not for you. On the other hand, you might consider the UP-300 if you want a decent wheel that delivers amazingly strong force effects. CGW ***** connectors are recessed. You have a choice of suction cups or screw brackets, but the suction cups proved more than adequate and much easier to install. You do need an available 9-pin serial port—this is not a gameport device. SC&T is readying a USB model for those with newer systems and Windows 98. I fired up MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS 2 and Sega's RALLY game, which is bundled with the wheel, along with Sega's DAYTONA arcade racer. The force effects worked quite well and APPEAL: Gamers looking for a wheel that delivers a lot of brute force. PROS: Very strong forces; standard Immersion 2.0 force feedback implementation CONS: Default force settings are almost too strong wheel canted at odd angle Price: $199 MSRP Manufacturer: SC&T International (800) 408-4084 photo: Michael Falconer www.platinumsound.com REVIEW MICROSOFT SIDEWINDER FORCE FEEDBACK WHEEL CAMING EDITORS: CHOICE Microsoft's Driving Force by Loyd Case his will be the year of force feedback. Uh-huh, sure. In fact, there will be a lot of force feedback controllers coming out and quite a few games with force feedback support, but every force feedback COMPUTER GAMING WORL game I've tested leaves me feeling like I've eaten French fries without a burger. I don't think it's a problem with the controllers (at least, not this one), but with the immaturity of the game implementations. That said, Microsoft's Sidewinder Force Feedback Wheel (FFW) is a polished product with a smooth, balanced force feedback implementation. It's compact and installs quickly, and after you set it up the first time, you can just pop it off the desktop with a single clampsorta like a giant vise grip. And because it's relatively small, I didn't need to push my monitor back more than a couple of inches. FFW is fully Directinput-compatible in both DirectX 5 and 6, so I took it for a spin through several force feedback games, including MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS 2, Sega's DAYTONA, and CART PRECISION RACING. Of the three, * * * * control software that comes with the game. You can also program your own setups. The Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback Wheel is a smooth performer, and feels more polished than the SC&T wheel. The angle of the wheel is more like that of a true race car, and the rubberized covering feels more comfortable. it works well with non-force feedback games, and some force games actually feel pretty good. The hard-core racing sim crowd won't like it, but most of us don't have $700 or more for wheels anyway. At $200, the MS wheel with force feedback makes for a pricey but fun wheel for the casual driving set. CGW CART'S implementation seemed less gimmicky and contributed more to the actual feel of a race than the other two, but wasn't perfect. Running off the track onto the grass yielded a nice, bumpy effect, and going around turns at high speed seemed to generate additional force. On non-force feedback games the FFW retains an even tension with the geared motor. I played MOTORHEAD quite a bit with the FFW, and it seemed to handle as well as most lower-cost, non-force feedback devices. You can adjust the force level in the well-designed APPEAL: Casual to moderate driving game fans who want to feel the force. PROS: Compact size: smooth force feedback implementation quick and easy installation CONS: Force feedback in games still immature; not USB; no support for DOS games.

"VIEWSONIC MB110 MULTIMEDIA MONITOR . REVIEW Good Looks, Bad Sound COMPUTER GAMING ARDWAR WORLD by Loyd Case ometimes in this business, I get to listen to people often very smart people who are unjustifiably proud of some of their product's features. Usually this pride COMPUTER GAMING WORLD is very sincerely felt-but it's still wrong. It's always a little disheartening to have to let them down. Such is the case with the folks from ViewSonic, and their MB110. First, the high points. The MB110 is a fairly high-bandwidth (200MHz) monitor capable of running 1600x1200 at a 76Hz refresh rate and 1024x768 at a rock-solid 110Hz. The MB110 looked fine running most test images, although there was a minor amount of moiré pattern noticeable and a bit of misconvergence at the corners. These very minor visual problems weren't noticeable in Windows 95 or in gameplay. The MB110 also has a four-port USB hub, something very handy for the upcoming generation of USB peripherals. The speakers are designed by the folks at Nakamichi, who should hang their heads in shame for having put out such a terrible-sounding set of speakers. There's a small bass unit (\"sub-woofer\") built into the swivel base, which also contains the USB hub. Two small satellite speakers are built into the front bezel. Viewsonic is pretty honest about the specs at least, rating the low-end roll-off frequency at better than 100Hz. Even that's a stretch. The speakers had no real bottom that I could hear. Worse, they sounded tinny, even with content lacking in bass. The worst thing, though, was an incipient 60-cycle hum that I could not make disappear no matter what did. All in all, I was relieved to turn off the speakers (easy to do, thank goodness) and use the unit as the ***** APPEAL: Users with limited desk space who prefer big screens to big sound. PROS: Solid 21-inch monitor with USB hub; good monitor specs. CONS: The speakers, oh, God, the speakers; large footprint. Price: $1,100 (street) Manufacturer: ViewSonic (800) 888-8583 highly capable monitor that it is. So what I would really like to do is give this monitor two scores: 4.5/5 for the monitor and hub, and 1/5 for the speakers. But I can't do that, so I'll just have to split the difference. But you may want to check it out anyway, because it's a very good monitor at a reasonable price, with the bonus of a four-port USB hub. Just don't plug in the speakers.

"INTELOGIS PASSPORT REVIEW sunt High-Voltage LAN Blog by Loyd Case he new Passport from Intelogis is one of those rare parts that gives you a fully functional LAN that you can have up and run ning in about 10 minutes. The hardware is pretty simple. You plug one end of the cable into your computer's printer port. HARDWARE passion Intelog's COMPUTER GAMING **** You plug the other end into the Passport. You then take the Passport and plug it into any o nearby 110V AC power unit-it doesn't even need to be grounded, though it should be polarized for safety. You may be wondering about your printer, but Intelogis is ahead of you—the company also gives you a special Passport unit for your printer. So you think, \"Okay, I've now used up three AC outlets—two computers and the printer. I'm running out of outlets.\" Well, then, just plug in the handy six-outlet surge suppressor that Intelogis thoughtfully includes in the package. The Passport works with single-, dual-, and triple-phase power, so most of the U.S. is covered. When you boot the system, Windows 95 (or 98) detects the Passport; it's a Plug-and-Play device. You pop in the driver CD, than a modem, but a lot slower than Ethernet. Ping times seemed unusually high, too-anywhere from 200 to 400 milliseconds. These ping times initially raised a red flag: As anyone who has played games over the Internet knows, 400ms ping times turn multiplayer gaming into the cruelest of tortures. Curiously, real gameplay showed no perceptible lag playing QUAKE Il or MECHCOMMANDER. The printer connector worked, too, but keep in mind that some printers require the PC's CPU for rasterization chores, and those won't work well as an independent network node. The Passport is an astonishingly simple product that works out of the box. If you've been hankering to connect a couple of PCs in your house for some deathmatch action, the Passport may well meet your network needs. CGW WORLD point it to the right place, and you're off. A few questions and a reboot later, and everything is running. During the installation process, a TCP/IP address is assigned to each system; IPX is installed and configured. Even fileand printersharing are automatically turned on. Within minutes, I had two PCS-a 400MHz Pentium II and a 200MHz Pentium MMX-communicating nicely. Intelogis won't win any performance sweepstakes, though. The Passport system is rated at a paltry 350Kbits/sec-much faster APPEAL: Gamers looking for easy multiplayer networking setup.

"REVIEW. SKYWELL MAGIC 3D II 12MB Voodoo2 on a Budget Even You Can Do Voodoo2 TARDW: (E220Yoodoo? Magic 3. Get Voodoo by Loyd Case few months ago, we looked at Skywell's Voodoo board. It had a couple of problems. First, it was nearly impossible to find in the U.S. though it did have some distribution in Canada. Second, it was one of the last Voodoo cards to be released; so all it really offered was low cost. Skywell is still a bit late this time around, but only because the field of contenders became so crowded so soon. The Magic 3D 11 is a solid implementation of the Voodoo2 reference design. It's also the first board to use 3Dfx's WHQL driver out of the box. That WHQL certification is a plus for users, because it means that the drivers have at least passed Microsoft's stress tests; but it did present me with a dilemma, because the WHQL driver doesn't have a setting to disable V-Sync. could have hacked together SST commands, but before I could boot up EDIT, Skywell's engineers shipped me a driver that did have the magical V-Sync Off checkbox. The company turned around drivers several times during the testing of the board—not because there were any problems, but to implement suggestions. This is a good sign. Skywell is, however, committed to distribution in the U.S., and will be creating a tech support staff as well. The board itself pretty much tests the same as most Voodoo2 boards. It's right in the middle of the pack for 3D GameGauge scores. The 3D WinBench 98 score seems high, but it's actually in line with other Voodoo2 boards when tested under PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS 3D WinBench 98 (800x600x16) 3D GameGauge (800x600x16) 98.2 57.4 84.1  Incom e Power 54.7 155.4 394.3 DirectX 6. Skywell doesn't build a clock-rate slider into its fairly generic control panel, but the company's engineers suggest that the board can run at 100MHz; savvy users can use shareware control panels or just set the SST environment variable to test clock rate. ! briefly ran it at 95MHz to run FORSAKEN, which will often lock up on overclocked boards, but it didn't happen with the Magic 3D II. The software bundle is pretty standard fare: INCOMING and G-POLICE. Still, for users who are just now dipping their toes in the Voodoo2 waters, this bundle will show off their new cards beautifully. Skywell is also thinking about offering a special SLI bundle, though pricing and availability weren't available at press time. The Magic 3D II is a fairly solid, reasonably priced 12MB Voodoo2 board that boosts game performance on Direct3D, OpenGL, and Glide 3D games.

May est known for DARKLIGHT CONFLICT, another jaw-dropper of a space-combat title, Rage attacks 3D arcade gaming with a style and attitude not seen since Psygnosis premiered on the Amiga back in the late '80s.

If you've always wondered what nerd terms like alpha blending or bilinear filtering mean, it's all here. Like any good arcade game, INCOMING has cheats aplenty.

"REVIEW HEART OF DARKNESS GAMING Short but Sweet Heart Arcade Adventure Like OUT OF THIS WORLD, Only Better EDITORS CHOICE by Thierry Nguyen ong development cycles coupled with huge amounts of hype are nothing new in this industry. But even considered on the BATTLECRUISER 3000 scale, HEART OF DARKNESS is a unique case: Announced in 1992, it's had little buzz since. After waiting six years for its release, you might wonder: How does it play? Very well...but briefly. HEART OF DARKNESS is based loosely on the Joseph Conrad novel of the same name. Both deal with a protagonist journeying into dark and unknown territory in search of someone. The game, however, takes a lighter approach, casting you as Andy, a boy with a lot of imagination. During an eclipse, Andy's dog, Whisky, is mistakenly COMPUTER GAMING WORLD seems simple enough...until you find you must bait a monster into pushing the buttons in the proper order for you. As in many platform games, these problems can require uncanny reflexes. You might walk into a room and find a pack of Shadows (as every kid knows, they lurk in the dark) itching for you, forcing you to duck quickly into an alcove. Alternately, you might have to dodge INTO THE LIGHT The cut-scenes in HEART OF DARKNESS dazzle the eye and hordes of fireballenhance the mood of the game. throwing Shadowbats kidnapped in Andy's place by shadas you cross a owy forces of darkness, leaving bridge.

"REVIEW  HEART OF DARKNESS CUTETAS WAT ACTION MACPLAY Heart Trouble So, HEART OF DARKNESS has great gameplay, great graphics, and great use of sound is there a downside? Yes. The game has a few problems, ranging from minor to significantly annoying. The first and most unfortunate problem is HEART's length. Eight levels of varying size make this essentially the FULL THROTTLE of platform games. Granted, each level is unique, with new puzzles and enemies, but eight levels aren't nearly enough. It's possible to finish the game in one night. Then there's the infamous console game save system. The game designates specific save screens, and whenever you die you're TWO OF HEARTS If you're prepared to experience some retrogaming and do some bargain-bin hunting, you might be interested in two earlier games from the HEART OF DARKNESS team. The classic OUT OF THIS WORLD is now part of Interplay's Signature Series, and you can order it directly from Interplay for about $10 if you can't find the original in stores. FLASHBACK: THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY is a bit harder to track down. Its publisher, U.S. Gold, was acquired by Eidos, and there seems to be no info available on purchasing a new copy: you'll probably have to scour the bargain bins at your local software store. FADE TO BLACK, EA's official sequel to FLASHBACK, went the 3D route and focused more on action, so be warned before you buy that title. ROLLING THE ROCK Puzzles call for unique solutions for a sidescroller. Here, Andy uses growing vines to break free, then gets rid of the guard by pushing a rock down the tunnel. such details as seaweed floating well integrated with the game. on water and leaves casting shadFor example, you're knocking Ows over rocks.

The designers have been slightly generous, in that the save screens are generally three to four screens apart, so HEART isn't as brutal as ABE'S ODDYSEE (which sometimes spanned nine screens between saves). The remaining problems are minor and depend more on individual taste. It would have been nice to see the game full-screen instead of taking up only 80 percent of the screen, with the rest bordered in black. Both cutscenes and gameplay are shown in this box format. Finally, some gamers may just get frustrated. Andy can die at any moment, and I often got stuck in one area for a while. The game will try to give you hints if it notices that you die repeatedly in one particular screen, but less-tolerant gamers might easily get aggravated and give up. Overall, HEART OF DARKNESS is one of the best games I've seen in DEEP BLUE SEA The eight levels cover varying environments, including lakes and a river of volcanic lava. If only they were all as long as this one is deep. a while. It's bug-free, has great gameplay, and achieves all this without 3D-accelerated graphics or multiplayer mode. Maybe it's nostalgia or the lack of a good side-scrolling platform game for the PC, but HEART OF DARKNESS ranks up there with great 2D games such as SUPER MARIO BROS. 3 and the recent CASTLEVANIA: SYMPHONY OF THE NIGHT. Too bad it's such a brief ride. CGW TIGHTROPE ACT Smooth and detailed animation behind the various sprites gives HEART OF DARKNESS a great sense of life but not at the expense of gameplay. 272 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"REVIEW. NAM Spittoon Platoon Lousy Gameplay Leaves Enjoyment M.I.A. in NAM Bar by Tim Carter n axiom of military history is that leaders plan for the last war, not the next. The downside to this is that the poor saps on the ground often end up fighting the next war with planning and equipment designed for the last. I'm not sure if this applies to the U.S. experience in Vietnam, but it certainly is true of GT Interactive's NAM. T HIET : 1, 8: 072 840 TL 2.342 Run Through the Jungle Slapping the Build engine onto a Vietnam setting, NAM's first-person action is technologically out of date in almost every respect. It's tough to shoot enemies with a screen resolution so bad you can't distinguish a tree branch from an enemy soldier. Then again, many enemies magically appear when Air Force menaced more troops than it supported. Air strikes aren't the greatest risk to players in NAM, since just about all facets of the environment are deadly and can strike without warning. Wounds I sustained from running onto barbed wire killed me at least three times, and I can't count the number of times I was shot, blown up, or otherwise killed by unseen assailants with little or no warning and absolutely no opportunity to react.

As long as those two franchises continue to excel, any golf game, especially a newcomer like FOX SPORTS GOLF '99, has to match their quality to win over gamers. This newcomer pulls off a couple of new tricks, but that's about it do to get there until the next shot. And if you don't hit it almost perfectly, you'll be lucky if the ball travels 20 yards. You can play with a traditional twoor three-click interface as well as the trendy mouse swing (here called the \"Fox Sports Swing\"). Each one works satisfactorilyuntil you have to putt from a short distance. Putt with ease from as far as 80 yards out on the fairway, but be prepared for the worst if you're within three feet of the cup.

"JETFIGHTER: FULL BURN . REVIEW Jetfighter Goes Hollywood Top Gun (the Movie) Meets WING COMMANDER SIMULATION SPACE don't have any real interaction with other characters and there are no decisions to make within the video sequences: You merely observe the action until it's time to stop yapping and start flying. by Jeff Lackey f you're designing a flight sim for hard-core fanatics, making it appealing is pretty simple (although it's not easy): Make sure you have the most detailed, accurate representation of every aspect of the aircraft's operation and environment. But what if you're after the casual gamer, the guy who thinks it would be cool to be Tom Cruise and be a fighter pilot in one of those F-something jet planes? Mission Studios aims JETFIGHTER: FULL BURN squarely at the fighterjock/movie-star aspirant by wrapping the JETFIGHTER flight-sim engine in a full-motion video narrative. A conflict between Russia and NATO has erupted over (what else?) oil fields in the waters off Norway. You play the part of either PAY ATTENTION, KIDS Briefing sessions precede each combat mission, with descriptions of the targets, threats, and other relevant information. COMPUTER Cleared for Takeoff The videos move the background story along, but the core of JETFIGHTER: FULL BURN is its flight simulation. If you've played JETFIGHTER III, the sim will look very familiar. The commands, graphics, flight models, damage models, and the like are all identical to the previous release. If that means that the simulation is some what dated, it doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, it's a pretty good system for flight-sim novices and even offers a few thrills for the hardcore PC pilot. You'll fly the F/A-18 and F-22N on the U.S. side, and the fictitious MiG-42 (loosely based on the MiG1.42 stealth prototype) on the Russian side. There are some small differences in the flight characteristics between the planes. However, controls are simplified to the point that once you've learned to fly one of the planes, you can fly them all. The cockpit instrumentation is a weak point: There is very little of it (just a very simple radar, waypoint information, and some basic armament and aircraft info), and the instrument graphics are so crude a brash young U.S. Navy pilot or a veteran colonel in the Russian Air Force. Videos set up the story from the perspective of the side you have chosen to play, and they're interspersed between your combat missions to advance the storyline. The \"movie\" aspect of the game actually works surprisingly well. The acting is not terrible (it's about soap-opera-quality), and, although the side plots are a bit thin, you still find yourself wanting to complete your combat missions successfully to advance the story. Scenes occur in several locations on your air base or carrier, such as the mess hall, rec room, your quarters, your CO's office, the hangar, and the briefing room. You can \"walk\" from location to location, but the novelty of this quickly wears off. Luckily, there is a dropdown menu that offers instant movement to any location. GAMING The story includes the progress of the conflict, of course, but you will also become involved in scenarios involving rivalry, personal conflicts, and a few surprises. Playing the U.S. and the Russian sides gives you completely different perspectives on the war. While you are in the role of the eager U.S. Navy pilot, the Russians appear to be war-loving monsters, while as the grizzled Russian veteran pilot, you hope that by retaking the oil fields that are rightfully yours, the economy might recover to the point where you can buy your small children decent food again. Although the collection of video clips that make up the stories won't make you forget Saving Private Ryan, the two sides of the same conflict are presented in a more thoughtful manner than one might expect in a casual, actionoriented sim. Unfortunately, you WORLD *** ** APPEAL: Flight-sim novices, virtual pilots more interested in storyline than state of-the-art realism.FULL BURI PROS: Immersive FMV storyline playable from both sides of the conflict great low-altitude feeling of speed; easy for novices to learn to fly and fight.

"REVIEW  JETFIGHTER: FULL BURN DOS Multiplayer in a Windows World ETFIGHTER: FULL BURN is a rarity these days, in that it is a DOS SIMULATION SPACE program. The result is that multiplayer support is only provided for IPX/LAN networks. If you have access to an IPX/LAN setup, you're ready to rock. But the casual gamer JETFIGHTER: FULL BURN is aimed at probably does not have a home network. Those players will need to check out a program called Kali (available at www.kali. net), which fools the game into thinking you and your multiplayer partners on the Internet are running on a network. Kali comes in two versions, DOS and Windows 95; you should download the Windows 95 version if that's your operating system (DOS games will run just fine). Once downloaded, follow the included instructions and you'll soon be chasing your buddies over Norway, While you won't be able to play the campaign, JETFIGHTER: FULL BURN'S IS THAT DONAHUE?

A famous jazz musician, when asked his opinion of rock music, said it was like a candy bar-not very complex or sustaining, but still quite enjoyable. That describes JETFIGHTER: FULL BURN pretty well: Hard-core sim fans may find it lacks STRATEGY SESSION Playing from the Russian side reveals a perthe meat they crave, but casual spective on the war that is very different from what is seen on gamers may find it to be just what the U.S. side. they're looking for.

Options include time limits, kill limits, ordinance packages, any of the three planes in the game (F/A-18, F-22N, or MiG-42), and re-supply rules. Testing for this review was done with two players, using kali 95 for Internet play, games were extremely simple to set up and resulted in very smooth gameplay. For a real adrenaline blast, try playing with guns only and an agreed upon ceiling of 500 feet.

"REVIEW. POLICE QUEST: SWAT 2 TRATEGYZWAR THE BAD...But this horrendous bank shootout isn't going to net many points. THE GOOD COP This officer makes his arrest... edge of the earth. This unrealistic game event is a major annoyance. Worse, it can take a huge bite out of your mission score. Although containment is certainly a problem for real-life SWAT personnel, it's a double whammy in the game. While a typical highrisk operation would feature a perimeter manned by uniformed patrol officers, SWAT 2 has none, even though we can clearly see the LAPD black-and-whites. Where did all the cops go? And that's not the only place where SWAT 2's badge is a little tarnished. The individual unit Al needs work. Picture this: A fiveofficer element of highly trained SWAT troopers executes a textbook room entry. Inside they con front a pistol-waving lunatic. We know who's going to win this confrontation, right? Not so fast, teargas breath. Without careful micro management, the suspect just might shoot a few officers and run out the door. Will your officers shoot back? Will they give chase? Not if you don't order them to. This is very strange, and detracts from the simulation. After all, these are veteran police officers we're deploying, not robots. Perhaps the oddest design deci sion is SWAT 2's treatment of wounded officers. When a unit member goes down, you can order another officer to do first aid-if he's equipped with a medical kit. If not, the wounded officer oozes life until the mission's end conditions are met. There's nothing more frustrating-or artificial-than watch ing a cop's health drain away while you desperately search for that last missing hostage in order to trigger the ending. Actually, this is just another side of the missingperimeter coin. In a real officerdown situation, surrounding police personnel would absolutely find a way to evacuate the wounded. members, you're in THE UGLY Veteran cops let the robbers get away, a control of an LAPD too-frequent occurrence in SWAT 2. helicopter, which is used for sur you can buy just what you need, veillance, or to insert personnel. artificially preserving your budget.

In addition to team iven the fact that LAPD's elite need to be told to execute even the most basic police survival skills, how can you command your personnel? A button-bar running vertically along the right side of the screen lets you pass orders along to the selected element or individual officer. After a little practice, using the bar becomes second nature, allowing your officers to crouch, rescue hostages, issue verbal challenges, disarm booby traps, and the like. A \"cover\" command directs your team members to go into an overwatch mode, monitor ing a suspect, officer, or hostage, and taking action against any threats. This helps alleviate the stupidi. ty level somewhat, but strange things still happen, even with cover employed. This appears to be a directional problem.

Sicill Cost: 375 Axe by Petra Schlunk f you're just starting (or restarting) a campaign in MIGHT & MAGIC VI, the thought that you may have to develop characters to Level 70 or beyond to complete the game is a bit intimidating. Before you rush head-on into another group of Goblins, spend some quality time fleshing out your party-this will save you a lot of aggravation later on. So, how does one go about crafting a proper party? For starters, it should be well balanced, with at least one character that can cast elemental spells, two characters that cast clerical spells, a cleric or sorcerer that can learn both light and dark magic, and, of course, someone with fighting skills.

A high-level dark master's Shrapmetal, cast up-close (so all the shards hit one monster), will nearly kill even the most powerful monsters in one shot. Clerical spells are mostly useful for healing, although Psychic Shock can do tons of damage against susceptible critters. If you don't want a balanced party-or just feel like trying some thing different-an all-spellcaster party can be exceptionally powerful. Just be sure to build up every. one's might, accuracy, and combat skills so they can fight when necessary, or you'll be going back to many saved games. bow skill for everyone at the guild next door. Don't forget to buy some bows! Return to New Sorpigal and train everyone up to Level 3. Now with everyone at a fair level and with bow skills to boot (a must for real-time ranged combat), you're ready to take off. The following order of suggested quests is based on what your party is likely to be skilled enough to handle at any point: Elemental, My Dear Elf Of all the skills possessed by party members, having elemental spellcasting abilities isn't just useful, it's often devastating to foes when elemental spells are cast in the right situation. As a result, at least one member of your party (and preferably two) should work toward achieving Water Mastery: The nearly permanent Lloyd's Beacons and Town Portal spells they gain thereby are invaluable time and sanity-savers. Also, make sure someone can cast Wizard Eye. which is an essential spell. Light and dark magic spells are also great, especially if you have a lot of characters that can cast such spells. In particular, dark magic offers the Armageddon spell, which can wipe out all magic-susceptible monsters in an LLOYD'S OF LIGHT A water master can place five longlasting Lloyd's Beacons throughout the game's many areas.

By now, your party should be able to handle all of the remaining areas (Sweet Water Paradise Valley. Hermit's Isle, Dragonsand). Make sure that your party completes all quests. Keep in mind that you won't destroy anything by completing a quest dungeon before getting a quest: you'll still find the quest items. Later, when you're given the quest, simply click on \"Quest\" again to get your reward. The only exceptions are that you can't complete Snergle's Caverns before completing Work someone up to water master as fast as possible (for Lloyd's Beacon and Town Portal). Someone should also become an air master for flying and a long-lasting Wizard Eye. Eventually work someone up in fire and earth. Clerical healing spells can be kept at a low level and still be effective. As soon as possible, have someone learn light and dark magic and work those skills up quickly. 4.

"StarCraft Protoss: the Few, the Expensive, the Powerful While the Zerg are prolific and the Terrans versatile, the Protoss troops are few in number and expensive to field. But the Protoss makes up for numeric inferiority with raw power and some very useful special abilities. WEWE by Elliott Chin | he Protoss player always needs to be thinking ahead, as the main problem with the Protoss is that their development tree is designed such that you have to make hard choices that set you on rigid paths. If you decide you want to build air power right away, you have to build a starport for scouts, but you temporarily sacrifice your ability to build shuttles at a robotics bay or to move toward high templar via the Citadel of Adun and the Templar Archives. However, by scouting out your enemy and making sure you have enough key units such as reavers and high templars—you'll be in good shape to handle most rushes and mount some devastating attacks. All Protoss players should beware the ghost's lockdown abiliProtoss Photon Cannon Detector MENU 0100 62100 WPA2 RELOAD THOSE PHOTON CANNON With the release of STARCRAFT version 1.02, photon cannon are finally useful. They are now good deterrents against marines and mutalisks, and tough against hydralisks and zerglings. Use them for defense. (such as those of the hydralisk and mutalisk), read our September strategy guide, which dealt with race-neutral advanced strategies and rush defenses. either in the form of reavers or psionic storms. Keep in mind that zealots cannot attack air units. ZEALOT A powerful melee unit that should compose the core of your ground forces. Research its speed and attack upgrades. Dragoon Zealo. ty and the science vessel's EMP shockwave. Every unit except for the zealot and high templar is vulnerable to the lockdown ability, and all Protoss units will be shieldless after a confrontation with a science vessel's EMP missile. Watch diligently for those two units. For tips on how to stop specific rushes Strengths: The zealot is an extremely powerful melee attacker and gives the Protoss an early game advantage. Just sending two or three zealots into a Terran or Zerg camp in the first five minutes of a game can often spell victory. Research their speed upgrade at the Citadel of Adun as soon as possible, as it makes the zealot able to close the distance with melee attackers faster, a necessity when facing siege tanks and hydralisks. Zealots in numbers are great for taking down siege tanks in siege mode, since they can survive a few shots and then close to melee range, where the siege tank can't fire back. Research zealots' first attack upgrade if you are facing Zerg, because then a zealot can take down zerglings with only two hits (as opposed to the standard three). Weaknesses: Terran firebats are a perfect counter to zealots: Beware them. If forced to face them, you'll want dragoons around to lend support, since dragoons suffer only quarter damage from firebats. Against hydralisks, you'll also need some artillery support Strengths: While the dragoon is the only early airdefense available to the Protoss, it is a pretty good anti-air unit against the Terran and Protoss forces. A dragoon deals explosive damage, so it can make short work of wraiths and provide punch against scouts. On the offensive, dragoons are best used in conjunction with zealots and high templars. In those instances, they are often decoys to draw See the Review JULY ISSUE. 5 STARS 338 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 om "


"STARCRAFT patch 1.02, you are better off building several photon cannons early to protect your base. sees her tgnien High Tema fire while the other two units deal the real damage. If you are going down the reaver path, then you need dragoons around for early air defense. In large groups of eight or more, dragoons can be useful, but don't try fielding a small force of them. Weaknesses: Dragoons have a slow rate of attack and are easily destroyed by marines, zerglings, and zealots (all small targets that can swarm the dragoon). Dragoons are also highly vulnerable to mutalisks and hydralisks, so you need support when facing those two units. If you are building dra goons in response to a sudden and massive mutalisk or hydralisk attack (in which case you are pumping them out one at a time), they will fail you. With STARCRAFT GAMER'S EDGE Strengths: The high templar has few hit points, no direct attack, and requires zealots for protection. Nevertheless, the high templar is the one unit that can save the Protoss. High templars are great for taking down hordes of units quickly with their psionic storm ability. One great way to employ high templars is to drop four of them off at your enemy's base via shuttle and then subject his workers to a psionic storm. Once high templars expend all their energy, they can then merge into two archons and Die o Profess H Tenga ARCHON While extremely powerful, the archon suffers from poor acceleration and limited range.

"STARCRAFT archon to a 10-hit-point weakling. Keep in mind that in order to create archons at a steady pace you need multiple gateways. Even with four gateways, you are producing only two archons, as opposed to six ultralisks that a Zerg player could create with just two hatcheries.

A high templars behind enemy lines and keep shuttle can carry your opponent off balance. either eight probes; four zealots or high templars; or two reavers, dragoons, or archons. Weakness: Unless you upgrade their speed, shuttles are outclassed by enemy flyers. explosion suffer no damage. Each scarab has to be built, but the build time is quick and the cost is a mere 15 minerals. When the reaver runs out of scarabs it cannot attack. Thus these units require babysitting. Use your reavers to demolish ground units. One hit from a scarab can tear up a cluster of hydralisks, zerglings, or Terran infantry. Reavers are best used to stop early hydralisk rushes. If you suspect a hydralisk rush, and your recon confirms that a mutalisk rush is not imminent, rush with reavers: They'll be able to put a stop to any hydralisk attack with only a few zealots for support against zerglings. Reavers are a terrific destructive force when they are backed up by Reaver Strengths: The reaver is a powerful unit that fires scarabs that deal 100 or 125 damage (depending on whether or not you have the damage upgrade). The attack also does splash damage, but it only harms enemy troops, even zealots standing in the middle of a scarab 1,130/37 REAVER This little unit is the bane of hydralisks and marines. Arch Pratos Observer Detene also use this strategy to draw the fire of siege tanks so your high templars can move to within range to cast psionic storm without getting attacked. Lastly, hallucination can also be used to simply puff up your forces and scare your enemy. The sight of a dozen carriers and archons can be very intimidating. Alternatively, you could use hallucination to feign certain attacks. For example, you could hallucinate some scouts to fool your opponent into thinking you are going to mount a huge air attack and then send in a load of zealots. Weaknesses: High templars are slow and have few hit points. Two shots from a siege tank will usually take one down, and hydralisks and marines can rip a templar to shreds while it tries to run away. Because the high tem plar has no attack, it really needs some support once it spends all of its energy. High templars are also vulnerable to the Zerg queen's broodling ability and the science vessel's irradiate ability. @ OBSERVER Recon is key, so build plenty of observers to compensate for the relatively poor Protoss reconnaissance ability. Keep observers near your scouts when facing cloaked wraiths. Strengths: The archon is the Protoss' most powerful unit. Because most of its durability is contained in its 350 value shields, archons can regenerate their \"hit points\" almost instantly. Several archons stationed near shield batteries constitute a very tough defense for the Protoss. Archons can attack both ground and air targets for normal damage. Their attack also does limited splash damage (half damage to all surrounding targets). Archons simply melt zerglings and Terran infantry and can neutralize mutalisks. Archons in great numbers are extremely powerful. Archons are also immune to irradiate and broodling abilities. Weaknesses: The problem with the archon is that it's slowso slow that many ranged units can get in a few good hits before the archon even closes to striking distance. Although the archon does have a ranged attack, the actual range is very short. Archons also suffer full damage from every attack since most of their \"hit points\" are shields (which suffer full damage regardless of the attacker's damage type). Be wary of science vessels and their EMP shockwave, which can reduce an Shutto ) Strengths: The shuttle starts out as a slow transport, although SCOUTS Like dragoons, these are best employed in large numbers, escorting carriers and hunting down overlords.

"STARCRAFT 1159 1608 Keep in mind that scouts do only half damage to mutalisks. Also, they are fodder for cloaked wraiths, so always accompany your scouts with observers if you foresee engagements with Terrans. Their ground attack is weak, although it deals normal type damage. Still, marines and hydralisks will cut down scouts unless you have a large group of them. Like dragoons, scouts are best used in numbers. GAMERS EDGE against the mutalisks. If you plan to use them, be sure to upgrade their speed first and then their attack and armor. Also, use scouts in great numbers, in which case they become powerful hit-and-run attackers. With their speed upgrade, scouts can run in to do some damage and then retreat to base to replenish their shields. The right combination of shield batteries and judicious retreat to use them can make scouts an annoying and effective attacker against your enemies. Because they do explosive damage to air units, scouts are great against wraiths, battlecruisers, science vessels, carriers, arbiters, guardians, and all transports. With their speed upgrade, scouts achieve the fastest acceleration of all air units and can move as fast as wraiths and mutas. Scouts make good escorts for carriers, since they can fire off their missiles faster than a carrier can muster its interceptors against incoming scourges. Weaknesses: Without their upgrades, scouts are slow and vulnerable to scourges and mutalisks Carrier 50 CARRIER This awesome siege engine can tear apart ground troops and buildings. Watch out for battlecruisers and ghost lockdowns, however. Scouts archons and psionic storms. Drop a reaver into an enemy base's resource area early in the game to wreak havoc on your foe's supply lines and resource gathering. Weaknesses: Not only are they expensive, but reavers also cannot attack air units. Reavers need dragoons around at least, and preferably high templars and archons, to lend air defense. If you notice your foe is building toward mutalisks, don't build reavers. Strengths: Carriers are amazing siege weapons with good range and a devastating attack. Fully upgraded, the carrier's eight interceptors can combine for 64 normal damage. Carriers are best used in numbers and can decimate all ground troops with ease. These massive ships also make quick work of missile turrets and photon cannon and can take down buildings as fast or faster than zerglings. If you plan to use carriers, you must research their capacity upgrade Strengths: The scouts are the basic flying unit of the Protoss. One-on-one, they are superior to the Terran wraith and Zerg mutalisk. They will cut down wraiths, but have a harder time 1630 1 36/170 Obserres Strengths: Observer units are vital when playing against Terrans. Without the observer, cloaked wraiths can be very deadly to your troops. Observers have low hit points, but they count as small targets and are permanently cloaked. Even so, don't rely on a single observer for detection purposes. Attach two or three to your scout squadrons or troops so that if one is destroyed you still have back-up detectors. Weaknesses: Observers are pretty slow, so you should upgrade their speed. They have no attack and will die easily when detected and attacked.

GAMER LEDIGE MY COMPUTER'S TOO SLOW! THIS GAME SUCKS WHY CAN'T I GET THROUGH THIS DAMN LEVEL? HOW DO I DO THIS? WHY WON'T THIS WORK? With their default capacity of four, carriers are a waste of money, but with their upgraded capacity of eight they become a force to be reckoned with. Weaknesses: If you are fielding sin gle or low numbers of carriers, hydralisks and marines will cut them down. Also, battlecruisers win in a head-to-head match because of their heavy armor. Remember that armor on enemy targets mitigates the attacks of every interceptor, so with each point of armor, the target is suffering four or eight less damage (depending on your carrier capacity upgrade). Carriers are highly vulnerable to a ghost's lockdown ability. They are also expensive, so you'll need to have several expansion bases going in order to support a carrier fleet. a shuttle, and give it the power to neutralize masses of enemy troops. Once you build an arbiter and research recall, you can instantly teleport a large group of troops to the location of the arbiter. In this way, you can drop troops any. where onto the map or pull troops out of battle instantaneously. The arbiter has the following special abilities: Recall: Recall allows you to teleport a 3x3 matrix worth of troops to the arbiter's current location. As many as 16 zealots (that's four shuttles' worth) can thus be dropped into an enemy base with the click of a button. The recall takes about a second to occur and if the arbiter is destroyed before the recall is complete, the troops will simply stay at their original location. The obvious use of recall is to transport troops into enemy territory, but it can also be used to pull your own troops out of losing situations. Locked-down units can be recalled, although units in a stasis field cannot be. Stasis Field: This ability is a great way to neutralize enemy hordes. It basically freezes an area's worth of troops for one minute. Although you cannot attack units in stasis, neither can they attack you. A stasis field affects troops only and won't freeze missile turrets or other tower-type buildings. Use stasis fields prior to attack to freeze enemy guards, then recall your troops into the Tired of Losing? Arbiter Strengths: The arbiter is a great unit that, unfortunately, doesn't come until late in the game. However, if you can get it, the arbiter will give you some excellent abilities. Even though the arbiter is a spellcasting unit, it does have an attack. The arbiter's natural ability is a cloaking field that cloaks all of your units except for other arbiters. As long as that arbiter is alive, all units under it are invisible.

You can also use a stasis field to protect your own troops from damage (from a plague, irradiate, or a nuke). What's more, units in stasis cannot be affected by special abilities, so if you place a plagued unit in a stasis field, it will not lose any hit points, and when the stasis wears off, the unit will no longer be plagued.

Once you have set the type and extent of the upgrades you want, those upgrades that do not require research are purchased, starting with the cheapest. If you decide to custom-pick your upgrades, you could almost re-create the old MAX system by only buying upgrades that don't require any research, and limiting your choices so you don't spend more than you have. Anytime you see a \"Yes\" appear in the research column under custom upgrades, that level of upgrade won't be available until you've researched that category, though any upgrade \"steps\" before then will be available. You can tell how much gold is in your pool by selecting a gold refinery (the number to the left of the slash is how much you have, and the number to the right is how much you've spent so far). PSI-SPAWN Shock tanks are hard to kill. It pays to run these into massed enemy formations as kamikazes, especially infantry. They're great on defense, making rushes less appealing. SHOCK TANKS The Sheevat Most Sheevat units do not kill directly. They cripple, disable, or impregnate the enemy. They get the job done eventually, but the more you plan ahead, the more likely you are to get the kill. You should build at least two incubators immediately, if the scenario setup allows you to. Send them out to \"harvest\" any alien life-forms quickly. Incubators give you a way to get lots of free troops that are cheap to maintain. The downside is that your supply of spawn is limited to the other life-forms and enemy infantry/infiltrators you can reach. Also, computer players will go after any neutral life-forms they find, so the clock is effectively ticking as soon as the scenario starts. On a one-to-one basis, Sheevat units are more durable, and their direct-attack units are more potent, than those of their human/Concord counterparts. The negative is that Sheevat units have weak armor, and they can't be repaired, although they do heal rapidly. They also have strong shields that reach full strength a few turns after hatching, so keep They are faster and more durable than their infantry counterpart. Like infantry, Spawn may be used to spot invisible units. Remember to keep Spawn together. They gain strength in numbers. SPAWN The Concord Concord units are hideously expensive in both power and material. They can neither be repaired nor upgraded, but they do learn and improve as they kill. Building a few Concord units to serve as a backbone for your forces is a good idea, but their cost does make it difficult to field a full army of them.

"MAX 2 Humber s to clear SI GAMERISED 566640 mande Control: Sheevat-style Too often overlooked, the Mark command unit is a powerful force in the struggle against the oppressive Concord COMMAND UNIT race and not just because the command unit is a direct extension of the Sheevat will. The command unit is not only useful for facilitating communication among near by Sheevat forces, but is also essential for coordinating any offensive. As a result, you should build several command units and position them at all potential avenues of attack along the front lines. Each command unit provides the following advantages: boosts attack strength of friendly Sheevat units by one-third increases shields by two-thirds; improves hits by 10 percent; boosts speed by 25 percent; reduces power requirement to only four. 33-33 RECYCLING FOR PROFIT Always build at least one bulldozer and use it to recycle wreckage and trees for a significant boost in material. With two bulldozers working, you can even operate at a moderate material deficit. command Since command units are relatively weak in terms of their own combat effectiveness, it would seem obvious that you should leave them well behind the front lines. This overly safe strategy, however, robs you of the added offensive punch they give you by leading from the front lines. Take your chances, and just make sure that you have some AA batteries around, newborn units out of battle until their shields have been able to harden completely. Use the higher Sheevat durability to your advantage. You can take Sheevat fighters up against humans knowing you'll win; just be sure to move the victors away to a quiet area to heal. Tanks Check In but They Don't Check Out When you're playing against the computer, you can pull several tricks. Computer units will always shy away from player units that can hurt them, even if those opposing units have no shots left. They also run away from detection by radar so long as you have combat units in the vicinity. Computer opponents also look for and will seize upon any opportunity to cause mischief. They love the quick raid. If you have built lots of ground units and are lacking in antiaircraft defense, you can expect to see lots of groundattack aircraft. They will try to slide around your AA defenses until they find a breach, close in and destroy as much as they can, then disappear as soon as any mobile AA or fighters appear. Knowing this, you can set traps for the computer. Deliberately leave an area uncovered by AA and let the computer's aircraft in. Then, close the door on them with spare fighters or AA units that you've kept just outside of the Al's detection range. You can pull a similar trick with ground units. First, have all your long-range shooters-assault guns, rocket launchers, and missile crawlers-advance just half their movement. (You can even cheat a little and move some missile crawlers and rocket launchers their full allowance.) On the next turn, move your radar scanners or scouts forward quickly. Because Al units like to lurk just on the edge of your radar range, they may cozy up to an assault gun or rocket launcher's radar horizonmaking them roadkill when your radar units move forward and surprise them. Since the scan and weapon ranges are the same for both tanks and infantry, this tactic doesn't work nearly as well against those units. Not to beat this tactic to death, but you can also clear out mobile AA units by sending an assault gun or two toward them. They will flush before you get in range. While they're scurrying away, the AA guns are no match for your ground-attack aircraft. As the Concord player don't panic if the Sheevat get a little aggressive with their command units. Remember that MAX 2 rewards those gamers who know how to use combined arms, and be sure to plan your attack accordingly. Note that the infantry shown here are thrown into the breach and are taking heavy losses but they're cheap, so why worry? After the Concord tanks take out the enemy antialr umbrella, all those wonderful Aven units at the bottom of the screen will fly in and take out the Sheevat command units. -Terry Coleman and Samuel Baker II Prepare to Assault Assaulting prepared positions is difficult in MAX 2. You will likely have fewer units than in MAX, and any losses you incur take 35Z COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 . "

Cost Per Turn Structure Power plant Factory Constructor Engineer 21416 Taking advantage of the relative lack of enemy long-range firepower, I set my trap, keeping my mobile scanner well back. sacrificial lambs. They are almost as cheap as infantry, move faster than tanks, keep their shots when moving (if they should live so long), and, most important, have a large scan range. By sending a scout in first, you often discover another set of enemy turrets out of range of your scanners that would julienne your assault. Prepare your forces for the attack by carefully positioning them just past the range limit for your target. Turn on the fog option, so that you can clearly see which squares are in range. When everyone is in position let one turn pass, so that all units will have their full movement allowances available. Make sure you have fully reconnoitered the area. AWACS play a key role here, letting you scout behind the offending turrets to check for hidden traps. The computer loves to build turrets with interlocking fields of fire. Trying to clobber one position may put your forces in range of another. Assault guns are the best units to use to take out turrets because of their high speed and long range. After the sacrificial infantry or tanks have died you can move in several assault guns to kill the turrets. Figure on using at least four assault guns for every turret you're taking out. Use any fewer and you can't be assured of a kill. Rocket launchers can be a reasonable second choice, depending on the circumstances. They have greater range and a large blast effect, but poor mobility. They can move only three squares and still fire in clear terrain. Air units are just too expensive in terms of time and material to trade for enemy AA turrets. So, the best technique for removing enemy AA turrets is to sacrifice ground units. While it may seem expensive at first, burning several tanks or scouts to take out a single AA turret is a good trade, because it almost always lets you immediately destroy several missile and artillery turrets with your ground-attack aircraft. The same tactics may be applied to sea warfare, using subs as both scouts and sacrificial offerings. Build lots of escorts, subs, and corvettes, along with a few missile boats and gunboats for backup. The escorts protect the subs and scan for targets, the corvettes protect the escorts from subs; and the subs do most of the dirty work. Missile boats and gunboats are needed for shore bombardment, and they're just plain fun, besides. CGW Then, it's a simple matter of technique to take apart the enemy formation, even though I have only two assault tanks. This approach lets you get the most out of minimal heavy firepower, and works well with small to medium forces. much longer to replace, since you generally have fewer factories. When you must break through to take out an enemy facility you have little choice but to sacrifice units. Good volunteers for this heroic action would be scouts, infantry, and tanks, in that order. Infantry are cheap and can be replaced quickly. Tanks are more durable (though still cheap comp ared to aircraft and assault guns) and are somewhat faster. Scouts are perhaps the best choice as 356 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 WO "

When you engage a group of enemy units, have your cavalry occupy them and have your priests convert the strongest enemy unit. If the enemy is tightly grouped, convert a unit in the middle of the pack. He will immediately start attacking his former comrades, and vice versa. Your priority for conversion of enemy units should be as follows: elephants (a must!), followed by academy units, siege weaponry cavalry, archers, and, finally, barracks units. When employing priests, pray that your opponent uses elephants. They are easily converted, are really hard to kill, and do an incredible amount of damage to surrounding enemy units. When you're going out to confront enemy ships, use twice the number of priests at once (four) to increase your chances of converting them. This is necessary because ships are twice as resistant to conversion as other units. My Tower, Mine, Mine, Mine If there are any towers in the area, have your cavalry units attack them to draw their fire, and then send your priests up to convert them.

Don't forget that your priests can heal your other units. After you convert that hard-core elephant archer, heal him to full strength before sending him back into battle. Healing does not deplete a priest's conversion energy, and if you tell a priest to heal an injured unit in a group, he will continue to heal the rest of the group, including siege weaponry. culture than it is to convert that culture's units.

In that vein, here are some helpful hints: CYBERSTORM 2 The biggest choice in the game is whether to play in turn-based or real-time mode. Still, there are certain general principles that will help you, regardless of which style of play you prefer: Use terrain wisely. High ground gives you offensive and defensive bonuses, and obstacles not only give cover, they also can channel attacking units into a narrow zone where your entire force can fire on them one at a time. You are likely to meet superior forces at many points during a campaign. Make sure your units are fast enough to run away in the face of overwhelming firepower. A running battle can stretch out the enemy, allowing you to take on his faster units first and the slowpokes later. When you are in a position to destroy a strong enemy unit, make sure that your second and third units fire through shields that were overloaded during the first attack HISGSdn sdm sam sam sdi sain sam 1. The autosave feature in BEAST WARS is even lamer than in most console-to-PC conversions. Make sure to save your game after every episode, or when you die you'll have to replay all of the levels since your last save. 2. Rockfalls aren't invincible (unless you're in beast mode). Just make sure to get a red weapon power-up before attempting to clear the rockfall. OVERSEAS 3. While it seems that you usually choose your Transformer based on little else than looks, you should select one with higher energon resistance, especially when you are learning the game.

"the TLC folks stated publicly that they weren't interested in socalled \"niche\" games. But they are interested in some games, because TLC purchased Broderbund in August for $420 million, including the Red Orb games division. This seems like a fairly generous amount, considering that Broderbund's more than $607 million in sales for the past three years have resulted in a mere $31 million in profits-a return of less than 5 percent. The lure of being the publisher of MYST and RIVEN along with CARMEN SANDIEGO probably swayed the execs at TLC. As yet there hasn't been a decision whether Red Orb or Broderbund will survive as brand names. In the meantime, production continues on PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D and other Broderbund/ Red Orb titles. WARLORDS III: DARKLORDS RISING just shipped prior to press time. -Terry Coleman READ ME For Sale: Cendant Software Troubled Cendant Puts Sierra, Blizzard, and Berkeley on the Block Cendant Software Units Sold As of July '98:........9,500,000 Sales Revenue as of July '98 ......$215M Source: PC Data midst the late summer corporate feeding frenzy, one of the biggest game-publishing conglomerates suddenly found itself up for sale. Giant consumerservices company Cendant Corporation announced its intention to either sell Cendant Software (including Sierra On-Line, Berkeley Systems, and Blizzard Entertainment), or take the company public with an initial public offering (IPO). Both possibilities appear remote right now, since most game companies don't have the resources to purchase Cendant Software, and recent stock market volatility drastically reduces the chances of a successful IPO. That's the short version on what's up with Cendant Software. The future of its game companies doesn't appear to be in jeopardy, and the eventual takeover or IPO probably won't have a significant effect on projects in development. However, such situations often make personnel nervous and we've already seen key Blizzard employees leave for more stable situations. Since Blizzard has launched three million-plus sellers in a row, that's a key consideration in any valuation. To understand more about the convoluted history that led to this point, and how Cendant's future may affect your favorite games, read on. It's a rather strange and complicated story. You are probably aware that CUC acquired the interactive game companies comprising Cendant Software during 1996—97. CUC's purchase of Davidson & Associates for $1.15 billion included Blizzard Entertainment, which Davidson had acquired in '94 for only $6.75 million. CUC then acquired Sierra On-Line for $1.06 billion and Berkeley Systems for $20 million. CUC's total software companies holdings totaled roughly $2.316 billion. The game companies weren't a perfect fit for CUC, which offered direct-mail membership discounts for travel, shopping, auto, dining, and other services. However, CUC was probably interested in the game companies' poten tial for capturing thousands of new consumers online via game registration, as well as fueling their vigorous e-commerce site. CUC, in essence, markets directly to consumers, and new consumers like John Q. Gamer are like vast natural resources waiting to be tapped. Last year, CUC changed its name to Cendant Corporation when it merged with Household Finance Services. (HFS owned Century 21 and offers mortgage services to home buyers.) The company was experiencing strong growth, the economy was good, and everything was going swimmingly. Then, all hell broke loose: On April 15, Cendant Corporation announced that it had discovered \"potential accounting irreqularities and undertook an investigation. Auditors discovered that more than one-third of the total income reported by CUC during the period from 1995-97 was \"deliberately and fictitiously manufactured,\" to the tune of $500 million. The investigation discovered that CUC's former CFO and Controller were guilty of fraud, and they were terminated. (Charges are pending against them.) Meanwhile, the company's stock fell like a stone, plunging to depths from which it has yet to recover. Since then, Cendant has undergone the accounting equivalent of a wire-brush enema. Despite the company's intention of refiling its squeaky new financial statement in August, the SEC still wasn't satisfied and decided to use Cendant as a case study in how to refile formerly cooked books. Now the company plans to refile in September. division worth, and who would be the likely candidates in an acquisition? in the two most recent game company acquisitions, The Learning Company's acquisition of Broderbund and Hasbro's purchase of MicroProse, buyers used a multiple of between 1 and 1.3 times current revenue. By this method, some industry insiders have estimated Cendant Software's net worth at $700-800 million-one third of its original purchase price. At that valuation, it is unlikely that Electronic Arts, GT, Activision, or any other single interactive entertainment company has the resources to purchase Cendant. Which leaves Microsoft and other large software companies. Even here, though, suitors aren't plentiful; except for Microsoft, most software companies have little experience or interest in gaming. Many are struggling desperately to retain market share and keep their margins up, and the recent stock market turmoil has limited their stock swap options and eroded their overall values. \"There are fewer numbers of buyers than there were in the old days,\" observes Larry Marcus, financial analyst with BT Alex Brown in San Francisco. \"Many of the more traditional companies—more media companies and not technology companies-have realized that you really do need a lot of focus to be success ful in this business. Which leaves an IPO as the most probable outcome of Cendant's interest in divestment. It's difficult to speculate on when an IPO might occur, but it's unlikely to take place in the foreseeable future. Which leaves Blizzard, Sierra, and Berkeley with the prospect of a very uncertain future. -Ken Brown, with assistance from Johnny Wilson in the role of Ben Bradlee. So Why's the Games Division up for Sale? When a company's stock takes the kind of beating Cendant's did, it looks for ways to improve its basic financials. The fastest was to do that is through the sale of assets. Cendant Software was never part of Cendant's core business, and the company probably perceived it could recoup at least $1 billion by divesting itself of our beloved game companies. Which finally brings us to the two key ques tions facing Cendant Software. What is the www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 371 "

Their Finest Hour (LucasArts, 1989) WWII sim with great campaigns, realism, and many Crew-member options. The Bard's Tale (EA, 1985) Pioneered three-point animation, 3D color mazes, and auto-mapping. Lemmings (Psygnosis, 1991) The lovable cartoon Lilliputians were hits on every platform. TIE Fighter (LucasArts, 1994) Most satisfying Star Wars space-combat game to date; lets you live on the dark side, Battle Chess (Interplay, 1988) The Franklin Mint of computer chess games, with violent and funny animation disguising a solid chess engine.

Master of Orion (MicroProse, 1993) Remarkable diplomatic Al: deep and varied technology tree; aliens required radically different playing styles. Ultima Underworld (Origin Systems, 1992) The first truly 3D RPG, and still the most convincing; its dungeon walls are nicely \"painted\" with texture-mapped graphics. Day of the Tentacle (LucasArts, 1993) Offbeat sequel to MANIAC MANSION; the interactive equivalent of a classic Chuck Jones cartoon. Mech Brigade (SSI, 1985) Improved KAMPFGRUPPE system for modern armored battles. War in Russia (SSI, 1984) More realistic than EASTERN FRONT, it captured the essence of the largest land campaign in history. DOOM (id Software, 1993) Revolutionized PC action games and network gaming now surpassed in technology, but not in gameplay. MechWarrior 2 (Activision, 1995) A serious treatment of Mech design and resource management, combined with complex and addictive battles, legitimized \"giant robot simulations.\" WarCraft II (Blizzard, 1996) More cerebral than most real-time strategy games, it offered deceptive depth and personality to spare. Dungeon Master (FTL Software, 1987) Trend-setting graphics, digitized stereo, and great hack and-slash from a decade ago. Might & Magic (New World Computing, 1986) First-person, maze-based RPG with huge environment and tough combat Wasteland (Interplay, 1986) Derived from Mike Stackpole's Mercenaries, Spies, and Private Eyes, this is the definitive postapocalyptic RPG.

Panzer General (SSI, 1994) Entertaining wargame with an elegant interface, great campaigns, strong Al, good graphics, and impressive sound. Wing Commander II (Origin Systems, 1991) Darker story, grittier feel, sound card advances, and tougher Al made this a sequel of sequels. F-19 Stealth Fighter (MicroProse, 1988) A \"thinking man's\" sim, with great missions, in which sneaking around is as fun as dogfighting. Red Baron (Dynamix, 1990) WWI air combat with great graphics, incredible realism, and a versatile replay feature. Wing Commander III (Origin Systems, 1994) Surprisingly satisfying FMV space-opera didn't lose the essence of the space-combat game.

Gettysburg: The Turning Point (SSI, 1986) First variable order of battle changed the look of all American Civil War games on the PC. Sid Meier's Pirates (MicroProse, 1987) Combines pirate adventure, action, RPG, and strategy to make the most successful hybrid of all time. X-COM (MicroProse. 1994) Premier tactical squad-level engine combined with alien tech research and pop culture for a sci-fi game nearly as addictive as CIVILIZATION Gunship (MicroProse, 1989) Great character continuity, R&R for fatigued pilots, and even sick leave; best chopper fare until Jane's LONGBOW. Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon (MicroProse, 1990) SIMCITY meets 1830, with robber barons for emphasis. You Don't Know Jack (Berkeley Systems, 1996) Fresh and irreverent, Jack turned trivia gaming on its collective ear to become the first mainstream CD-ROM with a gleeful gameplay bite. Harpoon (360 Pacific, 1989) In-depth modern naval battles in realtime, based on the world's Cold War fears. Sim City (Maxis, 1987) Urban planning with fascinating consequences and challenges; the first great software toy. Kampfgruppe (SSI, 1985) Its WWII East Front armor battles were a success on multiple platforms. Starflight (EA, 1986) Depth, great characters, and a good sci-fi storyline set early RPG standard. Zork (Infocom, 1981) The progenitor of adventure games on the PC, its humor and challenging puzzles seem timeless. The game has since spawned a number of sequels, none of which has equaled the original. 584 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "

"ON THE CG-ROM The Demo Deli Sample Some Meaty Specialties From CGW's Kitchen How to Use the Disc The CD is Autoplay-enabled and should begin upon loading it into the CD-ROM drive. Otherwise, from the Start Menu in Windows 95, type D:STARTUP.EXE (where D is the letter of your CD-ROM drive) to run it straight from the CD. Additional help is in the README.TXT file in the root directory. Many demos require the disc to be in the CD-ROM drive in order to run; therefore, we recommend installing the demos from our disc. To Get the CD-ROM To subscribe to the CD-ROM version of the magazine, call (303) 665-8930. If you already receive the magazine without the CD, you must wait until your current subscription expires before receiving the CD version. Please address subscription complaints to cgw@neodata.com. Neodata is a magazine fulfillment house which is not owned or operated by ZD, Inc. This month's disc lets you try out 15 new games that are now available or are soon to be released. The feature demo is Novalogic's F-16 MULTIROLE FIGHTER, B1200220 the latest sim developed in cooperation with LockheedMartin. This exclusive version of the demo lets you fly both a standard combat air patrol and an inter3001 992 ception mission. 3960 Military buffs should crack open the demo for 01311101110110 TalonSoft's WEST FRONT, the sequel to EAST FRONT. D1110022 The demo takes you back to Bloody Omaha, the beach portrayed in Saving Private Ryan, fighting from either the Allied or German perspective. See how long you last. We definitely recommend the demo for JAGGED ALLIANCE 2, which appears to be a solid sequel to a great strategy game. You'll control a team of mercenaries who have to check out a \"factory\" that is troubling the town of Demoville. If you just want to get down and dirty, check out SIN, the new first-person shooter crafted by Ritual (makers of the acclaimed SCOURGE OF ARMAGON mission pack for QUAKE). You'll get to man a helicopter turret and blast your way into a bank robbery in progress. For more realism, check out DELTA FORCE. Fans of DIABLO and WARCRAFT II will want to see RAGE OF MAGES. Moto RACER 2 is there for the bike racing fan, and you can fly into space PRODUCT NAME with the ARES Rising demo (and tank commanders who like the multiplayer experience might want to check out TEN and Ares Rising its companion game, WULFRAM). Gamers who remember Delta Force GAUNTLET can play GET MEDIEVAL, and if you want to try your Earthlink hand as firefighter and paramedic, try out EMERGENCY: FIGHTERS FOR LIFE. Strategy gamers will want to try both Emergency: Fighters for Life WARGAMES and 101st AIRBORNE, and gamers who like a bit of F-16 Multirole Fighter both strategy and action should load up URBAN ASSAULT.
