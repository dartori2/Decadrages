"With Friends Like Us... Do Editors Pander to Their Friends and Skewer Their Enemies? EDITORIAL I'm beginning to think that I'm perceived as a Don Corleone figure by some of these industry leaders. \"All I wanted was to be your friend, but because you have shown me s uch disrespect I must cause your products to sleep with the fishes.\" that just doesn't make sense. If we, as editors, target specific companies and individuals and review their products based on something other than the products, our credibility will fail.

This edit is not merely to fix grammatical errors, but to ask questions of the article. \"Is the idiosyncrasy a design flaw or a feature? Does the reviewer have a blind spot? Is this criticism fair in light of the design and state of technology? Is this merely a concern to the reviewer or is it relevant for most of the audience?\" Sometimes, this requires conversations with the reviewer to hash out all of the details. Sometimes, changing the copy to reflect a more precise wording is necessary. Fourth, all of the editors who have played any of the game formally consider the recommended rating from the reviewer. The main You would be able to tell if we had a vendetta against a company. newspaper reporter who developers in the industry.

With surparties with the people prise, I reminded him of how long you cover on one night and write a critical article about them the next day. I protested that his argument was based upon his work experience, in which people were often the issue, and suggested that there was a tremendous difference when product is the issue. I said that good people can and do make bad product. I insisted that I could like people and not like their products. I observed that I had been to numerous industry parties or events where games were touted to which we later gave bad reviews. The product is what counts. Last year, I played golf with a CEO who is well-known in this industry. I discovered that he had we had been friends (recognizing thought for years that I didn't really that we both have equivalent dirt like him. He thought his products on each other) and of how many had gotten negative reviews good, bad, and mixed reviews his because I didn't like him. Strangely company had gotten over the enough, I do like the guy and that years. Every time, I pointed out, never factored into the reviews. we reviewed the product and not Why? Because our duty is to you, him or his team. the readers, not to the people we Yet, my biggest shock in this like in the industry. area was reading an online posting Recently, I was out with the from a major talent in game design co-founder of one of the great who dismissed our criticism of his product as tabloid-style sensationalism from a magazine that hasn't liked him or his com pany for a long time. During the calendar years of this alleged vendetta, his company won a disproportionate amount of Game of the Year awards (using an award:title ratio) and The way some industry leaders talk, his company got more you'd think I had the power to make CGW covers than any their games sleep with the fishes. other company Here is the editorial process we go through in order to see that each product, no matter what we think of the people at a given company, is treated fairly. First, we seek to match the game and the reviewer. There is no point having a person review a soccer game if he hates soccer. Likewise, we wouldn't use a person who doesn't know anything about the sport. There must be both interest and expertise in the subject matter and style of the game. Second, we expect the reviewer to play the entire game. There is no way to adequately judge the play balance, pacing, and fatiquel frustration factor in a game other than to play it. Sneak previews aren't based on play-balanced, paced, and finished code, so we don't require the previewers to finish the game. However, it is vital for reviewers to do so. Third, a section editor (the editor with expertise within a given points of the reviewer's criticisms are considered and debated among the editorial staff before the final rating is set and the review is published. Sometimes, two or more editors will go back to play the game to settle a given point. The rating is not decided until a consensus is reached. This philosophy protects you from the possible prejudice of one reviewer, one editor, or one editorin-chief. The process reduces the probability of one person getting so angry at one program, one company, or one person in that company that it transforms a review into a hit piece. Our goal at Computer Gaming World has always been to provide the most balanced coverage possible. In fact, if someone asked us to have a vendetta against a company or individual, we'd have to answer à la Don Corleone, \"That I cannot do! You asked for justice. This isn't justice!\" CGW www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 23 "

"Myth Busters LEMAN Myth Busters Stories That Aren't Fit to Print, but Circulate Anyway very year has its share of pseudojournalistic bits about the computer gaming industry. My favorite from 1997 had several journalists-none of whom had evidently I played a game prior to 1995-questioning whether Sid Meier (who gave us PIRATES, RAILROAD TYCOON, F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER, and a number of action games) could design a real-time strategy game. As these \"scoops\" get repeated, gamers who are usually rational start worrying, and fevered debates dominate many a newsgroup. 1998 is no exception, and so my holiday gift to you is a bucket of cold water. I hope you find dousing these \"burning fires\" as refreshing as I did. most comfortable when analyzing sales trends from two years ago. (Remember-these same retailers were still embracing the 8-bit console market up to the last feeble twitching of its death throes.) If we are to believe the sales figures, more than three dozen RTS games lost money last year. While this situation is alarming, it has more to do with lack of design talent than anything else. Most of the bad RTS games were you're going to be suffering some serious withdrawal pains. If you can show a little patience, you'll be fine. FIGHTING SAIL looks to be everything that GREAT NAVAL BATTLES wasn't, and Grigsby and Brors are hard at work on STEEL PANTHERS IV. ever really in the wargame business, which is admittedly a bit of a stretch. I-Magic's sales have never threatened to eclipse those of TalonSoft or SSI, even with quasihistorical titles such as SEVEN KINGDOMS. I-Magic did publish the GREAT BATTLES OF HISTORY series, of which JULIUS CAESAR is still worth a look. The odd thing is that while I-Magic has given up on bringing the rest of the Great Battles boardgame series to the PC-a real shame for fans of Samurai in particular (where are the Koei guys when you need them?)—it is using the Erudite Software engine from GREAT BATTLES for a totally new game, NORTH VS. SOUTH. CEO Bill Staley can talk all he wants about crafting \"mainstream hits\" since l-Magic went public, but the truth is that the company needs sales and cash Myth #5: The Industry Is Doomed For the past several years, various Wall Street pundits have complained to everyone who would listen that the computer gaming industry was doomed by \"bad business models.\" The truth is, wherever you have vulture capitalists, panic follows soon after. Aside from companies like CUC-which claimed, in a fit of creative accounting, to have lost money with back-to-back millionsellers WARCRAFT II, DIABLO, and The retail industry always feels most comfortable when analyzing sales trends from two years ago. Myth #1: Turn-based Games Are Dead Rubbish. Anyone who has enjoyed MIGHT & MAGIC VI knows that a lot of the game's appeal comes from having both turnbased and real-time modes. As we go to press, PEOPLE'S GENERAL IS selling well, and I doubt that EA will demand anytime soon that SID MEIER'S ALPHA CENTAURI have a real-time option. On my most recent road trip, 9 of 12 publishers had a turn-based strategy game in development, and the other 3 were considering turn-based titles to balance out their product lines. Look for titles like CHAOS GATE, JAGGED ALLIANCE II, and BIRTH OF THE FEDERATION to snap turn-based games out of the doldrums. flow. Call it what you will, but a Civil War game is a wargame, and if NORTH VS. SOUTH sells halfway decently, I-Magic will certainly do more titles in the series. so unoriginal that they'd be just as awful when played turn-based. In any case, whenever you have a fresh idea combined with challenging gameplay, your product sellsas the megahits STARCRAFT and AGE OF EMPIRES show. The real question is this: Can RTS games successfully break out of their C&C/WARCRAFT emulation mode or will they grow increasingly stale and lose momentum? A good litmus test will be how well MYTH II and AGE OF EMPIRES II do. Myth #4: SSI Is Getting Out of the Wargame Business The funny thing is that this almost happened five years ago. If the original PANZER GENERAL (PG) hadn't turned into a big hit, SSI was all set to go with sci-fi and fantasy titles. Without PG, there would have been no STEEL PANTHER series and, likely, no TalonSoft. Now, the question is one of degree: If you expect SSI to crank out 10-12 wargames a year, you'd better be dusting off your copy of AGE OF RIFLES because STARCRAFT—anyone who puts money into a software venture (especially a PC game) and expects to get it back in a year, complete with interest, is doing some drugs they should share with me. It's regrettable that companies make mistakes and go out of business, but change is a good thing. My guess is that in years to come, the industry will continue to grow in fits and spurts, and you'll see more small outfits pop up. I hope they won't all be indentured servants of EA or Microsoft, but they'll be around. And the best of them will crank out games that surprise us and aggravate us and keep us up late at night. May all the games you get under this year's tree do half as much. CGW Myth #2: Real-time Games Are Dying More rubbish. The recent poor sales of several real-time strategy games (RTS) have alarmed the retail industry, which always feels Myth #3: l-Magic Is Getting Out of the Wargame Business First, you have to assume that the folks from North Carolina were www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"LETTERS Targeting Canada BAD DAY? our October issue had a disturbing ad for a Psygnosis game called GLOBAL DOMINATION (page 103). The ad says \"BAD DAY? Take it out on Canada (no hard feelings, eh?).\" I'm Canadien and I know lots of people who are Canadien who subscribe to your magazine, and we're not ready to take this kind of crap. Some of them are considering canceling their subscription to your mag (not me), so you guys and the people at Psygnosis should lay off the crap about Canada because you might lose some of your subscribers here. We're not holding you guys directly responsible but blaming you a bit for putting that dumb ad in the magazine. -Hugh Jass Via the Internet Take it out on Canada (no hard feelings eh?) BE COMING SOON 29 Johnny Wilson responds: Your letter confirms the dreaded rumors we had heard of the demise of a Canadian sense of humor. We didn't want to believe it. Canada has been the source of some of our best humorists and some of the freshest television comedy. Yet, it seems that some Canadians don't understand the ridiculously hyperbolic nature of the GLOBAL DOMINATION ad. For the record, I did not have the opportunity to review the ad, but even if I had I wouldn't have rejected it. Also, for the record, I think the Canadian National Anthem is FAR better than the U.S. national anthem; the Canadian government's approach to the arts is far more enlightened than that of the U.S., that the Canadian Rockies are more impressive than the U.S. Rockies; that lacrosse is more exciting to watch than golf (heck, curling is more exciting to watch than golf); that your House of Commons is more interesting than our House of Representatives, and that Montreal will once again be a great hockey team. Incidentally, what kind of a name is Hugh Jass? Sounds like one of Bart Simpson's phone pranks. \"Is there a Hugh Jass there?\" Synergistic Software Your November Read. Me article (\"For Sale: Cendant Software,\" pg. 371) failed to mention another \"important entity\" that was affected by the CUC takeover of Sierra On-line et al: Synergistic Software. Synergistic was founded in 1978 by Robert and Ann Clardy The company produced more than 150 titles, including THEXDER and SPIRIT OF EXCALIBUR, and more recently BIRTHRIGHT and HELLFIRE, the add-on for DIABLO. CUC's acquisition of Sierra precipitated the disintegration of the Synergistic division-which was purchased by Sierra in 1995last year. However, the founders are currently in negotiations to form a new development company, working title \"Eclectic Games.\" Loyd Worship One of the best features of your magazine isn't printed on gloss stock.

I've been a reader for years as well as a subscriber. wanted to know what games! should buy hopefully in time to avoid buying garbage, so I turned to you. I've also been a bit of a system builder to support these games. Over the past six months, I've been building my own version of a cross between Loyd's No Holds Barred and Lean Machines, as my budget permits. Using the components in these machines as a loose guide I built a machine which, by all accounts, should keep me happily gaming for another two years. I ran each important part by Loyd Case. Despite his busy schedule, Loyd added his two cents where appropriate and eased my mind about what I was about to buy. Last week, I bought the last piece of this system, the CPU, I was thrilled! I'd been testing the system previously with a borrowed CPU and all went well. BUT, with the new CPU I was getting errors. Through lots of research, phone calls (no thanks to Microsoft's \"support\"), and sleepless nights started to see a light at the end of the tunnel. That light was amplified when Loyd gave me his insights as well. In the end the problem was resolved (Ultra DMA requirements, Seagate Medalist Pro 6.5 GB drive, integrated IDE, and of course MS Windows 98 all played a part). 1 would like to formally thank Loyd Case and Computer Gaming World for their parts in getting my system online and ready to play.

While flipping through November's issue, I came upon Empire Interactive's ad for 101st Airborne in Normandy. What immediately struck me was the shield insignia, a United States flag. Gone was the trademark screaming eagle of that most famous WW II airborne unit. I checked back issues; sure enough, the screaming eagle appeared in all previous ads. Where did the screaming eagle insignia go? Can you make a right turn off the elevator and ask sales why the eagle was replaced? I also spotted Advent's ad in the November issue. After seeing the picture of the woman chained and collared like an animal, 1 deep sixed my Advent speakers and went shopping for a different vendor.

No, most likely you'd be trying to hit a skyscraper with a bus you just picked up. SLAVE ZERO lets you do this and then some, in gigantic, futuristic city environments teeming with targets-er, life. The amount of activity is dizzying, with screaming pedestrians, speeding vehicles, swooping attack helicopters, crumbling structures, and, of course, other giant robots. At the center of this maelstrom is you, part of a larger rebellion force striving to wrest control of the city away from an evil dictator. The odds seem hopelessly stacked against you ever since the development of the dictator's Slaves, huge biomechanical combat units. Fortunately, you just happen to get hold of one and thus begins your destructive march toward peace. While the design team has solid roots in the giant robot arena (director Sean Vesce was lead designer for MECHWARRIOR 2), the focus in SLAVE ZERO is on action and interactive environments instead of the sparse environments in most giant robot sims.

"Angel of Death README REQUIEM Lets You Smite Your Foes the Old Testament Way Here's why it wouldn't be much fun playing SLAVE ZERO as a pedestrian. The city will present plenty of opportunities to exercise your bloodlust. raving some good old fashioned, \"eye for an eye\" biblical retribution? Then REQUIEM: AVENGING ANGEL might be the manna from heaven you've been waiting for. After a group of rebellious angels (the Fallen) sets out to destroy mankind, the Big Guy himself selects you to go straighten things out. As the angel Malachi you take on human form to square off against the Fallen and their hideous minions. REQUIEM's thunderous action sprawls across 30 levels based in such realistic locales as power plants, hospitals, refugee camps, and cities, as well as the more fantastic environments of space stations and the gore-slicked bowels of Hell. You'll be confronted with enemies such as demons, mind-controlled soldiers, and the Fallen themselves. While we only had a limited alpha version to play, all the enemies displayed a daunting viciousness sure to satisfy the run-and-gun crowd. REQUIEM will also feature lots of NPC interaction as a core facet of gameplay. Conversations with ordinary citizens will flesh out the plot and open up new levels. Scripted scenes executed in the game as opposed to rendered cut-scenes will also provide hints and story details. It should add up to a more engaging world than the average shooter. With the usual assortment of machine guns, grenade launchers, and sniper rifles, REQUIEM'S weapons likely won't strike anyone WHEN IT RAINS IT POURS Get rid of enemies as special. It shouldn't matter faster than you can say \"Sodom and Gomorrah\" gamers will be too busy using by turning them into pillars of salt. Malachi's angelic powers to notice. There are about two dozen different powers, both offensive and defensive, and they will be what truly defines REQUIEM. Enemies can be turned into crumbling pillars of salt, set upon with stinging plagues of locusts, torn apart by divine lightning, or have their blood boiled until they convulse, squirt blood, and explode into meaty chunks. Defensively, you will have shielding powers, an enemy-repulsion capability, and the ability to resurrect the dead to fight on your side. Cyclone Studios has developed their own engine to drive the game, and it's looking good. The bloody halls of Chaos pulse and are scabbed with the twisting, tormented bodies of moaning penitents; lighting effects enrich explosions and fireball-like Brimstone power, and some especially cool particle effects make the Turn to Salt power a thing of malevolent beauty. Throw in eight-player deathmatches and multiplayer options that could include pitched battles between teams of Chosen and Fallen, and REQUIEM: AVENGING ANGEL has the look of a winner. Look for it to hit the shelves in early 1999. Robert Coffey meticulously detailed animation, the team spent several months creating the Ecstasy engine to drive the game. Judging from what we've seen, you couldn't ask for much more. The Slave animation, in particular, is spectacular, with a fluidity of movement that lends this behemoth an almost simian grace. The single-player game takes place from a thirdperson perspective. While not having a first-person perspective for this sort of game might seem odd, watching your alter ego violently stomp through the world is a large part of the fun. There will be 16 missions, each with specific, uncomplicated objectives. The missions will grow from being mostly ground-based to emphasizing the vertical nature of the game's towering cities. Accolade is being tight-lipped about level locations, but expect at least one acrophobic nightmare of rooftop-leaping combat and a slimy wade through the city's cavernous sewer system. Multiplayer specifics are still being hammered out, though straight-ahead deathmatches are definitely planned. The team is considering other options, including one mode where players will have to forgo weapons and instead battle by throwing cars, trucks, and anything else they can grab at each other. We're really hoping this idea makes the cut. Slated for a late Spring 1999 release, SLAVE ZERO is one of the most promising action titles on next year's horizon. Look for more car-stomping, building-ripping coverage in CGW's upcoming cover story. Robert Coffey Boil a bad guy's blood and watch him pop like a blood-gorged tick.

"READAME The Battle For Shelf Space A Cool Quarter-Mil Helps Ensure You See That Game December Game Sales Year Dec '92 Dec '93 Dec '94 Dec '95 Dec '96 Dec '97 Dec '98 (Est). his Holiday season, as you await new games with visions of cyborgs dancing in your head, distributors are struggling desperately to put those games in front of you. Each year there are many more new games competing for about the same shelf space. Since three-quarters of all games sold are purchased in stores, and December sales can account for onefourth of a game company's revenue, all the ingredients are there for an ugly fight. \"It's a competitive bloodbath,\" says Allan Blum, chief operating officer at Gathering of Developers. \"I don't know of any other industry that has this kind of environment.\" Blum refers not only to the competition for shelf space, but also the competition among retailers to undercut each other. \"Most clothing retailers carry different brands, but software stores all carry the same thing,\" he says. \"All they can do is try to beat each other on price.\" In their zeal to lure customers with lower prices, major retailers often wind up cutting their own throats, according to Ann Stephens, veteran retail analyst at PC Data. \"Retailers as a whole are selling games at no markup, on average.

Many haven't. In the last five years, one-third of software retailers have sought credit protection under Chapter 11. And while most big retailers have mail-order wings and online sites, online sales still represent a small fraction of total units. According to Stephens, most people who use mail order are buying expensive business apps. The average game retail purchase is $30. Retailers do, however, manage to make money. Much of it comes from a special premium they charge to shelve a game in quantity. This is gaming's dirty little secret: nearly every game company pays hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure you see their title in stores. All the major players pay in the range of $50,000—75,000 per retailer for end-cap space during December, according to numerous sources. These fees, known as Market Development Funds (MDF), are where the retailers are making money on games, according to Stephens. \"It's the grocery store model. But there are a lot of problems with that model—if a retailer isn't making money on titles, there's no reason to care what they stock.

How about delivering a compelling story along with the mayhem? How about creating a believable, realistic world then distorting it so wildly that the gamer shares the protagonist's confusion, surprise, and fear? How about creating a rich gaming environment loaded with interactive objects and people that, instead of being simple props, enrich and define play? These are the sort of things that the shooter genre has been FLATLINE HALF-LIFE generates a lot of its characters and immersiveness from cinematic grace notes like this scientist who is desperately trying to revive this guard. Cory THE GREAT OUTDOORS Just because most of HALF-LIFE is grounded in reality doesn't mean it's visually dull. Sweeping outdoor locations and spectacular explosions help make it a graphically rich game. complex, a decommissioned underground missile base. During a slightly less than routine day, an experiment goes terribly wrong, ripping a cross-dimensional portal to an alternate universe. Unfortunately, the creatures on the other side of the gateway have a keen interest in interdimensional real estate and a disquieting propensity for violence. Since monsters continually enter the now-devastated complex, you must make your way to the surface-killing monsters; CIA operatives sent to erase all evidence of the incident (including you); and government agents planting explosives to destroy the base. It's not just your life at stake: If the government succeeds in blowing up the base, all those nuclear warheads they've forgotten will create some freshly irradiated beachfront property in Missouri. While this sounds like a traditional \"you against the world\" shooter plot, HALF-LIFE's execution sets it apart. The game opens with a long tram ride as you enter Black Mesa. Movie-style credits flash by as you descend into the complex, riding through deep canyons, cavernous interior storage areas, and winding tunnels. When the credits end the game begins, but not with the bulletspraying bang of other first-person shooters. Instead, you leisurely make your way through the facility, chatting with fellow scientists and perhaps dropping by the coffee room on your way. After you don your HEV environmental protection suit you make your way to the lab. Security guards engage you in small talk as they open airlocked chambers. HALF-LIFE spends lacking, and it looks as if HALFLIFE is set to deliver them.

The payoff comes after the dimension-shredding accident. With Black Mesa torn apart by explosions and rampaging monsters, you head for the surface seeking rescuers. It's no easy trip since the familiar, almost mundane, world of just moments ago has been irrevocably altered into an unknown, chaotic interior landscape-a mangled maze of collapsed walls, plummeting elevators, and wildly firing lasers.

Stop moving for awhile and the guards will start talking to each other about their chances for survival. All this realism is great, but it wouldn't be a shooter without targets. Never fear: HALF-LIFE serves up plenty of uglies to shoot. Valve isn't tipping its hand too much on this, but the limited build we played was stocked with skittering crab creatures, mutated scientists, that their saviors have arrived. They are then cut down in a hail of automatic gunfire that lets you know the supposed good guys are, in fact, very, very bad. It's a particularly effective method of keeping the gamer deep in the game while creating the same sense of panic and confusion that the protagonist would be feeling. Foreshadowing is also used, with a sinister looking, briefcase-toting create a believable world, and nowhere is that more apparent than in its use of NPCs. More than simple window dressing, the people in HALF-LIFE are as knee-deep in the game's mayhem as you are, and they react to what happens around them.

"HALF-LIFE Q&A With Valve's Managing Director, Gabe Newell SNEAK_PREVIEWS Q: HALF-LIFE's action and story play out in a cinematic fashion. Did any films influence or inform HALF-LIFE? A: Originally, HALF-LIFE was inspired by a Stephen King novella, The Mist. About the only things in the game that really remain are the combination of horror and technology shared between the two, and the designs of the Bull Squid and blind tentacle in the Abandoned Silo area. There's a lot of Jackie Chan in the Assassin character, and there are bits from Full Metal Jacket and Aliens in the game. A: I was talking with Warren Spector at ECTS about this topic. I was talking about how we had this seamless world without any explicit levels, and he started laughing at me. He said something like \"I bet you have to give people a lot of explicit structure, and you're eliminating nonlinear elements in your designs as you playtest.\" And I said, \"Yeah,\" and he laughed some more and said, \"Been there, done that.\" With DEUX EX, Warren's being even more structured with the player's experience. The hard part is to give players a lot of freedom without them feeling that they are missing all of the cool stuff, that the freedom they have isn't trivial, and that they have a sense they're progressing through the game. I think it is certainly possible to do this, but it's probably going to take a magnitude more of content to pull it off, plus a pretty thoughtful design. Q: Most storytelling is an essentially linear process. Why do you think no one has capitalized on the essentially linear first-person shooter model to tell an involving story? A: We're not entirely sure since both the press and fans have been asking for this for a long time. I think what's happened is that the amount of work necessary to carry it off is so daunting, that even when people set out to integrate a strong storyline, they end up giving in to time pressure along the way and skipping everything it takes to make that possible. To put that in perspec. tive, the script for HALF-LIFE is about twice as long as a typical movie script and doesn't include all of the synthesized audio generated during the game. salamander-type creatures. Valve has put a lot of work into the monster's Al to make them even more challenging. Marines use cover fire and hide behind objects, houndeyes are most effective in packs, OOPS, I ACCIDENTALLY TORE and some monsters use REALITY Sure it's pretty, but this is sound and scent to the tragic experiment that lets all track you.

CGW Q: While HALF-LIFE will support TEAM FORTRESS 2 after it's released, what other multiplay options will we see in HALF-LIFE? What is going to set its standard deathmatch apart? A: There are two things we've been working on: making HALFLIFE multiplayer less frustrating and making it more fun. The first thing we are addressing by making it easier for people to find and get into games and by looking at weapons design issues to make multiplay less lag dependent. We're making HALF-LIFE multiplayer more fun by having a variety of game modes and game rules-beyond just deathmatch and cooperative play. LOOT is one of the games that Dario Casali has designed; it's sort of a cross between capture the flag and hide-and-seek. Q: One of the coolest things in HALF-LIFE is the ability to interact with other people in the game to get scientists to heal you, to have security personnel help you fight. And while there's also interaction with the environment, the game path is basically set-your actions add flavor to the game but don't have any real, tangible effect. With flight sims now featuring dynamic campaigns, when do you think we might see a dynamic shooter, in which the consequences of our actions actually affect the progress of the story/game path? Is this even possible? Q: What's next for Valve? A: Our big focus is going to be on getting TEAM FORTRESS out the door, then there are some technology issues we want to look at for a bit. We're actually itching to begin work on the next generation of games. Q: Finally, who's that evil, corporate guy in the suit? A: You won't find that out for quite a while in the game. But he is a pretty evil bastard. 66 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "

"Myth II: Soulblighter This Groundbreaking Game Continues to Distinguish Itself SNEAK_PREVIEWS FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN This hillside battle spotlights two of MYTH Il's chief features—the increased importance of magic-users and the use of fire. grass on fire wherever they land. Units take damage from the fire as it spreads across the ground. But be careful: Your units are just as vulnerable to the flames, so you'll have to watch out not to get caught in your own trap. Bungie has also added animated polygonal objects, such as drawbridges and giant moving wooden gates. These features will be used to a great extent in MYTH II, and they add a new level of realism. In one scenario, you must escort a peasant through an enemy-infested forest to the safety of a town fort before the gates close for good. In another, you must assail a castle with a working drawbridge. Get caught with too few units after it closes and you can expect to have arrows raining down on your head from the tops of the walls. Magic will play a part in MYTH II, as well. For example, after you successfully get all of your units to the drawbridge at the castle, you become an invisible dwarf who must sneak in a back door and up to the ramparts to destroy the winch that opens the drawbridge. After it is destroyed, your men can charge in and start chopping down everything in sight. Magic-users in MYTH II will have unlimited magic powers, but the catch is that they have a \"mana\" bar, which is building or object) missions, and escort missions. by Joe Vallina omeday, MYTH: THE FALLEN LORDS will be recognized as the beginning of the end of 2D real-time strategy games. It was Bungie's first big PC hit (the company was formally know for its Macintosh games, such as MARATHON), and it was also the first real-time strategy game to take full advantage of a 3D engine, letting you swoop down and around to view the beautifully rendered gameworld. Of course, that's not to say that everything you saw in that glorious 3D imagery was pleasant. Au contraire, visions of dwarves chucking molotov cocktails into a massed group of zombies and Burn, Baby, Burn Far and away, MYTH Il's great est addition is the use of fire. As promised, your archers can now use flaming arrows to start fires that can encircle your enemies. By pressing the T key (used to activate a unit's special ability)your archers' normal arrows switch to flaming projectiles that set the subsequently creating little piles of charred hamburger can hardly be called picturesque. But gamers reveled in the gore, and reveled further in the way that MYTH'S 3D world brought them closer to real combat than ever before. Well, my fellow heroes, MYTH II: SOULBLIGHTER adds many new features to MYTH'S 3D universe and, if all continues as planned, it could pound the final nail in 2D strategy's coffin. The story is set 60 years after your character kills Balor in MYTH. Soulblighter, one of the original Fallen Lords, has enlisted some humans as well as some really nasty creatures. He wants a new war, and guess what? You're just the hero to give it to him. In the demo build I played of MYTH II, five new single-player scenarios were working (along with two multiplayer levels), all designed to show off the game's new features.

Great for laying down withering barrages to soften up ground troops, mortar dwarves can also take down castle walls and other structures.

A magically animated suit of armor, the Stygian Knight is a medium melee unit with a definite advantage over the average warrior. They are not to be taken lightly. Warlock Mysterious, shadowy characters on the periphery of the war, the warlocks have chosen to fight on the side of the living. While their motives are unclear, their effectiveness is not-the warlocks' fireball attack harms everyone and everything it touches.

"Railroad Tycoon II Pop Top Pulls Sid's Masterpiece Out of the Can SNEAK PREVIEWS that, when released almost a decade ago, put a new twist on train management. And it was every bit as unique and almost as addictive as CIVILIZATION. Given the game's classic status, it's fair to ask who would be designing the sequel-since not just anyone is worthy of carrying Sid's gym bag. Enter Phil Steinmeyer who, like science fiction and comics author Peter David, does his best work in other people's worlds. Steinmeyer will forever be by Terry Coleman ike Myers may not be a genius on the same scale as Charlie Chaplin, but he certainly has a good sense of timing. Myers' Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is in many ways the quintessential movie for the near-millennium because it allows you to totally immerse yourself in goodnatured retro chic. With the current deluge of remakes in every creative medium from TV to film to books, it's hardly a surprise that computer games are also rapidly trying to reinvent the wheel—though the PC equivalent of Austin Powers has yet to be made. DI TYCOONTI Des 1874 125 DEDINBURGH AREA OF EFFECT Zooming out over the grain belt, you see the number of small towns that spring up along the lifegiving rail line. A major city like Edinburgh, however, functions as a trade hub and industry center for England and Ireland, as shown by the various buildings dotted around the railyard. Gare TYCOONT 123 12 E Channeling Sid Even Sid Meier is vulnerable, contracts and licenses being what they are, to having his classic works reinterpreted by other designers. When you look at the vast catalogue of games by Sid Meier, you'd expect PIRATES! to be redone or maybe for there to be a new stealth fighter game, but RAILROAD TYCOON? After all, you don't build railroad stations and immediately start pumping out hundreds of railway cars, smashing them up against your enemies' trains in the center of the map (although that might have a certain guilty pleasure appeal). Well, RAILROAD TYCOON isn't in the CGW Hall of Fame solely for nostalgia; it's an engaging game remembered as the Man Who Saved HEROES OF MIGHT & MAGIC from self-destruction. A low-budget product, HEROES, and its flashier sequel, HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC II, turned out to be two of New World Computing's biggest hits in years. When MicroProse, evidently in one of its desperate attempts to generate cash flow, started shopping around some of its legacy titles, Steinmeyer jumped at the chance to remake one of his favorite games. railroad games. Sure, MicroProse released RAILROAD TYCOON DELUXE-upgraded to stunning VGA!-about three years ago, but RAILROAD TYCOON II is the way Sid would have wanted this game to look. Without requiring a 3D card, the design team at Pop Top has managed to create a vibrant 3D world of track and rail ANNIHILATION than MYTH, which is a good thing given the level of detail. Even with a Pentium II 400, it would be difficult on a scale as large as that of RAILROAD TYCOON Il to run multiple trains and stations in a MYTH-style environment with any kind of frame-rate, much less have any processor bandwidth left for the multi-level Al.

"Enemy Infestation Ripcord's Intergalactic Bug Hunt Could Be X-COM's Successor SNEAK PREVIEWS by Robert Coffey lien menaces and realtime combat have one big thing in common-both are overused in today's strategy titles. That's not to say these are bad things; on the contrary, if these ideas didn't have some real appeal they wouldn't keep cropping up. It's just that too many games can't execute interstellar war and ticking-clock combat in a fresh or innovative way. ENEMY INFESTATION hopes to change all that illegal Aliens Taking place well in the future, the game opens with millions of alien pods desperately fleeing a dying planet in the hope of finding a new world to call their own. While most of the pods fail to survive the trip, a few land on a planet colonized by mankind in order to feed a starving Earth. With numerous settlements on the planet's surface as well as vast underwater farms, it seems like the perfect place for the mysterious Mantis race to wreak their particular brand of terror. Taking place from an isometric perspective that's part X-COM and part CRUSADER, ENEMY INFESTATION (EI) charges the gamer with controlling small squads to combat the alien threat. Most of the game takes place in and around various installations on the planet, including polar icemining facilities, research centers, and underwater farms. Unlike the rather cookie-cutter locales in the X-COM series, El levels are pre a lengthy checklist of goals, each provide characters with new rendered and showcase some member of your team (up to 12 knowledge, all for the price of truly inventive touches, including men) should play a vital role in reading a book.

Particularly useful and entertaining is the \"hide\" order-perfect for ensuring that your weak medics and physicists cower behind recharging stations at the first sign of trouble. With many of the battles taking you by surprise, you'll need to make use of these standing orders to protect your teams and just generally stay on your toes. More than once I thought I was safe and relaxed my guard only to be set upon by clawing packs of aliens. While El doesn't let you create formations, you will have to properly place units in a room to provide adequate defense in case of an ambush. canch PLOT POINTS Not only do the mission briefings fill you in on mission goals and tips for completing them, they also advance ENEMY INFESTATION's twisting storyline. Tell Me What to Do A rather straightforward, mouse-driven interface will let you issue orders and direct troops. One impressive feature is the abil. ity to construct a complex series of waypoints by simply holding down the \"Shift\" key while click ing. Even actions can be dictated in this manner, making it possible for you to direct a soldier to walk through several rooms, pick up a gun, recharge it, open a door, go up an elevator, and attack a specific alien. The only interface stumbling block I ran into in the beta version I played was actually getting control of individual units. El's narrow corridors and crowded rooms often made it difficult to click on a specific unit, and the unit portraits in the interface bar were similarly tiny. Hopefully this will change before the game ships. Fortunately, both individual and grouped units can be bound to hot-keys. You can give standing orders such as \"guard\" or \"fight\" to direct a unit's behavior when tiveness.

Alleviating a bit of this stress is a handy interface item that lets you know if there are any undiscovered weapons or items in a mission and, if so, how many. Unfortunately, it stops short of telling you where to find themthat's up to you. Gamers who found the last XCOM game's lack of multiplayer support disappointing will be happy to know El will support multiplayer games out of the box. Up to four players are supported in cooperative mode only, so forget about squaring off against your friends. With any player capable of controlling any unit in the game, it will be interesting to see how this works in practice. Still, it's an idea whose time has clearly come. ENEMY INFESTATION shows real signs of promise. In the beta version I played it was apparent that some Al tweaking still needed to be done. But the rest of the game seemed pretty solidexcept the voice-acting. We can only hope that the voice-acting! heard was a temporary fix until Ripcord got around to hiring some real actors. Slated for release in time for the holidays, El might just turn out to be a pleasant surprise on the crowded real-time strategy front.

"ORIGIN KTS eaonline GROWING SNEAK PREVIEWS NBA Live 99 SLAM DUNK There are now more moves, fiercer dunks, and realistic facial expressions. Lockout Be Damned, EA Sports Is Set to Release Another Outstanding Game WOLL83 89 years ago I wasn't much of a sports game fan, but one play of NBA LIVE 96 and I was hooked. The fast action roped me in, and the rest of the game's polish and depth kept me a fan forever. In most respects, NBA LIVE 99 stays true to previous editions of NBA LIVE and, on the face of it, doesn't play all that differently. However, a better engine, greater graphics detail, an enhanced AI, and several other gameplay tweaks have elevated this game to a new level. By Elliott Chin s we go to press this month, the NBA lockout is still standing firm, and the beginning of the season is in serious jeopardy. So why don't we care? Maybe because we've been playing a beta of NBA LIVE 99, EA Sports' latest version of its great basketball franchise. NBA LIVE's blend of fast action and sports simulation over a hidden mass of stats is an award-winning combination that has won over many fans, including me. As recently as a few DYNASTY With the new multiple-seasons play, you can build a basketball dynasty to rival the Bulls. almost feels like you're watching an actual NBA game. The way the players do crossovers, pivots, and other moves adds to the feeling of controlling lifelike players. When the announcer starts off a game, you see your players stream ing out of the locker room, highfiving each other, jogging gingerly up to center court, or rotating their arms for last-minute stretches. And, of course, the animation is really nice for the lay-ups and dunks. While many of the dunks in LIVE 99 look similar to those in Beautiful Lay-ups The first thing you notice about NBA LIVE 99 is the improved graphics. The animation and motion capture for the players on screen is amazing. While not quite as fluid as the animation in FIFA 98 or the upcoming FIFA 99, NBA LIVE 99's animation is so good that it previous versions of the game, they're even more detailed this year. You'll see Ostertag hanging for a few seconds on the basket, swinging left and right a little and then dropping down to the ground. If you go for a replay, you'll even see his mouth open and his face turn into a visage of determination-thanks to the more detailed engine. And when he finishes a particularly good dunk, you'll see him celebrate by waving his hands in the air and pumping his fist.

"NBA LIVE 99 SNEAK PREVIEWS TAKING IT TO THE HOLE! NBA LIVE returns with better graphics and Al and with more detailed players. Not only does the new engine add moving mouths to the game, but it also brings 3D faces to life. All the players now have expressions, which are most noticeable in the lineup screens-you'll see the players smiling or scowling. Sometimes the expressions look goofy, but other times the realism is eerily fascinating. The 3D faces also look amazingly like the real players' faces. Rodman looks like Rodman, and Kukoc looks like Kukoc. It's uncanny the way the engine can deliver such accurate looking faces. (During the game, however, the resemblance tumbles a little.) The new engine also more accurately differentiates the sizes of players. Now, big guys like Ostertag and Smits look huge compared to tinier players like Muggsy Bogues. Another addition to LIVE 99 is a new practice mode. Currently, practice mode puts you on an outdoor court where you can prac tice your dunks and special moves, such as the all-new fake moves and fake shots. While practice BRING IT!

As the ground rushes toward you, you realize you're heading down an unsafe speed. But you've worked too hard for this kill to give up now. One final burst and you start to pull up.

I could drop planes into an arena and they would engage in realistic furballs. More extensibility will come from Parsoft's Open Plane Interface. The developer will document the formats and flight model structure for the sim's aircraft, so thirdparty developers will be able to create new planes. However, they won't be doing an actual plane editor. And after having had a few of Parker's intriguing flight physics discussions go skyrocketing over my head, I don't think creating new planes will be a task for the uninitiated. I hope an enterprising third-party developer like Game Tool Technologies will come up with a user-friendly plane editor. FIGHTER SQUADRON has enough unique features to stand out from the pack.

"SNEAK_PREVIEWS by Keith Ferrell ongevity offers challenges as well as opportunities. Just as with television, when a computer game series gets older, in the best of circumstances, it also gets wiser and better The groundwork is established freeing its creators to move on to explore other issues. Audiences are familiar with its underlying concepts but, handled carefully, that familiarity can breed renewed excitement rather than jaded contempt. Based on the pre-release version of SIMCITY 3000 I've been looking at the designers at Maxis have decided to pursue excitement, both visceral and intellectual. From what I've seen-with. admittedly, some of the game's most promising features not yet implemented—the designers have succeeded. Nine years ago, when the original SIMCITY made its debut, resource management and exploitation games were some thing new. The story goes, in fact, that Broderbund, the game's origin al publisher, insisted on putting disasters, including Godzilla, into the game in order to increase the program's \"playability.\" They missed the point. Playability was something SIMCITY possessed plenty of. It was just a different sort of playability. Managing all of the various resources and problems of a city's the \"I'll just play five more minutes\" type of game. Parameters could change in the course of those five minutes, leading you to give it 5-or 50-minutes more. There had never been anything quite like it. SIMCITY broke new ground (pun intended) and, for a while, had that ground to itself. No more-SIMCITY's influence has been felt on games such as CIVILIZATION and all of its offspring, as well as any number of pick-a-planet-and-colonize-it space adventures. You can even find its influence in COMMAND & CONQUER and that game's cousins and clones. But SIMCITY's goal Godzillas notwithstanding-has always been more peaceful than that of the games it inspired or sired. Build a city. Fill it with people. Keep them happy. prosperous, productive, and safe. Large goals, with large challenges that grow larger with the passing of each simulated day Everything Old Is New Again Now, with SIMCITY 3000, Maxis has returned to the game's roots, taking advantage of close to a decade's enhancements in programming tools and computer power to give the game a new look and feel and make it a deeper experience. The basics remain the same. Pick a piece of land, build houses, stores, and factories; provide power, water, and a transportation system. Now run it. Simple. You know, like Fred Astaire dancing. SIMCITY 3000 makes running the city, at least at the highest levels of gameplay, more of challenge of coordination with your sim-population than you had in the earlier versions. Petitioners in the new game make their desires-and demands-quite clear, and the wise administrator learns quickly to keep a constant eye on the petitioners' requests. This time, you get far more of a feel for the personality of your sims. In the earliest versions of the game, information about their an almost hypnotic challenge. SIMCITY was a prime example of SimCity 3000 The Classic City Builder Returns to Its Roots simulated day. ATUNCI ROW ROW ROW YOUR HOUSE Row homes give a sense of actual city architectural styles and fashions, adding to the realism of residential zones.

The city-management tools Controls are sensible and easily are there, many of them more easimastered-once you get a feel for ly accessible than before, but they them. Moving the cursor does not cause the screen to scroll automatically, you have to hold down the right mouse button for that. This bothered me until I remembered how annoying autoscroll can be when you don't want to scroll. Some aspects of running your city have been simplified-providing power and water to your citizens and their enterprises is more automated than I recall from earlier versions. Other aspects are more realistic-particularly the handling and disposal of your city's garbage. As in the real world, this quickly becomes a dance of various tradeoffs and compromises, each of which affects your population and the effectiveness of your city administration. Neighborhoods develop personalities and, one assumes, virtual voting habits. Depending on your policies, you'll find yourself more popular in some parts of town than others. Without the budgeting features implemented I hesitate to comment on the economic side of things, but I have little doubt that economic tools will likewise show a leap in sophistication over previ ous versions. On the whole, SIMCITY 3000 delivers a far more realistic feel for the populations of its cities, and the behavior patterns of blocs within that population than did its prede. cessors. Some of this depth is accomplished graphically: Richer renderings are used to deliver information as well as aesthetic appeal. any of the several close-up zoom views, offer a nearly photographic level of detail. People and vehicles move through the city. Plant, water, and other details are likewise more realistic and convincing than ever. Disasters continue to play a part in the sim-saga, and there are plenty of catastrophes here waiting to undo your hard work. Sound effects enhance the illusion to a degree that surprised me. The sound is contextual-its nature changes depending on the part of town you're in. Visit a park and you'll hear children; go to an industrial zone and you'll hear the sounds of work. It's a nice and effective touch. A news ticker contains information, but also a repetitive series of \"cute\" statements that grow tiresome. You can remove this and other control features from the screen. There's also a good selection of background music scores from which to pick. the introduction of a variety of beautifully rendered famous b uildings, including the Alamo and the United Nations, is a delight and provides the gamer with the opportunity to put familiar pieces of grand architecture in the midst of Anytown. A feature called Starter Towns, not yet implemented, promises to offer historical towns and the challenges those communities faced. I would like to see some of the theoretical and fictional towns offered as well. But I suppose that most of us will create our own cities, towns, and burgs, as we always have. Starting with a patch of ground, we build our dreamsinto utopia, dystopia, or something in-between. The results in SIMCITY 3000 are, more than ever, up to us and our planning and managing abilities. The designers of this program have done well by it, honoring a justly famous predecessor and at the same time adding touches and tools of their own that should help ensure SIMCITY a solid place in gamerooms and classrooms for the next millennium. CGW Look at Me Some of the enhancements are cosmetic-and cosmetic of a high order. SIMCITY has never looked better.

"Speed Busters SNEAK PREVIEWS mobile designs. The irony here is that, while you don't get the thrill of racing a real-life Aston Martin or Ferrari, the trade-off is greater realism: These fantasy cars can take and show damage-something that NFS' licensed vehicles aren't allowed to do and the damage will affect your car's performance. You'll be able to customize your vehicle's look by creating custom \"skins,\" which you will also be able to upload and download from Ubi Soft's Web site. The game's 3D graphics (which require an accelerator) are impressive-crisp, detailed, and with a broad color palette, with liberal use of transparency and particle effects, which adds to realism. Music is another nice touch. Each track has been scored separately, and within each track, different musical themes are applied to match the environment. It's a nice change of pace from the standard driving game techno/Euro twaddle. POS 1/6 es After Releasing the Best Racing Sim in Years, Ubi Soft Takes on NFS With SPEED BUSTERS -200 -220 20 200 LAP 1/3 gameplay elements to distinguish itself and to seriously challenge its competition. environments will change as the laps progress. By Jeff Green alk about your fast starts. Ubi Soft's F1 RACING SIMULATION, released earlier this year, was an outstanding Formula 1 game that instantly took its place next to MicroProse's GRAND PRIX series and Sierra's NASCAR games as one of the best racing sims in years. Not bad for a rookie title. Now Ubi Soft is hoping to make the same kind of splash in the arcade racer market with SPEED BUSTERS, a fast-paced, actionoriented NEED FOR SPEED-alike that uses the F1 RACING engine. Why would you want to play SPEED BUSTERS Over NEED FOR SPEED III? We were wondering this ourselves. But after a few spins with the beta (the game should be out by the time you read this). we discovered that, as with F1 RACING, Ubi Soft has built in enough innovations and unique Dinosaur Crossing If anything, SPEED BUSTERS is even more arcadey and cartoony than NFS. Subtitled AMERICAN HIGHWAYS, the game comes with six main tracks set in a variety of locations, including Aspen, Los Angeles, Louisiana, Nevada, and Canada. Although each track includes recognizable \"real life\" iconography, the fantasy element is cranked way up in this game. Thus, a spin through the Nevada desert will include a gathering of flying saucers overhead, while the Hollywood track includes a detour through a movie studio with a giant Godzilla-type creature roaming the street. The great thing about these animated objects is that they're not just window dressing. Instead, these are real objects that you can collide with and that will actively get in your way and impede your progress as you race. On the Hollywood track, Godzilla might take a swipe at your car and send you careening out of control. On the Aspen track, a rock slide might strike your car or a snow blower might obstruct your view. The Auto Eroticism In contrast to the cartoony environments, however, is some semiserious driving. Because the game is based on the F1 RACING engine, car handling is more sophisticated than in the average arcade racer. It's still easy, and your options for tweaking your vehicle are limited, but it's still quite common to spin out or lose control. Surface is a real factor here--you're going to slow down in the gravel and slip and slide in the snow. Unlike NFS, SPEED BUSTERS does not include real licensed vehicles, but instead uses seven fantasy cars based on 1950s and 1990s autoNFS Buster? Since SPEED BUSTERS is still in beta, we can't render a real judament yet. There's still a lot that's not implemented, including multiplayer action and the game's Championship mode. Do PC racing fans really want a game with giant dinosaurs and flying saucers? Maybe not the same crowd that wants GRAND PRIX LEGENDS, but we'll see. One thing that F1 RACING SIMULATION proved, though, is that Ubi Soft knows how to make a great driving game. Don't count SPEED BUSTERS out. CGW Monaco Grand Prix Racing Simulation 2 Speed Busters GENRE: Racing RELEASE DATE: 04 '98 DEVELOPER: Ubi Soft PUBLISHER: Ubi Soft As we went to press, Ubi Soft announced the sequel to F1 RACING SIMULATION, called MONACO GRAND PRIX RACING SIMULATION 2.

"MECHWARRIOR 3 ONE GIANT ECHWARRIOR 3 should really be called MECHWARRIOR 3.5. It isn't a giant robot step up in quality from the other successful MECHWARRIOR games, it's a soaring jump-jet leap. The leap includes deformable terrain: The buildings have destructible geometry, incoming artillery rounds pockmark the ground with craters, and even the Mechs leave distinctive footprints. Similarly, the artificial intelligence has been improved considerably: It can ambush you and use the terrain against you. And the command interface is considerably more friendly: There are pop-up windows you can use to position your subordinates (who are significantly \"smarter\" than their MECHWARRIOR predecessors) and direct them into action, LEAP FOR MECH-KIND BY JOHNNY L.

"DOWN, BUT NOT OUT MECHWARRIOR 3 Nax. Dridge Shooting Scars Playable from either a first-person (cockpit) or third-person (chase-the-Mech view) perspective, MECHWARRIOR 3 features enough eye-popping action to make you think your monitor is in danger of exploding. A Bushwhacker pulverizes a stone column into dust, initiating a chain reaction in which the corner of a building falls atop an unsuspecting Owens and crushes it. The crushing damage causes an explosion, and the Owens becomes unsalvageable slag. A Mad Cat gets pummeled to the ground by a barrage of autocannon rounds. But while it looks as immobilized as someone on the wrong end of a Muhammad Ali knockout blow, amazingly, the Mad Cat extends an appendage and pulls itself to its feet like the gigantic humanoid it resembles. Mechs hide in bodies of water and jump-jet-seemingly out of nowhere to ambush your lance. Mechs step on and obliterate objects. MechWarriors navigate huge caves and tunnels and fight in urban environments and the great outdoors. Mechs with damaged legs take on a crippled bird walk as they limp and stumble in the fight-a fascinating effect whether viewed from the third-person perspective or experienced firsthand in the jiggling cockpit view. Everything about the look of MECHWARRIOR 3 has the impact of a long-range missile. It won't soon be forgotten. Smoke Jaguars in Your Eyes MECHWARRIOR 3 is set within the Twilight of the Clans series of novels. That makes it A.D. 3058 in the FASA universe when the heroes of the Inner Sphere are still struggling against the renegade might of the Clans. In the single-player campaign in MECHWARRIOR 3, the MECHWARRIOR 3 features make you think your ar Bridge gamer and his or her fictional comrades will face the might and technological superiority of the dreaded Smoke Jaguar Clan. It begins with a rather routine police action (à la Korea?), which immediately goes awry (naturally, the player doesn't know that right off) and continues to escalate. Fortunately, gamers have some new tools at their disposal. First, the new mission editor enables you to edit waypoints for your Mech and Mobile Command Base (MCB) immediately after the mission briefing. From the same map where you observed the mission objectives and known enemy concentrations, you'll be able to grab, click, and move waypoints. What's particularly interesting is that during the course of the In previous giant robot games, it's been enough to deck the opposing Mechs, Gears, or HERCs.

JET LAG w When you tire of making a big splash, you can jump-jet out of the water and onto the beach. Should you land on something like this unfortunate crate, it ceases to be an obstacle. Sim Mech New hands have been at the controls of MECHWARRIOR 3 since the game's inception. (Zipper Interactive took over development from fledgling FASA Interactive, a division of the publisher that created the BattleTech universe.) But from what we've seen, the new hands appear to be elite ones. Zipper is peopled largely by military contractors who helped build the U.S. Army's SimNet experience. (SimNet was the networked universe of combat vehicle simulations that prepared U.S. troops for the Gulf War.) SimNet was so realistic that some tankers have been known to exit the simtank vehicle to take compass readings; others tried to apply that same professionalism to MECHWARRIOR 3. They laugh about being so serious about a fictitious universe, but the result is a MECHWARRIOR universe that feels right and given suspended disbelief-seems realistic. So far, MECHWARRIOR 3 definitely ranks as the most powerful Mech experience yet.

"Holiday Hot Have Yourself a Mayhem Christmas... a Harrowing Hanukkah...a Sinister Saturnalia! he idea of the \"average\" gamer's holiday may well be as much of an aberration as the \"typical\" nuclear family depicted on these pages. Images of blow torches and depleted uranium shells instead of the sugar plums of old may dance in the heads of gamers tucked in their beds on the proverbial \"Night Before.\" Mayhem is as likely to define merriment for gamers as much as the jolly old fat man of holiday lore. As in holidays past, our Holiday Hot 100 appears to assist you in explaining your holiday wishes to those of a gentler persuasion. Our editors have once again drawn up lists of the best games in each genre that are likely to come out this holiday season or are already out. However, like Jacob Marley's ghost in the Dickens classic, some of what is shown may be visions of what might be or could be rather than what must be. We've tried to include only those products with a high chance of releasing before the holidays, but we can't guarantee that the development elves at every company will actually make their ship dates. We boldly suggest that you check out this guide, circle the games you'd most like to unwrap during the holiday season, and pass the magazine along to your favorite gift giver. With your help, they can avoid being virtual Scrooges because they just didn't understand what you wanted. Yule be glad you did. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 103 "

Spin around a corner to see a howling research scientist pulled to his doom through a shattered ceiling. Run into a hallway and jump when a mutant tears through the door behind you. Escape on a descending elevator platform and hastily reload your puny.45 as skittering aliens plummet after you. The overwhelming sensation you have when playing HALF-LIFE is of constantly trying to catch your breath. Adding to the challenge is the advanced Al of the monsters, who'll hunt in packs, pursue you through the levels, and retreat. Fortunately, you're not always forced to deal with them alone. You can direct security personnel to accompany you and even get some characters to administer much-needed medical treatment. The Valve team has pushed the QUAKE II engine to its limits and has added a lot of its own code. The results are horrifyingly detailed monsters, brilliant explosions, and a gameworld that almost seems alive.

Dark and foreboding, REQUIEM is beautiful to look at, with incredibly detailed environments that embody the spreading corruption of the Fallen.

Incredible lighting effects and searing explosions distinguish this title. This is an ideal gift for anyone getting a Voodoo2 card this year. UNREAL is easily the most beautiful firstperson shooter in some time, topping even QUAKE II when it comes to glittering eye candy. The unique, imaginatively designed alien worlds are FORSAKEN IT'S TOUGH TO WHITTLE the crowded action genre down to just 10 titles since there are plenty of games worthy of attention. There are just too many to squeeze into that main list, so here are a few more suggestions. Even the most Luddite nongamers probably know of Lara Croft by now. She and her freshly pierced navel will be hitting store shelves sometime before Christmas in TOMB RAIDER III. This year's model features 15 nonlinear levels taking place in locales as various as the South Pacific, India, and the United States' (in)famous alien research facility, Area 51. TOMB RAIDER's signature lush graphics keep getting better and sport multicolored lighting effects, water reflections, and weather like fog and snow (in which Lara will leave footprints). Fans of DESCENT will likely enjoy the hoverbike-riding, laserblasting action of FORSAKEN. Gamers speed through twisting, enemy-loaded tunnels in a truly 3D world, where passages are just as likely to be over your head as Sto Stuffer TOMB RAIDER III potlighting a 20-year-old CD in a magaMezine so obsessed with bleeding-edge technology may seem strange, but Iggy Pop is the perfect thing to listen to while playing QUAKE II and the like.

If you prefer spells and staves to guns and ammo, check out Activision's HERETIC II, powered by the QUAKE I engine. You play from a third-person perspective as you seek to find a cure to a hideous plague spreading across the continent. But don't think the fantasy setting and third-person perspective make this some sort of \"Elf Raider.\" The emphasis here is squarely on action as you hack, slash, and blast fireballs through richly imagined cities, swamps, and dungeons Finally, online gamers might enjoy FIRETEAM or STAR SIEGE: TRIBES.

KING'S QUEST: MASK OF ETERNITY Windows 95 CD-ROM, $49.95 Sierra On-Line, (425) 649-9800 www.sierra.com word WE'VE BEEN ANTICIPATING the eighth game in Sierra's longrunning KING'S QUEST series for close to two years now and, honestly, we've spent most of that time being skeptical about it. But now that we've actually played the game, we are willing to publicly eat crow and say, with assurance, that KING'S QUEST: MASK OF ETERNITY is the adventure game we most want to play this holiday season. Veteran designer Roberta Williams, who goes all the way back with the Sierra series to KING'S QUEST I in 1984, is again at the helm, and there clearly was no reason to doubt her sure hand. As promised, Williams has taken this game in a completely new direction, while adroitly preserving the spirit of the series. It's a remarkable achievement We are willing to publicly eat crow and say, with assurance, that KING'S QUEST: MASK OF ETERNITY is the adventure game we most want to play this holiday season. KING'S QUEST: MASK OF ETERNITY once again takes place in the kingdom of Daventry, and as before, you embark on a heroic quest to save the land. But that's about all this game shares with the past. Williams' story is set in a completely 3D world, with an engine as powerful and robust as that of any current-generation action game. Really. Connor, your character, travels the beautifully designed levels in the game from either a third-or first-person perspective. You will have to engage in combat now (part of our early skepticism), but the cool thing is that it's not only scalable, it's actually fun, too. The greatest thing about the game, however, stems from the fact that despite the radical changes it's still an adventure game at heart. A real one, based on puzzle-solving, in which the only way to succeed is by using your brain. We've bemoaned the death of the adventure game all year.

"THE HOLIDAY HOT 100 2. GRIM FANDANGO Windows 95/98 CD-ROM, STBA LucasArts, (888) LEC-GAMES www.lucasarts.com WE'VE WRITTEN ABOUT the latest comic adventure from LucasArts several times now, and what can we say? We still can't wait to play it. As most gamers B noir movies. The game was designed and written by Tim Schafer-the brain behind LucasArts' DAY OF THE TENTACLE and FULL THROTTLEand despite the grimsounding subject matter, you can expect the script to be chock-full of the same smart-alecky comic genius found in those games. What is totally different this time around is the game's look. Like Sierra, LucasArts has (at least temporarily) abandoned its long-standing 2D graphics engine for an entirely new 3D one. Gone is the much-loved SCUMM engine in favor of one that lets you physically maneuver your character through the world (even with a gamepad). The gameplay is the same as it ever was just a bit more dynamic: Instead of clicking around the screen for hotspots, for example, Manny will physically turn his head when he walks by an object that you can interact with. The bottom line on this one is simple: It's a LucasArts adventure game. We want it. 3. SANITARIUM Windows 95 CD-ROM, $49.95 ASC Games, (203) 327-3366 www.ascgames.com know by now, GRIM FANDANGO is an all-3D adventure game based on Mexican folklore and set in the Land of the Dead. You play the role of world-weary dead man Manny Calavera, a skeletal inhabi tant trapped in the Land of the Dead. He's anxious to get out and commits a desperate act that plunges him into a web of intrigue straight out of Double Indemnity and any number of other classic IT MAY NOT BE THE cheeriest holiday gift in the world, but this dark, disturbing adventure game, designed by Dreamforge Intertainment, came out of nowhere earlier this year and totally blew us away. Unlike Sierra's KING'S QUEST and LucasArts' GRIM FANDANGO, SANITARIUM breaks no new ground graphically, but that doesn't matter. What sets SANITARIUM apart is its skillful storytelling, which takes a gripping plot and plays it out in a way that remains utterly unpredictable and unsettling until the very end. The game puts you in the role of a man who wakes up in an insane asylum, unable to remember who he is or how he got there. As you attempt to discover your identity, you'll embark on a metaphysical mystery over a series of surreal levels that will leave you constantly questioning whether what you're seeing is \"real\" or not. Are you experiencing these horrors, or are they the fevered dreams of a madman-or both? If they are just dreams, what do they mean? These questions will keep you glued to your computer screen. The game's isometric perspective and traditional puzzle-solving gameplay are decidedly oldschool, but they work well, and the puzzles (for the most part) are brilliantly integrated into the storyline. SANITARIUM is the darkest, most disturbing, and in terms of plot-most memorable adventure of the year. A perfect gift for those long winter nights. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Instead, it's an adventure game that attempts to tell a smaller story in the world of Tamriel. Like MASK OF ETERNITY, REDGUARD is a 3D game that combines elements of action and adventure while focusing strongly on plot and character interaction. The game's look is, mercifully, light years beyond that of DAGGERFALL. And the plot much more tightly focused than the miasma that was DAGGERFALLshould serve to keep adventure gamers enthralled. The hallmark of any great adventure game is its story, so why not get the adventure gamer in your life some actual books? John Saul's creepy six-volume, serialized novel The Blackstone Chronicles is available in a collected set for $14.95 from Random House. For an even creepier, more cerebral reading experience reminiscent of SANITARIUM, check out Haruki Murakami's unforgettable cult classic, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World ($13. Vintage International). TV miniseries, we finally get to play the game on which all of this is based. The MYST Crowd will swoon over the pretty pictures. And serious adventure gamers should be happy that they have a creepy, cerebral, psychological thriller. The game is based on some of the more unsavory aspects of mental health hospitals. Other Adventures If we had a sixth spot on Leither this list or the RPG list, we would have definite ly included QUEST FOR GLORY V: DRAGON FIRE. The fifth game in Sierra's beloved long-running adventure/RPG series has been in development forever, but at last it's almost complete. It's a great-looking game that will surprise a lot of people. REDJACK: REVENGE OF THE BRETHREN is the latest adventure from CyberFlix, which hit it big in a weird way when a year-old game of theirs unexpectedly popped back up on the charts. The game? TITANIC.

While remaining utterly faithful to the series' spirit, the game stands as a serious improvement over the previous entries in every way. It sports a deeper spell book a better experience and skill model, and a real-time/turn-based toggle that keeps you moving at a brisk pace yet lets you slow down for strategic thinking during combat. The 3D graphics won't get mistaken for UNREAL, but they're quite good and don't require an accelerator card. Extra touches-such as a cloth map, hidden dungeons, and undocumented item enchantments-speak to the overwhelming generosity put into this game. Yes, the storyline is minimal at best, the NPCs are annoying and mostly useless, and some of the dungeon combat is painfully tedious, but these are small marks against a gigantic gift of an RPG.

FINAL FANTASY VII Windows 95 CD-ROM, $54.99 Eidos Interactive, (415) 547-1200 www.eidosinteractive.com FALLOUT 2 IS DEFINITELY a case of \"more of the same.\" But since the original was the best role-playing game in years, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The sequel to our 1997 RPG of the Year, FALLOUT 2, returns you to a postapocalyptic California, where you set off once more on an epic quest among mutants, giant scorpions, and other irradiated Californians. Interplay has been awfully quiet about this one since the abrupt departure of designer Tim Cain; but after playing the beta, we're not too worried. FALLOUT 2 should retain the original's unique setting, proven gameplay, and sense of style and humor. It's not breaking new ground, but it should be a lot of fun. THIS FIRST PC PORT OF SQUARESOFT'S legendary Japanese console RPG series wasn't quite the home run some of us hoped for (it was marred by some installation problems and less-than-stellar graphics and sound), but it's still a landmark game. FINAL FANTASY VII (FFVII) is easily as huge as MIGHT AND MAGIC VI, but that's where the similarities end. FFVII is more like a movie or novel in which you quide a rotating cast of characters through a complex story filled with acts of heroism, love, heartbreak, betrayal—and lots and lots of combat. The game's plot (much too complicated to describe here) combines elements of science fiction, fairy tale, and heroic adventure. The graphics evoke Japanese animation (anime), with an exaggerated, cartoony style (in 3D, for which an accelerator is recommended but not required). The game is far more linear than PC role-players are used to. The flip side, however, is that each character you portray is so deep and emotionally complex that once you've been playing a while, you'll find yourself becoming genuinely attached to him and rooting for him-as you continue. You need to change your expectations for a game like FINAL FANTASY VII. It is, at root, a console game best played with a gamepad (there are even some arcade sequences to negotiate).

The first, ASC Games' WEREWOLF: THE APOCALYPSE, sounds awesome, but it's at least a full year away.

STRATEGO Windows 95/98 CD-ROM, $39.95 Hasbro Interactive, (508) 921-3700 www.hasbro.com Smart Games BACK IN THE 1960S, Stratego was a very popular family game-remember that agent Mulder's sister, Samantha, was abducted (or not) while the two children were playing this very boardgame-in large part because it took a lot less time than Monopoly or Risk. Since then, parlor games on the PC have scored a few hits and a lot of misses. One reason we like STRATEGO is that it doesn't try to fake being either a real-time strategy game, as BATTLESHIP did, or a bizarre simulation of rolling dice from a simulated cup, as the horrific YAHTZEE did. It simply re-creates the parlor classic with a few cool options that you'd have tried on the boardgame if only you could have molded those darn plastic pieces yourself. For instance, STRATEGO lets you and a buddy team up to take on the computer or two of your office mates over the LAN or Internet. And with a turn-based game, there's not a lot of lag to go around. As with RISK, there are a around lot of different maps and cool soldiers from which to choose (one of them is a dead ringer for our managing editor when we're late with an article, complete with epaulets). Everything else is as you'd expect, complete with spies to take out the enemy's marshal scouts to find out real values of hidden units, and miners to defuse those annoying bombs. SERGEANT  GENERAL CRLANKL MANGA CAPTAIN LIKUTENANT CKANI POREDRAL MINKA COUT Meteor Mayhem is a good example of Smart Games' unique style; it's the first asteroid game that relies on brainpower rather than reflexes. Rock, Paper, Scissors derives a clever logical conundrum from the old schoolyard game. And even a wargamer might touch his inner shepherd by guiding a flock across a hexagonal grid in Sheep Dog. As if the fresh gameplay weren't enough, Smart Games (now part of Hasbro) has finally pushed the graphics and animation up several notches, so you don't have to feel guilty when you're playing it on the plane.

FALCON 4.0 Windows 95/98 CD-ROM, $50 MicroProse, (510) 864-4550 www.microprose.com the demo was released earlier this year and you have the makings of the new king of the hill for hard-core combat simulations. 3. FIGHTER SQUADRON: SCREAMIN' DEMONS sim exhibits an even more impressive damage model than that title. Slide in behind a B-17, start shooting, and watch an elevator rip off and start spinning toward you. Jink to avoid it (it will damage you if you collide with it) and start shooting at the wing. First an engine starts smoking, then your tracers make contact with the fuel tank and it explodes, ripping off the wing and sending dozens of parts plummeting toward the ground. Come in too hard on landing after your victory and you can actually bend your landing gear. Half the fun in this game is just watching the myriad ways that planes can be damaged. Of course, there's plenty of combat here. You can pilot a variety of planes, including B17s, Lancasters, FW-190s, P-38s, and Typhoons. In addition to the built-in missions—which you can fly from the viewpoint of any participating plane-FIGHTER SQUADRON includes a fullfledged editor that will let create your own missions. EVERY YEAR LITTLE Johnny asks for FALCON 4.0 for Christmas, and every year Santa has to explain that the elves aren't through building it yet. Will this finally be the year that the long-awaited F-16 simulation finally appears under the tree? It appears so, since the program has finally entered beta-testing, the last stage before it ships. Still, given FALCON's history, we'll get little Johnny that Radioactive Man action figure, just in case. If FALCON 4.0 does make it out in time, little Johnny will be booting up the most ambitious combat flight simulation ever designed. Created with the assistance of F-16 pilot Pete Bonnani, FALCON 4.0 promises to sport an unprecedented level of detail in its cockpit and weapons-systems modeling. There will be a simplified mode for beginners and more casual players, of course, but hardcore pilots will be able to use targeting and weapons systems that are among the most accurately modeled in a sim. It's FALCON 4.0's ambitious campaign mode that's probably most responsible for the simulation's long delay. Not only is this future Korean scenario fully dynamic—the computer generates missions on the fly based on an ongoing air and ground war-but it can also be played multiplayer. Other gamers can join the action during deathmatches and single missions, and they can also enter a campaign in progress by connecting on a LAN or via the Internet. Top this off with a graphics engine that has seen significant enhancements since OVER EUROPE Windows 95/98 and Macintosh CD-ROM, STBA Activision, (310) 255-2000 www.activision.com SCREAMIN' DEMONS OVER EUROPE stands out for its amazing physics model. The closest thing to a fighter I've flown is a T-34 trainer, so I can't say that the flight models are 100 percent accurate. But I can say that the feel is the closest to the real thing I've found. The challenge of trying to land in a crosswind, the slight pitch change when dropping flaps, the jerk of the plane as you cross the slipstream behind another fighter-all of these feel just like the real thing.

"THE HOLIDAY HOT 100 look forward to intense canyon dogfights. Many members of the sim's development team are active IAF pilots, and the missions and aircraft performance reflect both historical and potential Israeli conflicts. Particularly interesting is the ability to jump from plane to plane to perform each element of a strike. You may start in an F-4 and be tasked with taking out air defenses, then switch to an F-15 to eliminate enemy fighters, and you might finally take the stick of an F-16 to destroy a nuclear plant. 6.

The games exhibit a new level of realism for NovaLogicdue to the fact that the company had the assistance of LockheedMartin and a former Soviet test pilot-but they also contain simplified radar and targeting systems that make them accessible to beginners and casual gamers. Both sims feature stunning 3Dfx graphics, active virtual cockpits, and full-blown mission editors. Since two of the five campaigns are shared between the games, you can fly them from the perspective of both American and Russian pilots. But the biggest appeal here is free multiplayer action with more than 100 other human pilots flying F-16s, MiG-29s, and F-22s on Novalogic's NovaWorld server. advanced WWII sim in the pipeline, But what it may lack in pure flash it promises to make up for in gameplay. This is the only WWII sim slated for release this year that has a dynamic campaigntwo, in fact. You can fly for England or Germany in the Battle of Britain; then you can take to the skies as an American pilot in the battle over Europe. The missions in EAW can accommodate up to 256 planes in the air simultaneously, so look for intense furballs. The game also sports instant-action and multiplayer cooperative play. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 151 "

All these titles are worth a look if you're shopping for a virtual pilot. SSI's LUFTWAFFE COMMANDER takes a unique view of WWII air combat, letting you fly as a German pilot anytime from the Spanish Civil War through the fall of Germany. Great attention to detail has been paid to the flight modeling in this historical sim the Iron Cross mode promises to be one of the most authentic WWII flight models yet. The sim would easily be in our Top 10, except there's a question about whether it will ship by Christmas. The same goes for SSI's SU-27 FLANKER 2.0, which takes all the elements that made the original a favorite of hard-core sim pilots and adds spectacular 3D graphics and a less-intimidating flight mode for more casual pilots. It's a top choice, but it looks like it may miss the holiday ship. Developed by General Simulations, F-16 AGGRESSOR IS the sim to check out if you're looking for a sim with an Iron Eagle-style action storyline. You're a mercenary F-16 pilot in this sim, which sports an impressive 3D engine and realistic flight modeling wrapped around its STRIKE COMMANDER-ish storyline. A good choice for Tom Cruise wanna-bes is MicroProse's TOP GUN: HORNET'S NEST, which looks much more impressive than the version we saw back at this year's E3. While it's clearly targeted at the action gamer and the inexperienced flight-sim pilot, the game now also features a mode with a reality-based flight model. While RED BARON II was disappointingly buggy, don't overlook RED BARON 3D. This updated version sports very realistic flight modeling, massive multiplayer support, and sharp 3D graphics. Best of all, purchasers of the original RED BARON II can get the new version free from Sierra. If you missed Jane's F-15, it's a sure pick for your Christmas list. The current king of hard-core flight simulations, it outclasses all other jet sims in its level of systems and flight model detail. Also check out LONGBOW COLLECTION, which features a 3Dfx-enhanced version of LONGBOW GOLD as well as LONGBOW 2, all in a single package Helicopter fans will want to check out Mindscape's TEAM APACHE for its impressive special effects and the intriguing crew-management gameplay elements. Multiplayer fans would enjoy a copy of the boxed version of WARBIRDS under the tree. The $30 program doesn't include much in the way of offline play, but it does include $30 worth of free play in the massively multiplayer WARBIRDS arena. Finally, check out Mission Studios' JETFIGHTER: FULL BURN for an intriguing blend of action-flight sim and WING COMMANDER-style storyline. It's not the most technically advanced sim out there, but it packs a hefty fun factor. WarBirds 2.01 156 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "

They have emphasized fast-paced, WWII-style combat à la the space scenes in the Star Wars movies. Although the pickings are still a bit slim (the space sim seems to be a niche genre), this year the field shows considerably more life and variety than in recent years. For any gamer who remotely enjoys the concept of space flight and combat, the top choice will be INDEPENDENCE WAR, brought to you by Ocean and developed by Particle Systems in England. INDEPENDENCE WAR is best known for its Newtonian flight model. Yes, there have been other games that employed such a physics model, but they are either too old (such as WARHEAD or the Elite series) or simply not very playable (think MANTIS or the MICROSOFT SPACE SIMULATOR).

On top of that solid foundation, INDEPENDENCE WAR builds great mission design. Instead of run-ofthe-mill \"fly around and kill lots of fighters\" missions, INDEPENDENCE WAR has you laying traps for nefarious pirates, finding and repairing malfunctioned satellites, and catching antimatter bombs. among other things. In addition, INDEPENDENCE WAR utilizes 3Dfx cards to their fullest, yielding improved ship exteriors, nebulae, missile smoke trails, and shielding effects. While it may not have multiplayer action, everything else about INDEPENDENCE WAR is firstclass. The 3D-accelerated graphics, the mission design, and the physics engine combine to make INDEPENDENCE WAR a unique space sim after years of clones. No other game has managed to capture the feel of space combat in addition to the feel of commanding a large starship. It's for these reasons that INDEPENDENCE WAR is the best pick for space-sim fans this Christmas. TEACHERGE 160 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 www.computer gaming.com "

"THE HOLIDAY HOT 100 As this guide went to press, STARSIEGE was in an alphatechnology release phase, so we haven't yet seen any singleplayer missions, enemy Al, or campaign layouts. However, the game's producer emphasized that his group is committed to doing this game right and noted that Dynamix and its parent company, Sierra, have assured him that there will be no 2. HEAVY GEAR II Windows 95/98 CD-ROM, STBA Activision, (310) 255-2000 www.activision.com EarthSiege series. That may not be such a good idea, however: Dynamix has big plans for this AFTER LOSING ITS Battletech license, Activision acquired the Heavy Gear license from Dream Pod 9, only to premiere with the lackluster HEAVY GEAR. On the heels of that experience, Activision scrapped its aging MECHWARRIOR 2 engine and created a whole new 3D-only engine, enabling it to redesign HEAVY GEAR II from the ground up. HEAVY GEAR II uses Activision's new Dark Side engine, which allows for much better graphics at faster frame-rates compared to the previous engine. The terrain is true 3D rather than polygons slapped on top of each other, but you'll need a 3D accelerator card as a consequence. You're placed in a Special Ops unit behind enemy lines, so your missions will vary to include stealthily tailing enemy convoys and conducting guerrillastyle assaults in cities. The gameplay for HEAVY GEAR Il will be quite different from what giant robot sim fans are used to. Because the Heavy Gear universe models foot soldiers instead of vehicles, the game takes on more of a QUAKE-style action feel. Don't be fooled by that assessment though, because even though it feels like a firstperson shooter at times, the use of squad tactics will make it more complex. As the squad leader, you'll be able to use a tactical map and command your Gears to pull off various maneuvers and tactics. The game features 40 single-player and 40 multiplayer missions, and multiplayer action will range from pure deathmatch to squad-versus-squad level battles. HEAVY GEAR II looks as if it will be a great follow-up to Activision's MECHWARRIOR legacy. 3.

The new engine looks several orders of magnitude better than the company's previous efforts, with the Cybrid designs benefiting the most. The interface screens look promising, the vehicle list is quite varied, and the game as a whole looks to be a big improvement over its predecessors. pressure to release STARSIEGE before it's ready. That is probably more encouraging than anything else we've heard, so be sure to keep this title on your radar. If the design team manages to pull off what they have planned, we may have a new contender for this genre's throne. We'll keep you apprised of STARSIEGE's development in upcoming issues ANYONE WHO HAS SPENT any time with EARTHSIEGE and EARTHSIEGE 2 might be tempted to skip right past this, the third in the 164 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Published by Interplay, this sim is still a clone, but it's the best clone of the bunch. It effectively combines aspects of both the Star Wars and the Wing Commander games to make for an extremely playable game. FREESPACE's main highlights are the excellent wingmen Al, the customizable controls and HUD, and the free campaign editor to extend its shelf life after you finish the main campaign. THE AGE-OLD SPACE-SIM series makes this list again. This title was No. 1 on last year's list, and it's still a great WING COMMANDER game. It features gameplay reminiscent of earlier WING COMMANDER games, has less annoying FMV, and sports some of the most beautiful graphics ever seen in a space sim.

Athletes from every corner of the globe gather to sort the best from the rest in this, one of the world's most encompassing competitions. For a company to make a computer game that fully captures the glory and grandeur of World Cup soccer is no easy feat. Yet this is exactly what EA Sports has done with not one, but two titles. FIFA ROAD TO WORLD CUP 98 (FIFA 98) comes from a fine lineage of soccer titles, it's true, but this game does for computer Soccer what Ronaldo does for the real thing: It takes the game to a new level. FIFA 98 is unmatched in terms of gameplay, game options, choice of stadiums, choice of teams, player and team Play FIFA 98 on a high-res monitor with a 3Dfx card, and you'll almost be convinced you're watching a soccer game on television, Team Select Spain Italy Real Madrid Juventus MUMIN WINNIN MNM MINI Shooting Speed Passins Defense Querell customization the list goes on and on. Plus, to say this game is beautiful is a tragic understatement. Play FIFA 98 on a high-res monitor with a 3Dfx card, and you'll almost be convinced you're watching a soccer game on television. The commentary is another area in which FIFA 98 excels: Comments by UK broadcasters Andy Grey and John Motson are dead on and always appropriate to the situation. WORLD CUP 98 is basically FIFA 98, with a marginally better Al and up-to-theminute (as of June 1998) rosters for the 1998 World Cup qualifying teams. It's a fantastic game, but we'd choose FIFA 98 for the most variety in terms of teams and even entire leagues. The designers modeled teams and uniforms for 189 clubs in 11 national leagues and they included accurate rosters for all of them! It's all in the details, folks. Of course, since FIFA 99 is due out any minute, all of this information may be superseded by the new game-if EA Sports follows its pattern of offering better and better titles. Regardless, though, definitely include FIFA 98 or WORLD CUP 98 on your holiday shopping list. O FRANCE 98 WORLD CUP 30) 166 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"THE HOLIDAY HOT 100 2. MADDEN NFL 99 Windows 95 CD-ROM, $49.95 EA Sports, (650) 571-7171 www.easports.com MADDEN USED TO BE the crown jewel in the EA Sports empire, but a couple of mediocre seasons have put the franchise almost into the underdog role. We say almost because, lucky for EA, there hasn't been much decent competition on the PC anyway. But that hasn't stopped EA from wanting to improve the game. The company is now readying the best edition of MADDEN in years (it will replaced the game's 2D sprites with a full 3D polygonal engine. This, along with player-specific motion captures and a variety of body types, gives the game a much more real and dynamic look than ever before. After two long, kludgy seasons, football action jockeys can finally expect the kind of slick arcade action available in EA's other big franchises. For newbies, EA has added a \"one-button\" mode, designed to let players run plays with just one gamepad or keyboard button, rather than having to memorize a whole gamepad worth of key combinations. A new franchise mode lets you create fantasy teams and run them over multiple seasons, while team-specific playbooks and a new play editor aim to add the kind of depth and realism long missing from the franchise (we used to win games with one play, repeated endlessly). With its reputation on the line, the stakes are high for MADDEN. But just as we saw with that creaky old Elway guy last season, expect a comeback season from everyone's longtime favorite. ADE 3.

First, EA Sports (through developer Tiburon Software responsible for last year's superior PlayStation version) has finally, belatedly, TOP LOS O ARZ 0 2.2 OUTI IN THE REAL WORLD, 1998 provided one of the greatest baseball seasons in decades. On the morning this was written, in fact, the country woke to learn that Mark McGwire had smashed the singleseason home run record. Unfortunately, baseball's remarkable turnaround since the 1994 strike has not been duplicated on the PC. We've seen one mediocre title after another the past few years. We'd pretty much given up on 1998, but a 13th-hour appearance of a most unexpected title, VR BASEBALL 2000, has given us new hope. Interplay's first version of its baseball title last year was underwhelming at best, so we had no expectations this year. But once we got our hands on VR BASEBALL 2000, we were shocked-and then sold. First of all, the graphics have been completely overhauled using Shiny Entertainment's MESSIAH engine, and the result is by far the best looking, most realistic looking ballplayers to date, bar none. More importantly, of course, is how the game plays. And again, we were impressed beyond all expectations. For one, pitcher/batter duels now actually make some semblance of sense—with Al pitchers and hitters acting and reacting as you might expect, and user controlled players being much easier to control. Fielding, always a huge problem in baseball sims, has been made quite functional here, with a sliding scale of difficulty. Next year's version promises to be even better, with the incorporation of the DIAMOND MIND BASEBALL statistical engine. But for now, VR BASEBALL 2000 will provide the kind of fun baseball action that a host of bigger name titles have failed to deliver this year. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

WASHING el.la Na Sloer Acce Other Sports Stuff NFL GAMEDAY 98 There are a ton of other sports titles on the way over the coming months, and believe it or not, they're not all coming from EA. One game that almost made this list is NFL GAMEDAY '99, the first PC version of Sony's longrunning PlayStation hit. The game is not great (see our full review elsewhere in this issue), but it's definitely worth it for those interested in multiplayer action over the Internetits big advantage over MADDEN. More PC action can be had this year from two games: Acclaim's NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB '99, a game whose predecessor surprised us with its better-than-average arcade play; and Midway's NFL BLITZ, the PC version of the coin-op smash, which has absolutely nothing to do with real-life football (and will probably offend those who actually care about the sport) but is one of those annoyingly addictive guilty pleasures. was ESPN Digital Games, which has two titles on the way: NBA TONIGHT and NATIONAL HOCKEY TONIGHT. Designed by the sports wonks at Radical Entertainment (NHL POWERPLAY) and gussied up with the kind of glitz that the ESPN license will buy, both games hold a great amount of promise-though we haven't seen enough to recommend them yet. Look for these games to at least outclass Fox Sports' unimpressive debut titles this year (which we admit isn't saying that much). As we went to press, however, Radical's future was in doubt, due to a persistent rumor of a buyout by-gulp-EA Sports Speaking of EA Sports, it has another couple of titles under its belt. TIGER WOODS '99, reviewed elsewhere in this issue, might be a good choice for golfers, while KNOCKOUT KINGS lets you get into the ring and float like a butterfly with some of the greatest (including The Greatest) boxers of all time. Yeah, baby, yeah! Sierra has finally retired its long-running FRONT PAGE SPORTS line but is still serious about stay. ing in the sports gaming biz. Its biggest release, which probably would have made our main list if it had been further along, is NFL FOOTBALL PRO '99, the latest version of the deepest, most serious football simulation in PC gaming history-and the winner of CGW's Sports Game of the Year award three times in a row earlier this decade. Sierra is completely revamping the title, with a new 3D engine and an even more detailed managerial mode, including a financial model that influences roster maneuvering. We have high hopes for this one. Let's hope Sierra pulls it off. Look out for BASKETBALL PRO 99, which Sierra touts as the hoops equivalent of its football title, with an emphasis on both league management and on-court action.

Yet for all the precision and practice required to drive these cars competitively, F1 RACING SIMULATION was designed with the beginner and novice in mind—there are plenty of driving aids to help you turn a clean lap, all of which you can toggle off as you start to gain confidence. For the veteran simulation driver, F1 RACING SIMULATION is as accurate and satisfying a racing experience as GRAND PRIX Il was, but F1 turns up the graphical standard a few notches with the help of 3D hardware support. The handling of the car model is smooth and consistent. And while the computer opponents can be aggressive, their moves are usually predictable.

While other games make few real distinctions between races apart from the odd ber unit, STARCRAFT delivers a dramatically different gaming experience depending on whether you opt to play as the scrappy Terrans, the mystic warrior Protoss or the hideous, Alien-like Zerg. Bolstered by a strong story, the single-player game is a study in constantly escalating challenge. The scenario design is stellar, featuring one of real-time strategy's most surprising and dramatic scenarios early in the game, as hordes of scampering zerglings overrun a Terran base. It's a testament to STARCRAFT's beautifully balanced play that there is no one way to win a scenario—thus eliminating that annoying, almost puzzlelike quality that plagues so many other strategy titles. As great as the game is solo, multiplayer is where it really shines. You can develop your multiplayer chops by squaring off against the computer's brutal Al in randomly generated scenarios, When you're ready, you can play over a LAN (up to eight players can spawn and play off one CD) or use Blizzard's free battle.net service for Internet play.

MYTH Il features even lusher 3D environments, more frames of animation, and improved pathfinding. Interior environments and polygonal moving objects such as drawbridges have been added, at last satisfying gamers who longed to besiege castles. Finally, MYTH II will include editing tools, enabling gamers to create custom maps and units. By providing more of everything that made the first game a winner, Bungie has ensured that MYTH II: SOULBLIGHTER will be a must-have for PC warriors. Don't miss our full preview elsewhere in this issue. THE FIRST MYTH garnered CGW's Strategy Game of the Year award last year, and it looks as though the sequel will be a top contender for the 1998 honor. Continuing the epic story of the first game, Bungie hasn't drastically changed anything in MYTH II, deciding wisely to improve and enhance gameplay while simplify. ing the interface. You'll still command a set number of troops that gain experience over the course of your campaign. Commanding them is easier than before because the crucial controls for viewing the carnage-filled battlefield are intuitively handled by simply moving your mouse. The original keyboard controls remain as an option. Critical unit facing is now achieved via a simple rightclick-and-drag of highlighted units as opposed to MYTH's funky, seemingly perfunctory, wristsnapping gesture-clicking. MYTH Il features the same unforgiving tactical combat. But gamers who found the first game too unforgiving will be glad to hear that the learning curve has been flattened a bit, though not at the expense of challenging gameplay. Enriching the playing experience will be new units like mortar dwarves, friendly trow, and magic units with replenishing mana as TURN-BASED SQUAD-LEVEL combat is back and surprise! it's not an X-COM game. In SSI's WARHAMMER 40,000: CHAOS GATE, gamers command five-man units across various alien landscapes, battling the forces of the evil Chaos cultists. Fully customizable squads let you name troops, shuffle squad lineups, and outfit each fighter with items from the game's enormous, devastating arsenal. With only a limited number of troops, you're compelled to protect your forces, but you'll be rewarded as they gain experience and abilities with every mission. The work that has gone into the Al in CHAOS GATE is evident even at the game's easiest setting: Enemies still fight smart, you just face fewer and weaker units. Of course, you'll be able to face the most challenging adversariesother gamers—in multiplayer gaming that lets you battle as the twisted Chaos army. new units to control unit stacks have been expanded to include up to seven unit types, and the hexbased combat maps have nearly doubled in size.

World-builders will welcome SIMCITY 3000 and CAESAR III. Unlike SIMCITY 3000, CAESAR III has some combat, but both games emphasize managing the growth and well-being of a city, albeit in vastly disparate eras. Keeping your populace happy, pleasing the emperor, fighting invaders, and establishing trade routes will determine your success in CAESAR III. Aspiring city managers in SIMCITY will have to contend with natural disasters, build power grids, and find a tax rate that will attract business without driving away citizens. Interactive Magic's SEVEN KINGDOMS: ANCIENT ADVERSARIES might seem like an AGE OF EMPIRES clone, but to call it so would do it a disservice. There is no campaign; your goal, simply put, is to expand one of several different ancient cultures until you basically control the world. This is a complex game that doesn't emphasize combat. Instead, it focuses on a deep economic model, construction, espionage, and diplomacy, with a smidgen of fantasy, to provide the bulk of its challenge. novaworld.

Easily topping this list is AGE OF EMPIRES: THE RISE OF ROME, a real favorite at the CGW office, which has led to the renaming of midday as \"Age of Lunch.\" RISE OF ROME adds four new civilizations and four new technologies, and (finally) lets you queue up unit production. There are five impressive new units as well, including the priest-hacking scythe chariot, which lets you literally-and bloodily-cut down the threat of unit conversion. STARCRAFT: BROOD WAR, Blizzard's official add-on, is sure to appeal to any STARCRAFT fan. Thirty new campaign missions provide plenty of challenge and continue the story of the first game. But the real draw here should be the new units, two for each race: an air-to-air unit and Dark Templars for the Protoss; healing medics and the devastating Valkyrie missile frigate for the Terrans; and a new mutalisk aspect and defensive unit for the Zerg. Of course the new units, tilesets, and maps will be supported for multiplayer carnage on battle.net. Based on the H.G. Wells sci-fi classic, GT Interactive's WAR OF THE WORLDS breaks from the standard, preset-mission formula of most real-time strategy games by asking gamers to position their forces on a large strategic map of the British Isles. The result is refreshingly nonlinear gameplay. Gamers can play as either the defending English or the invading Martians. The two sides have radically different units and technologies; and while resource management is a definite part of the game, the differing technologies will have each side scrambling for different raw materials.

"THE HOLIDAY HOT 100 es 1. THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR Windows 95/98 CD-ROM, $49.95 TalonSoft. (800) 211-6504 www.talonsoft.com IN LESS-TALENTED HANDS, this game would be a bone-dry treatise worthy of stacking on your shelves next to those 1960s BONT SA OS war films starring over-the-hill actors with bad British accents. That THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR is a triumph as a simulation of 20th century warfare is a welcome slap in the face of insipid near future games (most of which wouldn't know a morale check if it bit them in the command post). Armchair commanders will spend hours drooling over the variety of command options at their fingertips before they ever launch an attack. yer lans That ART OF WAR is also a challenging, enjoyable game is cause for celebration. Before Norm Koger fans immerse themselves in wargaming heaven, be warned that ART OF WAR has a steep learning curve. Once you have the game system down, however, it rewards you like no other operational-level game on the PC. For me, it was like having PACIFIC WAR with a real interface and a commonsense deployment system. Armchair commanders will spend hours drooling over the variety of command options at their fingertips before they ever launch an attack. ART OF WAR takes into account a dizzying 90-plus factors during combat, but it also has surprisingly good pacing for a complex turn-based game. The sophisticated Al knows how to use combined arms and when to call in artillery and air support. I guarantee it'll kick you from here to Bataan the first few games (if you don't cheat). Once you tire of the sophisticated computer opponent and tough campaigns, ART OF WAR lets you edit practically every aspect of the game. It's hard to believe, but TalonSoft may have surpassed its BATTLEGROUND series with this one. 202 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"THE HOLIDAY HOT 100 COMBAT MOVE 2. AXIS & ALLIES Windows 95/98 CD-ROM, $44.95 Hasbro Interactive, (508) 921-3700 www.hasbro.com WHEN LARRY HARRIS' beer-and-pretzels boardgame vision of WWII hit the marketing beaches, it was mostly ignored by the \"realism is king\" crowd. In 1984 Hasbro picked up the game, streamlined it, and supercharged the graphics. A million or so units later, Axis & Allies is still selling, which bodes well for its conversion to PC. AXIS & ALLIES begins at the peak of Axis success, when Germany and Japan must press hard for a strategic victory before the industrial might of the United States swings the tide in the Allies' favor. Along the way, you struggle for dominance in North Africa, try to blitz Russia out of the war, prep for D-Day, and research high-tech weapons like jet fighters and heavy bombers. Lest you fear another YAHTZEE or PICTIONARY, rest assured that everything you've come to love from the boardgame is here, with a toggle for every option you've ever imagined. The improved rules for multiple hits on battleships and submerged submarines are by themselves almost worth the price of the game. The Al is quite competent. And for games between human generals, Hasbro plans to support every kind of multiplay option. At press time, it was unclear whether optional time limits for each turn would make the cut, so make sure you're playing with someone who takes less than one of those rare games that goes beyond genre boundaries. It's hard to imagine any gamer not smiling upon finding this under the tree. 3. BATTLE OF BRITAIN Windows 95/98 CD-ROM, $49.95 TalonSoft, (800) 211-6504 www.talonsoft.com whether the veteran duo of Gary Grigsby and Keith Brors had-like one of those art-rock groups from the 1970s—run out of keyboard miracles. Working with TalonSoft, however, seems to have revitalized the famed designers. Because BATTLE OF BRITAIN looks to be as fun as Grigsby's USAAF from the old Apple Il/C-64 days, with the added advantage of a more dynamic situation. BATTLE OF BRITAIN is a combina tion of real-time and turn-based WITH THE SOMEWHAT lackluster reception of STEEL PANTHERS III, you had to wonder Cloud Cover 5 Light: 0 Moon :15 PLANNING Time : 04 30 Date: 8/12/40 strategy closer to HARPOON than MAX or X-COM. Basically, the German player maps out his bombing raids, strafing runs, and escorts, then launches them (up to 100 missions per day) choosing the time, altitude, and paths for each. Once the Luftwaffe shows up, the British player reacts as the clock ticks, trying to figure out whether those squadrons over Birmingham are really going after the steel factories or are simply a diversion for a massive attack on Big Ben. Everything happens operationally-you won't be fighting tactically as in ACHTUNG! SPITFIRE—but there is plenty going on to keep you busy. It seems that every fighter, recon, bomber, pilot, and historical target from the battle has been included, and there's even an optional 1941 campaign. While we're happy to see Grigsby finally doing a Windows 95 game, there is the possibility that the game won't be fully 3D as expect ed. Still, this is a fresh take on the most famous aerial campaign in history, and a pretty safe bet for the budding air force commander in your family this holiday season.

ASIDE FROM ITS INCREDIBLY long name, Interactive Sim's 101: THE 101ST AIRBORNE IN NORMANDY should be a welcome treat for fans of turnbased WWII wargames. The colorful maps resemble those of CLOSE COMBAT, but the focus is different. You have to deal with your 18man squad becoming separated in the darkness or link up with a hidden French Resistance group. Each soldier possesses different personality traits, skills and special training, rated in various categories, which include intelligence, endurance, weapons usage, and throwing ability.

The Velocity 4400 pumps out an impressive 3D GameGauge score of 483 running at 800x600, and the 2D performance is also impressive.

There are some productivity packages and 3Deep, a gamma man agement app from Colorific. And with a price of $199 for a 16MB board, the STB Velocity 4400 won't damage your pocketbook too much, either. IT'S NO BOLD STATEMENT that 3D graphics are here to stay. and it's no surprise that 3D first found a home in first-person shooters and vehicle sims. But last year saw the arrival of the 3D strategy game and even 3Daccelerated kids' titles. Microsoft delivered DirectX6, which significantly improves usability and performance of Direct3D. OpenGL also garnered wider acceptance with a number of companies announcing OpenGL titles-and not just ones based on the QUAKE engine. Running the latest crop of 3D games requires serious CPU and graphics horsepower. Stepping up to the plate is nVidia with the RIVA TNT. The RIVA TNT chip from nVidia is one of the most anticipated NOT EVERYONE CAN afford to upgrade their systems every year. Let's say you bought last year's killer rig-a 266MHz or 300MHz Pentium II. Or you're scraping up all your savings to get a 300MHz Celeron-A or K6-2 system. Which 2D/3D card do you choose? If you can afford only one card, consider a board that uses 3Dfx's new Banshee chipset. The Banshee is no replacement for Voodoo, but Banshee's performance in Direct3D, OpenGL, and Glide games is nonetheless solid. Even a multitexture game like QUAKE Il does reasonably well on a Pentium II with Banshee, although it has to perform multipass rendering to pull off QUAKE II's multitexturing effects. The 2D performance is very good and surpasses everything except the TNT--at least up to 1024x768x32. Our pick for Banshee boards is Guillemot's Maxigamer Phoenix. The board itself isn't all that special-pretty much a copy of the 3Dfx reference board. But it's cheap. A 16MB board retails for $149 but comes with a $20 rebate coupon, making the net price $129. It comes with some cool games, too, including a limited version of HALF-LIFE, the full version of BARRAGE, and a host of demos, Phoenix also comes in both PCI and AGP flavors, so if you can afford only one low-cost board, check it out 214 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD .

The sound is clean, the volume level is respectable, and the setup is simple. It's easy to find desk space for the tiny satellites, and the small subwoofer tucks into any odd corner. The volume knob is on the right speaker, and the whole affair looks way too small to be real. But this system puts out solid, clean sound, has a reasonable bass punch, and can get pretty loud. Boston 10. Gravis Xterminator Xterminator, $49.95 Advanced Gravis, (650) 572-2700 www.gravis.com Ithough there's a bevy of good products to choose from this holiday season, it's always a good idea to keep an eye on the horizon for the next generation of products. Here are a few worth considering. Intel is hard at work readying its nextgeneration Katmai Pentium Il processors. These will feature Intel's clumsily dubbed Katmai New Instructions (KNI), which should yield improved 3D performance in the form of higher triangle throughput. Game developers will either use Direct3D's transform and lighting (T/L) engine or write custom assembly code to get at KNI. Katmai is scheduled to debut the first quarter of 1999, with initial speed grades of 450MHz and 500MHz. We've also heard tidbits about AMD's K6-3 CPU, which will integrate the Level 2 cache into the CPU core and allow it to run on its own back bus at CPU clock speed, instead of having to share bandwidth with system memory and run at its speed. We haven't heard much about speed grades, but since K6-25 are now running at 350MHz, we figure K6-3 will probably hit 400MHz when it debuts. GRAVIS STRATOR SOME GAMERS HAVE to have a controller for every different kind of game they play. The upside is a well-fed control jones. The downside is a clutter of controllers littering your desktop. Advanced Gravis hasn't completely solved this dilemma, but the company has made a good step in the right direction. At first glance, its Xterminator controller looks like a gamepad, but a closer look reveals a more versatile controller that can also be used as a joystick. You can daisy-chain two of these controlers together, and the unit comes with an easy-to-use programming front end for game-specific configuration. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

The folks who brought you PUTT PUTT, FREDDI FISH, FATTI BEAR, PAJAMA SAM, and SPY FOX have welcomed yet another member into their clan. This year, the company teamed with Nickelodeon to create software based on the Blue's Clues television show. BLUE'S BIRTHDAY ADVENTURE invites preschoolers to join Blue and her master, Steve, as they prepare for the big day. Once kids have chosen the game they want to play there are four complete games to choose from-a great value for $29.95), the singing and dancing Steve will appear to help them on their quest. As in the show, the kooky live-action host is superimposed over the gorgeously rich multitextured environment of Blue's world. Each game includes a variety of activities: Kids can pick out a gift for Blue or make a card, which will be presented to Blue at the birthday party. There are puzzles to solve, noisemakers to pick up, hotspots to click on and, most importantly, clues to find. As kids discover items, store them in their inventory, and eventually figure out how to use them, they'll be rewarded with a clue-indicated by Blue's paw print—which they can record in their Handy Dandy notebook. Three clues and it's off to the Thinking Chair with Steve to figure out the connection between the items. Having solved the puzzle, kids are invited to participate in one of four endings: the party, pizza making, a treasure hunt, or a puppet show. BLUE'S BIRTHDAY ADVENTURE manages to maintain the distinctive style and gameplay that made the other Humongous titles so successful, while taking on the unique look and feel of the Blue's Clues series-quite a feat. For Blue and Humongous fans alike, it's a definite must-have. 2. HEADRUSH aware that this is definitely not for PC/Mac CD-ROM, 530 younger kids.

Much of the available MP3 music consists of garage bands and bootlegs, but a number of music labels are now experimenting with selling individual songs on the Net. Instead of paying $14 for a CD to get one song, you can just download the individual song for a buck. The biggest problem with MP3 tunes has been that you needed a computer to play them. Now Diamond has developed the Rio PMP300 Portable Music Player, which lets you take MP3 files on the road in a player about the size of a pager. Because the files are stored in solid-state memory, the device is completely shock-resistant. You can jog or operate a jackhammer without worrying about your Weird Al classics skipping.

"THE HOLIDAY HOT 100 Getting Great Gifts for Gamers It Takes All kinds N ow you know what type of system the person you're buying I for has, so you can tell if a game will work on it. But you still haven't actually chosen a game! We've listed a variety of interests below, along with the genres of games that usually appeal to folks with those interests. Once you determine the genres to which your gift recipient would likely gravitate, check the appropriate section of our \"Holiday Hot 100\" for some can't-lose games. INTEREST SECTION ou have gamers in the family, and you know nothing would make them happier than to find some hot new entertainment software under the Christmas tree. But your knowledge of computers basically boils down to knowing that PCs and Macs are different, that you've lost more friends to the World Wide Web than to marriage or children, and that some guy name Gates is apparently out for world domination. You bravely walk into your local software store, only to have your senses assaulted by brightly colored boxes of all shapes and sizes. Everything from tanks and airplanes to dinosaurs and severed limbs vie for your attention. How on earth do you choose the right gift? On a PC, this will normally be Windows 95/98, Windows 3.1, or MS-DOS. On a Macintosh, it will be System 6, System 7, or MacOS 8. Check the system requirements on the box of the product you're buying to determine which operating system it's designed for. Most new games are designed for Windows 95 and 98. If the person you're shopping for has a PC and is still running MS-DOS or Windows 3.1, a system upgrade to Windows 98 might be the gift of choice instead of a game. Note that MS-DOS games will run on Windows 95 systems, but setting up the computer to run them properly can be a complex task. Unless the person you're buying for is very computer savvy, it's best to stick to Windows 95 games. If the person you're shopping for has Windows 98, you'll be relieved to know that Windows 98 uses the same software as Windows 95. If a game lists Windows 95 as a requirement, it should work fine on Windows 98. Other computer specifications that you should determine and check against the game's system requirements include the following:  The amount of RAM (generally 16MB, 32MB, or more) CD-ROM speed (4x, 8x, or faster)  The type of processor (486, or the faster Pentium and Pentium II [in the case of a PC); or 68030, 68040, or PowerPC (in the case of a Macintosh))  The speed of the processor (usually a number ranging from 90MHz to 450Mhz) It's fine if you have more than what the box lists for the game's requirements; a game designed for a 133MHz Pentium with Aircraft, military aviation, ships Auto racing, motorcycles Brainteasers Card games, classic games Cars and driving Children Computers Dungeons & Dragons Fast-paced action, violence Football, baseball, golf Mental stimulation Military History Politics Science Fiction Simulations Racing, Action Classics & Puzzles Classics & Puzzles Racing Kid's Software Hardware/Santa's Other Surprises Adventure, Role-Playing Games Action Sports Classics & Puzzles Wargames, Simulations Strategy, Wargames Adventure, Role-Playing Games Space Simulations, Strategy Sports (Forget computer gamesWe suggest an intervention Sports Beanie Babies The Hardware Choices The first thing you'll need to determine is what kind of computer your gift recipient has—and how it's equipped. Of course, doing this without giving away why you're asking will take some smooth talking. You might express interest in getting a computer of your own and ask what kind of system he or she has for comparison. Is it a PC, running Microsoft Windows, or a Macintosh? This determines in which section of the store you'll need to shop. PCs and Macs use different programs, although a very few games will include both PC and Mac versions on a single CD-ROM. Next, you need to determine which operating system (the program that controls how the computer works) your recipient uses. 16MB RAM should work fine on a 266MHz Pentium Il with 64MB RAM Finally, if the person you're buying for owns a PC, you'll need to find out what kinds of add-ons the system has. Almost all gamers will have the SuperVGA-graphics capability required by today's PCs, but many of today's hottest games require a 3D graphics card as well. You'll generally find two graphics requirements listed: Direct3D or 3Dfx. Direct3D games will work on most computers that have 3D cards, but games that specify 3Dfx will generally only work well if the computer is equipped with a 3Dfx Voodoo or Voodoo2 card. A mouse is de rigueur on today's PCs, but you will need to determine if the game requires a joystick or a gamepad. If so, does the person you're buying for have one? At least there's one less add-on hassle: If you buy a Windows 95 game, you shouldn't have to worry about what kind of sound card your gift recipient has. CGW ZAZ COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"LAPTOPS Speccing Out Your Laptop W hat showed you hat should you look for in a gaming laptop? Let's take a look at the minimum specifications, as well as some features that can make the system more useful. re laptop PCs good for gaming? Getting straight to the point, the answer is yes...and no. If you're into wargames, strategy games, adventures, RPGs, and puzzle games, you can find hotrod laptops that will give you a good gaming experience no matter where you travel. But if sims, action, or sports are your thing, you'll need to be very selective in choosing a machine or you'll find that your expensive new laptop delivers only a passable gaming experience. The good news is that we've seen at least one laptop designed, in part, with gamers in mind something we hope starts a trend. run a 640x480 resolution game on a laptop with an 800x600 screen, it may appear in a letterbox format in the center of the screen or it may be stretched to fill the screen. This stretching is done by doubling occasional pixels, and can result in very jagged graphics and hard-toread text. Check your laptop and see if it allows you to manually toggle the stretching on and off. This effect isn't as pronounced on a 1024x768 screen and some newer units use an antialiasing scheme to avoid the problem. Today's laptops generally have a minimum resolution of 800x600 pixels, while some high-end models offer 1024x768. If you have good eyes, the 1024x768 models provide more screen real-estate for strategy games that support higher resolutions (and that boring productivity stuff). But be aware that you'll probably end up running action and simulation games in lower resolutions to obtain a playable frame rate. Video If you play primarily 2D games, you can get excellent performance for under $2,000 by buying a fast Pentium MMX laptop with only 2D video. But be warned: Adventure, strategy, and RPG games are starting to make the transition to 3D, and a 2D-only laptop might not be good for games that ship in late 1999. A better move-if your budget allows—is to check out a laptop with 3D video support. But proceed carefully here, too. Even if a laptop boasts lofty specs, such as AGP and Direct3D support, that doesn't mean it's going to be good for games. 3D chips like the S3 ViRGE MX are such poor performers that many 3D games will revert to 2D mode if that chip is present. Other laptop chips haven't seen driver updates for new versions of DirectX and won't appear as 3D cards to newer games. Check out the reviews on the pages that follow for a look at the performance of a number of laptop video chips, As for laptop screens, there are two types of LCD screen available: dual scan (DSTN) and active m atrix (TFT, or thin film transistor). DSTN screens are poor choices overall. They refresh very slowly. and moving objects leave smeared trails on the screen, so they don't handle game display well. And they're not any better on serious stuff, since fuzzy text and ghosted images make for a display that's harder on the eyes. Go for a TFT screen, which is sharp and can handle fast motion onscreen. Unlike monitors, laptops actually use physical pixels on the screen. This means the laptop will always display a single resolution. If you 3D: Generation Last The problem with gaming on today's laptops boils down to one factor: 3D technology. Decent 3D technology has finally made its way into portable computers, but laptop 3D lags at least a generation behind the 3D cards you'll find on desktops, and that's bad news for demanding gamers. The best laptop 3D cards approximate the perfor mance and quality of an ATI Rage Pro card. If you're looking for Voodoo2 or RIVA TNT performance, you'll have to wait a generation or two. And to get even that level of performance, you'll need to buy a top-of-the-line laptop. Nevertheless, many of us need a laptop. We have work to do on the road, or we just can't go a day without checking our email, playing in our online fantasy football leagues, and reading the erudite, reasoned discussions in the gaming newsgroups. So if we do have to drop the bucks on a portable PC, we might as well find one that we can have fun on too, eh? In this feature we'll take a look at four laptops that have what it takes for various segments of gamers. But first we'll take a look at the qualities you should look for in a gaming laptop. Processor and Memory As is always the case with games, the faster the processor the better. However, most newer games that have hefty processor demands also require 3D graphics to get good performance. There's not a huge difference between the speed of a Pentium MMX/266 notebook and a Pentium 11/266 when you're running STARCRAFT or FALLOUT. Of course, if action or sims are your bag, then a Pentium 11/266 or 300 is the processor of choice if you have a fat wallet. As for memory, you'll want at least 32MB RAM for a Windows 95 system and 64MB RAM on a Windows 98 notebook. More memory is almost always better, and this is doubly true for note. books. When Windows runs low on RAM it swaps data out to your hard disk, which eats battery life, Bumping up to the next level of RAM can not only make your games run smoother, it can also www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLDO DECEMBER 1998 "


"LAPTOPS give you more time between battery recharges. Also note that while memory upgrades can be quite expensive from proprietary notebook manufacturers, cheaper third-party RAM is available from companies such as Kingston (www.kingston.com) and CDCE (www.cdce.com). MPUTER COMPUTER WORLD The Indian Mapa Dell Inspiron 7000 Dell Inspiron 7000 Miscellaneous Specs There are a number of other components to consider when deciding which notebook to purchase. Perhaps the most important component--one that's crucial to success in so many games-is mouse pointer control. Although we've never found a notebook pointing device we truly liked some are definitely better than others. It's unfortunate that trackballs--the best choice this side of a mouse for gaming--are rarely available anymore, even as options. Our next choice is the eraser-style trackpoint found on IBM, Toshiba, and some Compag units. Touchpads just don't offer the precision necessary for selecting units in real-time games. Of course, you should also plan to pack an external mouse and use it whenever possible. Most notebooks ship with at least a 24x CD-ROM, so performance isn't a problem. However, you may want to look for a model that allows you to connect a CD-ROM and floppy drive simultaneously. Also, avoid external CD-ROM units, except for the kind that physically attach to the bottom of a notebook. With the inhumanely small amount of space you're allocated on today's airliners, you'll never find a spot for a Discman-style external drive. One of the big dilemmas with notebooks in years past was tinding a way to attach a game controller. Machines with joystick ports were few and far between. The units that did have them generally put them on port replicators, which weren't exactly meant to be portable, The good news is that the vast majority of new notebooks including all the units we tested have at least one USB port. If you're running Windows 98 (Windows 95's USB game-controller support is hosed), just plug in a USB joystick or gamepad and you're set. If you have legacy hardware you want to use, such as a set of flight controllers, go to www.fscentral.com and check out the JC Designs Gamecard Pro, a PCMCIA card that adds a 15-pin joystick port, Finally, consider the battery setup. How long are you going to use your machine on battery power? Remember that running a game pretty much cancels out most power-saving routines, which depend on slowing the system at idle moments. In most games, there are no idle moments. Even the huge base battery available for Micron's GoBook2, which can last up to eight hours if you're just typing in WordPerfect, dies after about four-and-a-half hours running F22 TOTAL AIR WAR. If you use your notebook only for short periods of time hour-long commutes or shuttle flights-a single battery is plenty. But if you run it constantly during cross-country flights, look for a unit that supports multiple, simultaneous battery installation, Finally, you should carefully consider why you're buying a gaming laptop in the first place. If you think a hot laptop is a cool idea because you can network it with your desktop and use it for multiplayer games when you're not traveling, consider this: For about the price of a top-of-the-line Pentium Il notebook with a 3D card, you could purchase a low-end notebook and a Pentium Il desktop system. Whenever Intel ups the specs on notebooks processors, you can find the low-end being cleared out for under $1,500. And now that the low end is a Pentium MMX/200, even a bargain laptop is no slug. If you can be happy playing games that aren't graphics intensive, enjoy the budget prices on low-end notebook PCs and invest the savings in a hot desktop rig for the home network—or a Hawaiian vacation. Pentium 11/300, 64MB RAM, 6.4GB hard drive, DVD-ROM (2x DVD, 20X CD), 15-inch display: 9.2 pounds. Three-year parts and labor warranty. $3,499 Dell, (800) 388-8542 www.dell.com hen I first started testing notebooks for this feature, I'd come to the conclusion that I wasn't going to find a unit that would satisfy hard-core simulation and action gamers. Happily, Dell came in at the last minute with what may be the first notebook created, in part, with gamers in mind. Dell has captured a wide market by splitting its desktop models between the Optiplex line for conservative, information-services types, and the Dimension line for performance-oriented consumers and is Mafia-free small-business users. Now the company is taking the same tack with its notebook line, with the conservative Latitude series for the corporate crowd and the new Inspiron series for home and small-office users. From the looks of the Inspiron 7000's specs, it appears that Dell has covered all the bases for the gaming market. It has the fastest processor available for notebook computers, the Pentium 11/300. There's plenty of RAM, 64MB expandable to 384MB. And the missing link is here: The notebook comes with an 8MB ATI Rage Pro LT graphics card, which offers good 3D performance (about the level of the original 3Dfx Voodoo chipset). You'll appreciate the 3D graphics in all their glory on Dell's 15-inch LCD screen, which sports a viewable area as large as some 17-inch monitors. The screen is actually larger than the main portion of the notebook; it has a \"lip\" that wraps around the lower part of the unit. The screen supports 1024x768 resolution and is sharp and bright. But my favorite aspect of this screen is that it antialiases lowerresolution displays when it stretches them. It's the only highres laptop display we've seen where you can stretch a game to fill the screen without getting ugly text and jagged edges. The feature list doesn't stop there, though. Sound comes via a HAG COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 www.computorgaming.com "


"LAPTOPS 266MHz Pentium II, CD, and 13.3inch screen will run about $2,699. The only significant downside to the unit is its weight and bulk-all this power weighs in at a hefty 9.2 pounds. But considering that it truly matches the power of many desktop gaming rigs, I'm willing to look at it as free shoulder muscle exercise. Kudos to Dell for putting together a unit that doesn't force gamers to compromise. GoBook2 PCI-bus ESS Technologies Maestro-2 chip, which includes hardware wavetable support for good-quality MIDI music output. There's a welcome volume dial on the side of the unit. As is the case with most notebooks, the speakers are pretty anemic compared to even inexpensive desktop units, so you'll want to attach a set of external speakers when you're gaming at home. In addition to an SVGA output, the unit also has composite and SVideo outputs, which can be connected to a television or VCR. QUAKE Il on the family big-screen TV, anyone? A single USB port on the back of the unit allows you to connect a USB game controller. If you need to connect a 15-pin game controller, you'll have to use a PCMCIA gamecard. The keyboard is a full 11 inches wide, and the keys have a good, deep throw. The Synaptics touchpad is good as far as touchpads go-with better precision than most, but you'll probably still want to use an external mouse when you have room. The unit I tested had a storage module that combines a floppy drive with a 2x DVD-ROM. When you order a unit equipped with DVD rather than CD, Dell includes a hardware DVD decoder on the system board. While there aren't many DVD games at present, this capability is great for watching movies while traveling. The storage module can be removed to add a second battery, doubling battery life to nearly seven hours. All this would be impressive in any notebook, but in a unit that sells for $3,499, we were blown away. If that's still rich for your blood, don't despair. In the past, most notebook manufacturers have offered only a couple of factory-defined configurations. Dell is building Inspirons to order, so you can pop up the company's Web page (www.dell.com) and specify your own CPU configura tion, memory, hard-disk size (up to 8GB), CD or DVD, and screen size. An Inspiron 7000 with a DirectX3, which could be the problem. This brings up another dilemma with notebooks: You don't generally see the frequency of video driver updates that you find for desktop cards. It's a shame the 3D support was unworkable, because the rest of the unit's design is top-notch. A single bay lets you plug in a 24x CD-ROM drive, floppy, or internal battery. Note that you'll need the optional base battery to use your CD-ROM drive on battery power. Micron includes a cable that lets you use the floppy drive externally The keys have a deep throw, giving the GoBook2 the most comfortable typing experience of the notebooks we've tested. Three programmable keys sit next to a wonderful invention a one-touch speaker on/off button. You'll love this simple but marvelous device when you forget to plug in your earphones before launching QUAKE at full volume on a night flight. There's a good amount of wrist rest area surrounding the touchpad pointing device. Even the unit's case finish is impressive it's a notebook that wouldn't be out of place in Darth Vader's study. If battery life or maximum portability are your top concerns, and you can live without 3D hardware support, the GoBook2 is worth a close look. Get Connected if you plan to connect your laptop to a desktop PC for multiplayer gaming, you'll find a variety of networking solutions available. First, there's the traditional method of using standard Ethernet cards. That's the solution popular with CGW editors for home networks. Purchase an ISA or PCI combo Ethernet card for your desktop PC and a 10-Base-2 PCMCIA card for your laptop, and you can connect the two effortlessly using simple coaxial cable, without having to purchase a network hub at extra expense. If both your laptop and desktop are equipped with USB ports, you might want to check out Anchor Chips' EZ-Link USB networking solution. It's not the fastest connection out there, but it's relatively inexpensive and it doesn't use a slot. For a full review, see the October issue of CGW. Although we haven't gotten a look at it yet, we're intrigued by Diamond's Home Free, a 1MB/second wireless radio networking solution. For $229 you get a combo starter pack, which includes a PCMCIA card for your notebook and an ISA card for your desktop. Internet-sharing software is also included, so if you have a fast connection to the Internet, multiple HomeFree users can access the Web and latencyinsensitive multiplayer games simultaneously. We'll have a hands-on test in an upcoming issue, but in the meantime check out www.diamondmm.com/ homefree for more information.

SB game controllers don't exactly glut the market at the moment, but there's one that is particularly suited for gaming on the road. Microsoft's SideWinder FreeStyle Pro includes a USB adapter and functions well on the laptops We tested. The FreeStyle Pro is intriguing as a portable device because it can function as a joystick in its motion sensor mode, yet it's as small as a gamepad. Add its gamepademulation mode and you have a flexible controller solution for when you need to travel light. For more info on the FreeStyle Pro, see our October issue (CGW#171).

"LAPTOPS Oh, Say Can You CE? 314) f you're pricing notebooks not because you spend much time gaming on the road, but because you need a productivity unit for travel and you figured you could use it as a second gaming rig at home, let us suggest an alternative. Why not get a Windows CE unit, which offers Web and email access, Word and Excel, and basic gaming functionality, and then spend the rest of the money on a full-blown desktop PC for the home network? NEC's MobilePro 750C is the first Windows CE machine I've seen that I really enjoy using. Instead of tiny chiclet keys or unreliable handwriting recognition, the 750C includes an actual touch-typeable keyboard. It's a little cramped, but after about 15 minutes of practice I was up to about 60 words a minute. For your on-the-road productivity, the unit includes stripped down versions of Word, Excel, Outlook, and Internet Explorer There's a built-in 33.6K modem, 16MB of RAM, VGA output, and an 8-hour rechargeable battery. As for gaming, while Windows CE can't match the selection and quality of games found on the PalmPilot, there are a growing number of available games (mostly arcade and adventure). You'll find many newer games support the 750C's 256-color, 640x480 screen. The games are mostly arcade games and adventures, but with the MobilePro's street price of under $800, you'll have plenty of cash left over to spend on a hot desktop PC.

This makes typing uncomfortable in many situations. It's a shame because the full-width keyboard has a good feel otherwise, and the embedded eraserstyle pointing stick works fairly well in games. Other than a disappointingly short 1-hour, 50-minute battery life on our game torture test, the rest of the Armada design is actually impressive. The unit has a built-in 33.6 modem (upgradable to 56K) and Ethernet, four programmable function keys, good speakers, support for an optional DVD ROM, and a beautiful 14.1-inch screen (which supports up to 16 million colors). Processor performance was quite good, and the graphics turned in good 2D performance. The Armada has some good points mixed in with the bad. But for a street price of better than 4Gs, we expect darn near perfection.

Last issue, we took a look at Matrox's Mystique G200 and found it to be a solid 2D card with very respectable 3D performance. Since then, several new 3D accelerator chips have shipped that, at least at the superficial performance level, leave the G200 chip far behind in terms of 3D. They even outstrip it in 2D performance. In this issue, we'll take a look at some of the brand-new boards that will take us to the next level in 3D acceleration. An interesting trend in 3D graphics is emerging: the use of low-cost, 16MB boards. It wasn't all that long ago that PCs shipped with only 16MB of RAM. Now we're seeing graphics cards with 16MB of local video memory for well under $200—thanks to the wonders of commodity pricing. In fact, one board in our roundup supports a whopping 32MB of RAM!

"3D TO DIE FOR Shipping Products These boards represent products that were shipping or about to ship when we did our testing. They include three RIVA TNT boards, a couple of Banshee products, the Hercules Terminator Beast, and the new boards from Matrox.

M MAP part A 20 N ew DVD lem la 30g eg MACRO 1 DA ya ED HAM TEMO S EAMNA MANCHE 293.89 3D Ga on Daw The Marvel G200 is just a bit slower than the Millennium G200, which Matrox attributes to the use of slower SDRAM on the Marvel. Despite the lack of speed, this card is quite versatile. Think of it as the sport utility vehicle of graphics cards. It won't get you there as fast as a funny car, but you can really load it up. Inside the Marvel G200 package is a blue, contoured plastic box that connects to the back of the Marvel G200. The box contains connections for video-in and video out, audio-in and audio-out (including cable connection) and a cable TV or antennae input. The Marvel G200 uses the Zoran motion JPEG CODEC chip to capture and compress video at resolutions at 30fps at 704x486 NTSC. We looked at the Marvel G200 TV (available only in North America), which also has an onboard TV tuner. The blue breakout box, which connects to the card via a three-foot cable, makes connections to camcorders, VCRS, and cable TVs much easier. This is truly a \"convergence\" graphics accelerator. The only thing you might want to add to it is a hardware DVD decoder, available separately. Matrox tosses in a copy of Avid Cinema, a handy nonlinear video-editing package formerly available only on the Macintosh. Until now, the ATI All-in-Wonder Pro had the field virtually to itself, but the Marvel G200 ups the ante for this type of Swiss Army Knife product. And if the 3D performance isn't quite up to the competition, you can always toss in a Voodoo2 card. Marvel G200 TV. $349 for 16MB; $299 for 8MB. Matrox, (514) 822-6320. www.matrox.com Pros: Pretty good overall performer, lots of video goodies added in; good image quality, nice video editing package.

Even during the summer of 1998 it was the performance leader in 2D/3D graphics accelerator for consumers. So it's really a fast board—it's just that it's slower than all the others out there. With a 3D GameGauge score of 293 on CGW's 450MHz Pentium II testbed, the Millennium G200 is one of the weakest game performers in the roundup. We had to use Matrox's OpenGL/Direct3D wrapper, since the company's ICD wasn't quite ready, so the score may improve a bit in the future. However, given the G200's performance in other Direct3D games, we don't hold out hope for much improvement The Millennium G200 does show good image quality, especially at true-color resolutions. However, even the Matrox's vaunted image quality falls down just a bit, as evidenced by 3D WinBench 98's trilinear MIPmapping quality test. This version of the G200 supports up to 16MB of SGRAM and has a 250MHZ RAM DAC, which makes it a good solution for professional 2D graphics users who want decent 3D performance. The Millennium G200 would make a good partner for a Voodoo? card, but it really can't keep up with the new competition. Millennium G200. $229 for 16MB, 5149 for 8MB.

STB's image quality was flawless, whereas the Spectra 2500 munged the text status bar in 3D WinBench-a throwback to the early days of the RIVA 128. I didn't notice any of the 2D text fuzziness that was apparent with some of the early RIVA 128 boards. The software bundle is interesting, too. There's a full version of FORSAKEN, but this version has been enhanced to support 32-bit color modes at resolutions up to 1280x1024. STB also ships with Colorific, for color matching and management: 3D Sensations, an effects generator for PowerPoint; and a pair of Assymetric tools for 3D graphics and video editing.

The TNT has dual rendering pipelines and advanced DirectX6 features such as bump mapping and stencil buffering. It has all the imagequality goodies that make for beautiful 3D rendering—and it's fast. The Viper 550 is Diamond's TNT card. It's what we would call a good benchmarking card. It got the highest scores of all the cards on the synthetic benchmarks (WinBench 98, Business WinMark, and 3D WinBench 98). However, it slipped to third place in 3D GameGauge, though just by a few points. Like all Diamond products, the Viper 550 comes with the company's InControl utilities, which have some nice goodies, such as a virtual pop-up of the Start Menu. However, the 3D control panel is more superficial than useful. Like almost all the cards in the roundup, the Viper allows you to turn off V-sync.

"3D TO DIE FOR GE 487.8 W 3D G Hercules Terminator Beast GE MENDED re SE CHELE Canopus Spectra 2500 ***** The Terminator Beast is an interesting board in that it's the only S3 Savage3D-based board in the roundup. Savage3D is S3's try at some 3D redemption in the wake of its poorly performing 3D on the ViRGE series. If the Beast is any indication, this attempt at redemption is mostly successful, but it falls just short of being a complete success. For starters, the Beast supports a maximum of 8MB of video memory. S3 will counter with its texture compression scheme, recently adopted by Microsoft for DirectX6. The fact is, though, that not all games will use texture compression, so you fall back on the AGP bus. And while AGP is relatively fast compared to PCI, it's not as fast as local video memory. Maximum 3D resolution is limited, too, and as more games support triple buffering this will become a bigger problem. Another controversial issue is the Beast's capability to automatically precompress textures in games that don't support texture compression. We ran 3D GameGauge and 3D WinBench with autocompression on and off the benchmark numbers are with compression off). We squinted and watched carefully and didn't notice any serious artifacting on the fly. Curiously enough, the Beast comes with presets for the various 3D GameGauge Direct3D games. OpenGL support is through both an ICD and a direct-to-the metal mini-GL driver. The ICD is slower, but supports full OpenGL functionality. while the mini-GL driver is tuned for QUAKE Il-based games. We used the mini-GL driver for our testing. We did notice some odd artifacting with Direct3D games on the 450MHz testbed-white dots that would appear in a regular pattern—this was not an encouraging sight. In addition, the transparent name boxes in MOTORHEAD disappeared when running on the Terminator. We also had some setup problems on an Abit-equipped 300MHz Pentium Il that were solved only by getting a new motherboard BIOS update. The board is fast, placing between the TNT and Banshee boards in 3D GameGauge scores. The 2D WinBench score essentially tied the ASUS board for last place. Overall, the Terminator Beast is a modest board with ambitious goals that it doesn't quite meet. Terminator Beast. $149 8MB S GRAM with TV-out $129 8MB SDRAM no TV-out.

Canopus launches a new -product name with the Spectra 2500, which is a RIVA TNT board distinguished by its compact size and the presence of a small fan on the RIVA TNT chip-something they started with the Pure 3D II. The Spectra 2500 generated the highest 3D GameGauge score of the roundup, though the STB lagged by an insignificant amount. However, an image-quality problem cropped up in 3D WinBench 98—the text status bar was garbled in many of the scenes. We didn't see any serious artifacting in the games used in our testing, but this kind of problem is a bit worrisome. Let's hope it's something that can be fixed with a driver revision. The Spectra control panel covers a lot of bases (though not as many as STB's tweak panel) but it's somewhat disorganized The Spectra 2500 is built to coexist with 3Dfx add-on boards.

"3D TO DIE FOR CGW's Image Quality Hall of Shame All the makers of the various chips and cards are A touting their image quality.

"3D TO DIE FOR The Glide Factor or a game to take advantage of a 3D accelerator, it requires a way for the software to get at the 3D accelerator's functionality. This junction is called an API (applications programming interface) Choosing the right 3D accelerator is complicated by the widespread adoption of a proprietary API, 3Dfx's Glide, which made a lot of sense a couple of years ago. Direct3D was pretty pathetic, and OpenGL support wasn't yet widespread. We're starting to see a waning of Glide-only games (most new titles that have Glide support will also support either Direct3D or OpenGL). Still, there are a lot of existing Glide-only titles, and there are still a few key games showing up every dayINDEPENDENCE WAR, for example, If you're buying a new system, the best gaming rig you can get is one with a fast AGP 2X board, like one of the RIVA TNT boards, and a Voodoo card. If you're really hard-core, you could always add a second Voodoo board for SLI, but that's excessive for most users. If you're buying a new system and you already have a Voodoo board, there's probably no reason to upgrade to Voodoo? Get a TNT board instead. With multitexture support in both DirectX6 and OpenGL, as well as impressive 2D speed, TNT covers quite a few bases, and you can use the Voodoo board for Glide titles. Banshee throws an interesting wrinkle into the equation. It's reasonably fast in Direct3D and OpenGL, but it's no replacement for Voodoo? . On the other hand, If you're on a fairly tight budget, Banshee looks pretty promising, although there seem to be a few early glitches with Glide--but perhaps no more so than Voodoo? had when it shipped. Banshee also doesn't support single-pass multitexturing. On the upside, it is not a Voodoo Rush redux, since Banshee's 2D performance is quite good. So Banshee's a good budget solution: It offers Glide sudport, although it doesn't equal TNT in overall performance.

SEGA AMB ASUS V3000ZXTV * * ** * in a time when Banshee and I TNT boards are being announced seemingly by the truckload, ASUS has shot squarely behind the moving target and released a RIVA 128zx board. The good news is that it's cheap ($129 MSRP). But compared to the current generation of cards, it's slow and suffers the nowfamiliar image-quality problems seen with the RIVA 128 series.

Speed is the key There are several trends evolving in computer games that should shape your decision when considering a new graphics card. One important trend is multitexturing support. More games are doing multipass rendering in which textures are blended together. This results in more realistic surfaces and better lighting/shadow effects. Single-pass multitexturing allows a 3D accelerator to blend multiple textures in one rendering pass. Until recently, only Voodoo? had multitexture support-and only in Glide/OpenGL. The RIVA TNT, with its dual texturing pipelines, has multitexturing capability, which becomes apparent in QUAKE Il tests. Banshee boards trailed the performance of the stock PA2000 Voodoocard by a wide margin on QUAKE II, even though they ran ahead of the Voodoo board in many Direct3D games. DirectX6 has full support for multitexturing, so we'll likely see more multitextured games in the future. The recent trend toward dual rendering engines in newly announced chips only adds fuel to this fire. Another trend is the movement toward richer texture sets. This has happened more slowly than we expected, but we are beginning to see titles with 20+MB of textures in scenes. Some of these titles, like Criterion's REDLINE RACER, were also designed with AGP in mind. The trend toward higher polygon counts has an effect, too, because more vertex data needs to be sent over the bus. The full setup engine in most newer chips eases the problem a bit, but it's still there. Huge texture sets coupled with high polygon counts can really saturate the bandwidth of the bus. This partially explains the trend to large amounts of local video memory. AGP version 1.0 maxes out at 528MB per second—but smaller amounts of textures need to be retrieved at any moment in time if AGP execute mode is used. Still, the bandwidth problem has brought us to AGP 2.0 (a.k.a. AGP Pro), which doubles maximum AGP throughput to 1GB/sec. We should see the first AGP Pro boards early next year. 266 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "

One thing is apparent from our testing of all the Banshee boards: This is not your Daddy's Voodoo Rush.

Despite having 125MHz SGRAM, the AGP Monster Fusion board never got more than warm, as opposed to other Banshee boards that got almost too hot to touch. It was almost, but not quite, ready to ship when we checked it out. Both the AGP and PCI versions would crash to the Windows desktop when trying to run the 1.3 and 1.4 versions of MOTORHEAD.

"3D TO DIE FOR Event Horizons and Trends There are a number of incoming chips that we picked up in our over-the-horizon radar. They continue a couple of interesting trends that we've seen in our roundup. The first trend is boards with lots of local video memory. Most of the boards tested now ship in 16MB versions, and some retail boards are available only in 16MB versions. (For the price conscious, beware that some OEM boards may only have 8MB, and may not be expandable.) Even 8MB Voodoo boards have all but disappeared, with 12MB boards now the norm. Number Nine is even shipping a 32MB version of its Revolution IV, and ATI has announced a pair of 32MB products using their Rage 128 chip. Another trend is integration of dual rendering pipelines. The first part with dual-rendering pipelines on a single chip is nVidia's TNT. The Rage 128, which is probably shipping as you read this, also sports dual-rendering engines, as does 3Dlabs Permedia 3 and Rendition's recently announced Rredline accelerator. So here's a quick rundown on each of these new parts. The Bottom Line ATI's new part, Permedia 3 will also be built using a 0.25 micron process and will max out at 16MB of SDRAM or SGRAM. ATI Rage 128 The Rage 128 has been redesigned I from the ground up and bears little resemblance to the Rage Pro. In addition to two rendering pipelines, it has full hardware DVD decoder capability on the chip. So with the right software support for DVD region encryption, you won't even need a daughtercard. The chip is manufactured using a process (0.25 micron) that can cram more transistors in a given space the Rage 128 has 7 million transistors. The first versions will likely run at 100MHz, but 125 and 150MHz is possible. The chip can also support a higher speed variant of SDRAM, called Double Data Rate RAM (DDR RAM.) ATI is shipping two boards of interest to gamers. The Rage Fury uses the Rage 128GL chip, which also powers a workstation cardthe Rage Magnum. The Fury comes with TV-out and 32MB of RAM; the announced price is $299 for 32MB. The Xpert 128 will have 16MB of RAM, and will cost less. Driver support is likely to be robust, with full DirectX6 and OpenGL ICD drivers. Rendition Rredline M ot a lot is known about this Vchip yet. It does have dual rendering engines, and apparently has on-chip support for dual monitors. Rendition is aiming for the 250 megapixel range at a minimum. The company, recently acquired by Micron, is under the gun to deliver a competitive part. Rendition was one of the first companies to ship a 3D accelerator aimed at gamers, but they haven't been able to keep up with the frantic release schedule of new technology from competitors. Let's hope that the Rredline will keep this 3D pioneer in prime fighting form. in scoring the cards, we took a look at several factors. Setup I was an important issue, but most cards these days are reasonably easy to install. Most cards also now ship with independent setup programs that allow you to force a driver install if Windows is reluctant. We noted any setup issues in the individual reviews. Included in our setup considerations were any supplied control panel or accessory software to tweak the card. Performance in 3D GameGauge was the major test, but we also took a good look at synthetic benchmark results. Image quality has also figured high on our list. Additional features, such as enhanced expandability, were also taken into consideration, and software bundles were only a minor consideration. Based on this, our pick for top honors is the STB Velocity 4400. Although the Canopus Spectra 2500 had marginally higher 3D GameGauge numbers, the image-quality problem we noticed in 3D WinBench 98 concerns us. Diamond's Viper 550 is a great card, too, but the control panel utilities aren't quite as robust as the STB's. Don't sell the Banshee cards short, either. Although 3D GameGauge performance trailed the TNT boards, the ability to run Glide (3Dfx) games is a big plus, as is their relatively low cost. Of the two shipping quality Banshee boards, the Guillemot Phoenix is our pick. It's combination of low cost and good performance makes it a winner for those on a budget. Diamond's Monster Fusion looks promising-particularly the AGP version, with SGRAM on board—but it wasn't quite final when we looked at it. The Terminator Beast is an interesting product that generated good 3D GameGauge scores, but we have some concerns about image quality and 2D performance. The 8MB limitation is also an issue. The Matrox boards--the speed king in 2D/3D combo cards only a couple of months ago-have already been eclipsed, though the Marvel G200 is an excellent multipurpose board. All of these boards easily eclipse last years crop of 3D accelerators. It's clear from recent announcements that the graphics chip battles are far from over. But these accelerators are finally approaching the kind of features and performance that we've all been longing for. CGW 3DLabs Permedia 3 The Permedia 3 has twin rendering I engines and the ability to manage texture usage in hardware. At presstime, no boards have been publicly announced. On paper, the chip looks pretty fast-3DLabs is claiming a maximum fill-rate of 250Mpixels/sec. Like PowerVR Second Generation Afe've heard relatively little from Videologic or NEC on the PowerVR front. The PVRSG, as it's known, still uses the infinite planes rendering method, but adds a lot of hardware functionality to accelerate Direct3D better. NEC's plans for PC products have been somewhat delayed because Sega chose PowerVR for its Dreamcast console system, which has been eating into NEC/Videologic engineering resources, though it's possible we'll see PC product early in 1999. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"IMAC Despite some forward-thinking design ideas, iMac too often favors form over function, which will put it on the express train toward obsolescence for gamers. espite its reputation for innovation, Apple was recently a company in need of good news. The company that brought the graphical user interface (GUI) to the masses in 1984 was facing eroding marketshare, a sagging stock price, and a serious crisis of confidence among the Macintosh faithful. Enter the iMac, Apple's paean to the original Macintosh, which upon its release started selling like gangbusters. Apple seems to have a runaway hit on its hands, so much so that Japanese consumers can't even get their hands on one. Heck, we had to do a midnight raid on sister-publication Equip just to get one (don't tell them we swiped it.) In some sense, the iMac, which is targeted at new users interested primarily in the Internet, does mark a return to glory for the house that Steve and Woz built. But is this wnderbox something gamers are going to want? Not if they are serious about gaming. to the point of uselessness. One happy footnote: Logitech's twobutton USB mouse with scrollwheel does work with the iMac, although Logitech hasn't yet made a driver available to enable full functionality. Another annoyance is that this sucker is noisy, mainly because the CPU is on your desktop. The combination of CPU fan noise, the hard-drive spinning, and the spinning up of the CD-ROM drive makes quite a ruckus. COMPUTER Virtual PC Gaming o you love your Mac, but you want to play the latest PC games now. Don't despair. Virtual PC (VPC) by Connectix could be your passport into the world of PC gaming. Essentially, VPC emulates a Pentium MMX machine in software running on top of the Macos. Installation is easy, and either Windows 95 or 98 comes with the package. You can practically get it up and running faster than a real PC. All of the Mac's hardware can be used by DOS or Windows software running on VPC, including the Mac's built in audio hardware, which is seen by VPC as a Sound Blaster. VPC also has full Ethernet support for PC networking. I found out about VPC when a Machead friend of mine lamented over not being able to play AGE OF EMPIRES because a Mac port isn't yet available. We picked up a couple copies of VPC, and within the hour, we were locked in pitched multiplayer battle-even using the RISE OF ROME expansion pack. Game performance was significantly slower than with a real Pentium, but it was good enough to keep us playing. Owners of high-end G3 Macs will obviously see the best results. You'll probably want at least 64—96MB of RAM to keep things going smoothly. We were able to run VPC on the iMac, but it was slower because of iMac's paltry 32MB of RAM. Despite the VPC's drawback of needing a boatload of memory, there are other gaming benefits-one being that VPC fully supports any Voodoo Graphics or Voodoo PCI card installed in the Mac, even if the MacOS can't see the card. VPC also allows Microsoft's DirectX technology to talk to the Mac's hardware, and it's this degree of compatibility and flexibility that's really impressive. There are a few tweaks you can make to speed things up, such as replacing the Macos' Finder with the VPC application. Again, don't expect lightning-fast performance, but VPC will certainly get you in the game. -Kenneth Johnson GAMING ***** You've Got the Look... In returning to the integrated CPU/CRT design of the original Mac, iMac brings a streamlined retro look to an industry chockfull of beige box and monitor combos. Unfortunately, despite some forward-thinking design ideas, iMac too often favors form over function, which will put it on the express train toward obsolescence for gamers. Somewhat reminiscent of the Macs of old is iMac's lack of upgradability and limited accessibility to what few upgrades are possible. Then of course, there are the glaring design holes, like oh, say, the complete lack of removable writable media. That's right no floppy drive, no Zip drive, nothing. Let me give you an idea of the aggravation this can cause: The only way I could actually write this piece on the iMac was to hook up its modem, connect to my ISP, and email the review to myself. Apple will be making a USB floppy drive for iMac that may be available as you read this, and lomega has announced a USB Zip drive due out later this year or early next year. But these devices won't be cheap and will detract from iMac's integrated design. For all of its aspirations, iMac winds up often feeling like a 38pound laptop. Highlights include a CD-ROM drive that could have easily been pulled from a laptop-and at least mobile machines have solved the inte grated floppy/CD-ROM problem. Rounding out the mix is a small keyboard with a mushy action, and a hockey puck-like mouse, which might be useful for those in the animal kingdom not graced with opposable thumbs, but for humans it's uncomfortable almost WORLD Break It Down the iMac's CPU is a G3 233MHz PowerPC. This is an extremely capable CPU that can move business apps and games along well. G3s feature a 512KB Level 2 (L2) cache with its own backside bus that runs at half the CPU's core clock-rate (similar to Pentium II's architecture.) This CPU talks to 32MB of SDRAM (upgradable to 128MB), which runs at 66MHz, yielding a peak system memory data rate of 528MB/sec (current PCs max out at 800MB/sec). iMac's 233MHz clock rate may seem low, but appreciate that architectural differences between PowerPC and Pentium II give PowerPC a floating-point advantage at similar clock rates. Comparisons are difficult to make here, owing to the lack of a cross-platform 3D benchmark. But iMac's CPU probably performs more like a 300MHz Pentium II for floating-point operations, which would seem to bode well for 3D performance. That is, until you look at the 3D accelerator it's talking to. The iMac uses ATI's woefully outdated Rage Ilc graphics chipset, which shipped in late 1997.

"IMAC 3D technology, but you're stuck with it. No upgrade options here. In its day, Rage Ilc was a decent 3D performer, capable of about 30Mpixels/sec of fill rate and a peak triangle rate of around 250,000 triangles/sec. But current 3D accelerators have nearly quadrupled that level of performance. Rage Ilc doesn't have an onboard triangle setup engine; rendering work will have to be done on the CPU. Even so, what you most likely wind up with is a 3D pipeline that's fill-rate limited. In other words, the Rage lic will most likely be the bottleneck. The graphics chip is another potential slow spot. It sits on a 33MHz PCI bus, whose top-end data rate is 133MB/sec-one-quarter the peak data rate of AGP 2X. The news on the 2D side is better since Rage Ilc and ATI's more recent Rage Pro have the same 2D core. Also disappointing is that iMac ships with only 2MB of video memory, which limits you to a 3D resolution of 640x480x16 (doublebuffered with z-buffer). You're also limited to 1024x768x65,535 colors for your 2D graphics. You can upgrade the video memory to 8MB, but good luck getting the case opened. Because of iMac's entry-level target market, its innards are not easily accessed. There were rumors at press time that Apple was considering ATI's Rage Pro accelerator to replace the Rage lic. But if Apple is serious about 3D gaming, it would do well to consider ATI's newest part—the Rage 128, which looks to be a promising part Another news note: ATI has announced that it will be providing OpenGL acceleration for all G3 Macs, including the iMac. In the mass-storage department, the most notable change is the lack of SCSI, a hallmark of all Macs. Instead, iMac ships with an EIDE 4GB hard drive, and a 24x CD-ROM drive. This latter component has a particularly cheap feel to it, similar to those found in laptops. As for audio, iMac has an onboard sound chip, the details of which are somewhat sketchy. On its Web site, Apple states merely that this chip supports CD-quality audio resolution (44.1 KHz, 16-bit, stereo). A nice touch here is two front-mounted, Walkman-style headphone jacks, which mute the front-facing speakers. Audio in these headphone jacks is clean, and there's no audible hash. However, the iMac's speakers are at best anemic, and because they lack a woofer driver, low-end response is virtually nonexistent. Apple has included a line-out jack on the iMac's side to route audio to external speakers. for adding peripherals to iMac, Apple went long on the Universal Serial Bus (USB). Both the keyboard and mouse connect via USB, and the keyboard has two conveniently placed USB ports, one at each end. Gone are traditional Macintosh connectivity options such as Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), modem and printer ports, and LocalTalk port, which Macs use for peer-to-peer networking. In some ways, this is a good thing, since ADB could be somewhat unstable when devices were disconnected and reconnected often. The LocalTalk port has been replaced by an onboard 10/100-Base-T Ethernet connection, which will allow for much faster network connections. However, because this is the first Mac to ship with USB, a fair ques tion to ask is: What exactly can you connect to this thing? At this point, the answer seems to be \"very little.\" Because iMac lacks ADB, traditional Mac game controllers can't be connected to it, and while both ThrustMaster, Gravis, and CH Products have announced future USB game controllers for iMac, none were available at press time. Also, Apple's external floppy drive and lomega's Zip drive for the iMac will both connect via USB. Rounding out iMac's I/O lineup is an internal 56K modem that supports both K56Flex and the new V.90 (Open56K) standard. Internet-pretty well. For casual gamers not terribly interested in 3D performance, iMac will again work. But for serious gamers of any stripe, iMac is not the way to go. There are just too many limiting factors, not to mention a dearth of upgrade options. Serious Mac gamers should be looking to Apple's higher end G3 Macs for their expandability. (Read: You can put a Voodoo2 card in them.) The Mac gaming community continues to plod on, and there are a decent number of titles out there for the Mac-provided that you don't mind being razzed by all your PC gaming friends who have been playing the titles for months (sometimes years) before you. So if your mother-in-law is looking to check out this whole \"Internet thing,\" get her an iMac. Or if your cousin Smedley is looking to get into strategy games and is really excited about playing RIVEN, get him an iMac. But if you want to enjoy the best that gaming has to offer, look elsewhere. CGW So What the Hell Can Macs Play? Despite the lag between when a PC title ships and the time its Mac port ships, there are a fair number of Mac games to be had. Here's a brief listing of relatively recent titles: Title Publisher Game On We took the iMac for a quick spin through some games, including MACQUAKE, WARCRAFT II, and MYTH. In all three titles, performance wasn't a problem. But in MACQUAKE, the game couldn't recognize iMac's mouse, probably because the game was trying to poll for the ADB mouse directly, so mouse-looking wasn't an option. Installing the iMac Updater 1.0 from Apple's Web site failed to resolve the problem. Interestingly, both WARCRAFT II and MYTH had no mouse problems and ran fine. iMac comes bundled with Shiny's MDK, which ran fine as well, although Rage Ilc's image quality was mediocre. For the more valiant tweaker, emulation packages like Virtual PC and SoftWindows allow Macs to run Windows 95, and you can run some Windows 95 games this way, albeit at a somewhat slower speed than on a PC (see sidebar). nowest And Now a Word From Our Benchmark W e put the iMac through its paces running ZDBOP's MacBench VV 5.0, which measures CPU 2D graphics, hard-disk, and CD-ROM performance. This benchmark normalizes scores to Apple's G3 300MHz Mac. In just about all categories, iMac stacks up well, so business apps should move along well, as will games that don't make intensive use of 3D graphics. Age of Empires (early 1999) ......

"3D Sucks THE HOOD 3D Sucks What We Need Is Games That Use 3D, Not 3D Games Roughly 140,000 men are arrayed opposite each other in colorful uniforms in a scant square mile of gently rolling hills. It rained the night before, and the ground is soggy. On one side is Napoleon Bonaparte's Army du Nord while on the other is a mixed bag of British regulars and Belgian, German, and Dutch forces of varying quality. It's kay, now put down the torches, pitchforks, and battering rams. I see that some of you may have taken offense at the headline on this article. I suppose it's understandable, since you just dropped $500 for a set of the latest 3D graphics wonder accelerators. But now that I have your attention, hear me out. Just before I sat down to write this, I was up to my eyeballs inside the latest iteration of the No-Holds-Barred Machine. We used it for our graphics card testing in 1998's massive graphics card roundup. It's made up of a 450MHz Pentium II and some of the hottest 3D rendering hardware ever developed. But it's terrible. Let me tell you why. Napoleon's last, desperate bid to return to power. The artillery barrage begins at around 11:30 a.m. Soon, French forces are pressing forward to the two fortified chateaus-farms really—that anchor each flank. Smoke begins to drift off the battlefield. By the time the battle is over, the French will have attacked with 12 heavy cavalry charges. Men are surging all over the battlefield, fighting desperately. Thousands of horses are swirling around, trying to break the squares; artillery is firing incessantly; horse artillery is galloping back and forth. but the monsters are ugly, in an unintentional way. Mechanical games fare a bit better, because you can render a jet fighter with several hundred triangles and it will look pretty good. But it's still not photorealistic. And if you tried to render the Allied raid on the Ploesti oilfields in World War II in its full scale, with hundreds of bombers disgorging their bomb loads while hundreds of German fighters defend against them, you'd still bring any PC to a standstill. It's not just the graphics accelerators, but the entire pipeline that are to blame. CPUs aren't fast enough, the graphics cards aren't fast enough-and even if they were, scene management would be staggeringly difficult. Technologies like Microsoft's Fahrenheit will help with the Render This, Pal Try to render such a scene and you'll find you can't. The number of polygons and textures that it would take to realistically render LOYD CASE Rendering History Let's go back in time a bitabout 183 years. It's June 18, 1815. We're just outside of Mont St. Jean, a small town in Belgium, not far from the French border. To realistically render the Battle of St. Jean, a small town in Belgium, Waterloo would choke a supercomputer. the Battle of Waterloo would choke a supercomputer. The current state of 3D graphics is such that the game developers can do a fairly good job with corridor shooters although I'm getting pretty tired of seeing polygonal mon sters. Not to pick on UNREAL, which is a beautifully ren dered game in many respects, management of big scenes-but imagine the hardware require ments to render millions of polygons with true color textures at 60fps (frames per second). There's lots of work going on to try to solve this problem. For example, a number of 3D hardware companies are beginning to wonder if maybe the triangle as a primitive has run out of gas. It's very possible that the 3D accelerator of tomorrow may spit out graphics in ways that no accelerator today uses. So be aware that today's hot 3D card may look as pathetic to us in a few years as an EGA card looks today. Having said all of that, that doesn't mean that you should despair and toss that 450MHZ wonder in the nearest river. 3D? WHAT 3D? Although AGE OF EMPIRES II looks 3D, it doesn't make use of 3D acceleration at all. 306 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  DECEMBER 1998 www.computergaming.com "


"LOYD CASE I mean, who really cares? Maybe there should be an industry-wide rule that says we take all technology terms out of the hands of the people who write the marketing copy on the game boxes and in the ads. LOOKING GOOD Although clever programmers can achieve good results without 3D acceleration, games like UNREAL show without a doubt why 3D accelerators are here to stay. The Play's the Thing 3D graphics technology is near and dear to my heart, as many of you know. But I've seen too many people argue over what 3D accelerator is the \"best,\" and most of the time the discussions get very emotional. I get a lot of email asking me if the seemingly infinite upgrade cycle will ever end. The answer is, probably not, as long as the game developers keep ratcheting up the visual quality, the complexity, and the realism of titles. At some point, we'll be able to run three monitors at 1280x1024 with photorealistic scenes at 30fps. When that happens, maybe the upgrade cycle will slow down. But that's a few years off. Meanwhile, a lot of great titles will be coming out3D or not-so enjoy what's there. I know I will. Okay, I'll get off my soapbox now and delve back into some technology topic next month. Remember, though, that all of this is really about having an immersive experience that's been created by someone whose main focus should be to entertain us. All the cool hardware in the world can't make a game like OUTPOST any better. CGW FALCON 3 is still one of the best flight sims ever, and the planes in that game had all of 20 triangles. While the best we can do today is roughly approximate reality, it's certainly a very big step forward. 3D: It's a Technology, Stupid Then there are game companies that try to capitalize on the latest trend. This really steams me. I read recently about one game developer who proposed an idea to a game-company executive. The game was a turnbased strategy game, as I recall. The developer was asked if the game used 3D. After a moment of stunned silence, the developer pointed out that it was a turnbased strategy game. He was told in no uncertain terms that 3D graphics is the new trend, and he should seriously consider making his title 3D. This meant that the poor sap would have to spend countless hours making 3D graphics work that could be put into Al, better 2D graphics, more atmospheric sound, and better gameplay-all for a game that didn't really need 3D graphics in the first place. Last month, I talked to a number of game programmers about how 3D art is created and brought into games. One developer-who will remain nameless—told me that the reason the performance budget for graphics was so high was a sad and simple truth: \"Graphics sells games.\" would dearly like to see a day when game boxes no longer feature text that touts \"Multipass rendering with colored lighting!\" Tech Tips Gettin' the Boot I was quite pleasantly surprised to find that the full install version of the Windows 98 CD is a bootable CD. So if you have a system that can boot from a CD-ROM drive, then installing Windows has just gotten a lot easier. Disk House Cleaning If you've had OS/2 or a boot manager like System Commander installed, and you no longer need them, having the boot manager prompt come up may annoy you. All you need to do to remove this is to restore the Windows 95/98 master boot record. Boot to the DOS prompt and type the following: FDISK /MBR Then reboot. Since FDISK is a potentially dangerous program, you may want back up your valuable data. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 307 "

"REVIEW  SOUND BLASTER LIVE Audio Environmentalist Get Ready to Fork Out for Four Speakers HARDWARE CREATIVE BLASTER Way So vironmental and by Dave Salvator CI Audio has been on the scene now for about two years. During that time, such audio-chip makers as Ensoniq, Aureal Semiconductor, ESS, and Crystal Semiconductor have all introduced PCI audio accelerators, with mixed results. In addition to moving over to a new bus it could call home, audio also expanded into a third dimension, thanks in large part to Aureal Semiconductor's ABD standard. But missing from this PCI audio love-in was any participation from that PC audio Goliath, Creative Labs. Well, the waiting is over. Creative's latest offering, the Sound Blaster Live! (SB Live), is here, and it has a lot to offer. SB Live brings an awful lot together, including its own Environmental Audio Extensions (EAX) and DirectSound acceleration for games, two very solid wavetable synthesizers, digital audio in/out, and ample real-time effects processing horsepower that's ideal for dabbling musicians. So the news about SB Live is for the most part very good, but there are a few gotchas to consider. Get Live The SB Live arrives with ample bundleware, and installation of the card proved to be a breeze. Once you've installed everything you can pick and choose which apps you want to install), you'll find that your Desktop has grown a second \"Start\" menu. This second menu is for tweaking the SB Live, and there are actually quite a few bells and whistles to play with. Creative helps you out here: The interface makes most of the tweaks fairly comprehensible. SB Live contains several new goodies, although only some are specifically aimed at gamers. The most noticeable thing is real-time effects processing of all audioWave, MIDI, Line-In, and Audio CD. More than just reverb and chorus, these effects include flanging, echo, and pitch shifting. Each effect can be tweaked, and you can create audio environments in which you can run up to four of these effects simultaneously. SB Live also ships with many preconfigured environments for already shipping games, and while these environments are a blanket effect for all audio played in the game, they can add to the overall effect. Curiously absent from all these controls is a graphic EQ for tonal shaping. In some close listening tests using headphones, SB Live's two line outputs for speakers were very clean, and the chip was hiss-free with all mixer faders at full gain (without audio playing). For new games, Creative is courting game developers with its EAX technology, which is an API extension to DirectSound 3D that adds reverberant characteristics to different parts of a gameworld. With this technology, each room in a game can sound different. Creative's technology doesn't use room geometry from the graphics engine, but rather applies predefined approximations for size and reflectivity of a room. However, these approximations do a pretty good job of making big rooms sound big and small rooms sound, of all things, small. But, there's a catch: Creative says that you'll want to have a four-channel speaker setup (two fronts, two rears, and a subwoofer) to get the most out of EAX, and from my testing, using four channels is the only way to go. During gameplay in the EAX-enhanced version of UNREAL, you get terrific ambient effects and 3D positional audio, but SB Live's 3D positional audio in two speakers is just underwhelming. To make a fourchannel setup enticing, Cambridge SoundWorks now ships a fourchannel version of its PCWorks speakers for $99. Or if you like your current speakers, you can get a pair of low-cost satellites to use as your rear-channel speakers. Either way though, you're looking at additional cost to get the optimal effect from SB Live. part, but it lacks the horsepower of SB Live. Also, one of Creative's primary competitors, Aureal Semiconductor, has a yearand-a-half lead in evangelizing its A3D standard, which many games have already adopted. And at press time, boards based on Aureal's new Vortex 2 chip were getting pretty close to shipping, and SB Live doesn't have support for ABD. Aside from Creative's EAX and Aureal's A3D, the other API is Microsoft's DirectSound 3D, which over time will begin to absorb some of the current features found in these two proprietary technologies. But until then, we'll have to wade through the muck stirred up by competing standards. COMPUTER GAMING * * * * * WORLD APPEAL: Gamers with a musical bent who can afford four speakers. PROS: Very solid DirectSound accelerator; excellent digital connectivity very cool real-time effects processing: great wavetable. CONS: Needs four speakers to really achieve optimal effect; doesn't support A3D: pricey. Price: 5199 Manufacturer: Creative Labs Milpitas, CA (800) 998-1000 www.soundblaster.com The Hard Sell Creative's EAX technology does work well in four speakers, but in wooing game developers, Creative faces several serious challenges. First, there aren't that many SB Lives out there yet, and Creative is aiming SB Live squarely at the retail channel. For system makers, Creative is pushing its Sound Blaster PCI 128, which is a decent Final Mix-Down In Sound Blaster Live!, you have a solid DirectSound 3D accelerator with the added pizzazz of EAX for an even more immersive effect. But to really get the full effect, you'll need to augment your speaker setup with a pair of rear channels. If you're a musician with a gaming bent, then SB Live offers quite a few enticing features, including digital audio in/out via SP/DIF connectors on a second back panel. But because of the current API belching contest, SB Live won't support Aureal's A3D standard; titles using that API will be accelerated either via DirectSound3D or not at all.

"INTERLINK ELECTRONICS DESKSTICK REVIEW Nipple Ring by Dave Salvator hen laptop makers were trying to develop a convenient, portable pointing device, they came up with several design innovations, including the TouchPad and the TrackPoint. This SHARDWARE COMPUTER GAMIN ***** latter design, pioneered by IBM, used a pencil eraser-sized \"mouse-as-joystick\" approach and found favor among laptop makers for several yearsalthough the newer TouchPad design is currently more popular on laptops. Now, Interlink Electronics is trying to find a new home for the TrackPoint-type pointing device: your desktop rig. Its new DeskStick mouse is relatively comfortable to use, and business application users accustomed to this type of pointer will feel right at home. There's just one problem: DeskStick makes a terrible mouse for gaming. DeskStick installs without incident and connects via a 9-pin serial port or a PS/2-style mouse port. Its software installed easily and was well-behaved running on WORLD When entering a room, if a monster attacked from behind or from a side, turning around to return fire was awkward and made general move. ment through levels much more difficult. Next, I took it for a spin in AGE OF EMPIRES. Here again, it functioned correctly but wasn't very easy to use, primarily because click-dragging-an essential function for selecting groups of units-is awkward. If you pine for that old TrackPoint mouse you had on your last laptop, DeskStick is the mouse for you. But if you want a mouse that's good for gaming, consider something else, such as Logitech's MouseMan+. CGW Windows 98, and offers basic tweaks for speed and acceleration. DeskStick works fine as a Desktop pointing device, although driving the GUI with this type of controller takes some getting used to if you never had one in a laptop. Where DeskStick squarely falls down is when you go to boot up your favorite games. In a quick jaunt through QUAKE, Desk Stick correctly emulated a normal mouse, but trying to accurately mouse-look with it proved to be nearly impossible. APPEAL: Gamers never properly weaned from their laptops. PROS: It works: nifty colored nipple covers. CONS: Abysmal mouse for use in games, somewhat unwieldy for selecting specific objects on screen Price: 559 Manufacturer: Interlink Electronics, Inc (800) 484-8380 photo: Michael Falconer www.interlinkelec.com REVIEW QUICKSHOT GENX 700 CONTROLLER Style Over Substance by Loyd Case yahe GenX 700 looks cool. doesn't cost much, and has lots of features, all of which sounds great on paper, but when you dig underneath, you find that it lacks something important: control. COMPUTER GAMNG ** WORLD The GenX 700 is a big controller, but it's lightweight and sits in your lap fairly easily. The handle is comfortable-although it's a tad too contoured for my taste. On the left side is a large, oblong shape that looks vaguely like one of the Zerglings from STARCRAFT. It's actually the throttle control and turns out to be quite comfortable. It's easily the best thing about this controller. The GenX requires a keyboard pass-through as well as a game controller connection. I had no problems attaching it to a Falcon Northwest Pentium Il system, which is good because that means that the controller doesn't have any issues with fast keyboard ports. The GenX 700 comes with two Windows 9x drivers: One supports analog throttle and the other supports analog hat. You have to manually shift the non-analog device into \" digital\" mode or the game will get confused. I ran the GenX 700 through a couple of flight sims and BATTLEZONE. The throttle actually works pretty well, but the handle action was far too light for my taste. Worse, the action was vaque and imprecise, and I found it nearly impossible to get good flight control out of it. All in all, I suggest giving the GenX 700 a pass-or maybe give it to a friend who wants to make an artistic statement on their desktop, rather than actually play games. CGW APPEAL: Gamers on a budget looking for an all-in-one game controller. PROS: It's a multipurpose controller easy throttle control. CONS: Action is too light and too vague; buttons have fixed key assignments. The keyboard pass-through serves one function: to pass along the fixed key assignments of the \"digital\" buttons. The GenX 700 is not a programmable device. For example, if you shift the rotational handle into digital mode, the handle issues a \".\" (comma) character. While this is a common key assignment for rudders, if you don't like a particular keystroke being issued you're out of luck.

"REVIEW KENWOOD MULTIBEAM 40X PLUS CD-ROM DRIVE Zen and the Art of CD-ROM FOOD HARDWARE by Loyd Case first came across Zen Research at this year's Computer Game Developer's conference, back in May. The firm was showing a CD-ROM drive that could play full-motion, full-screen, uncompressed video from a CD with nary a pause. It was amazing. The trick is to have multiple laser beamsCOMPUTER GAMING WORLD **** either multiple emitters or a prismlike mechanism that splits the read laser into multiple beams. Needless to say, I was eager to check out this drive. The first company to ship drives that use Zen's technology is Kenwood, which is trying to break into the data side of the electronics business. This drive is one of those breakthroughs that will confound product reviewers everywhere. First, it really only spins at around 10x speed. It uses seven beams, which are split by a mirror mechanism, to read multiple tracks simultaneously. The problem is that WinBench 98's CDROM benchmarks don't do this technology justice. According to WinBench 98, the maximum transfer rate of the drive is around 2.7MB/sec-more like an 18x drive, and well under the 6MB/sec stat that Kenwood touts. Access time is right around 100ms—that's okay performance, but it's not great. The overall CDROM Win Mark is 1,410—better than 18x drives, but still not as high as the Pioneer 32X, which comes in at around 1,700. the interesting data point is that, even with DMA enabled, the inner track and the outer track both pumped out 2.7MB/sec, which you'd expect from a constant linear velocity (CLV) drive. This goes to show that WinBench 98's CD-ROM tests have some limitations. So I timed the installation of UNREAL, which loads about 330MB of stuff onto a disk, including a fairly large number of files. Most are sequential (as is most data on game CDs). On the APPEAL: Gamers tired of waiting for the dreaded spin up. PROS: Fast where it counts-games. CONS: Slow on benchmarks; too expensive; no SCSI version. Price: $129 Manufacturer: Kenwood Technologies (408) 863-6800 www.kenwoodtech.com Multibeam, UNREAL installed in 2:46. On the Pioneer—which got a higher CD-ROM WinMark-UNREAL took 5:47 to install. Holy moley! Since the drive spins relatively slowly, it never spins down. This alone makes the Kenwood special. The Kenwood drive goes for around $129—pretty enticing. The lack of spin-down and speedy game installs make this a drive worth considering, except, of course, for its lack of a SCSI version.

"REVIEW  MICROSOFT NATURAL KEYBOARD ELITE Microsoft's Unnatural Act HARDWARE by Loyd Case hat were the folks in Redmond thinking? I'm a fan of the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard. I write more than ever, and my hands used to ache after a day of COMPUTER WORLD pounding out copy. The Natural Keyboard relaxed the position of my hands, and now things have gotten much better. So when I heard that Microsoft was coming out with a USB version of the Natural keyboard, I was keenly interested. The good news is that it does work on USB under Windows 98, and it fits in a slightly smaller space on your desk. That's about all the good news. Someone at Microsoft decided that all those smaller keyboard trays—the ones that wouldn't hold the full size Natural Keyboard-needed to be occupied by the Redmond company. too. So they made the keyboard smaller. In the process, the function keys got smaller. Worse, the arrow keys are now in a diamond pattern instead of an inverted T.1 could have gotten used to that, **   APPEAL: People who want to appear smart and hip. PROS: It fits in a smaller apace than did the original CONS: Tiny function keys and braindead utility keys make this a hopeless choice for gamers. but they also shrank the arrow keys. I have stubby fingers and I'm a touch typist. So half the time when I reach up for a function key on the Elite, I miss it entirely. The other half of the time, my finger sort of glances off it. Ditto for the arrow keys. They also rotated the Page Down/Home cluster 90 degrees. Instead of two rows of three keys, there are now three rows of two keys. Dammit, my hands have been trained by hours of playing 3D shooters that the Page Down key is there. Uh-oh, it's not. Uh-oh, I'm fragged. Did I mention that they also made those keys smaller? I've heard inklings that Microsoft may have seen the error of its ways and may be revamping the keyboard again. My advice is simple: Stick with the original layout and just add USB support. Meanwhile, you should avoid this lame excuse for a keyboard. After testing the Elite, I immediately went out a bought two more of the originals. You should, too, if you can find one.

"REVIEW  LOGITECH WINGMAN FORCE A Ship Without a Rudder by Dave Salvator orce-feedback can be a real nuisance. I know CGW has been saying what a wonderful thing force-feedback is, and this does hold true for force-feedback technology's potential. But potential is one COMPUTER HARDWARE GAMING ***** WORLD thing, and having it bring something compelling to play is quite another. Force-feedback is another one of those technologies in which the hardware is leading the software. Game development lags, but there's a crop of force-feedback hardware at the ready. Most of the action is currently in force-feedback wheels, but Logitech is now shipping its Wing Man Force, a thirdgeneration force-feedback stick that gets a lot right, with one big exception: no rudder functionality. Force-feedback devices need bidirectional communication, and Wing Man Force connects via either a serial port or, more impressively, USB. When connecting via the latter, the device is auto-detected by Windows 95/98, and after feeding the driver CD, Wing Man Force is ready to rumble. The Wing Man ships with an easy-to-use programming front-end. You've got five buttons you can drive with your left hand, and four more on the stick itself. The throttle is a wheel design that works fine, though it lacks detentes at either end. The one rough spot is WingMan's view hat, whose eight points aren't well defined, and the result can be unplanned (and unwanted) jumping between views at the wrong moment. But the biggest letdown is Wing Man's lack of rudder function, and its inability to work with analoq rudder pedals. Where WingMan really shines is how it renders forces. Its motors accurately reproduce forces up to 250Hz, which means that subtle forces are more realistically rendered. And because Wing Man supports Immersion's I-Force technology, you can use Immersion's APPEAL: Gamers and flight-sim jockeys who can live without rudder pedals. PROS: Very good force effects; l-Forcecompatible; can be used with I-Force Studio force editor. CONS: No rudder control; can't be used with rudder pedals; cheap-feeling view-hat. Price: $150 (street) Manufacturer: Logitech (510) 795-8500 www.logitech.com excellent -Force Studio force editor. Logitech includes it on the CD, but it's a crippled version. Upgrading to the full version costs $18.95. Logitech has come close with Wing Man Force. It delivers higher resolution force effects than Microsoft's stick, but because of Logitech's glaring lack of rudder functionality, Microsoft's SideWinder Force-Feedback Pro still has the overall edge. If you can live without your rudders, then Wing Man Force is a well-done stick. But if you can't make that trade-off, then give this one a pass.

"REVIEW. TOM CLANCY'S RAINBOW SIX ACTLON No Pot of Gold RAINBOW SIX Is an Ambitious Might-Have Been by Raphael Liberatore olding my breath, ordered, \"Alpha, go!\" Flash grenades detonated with muffled pops, followed by the distinct puff-puff of subsonic rounds fired from suppressed MP5s. \"Tango's down! Tango's down!\" blurted a commando. \"Hostages secure,\" said another. \"Bravo, go!\" My men and I blitzed down the hall as the clap-clap-clap of three Aks rang out from the small firefight erupting in the room ahead. Screams of hostages and commandos taking hits stung my ears, terror ringing in every syllable. \"Man down! Man down! We need backup, now!\" In the doorway, Blue Team's leader slumped to the ground beside two COMPUTER bodies. Quickly setting my weapon to full auto, I signaled my team to engage.... Welcome to RAINBOW SIX (R6). Based on Tom Clancy's recent bestseller, RAINBOW SIX is the code name for an elite unit specializing in counterterrorist and CQB (Close Quarters Battle) operations. As I'm a former SpecOps team member, a game that emphasizes planning and executing counterterrorist operations holds obvious appeal for me. Unfortunately, R6 doesn't quite meet its mission goals, shooting itself in the foot when it should ing itself in the foot when it should be taking out terrorists. The Best-Laid Plans After some opening FMV that details the establishing of the RAINBOW SIX unit as a response to growing global terrorism, you can train in several obstacle courses, gun ranges, and kill houses modeled after real elite forces' training environments. While the game's multiple keyboard commands will take you a while to master, the realism and technical accuracy of CQB training is impressive, schooling you in fire and movement, planning, and teamwork. R6 combines planning and action, but the game's blood and GAMING WORLD guts reside in the mission-planning phase. Once a new campaign is selected, the game takes you to your first Mission Briefing. There you'll meet advisors who quickly set the scene and tell you your mission goals. Next comes the Intel screen, at which point you gather background information on suspected terrorists and their organizations, key biographies, news clippings, and anything else pertinent to your assigned mission. Together, the Mission Briefing and Intel screens create a world full of machinations, adding to an already realistic gaming experience. You can choose up to eight operatives per mission from an international pool of elite counterterrorists. Operative bios detail their crosstraining and skill levels in assault, demolitions, electronics, and reconnaissance as well as ratings in leadership, stamina, aggression, and more. Remarkably, it struck me that none of R6's U.S. operatives had served with any of the United States' elite military units, such as SOF Delta, Navy Seals, or Army Special Forces. For a game so concerned with realism, it's a notable omission. Later, you pick each operative's equipment, called kits, before assigning each man to a team. R6 allows up to four teams for deployment. Choosing equipment from the provided arsenal is a breeze and includes the popular MP5 or CAR-15 as well as flash-bangs and body armor-R6 even has assault uniforms for a variety of terrain. After a few missions, you'll learn what equipment to take and what to leave behind. After you've chosen and outfitted your team, it's time to plan the actual operation.

THE HOST IS TOAST Take out the enemy Host Station and victory soon follows but don't expect to get the red carpet treatment, Welcome to the Wasteland Though traveling an overly familiar road, URBAN ASSAULT tries COMPUTER GAMING WORL * * ** APPEAL: Post apocalypse combat gamers looking for yet another act in the carnival of ws: 265 carnage. PROS: Nonstop action without the wait for construction; ruthless opponent AI. CONS: No choices among the dueling factions; leaming interface requires patience; nothing new here. DIFFICULTY: Advanced.

Your role in this bleak warscape is to defeat all the rival factions and make the world safe for your side (which, incidentally, is the side that ruined the Earth in the first place). Microsoft ignores both that irony and the interesting game potential inherent in a cyborgenhanced Omega Man. Instead, and true to form, Microsoft goes gaga over the technology. In the case of URBAN ASSAULT, the tech toys revolve around an interface that combines a transparent map window, a squadron editor, a HUD, and a lock-on targeting display all spreading themselves over a screen of 3D cityscapes and exurbs. Mastering all of the on-screen information is like learning to drive a stick in a '72 Beetle-fun and frustrating in turn. All the fighting units are drones, taking their commands from you in the Host Station. Using the Squadron Manager window, you can quickly arrange different units into fighting squads to maximize their effectiveness-placing a few light tanks and helicopters together, for example, to soften the enemy and roll in for the kill. Select a squad and send it into a sector for battle or control it by clicking on the map. You can't however, assign a squad to a hot-key-a glaring oversight by Microsoft of a very useful game convention. Some of the game's most interesting aspects are revealed in the middle of an intense firefight. By clicking (or using a keyboard shortcut), you can insert yourself into any friendly vehicle on the screen and carry the battle to the enemy yourself. Human control raises the firepower and shielding of the occupied vehicle, which can make all the difference during battle. The 15 different fighting vehicles aren't simulation quality; they are instead designed for action. The game doesn't care if you fly a gun ship straight into the ground, as long as an enemy doesn't put a shell through your armor. You don't get to try the game from the enemy side, either. Too badhow many chances do you get to play the part of a magma-sucking parasite? energy can be gathered by driving a vehicle through the ghostly plasma field left behind by destroyed vehicles. The game's 30-plus scenarios cover the usual array of seizing ground, discovering hidden power and technology boosts, and disarming ticking bombs. Controlling Power Stations is critical, as it gives your Host Station more energy with which to fight. Tech Centers provide improved weaponry. The enemy Al is particularly ruthless. Seizing control of a sector invites constant counterattacks. Waves of attackers will continually plague your Host Station. Along with accomplishing specific mission goals, your Host must survive. The levels aren't linear, so you have some flexibility in creating a path through the game. Action-strategy fans are always looking for new challenges, but the most difficult challenge URBAN ASSAULT offers is mastering its interface. The game boils down to a delicate balancing act—juggling information, striking opportunities, and ruthlessly destroying competing factions. Come to think of it, this game does sound awfully familiar. CGW Apocalyptic Powermonger In addition to fighting, players must control the flow of energy through the Host Station. Energy units are used to create weapons.

"REVIEW  STRATOSPHERE: CONQUEST OF THE SKIES NOT Between a Rock and a High Place STRATOSPHERE's High-flying Combat Is Unique but Lacks Depth by Mark Clarkson TRATOSPHERE is a novel new game of uncertain genre. Part real-time strategy game, part third-person shooter, STRATOSPHERE offers a unique blend of basebuilding, piloting. resource gathering, and combat. In the game, you might find yourself careening down a narrow canyon at top speed, barely ahead of a pack of Hurricane-class forts. Steering by radar, you work desperately to rebuild some weapons before you're cornered. You glance behind you just as one of the Hurricanes fires her forward Doom Cannon. Since you've got no room to dodge, a huge explosion blasts the back of your war island apart, VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH Trapped in a narrow canyon this fortress is doomed as two enemies pound on it. COMPUTER GAMING ***** WORLD A fortress doesn't necessarily need weapons to be deadly. Pack your fortress with a mass of powerful engines and a load of spikes up front, then ram or grind an enemy to dust against a mountainside without firing a shot. Whatever course you take, you'll need to use the game's different camera view to aim effectively-a low angle for the cannon, a top-down view for the high lobs. With enemy forts coming in from the front, left, right, back, or all four sides, it takes real keyboard virtuosity to keep most of the fight in view. Luckily, STRATOSPHERE helps you out with an extensive automatic targeting system. Weapons can be instructed to automatically target enemy forts that come within their firing range. Moreover, they can be set to target specific fixtures on that fort. You can choose from 12 singleplayer missions from escort duty to bombing raids, or you can embark on a 24-mission career. Only in later missions do you have the muchneeded opportunity to design a custom fortress for each mission. There are eight multiplayer missions that support up to four players, only one of whom needs to have the CD. Internet play via TCP/IP was especially \"warpy\" for me, so STRATOSPHERE might be best played on a LAN. Unfortunately, multiplayer mission selection isn't terribly diverse; most missions are various deathmatches, with a few defensive, escort, and ground-strike missions thrown in. There is no Al to allow for two-player team play. STRATOSPHERE doesn't offer deep gameplay: The strategy component of this pseudo-RTS game is largely limited to fortress design. Once you've done that, it's pretty much a shooter, albeit a shooter featuring giant, gun-laden chunks of rock. Still, this fresh real-time game is a blast. CGW PAMIT devastating your thrusters.

"REVIEW  INDEPENDENCE WAR  GAMING WORLD EDITORS Hard-core Space War CHOICE SIMULATION SPACE Real Physics and a Solid Story Push This Space Sim to Warp Speed DOC BRF OBJ CSU REM by Greg Fortune f you're piloting a high-tech starship, how come you have to make wide, banking turns to fire on a following ship? Why is a spaceship that can travel between star systems equipped with unguided missiles? And why the heck does a spaceship come to an immediate stop in a gravity-free vacuum when you kill its thrust? If these questions have nagged at you while flying previous generations of space sims, beam aboard INDEPENDENCE WAR. Developed by Particle Systems, INDEPENDENCE WAR is an updated U.S. version of the space sim released in Europe earlier this year as 1-WAR. New to the American release is support for 3Dfx Voodoo and Voodoocards, as well as an arcade mode for those gamers more comfortable with WING COMMANDER-style combat. RANGE VESS CACHE AND ATTACH MINES TO AS MANY CARGO PODS AS POSSIBLE. DRAW ME A PICTURE Your mission briefing typically includes graphical walk-throughs of your main objectives; these are available during the mission at the command console. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Degrees of Freedom The most striking aspect of INDEPENDENCE WAR is its physics modeling. While it would be absurd to call a starship flight model \"realistic,\" the ship handling here at least acknowledges the basics of Newton's laws. Piloting your ship is a blast. Once you get the hang of managing the inertia and using freethruster mode, you'll wish every space game had this physics model. Take this scenario as an example: You are being chased by an enemy who has damaged your weapons and is pounding away at your rear shield-which, of course, is by far the weakest shield on your ship. In most space sims, it's curtains for you. Here you can jump to the engineering console and direct Repair Team Four, which was busy trying to repair Power Grid Two, to get your starboard Particle Beam NORPUS APPEAL: Anyone who even remotely likes space sims.

When you pull the stick back, your ship continues its original trajectory but rotates 180 degrees to face the ship behind you. You are now flying backward at high speed, taking hits to your strongest shield. You've also kept all of your momentum, and you've got your PBC blazing away at your enemy's navigational thrusters, hampering his ability to pursue you. Finally, a space sim that truly lets you take advantage of the capabilities of a spaceship, rather than saddling you with something that flies like an F-22 mode is most similar to the standard mode of other space sims. Here the sideslip from your forward inertia is canceled when you turn, and there are several other areas in which the flight model has been dumbed down. Your weapons are more powerful, though you lose some targeting options. Simulation is the standard mode, with all options and physics turned on. can replay a mission to try for a different outcome, but you'll lose the timeline you developed the first time you played through.

Play would also be extended if SIMULATION SPACE PRESS hardware acceleration for 3Dfx Voodoo (640x480 resolution) and Voodoo2 (800x600) cards. On these cards, you'll see more dramatic special effects as well as more detailed, texture-mapped ships. If you don't have a 3Dfx card, though, you're still likely to be impressed by the software engine. The game starts with a highquality animated movie that runs nearly 15 minutes. But that's the end of the interface flash-anddazzle. While the interface you use to select missions is intuitive and functional, it's positively minimalist-it's practically antirendered. After all the shock-tothe-brain interfaces that have come out lately, it's nice to see a company put all of its effort into the game itself. Installation is extremely straightforward, and Infogrames has also included plenty of documentation with INDEPENDENCE WAR.

The Command and Control The ship's bridge has four command stations, each of which is critical to your success at various points in a mission. The command station gives you the ability to view the rotating 3D star chart, initiate remote control over other ships, and review your mission briefing and objectives. The pilot's station supplies most of the information about waypoints and distances. The weapons station provides both fixed and padlock views and allows you to select your firing and targeting modes. The padlock view gives you access to both forwardand rear-facing weapons, enabling you to fire on multiple targets from almost any angle. Finally, the engineering station lets you prioritize the repair of critical systems as they become damaged in combat. To play INDEPENDENCE WAR, you'll want to have either a set of rudder pedals or a joystick with a Z-axis twist, because the game gives you full control of the ship's pitch, yaw, and roll axes. A good programmable throttle will also add to your enjoyment, but the game is entirely playable via keyboard and joystick Infinity War because that's how long the battle will go on if you manage to keep from getting blown into tiny pieces. As you'd expect, you'll face wave after wave of enemy ships, but as an original touch, friendly units periodically appear to lend their efforts as wingmen. Supply ships also happen along, enabling you to restock your missile and ECM stores. The campaign is extremely well done. There are numerous mission types, including spy missions, surgical strikes, fleet warfare, and pitched one-on-one battles. Often your mission orders change midstream and you are taken in unexpected directions. You'll be asked to make choices that dictate the direction of the future missions.

Like a unicorn and almost as rare, it's been sought for years by hunters and treasure-seekers, who more often return with a wild \"There I was\" tale than with con crete evidence of its existence. The creature in question is, of course, the dynamic campaign, a mode of play for a flight sim (or any game, for that matter) that generates each of the opponent's moves on the fly throughout the entire war. Whereas the more common scripted-mission system provides a set of canned missions that play out nearly the same way every time, dynamic campaigns promise that each mission will be different based on the circumstances of the previous missions. The sim equivalent of the unicorn, the dynamic campaign offers not a magic horn but the pledge of unlimited replayability. DID is one of the few companies truly pursuing the dream of the dynamic campaign, and its latest offering-F22 TOTAL AIR WAR—fully embraces the conc ept with a quite admirable effort. Depending on whom you talk to, F22 TOTAL AIR WAR is an add-on pack for DID's F22 AIR DOMINANCE FIGHTER, a complete sequel to F22 ADF, or a totally new product. For all practical purposes, it is an enhanced version of F22 ADF, implementing a dynamic campaign engine with 10 new scenarios.

When you decide to fly a combat sortie, you can accept the default flight plan and weapons loadout, or you can use the mission editor to configure items according to your tastes and tactics. DID's original WarGen campaign engine battled merrily along its way with little regard to the players' personal success rate. This drew complaints from gamers, and DID promptly altered its course.

During the Cold War, the USAF claimed that just three AWACS could monitor the entire East/West border across all of Europe.

"REVIEW. IF/A-18E CARRIER STRIKE FIGHTER Half-Baked Hornet SIMULATIONISPACE Bugs Shoot Down This Potentially Interesting F/A-18 Sim by Robin G. Kim fter enduring stinging criticisms of their debut release, IF-22, the inhouse developers at Interactive Magic felt they needed to follow up with a real winner. Their formula called for rectifying that sim's deficiencies while porting its strengths to a new title based on the U.S. Navy's hot new Super Hornet. If all went well, IF/A-18E CARRIER STRIKE FIGHTER (CSF) was to be Interactive Magic's redemption in the eyes of flight-sim fans. Alas, the best-laid plans of developers and testers often go astray: The sim has shipped with a boatload of bugs. This is not to say that CSF is completely without merit. It actually displays potential in several key Graphically, CSF is similar to IF22, yet with several welcome improvements. Gone are the annoying pauses for loading terrain that plagued the older sim. Smoke trails are also improved. And while the haze-shrouded, satellite image-based terrain still looks good only from higher up, the sim boasts impressive framerates (with or without a 3D card) at resolutions from 640x480 to 1024x768. View options include a set of fixed views, 45 degrees apart, and basic manual-panning and autotracking padlock views The game's graphics cannot be called pretty, but they are functional despite some minor glitches. Complementing the visuals is a suite of realistic sound effects, including \"Bitching Betty\" warning messages that were recorded from an actual F/A-18. 16 0323 REAL LANDSCAPES The satellite images projected onto the terrain look good only from high altitude, and they cannot be seen from very far away. areas, most notable of which is its dynamic campaign engine. COMPUTER GAMING begins again. That is, if the program doesn't crash partway through, as occasionally occurs, forcing you to restart. Apart from the campaigns, there are some simple training flights, a quick-mission creator, randomly generated single missions, an instant-action mode, and multiplayer deathmatches. Support for cooperative single missions may be added in a patch; in the meantime, multiplayer fans can try WARBIRDS, which is included on the same CD. WORLD Enough Rope to Hang Yourself CSF definitely holds its own in the flight-model department. The sim combines realistic performance with an exceptionally fluid feel. Its main drawback is a high joystick gain that puts a premium on APPEAL: Serious F/A-18E .. sim fans willing to BARBIER STRIRE FIGHTER wade through inevitable patches to play a good campaign. PROS: Dynamic campaign; realistic flight model; detailed avionics: great frame-rate even without a 3D card. CONS: Frequent program crashes, too many minor bugs to list here; touchy joystick response; very poor missile modeling: limited multiplayer support. DIFFICULTY: Hard. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166, Windows 95,24MB RAM, 133MB harddrive space, 8x CD-ROM. 3D SUPPORT: Direct3D.

Price: $44.95 Publisher: Interactive Magic Research Triangle Park, NC (919) 461-0722 www.imagicgames.com Pick Your Poison The game's two campaign scenarios pit U.S. forces against an invading aggressor: in one, the Turks in the Aegean theater, in the other, the combined armies of Iran and Iraq in the Persian Gulf. Your initial goal in each is to help pave the way for a Marine amphibious invasion. Once the troops are ashore, the war continues until one side has gained control of a preponderance of victory locations. Before each flight, CSF generates a set of missions (from among 15 different types) for the Super Hornets in your squadron, based on whether the invasion has taken place and what assets remain on each side. Reinforcements are also calculated, though a bug prevents your squadron from ever receiving the replacement aircraft it is due. After selecting the flight you wish to lead, you may use the mission planner to edit the default waypoints and each plane's loadout and fuel level (advisable, since fuel is sometimes set dangerously low). Once the mission is completed, losses are tallied up and the cycle WINGMEN Using a basic set of commands you can individually direct the one to three wingmen that accompany you on each mission.

Hornets are known for their pitch authority, and that comes through here: Manhandle the controls and you'll find yourself in an accelerated stall or nasty spin nearly every time. Those who have difficulty staying that far ahead of their aircraft can opt for a relaxed flight model, but it's simplistic; no middle ground is provided. Systems modeling is rather complex, with multiple radar and HUD modes, a FLIR (forward-looking infrared) sensor, TV-guided munitions, and several autopilot modes You can even get target information data-linked to your scope from the carrier's E-3 Hawkeye if it's flying. But if you ask it for bogey information over the radio, it will always give a bearing of 042 in its response another bug. Other problem areas include some target designation methods that do not work as advertised and some short-lived blips in the ground-mapping radar mode that make selecting a contact resemble a game of \"Whack-a-Mole.\" Fortunately, cheat keys that allow you to cycle through all nearby targets provide a usable work-around to this glitch. Guided Miss-iles Your Hornet can carry many types of ordnance, from JSOWS Carrier Operations anding a multimillion-dollar jet fighter aboard a moving aircraft carrier is one of the most rigorous tests of flying skill that a pilot-real or simulated can face. This sweaty-palmed challenge is perhaps the defining characteristic of a contemporary naval fighter sim, so it is important to legions of sim fans that it be done well. CSF gets it half right. Radio communication with the carrier lets you clear your approach, and the Landing Signal Officer who talks you down to the 1000-foot-long deck is reasonably helpful. Unfortunately, apart from the ILS needles, most of the other aids do not work. The carrier's \"meatball\" (glideslope indicator light) is illegible even at 1024x768 resolution, and the flight-path marker on the HUD exaggerates your angle of descent. Though flight performance and throttle response in a landing configuration seem realistic, unusually high joystick sensitivity makes it difficult to execute fine pitch corrections. The ACLS (Automatic Carrier Landing System) is not much help since it is highly unreliable. Given these difficulties, it's probably for the best that the sim lets you get away with hard touchdowns. Note, however, that due to a bug in the \"realistic flight-model option, your aircraft will self-destruct a few seconds after you catch a wire unless you exit the mission immediately. Besides the landings, other aspects of carrier operations are glossed over. Catapult launches are modeled, but no taxiing is involved, and the jet blast deflectors mentioned in the manual are not even visible in the actual game. 366 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

THE DARK SIDE Though they are normally your adversaries, the Soviet-made MiG-29 Fulcrum and MiG-23 Flogger are flyable in custom missions and certain multiplayer modes. COMPUTER GAMING **** WORLD The game features six campaigns, each consisting of seven prescripted missions. The battles variously pit you against the Soviet-equipped forces of Syria, Egypt, Jordan, or Iraq (or, as in the Six-Day War, all four at once!). For the three historical campaigns, missions may be flown in any order. In the three hypothetical campaigns, set in late 1999, you must win each mission to advance to the next. a bomber flight. As you can imagine, hopping from plane to plane can become hectic. Fortunately, the Al is capable enough that you don't have to do everything your self. Your guidance is needed primarily for tactical decisions and complicated ground-attack procedures. You can tweak the sim's difficulty, but note that the enemy Al setting has a bug: \"Expert\" is actually the easiest mode, with \"Rookie\" and \"Normal\" both offering a much greater challenge. Mission briefings are thorough, detailing exactly what each of your flights is supposed to do. Both waypoints and weapon loads can be customized for all aircraft under your control. During play, you can access the map (the same one used for preflight planning) to monitor the tactical situation in realtime or to switch control between flights. Missions start you out either in the air or on the runway and can be ended as soon as you achieve the last objective. But you can also fly back to base and taxi into a hangar, then watch your wingman and surviving friendlies do the same-a nice touch. 2.330s RACTICAL CARE Sam Assault DG:00:00 BEIRUT APPEAL: Sim players more interArred ested in an active, convincing environment than in highly detailed systems simulation.

"REVIEW  IAF sensitive (the opposite occurs in real life), making landings and takeoffs unsatisfying. SIMULATION SPACE In addition to the campaigns, the game provides 11 excellent interactive training flights, a simple mission builder, and 7 scramble missions. The latter are canned missions that put you in the cock pit with no briefing; your objectives are radioed to you on the fly. contours has never been so easy in a sim-an important consideration when you're hugging valley floors to avoid enemy radar. Frame rate at 640x480 (the only supported resolution) with a good 3D card will be acceptable for most PCs, albeit with substantially coarser graphics on slower CPUs. Running the sim without 3D acceleration should yield adequate performance with detail settings minimized. But on my PC it also resulted in frequent long pauses (probably due to a compatibility problem), which rendered the game unplayable until reactivated my 3D card. PADLOCKED IAF's padlock view takes some getting used to. The arrow shows the direction and angle from your HUD to the target. Eye of the Beholder The terrain graphics are perhaps the most controversial aspect of IAF. They resemble grainy videotape footage of actual landscapes, but with a shimmering effect (not apparent in the screenshots) that you will likely find either annoying Sim Synergy IAF is clearly not the most accurate flight sim around; it tends toward \"good enough for most\" realism and manageable complexity. Its true strengths, which draw you back mission after mission, arise from its blend of engrossing mission designs, novel plane selections, and originality of concept-a remarkable combination. CGW RHINO'S CHARGE At last, F-4 Phantom II fans get a chance to fly a reasonably detailed simulation of this landmark fighter. IAF's cockpit view system includes nine fixed views and a manual panning mode, but large gaps in coverage and slow panning speeds will force you to rely on the sim's autotracking padlock view in combat. This versatile view can lock onto air and ground targets, your wingman, incoming missiles, other nearby threats, or the centered object in any of the other views. key commands, and symbology is used for all the planes, with each type having its own specific combination of capabilities. Older planes have basic radar sets and weapon selections, for instance, while the newest are equipped with farseeing radars, a track-while-scan mode, and helmet-mounted sights, and have the ability to carry more advanced weaponry. The result may not be detailed enough to satisfy hard-core realism fanatics, but it is impressively close from a functional perspective-especially considering how many aircraft are modeledwhile striking a balance between complexity and playability. The sim offers a good variety of ordnance types, including laserguided bombs (with forwardlooking infrared pods to designate targets), TV-guided bombs and missiles, Sidewinders (both older rear-aspect and contemporary allaspect versions), semiactive radarhoming Sparrows, AMRAAMs, and Israel's Python 4 (arguably the deadliest dogfight missile in the world). The weapons modeling is good, but the lack of ballistic drop for cannon shells makes gun kills easier than they should be. The flight model in IAF is somewhat simplified. Low-speed maneuverability of aircraft has been exaggerated for playability, but performance is otherwise fairly accurate and varies greatly between aircraft types. Though some realistic effects, such as accelerated (high-speed) stalls and rudder-induced roll, have been omitted, spins are still possible if you get careless. Control feel is normally nicely fluid; however, at low speeds it becomes extremely Maximum Multiplayer n addition to the usual deathmatches, IAF lets you play all six of its standalone campaigns in cooperative multiplayer mode. There are also six multiplayer-only single missions included, and you can generate custom team-based missions using the game's mission creator. Up to six players can join in on a LAN or over the Internet; unfortunately, modem and direct connect links are not supported. Internet gamers can meet up for multiplayer sessions at Jane's combat.net Web site; point your browser to www.janescombat.net. Multiple chat options are available for choosing the recipients of your text messages. If you're too busy to type, you can send canned messages via function keys. For more realistic matchups in deathmatches and custom multiplayer missions, the sim expands the list of flyable aircraft types to include the MiG23 Flogger and MiG-29 Fulcrum. Each craft is fully supported, with its own cockpit graphics, flight model, and Soviet-made armament. Since the two Migs are also available in single-player custom missions, Egyptian/Syrian/ Jordanian/Iraqi players can practice flying them offline. IN THE COCKPIT Each aircraft type sports its own instrument panel layout. Despite the detailed look, only a handful of the gauges, switches, and but tons are actually functional. or inconsequential. Beyond the looks, the graphics engine does an exceptional job of portraying the region's landmarks and complex topology without a hint of blockiness, rendering it all out to an impressive distance at the maximum detail level. Best of all, reading the terrain is completely intuitive. Low-level flying over such fine Technological Progression Over the 32-year-period covered by IAF, you will progress from the French-made Mirage III, through the venerable F-4E Phantom II, to more modern aircraft such as the F. 15 Eagle, the F-16D Fighting Falcon (two-seat variant), the F-4 2000 (an upgraded Phantom), and Israel's own Kfir fighter-bomber and Lavi advanced technology demonstrator.

"FIGHTER ACE 1.5  REVIEW Flies Great, Less Thrilling Despite Numerous Improvements, FIGHTER ACE Remains a Light Experience SIMULATONIS PAGE by John Nolan he first version of Microsoft's FIGHTER ACE, a WWII multiplayer air-combat game, gave the impression that it was rushed out to provide content on the company's Internet Gaming Zone. The basic flight model was decent, and the graphics were quite good. However, the gameplay had distinct problems with airfields too close together, no play features except dogfighting, and a view system that was poorly designed. The price was also high at $20 a month. To improve the situation, the Zone recently launched FIGHTER ACE 1.5. airfield per country, arranged in a small square layout. Fields were so close together that you could not return to your base before your last victim was back hosing your six. The easy fix was to move fields farther apart; now each country has four fighter strips, with about three times as much space separating them from enemy fields. The mostly flat terrain has been modified with some rolling hills, making the low-level dogfights more challenging. This is definitely progress, although gameplay remains a fairly fastpaced, continuous furball; spreading the fields out even further wouldn't hurt. Some arenas still LITTLE FRIEND An FW-190 escorts computer-controlled bombers.

Unfortunately these batteries regenerate in about a minute so it's rarely worth the risk. The important thing is that these features now exist, a necessary first step in expanding the gameplay options, WORLD PINCUSHION EFFECT Get close to any enemy B-17 formation and you'll find out why they're called \"Fortresses.\" The gun ners will blast you to shreds in seconds. FIGHTER ACE APPEAL: Online pilots favoring fast, easy action in a simple setting. PROS: Low price; unlimited play, simple interface; fast-paced action. CONS: Limited gameplay options, small plane set, clumsy view system; no 3D hardware support. DIFFICULTY: Easy. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 75; Windows 95:16MB RAM; 9.5MB hard-drive space; VGA graphics, DirectX 5.0; 28.8Kbps Internet access; Internet Explorer 3.02 or better, AOL 3.0 or higher, or Netscape 4.x mouse or compatible pointing device. 3D SUPPORT: None.

Price: $10/month or $1.95/day Publisher: Microsoft Redmond, WA (800) 426-9400 use the old, small map, however, so someone must have liked it. Dogfighting against human opponents is the main attraction of this genre. Still, a little variety never hurts, especially if there are few people online and potential victims are scarce. The new version adds \"combat boxes\" of computer/host-flown bombers cruising around and bombing airfields. Players can attack these flights, but the bombers never close on a field completely, so they're no real threat. Their gunners are devastatingly accurate, and few attackers live through the encounter. key while pressing a number will generate a 45-degree up view in that direction. It's not as simple or as complete as the classic, onehanded AIR WARRIOR system, but it's a start. With a programmable joystick, though, you can finally achieve an easily used, if barely adequate, view set. This release still lacks most of the common gameplay features of WARBIRDS or AIR WARRIOR. The small 16-plane inventory is made up purely of fighters, with no ability to carry bombs and knock out the ack-ack from a safe altitude. There's no way for a country to capture fields or win, and despite the bombers and tank parks, dogfighting is still the only game in town. While the realistic physics flight model is actually well done, with particularly good G-effects, the arenas that use it are almost always empty. The overly simplistic arcade flight model gets most of the play. The best part of the revision is the price cut. FIGHTER ACE now costs just $10/month for unlimited play. This is the same price as the more fully featured AIR WARRIOR, but at least it provides affordable fun for more casual pilots. CGW Seeing More Clearly FIGHTER ACE's original clumsy and complex viewing has been improved somewhat. The old views remain-a veritable key board ballet of disorientation. It's hard to understand views that don't include any parts of the aircraft-like a side view without a visible wing. How do you judge relative position?

"REVIEW  ARES RISING Privateer Too SIMULATION SPACE The Original PRIVATEER Team Is Back With a Spiritual Sequel by Thierry Nguyen he words final frontier bring to mind a vast area to be explored, full of hardships, surprises, and rewards. Origin's PRIVATEER was perhaps the last space sim to give you the feeling of exploring space, rather than just defend ing it. A number of members of the PRIVATEER team have been holed up at Imagine Studios, working to create a spiritual successor to that classic title. ARES RISING, their first effort, proves to be a game with high ambitions, marred by a few problems and an engine that has fallen behind the times. from the law (a Han Solo type, essentially). You're contacted by a woman who promises you steady work and a cozy little base hidden on an asteroid field in the middle of nowhere and that's where it all starts. After going through the standard easy training missions, you drop into the main plot line (written by Gilbert Austin of STRIKE COMMANDER and PRIVATEER fame) which concerns the discovery of a mighty alien device known as the Micomicon. A power struggle develops among the IPEC, the Scavage, the Mayjr, and various other factions, and you're there to support the IPEC...at first, at least. The single-player campaign is of the branching variety: You'll create different alliances with the many factions depending on what decisions you make when accepting missions, how you treat other craft in space, and what success you achieve. This adds a nice bit of replayability, because the differing alliances lead you to one of five game endings. Gewebiony, wym 106 The Name's Marlowe You play Mike Marlowe, a hotshot rogue who scored with the princess and is now on the run Managing Merc Money You'll spend about as much time at home base as you will flying missions. ARES RISING is loaded with information. Between missions, you get a steady stream of AP-style news clippings about the happenings within the gameworld. While you don't have to sit down and read these, taking the time to do so greatly enhances the atmosphere. In addition, you have your own email inbox, and when you finish a plot mission you always have a personal log where Marlowe muses about his progress. The background is nice, but if ARES RISING has a claim to fame, it's the gigantic list of equipment, and the play-balancing that went into that equipment. No other space sim in recent memory has such a diverse arsenal. Cannons fall into three categories, with beam weapons being best used against shields, ballistic weapons specializing in armor, and particle weapons suitable for taking out both. Missiles come in varying flavors of locking (from antiradar to rearaspect heat-seeking), supply (singlefire or multiple pods), and even armament (EMP warhead or minelaying). You can even lay mines or automatic turrets that will guard a certain stretch of space. In addition, you'll find cloaks that mask you from anything and everything (at a high cost in energy and cargo space), jamming mechanisms that block out all communications, ECM systems of varying quality, and flight-control systems that affect how well your ship interprets your joystick input. There's also passive and active radar (the passive has a longer range and fewer emissions, but doesn't give as much information). COMPUTER GAMING **** WORLD TACTFUL DIPLOMACY As in PRIVATEER, you can hurl insults or compliments to anyone you run across. APPEAL: Fans of PRIVATEER, aspiring space mercenaries PROS: Free-form, branching single player campaign: large equipment variety, competent enemy AI. CONS: Woefully outdated graphics: forced pacing in single player campaign feel of freedom isn't quite there. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 133, Windows 95, 16MB RAM, 150MB harddrive space, 2x CD-ROM, DirectX5compatible sound and video cards. 3D SUPPORT: Direct3D.

"ARES RISING REVIEW Destroy Levi were free to put the plot on hold, doing whatever you wanted until you decided to initiate a plot mission. But in this email system, found that a plot mission was the only choice left after I had finished two or three random missions. This is just a bit too much structure in what would've been a fine, freeform game. One additional gripe is that you're shown how much room the equipment you're buying will take up, but until you buy a ship, you don't know how much it can carry. If I'd known the ship's specs before hand, I wouldn't have made the mistake so often of buying nice equipment only to find out that my new ship didn't have enough cargo space. SIMULATION SPACE Guild missions in PRIVATEER, there's no trading here. You simply punch up your email to see what missions are available, choose one, outfit your ship, and then launch away. The mission types include patrol surveys, contract hits, escorts, and plot missions. The standard missions have a sameness to them: You'll circle around some waypoints and shoot down whomever you're assigned to shoot down. Each mission ends when you find the right jump-gate and use it to return to your asteroid base. Then again, that was the way it was for most of the missions in PRIVATEER. The flight model can be toggled between the traditional, arcadelike mode found in the WING COMMANDER and STAR WARS sims, and the slightly more realistic inertial mode. Depending on how big your ship is, the inertial mode makes it harder for you to slow down and turn. It falls somewhere between WING COMMANDER and INDEPENDENCE WAR in complexity. There are six flyable ships, divided among fighters, scouts, and bombers. They differ in terms of carrying capacity and general maneuverability. During the course of the game, you can hire wingmen to help out during your missions. While their quality doesn't approach the elegance of the FREESPACE wingmen, these pilots are good enough for the job (if you hire the right ones). One nice touch: You can dictate PUFF OF SMOKE The dated graphics make for unspectacular explosions, even with 3D acceleration. BOOTY CALL One indicator of a well-done mission is when you score salvage off of the ships you defeated. general flying style to your wingmen (passive or active, beams first, and so on), and they are intelligent enough to use different weapons at appropriate times The enemy Al is also generally competent. At times they will use good tactics, such as using passive radar at the right time or using the asteroids for cover. At other times, though, they simply can't shake you off, no matter what craft each of you is piloting. Alone Out There In multiplayer mode you'll have a persistent RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB Despite lackluster graphics, the play balance and pilot who has to gain variety of weapons (such as this beam money and goods to weapon cutting through shields) are build his ship.

"REVIEW SPEARHEAD Blunt Instrument STIMULATILONIZSPACE Interactive Magic Forgets Who Its Audience Is 555N DO GUNNER by Jim Cobb n an attempt to answer criticisms leveled at the playability and limited graphics of iM1A2 ABRAMS, Interactive Magic has made its latest tank affair, SPEARHEAD, quite glitzy and has narrowed the game's focus to a smaller command scale. What could have been a decent light arcade game, however, suffers from being forced into a simulation format. THOSE ARE SOME SHOCKS The ride of an Abrams in SPEARHEAD is closer to that of a Lincoln Town Car than an AFV. World Policeman The premise of SPEARHEAD is that the United States intervenes as Libya invades Tunisia. Engagements come in three flavors: seven tutorials (which are actually pretty good), 10 single engagements, and any number of randomly generated, yet nondynamic, campaigns. Most mission objectives include COMPUTER vehicle orders (map zoom, communication, and the like) by first clicking on the order, then clicking on the vehicle, clicking on the target, and—finally-exiting. So, to give a set of orders to a single vehicle (or artillery or infantry unit) requires seven (or more) clicks! This would be bad enough in a turn-based game, but in a realtime simulation it's unforgivable. While you can drive toward a target via the IVIS, you aren't going to find good hull-down positions. In general, operating your tank is a confusing blur of joystick, keys, and keypad arrows: A real action game, much less a sim, should have better controls than this. The confusion extends to the manual, which spends too much time dealing with multiplayer issues for which the scenarios provided are ill suited. Forget the mission editor; there are far better products available. SPEARHEAD does have a few good points, such as refugees and conveniently marked minefields, but these hardly compensate for the clumsy interface, strange vehicle controls, or simplistic victory conditions. It's hard to imagine either serious tanksim enthusiasts or fans of arcade armor games finding much to enjoy here. CGW destroying all enemies, reaching a waypoint, and escorting supply convoys. Fair enough, except that you can win by achieving victory objectives regardless of your losses. Obviously, the U.S. forces in SPEARHEAD don't have to worry about public backlash due to high losses, as was the case in Desert Storm. You command a platoon of three tanks plus assets, and though infantry is included in the force mix, it is generally scarce when you need it most. Worse, it has unknown antitank capabilities. Artillery, on the other hand, seems to always show up for battle, and it's always maddeningly accurate. GAMING ** Aside from eye-candy considerations, the M1A2's characteristics have been stripped. SPEARHEAD provides only for HEAT and SABOT rounds, even giving them antiair capability. When you drive your tank, you never need worry about smoke, and the ride is way too smooth. Gunnery is simple: Point laze, and fire, with no indirect options. Although vehicle components can be damaged, the usual result is the enemy's destruction. Unlike in most sims, crew members don't notify the commander of damage; he must notice something wrong and view another screen. WORLD APPEAL: Neither tank enthusiasts SPEARHEAD nor arcade fans will like it. PROS: Nice enough graphics; sexier than iM1A2 ABRAMS CONS: Unrealistic simplistic victory conditions; clumsy interface. DIFFICULTY: Easy SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: P-133, Windows 95, 16MB RAM, 9.5MB harddrive space, 4MB graphics card, 2x CDROM: supports DirectX-compatible sound cards and MS force-feedback joysticks. 3D SUPPORT: D3D, 3Dfx, and Power VR. MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: TCP/IP LAN (2-12 players), Internet (2-8 players). modem; all 1 player per CD.

Given the number of tank games set in the desert, it's hard to get that excited about looking at sand again. However, this Tunisian landscape has a nice haze in the distance, and the dunes are easy to use for hull-down positions. The nine U.S. vehicles and five U.S. aircraft are modeled well enough externally, although the 10 enemy entities and three civilian vehicles appear to be stylized. There are no interior views so the driver and gunner screens give you the feel of sitting on the outside of the tank. IVIS Eyes The fatal flaw of this game is the interface for the Inter-Vehicular Information System (IVIS), which affords you a bird's-eye view of the field and lets you issue orders to vehicles and assets. A hot-key accesses a textured contour map, which in turn leads to three other menus. You execute the six DEADEYE DICK The human tank commander has near-complete intelligence and superior arms.

"REVIEW. WARBIRDS 2.01 Furballs in 3D Major SIMULATION SPACE The Classic Internet Sim Gets a 3D Makeover makes WARBIRDS the flight leader in online air combat. by John Nolan very day, hundreds of WARBIRDS gamers enlist in the service of one of four generic countries and cruise the Internet skies looking for trouble. Using 50 different WWII aircraft, they dogfight, attack ground targets, and try to capture airfields to \"win the war\" for their chosen flag. The absolute best aspect of WARBIRDS is that its designers are never satisfied. Since the debut of the sim back in December 1995, new versions have appeared every few months. The latest major upgrade, version 2.01, delivers beautifully rendered 3D aircraft and terrain, all new 2D cockpit art, revised flight models, and new airframe stress limits. Overall, it's a tour de force that FLASHBLIND 3D flames from gun barrels seem a bit overdone in daylight. Planes with cowl-mounted guns put out gun flashes that actually obscure your view of the target. Nice Wings, Baby The centerpiece of this revision is the 3D art. Artwork gets delivered in standard (640x480) or high resolution (1024x768), although the high-res 3D requires a fast Pentium Il-class CPU to deliver a playable frame-rate. (The published minimum CPU requirements are unrealistically low for smooth play.) Either way, aircraft graphics are historically accurate, stunning, and incredibly detailed. You'll see representative squadron markings on the planes, exhaust smudges from the engines, and excellent lightsourcing. The ground looks realistic, and the sky presentation is just as good; superb special effects, such as flak bursts, complete the package. If you don't have a fast Direct3D accelerator card, you'll still find the game eminently playable in 2D mode. All gameplay capabilities are the same and the 2D artwork is outstanding. In fact, the cockpit interiors and gauges are drawn in exceptionally detailed 2D in both resolution settings. The cockpits include bit-mapped gauges modeled on actual instruments, with new working g-meters, engine oil pressureand temperature gauges, and other instruments added to the display. As cutting edge as the 2D cockpits are, you'll get an even more amazing visual experience if you have a 3D accelerator card. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD **** maneuvers. The stall and spin characteristics of each aircraft are a major part of these differences and receive particular attention in the upgrade. While most of the planes still seem reluctant to enter a full spin, the effects and recovery techniques are more realistic once the plane is actually in the spin. Stress limits are now part of the flight model computations: Dive too quickly and you can pull a wing off. Overspeeding gear or flaps will stick them in position and degrade your flight performance. The detailed damage model also affects aircraft performance: If your right aileron gets shot away, your plane's APPEAL: Those who want to fight human opponents War Birds in realistic WWII aircraft. PROS: Excellent graphics; great flight model; superb damage/stress modeling: free head-to-head play. CONS: Extremely expensive arena play, 3D requires fast CPU and 3D accelerator. DIFFICULTY: Intermediate. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 90 (P-133 for D3D version), 16MB RAM (32MB for D3D version), DirectX5-compatible sound and video cards, Internet connection. 3D SUPPORT: Direct 3D. MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT: Modem, LAN (2 players), TCP/IP (2 players), Intemet arena (2-150+ players): 1 CD per player. Price: Free Internet download: $30 per 20 hours of play Publisher: Interactive Magic Research Triangle Park, NC (919) 461-0722 www.imagicgames.com roll performance deteriorates accordingly. Many other sims don't model battle damage this specifically. WARBIRDS shines in this area with a sophisticated damage map that tracks where each bullet hits and even alters the plane's appearance in the 3D mode. The designers aren't resting yet, either. Plans for the next revision include an improved game interface, changes to field-capture requirements, a new scoring/ awards system, and paratroopers. The downside to all of this is that WARBIRDS 2.01 is priced considerably higher than its two competitors. Its outdated pricing model of $30 for 20 hours of play and $2 per additional hour seems particularly outrageous when you compare it to the flat rate of $10 per month for unlimited play on AIR WARRIOR or FIGHTER ACE. However, you can fly head-tohead against a friend for free, and there are now some offline training missions. Despite its sky-high pricing scheme, this WWII sim boasts an incredibly loyal clientele. It's the best online flight sim out there, but excellence here, as in the rest of life, comes at a higher price. CGW Combat Stressed The improved flight model more accurately reflects the handling differences between the various aircraft, which adds real depth to the 50 different planes included in the simulation. You may master the Spitfire, but strapping on a Focke Wulf will call for a much different approach to air combat MIXING METAL Collisions with enemy planes or fragments of former enemy planes-prove instantly fatal, so don't get too close. 382 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Regardless, by the time mid-August rolled around, I was salivating over thoughts of the upcoming NFL season. This left me in kind of a tough way for a few weeks.

"REVIEW. MOTOCROSS MADNESS GAMING SPORTES Mud in Your Eye! EDITORS CHOICE Finally, a Realistic Motocross Game by Greg Fortune here are computer simulations of most sports that try to capture the essence and excitement of what makes the sport great. Some sports, such as football and baseball, have enjoyed several years of serious, outstanding, realistic computer games. Things have not been so good for everyone, however. Those of us who ride motocross bikes have had nothing but lame attempts to put homogenous bumps in a track that force your bike into the air. Let me tell you, that's not what it's all about. So who would have figured that Microsoft would take all the mud that's been flung at them and use it to make MOTOCROSS MADNESS, the finest off-road motorcycle game ever created? even stands on the pegs appropriately. The physics of the bike and rider are very well done. One of the most popular ways to turn a bike around if you are stopped on a trail pointing the wrong direction is to lean the bike over and \"roost\" the back tire around behind you. I was happy to find that this move also works here. You can also pull wheelies, twist the bike in the air, and fly over the bars with amazing realism. THE WEATHER UP HERE Any higher and we would have had to schedule this jump with the FAA. COMPUTER GAMING ***** WORLD APPEAL: Anyone MOTOCROSS who's fantasized about riding one of these babies. PROS: Excellent physics model; wide variety of play modes; outstanding 3D graphics; butt-simple track editor. CONS: Poor documentation. DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Intermediate SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 166 with 2MB 3D card or Pentium 133 with 4MB 3D card, Windows 95/98, 8x CD-ROM, Windows 95/98, 16MB RAM, 30MB hard drive space. 3D SUPPORT: D3D, 3Dfx.

Redmond, WA (425) 882-8080 Biker Tricks The game's interface is very easy to navigate, and the options are very straightforward. You have your choice of four different types of tracks: Stunt Quarry, Baja, Supercross, and Nationals. Each type has several riding areas, so there's a lot of replay value. The garage screen is also quite simple and lets you modify everything from your motor to springs, shocks, and traction. One thing you need to know is that if you don't have a 3D accelerator, you can't play MOTOCROSS MADNESS. Just as in the real sport, you have to have the proper equipment to get out on the trails. If you do have a 3D card, you are in for a treat. The graphics are fast, smooth, and detailed. The game looks equally gorgeous in D3D or 3Dfx mode, so either way you win. The bikes are wonderfully detailed and model everything from the teeth on the rear sprocket to the puff of grey-blue smoke out of your pipe when you first open the throttle. The distinctive growl of the twostroke engine even sounds right.

"REVIEW TIGER WOODS 99 SPORT Tiger in the Rough Tiger's PC Round Livens Up the PGA TOUR Franchise—but It's No LINKS KITTY LITTER Tiger slaps his ball out of the bunker and onto the green. The gallery grows the better you play. this venerable series on its ear by Scott May with TIGER WOODS 99. A deft or years, EA Sports blend of golf sim and arcade underrated PGA TOUR flash, this game has muscle and GOLF has quietly held its attitude to spare. ground in the shadow of It doesn't take a marketing heavy hitters like LINKS genius to understand EA's euphoLS and JACK NICKLAUS ria in bagging Tiger Woods' first GOLF. Now EA takes a gaming endorsement. The hotTiger by the tail and turns shot young star of the PGA circuit is perhaps the best role model COMPUTER this particular sport has ever seen. So it's not surprising that a WORLD game cast in his image is fast, lively, and even inspirational including a utility that importsand converts to 3D-any courses from the following titles: PGA TOUR 96 FOR WINDOWS, PGA TOUR PRO, PGA TOUR GOLD, CLASSIC COURSES CD, SPANISH BAY course disc, and PGA TOUR LAPTOP. You can even export TIGER WOODS 99 and its add-on courses to the above-mentioned games (with the exception of PGA TOUR 96 FOR WINDOWS). Nine game modes give players plenty of variety. The modes include practice, stroke, tournament, skins, shoot-out, match play. foursomes, fourball, and driving range. Players can hit the greens competing as (or against) Tiger or one of seven other PGA champs: Mark O'Meara, Lee Janzen, Peter Jacobsen, Tom Kite, Craig Sadler, Brad Faxton, and Davis Love III. Sorry, ladies, you're stuck with a lone generic female golfer named Cindy. You can also create a custom player profile that mirrors your own real-life attributes--if that's your idea of fun. The game's graphics engine has been totally revamped from the last PGA TOUR outing, and it now supports both hardware and software-accelerated 3D video. By far the biggest improvement is EA's proprietary Flash Draw technology, which renders each shot on the fly—and I mean that literally. The game camera follows the ball in flight, then swings immediately around for the next shot. No waiting. The result is a more immersive style of play than PC golfers have ever played. In 2D mode, the high-res graphics are quite good; in 3D m ode they're even better. My only complaint is with the blotchy background objects. Close up, they just don't \"fit\" with the realistically rendered foregrounds and stunning sky effects. Worst of all are the dorks in the gallery, who increase in number the better you play. TIGER WOODS 99 handles animations quite well, using digitally captured versions of Tiger and his ***** APPEAL: Any digital duffer.

"TIGER WOODS 99. REVIEW SPORTS contemporaries. We even get some signature Tiger emotions, such as his fist pump and \"raise the roof\" antics that follow good shots. He even releases his right hand on the follow-through after a particularly bad shot. One disconcerting note about graphics: The initial release of TIGER WOODS, designed for DirectX5.2, appears to have a problem with DirectX6. On my rig, a Pentium 233 MMX with an ATI Xpert 98 primary display and Diamond Monster 3D II secondary display, the game ran great using 3D acceleration until I installed DirectX6. After that, the course screens were horribly garbled. The only workable solution, beyond dumping DirectX6, was to turn off hardware acceleration within the game's options menu, but even this produced some video corruption, presumably associated with D3D 6.0 software rendering. At the time of this writing, EA's tech support had not yet addressed this issue. ball, risk meter, ball lie, and adjustments for fade, draw, and backspin. Two types of club swings are available: old-fashioned twitch-and-click and analog Pro Swing, EA's attempt to create a natural, mouse-motion swing. I think most players will opt for Pro Swing, because it offers greater control and better accuracy, particularly on chip shots and putting. One cool feature is the Tiger Zone—the nickname given to the swing meter's overpower area. Traditionally, any backswing allowed to extend past the overpower mark resulted in a wild, unpredictable shot. Here, expert use of the Tiger Zone (modeled after Woods' real-life tendency to overpower his drives) can be quite beneficial. Players who can backswing into the Tiger Zone, then hit the bottom aiming mark dead-on, are rewarded with an echo-laden voice that booms, \"Tiger Shot!\" Tiger's on-screen character flashes with electricity and the ball explodes on contact with the club. Sure, it's a arcadestyle gimmick-but it's fun. Speaking of the Tiger Zone, though, the game is overloaded with cutesy-poo Tiger Talk. EA milks its beloved franchise for all it's worth with feature names like Tiger Vision, Tiger Charge, Tiger TIGER STRIPES Smack a Tiger Shot and you'll know: Tiger's body electrifies and the ball explodes on contact with the club head. It's one of the game's few arcade flourishes. Tiger Beat The game's on-course interface rivals that of LINKS LS for clean, unobtrusive design. In fact, everything you need to know is contained within the high-tech swing meter: wind speed and direction, club selection, distance to the pin, height of the pin relative to your Tips, Tiger Shots, and, you guessed it, Tiger Toons. If the game weren't So good, it might be enough to make me Tiger Puke. That said, most of these Tigerisms are actually viable gameplay features. Tiger Tips randomly appear during stroke and practice play, offering professional advice. Tiger Vision lets you choose between aggressive and safe shots, and Tiger Charge gives the computer-controlled Tiger an extra Al boost after a birdie, eagle, or monster drive. Some other minor quibbles include tedious pre-game menus that force you to jump through numerous hoops and sub-menus to set options before finally hitting the greens. (Fans familiar with other recent menu-happy EA Sports titles know what a pain this can be.) The printed game manual is actually better than we've come to expect from EA, but it's still a gray, colorless read, augmented with online help and a browser-enabled Play Guide that took me a good 30 minutes to get working. I suspect EA has a lot of patching to do here. Luckily, the game features a built-in Internet update utility. Multiplayer support is well represented, as you might expect. Internet play is free and features both voice and text chat to \"heckle\" (EA's term) your opponents. First rule of golf: Don't heckle someone holding a 9 iron unless you're on the Internet, where sportsmanship doesn't apply. Rudeness aside, this is a great game for remote play, be it over the Internet, a LAN, or a direct modem link. Back to the Clubhouse All in all, TIGER WOODS 99 is a solid continuation of EA Sports' great PGA TOUR GOLF series. It's challenging but not difficult, fun but not silly. Once EA irons out all the wrinkles, this should be a contender. CGW COURSELY CONSTRUCTED TIGER WOODS 99's combination of 2D pre-rendered backdrops and 3D foregrounds sometimes don't mix, as seen in this oddly composed shot. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"REVIEW GOLDEN TEE GOLF SPORTS Smashmouth Golf Coin-op Mega-hit Makes a Surprisingly Great PC Debut VOILET GOLDEN TEE is to golf sims what Sierra's 3D ULTRA PINBALL is to pinball sims. In other words, don't expect a lot of realism. Everything is either over-simplified or wildly exaggerated. Where else can you knock in a 60-foot putt your first time out, or bag a double eagle without breaking a sweat? The best comparison I can make would be with Sony's outrageously enjoyable HOT SHOTS GOLF on the PlayStation. WAS.ME by Scott May love computer golf, but 1 have to admit, some golf sims take themselves far too seriously. Designers are so caught up in a high-tech war of 3D graphic engines and ultra-realistic ball physics that they forget to have fun. And that's what golf is all about. That's why I welcome games like GOLDEN TEE GOLF. This is the most fun I've had on digital greens since Access Software's original 8bit LEADERBOARD GOLF, GOLDEN TEE's PC version is based on Incredible Technologies' own 1995 coin-op smash, PETER JACOBSEN'S GOLDEN TEE 3D GOLF, which ranked among the top five arcade games for more than two years. In just a few short rounds, you'll understand why. 275 M. ILYEN OPTIONS CIUS 9548YST3 REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN TEE Game graphics in GOLDEN TEE GOLF are big and colorful, but could use a little 3D kick. terrain look like bizarre sets from TV's Lost in Space. COMPUTER WORLD delivers a nice little tactile \"hit\" upon contact with the ball. Many other publishers are trying to reinvent the computer mouse swing, but TrackSwing stands out as a model of simplicity and execution. If you own a trackball, it works even better. Other goodies include auto-save highlights, a Greatest Shots Club, and hilarious voice-overs that spout encouragements like, \"You are the greatest!\" in an earnestly dopey, Greg Brady kind of way. Ya gotta love it. It's been ages since I've played a golf game as fun and addictive as GOLDEN TEE GOLF. Who needs realism when you've got gameplay this hot? CGW **** LINKS, It Ain't What GOLDEN TEE lacks in realism it makes up for with pure, unabashed fun. The PC translation is a dead-on clone of the coin-op version, enhanced with multiplayer support, recorded play, and voice chat. True to its arcade roots, the game is so easy to play, even bare beginners will be up and swinging like pros within a few minutes. Believe it or not, such simplicity is key to the game's long-term appeal. Average players can pound out 18 holes in 30 minutes or less. The real trick is limiting yourself to just 18 holes. The game's physics model is loose, to say the least, but can be easily tightened up in the options menu as your experience grows. Three fantasy courses are available, with additional links available soon perhaps by the time you read this. That's great, but why not cut to the chase and release a course-construction kit instead? In all honesty, the course graphics here are colorful and fun, but they're nothing to send TIGER WOODS 99 or LINKS LS running back to the drawing board. The course graphics in GOLDEN TEE drip fantasy cut-and-paste: Weird archipelagoes and oddly mixed foliage line some fairways. Objects like cactus and boulders stand like monoliths, absurdly out of proportion, making some Reinventing the Trackball In the coin-op version, players control the club swing using a trackball. Sounds goofy, but it really works well. In the PC version, IT developed something called TrackSwing, which recreates the trackball mechanics using a mouse. Players first pull back the mouse to initiate the backswing, which moves the distance bar in the overhead window. Next, simply push forward to complete the swing and hit the ball. To hook or slice, push forward with a rightor left-hand curve. The motion feels natural and APPEAL: Arcade-style golf fans. PROS: Fast, fun game. play, faithful adaptation of Golden lee! Wind smash; outstanding solo, multiplayer and recorded play options; TrackSwing is a gas. CONS: No course construction set: graphics beg for 3D acceleration. DIFFICULTY: Easy.

"REVIEW  COMMANDOS: BEHIND ENEMY LINES Not So Special Forces TRATEGYZWAR The Soldiers in COMMANDOS Are More Puzzle Pieces Than Fighters by Tim Carter as the seemingly endless deluge of unoriginal, cookie-cutter realtime strategy games got you down? Are you feeling like it's time for something different? COMMANDOS: BEHIND ENEMY LINES from Eidos Interactive is unquestionably one of the most different games to hit either the strategy or action markets over the last few years. Of course, difference comes with a price. In COMMANDOS, you follow a 24-scenario campaign that begins in 1941 and lasts throughout the war in Europe. The Germans control the continent, and it's your job to conduct small but significant raids to tie down troops, keep morale up at home, and facilitate victory in the great battles to come. COMPUTER over a machine gun post or capture a tank, you may be able to shoot it. (Yes, vehicles play an important role in many missions and may be used by your troops to good effect.) But otherwise secrecy is the name of the game. Surprisingly enough, the relationship between planning and execution in COMMANDOS detracts somewhat from gameplay. Given your highly specific resources, each mission becomes an elaborate problem-solving enterprise. And, while there is usually more than one way to solve each puzzle, SNOW SHOES Dodging multiple sentries is typical of the puz there are also a lot of wrong ways zles in COMMANDOS.

Braveheart combines real-time MULTIPLAYER strategy with global management in a brutal reenactment of the war between sword-wielding Scottish clansmen and expansionist English forces. The general idea was to create an environment where the player could dictate his own destiny. So we created a free-form game system limited only by the rules of the 13th century.

The general structure is simple an army is divided into a maximum of ten units. A unit is basically a collection of similar soldiers to a maximum of 50. Tactical commands can be issued to units, where strategic commands are performed by whole armies. The player can issue basic commands on any selected characters. How will the use of formations affect combat. Please give specific details of the usefulness of a couple of formations? A good example of formation use was shown in the movie where a line of long spearsmen for all intent and purposes nullified a charge of cavalry. This will be fully supported in the game.

"REVIEW PEOPLE'S GENERAL The People Deserve Better STRATEGYZWARI Creativity Is Lacking in Great PEOPLE'S GENERAL Engine by Tim Carter apitalism, democracy freedom... Those oh-sointangible qualities that have allowed the good guys to triumph over countless hoards of historical and fictitious automaton-like hoards. As one of the good guys, your equipment is good enough, but it's your ingenuity—the product of a centuries-old free society--that will see you through. It's a pity, however, that the challenges—and the very battlefield on which you are expected to triumph-appear to have been created by, well, automatons. (They must be New Age Communists, however, since they want your money, too.) PEOPLE'S GENERAL puts you in charge of the combined Allied changes also make PEOPLE'S GENERAL more interesting than its predecessors. For instance, you may now purchase minor customizations for your units, beefing up their abilities somewhat in particular areas. You can give some units more and better ammo, while improving others' movement and antitank or antiaircraft firepower. This is a nice touch because it allows a creative commander the chance to customize his force further. As the essence of the entire game system is getting the appropriate match-ups between your units and the enemy's units, the chance to tweak your forces, even just slightly, adds a fun, new element to the building process. Unit leaders now play a somewhat more prominent role (there are more of them), and you may also curry favor with the High Command by taking particular trigger objectives or by winning more prestige, leaders, air support, or prototype units. LACK OF DIVERSITY I wish there were more creatively crafted scenarios like this one, with a wild mix of forces deployed to win control of the trans-Siberian railway.

Oddly enough, the designers fashioned a hypothetical war between China and the rest of the world that somehow didn't involve either Taiwan or Japan.

YO ;D s with so many strategy games these days, PEOPLE'S GENERAL comes complete with its own scenario generator. Sadly, the scenario generation system is no more creative than the campaigns that come with the game. Because the maps for PEOPLE'S GENERAL are hand painted, you must choose from among the limited number that come with the game-which gets old pretty fast. You do get some useful maps of South East Asia, which should allow creative gamers to refight a few battles from the Vietnam War if they so choose. Also, you are not only limited to the units provided by the game (a quite exhaustive selection) but also to the basic preset unit and terrain characteristics. Thus, you can't really create anything genuinely new. You do have significant control over the type and composition of the opposing forces. Interestingly, the campaigns do not take advantage of the diversity of the available forces. Thus, the one attraction of the scenario generator is that it gives you the ability to field armies from, say, Germany and England. As to why the British should be duking it out in Vladivostock in the first place? Well, that's where your creativity comes in, isn't it? B2 @ 2 a PANZER GENERAL II altered the scale of the game to such an extent that most scenarios lost their you-control-the-whole-battle feel. Yet, you still had the sense that your success or failure affected historical events with which most gamers would be familiar. And, given that PEOPLE'S GENERAL posits a hypothetical future war, the designers have an even greater burden to develop a story that could carry it's own weight-something they haven't managed to pull off. As with virtually all of the GENERAL series, most scenarios also put you in the role of the attacker (unless you are in a multiplayer game). This is perhaps necessitated by the AL which is quite good at local counterattacks but otherwise seems a tad passive. Also, the Al doesn't seem to use helicopters to maximum effect, and has a tendency to leave artillery units in dangerous, unprotected situations. In PEOPLE'S GENERAL, SSI has delivered yet another great game system. Unfortunately, they haven't quite delivered the game itself. Mind you, if they were to release a scenario pack sometime in the future that compensated for the weak campaigns, I'd be the first to go out and buy it. CGW JUGGERNAUT By the later scenarios, the U.S. Army becomes unstoppable. Here, the number of units barely fits on the map. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 19 "

You dispatch the vehicles (fire trucks, ambulances, cop cars, rescue helicopters) and the staff (firemen, medics, stretcherbearers). Once they reach the scene, you decide what they do. Do you start by fighting the fire or tending to the wounded? Does one fireman or two search for victims? As in real-life, if you make the wrong decision, people die. After a few missions, the complicated controls become intuitive. (Although the human figures are small enough that you sometimes lose precious seconds trying to position your cursor so you can select the one you want.) After some simple tutorial scenarios, the missions get nicely complicated: lots of people scurrying about, lots to be done, and a ticking clock counting down the seconds to disaster. EMERGENCY surprised me with its sense of true urgency, reinforced by the terrific animations that introduce most of the scenarios. It's also more of a puzzle game (but a good puzzle game) than a strategy game, asking you to rethink and replay each scenario until you achieve a performance rating of 100 percent. With better controls, EMERGENCY would come closer to and handle battles. If you get stuck, hints are available in the manual for each mission. The missions are all well done-and are not that easy—but with a game that's been out this long, is a tutorial really needed? Newbie strategy gamers aren't likely to spend $40 on a game and another $20 on an add-on disc just to get started—this title would have made more sense had it been bundled with the executable and released as a full-fledged beginner's edition. Still, even veteran TA players will find some value here. The 100 missions are divided into four types: very short, short, medium, and long. The very short and short missions-still challenging despite their brevity-range from 5-20 minutes in length and are great for those moments when you only have time for a quick gaming break.

"REVIEWS A Classic Sampling Classics and Puzzle Reviews at a Glance CLASSICS PUZZLES aren't enough puzzle pictures and that the video clips are often too short: \"It's dith picable,\" as Daffy Duck would say. Also, nothing beats the handson experience of completing a jigsaw puzzle, the joy of admiring the completed project for a while, or the opportunity it affords for people to do something mildly constructive together while they chat. Even so, this is a great game for kids, and you won't have to hunt for lost pieces. -Petra Schlunk Looney Tunes Cosmic Capers Animated Jigsaws orbits so that identical trigrams can pair up in neighboring orbits. Paired trigrams disappear, providing extra energy for firing the gun. When all matchable trigrams are gone, you warp into the next round of play. The game ends when your gun runs out of energy. NOTYET tries to keep things interesting by incorporating additional orbiting objects: Objects that destroy trigrams (leeching energy from your gun), change orbits' directions, teleport items, and more. Elements vary in the game's different levels and mastering any of these levels can be challenging, although the game's overall difficulty level is adjustable. Aside from the dated graphics, NOTYET doesn't offer much that's new, and it's hard to imagine action-oriented puzzle gamers finding sustained amusement here. Our advice is to dust off your old copy of BAKU-BAKU, or if you want to support MVP, download RINGS OF THE MAGI, which won CGW's best Shareware Puzzle Game award for 1996. Petra Schlunk PLAY THAT features a mix of puzzles, classics, arcade, and even sports titles that we've seen before, some of which fare better than others when viewed with today's more jaded eyes. Odd Man Out is a computerized version of the peg jumping game you play country-style restaurants. Once you get the formula down, it's best forgotten, as is Walk the Plank, a graphical takeoff on Hangman. Memory Madness fares somewhat better, if only because it's replayable. Saloon Shoot Out! delivers just what it promises: a limited, if cute, shooter very common in the C-64 days. Skeet Shooter is a nice little game that lets you shoot clay pigeons from the sky in timed, championship or 25-shot modes. Given that you can fire a .22 caliber rifle or a 12or 20-gauge s hotgun solo or against three fellow marksman via hotseat, there's plenty to do here-though this game isn't quite up to the standard set by WizardWorks' SPORTING CLAYS. Air Hockey, however, is a real gem, the best version of this classic game since the heyday of the Amiga. The gliding of the puck across the \"air cushion\" is really captured nicely, and the best of the computer opponents are evil wrist action incarnate.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY. CHEATS WALKTHROUGHS Might & Magic VI CGW's Resident Mage Reaches Into Her Bag of Tricks for Some M&M Treats by Scorpia &M VI: MANDATE OF HEAVEN can be a difficult game, especially toward the beginning. The reduced party size and emphasis on skills make for a pretty big learning curve, and it's difficult to figure out the best ways to fight the opposition. There is hope, however: Getting off to a good start with a well-balanced party can go a long way toward reducing early frustration. 08 26939675 ONLY THE BEST IN USED CAMELS At Abdul's Desert Resort, you'd better have your winnings from the circus handy because Abdul won't take American Express. Knights in White...Whatever My own experience is that knights, even at high levels and after several promotions, didn't fight that much better than anyone else. Likewise, clerics have, at best, weak offensive spells (until supplemented with light and/or Dark magic). So, when tailoring my group the second time around, I dumped the knight in favor of a second archer, and dumped the cleric for a druid. Overall, the best party turned out to be an archer, a druid, and two sorcerers. This lineup gives you four characters with elemental spells, and at the higher experience levels, archers have a respectable number of spell points. Even early on in the game, an extra fireball or meteor shower can be a great help. Furthermore, archers come with the Bow skill which is tremendously helpful for much of the game. I also like to bring my archers up to speed in the Spear skill, which conveniently includes tridents and halberds. Don't Dread Druids Druids need to be built up care fully: you don't want to squander precious skill points, particularly at the start. I prefer to bring my druid quickly to expert level in Spirit (for the partywide Bless and Heroism spells), Body (for the healing), and Fire, which is the workhorse offen sive group most of the time. Afterward, you can decide where your druid's studies should be concentrated: One good method is to increase proficiency in complement to the sorcerer, with the druid working on, say, Earth and Fire while the sorcerer does Air and Water. This approach quickly gives you power in all four magical ele. ments. Of course, the cleric skills shouldn't be neglected. I generally increase Spirit and Body to master levels and leave Mind for later (though one should have Mind at least to expert level before too late in the game). I always aim for Water Master with a sorcerer as quickly as possib le. Life is much easier when you have both Lloyd's Beacon lasting for weeks and full control over Town Portal. This typically means bringing the sorcerer to Fire Expert first, then leaving that off to work on Water. Once mastery has been achieved in these skills, I turn back to the others. can drink twice from the Luck well i n New Sorpigal to restore the lost points—just make sure to go straight to the well right after the game begins. One way to get off to a good start is to show the letter to Andover and collect your money. Then, drink from the Luck well. Get the horseshoes from the stable, go to Castle Ironfist, and grab the horseshoes from the castle's stable as well. Run up the mountain, stayi ng well to the right. See Lord Humphrey.

"Outdoor Survival Go to the guild, purchase the Bow skill for everyone who needs it, and buy bows at Eagle Eye. Return to New Sorpigal via stable. Be a big spender, go around and buy guild memberships in all the guilds. Visit Blades End and get a Hand Weapon skill for archers. GAMER'S EDGE After Dark Plot Savers Wait until 6 p.m., then enter Buccaneer's Den and buy Disarm, Merchant, and Item ID, giving each skill to a different party member. Sack out at the inn (you deserve it). The next day, train your characters up to level three. Bring the Item ID skill up to four, then see the expert trainer over the inn. Give the four horseshoes to your ID expert to replace the points he or she just spent. You now have a bona fide level-three party that is capable of fighting in close or from a distance, as well as enough points to bring one skill apiece to expert level and the ability to identify a good 80-90 utdoor fighting will be a pain until you reach Free Haven, where the top-level spells, such as Meteor Shower, are available. Meteor Shower and Starburst will make your life easier in the wilderness areas. Until then, always advance slowly in the outdoors (unless you have to run), and be certain Wizard Eye is up and running all the time. Always take on monsters in small numbers, indoors or out. Even weak critters can be trouble when there are many of them, and there usually are. The basic rule to remember is TAM: There's Always More Running blindly around the countryside, or stepping blithely into an apparently empty room can get you killed very quickly. In dungeons, if nothing shows up immediately when a door is opened, move around a little: sidestep, or edge up one side or the other of the doorway, slowly. Often, you can get a good enough view to plink one monster with arrows and draw it out, thereby fighting the opposition one at a time. For weak monsters, it's best to draw out a bunch, and rip off a few Infernos to dispose of them quickly. Once you have Lloyd's Beacon, keep a beacon in New Sorpigal, and drop another in whatever dungeon you're exploring. Anytime the party is in bad shape, pop back to Sorpigal. Basic healing costs only 10 gold per character (more if you're insane or diseased), and it restores spellpoints as well as hit-points-a very inexpensive way to get fixed up without needing a lot of rest. When you can control the Town Portal, use that to visit Sorpigal instead of the beacon. Good Egg Hunting OBELISK, MY OBELISK These point the way to an optional but very nice treasure. However, you must touch each and every one of the 15 obelisks for the treasure to be active. percent of the items you find (which Helm Outpost, however, is a tough place, and can net you some real savings). best left for a time when your group is more From this point on your merchant experienced should do all transactions, including After Mist, Castle Ironfist is the place to go. buying spells, paying for rides via ship The game will turn tough here, especially in the or stable, buying and selling items, dungeons.

The Silver combat. Get them early and use them often. Stone Skin, especially at high levels, is also good. Turn-based mode is good for fighting, but you can also travel, enter/exit dungeons, and open doors in turn mode.

Training takes the same amount of time whether you're training one person or four, 1 level or 10 levels. It's therefore best to bring everyone up together, and to complete a dungeon (or dungeon and quest) before training. By going up several levels at once, you have more skill points to allocate, and this becomes important later on, when skills need a lot of points to advance.

"People's General 25EDGE MER Projecting Power in the 21st Century your understanding of modern military strategy and tactics. Moreover, learning how these systems are employed in PEOPLE'S GENERAL will not only guarantee victory on the virtual battlefield, but also ensure success on the treacherous campaign trail. are generally much more effective if employed against artillery, air defense units, and soft targetssuch as infantry and combat support units-especially if these can be engaged on clear terrain. However, AFVs are generally incapable of eliminating entrenched enemy infantry units hunkered down in cities, rough terrain, and forest hexes, and must rely upon other supporting arms to soften up these positions before they attack. Helicopter Heaven by Marc Dultz amers will readily discover that PEOPLE'S GENERAL portrays warfare in a totally different light than does its predecessor, PANZER GENERAL II. PEOPLE'S GENERAL demonstrates the profound technological advances that have emerged since the close of WWII. Fire-and-forget missiles and lethal weaponry capable of being transported by one man are now commonplace on the battlefield, and they are designed to destroy a target from several miles away. What's more, the advent of both the transportand scoutattack helicopters and the development of jet-powered, ground-attack aircraft have added an entirely new dimension to the modern battlefield. All that gives today's commanders much more flexibility and destructive capability than their WWII counterparts could ever have hoped to possess. Knowing how these complex systems operate on today's battle field will certainly help to further See the Review THIS ISSUE 3 STARS Combined Arms First popularized by the blitzkrieg strategy of the Wehrmacht during the opening stages of WWII, the combined arms concept—which entails having all available artillery, infantry, armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) and tactical airpower work in concert to achieve a common objective is even more important on today's battlefield. In PEOPLE'S GENERAL, every type of unit, whether an attack helicopter or a self-propelled artillery battery, possesses different strengths and weaknesses, making each adept at certain tasks, yet illsuited for others. For instance, armored fighting vehicles (AFVs), which include tanks and armored troop carriers, ihe naive view of attack helicopters is that they are flying tanks. In reality, choppers have some limitations, such as being forced to immediately end their movement phase if they fly within range of an enemy air defense unit. What's more, defensive air strikes against a helicopter can force it to flee from the map, rendering it totally ineffective for the duration of the turn. Whenever possible, you should always reconnoiter an area first before dispatching a helicopter, moving in an air defense unit to help protect the helicopter against enemy air-to-air fire. . tit Helicopter troop ships should be used to transport airliftable units from rear area assembly points to forward air bases, particularly when the terrain is poor and ground movement for other units is proceeding at a sluggish pace. Transport helicopters should also be used to drop air-mobile units deep behind enemy lines, seizing victory objectives or holding open critical road junctures until reinforcements can arrive. Light infantry units are particularly good at conducting air-mobile operations because they can load, fly, unload, move up to their full movement allowance, and even finally initiate an attack all on the same turn. Be advised, though, that air-mobile units cannot land in an enemy zone of control, so it's important that you conduct reconnaissance missions prior to their COOB! bi li lilili insertion in order to locate good drop zones. GODINU STUCK ON YOU Attachments are worth their weight in golden prestige points. 430 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 "


"PEOPLE'S GENERAL OSW   The development of smart bombs, sub-munitions, low-flying weapons platforms, and reconnaissance drones has made the mod ern battlefield a much more lethal environment to operate within than that of WWII, even for heavily armored forces. Although AFVs are still considered to be the king of the battlefield, they're nevertheless quite vulnerable to helicopter attacks, air strikes, and antitank weapons. Unless accompanied by strong air defense and rapidly advancing infantry forces, even the best AFVs can be pummeled and destroyed in rather methodical fashion. Your goal is to requisition, field, and maintain as wide an array of forces as possible one that will immediately be able to overcome any type of threat. While it certainly helps to have a plentiful supply of cheap units at the ready, in reality it is advantageous to have only a few battlehardened units on hand rather than hordes of inexperienced units. Although veteran and elite units cost more to purchase than inexperienced units (units typically cost 30 prestige points per experience level), they also sustain far fewer casualties in battle and inflict far greater losses upon the enemy. What's more, veteran and elite units can also be pumped up to higher than normal strength levels between scenarios, thereby increasing their staying power on the battlefield and improving their combat effectiveness. Finally, veteran and elite units can receive replacements several times during up to full strength). Therefore, moment they are purchased. Even a scenario before their combat unless the unit is very experienced, though attachments increase the strength begins to show signs of it probably makes more sense to purchase price of a new unit (30 e roding, an important point to temporarily withdraw those units prestige points per attachment for remember because of the manner that have received numerous the Western side, 50 per attachin which replacements are now replacements during the later ment for the Chinese), they are treated in PEOPLE'S GENERAL stages of a scenario, taking them nevertheless very important assets off the front lines to guard a CSU to have on hand, especially for A Matter of Prestige or some other supporting arm. armored, artillery, and overDuring a battle, prestige is no Another principal difference strength units.

Whenever the air superiority level is low, all friendly helicopter movement is severely curtailed, reducing their range, airlift capability and combat effectiveness. By the same token, a low air-superiority level will reduce the range of friendly fixed-wing aircraft, making them far less effective in both the reconnaissance and air-strike roles. Despite the relatively high cost, you should always adjust your air superiority level to 100 percent, spending as many prestige points as it takes to ensure air supremacy and complete freedom of movement.

Resist the temptation to spend all of your prestige points on air missions at the first sign of trouble. Instead, spend your points in small increments, making sure to always keep enough prestige points on hand to call in any type of air mission, even during the latter stages of a scenario. Attack helicopters are especially good at softening up enemy positions, especially armored concentrations, before a ground assault is undertaken. Attack choppers should also be used to destroy any enemy units that may be situated outside the combat range of friendly ground forces. Lastly, attack choppers are good at protecting open flanks, and they are generally able to blunt or slow an enemy drive until friendly ground forces can be brought up. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1998 431 "


"PEOPLE'S GENERAL Finally, it makes sense to add a combat support attachment to either overstrength units or units containing a leader. The combat support attachment will not only let the unit recover all of its original overstrength level during the replacement phase but also negate the effect of diminishing replacements. In effect, these powerful units will stay strong for the duration of the scenario, which in turn means they'll probably accumulate even more experience points as the battle wears on. IRON CURTAIN It appears as if this Chinese combat group is in full view of the nearby Russian forces, but the recon unit is screening their advance. spotting capability of the AFV but also serve to reduce its profile, making it much harder for enemy units to spot it. Generally, infantry-type units should be allotted a forward observer attachment, since this will allow them to call in much more accurate artillery fire against adjacent enemy units. Combat engineer attachments would be an equally wise choice, since this will make it much easier for the unit to stave off a close assault. By the same token, infantry units, reinforced with combat engineers, make ideal candidates to root out entrenched enemy infantry units that may be guarding key victory objectives. Reconnaissance units, charged with scouting ahead of the main body, should be provided with both air defense and antitank attachments to bolster their defensive capabilities should they run into unexpected resistance. And, because they can quickly deplete their stocks of ammunition, artillery units should be assigned both special munitions and combat support attachments. The combat support attachment will permit the artillery unit to fire off more shells before requiring resupply, while the special munitions attachment will improve the artillery's hard and soft attack ratings, making them much more effective in both the supporting fire and counterbattery roles. Force Multipliers The combat support unit (CSU) is perhaps the most important unit in your arsenal, serving, for all intents and purposes, as a mobile reinforcement center. Now, instead of having to deploy units at distant supply hexes far removed from the Forward Edge of the Battlefield Area (FEBA), you can put new units into play in the hexes surrounding a CSU, so long as the CSU isn't adjacent to an enemy unit. Interestingly, additional CSUS can be purchased, deployed, and moved all in the same turn, in much the same manner as regular combat units. Theoretically then, a player can create a continuous chain of CSUs, placing new CSUS and fresh units closer to the front lines, where they're obviously needed most. Building, then moving, multiple CSUs closer to the FEBA becomes Order of Battle nowing how, when, and where to commit your forces to battle is certainly one of the most fundamental concepts operating in PEOPLE'S GENERAL.

Aerial reconnaissance should instead be used to reconnoiter the enemy's rear areas, searching for potential drop sites for your air-mobile forces. Decause the spotting rules have been changed significantly since PANZER GENERAL II, you should use your reconnaissance vehicles to locate and ascertain the strength of the enemy forces before initiating any other movement or attacks. 432 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

AMERISEDLCE 42 The Commander's Joystick dangerous threat first. If there are multiple threats capable of destroying your tank, it's best to run for the nearest cover and plot a new course of action. Dy using a relatively inexpensive four-button joystick D equipped with a hat switch and remapping a few keyboard commands, you can improve your response time in tight situations. For example, a joystick setup to assist with gunnery is: Maneuver Combat While Greyhound might want you to \"leave the driving to us,\" turning your driving duties over to the Al isn't a good idea in PANZER COMMANDER. The virtual drivers always attempt to follow suggested waypoints—which usually means driving directly into areas where you'll encounter the most resistance and the greatest danger. Early in a mission, it's a good idea to spend a minute or two studying the map, preferably in a safe location. This will help you get your bearings. On missions in which your platoon must cover a lot of ground, take an occasional glance at the map to make sure you're on course and to spot areas you must capture (shown as yellow blocks). When you attack, always look for opportunities to outflank the enemy's defenses. Antitank emplacements have a 90-degree field of fire to their front (45 degrees each side of center). Thus, when you're faced with numerous 22 Button 1: Fires main gun Button 2: Fires coaxial machine gun Button 3: Gunner's sight 2.5x view Button 4: Gunner's sight 5x view Hat switch: Adjusts cross-hairs ranging Joystick: Elevates gun, depresses gun, and traverses turret In the unbuttoned, binocular, and external views, the joystick's hat switch can be used to rapidly pan the view 360 degrees around the tank or to look up or down, greatly aiding in spotting targets. If you're buttoned up in the commander's station, the hat switch will pan the view through the cupola viewport. Bringing the tank to an immediate halt to fire an accurate shot depends on being able to quickly press the brake key. If the default delete key is too cumbersome, remap the keyboard commands to make the space bar the brake command. When the joystick is used for gunnery, the space bar becomes superfluous for firing the main gun. If you keep one hand on the joystick and the other on the keyboard, it becomes much easier to coordinate spotting, maneuver, and use your gunnery. On the move, use keyboard commands to speed up, slow down, or stop the tank. From the unbuttoned or external view, keep your thumb on the joystick's hat switch to constantly scan the area to the front and around your tank.

Again, fight from hull-down positions whenever possible. Once contact with the enemy is made, the best approach is usually a cautious advance that enables you to engage and destroy targets one at a time. However, there are times when getting from Point A to Point B means exposing your platoon to enemy fire. In these instances, a mad dash at top speed is in order. Make a few zigzags to throw off enemy aim and make use of cover as much as possible. Learn to recognize terrain such as mud, ice, and steep slopes that slow your movement to a crawl. Not only do you risk being caught in the open with no chance to run for cover, but you also hurt your chances for completing a mission on time. Divide and Slaughter Whether attacking or defending. you should always try to take on enemy units a few at a time. Use hills, valleys, and forests to screen your movement and to limit how many enemy units can see you at any one time. Slowly ease your way over hills to spot threats on the opposite side before moving through unscouted areas. Avoid \"skylining\" tanks in your platoon—the practice of moving along the highest point of a crest or hill, which endangers your tank by silhouetting it against the sky. Always be on the lookout for terrain behind which your entire platoon can be deployed to fight from hull-down positions. That is, the tank's turret and gun should peek over the top while its hull remains hidden. Walls, hills, and low rises work best for this tactic. Practice the maneuver by observing through the unzoomed gunsight view (F6) as your tank slowly climbs the crest of a hill. The moment you can see over the other side, hit the brakes. When defending, don't be content to sit in one place. Many times, enemy units will attack from more than one direction. Move to a position that enables your tank to engage a few attackers at a time and that provides cover to the s time progresses in campaign games, you're occasionally asked if you want to upgrade to a new or improved tank. Think carefully before making this decision. Some \"upgrades\" require you to sacrifice advantages you might prefer to keep. For example, during the Soviet 12th Guards campaign, you can upgrade from the KV-1/42 to the KV-1S. The S model is faster, but sacrifices a significant amount of armor for increased speed. Near the end of the 12th Guards campaign, you can switch to the mighty IS-2, a fairly mobile tank with a huge gun and thick armor. Unfortunately, this beast carries a pitifully small load of ammunition, a distinct drawback on longer missions. You might want to seriously consider sticking with the KV-85. Fire Combat In PANZER COMMANDER, shooting the big gun is the most fun. Although the Al gunners usually do a competent job of engaging and destroying targets, few players are content to delegate this duty to their crew. The joy of putting steel on target and turning enemy tanks into smoldering scrap metal is what this game is all about. But shooting the gun is one thing, and doing it well is another.

However, there are times when firing on the move is required to deal with a well-positioned enemy gun or vehicle behind a hedge, forest, or hill. In such a case, it's important to line up the target and correctly time your approach. Enemy vehicles behind cover will almost always fire before they can actually hit your tank. Therefore, by having your gun aimed toward the enemy unit and advancing slowly to keep your gunsight picture fairly stable, you can often emerge from behind cover while the opposing vehicle is busy reloading. In this situation, you must make your first shot count. If you miss, you're dead. Also, don't neglect to use your tank's coaxial machine gun. It's very good for taking out sandbagged infantry and antitank emplacements within a few hundred meters of your tank. In addition, you can use it to knock down buildings that enemy vehicles are hiding behind. Have your finger on the main gunfire button to instantly pump an armor-piercing round into your surprised enemy. Although air support, artillery, and infantry are part of PANZER COMMANDER, it is neither a game about WWII combined-arms tactics nor a game that enables players to duplicate the exploits of the war's great task force and kampfgruppe commanders. It's a game that's unabashedly about tanks and what it's like to command from the turret of a lumbering iron beast. The sooner you can put yourself in that frame of mind, the better player you'll become. CGW Inicio no time use the rangefinder. In fact, using the 5x magnification view for close targets can be disorienting and waste precious time. Instead, switch immediately to the 2.5x (F6) gunsight, which offers a wider view, making it easier to quickly locate nearby targets. Although, there is no rangefinder in this view, the basic reticule is quite effective for close-range shooting, especially if your tank is equipped with a high-velocity gun. Simply point and shoot. With prac tice, you'll find that you can shoot quickly and accurately by estimating the proper lead and elevation. Because WWII tanks don't have the qun stabilization and fire control systems that make modern 500 1000 1500 .2000 UNSAFE HOUSE These two Panthers thought they were safely under cover behind a house in front of them. Machine gun fire brought down the house, exposing the Panthers. Before they could react, both were destroyed by a T-34/85. You should familiarize yourself with the performance of the gun your tank carries (see chart). Being able to hit an enemy vehicle means little if your gun can't penetrate its armor. The armor penetrating power of your tank's gun determines whether you can engage in long-range, straight-up shootouts or whether you should maneuver for a close flank or rear shot. Some guns, particularly on earlywar tanks, fire rounds at such low velocities, their effective range is 500 meters or less. For them, using the rangefinder in the 5x (F7) view to dial in the correct range is almost a must. As the war progressed, most nationalities adopted larger-caliber, high-velocity guns that fired on flatter trajectories out to ranges of 1,500 meters and beyond, the German 88mm being the most famous example. Make It Snappy One valuable tank gunnery technique is firing snap shots. Sometimes you'll find yourself in a situation in which enemy vehicles or antitank emplacements are so close and threatening that there is TERRAIN MASKING Using terrain effectively is a major part of the game. Here, two T-34/85s conceal themselves behind buildings in hopes of luring German Panthers into a trap.

Most radio messages warn of an impending attack, and the sound of people conversing in Vietnamese is always bad. You can usually hear artillery and air strikes on their way in, allowing you time to take cover. 4. Use your grunts well. They provide covering fire and medical assistance (among other things), but you can't rely on them to survive in a hostile environment. If you think they will die uselessly, and if you want their assistance later, consider ordering them to stay in cover until you need them. 5. Don't try to kill everything in sight. Keep moving, use cover wisely, and work your way directly toward your objective. If you're under fire and can't immediately identify where the threat is coming from, or if it's coming from several directions, get under cover before worrying about shooting back. Don't stand and slug it out. If possible, let the VC come to you, then pick them off one at a time. Tim Carter um sdil sdil sdu sdl sdi sdii sdu sdm 1. Update to MECHCOMMANDER version 1.8. 2.

"Upgrade This! Or, My Force-Feedback Joystick and / Would Like to Be Alone Now right in my house. Would that make them happy? and the fact that Denny will now allow me to keep my kneecaps), I find myself being bummed out and frustrated. Why? Because now that I own the darn thing, I'm already beginning to feel the need to upgrade it. Whence sprang these feelings of inadequacy? From right about ontrary to what you might believe, magazine editors do not make a lot of money. Let me rephrase that. Gaming magazine editors do not make a lot of money. Think of it as simple supply and demand. If it's a brain transplant you're after, well, there aren't many people who can do the job for you—at least, not many who can do it in a way that wouldn't hurt you really, really badly-50 you have to pay a lot for it. Sorry. That's what you get for needing a new brain. But any moron with a computer, bad posture, and an inflated sense of self-worth can write a game review. I mean, really. It's not like any of us went to some kind of gaming graduate school to learn how to do this. So I accept my embarrassingly piddling salary without complaint, and I would certainly never stoop to whining about it in public even if I was bitter, which I'm not. The truth is that the executives here simply would not be able to take all the golf trips and Aspen retreats neces sary to keep this magazine running if I started demanding money so that my child could eat a healthy dinner for once. And UNREAL is just the beginning. As I worked on this month's Holiday Hot 100 feature, I kept coming across games with system requirements that were just horrendously high, or that were going to make me buy more components if I wanted to enjoy the game to its fullest. It's ridiculous. I mean, how does the hard-core gamer with out the high-end salary keep up anymore? How are you supposed to plop down your hardearned cash on a machine, knowing it's going to be obsolete in a year? Just how often are we expected to buy a new CPU? You know what I think? think there are just too many people in this industry who are Yeah, I know. I don't really need any of this stuff. And I know that the trade-off for this expensive mania is cooler looking games than ever beforelike NEED FOR SPEED III, a game so pretty that I would marry it if it would have me. But when you step back for a second and look at all the money that people are being asked to invest in the name of computer entertainment, it just gets kind of depressing and horrifying and a little bit sick. I can't stand it anymore. It's time for a revolution. It's time to stick it to The Man. Rise up, my JEFF GREEN Any moron with a computer, bad posture, and an inflated sense of self-worth can write a game review. the time that I first tried to play UNREAL, that's whence. Actually, guess they first began in junior high school P.E. class, if you must know, but that's not a topic for discussion here. Rest assured that I have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, and I wouldn't admit it here if I did. UNREAL, along with being the most beautiful and boring first person shooter ever (think of it as Myst for the testosterone set), is just the latest example of a game that \"pushes the enve. lope\" so far in terms of technology that, while it's a beauty to behold, it is nearly impossible to play unless you're dedicated to spending all your money on the latest and greatest hardware. using too much free equipment. they forget that everyone else out there has to spend real money on this stuff. And it's not just CPUs. It's speakers, 3D cards (my Voodoo card now needs to be replaced with a Voodoo2), game controllers, and more. When I became CGW's sports editor, accepted the fact that I needed a gamepad. Then I realized I'd need a joystick, too, for driving games. Then I needed a forcefeedback joystick. Then I needed a steering wheel. Now I need a force feedback wheel Coming up next year, I suppose, I'll need a mylar body suit and brain implants and life-size replica of a Formula One car friends. Unplug your Pentiums. Put those 386s and Mac Pluses back on your desks and let's get some multiplayer TETRIS going. The world's gone mad and it's time to stop it. And any of you who are righteously disconnecting your forcefeedback wheels out of protest, send 'em my way. I'll need the cables and pedals, too. CGW In any event, the only reason I'm discussing my financial misery is that I just finally paid off the last of my debt to Features Editor Denny \"Cement Shoes\" Atkin, who sold me his Pentium 233/MMX about six months ago. But instead of being able to rejoice at my financial freedom What Jeff doesn't realize is that the next wave of computer games will all be backwardcompatible with his Mac Plus, which now sits in his closet next to his CB radio and dial telephone.
