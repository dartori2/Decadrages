"WHY IS DUKE NUKEM 3D THE BEST? Even running in super crisp 800x600 SVGA it blasts along faster than every other comparable 3D PC title, It's not pure speed at the expense of versatility either it is possible to look up, down, or sideways at any time, with the bitmapped scenery undergoing minimal deformation and no speed loss whatsoever. The engine also caters for full interaction, so bullets leave pock marks on walls, enemy's blood drips down crates and earthquakes cause huge sections to shift altogether, thereby granting access to new locations. It all contributes to the feeling of being encased within a grim world as opposed to wandering through impregnable, static corridors. The effect is hugely rewarding and is surely the direction in which such games should be heading. Computer Player PC Entertainme VA perfect 10!\" Out of 5 stars This potential has luckily been exploited too. So often games fail to capitalize on excellent technologies but each of Duke Nukem's levels are noticeably different, being packed with huge ramps, drops, lifts, jumps and cunningly hidden secret areas. None look the same (indeed there is often a significant variation within a single building) and there is always a feeling that there is a new trick round the next corner. — Edge Magazine In terms of graphics, gameplay and overall go more strategy and variety than DOOM.

"CREDITS The #1 Computer Game Magazine World AUGUST 1995 PUBLISHER Dale Strang Elliott \"Gunboy\" Chin is the editor responsi ble for the Action and Strategy sections in CGW.A huge fan of CivCiv II, WARCRAFT II, and sidescrolling fighting games, his latest obsession is spanking his colleagues in Quake DeathMatches. Gunboy is also an RPG fanatic, and has been playing Advanced Dungeons & Dragons for over ten years. Never a great CRPG fan, he has recently been lured to desktop role-playing by the sweet alpha of Blizzard's DIABLO. Now he's crawling through diabolical dungeons, fragging space soldiers and commanding lovable, destructive Orcs. He definitely loves his job.

He is a mem. ber of the Horror Writers Association, and has had his short stories published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and other publications. But not all is work for the Master of Quip.

Malstrom Graphic Artist Jack Rodrigues Graphic Artist Dan Fitzpatrick PRODUCTION Production Manager Steve Spingola Production Coordinator Martin Walthall Gordon Goble, a confessed sports junkie, is an aficionado of reflex-testing simulations of all kinds. When he's not cruisin' the Net to get scoring updates for his hockey pool, Gordon is busy hot-wiring his Pentium to run the latest racing simulators and sports games. Formerly an agent for a professional auto racing team, he now runs his own one-man desktop publishing business in Vancouver, B.C. He got hooked on computer racing with INDIANAPOLIS 500, and since then has continued a relentless pursuit of authenticity over flash in his pursuit of the ultimate digital sports experience. If it weren't for Papyrus, Electronic Arts and MicroProse, he would probably be spending all of his free time at the tennis courts or gym.

For several years he has been a regular contributor of game reviews for CGW, and last year, began writing the popular, \"What's the Deal With...\" editorial column. In the distant past, he was indoctrinated in the arcane com: puting arts but has turned his back on them in the name of Science Fiction literature, which he tries to write when he isn't knee. deep in games to review or the daily duties of being a husband and father. Jack Rodrigues is a stealth weapon in the CGW arsenal. A talented graphic artist with a knack for seamlessly grafting heads onto disparate bodies (e.g., Elvira), Jack is a hard-core gamer who traces his roots to text adventures on the Apple II. He got hooked on flight sims with Sid Meier's HELLCAT ACE, which led him to FLIGHT SIMULATOR, F-15 STRIKE EAGLE, GUNSHIP and FALCON. His interest in fixed wing and rotary flight sims comes as no surprise, since he served as a crew chief on CH-46 Sea Knight troop helicopters in the Marine Corps. Accordingly, he's logging lots of hours with APACHE LONGBOW, but he's also playing TERRA NOVA, STONEKEEP and Quake, while eagerly awaiting FIGHTING FALCONS: BACK TO BAGHDAD. DIABLO and RETURN TO KRONDOR (whew!). Both hardware and software literate, Jack spends the remainder of his off-hours scouring news groups and posting messages about technology and gaming. Trouble is, the guy's so knowl. edgable he can argue any side of an issue, and often does, which can turn even an offhand remark into a marathon debate. But that's what makes him a CGW kind of guy.

"JUST THE FAQS strategy games, these recreate historical conflicts from a command perspective. They may be tactical, operational, or strategic, and stress anything from logistics and fire. power to morale and leadership. They may be simple (PANZER GENERAL, EMPIRE II) to incredibly detailed and complex (PACIFIC WAR). How Do We Classify Games? Action/Arcade (AC): The emphasis is on hand-eye coordina tion and reflexes, usually emphasize ing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure (AD): Games where in you control an alter ego and move through a storyline or sequence of events, where puzzle. solving takes precedence over con versation and combat. Classics/Puzzles (CP): Classics are old stand-bys and par lor games that appeal to many different types of gamer. Examples include: backgammon, bridge, chess, MONOPOLY, parchesi, Risk, and SOLITAIRE. Puzzle games are computer games which emphasize spatial relationships, word games and/or problem-solving without requiring gamers to follow a story line. Examples would be: SHANGHAI, TETRIS and ZIG-ZAG. Role-Playing (RP): RPGs are a subset of adventure games, but stress character development, often through improving stats or other attributes. Conversations with non player characters (NPCs) and tactical combat are generally more important than in Adventure games. Finally, the game world tends to be large, and the plot less linear, often with some quests/treks outside the main storyline. Simulations (SI): Highly realistic games from a first-person perspective: you may drive a real istically simulated race car, fly a military aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed sci-fi environment. Usually polygon-filled technology is used to build the simulated world on the fly. Sports (SP): The sports game category is a broad genre which includes action (NBA Live) and strategy games (FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO) based on sports. Strategy (ST): Problem-solving, short and long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X.COM, OUTPOST, MOO), as well as \"pure\" strategy games and \"software toys\" such as SIMCITY. Wargames (WG): A subset of What Is Your Reviews Policy? 1) We only review from the final copy of the game. Though it has become popular among PC gaming magazines to review from late beta copies, we feel that the reader is best served by having the reviewer look at the same copy of a game that the readers will find on the shelves. While we recognize that this causes some delay in coverage, We believe the reader is better served by such caution. 2) We expect our reviewers to finish the game. We want our readers to be assured that we do not review based on immediate or early impressions of a game. Our reviewers give a game ample opportunity to show its quality. In some cases, bugs make it impossible to finish a game, but we identify situations where that has occurred. 3) We make every effort to match the reviewer to the game. We take into consideration the preferences, background and possible biases of the reviewer and, where possible, we find people with actual life expe. rience or special backgrounds that match a game. We believe this policy enhances both the credibility of the review and the enjoyment of gameplay when the real world and the game world are competently compared. 4) We do not accept free travel from software or hardware compa. nies. We believe such gifts have a tacit assumption of coverage attached to them. We will only cover such events/launches as we believe will benefit our readers. HOW DO WE RATE? Outstanding: Very Good: A Average: A Weak: A game The rare game high-quality game mixed bag. Can with serious prob that gets it all that succeeds in be a game that lems. Usually right.

"JOHNNY WILSON edi to The Future Of Gaming Are Computer Games Here To Stay? angles with which to view decapita: tion. opponent for them at a moment's notice. All would be done without interrupting the television picture because of the cable modem's superior bandwidth on the downlink. t's always dangerous to speculate on the future, especially when you're dealing with intelligent read. ers who tend to have long memories. Still, I have to address this subject, because lots of people, for whom I have the greatest respect, believe that the computer game industry is creatively dead. They believe that the MOTS (More Of The Same) themes of the latest Electronic Entertainment Exposition in Los Angeles loudly proclaimed the death knell for the industry. Of course, I have little to lose in addressing this subject. If I'm right, I won't be writing this column in the ten years or so when my visions might or might not come true. If I'm wrong, you'll have a hard time figuring out where to send the letter to the edi. tor. Frankly, I believe that the latest E3 show does sound a warning for the industry. The hottest games at the show seemed to be merely the games of a decade ago with better graphics and sound. New technologies are used to rehash old concepts rather than to explore new ones. That's not always bad, but it sure reduces the opportuni ties for fresh perspectives. After all, there are only so many tricks you can use to enhance on-screen blood and only so many camera CONNECTION Fortunately, I am an optimist. I still feel like computer games will permeate our lives in the future. Like Douglas Adams' supernatural private eye, Dirk Gently, I believe in the connectedness of all things. I particularly believe in the connect edness of all things electronic and I think they will bind us to each other in the future. I still expect to see the time where there will be multiple CPUs (of varying vintages and capabilities) in the home and they will all connect to the stereo, television, satellite dish, home appliances, and home security, as necessary. Essentially, home LANS connected to a cable modem which, in turn, connects them to the Web With the cable television con nection, casual gamers will watch televised sports events as they watch live updates of their fantasy team records and compare their team side by side with their neighbors in a window on the television screen/monitor. Or, they could play a simulation of the game at the same time it is going on.

"WWII Grand Strategy Game TKIAD REICH PC North Sea Britain 10. HOY 2 TRB MSITUNISTES Are you a student of World War II history?

Soon after, I believe it will surpass the maturing forms. I also believe that the new technologies upon which I've speculated will offer new opportunities to design computer games that are more than \"shoot ers,\" more than \"hack and slash.\" And, God willing, I think I'll still be covering it as the grand old man of Computer Gaming World. Yes, there are times when I find myself getting frustrated at the immaturity of our medium and the lack of creativity that seems visible in today's products. But as I said in comparing the software industry with the film industry in a 1990 interview with The San Francisco Examiner's Image magazine, \"We're in the early silents.\" As we enter this new era of connectivity, we might just have entered the period of the talkies. advance, but we can have interactive dramas on the low end and move realistic avatars through imaginary worlds on the high end. Such potential allows for more advanced human interaction than violence and lets gamers establish virtual relationships. As in any art form, these relationships may be based in fictional worlds, based on non-existent situations, and involve imaginary characters, but they are a metaphor for life. They can teach us and sensitize us to new perspectives, cultures and ideals. That's an exciting potential.

(Starting at what (Some vendors say it only goes to 180.) Eric Lai Florence, SC LETTER OF THE MONTH Computer Gaming World is always thinner in the summer because there are less games to write about in the summer. We put out megazines (huge issues) in the winter because most game companies publish the bulk of their products for the holiday season. As for the difference between a Pentium and a Pentium Pro (P6), it isn't merely a matter of speed. There are Pentium processors that run up to 200 Mhz and there are fast Pentium Pro processors in the same range. It's not the clock speed that makes a difference. Finally, as for upgrading to a P6 processor, DONT DO IT! Until we reach the point of true 32-bit gaming, you'll actually be sabotaging your performance instead of enhancing it.

The company's spec sheet indicated it didn't support \"trilinear interpolation,\" because, as it turns out, that ferm is patented. Instead, the chip supports \"advanced interpolation techniques,\" which is essentially the same thing. Also, their spec sheet referred to \"lighting effects,\" but didn't mention support for source lights (rather than lit textures, a cheaper method of simulating lighting).

"READ.ME New Sony PC Highlights PC Expo Toshiba, Panasonic Unveil New DVD CD-ROM Drives C Expo isn't a game show. Access Software, showing near-final versions of LINKS LS and THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE, was the only game software developer we saw on the floor when we visited the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York on June 19. Despite the fact that PC Expo is the \"anti-E3\" (Electronic Entertainment Expo), the show's hardware emphasis meant that there were a number of products of interest to the gamer. The attention-getter at the show was the new PC by Sony line, notable as much for what it doesn't do as for what it does. The Sony VAIO PCV.70 and PCV-90 aren't Gateway Destination competitors or \"con. sumer appliance\" PCs. They don't bring anything new to the technology party, but they do tie together leading-edge PC technology with some of the best design work and user-comfort features we've seen yet. The initial line will sport 166and 200-MHz Pentium processors, 16 to 32MB of RAM, an ATI 3D Rage video chip with 2MB of video RAM, an 8x CDROM, a 28.8kbps Digital Simultaneous Voice and Data modem with speaker-phone fea. tools in this sleek plastic shell-and the software bundle. The VAIO Space front end is a high-tech Microsoft Bos that doesn't insult your intelligence. You can launch games and applications from this interface, as well as control all the audio video aspects of the machine. You'll also find a huge bundle of software, including an enhanced Direct 3D version of Activision's MECHWARRIOR 2. Expect Sony to develop titles to take advantage of the units' impressive software MPEG capabilities. With color-coded ports, easy access, the most complete system help files we've ever seen, and high-performance components, Sony seems to have done its homework. The only inade. quacy we noticed when working with the machine was the lack of true wavetable sound. Music is provided by an OPL3 synth chip, with an optional softwarebased wavetable emulation mode that eats valuable processor power. With Sony plastering the machine with the VAIO (Video Audio Integrated Operation), it's surprising to see them skimp on wavetable music support. Also of interest to gamers were prototype DVD-ROM players shown by Toshiba, Panasonic, and other compa tures, and Universal Serial Bus support. Matching 15-in, and 17-in. Trinitron monitors include a built-in speaker and subwoofer set. What differentiates these PCs are the case design-you can access any component without continued on page 33 ...

Sid Meier, who designed the classic CIVILIZATION, is joined by former MicroProse members Brian Reynolds and Jeff Briggs in the new development compa: ny, named Firaxis Software. Reynolds, a designer and programmer, and Briggs, director of product development at MicroProse, were instrumental in developing MicroProse's Sid Meier brand of strategy and sim ulation games --COLONIZATION CIVILIZATION and Civ II. RAILROAD Tycoon, and F15 STRIKE EAGLE. The new company, based in Hunt Valley, MD, will maintain Meier's traditional focus on strategy games, according to Briggs. Meier adds that, \"we're known for moving forward with each game, not just repeating the old ones. We want to create innovative new products, even while staying with the strategy genre.\" The new company will consist of a small, \"handpicked group of programmers, musicians, artists, and design: ers, to be assembled around the designing and programming core of Reynolds and Meier. MicroProse, acquired four years ago by Spectrum HoloByte, has been beset by financial problems for several months. During the summer MicroProse laid off nearly half of its staff, of which 30 employees were from the Hunt Valley, MD, division. In late June the compa. ny obtained foreign investment to remain listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. CEO Stephen M. Race said the company had \"negative tangible net worth,\" and had to seek an infusion. Meier has agreed to work with Micro Prose as a consultant until the completion of Magic: THE GATHERING, (projected to release this fall).

After that, Activision will no longer have rights to the MechWarrior property. Spectrum HoloByte purchased the license and is currently planning MECHWARRIOR 3. But Spectrum will not be developing the game; they will go to Virtual World Entertainment and BattleTech creators, FASA, for that. Virtual World Entertainment created the location-based BattleTech virtual reality game. Now, it is officially merging with the FASA Corporation, creators of the Battle Tech Universe upon which MECHWARRIOR 2 is based. The resulting new company, called FASA Interactive Technologies, will design MECHWARRIOR 3. FASA Interactive will port the Virtual World BattleTech engine to the PC and use it as the MECHWARRIOR 3 engine. And since the guys behind the MECHWARRIOR 3 storyline will be the originals--the FASA Corporation itself-We can expect even more intensive storylines and great mis. sions that are consistent with the Battle Tech universe.

Hercules has been king in DOS performance, with their STINGRAY 64 VIDEO product, and it looks like the king may be dethroned by yet another Hercules product. The DYNAMITE 128 uses the new Tseng ET-6000 chip and a new DRAM technology, multibank DRAM (MDRAM), to move vast amounts of data very quickly. The result is a PC Bench 9.0 graphics harmonic score of over 10,000 the fastest we've ever seen, even on a Pentium 166. The frame rate of games like ATF can definitely benefit from this kind of data rate. In addition, the DYNAMITE 128 is no slouch in Windows, coming within a hair of the Matrox MILLENIUM in Windows benchmarks.

The first 3D fighting game to allow movement along the z-axis, TOSHINDEN let you dodge left and right, and applied a lot of panning to emphasize the 3D graphics. Yet, underneath all the glitz was a mediocre fighting game that true fighting fans soon ditched. Well, as we look at the PC version, all the graphics in TOSHINDEN PC suffer a lot of pixelation, blocky polygons and low resolution. Moreover, the frame rate seems to have taken a slight hit as well. The heads of characters, which in PlayStation TOSHINDEN were composed of many shaded polygons, now are single rectangles with poor textures mapped on. The 3D effects, such as the z-axis movement and panning camera, are still here but they can't begin to make up for the sloppy visuals.

The purchase is guaran. teed to have a value in excess of $13.5 million and is subject to a due diligence review and regular closing procedures. The impending acquisition reflects 3DO'S growing involvement in the PC platform and extends its reach into the Strategy and Role Playing genre. New World Computing will continue to function as its own entity and maintain its operations and staffing in southern California; however, it will publish titles under the 3D0 Studios umbrella.

It looks and plays better than the old UMS and the interface is a tremendous improvement. The game includes four battles: Pharsalus (ancient). Austerlitz (Napoleonic), Antietam (American Civil War) and Tannenberg (World War 1). The encyclopedic treat ment of each battle is impressive, providing players with a wealth of information before they assume command. Unfortunately, the game's ability to simulate combat during any of the four time periods portrayed is lacking. Among its failings, the combat model allows units containing only a few men to inflict as much damage as they did when at full strength. Also, horrific casualty rates are the norm.

This is the basic unit you start with, and is also the only unit that can build structures and collect manna (the game's only resource, used in building structures and recruiting troops). Structures, though, can't be built just anywhere. They can only be built on Mystic Sites, and most of these are already occupied by enemy structures. This means you'll have to engage your foe and wipe out his structure before you can plant your Golem at the Mystic Site for construction. There are five different structures, and each allows up to four different types of troops. Troops can't be recruited at whim, either. You need to research them first by expending experience points, which are gained by creating Basal Golems and defeating enemy troops. The beta version we played did have a few problems. The game speed was too slow-there were no controls for speeding up gameplay and the troop Al also needed work. Another annoy. Wie ance was a high-pitched laugh that sounded each time we clicked on a new unit. While BLOOD & Magic does have a few flaws, most of which will probably be fixed, the game looks quite good. This short preview can't really do justice to the game, because there's quite a bit of complexity here.

In many cases, armed with only their critical eyes, these editors actually jumped in and tried to subdue these pre beta beasts, even though many were months from being tamed. (\"While Marlon sits back in the jeep and enjoys a nice cool drink, Jim will attempt to run this early alpha version with only 390K of free conventional memory.\") In the pages that follow, you'll find some of the most promising, most exciting, and most anticipated titles slated for release between now and the new year. Many of these aren't far enough along to give a firm estimated ship date, but if you don't see a date listed you can expect to see the program on store shelves by or before the \"well, we meant to ship it in time for Christmas\" post-holiday season. Because of the size of this herd, we've concentrated primarily on titles you haven't yet read details of in these pages. Separate safari guides are leaving now for each of the gaming genres, so strap in and get ready to pick your targets. AUGUST 1996 CG "


"ACTION UAKE Since our visit to id several weeks ago, a back story has been revealed to set the carnage in context, courtesy of id's John Romero. As a commando for the good guys, you've been briefed on a new device called a Slipgate, which can crack a hole in the time continuum, allowing time travel But there's one problem. An evil fiend, or group of fiends, called \"Quake,\" has fig. ured out how to use Slipgates as well, pos sibly in an attempt to launch a surprise invasion of Earth. Your mission: find Quake, and take him--or them--out, using any means necessary. While you embark on your hunt, Quake pays a visit to your headquarters and turns it into a morgue. Upon returning to the grisly scene, you dis. cover that Quake has escaped through the Slipgate. Seeing that the coordinates on the Slipgate are still set to their headquarters, you teleport through the Slipgate, arriving at the Quake hideout, where your odyssey begins. QUAKE should be shipping around the time you read this. id Software/GT Interactive, (800) 601-1930, DOS ince our preview in the July issue, there have been a few additions to id's latest demonic progeny. QUAKE. The weapons are even more cruelly rendered now, for instance, the super-nailgun now has two barrels. Quake boasts levels far more elaborate than the DOOM series, and is set to challenge all comers in both single and multiplayer outings, JEDIKNIGHT: DARK FORCES IL tium. There are only 10 new levels here, but the length of gameplay will probably be the same, because each level is packed with even more cool weapons and nasty enemies. Some of the new weapons will freeze and shatter opponents, melt the flesh from their bones or literally reduce them to a pile of bones and body parts. New enemies include at least three new mechs, including a morphing mech that will lie in ambush in the form of a soda machine, table, or other mundane object. The enemy Al has also been beefed-up. Now, enemies have access to the same weapons and same moves as you, so watch out for troops who roll in and out of cover, blasting you with freezeguns. Origin/EA, (512) 335-5200, DOS BIG GAME HUNT EDI KNIGHT, the amazing-looking sequel to DARK FORCES, has all the good qualities of the original, and then some. Set in the seedier side of the Star Wars universe, our hero from DARK FORCES, Kyle Katarn, has now begun a quest to become a Jedi Knight. As his training and the game progresses, he encounters the Dark Jedi Jerec and his six Jedi lieutenants. Soon Kyle must choose whether he will join the Dark Side or serve the forces of good to battle Jerec and his minions, who wish to harness the power of an old Jedi burial ground to enslave the galaxy. LucasArts, heeding the cries of disgruntled gamers, has added multiplayer play over network, modem and direct link, and even a save-game feature. There will be new weapons-including a Light Saber-and new monsters. As a Jedi Knight in training, after you finish each level you will gain experience points and Jedi powers. JEDI KNIGHT isn't just a run-and-gun spree through level after level, since there is a cast of recurring villains as well as the possibility of branching to good or evil Jedi training. CGW saw a 3D-enhanced version of JEDI KNIGHT running on a Rendition board, and we found that the graphics in this mode look even better than Quake. Look for the game to ship in late winter.

"ACTION TOMB RAIDERS INTO THE SHADO laying Indiana Jones could be fun. Playing a mean, pistol. packing, tomb robbing \"Indiana Jane\" is probably even more fun. That's the theory behind Eidos's TOMB RAIDERS, a 3D shooter played from a behind-the-back perspective. The graphics in this game, especially in the 3Dfx version we saw, are beautiful, consisting of texture-mapped, gouraud-shaded polygons, amazing light-sourcing and full 3D effects for a breathtaking immersive world. In this shooter, you play Lara Croft, a tomb raider who is exploring various ruins around the world in search of an ancient artifact called the Scion. Her search takes her to various tombs in Peru, Egypt, Cambodia and other exot ic locales. There, you'll find clues, solve puzzles and blast away any beast or man who stands in your way. Though only in its early stage of development, this game is already noteworthy for the rough and tough female lead and the amazing graphics. The main character has thousands of frames of animation; she can run, jump, swim, ride, pull herself up onto ledges, and has incredibly fluid and realistic movement. The game is slated for a winter release. Eidos, (415) 616-2022, Windows 95 oasting a true 3D engine with impressive light sourcing and high-res graphics, INTO THE SHADOWS is a remarkable advancement over previous dungeon romps. The D&D-style action game is set in a detailed castle laced with shadows and light, where the player battles ugly denizens with a variety of medieval Weapons. Dynamic panning has been used to deepen the sense of immersion, to better effect than that seen in ALONE IN THE DARK. Although there is the usual keyand item-searching, the main focus is action: large, motion-captured characters stab, slice and clobber each other like many arcade-style fighting games. Not only are the movements fluid and realistic, but special doubling techniques create the illusion that the polygonal charac ters are more detailed than they really are. The game's graphics engine has been in development for three years, and it looks superb-if a little short on blood and gore. INTO THE SHADOWS should support up to eight players over a network. Scavenger/GT Interactive, (800) 601-1930 DOS and Windows 95 VIRTUA FIGHTER PC ECSTATICA 2 METRY JACKY CSTATICA 2, from Pysgnosis, is an action game with a heavy close of adventure elements. The environments are all pre-rendered, so movement isn't as flexible as in a polygonal world like Quake. But the graphics are highly detailed, and the character has a range of fluid, realistic moves. More so than in the original, the view. ing area changes according to what you go, and you'll sometimes play from a close-up side view, a topdown view, or even an iso metric view. ECSTATICA 2 also has a few fighting game influences, allowing you to perform special attacks like spinning slashes. The game is set in medieval times; nce again you play the young warrior from the origi nal ECSTATICA, why must battle an evil Archmage who does what evil Archmages do best threaten to destroy the universe. Psygnosis, (80) (800) 438-7794, DOS hen VIRTUA FIGHTER first hit the arcades, it revolutionized the fighting game genre with its 3D graphics and panning camera. VIRTUA FIGHTER PC, a port of the game that started the 3D fighting craze, looks poised to do the same on the PC. VFPC will 0550 have two graphics modes: the original, blocky arcade mode and an enhanced, hires texture mapped mode. All of the VIRTUA FIGHTER arcade gameplay is intact, including all eight characters, numerous special attacks, throws, ring outs, and pouncing attacks. Using DirectX, VFPC will retain a high frame rate, high polygon count and the smooth fluid motion found in the arcade version. The good news is that special 3D hardware is not required to run VFPC. However, to achieve VFPC's visual excellence, you'll need at least a Pentium 90. So, while the game will be incredible, so will the overhead. The only other quibble with VFPC is that it's not VIRTUA FIGHTER 2. Unfortunately, we'll have to wait a few more months for that one. Sega Entertainment, 415-508-2800, Windows 95 .

"ACTION DAYTONA USA his arcade racer allowed Sega to take the lead in the arcades and became the standard by which other racers were measured. Now, the same thrilling, high-speed racing of Daytona USA will be available for Windows 95 users packing a minimum of a Pentium 90. This port retains all the gameplay of the arcade classic, including four separate views, three race cours es, and end over end crashes. The graphics are nearly identical to the arcade version, and will retain most, if not all, of the original's high frame rate and polygon count. Sega Entertainment will also be adding network play to this title so that you and your friends will be able to burn rubber in a pulse-pounding race of Daytona stock cars. Daytona USA was an instant winner in the arcades, and looks qualified to place as the number one arcade racer when it hits the PC this fall. Sega Entertainment, (415) 508-2800, Windows 95 DK, the first PC game from Shiny Entertainment, the cre. ators of Earthworm Jim, looks quite promising. You play a black.clad warrior, equipped with a sniper helmet, who drops from his perch in orbit into various locations on Earth-locations infested with aliens and evil creatures. The 3D shooter has both third-person and first-person view modes. The hi-res graphics are polygonal, with good light-sourcing, making for more immersive and beautiful visuals. Players used to the usual gun-blazing shooter, though, will instead have to use their wits. MDK often requires that you use your sniper helmet to take out enemies with stealth from far away, or from an ambush position. The emphasis on stealth and ambush will make play in the multiplayer mode very interesting. Shiny is also working on making the alien creatures react more intelligently to your actions. If you shoot an alien's firearm from its hand, rather than continue to attack mindlessly, it will duck behind a wall, and then stick its hand out to search for its dropped weapon. If Shiny can actually pull off this dynamic thinking in its ene. mies, MDK could be a killer action title. Look for MDK in early '97 Playmates Interactive, (714) 562-1743, DOS M ALSO IN THE WORKS * BIG GAME HUNT long with the 3D titles mentioned above, there are several other games in development that deserve mention.

"ADVENTURE CALLAHAN'S CROSSTIME SALOON Callahan's and travel from Transylvania to Brazil to outer space and beyond in an attempt to set things straight. Because Robinson's stories tend to end in punchlines rather than deep philosophical statements, it's a great sign that Legend enlisted jokester Josh Mandel (of FREDDY PHARKAS fame) to design the game. Expect much of Robinson's groan-worthy punning to make it into the game intact. (One example: you'll be flying to Brazil on lva Raseedin Airline.). As a bonus, a number of big names are rumored to possibly be providing music for the game, including Leon Redbone and Harry Nillsonand, we just learned, Spider Robinson himself, who will sing some of the songs that originally appeared in his stories, For Callahan fans this game is a sure bet. But the uninitiated should be excited too. There's a mountain of talent at work here, making it our most-anticipated adventure game of the coming season. Legend, (703) 222-8500, Windows hink of the friendliest, happiest bar you know, and then imagine it populated by vampires, time travelers, aliensand some very drunk punsters. That's what you'll find at Callahan's Crosstime Saloon, the setting of Spider Robinson's cult classic science-fiction short stories, now being adapted as an adven. ture game by Legend Entertainment. As the game begins the fate of the universe is at hand. In six separate adventures, you'll start from THE CITY OF LOST CHTIDREN LEISURE SUIT LARRY 7: YANK HERS AWAY * BIG GAME HUNT sygnosis' The City of Lost Children is a 3D adventure game based on the 1995 French film of the same name. Though the film, created by Jean-Pierre Junet and Marc Caro (\"Delicatessen\"), only had a brief run in U.S. art houses, it was one of the best movies of 1995, and easily one of the great film fantasies of the past 20 years. A macabre yet beautiful mix. ture of Fritz Lang, Charles Dickens, Jules Verne and David Lynch, The City of Lost Children is the story of the evil scientist Krank, who, having lost the ability to dream, is kidnap. ping little children in order to steal their dreams. When a circus strongman's little brother is kidnaped, he teams up with a little orphan girl to find the lost children. Along the way they encounter everything from evil Siamese twins to a talking brain to a mind-poisoning tick. Psygnosis' game follows the same plot, in 3D-rendered sets modeled after the film sets. The movie's director, Marc Caro, is overseeing the game's design, and after seeing some of it he reportedly asked that it be made \"darker and grimier\"-a good sign indeed. Should the gameplay match the visuals, look for this to be one of the more mem. orably surreal adventure games of the year. Psygnosis, (415) 655-8000, Windows 95 ard to believe, but it's now been 10 years and six releases since Larry, that loveable loser de l'amour, first swaggered onto our computer screens to begin his hunt for female companionship. That's longer than most software franchises (and even some computer platforms), which just goes to show you....well, we don't know what exactly. Suffice it to say that Al Lowe's comic cre. ation is now that most unlikely of things-an institution. This year's model finds Larry aboard a cruise ship, the HMS Bouncy (comandeered by one Captain Thigh), in pursuit of the usual gaggle of gravity-defying babes. LSL 7 boasts new 3D animation, and Sierra is also promising \"scratch-and-sniff puzzles\" --the possibilities of which are truly frightening. Sexist and neanderthal drivel for immature guys? Of course it is. But creator Al Lowe's humor is so deliber ately, uh, broad, that as with the films of Russ Meyersthere's simply no point in being offended. Offensiveness is the point. Not a family game by any stretch of the imagination, LSL 7 will appeal to those who like their adventures laced with ribald humor and a hearty lack of taste.

THE SPACE BAR is a murder Mystery, where you play a detective interviewing bizarre crea: tures in a sort of sanitized, beautified version of the Cantina in Star Wars. Navigating through the spotless, 3D rendered environment, you come across creatures who look freshly-extruded from a disturbed Taiwanese toymak er's mold, engag. ing in strange con versations using telepathy. Oftentimes the player assumes another character's perspective, such as a large bug-eyed insect, viewing the world through multiple lenses and compelled to carry out missions in order to advance the plot.

"ROLE-PLAYING GAMES RETURN TO KRONDOR Gods has been lost by the Ishapian Church, RETURN TO KRONDOR will feature a new 3D engine from 7th Level which will enable gamers to participate in real-time combat with sev. eral different camera angles. The game will even feature shipto ship combat as your character sails the Bitter Sea. And, though it will incorporate full motion video of more than 50 non player characters, Feist says it will incorporate some of the lessons he learned from Jerry Luttrell (now at Interplay) and John Cutter (now at Starwave) when working on his Hall of Fame member and Premier-winner, Dynamix's BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR. Feist felt that the award winning game had too many mini-quests in the early going, which bogged down play and gave the impression of weak game design. RETURN TO KRONDOR, stretching over nine chapters, will have a better sense of pacing where even the mini-quests will add to the sense of climax and will add an Al routine to keep track of the player-character's actions and attitude. 7th Level, (800) 884-8863 x-126, Windows 95 th Level's RETURN TO KRONDOR is an adventure set in the world created by novelist Raymond E. Feist. It is the reign of Prince Arutha, and a religious artifact called the Tear of the BETRAYAL AT ANTARA TA and SAN TERM W features more detailed character generation (including advantages and disadvantages), richer conversational capacity, ability to own/store/display object-oriented posses sions, opportunity to WT join guilds, addition of sores lore and skill-based clues and activities, and HOTED VON KESED option of customizing HEADGET your on-screen avatar more than ever before throughout the game as opposed to only at creation). If that weren't enough, Bethesda dipped into the TSR brain trust to find a producer that has made sure that even the mini-quests add to the experience rather than forcing you to assume the role of medieval Fed-Ex courier. Bethesda (301) 926-8300, Windows 95 he members of the design team of Sierra's BETRAYAL AT ANTARA consider their product to be a spiritual descendant of BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR. When Sierra realized the mistake they had made when the former president of their Dynamix subsidiary killed the KRONDOR sequel, higher management decided to create their own intellectual property, The Antara design team recognized that they couldn't use any of Feist's world, but they set out to create a world that they believed would make Feist proud. For example, instead of having the requisite orcs, trolls and elves of many post-Tolkien fantasy worlds, they developed cultures based on anthropomorphized life forms. BETRAYAL AT ANTARA, like RETURN TO KRONDOR, also uses a new 3D engine. It also uses the most unobtrusive interface we've seen yet in a CRPG. The interface only takes up about 1/3 of the screen when max imized (with the usual character portraits and color-coded graphs) and, most of the time sits minimized at the bottom of the screen so that you can get a full-screen view of the action. Unlike RETURN TO KRONDOR, BETRAYAL AT ANTARA will feature a disguised hex-based tactical combat system. It is also a skill-based system in which characters can work on improving one-to-five skills at a time and an intricate magic system where characters can research spells by combining areas of knowledge.

The game is rife with wonderful multiplayer touches such as audio cues to indicate where the \"good guys\" are trying to dig their way into your dungeon, shadow-sourcing so that you can detect when those do gooders are trying to sneak around corners, torture rooms where you can unleash your frustration on hapless foes to glean new info, and best of all, the ability to change every parameter in the game through an Excel spreadsheet Electronic Arts (800) 245-4525, Windows 95 REALMS OF ARKANIA: SHADOWS OVER RIVA DARK EARTH overs of intricate role-playing systems are probably already familiar with Sir-Tech's REALMS OF ARKANIA: SHADOWS OVER RIVA. Based in the German role playing universe, Das Schwarze Auge (The Black Eye). the ARKANIA series features a 3D look and a rich, complex role-play ing system. The universe is very fleshed out, as readers of the kainas wines novels just released by Prima's Proteus division (The Charlatan and The Lioness, reviewed on CGW'S AOL edition) can attest. The universe has a unique pantheon, equalitarian attitude toward gender, and an intriguing mix of cultures to commend it. This incarnation also features a new tactical style of combat reminiscent of X-Com or the upcoming SUPER HEROES from MicroProse.

A combination fantasy science fiction game, DARK EARTH puts you in the role of a Guardian of Fire-literally the tender of the flame that heats the entire urban structure (Stallite) where he lives and a combination fireman/police man. The graphics make much of the juxtaposition of light vs. darkness, and the 3D sets are reminiscent of the illustra. tions for Jules Verne's novels or the sets of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. The culture is extremely robust and the game has a surprisingly agile combat system that comes close to some of the best fighting games on the market. Even the monsters are different in this game, since the design team avoided the classic monsters in favor of monstrosities mutated from the familiar flora and fauna of our world.

Like its prede. cessors, DIABLO features random dungeon con struction and object/monster/trap placement so that you never play the same game twice. Add impressive 3D characters, light-sourcing, and special effects, as well as multiplayer play on a free Internet site, and you've got an irresistable combination. (See Sneak Preview, pg. 118.)

By moving the SpaceOrb's flexible control ball with your left hand, EC's first gaming rig made a fairly respectable showing in our Ultimate Gaming Machine feature earlier this year. NEC is now coming out with a hell-bent-for-gaming rig called the Power Player, which should be shipping by the time you read this.

When ULTIMA ONLINE finally becomes a fully commercial project (right now, the beta is limited to around 150 people at a time), it will feature two types of quests: major quests and resource quests. The former will be story lines designed by a team at Origin. The latter will be determined by what characters do with the virtual resources of Britannia. For example, Lord British postulates that dragons tend to dine on cattle and sheep, since they are much tastier and easier to kill than humans. But, should the virtual humans of certain areas within Britannia decide to deplete their livestock too much, it could be that they'll see incursions against the towns by human-devouring dragons.

If you've got a modem and on-line service provider, just click on the bat tle.net button to jump onto the service. TCP/IP Internet access is required for the connection, and gamers will still have to pay their Internet Service Provider for the connect time. Blizzard, though, will not charge a fee for its service.

Battle.net will be accessible 24 hours a day to gamers throughout the world. DIABLO will be the first game playable on the service. There is no practical limit to the number of DIABLO games that can be played, though each game can only have a maximum of four players.

"SIMULATIONS F-22 LIGHTING IN LIGHTNING I. This freshman simulation from the producers of the COMMANCHE arcade sim series has the top notch visual and sound effects you'd expect from NovaLogic, as well as an authentic flight feel that might surprise you. NovaLogic Khas worked with Lockheed to accurately model the plane's performance and instrumentation. Although F-22 promises to be a more serious\" sim than previous NovaLogic efforts, expect some compromis es in the name of gameplay. In the preliminary multiplayer mode we played, for instance, your plane is simply disabled for a period of time after being \"destroyed,\" saving you the long flight back to the battlefield. The terrain model is reminiscent of EF2000, but has a richer color palette and changes with the seasons. The texture-mapped aircraft are among the best looking we've ever seen. Look for the full scoop in next month's CGW. Novalogic; (800) 858-1322; Win 95 he Lockheed Lightning II is promising to soon become as ubiquitous as the F-16 Fighting Falcon in the sim world. Helping this trend along will be Novalogic, with F-22 BIG GAME HUNT TEX 3: LIGHTNING STRIKE FX 3 builds on the foundation of Ocean/DID's EF2000, but this sequel puts you in the cockpit of the ubiquitous F-22 The new version of the WarGen dynamic campaign generator promises multiple scenarios and changing political and tactical alliances. Sim pilots will now be given full control of mission planning, as well as the ability to man an AWACS control screen to direct aircraft and evaluate the tactical situation. DID is research ing many of the advanced systems under consideration for inclusion in the EF2000's cockpit, which should lead to a very user-friendly control environment without sacri ficing realism. The aircraft are now texture-mapped, and the terrain looks even better here than in EF2000, thanks to enhancements such as dynamic lighting and shadowing that changes as time passes. Desert missions should be a little less gloomy than the fjords of the first game, and there's more of an emphasis on maritime warfare here. Serial and modem play will be included, and net play should support more than eight human pilots. TFX 3 should arrive this winter. Ocean/DID: (800) 289-1411; Win 95 The flight model promises to be as impressive to today's fliers as FALCON 3.0's was six years ago. Cockpit systems have been fine-tuned to better compensate for the limitations of a computer monitor: along with the traditional full instrument panel, you can fly with just the HUD and superimposed MFD displays. The avionics are much more advanced, with new details such as HARM targeting systems. At this point it looks like the original FALCON 3.0 padlock view may give way to a BACK TO BAGHDAD-style floating target box, a move sure to upset FALCON purists. FALCON 4.0's designers plan to model a million square miles of Korean terrain. Although the very early demo we saw showed obvious texture-map tiling, the overall effect was dazzling, especially on the version that took advance of the 3DFX graphics board. You should have more control over resources in the air and on the ground here. MicroProse promises significant enhancements in multiplayer play. The one promise the company won't make is a ship date-first half of 1997 is as close as it will commit. MicroProse; (800) 879-PLAY; Win 95 FALCON 4.0 he much-awaited FALCON 4.0 may finally be coalescing from the vapor. At the recent E3 show, an early demo version of this F-16C Block 50 sim featured some amazing FLIGHT UNLIMITEDstyle digitized terrain graphics and head-to-head play. What we saw was more a technology demo than even an Alpha version, however. EUROPEAN AIR WAR he upcoming EUROPEAN AIR WAR will be a welcome respite to the recent drought of historic flight sims. This sequel to 1942: THE PACIFIC AIR is reminiscent of its predecessor in CG AUGUST 1996 "


"SIMULATIONS A2 ABRAMS ver notice how in a lot of modern-era games, technology for the bad guys stops around 1990, while all the cool U.S. equipment is readily available? Well, such isn't the case here, as designer Arnold Hendrick (co-designer with Sid Meier of several classic MicroProse games) has done his homework to include all the latest Ukranian, Russian, and other former Soviet Bloc weaponry. The flashpoints include the U.S. intervening in a Russian/Ukranian conflict, as well as fighting in the Middle East, with scenarios tied together by a branching campaign. All the high-tech toys you expect are included for these armored behemoths: infrared sights, wire. guided anti-tank missiles, even BMPs and the occasional infantry squad. The views from the tank were still pretty rough at press time, but at least you can tell a tree from a tank al 100 yards (unlike, say, ARMORED FIST). Alond ARMORE LASER SABO structure and general feel, but the improved SVGA simulation engine does a much better job of pulling you in to the experience. Along with the improved terrain and aircraft, the cockpit instrumentation is now much more readable-it should now be useable even in virtual cockpit mode. As with its predecessor, you'll be able to fly over 20 fighter and attack aircraft, but bombers are off-limits. Depending on which side you choose to fly for, you'll escort or attack formations of B-17s as the Allies inch into German territory. Up to 32 planes will be in the air at once, a big improvement over earlier sims, but only a taste of the action that occurred in the gigantic WW II bomber formations. A mission film recorder will allow you to review your performance. MicroProse; (800) 879-PLAY; MS-DOS SALO Raki 19 SABOT 20 HEAT 7 STAFF 7 Ph 11400 COAX BEG Za ACAINME . THEPA  HOLARI LAGNICATION CA RANGE SELECT G ORE MIA Overall, this is a game that prizes substance over style. If you're tired of blowing the dust off that old copy of M1 TANK PLATOON, this new tank sim might just re-align your treads. Interactive Magic; (919) 461-0722; Win 95 F/A-18 HORNET 2.0 The popular Mac simulation will come to Win 95 in early fall with a number of enhancements. These include a highly accurate force vector flight model and improved graphics with support for resolutions up to 1024x768. You'll fly carrier and land-based fighter and attack missions in the Navy and Marines' pre mier strike fighter, against a variety of targets in three theaters of operation. If you're not too good at hitting ground targets, you can always drop one of the available nuclear weapons. However, a more civil response would be to take advantage of FIA-18 HORNET 2.0's classroom training guide, designed by an active duty Naval aviator. Graphic Simulations, (214) 386-7575; Win 95 ALSO IN THE WORKS nteractive Magic will be jumping on the F-22 bandwagon: look for a preview next issue, Novalogic has redesigned the Voxel Space technology to support high-res, clouds, and numerous other improvements, and the early copies we saw of COMMANCHE 3 and ARMORED FIST 2. were dazzling.

"SPACE SIMULATIONS STAR TREK: STARFLEET ACADEMY ENCUEPTI Shatner, George Takei, and Walter Koenig reprise their roles as Kirk, Sulu, and Chekov and act as your Academy instructors. Portions of the game take place on the ground at the Academy, where you'll interact with other cadets and deal with academy internal politics, and probably a mystery or two. But the real action takes place on the bridge, where you'll command your crew in diplomatic and research missions, as well as in combat scenarios against 180 different types of starships. The combat looks true to the Star Trek \"battleship duel\" style, rather than the goofy crosshair-based phaser wars found in earlier Interplay Trek games. Even more exciting is the network play mode, basically a starship vs. starship melee. Take the helm of the Enterprise, a Romulan Bird of Prey, a Klingon battlecruiser, as well as Gorn, Tholian, and other ships in space combat. Beautiful light sourced polygon graphics will add to the pleasure of photontorpedoing your enemies to death. This game will hopefully beam in before Christmas. Interplay: (714) 553-6655; MS-DOS, Win 95, Power Mac, Playstation inally, a game that lets us boldly go where we've been wanti: ing to go the whole time: on an interstellar journey in the command chair of the Starship Enterprise. Actually, STARFLEET ACADEMY puts you at the helm of an Enterprise simulator, as you work through 27 missions that include battles, diplomacy, and the fabled \"no-win scenario,\" the Kobyashi Maru. William X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER ither you loved TIE FIGHTER and X-WING so much that you've played the games and the mission disks all the way through. or you quickly tired of the LEMMINGS-like puzzle elements of the popular space sims. Either way, you're itching for a new and differ. ent Star Wars experience. X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER should fit the bill nicely no matter which camp you're from, because this multiplayer entry in the Star Wars series lets you engage real human players in space dogfights. Both modem and net play will be possible, there are also some solo missions designed primarily as practice for the multiplayer action. You can fly for Imperial, Rebel, or Pirate teams, and you'll have over a dozen kinds of starfighters to choose from. If your side is short on players, you can command multiple computer-flown wingmen (and jump into their cockpits if your own ship is destroyed). An enhanced graphics engine adds texture maps taken directly from Lucasfilm's Star Wars archive to the ships, dramatically enhancing the look of this fall, 1996 game.

That's exactly what happened at E3 this May when we saw a preview of Electronic Arts' upcoming NHL Hockey 97. EA already set a new standard for hockey games with the '96 version, but, happily they're not letting this title get fat and lazy on the player's bench. Instead, the '97 version constitutes a major graphic facelift, with awesome, realistic 3D polygonal players based on motion.captured moves from Tom Pederson of the San Jose Sharks.

GTE's NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL looks like a winner that will bring some much-needed col. lege hoops action to the PC. The game will include 64 Division 1 teams along with their home courts, colors and even mascots. More importantly, the statistical model of each team is based on each college's hoop history as well as the playing style of the current coaches. We especially like the recruiting aspect of the game: pre-season Morsal Normalt checked this game out at E3, hoping to be able to mock it for this roundup, but were stunned to see that it wasn't as lame as we were hoping-not at all. Along with the now standard-issue motion-captured animation (which needed work), the game boasts a slick interface and, based on what we saw, not-halfbad action-ori ented gameplay. Best of all is an easily accessible and surprisingly deep playbook that diagrams each play and describes when and why you might want to use it.

"STRATEGY MASTER OF ORION II: BATTLE FOR ANTARES Fop 28, 2017710 Industrial Colony of Nyarli 151310000001 GALAXY EGYSTIH) Nyael Prime Nyar! Nvart Nyatli SIILIT the conflict and each side will have units that play differently. In WARCRAFT II, only looks, magic and a few abilities of the upgraded troops created any difference in the two sides: STARCRAFT's three different races will each have distinct advantages and disadvantages There are other improvements as well. You can group up to 12 units, and attacking from troop transports will be easier now. Instead of clicking once to unload your units, then grouping them and finally issuing a command to attack, you can now simply right click on the carrier and its fighters will disembark and start shoot. ing at the nearest enemy. There promise to be other changes to make the game more manageable and fun as well. Graphics are, of course, top-notch, and gameplay can only get better. Await this realtime winner in Winter of 1996. Blizzard, (800) 953-SNOW, DOS and Windows 95 CHANGE BU EBETURI DE STAR GENERAL ANTASY GENERAL was a good sequel to PANZER GENERAL, but STAR GENERAL will be even better. In this fourth incarnation of the GENERAL series, the venue is outer space, with both space battles between ships and land battles on planet surfaces. There will be seven races in the game, though only the human or those of you who were finally able to put Civil aside, prepare your willpower for another sleep-depriving assault. Since our sneak preview the game has undergone an SVGA facelift: but it's more than new graphics that entice. The well defined alien races are possessed of even more personality than before, and what was already the best diplomatic Alin gaming has been improved, so that those Darloks are sneakier than ever. Limitations on ship design have been lifted, and there are more tactical options in space and planetary combat. One of the few weaknesses of MOO, the tedious and confusing interface, has been totally revamped for easier navigation. Heroes make an appearance, but unlike those in MASTER OF Magic, they don't totally dominate play. And our best sources tell us that we'll finally have multiplayer for humans (or Bulrathi, or Psilons...). The closest thing this year to a sure-fire sci-fi hit-our compliments to both Steve Barcia and MicroProse for not rushing this one. MicroProse, (800) 695-4263, DOS. IES VI Battleshlo (19) Fuar Annala Expert Torget TM Current FUN 384 Max Pla mavenant Soatting Attache BRGB tax r BALE STARCRAFT ERRA * BIG GAME HUNT aking a temporary hiatus from AZEROTH, the talented folks at Blizzard have decided to venture into the final frontier for their next real-time foray. In the endless debate between real-time and turn-based strategy titles, Blizzard's WARCRAFT II has always been held up as the right step in real-time wargaming. STARCRAFT, of course, will be better. Not much of the back story is known, but what we do know is that there will be three sides to player is available in the campaign. There will be mini-campaigns, though, for each race, which gamers will be able to play. Unlike the previous games, there will be network, modem and direct link play, as well as play by email. For multiplayer games, players can choose any of the seven races. STAR GENERAL's interface will be a little better, with the addition of the split screens. In FANTASY GENERAL, when you opened up a unit-purchase screen or looked at a unit, the non-combat screen would cover up the combat screen, meaning you couldn't look at your units and check out the enemy stats at the same time. In STAR GENERAL, non-combat screens are only half-screen size, so they won't obscure the combat view. There will be six levels to each unit, depending the level of technology you possess, and terrain and celestial bodies will figure significantly in gameplay (watch out for the black holes). Prepare to be blown away by the best PANZER GENERAL sequel yet. Coming this winter. SSI/Mindscape, (800) 601-7529, DOS and Windows 95 CG AUGUST 1996 "


"STRATEGY BOL AGENTS OF JUSTICE: SUPER HEROES magine the old paper RPG CHAMPIONS finally emerging from the head of Jack Kirby, but with more emphasis on a tactical combat system reminiscent of X-Com, and featuring the strategic network of secret agents from ROCKET RANGER. AGENTS OF JUSTICE is all this, and more-because it takes vigilantes in bizarre costumes quite seriously, thank you. The art work is a nice cross between the classic Marvel/DC Comics and the modern \"realistic\" comic styles. The super powers-energy blasts, leaping buildings, invisibility, enough strength to make Arnold cry in his Austrian beer-cover the gamut of comic book fantasy. Best of all, since the villains and their insidious plots vary with each new game, there's always another reason to don your cape and cowl for another night of costumed heroism. Kryptonite shake, anyone? MicroProse, (800) 695-4263, DOS. TOTES POLE NA DIN EWINN OLKY MAININ CONES WIN WIN SPOLEN UND BOTTEN CLELLL RED ALERT OMMAND & CONQUER has been running neck-and-neck with WARCRAFT II for the title of most popular real-time strategy game, and RED ALERT looks poised to follow STARCRAFT closely into the next level of real-time gaming. The premise is a World War II that never happened. Hitler never came HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC II he goal of the designers at New World Computing is to make everything bigger for HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC II. The original was a great strategy game, with RPG elements, a good magic system, exploration and tough AI. HEROES I will keep all that, but add a lot more for a better, more consistent game. Now, the campaign will have more continuity, as you choose to champion either the good or evil side and then vanquish the enemy forces. Cut scenes will hopefully advance the story between scenarios in the campaign, and victory or failure in one scenario will affect what hap. pens in the rest of the campaign. Aside from the welcome and more integrated campaign, HEROES I will have two new classes: the Wizard and the Necromancer. The Wizard will have more fantastic units, like halflings, while the Necromancer will command undead. There will also be more spells and a new level to the mage guild.

There will be a more consistent cam paign here than in either the WARCRAFT Or C&C lines; you'll be able to carry forces from mission to mission, so if you upgrade a few partic. ularly nasty troops, you can take them with you into the next battles. There will also be a few RPG elements: magic items and other good ies will be sprinkled over the mission maps for explorers to take, and rather than being an abstract commander, you will now be a leader who gains in stats, such as prestige. The more prestige you have, the more heroes will come to join your campaign. All the great gameplay X-COM: THE APOCALYPSE he Big Question: Will the tactical combat in X-Com: THE APOCALYPSE be turn-based or real-time? Well...it's both. The developers hope this will enable them to build on the brand loyalty of X-COM while simultaneously moving into C&C and WARCRAFT II territory. Certainly they needed to try something other than simply pumping up the hit points of the aliens, as in X-COM: TERROR FROM THE DEEP. This newest invasion from afar sports even neater alien grenade explosions, scouts crawling around sewer pipes, etc. But it seemed as if the flow of the tactical module was designed first for real-time, then had turn. based play retro-fitted to keep X-Com vets from revolting. Also, the idea of setting the game in a future metropolis where you search for aliens in human form looks, at least for now, more like X-Files than X-Com. When we asked why they didn't let you play from the alien side, they wondered why anyone would want to. Moreover, the final assault on the alien home world (it isn't in the game yet) sounds even more anti-climactic than the ending of the first X-COM. Where are Scully and Mulder when you need them?

Almost As 3D graphics and video begin to converge, the idea of 'interactive video' might really become viable. LAB NOTES AUGUST 1996 CC 99 "


"LOYD CASE all video codecs on PCsuse some form of lossy compression. 19010NHOI FROM SMALL BEGINNINGS One of the early attempts to put video on PCs was Apple's Quicktime technology from the Macintosh side. But Quicktime never really took hold in the Intel world, mainly because Microsoft decided it wanted to go its own way, and developed Video for Windows (V/W for short). Some of the early releases of VW exhibited very poor quality. but things have since gotten much better. There are a host of codecs available for Windows, including Microsoft's Video l and RLE compression (neither are particularly good), Cinepak (from Radius, and originally developed for Quicktime) and Intel Indeo. The latest twist in the codec game comes in the form of Quicktime VR and Intel Indeo Interactive. Indeo Interactive is interesting, because it fcatures branching video streams and video sprites, allowing video to respond faster to user input. Certainly some Windows games use standard Video for Windows files and tech nology (CIVILIZATION II being an example). However, things never remain the same. and Microsoft has announced its Active Movie technology, which will sit on top of the Direct Draw API. At the heart of Active Movie is the MPEG-1 (Motion Pictures Fxperts Group) codec, which can deliver fairly high-quality, full-screen video. MPEG is a lossy compression system, and is also assymetric, meaning that it takes longer to compress than decompress. On today's fast Pentium, an MPEG-I file can be decompressed in software delivering respectable frame rates. Only a couple of years ago, MPEG playback required dedicatel hardware. Interestingly, however, many games are not delivered with freely available codecs. For one thing, most DOS games couldn't use VIW, and had to implement some thing else. Companies like Rad Software came to the rescue with a product called Smacker (Smacker video files will have an SMK extension). No one can claim that Smacker's video display quality is stellar, but it's fast and the files take up very little space. Another company getting more involved in PC games is Duck Corporation, with their Truemotion Stechnology. ZORK NEMESIS, among others, uses Trucnotion S, and the Windows 95 version of the game looks gorgeous. But why would a game developer pay to use Truemotion Swhen they can use Video for Windows for free? \"The answer lies in two areas: cross-platform development and video quality. Truemotion S runs on PCs Macs, Sega Satum and Sony Playstation. For a game developer looking to maximize their development dollars, this versatility is attractive Duck has implemented Truemotion to be a self-contained video playback engine and codec-independent of QuickTime or VW-which developers can embed in their applications. On top of that, Iruemotion S. which is a software-only scheme and looks very good, even compared to MPEG-1. HELLO DOWN THERE? linally, there's the issue of graphics cards. In the Windows environment, al least, your graphics card can have a big impact on the quality of digital video. Hardware can come to the rescue in two important areas: the first is colorspace conversion. Video color encoding differs from the standard RGB (red, blue, green) used in computer monitors and graphics cards, so there has to be a conversion from one color \"space\" to another. The second thing hardware can accelerate is scaling. When you enlarge a video clip, the pixels often get gigantic and the overall effect is pretty ugly. Newer graphics cards offer X-Y scaling-the hardware handles the scaling up of video resolution (which is fixed in the file) and interpolates between the pixels to make the image look more pleasing. So the next time you boot up a game, and notice that the animation looks a bit strange, remember that it's probably a video file you're seeing. Maybe someday-when DVD disks arrive and we're running on SuperllellaColossal Pentium Pro 900 MHZ CPUs-we'll have full screen, full resolution video on our computers. As 3D graphics and video begin to converge, the idea of interactive video might really become viable since hardware will exist to render video-like 3D worlds. Until then, we'll have to content ourselves with codeccrunched video whose image quality still isn't quite convincing, and whose interactivity-though making strides-is also less than ideal Backing up the Windows 95 Registry The Windows 95 registry is a database that contains all the information about your system, including what hardware is in your system, what software is installed and a host of other options and settings. The registry consists of two hidden files, USER.DAT and SYSTEM.DAT. Lose the registry, and your Windows 95 system is hosed. You can back up the registry using REGEDIT, but there's a better way. On the Microsoft Windows CD, in the directory AOTHER\\MISC\\CFGBACK is a program called CFGBACK. It allows you to keep up to nine different backups of the registry, all with different names More Memory Without Spending More Money If you can't free up quite enough memory under the Windows 95 MS-DOS prompt for that big DOS game, but don't want to spend $60 or so for a third-party memory manager, then you can always use MEMMAKER. Wait a minute, you say can't find it anywhere. As it tums out. MEMMAKER is squirreled away on the Windows 95 CD-ROM under the directory \"OTHEROLDMSDOS. Just copy the files into your \\windows\\command directory and type MEMMAKER at the DOS prompt. Configuring Your Default Configuration On Microsoft's web site, there's a section called \"Free Software\" (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/krnitoy.htm). One nifty little tool that's been added is a program called the MS-DOS Mode Configuration Wizard Customization Tool (or DOSWZCFG-now we know what happened to those defense department engineers), which is part of the Kernel Toys package. Despite its unwieldy name, DOSWZCFG is actually useful for gamers. If you've ever right-clicked on a DOS game icon and tried to configure its memory setting, you've probably been frustrated by the minimal entries that are added to the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC. BAT options. DOSWZCFG allows you to add lines to these default configurations. Although you're limited to adding a maximum of ten lines, with a little judicious fiddling, you'll never have to copy and paste from a configuration file again. AUGUST 1996 "

On the software side, Destination ships configured with Windows 95, and comes with a mess o' multimedia titles, and some game titles ranging from so-so (THE HE) to good (YOU DON'T KNOW JACK). Installation was fairly straightforward, with a large, step-by-step manual to guide you through the process. You'll definitely want to conscript several burly friends to help schlep the monitor unless you're really fond of hernias. If you get the Hammon-Kardon audio system, you'll need some wire-strippers as well to cut and strip the speaker cabling. Some of Destination's noteworthy features include an Interactive TV Guide where, with a subscription, you can download the weekly TV Guide via modem for quick reference. Double-clicking on a running TV program's entry in the Guide will take you immediately to that program. You can also set reminders that a certain program is coming on. Yes, you can run your VCR into the Destination since it has two video inputs, but unfortunately, there's no way to interface the Interactive TV Guide and your VCR's programning features, so you'll still have to face the dreaded task of manually programming the VCR. Since the TV viewer is a Windows 95 application, you can run it full-screen or size the 'IV picture so you can pretend to do work while watching Love Boat reruns. continued on page 115 >>>> VOLAN BURSA HEBIETEN CG AUGUST 1996 "

"REVIEW . DIAMOND STEALTH 3D VS. HERCULES TERMINATOR 3D 19010NH)31 On The VIRGE Testing The New Hercules And Diamond VIRGE 3D Boards by Loyd Case fter much anticipation, game-oriented 3D graphic accelerators are finally beginning to hit the streets. I had the opportunity to take a close look at two cards, both based on the S3 VIRGE 3D accelerator, both with 2 MB of video memory (the same brand and speed of memory chips, no less) and both shipping with some titles that take advantage of the onboard 3D acceleration only time and titles will tell. The first wave of ViRCE-based cards will have 2 MB of EDO DRAM onboard, and will not be expandable. Although the VIRGE's specs call for potential expansion up to 4 MB, the initial product offering only supports 2 MB. This lack of expandability may have some ramifications for gameplay and performance. Most DOS games (and even Windows games) these days will typically run at 640x480. But if the game needs to have a lot of textures loaded into the video memory, there's not enough memory left over for double-buffering, a technique for fast, 3D frame-rate performance. It's likely that we'll see resolution scaled down a bit (512x384 is the \"sweet spot\" here), but color depth can be increased to 16-bit (65,530 colors), which is far better than the old DOS VGA standard. We did have one minor problem installing the DirectX drivers. (DirectX is the Microsoft software interface for fast Windows games.) Initially, the installation failed, but a quick perusal of the readme file uncovered problems installing from the CD. A quick copy to a floppy, then using the floppy as the installation medium, solved the problem, Although Hercules hadn't released their PowerDrive Windows drivers when we tested the card, they did ship us their version of the S3 ViRCE driver set. Ona P166, the Terminator 64 racked up fairly fast Winbench 96 scores (see table 1). DOS performance was a cut above past S3 clips, and about on par with the Matrox Millenium in VGA. terminalul 154/3D THE VIRGE: BOLTING ON 3D As we noted in last month's 3D technology overview, the S3 ViRCE is based on the Trio64V+ chip, which is used in a number of multimedia accelerators, including those from Diamond and Hercules Terminator 64/3D Estimated Street Price: $219 Hercules Technologies, Fremont, CA (800) 532-0600 http://www.hercules.com Reader Service #: 318 THE HERCULES TERMINATOR 64/3D A few years ago Hercules stumbled into the game market by shipping graphics cards that had very fast DOS performance. Word spread through the gaming community, and Hercules began to reali ce how important the game market was to their success. The 'Terminator 64/3D is Hercules' first entry into the soon-to-becrowded 3D accelerator market. \"The Terminator 64/3D has 2 MB of single-cycle, EDO DRAM on board. Like most of the new 3D graphics accelerators, it's bundled with a set of software, but Hercules hadn't determined which titles to bundle when we reviewed the card. Installation was pretty straightforward. If you're running Windows 95, you bypass the \"New Hardware Found\" message and run the Terminator 64/3D sctup program, which installs the Windows drivers, and the Hercules Touch 95 utility for managing refresh rates and changing the resolution and color depth. DIAMOND STEALTH 3D 2000 Diamond has taken the ViRCES parentage as a 'Trio64V+ to heart, and has essentially built a replacement for their own Stealth Video 2201 card. The card looks very similar to the 2201, including connectors for the IV tuner and MPEC decoder. The only difference is the use of single-cycle, EDO DRAM. Installation was the casiest we've seen, following all the conventions for Windows 95. When you boot Windows 95, you'll sce a message box saying a \"PCI VGA compatible adapter has been found.\" Just click on the \"Install new driver,\" point to the correct directory on the Stealth 3D installation CD, and Windows 95 handles the rest. If you're installing for Windows 3.1, make sure that Windows is in VGA mode before running Diamond's install program. One minor annoyance was installing DirectX, which requires you to run the setup utility inside the DirectX clirectory on the CD, an adclitional step not handled by the installation process. Diamond bundles DESCENT 2: DESTINATION QUARTZON and 2000 Stealth 3D a fairly speedy chip in Windows and even has respectable, although not stellar, DOS performance. Although the ViRCE has all the features that game designers would want to use, there is a worry that the 3D acceleration may bog down when many of the features are turned on. The ViRCEs feature set includes perspective-corrected texture maps, MIP mapping of textures, bilinear filtering, 2 buffering, alpha blending and fog effects. Unforlumately, the few 3D games around don't make extensive use of all features, so Carolyn Graph DIAMOND Diamond Stealth 3D 2000 Estimated Street Price: $199 Diamond Multimedia, San Jose, CA (800) 468-5846 http://www.diamondmm.com Reader Service #: 317 CG AUGUST 1996 "

The events through forging the ring are on CD I; the remainder, starting with the journey to Lyonesse, are on CD 2. Guess what? No sooner have you begun on CD 2. then you have to turn around and go back to Camelot, which is on the first CD. Why? Why set up a situation that makes you switch from 1 to 2, and then immediately back to l again? And this after having sat through a long automated sequence, too, Adding to the dreariness is a distinct lack of period flavor, of any of the excitement and adventure associated with Arthurian legends and the Knights of the Roundtable. Along with several teeth-grinding anachronisms, and a Merlin who looks more like a weightlifter than a Druid, this did not in any way seem like the glory days of knighthood and chivalry. The save game feature leaves much to Ise desired. You have only six slots for save positions. As cach save takes less than 20K, there is no reason to be so chcap. Worse, there is no description allowed for the saves. You click on a slot, and a small picture of where you are is all you get. Since you can easily have two or more saves in the same spot, but at different limes in the game, you luve to keep track of the saves on your own. Overall, CHRONICLES OF THE SWORD is a mediocre product at best, a mechanical exercise in \"find the hot spot\" and simple puzzles, with Nawed design and little in the way of \"when knighthood was in flower.\" Anyone wanting a taste of the real thing is better off reading Le Mort d'Arthur. CHRONICLES OF THE SWORD Hints  In some instances, you can miss an object because it's in a very dark part of the screen; while in other circumstances, you may well miss an exit to another screen that has what you need. The \"hot spots\" are far from consistent. Sometimes, they cover a generous area. and sometimes the area is narrow, so be patient. (And you thought the days of \"look for the hidden pixel\" were over!) It's likely you'll have trouble with the dragon egg, for instance. It's hard to see that the exit to the next wave is a small hot spot at the extreme right of the screen (even I missed it the first time). At the Skull Bridge, to avoid a similar problem, don't bypass the necessary pole two screens back; it is extremely difficult to see on the dark screen, among all the other poles. AUGUST 1996 "

VCR picture quality was better, but we did see some aliasing (aggies\") during close-up viewing caused by the Brooktree's video scaler chip. I lowever, the aliasing lccame much less noticeable when viewing from more typical distances. Destination's monitor has a maximum resolution of 800x600, though you probably wouldn't want to squint at tiny fonts displayed at 1024x768. A9 010 NH211 28.4 allows two jovsticks to be connected. But we found that one of the connections clic n't work at all, and the other didn't provide a CH Flightstick Pro with full functionality. The Flightstick Pro's hat switch didn't work correctly in DOS, and the stick didn't work at all in Windows 95 when connected through this extension cord. Rumning direct solved the problem, but it defeated the purpose of the cord. Now the good news: Destination turned in some good WinBench numbers, though graphics performance was pretty sluggish (see table). I DOS, Destination did well running EF-2000, LONGBOW, and DUKE NUKEM 3D, delivcring smooth frame rates, and playing YEAH, WHAT ABOUT GAMES? For the gamer, Cateway didn't quite put all the finishing touches on the Destination. We had to manually configure the DOSSTARTBAT file so that realmode drivers for the CD-ROM, mouse, and sound card would be there for playing DOS titles in MS-DOS Mode. And though Cateway provides several batch files for setting up the STB sound card's Sound Blaster emulation, they're too many in number, and not necessarily intuitive. Also Destination's mixer applet las confusing labels on ils controls that don't clearly indicate what they're controlling, For example, there are redundant faders that control Wave audio output. Destination's wireless controls are a great idea, and work pretty well most of the time. Both the keyboard and the Field Mouse can control the TV tuner, enabling spousal remote control duels. . Rather than using infra-red, which requires line-of-sight alignment of transmitter and receiver, Destination's controls use radio-frequency signaling. The controls didn't quite require line-of-sight, but they did get sluggish at times when they weren't aligned in sight of the receiver. The keyboard's track-pad mouse control and the remote control's roller-ball are good for little more than menu navigation in action titles, but Gateway did put a PS/2 mouse-port on the keyboard whicre you can attach a regular mouse, though they didn't include one. Destination doesn't ship with rechargeable batteries for the keyboard and Field Mouse, though they would be a welcome addition. as would a recharger. For joystick users, Gateway provides a six-foot 15-pin \"extension cord,\" which configuration that shouldn't have been necessary. Cateway's other problem is that all of their business is through mail-order, sothe Destination might be a tough sell because of its cual role as computer and home entertainment system. Most home entertainment equipment buyers want to go into a store and bang on the box before they buy it. Sony announced at PC Expo that they're getting into the personal computer market and, given their established presence in the AW retail channel, they're a natural to develop a Destination-like system. Other players are almost certain to bring out similar systems, though we've beard no announcements to date. So while others are scheming. Destination is here now Another concern is the glaring absence of any 3D graphics hardware. And because of the integraled IV tuner, Cateway's only option with this configuration is a 3D-only solution, though no such plans were amoumced at press time. In summary, Destination will get you most of the way there, leaving you to lighten the last few screws. The 31-in. monitor and beefy audio system can really take action games to another level, and though its TV-specific components and controls weren't the best, they get the job donc. If you've got a hankering for a really big picture and thundering audio and aren't afraid to shell out major cash-vou may have a date with Destination MISSION CONTROL: Destination's keyboard and Field Mouse are ideal for the couch-inclined. these titles on a 31-in. monitor with big stereo sound was pretty exhilarating. One sour note here:FLICHT UNLIMITED crashed repeatedly. And because we couldn't resist, we put in a network card and ran the QUAKE Deathmatch (repeatedly), and again Destination delivered. In Windows 95, MECHWARRIOR 2. which uses DirectDraw,ran very smoothlv. and here again, the big picture and big sound really make the game that much more visceral. APPEAL: Home theater and gaming enthusiasts who want a PC they can drive from the couch. PROS: Big picture, great audio with optional amplifier, speedy performance running DOS games. CONS: Gamers will have to contend with some annoying rough edges. Not for the financially impaired. THE BIG PICTURE Gateway has gotten a lot right with Destination, though its irksome rough edges made for a fair amount of manual AUGUST 1996 "


"SCORPIA SCORPIA'S MAIL Get A Clue ADVENTURE/RPG The Queen of Arachnids Decrypts Those Puzzles For You ell, the mail sacks were overflowing this month, so let's jump right in! ANVIL OF DAWN: There are two ways over the chas: by going through Gorge Keep or by way of the Elder Tree. It doesn't especially matter which route you take, although if you go the 'Tree route, Corge Keep becomes superfluous. It has nothing important, except mb experience if you need some However, if you cross by the tree and enter the Keep by the back coor, do not operate the winch. Early versions of the game have a bug that will prevent you from leaving by rear exit again, and you'll have a very long walk to the tree to get back over the chasm. DARK SEED 2: Those who have managed to get into the back room of the Morgue (cheery place) are having a bit of difficulty in obtaining the key from around the corpse's neck. This is an instance (one of many in the game) where conversations with the right people can help a lot. Thic carnival is the place for the answer here. Especially for seeing double and looking into the future. When you've taken care of that, getting the key won't be a puzzle. EYE OF THE BEHOLDER II: A number of people have asked about the night mare level,\" where the party can't rest. Sorry to say, it's true: there just isn't any place down there where it's safe to sack out. Once you enter the level (preferably at max health and spells), you must go through the entire thing as quickly as possible (with plenty of saves!), and with as little damage to the party as you can manage. There is no other way. Fortunately, this is the only time you have to worry about being unable to rest in the game. CABRIEL KNIGHT 2: Some of you are having a hard time getting into the basement of the Hunt Club. The key to the door is, if course, in the desk, but how to get rid of Xaver? You'd be cuckoo to try for the keys while he's around. So I guess you'll just have to plant something in the vicinity, and hope for the best. I HAVE NO MOUTH: Gorrister (and a few adventurers) are having some difficullies in landing the airship safely. Just ripping open some of the gas bags isn't quite enough, as they've found out the hard way (hich). A little sabotage is called for here. You have to gum up the works only there's no gum, so it's time to think of something else. RIPPER: Decrypting Catherine's journal can be a problem for a number of people. First, you won't find the key until Act II of the game. Second, it isn't in a very likely spot; you could casily look at the word and not realize what it is. So, as you read various items in Act II, keep in mind that you want something astrological, no matter where you see it. SHANNARA: Some folks may be having a little trouble healing up King Menion in Leah. Most of the ingredients are easy enough to come by, but the cloves are another matter. They don't seem to be around anywhere. Remember that cloves are a spice, and sometimes spices are used as air fresheners. STONEKEEP: Here's a handy tip for those times when you don't want to get up close and personal with some of the critters: throw arrows! My friend Petra Schlunk (whose work you've seen right here in these pages) told me about this, and it works amazingly well. The arrows are much better than rocks, and kill monsters faster. Once you've gathcred a few, try it out for yourself, I think you'll like the results. For those who haven't started this game, or haven't gone too far with it yet, there's a terrific easter egg, right at the beginning. When you're standing at the lever to open the door, pull it three times in a row. Turn around, step into the hall, and go around the comer left. About three or four walls down, on the left side, is a panel. Pulling the switch there opens a secret passage behind you. In the passage, on a left wall as you enter, is another panel. Behind that is a very powerful dagger, that will make most of the carly (and even not-soearly) combats much easier. Note, however, that this weapon is available only if you have not yet gone down the stairs! On u've enteredI Stonekeep proper, the dagger is lost to you (my thanks to Roe Adams).

Role-playing games have been pretty bad these past few years. In fact, CGW could only find two RPGs to nominate for the 1995 Premier Awards, and we had to do a lot of digging. The good news, though, is that the drought will end soon. This fall, a host of great RPGs will be coming to the PC, some of them sequels like RETURN TO KRONDOR, and some of them incredible originals Leading the renaissance is Blizzard, the folks who brought you WARCRAFT II, who will be taking the plunge into the shallow waters of RPGs with their first role-playing game, DIABLO. Due for a September release, DIABLO is an action-oriented RPG that is beautiful, full of depth and yet SO WHAT'S THE STORY? As of this preview, Blizzard had yet to create a back story to DIABLO. What is known so far is that your village and family have been annihilated by a clemon called Diablo, whose foul presence has unleashed a horde of evil upon the world. Your quest is lo venture into his lair, battle THE REAL DIABLO All those red demons you've seen his minions and vanquish before aren't Diablo, they're his minions. Here's a first him. As with any good RPC, look at Diablo himself, and he is one mean sucker. many mini-quests will pop up along the way which you are fully accessible to non-traditional gamers. free to solve or ignore in any Many have been waiting for this game order you choose with bated breath, and now that we've Before you begin, though, you must had a chance to play the alpha, we are choose your alter-ego. There are no altertoo. nate races, only humans, but you can choose your class. Previous reports indicated that the three classes would be Warrior, Sorcerer and Archer, but Blizzard noles that the Archer class has been removed. Most game testers either favored the brute force of the Warrior or the magic of the Sorceror, and Blizzard felt that there was nothing to distinguish the Archer. He has since been replaced by a female Rogue who is fairly good in both magic and melee and possesses a few unique talents, such as a larger sight radius and the ability to detect traps and secret doors better than the other two classes. all(CHAR BD INTO THE DARKNESS DIABLO is a different RPG for many reasons.

Zombies limp slowly down corridors, the impish Fallen Ones jump up and down like the frantic little pests they are, and skeletons, when destroyed, scatter into loose bones on the floor. And because the graphics are high-resolution and clean, you can see every little detail in the creatures, not to mention the brick-by-brick textures of the walls and floor. DIABLO also employs impressive lightsourcing to create a dungeon environment that is dark and gloomy. But your character has a range-of-sight that illuminates the darkness as if he carried a torch.

"SNEAK PREVIEW . DIABLO Tic Mania ter stats menu are pretty straightforward. Best of all, each menu only takes up half of the screen, so you can switch equipment or look at your stats without clisturbing the flow of the game. Blizzard will implement a spell inventory akin to the character stats and inventory menu. The spell inventory will be divided into separate categories for spells in memory, in scrolls or in staves. Each spell will be represented by an icon, which can be dragged and dropped to your current spell selection. In this way, you can choose to either cast a spell from memory, exhaust your scrolls first or use up your magic staves. You will also be able to simply cycle through spells without having to go through the menu by hitting a hot key. ADVENTUREZ RPG REAL COMBAT DIABLO's combat is in real-time and is very action-oriented, meaning battles can get pretty frantic at times. However, just because the combat is real-time doesn't mean it's a matter of who clicks fastest. Different weapons and different monsters have to observe different speed factors. The sabre is faster than the ax, but slower than the shortstaff. If you think you'll be able to click on the mouse really fast to make yourself hit faster, think again, Every click begins a new strike, so if you keep on clicking, you'll just be interrupting your swing before your weapon connects. Also, if you get hit while taking a swing, you'll be knocked back and your attack will be interrupted. Many monsters t the time of this writing, DIABLO'S spell system was being overhauled. In an earlier version of the game, characters gained spells automatically with each level advance. But that's been changed, so that you'll start out with one or two spells and have to find the rest on your own. There will be two ways to expand your repertoire of spells: by locating spell books, which you can find in the various levels of the dungeon, or by studying at the mage guild in the town. After a period of memorization, the spell will then become available to you. Since DIABLO is in real-time, this will probably mean that once you discover a spell book, you won't be able to cast it until a certain period of time has passed. More powerful spells will, of course, also require that you be at both a certain level and have sufficient ability scores to handle the magic. You'll also be able to cast spells from items such as scrolls, rings and staves. These spells won't draw any mana from you but will use up charges from the respective item. With all the types of spells at your disposal, spell-casting could get confusing, but PALAYALLETS.

What will have you coming back to play over and over. though, is the random quest generation. Blizzard says DIABLO will have a database of 30 mini-quests, and from six to eight will be randomly generated from this pool per new game. While the quest to destroy Diablo is constant, cach individual game will be different because you could have entirely new mini-quests to complete. The biggest of Diablo's many amazing features, though, is its multiplayer support. DIABLO will support up to four peopleover a local-arca network or on Blizzard's upcoming, free \"battle.net\" gaming service, meaning you and your friends will be able to delve into DIABLO's dungeons together. Yes, you can engage in deathmatches, backstabbing your friends and stealing their treasure, but, even better, you'll be able to quest through the whole game together as one party, mixing character classes and teaming up on the bosses and tough monsters along the way, until you all face down Diablo together. This is really one of Diablo's most exciting selling points, bringing back the interaction that has thus far only been found on true tabletop RPGs. DIABLO will be the first stand-alone RPG to offer gamers a chance to roam a dungeon with a friend and collectively hack evil minions to death, just like in a classic Dungeons Dragons campaign session. Blizzard was very successful in mixing genres with WARCRAFT and WARCRAFT II. DIABLO, with its mix of action and roleplaying, also looks like a winning formula, Non-RPG gamers, and many action gamers in particular, are sure to feel right at home with the real-time combat, friendly interface and rich, beautiful SVGA graphics.

The game was Activision's RETURN TO ZORK, their first revival of the then-moribund Zork franchise. That game had some pronounced design weaknesses--navigation was choppy and disorienting, the scheme for communicating with other characters by clicking on \"emotion icons\" was indecipherable -but it was visually stunning and developed quite a following. So what if no one could make sense of the story? This may be the picture-postcard way of looking at things, more graphic design than game design, but heck, millions of postcards are sold every year, so it can't be a bad business to be in. For ZORK NEMESIS, Activision has kept their «pretty pictures uber alles» philosophy, but they've eliminated or smoothed over all the problem areas that made the carlier game such a chore. For instance, movement is now more fluid than before: cach location allows the player to view the surroundings in a fluid, 360-degree pan. Forward movement, from one location to another, still occurs in discrete Icaps, so this is not a Doom-style (or UNDER A KILLING MOON-style) environment that you can explore freely, but it's still a great improvement over RETURN TO ZORK As for character interaction, there isn't any.

"REVIEW . ZORK NEMESIS ADVENTURE/RPG documents -mostly personal letters from one alchemist to another, plus some diaries and books are far too numerous and mind-numbing. You sometimes find a half-dozen letters in a single room, and pretty much have to read all of them. A family saga of sorts unfolds, something about how one alchemist's daughter wanted to marry another's son, but the intricate family politics the designers try to craft misfires-you end up merely confused. Whose son is Lucicn? What is Sophia's relationship to Kaine? It's all like a particularly ornate soap opera of which you have missed the first few episodes. You're continually racing to catch up and, worse still, the nice rhythm of the gameplay stops dead whenever you run across large chunks of text to read. time to time, it's only in non-interactive to another-your heart races. video segments that play when you click The only downside to the abundance on their sarcophagi.

Almost all the objects you pick up (and there aren't a whole lot) are used on the same screen or one of the very next screens you come to.

But there is a difference between text that paints a scene or tells a story and text that merely lards on extra layers of exposition, just as there is a difference between a puzzle that challenges a player's resourcefulness or imagination and one that merely challenges his patience. ZORK NEMESIS is a pleasure to watch and has glimmering moments of promise, but a well-told story and a consistently inspired caliber of gameplay are two things it hasn't got.

"REVIEW INDIANA JONES AND HIS DESKTOP ADVENTURES DIFFICULTY LEVEL A Compact Ford ADVENTUREZRPG Indiana Jones Meets His Doom In DESKTOP ADVENTURES by Charles Ardai COX S Desktop Adventures File Options Window Help Map Gold Nugget First Aid Kit Whip or a genius, George Lucas sure has a lot of bad ideas. Howard the Duck, or Radiolund Murders, or hiring the Howard the Duck screenwriters to pen the script for Temple of Doom. When will Lucas learn to recognize a bad idea when he sees one? Not soon enough, I say. Some time ago, someone from his computer game division must have come to him and said, \"Hey, let's put out a really simple, randomly generated RPC-style adventure game, stick a whip in the hand of the main character, use the Indiana Jones name and make it look really ugly.\" And Lucas must have said, \"Sounds good to me.\" FORGET SHORTY Much like the old pop ditty, INDY'S DESKTOP ADVENTURES sounds tinny and looks out of place in today's market. DOWN MEXICO WAY INDIANA JONES AND HIS DESKTOP ADVENTURES looks like one of the carly ULTIMA games. Everything has a strange perspective, a sort of cross between an overhead and side view. Indy is a little squarish lump in a foreshortened fedora, and your main activity is moving that lump across a grid-like terrain. From time to time you come across buildings, which you enter by bumping against the doorway; the scene then switches to a blueprint-style overhead view reminiscent of the original CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN showing top-down images of walls, tables, beds, Nazis, rugs, chairs, and so forth. The setting is 1930s Mexico, so in addition to Nazis you've got bandoliered banditos and loinclothed natives to contend with, plus-aiceel-giant scorpions and spiders. Marcus Brody assigns you the inevitable quest: those bad Nazis are after a jacle jaguar mask, and you have to find it first. Also, Pacal Hunac has been kidnapped and you have to rescue him (never mind that you have no idea who he is). To get you started, here arc...a metal file, bamboo polc and a funeral mask Thanks a lot, Marcus. Then you're on your way, hunting through screen after screen of desert, forest, and jungle, dodging attacks from various and sundry meanics, in pursuit of your goal. Like the quest, the landscape is randomly generated anew each game. As you explore, you run into random fights, puzzles, and sub-quests. So, there are \"literally billions of possible games!\" as the game's package proudly proclaims. Problem is, it isn't worth playing even once or twice. 'lo fight, just point Indy in the direction of an adversary and click the right mouse button; unless the bad guy moves, he's a goner-literally. Puzzles are equally challenging.\" Abranch moves a boulder out of your path; a key opens a locked door. Subquests are a parody of customary adventure game barter: \"I'd be happy if I could be playing my favorite songs,\" says one jungle dweller, \"but I need a CUITARI your assistance would be worth a small fortune in gold DOUBLOONS.\"Fetch and carry, Indy. What else is there to do? Some of the forest scenes are maze-like, while other locations require you to pull huge stone blocks into position or push them out of your way. Some runes teleport you from one part of the map to another. You find herbs and bananas when your life meler goes from green to yellow or red. A loaling Mexican named Bonifacio dispenses gameplay lips from the town square, a barmaid named Gabriella pours tequila, and a hut dweller named Jose hands over medicinal plants with great reluctance. With these caricatures, be thankf ul that LucasArts clidn't set the game in Africa.

Where the game really falls apart, though, is in the arcade sequences. You'll start the game being attacked by drones, you'll spend the middle of the game fighting drones and you'll end the game attacking drones. You'll fight real drones, and you'll battle drones in holodeck simul ations. You'll fight drones in space and you'll fight them in ballways. Worst of all, you'll fight drones while you try to find your way through a multi-level maze. Even though the drones are convincingly integral to the plot, after a few encounters you'll late chrones. It wouldn't be so bad if the arcade sequences were fun. But at their best they're rail shooters, where you move your mouse pointer and click to destroy chones while Kira pilots your runabout. Autheir worst, they're simple duck-shoots, where you stand in hallways and point the mouse at drones as they fly in from the sides of the screen. Add to that the fact that they're poorly programmed with many dead-on shots left unregistered, and you have a very annoying game element that pops up just often enough to suck most of the fun from the game quicker than the salt vampire from Planet MII. STAR TREK BEAM ME UP It's a shame the arcade sequences are so poor and so ubiquitous, because otherwise HARBINGER is an enjoyable game. There's actually a really good story lying under the constant barrage of mouse-hand reflex tests and linear adventure quest. APPEAL: Star Trek fans, gamers who need practice hitting the icons on the Windows desktop. PROS: A great plot, original aliens, and good dialog; humor that works; beautifully rendered space station. CONS: The linear storyline has lots of searches and puzzles, but little in the way of decision making. A nearendless barrage of dull, frustrating arcade sequences mars what could be a nice adventure diversion. CC AUGUST 1996 "

You can shoot out the win12400 TUUV CREDITS 5 BULL'S EYE The game will have an unrivaled level of detail, as enemies react realistically and specifically to the spots where you shoot them. VIRTUA CITY PD something special? Well, the 3D is a huge plus: It effectively puts you into this most removed of games. You won't be able to think of anything else. Moreover, while rail shooters like CYBERIA 2 and WEILANDS like to throw vehicles into your path, here you're dealing with polygonal people. When shot, they recoil, or go down in a heap, as though they've really been shot, and sometimes go down on one knee, or hold an arm as though they've just been winged. This is personal, and that makes it compelling But what I think makes VCPD most exceptional is the methodical, very policelike way in which you progress through the levels. You don't miss the ability to move around yourself so much when the game moves much as you would-prolecting your lanks, stopping to scan the horizon for a hint of movement, waiting for the opposition's next move. Of course, the game is likely to suffer from the limitations inherent to shooting galleries. It is the same creature every time you play it. But that is a complex creature, and in some respects, the IBM version is likely to represent an improvement over the Saturn. The final version is expected to support two-player modem play, which means that you'll always have an opponent when the solo game finally wears thin. (Two-player play on a single machine is also available.) The mechanics have been subtly improved. The Saturn game forced players to re-load by aiming off-screen and firing. In a sense, this was realistic. But it also removed the player from the game's ferocious flow-your aim was constantly bouncing back and forth-and in a David versus Goliath standoff of this sort, that would get you dead in a hurry. In the computer version, you'll reload by just double right-clicking with the mouse. While this ability does make the game a little casier, you can disable the auto-target mechanism, ramp up the difficully (there are nine levels) and play VCPD in mirror image. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the challenge...and maybe a little more respectful. missiles at you. Survive all three bosses and..well, I've no idea. Playing on \"hard,\" I haven't survived longer than one full level at a sitting. Typically, I get massacred by music-industry executive types in Level 3's computer-cluttered secretarial pool. Ilows that for verisimilitude. KILLING TIME AT THE OFFICE It looks as though everyone's come to work, and gunmen are behind every article of cover. The game likes to throw them at you in sequence-enemies appearing one after the other in nearby positions but you'll also find them erupting in the foreground. appearing in clusters, launching grenades and knives from distant cover and running across your field of fire. The bodies always wink oul afterward-the better to keep up the 30 frames-per-second scrolling, I suppose-but the game keeps meticulous stats on your successes. You'll start with just a six-shot revolver. Shotguns, automatics, magdows of cars and set off a volcanic detonation of the gas tank sure to take out anyone dumb enough to be standing nearby. You can blow up certain barrels, which release nice explosions, which, in tum, can knock out nearby scenery. And even scenery you can't destroy often registers your lire in some unique way-rocking backward or giving off a metallic rattle. And then there are the civics. These pitiful, wearisome creatures rise into your line of fire with lands raised, or scultle, bent over, across the background, murmuring \"Don't kill me!\" I lold your fire cntircly, and you risk taking heat from the less-sympathetic gummen who are invariably positioned behind the hostages, Kill them and I've been tempted to kill them out of simple frustration--and you'll lose a life to match the innocent one you've taken.

"REVIEW. TOTAL MAYHEM NOTI)V manually, while ammo and weapons are automatically swapped as needed. I found the requirement for replacing each soldier's battery tiresome, and more than once I felt like I was playing with toy soldiers. This was a major disruption in the suspension of disbelief, and was reminiscent of spoon feeding your party in ULTIMA: SERPENT ISLE. Status Report TOTAL MAYHEM's technical difficulties are abundant. The first is the high system overhead. Windows 95 users with a Pentium 166 system, and fast CD-ROM drive, have all options available to them. Cinematic scenes and multiplayer mode are exclusive to Windows 95, which leave Windows 3.1 users, and gamers with modest systems, dry. Getting the game to run after installation was a major obstacle. I had to fiddle with my video card and download a patch to run the game. Once ! got the game running on my Pentium 166, I was rewarded with a highresolution graphic screen with rich detail and cool CD audio background music. However, this minor triumph was offset by further problems. Some missions could not be finished on the first try because of blatant bugs. In Mission 10, the green fail-safe key turned all the force fields back on, so I could not complete the mission. It was suppose to turn them off. On the subsequent replay of the mission, everything worked properly. After the transition video for Mission 20, the last mission, the game would cause the computer to hang up while loading, causing a Windows Protection Violation-a fatal error. I could not enter this mission, even after playing the 19th Mission three times. Look for the latest patch at http://www.domark.com/. There are only five types of weapons you can request during the game, but these are augmented by different types of ammunition. Your inventory is further supplemented by explosives and robot control devices. Be aware that if the soldier is lost in battle, you'll only be able to recover door and fail-safe keys, not his armament. During missions, you can exchange any equipment, except for personal armor, shiell, and power generator. However, the individuals involved in the transaction must be near each other. Be sure to load up on first aid kits and batteries. Yes, batteries. The use of these two items must be controlled INSUBORDINATE SOLDIERS There is strength and fire-power in numbers, but a crowd can be unwieldy combining the weapons of a large team and concentrating their fire on one target in a fire fight has a quick and decisive outcome.

"REVIEW  ASSAULT RIGS ACTION IP SPECTER's Ghost DIFFICULTY LEVEL A Multiplayer Shooter That Looks Great, Is Less Thrilling by Martin E. Cirulis you are supposed to be driving a vehicle and very little of that comes through until you make a bad turn and flip over. AR succeeds in being prettier and more complex than SPECTER, but fails to capture that same sense of wide open, fast action. Despite these shortcomings, this game splashy menu effects that become numbingly tedious and, of course, the utter lack of save game slots. So if you want net arcade thrills, dig SPECTER Out again and save yourself some money and aggravation. Otherwise, for the lone vehicular maniac out there, n the old days of netgaming, there was a little multiplayer arcade action wonder called SPECTER. It wasn't much by today's standards, mainly a high-speed BATTLEZONE with tanks that could be modified, but it was the first networkable title of its kind, and with eight people zooming around its stylish cyberspace levels, blasting away at cach other, it was a sure crowd pleaser. These days, with all the improvements in technology, I've been looking for a title that supplies those same quick and dirty arcade thrills, but with updated, bleedingedge graphics and sound. And when I first spotted ASSAULT Rics from Psygnosis, I thought I had my super-sequel. Unfortunately, from the very opening setup for the game I realized that, once again, I had wandered into the EuroZone, where software standards are nothing like those we Colonials are familiar or happy with TRON REVISITED You'd have more fun watching the old movie than playing this beautiful but sorry multiplayer tank game. ASSAULT Rics may make a good cartridge game for the PC, but there's nothing here that ZONE RAIDERS didn't do better NOT EXACTLY REVOLUTIONARY ASSAULT RICS (AR) makes no bones about its arcade origins. In fact, the opening animation is pretty much a statement of AR's place in the evolution of the video game. The entire premise liere is to take one of three different vehicles and go Price: $59.00 from level to level, blasting enemies and System Requirements: IBM collecting gems.

But no, Psygnosis demands cach player have their own copy of the CD in order to play a net game. All I can do is wish any fans of this game lots of luck conning five or six of their friends into shelling out $60 for this dog, For me, the final nail in the coffin was the fact that once again, the North American consumer is expected to pure chase a product that doesn't quite meet North American standards in software.

He knew little game MONTY PYTHON AND THE QUEST about this strange new breed before A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. Since then, Eric has done more than dabble in games; he starred in Psygnosis' DISCWORLD game (where his sense of comedic timing made a huge difference). Now, Eric's knowledge of Python lore has made him the obvious choice as the executive producer (along with 7th Level's Bob Ezrin) of HOLY GRAIL.His control over the project made it easier for 7th Level to land not only Idle, but other Python members for audio recordings. \"Terry Gilliam added new illustrations as well, so that even the newly-generated material has that authentic Python silliness. Essentially, gameplay consists of moving to the various locations made famous by the film, then playing a puzzle or arcade game. You can Spank the Virgin at Castle Anthrax, Burn the Witch. Bring Out Your Dead, all while traipsing through a medieval England that your history professors never imagined. Make a daring escape from the three-headed knight, always hungry (and always arguing with itself). Attempt to Catch the Cow outside of Lombaird castle. Bravely fight the Black Knight in his dark, brooding and dangerous (if silly) forest. Face unspeakable furry horrors in the fell and un-pronounccable Caves of Caerbannog. Oli, yes, lest we forget-there is a \"point\" of sorts: to find hidden clues and items strewn about the Pythonesque landscape, so that you may safely cross the Bridge of Death.

Of the clasAttro sic games showcased in MAURICE ASHLEY TEACHES CHESS, one contest in particular teaches several lessons. Bobby Fischer is still, in my opinion, the greatest chessplayer of all time, and in his \"Game of the Century\" against US Grandmaster Donald Byrne, he was definitely \"in the zone.\" Notice how Byrne, as white here, seems to have the advantage: his knights are well posted, and he controls more of the board than his opponent. But Fischer takes advantage of Byrne's king, at risk in the center, while simultaneously attacking white's queen. Fischer sees every opportunity, first putting pressure on one flank, then the X other, then making a surpris. ing-and effective-queen sacrifice. Despite Byrne's tough defense, the combinations spring from Fischer's position. Once you can understand this game, you can't help but be a better chessplayer. For more on Bobby Fischer and his life, as well as his incredible chess skills, I heartily recommend Bobby Fischer: Profile of a Prodigy, by Frank Brady (whose new book on Orson Welles is also worth reading, even though Welles was master of a different medium than chess).

"DENNIS MCCAULEY  SPORTS Sponsport Gramps Makes A Comeback Old-Timer MICROLEAGUE BASEBALL Gets Re-Equipped For The Majors he Friday before Memorial Day dawned sunny and warm-a great day for a ball game. The aged red brick monument I'd come to visit loomed before me as I climbed out of my battered Subaru. With excitement hanging in the air like a Ralph Branca curveball, I imagined the thrills that this weathered structure had provided baseball fans over the years. Passing through the entrance I sensed that I was visiting a true shrine to the national pasttime What made my pilgrimage even more intriguing was that I had come to bear witness to perhaps the year's most anticipated birth. No, I wasn't at Wrigley Field or Fenway Park. Rather, I was at the old APBA Game Company building, Nestled in rolling farm country not far from Gettysburg, APBA HQ, with its 1950's architecture, quirky interior layout and endless stacks of player cards is a retro trip down memory lane.

'The APBA products should benefit from increased access to retail channels via MMI's distribution connections. MMT's acquisition of APBA is sure to have ripple effects in the sports gaming community. While the APBA board games will continue, future releases in the APBA computer line, especially MSDOS versions, arc in doubt. In fact, at least one discounted CD-ROM compilation, featuring the APBA baseball, football, and ice hockey games has found its way to market, indicating that these products are being phased out. On the up side, MMI is developing a statistical boxing game, which will probably be the first product released as a joint MicroLeagueAPBA venture. MMI's commitment to APBA seems firm. The parent company has relocated ils offices from Delaware to APBAS quaint Pennsylvania facility.

"DENNY ATKIN  SIMULATION SPACE SUDOU Multiplayer's Final Frontier PLANETARY RAIDERS Promises To Make Capitalism A Blast ave you been spending more time flying into the ground in WARBIRDS and AIR WARRIOR than attacking enemy planes? Tired of fighting for God and country, and ready to make some cold, hard cash for your efforts? Or are you just frustrated that nobody (except a bunch of computer-generated Kilrathi) knows just what an amazing space pilot you are? If any of these describe you, then you'll want to watch www.icigames.com for the newest effort from the creators of WARBIRDS. called PLANETARY RAIDERS. PRIVATEER series. Players start with a basic space ship and enough money to buy essential equipment for it. From there, it's up to you what strategy you want to take. Do you cam a proud living as a hard-working trader, or go for the big bucks as a smuggler? Or does space piracy sound more exciting. ICI plans to leave the game as open-ended as possible, so those possibilities and more are open to you. But PLANETARY RAIDERS is about more than space combat and personal wealth. The game promises to have a full-blown resource-management element as well. Players will fly from one of 12 space stations in a planetary system. Each of these stations both produces and requires resources, and none is completely self-sulficient. That's where the trade clement comes in. When you take a mission to pick up, say, defensive weapons, you're helping to keep your base supplied. If you succeed. not only do you profit, but you build the strength of your home base as well. Of course, this works both ways. If you can intercept other players as they attempt to bring supplies back to their stalions, you can hit them in the pocketbook and cripple their station. Be careful, though. Once you're marked as a nuisance, the station you're bothering can put a bounty on your head, and players the solar system over will be gunning (or lasering) for your ship Take PRIVATEER, mix in a little CAPITALISM, and sprinkle with some CIV... STATION KEEPING At the core, PLANETARY RAIDERS is very much a multiplayer homage to Origin's ELEMENTS OF SUCCESS The best way to survive with a bounty on your head is to fly with friendly forces at your side. Players can form squadrons, and these squadrons can form corporations, which in tum run the stations. Once a corporation is in control of a station, players won't be able to just sit back and watch the credits roll in. Someone ON THE RADAR You won't have to wait idle while DID wraps up TFX 3, the sequel to EF2000. The coming TACTCOM addon for EF2000 will breathe new life into the game. Along with all the fixes and enhancements included in the various EF2000 patches, TACTCOM will add serial and modem play, including a number of new multiplayer mission options. The new Tactical Mission Planner will allow you to plot your own combat sorties in the campaign, choosing which target to take out, the strike package to use, and how to get there. A new smart camera system will let you view other aircraft, going straight to where the action is without forcing you to key past dozens of planes sitting on the tarmac. Also in the works is SUPER EF2000 FOR WINDOWS 95, essentially EF2000 and TACTCOM in one package with full Win 95 support. SUPER EF2000 will include detailed online help and reference material. Both products should be available sometime this summer. resources, sending players out on missions both to sustain the station and increase the bankroll. Of bigger concem are station raicers. Players with the cash and resources will be able to build invasion robots, which can be shipped en masse to competing stations in an effort to take them over. In the initial version, the victor will likely be determined simply by the size of the attacking and defending forces. Eventually, look for a fully interactive invasion module to go online.

"DENNY ATKIN 3) VAS/NOTIVINNIS You have a hot new Pentium 200 and you can't wait to see the smooth frame rate on your classic sims and space games like CHUCK YEAGER'S AIR COMBAT and WING COMMANDER II. Then you discover that in the bad old days programmers never anticipated machines as fast as we have now, and the games are unplayable at hyperspeed. No need to worry, though. Just hit the net and find the Moslo utility, which allows you to run programs at anywhere from 1 to 99 percent of normal speed. You'll find the utility at ftp://ftp.ea.com/pub/patches/ moslo.exe. day,ch? Double-cross him, though, and you'll quickly gain a negative reputation. So what happens if your hard-earned slip gets blown away and you don't have any credits in the bank? Along with the corporations, there's also a military presence in the solar system. When you reenter the game, you can join the military, where you'll be given a free ship and steady pay. Look for the military to keep any corporations that grow loo big for their britches in check. In the same way that you can enhance and update your fighters and transports, you'll also be able to update the infrastructure of your corporation's station. You can enhance the station's production by improving the planet you're orbiling. If you produce food, terraform the planet; if you produce raw resources, build automated mines. If you're looking for that extra edge.go visit the Starman. This Jabba the Hut-style character inhabits a corner of the solar system and is the local black marketeer. The Starman can sell you contraband weapons not available anywhere else, perfect for that space station assault you're planning space physics, but what's the fun in spend ing half of your flight accelerating, then turning around and then spending the rest of the journey decelerating? Instead, you'll be able to alter speed and direction casily, and jump-gates will take the drudgery out of going from planet to planet (as well as providing good spots for pirates to lie in wait). Along with station defense, bounty hunting, transport escort, and trade runs. STATION ASSEMBLY Of course, a universe this extensively modeled and with this much freedom of action is going to be quite a task to model. Look for a free, open beta test with a subset of these features to start soon after you read this. As time passes more features will be added, and once the main structure is in place, the billing clock will be turned LAND 2310 B FPS 4.90 AR PD SHIP SHAPE All this resource management may be fum (and indeed, you can just play clerk and not fly at all if that's what you want to do), but it's the action that will be the primary interest of the majority of players. Initially, PLANETARY RAIDERS will sport three types of fighters and three types of transports. But you won't be able to let appearances inclicate who's safe to attack. That top-flight fighter may have broken the bank of the owner and thus be equipped with simple lasers, while that little starter ship may be loaded with all the hottest systems. As your wallet fattens, you'll be able to buv a better radar, more powerful communications systems, and of course big. ger weapons Ontap so far are lasers, rail guns, and a variety of missiles. You can even customize your ship's color scheme. The \"flight model will be a real deparlure for the accuracy fanatics at ICH-it will offer simple, WING COMMANDERstyle control. ICI considered doing real SPACE BLANKET BABYLON The ships in PLANETARY RAIDERS may be a bit polygon-light, but the smooth motion and huge space stations give you a great sense of scale, you can work to disrupt your opponents cconomics as well. Resources from planets and asteroids will be shipped to the stations via unmanned cargo pods, which can be destroved en-route, for instance. Look for some other unique possibilities. For example, you could radio a neardead opponent and tell him that if he drops luis cargo, you'll let him go. Better to surrender today and live to fight another on. The catures outlined here are what ICI plans for the basic game, but they have some amazingly claborate plans for versions to follow. After getting a look at an carly alpha version of PLANETARY RAIDERS and grasping the scale as relatively small slips flew around huge space stalions orbiting even more gigantic planets, this free trader is definitely ready to beam aboard.

After HISTORY OF THE WORLD is completed, the next big project at Avalon Hill will be PC PANZERBLITZ. The big questions are whether this mega-boardgame hit (it's sold over 275,000 copies, making it second only to Axis & Allies in board wargame sales) can be updated from its 1970 rules to a more modern mindset without damaging the feel and quality of play. PANZER GENERAL continues to sell very well-CGW was able to confirm sales data of over 250,000 units. When you consider that a new Windows 95 and Macintosh version has just been released, it seems fair to say that PG will be incontestably the best-selling historical computer wargame of all time, not even including bundling agreements. Our congratulations to SSI and all the talented people involved. Never been to a game convention? Two of the best are but weeks away. GenCon (Milwaukee, $40, 414-248-0389 fax, tsrinc@aol.com) is the largest board/computer game convention, with an average annual attendance of over 20,000. Every major (and many minor) board and computer game vendors are there to ply their wares, run tournaments, and pontificate on the state of the art of gaming. If you are an RPGer, this is the place to be, as it hosts the official RPGA Championships. AvalonCon (Baltimore, $35, 800-999-3222, Avalon.Hill@genie@geis.com) is a much smaller con, averaging about 1400 attendees. There are no lectures, seminars or other distractions from the more than 100 boardgame tournaments-all featuring AH games. MULTIMEDIA BOMB RUNS Like PANZER GENERAL, OVER THE Reicu's real strength comes from strong campaigns, cach featuring a heap of authentic WWII archival film footage: strafing runs, screaming jets, fighter sweeps, et al. But these little multimedia touches never get in the way of the combat-ricli environment. You arm your fightcr group, choose your pilots, decide which route to take and charge toward the target. As you end off attacks from interceptors, with cach loss, you must make the tough decisions. Do I attack the secondary target? Have I enough fuck to make it home? And you face similar decisions with your pilots, who gain in expertise and fall prey to fatigue, adding roleplaying elements to the mix. Eleven types of Allied aircraft are modcled in the game, including the P-38 Lightning, the P-51B and P-51D Mustang, and the famous B-17 Flying Fortress. Should you get tired of playing the Americans, you can switch to the British or Cerman sicles; in the latter, you'll find out just how experimental the Komet rocket fighter really was. And it looks as though not just e-mail play, but Internet play will be included as well. Now, if you'll excuse me, HQ has just informed me that Her Majesty has authorized our use of the new Clocester Meteor jet fighter. We'll will give those Jerries what for! & more realism. It could be Avalon I lill's breakthrough computer game. The big differences in OVER THE REICH and FC2 involve more than just moving the venue from the modern era to WWII.

Freed from the restrictions of cardboard and paper, Charlic and J.D. will now be able to add even more details than in J.D.'s boardgames. OVER THE REICH has the potential to be not just the best game ever produced on the Air War over Germany it is that already--but one of the best WWII games we've scen, period. If you read my column on computer opponents a couple of months ago, you know how highly I rate the Al for FC2.

I suppose those could be really thick woods. though. Those South Carolina swamps worked for Francis Marion in the American Revolutionary War. Another complaint I have has nothing to do with the underlying calculations. It's just that in order to get the most of the visuals in the game, you have to play much of the game zoomed in to the max. Unfortunately, that also means you'll face a lot of scrolling that slows the game down, even on my Pentium 70 laptop. The bigger figures are nicer, but it means you'll usually see less of the map at one time when you're enjoying them. 12.19 1 8 m BATTERY POWER Placing artillery side-by-side within the same hex is particularly effective, if you fire each battery separately. Firing the batteries in the same hex simultaneously will almost always produce the same result for both batteries, while firing them independently means you'll usually hit the target at least once. Tems. MELEE MASSACRE Skirmishers can chalk up disproportional results when defending in well-covered terrain such as this orchard near Huguemont. Just because we think the skirmishers are too effective to be historically accurate doesn't mean you shouldn't take advantage of it. SPOILS OF WAR Yet, when it comes down to it, BATTLEGROUND: WATERLOO is the best Napoleonic gaming experience I've ever had. I've played miniatures with rules authors, classic board games with champion players, and tried every Napoleonic computer game I could get my hands on. This one captures the flavor, the strategy and the spirit of the era like no other game I've played.

"REVIEW. TACOPS DIFFICULTY LEVEL Tactical Errors STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Arsenal Fires A Dud Into Windows Territory By Patrick C. Miller I W While you might expect a game that runs under Windows to have at least some visual appeal, 'TACOL's has a face that only a grognard could love. The maps are ugly and since most of the terrain is in identical shades of green, determining effects on combat and what you can see is difficult. It doesn't help that the line of sight routine is a convoluted process or that you can't zoom in the map view. Without zoom, you sometimes feel as if you're playing a tiny board game using a pair of tweezers to move unit markers. TACOPS supports play by c-mail, nctwork and mul modemi comection, Modem play is much too bothersome though. Rather than providing built-in modem support, the game requires both players to comect with a third-party communications program and then send their orders files back and forth. It's not all that casy and probably not what most players have in mind. Despite TACOIS poor showing on Windows, Arsenal is planning a scquel using a more up-to-date engine. Given the company's lagtime in porting TACOPS over to Windows, it will probably be another vear before we see it. From the look of things, though, they probably need all the time they can get.

Cirulis obody is happier than I am that we live in an age when dozens of new computer games arrive every quarter. Sometimes, though, I woncler if we are in danger of missing some rough gems in favor of all the shiny baubles. In the old days, there wasn't much to choose from, and consumers were more likely to succze all the gameplay they could get from a game before passing judgement. I'm afraid many will overlook CHAOS OVERLORDS because it does not make a good first impression; there are no flashy graphics, no live action video and gameplay isn't anything incredible. But remember the old days and stick with this game, because it definitely rewards the player who's willing to put in a little extra clfort OLX 03 > 0 GRID WARS This interface is pretty ugly, and none too intuitive, but once you get past it, you'll find a challenging strategy game with a surprising level of depth. lains three structures that range from casinos to bars to research labs, and all cough up varying amounts of money every turn, in what must be the future equivalent of \"protection\" payments. Structures also confer other benefits according to their purpose, such as improved recovery rates for units healing in hospital squares, or increased research ability for those gangs in squares with a lab. As for the gangs themselves, they are your eyes, cars and fists; without them you have nothing. Each gang has a long series of attributes that cover both combat and DYERLORES ERDE BEHOBO Et Options Help SCORE SECTOR HERERANCE TUS CS OF 01 BUTY CYBER-M.U.L.E.? CHAOS is a multiplayer, turn-based strategy game about various crimelorels vying for control of the city. There isn't a lot of chrome here. Instead, this game is a trip back to simpler, pre-IBM supremacy days, when an audience didn't think twice about a game set on a Sx&grid, where units were blatant reproductions of wargame info cards, and where the manual explained combat resolution in terms of simulating six-sided die. Though CHAOS allows players to play a number of different scenarios, what they all boil down to is the same style of game with different victory conditions. This is a game of territory control and economics, where cach neighborhood serves as a movement square to be entered and fought in, as well as an economic resource to be explosited. As a Crimelord, your existence depends on hiring criminal gangs to control territory, which in tum produces the money to hire more, and nastier, gangs. Each neighborhood conFACE LAST TURN EVENTS 11.

"REVIEW CHAOS OVERLORDS open up with shotguns on the Disgruntled Postal Workers, who are packing rocket launchers. STRATEGYI WARGAMES administrative skills for the running of your empire. To take a neighborhood into your pocket, you must first send in at least one gang to initiate control of the sector. Once that is achieved, you may begin taking over the buildings within that sector, or, if you are pressed for cash, a gang can shake down the entire neighborhood for loose change. Be warned, though. Populations can only be shaken down so many times before they get angry and call in the cops for a crackdown. Then the cops will call in the big guns, kill every center of the game. Instead of just rancom decoration, which is how they ini tially come across, each gang is actually a carefully constructed unit that can have an important effect on your basic stratcgy. Because the gangs you can hire are random, you are forced to adopt subtle changes to your strategy with every new game. For instance, you may have discovered a killer gang/weapon combo, but if you're never dealt the right gang to research the weapon or the ideal one to carry it, you will be in a fair amount of IDENTIFKATION DOMINATRIX CLIQUE DESCAPTION \"YOU'VE BEEN SO BAD AND NEED A SPANKING. CRACK!! BARK YOU DOG. BARK!\" INFORMATION FORCE ?? UPKEEP TECH LEVEL ORDER FROM CHAOS CHAOS OVERLORDS is basically a good little boardgame translation with a few rough comers in presentation, which may turn potential fans off before they reach the gold. For a supposedly Win95 game, it functions more like a proprietary DOS game, with no window shrinking controls, Players minimize the screen at their own risk. Graphically speaking, this game is incredibly monotonous. CHAOS could use a few random combat resolution effects for truly spectacular match-ups, as well as a more rewarding end to the scenarios and a permanent record of player achievements. Also, the interface is fairly daunting and confusing, requiring a few reads of the manual before any competent usage. As far as gameplay goes, the only real flaw is that the Al plays \"Kick the I luman\" a little too much in a game that is supposed to be a free-for-all. In the end, what we have here is proof that sometimes your first impressions can be wrong. Of course, this depends on what kind of person you are as well. If you are looking for a slick package that delivers up-front wargame thrills like PANZER CENERAL, then I cloubt this game will ever rock your world. On the other hand, if you have the time and patience to play a strategy game that is original and challenging instead of just pretty, then you might want to rent a stronghold in this twisted little neighborhood. & STATISTICS COMBAT DEFENSE COMMAND SKULLE OPONO UNO OUR W NA CONTROL HEAL INFLU RESEARCH omson STEALTH DETECT COMBAT SKILLS STRENGTH 2 BLADE BLADE RANGE FIGHTING  MARTS OUGLA OK BREAK OUT THE WHIPS The gangs in CHAOS conjure up some hilarious images, and help give the game a little demented personality. gang in the neighborhood for a few turns and return everything to its pristinc, unesploited state. Speaking of killing, no matter which scenario you choose to play, conflict with your fellow crimelords is inevitable. So don't forget to liire some nasty liombres and outfit them with the best weapons vou have on hand. Cangs attack with a combination of their own attributes and modifiers from equipment they carry while the defender gets a counter-attack at half-strength. Should a combat round end with a gang at zero bit points, they are gone from the game, and whatever expensive equipment you provided goes to the grave with them. trouble if you can't come up with something else fast. And the gangs aren't just for fighting, 'The subtle interaction of their attributes with the economics of the game means you're always eager to find the right bunch for the job you have in mind. You can spend entire games using your favorites to their best advantage (such as bankers for squeezing out extra cash), while desperately trying to protect them from harm. It is this level of the game which truly differentiates it from the pack. While this may seem a small detail, it was enough to change the game from something I played because it's my job to something I will play long after this assignment is over. Not since the old Illuminati card game have I openly chuckled at some of the images created by a game. You'll know what I mean the first time you see the Angry Nun gang APPEAL: Only for dedicated strategy gamers who crave a challenging management game and have the patience to look beyond the surface. PROS: A novel, truly strategic wargame that offers plenty of play and humor with excellent multiplayer potential. LOOKING BEYOND THE GRIME The key to getting your money's worth from Chaos is realizing that the gangs aren't just a gimmick but are the whole CONS: CHAOS OVERLORDS is not pretty by any means, and it's very hard to get into. It also starts off slowly, and, while deep, is never really exciting. Interface is also confusing. AUGUST 1996 CG "

Woman's Suffrage and the Cure for Cancer both diminish the negative effects of large overseas armies. J.S. Bach's cathedral is also nice, since it effectively gives you a cathedral in every city. Use freight or caravans to accelerate wonder production so enemy civs don't build these essential wonders first. The Al will typically begin construction of a wonder immediately after it acquires the appropriate advance. 2) Increase production with the Hoover Dam. This wonder will boost production in all your cities and also cleans up pollution. The production boost will help you build units and space ship parts, while the clean air will help in your final score. 3) Use railroads for a rapid deployment force that can move anywhere on your continents instantaneously. This military striking force can then be rapidly shifted via rail from one trouble spot to the next. 4) Once your cities have SAMs, build airfields a few squares away and garrison them with fighters.

"HALL OF FAME Welcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. HIGHLIGHTS Alone in the Dark I-Motion, 1993 hen you talk about the decline in action-oriented adventure games, no story is more telling than the ALONE IN THE DARK series. The original earned a place in our Hall of Fame because of its creative use of 3D technology to place gamers within a chilling adven. ture game context. ALONE IN THE DARK's immediate ancestor, OUT OF THIS WORLD, proved that 3D technology was useful for cinematic action games, but AITD went much further in creating an effective gaming atmosphere. Despite the number of times that l Motion and others have returned to themes of Lovecraftian-style horror, ALONE IN THE DARK is the only time they've been fully successful. The private investigator you portray looks awkward now, but at the time, the 3D character walking into the dark and mysterious house was wonderfully creepy. Hell-hounds, pianos that played by them selves, creaky stairs-this game made every gothic horror cliché fun again. While some of the maneuvering could be tedious, line of sight and maneu vering around objects became an integral part of the adventure game experience. The action portions of the original AITD have sadly been over-empha. sized in the sequels at the expense of the storyline; let's hope that I-Motion can recapture the magic. We can always use another classic horror game. Wolfenstein 3D id Software, 1992 OLFENSTEIN 3D is the grandfather of modern-day 3D shooters like DUKE NUKEM 3D and Quake. If you had to put it on the evolutionary chart, it would go somewhere between homo erectus and penicillin (there's a pun there somewhere, but we're not looking). The origi nal CASTLEWOLFENSTEIN had you running around in an old castle guarded by Nazi jailers. Fairly typical of early Apple Il games, it was soon forgotten. WOLTENSTEIN 3D took the simple line-and-fill graphic mazes of the earlier game and transformed them into a smooth-scrolling, rapid-fire, texture. mapped environment. The details of the castle were fewer than those of ULTIMA UNDERWORLD, but they featured Nazi banners, stained glass windows starring old hairlip himself, and lots of nice touches like chandeliers and coats of armor. Gamers hungry for action quickly warmed to the fast pace of the game, accentuated by the large active area of the screen, and the excellent use of sound and perspective-all of which would later be perfected with id's masterpiece, Doom. Although newer, sexier 3D games have now replaced WOLFENSTEIN as the fastest adrenaline pumpers around, the game should be remembered for putting shareware back on the gaming map, and for sparking a first-person shooting craze that lives to this day. -Modern Inductees Inductees Prior To 1989 BATTLE CHESS (Interplay Productions, 1988) CHESSMASTER (The Software Toolworks, 1986) DUNGEON MASTER (FTL SOFTWARE, 1987) EARL WEAVER BASEBALL (Electronic Arts, 1986) EMPIRE (Interstel, 1978) F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER (MicroProse, 1988) GETTYSBURG: THE TURNING POINT (SSI, 1986) KAMPFGRUPPE (Strategic Simulations, 1985) MECH BRIGADE (Strategic Simulations, 1985) MIGHT & MAGIC (New World Computing, 1986) M.U.L.E.

"MARTIN CIRULIS you what What's The TM Deal With... may Windows 95?. ooner or later you knew I was going to mouth off about Windows 95 and share my gamer's take on things. But before we get on to the merriment, I'd like to get a couple of things straight. First of all, I could give a rat's fanny about the inane \"Microsoft takes over the world\" tales that pervade the 'Net these days. As far as I'm concerned, there is enough real industrial villainy in the world that the shenanigans of a boy genius really don't cut it. Anybody who thinks computer software skullduggery is worth droning on about should go hang out in Bhopal, and see what real corporate greed can do. Second, I thought the marketing blitz last summer for Win95's release was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen. Every time the mainstream media fell for it I couldn't help snicker ing. My favorite was the \"Midnight Release Parties\" that were thrown at goofy software stores in just about every city. Did anybody go to these things? What were they thinking? \"Hey Bubba! C'mon! Get that waitress off yer lap and come over to my place. You can watch me transfer a file! Yeehah!\" I mean, c'mon, this was a bloody operating system, not the Beatles reunion album with John chiming in from the netherworld. With those two background checks in place, I guess it's time to get on with the main event. After all, it's pretty much been a year since I've started working with this beastie, and I think can safely say that my opinions have left the realm of the knee-jerk long ago. The bottom line is: \"It seems to Work OK, but it's no bloody Theory of Relativity either\"-and that's really what bugs me about it. For all that hype, it should have really been some thing special...but guess what? It's just another damn operating system. admit, as a big network gaming kinda guy, I am pretty happy about the improvements over the crotchety-oldguy-in-the-attic that was Windows for Workgroups. Nowadays those network hooks, once established, are as solid as can be, and make gaming through anything Win95-compatible a real breeze. I am tickled pink over that improvement. In fact, the whole setup is completely user-friendly, right up to the point something isn't workingand then all that endless \"Plug'n Play\" crap boils down to a help file message saying a) Maybe your card is buggered or you didn't put it in all the way or b) Maybe you should ask somebody much smarter than you. The other great promise of Win95 for gamers: the end of the 640K limit and the dreaded boot disk. This is another mixed bag, from the Maxwell Smart \"It was this close...\"depart ment. Once again things have gotten Oh sure, there are a few sweet dedieasier, but at the same time they are cated titles, the odd quality ones from nowhere near what they were Sierra like the command cut of Aces promised to be. The very fact that the OF THE DEEP, with actual useful voice wise and courageous Loyd Case must commands, or the very pretty spend each month diving through EARTHSIEGE2, which had far more BIOSes and defining optimal boot sys impressive frame rates than gameplay tems is a big clue that Win95 isn't or character, but which at least demonstrated that the next half-step in sim technology could exist quite nicely under Win95. On the other hand, I am getting pretty tired of half-baked car. tridge machine rejects that need a Pentium and 16 megs, but proudly display \"Compatibility\" stickers. And speaking of compatibility stickers: here's a news flash to all those folks who put on those \"COMPATIBLE WITH WIN'95!!!!!!!!!*\" stickers, footnoted at the bottom with: \"*in MS-DOS mode.\" For all intents and purposes, watch me trans that is the same bloody thing as saying it's NOT bloody compatible! fer a file! 22 So, while Win95 is definitely a step in the right direction, and I'm sure ol' exactly the gamer's complete \"friend Uncle Bill deserves to make the odd in a box\" yet. I can hear the trade reps buck off of it, I'd really hate to see all screaming that these things aren't the back slapping media mongers go needed for games designed for blind to the fact that Microsoft ain't Win95, and they're right. But who quite done yet, and there's a ways to gives a fig, while the current games go before gaming and Windows are designed for the OS are so dubious? comfortable in the same sentence CC Hey Bubba!
