"Violence and Gaming EDITORIAL Is Our Hobby Prone to Self-Inflicted Wounds? a large part of the problem. The simple answer is that we don't believe that computer and video games are a large part of the problem. We believe that there is a positive, cathartic effect in simulated violence. Violence in computer games is not intended to encourage the slaughter of unarmed innocents. Computer games are a temporary escape from real life, not tutorials for a tragic end to life. We in no way condone the actions of disturbed minds unable to make such a distinction. Violence is used in story-telling media to (parental abdication of responsibility, easy access to weapons, social stigma, lack of unifying moral frameworks, high student-teacher ratio, lack of school security, and so on), violent media can play a role in such tragedies. Merely because some of us can suspend our disbelief and recognize the unreal nature of computer game violence doesn't mean that everyone is capable of making that distinction between reality and imagination. Young minds and disturbed minds are some times not capable of filtering the exaggera've always believed that there is a healthy, cathartic side to violent games. I've always hoped that they would stave off violence in real life rather than contribute to it. I still believe that, in general, they help rather than hurt. But I have to admit feel ing a little shaken by the horrors of late April. I've been feeling grief for both the victims and the survivors at Columbine High School, that listlessness and numbness that keeps you from being able to concentrate as you should. The grief was exacerbated when I received my subscriber copy of Computer Gaming World. I had forgotten that we had shown Max Payne firing down a corridor. It was a subway corridor, and Max is an undercover DEA agent firing at perpetrators, as opposed to innocent students, but the scene looked shockingly familiar. As the subscribers began to receive their copies, many began to suspect that we had cynically created the cover to gain notoriety or shock value from the horrors that the people in Colorado had experienced. Several subscribers admitted being fans of first-person shooters, but felt shocked and disturbed by the image. If the cover made you feel uncomfortable because it seemed related to the shooting, apologize. It was simply a bizarre coincidence. We would never have designed a cover based on such a tragedy. These covers were printed and in the mail prior to the shooting in Colorado. Of course, that isn't the real issue. The real issue is why a national publication would depict a violent act on the cover when, as the analysts have suggested in the wake of the tragedy, computer and video games may be In film, books, comics, and music, violence is used as graphic hyperbole to raise the stakes and make us pay attention. reflect those dangerous, heroic situations where someone we care about manages to restore order out of chaos, redress wrong, and give us a sense of hope. In film, books, comics, and music, violence is used as graphic hyperbole to raise the stakes and make us pay attention. Violence tends to work in media because it is something we don't all experience, something far enough out of the ordinary that we can suspend our disbelief. This does not mean that we whitewash the fact that violent media is a \"part of the problem. Along with thousands of other causes Weak Ratings The games industry the box. Computer games ratneeds to improve the ings need to give consumers way we rate games. The RSAC more information at a glance system, below, is a better We propose a three-tiered approach because it describes system, perhaps color-coded in the content in the game-but green, yellow, and red, which it's used in less than 5 percent of identifies games for a General new games. Most games are audience, Parental Guidance, or rated by the ESRB (Entertain Restricted. Unfortunately, the ment Software Ratings Board), Motion Picture Association of which doesn't offer any America won't allow the content description games industry to on the front of use G, PG, and R BAG ADVISORY ratings, so we'll have to ART use new let WAR ters that iden tify the three No categories Some may suggest that this system is like the ESRB system (below), but it is not. The ESRB system uses an M for \"Mature,\" which puts a positive spin on content that should be considered \"Restricted.\" Ratings should not imply that the more extreme games are more \"grown-up\" and sophisticat ed\" than games designed for MATURE everyone. tion from the reality. For this reason, Computer Gaming World has advocated content labeling (clear, specific, and highly visible on the front of the box) for all games since 1990. We recognize the responsibility of publishers and creators to inform their customers about the contents of their products. We believe this protects freedom of speech and expression in the long run. It also gives parents a chance to monitor what their impressionable children are playing, but does not guarantee that they will do so. Some readers will rightly point out that the games are rated. Yet, I believe that the current ratings are inadequate. Age-related terms like \"Teen\" and \"Mature\" do not inform consumers about what is in the box that makes these games for older kids or adults. Descriptions on the back of the box do little to describe the extent of the violence or adult language. Even with the RSAC rating system's thermometer representing the degrees of violence and language, the descriptions are often printed in miniscule type. Parents need to be able to tell at a glance what is in the products. Let's change the ratings systems. It's time for everyone in our industry to come together and agree on one universal set of icons and descriptions. Let's help people make informed decisions, and let's take responsibility as an industry rather than having lawmakers and reactive citizens impose restrictions on us. I'll be waiting with great curiosity, and not a little consternation, as events unfold. CGW VIOLENCE AGES 17 CONTENT RATIDAY ESRB www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1999 "

Game publishing has turned into a buyer's market, thanks to all the consolidation in the entertainment software market. There are so few companies with the resources to get a product onto today's crowded store shelves that they can dictate strict terms and tight budgets to today's game developers. They want to Good Times, Bad Times A shift away from sims and adventure games is already evident. EA's Jane's line will be down from three teams to a single internal development group after A-10 WARTHOG ships. Dynamix has shoved the ambitious ACES OF THE PACIFIC 2 in the closet and cancelled X-FIGHTERS, choosing instead to do the more incremental DESERT FIGHTERS title. Activision, bitten by FIGHTER SQUADRON hitting a market already saturated with WWII sims, isn't likely to revisit the genre. And if you heard buzz on the Internet about a huge company developing a hot new sim using a breakaway team from Su-27 FLANKER, stop anticipating. That project has been cancelled.

It's hard to do the flight-sim equivalent of an indie film when they require Independence Day budgets. fund only the games that promise huge returns, or that can be developed on a shoe string and shoveled at the Wal-Mart crowd. Is it time to get depressed and start honing your 3D shooter skills? Nope. The industry has always been cyclical. Every company is sure its shooter or sports title will be the next half-million seller. But for every HALF-LIFE, there are a dozen TRESPASSERS. And as the \"mainstreaming\" trend widens, the potential for failure of these genres will increase, as the shelves fill with \"me too\" products. You won't see many flight sims or adventure games in the year 2000. But once dozens of other kinds of products fail, companies will look for new ways to get back on top. They'll dig out some sim designs and adventure stories and we'll be back in business. In the meantime, there'll be plenty of HALF-LIFE and ALPHA CENTAURI Knockoffs to play. You can help. Write the companies (on paper, not via email) and tell them what kinds of games you want. Get your friends to do the same. A few thousand requests for a good Pacific air war sim will get noticed. CGW Big Budgets The \"big hit\" mindset is why flight sims and adventure games are in danger. With rare exceptions, a successful sim sells about 150,000 copies. That's enough to make a nice little profit, but it's a drop in the bucket when compared to the sales of a game like UNREAL, STARCRAFT, or NBA LIVE 99. So when it comes time to fund the next round of projects, the bean counters approve the shooters, real-time strategy, and sports games over the sims and adventures. After all, their job is to make as much money for the company as possible. Fine, you say, let the big guys do sports and and mass-carnage games. Surely some smaller companies will fill the sim niche, right? Look at wargames. Once a genre supported by the major players, it's now backed by smaller companies such as TalonSoft; the developers aren't driving Ferraris, but they pay the bills while doing something they love. The problem is that sims and adventure games are among the most expensive games THE DARK SIDE Vice President Dale Strang Director of Business Cathy Bendoff SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES For subscription service questions, address changes or ordering information, call (303) 665-8930 within the US and Canada or write cgwneodata.com.

"EMAIL US AT CGWLETTERS@ZD.COM LETTERS Computer Gaming and Real Violence he June cover is a very unfortunate coincidence. With the Littleton, Colorado, tragedy very fresh in all of our minds, the image of a ruthless gunman in a black coat in what appears to be a public hallway can only serve to be an unpleasant and painful reminder to many, including myself. The caption, \"Playing G.O.D.,\" only makes it harder to look at. I know what G.O.D. means and you know what it means (Gathering of Developers), but nongame players probably will not, nor will they care. I respect and admire your editorial staff, and enjoy your publication very much. I feel that you show respect for your audience, and demonstrate consistently good editorial judgment. While I know that magazine preparation times are long, and this issue went to press many weeks, if not months, before the events of last week, it may be time for the gaming industry as a whole to look pretty hard in the mirror of public opinion and, at the very least, leave these types of images to the inside of products (be they magazines or box art; many of the ads, over which you have no control, are as unpleasant). In no way do I condemn you, other magazines, game developers and publishers, or the gaming public. The games did not cause this tragedy, any more than the guns killed those people. Twisted minds did. If the gaming industry wants to avoid increased scrutiny, regulation, and censorship, however, a little self-restraint may be in order. The time, in my opinion, is now. Brian Fitzpatrick Via the Internet OMPUTER GAMING 60-. the shooting. Despite that, we apologize to any. one who was offended by the image. Please see Johnny Wilson's editorial this month for more on the issue of violence in computer gaming. +501 CHEATS REL In the wake of the Littleton, Colorado, tragedy that claimed the lives of 15 people, including the two gunmen, it is eerie that your magazine's cover depicts the upcoming game from G.O.D. with a young-looking character firing off rounds towards the reader. Now I know that neither your magazine nor the G.O.D. developers could've possibly foreseen the tragedy at Littleton, but what I would like to make a point about is the renewed attack on our hobby by those who think the games we play push kids to violence. It is no secret that some of these games are brutal, with shooting, blood, and gore as the order of the day. I am 31 years old. and I admit to being a first-person shooter addict, but somewhere along the line in my upbringing, my parents taught me the difference between right and wrong. I fear that this is sorely lacking in today's society. We play these games as a matter of escape from reality, to perhaps relieve stress or take on the persona of someone we know we'll never end up being. As parents, friends, and peers, we must continue to remind our children and each other that these, after all, are just games....and not blueprints to test the boundaries of reality. Rick Perry Via the Internet makes fun of God?\" Also, when flipped through the pages of this issue, it amazed me how graphic the violent images have gotten.! wonder if the boys in Colorado read your magazine and played the horrible games that the computer industry is now publishing. It amazed me when one of your reviewers a couple of issues back said that he was giving a game a lower rating because it was not graphic enough in its portrayal of violence (not enough giblet factor I believe was the way he put it). A few pages into your latest issue, an ad read... \"Why not kill your friends for $50,000? You can always buy new ones.\" It is this type of insensitivity that will lead many kids to copy the acts of the ones in Colorado. I hope that someone in your industry will help do something to address the violence issue before more kids suffer the same fate as those in Littleton. John Dyer Via the Internet HEROES III Missing Page Debacle I just got the June issue of CGW. After digesting the latest from Loyd Case, I headed for the Strategy/Wargames review section and found a page missing. The HEROES OF MIGHT & MAGIC Ill review starts on page 170, according to the index, but page 170 has an ad for GameSpot on it.... It would be fair to say that this is a collector's edition of your magazine. Gregory Wells Via the Internet OF UGAN I have been reading your magazine for several years now, and it is with a very heavy heart that I ask you to cancel my subscription The latest issue of your magazine offended me and my family greatly. My seven-year-old son asked me: \"What does this mean... 'Playing G.O.D.'?... Why are you reading a magazine that We received many letters about our June cover in light of the tragedy in Colorado. Needless to say, we were shocked and horrified, like the rest of the world, by those events, and sincerely apologize to anyone who perceived a resemblance between our cover and that tragedy. For what it's worth, readers should know that the image depicts a federal agent firing a gun in a New York City subway. The cover was created and sent to our print er weeks before the events in Littleton, and it was mailed to subscribers on April 19-one day before Yes! It was the special Collector's Edition, worth lots and lots of money! Tell your friends. Actually, this was a mistake made by the people who print our magazine. You can imagine how thrilled we were. In any event, the full review appears in this issue.

Your article never fails to bring a smile and a chuckle to me. Ron, however, is wrong or just doesn't get the point. Your articles do have a point and a great point at that.

"THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Edited by jeff_green@zd.com SCOOP! ! ! Half-Life: R E A D . ME Opposing Force Experience HALF-LIFE Through the Eyes of the Â«Evil Empire\" HALF-LIFE not only garnered a batch of awards last year but also delivered a message that scientists can kick marine butt when forced to. But it did have the military guys doing some cool tricks-like rappeling from skylights-that the scientist protagonist, Gordon Freeman, couldn't do. Now, thanks to Gearbox Software, you'll be able to experience the game from the other side of the battle as a marine-in the upcoming HALF-LIFE expansion pack, OPPOSING FORCE. Fresh from the cancellation of PRAX WAR, the Gearbox team was ready to handle another military-theme game, and HALF-LIFE developers Valve Software gave them their blessing to do the expansion pack. Since the expansion game's time frame is the same as that of the original HALF-LIFE, Gearbox's Randy Pitchford (lead designer) has been meeting with key Valve personnel like Marc Laidlaw (writer) and Harry Teasley (design and mod guru) to make sure that OPPOSING FORCE fits in with the original game. The expansion will bring in seven new weapons and a whole new race of aliens taking part in the invasion of Xen. Gordon Freeman's trusty crowbar has been replaced by a pipe wrench capable of shattering the large, unbreakable crates from the previous game. Also, much like the original game's snarks, there will be another alien-turned-weapon: those pesky barnacles that waited up in the ceiling to pull you or your friend up into their mouths with their tentacles. Now you can carry one around and use it as a biological grappling hook on both people and walls. As for new enemies, you will discover another race of aliens, dubbed Race X, who become involved in the whole Xen/Border Worlds conflict. The design team is adding such new features as two-way radios for marines; they're also allowing marines to cut down doors that are in their way and letting players rappel down from heights. While the Gearbox crew isn't promising new multiplayer modes, they've tapped their contacts in the 3D industry and come up with choice designers to prepare some multiplayer maps. A HALF-LIFE deathmatch level made by levelord? We can't confirm, but it's not a stretch.

Computer Gaming World hopes to cover both the news and viewpoints sur. rounding this deeply complex story in upcoming issues. Violent Computer Games Under Attack Computer gaming is under attack once Vagain as lawmakers, psychologists, and others debate the relationship between violent games and real acts of violence among teens. In April, the parents of three slain Kentucky teenagers filed a $130 million lawsuit against a group of game companies and other media outlets, blaming the influence of media violence for inspiring the December 1, 1997, incident in Paducah, Kentucky, in which a 14-year-old boy brought six guns to his high school and opened fire. The boy's computer, seized by police, contained a number of games, such as DOOM and QUAKE. Named in the suit were Acclaim, Activision, Apogee, Atari, Capcom, Eidos, GT Interactive, id, Interplay, Midway, Nintendo, Sega, Sony, and Squaresoft. As we went to press, the horrific mas. sacre at Columbine High School in Colorado prompted Pennsylvania state senator Jack Wagner to introduce legislation making it an offense to sell or rent violent video games WARBIRDS Developers Fly the Coop On Friday, April 23, a resignation was tendered by the entire Grapevine, Texas-based I-Magic Online development group. A team member told CGW that although slated to relocate to Interactive Magic's North Carolina headquarters, they decided instead to stay in Texas to form their own game design company, Playnet. A source close to I-Magic told us that the parting is amicable, and that the Grapevine group was working with IMagic and former MPG-Net staffers to ease the transition of development to the North Carolina offices.

Like Havas Interactive, another French gaming company, Infogrames is serious about expanding its base in the United States, so the appeal of Accolade is obvious. Accolade, meanwhile, is in desperate need of a hit with SLAVE ZERO, as its most high-profile franchises have fallen on hard times in the last couple of years, following a series of mediocre releases. 2.

Yes, the fish pen, submitted by Sierra Sports to plug their new TROPHY BASS 3D, is definitive proof that a tchotchke doesn't have to necessarily be big, or flashy, or even remotely cool, to win CGW's prestigious Tchotchke of the Month award. The fish pen receives the honor not just because the idea that a gaming editor might actually want to write with this is a remarkably odd one, even for gaming marketing weasels, but also because it quite poignantly symbolizes what has become of the sporting giant that Sierra once was.

The point is, the fact that something isn't hugely popular doesn't mean it sucks (and being the winner of CGW's 1998 Action Game of the Year award is definitely somewhere north of sucks). Adding to the unique action/strategy gameplay of the original in nearly every way, the exclusive pre-alpha build of BATTLEZONE II (BZ2) that CGW editors have been playing over the last couple of weeks not only doesn't suck, it may even be our first valid candidate for 1999 Action Game of the Year.

One of these worlds, Myer, is populated with fire red and orange trees, bubbling opalescent pools of goo, and lumbering plucked-chicken-asaurs. The creatures actually have an effect on gameplay, preying on pilots on foot. According to Pandemic, this was done as a balancing move to counteract the power a pilot on foot has with a sniper rifle. Too many people were just bailing out of their tanks and sniping enemy craft from afar. Now you'll have to worry about getting devoured out in the open. BATTLEZONE's interface was one of the elements that made that game great, and BZ2 uses essentially the same command system, but with some small yet significant changes. The developers decided that what was really missing in the command interface was the ability to easily control groups of friendly vehicles. Support craft are now automatically hot-keyed as individuals and groups. This makes it quicker and easier to issue commands to your ships in the field, which in turn should make it much Baby, You Can Drive My Tank Among the cooler aspects of BATTLEZONE were the vehicles. The Grizzly tank, the scout, and other various hover-vehicles offered a cool combination of futuristic technology and coldwar design. Well, the Grizzly's back, (this year's model anyway), and it's joined by over 30 new vehicles sporting brand-new physics engines that are built to travel over land, air, and sea. Before you get too excited at the prospect of piloting aircraft, understand that the two craft capable of flight, the bomber and the armored personnel carrier, aren't player-controlled. Instead, they swoop in when ordered to deliver either footsoldiers or a load of bombs to a target area. The troops you deploy will be able to carry 25 different weapons, including mortars and bazookas. Ground vehicles are divided into three cate. gories: hovering, tracked, and biped.

Those vehicles won't be able to cross water or other obstacles that a hover-tank would glide right over, although the increased ability of the construction bots allows you to build bridges to overcome water obstacles.

They'll utilize skeletal animations and process\" animation (where movement is defined not by a human programmer but through mathematical operations that adhere closely to the physics model). This time around, water will be playing a big role, so naturally there will be vehicles that travel exclusively underwater. A scout sub is modeled on the build we saw, and it looked really cool. The vehicles controlled by the alien force, the Scion, look more, well, alien, and they are based on a development tree entirely different from that of the ISDF. Most of them will be able to transform into a different ship, with different weapons, physics, and other characteristics. For instance, a Scion tank will be able to morph into a scout They are also working on some anti-cheat measures to prevent online players from flooding their own ranks with, say, mortar bikes, to give themselves an advantage.

"SNEAK PREVIEWS nne McCaffrey had the right idea when she decided to write books about riding A dragons as opposed to merely slaying them. Dragons have traditionally been presented in fantasy works as powerful enemies that you had to kill. But most people I know would rather have control over a dragon than vanquish it. Now DRAKAN: ORDER OF THE FLAME, the first game from Surreal Software, gives gamers a chance to experience the rush of riding and controlling a dragon. DRAKAN began life at Surreal as a technology demo of an underwater scuba diving game. Then, perhaps as a result of playing too much DUNGEON KEEPER, the developers came up with the idea of a game in which you could be a flying dragon. Their underwater-game engine seemed perfect for it. But an engine, however sexy, does not by itself make for a compelling game. So DRAKAN spins a story in which you play Rynn, a beautiful warrior girl who ends up on a fantastic and dangerous quest to find her destiny and her family. One evening, Rynn and her little brother, Dylan, are walking home to their village when suddenly they are ambushed by a group of fierce, growling Wartoks. Drawing swords, Rynn and Dylan slay a few Wartoks, only to have the match end when the few remaining beasts charge and knock Rynn to the ground, leaving her for dead. When Rynn awakens, her brother is nowhere to be found. Returning to her village, she discovers it has been attacked and the villagers have been carried off. A dying village elder tells Rynn of a book that can summon Arokh, the last surviving dragon of the Order. Eventually, Rynn and Arokh go through a bonding ritual to become dragon and rider, and they set off on a quest to discover the fate It's a Matter of Scale in Psygnosis' Gorgeous Dragon Sim Drakan: The six distinct environments that make up the worlds of DRAKAN are stunningly beautiful. Large amounts of detail in the picturesque landscapes make them extremely realistic. The lovely night skies blend effortlessly with the ambient sounds of the forest: chirping crickets, the cries of birds, running water. Everything works together to convey a magical fairy-tale experience. After bonding with Arokh, Rynn follows the trail of her brother's captors, journey ing through a series of winding canyons to discover the Grimstone mines where the villagers have been taken. Emerging on the other side of the mountains, she encounters a lost tropical sea and journeys among its mysterious islands. Eventually she comes to the legendary city of Alwarren, built within the lava tubes of an ancient volcano. Each level seems to provide around two to three hours of play, and more if you really explore them. As you move further into the game the landscapes become wilder and more fantastical. When you move from one to another there is a short pause as the new level loads, but then the action picks right back up. The feeling that you have been pulled into this magical world is never disturbed by static loading screens; even the in-game engine manages to seamlessly convey all the storyline cut-scenes. According to lead programmer Stewart Denman, one of the most interesting aspects of developing the game was the creation of the integrated ground and aerial combat system. Every attempt was made to make it easy to learn but also to allow its depth to be revealed as play progresses. There is a bond between Rynn and Arokh, and this symbiotic relationship is reinforced by the game's controls. Playing DRAKAN should make action gamers feel right at home. There is a mouse-look feature that is a welcome carryover, as demonstrated by HERETIC II, from the first-person genre. Hard-core QUAKE players know that effective use of mouse look is critical for success in combat. DRAKAN is Directinput-friendly, and the game offers a great deal of flexibility in configuring controls. Order of the Flame by Kenneth Johnson of the other villagers and find Dylan. Along the way, Rynn will have to rediscover the lost Order of the Flame and, through her special bond with Arokh, effect its rebirth. Flying High The 3D engine, which delivers a high degree of performance, was designed especially to accommodate scaling. This means you can be hovering high over a forest of tiny trees and then plunge down to swoop in among the branches, and as you get closer, more FASHION SENSE While Rynn is probably as top-heavy as Lara and more detail is Croft, at least she has the sense to wear pants and some prorevealed.

Killing With Dragons, Not Killing Dragons Playing Rynn is lots of fun she's not so much an acrobat, but she's quite the fighter. Not that she can't jump (she can), but DRAKAN's style of gameplay is more oriented toward combat and, when the situation does not favor fighting, the use of stealth. Rynn prefers to travel and fight on dragon-back. She doesn't gain new abilities based on experience; rather, she advances by getting better weapons. There are various magical weapons hidden with in DRAKAN's worlds. Some of them are quite nifty, and each has a special effect, 60 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"Arokh called the War Giant; one step, and squish. The War Giant will pick up and throw anything it can get its hands on, including you. Rynn must sneak past this creature. The Al fires a beam of sight from the eyes of the giant, and he can spot Rynn if she moves into his line-of-sight. DRAKAN delivers fast action, a wondrously deep storyline, and some of the most immersive and beautiful 3D environments yet to appear in a game. With a few exceptions, most adventure or action games that use a third-person perspective have been disappointing for one reason or another. Either gameplay is clichÃ©d or camera control is awkward; often there are nightmare levels of repetitive platform jumping. DRAKAN, which at the time of this writing is just about to begin beta testing, could well change all that. We can't wait to see if this is the game that breathes new life into the third-person genre, upping the ante for what we'll come to expect from such games in the future. CGW COUNTRY BUMPKIN This country-dwelling giant that Rynn is sneaking up to may look pretty big now, but he's nothing compared to his city-dwelling cousin, the War Giant like a sword wreathed in flames that ignites the creature it hits for added burn damage. The names, from John the Monster's Axe to Stewart's Hammer, add a lot of flavor as well. Aerial combat is a blast-literally. Arokh has a variety of breath spells beyond basic fire breathing, including ice and poison gas. The flight model is designed to seem natural and to minimize disorientation. The dragon is a more stable firing platform when he is hovering than when moving, but circle strafing seems very effective against flying monsters like other dragons and giant insects. Arokh is susceptible to environmental effects; occasionally he'll be blown around by updrafts, for example. DRAKAN supports multiplayer deathmatch action for up to eight players over a LAN or the Internet The monsters can cooperate with each other in combat. If a lone Wartok sights Rynn he may go and get other Wartoks and come back with them. Wartoks can also exhibit degrees of alarm.

"CRORE Can Empire's Korean War Sim Challenge FALCON 4.0? 8. SNEAK PREVIEW Mig Alley. 16 20 0 0 CAP Target Chosan by Denny Atkin Sinanjur Poad Army Eestir t was the pinnacle of the dogfight. The Korean War was the last of the pre-missile aerial conflicts, where getting a kill required the talent to get behind your enemy and stay there long enough to pump his airplane full of deadly lead. Unlike previous conflicts, much of the fighting involved jets on both sides, with chases at times pushing the sound barrier. Despite the unique and exciting nature of the conflict, however, it's rarely been visited in computer games. Now Empire and FLYING CORPS developer Rowan Software are giving the Korean conflict the attention it deserves with MIG ALLEY, a sim that looks set to challenge FALCON 4.0 in depth and CHUCK YEAGER'S AIR COMBAT in excitement. ROCKET MAN Although outdated as a fighter, the F-80 is an effective ground-attack aircraft. include flame-outs, wind effects, spins, airframe stress, external store drag and weight, torque/slipstreaming, and spool-up time. The sim features virtual, 3D cockpits, rather than fixed bitmaps, that are replete with detail. Canopy reflections (which, although they've been appropriated by other sims, first appeared in an early MIG ALLEY screen shot) are particularly impressive, and they help you stay oriented when using padlock view. A full complement of scrolling and snap views helps maintain situational awareness. You'll be able to adjust target size to make up for the limited detail of the computer screen if you so choose, and toggle realistically restricted views, peripheral vision cues, and automatic padlocking. Aces Over the Yalu Covering the entire course of the Korean War MIG ALLEY lets you fly for either side. On the United States side, you'll be able to take the controls of the F-51D Mustang, F-80 Shooting Star, F-84 Thunderjet, and the F86A, F-86E, and F-86F Sabres. Other Allied aircraft, such as F9F Panthers, A-1 Skyraiders, B-29 Superfortresses, and Gloster Meteors, will also make appearances, but they aren't player-flyable. If you choose to fly for the forces of Communism, you'll be able to support your comrades flying the MiG-15 and the improved MiG-15bis. The sim's flight models have a good feel; accelerated stalls, spins, and energy bleed are well recreated, for example. But what's particularly impressive is the subtlety of the modelPULL OUT Two F-80s pull up after bombing a ing. Early jet engines were North Korean ground formation. slow at spooling up to power, a characteristic that killed more than a few experienced pilots. That's modeled here, as are aircraft-specific characteristics such as the MiG-15's deadly double-spiral spin. For even deeper \"feel,\" MIG ALLEY supports force-feedback joysticks. The early alpha version didn't yet have simplified flight models, but in the final release you'll be able to tune individual aspects of the model to best suit your flying prowess and experience. For example, if you're a beginner you'll be able to not only disable departures from controlled flight but also activate an autothrottle feature that will help you stay behind your target. Other options Mig Alley GENRE: Simulation. RELEASE DATE: 03 '99. DEVELOPER: Rowan  PUBLISHER: Empire Interactive Sightseeing Aircraft models are sharp, with detailed textures, moving control surfaces, and intricately modeled landing gear and speed brakes. Damage textures will indicate bullet hits on your jet and the enemy. The graphics engine has seen a complete rewrite since FLYING CORPS. With rolling hills and a wide variety of textures, it loses the \"photo on a tabletop\" feel of the earlier sim. Details abound, including roadways, bridges, buildings, and nicely textured runways. Terrain is based on actual aerial photography from the era as well as on later satellite imagery. In addition to a wide variety of aerial targets, you'll find a ground war going on as well. Tanks and other vehicles are there now, and the developers promise that you'll be able to see individual soldiers scattering across the battlefield. Although special effects were still preliminary in the version I flew, Rowan promises impressive effects in the final version, including rocket smoke, tracers, and napalm explosions. One very welcome feature that I was unable to test in the alpha version was a flight recorder, which will let you replay your combat missions.

"Your Chance and choked the engines, rendering expensive machines of war use. less hunks of metal. Soldiers fought in the desolate expanses of desert, hundreds of miles from supplies of ammo and water. North Africa during WWII was an unforgiving, inhospitable battlefield. Now Dynamix is giving you the opportunity to battle over this theater in DESERT FIGHTERS. to kick Rommel's SNEAK PREVIEWS Nazi Butt out of North Africa by Denny Atkin It certainly doesn't sound glamorous, but the North African \"Battle of Supplies\" lends itself to a very strategic campaign, one where the sim's designers can cause individual pilots' actions to have a realistic effect on the progress of the war. In most circumstances a single mission having dramatic effects on the outcome of a campaign is pretty unrealistic, unless you happen to shoot down Yamamoto or Goering. But taking out a supply convoy or shooting down a couple of loaded transport planes can cripple a force that's pushing its lines through the deep desert, cutting off vital fuel, ammo, parts, and rations. DESERT FIGHTERS features a dynamic campaign that tracks the progress of the war based on this supply-line theory. The types of missions generated and units encountered are based on the current supply levels on each side. Wipe out a series of enemy convoys and you'll likely face reduced opposition. But if your own supply lines start to get stretched out, expect to see fewer aircraft fielded on your own side. You can enter the campaign at four points in the war. Depending on which you choose, you'll fly 50 to 200 missions. When you're ready to fly, you'll be presented with an assortment of available campaign missions. Sortie types include sweep, offensive and defensive patrols, combat air patrol, scramble, and close support. You'll be tasked with escorting light and heavy bomber raids, recon craft, mine-laying planes, and close-support aircraft. At times, you'll be tasked with interdicting supplies, communications, or infrastructure targets. There's no mission editing here--the sim puts you in the role of a pilot without planning responsibilities. Look for a variety of ground targets, including rail and vehicle bridges, mechanized columns, warship convoys, tanks, railroad stations and marshalling yards, radar sites, infantry, and seaplane launches. And while most of the existing WWII sims feature missions in which the only enemies you encounter are associated with your mission, here you'll be able to look forward to plenty of random encounters. While flying, you may run into enemy fighters engaged with allied bombers, friendly aircraft attacking ground targets, or even vulnerable enemy subs resupplying on the surface next to a tender ship. Of course, if you're learning the sim and not ready to commit to a 50mission tour, you can fly single missions as well. These are generated by the campaign engine (you'll be able to adjust many settings, such as the types of missions and planes in the air, as in the ACES games), so you'll find lots of replayability here. Desert Fighter's Coordinated Attacks DESERT FIGHTERS is slated to feature a robust set of multiplayer options. Melee and Team Melee games give players points for shooting down other players and destroying ground targets. King of the Hill is basically a game of tag. The \"king\" can score points for shooting down other aircraft. Other players become king (there will be one king for every eight fliers) by shooting down the current king. In the Courier game, one player on one team is given the task of being the courier, and will be told to fly to a specific airfield to land. After landing, the pilot can rearm and refuel, and then he'll be given a new target to fly to. Each successful landing scores points for your team. Nobody else, friend or enemy, knows who the courier is, so he can choose to tell his buddies and have them fly escort or go it alone and let the others distract the enemy.

In this case, Interactive Magic's FLASH POINT seems designed to reach the fast-growing action-strategy market. The premise is that World War III has become a reality. In the aftermath of bunuclear attacks by both sides in the war, the planet has been reduced to a wasteland, except for a series of islands named Abel, Cain, and Eden. Now, the two sides have agreed to fight a nice, traditional war on these islands, and whoever wins the battle wins the primo living space. You'll be fighting in one of two dynamic campaigns in which the mission types vary based on your performance rather than follow a pre-scripted plan. You might begin with a simple reconnaissance mission; once it is complete, your orders will be updated. In some missions you hold a piece of land in others you storm in and capture a fuel dump or vital road junction. Since the missions take place all over an island, there's a time-compression option for traveling, in case you don't want to sit down in a jeep and go through the entire ride in realtime. You start off as a lowly grunt taking orders. As you progress in rank, your power increases in a couple of ways. One is that you'll be able to pilot or drive some of the many vehicles employed by the side you're fighting for. I didn't get to see a real flight model when I sampled the A-10 in the alpha build, but when it's added it should be a bonus feature for anyone who plays both sims and action-strategy games.

Developers at EA are well aware of that, judging from a feature they're introducing in the next NEED FOR SPEED game. Sure, it's pretty thrilling to be chased by cops while driving a Lamborghini Diablo, but what if you weren't invincible? What if you had something on the line besides a record? That's the premise behind NEED FOR SPEED: HIGH STAKES (NFS: HS). There are two significant additions in NFS: HS: the damage model and the Career Play mode. Remember the times when you'd let yourself bounce off a wall and keep on driving? Well, you might want to start avoiding that, because now you can seriously bang up your car. Not only will your car be visibly damaged, but the damage will affect your performance. Of course, for gamers who crave sheer speed without consequences, there's the option of turning the damage model off. The Career Play mode is EA's attempt to personalize the game by requiring that players earn the money needed for their cars. Want that nice McLaren F1? Good luck in saving enough cash and winning enough races to afford it. EA hopes that players become more attached to their cars when they know that they had to earn it and have the ability to modify it after buying it. They even put the player's name on the license plate. In addition to the damage model and Career Play NFS: HS adds a bunch of other enhancements and tweaks. For one thing, there's now a 3D virtual dashboard, to more completely immerse the player in the racing experience. Also, when playing as a cop in Hot Pursuit mode, you can now shift control to another cop car, so if a fellow Al cop gets closer to the suspect, you can take over for him for the finishing touch. Of course, there will also be a new set of cars. Old familiars like Ferrari and Lamborghini will be there, along with new faces like Mercedes and BMW. Like its predecessor, NFS: HS will have some bonus cars that we don't yet know about, and after release, EA will offer new cars for download. All in all, EA wasn't content with just tossing in new cars and tracks for their next game; they went the extra mile and added a whole new gameplay mode and damage model. We're glad of that, and we look forward to driving our new wheels when the game hits the streets this July.

"QUAKE III ARENA TEAM FORTRESS 2 UNREAL TOURNAMENT LIBROO AHOES HEA05 by CGW Action Editor, Robert Coffey It's a No-Holds Barred Deathmatch, With Three Bloodthirsty Contenders Trapped in the Ring. We Played the Hottest Upcoming Multiplayer Shooters to See Who's Got the Stones to Survive the Carnage. 10. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1999 "


"Quake III: Arena COVER STORY Can the Once and Future King of DeathMatch Hold Its Throne of Blood? es UAKE games, the undisputed masters of the first-person shooter and the DeathMatch, have always stood hip-deep in the gory offal of their competitors. Repeatedly setting the standard for brutally enthralling action, the demented geniuses of id Software have spawned a rabid community of gamers who revel in the virtual fragging of both friends and strangers across LANs and the Internet. But in the wake of new stars like Valve's HALF-LIFE and id's own surprising decision to focus gameplay strictly on the multiplayer side of the equation. QUAKE III: ARENA (Q3A) is the first id release to beg the question, \"Will it be worth it?\" The short answer? You bet your ass. Quake Arena Genre: Shooter Release Date: Q3 '99 Developer: id Software  Publisher: Activision Team Fortress 2 The Big Picture \"After the multiplayer experience in QUAKE III, nobody will need to play any other multiplayer game. We have created the most perfect DeathMatch game.\" From anyone other than Tim Willits, lead level designer for Q3A, it would be easy to dismiss such a strong statement as little more than careless braggadocio, but given id's track record, such a statement practically borders on prophecy. While forgoing the traditional, story-driven single-player game may seem an incredibly risky move, let's face facts: The plots of the QUAKE games weren't going to win any Pulitzer prizes. In fact, as challenging as the single player component was, many gamers played the games solely against other people, eschewing the solo experience entirely. Recognizing that group carnage was what it does best, id has simply narrowed its focus to make the definitive DeathMatch game. Part of that focus is on facilitating connectivity. According to Todd Hollenshead, id's CEO, when Q3A ships, gamers should be able to connect to an Internet game \"in no more than three clicks\" with the ability to log on to a Quakeworld server through their browser. This will let id use banner information for game updates and will allow gamers to bookmark their favorite servers. Once connectivity is dealt with, the challenge is to keep frustration, specifically game-souring lag time, at bay. By id's own admission, Q3A will use pretty much all the bandwidth of a 56K modem while utilizing a completely new networking structure to milk bandwidth for all it's worth. The good news is that the look of the game won't suffer at the expense of speed. Kenneth Scott and Paul Steed have created character models that are the epitome of the brutish nightmares gamers have come to expect of id. Each of the Genre: Shooter Release Date: Q4 '99 Developer: Valve Publisher: Sierra Studios Unreal Tournament. .85 Genre: Shooter  Release Date: 03 '99 Developer: Epic Games Publisher: GT Interactive "


"Quake III: Arena (continued) COVER STORY 13 models has an 800-, 500-, and 300polygon version, letting the game save bandwidth by swapping in lower-polygon models when figures are at a distance. And hard-core 3D graphics aficionados will be happy to know id has opted for a three-point animation scheme that may not be as flashy as the trendy skeletal animation of other games but blesses players with the most efficient vertex deformation for online play. Finally, id plans for Q3A to standardize the rules for DeathMatch and other games used for tournament play. It's a pretty crafty goal on their part: By becoming the definitive authority on the rules of play, they set Q3A up as the definitive mode of play. The Single-Player Experience The primary goal of Q3A's single-player game is to lessen the intimidation factor of online DeathMatching for newcomers (while the game will ship with Capture the Flag and perhaps some other mods, they won't be available in single-player mode). To that end, the PURPLE HAZE With all the new graphical bells and whistles, QUAKE III: ARENA will be the best-looking id game yet. Even better, gamers will be able to customize some weapon effects, like the purple trail of this rail gun, to give their death-dealing a personal touch. Team Fortress 2 Valve Goes to War in the Follow-Up to HALF-LIFE omeone's going to do it right. Someone's going to get it right. And when they do, it's going to be huge.\" Gabe Newell, managing director of Valve, is certain that rampant online multiplayer gaming is about to sweep not only the gaming community but the nation as well. With the prices on Internet-ready PCs dropping faster than Ally McBeal's weight, Newell and the rest of Valve believe the time is ripe for a multiplayer game to enjoy a level of popularity commensurate with that of television. TEAM FORTRESS 2, Valve's first release following the ground-breaking HALF-LIFE, could just be that game. Getting gamers immediately into the action is paramount, and to that end TF2 sports a WWII feel instantly recognizable to anyone who's ever seen a war movie. A large part of that comes courtesy of maps that really play up the feel of small European towns and villages, with cobblestone streets, narrow roads, snaking alleyways, and a plethora of prime sniping spots. Gamers will choose from a variety of unique classes, including field medics, rocket infantrymen, snipers, spies, and remote commanders who aren't even on the battlefield, to wage war together against teams of other warriors. TF2's gritty and realistic models utilize Intel's MultiResolution Mesh (MRM) technology to create the most lifelike avatars we've seen. These MRMs dynamically scale back a model's polygon count at distances with no discernible loss of quality. By scaling a 1,500-poly model to as little as 400, MRM gives the artists the opportunity to create highly detailed models-complete with swinging gun straps and true 3D gearwithout putting a drag on frame-rate. The MRMs will also allow gamers with less-robust machines to run the The Big Picture The chief goal of TF2 is to get players to run with, to work with, and to rely on their teammates. By providing the uniquely compelling social experience that true teamplay inspires, and by designing a game that will allow even casual players to succeed, the people at Valve are hoping to launch TF2 to the top of the multiplayer heap. 18 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"game has scalable skill levels to ensure that even the clumsiest keyboard player will be able to succeed. But what's truly revolutionary is the way the game handles the escalating challenges of its 40 or so levels. While the bots that solo fraggers will face will increase in difficulty, they are not locked in at a preset difficulty level and will actually adjust dynamically to your skills. Beat a level and the bots on the next one will be tougher. Get stuck long enough on one map and the bots will very gradually dull their skills until they reach a point where you can beat them, while still being challenged. Incentive to finish the game comes in the form of rankings and awards that might be carried over to players' online stats. And while there are no bosses per se, the singleplayer game will include six or seven bots with voices and definite characters that will taunt you mercilessly yet another motivator for players to finish the game. COVER STORY GUERRILLAS IN THE MIST Volumetric fog will give some maps a tense, claustrophobic feel as gamers are concealed from each other until they're at point-blank range. Battling the Bots \"The goal is to piss you off.\" Such is the lofty aspiration of bot programmer John Cash. \"The trick,\" he says, \"is to do it without cheating.\" Designing opponents to behave like unpredictable humans is incredibly challenging, so the temptation for cheating is understandable. But Cash is adamant that his bots not cheat. To that end, he's OPEN WIDE How organic can true curved surfaces make a level appear? How about this doorway, with its zeroing in on creating giant lolling tongue leading to the fanged maw within? bots so human that they don't have to cheat. In order to create believable adversaries, Cash is moving away from the ber-player style of other games' botsbots that never miss, always know where you are, can suddenly increase their speed, and so forthâto programming bot tendencies across a wide range of attributes that affect their behavior. Bots will be rated in aiming skill, map knowledge, long/short-range preference, reaction time, weapon preference, desire for armor, health level priorities, aggression, hearing, and more. At any given moment in a game, the bots will analyze their situation and then decide upon an action according to their attributes. Since the ratings are all soft numbers, the bots will enjoy distinct playing styles while still maintaining a degree of unpredictability. This allows you to adjust to a bot's particular combat style while still requiring you to watch out for unusual behavior. For example, a bot who generally runs scared when injured may suddenly decide to take some extra damage when it thinks it has a shot at finishing you off. The soft ratings also let the game create bots that are challenging in a variety of ways. Easy bots can be bots that never miss but won't react until you're on top of them, or bots who can always find you but never hit you. The rating system gives Q3A one other advantage: the ability to customize bots for practicing against certain skill sets. It's still undecided whether this will require editing a text file or implementation through a menu system, but id is definitely leaning toward allowing gamers to create a digital version of that jerk at the office who always beats you. Cash is abandoning the programming tendency to plot bot movement across a series of waypoints a method that both increases predictability and creates other problems, such as bots that can't handle platforms. Instead, Cash's bots analyze game in a dynamically lower resolution to maintain a high frame-rate for them as well. The model believability even extends to syncing the movement of their mouths with the words of players' voices. And voice support is a huge part of TF2's design. While real-time voice obviously allows for more detailed communication between players, it also is a vital part of the social experience that Valve hopes to create. However, voice won't be just a big sloppy open channel; instead, it will follow a command hierarchy, with only commanders permitted to broadcast teamwide messages. Squad members will fter the incredible experience of HALFnormally be able A LIFE, gamers are understandably hungry to talk only to for a secuel. While Valve isn't saying much each other, but right now, we have it on good authority that a they'll also be small team of about five has already started preable to broadliminary work on what may be the most hotly cast to the entire anticipated sequel since WARCRAFT II. While the team with their scripted events and story interaction were intecommander's gral parts of HALF-LIFE's success, we're told that permission. those were little more than trial balloons for the ambitious game elements HALILAFT 2 will use to startle, scare, and enthrall gamers. We can't wait, HALF-LIFE 2 www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1999 19 "


"Quake III: Arena (continued) COVER STORY fully as HALF-LIFE's tags, the option of immediately letting your victims know who's reducing their skull to gooey pulp can only be a good thing. the map and build data structures that allow them to \"think of a map's rooms and how to get between them; thus bots are able to find paths rather than simply follow them. When we squared off against the bots, we were impressed. Even in their early state, the bots were tricky, using cover and flanking to give one of our best players a real run for the money, even though they were having a few problems dealing with doors and buttons. But with more attention from Cash and additional input from John Carmack to improve the bot tactics, Q3A's bots should be among the best yet. The Playing Field With every new game engine, id has delivered even more impressive levels, and Q3A will be no exception. In fact, with the game's single-minded multiplayer focus the level designers seem to have really cut loose in creating their maps. Sure, they're all dressed up with specular lighting, volumetric fog, and more polygons, but it's the actual design of the arenas that will wow gamers. Freed from the event-driven, linear constraints of standard single-player level design, id is pulling out the stops with levels that run the gamut, including towering multitiered structures, wideopen arenas, and levels with different physics. Circular and repetitive in nature, the maps encourage the kind of frantic running and constant conflict that make for intense DeathMatches. Lava pools and bottomless pits present environmental hazards, but the acceleration ramps and bouncing pads have the greatest impact on gameplay as gamers launch themselves across chasms and over enemies. In addition to ammo, armor, and health power-ups, levels will hold haste and invisibility power-ups, medkits that can be carried for later use, and, of course, the quad damage power-up. Use of these power-ups will be broadcast to all players via an in-game \"announcer\" to help ratchet up the tension and action. But if you're the type of player prone to maxing out your armor and health, be warned: Once either of these attributes exceeds 100, it starts ticking back down immediately. Keeping players from becoming virtually invulnerable makes everyone a ready target and keeps the action moving. FEEL THE POWER Translucent energy webs will distinguish players who've grabbed power-ups like invulnerability or the quad damage. Among the levels we played, two were real standouts. One was a cramped one-onone arena, choked with a toxic green fog. While the drifting haze definitely enhanced the visual appeal of the map, it also created a claustrophobic feeling of dread and uncertainty, since you didn't know where your adversary was until he was right in front of you or until a railgun stream ripped through the murky air. A ledge above the fog held the quad damage, and I'd grimace every time I heard the booming announcement that my opponent had just grabbed it, knowing that he was out there, hidden in the Wielding the Weapons In keeping with Q3A's focus on refining gameplay, there's nothing all that revolutionary happening on the weaponry front. The DOOM chainsaw is back, perfect for those up-close-and-personal humiliation frags, while a machine gun will serve as your default weapon after a respawn. The firing rates and attendant kickback of the grenade and rocket launchers have been increased, while the reload on the railgun is now a little slower. A slightly changed QUAKE-style lightning gun makes an appearance, the hyperblaster has been revamped as a plasma gun with explosive charges, and the BFG is back and nasty as ever. The most tantalizing possibility centers around the potential inclusion of a flamethrower. We can only hope that this baby makes it in. One option we expect gamers to embrace is the ability to customize the color of their railgun and (possibly) rocket trails. While this won't give gamers the opportunity to express themselves as Team Fortres (conuinte) Valve's aim here is to avoid cluttering bandwidth with a cacophony of voices and to prevent the game from turning into a 900 number with guns. And if the TF2 developers have any bottom line in mind, it's the game's social experience. Over the next several months the designers will be observing TEAM FORTRESS CLASSIC closely, seeing what works, what doesn't work, and how the rules change according to the number of players. One observation has already led to a significant addition to TF2-after watching more-experienced players literally stand over the shoulders of newbies and offer advice, Valve added the Coach role. Coaches will be heard only by a specific player in the game and will appear as a glowing ball on that player's screen, allowing the Coach HOUSES OF THE UNHOLY Q3A maps run the gamut, from wideopen, rocket-friendly arenas to more closed-in quarters with lots of hallways and staggered levels. So How Does It Play? Dizzyingly fast, wickedly brutal, and just flat-out gorgeous, QUAKE III: ARENA IS a better game in a beta state than many games sitting on store shelves. The game plays at a scorching speed more akin to QUAKE than QUAKE II, and the wildly imaginative level design only enhances the sense of mayhem. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

The Single-Player Experience While it won't provide a single-player game per se, TF2 will feature boot camp-style training missions for every character class, introducing more complicated game elements gradually. For example, a training mission for a spy might require the player to disguise himself, infiltrate an enemy base, then shoot a specific enemy in the back using the spy's silenced pistol. Interface issues will be explained as well, eventually even teaching players how to bind macros to hot-keys. For gamers hungry for more practice or who lack modems, TF2 can be played with bots. For most maps, players can practice taking orders from an Al commander or, alternatively, lead a squad of bots to victory.

"Continued from Page 81 Team Fortress 2 (continteri) Unreal Tournament Can the World's Prettiest Shooter Frag With the Big Boys? COVER STORY Basically, the Al will be based on a learning design, in which the artificial combatants learn from their mistakes and successes. For instance, an engineer bot will build sentry guns and then track the amount of time until each is destroyed, how many kills it achieved, where the enemy is, and so forth. After building sentry guns in a variety of locations, the bot will pick the best location for its defenses almost every time. This learning Al is interesting because it will be incorporated into every player's individual game as well, charting their success and offering suggestions onscreen to improve their play. As players improve, the ghost bot will offer fewer and fewer pointers. Teams will be able to practice against teams of bots, and bots can be used to round out teams short on members. Should a new player log on, one of the bots will drop out to make room; conversely, players who drop out of games will be replaceable by bots. es, UNREAL was jaw-droppingly gorgeous. But the only eye-candy that die-hard deathmatch devotees care about is the sight of an oppoinent's blood greasing the floor. With its poor network performance and a multiplayer experience that never quite satisfied, UNREAL deathmatching was skewered by critics. Gamers simply stuck with the solo game, UNREAL'S multiplayer failing to capture their hearts and trigger fingers even on those rare occasions when they could get an online game to run more than five minutes. Saddled with such a lackluster legacy, you've got to hand it to Epic Games' developers for taking on the challenge of making the UNREAL line a contender in the multiplayer world. Wielding the Weapons Unlike other games, TF2 designs around roles, not weapons. This means that while there are various types of weapons, players will be limited to those tied to their class. The idea is that by MEAN STREETS House-tohouse fighting in war-torn villages means potentially fatal confrontations can be just around the corner. The Big Picture UNREAL TOURNAMENT hopes to blow away gamers' lingering reservations with fast, thunderous gameplay-a style of play lacking in the original. The game can be played at a default speed that is fairly swift, but the truly ambitious will have the option to play at a much faster \"hardcore\" setting as well as the dizzyingly fast \"turbo\" rate. In addition to upgrading the speed, players can adjust settings to increase the effectiveness and damage capability of bots in practice matches. The violence quotient has been ratcheted up as well, with every successful hit accompanied by copious sprays of blood. Slain enemies go limp, then delicately spin and flutter to the floor, but we suspect that gamers will be more entranced by the special death animations, which are like nothing else in gaming. Score a killing blow to an opponent's head and you might rip 20 pounds of needPOP TOP Zoom and boom, less flesh from your victim, leaving baby.

The Single-Player Experience While UNREAL TOURNAMENT forgoes the traditional, story-based single-player game, it does have a sort of ensuring everyone has something they do well along with some significant weaknesses, they'll motivate players to work together again underscoring the social nature of the game. Heavy infantry will wield enormous chainguns that are deadly at long range, while the light infantry's submachine gun will be devastating in close quarters.

"nternet Audio GAMING EDITORS' CHOICE Playing games over the Internet has put a premium on typing skillâpeople who type faster can more quickly communicate with human opponents or teammates. But with the upcoming generation of voice communication software, typing skill becomes superfluous, and a whole new social element is layered on top of multiplayer gaming. During testing, we wound up on a TEAM FORTRESS CLASSIC (HALF-LIFE) server where we found ourselves outgunned by our anonymous opponents on the Canalzone2 map. Yet we managed to hold our own pretty well-because we could work as a team, and talk to each other. None of the packages reviewed here work perfectly, but even with their flaws, the increase in efficiency of teamwork was astonishing. We took a look at two shipping voice-comm packagesShadowfactor's BattleCom and ThrustMaster's Talk n' Playand Roger Wilco, which was still in beta. Of the two shipping products, BattleCom worked much better for gaming. It's a sophisticated voice-comm package that's also well suited for conferencing. ThrustMaster's Talk n' Play seems more exclusively geared for conferencing. Roger Wilco looks-er, sounds-very promising. But as with any product that requires bandwidth over the Net, your mileage will vary. Shadowfactor and conferencing application.

TNP can access your sound card using either Wave or DirectSound mode; we tested first using the latter mode, figuring it would enable TNP to more easily share sound card resources. It turned out that neither mode allowed TNP to function alongside all our test games. TNP connected fine in all instances before getting into any of the test games, but in HALF-LIFE, for example, once the game started we lost the TNP connection. The one test game where the connection remained was FIGHTER SQUADRON, where TNP performed adequately. Another minor downside to TNP is that it requires an Internet connection in order to function, since the initial connection must be made either via the TNP Web site or through the PeopleLink server, so LAN play is not an option. ThrustMaster may have figured that since Intel's Multi-Point Audio could access the sound card via DirectSound, TNP would naturally work well with DirectSound games. But it appears that they didn't do much play-testing with audio-intensive games before shipping the product. The result is substandard game compatibility, which, coupled with TNP's somewhat clumsy user interface, keeps Talk n' Play out of the winner's circle. Getting Blather-Ready etting up voice communication requires some understanding of the Windows mixer. When you first pop up the mixer, you normally see the playback mixer. You want the microphone muted in the playback mixer-otherwise, you hear yourself talking through your headphones or speakers, which can cause annoying feedback. Bring up the recording mixer (see screen below). You do this by pulling down the Properties menu on the Mixer menu. You'll get a window that looks very similar to the playback mixer. Make sure the microphone record volume is turned up at least halfway. Once you've got the mixer properly set up, you need to configure the voice-comm software. BattleCom has a more detailed and somewhat confusing setup wizard. Roger your IP address. One feature lacking in the beta we tested was the loopback test that's part of BattleComâwith Roger Wilco there's no real way of knowing whether your connection is working until you try to make a real connection. Game performance was something of a mixed bag. HALF-LIFE once again demonstrated that it's a bandwidth-hungry game, and voice communication broke up in heavy sessions. AGE OF EMPIRES seemed to work just fine. EVERQUEST exhibited the oddest behavior: After about a half hour of gameplay, the voice communication slowly degraded until it was unintelligible. Only restarting both the game and Roger Wilco seemed to fix the problem. Roger Wilco's performance over standard analog modems seems mixed, too, with good results in less demanding games but significant problems in bandwidth-hungry titles. Like BattleCom, Roger Wilco supports both \"push to talk\" (PTT) and voice-activated mode. While talking in PTT mode you have to press and hold down a key on the keyboard (both programs default to F12). This emulates the behavior of real two-way radio communication, and a lot of flight sim jockeys love it. Voice activation is just that when you talk, the mike detects it and becomes active. This is the preferred mode for 3D shooters and strategy games. Still, this is beta software, although it seems pretty solid for a beta product. At $24.95, it's the same cost as BattleCom. The trade-off is simplicity versus features. We'll revisit Roger Wilco when it ships, but we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far. CGW B.

It's simpler to install and set up than the other two packages here, but some of the complexity is merely hidden. For example, some games require you to edit a configuration file called GAMES.TXT, whereas BattleCom provides a point-and-click interface integrated into the software for the same function. Wilco has no compression settingsâthe program either works with a single form of compression or auto-adjusts to your link. Roger Wilco also doesn't require a server, but if you host a session, you need to supply = Vi vil How We Tested esting these packages involved many arduous hours of multiplayer gameplay...er... testing. We used multiple games with each package. We tested using HALF-LIFE, FIGHTER SQUADRON, EVERQUEST, AIR WARRIOR, and AGE OF EMPIRES. We also looked at each package's ability to function over a local area network (LAN) and took a look at its ability to support multiple protocols (all support TCP/IP. and BattleCom supports IPX). We then tested over 33.6 Kbps modem connections to force the apps to function in a narrow data pipe to see how'd they fare. Next, we took a look at how easy it was to configure the audio settings, as well as how easy or difficult it was to get a session going. And finally, the hard part: play-testing during multiplayer games to see how well the packages cooperated with our test games. Wilco's is simpler, but you don't have the ability to force any configurations. All the products go through a microphone test phase-make sure this test completes successfully. If you're the host, you'll need to let the other participants know your IP address. If you're using a dial-up account, your IP address will change every time you log on to the Internet. You can get your IP address by clicking on the Start menu, selecting Run, and typing WINIPCFG.

You live in 737s, making puddlejumps on business so often you could probably land the damn plane if called upon. And despite your hectic schedule, you still find yourself with thumb-twiddling time while en route to your next stop. If only that laptop could play 3D games... Sound familiar? Mobile PC gamers have been locked out of the 3D gaming party until recently. But thanks to a few new laptops, 3D gaming has finally arrived for the mobile set. Micron, with their Transport NX, is the latest to join this club, coupling good 3D gaming performance from ATI's Rage LT mobile chipset (based on the Rage Turbo Pro) with 4MB of video memory, a 366MHz Pentium II, a DVD player, 128MB of RAM, and 14GB of hard-drive space, all for about $3,700. ATI's Rage LT--the chipset that finally made 3D gaming really possible on laptops--also shows up in mobile offerings from Dell and Compaq We took a beta unit of Micron's new NX for a spin, and were encouraged by what we saw. Graphics drivers were still a bit shaky, which resulted in some crashes, but hey, that's why they call it beta. Running QUAKE 2 at 640x480, the NX was very smooth, and gameplay flowed well. But almost as cool as competent 3D is the ability to watch DVD movies. How many times have you boarded a five-hour flight, only to find out the in-flight movie was going to be something toothless like My Giant? With the onboard DVD, you can watch whatever movie you want to. Eat it, Billy... Micron was in the latter part of their beta testing of the NX at press time, but stay tuned and as soon as it goes final, we'll bang on it with 3D GameGauge 2.0 and see how it fares versus the big boys on the desktop.-Dave Salvator es corbeid Take a silly tchotchke (the gas mask from FALLOUT 2), an even sillier product (the UR Gear Helmet), and hold an intern at gunpoint, and this is what you wind up with.

Concel When running 3D graphics on a fast PC play around with the refresh rate a bit at a particular resolution. Depending on the game and your system, this can make quite a difference in frame-rate. If your graphics card is just missing the next scan line, then it could cut your frame-rate by as much as 50 percent. Note that the sweet spot for the refresh rate may vary according to resolution, game, and color depth. If you want a single number, 60Hz works most of the time, but it's pretty hard on your eyes. A few accelerators, such as 3dfx cards, allow you to differentiate between 3D refresh rates and Windows 2D refresh rates. allows you to alter the clock rate of your graphics chip (but do take great care in doing thisâyou could render your system unbootable with the wrong setting). One nice feature is the ability to set refresh rates for all resolutions without having to actually switch resolutions. 98 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"The Sound and the Fury....... Like graphics accelerators, the new generation of 3D audio accelerators is much more sophisticated than past sound cards. The result has been something of a driver-du-jour phenomenon there, too, though not quite as drastic. Still, check to see if your drivers have been updated. For example, I've seen a steady drop in the CPU utilization of the Diamond Monster Sound MX300 over several driver releases. Creative Labs is steadily introducing new features in their driver updates, so those are worth a download, too.

Semplice ed ett Shift Condo Reco DU CategicoRETTA Express Mice Cool Platter Chatter....... limit the size of VCACHE. You do this by editing the file \\windows system.ini. Search for VCACHE-you'll probably find it as a header with no entries underneath. Ideally, you'd like VCACHE to be about one-fourth of your system RAM up to 64MB. If you have more than 64MB, leave it at 16MB. The key is to make it a fixed number for minimum and maximum. Add the following two items underneath the VCACHE heading: Before you read any further, go to your PC, turn it on, and defrag your hard drive. You can use the Windows 98 defrag utility. If you happen to have Norton Utilities, and you use Norton Speedisk, you can set it up to move your files around for optimal startup. But the important thing is to simply defrag once a month or so. If you've been using Windows 98 for a while, you may notice that your disk drive will start thrashing like a freshly caught catfish at seemingly random intervals. It's disconcerting to say the least, and a serious performance drag at times. There are actually several potential causes for this. First, if you have Microsoft Office 95 or 97 installed, make sure you remove the Fast Find utility from the startup folder. Fast Find periodically indexes the hard drive so it can search for files faster. Unfortunately, I've seen Fast Find do this at really inconvenient times. Another possible cause of disk thrashing is that Windows 98 will occasionally grow or shrink the swap file (virtual memory file) according to some mysterious algorithm that seems to depend on the alignment of the planets. You can stop this from happening by setting the maximum and minimum swap file sizes to the same number. A conservative rule of thumb is to set it to 2.5x your installed memory-though if you have more than 128MB, 1.5 to 2x is more than enough. This will create a permanent swap file that won't grow or shrink. After you've done this, and then rebooted, you'll want to defrag one more time. Note that if you have two physical hard drives, putting the swap file on the second (non-boot) hard drive can also speed up access to virtual memory. Do not do this if you have a single physical drive with two partitions. Finally, one other culprit is Windows 98's disk cache. In the old days, you had SMARTDRV, but that's long since been replaced by VCACHE. VCACHE is a program that caches hard-drive data in system memory. Occasionally, VCACHE can get pretty big. This can have two simultaneous adverse effects. First, you have less memory for your programs. Second, the disk will begin to thrash as VCACHE gets big and programs are forced to swap to virtual memory. One solution is to Min FileCache=16384 MaxFileCache=16384 Do this only if you have more than 16MB of system RAM. You may want to play around with this setting a bit over time-but remember that any memory that VCACHE uses isn't available for your programs. On the other hand, if VCACHE is too small, you'll notice more disk activity every time you load your system. If you're curious, you can monitor your VCACHE behavior with a cool tool called VCMon, which you can download from www.sysinternals.com/vcmon.htm. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1999 "

"VOODO03 3000 AGP  REVIEW Voodoo 3: Fightin' the Good Fight HARDWARE A Bit Feature-Limited Maybe, But Slow It Ain't for UNREAL TOURNAMENT, and an extended demo version of DESCENT III. Finally, there's 3dfx Tools, which puts a lot of control into the hands of users (and has a slick user interface). But there are limitations. There's no option for 32-bit rendering and there's no memory configuration larger than 16MB. In addition, Voodoo can't do AGP texturing. This was apparent in the 3D WinBench 99 test, in which Voodoo couldn't run at a resolution of 1600x1200x16. The Hercules Dynamite TNT, also with 16MB of RAM, could run at that resolution-albeit slowly. It's possible that the 3000 could have run 3D WinBench at 1600x1200 if it had 32MB of RAM, but it doesn't. So Voodoo 3 is fast, but the competition, in the form of nVidia's TNT2 and Matrox's G400 Max, among others, will give Voodoo a run for its money. 3dfx has no real alternative to the feature sets of its competitors; all it currently has is Voodoo 3-its version of a stripped-down Dodge Charger with a 440cubic-inch engine. Still, the technology. though older than the competition, gives up nothing in raw performance. Thirty-two-bit rendering won't start to become a big deal until QUAKE 3: ARENA ships later this year, and that game will likely be followed by other titles that need 32-bit rendering capability. But 16-bit output still looks good in current games, and for these games Voodoo definitely delivers. CGW by Loyd Case here's something to be said for mature technology, and 3dfx is say. ing it loud and clear. The company's $20 million ad campaign, which touts its new Voodoo chipset (and targets general consumers rather than game geeks), is getting a lot of attention. All the noise does distract a little from the realization that Voodoo is probably the final chapter in the book that was Voodoo graphics. 3dfx's next architecture will entail a pretty serious redesign. Voodoo is, in essence, a Voodoo Banshee board with two rendering pipelines running at 143MHz or better. We looked at the 3000 model, which clocks in at 166MHz. (We'll take a look at the Voodoo 3500, which runs at 183MHz, in next month's roundup.) All Voodoo 3 boardsâmodels 2000, 3000, and 3500ship with 16MB of RAM. Model 2000 lacks TV out. The dual rendering pipelines behave the same way as a pair of Voodoo boards in SLI mode. In addition, the high clock speed makes for some serious 3D performanceas 3D GameGauge numbers show, Voodoo is no slouch in this department. So in a single AGP slot, you have VoodooSLI performance, pretty decent standard 2D (Windows) performance, and the ability to run Glide games very, very fast.

One advantage AMD's K6-2 has AMD have in the form of SSE and 3DNow, held is that it's been a solid performer that respectively. SIMD floating-point allows the could be had inexpensively, and it's delivered CPU to handle more data per CPU cycle, good, though not market-leading, performance thereby speeding up 3D performance.

But given that K6-Ill doesn't clearly outperform Pentium III, and that there's Performance Benchmarks no longer a price advantage, it seems WinBench 99 CPUMark99 AMD doesn't have a very compelling AMD K6-III 450 47.6 case to make with gamers. So what's new in the K6-III? Pentium III 450 34.4 Basically, this part has its Level 2 (L2) cache integrated into the chip core, WinBench 99 FPUMark which allows the cache to run at full AMD K6-III 450 1520 processor clock speed. Perhaps more Pentium II 450 2280 importantly, the L2 cache now runs on a backside bus, so it no longer has to 3DWB99 Transform share bandwidth with system memory AMD K6-11 450 86 as in previous AMD parts. However, despite this improvement, K6-III's floatPentium III 450 72.9 ing-point unit remains unchanged from K6-2, and so AMD is still dogged by a 3DWB99 Transform and Lighting traditional weakness in relation to AMD K6-111 450 49.9 Intel: floating-point performance, which Pentium Ill 450 51.9 is key to making 3D games purr. 3D Game Gauge @ 640x480 Number Crunch When looking at CPU performance, AMD K6-III 450 508.8 there are three areas to examine. Pentium III 450 462.2 and when many games begin taking advantage of it, which may happen later this year. In our testing, AMD outscores Intel on integer performance, probably due to K6-III's onboard L2 cache. But on traditional floatingpoint performance, Intel still clearly outpaces AMD, which means on games with ever-growing triangle counts that don't use SSE or 3DNow, Pentium III will get you more frames per second. Lastly, on SIMD floating-point performance, the results tend to favor AMD, whose score on 3D WinBench 99's Transform test was well ahead of Pentium III's. This test measures how fast triangles get transformed (moved from frame to frame of animation) in Direct3D's Transform and Lighting (T/L) engine. Next, the T/L test measures how fast triangles can be transformed and lit using D3D's T/L engine. Here the result was too close to call. This is where things got a little weird. Given Intel's faster floating-point performance, we expected Intel to outperform AMD in game tests, and yet K6-III outpaced Pentium III running 3D GameGauge 1.0, which left us scratching our heads. But then we noticed that on QUAKE II (which has the highest triangle count) Intel bested AMD. So we fired up several newer test games with higher triangle counts, and here AMD's floating point unit ran out of gas versus Intel. So while K6-III can hold its own on older games, Intel still wins running newer games with higher triangle counts.

AMD's upcoming K7 will have a re-architected floating-point unit that could well put AMD over the top.

"COMPUTER HARDWARE REVIEW INTERACT'S SV-281 FORCE FEEDBACK FX RACING WHEEL Drives Me Crazy GAMING **** DEVE Which The Force Feedback FX Racing Wheel is a \"wheel\" only in the loosest sense. Rather than employing the typical wheel-with-pedals arrangement, the Force FX is actually a hand-held device modeled after remote controls used for miniature race cars. Installation was easy using the supplied driver CD, but one major downer is that the FX needs a pair of AA batteries for its force-feedback effects. When playing NEED FOR SPEED III (NFS3) with the FX, I found that the knob's short throw and high resistance to movement left me facing the sides of the track more often than not. The device worked much better with MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS 2. One good aspect of the FX is the force feedback, which was decently rendered in NFS3. The packaging boasts that the FX is \"perfect for those long, grueling days of racing,\" but reality tells a different tale. My left hand became seriously fatigued after just four laps in NFS3. And given that I'm PROS: Great idea, decent controller good feedback effects for its size; easy installation CONS: Somewhat steep learning curve due to design; fatiguing to use; poor documentation; no power supply included, so it needs two AA batteries, REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 75MHz or higher, Windows 95 or better, 16MB RAM, 35MB hard drive space, 2x CDROM, DirectX-compatible video card, DirectX 5.0-compatible sound card/game port, 2 AA batteries.

And with gobs of new USB gamepads on the market these days, it's pretty much all I'm using. ThrustMaster's new Fusion Digital, an updated version of their Rage3D gamepad, proved to be a solid USB performer, though it wasn't flawless. Installation is pretty straightforward, although you still have to connect the controller midway through the installation process. After connecting the Fusion to the joystick port of a Turtle Beach Montego II (Vortex2-based) PCI sound card, it showed up as \"Not Connected.\" I took the Fusion for a spin through HIGH HEAT 2000, and it performed like a champ. Its \"lizard-eye\" D-pad design is still one of the most comfortable I've ever used, and it helps to reduce the \"game-claw\" feeling you get in your left hand after a PROS: Solid USB gamepad, comfortable to use; painless USB installation; inexlong session. pensive.

GAMING WORLD **** peech recognition for games isn't new, but the Game Commander software package seems to really work. It's a relatively simple system with a fairly clean user interface. You use the included microphone headset to give verbal commands, which are either preset for a handful of \"built-in\" games or added by you for other games. Unlike more complex packages, like IBM's ViaVoice, Game Commander requires no training for built-in game commands and minimal training for games you add. The current version 1.0 doesn't support multiple-keystroke commands, but there's a beta up on www.gamecmdr.com that adds this important capability-with a few bugs, however. Still, Game Commander is amazing to use. I checked out the built-in presets for the games BATTLEZONE and MECHWARRIOR: MERCENARIES. These worked well, so I created a template for EUROPEAN AIR WAR. Within about a half hour, I was up and flying, telling the computer, \"Check six\" and \"Wing-engage bandits.\" After the battle I could say \"Vector home\" and get the heading for home base. It was a real eye-opener. PROS: Simple speech recognition, minimal training, easy setup. CONS: Multiple keystroke version still in beta stage. REQUIREMENTS: Pentium 200MMX or better. Price: $44.95 Manufacturer: Mindmaker Software www.gamecmdr.com This is probably not a package for first-person shooters, though. There is a momentary delay while the command is executed, and in multiplayer games, a split-second could mean instant death. But sim jockeys may have finally found something better than keyboard templates and even more complex HOTAS controllers. Check it out. Loyd Case 116 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Gangs roam the cities and highways in lethally armed cars, killing and sometimes eating their foes. Unleaded gas is up to $12.75 a gallon-don't even ask about nitro. Fortunately, you're not out to save the worldâit's far too late for that. You just want to save your ass. pretty solid, particularly in the case of the gruff but lovable commander, Liddy, who guides you through the missions. Interstitial movie segments and briefings are rendered directly in the game engine; unfortunately, this forced me to restart once when a guy got stuck behind a parked car and couldn't continue the canned sequence. Blood on the Highway Set in a grim future of warring gangs and greedy companies, REDLINE is particularly bloody, even for a first-person shooter. Characters don't just die; they explode like an M-80 going off in a baggie full of liver, leaving headless bodies and severed legs stumbling and dancing around. You deal death roughly half of the time on foot and the other half in various vehicles, from motorcycles and dune buggies to tanks and turrets. The eye candy includes the de rigueur particle and lighting effects, wall damage, and huge explosions. Cars blow up with a ferocious bang that throws big chunks of scrap metal into the air, where they explode again. Mixed Bag o' Carnage REDLINE has 12 single-player missions, ranging from car-versuscar battles and stalking aliens on PEEKABOO 2100 The weapons aren't all that original, but the best foot in a crashed spaceship to of them, like this sniper scope/rifle, can deal plenty of carnage. racing full-out across the blasted wasteland in an attempt to reach And when something really big Vehicles also come equipped a garage with the \"jaws of life\" lets go, the ground shakes and with an assortment of guns, can before the bomb that's wired rolls, the screen flashes white, nons, mines, and rockets (both under your car goes off. and shock waves race outward. guided and unguided).

"REVIEW  EVERQUEST Online Bashfest ADVENTURE RPG Despite Technical Problems and Simplistic Premise, EVERQUEST Is Actually Fun olgante Taeolin by Thierry Nguyen VERQUEST is the DIABLO of 1999. An odd comparison, you say? Well, here's how they're alike: They both offer a very simple premise (\"go forth and thwack many creatures to gain levels and loot\"), and despite this simple premise (or maybe because of it). they're both damn addictive and fun. While many details keep EVERQUEST from being perfect, it's ultimately a great way to eat up your time online. GO Vingroate drection Neting CIRCLE OF MAGIC The best way to play EVERQUEST is to find five other gamers, join up as a party, and bond together via magic Elven Rangers Away! For an online-only game, EVERQUEST is very much a traditional RPG. It begins, like most RPGs, with character generation. First, you need to choose a server (they are all located in southern California, so you just need to select one based on how many people are on it). Then you choose your race, class, face, and name, and distribute attribute points. Due to the time investment this game requires, and the reality of deadlines, I did most of my gaming with a traditional RPG class (Half-Elf Ranger), and dabbled with some other characters and COMPUTER A Hunting We Will Go... EVERQUEST is an extremely social game. Several aspects of its design are geared to support teamwork. For one thing, to ease concerns about rampant killing and looting, there is a playerversus-player (PVP) flag. NonPVP players cannot be harmed by PVP players, and can't be looted by them either, in life or in death. You have a choice of whether or not to be PVP. You can either activate PVP mode yourself or start on a server where everyone is PVP. After that, you'll realize that once you hit a certain level, it's usually pretty hard to take on monsters by yourself. It's then time to find some other players around your level (up to five others), and band together. That fearsome Orc legionnaire won't seem so bad once you have a Mage, Cleric, and fellow Warrior taking it on. However, if you are three or more levels apart from each other, the lower-level person won't get any XP. This is to deter newbies from tagging along with their buddies for free XP. Finally, there is a thriving player-driven economy. While people still buy from NPC shops, a lot of gamers develop their trade skills, and you're guaranteed to see someone auctioning off some odd item every couple of minutes. With NPCs charging outrageous servers to get a feel for the game. Leveling is like AD&D, in that it takes a long, long time to gain levels depending on what you do. Realistically, most people will only have time to develop two, maybe three characters at most. Character development in EVERQUEST is skills-based. Each character starts with a certain set of skills, and you improve these skills by using them. Your skills will cap out after a while, however, and you'll need to gain another level to develop them further. The way to increase levels is either through lots of combat or finishing quests for your guild or other NPCs. Finally, every time you gain a level, you get five \"practice points\" that you can use with your guild trainer to immediately increase a skill's level. This is useful for skills that take a while to rise, as you can give them a slight boost right on the spot. Combat is real-time, but it's not a frantic mouse-clicking festival. Each weapon has a specific speed, so clicking your mouse as fast as you can won't work-you have to wait for your weapon to be available again. Even easier, you can just target your foe and press A to initiate auto-combat; all you have to worry about is keeping the enemy in view.

"LANDS OF LORE II  REVIEW Strike Three LANDS OF LORE III Continues the Franchise's Steep Decline ADVENTURE/RPG by P. Stefan \"Desslock\" Janicki hen LANDS OF LORE: GUARDIANS OF DESTINY was released in 1997, many roleplaying game fans were disappointed that the belated sequel cast players in the role of a single, preset character and bore little resemblance to its predecessor, THRONE OF CHAOS. By minimizing RPG elements and crafting an adventure/RPG/action hybrid, developers at Westwood hoped the second LORE game would have broader appeal. With RPGs enjoying a renaissance, LANDS OF LORE III has been released with the enticing prospect of enhanced RPG elements. Unfortunately, simplistic gameplay, barren environments, and horrible character Al collectively make playing LANDS OF LORE Ill an unsatisfying gaming experience. the heads of your hapless, uncoordinated foes. Since opponents are rare, the environments themselves challenge you with jumping and \"thrilling\" box-stacking puzzles that are apt to cause more character deaths than the game's battles. It's hard to understand Copper's constant need to inhale food, or the gameplay benefit which that touch of \"realism\" provides, in a light-hearted game that features fireball-hurling chickens. I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS Gladstone falls to pieces as the dimensions cross into one another. Soul Purpose Players are given the guise of Copper LeGre, who, after witness. ing the dismemberment of his father and nasty stepbrothers courtesy of dimension-hopping hounds, realizes that he's both become the heir to the throne of Gladstone and lost his soul. COMPUTER Copper has to travel through portals to five strange \"worlds\" in order to conveniently both save the realm and recover his soul. Thanks to the court mystic, lacking a soul hampers Copper less than losing a wristwatch and bears no impact on gameplay whatsoever, other than giving you additional motivation in case \"saving the realm\" wasn't sufficient encouragement. Unfortunately, gameplay is substantially similar, and uniformly simplistic, in each dimension. The realms lack scope and, with the notable exception of the Fire World's dragon city, any sense of scale. There's only a handful of creatures in each realm and less than a dozen characters who have more than two lines of speech. Exploring a world largely consists of traveling down barren, linear, claustrophobia-inducing paths. A capable 3D card will produce some nifty, if overused, colored lighting effects and impressive backgrounds, but the quality of the graphics varies greatly, as the voxels and sprites used to depict characters and items devolve into pixelated blobs up close. Certain areas (Underworld, Shattered Desert) overcome the limits of the game's engine, producing a few memorable moments. Others, such as the forest, with its canopied roof, pixelated bushes, and solid walls of textured trees, look completely artificial. GAMING ** Concluding LORE The game isn't all bad. Music and sound effects are varied and appropriately reflect Copper's immediate surroundings. Some elements from past games make welcome reappearances. The interface provides convenient access to available items, spells, and weapons and the comprehensive journal automaps your travels and records NPC conversations and other useful information. But the few noteworthy features are overwhelmed by the game's flaws. The initial release is unstable, frequently crashing on startup with some video cards, and it's intolerant of certain virtual memory cache settings and 3D sound cards. Clipping errors and missing textures are frequent enough that I suspected pits of being graphical errors. Ultimately, however, it's the simplistic and repetitive gameplay that makes LANDS OF LORE III more of a chore than a pleasure to play. CGW Familiar Play You can customize your character by joining one or more guilds and by selecting a familiar (a guide). There are four guilds (fighter, mage, cleric, and thief). but there's little incentive not to enroll in all of them. Copper gains levels faster with fewer memberships, but levels are relatively unimportant, since there's readily available equipment that'll enable neophyte characters to dish out formidable damage. Gaining levels is ludicrously easy in any event, as you can rack up experience stomping pitiful training opponents. Each guild offers only a couple of quests once you've completed its initiation, and later quests primarily require a tedious return trip to an explored world to grab a previously inaccessible item. Voice acting is generally painful and often occurs at inappropriate times. During frantic moments, your familiar will invariably announce an intention to look for trinkets while Copper retorts that he's \"hungry enough to eat a horse.\" Huh? Get in the game, Copper. Play to win. Al is atrocious, as the mute lower-Gladstone citizens smash against walls and the pathfinding of the three dozen enemy types makes combat almost always a joke, winnable by strafing left and right and bouncing arrow after arrow off WORLD Editor's Note: A longer version of Desslock's review can be found at www.gamespot.com.

"REVIEW  X-WING ALLIANCE Death Star Duel SIMULATION/SPACE Numerous Glitches Weaken Lucasarts' Epic New Star Wars Sim by Thierry Nguyen shady figure plays with a deactivated lightsaber. \"I understand. You found paradise in the Empire, had a good trade, made a good living. The storm troopers protected you, and there were courts of law. And you didn't need friendship from me. But now you come to me and you say, 'Don Azzameen, give me justice.' But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Jedi Master. Instead, you come into my house on the day the new Death Star goes online, and you ask me to do murder, for money. Okay, perhaps X-WING ALLIANCE isn't quite that close to The Godfather. But there are definite similarities.

It looks great and ends with a bang, but has several flaws that keep it from being the best of the three. (At least there aren't Ewoks everywhere.) COMPUTER plaints about the lack of singleplayer in X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER, developer Totally Games went back to its traditional formula of a scripted single-player campaign. While previous games had you playing a nondescript pilot for either the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire, this installment has a more personal feel to it. You take the role of Ace Azzameen, the youngest son in the Azzameen family. At first, you're just hauling containers for your father's trading business, but soon enough, the Rebel Alliance recruits you. During the 53-mission Rebel campaign, you'll be flying normal military missions, mixed in with the occasional family business-themed mission. Ace's story is told through a series of emails, mission briefings, and a large amount of plot-related radio chatter during missions. Because the campaign is linear, with pre-scripted missions, you'll have to replay failed missions until you succeed. You can \"sit out\" up to three of the Rebel campaign missions, but you'll have to fly all the family business missions to success.

Cockpits have seen a big improvement. The 2D bit-mapped cockpit imagery is gone, replaced by a full 3D cockpit with a HUD overlay. In addition, the developers brought over the concept of a padlock view, which tracks your targeted enemy, from flight sims. This can make a huge difference in combat, discouraging \"sit and spin\" tactics. When flying transport ships, you can hop into a turret to defend your ship. There are automated features to improve your gunnery. You can either set the turret to auto-fire on your current target or man the turret and have your droid copilot fly to keep the target in your firing arc. This is the first Star Wars sim designed from the ground up for 3D cards, and the Direct 3D support is much better than that retrofitted to XWING VS. TIE FIGHTER. This doesn't quite have the all-out 3D beauty of, say, WING COMMANDER: such revelations occurred, alerting me to plot twists before they happened. Also, if I didn't follow the script exactly, I was rewarded with a host of weird errors, such as critical ships exploding for no apparent reason, critical ships dumbly flying into enemy opposition and hence getting shredded, and ships sitting there doing nothing, leaving me twiddling my thumbs in the cockpit.

"FIGHTER SQUADRON: THE SCREAMIN' DEMONS OVER EUROPE  REVIEW Boom and Zoom In FIGHTER SQUADRON, It's All About the Dogfight STIMULATION SPACE by Robin G. Kim IGHTER SQUADRON: THE SCREAMIN' DEMONS OVER EUROPE (SDOE) doesn't just stand out for having the longest name. Where its competitors concentrate on broad historical campaigns, SDOE has a smaller scope, carving out a niche for itself with quick-to-fly sorties and good dogfighting action. SDOE lacks any sort of campaign mode, limiting gameplay options to instant action, multiplayer dogfights, and a mix of canned missions playable in any order. The sim provides 30 missions, but because each can be flown from several viewpoints, the number of scenario combinations runs into the hundreds. For example, a mission pitting a flight of B-17s with P-51 and Spitfire escorts against two groups of German interceptors can be played from five different perspectives. You can even switch between aircraft in-flight. And you can create additional missions to play or share with friends using the sim's mission editor. To maintain continuity between missions, the sim keeps pilot records that track cumulative scores, kills, and decorations. realism obviously suffers here, impatient players will appreciate the shorter flight times. Cursory mission briefings and nonexistent mission planning also help speed you into the action. Unfortunately, lengthy loading times when you switch theatres can cause delays if the game isn't allocated 160MB (beyond the minimum install) for terrain caching. Or worse, you may be totally roadblocked by a copy protection bug (already fixed in a patch) that ON A WING AND A HALF Damage effects feed into the flight model, prevents some PCs from even but the results are rather forgiving.

"FIGHTER SQUADRON: THE SCREAMIN' DEMONS OVER EUROPE  REVIEW SIMULATIONTISPACE HEADS UP FIGHTER SQUADRON: SDOE provides several mechanisms for artificially boosting your situational awareness, including an overlay map, a heads-up display, and plane icons. PAINFUL PHYSICS The bent-back propellor blades and collapsed landing gear of this P-51 Mustang testify to the sim's top-notch physics modeling. dogfights. This holds true for Internet play as well, which is exceptionally smooth and stable. Regrettably, oversimplified bombsights and an intractable autopilot make flying the bombers virtually pointless. The combat engagements are typically small. with fewer than a dozen planes and a few ground units present in an entire theatre, but the sim's outstanding Al, flexible view systems, and detailed damage modeling make for some great much from the fun, but why mix them with advanced features like torque effects and snap rolls? The skimpy game manual is of little help in learning such characteristics-or even some of the basic game functions. The 3D-accelerated graphics give good framerates at high resolutions even with the stunning cloud effects enabled.

Last year's crop of underachievers left baseball aficionados sorely wanting for something better. HIGH HEAT 99 was probably the best entry in the otherwise unremarkable class of '99. Well, it seems the second time's the charm for Team .366. In HIGH HEAT 2000 (HH2K). they've come up with a sharplooking 3D engine, a plenty-deep statistics model, and great gameplay, all of which combine to knock one out of the park. Even the die-hard EARL-heads here at CGW are ready to admit that HH2K is a real winner. COM DEMPN Variety Is the Spice... One of the most challenging parts of building a good baseball game is appealing to the arcade guys, keeping the stat-fanatics happy, and still making the whole thing fun.

"TRIPLE PLAY 2000. REVIEW Blammo-Ball If Baseball Were a Comic Book, This Is What It Would Look Like SPORTSYRACING by Dave Salvator ibling rivalry is a bitch. When you come from the same house that has given us FIFA, NBA LIVE, MADDEN, and NHL, people tend to expect great things. And why shouldn't they? With this august stable of titles, EA Sports reigns supreme for PC sports gaming. But then there's TRIPLE PLAY. Last year's version was much anticipated, mainly because it was being ported onto a full 3D engine. But the game disappointed, with a lackluster look as well as underwhelming and clumsy gameplay. In TRIPLE PLAY 2000 (TP2000), EA finds some redemption, and has improved the franchise's stock. But still, TP2000 isn't a platformdefining title-the definitive sports game that others aspire to be-like its other EA brethren. Couple that with the arrival of 3DO's fantastic HIGH HEAT 2000 and TP2000's mediocrity becomes even more painfully apparent. TP2000's shortcoming are numerous, ranging from boneheaded base-running Al, to ridicuCOMPUTER out at home.

"CIVILIZATION: CALL TO POWER  REVIEW Zero-Sum Game CIVILIZATION Shoots for the Stars, Ends Up on the Moon STRATEGYZWAR Moche DIPLOMAC by George Jones when I was young, my parents took me to what was advertised as \"the scariest, deadliest haunted house in Los Angeles. My brother and I walked in nervously excited, half expecting not to make it out. We walked out disillusioned and disappointed beyond belief. What had gone wrong? First off, the haunted house just wasn't great. Secondly, my expectations were unrealistically high. (I would not recommend this sort of self-analysis without the aid of a licensed psychotherapist.) Two years and countless hours of therapy later, I find myself wondering if the cold, occasionally angry reaction CIVILIZATION: CALL TO POWER has received from gamers isn't for similar reasons. First, we all had super-high expectations for it. Second, the gameplay, to be perfectly blunt, just doesn't have it. All the cool new features are outweighed by play-balancing issues, gameplay frustrations, and the fact that this version of CIV just doesn't hang together as well as it could.

The most immediate and prominent differences are the presence of many new units, a new win-game scenario, the ability to play in space, and an evolved interface. Unfortunately, many of these new additions aren't as helpful to the game as they sound. Take, for example, the game's special stealth units: Clerics who can drain money from enemy cities, Lawyers who can bring city production to a standstill, and so on. Conceptually these units sound great, but they fail to make the game better. The Slaver unit can be the most frustrating, particularly because he can cripple you badly at the beginning of a game. And when he attacks-by stealing your citizens and making them work for his civilizationhe can set you back big time by stunting the growth of your early WORLD Bangkok PROS: CIVIUZATION gameplay, improved graphics, great soundtrack.

"REVIEW CIVILIZATION: CALL TO POWER LEST IN PEA STRATEGYZWAR Looks Good, Tastes OK This seems to be the fate of CALL TO POWER: cool new ideas thwarted at every turn. Even the coolness factor of the game's new futuristic military units like the War Walker are negated by super-high production costs and the fact that you don't have to use super-powerful units to win. In one game at the Emperor Level, I was dropping way behind on the technological front. With the all-powerful Incans declaring war on me and eating away at my frontier cities, I decided to make a run at conquering the whole map by creating a massive army full of Musketeers and Cannons.

CHOICE about it every second that I'm away from my computer. For those of you unfamiliar with the series, HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC III (HOMMIII) puts you in the position of commanding armies of dragons, vampires, knights, and the like in a traditional fantasy setting. The turnbased gameplay is divided in thirds: An expansive adventure map, where your heroes traverse the terrain in search of resources GATE-CRASHERS More units and combat maps twice as large as in the previous game turn castle sieges into epic struggles. mula that has made the HEROES games a truly stellar series.

This is first apparent in the size of all the maps. The adventure maps are frequently enormous, and several of them feature a new subterranean level that effectively doubles their size. Town maps have ballooned to hold a host of new buildings, and combat maps are about twice the size of their counterparts in the previous game-all the better to accommodate the new armies that can now hold up to seven different unit types. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are now eight different types of towns, each generating a unique set of creatures requiring a specific combat strategy: The devastating hand-tohand attacks of castle units demand a head-on assault, while the ranged attacks of units from tower towns benefit from a more defensive posture. Every monster in the game has an upgrade available, whereas HEROES II allowed only some of its units to Alexandreco HUMBLE BEGINNINGS Numerous upgrades and building options in HOMMIII give gamers a multitude of choices to make as they develop their towns from simple hamlets, like the one on the left, to sprawling cities, like the one on the right. 148 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Most units have special attacks/attributes that impact combat strategy. For example, incredibly powerful archangels can resurrect fallen comrades, while undead ghost dragons can age opponents, thus halving their hit points. Every unit is now rendered in 3D, with a more realistic look than the cartoonish units of the previous game. Finally, a slew of new heroes and artifacts throws more strategic factors into the mix. Every hero has an innate special ability such as being able to gain a bonus when commanding certain troops-and there are lots of new abilities to acquire as well. One new ability. tactics, lets heroes move their forces within a limited range immediately prior to a battleit's great for offense-minded heroes, letting them move ranged units into prime positions while cutting down the distance melee units have to travel. All this makes for a game that is mind-boggling in its depth, and the designers deserve praise for adding so much while managing to dodge the paralyzing feature bloat that could have easily sunk the title. Unfortunately, they also deserve a slap on the wrist for a tutorial that requires players to either print out a huge manual or constantly toggle between the game and a separate text file. campaigns with a few branches, the campaign is broken up into six minicampaigns of three to four scenarios apiece. While this lets the game tell a more interesting story, fans of the series will probably miss the either/or branches of HEROES II that rewarded them for taking on more challenging scenarios. The campaign mode's greatest drawback is that gamers can't load individual scenarios from any completed minicampaign-you have to save each scenario at its start to replay it. While the campaign game is loaded with more than 20 great, challenging scenarios featuring a variety of goals-including wiping out enemies, seizing specific towns, escort missions, and moreâthey're unevenly paced, with one cruelly hard mission finishing up the relatively easy second campaign (see sidebar for tips on beating this scenario) before lapsing into easy mode for the next campaign. Fortunately, the game ships with an enormous number of mostly customizable single scenarios, giving the game remarkable replaya. bility, while the map editor that's included ensures that tons of user-created maps will be available online. HOMMIII has improved its multiplayer play, allowing for timed turns and letting strategists scan the map and their towns during an opponent's turn; while you can't issue orders during your enemy's turn, at least it's better than just staring at your monitor. A problem with DirectPlay makes Internet HOMMIII a sluggish experience, but that should be corrected in an upcoming patch. Ultimately, the rewards of HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC III far outweigh its few drawbacks. Hopefully most of those shortcomings will be patched, but even as it stands now HOMMIII is a game that strategy fans should absolutely be playing. CGW To protect your more valuable units, let Iyour weakest creatures attack tough enemies first so they absorb the counterstrike. The Al almost always focuses its attack on the largest group of units, so build up hordes of cheap cannon-fodder units to occupy enemies while your stronger armies pound on them. For inferno heroes, bait enemies with imps so that magogs can hurl fireballs without damaging more expensive units. Build marketplaces early. Almost every map is scarce in some resource (generally gold), so you'll need to convert resources early and often. Just because you start a scenario with two towns doesn't mean you need two heroes. Instead, use one town as your central production point while building up only the income-generating aspects of the second town. With one well-equipped hero you'll be able to win crucial early battles for resources that will eventually make additional heroes affordable and effective. Use your units' special abilities. For exam ple, since cavaliers and champions get 5 percent extra damage for every hex traveled, they should always charge before an attack, even if it means just circling an enemy that's already next to them. w TO OUR READERS This review was intended to appear last month, but our printer erroneously omitted the first page.

"REVIEW  JANE'S FLEET COMMAND Ship Shape STRATEGY AWAR. A Strategy Game for Real-Time Strategy Fans and Naval Warfare Experts Alike by Jeff Lackey LEET COMMAND is a naval warfare game that should appeal to gamers whose primary understanding of carriers and cruisers comes from CNN. However, FLEET COMMAND also has enough substance to bring some serious wargame fans into the real-time strategy fold. This \"HARPOON LITE\" game's point-and-click interface, 3D views, and fastpaced campaign missions are clearly targeted at gamers who want to jump in and play without memorizing pages of complex commands, but there's enough substance here to intrigue the grognard. SOME DAYS YOU GET THE BEAR A Russian bomber bites the dust. Anchors Away FLEET COMMAND's user interface is simple, but extremely functional. The lower third of the screen is divided into three windows: a big-picture overview, a 3D view of the action, and a panel of information on the selected unit. The top two-thirds of the screen is a tactical topdown map. The 3D window and the large tactical map can be swapped out to provide a larger COMPUTER view of the action, while another key press will bring up a fullscreen 3D view Your role, appropriately enough, is that of overall fleet commander. You command forces by clicking on them in the topdown tactical map and giving them orders, such as identify contact, engage, patrol, transit, and rescue. Everything can be accomplished via mouse clicks and popup menus: Click to choose a unit, click to select an action, click to choose a location or target. As one might expect from a Jane's product, a wide assortment of ships, subs, and planes are at the player's disposal: everything from transports to carriers, from fighters to bombers, representing the navies of 16 nations. The world's oceans are your battlefield, with accurate ocean maps provided for the entire globe. The game sports a good variety of interesting single missions, with a diverse range of platforms, force sizes, and objectives demonstrating the ver. satility of the game system. Also included is a story-driven campaign. The campaign is one area that may receive mixed reviews from both hard-core naval gamers and more casual players. First, it's composed of only four missionsâmissions that might more accurately be called scenarios. Each mission is composed of multiple tasks, many of which are revealed only upon completion of earlier objectives. It could easily take hours to successfully complete each mission (and success in a mission is required to GAMING progress in the campaign). More importantly, there's significant variability when you start a campaign mission, with the enemy's make-up and location changing with each replay. However, the pace of the campaign missions will be a little hectic for players who cut their teeth on serious naval simulations. In what may appeal to casual gamers (who would be bored with simulated hours of searching for the enemy), the campaign missions typically start with a hail of enemy missiles in the air. You must rapidly click on your ships and the incoming missiles in an attempt to shoot them down before they sink your forces. At the same time, you'll need to quickly launch your own missiles, launch and direct aircraft, send out anti-submarine warfare (ASW) forces, launch strikes against surface sites, and much more. If you survive the initial onslaughts, the action will slow down long enough for you to catch your breath. Later mis. sion taskings involve more thoughtful objectives such as finding and eliminating lurking submarines.

"REVIEW WARZONE 2100, BATTLEGROUND: CHICKAMAUGA Apocalypse and Civil War STRATEGYIWAR Two New Wargames Deliver Very Different Jolts of Excitement There are times, however, when the Al shows some vulnerability. Occasionally, tanks get sidetracked from reaching the battlefront. Attack formations also seem a problem; they really could have used a combat formation script similar to MYTH. Mastering the interface is no easy task, with so many mini-menus to navigate and a bazillion designs to utilize. The game gets increasingly convoluted over time, and the timed scenarios sometimes become more of a nemesis than your enemies. The game's 3D graphics are a refreshing change from the standard 2D real-time strategy game format. However, the various camera angles and panning and zooming features sometimes impede the process of navigating the map. All in all, WARZONE 2100 offers a unique mixture of building and combat. If you're a technical maven who enjoys customizing your forces, then this game is the one you've been waiting for. -Raphael Liberatore Warzone 2100 Price: $44.99 Publisher: Eidos Interactive www.eidosinteractive.com ptly blending research, design, and unit customization with strateagy and combat WARZONE 2100 tries hard to compete with STARCRAFT and TOTAL ANNIHILATION, but its back-story is the same old postapocalyptic hoopla. Commanding a small force known simply as the Project, you venture from your underground labyrinth in search of artifacts (technologies) in a world shattered by nuclear fallout. Once a base of operations is created, you build and manage power plants, factories, and research facilities in order to supply, design, and upgrade your forces while searching for more artifacts. Long-term playability is assured through more than 400 technologies and 2,000 unit variations. Designing and building the perfect combat force is vital to surviving the deadly onslaughts of the evil Nexus, Collective, and New Paradigm regimes. WARZONE 2100 takes place on three giant maps: Alpha (desert wastelands), Beta (demolished city), and Gamma (mountains). Each campaign map is carefully Battleground: Chickamauga espite its age, the finest Civil War series ever isn't ready for euthanasia, thank you. BATTLEGROUND: CHICKAMAUGA takes you west of the Alleghenies, where, instead of the hint of Victorian romance we always associate with Robert E. Lee, we are treated to the bareknuckled, savage affairs of Generals Grant, Rosecrans, and Bragg. In addition to the heroics of Longstreet and Thomas at Chickamauga, we also get the Union's hard-fought victory at Murfreesboro, and a \"what-if\" battle that assumes Bragg failed to guess Rosecrans' movements between Murfreesboro and Chickamauga. The basic Battleground system portraying these conflicts hasn't changed drastically. The 32-bit graphics now stylistically resemble those of TalonSoft's WEST FRONT more than Charlie Kibler's earlier hand-painted Battleground maps. You may now deploy skirmishers, and there are a few common-sense changes to morale, fatigue, and defense. The simulated situations vary in appeal: Though Murfreesboro isn't the most exciting battle, Chickamauga is particularly well balanced for multiplay. The new touches are evolutionary, but this game system manages well enough without a lot of innovation. If you're into the American Civil War, you'll enjoy it. For others, you should be warned that there's probably more scholarship than excite ment to be found here; this package isn't up to the level of say, BATTLEGROUND: SHILOH. -Jim Cobb CGW divided into several scenarios that focus on base defense, assault, or recon missions. Each mission extends the campaign map. revealing more areas to conquer and explore. At times, the combat scenarios are repetitive, but there is a definite feeling of progression throughout the game. The Al, for the most part, is solid. Tanks attack the enemy. and trucks repair damaged structures without requiring your constant micromanagement. Unit pathfinding improves as technologies improve. WARZONE 2100 also includes a multitasking feature in which multiple commands can be assigned to units or factories, making management easier; for example, you can dispatch a repair truck to a particular spot use that same truck to build an oil derrick, then repair a structure somewhere else on the map. Structures and units carry over from one scenario to the next, gaining combat ratings that range from rookie, green, veteran, and professional all the way to hero. The higher the rating, the more proficiently units move, work, and fight. Price: $49.95 Publisher: TalonSoftTake 2 www.talonsoft.com 162 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. JULY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"MACHINES, SMOLENSK TO MOSCOW  REVIEW Robots'n' Russkies Some Games Take the Fog-of-War Too Seriously STRATEGYIAWAR The first-person view is the most disappointing. You can jump into the cockpit of any mobile unit and control its directional movement, turret movement, and weapon fire. Sounds great, but once you go to this shooter POV you lose the satellite map, making it impossible to maintain any type of strategic control. Nor can you control multiple units any. more, making your attack a solo performance. Buried in all this mess are a couple of gems, though. There are real micro-terrain features: small hills, shallow depressions, ravines, trees, and other obstructions that offer localized cover from enemy fire and provide an opportunity to nullify longer-range weapons and let you \"funnel\" the enemy into your kill sacks. This genre combination still holds great promise, but you're better off looking for satisfaction in another title.-Lance A. Larka Machines * * * * German victories of the summer of 1941 and instead portrays the Soviets' stiffening before Moscow, thus examining how the Wehrmacht was worn down, slowed, and stopped during the infamous Russian winter. An enlightened port of boardgame to computer, STM has the look and feel of SPI and Avalon Hill divisional-level games, but without the tedious paperwork for command control, morale, and supply. This convenience mostly makes up for the somewhat tricky interface and simplistic graphics. The game's nine scenarios cover the period from October to December of 1941, with some fighting in 1942. The gameplay is so straightforward that any board wargame aficionado will be right at home. Optional rules add spice with fog-of-war and advanced combat postures, there's also a scenario editor. The Al is reasonably tough, and STM works very well for email play against another human general. STM provides a solid, wellresearched, and pretty enjoyable game with a lot of replay value. Even so, the DOS clunkiness of its engine is starting to catch up to Schwerpunkt, which should consider a move to Windows 95/98. Otherwise, this little company risks being buried by the avalanche of scenarios found in high-test games like THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR. -Jim Cobb CGW * Smolensk to Moscow Publisher: Acclaim Entertainment Price: $44.99 www.acclaim.net 've come across some really ugly genre combinations in the past, but none that I wanted to see succeed as badly as this mixture of RTS and FPS. I can't count the number of times that I've cursed at my tanks in COMMAND AND CONQUER because they turned at the wrong time, and simultaneously thought, \"If only I could have been at the helm.\" Unfortunately, the integration of these very different gaming styles was done so poorly in MACHINES that I found myself wishing that they had stuck to one and done it right. The premise of the game is that humanity sent out robotic artificial intelligence seeding colonies in advance of the human \"generation\" ships that were following. The humans never arrived, and a bug in the Al code caused the original robot ships to make colonies of their own. When these empires of colonies bump into each other, the different Al's fight it out.

One of the most touted features has been the viewing interface, and this is where the game fails the most. None of the three settings-strategic view, ground view, and first-person view-really does the job well. The strategic view offers a rotating, over-the-shoulder perspective that is good for selecting multiple units. But the onscreen visibility range is severely limited. You can't pan the view up very far, which severely limits the type of movement that you can effectively order. To make things even worse, you can't really see the terrain's elevation changes. The ground view is probably the most useful of the three.

Computer opponents can be scaled from three levels of difficulty and can be mixed within one match-letting you play a match against two amateurs and one pro, for example. The dart throwing itself is most akin to a golf simulation. A transparent arm appears on screen; you aim with the mouse and then throw by thrusting the mouse forward. The speed of your mouse movement determines the velocity of the dart. It'll take a couple of games to get the feel down, but once you do, the play is natural and pretty dead-on. If this appeals to you, then ELITE DARTS is about as faithful and accurate a darts sim as you could ever hope for, minus the drunken morons walking in front of the board as you throw-the game's only serious omission. -Jeff Green Challenge Play Turn LDAU.

Face it: When you've got X, Z, Q, J, F, N, and D. you really don't have much choice but to chuck it all into the bag and redraw; not being able to do that is a serious drawback. On the plus side, EMAIL SCRABBLE is simple to install and quite easy to play, whether or not you're familiar with the board game. SCRABBLE clans are rapidly forming over in CGW's sales department, and even jaded editors have become hooked. Heck, some of us are even playing this game with our moms (but don't tell anybody). While it lacks some of the chrome (sexier graphics, more robust dictionary, and so forth) of the bigger-budget SCRABBLE of a year ago, EMAIL SCRABBLE is aggressively priced and quite addictive. This is one email application we really like. -Tom Price Email Battleship splashing sound. This game misses by a mile. Which is a shame. First let me say that I have no problem with the game of Battleship itself. I wasted many a prepubescent afternoon on the shag carpet yelling out \"You sank my battleship!\" at one cousin or another. The game is a good way to waste a half hour. Battleship by email, however, is a bad way to waste a few weeks. Worse, EMAIL BATTLESHIP can be a bit buggy. Unfortunately, 1 too often received \"application not found\" errors while trying to open the email attachment and was forced to detach the attachment and run the program in order to play my move. It's CGW policy to finish every game we review, but EMAIL BATTLESHIP is so mind-numbingly tedious that after two weeks and only one sunken ship, I decided to give up. There's not enough strategy or planning inherent to the game to keep it interesting or compelling over that period of time.-Tom Price CGW Publisher: Patch Products Price: $20.00 www.patchproducts.com elcome to CGWS Department of Crow Eating. Having taken an admittedly cheap shot at ELITE DARTS in my Greenspeak column last monthwithout ever having played the game-I felt it was my cosmic duty to take a higher road this month, be a professional, and actually play the game before reviewing it. And, yeah, for what it is, ELITE DARTS is actually really good. ELITE DARTS is a surprisingly feature-rich darts simulation made by people who take their darts seriously. It offers three classic games-Cricket, '01, and Baseball that you can play against up to three computer opponents or in multiplayer mode over a LAN or the Internet. ELITE DARTS smartly includes the games' most common rules variations, allowing you to customize play and scoring to the way you're used to playing in real life.

"STRATEGY  CHEATS  WALKTHROUGHS Civilization: Call to Power Excerpts From Brady Publishing's Civilization: Call to PowerâThe Official Strategy Guide hether you wish to conquer the world in the manner of Alexander the Great or just build a peaceful empire, it's inevitable that you are going to have to fight a war at some point during CIVILIZATION: CALL TO POWER-and not always at a time and place of your own choosing. Therefore, the first question by Terry Coleman you should ask and Johnny Wilson yourself is, \"What is my strategic goal in this particular game?\" The second question, which follows from this, is, \"Can I afford to undertake my chosen goal?\" What newcomers to CALL TO POWER often fail to ask is. \"Can I afford not to undertake my chosen goal?\" Worse, still, they have no goal at all. One thing we can assure you, however: If you simply go along, letting the game play you, instead of you playing the game, your civilization will be left in the dustbin of his. tory. Therefore, whenever you are faced with the possibility of military conflict, ask yourself: 1. Does the potential enemy pose an immediate threat to the wellbeing of my empire? 2. Will this fight start a long, protracted war? 3. Why am I going to war? 4. How much can I afford to lose? 5. Will this war help me win the game? At the risk of sounding cynical, we tend to go to war when it is most practical to do so. For the Alexander the Great-style player, this might be 90 percent of the time (yet you still don't want a war forced on you before you're ready). Even if you're a player whose style is better suited to economics and production, you'll eventually reach a point at which you're entangled in a \"World War\" that continues over a long number of turns. In either case, you are going to have to decide whether: (a) crippling your opponents is enough; (b) you should take an opponent entirely out of the game; or (c) you can derive a lasting advantage without expending as much effort. CONCERNING THE ART OF COMBAT Legion Versus Phalanx I hen you attempt to enter the space of an enemy W piece, combat occurs. Combat in open terrain is A Phalanx, with a defense strength fairly simple, because you can make a rough estimate of value of 2, defends in Plains (whether your chances in a given combat by comparing the attack or not the Plains space has a road, it's value (of the unit moving into the space) with the defense still considered open terrain). Assume value (of the unit already in the space). Combat percent that a Legion, with an assault strength ages are always figured from the attacker's point of view, value of 2, attacks the Phalanx. The as follows: odds are even, which you'd expect from Attacker value divided by (Attacker value + two units with the same value. But Defender value) = Chance of a Hit let's go through the process anyway: If the Attacker makes his Chance to Hit, he scores a single hit on the Defender, who loses one Hit Point. If the The Legion Attack is 2; the Phalanx Attacker misses his Chance to Hit, he loses a Hit Point. Defense is 2. This continues until either the Attacker or the Defender 2 [attack value) divided by (2 [attack has lost 10 Hit Points and is eliminated. value]+2 (defense value]) = Chance for the Attacking Legion to Hit the Defending Phalanx. UNIT COMBAT MODIFIERS 2 divided by (4) = 1/2, or a 50 percent Unit Condition Combat Effect Chance to Hit for the Legion against At War status Normal the Phalanx. On Alert -12 percent Standing Down -25 percent At this point, the computer program Fortified +50 percent would generate a random number from Unit has 2/3 of a movement 1 to 100, much like rolling a pair of 10point left -33 percent sided percentile dice. If the number in Unit has 1/3 of a movement this case came up as, say, 43, then the point left -67 percent Legion would have made its Hit Chance Veteran unit +50 percent and would inflict a hit on the Phalanx. If the random number was anything from 51 to 99, then the Legion would MULTIPLICITY OF WONDERS have failed its Hit Chance and would take a hit itself. The process repeats.

Basically, all units with a Ranged Attack (Archers, Musketeers, and so forth) are placed in the \"back row\" of each side, as long as they have normal land combat units (Marines, Phalanxes, and the like) in front of them, in the \"front row.\" 2.

"Heroes of Might & Magic II Build Strongholds, Augment Spells, and Rule Erathia in No Time GAMER'S EDGE ven given the excellence of the entire series, HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC III still stands out, with eight castle types to choose from, 16 different types of heroes to play, over 100 creatures to command, and a detailed magic system to master. In a game with so many options, it can't hurt to get a few pointers, especially if you're facing a bully like CGW Features Editor Denny Atkin, who is just begging to be beaten. With that in mind... by Elliott Chin THE ABCS OF COMBAT Need for Speed Nothing spells victory like initiative. If you can move first in battle, you can draw first blood and cast the first spells. Being first thus means having a great advantage. Try to ensure that you have at least one stack in your army that has speed 9 or higher. Also, make sure your ranged units are faster than the enemy's ranged units. If your ranged units aren't faster, then take the opportunity to cast Haste or Prayer on them to speed them up. It's important that you attack with your ranged troops before spells or faster ranged units cut down their numbers. A LS. Morale and Luck These two factors are very important to any tactical battle. Good morale allows your troops to attack again, while good luck means your unit deals double damage. Conversely, bad morale paralyzes your unit for that round. Never mix more than two types of creatures from a town, because that lowers morale. Try to get the Leadership skill for your heroes: It adds +1 to +3 to your units' morale. Still, keep in mind that morale can never go higher than +3. Similarly, you should try to acquire the aptly named Luck skill. Heroes Be mindful of the fact that heroes add their attack and defense to their attendant troops. Thus, although the goblin and the gremlin have very similar statistics, when matched against each other, the goblin will be twice as effective if it's commanded by a barbarian (+4 attack) and the gremlin is commanded by an alchemist (+0 attack). As in previous HEROES games, you want to create a killer superhero and have him initiate the majority of your offensive strikes. IT MIGHT BE MAGIC 31C in HEROES III falls under four elemental schools: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. Every hero's command of magic is dependent on whether he chooses to learn the Air, Earth, Fire, and Water skills. Each skill allows the hero to cast spells in that school at greater effectiveness. In addition, having the matching skill will make all spells in that school cheaper to cast. While you can still cast a spell even if you don't have the appropriate skill, it would behoove you to learn that skill as quickly as possible for both the increased effect and lowered cost. Here is a rundown of each school's pros and cons. Otherwise, you teleport to the nearest town without an occupying hero. The undead spells (Animate Dead, Death Ripple, Destroy Undead) all belong to the Earth school. Fire: Fire is heavy A This school has excellent movement spells for the adventure (strategic) map. Both Fly and Dimension Door are excellent for moving around the map, and the latter practically triples your move. If you master Air magic, you can cast Dimension Door four times a day. The Air school has two potent attack spells-Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning but few other direct-damage spells. The all-important Haste spell-a must-have for slow troops-is an Air spell. on offensive magic, with spells such as Fireball, Inferno, and Armageddon. However, this school has neither a spell quite as destructive as Implosion nor one so far-reaching as Chain Lightning. This school does have some interesting augmentation magic, such as Bloodlust (increases attack rating) and Frenzy (adds all defense points to your attack rating). However, Fire is probably the weakest of the game's schools. V Earth: This school has not only the effective Meteor Swarm spell but also the most powerful offensive spell in the game: Implosion. In addition, the very useful Town Portal spell belongs to this school. If you mas. ter Earth magic, you can specify the town to which you want to teleport. ater. The Water school has many powerful augmentation spells, including Bless (maximum damage). Mirth (increase morale). Teleport (move anywhere on the map), and Prayer (increase attack, defense, and speed). This school lacks effective attack magic, but is the best for enhancing your troops in battle. 170 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"CIVILIZATION: CALL TO POWER Continued from Page 169 BARBARIANS AT THE GATE GAMER'S_EDGE Darbarians are the embodiment of chaos theory Din CALL TO POWER. Here are a few ways to impose order on the madness: 1. You know those villages that you always sweat over entering, because you don't know whether they hold the promise of shiny new gold, a welcome technological advance, or the threat of a Barbarian horde? Wait to explore those close to your empire until you've built a city near them: A village within your city limits (the two-space radius) won't spawn a Barbarian. 2. A corollary to this is that the CALL TO POWER program doesn't like to give you the same village result within the same turn. So, consider exploring three to four outlying villages on the same turn. While you might get a Barbarian, you are almost certain to get a free advance. 3. Also, keep in mind that there's about a 50-50 chance that the free advance you discover will be the one you are already researching. So, you might take a chance and bump down your science output during this turn, until you see what gifts you get 4. If a Barbarian should capture one of your cities, consider building a trade route to it before you recapture the city. You'll make money in the short term, and it's a good step toward a monopoly in many cases. 5. If a Barbarian is making progress against another empire, send a Spy or Cyber Ninja to shadow the Barbarian. If the Barbarian gets lucky and captures an enemy city, you can Incite Revolution and grab the city without starting a war with the former owner of that city.

Most units with Ranged Attacks are much more effective in the second row than in the first. So, make sure that you have a balanced force, with plenty of front line troops to protect your Ranged Attack units. A good example of this would be to have only half as many Archers, for example, as you have Legions, Samurai, and/or Phalanxes combined in a particular force.  Normally, units controlled by a computer player are less likely to attack when they have less than a movement point remaining (if they have been moving down a road, for example). If you move to where your unit is at the far end of the computer unit's move. ment range (such as just alongside, but not on, a road) the computer's unit is likely to move next to you, but not attack you at unfavorable odds. This allows you to attack the defending computer unit on your next turn or to reinforce with other units if the odds are unfavorable for you.  Keep track of your opponent's aircraft: Some of them are almost certainly operating at the farthest range of which they are capable. In such a case, all you have to do is place a row of Air units between them and their refueling base. When the enemy Air units can't get home, they crash-quick, simple, and deadly. Remember, there are no aerial zones of control, so your aerial blockade must consist of a solid line of aircraft, with no holes. When executing this tactic, Terry especially likes using obsolete aircraft. CGW WOLFPACK ATTACK iven that Subs can be seen only by a handful of units (and Cities with Sonar Buoys), they can wreak havoc on your Aircraft Carriers and even your Battleships if left unchecked. The classic method is to seek them out with Destroyers and sink them with a combination of Destroyers and Aircraft. So, what do you do when you want your Subs to send your opponent's tonnage to the bottom of the ocean? During World War II, the Germans developed the tactic of sending large groups of Subs, called Wolfpacks, to overwhelm unsuspecting prey. It's a little more difficult to manage this in CALL TO POWER, but the idea is still valid. The best method we've found is to put together a Wolfpack of four or more Subs and hold them off a couple of spaces. Then, send out one or two other solo Subs to try to break through the \"picket line\" of Destroyers that's spread out, trying to protect the valuable Carriers and Battleships. If the solo Subs get through, fine-but chances are good that at least one of them will be detected. The computer is not terribly disciplined, and it will often break up its Destroyer picket line to converge on your Sub and kill it. This generally opens up a hole for you to plunge through with your Wolfpack and head straight for the juicier enemy targets. The complete CALL TO POWER guide has tips on how to conduct blitz attacks, set up mobile defenses, and carry out a Clerical or Televangelist agenda. It also dissects wonders, explains technology advances, and suggests the best times to switch governments. Besides, the guide confirms our suspicions that Terry and Johnny are secretly Ecoterrorists at heart. 178 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD JULY 1999 www.computergaming.com "

"STRATEGY/WAR GAMERS EDGE TIPS CHEAT CODES HINTS WALKTHROUGHS SIMULATIONS/SPACE X-Wing Alliance Railroad Tycoon II Here's a dirty tactic: Lay a circle of track that crosses a competitor's layout as much as possible, build a dummy station with a roundhouse and water towers, and then run a train with the maximum number of cars. Run two trains, if you like, in order to thoroughly clog the opposition's rail net. Keep in mind, especially on longer runs, that if your train's oil level is one notch above empty, the chance for a breakdown doubles. Never underestimate the economic power of renewable resources: A well-placed cluster of cattle yards will produce enormous quantities of milk and moolah.âSam Baker Type imacheater to activate cheat mode, then enter any of the following: Code ewoksrule masteryoda killmenow thetasteofvictory hypermeto## Effect invulnerable unlimited ammo lose the level win the level warp to different level, where ## is the number of the level Heroes of Might and Magic III ADVENTURE/RPG EverQuest In early-level play, never go into combat without first considering your opponent: Either select/Cons or right-click on the targeted enemy. Opponents that show up as blue are easy targets, but they still give you needed experience. Opponents with colors below blue on the scale, like black or green, aren't worth your time. While you can try your luck with yellow enemies, you should get another party member to help you. Finally, never fight an enemy that shows up as either white or red, unless you have an army with you-or you're feeling suicidal. --Thierry Nguyen During play press Tab and then enter any of the following: Code Effect nwcantioch.... ..all siege weapons nwcavertingoureyes................. all structures nwccastleanthrax.... ................maximum luck nwccoconuts.......................unlimited movement nwcgeneraldirection... .. .entire map is revealed nwcmuchrejoycing .................maximum morale nweshrubbery..................+100 all resources and +10,000 gold ACTION Army Men 2 West Front Enter message mode by pressing and then type lwhen all else fails...

In scenarios where you exit units off the map, you should resist the urge to slaughter the enemy and hold all victory hexes. Try grabbing one or two hexes close to the exit and letting the enemy batter himself against your rear guard while you hustle the bulk of your force off the battlefield. Empty trucks are fine candidates for cheap victory points, Air strikes generally don't come when you need them, and it's almost quaranteed that they won't hit the targets you specify. So, rather than whine about it, point the flyboys in the general direction of a target-rich environ ment and let them have some fun.

"A Brief History Of PC Gaming A Handy Clip-and-Save Guide, Compiled With Love omputer gaming has a long and storied history. Unfortunately, over the years, it has been obfuscated by a steady stream of misleading blather and erroneous hoo-hah. Of course, at times, it was the hoo-hah that was misleading and the blather that was erroneous, but we should not let such technicalities lead us astray. Once we're led astray, the way becomes unclear, and the threads of coherent arqument vanish before us, like the proverbial dust in the wind of which the rock band Kansas once spoke so eloquently. I'll start again. This month, as a public service, Greenspeak presents to you, free of charge, this exclusive Pocket History of Computer Gaming, which you may feel free to clip and save in your wallet, or staple to the back of your brother's head, for easy reference. Many sources contributed to this work, though! must single out one in particular, the revelatory Dutch pictorial How Yaks Mate. Though it did not contribute directly to this piece, it was my constant companion during these exhaustive weeks of research-especially page 37. Without further ado, or anything even slightly resembling ado, let us begin. under the mistaken impression that the war was \"turn-based.\" Bewildered Roman crowds promptly stone him to death. 1337 The Hundred Years' War begins, following an ugly deathmatch in which the King of England calls the King of France a \"camping wussy.\" 1455 First DAIKATANA levels completed, then scrapped, following invention of the printing press, which renders the game obsolete. 1483 Spanish Inquisition begins. WizardWorks' budget-priced HERETIC HUNTER tops the bestseller charts for the next 100 years. 1492 Columbus discovers America. In a nowfamous letter to the Queen of Spain he bitterly complains, \"I would have discovered it a lot sooner, Your Majesty, if it was n't for that freak. ing fog-of-war.\" 1684 Isaac Newton invents mouse look \"While my earlier success with this whole applefalling-on-myJEFF GREEN head gravity after an international gathering of scientists in Geneva is unable to explain the continued success of Billy Crystal. 1860 DAIKATANA team says a beta is \"imminent,\" but outbreak of Civil War puts the game \"on temporary hold.\" 1903 Wright Brothers fly first controlled airplane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The following day, posts begin appearing on the flight sim newsgroups ridiculing the plane's \"unrealistic flight model.\" 1920 First professional football league founded. Sierra, in a disastrous public relations move, prematurely releases first football game, neglecting to include stadiums, players, or a football. 1931 William Shatner born. Decline of Western civilization officially begins. 1956 Elvis Presley sweeps the world with his swiveling, gyrating hips. Young male scientists, suddenly feeling awkward and confused inside, step up their efforts to invent the personal computer. 1973 Embattled U.S. President Richard Nixon delivers famous \"I am not a crook\" speech. On the same day, DAIKATANA team assures public that the game is right on time, and should ship \"within the month.\" Our breasts will be huge in these games, and our butts, they will be fabulous. 70,000 B.C. First recorded incident of human violence. Og, a Neanderthal, bashes Ug, another Neanderthal, over the head with a large bone, in a heated dispute over a mud puddle. A committee is formed, the Group of Outraged Neanderthals (GOON), who immediately blame the act on a popular game of the time, BEAT THE STUPID NEANDERTHAL.
