"WHY IS DUKE NUKEM 3D THE BEST? Even running in super crisp 800x600 SVGA it blasts along faster than every other comparable 3D PC title. It's not pure speed at the expense of versatility either it is possible to look up, down, or sideways at any time, with the bitmapped scenery undergoing minimal deformation and no speed loss whatsoever. The engine also caters for full interaction, so bullets leave pock marks on walls, enemy's blood drips down crates and earthquakes cause huge sections to shift altogether, thereby granting access to new locations. It all contributes to the feeling of being encased within a grim world as opposed to wandering through impregnable, static corridors. The effect is hugely rewarding and is surely the direction in which such games should be heading. Computer Playe PC Entertainme \"A perfect 10!\" Out of 5 stars This potential has luckily been exploited too. So often games fail to capitalize on excellent technologies but each of Duke Nukem's levels are noticeably different, being packed with huge ramps, drops, lifts, jumps and cunningly hidden secret areas.

Publishers have been feeling the sting of CGW's Adventure Games Contributing Editor since she purchased her first comput er, an Apple II +, back in 1981. In 1982, she co-founded the original GameSiG on CompuServe, where publisher Russell Sipe discovered her and asked her to write for this magazine. Thus began the Scorpion's Tale in 1983, and the rest, as they say, is herstory. Arguably the most experienced, most outspoken critic of unimaginitive or sloppy adventure game design, her loyal audience wouldn't have her any other way.

"JOHNNY WILSON edi.toia 3D Or Not3D That is the Question for Gamers of all Types f I were \"just a gamer\" instead of a gamer who covers this industry for a living, I'd be asking myself a question. That question is, \"Why does it seem I'm always having to upgrade my machine in order to get to that next level of game experience?\" The fol. low-up question is, \"Why don't these next levels happen by pro gramming alone?\" The answer to the second ques. tion is that to a certain extent they do. Some fanatic programmers like the guys at id manage to give us a new type of experience and it causes a revolution. As other teams try to raise the ante on the programming breakthrough, they put more and more pressure on the hardware. Eventually, the programmers reach a critical juncture, a point of diminishing returns. They have accomplished miracles, but you can't tell they have because they've caused just enough burden on the hardware to create a noticeable performance hit. This is when we need hardware to move to the next level. That's part of the answer to the first question. You are constantly being challenged to upgrade your machine because the game programmers are constantly challeng. ing the limits of the available machines. Why? To a large extent it's because gamers tend to buy the types of showcase products that exploit the newest, fastest and most powerful machines. Game publishers know that gamers who purchase the latest and greatest in hardware are the most likely to buy software products that show off the capabilities of that new hardware. So, they constantly overshoot the mark in terms of machine performance in order to ride that upgrade curve. Sometimes it backfires when they get too far ahead of the curve (as it did for developers who were first out with Windows '95 native products), but sometimes it can be very lucrative (as it was for Sierra's KING'S QUEST IV and SPACE QUEST III when the first 8-bit sound cards arrived, and for Origin's WING COMMANDER series at each step of the 386, 486, Pentium upgrade cycle). So, the issue sometimes seems like a chicken and egg question. ( 3D will improve every gaming genre, but it has its price. these new cards just a new toy for those flight sim guys?\" and \"Will these cards enhance the experi ence enough to justify the price?\" Well, 3D isn't just for flight sims anymore. Action gamers know this. They've seen first-person point of view games (like DOOM and RISE OF THE TRIAD) that use 3D tricks in 2-D space transformed into real 3D products (like TERMINATOR: FUTURE SHOCK and QUAKE). Even the staple of action gaming, horizontal scrolling fighting games, have matured to a point where they have a third dimension. Space combat games like WING COMMANDER and MECHWARRIOR have used 3D to represent space combat for a long time, but new games (like Interplay's STAR FLEET ACADEMY) with more detailed ships and texture-maps, as well as special lighting effects, are invading the space held by these two leaders. Recently, we even saw a driving/shooting game, once the no-brainer capitol of action gam. ing, in development that takes place on an ice planet and uses full 3D and a sophisticated physical model to handle friction (and lack thereof), height, slopes, speed, and more. 3D has added tremendous new depth to the model. Adventure gamers and role play. ers are beginning to discover that 3D game environments seem more real than the classic 2-D rooms of years past. ALONE IN THE DARK, ECSTATICA and RELENTLESS proved the appeal of 3D in adventure games, but you haven't seen any. thing, yet. Mindscape's DARK EARTH, Psygnosis' ECSTATICA 2, and Psygnosis' CITY OF LOST CHILDREN are some of this year's titles that will be cutting edge, with Sierra's KING'S QUEST VIII coming along next Christmas with a distinctly 3D emphasis. Sports gamers will soon discover what a difference 3D sports can GAMES IN THE THIRD DIMENSION We are now at that point with 3D accelerator cards. Many gamers will plunk down several hundred dollars over the next six months in order to get a performance boost on 3D games. Others question whether 3D hardware will be worth the price.

"JOHNNY WILSON ZIFF-DAVIS PUBLISHING GROUP CHAIRMAN AND CEO Eric Hippeau lines of 3D puzzles, there may be a new style of puzzle game on the computer that will benefit from the technology. Of course, 3D anima. tion hasn't hurt classic games. Witness the facelifts 3D has given the multimedia version of MONOPOLY and some of the later BATTLECHESS products. CONSUMER MEDIA GROUP President J. Scoli Briggs Vice President J. Thomas Collingham Director of Electronic Publishing Beth Cataldo Executive Director, Research Randy Cohen Business Manager Cynthia Mason Creative Services Manager Terri Rawson Assistant to the President Francesca Koe Zift-Davis Publishing President, U.S. Publications Ronni Sonnenberg President, Interactive Media And Development Group Jeffrey Ballowe President, International Media Group JB Holston li President, Computer Intelligence/Infocorp Bob Brovin President, Training & Support Publishing Group William Rosenthal Vice President, Chief Financial Office Timothy O'Brien Vice President, General Counsel, And Secretary J. Malcolm Morris Vice President, Human Resources Rayna Brown Vice President, Planning Daryl R. Olle Vice President, Production Roger Herrmann Vice President, Controller Mark Mover Treasurer Thomas L. Wright mean-even to the statistics-oriented, \"manage only\" crowd. Tired of having a limited number of ani mated sequences for each type of hit, tackle or slam dunk? 3D graphics built around physics based models of terrain, atmos phere, and players should provide a variety as endless as real sports. For example, I'm not a soccer fan, but I recently saw a European title on the Playstation that was unbe. lievable. The different kicks, cam. era angles and shots are phenom enal. Even though I'm not a fan, the extra element of realism pulled me in. Action-oriented and stats. oriented sports gamers alike will benefit from the emphasis on 3D My favorite games are strategy and wargames. I particularly like historical wargames. When you remember that I come from a boardgame background, what have to say is of particular importance. I used to think that hexbased maps were enough (and sometimes, they are), but the fact is that 3D enhances historical wargames, as well. Now, we can have colorful Napoleonic era troops charging across a battle field-not lead soldiers on a miniatures table, but animated fig. ures with an Al all their own. Being able to take cover behind 3D terrain and having movement realistically affected by the terrain reflects just some of the advantages of putting strategy and wargames in 3D. Of course, someone might say that puzzle and classic games don't benefit from 3D technology. Even that may not be true. When I solved the broken cup puzzle in RIPPER, I suddenly felt that the 3D had both enhanced and detracted from the puzzle. The detraction was an interface problem, but the puz: zle itself was intriguing. Since many games shops carry entire HOUSE OF CARDS The bottom line is that almost every game genre is starting to get its share of 3D products. Many of these games will be written to take advantage of Direct-3D drivers in Microsoft Windows 95 which, in turn, will run faster because of 3D accelerator cards. If you like me, think that 3D significantly enhances the gaming experience, you know that you'll need an accelerator card. You've already seen how the processor intensive calculations of new 3D games is starting to hit overall game perfor mance. Imagine what happens as artists try to put more and more details on the textures. Imagine what happens when improved Al routines hit an already overworked processor. Then, what started out as a positive, suddenly becomes a negative. Yes, if I were \"just a gamer,\" I'd be wondering if I'm really going to need one of those new 3D cards. As just a gamer\" who covers this industry, I know I'm going to have to have one. As a magazine, we've chosen this issue, before many of the cards have actually hit the market, to help get you up to speed on 3D technology, give our expectations on the coming cards, tell you what to look for in a gaming-oriented 3D card, and explain what different features mean to you. We've been as practical as we can and we hope our special coverage this month will help you answer the question.

So, game publishers have to look at the potential machine base around 18-24 months in the future. As they develop these games, I can assure you that they are not thinking of 486 machines with limited RAM. At press time, the enerage machine \"on sale\" was a Pentium 133 with more than 12 MB of RAM and more than a 1 GB hard disk (Source: Ziff-Davis' Consumer PC Index). The best use of that power is currently through Windows 95 games. Win 95 is the best transitional tool we leve for getting the computer game industry to migrate to: a) standard drivers for sound, video, 3-D; b) Inue 32. bit computing that will eventually enable us to use Pentium Pros for gaming and go beyond; and c) standard comectivity for multiplayer games with elaborately hardcoding nehwork solutions. 10 pages on the bloody Playstation?

Brian Griffin Bellefonte, PA m Playstation in CGW? Puh-lecze! What next? CameBoy cover stories? Kevin Bassler Atlanta, GA WINDOWS WATCHING I was cruising through the computer shops the other day and I noticeda weird thing. Most of the games and utilities were for Windows 95. I am not currently a Windows 95 user because I like plain DOS and I think that the computer evolution which Win 95 is currently at is not needed. So many people have 486s with 4-8 MB of RAM. I tested Win95 and found out that almost 90% of games and utilities would not run or would be very slow due to memory shortage. I think it's not fair to Win 3.1 and DOS users. Windows 95 is taking over the computer markct and I think it's currently way ahead of computer technology itself. What I mean is that computers that run Win 95 fast are so expensive and most people have 486s,making it impossible to run and use games. I hope Microsoft would reconsider the RAM and other abilities of computers that most people have. Mike D Andreyev Internet Subscriber SUPPLEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON Loved your Playstation coverage in your May issue. As a longtime owner of both PCs and consoles, I felt that there were many console games that were just as good as their PC counterparts. How about some coverage of the Sega Saturn? Considering the recent translations of several Saturn games for the PC and vice-versa (if I'm not mistaken, COMMAND AND CONQUER is being developed for Saturn), as well as the large number of RPGs and strategy games coming out for Saturn (especially by the company Working Designs, which specializes in RPGs and strategy games), it seems that coverage of Saturn is in order. Walter \"PsychoKick\" Yoon Comell University The Playstation supplement was a self-supporting section which didn't take any pages away from our regular PC coverage. We wanted to gauge the interest of our readers in looking toward publishing our own Playstation book. We feel so good about that market that our parent company, Ziff-Davis, has just purchased Sendai Publishing.

So, let me recomend a good left-handed joystick, the QuickShot (QS206 Skymaster). The throttle is set low on the left, as are the extra buttons and turbo switch, and the trim controls are set on the right, so no more hitting them with the side of your hand when banking left.

Because you won't find many people among your friends with cnough space in their rooms to house four clesktop computers with 17 inch monitors, and you will find even less who will want to haul their machines to their friends houses or clubhouse every second weekend or so. The laptop is the ideal solution, and we need the prices of them to come down to where they are affordable. Maybe next year, when there are Pentium 500s or a new generation of 686 processors and the minimum requirements for getting a new game running are Pentium-133s with 32 MB RAM, those laptops will be affordable. It would be nice, if we then had the right games to play on those \"ridiculously low-tech\" machines. Christian Jentzsch from the Internet No, but our Sex Addicts Anonymous chapter hus volunteered to start one. SAGE ADVICE The best advice you could give computer game buyers today is to always wait four-six months after a game's initial release before buying it. This allows: a) time to read the review in CCW; b) time for the vil patch file to be released; and c) time to shop for the best price.

And now compare that game to a laypothetically-graphically enhanced KAMPFGRUPPE 2 with streamlined gameplay, more units, more maps and some added features. Which game would be the better one? Or imagine RAILROAD 'TYCOON with network capability. Great game? Right. What about simula tions? Do we really have to wait that long for WORLD Circurr II, which probably won't run properly on a P90-machine, when all we need is WORLD CIRCUIT with network capability? We do need more games like CIVNET, NETMECH OR WARCRAFT || (hopefully MASTER OF ORION I will be of the same kind), in short, games with multi-player capability. And you don't need 64 MB of RAM and a Pentium 200 to make decent games, just look at SPACEWARD Hol, still a first class choice, if you like to have some fun with a few friends. Or take even . 1830, where you don't need even a network, but can play it hot-seat. So the next logical step in computer gaming is the laptop!

I have a long experience in computer gaming, and I think we have seen a lot of fantastic games. Just take a look at the CCW Hall of Fame. CIVILIZATION is one of those great games of all times, and I think the two successor games, CiVNET and Civ II, are demonstrating the direction gaming should take. Okay. Civ II is a great game and the improvements made in comparison to CIVILIZATION are welcome. But the improvements in CiVNET are even more welcome, because battling it out with real opponents is infinitely more interesting than punishing some computer dogbrains. Better graphics are fine, but better graphics don't mean better game play. Take one really old game from Your Hall of Fame, let's say In the words of Laugh-In's Arte Jolmson, \"Very interesting!\" We ure seeing lots of laptops beginning to enter the consumer market and, us you probably noticed in our suney, a few of them are useful for gamers.

Your first puzzle is figuring out just how to play. The object is to search the house of the late pro fessor Jonathon William Faulkner following some vague instructions left in his will. As you navigate through an extravagant mansion aiming for \"hot spots\" that will trigger audio/video hints or lead you into other rooms, you'll find cryptic clues, complicated word puzzles and cryptograms. Deciphering each of these does not in itself solve the puzzle, you must keep note of any other snip pets you pick up along the way and piece them together to form an overall conclusion. Gameplay is slow; after a few frustrating hours I felt no clos. er to the solution. However, the clearly executed VIRTUAL SNOOKER If you enjoyed VIRTUAL Pool, then chances are you'll enjoy Interplay's VIRTUAL SNOOKER, even though (or perhaps, because) the table is more forgiving than the real thing. The mechanics of cue control are very intuitive. Using the mouse and the \"S\" key lets you simulate the stroking movement of the cue. You can increase or decrease the JULY 1996 CG "

Z. D announced its purchase of the Sendai Publishing Group (Electronic Gaming Monthly Cyber Sports, Computer Game Review, Intelligent Gamer, PSX, Internet Underground, and EGM2) on May 9, 1996. Jon Lane, former publisher of Computer Gaming World, will become the Group Publisher of the Sendai Publications Group, while Steve Harris, founder/publisher of the Sendal Group, will become a ZD vice-president and focus on electronic publishing. Dale Strang, former associ ate publisher of PC Games and publisher of Amiga World and Desktop Video magazines, is the new publisher of Computer Gaming World. As of press time, Z-D announced that it would no longer be publishing Computer Game Review and that subscriptions and ad pages would be rolled into Computer Gaming World. SAM have graphics accelerators use the main memory/CPU bus itself. Intel is calling the new interface the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP). AGP promises to allow graph. is accelerators to take advan tage of the main memory bus' 450+ MB/sec bandwidth, and alleviate bottlenecks on the PCI bus. An added advantage of this implementation is more PCI bus bandwidth left over for other devices like hard-disk con trollers, network cards, and a lit tle down the road, sound cards. Although AGP equipped motherboards won't ship until mid 1997, they'll allow game devel opers to build more complex, polygon-intensive scenes into their titles, allowing them to more accurately model realworld scenes. Intel has inked a deal with anh Lockheed Martin to incorporate LM's Real 3D chip on Intel motherboards in the second half of 1997. The chip will use the AGP interface, and will also deliver 2D graphics as well as digital video. The move is seen by some as hostile toward thirdparty graphics-hardware vendors, since the LM-Intel solu. tion could obviate the need for add-in graphics hardware. But the AGP specification does have provisions for an AGP slot for add-in cards, and several prominent graphics chip makers have announced their intent to use AGP for future products. In the meantime, the PCI bus should provide plenty of bandwidth for first-generation 3D games, and AGP will hopefully pave the way for even more compelling titles late next year. -Dave Salvator Orphe RAM 1886 LIKTELLIGENT GAMER GAMECUBDGE LA the PCI bus can actually be a performance bottleneck.

Along with the 200 MHz Pentium chip, the P5-200CDR also uses the newest Intel Pentium support chips and SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic RAM) memory chips; the memory is in DIMM pack ages, so you can expand one DIMM at a time, instead of in pairs as is required with SIMMs. You'll also find 512K of synchronous cache memory. All this adds up to give the system processing performance about 20 percent faster than our baseline Zephyr Onyx 166. MHz system, but only about 10 percent faster than the blazing Falcon Northwest P166. The peripheral list is what makes the P5.200CDR stand out. The most original addition is a 4x CD-ROM reader/2X writer that can be used to create your own CD-ROMs. Whether you want to create a quickinstall backup of your hard drive, create your own audio CDs, or get that 400MB down. load collection off your hard disk, you'll find the CD-ROM writer a valuable tool. Of course. 4X speed is passé as far as gamers are concerned, so Gateway has also included a conventional Wearnes 8X CDROM. Although Wearnes isn't exactly a household name, Gateway hasn't skimped on the other components. Video is provided by a speedy 2MB Matrox MGA Millenium card, known for providing top-notch Windows and DOS perfor mance. Audio is provided by an Ensoniq SoundScape VIVO card, which sports wavetable audio (and sounds pretty good considering it has but 1 MB of ROM). Wrapping up the package is a 17-inch Vivitron monitor, 104 key keyboard, and room-shak ing Altec Lansing ACS 400 speaker and subwoofer package. It's game-ready with a Gravis Gamepad, but you'll likely want to replace that with a real joystick. The pre-production unit i evaluated was very impressive for the most part. Unfortunately, driver problems kept the Wearnes CD-ROM from working under DOS, and the CD-R wasn't ready in time for the preview, so our tests were limited to Win 95. Performance there was exemplary, though, even when running DOS games under Win 95. The only other glitch was a jumpy joystick reading-likely the SoundScape card not liking the system's blazing speed. But considering the amount of stuff you're getting here for $3,999, another $25 for a dedicated game card doesn't seem unreasonable. Assuming the CD-ROM driver problems are worked out before the machine ships, this looks like a new contender for the Ultimate Game Rig title.

Since we previewed the game in February (Hands On, CGW #139), not much has changed. The interface is still confus ing and very daunting to newcomers. You'll have to read the manual to find out how to play, but even the manual doesn't explain gameplay mechanics adequately. The game also starts out fairly slow, which, combined with the cryptic interface, will turn off many players. In fairness, CHAOS OVERLORDS has all the ingredients of a strat egy title, such as combat, tech research and conquest of different sectors in the city grid, but it just isn't that fun.

As he progresses in training, new powers of the Force will be available to him, including the Jedi Knight: Dark Forces il In this stunning sequel to Dark Forces, LucasArts has pulled out all the stops to create a truly awesome 3D experience. LucasArts showed us a pre-alpha version of the game on a P166 equipped with a 3D graphics board, and the visuals were incredible. The envi. ronment and characters are constructed completely of 3D, texture mapped polygons, and the game takes advantage of 3D boards to eliminate jagged lines or pixellated graphics at close range. The 3D boards also enable dynamic light sourcing which illuminates darkened corriders with laser fire. Even the unenhanced version is graphically appealing, with visuals comparable to DUKE NUKEM 3D. Apart from the beautiful graphics, JEDI KNIGHT should bring more enemies to the table, including an intimidating rience while roaming through dark, undead-infested corridors. In Blizzard's tribute to the clas sic dungeon romps like Rogue, several key features separate this RPG from others in the genre are: its isometric look, similar to CRUSADER's interface; graphics that look like beautiful prerendered artwork; and multiplayer capability. While RPGs have previously been strictly single player, DIABLO lets you explore its dungeons with up to three others. For those who loved old table-top RPGs where interaction with other players was key, DIABLO looks like it could be the RPG that finally captures the true feel of those classic D&D adventures. CGW was able to see the first few lev. els of DIABLO, crammed with treasure chests and monsters. and even with all the complicated elements and lush graphics, the action was still smooth and fluid.

Although some of the gameplay involves searching for keys and special items, the main focus is action: large, motion-captured characters hack enemies in a variety of thrusts, swings and crushing death blows. Not only are the movements fluid and realistic, but special doubling techniques create the illusion that the polygonal characters are more detailed than they really are. The game's graphics engine has been in devel opment for three years, and it looks superb. There's only one problem: there isn't a drop of blood anywhere. Perhaps it will be added later, but our under standing is that Scavenger doesn't have the stomach for it.

"SNEAK GPREVIEW GATVESTILL IN DEVELOPMENT Get Ready TO RUMBLE Id Signs A Death Warrant For 2D Gaming, 486s, And Everybody Who Enters Their 3D Nightmare By V. Long escribing QUAKE is like talking about sex-it must be experienced to be fully appreciated. Pictures pale in comparison, because QUAKE IS about being there, not observing from a distance. Action gamers around the world have done just that by downloading the QUAKE DeathMatch multiplayer test (test). But Qtest is not QUAKE. The unfinished version of QUAKE we played was a vast improvement over Otest. Many gamers expect QUAKE--an immersive and visceral first-person shooter using true 3D polygon-based modelling, fluidly rendered in real-time-to usher in a new era of gaming. When id agreed to show us the nearly completed game, I didn't have to check my notes. CGW Technical Editor Dave Salvator and I jetted to Mesquite, Texas, and met with renowned talents John Carmack, John Romero, Michael Abrash, Sandy Peterson, and the rest of the id crew. Between being blown to bits by howling members of the Texan assassins in DeathMatch con tests, we saw the technology and design that I am convinced is the vanguard of a terrifying new level of immersive interactivity. PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE MONSTERS The welcoming committee that ushered us into the much larger, more complex, and beautifully crafted levels was QUAKE's ghoulish cast of characters. Despite some previous skepticism, the monsters' Al appeared strong enough to make solo-play palm-sweatin' fun. With creatures this brainy and brawny, put yourself on the endangered list. Upon encountering the fiendish hordes, we realized QUAKE lacked the auto-aiming feature found in Doom and Qtest. Although QUAKE provided some up/down compensation, side-to-side corrections no longer existed. Lead programmer John Carmack explained that it was a hotly debated topic. We settled on removing auto-aiming because doing so rewards skill, and the less-skilled players seem to get a bet. ter sense of accomplishment when they finally get the hang of it.\" Game designer Sandy Petersen gave me good advice: \"You need to aim.\" Another controversial change from id's previous splatterfests is that QUAKE will not have a map fea. ture. No matter how much CG JULY 1996 "


"SNEAK PREVIEW . QUAKE tle artwork feeds the pyrotechnical proclivities deep in everyone's soul. Some weapons are undergoing facelifts as well as functional stroking. For example, the double-barrelled shotgun sports ribs, and has an improved shot pattern. The grenade launcher's graphics are in transition, while the rocket launcher's rate of fire and blast radius are being increased for maximum impact. One thing remained the same-there's no story line, besides the eternal struggle between good (you) and the hordes of unrelenting evil. Jay Wilbur, id's \"biz guy,\" elaborated, \"It's thinner than soap-film at this point...we'll thicken it later. I look at it this way: A bad game with a great story is a bad game. A great game with a bad story is still a great game.\" GEYSER OF GUTS An Ogre reels from the blast which renders an unidentified monster into a shower of giblets. anyone begs or pleads, the design team believes that an automap detracts from the suspense of facing horrors around every corner. The interface has also changed some from the Qtest version. It now includes an ammo count that provides more details than the one in Doom, and has expanded on Doom's running commentary at the top of the screen. Besides telling you when you've stumbled on a secret or goodie, you'll also find your death unceremoniously ridiculed with quips like \"VLong tries to put the pin back in\" or \"Fragula rides Romero's rocket.\" In addition, menu options will let you perform several basic func. tions like start a new game, save or load a game, configure controls, etc. But if you liked the pull-down command line in Qtest, rest assured it will remain in QUAKE. Some of the commands have been changed or removed, though, so don't expect your favorite keys or console com mands to work the same in the release version. And for those of you who routinely escape annihilation by cheating, you'd better learn to fight, because you won't have hotkey cheats like Super Jump to save your cowardly skin. American McGee, a level designer as well as id's acknowledged DeathMatch king, remarked sternly, \"People should not be using Super Jump. It's out.\" WASN'T BEAUTY THAT KILLED THE BEAST When you wax a brute like the Shambler, you'll get to see his entire lifeless carcass Stetched out, unlike Doom's post-mortem mush. The red muzzle spray indicates this guy's shots are on target with an Ogre in the background, MY, WHAT A LOVELY PLACE YOU HAVE HERE We noticed an abundance of rich new textures, such as stained glass, wood panels, and marble-like surfaces. If you didn't like the fee. ble pixel shower explosions in Qtest, you'll be happy to know there are now full-fledged fireball explosions with particles billowing outward. Artist Adrian Carmack showed me that the fireballs are actually six frames of bitmapped animation. It's unfortunate that id had to resort to 2D art for explosions and other graphics like torches, but programmer Michael Abrash explained that even modeling a candle flame in real-time 3D brings a Pentium to its knees. Regardless of how they're generated, I still like the explosion graphics-it's amazing how a litLEVELS TO EXPLORE AND ESCAPE Story or not, what I remember most is the overwhelming sense of actually being there-wading through vaulted subterranean corridors flooded in waist-deep water, gawking at magnificent cathedral-like chambers opulently filled with stained glass, and running like hell away from the hordes of Satan's minions bent on having me for dinner. Game programmer Mike Abrash saw my hair standing on end as I survived Sandy Petersen's perilous SMOTTE level, and dryly remarked, \"There's no doubt you feel that the levels are inhabited.\" There were three modes of difficulty (easy, intermediate, and hard). The difficulty modes affect the number of monsters, and Hard mode alters the levels physically. John Carmack is working on adding an Ultra Hard mode that will make the monsters faster and even stronger. JULY 1996 CG "


"SNEAK PREVIEW . QUAKE Quakell and Beyond LET'S MEET OUR CONTESTANTS As in Doom, you'll encounter legions of soldiers turned evil. The grimy Grunt totes a shotgun, but is dwarfed by the beefier Enforcer who wields a laser blaster. Rottweilers often accompany these bad boys. As in WOLFENSTEIN 3D, I felt a little guilty putting these snarling canines to sleep despite their propensity to gnaw on my leg. These three foes exist only on the Military levels. The pink-fleshed Fiend is much more dangerous and pissed than its equally muscular Demon brethren from Doom. Its scythe-like talons and immense bounding leap help make short work of its victims. The bald-headed Ogre, brandishing a chainsaw and lobbing grenades, may not move as quickly but also deserves careful treatment ID WIZ-KID JOHN CARMACK UAKE isn't finished as of this writing, but that didn't stop John Carmack from talking about his hopes for the sequel. He explained, \"The immediate plan is to move the current tools to the NT platform, and to develop new technology and tools that will gradually be introduced in developing and refining Quake II. My goal is to make content creation easier for the rest of the id team.\" The use of Direct Color rather than palettes will be one fundamental change for the future. Direct Color gives programmers and artists more freedom with lighting effects and tricks (including clouds and colored lighting), all of which contribute to an immersive atmosphere. Carmack added that, \"QUAKE will be id's last pure planar polygonbased engine. The future will utilize much more advanced geometries, and will allow the programmers to specify the curvature and even roughness of surfaces.\" \"Like Doom, QUAKE is very good at generating indoor environments, but doesn't do outdoor stuff as well as we'd like.\" To that end, he is looking at fractalated landscapes for creating realistic outdoor vistas. Even with the new technologies, the characters themselves will continue to use polygons, because \"other technologies, such as typical software voxel rendering, are relatively poor at perspectives. They do not generate the convincing impression of near or far the same way polygons do.\" He envisions twice as many polies will be used to generate future characters. \"Current QUAKE models have 200 to 500 polygons in each figure. These numbers will go up somewhat in QUAKE II, but by the time we get our next generation of technology. the average character should have over 1000 polygons.\" The bottom line is that Carmack and his colleagues seem to have every intention of blowing your mind as well as your budget in the coming years. ZZAPP! Beware the Shambler's belly-aching it often spells a lightning bolt is about to punch through your chest. Ouch! The levels clearly reflected the personalities of their designers. For example, Tim Willits, a Raiders of the Lost Ark fan, is known for Indiana Jones.type levels-walls that spew flying nails, spikes that impale from above, and devices that result in quick decapitation. In general, McGee designs the Metal levels, Tim Willits does the Medieval, Petersen does Fantasy (a subset of Medieval), and John Romero does the Military and some Medieval. In case you're wondering, the answer is: No, the Quake Editor will not be released. Even if it were, few aspiring level-builders have a NextStep box needed to run it. But Jay Wilbur encourages intrepid programmers to create their own QUAKE editors and custom levels. As with Wol.f3D and Doom, id currently plans to release the specs. O NASA FOR YOUR EYES ONLY Salivate all you want, but id will not release its Quake Editor. Besides, you probably don't have a NextStep box to run it on, anyway. Watch the Net for plenty of home-grown hacks. CG JULY 1996 "


"SNEAK PREVIEW . QUAKE The Shambler lumbers along like the Abominable Snowman, and smashes its victims with gargantuan claws. Beyond spitting distance, it hurts lightening from its belly. Avoid it or prod some Fiends into attacking it for you. On the other hand, Zombies can only be permanently laid to rest with grenades, rockets, or the axe. Despite its rigor mortis clumsiness, the Zombie excels at flinging pieces of decaying flesh and can make your life miserable. Given the chance, the metal-clad Knight and Death Knight will slash you to shish-kabob. The burlier Death Knight can hurl \"magic missiles\" that look like a flurry of spikes with green tracers. The pale levi. tating Scrag has the same magic attack. Don't think that jumping into water offers any measure of safety, either. Spending too much time fully submerged means drowning. \"Bad\" water will rob you of health. Some pools harbor swarms of voracious Rotfish that do more than nibble. As always, the id guys kept a few morsels from plain sight. Persistent poking around yielded information that they're still working on the Spawn, which bounces around and body slams you into submission. Its big brother, endearingly named Vomitus, drags along and spits hurtful chunks at you. The Shalrath and Shub.niggurath are the shareware and registered bosses, respectively; at the time, both were still in the embryonic stages of development The Flying Dragon that majestically graced the screenshots id released last year won't be included... at least, not in QUAKE I. Look for it in Quake II. KING-SIZED BUGLIGHT The lightning gun could be considered the BFG of QUAKE. Its bolt bums through everything until it hits a solid object, but it won't last long without a recharge. BIGGER TOYS FOR BADDER BOYS Feeding gamers' ravenous appetites for playthings that go bang, QUAKE offers an arsenal of goodies. Doom-fans will feel right at home with the shotgun and double-barrelled shotgun. These boomsticks work best for sweeping Rotfish, Rottweilers, and Grunts out of your path. ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO A beseiged player tums his attention to the Scrag after having gibbed its playmate, the Ogre, whose remains well, remain. As in Doom, acquiring a rocket launcher is a treat. This time, though, rockets leave a blazing exhaust trail before vaporizing beasties into showers of giblets. The dynamic lighting effects, which John Carmack coded in an hour as a bet, make rockets a joy to fire down darkened corridors. Forget about using them on the Spawn. Trust me. Among the weapons unique to QUAKE is the grenade launcher, which uses the same ammo as the rocket launcher. You toss the ord nance on a relatively short parabolic trajectory, and it bounces around before it finally says hello. My favorites are the nail gun and super nail gun. Nothing compares to hosing down a Scrag or DeathMatch adversary under a torrent of carpenter's tacks. You'll find the ammo strewn about in boxes marked with the Nine Inch Nails logo. (Speaking of which, NIN's Trent Reznor is doing all of QUAKE's sound effects. As for music, there will be none, just ambient noise.) The BFG of Quake weapons is the lightning gun. Amped by battery power, this one sends a searing white streak as far as you can see until it strikes a solid object. Monsters and DeathMatch opponents are not considered solid objects, no matter how many get toasted along the way. Despite the premature coverage you may have seen elsewhere, there is no hammer in QUAKE, period. Get over it. Instead, you get an axe when you run out of ammo. DeathMatch opponents will see your character sling an empty gun over your shoulder and whip out the axe for a melee. Don't sneer at this primitive implement. I sur. prised and nearly fragged an id guy or two with the axe during our impromptu six.way DeathMatch. Both John Carmack and McGee tell me that players who accumulate Super Health or Quad Damage Amplifier or both will be powerful enough to lop heads with the axe. Satisfied? QUANTUM LEAP FOR MULTIPLAYER GAMING Toys this destructive are immensely more fun when mirthfully inflict e d on like-minded buddies. Whether you're in DeathMatch or Team DeathMatch, it's strangely satisfying to watch your playmate's 3D-rendered head flip down the hall after being decapitated with high-caliber JULY 1996 CG "


"SNEAK PREVIEW . QUAKE projectiles, and it feels even better if you pulled the trigger. Anguished Screams add tremendously to the experience, and offer reassurance that you've made your point, both in combat and coop mode. Qtest's dynamic entry feature for network games (players can join network frag-fests whenever they wish without forcing everyone to restart the session) was nice, but Quake will vastly enlarge its reach by adding the ability to simultaneously connect players via serial, IPX, and TCP/IP. So you'll be able to dial into a network game where other players are connected over the LAN and the Internet. John Cash, id's \"networking guy,\" is working feverishly to include these features in the first release, and plans to allow multiple modems and a \"spectator\" mode later. QUAKE will support the Beame & Whiteside TCP/IP stack, and possi. bly a few others. Id plans to do a Win95 port about a month after the DOS version ships, and this should resolve TCP/IP issues for many players. Online gaming services like Mpath, DWANGO, TEN, and Catapult are under consideration, but \"nothing is set in concrete.\" However, it appears Quake will offer enough to keep many gamers happy until something firmer develops. TIME FOR YOUR AXE KICKING Contronting the Shambler with a mere axe usually means one of two things: (1) you're nuts, or (2) you're bored with life. QuakeHits the Hard Stuff DO THE MATH! According to John Carmack, a realistic minimum system for com fortably running Quake at default settings would be a Pentium 60 with 8 MB of RAM. He added that almost any video card is adequate, since QUAKE can use as little as 256 KB of graphics memory. \"While you can play QUAKE on a 486 (just as some people play Doom on 386s), it won't be very fun\" and may require decreasing the screen size and turning off the sound. QUAKE is very math-intensive, and it squeezes every last drop out of the Pentium's floating point unit. innovative game engines like QUAKE's can dazzle, even without dedicated 3D hardware. But to bring the next generation engines to fruition, that's going to take new metal.id's John Carmack predicts the next leap to occur in about 1 to 2 years from now. The technology will rely heavily on hardware-accelerated rasterization, because by then, all systems will have it.\" Rendition's Verité chip is id's current point of reference. They're also considering the S3 ViRGE chip because of its projected large market share, though according to Carmack, its performance isn t up to id's standards. The 3dfx chip is also a strong contender for id, because of its \"ass-kicking performance, but because it's a 3D-only solution, they're concerned it may only garner a limited market share But id isn't waiting around to take advantage of emerging 3D hardware. Already, they've got the QUAKE engine running on Rendition's chip, taking advantage of Verite's bilinear interpolation, perspective correction. MIP mapping, Z-buffering, and Gouraud shading. QUAKE delivers smooth frame rates at its native 320 x 200 frame size with no special graphics hardware. But using the Rendition chip, the result is a smooth 30 fps at larger frame sizes along with cleaner individual frame quality as well. ld is releasing a driver spec to 3D hardware vendors who want to accelerate QUAKE in DOS. But QUAKE will more likely get to 3D hardware via Microsoft's Direct3D API when id ships a Windows 95 port, shortly after the DOS version heads out the door. When QUAKE hits the streets, your Pentium rig will move things along just fine. But the coming 3D hardware will make your big pic ture bigger, and add panache to the overall effect. Currently, only Rendition accelerates the DOS version of QUAKE but other players will, most likely jump into the game. We've seen the Rendition-accelerated version, and the difference is pretty palpable. As other hardwareaccelerated versions appear we'll have at 'em and let you know if we like what we see.-Dave Salvator & V. Long \"WHEN IT'S READY\" As you're reading this, it's likely that QUAKE version 0.9 is done and downloadable from numerous worldwide Internet sites.

"Jadi49 Lite Vhe Nes PimnSLO 3D Graphics: Realism and Reality on the Hardware Frontier by Loyd Case and Dave Salvator to learn (as if computers didn't have enough arcane terminology now). But what exactly is 3D graphics, and what will it bring to the party for gamers? We'll cut through the hype and aplly some English to the technospeak that describes the new features 3D hardware vendors are implementing. We'll also take a look at a few new pieces of hardware, all of them promising in one respect or another. Since most of the boards we saw at press time weren't yet ready for release, we can't really pass final judgment, but we can give you some idea of what to expect. here's a possibly apocryphal story about a game developer who was showing his mother his latest flight simulation creation. This was a few years ago, when a fast 386 was a performance hot-rod. Back then, a sim like FALCON 3.0 used about 20 triangles to approximate the shape of an entire jet fighter. Try as she might, the developer's mother couldn't see the game-all she saw were random geometric shapes changing willy-nilly on the computer screen. Face it: computer game graphics is all about optical illusions where game developers try to convincingly simulate reality on a flat PC monitor. That game designers can take us into a virtual world and make us forget our real one for even brief periods is testament to their creative abilities. One key element of creating the illusion is 3D graphics. For decades, 3D graphics has been something of a holy grail in the com puter industry. Even a scant few years ago, dedicated 3D hardware cost tens of thousands of dollars. Soon, the cost of hardware to generate killer 3D will be in the hundreds of dollars-and the low hundreds, at that. On top of that, 3D graphics comes with a whole new set of jargon \"BUT IT LOOKS 3D TO ME\" Let's look at what 3D isn't for a moment. When gamers think of 3D games, they often think of Doom. Guess what: Doom ain't 3D. DOOM does a very good job of faking the gamer into thinking they're in a 3D environment, but they really aren't. The monsters are flat graphics--bitmaps. When you move to one side of a monster, the DOOM engine simply replaces one flat picture with another. Each creature in Doom has eight views, and there's no true up and down. A game like COMMAND AND CONQUER isn't 3D, either. All the little buildings in COMMAND AND CONQUER look 3D, but they are really pre-rendered-in JULY 1996 CG "


"GAMING IN THE NEXT DIMENSION 3D APIs and the Terror of Infinite Hardware other words, they're just flat pictures. Now you may be asking yourself, \"Titles like QUAKE and DUKE NUKEM 3D look great with my 2D graphics board, so why do I need one of these 3D deals?\" Well, 3D boards do bring new features to the table that help improve overall image quality, including frame rate-but more to the point, a 3D board lets an application off-load rendering work from the CPU, leaving more cycles free for gameplay, Al, and so on. In a true 3D environment, viewing an object from any angle is pos. sible since the game engine creates and manipulates 3D objects on the fly, and really works in three dimensions: x,y and z. There are also real calculations of depth occurring in a 3D environment. Animation should occur in real-time and be capable of realistic motion. Unfortunately, generating 3D graphics in a real-time game environ ment is a huge computational problem. Consider a real-life scene: you are standing beside a car, near a house. Because the car is in front of the house, you can't see all of the house. Some of it is obscured by the car. Now imagine moving to the right a bit. You can now see part of the house-but another part of the house you could see a moment ago is now obscured. Moving like this is no problem. Calculating and rendering a scene like this, including which parts of the scene can'l be f you've ever installed a DOS game that supports a large number of sound cards, you can probably appreciate the problem of supporting a gazillion different pieces of hardware-especially if your hardware isn't on the list. The same snafu could hold true for the new generation of 3D graphics cards. Already we're seeing vendor-specific implementations of games arrive in bundles. The ATI version of MECHWARRIOR 2, for example, won't run on a system with another vendor's card-even when Direct3D or DirectDraw drivers are properly installed. There is another way: a standard 3D Application Programming Interface (API), an interface between a piece of software (.e., a game) and a particular capability (in this case, 3D graphics.) Last year, Microsoft bought RenderMorphics, a UK developer of 3D libraries whose API, Reality Lab, and has since been re-christened Direct3D. As of this writing, Direct3D is still in late beta, but is near \"code freeze.\" Game companies will likely be shipping a few Direct3D games by Christmas, but probably not that many.

Now, let's make the problem even more complex: you can now see part of the house through the windows of the car, but the windows also reflect part of the car's interior. Oh, yeah, and it's a foggy day, too. There's been some debate as to the image quality versus frame rate issue. Some 3D hardware may have features that result in gorgeous images, but as you turn on some of these cool innovations, the frame rate goes from silky smooth to slide show. Because action and flight titles are all about 3D animation, not 3D illustration, frame rate is real. ly part of the overall \"image\" quality. Running say, US NAVY FIGHTERS at 1024x768 even on a very fast Pentium-will probably be painfully slow, especially with all the graphics goodies turned on. At times, it's almost like warping to a different location as the frame rate goes south. Even at a more sedate 640x480, most systems will have problems with a game like USNF or FLIGHT UNLIMITED. The goal is bigger frame sizes (at least 640x480 native), belter frame rates (30+ fps), and greater scene complexity (more polygons). Game developers need to strike a balance between individual frame image quality at acceptable frame rates to achieve the desired overall effect. It's too early to declare a \"winner,\" but stay tuned, we will take a head-to-head look at real 3D hardware later this year.

"GAMING IN THE NEXT DIMENSION WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN There are three main philosophies behind development of 3D graphics hardware today: 3D-only, graphics plus 3D and the Swiss army knife approach (which handles several different multimedia chores, not just graphics). 3D-only vendors include 3Dfx, Yamaha and NEC, while Rendition, S3, Matrox and ATI are delivering full-featured graphics solutions in a single chip. The multimedia chip sets include nVidia, Chromatic and Brooktree. Let's look at each of them individually, and also take a brief look at resulting 3D graphics boards for PCs. 3D Graphics 3D-ONLY SOLUTIONS 3D-only solutions will likely appear as add-on boards, typically requiring a dedicated PCI slot. These boards are going for all-out per. formance, so the focus is killer 3D performance, and leaving 2D graphics to the existing board. These vendors figure that most gamers already have a fast graphics board of some kind. But available PCI slots are becoming more scarce, so that's a concern--no free slot, no add-on. ear filtering with MIP mapping, you get bilinear MIP mapping. One of the most dramatic increases in image quality occurs when you perform bilinear filtering to the two closest MIP maps, then average out the result. This is often called trilinear filtering, but is more accurately known as trilinear MIP mapping. Like bilinear filtering, trilinear MIP mapping adds a lot of processing overhead to the 3D pipeline, and can really drive frame rates south. *MIP Mapping Importance: High * Trilinear Filtering Importance: Moderate Fog. This is just what it sounds like, but simulating fog or smoke effects also requires a lot of computation. *Importance: High Alpha Blend. Remember our example of looking through a car window? Simulating transparency or partial transparency can be tricky and expensive in terms of computation. Alpha blending is one technique to handle transparency effects. *Importance: Low Lighting Effects. Remember those cool flashing lights in Doom? Guess what those weren't really lights; they were really clever graph ics tricks. In true 3D, lighting is realistically calculated, and if you have a bunch of lights, all throwing shadows, it can really eat up CPU or processor cycles. *Importance: Moderate Sub-Pixel Accuracy. Remember our definition of filtering and MIP mapping? The result of those operations need to be applied accurately to the underlying flat surface; that's what sub-pixel accura cy is for. It also smoothes a 3D object's motion, helping to reduce the \"ratcheting\" effect. *Importance: Low Gouraud Shading. This technique is named for its inventor, and when you have two flat polygons connected together, the actual con necting vertex can make the object look unrealistic. Gouraud shading simply blends in the colors of the two polygons to make the joined vertex look seamless and natural. Flat shading is the other predomi nant type of shading, where a single color is used to fill a single polygon. Its main advantage is that it's less processor-intensive, but flatshading gives a less convincing effect. *Importance: High Z-Buffering. One of the trickiest tasks in real-time 3D calculations is figuring out which parts of the scene are obscured, known as hid. den surface removal. Z.buffering is one computational method for calculating which objects lie in front and only rendering the visible ones. It's downside is that it's memory and CPU intensive. *Importance: Moderate Technospeak aside, all of these features sound really great, and the resulting scenes are pretty impressive. But different 3D chips accelerate these features with varying degrees of completeness. Some chips only handle part of the rendering, leaving the CPU to do the rest. The unfortunate result is that your frame rate may still slow down when you turn on a cool rendering feature. Here again, the jury is still out. Let's move on to some of the new 3D accelerator technologies and also take a look at some early boards that use them. VOODOO BY 3DFX The Voodoo graphics chipset by 3Dfx may be the highest performing 3D graphics solution available. The real issue with VooDoo will be its cost. It's a multiple chip solution with two chips, and it also needs a dedicated memory area for storing textures. Now the good part: VooDoo supports a big heap o' 3D features, and should be capable of very fast 3D rendering. If demos mean anything, overall image quality should also be superb-perhaps the best of any of the products men tioned here. Orchid has announced it will be shipping a board this summer, dubbed the RIGHTEOUS 3D, that will have 2 MB of frame buffer memory and 1 MB of dedicated texture memory. Pricing wasn't available at press time, but will likely be around $300. Also, NEC recently announced that its new high-end Power Player system will be using the 3DFX chipset for 3D graphics. ATI Xpression 3D CG JULY 1996 "


"GAMING IN THE NEXT DIMENSION YAMAHA RPA2 AND RPA3 The RPA2 chip from Yamaha was incorporated in a recent 3D graphics PCI add-on board from Paradise Graphics, the TASMANIA. But TASMANIA received relatively little support from game developers. The newer RPA3 has a good feature set, but won't be shipping until later in the summer. No pricing information was available at press time 2000 3 Stealth 3D DIAMOND NEC/VIDEOLOGIC POWERVR The POWERVR is a recently announced chipset, co-developed by NEC and Videologic. POWERVR's unique feature is a proprietary hidden surface removal method that doesn't require dedicated Z-buffer memory. Though a potential RAM saver, it's an unconventional method for handling hidden surface removal, but NEC will write support into their driver so game develpers can make regular Z-buffer calls to use it. Compaq recently announced that its Presario systems will incorporate the PowerVR chip later this year. Also, VideoLogic will be offering an add-in board for about $175. 3D Graphics Diamond's Stealth 3D 2000 well under $300 for a 2 MB card. FULL-FEATURED GRAPHICS SOLUTIONS Full-featured graphics chips incorporate 3D, 2D acceleration (for fast Windows performance) and onboard VGA and SVGA for DOS games. Because of the nature of combining multiple elements, compromises are inevitable, but there's already good potential for replac. ing your current graphics boards with one of these solutions. 3D LABS PERMEDIA 3D Labs has been in the 3D graphics business for several years, shipping high-end 3D chips for use in dedicated CAD and 3D model. ing systems. Last winter, Creative Labs shipped the VLB-only 3D BLASTER, which used a scaled-down version of 3D Labs GLINT chip. The PERMEDIA, however, is a complete reworking of 3D Labs technolo gy, and incorporates a 32-bit VGA core and a fast Windows accelerator. Creative Labs has announced that it is licensing the PERMEDIA, but hasn't mentioned any products yet. Acer will be shipping graphics cards later this summer based on PERMEDIA. 3D Labs may have a very interesting chip, but its overall performance for gaming is still an unknown. RENDITION VERITÉ Rendition is a new company focused on delivering a complete graphics solution for fast game play. We had the opportunity to see gameplay with the VERIT, and what we saw looked good. Rendition was showing INDYCAR 2, and the QUAKE graphics engine, both tuned for the VERITE. INDYCAR 2 played very well on a Pentium 100 with all ren dering features enabled. Walls looked very good close up thanks to texture filtering and MIP mapping, and the cars looked great as well. MECHWARRIOR 2 for Windows 95, which uses Microsoft's DirectDraw API, ran very smoothly on the Pentium 100-easily comparable to a Pentium 133 running one of the quickest Windows 2D accelerators available. We also checked out DOS game performance, still a critical item for today's gamers. Interestingly, VGA performance seemed only average, while SVGA performance seemed well above average for a Pentium 100. Though the VGA core is a true hardware VGA, it's not a very fast one. The SVGA implementation, though, is directly tied to the RISC processor engine used on the VERITÉ. Since most games ship ping today are SVGA, they should run very well on the Verité. Rendition has done its homework in the feature set as well, and image quality is likely to be very good, approaching that of 3Dfx at a lower cost. Also, the VERITE performs some geometry setup, so less data needs to be transferred across the PCI bus, reducing a potential bottleneck. The first product to ship with the VERITE will be Creative Labs PCI version of the 3D BLASTER. Unlike its VLB sibling, the PCI 3D BLASTER will replace the current graphics card in your PC, not merely supple. ment it. At press time, pricing hasn't been set, but it will probably be S3 VIRGE S3 has taken an existing chip, the TRIO 64V+, and added 3D capa. b ility to it. The resulting chip is the Virge, and it is even pin compatible with the TRIO 64V+. One benefit of this approach is that graphics card vendors can use existing card designs and thus quickly bring a 3D capable card to market; also, Windows performance is quite good and VGA performance seems on a par with other S3-based cards: good, but not great. However, the result is something of a compromise, and performance is somewhat open to question. We looked at a beta version of the Diamond STEALTH 3D 2000, which comes with 2 MB of DRAM. DESCENT 2 looked very nice, especially the wall textures, but the frame rate on a Pentium 133 slowed down a bit when there was a lot of action. Of course, this was a bela card, so we'll reserve judgment until we can see the shipping product. Other companies using the VIRGE include Hercules, with their TERMINATOR 64 3D, Number Nine's MOTION 332Fx and STB's POWERGRAPH 64 3D. The Hercules card will have single-cycle EDO RAM, giving it just a bit more juice in the memory department. All of these cards should hit close to $200 for a 2 MB version. JULY 1996 CC "


"GAMING IN THE NEXT DIMENSION 3D Graphics Matrox has taken a different approach with the MYSTIQUE, with more emphasis placed on 3D performance. Though based on the same basic engine as the MILLENIUM, Mystique uses a different memory controller and PCI interface chip. Matrox has added support for perspec. tive corrected texture mapping, Z-buffering, and MIP mapping. However, the MYSTIQUE doesn't support bilinear filtering or blending-fog or smoke effects are handled through four levels of Screen door transparency (if you've seen the smoke effects in CHUCK YEAGER'S AIR COMBAT, you know what screen door transparency is). Matrox's philosophy is that nothing should compromise frame rate, so they chose to forego features that could bog down frame rate. Because its raw Windows and VGA performance should be pretty high, this card bears a close look, but the feature set means that the image quality might not match those of the other solutions. Still, if the 3D performance is comparable to its SVGA and Windows abilities, this could be an interesting card. Current estimated street price is about $229. Hercules Terminator 64 3D $3 will also be doing a VRAM version of the part called the Virge FX. One caution about the Virge: early versions of the Virge support only 2 MB of DRAM, so if you have the urge to add more memory later, check the product carefully. By the time you read this, though, cards supporting up to 4 MB should be available. BLASTE Creative Labs' PCI 3D Blaster ATI 3D RAGE Like S3, ATI took an existing design, the Mach 64 used in its GRAPHICS XPRESSION and GRAPHICS PRO TURBO products, and grafted 3D capability onto it. We had the chance to play on a beta version of the 3D Xpression card, a 2 MB DRAM card. ATI supplied us with an enhanced version of MECHWARRIOR 2. Although the resolution was slightly lower (512x384 instead of 640x480), it looked very nice. Sky and ground textures had been added, and the polygon count of all the objects had been significantly increased. Better quality textures were also laid on all the objects, making this version of MECHWARRIOR 2 look as good as anything else out there. The sky textures were even animated, giving the impression of clouds scudding across the sky. All these new textures came at a cost, of course: the default installation went from 48 MB to 72 MB. As for performance, we did notice some mild frame rate hits in the heat of battle, but nothing severe. The same couldn't be said for the version of ASSAULT Rigs they supplied us--at the highest resolution, the frame rate on ASSAULT Rigs became pretty pokey. Windows perfor mance was excellent, but VGA performance was only average. The XPRESSION 3D will be priced at around the $200 mark. CIRRUS LOGIC/3DO Recently, Cirrus Logic has announced it will incorporate 3DO's M2 3D technology into its line of graphics accelerators. While Cirrus Logic's graphics chips have been at the low end of the 2D spectrum, the addition of 3D0's M2 technology could result in stellar 3D perfor mance. However, not much else is known at this time, MULTIMEDIA ACCELERATORS Several companies have taken the approach that 3D is just another facet of multimedia technology. They've taken 3D and 2D graphics, digital sound, joystick inputs and MIDI music capability and integrated them into a single chip or a couple of chips. MATROX MYSTIQUE Matrox has actually been in the 3D game for some time now. Their latest 3D card, the MILLENIUM, has also gained the reputation of being a very fast VGA and Windows card. However, the 3D feature set really wasn't tuned for games, and the MILLENIUM received almost no support from game developers.

Though an ambitious undertaking, design compromises are inevitable. Its current 3D feature set includes only Z. buffering and MIP mapping. We only saw a very early beta demo of the chip where Direct3D was still shaky, so we don't have any real low. down on this chip yet. And while its versatility is certainly impressive, its thin 3D feature set does leave us somewhat skeptical. EDGE 3D 3D Graphics Diamond's Edge 3D NVIDIA NV1 The NV1 first appeared in the Diamond EDGE 3D, and has since surfaced on the Jazz 3D Magic. The EDGE 3D was probably a product that was \"slightly ahead of its time,\" and suffered from some teething problems. Windows 2D performance was mediocre, and DOS VGA performance was pitiful. VIRTUA FIGHTER looked awfully good, and the use of the Sega control pads was pretty neat, but no other titles have appeared other than the four that shipped with the EDGE. According to nVidia, that's about to change. The Windows drivers have been beefed up, and the VGA performance has been tweaked as well. More importantly, a number of new titles are about to appear, including a hot rod version of MECHWARRIOR 2. The MIDI music sam ples have been greatly improved as well. Also, nVidia has taken the criticisms to heart, and is busy working on their next-generation NV3 chip, though details are still sketchy. We weren't able to test most of these claims at press time, but we'll definitely take a closer look at the newer NV1-based cards as they arrive. that of the 30-plus players in the 3D graphics game, many will be gone within a few years. CGW has taken a very close look at most of the major players, and what we've seen looks very encouraging. There are still questions to be answered: How will DOS games play? Will Direct3D take hold, or will developers be forced to support multiple pieces of hardware, and will hardware vendors in turn have to bundle custom.coded games to make their boards palatable? Will even 3D performance meet expecta. tions?

"TCHEVERRY VALUEBLE PLAYERS CGW Surveys The Field Of Computer Football, Baseball, Hockey, Hoops And More hen the Olympic torch fires up this summer in Atlanta, it will mark the 100th anniversary of this modern international athletic competition-a landmark event. And in the U.S., it couldn't come a moment too soon, as professional sports once again finds itself knee deep in what Pat Riley calls \"the problem of me\"-players so self absorbed that they're killing their teams and turning off their fans. Sure, it hasn't been all bad, but for every moment of triumph-Dwight Gooden's stunning no-hitter, the Bulls' awesome domination-there's been an equal act of stupidity. Players have been shoving reporters, head-butting refs, and even abandoning their teams to go water skiing, for crying out loud. But, hey, don't get us started. In the world of computer sports games, thank goodness, it's been another banner year, as games across the board continue to get better and better. Smarter Als, gorgeous motion-captured 3D graphics and more sophisticated playbooks and strategy are all helping to put computer sports fans deeper into the action than ever before. So lace up your sneakers and follow us onto the field as we survey the hits (and misses) in this year's sports games, and take a sneak peak at the most promising players in the season ahead.

"SPORTS SPECTACULAR PICSKIN PACKACING Do More Graphics And Action Equal Better Gameplay? BY TERRY COLEMAN 5 CUP s the NFL goes further into its eighth decade, questions abound. Can Jimmy Johnson, now with the Dolphins, win the Super Bowl that eluded Don Shula at the end of his record-setting career? Will George Seifert ever get the respect he deserves as coach of the 49ers? Are Emmitt Smith's hamstrings really healed? Is Dave Brown worth the millions he receives as the Giants unknown QB? What fountain of youth does Jerry Rice drink from? As this season is simulated on the silicon gridiron, similar questions are raised. Will FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL Pro return to win another CGW sports title? Will MONDAY 1 action-oriented game engines ever capture the feel of the pro passing game? Are com puter coaches soon to be on the unemployment line? And what about zone blitzes? with a joystick, this is your game. NFL PRO LEAGUE FOOTBALL (IBM, 800-426-2255) is an odd mix of stat-based realism with animation and graphics. There are plenty of classic and current teams, and enough stats to fill an encyclopedia. But the Al has strange lapses, and the entire expe. rience seems kind of sterile. For instance, when you throw a post pattern to your flanker, he's the only one who can catch it, there are no sec. ondary receivers, and no audibles. PRO LEAGUE does have modem play going for it, but the stats and realism generated aren't significantly ahead of the Haffner product to justify the hassles and the extra expense. 1 FOOTBALL HIP OR HYPE? The OT Sports version of ABC MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL has multimedia to spare, but all the Frank, Al and Dan won't mean much if it can't deliver the action. FBI DE STATISTICAL DINOSAURS A big concern for any real football fan is how the stats are generated. Problem is, the stat-based sims are fading fast in football, unlike their baseball brethren. The only pure stat sim I still recommend is 3-IN-1 FOOTBALL. (Lance Haffner, 800477-7032, or 615-366-8088). You can autoplay entire seasons in a couple of hours, and \"live\" games against the computer or hotseat vs. another human coach take maybe 30 minutes. Forget graphics, this game concentrates on a strong computer opponent and realism-the stats generated are the most accurate of any football game on the market. Every great college and pro team from the dim mists of time is included, along with the particular rules quirks for each era; Lance also sells season disks from the 1950s onward, for those who don't feel teams such as the Dallas Texans were obscure enough. If you're more interested in re-creating the Dolphins' perfect season than in timing your passes LONELY & BITMAPPED Tired of beating the AI?

"SPORTS SPECTACULAR TELUT No rookie, DIAMOND MIND was formerly known as PURSUE THE PENNANT, under a licensing agreement between its designer and the board game company of the same name. Now out on their own, the DIAMOND Mind folks offer a sim that has much to recommend it, espe. cially for seasonal replays. It's one of the fastest autoplay games avail. able, zipping through the entire National League 1995 schedule in an astonishing five minutes on a Pentium 133. By comparison, the prerelease version of FPS BASEBALL Pro took hours to sim a smaller league. Not only is DIAMOND MIND nimble, but it's deep, too, with hundreds of statistical categories available. The interface, however, is about as exciting as watching grass grow, and some may find working through the game's layered approach to locating information rather tedious. #19 83 AVG.218 OBA 292 HA1 DBI 32 KEVIN STOCKER NEW STORMFRONT COMING IN TONY LARUSSA 3 FOR 1996 gets the \"weirdest title\" award, but it's also the front-runner in the graphical baseball sim race MILLER DOES WINDOWS The latest version of Miller Associates' BASEBALL FOR WINDOWS incor porates an improved league manager module and new micro man agers, including two that correctly handle pre-closer era pitching staffs. The game comes with several oldtimer teams, three complete past sea sons (1921, 1943 and 1971) and three ballparks. Of all the stat-based sims, BASEBALL FOR WINDOWS has most pushed the envelope toward multimedia. While play is still static and text-based, it takes place atop beautifully rendered ballpark graphics. Former Detroit Tigers announcer Ernie Harwell does an enjoyable play-by-play, and for an additional 45 minutes on the CD-ROM offers viewpoints and yarns from his many years behind the mike. The charming stadium sounds in BASEBALL FOR WINDOWS beat those heard in any other baseball sim. The knock on Miller's game is that it's not very intuitive, and proba bly has the steepest learning curve of any product on the market. I've never understood why Miller Associates didn't combine the modules instead of forcing gamers to know when to click separate League Manager, Advanced Draft or Baseball for Windows icons. Consolidating the modules would make the game much less confusing for novices, with no loss in functionality. Another Miller Associates product, the BILL JAMES ELECTRONIC BASEBALL ENCYCLOPEDIA, is a must-have product for fans of the national pastime, and its stats may be imported into BASEBALL FOR WINDOWS. Bill James on CD-ROM is the final word in statistical analysis, allowing users to look up stats on any professional ballplayer that ever played, compare them, graph them and print them. In short, the Bill JAMES ENCYCLOPEDIA slices and dices stats any way you want 'em. TONY LARUSSA 3: 1996 EDITION For the new season, Stormfront Studios has released an update to their popular TONY LARUSSA BASEBALL 3. One notable improvement is the inclusion of head-to-head statistics for each batter and pitcher. Does your light-hitting shortstop own Greg Maddux? Better give him a start when the Braves are in town. Be forewarned, though, that using the head-to-head option in computer-simulated games can slow play down noticeably. Stormfront has also factored in situational batting perfor mance, impacting how hitters will do with runners in scoring position, or pinch-hitting, for example. TONY3: 96's auto play deserves mention, as it's quick, if not espe. cially accurate, CGW simulated an entire American League season in under 10 minutes. Stats were skewed to the high side offensively, though, with sixteen players cracking 30 or more homers. One outfielder had 89 errors and only three putouts, although this was an iso l ated case, and looks as though it may be an internal rating error. Oddly enough, only five saves were recorded in the entire league. Finally, the beta version we looked at had RBIs listed as a percentage, rather than the traditional raw number. Hopefully these glitches will be addressed in the final release. Overall, though. TONY 3: 1996 qualifies as a fun graphics-oriented sim that's easy to navigate, thanks to its intuitive, button-driven interface. Learning the mechanics of hitting and pitching can be tricky, and usercontrolled fielding is best left to experienced Tony players. The game includes a Fantasy Draft feature, as well as what Stormfront calls the GM Challenge, which is somewhat akin to career leagues like those found in the FRONT PAGE SPORTS series. TONY 3: 1996 also includes three announcers-Mel Allen, Lon Simmons and Hank Greenwald--who are all enjoyable and provide consistent voice-overs throughout the game. If you prefer, you can toggle the announcers off and get on with the action. WORKIN' IN A DIAMOND MIND DIAMOND MIND BASEBALL is the essence of the stat-based game: all statistics, no pizzazz. It can shake and bake the numbers as well as or better than any game on the market, but it makes no attempt whatsoever at graphics. If the idea of a game that's all blue screen puts you off, then skip ahead. If, however, you're willing to give a glance to a little game with a big-time statistical engine, then DIAMOND Mind may appeal to you. OUTTA HERE! With such a wide variety of computer baseball games available, the biggest problem facing most players will be deciding which one to get. Narrow it down by setting your priorities first. Is it graphics and action that sends you back for more, or are stats what makes your knuckle ball flutter? Either way, if you're ready to play ball, there's a game out there for you, coach.

"BASE INSTINCTS Sierra's Baseball Franchise Heads For Another Winning Season BY DENNIS MCCAULEY ST HOMER SIM, SON Sierra's improved graphics in FPS BASEBALL PRo give an edge to the action when sliding for home. ierra's Front Page Sports line has established itself as one of the most successful ongoing sports series in the annals of computer gaming. While most of the competition plays catch-up, Sierra's sims tend to dominate their respective markets year after year. CGW recently got a sneak peek at the much-awaited FRONT PAGE SPORTS BASEBALL PRO 96, scheduled for midsummer release, and while the near-beta version we saw was unfin ished in some areas and awaited fine-tuning in others, there was enough beef to indicate that, for baseball fans, 1996 could be a very good year. While the previous incarna. While the previous incarna PREVIEW tion of FPS Baseball, released GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT in 1994, was strictly an MS DOS version, the latest vintage is a native Windows 95 product, and that itself is big news. The game's lineage is apparent, however, and anyone familiar with past Front Page releases-either baseball or football-should be able to jump in and navigate through the program easily. CSNEAK er-level decisions, such as when to make the double-switch, and whether to have potato chips or pretzels during the 7th inning stretch. Gamers who want to capture the leisurely pace that is the essence of baseball can opt to play pitch by pitch, while hard-charging Type-A per. sonalities can toggle single-pitch mode and be done with it. With a little effort, players can input historical clubs into the game, or import their teams from the '94 version. Of course, BASEBALL PRO 96 retains the career mode that has become a signature of the Front Page series, Gamers can draft, trade and allocate spring training time in an effort to mold their teams. This aspect of the game holds great poten: tial, since astute managers should be able to build their rosters to suit the dimensions and characteristics of their stadium, be it Wrigley Field or the Astrodome. Whether the 96 version fulfills its career mode promise remains to be seen, however. Past editions have been criti. cized for their failure to reflect in a meaningful way the skill changes that occur over the course of a ballplayer's career. SIMLASORDA FPS BASEBALL PRO 96 offers plenty of gameplay options for would-be managers. An arcade mode allows gamers to control the pitching, hitting, and fielding of their players, while a managerial mode lets the computer handle the mechanics, so you can concentrate on the highBLEACHER FEATURES Speaking of ballparks, BASEBALL PRO 96 incorporates 3D models of every current major-league park. The stadium graphics are quite realistic and easily the best to date of any baseball sim. In general the game is much more graphically appealing than the previous edition. For this year's model, Sierra's graphics crew employed the same highres motion capture based animation that made FPS PRO FOOTBALL 96 so dazzling. While this technology provides very fluid player movement, it does leave some very obvious jagged edges in close-up shots. Perhaps the oddest graphical occurrence in BASEBALL PRO 96, though, is the ball itself, which occasionally takes on the dimen sions of an overripe cantaloupe. Fruit salad, anyone? Sierra's well done CAMS (camera angle management system) is back, offering near-unlimited viewing angles as well as a chance for gamers to save and edit tapes of their big plays. Sierra is also touting improved Al and a fast sim mode that they contend is an improve ment over the 94 model. Frankly, the sims that I ran on a high-end Pentium were frustratingly slow-it took nine hours to go through half a season--and the statistical accuracy was nothing to write home about. Hopefully these issues will be addressed by time the final release takes the field. TOO MUCH REALISM? The sparse crowd in attendance at this game must have been modeled after the '94 strike season.

"SPORTS SPECTACULAR HD BUA HOOP DREAMS Computer BasketballNo Longer A 3-Point Shot BY TERRY COLEMAN TAKIN' IT INSIDE NBA LIVE 96 actually puts the superior power of the PC to work with better Al and graphics. The surprise is that the PC controls are better than the console versions. BAV ohn Wooden was not merely the best basketball coach ever, he was perhaps the best coach in any sport: amateur or professional. He was also a three time All-American as a player. What most people don't know about the \"Wizard of Westwood\" was that despite his success at basketball, Wooden's favorite sport was actually baseball. He loved the grace, the timelessness, the unhurried nature of the most strategic of American team sports. Wooden did admit, however, that basketball was probably the best sport for the average fan, as it fea. tured the fewest players on the field with the largest ball. Basketball was the easiest to follow-and there was a lot of scoring, which helped sell tickets. What John Wooden might think of computer basketball simulations is open to speculation. But I imagine that he might allow himself a wry smile at the grace and care with which NBA Live 96 is crafted; he'd probably frown and roll that famous program tightly in displeasure over COLLEGE SLAM; and he'd likely shake his head that stat-based sims are still around in the action-heavy hoops world of the '90s. SLAM DUNK The original NBA Live is one of the best sports games of all time, as significant to basketball as FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL was to the gridiron. It was the first action game that played like real basketball, instead of some alien arcade hybrid. It would have been easy for EA Sports to take the awards and get fat, as many modern athletes tend to do. Instead, NBA Live 96 builds on the success of the original and corrects many flaws, both in terms of action and simulation. Whereas in the original too much emphasis was placed on when you clicked the button, now the players' actual abilities seem to make a bit of a difference. Make no mistake-this is still an action-heavy game; but when you select Simulation mode, Ewing becomes the interior force for the Knicks that he should be. Similarly, Dennis Rodman's carrot-top hairdo flashes as he pulls down realistic numbers of rebounds. Penny Hardaway skies for elegant jumpers, and John Stockton defies Father Time with assist after record setting assist. The big surprise is that the stats are in the ballpark. NBA LIVE 96 isn't as realistic as a pure stat sim, but it far outshines any other action-oriented hoops game-includ. ing the original NBA LIVE. Trading is more robust, but it lacks the appeal of FRONT PAGE FOOTBALL Pro's career leagues. You can create custom players as well, but it would be really nice to see EA furnish hoops fans with some all-time great teams-maybe in NBA LIVE 97? Also, the injury ratings are far too forgiving-if these were right, Shaq wouldn't have missed more than 2-3 games, instead of the third of the season he fanned on in real life. These quibbles are minor, however, when you consider the vastly improved Al and the increased play.calling options. About the only limi tations on the design-you can even call plays on the fly now are the authentic NBA rules, which prohibit illegal defenses\" such as zones.

Aside from the rampant silliness, 1 can't stomach a college hoops game-even as a bad joke-that leaves powerhouses like two-time NCAA champ Louisville out of the lineup.

On one occasion playing with older rules, George Mikan of '54 Minneapolis outscored Shaquille O'Neal 35-24, as the modern player was baffled by Mikan's old-fashioned, but effective hook shot. The competition was so tough that no team came close to eclipsing Chicago's record of 72 wins. The NY Knicks of 1970 had the stingiest defense, while Larry Bird's '86 Celtics led the league in scoring. The biggest disappointment was the LA Lakers, who finished below .500, despite Kareem and Magic Johnson's excellent play. The biggest surprise was the '59 Celtics, where Bob Cousy stole the assist crown from John Stockton. The Celtics fell, however, to Jordan and the '93 Bulls, who faced the '72 Lakers in the final. Both teams were similar: aging superstars (Pippen and Jordan vs. Chamberlain and Jerry West); role-players (Dennis Rodman, Tony Kukoc): tough defense and accurate shooting. The series hinged on whether Jordan could get Wilt in foul trouble; otherwise, \"The Stilt\" did anything he wanted to the outmatched Bulls centers. Ironically, the plan worked to perfection in games three and four but when the Bulls had a chance to steal game five in overtime, their poor free-throw shooting betrayed them. Jerry West then scored 32 points to put game six, and the series, out of reach. The replay was a bit of a pain to set up, since I had to enter every game in my make-believe schedule. But statistics nuts (like me, obviously) can spend hours pouring over the results of games between their hoops heroes, which makes all the clunkiness worth it.

"SPORTS SPECTACULAR PUCK OFF 196 New Hockey Games Slice Up The Ice BY GORDON COBLE 10 ith the release of four new products in a 12 month span, this is a prolific time for com: puter hockey. It wouldn't be in virtually any other gaming category (can you say \"hover. craft racing?\"), but it is here. This foursome swells the current hockey line-up to an all-time high, with product running the gamut from ultragraphical to text-based, and from really good to pathetic. Is there one game out there that manages to faithfully recreate a true to life hockey environment? Let's hit the ice and survey the competition. ST. LOUIS FIGHT THE POWER Virgin's upcoming Windows 95 game, NHL POWERPLAY 96, should provide the most realistic hockey action ever on the PC. (Note that \"should\" is the operative word here, as final code wasn't available in time for this article.) POWERPLAY's strength lies in convincing us that there are real thinking hockey players on the ice. Will he go this way, that way or pass the puck? It depends on the situation and the player. Will penalty killers automatically ice the puck? No, that depends on just how hard he's being pressured. Are there any \"sure bet\" plays-little holes in the proFISCAL 0 18 t AHA 001803 NHLPA sical Bauer VIEVI DONGL EL ACT NHLPA KRYGT A gramming that allow you to be abnormally successful with one tactic? If there is, I've yet to discover it. It's this on-ice realism that game designers Radical Entertainment (also responsible for BRETT HULL HOCKEY, a game long on ideas but short on execution) are counting on. If the final release is free of the repetition and often nonsensical actions seen in other games (and sometimes evident in the POWERPLAY beta), that alone will make the game worthwhile for the serious computer hockey player. It will have to be, because POWERPLAY is missing a fair chunk of the graphic flair, managerial options and little extras to which we've become accustomed with games like Electronic Arts' NHL HOCKEY 96. For starters, POWERPLAY has just one panning, 70degree endzone camera angle, and players are too small for team logos and numbers on their jerseys. Games will run in VGA only-a definite step backward. GLIDING ACROSS THE ICE Not only does NHL POWERPLAY 96 look like hockey, it's the closest you'll come to feeling the puck on your stick without actually stepping onto the rink CG JULY 1996 "


"O Nami I 1 4:31 09 On the other hand, player animation is very strong, with slapshots that differ from wrist shots, and hooking that differs from poke check. ing. Strategists will be disappointed by the lack of player trades, but will fall in love with other coaching options, including man-to-man versus zone coverage, speedy versus cautious breakouts, and more, all changeable on the fly. And yes, coaching ploys do have a pronounced effect on the action. For hockey enthusiasts who prefer game realism over graphic flair, this could be a compelling product. ICE COLD WORLD Hockey is the Stanley Cup winner of our Worst Hockey Sim award, with blocky graphics and equally poor gameplay. ICE ICE BABY Just switching on EA's breakthrough NHL HOCKEY 96 is a rush. Great sound, 21st century menu screens, stats as far as the eye can see, and nearly hallucinatory graphics that include numbered and logo embellished jerseys and ice reflections make the game seem drop-dead awesome at first. In SVGA with detail options cranked, it'll run like a slug on anything but a Pentium 90 or above, but the visual show is almost worth it. NHL HOCKEY 96, though, isn't something that appreciates with time. That is its flaw. After the initial thrills and spills, exquisite periphery gives way to repetitive on-ice tactics, questionable Al and a sense that no matter what you do, the computer will decide the outcome. It's not all bad by any means, and the team concept and managerial options are actually very good, but you'll recognize the problem when you've blast ed your 20th point-blank shot of the period without a goal, finally resorting to the infamous \"one-timer\" from some ludicrous angle to finally score. Goaltenders that hold the puck forever even when you've skated clear of the offensive zone, power play units that become incredibly stupid, penalty killers that ice the puck for no good reason, icings that you can almost always beat-the the list goes on and on. It may be great for graphic hounds and those new to hockey, but NHL HOCKEY 96 is not the game for serious hockey aficionados. the game has some inspired touches, with a number of pre-game and pre-season options such as custom-constructed teams, trades and a practice mode. It also packs the best face-off and fighting sequences of any PC hockey game I've seen. But on the ice, everything switches to hyper-drive. It's a flurry of bodies and sticks as teams mill about in complete disarray. Curious \"ughs, \" \"oofs\" and other wails of pain buffet the audio landscape, and the whole thing begins to resemble a horizontal scrolling death match in no short order. Too bad. WAYNE'S WORLD Not to be confused with Bethesda's WAYNE GRETZKY Series from the early '90s (which, in retrospect, featured several innovations and was actually a satisfactory game), Time-Warner Interactive's WAYNE GRETZKY AND THE NHLPA ALL STARS isn't nearly of the same caliber. Unlike it's real-life namesake, GRETZKY is a strong starter but lacks finish. DEMERIT Surely Merit Studio's WORLD HOCKEY 95 is someone's twisted joke, made even worse by wrapping it in packaging that mimicks EA's infinitely more sophisticated NHL Hockey 95. Heck, there's even a quote right there on the box, favorably comparing the two. Indeed, there are comparisons to be made, but in every single case, Merit's game comes up short-and I mean road-kill short. No doubt the shoddiest hockey game in recent memory, WORLD HOCKEY starts with an ugly interface; continues with incorrect rule interpretation and a baffling viewing perspective, and ends with confusing gameplay that bears no resemblance to any game of hockey ever played. LINE 32 TEXT FOR TEXT'S SAKE Despite the proliferation of graphic-based games, there will always be room in the marketplace for textbased sports software, which statistic and fantasy lovers play out \"what if\" situations and generally compile loads of facts and figures. Of the few producers of hockey text games, Lance Haffner is the most active, having just released a new version of HAT TRICK complete with 1996 teams and, as usual, selected \"great\" teams from 1960 to 1992. Otherwise, this little program hasn't changed much over the last few years, still with the same puzzling manual and without any graphical touches. But it does allow more coaching and playing options when manually con testing a game than does its competition, APBA PRO HOCKEY, so if text-based hockey is your thing, this is the one I recommend BRAND NEW KEY If you're itching for a shiny new pair of virtual roller skates, NHL HOCKEY 96 by EA Sports has your graphic ticket-but is short on long-term gameplay.

Accessible by players of every imaginable skill level, it's small wonder golf sims are so popu. lar. Thanks to advances in technology and continually evolving design innovations, this time. honored genre has never looked or played better. Currently, the PC leaderboard features four major players. Access Software's LINKS series-LINKS 386, LINKS 386 CD and Links PRO CD-is the undisputed software champ, though it's showing signs of old age. Next is Microsoft Golf 2.0, which is essentially LINKS licensed for Windows, containing most of the features from the DOS original. Electronic Arts' PGA TOUR 96 is a sensational first effort noted for its smooth interface and engaging play variations. Finally, the Shark's back in GREG NORMAN ULTIMATE CHALLENGE GOLF from Grolier Interactive Designed for Windows, it features educational value that should appeal to both novice and veteran golfers.Gamers should also look for Maxis SIM GOLF (see sidebar) and Headgate's THE GOLF CLUB (#140, p. 37) in the near future. What should sim golfers look for when making their first foray onto the digital fairway? Many factors contribute to a game's overall success, but the five major considerations are: graphics, player interface, realism, course add-ons and options. bunkers, water hazards and peripheral touches such as clouds, cart paths and static backgrounds, are then added to create a realistic envi The tough part in any golf game, though, is blending computer-rendered fairways with digitized objects (trees, bushes and rocks) and making it look natural. LINKS, MS-GOLF and PGA TOUR 96 all do an excellent job blending disparate graphic elements into a smooth, cohesive whole. Only Norman fails to consistently achieve this balance. Its parts and pieces sometimes don't match up, as if rendered with different degrees of focus, lighting and contrast. The resulting cut-and-paste quality is quite noticeable, but mitigated somewhat by the rich 16-bit HiColor palette. But NORMAN does let you play a fully functional game from an overhead perspective, with amazingly detailed topographic renderings. Each game here also offers video fly-bys of each hole. PGA TOUR 96's fly-bys feature excellent voice-over advice, providing detailed hints, tips and caveats. Fly-bys in NORMAN are also good, narrated by Norman himself. Both Links and MS-GOLF feature fairly generic fly-bys, augmented with tips from the pros. LINKS PRO CD has tiresome comic commentary by Bobcat Goldthwait, something most players can do without. PICTURE PERFECT Thanks to LINKS' pioneering efforts in digitized course graphics, pho torealism is the buzz word for most new golf sims. Typically, fairways and greens are created by mapping grassy textures onto a contour grid, modeled after the terrain features of the actual location. Trees, foliage, Maxis' SimGolf You might think a links sim from Maxis, the SIMCITY folks, would be more along the lines of miniature golf. Close, but not quite. On the horizon is SIMGOLF for Windows 95, featuring a built-in course construction kit, multiplayer support (network, modem and Internet). and on-line tutorials from designer Robert Trent Jones. Another promising innovation is the Maxis MouseSwing interface, which uses mouse movement to recreate backswing and ball strikes. A cure for the dreaded swing meter? Let's hope so. The game will come with three pre-designed 18-hole courses Players will then have the ability to modify these existing courses or design new links from scratch, then share them with fellow SIMGOLF enthusiasts. This is the first course designer since Accolade's highly Successful JACK NICKLAUS series, and looks like it will add considerable replay value to Maxis' golfing title. SWINGING THE CLUB In real golf, a solid hit is the combination of many things: hip and shoulder movement, backswing and follow-through. In computer golf, however, it all boils down to one twitchy finger. Although most games let you adjust variables such as stance, aim, height and spin, your final success or failure is measured by your ability to use the dreaded swing meter. Whether circular (LINKS, MS-GOLF, PGA TOUR 96) or straight (NORMAN), swing meters all work the same: click once to put the meter bar in motion, again to set your power, and again to make contact with the ball. Click too soon on the downswing and you'll hook or draw to the left: click too late and you'll produce a slice or fade. Both PGA TOUR 96 and NORMAN have intuitive swing meters which automatically display the optimum power and impact marks on the color-calibrated gauge. These well-designed meters remove much of the frustration from putting. LINKS and MS-GOLF use uncalibrated swing meters, making it extremely difficult to accurately gauge strokes. All games here utilize an adjustable \"stick\" to aim the ball and CG JULY 1996 "

PGA TOUR 96 takes this one step further, however, with its ingenious Targeting Arc System, which lets you view the proposed ball trajectory prior to your shot. Besides an intuitive swing meter, a good interface also needs acces sibility of options and customizable screen sizes. LINKS boasts more than 340 different combinations of screen layouts, while PGA TOUR 96 offers similar details, including a better assortment of interactive viewing angles. NORMAN has the best interface, with large buttons on the bottom of the screen and more options available via pull-down menus at the top. STORMIN' NORMAN GREG NORMAN GOLF has the best interface, with a large screen, an array of buttons at the bottom and pull-down menus at the top of the screen. A TRUE GOLF SIMULATOR Although all of the golf sims presented here take a serious approach to the sport, some are more detailed than others. NORMAN definitely wins this round, offering an amazing variety of playing conditions, each contributing subtle impacts on gameplay, including wind speed, tem. perature, ground conditions, and even ball construction. NORMAN is also the only game with pure simulation play-as opposed to twitchy-finger arcade mode--based on more than 40 user-defined golfer characteris tics. The rest of the pack only offers computer-controlled simulated play ers. In this regard, PGA TOUR 96 offers the best leaderboard, featuring 14 real PGA Tour pros, including Craig Stadler, Tom Kite and Fuzzy Zoeller, each programmed with true life characteristics and video cap. tured swings. TOUR 96 leads the pack with the best assortment of game modes, including stroke, practice, tournament, sudden death playoffs, Skins Game, and Shoot-out. MS-GOLF offers Skins scoring, but the other titles only allow adjustment of player skill levels, with no variations beyond basic stroke play. Only LINKS and MS-GOLF allow you to print scorecards. One of the best options I've seen is the interactive lesson found in NORMAN. Called the Lesson Tee, this ingenious feature sets players up with nine different golfing challenges, describes potential problems and solutions, lets you adjust your stroke accordingly, and then evaluates your performance MORE OPTIONS Though all golf games come down to whacking around a little white ball, designers can distinguish their games by including options. The Macintosh version of LINKS PRO CD, for example, features voice recognition, allowing you to select clubs and shot types with voice commands. Links and MS-GOLF 2.0 also offer the ability to record golf sessions, which others can load up and compete against. Both games are the only ones in this roundup to offer network and modem play. A solid variety of game modes also breathes life into a golf sim. PGA HOLE 3PAR 34 ADDING A FEW COURSES Sometimes, playing the same 18 holes, over and over again, can be a little too repetitive. If variety is the spice that flavors your game, look no further than Access' LINKS CHAMPIONSHIP COURSE series, the mother lode of diverse golfing challenges. Here's the lineup so far: BANFF SPRINGS, THE BELFRY, BIGHORN, BOUNTIFUL, CASTLE PINES, COGHILL, DEVIL'S ISLAND, FIRESTONE, INNISBROOK, MAUNA KEA, PEBBLE BEACH, PELICAN HILL, PINEHURST, PRAIRIE DUNES, RIVIERA, and Troon NORTH. The beauty of the Access add-ons is their compatibility with LINKS 386, LINKS 386 CD, LINKS 386 PRO CD, and Microsoft GOLF FOR WINDOWS (version 1.0 or later). LINKS 386 CD even allows you to convert the original, low-res LINKS courses for use with the newer graphics engine. All the other golf sims come up short in the add-on category. PGA TOUR 96 comes with two courses, Spyglass Hill and TPC at Avenel. EA recently added SPANISH BAY -Scottish-style links on the Monterey coast-hopefully with more courses in the works. Time will tell if Grolier's NORMAN establishes a strong enough foothold to justify additional courses. The title ships with two courses, Medalist Golf Club, co-designed by Norman and Pete Dye, and the fictional Dorset Cliffs. The availability of add-on disks is a chicken-and-egg dilemma. If a golf sim founders on the market, additional courses are a wasted expense. However, the promise of additional courses can be a huge selling point.

"LOYD CASE  TECHNOLOGY Joystick Or toc No Joy? res What To Do When Old Glory Just Won't Perform Won't Perform ac onsider the lowly joystick (all right, if you've dropped S150 on a Thrustmaster FLCS, maybe it's not so lowly). Joystick problems faster and much bigger, graphics have radically improved , stereo sound comes out of the PC.CPU's are tremendously faster and mice have made our lives somewhat casier. Yet the joystick port is essentially the same as it was nearly 15 years ago. Let's take a look at this arcane and anachronistic piece of technology. The first point is that the joystick adapter does not generate an interrupt. If you recall the time you set up your sound Carl, you had to specify an interrupt (usually IRO5 for Sound Blaster compatibles). An interrupt is simply a way for a particular device (a sound card, for example) to tap the CPU on the shoulder and gel ils attention. Joysticks don't generate interrupts. Instead, joysticks have a common 1/O address (usual acelress 201). Think of this address as a mailbox. The game port puts information into the mailbox and the computer picks it up. But what information actually gets put in? The most obvious answer is the posiheadache in games today, after sound card and graphics configurations. Yet, it's clifficult to find useful information on how to make joysticks work. Let's take a close look at the game port on your PC, check out its operation and give some suggestions on how to fix a few of the problems you might have. The game port on your PC is essential ly the same design as the one that shipped with the original IBM PC way back in 1982. Since then, hard disks have gotten tion of the joystick along one axis or the other. The most straightforward way to do this is through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), that would translate the analog position of the joystick to a digital signal. Unfortunately, back when the PC was invented ADCs were expensive, so they resorted to a chcaper solution. In the joystick ilself are several potentiometers. These are simply variable position resisfors, much like a knob that might set the speed on a fan or the heat level of an electric stove. Most joysticks have two potentiometers (called «pots\" for short), one for cach axis. Get a good joystick, a dedicated game card and be prepared to re-calibrate early and often. LAB NOTES SHWA MUN Software Labs has just shipped Power 2 Play 2.0 (P2P), which lets you run your DOS titles directly from Windows 3.1 or Windows 95, rather than having to reboot. P2P also ships with a CD-ROM with shareware versions of perenTERMS nial favorites like Doom, HERETIC, RETURN OF THE TRIAD, and about 60 others, though the CD currently lacks many newer titles. P2P ran QUAKE from Windows 95 without a reboot, and with almost no drop in frame rate, even at higher screen sizes. Trying to run several other newer DOS titles-FLIGHT UNLIMITED, EF2000, and DUKE NUKEM 3D-through P2P crashed the system, and we had to hard reboot. P2P will scan your harddrive(s) for installed games, and add them to its list of installed games, which you can then assign to five hot buttons, where one click launches the game. Power 2 Play does offer convenience for those who have grown weary of the C:1 prompt, and doesn't appear to slow graphically-intensive titles, which is impressive. But it won't run all titles straight away, and you'll still need to massage more cantankerous titles manually. Its Ul is fairly straightforward, though obviously designed for Windows 3.1, lacking Windows 95's right-mouse-click Properties-type features. A more Win95friendly UI is in the works. At $34.95, it will mean less clicks to run your DOS titles, but is more of a nicely than a necessity. HOTTEST Power Play JULY 1996 99 "


"LOYD CASE TECHNOLOGY In the game card is a timer circuit that outputs a signal whose time duration varies, depending upon the position of the joystick. The game must continually poll the I/O address of the game card to get the duration of the signal, and hence the position of the joystick. Let me repeat: the game sofhvare must continually poll the I/O address to get accurate information on the jovstick position, meaning that valuable CPU cycles are being burned to read information on your joysticks position. In fact, as much as 15 percent of your computer's CPU may be eaten up polling the joystick more than a few joystick ports in sound cards, undergo a phenomenon called thermal drift. As the computer warms up, the joystick signals durations actually change, and this deviation is the main source of joystick drift. With really cheap ganic cards, you constantly have to re-calibrate your joystick. Of course, modern Pentium systems with lots of memory and sophisticated graphics cards generate even more heat, causing more therinal drift and... well, you get the picture Another source of difficulty are cheap joysticks, whose pots and springs tend to get thrown out of whack after relatively limilcd use. Okay, so you've cropped over a hundred bucks on a premium joystick with a gazillion buttons... or maybe only four buttons, such as the CH Flightstick Pro or THRUSTMASTER FCS. You pick up a game that ostensibly supports one of these advanced controllers, only to find that you have a very expensive, two-button joy stick-the other buttons, cool add-ons and IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE HEAT... There's another rub. The duration of the joystick position signal changes when the speed of the computer changes. This is what the infamous joystick calibration routines are actually doing: calibrating the game card and joystick to the speed of the computer. But wait, it gets worse. Most cheap game cards, and TIPS! Logitech Wing Man WarriorLogitech seems to have scored a direct hit with id's John Romero, who endorsed the new Warrior as the ideal controller for Doom. The Warrior is the latest addition to Logitech's family of joysticks which include the Wing Man and Wing Man Extreme What makes the Warrior different is what Logitech has dubbed the Spin Control, a horizon tal knob located to the left of the joystick Using the SpinControl players can make faster turns and quickly spin a full 360°, a much-needed capability for surviving fragfests. There are plans to map QUAKE's \"free look\" feature into Warrior's repertoire of maneuvers, but these won't be complete until Quake ships. The Warrior connects to a serial port, so if you've got a mouse in your first serial port and a modem in your second, you'll need to unplug one of them to use the SpinControl.

Dave Salvator \"Green PCs\" If you have an energy-efficient PC that automatically powers down when not in use. you might deactivate the green features while playing joystickenabled games. Since joystick calibration is dependent on the speed of the CPU, the joystick will go completely out of whack when the system shuts down, and will not return to exactly the same calibration when your computer comes alive again. This is particularly true if you have one of those speed-compensated game cards. throttle wheels don't seem to work. It's likely that you have an older, multifunction 1/O card that only supports a single joystick. Reconnect your joystick to either a sound card or a dedicated joystick card. Then there are the speed-compensated game cards. Thrustmaster, CIT Products and Advanced Gravis all offer cards that ostensibly compensate for the speed of the CPU. W at they really do is adjust the duration of the joystick signal and have been a boon for some older software whose joystick routines have trouble running on very fast computers. The real benefit of these cards is the use of higher quality components, which minimizes thermal drift. Another culprit of joystick problems is poor game design (surprise, surprise). For example, some calibration routines ask you to press a button when the joystick is in the upper-left or lower-right position. Then they read the values and assume they're correct. But what if you haven't quite gotten the stick jamuned against the corner when you press a button? 'The result is instant joystick drift. Some games assume that computers will never get faster. They use smallish numbers (say, 8bit integers) to count the joystick pulses. When the user doubles or triples the computer speed (let's say they move from a 486/33 to a Pentium 100), suddenly the joystick doesn't work right. There have been a number of game patches issued for older games to solve this problem. Are joystick problems going to be with us forever? The art of programming the game port is arcane and not well understood, even among many game developers. As games move to Windows 95, game developers will begin using standard ways of accessing the game port. The Windows 95 Games Software Development Kit will even have a set of tools called DirectInput that lets manufacturers of sophisticated controllers acel cirivers to Windows 95 that allow any DirectInput-enabled game to use their controllers. For today, however, we still have to live within the limits of the old IBM game port technology. The best solution today is to get a good joystick, a dedicated game card and be prepared to re-calibrate early and often. Logitech Wing Man Warrior CG JULY 1996 "

Even in QUAKE-whose default frame size is 320x200--the Mach V delivered 30 frames per second running QUAKES UniVBEassisted VESA vid_mode 20 (512x384) display mode. In Windows 95. DirectDraw-based MECH WARRIOR 2 also ran smoothly. The Mach V's WinBench numbers were also very good overall. Compared to the Zephyr Onyx 166 MHz system we reviewed in April, the Mach Vs CPU per formance was about nine percent faster overall for 16-bit and 32-bil code, and disk performance was much better, coming in about 66 percent faster than the Onyx. The two machines had comparable graphiics performance, and the only place the Mach V didn't quite deliver was in its 8x CD-ROM's performance, which came in about 25 percent slower overall than the Onyx. Also, its CPU usage during CDROM file I/O, at 54 percent, was 12 percent higher than the Onyx. But looking at scquential read performance-the kind of file I/O games usually use when loading a new scene or level-the Mach V consistently delivered 8x (1.2 MB/sec) throughput. To address the spotly CD-ROM performance, Falcon plans to use Toshiba's Ox CD-ROM drive, which they say will delivcr better overall performance, as well as solid sequential read throughput. The Mach Vs CH joystick/throttle system made for smooth navigation through all the flight sims we ran, and the units are casily re-calibrated using CH's utilities, The Pro Throttle software comes with config files for many flight sim titles, and also action titles like DUKE NUKEM, and QUAKE. Aconvenient aspect of the Mach V series is that Falcon will build to order. If, for example, you want to swap out fancy spcakers and the MIDI daughterboard for more RAM, they'll do it. And while the rig we reviewed has all the bells and whistles, Falcon can build a \"base\" Mach V system for about $3,500. The 166 MHz Mach V continues Falcon's uncompromising commitment to making screaming game rigs, but be prepared to pony up. At $4,888 as reviewed, the Machi V is not for the faint of cash. But if you've got the bucks, they've got the goods. Maybe it's time to finally take a hammer to ye olle piggy banke... First, the laundry list o' bundled good ies: 16 MB of EDO RAM, 256 KB synchronous burst 1.2 cache, a 21 CB EIDE hard-drive, an STB graphics board based on S3's Trio64V with 2MB of EDO DRAM, Sound Blaster 16 with a Roland SCD-10 General MIDI daughterboard, Princeton Graphics Ultra 17 monitor. Acoustic Research 622 speakers (satellite/sub-woofer), and Microsoft Natural keyboard. There's also a CH highspeed game card, F-16 CombatStick, and Pro Throttle. The rig ships with Windows 95 pre-installed, and out of the box, it's good to go.

For any given frame of gameplay, that means focusing the engine's attention on just the immediate parts of the world. \"There's two stages,\" Carmack says. \"The determining what's visible and then the actual drawing of the pixels.\" That's where a BSP tree comes in. A BSP tree is a software tool to order all of the sectors of a virtual world (think of a sector as an area of floor, a column, etc.). QUAKE uses a number of BSP trees. \"Tivo are used for the game world, to help determine line of sight and to allow the player to traverse the world. In addition, each movable object has its own BSP tree (objects like ammo boxes, but not animatcd beasties) \"It's esoteric, techmical stuff,\" Carmack admits. «A lot of people said that we couldn't use BSPs for a general 3D engine, but we think they're wrong.\" In Doom, a single BSP tree was the key to drawing each and every frame, but things get far more complicated when you toss in the third dimension. How do you cull out the unneeded sectors during gameplay? With levels averaging around 10,000 sectors, having to consider extra sectors becomes very inefficient, even with the help of a BSP tree.

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA TECHNOLOGY and then during one slow, cathartic weekend, he solved it. Using the world BSP data, Carmack devised a routine that pre-calculated the Potentially Visible Set (PVS) of sectors. To calculate a PVS, imagine standing in a spot at the center of a room. Now just fig. ure out what sectors are visible from any viewing angle. l'or a closed room, this isn't too hard, since the floor might just be a single sector, and a wall another sector, and so on. The PC only gets into complicated calculations when you run across a portal (a doonvay, for example), which is a nonpolygon, and it is the only way to see out into other areas. Through portals, you simply calculate what sectors might be visible until your line of sight runs out. This PVS information is calculated for cach sector in a level. \"You only really have to do this (pre-calculating once for a level,\" said Abrash, or once each time you really want to see it perfectly.

Clip just exactly what you need and no more. The monkey puzzle is mainly trial and error there are no guides to the proper lever settings, aside from the reaction of the monkey itself. Pain is not what you want here. ROUGH CUTS Act III-\"This one starts with a couple of automated sequences, first with Jake being roughed up by Magnotta, and then saving Wofford's life from a mysterious assassin. (The Ripper? Maybe, maybe not.) The real start is in the police station, where a call comes in from Nelson. It's a good thing to follow up on. 'The book puzzle is tricky. I'll just say there's a certain relationship between the letter and the book titles. Take it line by line and you'll solve it. At the Wofford well, you learn about the three parts of the weapon to use against the Ripper. You can pick them up any time you like there's no rush. Tivo of the wells have hostile ICE. While they look different, both are vulnerable in the same place: the glowing gems on their heads. Aim for those. The third well has the most hated puzz le of RIPPER: a chess-like strategy game against the computer, and you don't know the rules. In brief, it goes this way: Pawns move one square in any direction. After the first capture, a Pawni changes to a Super-Pawn that can capture any piece on the board. Knights cannot move unless they can take a piece exactly two squares away. After a capturc, or after all your pawns are taken, Knights change to \"real\" Knights, that can move one or two squares any direction, any time it's your move. Kings can only move one square at a time, horizontally or vertically, and only along the back two rows of the board. I checrfully admit to playing this one in \"easy puzzle» mode and you may want to do the same.

"SCORPIA CTIPSI ADVENTURE/RPG Stonekeep-For those who haven't started this game, or haven't gone too far with it yet, there's a terrific easter egg, right at the beginning. When you're standing at the lever to open the door, pull it three times in a row. Turn around, step into the hall, and go around the corner left. About three or four walls down on the left side, is a panel. Pulling the switch there opens a secret passage behind you. In the passage, on a left wall as you enter, is another panel. Behind that is a very powerful dagger, that will make most of the early (and even not-so-early) combats much easier. Note, however, that this weapon is available only if you have not yet gone down the stairs! Once you've entered Stonekeep proper, the dagger is lost to you (my thanks to Roe Adams). Dark Seed 2-Those who have managed to get into the back room of the Morgue (cheery place) are having a bit of difficulty in obtaining the key from around the corpse's neck. This is an instance (one of many in the game) where conversations with the right people can help a lot. The carnival is the place for the answer here-especially for seeing double and looking into the future. When you've taken care of that, getting the key won't be a puzzle.-Scorpia But there's more to do than play games with ICE. Have a chat with Catherine, for instance. That puts you on to George Rhodes and a safe deposit box. What's the combination? Heh, I'm sure you can think of something related to Rhodes for that one. The Berman well puzzle is something like Concentration, only here you have to uncover the same three bar code numbers in only three moves. Watch how the pieces move when the puzzle resets, then get all the numbers on the board. Keep track of them, and you should make it through here pretty quickly Now is a good time to visit Soap Beatty for a couple of reasons, not the least of which is a little protection from the Ripper. He sends you on to Cain, who points you to a pair of wells. The ICE on one is an irrilating jumping puzzle (I did this in easy mode, too). Head left up the left side, then work your way gradually to the right and up where the machine is hovering. Do not waste time here; keep moving The other well has a puzzle with an Egyptian motif. The vulture is the beginning, eh? The beginning of what? It looks hard, but really, it's as casy as ABC (even so, you still have a lot of work to do before you obtain the answer). Anyway, enough of cyberspace for now; matters in the real world demand your attention, too. Magnotta's apartment, for instance. Check the left side of the door as well as the right. You'll also want to talk to Ilaman (in three of four scenarios, this is quite important for determining the Ripper, along with a couple other things). If you haven't tumed him up yet, think: who'd know about crooks?

None of the hundreds of witnesses to Dubanski's death heard a shot, so I start my investigation by loading up a database of stealth weapons. On the video of the assassination, however, there is a definite rifle-like report, which will throw many people off. But this bang is evidently a bug in the game. Ignore it.) Close examination of the video taken after the assassination reveals a peculiar pattern of bullet holes. At first I thought this was a typical game blooper, no single shot projectile would leave a pattern like that. A quick search through a CIA database of stealth weapons, however, revealed a secret (fictional?) weapon that just might leave such a pattern. And it's a silent weapon, to boot. Aha! That wasn't a blooper, that was a clue! Next, I pulled up the Kennedy Assassination Toolkit, which combines a 3D computer model of a scene with the video. Careful inspection of the video revealed bullet holes in two locations.

First, you must read all the text-and there's a lot of il-yourself, rather than hearing it read aloud, and you can't change the texts typeface or size. Worse, on one of my machines, the text was improperly aligned, so that sentences ran off the right side of the window. You must always start the game from CD #1, saving your game is a minor pain, and Activision's funky sound drivers play far too softly. Still, there's nothing here that should keep you away.

"REVIEW  PSYCHIC DETECTIVE ADVENTURE/RPG thing wrong with PSYCHIC DETECTIVE, it would be that gameplay is too short; a full game takes less than an hour. But since there are so many endings, the replay value is amazingly high. Nevertheless, many players will exhaust the entertainment potential of the game after 20 hours are up, and as adventure games go, that's not long at all. Still, the 20 hours I played it were the most rewarding time that I've spent with a game in months. on the chance to hop into someone's head, follow them in your car, save a life or read an object, you will lose your opportunity Events are transpiring in real-time; at least two or three things are always happening at once, usually in separate PSYCHEDELIC SENSATIONS The \"interactive movie\" taa is rooms or even opposite actually applicable in PSYCHIC DETECTIVE, due to the often ends of town, and Eric bizarre cinematic flow of the adventure, can't be everywhere at once.

While each game sports some intriguing features, neither is entirely satisfying-though for very different reasons. Indeed, they seem like opposile sicles of the same coin. all it the forgollen war.

One of its finer expressions surfaced in 1993, when Core Design's sumptuous helicopter shoot-em-up. THUNDERSTRIKE, appeared on Sega CD. Core has since taken that technology to the next level, and two offshoots have found their way to PC CD-ROM: JVC's AH3 THUNDERSTRIKE: AIR ASSAULT (THUNDERSTRIKE 2 on the 32-bit conKILLER BLADES of the two, AH3 THUNDERSTRIKE comes much closer to pure shooting satisfaction.

INSIDE ACTION Bungie, the company behind MARATHON and MARATHON 2, is now creating original content for the PC. After they port over MARATHON 2, their PC development team will dive full-bore into creating a game that combines the genres of fighting games and Doom-style 3D shooting, with a few platformer concepts as well, to create a truly genre-busting game. It hasn't been named yet, but from what we've heard, it has us chomping at the bit. Imagine throwing Akira from VIRTUA FIGHTER into a level from Doom. Add in the ability to fully interact with the environment, by picking up objects and scaling walls, and you have a game that transcends fighting and Doom-style games. The game will be entirely 3D, and the worlds, of which there will be eight, will be rendered solely with polygons. Up to six players will be supported, since Bungie is designing it specifically as a multiplayer game. Although the level setup is like Doom, this isn't a first-person perspective game, since the dynamic camera will float and pan around the character, even more so than in BATTLE ARENA TOSHINDEN. Imagine throwing an uppercut at an enemy (a la MORTAL KOMBAT), and then watching as the camera flies up from underneath your legs, following the path of your fist and flying with it straight up into the enemy's jaw. Expect this \"virtua DOOM\"-game to ship in late 1996. JULY 1996 CG "

And if it's for marketing reasons, well, it's a little obvious, but it can't hurt. While the computer-game market has expanded enormously, its penetration is still relatively low. To grow, it will have to find ways to speak to groups beyond the twentysomething middle-class white men on which it made its bones. It's just a shame SHELLSHOCK isn't belter.

"Video Pinball Just Got a Whole Lot More Fun! here are more pinball games than ever to choose from these days.

"REVIEW  DUKE NUKEM 3D ACTION which you'll call on throughout the game. The items you'll find and load into the belt are essential to winning. The jetpack allows you to reach otherwise inaccessible high places. Night vision goggles will display enemy silhouettes in utter darkness, and sometimes, reveal hints inscribed on walls. Boots delay the toxic effects of muck underfoot, and scuba gear allows you to breathe underwater. If you can't use it, or open it, or otherwise interact with it, there's a chance you can just blow it up. Mirrors shatter to expose their plywood backing, \"Toilets collapse in fragments, unleashing mini geysers of blue water. Bunks disintegrate. And certain walls can be destroyed to reveal new paths, hidden regions and shortcuts Duke's Hollywood Adventure UKE NUKEM 3D is a regular cornucopia of references to movies, other computer games and recent history. Here's a sample of what awaits popular-culture vultures, and tips on where to find them. Doom In a secret area behind the prison chapel in E1L3, you'll find a familiar-looking corpse clutching its bloody throat. Duke's comment: \"Hmmm. That's one Doomed space marine.\" ing. \"Innocent?\" after you drop down the shaft from the starting point. You'll find Duke's answer to that question in E3L7. A large \"GUILTY!\" sign (with the exclamation point painted in blood) can be found in a crate-filled room on your right once you clear this level's first key-card door. And check out the TV at the far end of the bar in E1L2 for a chopper-eye view of the white Bronco and the \"low-speed chase.\" Supplies it, and you'll teleport into a hidden enclosure. Here you'll find the entrance to a secret level (\"Freeway\") and, at the enclosure's farthest reaches, a familiar figure hanging impaled on the wall. \"We meet again, Dr. Jones,\" says Duke. 100 49 KERLTRAMONASTAV 2001: A Space Odyssey Beyond the forcefield off the arena in E2L8, you'll find a scarred rock wall. Destroy it, and follow the corridor it concealed, and you start to hear a familiar chorus and, eventually, find a familiar black, rectangular shape. Star Trek: The Next Generation The layout of the spaceship you explore in E2L3 should look familiar. A rough replica of the bridge of the starship Enterprise-complete with Ready Room (and a few non-regulation surprises)-can be found above the main body of the ship. After you use the conveyor belt to reach the circular forward area, open the lighted panel to the right and shoot the button high on its left wall. This opens a secret door on the left side of the room's central hub that will lead you to the turbo-lift. \"Hmmm!\" says Duke. \"Looks like I have the con.\" O.J.

Within, you'll find young master Luke strung up by his feet, a Shrinker in place of his light saber. \"Now, this is a force to be reckoned with,\" says Duke. Quake Once you emerge from the tunnels at the start of E3L4, you'll find yourself facing a black office building with a triangular sign designating it a \"Quake site.\" This is a replica of the Texas HQ of id Software.

"REVIEW DUKE NUKEM 3D ACTION to previously explored arcas. The levels in DUKE are a solid move in the direction of the mutable environment one in which only the player is a given. Of course, if you want more flexible levels, you can always build your own with the Build editor that is included on the CD, along with a range of utilities (including a DOOM-to-Build converter) and 40. odd pages of documentation. Also on the CD are the complete versions of the original DUKE NUKUM and Duke Nukem II, a raft of Apogee demos and screens for Duke follow-ups SHADOW WARRIOR and BLOOD and 3D Realms' next-generation game, the QUAKE-like PREY. NOT QUITE 3D And yet, for all that, it is not perfect. Duke's 3D is not true 3D, as will be immediately apparent from its textured 2D map mode. It's an cffective simulation of 3D, with bridges, overpasses and ramps, but lacks the visceral appeal of a FUTURE SHOCK While the opening and closing episodes are consistently inspired, the middle space episode seems comparative lytame in layout, depth and challenge. (What happened to the notion of being blown out into space by blowing up the wrong wall?) Technically, DUKE's very clean. However, the rich explosions sometimes appear in front of some background objects but behind others--and in later levels l occasionally found graphical garbage tracking Duke's passage. Moreover, in certain respects, DUKE is too close to Doom. The episode-ending confrontations with giant bosses are all set in arena-style levels. Indeed, the final one is in a real arena-a football stadium, complete with cheerleaders and goal posts. There has to be another way to do this: the boss could pursue Duke into a section of city built almost entirely of destroy-able walls. Duke's task would be to avoid his enemy and the detonations around him and search for the one building that the boss can't destroy. This ending would have been more consistent with the interactivity of the previous levels of DUKE. And last, but not least, DUKE is bound to elicit criticism that it demcans women. The original shareware version set off a small firestorm online when the reference \"killbitch\" was found embedded in the 0098 56 CHILL OUT The Freezethrower, which turns enemies to ice, isn't the only unique weapon in Duke, but it is the coolest.

"DUKE NUKEM 3D  REVIEW ACTION code. They won't have to look that far this time. Women here are represented as exotic dancers, cheerleaders and naked alicn captives. And lest you think Duke should somehow be excused because of his ostensible role as rescuer and Earth savior, well, think again. Encountering a bikini-clad dancer, his contribution to her is: \"Shake it, baby.\" When he takes the mike at a liberated radio station, his spiel TESTfor KITT is playing the breast..uh, the best times in town.\" One other note on DUKE is its multiplayer mode. It is incredibly fun blasting your friends in a DUKEMATCH, but the levels in DUKE are much too large when playing with only a few people. You could end up spending more time looking for your friends and less time actually shooling them. The major problem with multiplay, though, is that you can't enter and exit the multiplayer matches at will. So if you wanted to exit DUKE and change your name, or if a newcomer wanted to join a game in progress, you'd have to wait till everyone else quit and start a new game. But, having said all that, DUKE is absolute fun. It's great deconstructing the alien aggressors into component eye. balls, teeth and limbs while listening to Duke's throaty bon mots. DUKE's environment isn't the most compelling 3D world I've seen, but it is the most fully realized: densely populated with things to WHAT'S IN THE EGG? The women in Duke are treated poorly, appearing in demeaning roles or as captives, like this woman in what looks like an Aliens-style egg. APPEAL: Duke is for those who want to play the next level of fast, visceral 3D action in an immersive world with attitude. PROS: The most interactive game of its genre; incredible graphics; cool weapons, levels and monsters, campy humor and a built-in scenario-editor. >CONS It's not true 3D, there are some graphic inconsistencies in later levels, and the overall treatment of women is demeaning. discover, things to interact with and things to blow to hell. Yeah, the juvenile humor gets thin after awhile, but it gives the game attitude and personality. There certainly is room for improvement in DUKE, but the environment is right and the gameplay is fun. So maybe next time, we'll get a game that aims a little higher. Until then, I'll be shattering some aliens with my boot and the trusty ol' Freezethrower. & RATED * Plant Trees for America Trees provide food, shelter, and nesting sites for songbirds.

"REVIEW  ABUSE  DIFFICULTY LEVEL P Abusive Side-Scroller Crack Dot Com's Baby Suffers A Few Deformities by Paul C. Schuytema enever I rum into a platform game, I always mentally compare it to my favorite Sega cart: CHOULS AND Cuosis. That game was one of the first Sega games, released in the late 80s. Yet, for playability and believability, ABUSE falls far short of the veneralevel. Honestly, I was pretty jazzed when first clowe into it. I was intrigued when my alter ego, Nick Vienna, began the game breathing heavily, bobbing up and down from exhaustion, I controlled his legs with the keyboard, but aimed by using the mouse. The dual controls were useful, since I could run one way and shoot behind me, or snipe straight up if I needed to. Off to a great start, I had high hopes for this retro game, Sally, those hopes crumbled the first time I encountered a rabid with cach step, one foot was planted in thin air and the other was in front of the platform. There's just no excuse for such visual sloppiness. The list of irritants goes on and on, from a large mining drill that pushes your character along, even though you're well above it, to switch puzzles created in such a way that there is no time to logically solve them--all you can do is stab at the keyboard and hope for the best. In fact, much of the design theory of this game comes from the \"you must die first\" school of thought, requiring you to sacrifice a life in order to get the needed information to advance. Sega OMINOUS SOUNDS On the up-side, there are a few cool things in ABUSE. The digital effects are wonderful and ominous. There are lots of nifty powerups and a slew of weapons to snatch up. And you can play with up to 8 other players in a network game. In net play, some of the weaknesses of the single-player game fall away, but going mano-a-mano in ABUSE falls far short of the first-person Deathmatch experience. If you like side-scrollers, you're better off custing off your old Genesis, because Crack Dot Com's ABUSE falls far short of even the status quo. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE ABUSE will appeal to side-scrolling junkies, but after the first rush you're not likely to get hooked.

The creature ran around so frantically that any hope at careful aiming was futile. More importantly, though. was that the creature's chaotic bchavior made it more of a thing to shoot\" than a threatening mulant. In short, the illusion of the game was broken many times, and I ceased to be \"in\" my alter ego anymore. The illusion further clisintegrated when I ran down a slope.

"REVIEW  BIG RED RACING NOTI)V to gameplay longevity, winning a race against computer competition becomes almost second nature. As mentioned earlier, racing against real people would improve things somewhat, but other arcade driving games such as WHIPLASH and SCREAMER also feature network play, and are infinitely better. Aside from the concept, this is one game that really can't be recommended to any age group A RED PLANET RIDE This Rhino gives a versatile ride, but it sure won't float in lava. locked vehicles will feel the wrath of water hazards and abrupt mountain faces, while boats will do their best to keep in the middle of their narrow fjords. On paper, this all sounds pretty good, but in practice it's tough to tell what's up, what's down and which way the dam course goes. Adding to your woes, the driving model is sloppy, unresponsive and frustrating, even in comparison to the weakest of arcade games, Banging bumpers is quite common, and if the confusing graphics don't throw you miles off course, progressive damage to your vehicle might do you in. Multiple viewing perspectives, courtesy of rotating cameras, hinder rather than assist. However, with a couple of trial runs on each course the whole thing gets pretty casy, and as a final blow APPEAL: The immature and immature-at-heart who hunger for a wild 'n' wacky driving game that's got very little to do with known physics. PROS: Good multiplayer game, lots of camera views, a variety of vehicles that includes high-performance dumptrucks and snowplows.

"TERRY COLEMAN CLASSICS & PUZZLES Blunt Instrument son No Puzzle POWER In The CROSSWORLD can remember when the Sunday edition of the New York Times intimi dated me. There was the newspaper's sheer size, the incredible range of critical thought in the Times Book Review-and then, there was that dastardly puzzle. Elitist, obluse, arrogant, yes; but it was a turning point for me when I finally conquered the abstruse construction, finally fulfilling its all-too-geometric horizontal/vertical layout to perfection. With the explosion of the gaming industry, it comes as no surprise that the granddacldly of all puzzles should go multimedia, along with that of its great competitor, the LA Times. But PUZZLE POWER by Centron Software Technologies captures little of the grandeur of the NY Times. The puzzles are far too easy: where are the adjectives like \"splendifcrous?\"; why does the accent of the announcer (as if you needed one) sound so michelle American, as he points out your hits and misses? (I would have been happy with a cabbie from the Bronx.) Why is it so boring visually? There is some variety in the six games enclosed. But you'll rarely need Roget's Thesaurus-it is included, by the way-whether solving the lame puzzles, or crcating code of your own in Cryptos. Quote Falls becomes an unfortunate pun, and Puzzle Master never lives up to its name. And while Kriss Kross might be educational, I'd rather listen to the brand-they're a lot more hip. These computer puzzles need an old-fashioned pencil sharpener. LO CHECK! CZ OKA U IS THAT REALLY A WORD? With Hasbro's upcoming Scrabble, you can create your own custom dictionary and confuse all your friends. The big news for players of classic parlor games is that Hasbro Interactive is working with Westwood Studios, among others, to produce new versions of their classic board games. BATTLESHIP, for example, will include a basic and advanced version (don't think about that one too much). Risk gets not merely a graphic facelift, but a new Al and more playing options than before. SCRABBLE will offer a \"marble\" board, stone and wood pieces, a tougher computer opponent, and a customizable dictionary. These games are getting the same royal treatment as MONOPOLY did, which means lots of flash, cool animation, and best of all, the promise of Internet play. Berkeley Systems continues to develop its You Don't KNOW JACK franchise, with version 2.0 scheduled for October. Promised features include improved graphics, even more zany questions, a \"High Score\" list, and the possibility of mystery celebrities. Also, You Don't KNOW JACK: SPORTS should make it in time for the Autumn playoffs. CAUGHT IN A CROSSWORLD If you approach a new medium in a lincar fashion, you pretty much lose the strength of both the original (paper) and the new computer). Camelek's experience in mediocre game show conversions to the computer, such as JEOPARDY, is well-employed here. A worse problem is the material: word searches are a lot like Tic-Tac-Toe, in that when you learn the secret pattem, play becomes mechanical and boring. Finding solutions in CROSSWORD is thus a lot like looking for a pixel in a haystack in a particularly irritating adventure game. In fairness, the production values of CROSSWORLD arc a lot better than PUZZLE POWER. In fact, if creating professional crosswords and word searches for JULY 1996 CC "

What's nifty about SMART GAMES is that you can customize the clifficulty level; there is no way to get stuck ifa puzzle is too hard for you, and no need to work through puzzles you find too easy. Many of the games test visual acuity, some vocabulary and some optimization skills.

"DENNIS MCCAULEY  SPORTS SPONSport Where Have You Gone, Dizzy Dean? The Play's The Thing-Not The Play-By-Play isn'any innovation in sports gaming. There just isn't enough of it. How do I know? Simple-announcers. Announct's the over-hyped age of multimedia, and we computer sports gamers lave offered ourselves up as will ing captives to the new era. And yet, don't many of today's games seem so full of sound and fury, often signifying nothing other than big bucks? Just what does the audio-visual gaming paradigm shift mean to the average sports-crazed player? Aside from the need for a computer that carries a 30-year mortgage, games today need to be bigger, brighter, faster, and louder-all in an effort to make you forget the last big hit title. Funny, though: for all their competitive zeal, most entertainment software publishers seem to be rapidly converging on the same ground zero, 'The result? Exery sports game that crosses my desk reminds me of-guess what that same last big hit title. Granted, sports games have built-in limitations based on the rules, history, and characters of the contests they model. Pour balls will always be a walk, and ten yards a first down. An NBA simulation has to have Michael Jordan taking it to the hoop, just as a pro football game suffers without the strong arm of Brett l'avre or Jerry Rice racking up yards after the catch. And where's a baseball sim without ken Griffey, Jr., Mickey Mantle, and the House That Ruth Built? By contrast, a role playing game or first person shooter can go just about anywhere the design team wants to take it. leaving infinitely more room to demonstrate creativity. Want to base your new DUKE NUKEM game on a futuristic sci-fi version of LA? Cool Sports game designers are a lot more restricted in their ers should add to the Big Show, not detract from it. IL VOICE-OVER, HOLD THE MUSTARD just about any sports title that wants to make a splash these days features a playby-play voice-over to spice things up. Now, this isn't a bad idea. It ties in with the sports nostalgia craze, and, if nothing clse, keeps old play-by-play men out of the soup kitchens. It's nice to see former Tigers announcer Emie Harwell immortalized in MILLER ASSOCIATES BASEBALL FOR WINDOWS BROADCAST BLAST, especially after his unexpected and graceless dumping by the Detroit club in 1991 after umpteen years behind the mike. But enough is enough. When I pick up a new sports software title, the first thing! do is scan the box to see what the designer thinks sets his game apart from the competition. If play-by-play announcers are a major part of the package, I'm immediately suspicious about the game's content. The announcer idea is done. guys. Stick a fork in it. It's getting too much like a Julia Child recipe: \"Take one sports simulation. Poll in a big-name announcer. I lalf bake, and spoon the whole thing onto a CD-ROM. Serves 50,000. Oh, that's very nice.\" Now, don't get me wrong. Having a ON DECK Our baseball scout has informed us that PRO LEAGUE BASEBALL 96 may not win a computer sports pennant this year. Problems in the corporate bullpen have left manager Dave Holt at odds with IBM management, to the point where the game has been \"severely delayed,\" and may not see action this year at all. While there's no \"official\" word from Sierra, don't expect Front Page Sports Basketball for at least another year-probably even later. The decision to revamp both FRONT PAGE SPORTS BASEBALL PRO (see the Baseball coverage in this month's big sports feature) and to re-design OUTPOST from the ground up (see Terry Coleman's strategy/war column last issue) left no programmers for three-pointers-hardly the backdoor play hoops fans were hoping for JULY 1996 CG "

But these products stand on their own merits: I'd extol them without the play-by-play men. In fact, I usually turn the announcers off, and I'd wager that many gamers do likewise after the first few test drives.

Cluose correctly and you'll win the game and get a new sneaker contract. Make the wrong call, and you'll end up as the assistant equipment man at Southwest Nowhere State. Come to think of it, with past seasons and classic stadium add-ons so popular these days, how about a Classic ANNOUNCER ALTERNATIVES Perhaps the game companies could learn a lesson from television. Back in 1980, NBC tried a bokl experiment in sports programming-the announcer-less game. It was a late season contest between the Jets and the Dolphins that had no bearing on the playoff hunt. A silent camera followed the action.picking up the crowd, the referees, and other ambient sounds that went along with a pro football game in New York's Shea Stadium, mainly jet planes and police sirens. TV graphics updated viewers to down-and-distance, the score, and game statistics. There was no play-by-play man, no color man, no announcer at all. A strange concept, to be sure, but guess what? The ratings exceeded all expectations, coming in with a share much higher than usual. There's a message in there somewhere, for both television and game company cxccutives, What will happen when software designers wake up, smell the toast burning, and realize that they've ridden the announcer horse about as far as it will go? What's even sillier is pandering to the sound gods in the audio wing of the multimedia temple. How about Virtual Sports Talk Radio? If your team falls beluind late in the game you'll be treated to voiceovers of the get-a-life crowd calling for your scalp on The Fabulous Sports Babe Show Or Virtual Troubled Plaver-can you motivate the big stiff for one more big game, and keep him from flunking his urine test or punching his wife?

Let's start with a digitally re-mastered v ersion of Howard Cosell's nasal cynicism, grating on gamers' cars even from the great beyondl; but telling it like it is, nonetheless. If it sells, we'll add Red Barber, Curt Cowcy, and all the other wonderful voices that once narrated the best days of our youth, but have sadly moved on to that great broadcast booth in the sky Finally, and not so far-fetched, expect to be using a headset before too long, coaching your team to victory through sports sims that utilize voice recognition software.

There's just two things, coach. Don't spit the tobacco juice on the rug, and remember, the play's the thing, not the play-by-play. What do you do when it's the bottom of the ninth, you're a run down with two outs and your worst hitter is standing at the plate? Well, normally, you lose. But in TONY LARUSSA BASEBALL 3: 1996 EDITION, you can turn any hitter into a superhuman batting machine. Just hold down the M. E, G, and A keys simultaneously while your team is at bat in the \"Play\" or \"Manage Only\" mode of the action/arcade part of the game.

"STRATEGY FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO 96 SPORTS Triple Threat Designing And Running The Triple Option Play In FPS FOOTBALL 96 by Paul Schuytema and Coach Kelly Kane ootball is a wonderful blend of brute force and chess-like tactical skills. Often, it is the coach who controls the tactical flow of the game and the players who must provide the sweat and muscle to turn an Xs-and-Os drawing into a first down. Option football is slightly clifferent, taking some of the chess moves away from the coach and into the hands of the quarterback, who must make the tactical decisions on the field a split-second after the snap. An option play is a running play that may evolve in several ways, with different ball carriers. This can be hard to defend against, because the play always begins exactly the same, and the defense has no way of knowing which of the two or three options will occur until the players are already underway This is fundamentally different than in pro football, where running plays are set before the snap, and drop-back passing poses the only real guessing game for the defense. With a drop-back passing play, though. it is chiefly the receiver who must catch and run with the ball, making him a slightly casier target. In an option running play, many players are involved in a synchronized blocking attack that scrambles the defense if execuled properly. accommodates the myriad of Division III players, letting a team be competitive even when the talent isn't quite as good us the opposition.

Division III rules do not allow colleges to offer athletic scholarships, so the type of player that matriculates from year to year is constantly changing Option football best SPLIT-SECOND DECISIONS To make an option play work, the quarterback must make decisions after the ball is snapped. In a triple option play, the quarterback, fulback or hallback can all run with the ball. Who gets the ball is a decision broken down into two parts. As soon as the quarterback snaps the ball, he looks at the \"read key.\" This is an THE ULTIMATE OPTION QB Barry Sanders, as quarterback, uses the triple option to cut upfield for an easy first down.

With practice, you should be able to pick up a first down on nearly every run to the outside, Running up the middle is tough in FOOTBAL. PRO, so don't count on your fullback sprinting for many touchdowns. With proper execution, though, you should be able to average three to four yards per carry up the middle while keeping the defense guessing. well is a definite plus but not an absolute prerequisite. The fullback must be quick off the ball and able to nm through ann tackles. It's even better if he's big or has greut speed. The halbacks should be fast and capable of blocking and catching passes; these are the players that really «stretch\" the defense horizontalk: The receivers should be fast enough to be a deep threat and capable of blocking in the open field. I've found that the key to running an option offense in FOOTBALL PRO is to make sure that your quarterback is the fastest, best running back possible. It's no surprise, then, that the tops in that area is Barry Sanders. Look to the chart to check out other top NFL.prospects for your option QB position While your hallbacks should be fast, your QB should probably be the best player, since acceleration is most important. Remember, your QB is starting from a dead stop while both the hallback and fullback will have a head of steam before they get the ball. Since an option play is hacked together from a passing play, make sure that your halfback and fullback have the best hands possible, especially since a backwards pass, if dropped, becomes a live ball that the defense can pick up and run in for a touchdown. control this play, you'll be shocked to see your QB get hammered to the turf every time. If you're ready, though, you can grab your joystick or game pad and get ready to tear up the defense yourself. Running this play well, as in real life, takes a ton of practice. Plan to log quite a few hours on the practice field before you take the play into the game. The first tip is that given the micro scale of playing football on the PC, you probably won't be able to make the first decision (to hand to the fullback or not) on the fly until you get really good at the finger dance. At first, just decide before you snap the ball. When your play is set, let your haltback go in motion, and snap the ball before he gets set. Immediately enter passing mode (tap the B button). If you decide to get the ball to the fullsack, don't even try to move your QB-simply tap the A button to get the ball to him. If you time it right, it will look like a handoff. If you wait for a fraction of a second, it will be a short pass, but it should still work. If you wait any longer, then it's a busted play If you're going to sweep right, then move as soon as you snap the ball, but be sure to stay inside of your halfback. Tap the B button again to select your haltback as the targeted receiver. As you approach the sidelines, make your decision based on the defensive movement. If there's room inside, then keep the ball and tum your QB upficld. If the sidelines are clear, NOT IN THE PROS While rcal teams would shudder at the mere idea of running their star QB or running back into so much traffic play after play, that's part of the fun of being able to do it in the sim world. While the defensive players in the pros are a very talented bunch, an effective option offense simply spreads the star defensive players too thin for them to be a factor on every play. When you find the holes, especially against a computer-controlled defense (which can't adjust nearly as well as a flesh-and-blood opponent), hammer at them mercilessly. The scoreboard will be your ultimate vindication. Kelly Kane has been the head football coach of the NCM Division III Monmouth (IL) lighting Scots for 12 years.

"DENNY ATKIN TIPS! SIMULATIUNISPACE One of the coolest features of JANE'S ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS is the ability to fly any plane in the sim (90 models total) in network mode. This allows for some really interesting match-ups, such as A-10 Warthogs vs. AV-8B Harriers. Unfortunately, the designers allow you to fly only a few planes in single-player mode. Unless, of course, you know the secret code.. To fly any plane in the Quick Mission mode, hold down the right Ctrl, Alt, and Shift keys as you click the Quick Mission button. Then click Cancel, and repeat the process. The second time you enter the screen, you'll be able to fly any plane. The right Ctrl-All-Shift combo also works with the Play Single Mission mode, allowing you to select any cam. paign mission individually. Entering a mission this way also lets you fly the other \"primary\" aircraft, such as the F14 and Harrier, combat sim. Now up to ninc players can mix it up in virtual furballs, flying any combination of FICHIER DUEL'S aircraft. You won't find complex tournament scoring or even team selups here. This is a basic, but extremely functional, free addon to hold loyal RICHTER DUEL fans while SPCS works on CITER DUEL. 2. Still, setting up teams is easy: just choose a parlicular aircraft for cach tcam, such as Spitfires vs. BF-109s. The first player to start NET DUEL becomes the server, and gets to choose the realism options and starting situation. There are five basic scenarios: Flying Circus, whr vrn i I apart randomly: Back to Back, which distances all the planes tail-to-tail; Allied vs. Axis. which places the aircraft in formations a good distance from each other, as well as Toumament and Tournament (Same Aircraft), which spreads players out equidistant from the center of the combat arena. Once you enter combat, you can only exit to change planes if you're shot down, if you crash, or if you land on the carrier or airstrip. This is to prevent pilots from chcating by escaping back to the interface when they're in danger. As long as there are fewer than nine players in flight, new fliers can join at any time. They'll enter the arena a couple of miles from the other players, at the average altitude of all the combatants. Unlike other network flight sims, you only need one copy of FICHTIER DUEL to set up a network game; the computer acting as server must have the CD-ROM loaded, but none of the other workstations need it. You're not just limited to playing on the closest Novell network, cither. NET DUEL will include the shareware version of the Kali software, which lets you set up net games over the Internet. We'll look at flying sims via Kali in an upcoming issue, but for now you can check www.kali.net for information, ON THE RADAR For a while there, it looked like every time you turned around you'd see a new F-16 game. Now get ready for the invasion of the F-22 Lightning II. Mission Studios looks ready to finally release JetFighter III in September, but its carrier-based F22s will soon see competition from the likes of Nova Logic, who will follow Commanche 3 with an F-22 game. Also rumored to be working on F-22 sims are Interactive Magic and the Andy Hollis Origin Skunk Works team, although the latter is likely quite far off. The surprise entry in all of this, though, is the DID/Ocean team, who are going to follow the modem-capable Super EF2000 Upgrade with Lightning Strike, a game based on the F-22 and-get this—the E-3 AWACS. This Windows 95 sim promises even better-looking light-sourced, texture-mapped landscapes than EF2000. The campaign will be set in a desert region, with combat over sand and water. (I'll give DID, an outfit which has valued accuracy in the past, the benefit of the doubt and assume they won't be putting their F-22s on aircraft carriers.) The improved WarGen2 campaign engine will let you plan your own missions, instead of sticking you with fixed waypoints. DID is also promising improved enemy Al, individual wingman personalities and skills, and better wingman control. More than eight players can participate in network games, VIEW TO A KILL NET DUEL includes another innovative feature with lots of potential the Net View module. At its simplest, Net View lets you essentially hop in the cockpit of any NET DUEL aircraft as an observer. You can change to any internal or external view of the aircraft and watch the action as a passive observer. Amore exciting, if perhaps a bit overboard, use of this technology is to use it to set up a virtual cockpit environment. Set up four computers around your seat, one in front, one behind, and one on cach side. Then use Net View to lock the three extra computers to side and rear views of your aircraft. Now you can check your six and side views the old-fashioned way, without using the keyboard. NET DUEL may essentially be a stopgap add-on to keep us busy while FICHIER DUEL 2-with far more sophisticated network play options -is in development, but it truly breathes new life into the sim.NET DUEL will appear on an upcoming CC-ROM, but you'll find it first (and exclusively) on CCW's Web page at http://www.zdnet.com/gaming as soon as it's ready for prime time-perhaps by the time you read this. play will make it into the initial release of this one.

"REVIEW AH-64D LONGBOW SIMULATION/SPACE Flying the Longbow in combat with full flight model realism active can be quite a challenge. Cruising along at 1000 feet at 140 knots is as easy as flying your favorite fixed-wing sim. But that's not this vchicle's clement. To maintain stealth, most of your missions will be flying contour profiles (about 40 feet above the surface, at 80 knots), or, for maximum safely, NOE (Nap-Of-the-Earth) flight around 20 feet above the surface, at 50 knots). You'll have to carefully coordinate your cyclic and collective controls to maintain your speed and altitude; climbing too high can be nearly as deadly as slamming into the ground in these SAM-laden skics. The toughest maneuver to pull off is coming to a stop before a bob-up attack. When you pull the Longbow's nose up to slow down, the helicopter climbs rapidly: try to flare too quickly and you'll climb up to 500 feet, essentially screaming, \"Look at me! I'm a bulls-cye!\" These versatile missiles have two firing Longbow promotional films included modes (brace yourself, more acronyms with LONGBOW, it's apparent how accualcal): Lock On Before Launch rate the targeting and firing sequences are (LOBL) and Lock On After Launch A few features are omitted-such as the (LOAL).

LONGBOW offers an abundance of adjustable realism settings. The flight model can be micromanaged, with tog. gles for collective motion, ground effect, weight effect, translational life, acrobatics, dynamics, altitude effects, wind, and turbulence. The most useful setting for beginners is to turn off crashes, at least until NOE flying gets easier. Weapons damage, jammer realism, and TADS targeting restrictions are also adjustable. Although you can turn off most of the realism and play LONGBow like a sophisticated arcade game, the honorable alternative is to go through the sim's training sequences. In six training missions, you'll progress from learning the instruments to basic flight and navigation, advancing to defensive countermeasures, sensors and weapons systems, and finally strategy and tactics.

LONGBOW offers an instant action mode, single missions, and a campaign.

The single mission generator lets you define characteristics, such as weather, time of day, and terrain, and then it randomly picks an appropriate mission, There are hundreds of possible mission scenarios, and even if you do get a repeated mission, the enemy doesn't always react the same way each time.

"AH-64D LONGBOW REVIEW actions do affect what's going on around you. Video interludes add to the reality, providing news reports of the action, as well as more personal clips such as your CO bestowing promotions. LONGBOW truly is the FALCON of helicopter sims, setting new standards for realism and accuracy. Despite it's authenticity, the adjustable realism options and superb training mode make it one of the most accessible authentic sims yet. Hollis and team have made this a game beginners can enjoy, without insulting their intelligence. Hopefully other developers-helicopter and fixed-wing siin alike will use this as a model for future simulations & match the command layouts of GUNSHIP 2000 and APACHE. Nearly anything else you might want to adjust in the gameflight model, graphic detail, weather, enemy intelligence-is configurable. There's very little to complain about here. Multiplayer support is currently AWOL, but Hollis and team plan an addon later this year that will provide network and modem play. Some might want to fly the CP/G position, but that's really akin to being back-seater in an F-14; the multiplayer add-on will likely add that position. And of course, the total lack of treelines takes away attack opportunities. As with all sims, the hardware demands are rigorous, and the 97 MB needed to play with full terrain detail might be prohibitive for some. Luckily, 68 MB and 36 MB installs for some Lulilu 68 MB od 36 MB installs are available as well, and you can back clown to one of the smaller footprints temporarily if you need hard disk space without having to reinstall the game. The game has a lowres mode, but you'll really need a local bus DX4 system to get a smooth frame rate. ONE KITCHEN SINK, MILSPEC As Don Pardo is fond of saying, that's not all. LONGBOW features a flight recorder, a welcome feature that's been missing from too many recent sims. You won't find fancy editing features here, but you can play back your missions at normal or high speed, and jump in and take over at any point. This is great for watching your targets being destroyed, and for jumping back in the cockpit just before a major screw-up to try to complete the mission. The second chance is good to have, since LONGBOW keeps track of your pilot's progress, promotions and medals Fully configurable controls are another nice touch. You can remap keyboard functions and save your custom keymaps; LONGBOW even includes keymaps that SIMULATION/SPACE APPEAL: Flight sim fans of all experience levels, as well as first-time sim pilots looking for a good starter. >PROS: Accurate, accessible, attractive, and action-packed.

Since three of the company's four business units (Maryland, Texas, and the U.K.) now ship under the MicroProse label, it only makes sense to unify all products under the strongest brand.

Even when Civil began to sell extremely well (one chain sold over 1500 copies in a single day), the recorders were relatively slow (due to reasons cited in Johnny Wilson's editorial in the June issue).

Unfortunately, while I was eagerly awaiting CONQUEST, three lesser games detailing the Age of Exploration appeared, ranging from the tedious to the dubious to the shamefully awful.

VIKINGS: THE STRATECY OF ULTIMATE CONQUEST confirmed my long-held suspicion that game names can reflect the quality of the final product. Despite having the words «strategy.\" \"ultimate,\" and \"conquest,\" and one of history's most successful military cultures, the title itself doesn't quite make sense. Sadly, the same can be said for the game, as well. \"lo begin with, VIKINGS, from CT Interactive, has the worst documentation I've ever seen. The 20 page booklet in the CD case provides only the barest description of game mechanics and interface. There is no real explanation of the combat system, the way trading works, or even how to outfit expeditions. Even the read.me file is inadequate, containing only two paragraphs, both about installation, a no-brainer anyway, since this is a Windows and Mac game.

"HALL OF FAME We A welcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. INDUCTION CEREMONY! X-COM MicroProse, 1994 TIE FIGHTER Lucasarts, 1994 VOTER HICROPROSE ertainly, gaming products from Europe have had success on these shores, but the greatest hits of recent years were puzzle/action affairs, such as MAGIC CARPET OR LEMMINGS. Who would have believed, especially given the subject matter-bug-eyed monsters with zap guns-that the Brits could corner the more cerebral market of turn-based strategy games? X-COM arrived totally unheralded, and many gamers figured that it would be a mere rehash of LASER SQUAD. Certainly, concepts like hidden movement and opportunity fire have been around for ages, yet rarely have they been so well employed in a man-to-man tactical combat game. Soldiers statistics improved with time-provided they survived-adding a welcome element of role playing. The alien opponents were creepy, challenging, and on the higher levels, downright merciless. The insidious mind-control of the alien leaders drove more than one gamer to psi frustration, and the horror of watching Chryssalids transform members of your squad to aliens gave more than one X-COM commander nightmares. The strategic shell was surprisingly robust, as you were forced to balance economic and political concerns in order to field your X-COM operatives and defend Earth's nations. Researching exotic alien technologies recalled the joys of CIVILIZATION, while the variety of weaponry could keep any space marine ferreting out Sectoids from UFOs until well into the 21st century. X. COM is a great game which proves that pushing the technological envelope is often less important than stoking the gamer's competitive fire. ineteen years ago, George Lucas opened our eyes to new galaxies far, far away. Ever since then, the Star Wars saga of a small Rebellion struggling against a merciless Empire has captured our collective imagination. While several games have attempted to transport us into the fiery battles of the Star Wars universe, none was more successful than TIE FIGHTER. Project leaders Lawrence Holland and Edward Kilham designed the game with an authentic Star Wars atmosphere, a strong storyline that expanded on the evil Empire, and a rousing space simulator. Players discovered what it was like to be a TIE Fighter pilot and experienced the power of the Empire's evil propa. ganda machine. We became a party to its nefarious pursuits, ensuring its survival with our brilliant piloting skills. We even flew escort for the dreaded Dark Jedi himself, Darth Vader. In addition to excellent graphics and nicely animated cut-scenes, TIE Fighter's gameplay was superb. You could fly up to five different Imperial spacecraft in the extensive Campaign Game, dogfighting with X-Wings, Frigates and myriad Rebel craft in a host of progressively difficult missions. The missions were challenging and logical, fitting nicely into the storyline, and the enemy pilots were intelligent, tough foes. There are few space sims with a combination of great gameplay, plot and atmosphere, but TIE FIGHTER stands out even among this elite company. For a true Star Wars experience, there is only one game worthy of the Emperor's favor: TIE FIGHTER.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what wot What's The IME Deal With... mas Upgrade Fever? demands on games that really don't merit them. I mean, I didn't really blow 4-odd grand on this machine just so could play THEXDER OF THIS MEANS WAR es, folks, it finally hap pened. Thanks in part to CGW and my thousands of loyal fans (well, three anyway) who couldn't bear to see me stumbling further behind the technol. ogy curve, I have finally abandoned the world of 486s forever and now revel in the realm of Pentium/4-billion and-66s, 90x CD-ROMS and graphic cards with more memory than the Library of Congress. After a year and a half of watching computer games slowly leave me behind, now I'm on top of the virtual world! So, why do I feel like I've just gotten a nose job so I can hang out with those kids on \"Beverly Hills 90210?\" Will all this power change me? Will my reviews start featuring those genius statements like, \"This game ran like a dream on my Pentium 200!\" Will I sur render to the glow of multimedia chrome? Will sloppy programming cease to bug me because my machine is too fast to care? To be honest, I dunno. Power still does corrupt. I can't say I wasn't chortling over how great WING COMMANDER 4 looked and played on my new rig. or \"Wow ing\" over finally being able to run ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS-in all ils high-res glory and multiple-aircraft complexity-without a single hiccup. But you know, EARTHSIEGE2 is still a little flat after the first few minutes of \"ooohs\" and \"ahhhs\" fade...so I know my objectivity isn't completely gone. On the other hand, my recent expe rience with Civ2 has shown me how technology can enhance chrome. When I first started playing it on the noble old clunker, the little videos for the Wonders of the World were more cute than inspiring, as they chugged onto the screen in stuttering doublespeed. But playing it on the new rig and viewing the videos as they were meant to be elicits the \"cool\" response that is so important for a game. Now, I can hear the moans of the old-timers out there saying that my head is being turned by things that are completely superfluous to a game, and to be honest, you're probably right. Video clips have nothing to do with the mechanics of a wargame. And there is no doubt that a good strategy/wargame should be playable on a 286 or even on a board, for that matter, and the ideal strat game is one where the basic game will run on anything. But I have to admit that more hardware power and accessibility to more options makes a good game even better. Speaking of running on a 286, one of the things that's really bothering me about riding the upgrade wave is the idea is that I am somehow now endorsing the outrageous system ( I sincerely doubt high-tech chrome will ever make me like a bad game. 2 wish you'd learn to code tighter!\" It reminds me of a little disagree m ent I got into with a couple of Nelwits over Origin's STRIKE COMMANDER. Now, this was in the days when a Pentium 60 was a rare and wondrous beast, and both of these upper middle class wunderkinders were going on about what an incredible game it was, while I vainly ques tioned the wisdom of a computer game that could only be properly played by, at the time, a very small percentage of the gaming public. I don't recall exactly how it turned out, but I believe my point fell on ears which had been deafened by computing power. Does the load of dough I just dropped mean I must now join them, and proclaim that only the absolutely most demanding games are the best ones? Probably not. Even though have once again caught up, I still won't care to be taken for granted by programmers who think we all make 100 g's a year and can get our computers wholesale, just like them. So, give me the WING IVs and the ATFs and the QUAKES, 'cause I want to put this rig through its paces. But while you're at it, don't forget to give everybody the X Coms and the Civs. at normal speed, simply because nobody bothered to code these things properly. Remember the good old days, when Doom squeezed every sin gle ounce of processor power out of your 386 and 4 megs of memory? Some game programmers sure seem to have gotten cocky these days about what consumers are expected to have on their desks. When programmers say, \"We sure wish they'd all get Pentiums!\" My response is, \"We sure pu Computer Gaming World (ISSN 0744-6667) is published monthly by Ziff-Davis Publishing Co..
