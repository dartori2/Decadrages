"JUST THE FAQS torical conflicts from a command perspective. They may be tactical, operational, or strategic, and stress anything from logistics and firepower to morale and leadership. They may be simple (PANZER GENERAL, EMPIRE II) to incredibly detailed and complex (Pacific WAR). How Do We Classify Games? Action/Arcade (AC): The emphasis is on hand-eye coordina tion and reflexes, usually emphasiz. ing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure (AD): Games wherein you control an alter ego and move through a storyline or sequence of events, where puzzle. solving takes precedence over con versation and combat. Classics/Puzzles (CP): Classics are old stand-bys and par: lor games that appeal to many different types of gamer. Examples include: BACKGAMMON, bridge, chess, MONOPOLY, parchesi, Risk, and SOLITAIRE. Puzzle games are com puter games which emphasize spa tial relationships, word games and/or problem-solving without requiring gamers to follow a story Shanghai, TETRIS and Zig-Zag. Role Playing (RP): RPGs are a subset of adventure games, but stress character development, often through improving stats or other attributes. Conversations with nonplayer characters (NPCs) and tacti cal combat are generally more important than in Adventure games Finally, the game world tends to be large, and the plot less linear, often with some quests/treks outside the main storyline. Simulations (SI): Highly realis tic games from a first-person perspective: you may drive a realistically simulated race car, fly a military aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed sci-fi environment. Usually polygon-filled technology is used to build the simulated world on the fly. Sports (SP): The sports game category is a broad genre which includes action (NBA Live) and strategy games (FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO) based on sports. Strategy (ST): Problem-solving, short and long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X-COM, OUTPOST, MOO), as well as \"pure\" strategy games and \"software toys\" such as SIMCITY. Wargames (WG): A subset of What Is Your Reviews Policy? 1) We only review from the final copy of the game. Though it has become popular among PC gaming magazines to review from late beta copies, we feel that the reader is best served by having the reviewer look at the same copy of a game that the readers will find on the shelves. While we recognize that this causes some delay in coverage, we believe the reader is better served by such caution. 2) We expect our reviewers to finish the game. We want our readers to be assured that we do not review based on immediate or early impressions of a game. Our reviewers give a game ample opportunity to show its quality. In some cases, bugs make it impossible to finish a game, but we identify situations where that has occurred. 3) We make every effort to match the reviewer to the game. We take into consideration the preferences, background and possible biases of the reviewer and, where possible, we find people with actual life experience or special backgrounds that match a game. We believe this policy enhances both the credibility of the review and the enjoyment of gameplay when the real world and the game world are competently compared 4) We do not accept free travel from software or hardware companies. We believe such gifts have a tacit assumption of coverage attached to them. We will only cover such events/launches as we believe will benefit our readers. HOW DO WE RATE? Outstanding: The rare game that gets it all right. The graphics, sound, and gameplay come together to form a Transcendent Gaming Experience. Our strongest buying recommendation. Very Good: A high-quality game that succeeds in many areas. May have minor prob lems, but is still worth your time and money, espe. cially if you're inter ested in the subject matter or genre Average: A mixed bag. Can be a game that reaches for the stars, but i falls short in signifii cant areas. Can also be a game that does what it does well, but lacks flair or originality Weak: A game with serious problems. Usually buggy, seriously lacking in play value, or just a poorly-conceived game design-and you will want to think long and hard before buying it. Abysmal: The rare game that gets it all wrong. This is i reserved for those products so buggy. incomplete or valueless that you wonder why they were ever released. CG MARCH 1996 "

We know there is incremental revenue to be gleaned from these old shovel ware packages, but we don't know if there is enough to fund a new division. (Apparently, this assertion was correct, since Hoff had left Atari Interactive by press time and the future of 7 both the ERACTIVE division and Atari itself was in doubt.) It's really too bad for Atari that their strategic partner/investor, Time Warner, hasn't started to shift some of their assets to the cable tele vision business. That's a new market where Atari could feasibly have an edge. The other major disappointment in stock price was Creative Technology, makers of the SoundBlaster sound card. This company has experienced phenomenal growth correlative to the sound card revolution, and its prod uct line has become very much a de facto standard. Yet, it was almost inevitable that the sound card market would flatten due to the company's previous success in penetrating the market, and that it would go through a period where research and develop ment expenditures would outstrip profit expectations. The company has weathered such a period, and now Creative hopes to duplicate in the 3-D graphic accelerator card market what it accomplished in ATIVE the sound card market. If so, it could reverse this perfor mance in the next year. On the up side, no one would have thought it bold to suggest that Broderbund would continue to ride its careful and focused product strategy into a near 30 percent gain in stock price or that Electronic Arts, the market leader in sports games on most platforms and parent of two of the hottest subsidiaries in game publishing (Origin and Bullfrog), would continue its aggressive growth pattern. EA's will. ingness to shift from platform to plat form in order to maximize profit potential and its willingness to under take promising ventures (like its recent Janes alliance and anticipated multiplayer web projects) means we'll see EA as a player for a long time. The biggest surprises were probably Activision and Sierra. Yet, the latter has benefited from: finally ship. ping some of its main titles which were using up development money: divesting itself of its unprofitable INN game network, and acquiring publishers like Impressions and Papyrus to fill out \"holes\" in the Sierra product line. Activision has largely turned around because of one big hit, M ECHWARRIOR 2. Just shipping this megahit transformed investors into believers who could suddenly see SPYCRAFT, ZORK NEMESIS and MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND landing Activision into a welcome sea of black ink filled with dollar \"sine\" waves. Add to this picture the new emphasis on quality at Mindscape/SSI (now part of foreign-owned Pearson Plc) and the hypergrowth at Interplay Productions (with its MCA backing). Suddenly, the future looks pretty bright for the computer game business. Note that the Hollywood companies haven't come to dominate the market (or even be very forceful players) and that 1995 was pretty good, indeed, to most of the companies in our business that have been here for 10 years or more. Sometimes, the good guys do win. Personally, I'd like to see revenue outperform stock price in 1996.

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH With about 150 hours of playtime on HEROES, I would like to expand on a few aspects. The slow Trolls he mentioned are actually missile units and would never lose to archers one on one. Dwarves or Ogres would have been a better example than Trolls. Also, castles don't always start with two troop types; sometimes more, sometimes less. Leaders can sometimes be ran somed in battle, so there is a possi bility for \"quarter.\" Gamewise, there are a few small glitches-such as gamemaps with inaccessible cal skill can overcome the suspiciously rapid development of the computer and its ability to crank out high-level troops from new casties. Jason is probably right on with his suggestion that the computer starts with more resources than its opponent--thus giving it the ability to grow quickly. Further, the com puter never attempts to pick up an artifact protected by assassins and has an uncanny ability to proceed directly to your strongholds. Other questionable activity has occurred. Consequently, except for the tutorial scenario, only scenarios classified as LARGE offer any reasonable chance of winning. The campaign feature is an excellent plus Unfortunately, I am making my last attempt to complete a full campaign this weekend. The last campaign scenario, thus far, has been impossible due to the computer's ability to develop so quickBILLIONTHS AND BILLIONTHS OF SECONDS I'd like to make an erratum to the article \"Mother, What a Board!\" (December, 1995). Onp. 393. col. 3. Ist paragrapl, he mentioned \"8 nanosecond...\" and spelled out \"cight millionths of a second...\" It should read \"billionths of a second\" because nano is a prefix for 109, or a billionth times a specified time. Thus, in a nanosecond circuitry, a circuit processes pulses or waveforms with rise and fall measured in billionths of a second or less. Gene M. Irasusta Hayward CA HEROES OF MIGHT & MAGIC W HEROIC OBSERVATIONS sa subscriber for years (and years). please keep up the good work. Your refusal to sugar coat game reviews continues to make the statement that you are an editorial publication and not merely an outlet for adver. tisers. I wanted to make two unrelated comments. The first is a caveat to prospective purchasers of Creative Labs AWE 32. It is not \"backwards\" compatible to earlier Sound Blaster games/cards. I have been extremely disappointed at how many of my recent pur chases lock up or produce no sound on my new computer. When I called Creative Labs for help, they told me my system was too fast! I loaned the same games to a friend who, at my sug. gestion, purchased the SB Pro with his Pentium 133 instead of the SB AWE32 card and the games work fine Creative Labs is earning a reputation for letting its users work out their own problems The second is on Jason Kapalka's review of HEROES OF MIGHT & Magic. (This game loaded and ran immediately. Thank you, New World, for writing the AWE 32 into your compatibility list.) The graph ics are outstanding and the anima tion clever and subtle--facial expressions change appropriately during combat.) Jason is right on with his evaluation that the game has reduced replayability and slight shortness in the manual's informa tion. A number of important game aspects must be discovered by the player. His five-star rating was a bit high, but that's what makes the world a different place ET ol AG resources and one especially frustrating area that permits your group to sneak past the ghosts on the way into a cul-desac, but not on the way out. Until one learns to closely scrutinize areas, resources can be obscured by map features. In combat, the icon showing which spell your troop has been hit with can be cov. ered by a nearby companion. However, my biggest complaint with the game is the computer cheats which have rendered most scenarjos unwinnable (read unplayable). As a calibrator, I completed two PANZER GENERAL campaigns with all Major victories except for a Minor victory in the American invasion So, there's my perspective when I say that HEROES' Al is good. However, no amount of human tactiNew World has an excellent value game which could be improved with a \"Daddy, can I play too?\" selection, a random map generator, and (as could any game) improved Al-especially from the strategic standpoint. R. Jesser Marietta, GA Hmm, 150+ hours and it's not a five-star game? Wow! Makes one wonder how many hours you would spend on a \"real\" five-star game! Still, we have some good news for you. New World is so pleased at how HEROES OF MIGHT & Magic has been received that they are working on an expanded version. In addition to the random map generalor, an upcoming sequel will feature a construction kit for making your own maps and campaigns. PROTECTION RACKET One of the aspects of CGW that I like the most is its honest ratings of games. (Some of the other magazines seem not to want to offend anyone and talk about each new game like it is the greatest.\") I do have, however, a problem with your game reviews when you say \"Protection: None (CD must be in drive)\". To me, this is a contradiction in terms. If the program checks for a specific CD in the drive, then it uses a key Disk protection. This is the same protection as many 1980s games used and that consumers found so annoying, Kenneth Ballard Moraga, Ca. As we've noted before, sometimes this is key disk protection and sometimes, it is not. Sometimes, as in the Case of GABRIEL KNICHT 2: THE BEAST WITHIN, the CD must be in the drive because the movie segments CG MARCH 1996 "

Tim Wisseman's BBS, the alt.games.xga-planets usenet group and/or the AOL forum area, he would have realized VGAP in 1995 was dedicated to the development of WINPLAN (planets 35). A new windows-criven interface, this is a prelude to 4.0. It was also a vear that saw the development and release of the NEW 3.2 HOST program for planets that greatly expanded the platform of VCAP. The expansion has allowed \"hooks\" in the host program that allow outside programmers to create expansion modules that run within the host, so that people can create new and exciting features to this beloved game (it has been in your top 50 forever). With the release of the new HOST and WINPLAN came the release of some add-on software by Dan & Dave (I am Dave). We added five new modules to VGAP that have proven very popular and have extended the playability and life of VGAP a great deal. Working with Tim, I also created a complete user manual. A huge 129-page manual for ihe game. And a quarterly newsletter dedicated to the VGAP Players. All of which have been well recieved and have enhanced the game itself and the amount of enjoyment that can be gained from it. As a contributor to VGA PLANETS 4.0.1 can tell you it is well into development now that WINPLAN was put to bed.

"READ.ME CONTaking Stock Of 1995 ICLINE The Winners And Losers Of Interactive Entertainment ith the rapid growth in interactive entertainment, many investors might think that \"there's gold in them games.\" The truth is, computer game companies are just as likely to post big losses as big earn. ings, as we discovered from their 1995 financial reports. It is true that computer software is one of the fastest growing segments of the stock market, and it continues to outperform the market overall. In 1994, the Standard & Poors' 500 index declined 1.5 percent, while the Computer Software & Services Index rose 17.9 percent. Similarly, through October of 1995, the software mar ket saw a 48 percent increase compared to the S&P index which gained only 27 percent. According to PC Data of Reston, VA, computer games account for nearly 22 per. cent of the total revenue in this market. With the help of Davis Skaggs Investment Management (San Francisco, CA), we found that nearly all of the major game producers/distributors were either big winners or big losers last year, with the exception of Sanctuary Woods which reported almost \"normal\" returns (see Johnny Wilson's Editorial, page 20, for related information). Although it's still operating in the red, Activision logged the biggest turn-around with a 120 percent stock price increase over last year, most of which is attributable to MECHWARRIOR 2's success. Microsoft and Broderbund were the big earnings per share winners, thanks to the diversity of their product lines, brand recognition and \"evergreen\" product upgrades, which, according to Broderbund's marketing promotions manager, Eric Winkler, \"offsets the hit-driven entertainment market.\" So, if diversity is the answer, what's the secret of Sierra's success? Well, according to the Standard & Poors' stock reports, \"strategic acquisitions will continue to bolo ster the company's product line and programming capabilities.\" --Jill Anderson Company Symbol 0.55 $ per share S per share 96 Change Earnings per Cashflow per Earnings per 12/30/94 12/29195 in 1995 share '95 share 95 share 94 14.38 12.38 13.9046 0.86 0.20 1.00 5.00 11.00 120.00% -0.11 0.06 0.97 3.81 63.9044 na 0.16 46.75 60.75 29.90% 1172 1.33 14.25 39.5046 0.30 0:37 1.11 19.25 26.13 35.70% 0.86 2.39 21.10% 2.05 -1.78 0.15 61.13 87.75 43.60% 2.32 288 45096 17.13 28. 75 6 7.904 0.74 0.24 13.50 6.50 51.9046 -0.91 0.64 1995 Year-end results not avallable ?

You won't have to bother with building or harvesting anything here. Instead, the objective is more like capture-the-flag Here's how it works: each territory is comprised of a dozen or so squares. In each square is a flag and either a robot production or vehicle production plant. The side that touches the flag first controls the square and its attendant production facility. To win each scenario, you must destroy your enemy's beginning strong hold. But to do that, you'll need a good-sized army, which in turn requires a healthy produc tion base. Thus, the game becomes a race to see who can control the most squares, then quickly degenerates to a hard-hitting melee as you attempt to wrest control of each square from your enemy.

"FLIGHT SIM ROUNDUP The Mad Scramble Of 1996 Flight Sims Gives You Several Ways To Achieve Tone BY DENNY ATKIN he coming year promises the heaviest air action since Operation Desert Storm, but this time most of it will be taking place in virtual airspace. Modern jet simulations are set to rule the skies, with historical sims popping up for occasional border skirmishes. We fired up the radars and sent out recon drones to bring you this intelligence report on incoming aircraft ranging from Apaches to X-planes. WWUMMUMID MARCH 1998 "


"FLIGHT SIM ROUNDUP THE F-16S COMETH The Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon has been a favorite choice of sim developers, and for good reason. A superb close-range dogfighter, the F-16 is also an adept strike aircraft, capable of carrying up to 12,000 pounds of air-to-air and air-to-mud weaponry. Likewise, the F-16 is a nat: ural choice for flight sims, since the plane's flexibility lets designers send gamers on a wide variety of missions. IRAQ-ING UP KILLS A squadron of F-16 sims is flying onto shelves over the course of this year, aiming to usurp FALCON 3.0's long-standing status as the king of serious flight simulations. First on the block should be BACK TO BAGHDAD, from newcomer Military Simulations, Inc. This simulation of a hypothetical Second Gulf War straps you into the cockpit of an F-16C Block 50 and sends you on over 60 missions into Iraq, many of which duplicate missions flown in Operation Desert Storm. MSI's design specifications indicate that this is one of the most ambitious attempts at exactly duplicating a plane's systems and its flight environment) yet. The sim is set to model nine modes of the F. 16's APG-68 radar system, and you'll need to learn to manage details such as antenna elevation and azimuth to get a lock on the enemy. If you're a real stickler for realism, you can even dig out that old Hercules monochrome video card and monitor from the attic, stick it in your Pentium system, and use the second monitor as a dedicated radar dis play. A full 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) flight model is promised, along with detailed terrain based on the same French satellite imagery used FRONT LINE FALCON Next in the pattern is F-16 FIGHTING FALCON, from the team of Digital Integration and Interactive Magic. This isn't Digital Integration's first try at an F-16 simulation. The company's F-16 COMBAT PILOT-released over five years ago for the Amiga, Atari ST, and EGA PC-was a standardsetter for its time. F-16 FIGHTING FALCON is slated to continue that tradition of realism and sophistication. The design document we examined indicated that Di's simulating just about every control in the F-16's cockpit except the air-conditioning knob. If you're not a sim ace yet, don't despair. A free-for-all arcade mode is promised as well. The product was originally slated for release this spring, but DI decided to put its resources into finishing Hind first, so look for it this fall. The extra time will be spent revamping the gouraud-shading graphics engine used in APACHE and HIND, adding texture mapping and other enhancements. Resolutions up to 800x600 will be supported, so F-16 RE-ENGINED FALCON Digital Integration is replacing FFIGHTING FALCON 16 FIGHTING FALCON'S APACHE-style terrain engine, shown should look good here, with a new texture-mapped design. and feel good. Mission struc ture looks similar to that of APACHE and HIND, with training missions, sin gle missions, network play, and a campaign mode. Expect a dramatically enhanced version of the mission planner found in TORNADO as well. VAPOR BIRD But what of the game that everyone's been waiting for, Spectrum Holobyte's FALCON 4.0? Don't hold your breath on this one, folks. Although Spectrum Holobyte treated the press to a sneak-peek at this sequel to 1991's FALCON 3.0 way back in late 1994, nowadays the company won't say anything about it other than it's expected to ship late this year. At the preview, we saw preliminary work on a more detailed terrain engine, much-improved aircraft models, and a 3-D base environment that players would work in between missions. However, this was well over a year-and-a-half ago, and most of that development team has moved on to other projects or other companies. With Spectrum's silence on the title and Top Gun still not shipping at press time, we'll be surprised to see FALCON 4.0 this year. BAGHDAD SHUFFLE Actual satellite imagery of Iraq lends authenticity to BACK TO BAGHDAD's missions. by General Schwartzkopf prior to the Gulf War. If the usual load of Mavericks, Sidewinders, AMRAAMS, and iron bombs doesn't seem to be giving Saddam a bad enough day, you can also drop the B-46 tacti cal nuclear weapon. If the designers live up to most of their stated goals, BACK TO BAGHDAD will make FALCON 3.0 look like a novice's sim. If all this wasn't enough, MSI is also promising to release a version with Internet play later in 1996, with support for over 50 players per session. FUTURE FIGHTERS There are plenty of doomsayers who predict worldwide chaos or even Armageddon in the year 2000. If it doesn't happen, they can at least turn to the profusion of upcoming sims that simulate major conflicts at the end of the Millennium. MARCH 1996 "

"FLIGHT SIM ROUNDUP with texture mapped rolling European landscapes and beautifully cam ouflaged aircraft.

A rich combat environment will include other aircraft flying on inde. pendent missions, so you may be faced with decisions such as \"do I fly the assigned mission, or attack that group of bombers that seems to be heading toward my aerodrome?\" Similar to the campaign generator in EF2000, missions are created by a dynamic generator, so you won't find yourself flying a canned series as you advance your pilot through the ranks. Modem and Network play have been added to this version, and if some performance issues are addressable, Dynamix may be able to support up to 16 players. Look for a full-fledged preview in next month's CG. BARON DOWN The pilot of this RED BARON II Fokker Triplane will be painting a British roundel on the side of his plane when he gets home fly an aircraft in support of these movements.. BATTLES OVER BRITAIN MicroProse's 1943: THE EUROPEAN AIR WAR takes the successful 1942: THE PACIFIC AIR WAR engine and reworks it as a simulation of the aerial battles against Nazi forces. Like its predecessor, the year means little: the simulation actually starts with the Battle of Britain and ends in 1945 after VE Day. Starter Sims CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF There are a number of other sims still in the embryonic stage: we probably won't see these until 1997. The folks at Looking Glass Technologies are finally granting the wish of all FLIGHT UNLIMITED fans: armed aircraft. The company's goal is to build a combat simulation with graphics and flight models as impressive as those in its freshman aerobatic simulation. To this end, they've put together a design team that includes, among other pilots, a former F-16 driver who's flown mis. sions over Bosnia. This sim won't see the light of day until mid-1997 and at this early stage of development, LGT is interested in finding out what you want to see in it. Pop over to http://www.glass.com and answer the online survey. Other projects still in the rumor stage: Reliable sources say the second Jane's Combat Simulations product from the Andy Hollis team at Origin will be a highly accurate F-22 Lightning Il simulation. (Yep, no carrier ops here!) Ocean is currently in the planning stage for the sequel to EF2000, code-named TFX3. Dynamix has had a test pilot style jet simulation planned for a while, but that's been put on the back burner in favor of the company's Tigre helicopter sim. HISTORY LESSONS Simulations seem to come in phases. Modern jets will rule the shelves for a while, then the World War Il pistonengined era will resurface. At the moment the historical sim category is in hibernation, at least as far as single player fly. ing goes. With only a couple of releases in each World War category this year, real sim pilots, who don't use missiles, won't be faced with much decision-making stress. f your prior experiences with flight sims have generally involved smacking into runways and mountains at mach speed, don't give up. Some new sims are targeted at the casual gamer who just wants to get up into the skies and shoot something. If you've seen the movie, you have all the preparation you need to play Spectrum Holobyte's long-delayed Top GUN: FIRE AT WILL. You'll take on the role of Maverick in this F-14 Tomcat simulation, which, although simplified, features a realistic. deadly assortment of opponent aircraft. Heavy radio traffic-both from other planes and Goose, your back-seater-will help guide you through your missions. Although instrumentation and radar have been simplified, the flight physics are pretty good, and you'll find Top GUN is a good transition into more realistic simulations. On the even simpler side is Sierra/Dynamix's SILENT THUNDER: A-10 REVENGE. This game bridges the gaps between 3-D arcade shooters and more realistic flight sims. Forget the typical tactical situations here--this ain't the Air Force, this is Hollywood. You're a mercenary tasked with eliminating Columbian Drug traffickers, aggressive Middle East terrorists, and-get this-North Korean forces who are risking war in an effort to kidnap an international film star. The A-10's flight model here is extremely simple: you won't see much difference over the five-year-old original here. The combat universe is small, and the sharp graphics and rock-and-roll soundtrack highlight SILENT THUNDER's emphasis on game over simulation. A-10 ATTACK SILENT THUNDER: A-10 REVENGE IS more about action than accuracy. BARON VON SEQUEL Sierra's Dynamix division is working on one of the most antici: pated sequels in flight simulation history. RED BARON II is the follow-up to Dynamix's classic 1991 sim, a title so good versions can still be found on store shelves five years later. With such high standards to fol. low, could RED BARON II possibly live up to its predecessor? I was able to fly an early version of this biplane sim, and I don't think this update will disappoint.

"FLIGHT SIM ROUNDUP fixed-wing arena. The next chopper sim on the block is Interactive Magic and Digital Integration's Hind, the sequel to last year's hit APACHE. See the preview that follows this feature for full details. You'll be able to fly for the British, American, or German air forces on a variety of missions, including bomber interception, escort ground support, and fighter sweeps. Twenty different flyable aircraft are includ. ed, and MicroProse plans to use feedback from 1942:PAW to provide better gameplay. The biggest difference here is the addition of a squadron career. You'll be able to choose a starting level, from wingman to group leader, 2659 BS HELO THERE Next up after HiND will be AH-64D LONGBOW, an Apache simulation from EA/Origin's Jane's Combat Simulations line. Designer Andy Hollis says that in addition to the plentitude of Jane's reference material, his team has access to the design documentation and operator manuals for the Longbow Apache-which he finds rather amazing considering the Longbow isn't even in full production yet. The game can be played in VGA and SVGA, and will offer texture mapped, rolling terrain. Hollis says the texture mapped objects are stun. ningly detailed, and \"we put in lots of gratuitous ways to look at this stuff, since you're usually flying over it at high speed or blowing it up.\" The flight engine is completely new-there's no rehashed STRIKE COMMANDER Code here. Hollis and his team have been consulting with an Apache Training Brigade at Ft. Hood, Texas, and a group of three pilots has been visiting Origin on a regular basis to help with flight modeling. He claims there's a certain realistic buoyancy to the helicopter's movement that he's never experienced in a sim before. Although the product is slated to come with a manual that's several hundred pages long, you probably won't need it. LONGBOW will feature interactive tutorial missions with an instructor's voice guiding you. Once you're up to speed, you can fly historical mission based on actual Apache missions in Panama and the Persian Gulf, as well as a fictional series of missions in the Ukraine. There's also a non-linear campaign mode. The terrain for all these actions is based on U.S. Geological Service digital elevation map data. The most welcome aspect of the ter rain engine is the addition of treelines in addition to the usual valleys and ridges-for once, standard helicopter pop-up altacks will be effec live AVA SIGHTSEEING RIDES APACHE LONGHOW will feature near-FLIGHT UNLIMITED-quality terrain. And guns too! and work your way through the ranks. At each level of command you'll gain more control over the group, eventually being given complete con trol over pilot roster, aircraft armament, and so on. The gameplay will also change just by the nature of the European air war. Missions are more oriented toward strategic bombing, and bomber escort or attack missions will require new strategies. Also, much of your combat will be over populated-and often hostile-lands, rather than empty ocean. Both head-to-head and cooperative missions are supported using modem or network links. Going Solo DUEL REDUX Jaeger Software has started work on FIGHTER DUEL 2, an update that addresses many of the complaints about the company's freshman PC product. FIGHTER DUEL is superb if you have access to a human oppo. nent, but can quickly fall flat if you're playing alone. FD2 will feature a series of mission scenarios which should keep thing interesting during solo play. The combat has moved inland, and you'll now be able to battle over something more interesting than a huge expanse of blue water. More planes will be featured, and they won't all use FD's P-51 instru ment panel. This Win 95 sim will allow network play (cooperative and antagonistic) in addition to modem links. Piston jocks will also be able to check out solo versions of Domark's CONFIRMED KILL and Kesmai's Air WARRIOR 2; see the sidebar \"Going Solo\" for details. Finally, Dynamix is said to be planning a Battle of Britain simulation sometime after the release of RED BARON II. enerally, sims are designed first as stand-alone games, and then network and modem play is added as a bonus value, but a few companies are taking their networked sims on solo flights. Interactive Magic and Kesmai are teaming up to create a boxed version of Air WARRIOR 2. This one promises to offer a lot more standalone playability than the old Konami SVGA AIR WARRIOR, as it will sport a wide variety of offensive and defensive missions. See last month's Simulations column for full details. Domark plans a standalone release of CONFIRMED KILL a few months after the online version goes live this summer. The company is working with a group that's done military-spec sims on this one, and \"exceedingly realistic flight modeling\" is promised. Among the promised features are a mission editor, virtual cockpits with a padlock view, 3-D graphics card support, and voice-transmission capability There's also a chance we could see a standalone version of ICI's WARBIRDS, the multiplayer sim covered in this month's Simulations column, from Graphic Simulations.

">FLIGHT SIM ROUNDUP An add-on disk slated for fall release will add new missions, multiplayer support, a Windows 95-native engine, and hardware support for 3-D graphics. ROTOR REGISTRATION Development of a third Apache simulation, simply named AH-64A, is being spearheaded by Domark's Bryan Walker, a former AH-64 pilot who flew in Desert Storm. Walker's experience isn't just going to aid the hardware-accuracy of AH-64A-his team also plans to add a human element. Each pilot will have a set of personality traits that will govern his performance over the course of a deployment-battlefield events and the quality of your leadership will affect crew cohesion. You may even have to shuffle crews around when pilots don't get along, or charm the supply officer into slipping your boys some nonstandard \"morale boosters.\" Slated to use the same 64,000 color graphics engine as FLYING NIGHTMARES 2. AH64A will draw on Walker's experience as an Apache driver to make sure that the flight model, weapons performance, and combat tactics are as accurate as possible. Perhaps most exciting is Domark's new networking code, which should ROTOR SCOOTER Information from Jane's and input from a real Apache Training Brigade could make APACHE allow connectivity between AH LONGBOW the most realistic whirly sim yet. 64A, FLYING NIGHTMARES 2, and (oddly enough) CONFIRMED KILL. ivilian sims are set to experience a resurgence late in the year, thanks to a flight sim industry that's had more mergers than the airlines in recent months. Microsoft purchased BAO, the Bruce Artwick Organization responsible for coding FLIGHT SIMULATOR 5.1 and a wide variety of add-ons, in late 1995. Look for the software giant to step up its simulation efforts in coming months. Meanwhile, Sierra has purchased the flight simulation business of SubLogic, the company that pioneered personal computer flight simulation over 15 years ago. Sierra plans to combine the realism of SubLogic's flight models and aircraft systems with the Dynamix 3Space terrain technology to create a new recreational flying sim that may take on FLIGHT SIMULATOR. Look for five aircraft, including an amphibian and an aerobatic stunt plane. Looking Glass Technologies will be releasing a Windows 95 version of FLIGHT UNLIMITED, featuring five new airport areas to fly from. An inexpensive upgrade will be available for purchasers of the DOS version. Next up from LGT is a general aviation sim that takes the graphics and flight model detail of FLIGHT UNLIMITED and adds visual and instrument navigation, scenarios, and a combat-game-style mission structure. Reliable sources say that along with the typical general aviation aircraft, LGT plans to sneak a P-51 Mustang into the sim as well.

"SNEAK PREVIEW H N D SICHT CSNEAK GPREVIEW al Integration And I-Magic Make A Cool Mil GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT BY DENNY ATKIN here are faster helicopters, there are more powerful helicopters, and there are certainly stealthier helicopters. But you won't find a meaner looking helicopter than the Mil Mi24 Hind. This attack helicopter started life as a heavily armed assault troop transport, but ended up serving as the Soviet Union's primary gunship, and was a common sight wherever the Eastern Bloc military projected its power While the United States' AH-64 Apache relies on a combi nation of speed, agility, and sophisticated electronics for a battlefield advantage, the Mi-24 Hind holds its own using brute force. Heavy armor and big missiles made it a feared sight in Afghanistan, and throughout the Soviet bloc. Today, the Hind remains in service in the air forces of around 20 nations, and thanks to the efforts of Digital Integration and Interactive Magic, it will soon be appearing on PC screens as well. HIND is the companies' sequel to last year's successful APACHE helicopter simula tion. It's based on the same simulation engine as APACHE, So much of what you'll find here is familiar. However, the Hind's mission and capa bilities are different enough to give this simulation a fresh feel. Apache's auto-stabilization system, so its pilots must deal with control cross-coupling. Hind features three flight models: Arcade, designed to be extremely easy to fly; Realistic, designed to simulate as closely as possible the Hind's real flight characteristics, and Simplified, which is identical to realistic mode but with control cross-coupling removed. Don't let the cross-coupling scare you, though. Although the Hind isn't as easy to fly as the Apache, a flight control system on the real Hind absorbs oscillation in all three axes, stabilizing the aircraft in a level attitude and making it easier to hold course in forward flight and while hovering. The Alpha version I evaluated only had the Arcade flight model active, but given Di's record with sims like APACHE and TORNADO, HIND's realistic model shouldn't disappoint. The Hind's 12.7mm four-barreled Gatling-type cannon fires 4,000 to 5,000 rounds per minute, but doesn't pack as much punch as the 30mm cannon on the Apache. It has plenty of power for air-to-air use or against lightly armored ground targets, but for main battle tanks you'll need to rely on pylon-mounted missiles. No problem there, though. With rails for four AT-6 Spiral anti-tank missiles, along with four pylons capable of carrying more anti-tank missiles, 80mm rocket pods, grenade launchers, napalm bombs, and even mine-laying equipment, the Hind is anything but under-armed, The Hind's avionics suite isn't as sophisticated as the Apache's, but it does have a HUD, low-light-level TV displays, laser designator, and a threat warning system called the Natasha Device that analyzes an approaching missile's signature and warns the crew of the missile type, bearing, and range using an audible female voice. og BLADE RUNNER The Hind is a much larger helicopter than the Apache, and isn't nearly as agile. An older design, the helicopter also doesn't have the COMBAT ROCK Hind's menu structure will be familiar to any APACHE flyer. Quickstart is an arcade-style scenario which drops you right into the heart of a battle, complete with a missile locked on target. This mode features a simplified, arcade-style flight model, as well as a scoring mechanism MIL SPEC The Mil Mi-24 Hind presents an intimidating profile. 91990 W MARCH 1996 "


"SNEAK PREVIEW HIND ON THE CHOPPER BLOCK A South Korean tank gets tanked by a Spiral missile network play. While network play has been fine-tuned, the SVGA graphics engine is essentially the same as found in Apache. The Gouraud-shaded polygon graphics look really nice; while the lack of texture mapping means you don't get the \"you are there\" feeling you get in EF2000, the realistic palette and smoothing effects give a much less computerish effect than Su-27 FLANKER. Thankfully, it appears that Di is modeling the Russianstyle instruments realistically, but rendering the displays with English characters instead of Cyrillic (at least, in the preliminary version I flew). The terrain looks good, but suffers from one major flaw that also plagued APACHE: there are only a few scattered trees. This means you can't pop up from behind foliage to execute your attacks. (You can, however, use buildDEATH ON RAILS A train meets an unfortunate end ings and hills for pop-up during a supply interdiction mission. attacks.) There was no sound in the Alpha version, but Di says the all-digital sound will include English speech read by someone with a Russian accent to add atmosphere. At first glance, Hind looks very much like a slight modification of APACHE. But with the differences in mission profiles and helicopter han. dling, it's a new personality hiding behind that familiar face. Mil mi-24 Hind and a top 10 vanity board. If you've had a really bad day and you just want to blast things, Quickstart Invincible sets you up in a similar situa tion, but with unlimited fuel and weaponry, and none of that annoying ground fire. Once you get a basic feel for chopper combat in the arcade mode, Training mode will show you how you're supposed to fly the thing Once you get the hang of things, you can fly a series of single mis sions, or take a shot at the campaign. Although the campaign missions are pre-scripted, the mission sequence depends on your performance. Botch a mission and you get dropped a skill level: excel and you'll move up. Unless your piloting is robotically consistent, you'll be able to play the campaigns a number of times before the missions repeat. Because the Hind can carry many things the Apache can't-includ. ing bombs and troops-you'll find a wider variety of missions here. You may be tasked with crossing enemy lines and dropping troops into a hot spot, or you migh be sent on Medivac missions. Anti-ship and antisub missions should surface in this sim, as well as traditional escort recon, point-attack, and search and destroy missions. The action takes place in three locales. You'll fly against the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, taking on well-armed guerrilla troops as well as Pakistani Air Force F-16s. The Korean theater puts you in the middle of a North Korean incursion into South Korea in a raid to alleviate a chronic food shortage. Securing food supplies is a unique goal for a flight sim: despite your humanitarian intentions, a well-armed force that includes Apache Longbows will try to send you packing for home. Finally, the Kazakhstan scenario pits you against a rebellious breakaway republic using mostly ex-Soviet technology including Hinds. he Mi-24, NATO code-named Hind, was designed in the early 1970s as a heavily armed assault transport for a squad of ground troops. Although current designs are used as offensive gunships, all Hind models retain the troop transport capability. The troop-carrying capabilities necessitate a wide silhouette that's uncharacteristic of a qunship, but heavy armor, IR jammers, exhaust suppressers, and flare dispensers aid combat effectiveness. Along with the usual air-to-ground ordinance, the Hind-E (Mi24W) model added the capability to carry AA-8 Aphid air-to-air missiles. In the Iran Iraq war, an Iranian F-4 Phantom fell victim to a Hind, but the Hind used a Spiral anti-tank missile to down the jet. The oddest variant is perhaps the Hind-G, first identified in operation at Chernobyl. Instead of wingtip weapon pylons, it sports \"clutching hand\" mechanisms on lengthened pylons. It's believed that this model is designed for NBC (nuclear/biological/chemical) warfare.

There are also a number of two-player missions, playable using network, serial, or modem connections. Combat pits the players against each other: Pilot/Gunner mode puts one pilot at the flight controls and the second in the gunner position; and Leader/Wingman is a coopera. tive mode where two Hinds fly together. The Korean theater is shared with APACHE, and the two sims can be tied together for head-to-head or MARCH 1996 "

"Sid Meier's CIVNET REVIEW DIFFICULTY LEVEL Manifest Destiny Building New Civilizations Online With Sid Meier's CiVNET by Terry Coleman CIWE n the surface, what could go wrong? One of the greatest games ever designed for the computer, CIVILIZATION, gets a facelift: new interface, better AI, SVGA graphics and finally, multiplayer human play. More than any. thing, when I play CivNet, I am reminded of another MicroProse masterpiece. Not SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION, so much as MASTER OF Magic. This is not to say that CivNet crashes all the time, or that the design is unfin ished, as with MOM, but rather, that CivNET lacks that final bit of polish so essential to a truly finished, professional product. Oddly enough, the game plays remarkably well-solitaire. The com puter opponents are improved, the bevy of advisors--military, science, and so on actually give reasonable advice on how to discover the mysterious secrets of plastics, create steel for those huge battleships, and so forth. When the action gets too frantic, you can actually turn city management over to the computer (with some restrictions) and concentrate on the Big Picture instead of just micro-managing your CivHeart out But no one buys a game like CivNet to play only against the com puter, regardless of how much better that computer opponent might be than in the original game. And for many, the thrill of competing against other human CivMeisters is somewhat diminished when they find that the hotseat option reveals all of the other Human Civilizations at any time! Then again, the infestation doesn't stop there. TCP/IP works fine for Internet and Network play-once you have the inevitable MicroProse patch--but IPX and NetBios seem doomed to failure (we had numerous crashes in every IPX-based session we attempted). Why? Obviously, most gamers will play through TCP/IP over the Net, but if the main reason for this game is multiplayer human play, how could MicroProse not wait until these net play bugs in particular were ironed out?

Guess IN Tales Bullding A Better World For Democracy fter founding Washington in 4000 B.C., the Americans, led by the noble (but tough) Jorge of Jones, built their first militia unit. Never a country to sit back in a defensive posture, our newly-formed military force was immediately sent forth into the wilderness By the time the second militia unit had been built, the first troop had discovered a few ancient tribes and gained the knowledge these wise people had developed. But soon afterwards, tragedy struck. A barbarian settlement was accidentally disturbed, and refused our offer of friendship. Like a swarm of bees, the uncouth hordes swept over our first military unit and eliminated it. Angered, our proud militia took revenge on the heathens, as we quickly trained more troops due to the emergency Later, our newly-invented cavalry scouting unit chanced upon the Egyptians. Knowing a weak civilization when they saw it, they quickly took Thebes for the glory of our great civilization. Soon afterwards, the puny Greek civilization was steamrolled. \"Nothing\", proclaimed Jorge of Jones, \"will halt our expansion. We will not rest until America rules the world, so that all people may be safe and free.\" By 1 A.D. the Americans had well over 700,000 citizens, 4 thriving cities and, in classic American style, no money. But nothing would stop them, except the Managing Editor. Or a crash.--George Jones My Return To Civilization he Luddites modus operandi was to found a city, build one military unit, and convert to building settlers in order to expand as soon as possible. I was gambling that I was far apart from the other civilizations at this point and early in the game, things looked positive. I established Wasteland atop a Forest square and next to a body of water where I had a Fish resource. I built one militia unit and sent him scouting while I built my first additional settlers. Unfortunately, two turns away from the completion of the settler unit, a potential enemy appeared. I immediately bought a Phalanx unit and chased the Chinese aggressor out of sacred Luddite territory. We were able to establish an alliance, but on two separate occasions, he forced me to convert from settler development to purchase a military unit. I don't like the Mac-like interface. Indeed, it cost me severely when a trireme full of military units ended up the turn in a sea square that was non-adjacent to a coastal shore. On such an occasion, the ship and all aboard are lost. Then, before I could recover from my interface problem, Denny the Yellow Scourge moved in behind me and destroyed my city (yes, one city-my original plan went by the wayside when I kept having to convert settlers to military units to stave off his incursions). Re-entering the game as a new civilization, I inadvertantly wiped out George's civilization. CivNet doesn't feature any error-trapping for new entries into the game so if the new player accidentally chooses a color that is already in play, it can wipe out the other player. However, once we figured out what was wrong and re-started, my position was still untenable. I started anew with a basic city, waited five turns for a militia unit and was immediately destroyed by you guessed it, Denny the Yellow Peril. Maybe I need to write a new book-Sid Meier's Civilization or The Peril of the East.-Johnny Wilson MARCH 1996 "


"Sid Meier's CIVNET REVIEW Peaceful Majesty he Hittites began calmly enough, until they ran into the surly German empire. Although warfare is distasteful to our peace-loving society, we were forced to rid the world of the militaristic menace. Afterwards, we secured our borders and began forging cities to last the milennia (three of the top five cities were Hittite), filled with the Lighthouse of Leipzig, The Gardens of Ur, The Oracle of Nom, and other great works which were nearing completion. Oddly enough, the human-controlled barbarians posed the greatest threat to our Empire. When we met the Chinese, we attempted to trade with them, and established a small settlement (not realizing that they considered this their sole continent). Rather than communicate with us, the savages annihilated our settlement, and had the gall to accuse us--the beneficent Hittites! -of enchroaching upon their lands. For now, we will make peace...until the citizens of our land are no longer so forgiving. (Do I feel a new government coming on?)-Terry Coleman The Reign Of The Great Ruler Denny Tse Tung Of The Chinese he isolation of the Chinese people ended in the year 3480 BC, when one of our scouting armies met with an odd race that called themselves the Luddites. Initial contact seemed beneficial for both our peoples, as we traded knowledge of our ceremonial burial practices for instruction in horseback riding. Indeed, the trade did benefit both of our peoples, as once our mounted armies invaded their city, they would have many dead to bury. The Luddite city, Wasteland, was unfortunately placed on a thin stretch of land that our armies needed to cross in order to expand our empire and make room for our growing nation. The Luddites grew nervous about our alliance, but I assured them that our armies were simply passing by As I sailed with my Triremes, however, I ran across the Luddites, sailing to the west. Could they have loaded their armies on the ship, leaving their city defenses weak? I massed my armies to the north, invading Wasteland. Success! It was beyond my dreams-the Luddites had left their city completely undefended! The continent was mine, and I was free to expand. All was uneventful until the year 1260, when our people encountered the Americans. I'd heard of their power, so I decided that an alliance with them, against the Hittites, would be the wisest course of action. For now, at least. But once my people build the empire a bit more....-Denny Atkin 10 Steps To A More StableCivilization 1. If you are new to Crv, play solo until you can give the computer a good fight at Warlord level. If Human-controlled Civilizations are so crafty that they leave your inexperienced Civ too far behind in the first hour of play, the remainder of the game isn't much fun. 2. Forget hot-seat play. For parties, You DON'T KNOW JACK is a lot more fun, with less hassle. 3. Set your net game up with TCP/IP rather than IPX or NetBIOS for greater stability 4. Even if you think you have WinG drivers installed already (whether Win 3.1 or Win 95) don't take a chance. Go through the entire Setup for CivNet when you first install the game; it's worth the extra time to make sure your drivers are compatible with those that MicroProse requires. 5. Need some tactical tips? I could recommend a certain strategy guide by two CGW editors (Civilization, Or Rome On 640K A Day, by Johnny Wilson and Alan Emrich, Prima Publishing), but that would be a shameless plug. 6. Sequential play is still the best way to learn the game when playing solo. Tum-based play is in all gamers' DNA (even if they don't want to admit it). 7. Parallel turns are the only way to go for network/internet play. I hate waiting for people to move when my clock is running on the Internet. With parallel turns, if I finish before my adversaries/friends, I can better tweak my cities, without twiddling my thumbs. 8. Allowing two minutes per turn results in focused, lively play. The howls (and messages) from inveterate micro-managers when the turn ends too soon are half the fun of the game. If it gets too frantic, let the computer run some of your less important cities on autopilot while you catch your breath. 9. Play at Prince level. While King level sounds tempting for macho CivNuts, they will soon lament the additional Barbarians, which are such a nuisance as to slow play considerably. Having four content citizens per city, rather than three, makes it much easier to increase your empire's size. This means finding other Human Civs earlier. 10. No human gets the Pyramids. Any CivLeader in our group who breaks this meets a most untimely demise (as soon as we find his/her Civilization), simply because the advantage of switching governments effortlessly is too great early in the game for other Human Civs to overcome. those were lost in the shuffle to get the game released by a certain date. the patch and figure out the network quirks, you'll probably be playing CivNet more against the computer civilizations than versus those of your friends.

For example, a number of games assume that your sound card will beat RO 9 or lower. The laziness of game programmers is partly to blame, but that laziness is reinforced by the de facto SOUND BLASTER standard, which normally uses cither IRQ 5 or IRQ 7(with IRQ 9 relegated to MIDI music synthesis). This caused great headaches for cards such as the GRAVIS ULTRASOUND series, which would default to IRQ II. everal issues that I don't have to know anything about ago, I confrontmy system, right?

The sound MARCH 1996 CG "


"LOYD CASE TECHNOLOGY as you remain in Windows 95 or some other PnP-awarc operating system and only run Windows applications. The hitches are those pesky older DOS games that we all love to play. There is a solution, however. It's called the \"ISA configuration utility\" or ICU for short. 60 card autodetect fails. You manually set every IRQ you can think of, but still no sound. Scratching your head, you start up Windows 95 again, bring up the device manager and discover that your new PnP audio card is set to IRQ 15. Huh? You try to change it, only to get the message: \"this parameter camot be changed.\" You contemplate grabbing a shotgun and ending your computer's life on the spot. This actually happened to me. During the process of getting the PnP AWE-32 to work, 1 uncovered a number of interesting facts: First, if you have a PnP BIOS in your computer-most newer PCI motherboards, 486 and Pentiums, dothen you need to root around in your BIOS setup program. Usually, and I emphasize the word «usually,\" you can uncover a section of the BIOS setup program that allows you to manually configure which IRQs are allotted to PnP and which you can still manually control. If you're clever about it, you can assign only interrupts which are accessible by all games to PnP. Piece of cake, right? Okay, now what happens when you have two or even three PnP carols? Some BIOSes allow you to allocate specific IRQs to specific slots. Then you can count the slots and plug the PnP card into the right slot. Of course, there are SOM BIOSes that give you little or no manual control over the IRQ. 1 Hey, I thought this was supposed to be easier, I hear you cry... The hitches are those pesky older DOS games that we all love to play. It works pretty well, too. The Cateway P133XL system we looked at in the January issue came bundled with a PnP Ensoniq SOUNDSCAPE card. The P133XL came with the device driver installed in the Windows 95 boot setup, so when we went to the DOS prompt, we had no problems numing DOS games, especially those games that directly supported the SOUNDSCAPE board. The ICU is the only solution, by the way, for those older computers which do not have a PnP BIOS. You can obtain Intel's ICU on their BBS at (503) 2647999. For added flexibility, some card makers allow you to disable PnP and retain manual control of the card settings from the beginning. Two interesting examples are the U.S. Robotics SPORTSTER 28.8 KB PnP modem and the 3COM 3C509B network card. The SPORTSTER modem actually has a jumper that enables or disables PnP (PnP is enabled by default.) The 3C509B ethernet card has a software installation program that lets you enable or disablc PnP. Those of you have used systems with EISA (cxtended ISA) architecture systems will immediately recognize the ICU. It's a program that you run that allows you to manually configure your system. You can assign resources to individual slots and cards, tell the system what's in each slot, and so on. These programs are usually casier to use than the more arcane sclup programs that configure BIOS settings. There is a minor catch: you have to load a device driver in order to use these manually assigned Pul settings. The good news is that the driver only takes up 2 KB of RAM. TOMORROW AND TOMORROW... Eventually, software will catch up with the new hardware. Eventually, we'll all be running Windows 95 on our Pentium Pro Plus 900 MHz systems in dazzling, highresolution true color with Dolby THX quality sound. Eventually. Until all the software catches up, however, it's wise to arm yourself with a little knowledge, so that when you try to run the original version of Doom on your pure PnP system, you can get it to work, out of the box. Now that's plug-and-play. ICU WILL SEE YOU THROUGH Hey, I thought this was supposed to be casier, I hear you cry. Actually, it is, as long If you've recently installed Windows 95, and it's behaving poorly-such as a low refresh rate and slow graphics performance-it's likely that Windows 95 only installed the 16-bit version of the graphics driver for your card. To install the 32-bit virtual device driver (known as a VxD), insert your Windows 95 CD. Then go to your desktop, click the right mouse button and bring up the display properties window. Click on the settings tab, press the \"Change\" button under \"Display Type\" and then click on have disk. Now browse the directory on the CD named \"drivers.\" Under drivers is another folder, \"display.\" Find your vendor name and see if the driver will load. (Note: the Matrox drivers are for the older MGA line, not the Millenium.) If the driver doesn't load, or you don't see your board's driver on the Win95 install CD, visit your vendor's BBS or Web page to see if they have an updated driver available. I'll be talking more in a future column about getting the right graphics driver to max out your Windows 95 performance.-L. Case MARCH 1996 "

"SURVEY  SPEAKERS 19 010 NH231 Stick It In Your Ear If You're Still Using Those Featherweight Freebies That Came With Your Computer, You Should Hear What You've Been Missing By Ron Talbot AEROSPACE still remember the first time experienced sound while playing a computer game. I had been steadfastly refusing to add a sound card to my then-hulking 386-20. It was primarily a game rig and I was feeling guilty about the amount of money I was spending on it. I was a hard-core RPG gamer at the time and I viewed sound as an expensive luxury. A friend had to practically tie me in a chair to force me to listen to that first Ad Lib card. By clawn the next morning I was hooked. Cames like RED BARON, WING COMMANDER and even the SSI gold box games come alive with the simple acklition of audio. Once you can both see and hear the action in a game, it becomes ever so casy to completely lose yourself in it. That wonderful state of total absorption, rill state of total absorption, the coldrums of reality forgotten, lures us back over and over again. Good sound adels enormously to the overall enjoyment of any game. Why spend thousands of dollars on a fast processor, tons of memory, and a monitor fit for a football stadium, only to add $20 tin can speakers as an afterthought? A good game rig is a pretty hefty investment, but a good set of speakers might well be the key ingredient to enriching your gaming pleasure. In this survey, we'll take a look at six speaker systems currently on the market, and I'll give you some pointers on how to choose a system that's right for you. TWO FROGS AND A SIX-PACK Why Can't I Use My Stereo System? ou might be asking yourself just how do these speaker systems stand up to your typical home stereo system. Why can't I just run a cable to my amp and save myself a fistful of dollars? Good question. Actually, this is how I have functioned for the past six years. I have an average quality amp and pretty good speakers. As I evaluated the featured units, also evaluated my stereo system, and it did very well in all areas except depth, owing to a lack of surround technology. The table in this article shows how it fared relative to these other systems. Basically, if you have a reasonable or better stereo system close to your computer you might as well use it unless you want to harness some of the newer \"3-D\" technologies. But if you've decided that you want a dedicated audio system for your gaming machine, then figure out first how much you're willing to pay for good gaming audio, check out the reviews below, and use the guidelines to also evaluate the wide range of multimedia speakers out there. THE GAME'S THE THING! I'm not an audiophile, I'm a gamer. So rather than delve into a ton of technominutiae about frequency response and harmonic distortion, I'm going to focus on how these systems sounded cranking out some gaming audio 'To that end, I listened to each of these speaker systems while playing MECH WARRIOR 2 and WING COMMANDER III. My game rig has a SoundBlaster 16 with an Audiowave Dreamwave MIDI daughterboard. To round out my evaluation, I also listened to them playing CD-audio-lased vocal and instrumental music tracks to see how they farcd. AEROSPACE SPEAKERS AND SUBWOOFER They're cute, they should be green, and they hiss like a snake. This system consists of two small streamlined speakers hooked in-line to a sub-woofer. The speakers are controlled by a cable remote for both power and volume. The sub-woofer has power and volume controls mounted on the front panel as well as an overall volume control for the entire system. The speakers connect with a hard-wired cable, making replacement and positioning difficult. Since these two products are bought separately, you are burdened with two power bricks, those large, heavy power supplies that irritatingly cover two or more outlets. The Acrospace system provides reasonable quality gaming sound, with especially high marks for the beefy sub-woofer. The MARCH 1996 "

This is the system of choice for those of you who are \"spacechallenged.\" There's good cabling and craftsmanship with a minor glitch: the volume control is on the cable between the computer and the sub-woofer (by necessily). Unfortunately, this cable is not long enough to reach desk level i both the CPU and sub-woofer are on the floor. Strangely enough, SoundWorks gives good blood-stirring game sound, but seemed flat and muddy when tested with CD-audio music. A solid choice for your game rig, especially if you're in cramped quarters controls. The craftsmanship was average and cabling was definitely sub-standard with thin, hard-wired speaker wires. The sound was unremarkable until you tumed on the Spatializer. The depth of sound provided by this feature is noticeable.

"REVIEW . 3D BLASTER 19010NH)31 Unexciting Acceleration Creative Labs' 3D Blaster Accelerates Some Games On A 486, But Don't Expect Miracles by Loyd Case Iwi The Tour de A RAN LIMATE CRB CREATIVE 996 should be the year that 3-D accelerators hit the streets in force. Finally, the industry seems to be settling on two or three realtime, 3-D Application Programming Interface (API) standards, allowing programmers to write 3-D games to an API rather than to the registers of every 3-D chip out there. And the price points look about right, too, with $200-$300 being the target for 3-D accelerators with 2 MB of RAM. Creative Labs is one of the first companies to release a 3-D accelerator, the 3D BLASTER, which began shipping late last year. Based on a cost-reduced version of 3D LABS CLINT chipset, the 3D BLASTER is only available for VESA local bus (VLB for short). The idea is to give all those 486s out there an end-of-life perfor mance kicker. I lowever, the swift move to aggressively-priced Pentium PCI systems has apparently caught many people by surprise, including the folks at Creative. The 3D BLASTER has both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 drivers, and will support Microsofts Direct3D API when it comes out later this year. The marketing mavens at Creative state that when running games written to 3D BLASTER'S Creative Graphics Library API, the CLINT engine's performance is equivalent to a software-only 3-D rendering engine running on a Pentium. Is it that good? Not really. Maybe the marketing folks at Creative only have 60 MHz Pentiums. The card is very easy to set up; after ripping the lid off your system. you find an available VLB slot and insert the card. Creative decided to use a VGA BLASTER pass-through, rather than trying to use the infamous VGA feature connector, a smart decision on their part. To use it, you need to run a cable (provided in BLASTER PACK The 3D BLASTER comes with NASCAR the box) from your VGA RACING, MAGIC CARPET PLUS, FLIGHT UNLIMITED and HI-OCTANE, adapter to the 3D but it won't turn your 486 into a Pentium 133.

Limit the options of the real werewolf and back him into the furnace room. lagged. Von Zell isn't around, so this is the right time to snoop in his room (check Preiss' room). Then you can visit the cave again (you did find it carlier, yes?) and confirm your suspicions, rather unpleasantly. There's one rather obvious person you can talk to about this, so do that..and then it's time for the midnight werewolf hunt. You have to drive it to the ravine. Only the Ritter talisman works here, so be ready with that as you make your way through the woods. You'll probably die once or twice during the attempt, but if you're careful, it shouldn't take you too long to do this. Chapter 6. The most involved. Here you will rum both Gabe and Grace at different times, starting with Grace in Rittersberg, Our boy is there, too, in the dungeon. The only safe place, in case he turns into a werewolf (midnight hunts are not without their drawbacks). The first part of this chapter has Grace retrieving the parts of the lost Wagner opera. Three arc in Neuschwanstein, and one in Altotting, as you know from the opening movie. Do check around town before leaving, though, and don't forget the birdie. At Neuschwanstein, the first opera soction can be obtained by using something from Altotting (such vandalism!). The second section requires only patience, and the third can be gotten with, so to speak, a flight of fancy in the side hall. The penitent offerings at Altoiting probably reminded you of something, but you'll need permission first. Then you can go there with your own offering. Before doing anything with it, check out the chapel first. What happens after the heart is donated is a hint on what Grace needs to do, and after that, we segue to opening night of the opera. Grace has a lot to do here, too. Walking around and becoming familiar with the opera house helps. There are some things in the office she needs. Gabe is there, too (not in great shape). We'll be getting to him later on. In the meantime, visit the cellar (you may want to map this) to find the prop room (important place). Look in backstage (important item liere). Talk to everyone you can. Examine items in the inventory, and find the spotlight room. You also must make sure that the two special guests for this evening are scated in the right place. When all is done, the usher will alert Grace that there're only five minutes to opening the doors. Time to bring Gabe downstairs and dress for the performance. After the chat with Leber, it's wise to ensure the quarry is in place, and then also ensure that he can't get out with that done, we switch to Cabe in the prop room. As you might expect, he has to get out of there. Not too hard, if you look around carefully in back and click here and there. Backstage, he has to pick up some thing, from about the same place Grace did. This item is not easy to see, so move the cursor slowly to the right. Then into the dressing room he goes. Yep. Cabe is gonna perform in the opera (just as well it's a non-singing part!). Uh oh, someone's coming. Belter not let him see you; let's cloud things up a bit and get out of sight. Then that backstage item will come in real handy. This moves us into the opera itself. Just sit there and enjoy the performance, because when it cnds, the wolf hunt begins. Cabe and his quarry will be in the basement, both as wolves. The goal is to drive the other werewolf into the furnace room, by shutting the room doors in the correct way. This is the only solution; if Gabe fights woll-to-wolf, he will die. If the other werewolf gets away, Cabe also dies. So it's the furnace room or nothing. The immediate task is to close the doors on the left side, blocking access to the casy exits. Then it becomes harder, as you have to shut the doors so as to make a single path to the furnace room, without leaving the quarry an exit, or forcing him into a dead end. Remember, once a door is shut, it can't be opened again. In the furnace room is Herr Leber and G race. You can switch between Grace and Gabe here, and that is necessary Something must be done and only Grace can do that. But only Cabe can take the action that will kill the Black Wolf. Time it carefully Whew! That should be enough of wolves, Wagner, and Ludwig II to last us all a long, long time. And we're just about out of time here, as I see by the invisible clock on the wall.

"SNEAK PREVIEW THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE ADVENTURE/RPG Murphy Strikes Again Film Noir Meets B-Movie Sci-Fi In This UNDER A KILLING Moon Sequel by Denny Atkin CSNEAK GPREVIEW GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT Is been 100 years since The Maltese Falcon, but nobody told Tex Murphy. Never seen without his fedora, trenchcoat, and pack of Lucky Strikes, Murphy's a detective who fancies himself a Plin the mold of Spade or Marlowe. With his non-stop wiscguy banter and lucked-into-it problem-solving, though, he comes across more like Jim Carrey on downers.

"SNEAK PREVIEW THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE ADVENTURE/RPG tasked with translating alien runes. With the NSA on his tail, he'd sent out a series of puzzle boxes to trusted fricnds and relatives, boxes that would have to be pieced together to solve this mystery of cosmic proportions. It was up to Murphy to find out why so many people were willing to kill for the secret contained in these Pandora boxes. like he'd just gone for a ride on a beautiful weather balloon. The search started in familiar territory Turns out Malloy had been a resident in the lex's own building, the inappropriately named Ritz. It looked like piccing this case together was going to make anyone who followed Murphy around on the KILLING MOON adventure feel right at home-the initial investigation, at least, was going to involve talking to the locals on Chandler Avenue, trying to find people who'd seen Malloy, knew where he'd gone and what he was up to. 'That involved talking to a lot of familiar faces: Chelsee at the newsstand, Rook at the pawn shop, Clint the one-cycd chocoholic, and old dependable Louic at the Brew & Stew. guiding him through conversations by choosing a tone of response from three possibilities. While the perspective shift was jarring, at least the acting wasn't. Kevin McCarthy and Northem Exposure's Barry Corbin seemed to be taking their acting jobs seriously, a welcome improvement over the campy Russell Means and bizarre Margot Kidder performances in KILLING MOON. Tanya Roberts also turned in a good performance, albiet looking more a Joan Collins cloppleganger than a former Charlie's Angel or Bond girl here. Some of the acting improvement may have been attributable to the direction of Adrian Carr. Although his more impressive film credits involve editing rather than direction (his directing credits include the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series), he did pull a better performance from the actors involved than in the preceding cyberflick. In KILLING MOON, designer Chris Jones put in an awkward performance as Murphy. This time, the performance was fine, with only a good percentage of his jokes eliciting groans. THE STUFF THAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF followed Murphy through to the conclusion, but I wouldn't want to spoil the fun by spilling the beans. Turns out there were at least three paths to take, leading to six possible endings, Nice-a detective story you coull relive without knowing what was going to happen on the second pass. Even Hammelt and Chandler couldn't pull that one off. The first half of the mystery took place in territory familiar to anyone who played KILLING MOON:a post-WW III San Francisco neighborhood populated by a mix of humans and mutants. Despite the familiar cligs, though, the neighborhood seemed nicer. 'Turns out the tech boys at Access had ficlelled with the code and cleaned things up quite a bit. Objects in rooms no longer turned to face you as you moved through rooms, as if drawn to your magnetic personality. More fine-tuning was evident in that many objects kept their detail even when viewed up close, instead of blurring away like the room tends to do after a long visit with detective Jim Beam. The comfort of familiar surroundings faded soon enough, though, as I joumeyed with Murphy to Roswell, a secret installation, and an Aztec labyrinth puzzling enough to give Indiana Jones himself a headache. All told, there were over 70 virtual rooms to explore, beautifully rendered in crisp SVGA with a dark, film noir look. Of course, finding objects and solving puzzles is only part of a Prsjob. Digging for info is another. Interacting with the various dramatis personae once again involved a jarring shift from the first person to the third -instead of exploring rooms through Murphy's eyes, I was watching him from across the room and STAR POWER Northern Exposure's Barry Corbin strikes a threatening pose, while Tanya Roberts steps up from Sheena and Beastmaster Unfortunately, when 'lex Murphy puts two and two together, the result is often a lot bigger than four. As he worked to track down Malloy, he also got involved with tracking down death threats against a curvaceous exotic dancer, and evading National Security Agency operatives who'd taken an unhcalthy interest in his investigation --unhealthy to Tex, that is who was close to joining the collection of dead bodies that was piling up faster than pancakes at the IHOP Then, there was the Roswell comection. Malloy, it appeared, was a linguist, THE LONG GOODBYE Satisfied with my investigation, I cropped the discs on Coleman's desk. \"Looks like another Access winner,\" I told him. \"The engine's the same, and the scenerys familiar, but the new story should keep gamers happy.\" I told him about the online hint section that woull trade solutions for points, and the new play level for experienced gamers that cloesn't offer hints, but doubles the point possibilities and offers a unique reward at the end of the game.\" \"There's even a novelization available from Prima,\" I added. \"It's an amusing-if awkward--read. You don't often find the protagonist looking for objects in adventure-game style in most books, and there are so many positive cigarette references you'd think the guy was on the take from R.J. Reynolds. Still, it's a good guide if you get stuck in the plot.\" Another case closed. I deserved a break. Down to John's Grill for a cup of joc? Nah, I decided to grab my clubs and hit the links.

"REVIEW DRUID: DAEMONS OF THE MIND DIFFICULTY LEVEL ADVENTURE/RPG Sir-Tech's Step Child DRUID Fails To Live Up To Its Forebears by Petra Schlunk all it a blessing or a curse, but every new role-playing and adventure game from Sir-Tech will inevitably be compared with their successful Wizardry series. As an adventure game with minor role-playing clements, DRUID:DAEMONS OF THE MIND might get a double helping of \"Does it measure up?\" from Sir-Tech fans. As \"The Man With No Name,\" you play an unnamed cruid brought to the world of Navan by three other druids to assist them in finding their missing brother. Each druid rules an island, which you must visit in your quest to find clues about the disappearance. LOST IN SPACE: DRUID's elegantly retro \"Flash Gordon\" spacecraft adds a little variety to the typical old-world adventure theme. GIRTECH them, although you can't order him to fight a friendly or harmless character. You can read conversations at your leisure by clicking the text on the screen with highlighted hypertext keywords providing additional information. Conversations rarely involve game-affecting choices and are primarily a means of learning new information. Price: $59.95 System Requirements: 486DX/33 or better (486DX2/66 or better recommended). 4 MB RAM (8MB recommended), SVGA graphics, 12 MB hard drive space, 2 x CD-ROM (4X recommended), mouse: most sound cards supported (16-bit sound card recommended). Protection: None (CD must be in drive) Designer: Matt Stott (lead designer) Publisher: Sir-Tech Software Ogdensburg, NY (800) 447-1230 Reader Service #: 327 THE DIRECT APPROACH Essentially, gameplay in Druid follows a linear course. You begin the game without options for No Name's character or control over his statistics. He will acquire experience points, gain levels, improve his health (body points), and magic power (mind points) as he progresses through the game. You start out on an island called the Common Ground, which accommodates a jail, an arena for building up No Name's physical statistics, a library, a site containing Stonchenge-like megaliths, and a temporarily restricted area. He will spend some time here studying, improving his abilities, and gathering information before travelling to the next island. You must solve most of the puzzles on cach island before No Name can acquire the \"Ogham\" keystones he needs to con tinue his journey. These rune-inscribed stones fit into the megaliths found on each island. He can't continue his journey until he prove until he properly totales each stone to match the correct symbol in these cruidic structures. You view No Name's progress from a three-quarter overhead perspective as he travels from arca to arca looking for items to use, people to meet, and creatures to fight. DRUID sports a nicely designed mouse-driven interface, which features an arrow-straped cursor.

Monsters hit fast and hard; once they start hurting No Name, it's all over. Be Salvaging Combat In Druid wamed that you will lose some battles, primarily because there is another way to get past these particular opponents. If you have problems with the combat system, you may find DRUID's magic system more useful than I did. Spells come in handy for healing No Name before battle and for \"softening cup his targets before he attacks them. Creatures will not attack you until you step into their \"space,\" so you can lob spells at them to your heart's content. No Name should cast more spells if he has trouble with with a particular opponent. You can either find spells in the manual, or in looks and tapestries throughout the game. Elements (water, air, fire, and cartl) make up of a majority of the spells. The magic system is simple and intuitive; right-clicking will bring up No Name's magic amulet, featuring four gems to cast element-based spells as well as a central gem for «mind power\" spells. Clicking on the elements and the mind gem in the correct order will invoke a spell, which then can then be targeted appropriately. Although combat and magic make up substantial gameplay, DRUID's substance lies in the the puzzles and storyline. The plot is by no means lucid, but a strong current of intrigue running through the storyline warrants continued play. DRUID'S puzzles involve finding objects, using them sensibly, and giving them to interested parties. Unlike many adventure games, puzzles actually contribute to the plot and DON'T BLINK; YOU MIGHT MISS IT Like some of Sir-Tech's Wizardry games, DRUID offers multiple endings lepending on choices you make late in the game. Unfortunately, these endings are all disappointingly short and uninteresting. In fact, the whole game is on the short side, something that even a nice storyline and lovely graphics can't redeem. If you pick up DRUID because you are looking for a challenging role-playing game on par with the venerable WIZARDRY and REALMS OF ARKANIA games, you will be disappointed. DRUID IS short, pretty, and moderately challenging, but uninspiring combat sequences and the disappointing sound offset an otherwise great interface. ithout knowledge of the right moves, realtime combat in DRUID can drive even the most tenacious gamer crazy. Here are some combat tips to keep your druid fighting strong Always save before you fight! The more experience your druid has, the better. For practice, take advantage of one of the few places in the game where monsters regenerate: on the road to the Archives. After killing the monster guarding this road, leave the area and return to fight it again. You can keep this up until you are satisfied (or until you get bored silly). Whoever lands the first hit during hand-to-hand combat will most likely win the battle. A successful hit makes the target lose their balance and delays retaliation. Repeated hits will keep your opponent off balance and protect No Name from most attacks. To ensure the first hit is landed by No Name, click directly on your opponent (to walk up to him) and keep clicking as fast as you can to keep hitting him. The best places to hit your opponent are usually on the front of the legs. However, some battles will require experimentation to determine which mouse-click will connect with the monster. The right place to direct your hits depends on the direction the monster is facing and whether it is standing on an incline or on level ground. Improve your odds by keeping No Name fully healed and with enough mind points to fight properly. Cast some destructive spells on your foe before closing in for the kill. Remember that there are a few opponents whom you cannot kill including the jailer and some of the guards in the restricted area, do not waste your time fighting them. APPEAL: Those intimidated by the richer environment of WIZARDRY and REALMS OF ARKANIA may find this easier to get into (and out of). >PROS: Simple, intuitive magic system; decent storyline with numerous, plot-driven puzzles, multiple endings. CONS: Painful pixel-hunting required to find many of the game's objects, plus an execrable combat system sap the energy from the story. Having only three save game spots is also a detriment.

After all, the crimes sure sell digital papers, don't they? It becomes obvious that Quinlan must find out the identity of the RIPPER himself and stop the evil.

"requirements of the video medium requires time to feel comfortable. \"We learned with previous titles that live actors take much more care. You can have these huge blocks of dialog that look fine in a text game, but if an actor tries to say them they just don't work. With FMV in RIPPER it was even more pronounced. A lot of the information gets conveyed by looks and acting talent as opposed to the actual spoken lines,\" says Ryan Brant, Take 2's CEO. The team also worked to integrate elements of the actual historical RIPPER crimes into their cyberpunk recreation. For instance, the real Jack sent letters to newspapers boasting of his crimes, and the Ripper does the same in the game. \"He would start every letter with \"from Hell» and would refer to the newspaper columnist as \"boss\". We used Take 2 needed to utilize a nonlinear plot in the game. While linear plots make a game easier to write, they detract from the gaming experience because characters cannot wander freely and act spontaneously. But the problem is that events must occur in some order. When scripting a scene for actors, you must know what has happened up to that point. To solve the problem, Take 2 broke the game down into acts. Each act contains a number of puzzles that the player can solve in a varying order. But the players must solve the puzzles in order to proceed to the next act. With the matter of linearity solved, the designers still had a tough road ahead of them. While the veterans in Take 2 have designed numerous interactive games, working with live actors and the three months designing RIPPER. Next, the video was shot, and the programming team integrated the video with the game engine they had been developing \"We spent a lot of time figuring out how people really move calculating how many frames of video actually equaled a distance walked in the real world and using a formula to integrate that into our engine. That way, the movement looked like it does in the real world,\" says Chris Short, RIPPER's Production Manager. The production team also closely examined the mechanics of human movement to see how a person's eyes and head track. Then they built this into their engine so that when a person turns a corner, for example, the camera angle changes to simulate the way people move their head and eyes in that situation, A great deal of attention focused on ensuring that slower Evil By Design: THE DESIGII AND PRODUction of RPPER Ambition was a key word from the begining of the RIPPER design process. \"What we wanted to do was to make a full motion interactive game with a real plot. We wanted to achieve a game with the depth of a novel. A game for thinking adults,\" says F.J. Lennon, Vice President of Development. However, to achieve this goal took much more work than expected. \"For sheer star quality, it's hard to surpass RIPPER from Take2..\" Computer Gaming World these elements in our letters,\" says Lennon. The writing and programming team spent computers can still get the full effect of RIPPER \"We designed an approximation curve "


"\"RIPPER will not be another one of those dreary interactive movies that turn out to be as interactive as a tumble dryer.\" Computer Player for the video speed of the machine to run smoothly on a 486-50 with a double speed CD-ROM instead of just on Pentium systems,\" Short explains. These touches give RIPPER incredibly smooth and realistic movement that no other FMV game has ever had. «It has taken a lot of work,\" says Take 2 President Mark Seremet. «But when your goal is to redefine the level of the interactive game, you know it isn't going to be easy.\" Senior Artist. While the shooting was expensive and grueling for the Take 2 team, it no doubt produced the excellent results they expected: the finished footage for the game is comparable to a movie or high quality television show. It might be hard to get a game that has the impact of a feature film, but Take 2 is certainly giving it a shot. Suoosing the Town THE MAKING OF RIPPERS VIDEO SEGMENTS actors appear as live video, but everything else in a scene is the computer overlay. While this might seem more difficult for the talent, Walken and his fellow actors maintain that the differences are fairly small. The Take 2 staff, however, endured a greuling work schedule. \"When you only have some of the big name actors for a couple of days, each day can run up to 20 hours. It's grueling,\" says Mike Snyder, one of Take 2's Senior Artists. Although this is their first complete full motion shoot, Take 2 paid to ensure it was done right. \"These guys know what they are doing. We didn't want to go the route we have seen in some other games where the designers tried to run everything themselves. It is worth it to pay the money to get the professionals. These people know what it takes to produce perfect results,\" says President Mark Seremet. Working with professionals does have another up sidegetting to meet and work with big name stars. \"Walken was incredible. The man can act anything. Because of a short prep time, he was reading his lines off a Teleprompter and it sounded like he lived the part,\" says John Antinori, one of Take 2's Senior Writers. \"And David Patrick Kelly. The guy is just as intense in real life as he is acting. In between shots he would walk in these tight circles in the back corner, muttering to himself, to keep his intensity up. Of course, I was kind of afraid to go near him,\" Lennon laughs. «Burgess Meredith was also great. The guy is 70something, still out there shooting for 12 hours, the longest he worked at a stretch since «Rocky\", but he kept in there,\" says Jack Snyder, In contrast to a traditional stage with props and backdrops, the RIPPER set is totally barren. A bank of powerful workstations sit along one wall manned by Take 2 artists. This combination of human talent and computer power produces all the backgrounds and settings for each scene on the fly. Here's how: The walls of the set are painted a special pigment, called Chroma Blue. The color is then coded into the specialized software and hardware, anywhere the computers find that color in a video stream, they replace it with computer graphics.

However, you now explore the house through the eyes of a grown man, well over six feet tall. Besides an additional secret room, and the removal of the top floor from 7111 GUEST's explosive climax, Stauf mansion's floor plan remains the same. As in 7111 GUEST, you must solve puzzles to unlock and explore the various rooms. But now, the rooms contain dozens of beautifully rendered objects and paintings instead of bare walls.

CONGO ADVENTURE/RPG Travicom packed into my workstation-a radiation scanner, a photo-culancer, a cool mapping and tracking system came into play, I got into the spirit of the thing, studying the fictitious workstation interface as intently as if thereafter I'd be working on the thing from nine to five c very day. But my willing suspension of disbelief game, there is no question that your adrenaline will be flowing. As our gicllier film critics like to say, CONGO is a rollercoaster ride. I'll even escalate the praise: it's one hell of a good-looking roller-coaster ride. But we've all ridden this ride before and know its clips and turns too well. It's hard to get too excited about what's basically a fresh coat of paint. >>>> continued from page 130 though a maze is, alas, part of the pack age). Didn't you have to find your way across a gorge at the start of Sierra's seminal WIZARD AND THE PRINCESS? Didn't you have to raft a river in Infocom's ZORK 1? Well, here you'll have to do it again. Cranted, the text-only rafting in ZORK lacked the in-your-face frisson of CONGO's virtual reality-style goggle clisplay, which lets you see the oncoming rapids, the rocks that will capsize you if you're not careful, and all the plants whipping by your face. WIZARD AND THE PRINCESS offered line drawings where CONCO offers a realistic stone-and-soil chasm. I admit that I found myself so caught up in the environment that I didn't even mind the typically awkward movement scheme. (You click left and right to tum in place, then forvard to walk.

"JEFF JAMES ACTION action like Coming of Age The Why And The How Of The PC Market's Arcade Action Explosion \" el Ol 1 Action f you're an avid fan of arcade games, you've undoubtedly noticed that the PC gaming market is often found lacking when it comes to traditional action-arcade games. Aside from the notable exception of Doom and its ubiquitous entourage of \"me-too!\" clones, action gaming on the PC has been forced to take a back seat to other game genres. Flight sims, strategy games and wargames consistently grab the headlines and gamer the most coverage. But while PCs may indeed rule the roost when it comes to these genres, coinoperated arcade machines and next gencration game consoles reign supreme when it comes to action in the tradition of STREET FIGHTER, VIRTUA RACING and MORTAL KOMBAT. Sega's coin-op VIRTUA FICHTER 2 soundly pummels the PC versions of FX FICHIER and SAVAGE WARRIORS, while arcade-to-PC conversions of MORTAL KOMBAT 3 and PRIMAL RAGE come up short when compared to their Sony PlayStation counterparts. Fortunately, this sorry state of PC action gaming is about to change in a big way. Over the next year or so, PC owners will witness a flood of arcadlo-quality fighting games, shoot-em-ups and platform games to rival the best offerings at the arcade or on competing console machines. If you're the type of gamer who longs for quality PC conversions of games like TEKKEN and VIRTUA FICHTER, you won't have to wait much longer. Cartridge game developers see the recent surge in PC gaming through greenbackcolored glasses, and coin-op manufacture rs are beginning to realize that the PC market holds a large number of gamehungry action fans. There are a number of reasons behind the impending boom in action gaming, but four central issues seem to be driving growth: the increasing size of the PC gaming market; the arrival of a game friendly operating system in Windows 95; the ascendancy of CD-ROM as the primary means of distribution; and the advent of accelerated 3-D graphics cards for the PC. being an \"also ran\" when compared to the massive cartridge market are long over. The PC market is bursting at the seams, with thousands of new computer gamers being added to the fold weekly. According to data collected by the Software Publisher's Association (http://www.spa. org) sales of PC entertainment software have been absolutely booming over the past 12 months, making the market simply too lucrative for cartridge game developers to overlook. gamers need no longer feel like the forgotten orphans of the computer gaming industry. BIGGER IS BETTER The days of the PC gaming market INSIDE ACTION In addition to adding Crystal Dynamix' Gex to their gaming stable, Microsoft has joined forces with a number of other noteworthy action game developers. Terminal Reality (developer of FURY3 and TERMINAL VELOCITY) and Rainbow America (The Hive) have also signed agreements with Microsoft to produce games for Windows 95. Sega's newly formed SegaPC division is gearing up to port several popular Genesis and Saturn games to the PC during 1996. Look for PANZER DRAGOON first, followed by an impressive list of high-powered ports from the Sega Saturn. Need game cheats? If you do, your next stop on the Internet should be the Games Cheats & Info List, written by Lam Chifung (cflam@hk.super.net). This is a huge list of game cheats and hints, filled with all sorts of WINDOWS 95 = GAMES! Love it or hate it, Windows 95 is selling like suntan lotion at a nudist colony. It may be less than the perfect operating system for gaming, but it is still a colossal step in the right direction. And the powerful tools included in the Windows 95 Came Software Development Kit (SDK) make games casier to develop and support, reducing the conversion costs of porting arcade and console games to the PC. The first Windows 95-specific game releases may have been a bit lackluster, but rest assured bigger and better games are in the wings. Naysayers can grump about Win 95 all they want, but it won't change the fact that the game industry is going for Bill's baby in a big way. MARCH 1996 CG "

"DISASTEROID: Loves to kick asteroid. Whenever Gearheads battie, Disasteroid is always laser hot. So, if you need someone to hack holes in your opponent's defenses, Disasteroid's the guy. For me, though, the biggest flaw of this game was its utter failure to live up to the style it had chosen: the adventures of a comic book hero. Both thematically and technically, there is little here to make me feel like a superhero. The first bad move was giving the player a whole arscnal of weapons to use. Any goon can fire a plasma rifle, but when was the last time you saw Batman packing heat? While it might be a philosophical clebate whcther this game is about simply slaughtering to survive instead of \"heroism,\" the \"super\" part of the concept is undeniably weak. Bradley has created a set of superpowers that come off like spells, and while absorbing the essence of the dead is an interesting, albeit dark twist, I never felt as if I was doing anything except gathering dungeon-hack mana for my own benefit. Sure, I dcfcated the bad guy, but since he was after me first, it was harclly a heroic act. Even the sets themselves undermine the whole comic book premise. The whole lure of having super-powers is the fantasy of absolute control of your enviromment; tossing cars, bowling troops over with a lightpost, smashing through walls. But the poor nihilistic CYBERMACE can't even knock a tree out of his way or set upholstery on fire. The slattering stained glass of HEXEN conveys a better sense of power than anything I encoumtered in this game. CYBERMACE is an excellent singleplayer, first-person shooter, on a par with DARK FORCES. The storyline takes cnough twists to make you forget the clichée setup. On the other hand, if you truly want to know if you have what it takes to be a superhero?\" you won't be finding any answers here. gearheads a furious war of wind-up toys PHILIPS 1996 Philips Media, Inc. Circle Reader Service #143 MOVING? APPEAL: For 3-D action fans, CYBERMAGE is a no-brainer. Comic book fans looking for some real superhero action might be a bit disappointed though.

I used the mouse to look down-almost straight down --and for a dizzying moment, an acidic knot formed in my stomach and the world seemed to tilt chaotically beneath me. It wasn't the motion sickness of which Doom players sometimes complain. It was simple fear of heights. Or, more to the point, it was fear of heights induced by a computer game. I've never felt anything like it before. Once again, for one blissful, sickening moment, I was there. You're not simply walking around the whole time, cither. That might get tiresome. In a handful of missions, you pilot either a captured Hunter/Killer aircraft or a jeep. The H/K sequences are 3-D shootem-ups rather cool to the touch, but the jeep sequences have a joyful rugged chaos all their own. You can drive like a lunatic, hoping to beat the odds with sheer speed, or progress in baby steps. shooting at every shadow. (It's especially fun to be able to fire in one direction while moving in another.) Mind, it's great, but it isn't perfect. FUTURE SHOCK is the first game that uses Bethesda's now \"Xngine\" 3-D game engine-DAGGERFALI, and XCAR were expected to follow it by a few months and the game has some bumpy spots. For instance, on those vehicle-based missions, you're chained to your seat until you reach your destination. I would have preferred a more open-ended approach to travel, a la CYBERMACE, that allowed the player to hop in and out of these craft at will as the situation required. (If anything, it would have added to strategy; you'd not only have to survive, but protect your ride as well.) \"The automap--effectively a textured version of the 3-D one used in DESCENT is more handsome than useful in this form. If you lose your bearings indoors, you may find you can't shrink the map enough for it to be a useful tool in finding your way out again. The outdoor helicopter-view snapshot of the immediate arca is of no practical use. entire convoy. Unfortunately, having alrcady blown the bridge, there was no way to go back and finish the job. Yikes. Once I figured that out, I restarted the scenario...and found that this time, I'd been provided with only one satchel charge instead of the two that were required. Yikes twice. Fortunately, I had one save from late in the previous mission, and when I played it through and moved on to the Ilth mission again, the game properly set me up with two satchel charges. But that was too close a call. Without that save, I'd have had to restart. But I kept going, and not just because I had to keep going to write this review. I loved FUTURE SHOCK dearly, for all its faults, and I'm genuinely sorry it's over. (I want data disks, and I want them now.) usually don't play a completed game a second time, but I'm looking forward to revisiting this one using Virtual IO's IClasses to peer over that hill into that bleak no man's land. It may take a while to find, but I'll know it when I see it. After all, I was there Flies In The Ointment UTURE SHOCK's engine, splendid as it may be, does misfire on occasion. Some examples: A distant object that you can see in dark silhouette on the periphery on your vision disappears entirely when you pivot and look straight at it. A clear visual line-of-sight between gun muzzle and intended target, and the ability to tag your target with the crosshairs, does not necessarily mean you can hit said target when firing at a downward angle from a raised area. (Your ammo may still detonate against the edge of that raised area.) Even with an unobstructed, horizontal LOS, you may miss an enemy entirely at reasonably close range, due to a lag in the screen update. This appears to be the result of a lag in the onscreen update of enemy positions; I was shooting where they weren't. In such cases, the game performs sudden position updates, and the enemy simply zaps to a new location nearby. Crashes to DOS often happen with several enemies on screen. This could be a conflict with some internal ceiling for simultaneous operations.  Graphical problems: robots sometimes poked parts of their bodies through intact walls, and could be killed through them. The ground graphics occasionally break up, as does the sound of any weapon. A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE And while Connor radios you to urge you on to your tasks, alas, he never tells you if you've blown a critical element of a mission say, by using a satchel charge in the wrong spot. That's a real problem. For example, the Ilth mission is a three-part affair: race through a section of city to destroy a convoy; blow the bridge it mcant to cross; and disable the factory to which it was headed. I knocked out the convoy (or so I thought), took down the bridge and the factory and waited for the mission to end. And waited. The mission didn't end. I finally realized that I hadn't destroyed the APPEAL: Anyone who enjoys Doom, but wants something new.

No, SCREAMER can't cut through steel cans as casily as it slices tomatoes. But it does have three special modes that offer several entertaining variations on the standard racing format.

Use this as a visual reference to your current lap time-if you trail the ghost car, you're seconds behind your best lap time, if you pass, you're on track to set a new course record. Unfortunately, you'll need at least 12 MB of RAM to enjoy this special option, since your previous lap (the ghost car) is stored in memory: Those with only 8 MB of RAM can still race, but won't see the ghost car. Another racing option, Cone Camage. prompts you to ram a series of cone barriers specially placed around the track. Each cone you hit adds another second to the checkpoint timer. The alternate version of this race, Slalom, demands that you do just the opposite. Instead of striking cones, you must maneuver between them to cam extra time.

"TERRY COLEMAN CLASSICS & PUZZLES Take The Last Trick QQP's legacy of winning card games deserves better than CARD PLAYERS PARADISE It's no we've all played silly little games like Solitaire on our computers, usually the incessantly repetitive version that comes with Windows. No game will ever match the tactile feel of flipping and shuffling cards (and for many users, this isn't a problem), but SOLITAIRE'S JOURNEY comes damned close to re-creating the experience, without wearing out your favorite poker deck. Over 100 different kinds of Solitaire, from mind-numbingly simplistic to agonizingly challenging, are combined with various \"quests\" to form the most unique slant of a classic game ever designed for the computer. Best of all, the game is readily avail able in bargain bins I've seen it for as little as ten bucks. Problem is, all of QOP's clever card games will soon find their way to discount heaven, as the company has been gutted, surviving in name only. For why, we can only speculate: perhaps the parent company, American Laser Games, simply decided to channel all of its resources into their line of games for girls, called HER INTERACTIVE. If so, the irony is that card games, especially good ones such as QOP designs, are among the games most played by females of all ages. All of which makes the release of QQP's newest card game package. CARD PLAYERS PARADISE, bittersweet. It's obvious from the spartan packaging that this was a low-budget project, which belies the modest advances in clocumentation and layout -there's even an index, almost unheard of from QQP. Moreover, while the explanations of rules have the seemingly inevitable QQP holes, the copious examples of play are lucid enough to help you learn the more exotic games included. It's no Card Player's Paradise with QQP gone from the industry. U ACE HIGH OR LOW? The real winner here is Rummy 500: casy to learn, hard to master, it brings back memories of endless Rummy games played on long winter nights Quick, natural and fluid, Rummy is quite good either versus the computer or via modem, and includes plenty of variants. Pinochle and Bezique (a forerunner of Pinochle) are just different enough that they test your ability to leam new bidding styles; players too accustomed to the comfortable parameters of Bridge will struggle. Casino is the weakest link of the four games, as it at first seemingly defies logic, then becomes too predictable as the pattern emerges. The graphics are actually a step back from the crispness of BRIDGE OLYMPIAD, despite the increased use of digitized screens featuring \"geographically educational\" card-playing locations from around the world--they struck me as little more than fancy clip art (and truth be told, I'd rather view lands in SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION). One welcome change in PARADISE is that while the Al still cheals, at least it isn't as brazen as in the higher levels of BRIDGE OLYMPIAD, which never missed an opportunity to snag your lone King. On the other hand, this game will never compete with really good AI, such as in the best Bridge and Chess games but then, where else can you go to play a good game of Rummy? As with BRIDGE OLYMPIAD, you get to compete in a World Tour\" with the best amateur and professional opponents the computer can throw at you.

Typical of QQP's \"campaign games,\" this is enjoyable at first. But after the first couple of times, it fades, unlike, say, the eminently replayable SOLTAIRE'S JOURNEY. Wly, for example, do you win lanterns to wander through a city maze, here every bit as infuriating as any needless maze from an adventure game? Wouldn't a simple Top 10 ranking or medal-winning system, as in BRIDGE OLYMPIAD, have worked bcller? In the end, CARD PLAYERS PARADISE is a microcosm for QQP:some annoying bugs. Typos and tepid layout make you think it was rushed through development: worse, the game, despite some fine moments (such as Rummy), really lacks that remarkable mix of play-balance and sheer joy of gaming which once defined OOP prodlucts. If this is the state to which Bruce Williams and Co. are to be reduced, perhaps it's better that they move on. If American Laser Games has any sense, they'll release an SVGA Windows 95 version of SOLITAIRE'S JOURNEY, and maybe include Bridge Olympiad and Rummy on the same CD. That would certainly be a more fitting legacy for QQP than CARD PLAYERS DESERT I mean PARADISE, of course. Mail order through: PC ZONE DAMARK MICROWAREHOUSE CREATIVE COMPUTERS Boy, are the computer opponents aggressive in CARD PLAYERS PARADISE! Playing it too close to the vest in Rummy can leave you behind in a hurry. But don't despair: just play more tricks as three and four-of-a kind, which will frustrate your silicon opponents-who prefer (like my late great-aunt Dora Mae) to play long \"melds\" of a series (2,3,4,5,6 of hearts, for example). As the Al gets closer to going out, it tends to discard high cards. Patience usually rewards you with a high spread of aces or face cards. An alternative method to winn ing in Rummy can be to simp ly hold cards, only placing them when you have two or three runs. The advantage is that your opponent has nothing to play off of, but if you get caught with all those cards!... | would use this strategy against a human only via modem, and only if I were way behind.

Being able to Play The Game is what it's all about, and here, finally, was a 189 WAGU BU he sight of a grown man crying ain't pretty Or even a grown-up little boy. But I confess to tears of joy when EA Sports' conversion of NBA LIVE '95 to the PC platform hit my hands last spring. For too many years, basketball games on the PC had been a vast wasteland. NBA LIVE 95 was the virtual promised land. Great graphics and a gameplay model that felt more like basketball than any game I've ever played made this title a numaway smash. Like the initial release (and sulosequent sequels) of its hockey counterpart, NHL HOCKEY, NBA LIVE had its fair share of problems -faulty Al and fairly useless basketball SHOTA game we could play. It should come as no surprise that even as NBA LIVE hit the best seller charts (phenomenal for a sports game), Electronic Arts was ABOVE THE RIM NBA Live '96 improves upon the high-flyin', in-your already drawface action of its predecessor. ing up a sequel. For fans of EA Sports games, this comes as the drawing board to ensure this even less of a surprise (how many years promising college football title, has John Madden been in evolution which will include most major now-four, live?). But this sequel is a far NCAA football programs, meets cry from your standard update the playits potential. ers' stats, and tweak the codle\" update.

"GEORGE JONES SPORTS SHOT HO others are more appropriate for reliving those high-flying, \"best-of\" moments. Besides looking good, one other bonus of the new camera angles is that, for the NBA LIVE veteran, it takes a little longer to master the action, increasing the lifespan of the game. Other graphical elements besides the On-court perspective have changed as well. Three different resolution modes (320 x 200, 640 x 320, 640 x 480) are included, although you'll need a Pentium for the highest resolution, which is gorgeous. As of the prerelease version we played, however, the players were surprisingly blocky in the more close-up views much more so than their HOCKEY COUNterparts. But their animations are amazing (not that they weren't amazing before). Tip-ins, spin dribbles and several other new moves will blow gamers away. 48.18 FLOOR GENERAL You can get as up close and personal to the action as you want, although the players' fine resolution suffers a bit as a result. perspective (not easily, though). You switch perspectives on the fly by hitting keys I through 5 atop your keyboard. To switch between Sky Cam I, II and III you hit \"2\" multiple times.

"GEORGE JONES SPROTS of the '95 version and have made this version even more intuitive, easy to use and fun. The gameplay is basically the same you control the man with the ball. One button passes, one button shoots, and the turbo button makes you go real fast. New features include Quick Plays, which allow you to call offensive and defensive plays on the fly, rather than waiting for a dead ball. You can even successfully call for intentional fouls now The Artificial Intelligence, one of NBA LIVE\"95's weakest spots, has also been improved significantly. End-of-game breakdowns, like cribbling the ball for a full 20 seconds before shooting when clown or taking lay-ups when down three, have been eliminated for the most part. And EA Sports is promising a much more challenging game of computer hoops. The game did scem harder than before, but its too carly to tell whether that's because of the new graphical engine or an improved AI. Gravis Grip support has been built in. This means that up to four players can play simultancously, cach with your own joystick, with the Gravis Grip module, Other enhancements include a new free throw model (the crowd comes into play), shot summary cliagrams, power chunks, the ability to create custom players and animated play diagrams, and the Vancouver and Toronto expansion teams. TIPS BACK TO BACK With NBA LIVE being the only game in town, it would have been entirely too casy for the folks at EA Sports to rest on their laurels, make a few minor tweaks to the game engine and call it a day. This aggressive pursuit of excellence is commendable, and illustrates why, when it comes to computer (and video) sports games, they're the last word.

All other trademarks and Circle Reader Service #240 UR '96 addresses this by decreasing your ability to switch quickly to a pass defender. Blocking schemes require less accuracy as well; your blitzer gets held up at the line more often, sometimes bouncing a few pixels right or left so the block holds, even though it looks absurd. The quarterback knows how to let the pass go just before the sack, too. In this case, less control makes the game more competitive. But the increased advantage given to offense makes playing defense a little less fun—and the scores a little higher than normal. If the computer team simply passed on every down, it would be hard to beat. It will, however, stick to the percentages in the playbook, and call some runs—even on third down in crucial situations. Then your blitzing safety wreaks havoc, because in UR '96 the secondary rules the roost. Defensive linemen tackle about as well as medicine balls—all they do is bounce off ball carriers. The linebackers are a little better, with the top ones as good as anyone. But the safeties and cornerbacks dominate. Not even O.J.'s lawyers could get you out of their grasp. Both you and the computer can take advantage of the \"Oomph\" button, a nifty new feature. Depending on how you set it, pressing this button causes the ball carrier to dive, spin or hurdle. This is a nice addition that creates some memorable replays.

"VISUALS Graphically, UR 696 gets mixed reviews. It provides a smooth, quality picture with generous and realistic looking players, with clearly visible uniform numbers. Unlike its predecessor, you can see tackles and certain types of movement. However, the frame rate is still pretty low. When a pass reaches a receiver, the ball simply disappears into the crowd.

An hour later (compared to FPSFP's weekend), we had the results. No surprises initially—Dallas dominated the league with a 15-1 record. San Francisco, meanwhile stumbled to a 12-4 finish. Detroit, on the other hand, finished a strong 133. Dark horse surprises were the Buccaneers at 11-5 and making the playoffs, and the Arizona Cardinals at 11-5. Green Bay, once again, didn't even make the playoffs. In the AFC, Kansas City strongarmed the league with a 13-3 record, while New England and Indianapolis posted 11-5 records. Steeler fans will be sorry to know that in the offensively-minded UR '96 league, their Pittsburgh team didn't even qualify for the post season. Once the playoffs started, however, conventional wisdom went out the door. Detroit coasted into the Super Bowl by beating San Francisco (48-15) and Dallas (3120). On the AFC side of the playoffs, it was all New England—they blew out Denver and squeaked by the heavily-favored Chiefs (13-12). The Super Bowl was a shoot-out. Both teams traded knockout punches for four quarters, but in the end Drew Bledsoe's (38-62, 402 yards, 4 TDs) 42 yard bomb to Vincent Brisby with three minutes left in the game set New England on the path to their 39-32 victory. Barry Sanders was held to only 89 yards rushing on 24 carries, and Scott Mitchell's 320 yards passing were overshadowed by three costly interceptions. \"It's the ultimate combat sim I've experienced... 20 nothing compares.\" TM FlightMaster Profile: -SurfDog, Hanalei, HI surldog@aloha.net . 11 years of flight-sim experience  More than 3,500 total flight hours logged on 25+ different sims  Designer of cockpit simulators Take On The Best www.ef2000.com/gume DIA Ocean Gelenor Circle Reader Service #240 "

It's also literally impossible to return a kick or punt for a touchdown, or even gain more than 20 yards a return. And the kicking game is a bit funny. With Green Bay's Chris Jacke, for example, I never missed 59-yard field goal attempts as long as I gauged the cross wind correctly. But I never hit a 61-yarder.

Here, face-offs (which are better depicted here than in any other hockey game), passing and shootout strategies may be rehearsed ad infinitum. Unfortunately, CREIZKY is up against a bit of a stumbling block in that it is licensed by the NHL Player's Association but not the NHL. Therefore, players like Bondra and Juneau are on a team from Washington, but that team is not the Capitals. Considering the other products out there that have dual licensing (like NHL HOCKEY96), this hockey sim suffers even more in comparison.

"STRATEGY. SU-27 FLANKER SIMULATION/SPACE spot the short range defenses before they blast you, but this may require more passes than you have time for. It's better to do a quick scan of the area with air-to-ground radar first. In scan mode, vchicles appear as twinkling dots. The distance the radar can scan varies with altitude, so make sure you're high enough detection range is roughly 20 times your height above ground level. The Kh-29t's seeker has the same limitation, which means it will only work when pointed three or more degrees below the horizon. Memorize the location relative to the airstrip of each potential target, orienting yourself using both the MFD view and the radar scan diamond in the HUD, then turn off the radar lo ain your Kh-291s. Center a target in the MFD, lock, launch, and then move on to the next target. Seconds count, so work fast. Once you've fired your missiles, dive for the deck and head for home. If you notice any AM or SAM launchers that survived your attack, either because you Outside Su-27 M e S pd : 980 Hag: 312 Alt: 10 Cin: 1 12:52:45 ON THE DECK Flying below 10 meters will protect you from SAMs, but watch out for power lines. cicln't see them or your missiles failed to connect, you might risk another pass to help ensure the safety of your comrades. After you've cleared out, go ahead and call your wingman back into formation for the flight home. Remember to check the AWACS information periodically to ensure you're not being pursued. Target Site f you're looking for more missions to fly and have World Wide Web access, check out Michael Joseph's Outstanding \"Unofficial Su-27 Flanker Home Page\" at http://nwlink.com/amikej/su27.html. The site features a growing archive of player-designed missions and films, but its centerpiece will be a branching missionbased campaign scenario that Mike and his team are developing. The lack of a built-in campaign mode is a common gripe among Su-27 FLANKER players, so the completion of this scenario is eagerly anticipated. until it's within the 15 km range of its onboard radar, you must maintain your own raclar lockor the missile will selfdestruct. It is possible to guide the R-77 through this initial stage using just the EOS, but without accurate range information your missile may fall short. After you judge that the R-77 has switched on its radar, turning off your radar and using the EOS in search mode lets you track your missile to see if it's likely to hit. Countermeasures deployed by air targets can have weird effects on your sensor displays. If your radar is locked onto a target, and suddenly the numerical target information disappears even though the blip remains, you have been jammed and are probably locked onto a chaff cloud. Break the lock and you'll see the target's blip split in two. The chaff's blip will eventually clisappear before then you can reacquire by guessing which blip is the real aircraft. False contacts also appear when a target you're scaming with the electro-optical system (EOS) dispenses flares, but they won't cause you to lose lock. 'The tips and tactics described here should help you become more effective in your missions, and evoke a greater appreciation for the wealth of realism designed into Su-27 FLANKER. Watch your six -the homeland is counting on your for its defense & Bry C FLANKER IN DETAIL As you fly other missions, you may notice that the Su-27 FANKER manual doesn't cover every gory detail, leaving some things for you to puzzle out for yourself. Here we will clarify some of the more confusing aspects of the simulation. Ballistic weapons, such as unguided rockets and dumb bombs, have undocumented release restrictions that may leave you wondering why you don't get a shoot cue. T'or rockets, you must pitch down at least three degrees to fire. Bombs can't be targeted at greater than four degrees of upward pitch, and will not release if your truc airspeed exceeds 1070 kilometers per hour. The R-77 missile is nicknamed the AMRMMski because of it's similarity to the AIM-120 AMRAAM There is one big clifference between them, however Unlike the AMRAAM, which can operate autonomously from launch to intercept, the R-77 requires radio command guilance to get near the target.

Porced to abdicale, Napolcon was allowed to bid his personal farewell to these brave men. \"Soldiers of my Old Guard, after 20 years I have come to say good bye. France has fallen,\" began the old Emperor's brief and tearful address. I watched that scene from the film Waterloo again, while somberly searching for the words to write this column. After 20 years as a game critic, I, too, have come to say \"good bye.\" Although my circumstances are far happier than exile to Elba, I must leave the pages of Computer Gaming World as a reviewer of strategy games and a columnist THE GOOD NEWS That's the bad news. The good news is that I'm leaving my CGW bunker to join the fight in the trenches. I'm joining the fine team at Interplay Productions where I'll be doing my bit for the war effort to help create strategy games that will build bridges between our veteran war and strategy gaming community (of which remain a proud, long-standing member) and the larger, clusive mass market. Even as I rest my gaming pen to take up a hobby sword, I have been chided by many about what I can look forward to from The Press-how different it will be to receive reviews, rather than write them. I'm leaving my CGW CGW bunkei to join the fight in the trenches. IL BRIEFINGS CIOSIMY  The ammo continues to roll out of Arsenal Publishing. Their latest announcement concerns PACIFIC TIDE: THE RISE AND FALL OF THE JAPANESE EMPIRE 1941-45. Also in the works from Arsenal is TACOPS II and a WWII North Africa version of PANZERS East (being done with the help of Game Designers Workshop's Frank Chadwick).  It's sad to say, but QQP has closed its doors. Apparently, its parent company, American Laser Technology, made the decision. Although QQP seemed to be turning around its fiscal problems thanks to hits like THE PERFECT GENERAL II, it wasn't enough to keep American Laser from taking Ser roul taking aim. QQP founder Bruce Williams and his right-hand man Steve Cohen will probably return to gaming once the dust settles on the closing of QQP. Deadly Games has finally released OPERATION DRUMBEAT, the sequel to their U-BOAT game, for the Macintosh. Alan Emrich, Bob Murphy and Richard Barter will be working on three scenario disks for EMPIRE 2 to be published by Novastar: THE WATERLOO CAMPAIGN (10 scenarios), NAPOLEONIC BATTLES (approximately 12 scenarios), and CIVIL WAR BATTLES.

Despite the rotten fruit from the Lic-ville, the failed Tryst, and senseless flamers, you'll still find me in cyberspace from time to time, where I hope lo continue to expand my circle of friends and share ideas with you. Hey baseball fans! Are you looking for a baseball computer game that plays fast and easy, gives accurate results, and has lots of managerial options? Then look no further! With Full Count you can manage any one of last year's 28 teams, or one of the 200 great past teams included with the game that go all the way back to 1901. You can replay last year's season or draft your own team of superstars. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination. Each team carries up to 45 man rosters. Each hitter and pitcher will perform just as he did in real life. You can instantly view or print any teams' compiled statistics with just a couple of key strokes. Individual box scores can be printed, viewed on screen, or saved to disk and recalled later. You can play head to head, versus the computer manager, or let the computer manage both teams. With the scheduler program, you can play all or part of last year's season or set up your own dream league, generate a schedule, and play the entire schedule. You can manage the teams you want while letting the computer manage the rest. Full Count's standings and league leaders program will give you complete standings and leaders in minutes and is very easy to use. If managing is what you like, you can't beat Full Count for choices and flexibility. You can select line-ups, starters, and relievers. You can bunt, steal, hit and run, and much more.

Blizzard has done an excellent job of creating beautiful animations for cach unit, which are intricate and entertaining, but don't slow the game down even on a 486/66. There are two long campaigns, one track for the Humans and one for the Ores. Campaigns consist of a series of linked scenarios, which involve either building up a base of operations and destroying your opponent's base, or achieving a «quest,\" in which you are given a set number of units and must perform some sort of task before you are destroyed. Base battles involve balancing the cost of military units versus builcling up your village infrastructure.

With slots for up to eight players and very aggressive computer opponents, you can choose anything from simple head-tohead modem struggles to big IPX-network confrontations filled with alliances and betrayals. The multiplayer suite is extremely easy to use, and the only tricky part is making sure each player clicks on the confirmation box beside their name before starting the game. The game comes with numerous built-in scenarios designed for two, four, six or eight players, and many of them have maps that highlight land, sea or air combat. Once you set which players are going to be humans and which will be played by the computer, you can go on your way with the standard settings, or change options such as limited sighting range or even the use of cheat codes. Players joining the game get to see which options are being set, but can only change their alliances or race before the game starts. Creative gamers should really try designing their own battle maps for network play. Tinkering with the attributes of various units can allow for a huge number of possible scenarios. The process of creating and playing scenarios with your friends will give WARCRAFT 2 a long life on your hard drive, and it's a great learning process for you budding game designers out there.

Players can now review the enemy's movement before planning their strategy Happily, ALLIED GENERAL is practically bug free. After over 100 hours with this game, the only technical glitch I found, which neither crashed the program nor affected gameplay, was a rare tendency for the computer to display fortresses as APCs late in the game. The sound and video worked fine from my double-spin CD and Soundblaster Pro. By the way, the video segments have changed somewhat, now taking the form of wartime films complete with narration. The manual, while competent, doesn't really provide much support or background. The charts of available equipment that were so useful for planning core upgrades in PANZER GENERAL are conspicuously absent.

Maligned by many, the Sherman was a well-built, reliable machine that provided very good value for the money. The fact that it tended to fare poorly when compared with, say, a Panther D, should not overly cloud our judgment. Who won, after all? ALLIED GENERAL is not a match for PANZER GENERAL. But in a market virtually overrun with buggy, unfinished wargames that are-pardon me--complete crap, it will be a more than welcome addition to any wargamer's collection, and should remain on their hard drive for quite some time. APPEAL: PANZER GENERAL buffs may find ALLIED GENERAL less fun, but those looking for a generally good wargame won't be disappointed.

You'll have a chance to take on replace ments for the clead and wounded, hire any new units that have contacted Dietrich (your dry-humored agent), and then it's on to the next mission.

If you find you simply can't get through a mission no matter what approach you take, it's likely that some of your units took too much of a drubbing in earlier engagements. Save often, and be prepared to replay scenarios. Magic is invaluable. You'll pick up an Amber Wizard early in the game. Keep him safe in combat, study his spells and use him prudently. In particular, use The Curse of Anraheir with which Allor begins the game. It's an exceptionally useful spell for diminishing the combat effectiveness of enemies, and will drive some into a state of panic Don't let the Grudgebringer Cavalry do all the work. It's a great unit, and there are few things more invigorating than watching its riders spur their horses to a gallop for a charge. But if you use them as your Cavalry main instrument, they'll also get the lion's share of experience. Share the wealth, and try to build a balanced force. If you find an NPC unit already on the battlefield (dwarves, for instance), don't let it stand alone against the enemy. Send assistance immediately. The unit may not be under your direct control, but every ally is valuable in a close fight. By the same token, don't squander your own forces in a series of one-on-one battles. A combined-arms approach is much more effective. One great tactic is tying down an enemy with a flank assault and then hitting it from the rear with cavalry. Following these tips will maximize your army's strength and keep Pyrrhic victory at bay. wargames.

"REVIEW GREAT NAVAL BATTLES, VOLUME 4: BURNING STEEL DIFFICULTY LEVEL STRATEGYZWARGAMES Hulks Of The Atlantic A Change Of Scenery For World War II Naval Battles By Bob Proctor SHIPS STOICATES E-BOSHIP     Pow, SURFACE ATTACK GE HIND DUR: 230 S DOOR LINEAMEO ET FORHRTIOR Si has released yet another naval battle game, this one set in the European scas. In many respects, GREAT NAVAL BATTLES 4 is similar to its predecessors, with data for British, German, Italian, French and Soviet ships, in lieu of Pacific powers. What I like best about the GREAT NAVAL. BAITLES series are the small, six-to-eight-ship battles. These show off the superb graphics to best advantage and are small enough to let you manage every ship effectively. There are very few scenarios like this in GNB4. Instead, you get a heavy dose of fleet actions, and controlling these numerous forces tends to get very laborious. For me, six to cight ships is about my limit; others may find their tolerance higher or lower but I doubt any one will have the patience for a Trafalgar ll or a Jutland 1940 scenario. Fire Hole TRENDS CONTACTS T OPS TEOSSOS 4391119 TOWING THE LINE GREAT NAVAL BATTLES 4 has some pretty graphics and a good interface, but is only a bland addition to the GNB lineup. tion; most of your ships will automatically select the biggest target. This affects accuracy and makes all of your fire less effective. The only solution is to go to manual mode on each ship and constantly check and recheck its targetting. A third problem is with torpedoes; put simply, the Al won't fire them at anything other than pointblank range. Finally, the game design won't let you form task forces at sea, for say, torpedo runs or to fire smokescreens. ing array of fleets in action, some historical and others hypothetical. GREAT NAVAL BATILES 4 is a competent game and there isn't anything better at the tactical level. It's too bad SSI didn't make the computer a more capable assistant. At times, CNB4 shines through with a few small, engaging battles, but otherwise it's a mediocre addition to the GREAT NAVAL BATTLES scries & Price: $45 System Requirements: IBM compatible 386/33 or better, 8 MB RAM, SVGA graphics, 14 MB hard drive space, 2x CD-ROM drive, mouse; supports most major sound cards # of Players: 1 Protection: none (CD must be in drive to STAYING IN FORMATION The problem is partly in the Al and partly in the game design. The Al docs a poor job in too many areas to be a good assistant in battle. The first problem is keeping ships in formation specifically \"Line Abcad\" formation. Almost every task force begins in this formation with the flagship in the middle of the line. As soon as you order a course change from the flagbridge, the flagship turns and all of the ships in front of it begin a Keystone Kops routine to get back on station. In a battle, you lose control of range and target bearing for one-third to half the ships in the task force unless you adopt individual control! A second problem is target selecENEMY IN SIGHT, CAPTAIN Of the 16 scenarios, only a few are interesting. The British confrontation of the German Bismarck and the battle against the pocket battleship Graf Spce near Uruguay, are small battles. The others are the Atlantic convoy battles, which include hypothetical sorties by the Tirpitz and Graf Zeppelin, as well as historical raids by the Schamhorst and Lutzow. All the other scenarios put a bewilderAPPEAL: Any fan of GNB3, or a gamer with a propensity for micromanagement, will enjoy this game.

"HALL OF FAME elcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. INDUCTION CEREMONY FONT PEL SPORTS DAY OF THE TENTACLE LUCASARTS 1993 hen the zany team of Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer created the script for DAY OF THE TENTACLE, they had one goal in mind-to create the interactive equiva. lent of a Chuck Jones cartoon. They succeeded so well in their mixture of crazy dialogue and off-beat sight gags that by the time they showed DAY OF THE TENTACLE to their idol (Jones is arguably the king of the classic Warner Brothers cartoon directors unless you talk to equally devoted Robert Clampett and Fritz Freleng aficionados), he was impressed enough to try to hire artists Peter Chan and Larry Ahern out from under the project. Fortunately, the artists stayed aboard; the animation team created smooth-flowing sequences like some game designers had always said could not be done; Richard Saunders (WKRP In Cincinnati's Les Nesman) led the voiceover actors in a series of clever performances, and the script from Grossman and Schafer kept gamers full of both challenge and laughter from start to finish. DAY OF THE TENTACLE was supposed to be a sequel to MANIAC MANSION. MANIAC MANSION was Lucasfilm Games' first game as publisher instead of developer, the game which developed the basic toolset for their successful series of graphic adventures (the SCUMM game engine is an acronym for Story Creation Utility for MANIAC MANSION), and the inspiration for a cable television series of the same name. Today, DAY OF THE TENTACLE is better known and better loved than the game that spawned LucasArts' successful string of graphic adventure games FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO SIERRA/DYNAMIX 1993 rom its inception, FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO (FPSFP) has offered the best computer football game graphics possible with 3-D perspectives, a rich color palette and flashy replay features, Project leader Patrick Cook had discovered the value of crisp, vibrant graphics in his earlier tenure with Cinemaware's TV SPORTS series of games, and he used that to give FPSFP the right look and feel to capture the loyalty of thousands of computer football fans. With the first FPSFP edition, he founded a dynasty where those same fans plunk down their hard-earned cash for virtual season tickets year after year, as updates of the great system come along. In addition to the appeal of great graphics, FPSFP brought authentic player/team statistics to the table, allowing gamers to play as general manager and handle personnel management decisions from drafts through trades, lineups and injuries. FPSFP also offered the abil ity to design custom plays/playbooks and provide for league play with cus. tom coaching profiles for Al coaches. Some computer football games offer better stat models and some console football games offer better action, but when most gamers think of computer football, they automatically think of Front Page Sports Football Pro.

"MARTIN CIRULIS whatiwot What's the Deal With... Reviewing? male By Martin E. Cirulis whole thing. You eventually lose your ability to play something just for the heck of it without a part of your brain noting the pros and cons. Like a musician who can't t's the day after New Year's as I write this. While the hangover finally fades, and the last of the holiday visits become merely chaotic memories, I have time to ponder a conversa tion that came up a least a half-dozen times over the past couple of weeks. You all know how the holidays are. You end up at endless little gatherings talking to people you haven't seen since last Christmas (at least). The usual topics come up: \"How are the kids?\" \"Cold enough for you?\" and, inevitably. \"How's work?\" Well, when you write for a living, the work question gets a little complicated, but eventually mention that one of my gigs is reviewing computer games. Now, it I'm talking to someone familiar with our odd little hobby, their expres sion is one of unconcealed lust and envy, and usually followed by, \"Free games...cool! I wish I could get a job like that.\" In the spirit of the holidays, I usu ally smile back and say something humble and encouraging, instead of cackling madly while I count off the number of copies of MECHWARRIOR 2 I've received. But after a few of these exchanges and some of the more glib on-line comments I've been reading of late, I've begun to wonder if maybe somebody shouldn't clear up what this whole deal is about and point out that it isn't a bed of virtual roses. Now, don't get me wrong, reviewing isn't exactly like getting up at 6 a.m. to dig ditches or lug forty. pound boxes of paper around a warehouse. It's pretty sweet for the most part-but it has tedium and agonies all its own. I won't even bother getting into the actual writing, I'll just leave hopefuls out there with the thought that spending countless hours play i ng games gives you the back. ground knowledge to do the job. But it helps to have spent countless hours reading, everything from cereal boxes to Asimov to Shakespeare, if you want to be able to write about what you know in a way that will keep somebody awake And of course, there is the sheer work of playing a game from begin ning to end in just two or three weeks. Yes, I said \"work.\" Oh, I can hear you snorting out there, but think about it for a moment. The time I spend on a COMMAND & CONQUER is a treat, but imagine, for a moment, having to put the same time into the likes of TEKWAR or the first version of OUTPOST. But the highest price to pay for doing this job professionally is that it takes some of the fun out of the CC Free games...cool! I wish I could get a job like that. > written for is pointless to read, because we all know that the reviews are slanted toward big com. panies/advertisers.\" Apart from how incredibly insulting that sort of twaddle is, it is ironic beyond belief. Not only have I never had the gist of a review tinkered with by any Editor I have worked for (in CGW or others), but the only time I have been tempted to \"go easy\" on a game is when it is from a small company. I honestly feel bad when I know I am about to do harm to a small software house-a house that probably tried its best, with limited resources by telling the public that only a demented Yak would enjoy their game. If that's the truth, then ! have no choice but to give you folks the bottom line. Sometimes that doesn't make it feel any better. I'm sure most of you are not in tears over the plight of the computer game reviewer, but as you go through the scads of critical, accurate and sometimes even entertain: ing reviews you find month after month between these pages, spare the odd thought for the writers. Sure it's cool, but it's not all just free games. turn off their critical ear for a night of clubbing, you can't have a simple opinion about a game. \"This sucks\" is okay when you're a lucky con sumer, but when you have to have a half-dozen reasons for every feeling about a game, just in case some rabid PR Rep cries \"foul,\" it takes the simple pleasure out of things. Of course, this kind of noble sac rifice of gaming pleasure and hard. earned writing skill feels completely wasted the first time you come across some Net-wit going on and on about how a magazine you've Computer Gaming World (ISSN 0744-6667) is published monthly by Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., One Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016.
