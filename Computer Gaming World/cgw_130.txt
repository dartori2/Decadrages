"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Second, gamers should use every method at their disposal to get information about new games and new game concepts. Cetting familiar with the Internet and the World Wide Web can provide timely, useful and money-saving information about games, as well as point you to FTP sites where you can download demos and shareware free of charge. The SPA's most recent study shows that over 70% of computer owners have modems, but only 25% use them. According to a recent CGW survey, 81% of our readers have modems and 92% of those use them, but less than 10% have Internet access. Further, gamers can help get computer games on retail shelves by special ordering. Sears has a program they call the Retail Special Order System, or RSOS. It is essentially a catalog in the software area that allows you to order software titles for next day delivery that are not already on the shelves. Future orders for shelf-stocking will be made with reference to the number of RSOS orders, so this can be a way of proving the viability of certain computer games to the retail buyers, Finally, publishers should think more about developing online games, and gamers should think more about participating in on-line games. Sure the money meter is always running on these games, but then again, you don't have to buy an entire game before you play it. You can quit when it's no longer fun or within your budget. With wider and wider Internet access, we hope to see more and more on-line and play-by-email games to expand gaming's horizons beyond the retail channel of distribution. Yes, the entertainment software industry has found its holy grail. Let's just hope it's not an ordinary coffee mug sitting with the other Blue Light Specials.

Domark has plans for Battle of Kursk and Solomon Islands arenas, where these major air battles of WWII can be completely re-created. To maintain the proper historical flavor, the planes available to the sides in the battle will be limited to those actually used in the battle. Interestingly, a squadron of Air WARRIOR pilots who fly Japanese Zeros have already expressed interest in taking up the Japanese cause in the Solomon Island campaign. very difficult to design.

Here, CK is certain not to disappoint, unless it does so because it's too realistic. The CK system uses a \"force model\" rather than a \"table-based\" flight model as used in most simulations. Table-based models use an array of predetermined flight performance numbers for a specific plane. So, for instance, if a P51 Mustang is at 5,000 feet, the simulation looks up the flight performance specs for that plane at that altitude and finds the roll, turn and climb rate numbers. Tablebased sims are very common because they are easy to program, but they produce less-than-optimal results. A force model, on the other hand, is MAY 1995. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 31 "

There were games in 1994 that, like Sid Meier's CIVILIZATION, \"will stand the test of time,\" and we present them here in the most laudable manner we know, the Computer Gaming World Premier Games of the Year. Each year, the editors of CGW try to single out the best computer game in each category the best performances in multimedia products, and the Best of the Best our Premier Game of the Year. We do not nominate games that are merely popular or games which simply appeal to us. We hominate games with the realism, Brilliance and audacity to suspend a cynical gamer's disbelief and have him or her crawling, with complete disregard for sleep and social standing, back for more. In other words, we nominate the BEST. The games are judged on a number of levels, including originality and innovation, playability, contribution to their genre, popularity among our readership, impact upon the computer gaming hobby-and plain ol' Fun.

"195 95 AGTION GAME OF THE YEAR ADVENTURE OF THE YEAR icks and wind COMMANDER babahahahah ction games emphasize fast reflexes, fast decisionmaking and nimble dexterity over long-range strategic plans or accurate modeling of real-world dynamics. They are the games that pump the adrenaline and wear out the buttons on joysticks and gamepads. One of the clear heavyweights in this category is id Software's Doom II, the sequel to the oft-copied but never bested shooting game that won last year's Premier Game of the Year. Doom Il reached the finals by virtue of its diabolical new traps, intricate level designs and devastating new creatures. Magic CARPET from Electronic Arts lifts gamers above the teeming hordes and lets them soar and fight in a magnificent 3-D fantasy world. This real-time action offers innovative gameplay fantastic graphical effects, and even longrange strategy elements. SYSTEM SHOCK Ground-breaking cinematic sequences, published by familiar characters, and hot 3D space combat Origin Sysmake WING COMMANDER III the pick of a tems and competitive action genre. developed by Looking Glass Technologies, at first glance appears to be yet another Doom clone. But its first-person action is fleshed out with adventure elements in an elaborately detailed 3-D world. Farther out in space lie the star fields of LucasArt's TIE Fighter, a space-combat game played from the \"villain's\" side of the Star Wars universe. TIE FIGHTER's challenging missions, enhanced graphics, and improved combat simulation give it enormous replay value. The action category was intensely competitive this year. Every one of the Finalists is a great play, but the edge was held by Origin's WING COMMANDER III. Designer Chris Roberts blends the excitement of IDER III. the original WING COMMANDER with some of the best cinematic cut scenes of any game yet made. Although the term \"interactive movie\" is often abused, WING COMMANDER III comes as close as we've seen to tapping the immense potential of live-action video, while still retaining, at its core, a highly playable game. dventure games let you take an alter ego through a storyline or series of events. The plotlines are usually advanced by solving puzzles, using limited resources wisely, or interacting with the story's characters. This year's finalists definitely raised the graphic ante over past winners. DEATH GATE from Legend is based on the best-selling Weis and Hickman fantasy novels. The quality of the puzzles is evident, but DEATH GATE also uses compelling atmospheric graphics to distinguish its numerous imaginary Rele worlds. DRAGONSPHERE from MicroProse has an intriguing storyline, imaginative fantasy cultures, and a wonderful conversation system within its universe. Psygnosis' Ecstatica is a hybrid of action and adventure in a fantastic 3-D world. The offbeat characters and unusual storyline mesh with the racy humor to form an adventure of a The cute characters of RELENTLESS can pack a different surprising wollop in Aggressive mode. feather. One of the year's most charming releases was Sierra's King's Quest VII, the latest in the distinguished series of graphic adventure games. The featurequality animation and the hodge-podge of classic tales make it the closest we're likely to come to a fairy tale on the computer But it was an obscure game from far afield that caused a surprise upset in the adventure category this year. RELENTLESS, designed in France by Adeline Software and Salmera distributed by Electronic Arts, is an action/adventure that's remarkably innovative in both artistic and game design. Designer Frederick Raynal (ALONE IN THE DARK) has fashioned a surrealistic universe with an odd Fisher-Price look, combined with delightful psychedelic cut-scenes. The different modes adopted by your character (Normal, Aggressive, Athletic, Discreet) potentially provide several different solutions to the game's puzzles. RELENTLESS receives high marks in terms of both innovation and creativity. RELENTLESS designers: Frederick Raynal, Laurent Salmeron, Yael Barroz and Didier Chanfray.

"195 195 MASSA ROLE-PLAYING GAME OF THE YEAR SIMULATION GAME OF THE YEAR ole-playing is a sub-set of the Adventure category, but it generally involves exploring worlds of greater depth, with less emphasis on puzzle-solving to advance the plot. RPGs also emphasize the development of a players' characters over the course of the game, either in numerical attributes, skill levels, spells and abilities, or access to resources, Bethesda's THE ELDER SCROLLS: ARENA offers a dilemma-based character creation system, first-person perspective movement through a 3-D world, rich variety in world cultures, and use of mini-quests to advance the plot. RAVENLOFT from Strategic Simulations, Inc. tried to capitalize on the upsurge of interest in vampires and all things dark. RAVENLOFT's subject matter and new 3-D look enhance the solid background universe created by TSR'S AD&D team. Sir-Tech's STAR TRAIL IS an improvement upon the REALMS OF ARKANIA SYStem. The game's enormous detail in weaponry skills and the ARENA offers a variety of NPCs, a large world to explore, and the best 3D action yet seen in game world make it wella role-playing game. suited for hard-core role-players. Legend's SUPERHERO LEAGUE OF HOBOKEN broke most of the rules. Portions of this game function as a traditional adventure game, while other parts are more like a full-fledged role-playing game. The goofy dialogue and storyline, and well-balanced gameplay make for a wild ride through designer Steve Meretzky's leftof-center imagination. WOLF, from Sanctuary Woods, is an innovative role-playing game that, obviously enough, places characters in the role of a wolf. It skillfully mixes role-playing elements and scientific fact, and its variety of scenarios are designed to teach as well as amuse. Armed with +3 Broadswords and The Armor Of Champions, we pit these games against each other in the editorial arena. Emerging victorious was Bethesda's THE ELDER SCROLLS: ARENA. Intended to be the first in a complex role-playing series, ARENA was the vision of V. J. Lakshman and Julian Lafaye. Both are traditional role-playing gamers, and they liked the idea of combining the perspective of Doom with more traditional role-playing elements. So they created a rich world with a variety of cultures and a myriad of mini-quests, and dropped it into a 3-D environment. The ELDER SCROLLS: ARENA is a breakthrough game richly deserving of this year's role-playing award. imulation games are based on the modeling of vehicles in real-world environments. Typical sims put you in the cockpit of fighter aircraft behind the wheel of million-dollar race cars, or in the close confines of a submarine stalking its prey. This year's finalists are the strongest in many years. 1942: PACIFIC Air War from MicroProse has accurate flight models and detailed graphics, but what makes it unique is its realistic handling of missions during a campaign. Dynamix' ACES OF THE DEEP is a detailed U-boat simulation set in the Atlantic Theater of WWII.

NASCAR RACING from Papyrus via Virgin builds upon the award-winning framework of INDYCAR RACING. NASCAR has more realistic handling characteristics, stunning graphics, and tough competition. US NAVY FIGHTERS from Electronic Arts is a modern campaign Sub designers do it deeper-Alan Roberts, Jarrett Jester, Mike Jones, Dennis Kilgore, and Langdon Beeck. GUINEERING VJ.

Solid play balance, next-generamissed. tion graphics, and a well-designed campaign game make this accessible to novices and veterans alike. And the winners are: NASCAR RACING and AcES OF THE DEEP. We found ourselves torn between the technological excellence of NASCAR RACING and the total experience of ACES OF THE DEEP. Both experiences capture their respective subject matter with incredibly realistic graphics and a near-fanatical devotion to detail. Both have monstrously addicting gameplay, and, in the case of NASCAR RACING, an experience that promises to get better with advances in processor speed. We salute both of these outstanding achievements as winners of the Premier Simulations of the Year.

This latest version offers a strong artificial opponent to go along with the stats and fast play for which Haffner's designs are known.

Combining research and city development with fast-paced tactical combat. WARCRAFT put a fresh twist on an old rivalry. Towering over all, however, is X-COM from Mythos Game and MicroProse. While concepts like hidden movement and opportunity fire have been around in computer games for ages, rarely have they been used so well in a tactical, man-to-man, combat game. Researching exotic alien technology recalls the developmental joy of CIVILIZATION, and the growth of your squad's abilities adds a strong role-playing theme. The economic and political aspects of building facilities to defend Earth's nations offer a good strategic shell, but the game Springs to life when you arm your squad, position them, and hunt down those alien invaders.

"28 WARGAME OF THE YEAR OF THE YEAR STRATEGY buahahalan AICROPROSE 101 argames recreate historical armed conflicts from a command perspective. They emphasize planning, carrying out a coherent strategic concept, and often involve tactics to achieve the objective. This year was a banner year for wargames, with sufficient variety to satisfy everyone from the casual commander to the hard-core military enthusiast. FLIGHT COMMANDER 2 from Avalon Hill is a strategy-oriented look at modern air combat from Korea to Desert Storm and beyond. The depiction of modern air-to-air combat will ring authentic to any would-be pilot--and no joystick is necessary. In Koei's GENGHIS KHAN II. players must use up to 16 different types of units in medieval combined-arms tactics, conduct diplomacy, build an economy at home, and even designate heirs. Terrific campaign options and one of the toughest artificial opponents around make GK2 a wonderful wargame. Avalon Hill's OPERATION CRUSADER One-ups Atomic Games' V FOR VICTORY series in PANZER GENERAL's effective mix of terms of both graphics and graphics, sound, solid Al and unique gameplay. Supply is properly campaigns sets a new standard in emphasized without overwargaming. whelming the design, and the fluidity of desert warfare is captured through a blend of hidden move ment, reconnaissance and improved AI. TIGERS ON THE PRowl from HPS Simulations is a detailed and realistic depiction of modern armored combat. The graphics are lackluster and the learning curve is steep, but the wealth of hard data, \"soft\" factors, and excellent command control make TIGERS highly worthwhile. Even with such stiff competition, there was no wargame better than Strategic Simulations! PANZER GENERAL. Due to its emphasis on fun and its wonderfully simple interface, this game will even appeal to nonwargamers. PANZER GENERAL brings a fresh perspective to WWII with role-playing aspects that let would-be Rommels advance their career with an innovative system of prestige points. Rapid blitzkriegs, set-piece armored assaults, and amphibious landings in over 40 scenarios and campaigns allow for hundreds of hours of challenging play. The design team accomplished this with wellbalanced competition, plenty of \"What if?\" options, a campaign game that really works. PANZER GENERAL is the first wargame since 1987 to garner the #1 spot on the CGW Top 100 polla fine endorsement for the most exciting wargame in a long time. he overall Game of the Year always generates controversy, and the editors of CGW hotly debate the merits of each game. Obviously, all of the category winners have to be considered, but the overall game of the year must be that game that transcends genre boundaries and appeals to a wider range of gamers. This year, all of the finalists considered meet these qualifications. WinG COMMANDER III effectively employs big-name actors and integrates the film footage into a hardhitting action game. TIE FIGHTER tactfully handles the tricky subject of flying for the evil Empire in the Star Wars universe and improves on the intense space combat of X-WING. NASCAR RACING's incredible graphics, sound and overall experience appeal to simulation enthusiasts and casual sports fans alike. PANZER GENERAL may be the mythical \"mass market\" wargame, but achieves that status without insulting veteran wargamers. Despite these worthy contenders, it was the year of X-COM, which burst unheralded onto the scene GASGROECOILO MEGOS GREGOR without full-motion video or other multiWinning in X-COM requires research, media flash.

"Multimedia Awards At any time, but particularly in games, multimedia should mean more than shoveling audio and video onto a disk, Multimedia needs to offer an experience that you cannot get elsewhere, a chance for you to make a difference in what you see on-screen-whether through game performance or direct selection. The two major distinctions which multimedia capability has brought to computer games have been in the areas of characterization and sound. The former has been advanced by the introduction of professional actors and the latter has been enhanced by improvements in sound technology joined with an increased commitment to musical talent. So, this year as last, we celebrate the multimedia performances that we believe really made a difference in their respective products. Acting in a computer game, as well as scoring a computer game, takes different skills than performing in a linear art form. Actors continually tell us that the multiple possibilities for each scene and the tight demands of continuity make computer game performances a real stretch for them. In the same way, the musical composer for a computer game doesn't have the luxury of watching film from start to finish and matching the mood with the music. The computer game score has to be appropriate at every turn. So, we feel it appropriate to offer awards to those artists who improved our game experiences. BEST FEMALE ON-SCREEN PERFORMANCE Ithough this year's outstanding female on-screen performance ap1 peared in a relatively weak game, it was extremely well-played. This year's Premier award for Best Female OnScreen Performance goes to Paige Witte in Hyperbole Studios' THE VORTEX: QUANTUM GATE II. In our review of the game, Charles Ardai called her effort a \"stunning performance\" and stated, \"she delivers her lines Illyria, marvelously portrayed by Paige with such ease and Witte, adds a compelling presence to the naturalness that you surreal storyline of THE VORTEX. forget she's wearing big angel wings and a headdress covered with scraps rummaged from the five-and-dime...\" He's right. In spite of the weakness in the script itself, Witte was perfect as the protagonist's near-ethereal spirit guide, Illyria. Well-done, Paige! HAMOMILAMALLA BEST MALE ON-SCREEN PERFORMANCE nce again, the editorial staff of CGW felt that the best on-screen performance in a computer game was not by an actor in a lead role. The best on-screen performance, and the runner-up performer as well, was provided by a supporting actor. And the winner is Tom Wilson from Origin's WING COMMANDER III. Wilson is best-known for his performance BEST VOICE-OVER ACTING his year's best voice-over performance is something of a surprise. Normally, the voice talents who speak for animated characters in adventure or role-playing games are the leading contenders. Yet, this year, we felt that the performance which added the most to a gaming experience was not in the adventure or role-playing genres. Rather, the Premier award for Best Voice-Over Acting goes to Barry Lank, the commanding officer in Strategic Simulations, Inc.'s PANZER GENERAL. These briefing and debriefing sessions before and after each scenario added an extra dimension to the campaign game. Down deep, you knew that Lank was acting, but he played the part so earnestly that you were simply caught up in the suspended disbelief of the entire game. Along with the game's other multimedia enhancements, Lank's voice-acting did what it was supposed to do it made the game better. as Biff in the Back to the Future film series and, he plays Maniac with something of that same \"Biffness.\" His Tom Wilson (top left) portrays the cocky, scenes are crisp insubordinate Maniac with aplomb in WING III. comedic and convincing. Every dramatic venture needs that character to ratchet up the protagonist's angst and provide that extra bit of tension that makes you really care what happens to the good guy. In WING COMMANDER III. Wilson's Maniac does just that. BEST MUSICAL SCORE If you've ever tried to watch a horror film with the sound muted, you I know that they can look pretty ridiculous. It takes the right sound cues along with the visual to make the right connection with our brain. The same is true of most games. The musical themes and sound effects associated with the imaginary world of the game take the experience up a notch. The winner of this year's Premier award for Best Musical Score is a fresh new sound in the world of computer entertainment, D'Cuckoo. What our editors describe as world-beat-techno-funk was actually an appropriate sound for THE VORTEX: QUANTUM GATE II. The sound matched the global concern and the mythic symbology within the script. We offer a standing ovation to D'Cuckoo's unique sound. 44 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. MAY 1995 "

"Pitch Zone HARDBALL. IV is a statistical disaster; however, among action games, disaster is the norm. This baseball game is the NHL HOCKEY of action baseball. It has a wonderful feel, but it is not real baseball. Kde 12 menus 2 PITCHOUT Tofu BALTIMORE 050 0:2 puter Nerd,\" is the realm of games at tempting to capture baseball statistically. These \"text-based\" games are measured by realism. If you manage the 1993 New York Mets, no matter how skilled you are with baseball strategy and lineup creation, you will be hard-pressed to escape the National League's Eastern Division basement. As sports strategy games are judged, the few that top this genre are among the best. The other direction is the action-based game. Swing your bit-mapped bat at the proper instant. Guide your fielder sprites to the proper position. As in any action contest, the better you master these skills, the better your 1993 Mets will fare. On the whole, these games are much worse than their football and hockey counterparts. They are impressive more in their depiction of Baltimore's Camden Yards or Denver's Mile High Stadium than in capturing the feel of tracking down a high fly ball to deep center. ATHLETES IN ACTION HARDBALL IV is the best action game out there, especially with the recently released patch: FRONT PAGE SPORTS: BASEBALL (left), unfortunately, is nothing like its pigskin bro'. It is, perhaps, easier to master than Electronic Arts' on-ice action. After just a few games, you'll be handily winning games. If, or when, you make contact with the ball, it almost seems like there is a 50% chance the ball will land somewhere between two outfielders. And infielders have all the range of Ozzie Smith-when he's fast asleep. Fortunately, Accolade recently released a patch for HARDBALL that fixes some of these problems. Hits are slightly harder to come by and the fielding, particularly in the infield, is more easily controlled. Although our limited testing hasn't revealed too dramatic a change in difficulty, hopefully there is more here than seen at a quick glance. It's Ruthless, Ingenious & Downright Dangerous. BATTING LEADOFF Three games, all fairly new to the scene, currently lead the action baseball market. Accolade's HARDBALL. IV is by far the most visually impressive. The game's designers spent an enormous amount of effort putting together the SVGA baseball fields and pitching animations. HARDBALL features an excellent pitching interface, simple in theory, yet a model for all future development. Each pitcher has the ability to throw three or four of eight available pitch types, specializing in one. A button press selects the pitch. Another press begins the windup. You then attempt to guide the pitch into the proper location, your success determined by the pitcher's control rating Hitting, as in all action baseball games, is an exercise in timing the swing of the bat. Because pitch location is very difficult to determine, HARDBALL, like its competition, is generous in allowing contact with the baseball, despite offering nine different locations for the swing. Once contact is made, the view shifts to a fielding screen, where the object is to guide the fielder toward the ball. Outfield play in HARDBALL is very difficult and is the key to successfully beating your opponent. SIR-TECH Circle Reader Service #163 "

"boardgame. But once more I say, \"So what?\" An «After Dark» screen saver has options I can set and amusing little animations to watch, but I'm not going to sit and play with the thing for more than a few minutes. I'd be surprised to hear of anyone treating HOD 'N' PODJ differently. en lave et BRAW AUT) WHAT'S THE DEAL? Apparently, Steve Meretzky thinks the world is a better place with another poker machine in it. ditional board game, a segmented path meanders through the illustration and the players-Hodj in the blue tights and tunic, his brother Podj in the red-take turns moving segment by segment, after rolling the electronic equivalent of dice to determine how many segments they are permitted to move in a given turn. Dotted around the board are various sites of note: the locations of the 19 minigames which Hodj and Podj must play to turn up clues to the princesses' whereabouts and the valuable trinkets needed to effect a rescue, plus the dozen forbidding locations («Hermit's Tent,\" \"Pirate's Cove,\" \"Warlock's Lair\") where the princesses might be stashed. Walk around the board and you'll encounter some of the random effects Meretzky has thrown in-\"Lose a turn,\" \"Move again\"-plus other features of the sort you might find in a conventional board game, such as shortcuts from one part of the board to another. Successfully complete a mini-game and you'll either be paid off in goods or directed to look up a clue in one of the two cluebooks that come with the game. The clues tell you (without revealing to your human opponent, if you have one) what you must do to release the princesses from captivity. Free them and there's only one task left: you must escort them back to the castle at the center of the board without being intercepted by the other player, who can snatch the princesses from you if he bests you in a mini-game challenge. That's it for the \"frame\" game-the pudding, if you will. As for the plums, it's worth noting only that there are 19 of them, and that the ones you haven't heard about already are no more captivating than the ones you have. In fairness, Meretzky and the crew of artists he's pulled together do their best to turn some pretty simplistic entertainments into full-fledged multimedia affairs. The peg-jumping game «Peggleboz,\" for instance, is the best peg-jumping game I've ever played, mainly because the \"pegs\" here are shot glasses and a boozy hiccup accompanies your removing one of them from the board. \"Battleship\" here is \"Battlefish,\" complete with sound effects that include kazoo music and a crusty old salt growling, \"Arrr! You sank her sardine!\" But so what? These tired old things are games you could play in your sleep, and a bit of freshening up on the soundtrack does little to encourage you to stay awake. Cryptograms are cryptograms, even if there's a googly-eyed skull on the screen reciting W.C. Fields and Groucho Marx lines. «Solitaire\" is still \"Solitaire,\" even if Meretzky sets the whole affair in a barbershop and posits a deck with five suits and Barbers, Customers, and Manicurists for face cards. To spice things up further, there are plenty of irrelevant hotspots on each screen for questing cursors to stumble upon, and some of the animations these unleash are amusing. (Others are merely bizarre, such as when an armchair inexplicably turns into an automobile.) There is also some room for modification within each of the games-settings for difficulty levels, speed, time limits, skill of the computer-controlled opponent, and so forth--and the option of playing the mini-games without bothering with the SCORE BOARD One could make the case that Hop 'N' PODJ must not be intended for experienced gamers, that it is a family game meant to be shared with the young'uns, and that it's a perfect package for kids because each generation deserves its own chance to discover \"Whack-a-Mole.\" I'd go along with this notion, were it not for a couple of serious flaws. First, the recent proliferation of unapologetically unoriginal puzzle-compilation games makes me worry that we can expect to see still more down the line. There are only so many classic puzzles to go around, and already with Honj 'N' PODJ we're seeing plenty that even young computer gamers will recall seeing before. Second and more important, though, is that the renditions of the puzzles in HODJ 'N' PODJ are not consistently top-notch. If it's true that everyone should get to play these time-honored classics, they should also get to play them at their best. But the videogame knockoffs in this game are horrid—»Pac-Rat\" and \"Archeroids» are sluggish and barely playable—and the traditional puzzles range in quality from excellent (\"Peggleboz\") to clumsy (\"Word Search\") and banal («Art Parts,\" a jigsaw puzzle with rectangular pieces). There is some good stuff in this package, but not nearly enough. Given what else is out there, even those with a pronounced puzzle craving should be able to do better than Hodj 'N' Podj. THE EDITORS SPEAK HODJ 'N' PODJ PAIMG  RIDDLE ME THIS When you're talking classic games and brain-teasers, you can't get much more \"classic\" than good ol' riddles. (A: \"Fork\") PROS Polished graphics and a sense of humor help jazz up some classic puzzles. CONS You've seen all the puzzles before, often done better than they're done here. How jazzed can you get about \"Life\" or \"Solitaire,\" anyway? 82 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1995 "

In keeping with the new industry awareness on violence, ROTT comes with an adjustable setting which modifies the level of on-screen gore. As socially estimable as this may seem, ROTT also offers some grotesque sequences that will appall most parents and not a few gamers. Apogee, knowing full well that there's money to be made in bloodshed, is billing ROTT as \"The most violent 3D action game ever created.\" Fire a bazooka into a High Guard at close range, and you're liable to be splattered with severed heads, eyeballs, and the occasional missing limb as the game chortles \"Ludicrous Gibs.\" One can be thankful that aside from this bit of wit, cannibalism is not a part of the game. Wounded prisoners beg for mercy on their knees, but since they'll recover and attack you if you don't linish them ofl, you are practically required to give them the coup de grace.

"MARTINSVILLE SET-UP OVERVIEW Fast Car: Diligence paid off big time at Martinsville. This car was quite capable of turning high 97s, a few 98s, and one earth-shattering 99.666, obliterating the currently posted CompuServe record with Goodyear tires by over a second. Take four or five laps to warm things up, slow it down through turn three, and give 'er hell coming out onto the front straight. Stay low in the corners and remember, exit speed is everything. Race Car: Working mainly with tire pressures and camber, we developed a car that will literally toy, toy I tell you, with 100% competition. Tremendous exit speed and grip with a full tank of gas will have you running consistent 95s and 96s early in the race. The advice from this corner: get up front, then coast. Let them try and catch you as your tire temps get down into the white all 'round. This thing's a bit slippery as fuel load decreases, so be careful nearing each pit stop. ATLANTA SET-UP OVERVIEW Fast Car: Get this baby warmed up, then forget about the brakes. Aim for the geometric apex when entering the turns while gently rolling off the throttle, and never let the speedo drop below 165 mph. The less squeal you hear, the better. This set-up has notched a top one lap speed of 183.562, but will nail several consecutive high 182s when driven right. Race Car: The surprise find of our research, this set-up is an amalgamation of two others, and a definitive one it is. It offers dead even tire temps across the board, throughout the run from full to empty, and won't burn up the rubber. It's a little finicky at first, but adapts quickly, and has been known to crack off a high 179 mph lap in the early going. Like the Martinsville race car, slowly work your way to the front, and make the enemy come after you-you'll be quite able to pass them back, at will. As an added bonus, this car has qualified (with less fuel of course) at a 180.198, good for pole. The rest is up to you. If you don't find these settings to your liking, tough toenails. But if you do (and you probably will), remember to tell them Johnny Speed sent you. a good car way off. Those are the basics. Don't be discouraged if you spend several hours setting up just one car for one application—the payoff is worth it and your name and record time will come up each time that track is loaded. The best settings come through patience, experimentation, and by accident. If you've reached the final step above and still aren't satisfied, don't be afraid to go back to the start. Just keep track of anything new, whether it works or it doesn't When you've finally clocked some scorching laps, it's time to refill the tank (you did drop the fuel level when tuning for a fastest lap, didn't you?), and de-tune for a full-race car. The major area of concern here is the right front tire, as usual. If the car is just FLYING around the track early, it's right front rubber will most probably evaporate over the long haul. Tire temperatures in the 200-230 degree range are ideal. Any colder and you're just not getting enough contact; any warmer and they may wear out too quickly. Try and find that happy medium between performance and long-term stability. It's up to you: de-tune or be prepared to add one or two extra pit stops to your run. Pour yourself a cup of java and get ready to drive four-fifths distance to the first fuel stop; by that time you'll know how a decreasing fuel load and heated tires affect performance. Oh yeah, follow the groove—it's there for a reason, and don't worry about your brakes, they don't fade. Finally, drop that death grip on the joystick or wheel (we used a CH Flightstick for testing), and make sure it's in calibration. And remember, there's a ton of variability under race conditions, not the least of which is other traffic, so no alteration is ever completely wrong. I've found that some of the best race settings don't work particularly well until a halfdozen or more laps are behind me, so take your time and, as they say, break a leg, kid. The author wishes to thank Rick Weaver, the Pacific Northwest's top racing crew chief, and Andy Mahood, veteran Formula Ford, Formula Atlantic and stock car driver, for their assistance in setting up cars for this report.

"He ruled the auto industry. mand and control and adequate supply lines. As supply is determined for combat units at the start of the day, however, they are free to move out of supply during the course of the day's actions, provided a viable supply line exists at the beginning of the next morning. This provides combat units with considerable autonomy-particularly in the scenarios with smaller map scales, which have eight turns per day. Smaller map scales? That's right, campaigners, the biggest change to the WORLD AT WAR game system is the variable scales at which scenarios take place. Unlike other products, which offered just a single scale (and often a single map), STALINGRAD offers three map scales-400m/hex, Ikm/hex or 3km/hex. The shift in scales creates a few problems as far as realism is concerned. A rather vociferous debate on various electronic bulletin boards has centered on the inability of the game engine to support direct ranged fire, even at the 400m scale. As many armored vehicles and anti-tank guns had ranges in excess of 400m, this would seem to be a weakness in the game's realism. Furthermore, the stacking allowances at the smallest scale are somewhat generous. Putting three battalions into an area 400 meters across is certainly possible, but it could hardly be considered militarily prudent. Stalingrad. The designers at Atomic and their deAAAA A Red Barn! fenders have countered these criticisms by arguing that Am the 400m scale is presented GA regeing 02 rèscing 62 primarily to 400 METERS/HEX To the Volga! finds the German 6th simulate close Army banging at the door of the Red Barricades combat within Factory. Realism? Well... the city of Stalingrad itself. Within such a built-up area, ranged fire would be unlikely beyond 40 meters, let alone 400. Furthermore, within the tightlypacked environs of Stalingrad both the Germans and the Soviets employed massive numbers of men and large numbers of equipment-unit densities which would have been unlikely under other circumstances. While this explanation sounds a bit more like rationalization than justification, both critics and defenders seem to have overlooked the larger issue here—variety. By adding two additional levels of play, the designers have, within the compass of a single product, produced three quite distinct gaming experiences, though not all of the various scales will please the historicallyminded gamer. At the smaller scales, the movement allowances for combat units are much greater. This can lead to a much more open, free-wheeling style of play. Furthermore, artillery ranges are, as one might expect, considerably greater than at the larger scales. This means that long-range artillery can cover a much greater portion of the battlefield, providing commanders with considerably more flexibility and firepower.

"He ruled the shipping lanes. File Options Staff Duties Planning Phase WINNERS AND LOSERS The real strength of STALINGRAD lies in the design of its scenarios. But not all of the them are winners. Quietly Flows the Don, for instance, embodies all of the weaknesses both of Atomic's basic game system and many of their previous products. The scenario is one segment of the campaign game—the collapse of the northern lank of the 6th Army at the outset of the Soviet counterattack-with the map, unit dispositions and reinforcement schedules as they are in the larger battle. It offers absolutely nothing that is not in the campaign game, and while the designers may defend its inclusion as a case study, it looks more like add-water-and-stir type scenario-building to me. Fortunately, Quietly Flows the Don is the exception, rather than the rule. From the mammoth campaign game, which runs 188 turns and involves more than 1000 individual units on both sides, to the wonderfully fluid Manstein's Solution (200 units, playable in an extended evening) the scenarios are original, diverse and a lot of fun. Because of the different map scales (2 scenarios at 400m, 2 at Ikm and 3 at 3km), players will not notice that all of the battles take place within the confines of a single strategic map. Also, the campaign game map is so huge that smaller segments of it do not feel claustrophobic by comparison. The smaller scenarios, particularly DEUROECOME those that allow more room for maneuver, have an internal logic and integrity O @ & which clearly separates 2B2 them from Om the more Manstein's Solution s Palangor, sweeping 3 KILOMETERS/HEX The familiar WORLD AT WAR interface scale of the and game system is at its best in the wide-open campaign. Manstein's Solution scenario. The best scenario is Manstein's Solution. This hypothetical battle is based on the designers' estimation of what Von Manstein might have done to relieve the beleaguered 6th Army had he unlimited freedom of action. Both sides have strong, mobile forces, and neither starts in possession of the field of battle. The log of war rules, combined with appalling weather conditions, mean that neither side is likely to know where the other is, or what he is seeking to accomplish. The resulting confusion is immensely enjoyable, and I had to force myself to stop playing it just to give the other scenarios a fair hearing Furthermore, the scenario does not feel like a repetition of the campaign game, nor does it play like a cheap knock-oll created as a throw away to bulk up the marketing of the overall package. Against the computer, Manstein's Solution can be completed in a single sitting, bringing some welcome relief from the more lengthy scenarios.

"He ruled motion pictures. tion took considerably longer, although the enjoyment factor was commensurably higher. Throughout the scenarios-except for Quietly Flows the Donthe designers have managed to inject an impressive sense of urgency to the gameplay. Coordinating attacks in an uncertain environment with the clock ticking is a tricky business. Devastating overrun attacks can be quite rewarding if players judge their opposition correctly, but they may waste valuable time with no results i their intelligence is inaccurate. It's one thing to build the fog of war into a game system, it's another to create scenarios that take advantage of the feature to build real tension and gaming excitement. Not knowing where the enemy is (those Russian steppes are big), or where the real crisis may fall, adds a dimension of unpredictability to STALINGRAD that is sadly lacking in many computer games. In addition to uncertainty, the space, weather, limited unit numbers and limited intelligence all combine to create ample possibilities for another facet of warfare: deceit. Because intelligence is so unreliable, and because most battles involve considerable mobility, it is possible to screen off a large enemy force by creating the appearance of a strong defense where it does not exist. On the other hand, a strong defense, particularly with mobile units, might be more effective if weakness is feigned, luring the enemy's leading elements into a trap. ALL INTENSE ON THE EASTERN FRONT Obviously, everything in STALINGRAD doesn't pass muster. As good as the individual scenarios are collectively, the lack of realism on the 400m/hex scale will irritate historical bulls. The e-mail and sound bugs are disturbing for a game engine that has been around the battlefield as long as V ror V/ WORLD AT WAR. The computer opponent, although still better than many wargame systems, isn't as good an opponent in STALINGRAD as it was in CRUSADER, mostly due to the larger number of units involved in contesting the Russian steppes. Even with all the above, this is one of the only wargames for the PC that I can remember where the advice given by Sun Tzu in The Art of War was actually useful. Overall, STALINGRAD is a moderate success, not just because of the fancy graphics, not because of the well-refined interface capable of providing more useful information on each individual unit than any other THE EDITORS SPEAK game I am aware STALINGRAD of, but because of the game's ability to RATING challenge its playPROS Excellent documentation, ers to think both superb graphics, and a mature strategically and interface make it easy to enjoy one tactically.

You begin the game with a small, squat merchant ship called a fluyt, a pragmatic design invented by Dutch traders. You have about 5000 gold with which to outfit a ship with rations and materials and invest in cargo. By merely moving the cursor across the painting of your home port, captions appear which you can click to bring up various pop-up spreadsheets or, in the case of the tavern or charthouse, another menu disguised as a painting, Want to repair or outfit your ship? You call up the Dock spreadsheet. Want to buy or sell commodities? Go to the Market spreadsheet. Want to find a navigational chart or hire a helmsman? Call up the Charthouse screen. Want to deposit/withdraw gold from the bank? Click for the Bank spreadsheet. All of these elements are present in every port, but three portions of the interface deserve special consideration: the Market and Tavern screens. The Market screen is a huge spreadsheet. For every available commodity it shows the buying/selling price for that port, the amount available at that port, and the amount aboard ship. Merely clicking on directional arrows will allow transactions to occur, but the most welcome news is that each ton of each commodity being negotiated is kept in red letters in a pending column until you are satisfied that you have the right amounts in place. The deal is not done until you click the Accept button. Until then, you can negate any pending deal with the click of the Cancel button. This ability to back out of an error is a welcome and useful feature. Perhaps even more welcome is the Logs button at the bottom of the Market Spreadsheet.

GEMINI'S TOP 40 GAMES 9 (continued from page 174) THE LONE WOLF JOINS THE PACK Crawford has been laboring on LE MORTE D'ARTHUR for well over a thousand days, working from his home in San Jose over-looking Silicon Valley. His constant companion is his suped-up Mac II, on which he cranks out Pascal programs as he attempts to find his own grail. Along the process of creating the engine for the game, he realized its universal functionality as a storytelling tool. Now, Crawford has entered into a partnership to create a design house that will not only finish work on LE MORTE D'ARTHUR, but also perfect the engine as a development environment that could then be licensed to other designers. Already, he is planing two additional games, one based on office politics and climbing the corporate ladder, and another a lusty soap opera, but more akin to a Three Musketeers-type of romance than a lunch time soap. After a decade and a half as a lone wolf programmer, doing everything from design to programming to art, Crawford has realized that a team is required to create the whole product. Already, he has worked with artists to create LE MORTE D'ARTHUR'S facial interface, since Crawford firmly believes the human face is the most efficient tool for reflecting the emotional state of a character. He has had the artists create face \"foundations\" for each of the 16 characters, and a \"Mister Potato Head\" approach of hundreds of facial tiles to create a desired expression. \"The true test,\" reflected Crawford, \"was to see if this approach could accurately represent Guinevere's come hither' look.\" The first step in the mainstreaming\" of Crawford's work is to get his Mac-based Pascal code optimized in C++ for the PC. AFter that grunt work is completed, Crawford will set up his \"storytelling hierarchy\" for creating his interactive stories. He envisions a \"master storyteller\" who works on larger design issues and character and story development. This storyteller will then oversee three separate teams: a tools team for program design, a writing team for crafting the substories and characters' responses, and an art team to craft the most effective means to present the story to the player. Soon, Crawford will invite his engine licensees to his facilities for an intensive training period in this new type of interactive story telling. After training, the licensees can then go off to create their own tales of character conflict and interaction. After three and a half years, Crawford still has a lot of work to do, at least another year until LE MORTE D'ARTHUR is complete, but he can see the light at the end of the tunnel. For years, he has been outspoken visionary promoting the values of character interaction in computer games, feeling at times like a solitary wolf howling at his own moon that nobody else has seemed to notice. Now, his journey is almost complete. From his beginnings at Atari, where 77 cycles were the Holy Grail, he has traveled very far indeed, and stands on the brink of something truly unique in the realm of game design. \"It's a massive challenge,\" said Crawford, \"trying to figure out under what circumstances will a character respond with anger or burst into tears? What kind of tools and techniques do you use to create that level of interaction? It sure as hell ain't computer science.\" GEMIN GAMES Circle Reader Service #369 178 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD MAY 1995 "


"Hey! you've got two bi-directional alien-finders attached to your head and you didn't even know it! Now you can use 'em to play your favorite games in 3D sound that zigs when they zig and zags when they zag! The Command 3D Sound Engine* can transform your favorite computer game into an in-your-face, lookout-behind-you, multi-sensory experience. Unlike other 3D sound processors, the Sound Engine surrounds you with a 270° soundfield that responds to the movements of your joystick.
