But wait a second. As I sat down and listened to panel after panel of celebrity video game designers talking about their greatest and worst moments, and as I chatted up the attendees at this decidedly non-schmoozy event, I realized the sad truth. In '84 or '89, if you had asked anyone who was into the Atari 2600 and Intellivision what they thought of gamers who played on the Vic-20 or the Commodore 64 or even the snobbish Apple II, you probably would have heard one word consistently. That word is not \"cool\"-it's \"geek.\" Regardless of platform or coolness factor, I was still amongst my kind at the Plaza hotel in downtown Las Vegas. Here, I could talk about that week when I had Tron dreams on a nightly basis to people who understood. And I could also spend some highly pleasurable time with some of the guys-like David Crane and Garry Kitchen-responsible for some of the most innovative game design the industry has ever seen.

"LETTERS Missing Wrath ON'T GET SHAFTED! If you want to play the classic Romulan episode \"Balance of Terror,\" you'll have to buy STARFLEET COMMAND from Interplay. I recently bought a copy of STARFLEET COMMAND. On the way home I glanced through the manual at scenarios. \"Cool,\" I noted, \"The Wrath of Khan scenario. That'll be awesome!\" So I got home, eager to try myself out against Khan's \"genetically engineered intellect,\" but when I loaded the scenarios, no Wrath of Khan. \"Okay,\" said I, \"It's probably out on their Web site.\" There, I find out that if you purchase the game from them, you get a disk with \"Balance of Terror\" the old classic Romulan episode from the first series as well as \"Wrath of Khan\" and two others. Well, I called them up, ready to pay a few bucks extra to get that disk, but they told me that it was unavailable unless purchased directly from them. They also said that they would NEVER release these scenarios for the game on their web site. or even on a future scenario disk. That means, from now until eternity, I shall never be able to play \"Balance of Terror\" or the \"Wrath of Khan\" unless I order them from Interplay. This is now a major inconvenience, as I must return the old game to Electronics Boutique, order from them, pay more for the game than the standard market price, and pay shipping as well. For long-time Trekkers like myself, \"Wrath of Khan\" and \"Balance of Terror\" are must-haves. I think you need to alert customers to this dirty trick on the part of Interplay, that they have no choice: they must either purchase direct from Interplay, or no \"Balance of Terror\" or \"Wrath of Khan\" from now until Judgment Day Dezso Janos Bartha Kingpinheads you have only one choice. I'll also bet there are a lot of people out there that feel the same way. Perhaps the sales of the games will reflect this. At least currently, I'm not limited to \"honing my skills against bots.\" Tony Pilasiewicz m y father and I recently went to the computer store IV to purchase the newly released KINGPIN: LIFE OF CRIME. He was fine with the Mature rating and knew about the extreme violence that was supposedly in the game. When we got to the store the salespeople who are supposed to be selling us the game acted as though they did not want us to buy it. They told my father that there were incredibly graphic rape scenes that involved 12-year old girls. My father and I were shocked at this fact and stormed out of there. My question is: Is what the sales people were telling us all true or were they bending the truth? Zack Epcar Your salesperson was either moralistic or misinformed. There are no rape scenes amidst the grime and gore, but it's definitely not a game for young players. Guerilla Tactics T just read Jim Cobb's review of THE OPERATIONAL LART OF WAR II (September, pg. 160) and I had to chuckle. In the review he states, \"And how guerrillas, no matter how feisty, can hold out against large, well-supported regulars is a mystery to me.\" Don't feel like you are alone. I'm sure Lyndon Johnson, General Westmoreland, and Robert McNamara felt the same way about the Vietcong.

Not all of us play online, and I think some big upcoming games are screwing the single player (you know who you are-id, EA, etc.). I've enjoyed many of your games in the past, you know, when a single-player game was included. I understand online gaming is huge.

After I read the magazine, I let my son have it. He loves looking at it. In fact, we are using it as a potty train ing aid, by letting him look at it only when he sits on the potty.

"Read.Me The Latest News From Around the Gaming World  Edited by jeff_green@zd.com Interplay Unveils Next Fantasy RPG ICEWIND DALE A Dungeon Romp Using BALDUR'S GATE Engine Tnterplay just unveiled its plans for the next RPG set in the AD&D Forgotten Realms Luniverse, and no, it's not BALDUR'S GATE 2 not this time. You'll probably hear more about that sometime soon, but in the meantime, Interplay hopes to satisfy your AD&D jones with ICEWIND DALE, an action-oriented dungeon romp set in the northernmost tip of the Forgotten Realms. Due early next year, ICEWIND DALE uses Bioware's BALDUR'S GATE engine, but is going to go heavier on the action and lighter on the plot, a la DIABLO. \"We looked at what it took to make BALDUR'S GATE, and what people liked,\" said Chris Parker, the game's producer (and in-house producer on both BALDUR'S GATE and the TALES OF THE SWORD COAST expansion). \"We thought we could probably do a very fun and exciting. more action-based RPG. Since PLANESCAPE: TORMENT (Interplay's other big AD&D RPG now in development) is a hardcore, questand story-based RPG, we thought it would be cool to make a lighter game that was more action-based, and we realized we could do it with the BALDUR'S GATE engine.\" The game is going to take place entirely underground in a series of dungeons, with a variety of environments, including snowy nordic regions, volcanic areas, and steamy jungle. The game's monsters will be up to four times bigger than the biggest creatures (the wyverns) in BALDUR'S GATE. According to Parker, ICEWIND DALE will still feature numerous quests and subquests, but the emphasis this time will be much more on combat and character building, rather than storytelling, As such, the current plan is to let characters reach Level 12 or 13 much higher than in the original BALDUR'S GATE. \"This will be a classic dungeon crawl,\" said Parker. \"In fact, that was the first tentative name for the game. The main focus will be going after cool items and spells and leveling up.\" One cool feature for serious role-players is that the game will be entirely party-based; 30 NOVEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com.

"Read.Me 5, 10, 15 Years Ago in CGW 15 you'll be able to generate your whole party of six characters from scratch at the game's beginning. Black Isle is making minor tweaks to the game engine such as speed improvements for character movement but in general is not futzing with it. \"We're basically just generating content and building tons of levels,\" said Parker. \"We're not monkeying with Bioware's engine. We're taking what we can from their wisdom.\" The game will incorporate the AD&D 2nd Edition rules, rather than the just-announced 3rd Edition rules, mainly due to timing. \"Rewriting the rules inside the game engine would require a gutting of the engine, and we don't want to do that,\" he said. \"The payoff might not be enough at this point.\" Finally, gamers should know that there is no overlap with BALDUR'S GATE at all in ICEWIND DALE. You won't be able to import your BG characters, nor will there be any characters from the earlier game appearing in the new game. It's a brand-new experience. Can ICEWIND DALE compete in the ever-growing action-RPG field especially with DIABLO 2 due to ship about the same time? With the AD&D license and the popular BALDUR'S GATE engine, it has a better chance than most. We'll bring you more on this game as it gets closer to completion. Jeff Green Nov./Dec. 1984 It was 15 years ago this month that CGW reviewed F-15 STRIKE EAGLE, a landmark game for two reasons: First, it was one of the first attempts at a serious flight sim on a personal computer, and second, it was the virgin game design voyage of a young guy named Sid Meier. Meier would leave flight sims behind for strategy games, but the mark made by F15 would remain for years to come. So novel was the flight sim concept that our review actually spelled out the fact that you could bank, roll, dive, and even do maneuvers like a Split-S. Oooooh. And we raved over the fact that there were both air and ground targets to shoot at, even though the ground targets were colored triangles on an endless sea of green. We've come a long way, baby. COMPUTER November 1989 Christmas came early in 1989, and what a Christmas it was. A number of huge game franchises got their start that year, including Activision's MECHWARRIOR, Sierra's HERO'S QUEST, Maxis SIMCITY. and New World's KING'S BOUNTY (which would evolve into HEROES OF MIGHT & MAGIC). Also released was STARFLIGHT 2, the much-loved space opera that would spawn the STAR CONTROL series.

"Read.Me 1999 GenCon Report The GOOD. Big PC Game Presence at Annual Geekfest RE*VOLT One of those amazingly great little games that comes from out of nowhere to blow us away, and cause us to once again miss all of our deadlines. This remote-control car racer is fun and addictive and it looks awesome too. One sign it has taken over: Resident crank Dave Salvator has been screaming, cursing, and breaking controllers in his office all week. Face it, Dave: You suck. A nifty, multi-level Battletech game in progress. PALM PILOT GAMEBOY EMULATOR According to the PalminfoCenter Web site (www.palminfocenter.com), a developer named Maven is hard at work on a Gameboy emulator for the Palm Pilot. This must happen. Someone give this man some money. We want to play Pokemon on our Palm Pilots. No, really we do. the BAD TAT ere you getting jiggy with it August 5th-8th? The gaming geeks VV and we include ourselves sure were. Over 57,000 attendees, all but three wearing black XXXL t-shirts, broke records at the four-day GenCon convention in Milwaukee, hosted by Wizards of the Coast. There were quite a few computer game companies showing their wares in addition to all of the pen-and-paper games, collectible card games, board games, and miniatures games that were on display and being played. The big non-computer game announcement actually ties in to computer gaming. Wizards of the Coast and their subsidiary TSR announced that Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition rules were under development, and will be released at next year's GenCon. This led into two big computer game announcements. First, SSI officially announced POOL OF RADIANCE 2 and showed a brief clip; it will be a single-player, party-based game. In addition, Interplay and Bioware announced and showed off NEVERWINTER NIGHTS, Bioware's next Forgotten Realms game, following their massively successful BALDUR'S GATE. This game looks like it could be huge (see our sneak preview in this issue). Both games are 04 2000 releases and will use 3rd Edition D&D rules. TIBERIAN SUN MULTIPLAYER LAMENESS We're enjoying the game, in general, after a few days of playing the final release, but we've had nothing but trouble trying to play a multiplayer game it crashes constantly and drops players out without warning. This game was years in the making. Bugs are inexcusable. IRON CHEF CANCELLED Okay, so it doesn't have anything to do with gaming. But this competitive cooking show from Japan was one of the best things on TV, and its appeal to gamers was widespread. Watching a QUAKE match isn't half as cool as watching two gourmet chefs compete, making dishes like tongue ice cream. Bring it back! and the UGLY. Gathering Of Game Companies Sony and Verant, makers of EVERQUEST, officially debuted SOVEREIGN, a massively multiplayer real-time strategy game. Games can be played with as few as four players and as many as 500. Verant was also showing off the EVERQUEST expansion, the RUINS OF KUNARK. Hasbro Interactive and Microprose were showing DIPLOMACY, RISK 2, and MAJESTY. We were intrigued with MAJESTY and went back to play it several times. It looks like an RTS fantasy game but plays like a god game. Activision was running all of their Star Trek games along with VAMPIRE and SOLDIER OF FORTUNE. VAMPIRE continues to look terrific, with more levels and characters since it was last shown at E3.  Sierra was showing BABYLON 5, HOMEWORLD, PHAROAH, and GABRIEL KNIGHT 3. Jane Jensen, designer of all the GABRIEL KNIGHT games, told me that GK3 may be the last Sierra adventure game for quite some time, if not forever. Jane herself is going to concentrate on writing novels after GK3 is finished. Interplay had PLANESCAPE: TORMENT running along with STAR TREK NEW WORLDS. NEW WORLDS is a ground-based RTS game with no infantry the game is all hovering, armored vehicles in a nice 3D environment. As this story was going to press, though, word started leaking that the game was in trouble, and was being pulled back for serious restructuring of the campaign levels. Don't look for it anytime soon. Gathering of Developers had a new build of RUNE using the UNREAL 2 engine, but it's too early to say much about it. They were also showing DARKSTONE and AGE OF WONDERS, which keeps looking better.  Westwood was showing NOX and COMMAND AND CONQUER: PIRACY RUNS RAMPANT Gaming software piracy seems to be getting worse and worse, with cracked games appearing on the Internet the day they ship or before. Pirates are announcing the availability of cracked games on Usenet, and even offering reviews. Understand this: Pirating games is not funny, cool, or \"rebellious.\" the companies don't make money, they stop making games. Is that what you really want? Cut it out.

"Read.Me EMAIL X-COM To Invade Your Inbox This October TIBERIAN SUN, and that game now on store shelves was drawing a huge crowd of onlookers. Strategy First had CLANS and DISCIPLES on display. DISCIPLES is a HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC wannabe with deeper RPG elements and some nice spell effects. Cavedog was showing TA: KINGDOMS, and let it slip that they are working on an expansion pack for that game that will add a fifth race. New World Computing was showing the new HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC 3 expansion, minus the sci-fi scenario that got them into so much hot water with fans at E3. The Next X-Com Game Is... Email Only!? City on Fire Gen Con is much more than computer games, of course. The convention spilled over into several buildings. It was just flat-out cool to walk around and see everyone passionately gaming their hearts out. There were hundreds of MAGIC: THE GATHERING variants on display at GenCon, including a pro wrestling card game and a beer card game. Pokemon players were in full force, and they're not just kids. Wizards was also showing a beta version of a new Magic encyclopedia CD. This includes all the cards, a deck builder, all the rules from the different editions, and even a way to play over the Internet. You can play with any deck you want to make and you will get to see the card art while you play. The only catch is that the players must enforce the rules -there is no AI.

So, I'm not sure if I'm the Godfather or Godmother or Godchild. Harry's older than me and bald, so I think he should be the dad. The Latest Dirt From the Gaming Underground You want the latest? We sure do. And that's why we've contacted Mr. Sneaky again. We don't know who he is, but if you see a black helicopter hovering nearby, that's him. He uses phone taps, bloodhounds, and handwriting analysis to dig up the latest. He steams open letters, hijacks Fed Ex shipments, and fondles a Ouija board to get the scoop. He even used Kato Kaelin, but that didn't help much. The guy's spooky and allogether ooky, but he dishes the real stuff... Computer game companies are panting over the rights to base a game on the summer's hottest movie, The Blair Witch Project (take that Jar Jar!). Electronic Arts, Activision, G.O.D., and others are talking with the filmmakers. There was some initial confusion over who owned the game rights, but apparently Artisan, the film company, didn't bother to secure them when they bought Blair Witch. Rumor is that G.O.D may have the inside track. With JAGGED ALLIANCE 2 in stores and apparently a hit, Sirtech has already started work on JAGGED ALLIANCE 3, another game switching to 3D. Impressions, those Caesar and Pharoah fans, are thinking of doing a game built around vampires. Rumor is that Microsoft isn't happy with Digital Anvil's CONQUEST, a space strategy game. Seems that the game just isn't fun, so expect this to be pushed further back into 2000 as it's retooled. MS and DA are considering some changes, such as allowing players BY MR. SNEAKY to control ships, a la STAR CONTROL. Microprose is working on X-COM GENESIS, a return to the turn-based roots of the series...Xatrix, makers of KINGPIN, is rumored to be going belly-up. Interplay is trying to work out an agreement to buy them and keep them going as a studio development team. With the cancellation of A-10, the entire Janes' Skunkworks team at Origin is no longer \"wanted\" at Origin and was whacked to a man. Er, I mean they were given the opportunity to \"apply\" for open jobs around Electronic Arts, but that would mean relocation. Even star producer Andy Hollis is looking at opportunities elsewhere in EA. Speaking of cancellations, word is that Acclaim has cancelled the RPG THRONE OF DARKNESS, and that the developers, Click Entertainment, are now shopping around for a new publisher. From the file labeled \"B\" for bizarre, rumor is that Origin is working on ULTIMA ONLINE 2, which will use the ASCENSION engine. Here's the bizarre part: EA has recently increased the parental control of their on-line products, possibly so that UO2 will be able to feature consensual sex. The developers are rumored to be kicking around ideas about how to animate characters making the beast with two backs.\" If implemented: Both parties will agree to the act and then go into a private room to exercise their, um, imaginations. Heard something? Want to drop a dime on somebody? Contact Mr. Sneaky at sneaky@zd.com confidentiality guaranteed. 2. Who would be better at QUAKE? Gilligan or the Skipper? Skipper. Looks like he's spent more time in a chair than Gilligan. If you ask me, though, Lovey was the true fragmaster of that group. 3. Is the ultimate game trying to land a title on the charts? Hard to say. The \"charts\" these days means more and more \"dumbing down. If we can put out one of the very select few games each year that makes the charts because it's a great game, like HALF-LIFE, STARCRAFT or RAINBOW 6, we're thrilled. We'll never move the volume that Ford does, but that's because we make a Lexus. 4.G.O.D. and Third Law are doing a KISS game. What's next? A Backstreet Boys game? Wait and see, pal, wait and see. Third Law is making a kick ass firstperson shooter based on Todd McFarlane's KISS PSYCHO CIRCUS universe. If it weren't based on PSYCHO CIRCUS, it would still be the same amazing game. Check out the comics if you don't get how this can be cool... then just wait and see the game. Third Law will show the world how to do a licensed-property game right. We've seen plenty of examples of how to do it wrong. Tchotchke of the Month Ted Nugent Gonzo Meat Biltong \"DID YOU EAT THE BILTONG?!?\" This was the panicked cry heard throughout the CGW office on one recent unforgettable afternoon. The \"biltong\" was brought to our office by EA as part of a press demo for TED NUGENT: WILD HUNTING tong\" up in the dictionary. And life hasn't been the same here since. Those miserable souls who ate the biltong will have to live with this equation for the rest of their sad, tormented lives: Bil+ tong = buttocks + tongue. Even worse, the definition also mentions the words penis and testicles. So the best case scenario is that we ate cow ass. From \"Cat Scratch Fever\" over 20 years ago, to this. Ted Nugent is apparently determined to make us miserable for the rest of our lives. 5. Could Max Payne whip Lara Croft? He obviously could, but that's not really his style... he likes 'em spunky like that. She's been a bad, bad, girl and could use a good spankin', though. Interview by Mark Asher ADVENTURE.

"PREVIEW Tribes 2 The Tribes Return to a Bigger, Badder World by Thierry Nguyen Borse WHERE IS EVERYONE? That little Tribe fella in the lower-right corner will have a hard time finding anyone in this fog. 've heard that you can infer people's tastes from the things they create; if so, I imagine that someone who worked on TRIBES was a huge fan of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers. TRIBES has many of the elements of Starship Troopers that I wanted to play after seeing the film: brutal, fast-paced team action in slick powered TRIBES 2 armor; people GENRE: Action RELEASE DATE: Q2 '00 with big guns out in the open PUBLISHER: Sierra/Havas terrain. And its DEVELOPER: Dynamix multiple characters and customization options offer a huge variety of playing styles. So when I heard that TRIBES 2 was going to be even bigger and better, I had to see for myself. GET WET Water in TRIBES 2 means new places to hide and new tactics to learn. The Great Outdoors Unlike the games in this month's cover story, TRIBES 2 isn't designed to revolutionize gaming. The development team, based in Eugene, Oregon, just wants to create a great game and incorporate features that weren't possible the first time around. The goal is not to reinvent the wheel, but to make it bigger and faster. They've started with an all-new game engine. Although TRIBES' outdoor engine was good, TRIBES 2 has already eclipsed it. The ground terrain looks a lot smoother and more natural, instead of like a series of blocky polygons. Also, there are more natural shapes on the landscape; the mountains and hills have been accented with spires, arcs, and other geological formations. Fog is a major new landscape feature, adding more to the game than just atmosphere. The development team felt that sensor-jamming packs were underutilized in the first game, so the fog now makes sensor power and visibility more important. Not only does a sensor jammer completely mask someone in the fog, it also negates the HU N OVEMBER 1999. cw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "


"PREVIEW LEAD THE WAY, BIG BOY This concept drawing shows the sense of environmental scale that the team is going for in the map design. power of the sniper laser, since the fog disrupts the laser beam. Don't think that using the zoom-in mode will let you see other players early: you'll only see someone when they literally jump out at you from the fog. Along with enhancements to the game world, the characters now have a higher polygon count (around 1500, up from TRIBES' 600), and a new set of animations. If you're feeling good about the way you took someone out, you can dance like Deion Sanders to taunt your opponent. You'll also see a greater variety of death animations. LARGE HAIL TONIGHT The development team is hoping to include dramatic effects like this giant rock slide. TRIBES 2's Nels Bruckner also worked on RED BARON, BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, and FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL '95. Scott Rudi, designer of TRIBES EXTREME, contributed to RED BARON II, RED BARON 3D, and THE INCREDIBLE MACHINE 2. Tribal Thumping Sure, the technology looks pretty good, but what about the game itself? There will be a new race, the Bio-Derms, but the difference between the Bio-Derms and the four human tribes are mostly cosmetic. There will be more variety between the worlds this time; the five world types at the moment are Bio-Derm, Lush, Lava, Desert, and Mud. Not only do the worlds look different, but the development team is aiming to LITTLE BIG GUN The little Plasma Pistol from Tribes looks all have varying growed up. environmental effects. The lava world will have treacherous patches of lava; the lush world will be covered in fog and trees; and it'll be hard to trudge along the muddy landscape. Water will also affect gameplay. While there won't be submersible vehi. cles, going underwater will offer certain tactical advantages. The physics will be different underwater, energy weapons aren't useful, and it adds another hiding place. The team plans to tune the water physics so that you can skip discs across it. Many of the mission types will be derived from the previous game, combined with a variety of new ones. This time structures will have multiple entrances, reducing the stalemates that often occurred around TRIBES buildings. Another tweak to CTF will be multiple flags, adding a | 5 THINGS Five Things The Designers Want to Include in TRIBES 2 1. Rockets that seek out and lock onto targets. 2. The ability to skip discs along the surface of water. 3. Bridges that can be destroyed and then rebuilt, and destroyed yet again. 4. Natural weather effects (rock slides, lightning strikes, etc.). 5.

"TRIBES 2 PREVIEW YOU'RE NOT PARANOID... much more strategic angle to the action. For now, the team is concentrating on the engine and the environment. Weapons were still on the drawing board; they're brainstorming ideas for new weapons while giving the originals an overhaul. There will be more vehicles this time, with three air and four ground, up from the three air-only vehicles in the previous game. They've also tweaked the interface and the shell; there will be a built-in HTML viewer, so gamers can check TRIBES info on the Web without having to leave the game. The server listing will also have a \"buddy list\" tracker, so if you have a good gaming groove going with some players, you can easily find them again. They're also working on improving the station interface, so that gamers can get in, grab the necessary equipment, and pop back out without much delay. For those who've seen Aliens, the team plans on implementing a Command Station interface that allows a commander to view everything his teammates are doing, and give them even more direct, command-level orders. After seeing TRIBES 2, it's clear that Dynamix knows how to improve upon their initial success. The engine already looks great, and I'm excited at the prospect of playing with the new toys in an even larger world. By next summer, I'm sure you'll be suiting up to get back into the fray. CGW ..YOU ARE SURROUNDED. Tribes Extreme JOIN THE MULTI-PLAYER CONSPIRACY ONLIN FREE O FAST MING .NET SINGLE TRIBESMAN ENJOYS SUNSET WALKS TRIBES EXTREME will have new maps, structures, RIBES EXTREME is essentially and gameplay types. TRIBES 1.5. The game, which is supposed to come out in the next few weeks, uses the existing TRIBES engine and will cost about $10 for owners of TRIBES. What good is it? It adds accessibility, enhancements, and a wide variety of mission types for TRIBES fans. TRIBES EXTREME answers some of the criticism aimed at TRIBES by including a single-player campaign. It'll be three chapters with four missions per chapter. Add to that 12 new training missions, and you already have 24 full missions to play offline. HAL'S GOT A GUN If you need more There will be a new tribe called the players, or more practice, whip up some Al bots for Grievers, and the campaign throws target practice. you into the war between the Grievers and the four original tribes. The development team hopes that the singleplayer game and training missions will give newcomers a fighting chance online. The other major improvement deals with the Al bots. You can either use them to train in the multiplayer missions, or use them as pinch-hitters for team matches. When setting up your game, you can give each bot a predefined role such as \"sniper\" or \"turret-repair\" and they'll go through their routines. Enterprising gamers can also modify the bot scripts to make custom bots. Finally, TRIBES EXTREME will integrate a lot of mods and maps, to make a complete TRIBES package. One such mod is \"Kill the Rabbit\" where the Rabbit is the player with the flag and you score points by keeping hold of the flag. Or \"Freeze,\" where instead of dying, you get frozen. Being frozen locks you into observer mode, and you only become unfrozen when your entire team is frozen, or when someone pulls the unfreezing switch. The development team put out an open call for mod developers, so expect a lot of good user-created content on top of the material provided by Dynamix.

"PREVIEW WHERE IS EVERYONE? While these early shots show a depopulated World, Bioware is crafting NEVERWINTER NIGHTS from the start as an online, mulliplayer RPG. Neverwinter Nights BioWare Follows up Baldur's Gate With an Even More Ambitious D&D Game By P. Stefan \"Desslock\" Janicki and Mark Asher hardware could conceivably run their servers persistently, permitting a few dozen players to perpetually adventure in a customized gaming-world module, happily devoid of the monthly charges associated with online games like EVERQUEST. ungeons & Dragons, the pen-and-paper roleplaying system that started it all, triumphantly returned to computer gaming last year with the release of BioWare's BALDUR'S GATE. While its commercial success virtually ensured that we'll see future BALDUR'S GATE INEVERWINTER NIGHTS titles, BioWare GENRE: Role-playing  RELEASE DATE: Q4 '00 and publisher Interplay PUBLISHER: Interplay Productions Productions have DEVELOPER: BioWare Corp. for months been working on an even more ambitious D&D game, NEVERWINTER NIGHTS. Although commandeering the name used by an onlineonly D&D game that ran on America Online for years, this NEVERWINTER NIGHTS is a completely original product that will emulate tabletop D&D's modular system. NEVERWINTER NIGHTS will be released as a stand-alone single and multiplayer game, but will also come with an editor to allow players to create their own adventures. NEVERWINTER NIGHTS will allow players to host multiplayer games themselves, as opposed to relying on an online service like AOL. Gamers with the aspiration and Come to My Dungeon NEVERWINTER NIGHTS will also bridge the gap between computer and tabletop RPGs by allowing one or more players to serve as a session's Dungeon Master. DMs will be able to assume control over non-player characters and creatures, moderate combat, and even the consequences of a character's death. DMs will also be the only players able to pause gameplay, which otherwise flows in real-time. NEVERWINTER NIGHTS will use the upcoming 3rd Edition D&D rules, which re-establish a few 1st Edition character classes, remove xenophobic race limitations and restore that charismatic mongrel, the half-orc, as an available character race), and merge D&D's multi-classed and dualclassed systems into one rebalanced regime.

"PREVIEW NEVERWINTER NIGHTS WHO GOES THERE? The candles of the female warrior cast light on this forest environment in NEVERWINTER NIGHTS. ior are available role-playing options, but DMs will be able to establish whether or not player characters can harm each other, in order to prevent problem players from disrupting a game. While the developers are aiming to create a computer RPG as open-ended as its tabletop counterpart, they recognize that the anonymity of online gaming invites abuse. To grant gamers some assurance that another player isn't using an artificially-enhanced character, a \"character vault\" will be maintained by the developers. Characters can be stored within the vault between adventures and may be removed freely to embark upon quests, but can only be restored to the vault with experience and valuables that could have reasonably been accumulated during their absence. Ideally, the vault will grant stored characters some legitimacy, even if mischievous hackers find ways to bypass its security. BioWare hopes there'll be little incentive to do so, since gamers can opt to store characters on their own computers, and have the freedom to create modules stocked full of empowering artifacts and godly experience points. GOIN' DOWNTOWN NEVERWINTER NIGHTS uses the Omen engine that BioWare developed for MDK2. The top-down viewpoint is fully 30 and allows players to rotate or magnify the camera's perspective, LE MENU The game's radial menu system offers easy access to the main game controls without covering the screen. Have it Your Way Instead of recycling the BALDUR'S GATE \"Infinity\" engine, NEVERWINTER NIGHTS will use the \"Omen\" engine BioWare developed for the upcoming MDK2. The engine retains the isometric, top-down viewpoint of BALDUR'S GATE, but is fully 3D and allows players to rotate or magnify the camera's perspective. The engine is also resolution independent, permitting gamers to crank up graphical details if they have the hardware. While the hand-drawn backgrounds of BALDUR'S GATE will be missed, NEVERWINTER's tile-based system will allow the developers and creative gamers to create additional modules. Newcomers to D&D should be lured by the game's accessible interface and attractive graphics, while veterans will be enticed by the inclusion of over 200 spells and monsters, all with traits lifted exclusively from the core D&D rules. Characters can evolve up to a demigodish 20th level, which should appease the gamers who consider constant character advancement a role-playing game prerequisite. Characters will be able to wield two weapons simultaneously, disarm opponents, use targeted attacks, and engage in hand-to-hand combat all in accordance with the new D&D rules. What's missing? Not much. Characters won't be able to swim, which is an experience that shouldn't be readily available to chainmail-laden adventurers in any event. The developers are bursting with so much enthusiasm over their latest project the game's online discussion board is jammed daily with fresh commentary that it's difficult not to anticipate a truly innovative role-playing experience from NEVERWINTER NIGHTS. CGW spil Neverwinter at GenCon EVERWINTER NIGHTS was officially announced at the GenCon convention in Milwaukee this August (see story in Read. Me this month), and in between stuffing ourselves with bratwursts we checked the game out at Interplay's booth. Although the game is early in its development, the basic engine is in place. What struck us about BioWare's Omen engine wasn't how pretty it was (and it was quite striking), but how smoothly it ran. Panning the camera was effortless, rotating and zooming in and out without a hiccup. The light-sourcing seemed perfect when a character launched magic missile spells or moved while carrying a torch. One nifty new effect that the Omen engine incorporates is motion blur. Think how comic book artists draw action shots with a sword blurring as it's being swung, and you'll get an idea of what the motion blur effects look like in NEVERWINTER NIGHTS. It's a small touch, but it adds to the experience. The interface is also striking. It uses a radial menu, which looks like a clock dial, and is invisible most of the time, appearing only when you right-click to interact with something. It's an elegant solution, leaving the screen 100% free of interface clutter 95% of the time. NOVEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"PREVIEW Final Fantasy Square Finally Fixes Past Problems and Brings Back the Love by Thierry Nguyen ove doesn't work. At least, not in computer games. Every time it's attempted, it ends up being trite, clichéd, or worse. Yet, in FINAL FANTASY VIII, SquareSoft is ready to seriously tackle the theme of love and romance, in addition to the technical problems that plagued their previous PC effort in the role-playing series. The heart of every FINAL FANTASY game is the plot, but it's hard to talk too much about it without spoiling the game. Let's start with the protagonist: Squall. He's a student in The Garden, a premier military academy. As the game opens, Squall is attempting to pass an exam that will let him be part of an elite soldier unit known as Seed. Once he enters SeeD, he gets FINAL FANTASY VIII involved in a massive war GENRE: RPG  RELEASE DATE: 04 '99 between the country PUBLISHER: Square EA Galbadia and the rest of the DEVELOPER: Square Soft world. Looming in the background during all this is a witch known only as Idea. As in any other Square game, you can expect a healthy dose of intrigue, betrayal, and death of beloved characters. Deformed No More The first immediate difference between FFVIII and FFVII is the consistent character design. Gone are the Super-Deformed characters (a Japanese art style where big heads are placed on little bodies) of FFVII—now the characters are all rendered more realistically. Both the battle and magic systems have also been greatly overhauled. The one key change is the Draw system, which lets you extract spells and abilities from the enemies you encounter. Once you've \"drawn\" a spell from a target, you can either cast it immediately or store it for later. There are no magic points or spells you can permanently learn; you're always drawing spells from the enemy. Also, there is a new twist to the summoning spells (called Guardian SOLE TRAIN There will be other modes of transportation this time, but some, like this train, you can't directly control. Forces)-experience. Each of your Guardian Forces gains XP and will earn the right to learn abilities. Some abilities strengthen the existing attack, others open up new attack methods. SquareSoft wants to create a sense of growth for your Guardians, as well as a bit of customization. Unlike FFVII, you don't get Guardians by grabbing material or whatnot; you either earn them in the course of the story, or you have to defeat the Guardian in order for it to serve you. Another alteration to the battle system is a fighting-game influence. Some of the battles in FFVII felt like they were on autopilot, as you always used the same options over and over again. Now, you can enhance your attacks with proper timing. For example, if you tap the special attack key just 60 NOVEMBER 1999. cow.gamespot.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

One of the characters, a martial arts expert named Zell, has several fighting-game-style combination moves that he can pull off in battle. A few things remain the same from FFVII. The save-game scheme is the same (within specific dungeons and areas, there are save points, but out in the overworld, you can save anywhere), and the control interface is still geared primarily toward the gamepad crowd.

Musically, they are still probably going with the software synthesizer route, but they are looking toward using the emerging Downloadable Samples (DLS) idea, since many new PCI sound cards support DLS. The most visible improvements are the movies. They were formerly washed-out, stretched AVIs that lost their epic feel: now they're using a new movie format that preserves, and even enhances, the look of the original movies. Depending on your PC, the movies will play in either highor low-resolution, but the difference between the two is hardly noticeable. At press time, the core game was complete and playable; all it lacked were the movies and some text. The team hopes to go beta fairly soon and begin pounding out the bugs, for an anticipated release near the end of the year. Square looks like it has addressed the technical problems that plagued their previous PC release, allowing gamers who like a good story, and can appreciate console-style gameplay, to finally see what the FINAL FANTASY fuss is all about.

"PREVIEW ROCK IT'S A SPACE COMBAT SIM... Skilled pilots will be needed to take out enemy air support whenever you launch an assault. The missions range from a simple base assault to a grand battle between two massive carriers. How Single Trac is able to make an engine that renders spacecraft dogfights, mechanized slugfests, foot soldier shootouts, and epic space carriers all at once is beyond me. Without getting into acronymn-laden technobabble, let's just say it all works. The environment is quite detailed and accurate; carriers have functional (and usable) launch bays, turret stations, and barracks, while every building on the landscape can be demolished under enough firepower (no more hiding in buildings). All of this will be happening on a backdrop that ranges from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter to the planet surfaces themselves. IT'S A MECH SIM... One man is no match for a lumbering RAVe assault vehicle, but a team of infantry can pop the hatch, take out the crew, and claim the giant robot for themselves. 05 Communal Catastrophe Teamplay is even more important than in other games. Let's say you have a team of five. Within a single dropship. you can be the pilot, two teammates can be turret gunners, and the last two are the payload fired out of the dropship in a special torpedo they can guide themselves, plunging into a breach point to invade the enemy. Also, different player types will have different items; with the distinct player types and the various spacecraft and RAVes, balance will be a very important thing. All the campaign missions can be played co-operatively; other multiplayer plans include free-for-alls and a \"Hunted\" scenario, where one team must survive while the other tries to assassinate a specific target on the opposing team One balance-detail we immediately liked was demolitions. A demolition expert can lay down an explosive charge that can take down buildings. If you're the victim of the attempted sabotage, and you have the right equipment, you can defuse the bomb. Just break out the wire clippers, point your crosshair at the wire you want to cut, and pray. Cut the wrong wire the first time, and the timer speed doubles. Cut another wrong wire, and, well, consider enlisting elsewhere. If that wasn't enough pressure, the concussive force of a nearby blast can knock off your wireclipping aim. SingleTrac is also giving the gamers all the tools needed for creating cut scenes and missions. Enterprising designers can make entirely new maps and mission objectives, while aspiring film directors can create their own cut scenes, complete with voices. Single Trac is embarking on what could be called a kitchen-sink game. Normally, I'd be on the apprehensive side, but when I got to actually see the whole act of flying, bailing out, stealing a RAVe, wreaking havoc, then getting back on foot to blow up a building, I lost all apprehension. It's still a long way off, but ROCK looks like it can do it all without losing the focus on gameplay. CGW AND IT'S A SHOOTER, TOO Single-player missions are focused on achieving specific goals, like taking out this power core, 15 THINGS Five Nasty Tricks to Pull in ROCK 1. Crush your friends under your RAVe's foot, 2. Level an enemy building while they're still in it, and watch their bodies fly from the wreckage. 3.

"PREVIEW Firaxis Recreates the Bloodiest Day of the American Civil War by Marc Dultz Sid Meier's Antietam! Ithough American forces sustained grievous casualties at Omaha Beach, Iwo Jima, and the Ardennes during WWII, it was some 80 years prior at the Battle of Antietam-that the nation suffered its greatest losses for a single day of combat, 11,000 men. Now Firaxis Games, with the aid of FIRE! The red streaks and numerical fire indicators newly created show how much fire power you're directing at the enemy. Breakaway Games, plans on portraying the epic battle of the Republic using a refined version of their popular SID MEIER'S GETTYSBURG! game engine and a little help from the dead.

The interface has also been upgraded. The command bars have been reworked with fire effectiveness indicators, which will show players how their units are performing in battle. ANTIETAM! will also SID MEIER'S ANTIETAM feature a beefed-up GENRE: Wargame. RELEASE DATE: 04 99 AI as well as added PUBLISHER: Firaxis Games realism effects. For DEVELOPER: Breakaway Games instance, artillery will now be able to fire into tree lines or at units on the move, and can be ordered to hold fire until the enemy is within canister range. ANTIETAM! will include the previously unpublished manuscript of Ezra Carman, commander of the 13th New Jersey Volunteer infantry, which vividly recounts every aspect of the battle as seen through the eyes of a Civil War veteran. With his help, Firaxis was able to establish the exact location of each individual unit and the circumstances leading up to the fateful Union attack along the sunken road. Finally, players will be able to re-fight the entire battle, or play any of the 20-plus scenarios in the game, which will include several full and half-day battles as well as a wide variety of historical variants. ANTIETAM! will also ship with a random scenario generator that will select one of four types of engagement based partially on the player's track record. So, while it's still a couple of months off, ANTIETAM! is shaping up to become a fine wargame, and a fitting testament to the bloodiest battle America has ever fought. CGW 5 THINGS You Should Know About Antietam! 1. ANTIETAM! is being developed by Breakaway Games in association with Firaxis, the same folks who created GETTYSBURG! 2.

"PREVIEW Jane's F/A-18 Jane's Gettin' Serious... About Being Easy By Gordon Berg hird wire. Call the ball. Bolter, bolter, bolter! Utter these phrases to flight sim enthusiasts and you just might see them drool. After all, these words mean only one thing... Carrier Ops. The same team that produced last year's highly acclaimed JANE'S F-15 has now developed an in-depth naval aviation simulation. This holiday season, you'll get a chance to fly the plane that will be the cornerstone of the Navy's defense policy well into the 21st century: the F/A-18E Superhomet. Producer Greg Kreafle's team has had over a year to incorporate all of F-15's strengths while trying to eliminate its weaknesses. \"Think of it as F-15 Plus,\" Kreafle says. \"In F-15, we have pilots flying realistically in a non-accelerated time mode for a JANE'S F/A-18 half hour to an GENRE: Simulation . RELEASE DATE: Q4 '99 hour, just to get to their first way PUBLISHER: Electronic Arts point. Well, that DEVELOPER: Electronic Arts, Hunt Valley wasn't any fun. With F/A-18, flying them off the carrier means they'll be closer to the action.\" He adds, \"The key word is accessibility. We've applied that to every part of the game.\" Indeed, the real F/A-18E is a far more user-friendly aircraft than the F-15, so accurate plane modeling alone makes the sim accessible to a wider audience. For example, the avionics are greatly simplified, making it easier to operate the weapon systems. As Kreafle says, \"It has a simpler interface because the state of the art has advanced over the past 25 years since the F-15 was designed, so we get all the benefit of that by trying to recreate it as realistically as possible.\" Many simulations, F-15 included, offer a casual flight model as well as an authentic one. With the Superhornet, there's no need: The real aircraft is that much easier to fly. The plane has greater \"dogfighting\" capabilities than the F-15, and it also has some built-in constraints to ensure the pilot won't lose control. \"You can't over-G the airplane,\" explains Kreafle. \"You'd be lucky to pull 7-1/2 Gs. Beyond that, the system relinquishes control authority. You can't depart flight with it, either.\" That's true. In the beta I tested, I was unable to put the plane into a spin, managing only a brief stall that quickly corrected itself. As far as the campaign goes, there is much greater emphasis on player immersion. The missions you fly are interspersed with video clips about 15 seconds in length, which indicate your progress via positive or negative feedback. The end result is a story that unfolds to truly involve the player in the action. Yes, the number of F-18 simulations in the marketplace are starting to rival those of the F-22, but we're talking classic Jane's stuff here. I, for one, can't wait. CGW Elect. Eject! A MiG driver is left flying by the seat of his pants as his ride corkscrews to the sea. BOLTER You'll soon get your chance to land the Navy's best jet on a target the size of a football field. 15 THINGS You Should Know About Jane's F/A-18 1. The hefty Jane's manual is back, and it will be easier to read. Look for over 400 pages! 2. Over 2.5 million square kilometers will be modeled, based on U.S.G.S. data. 3. Fly one giant campaign, or jump into the action at three separate phases. 4. The Superhornet is no speed demon. The F-15 is actually faster, but the F/A-18 is more maneuverable. 5.

"abe Ruth's power single-handedly changed baseball. Janis Joplin's banshee wail tipped the emotional balance of rock. And Jobs' and Wozniack's gamble on the Apple took computing from a technological priesthood and put it into the hands of the people. Trailblazers like these reshaped the world in their image. They \"thought different,\" and forced those who followed to do the same. And that's how we feel about the following five games. Whether through pioneering graphics technology, innovative new design concepts, or redefining what can be considered a game at all, these five will leave ripples that will be felt throughout the industry for years to come. FREELANI Chris Roberts Sets His Sights on the Big One by George 5 GAMES THAT WILL CHANGE GAMING onsider Texas, a state so enamored with the enormous that even Austin, a city very low on the Texas-ometer, buys into the big. Wanting a bigger airport, this city chose not to simply expand their current facilities, but to build an entirely new airport five miles down the road. This bigger-is-better mentality must be part of what keeps Chris Roberts in Austin. After all, it's a good fit-his favorite games are enormously large, epic, big-splash titles with high production values, envelope-pushing technologies, and a massive sense of scale. Games like FREELANCER. In FREELANCER, Roberts is setting his sites on the holy grail of computer games: A game with unparalleled visual and cinematic style that is totally and completely open-ended, but also features a compelling central story. And, oh yeah, it should also be fun and accessible to the masses. CONCENTRATED ATTACK FREELANCER shucks the joystick in favor of a mouse-drive mode of play that emphasizes the fun aspects of space combat. A FLYING START FREELANCER's tone and visual power are illustrated simply and powerfully. The very first scene Roberts showed us-an overhead view of a bustling space portemphasized the fact that, although this space sim uses plot and gameplay elements that have existed since ELITE, Digital Anvil's take on the genre will be something special.

"COVER STORY 5 CAMES SIMPLY MASSIVE Exploring space in FREELANCEA makes you feel very, very small: Jones fly between skyscrapers or landing platforms, and the cities themselves are very stylistically and dramatically represented. More reminiscent of Star Wars than even the LucasArts' Star Wars games, this one scene conveys the scope of what Roberts is trying to accomplish here-a detailed, dynamic, living world. You begin play as a lowly mercenary, indentured to the House Liberty, the allAmerican good-guy clan in the game. Getting hooked up with this clan at the start means that you'll have plenty of protection in your early missions, at least until the plot gives you the chance to join up with other houses. As part of your indentured servitude, House Liberty supplies you with your first spacecraft-the futuristic equivalent of a 1979 Pinto. It gets the job done, but you're going to be very excited to earn enough money to put yourself into something a bit fancier. WE'RE APPROACH ING OUR FINAL DESTINATION Space never felt so roomy...or looked so...stellar! NOW THAT'S FANCY FREELANCER's sense of grandeur is reinforced the moment you fly through the massive metallic accelerator that boosts you out of planetary space into an outer space so colorful and dramatic, it looks like it was photographed by the Hubble telescope.

"COVER STORY-5 GAMES DOWNTOWN...WHERE THE ACTION IS Every port of call in FREELANCER features unique, detailed scenery that would make Las Vegas jealous. by placing the fundamental ship maneuvering and navigation under the control of your Neuronet. You move your mouse around to target and fire on enemy ships, select your weapons, and fine-tune your position and velocity. Holding down the Shift key allows you to freelook with your mouse and fire on anything you see. Holding down the Control key allows you to take over the controls and maneuver your ship in any direction. The wildcard in all this is the Neuronet-part interface manager, part onboard computer, and part pilot. It serves as your navigational aid, allowing you to plot coordinates for travel and check on your cargo. More crucially, it performs critical maneuvers during combat and can be upgraded with a variety of increasingly effective tactics to make it more combat-ready. Space fights consist of you blasting away with your mouse and ordering your ship into various maneuvers via the Neuronet. Want to get on a bogie's tail and blast him into dust? Select the Trail command, which will order your ship to attempt to get on the bogie's six. Getting pounded? Order your ship to Evade, and, depending on the quality of your Neuronet, you will alleviate the pain. Most interesting about this new take on ship-to-ship combat is the almost DIABLO-style element of play FREELANCER sets up. As you gain more money, prestige, and power, you'll be able to power-up your Neuronet with new or upgraded maneuvers. Or buy entirely new Neuronets that are more advanced. Maybe you'll even discover amazingly sophisticated upgrades left behind by the ancient space-faring race who inhabited the area before you. You'll also be able to trade these maneuvers to your friends in the multiplayer game. SRL REN rates a sense of scale and attention to detail that will most likely set a new standard for virtual worlds. At one point, we flew around and through an enormous research station that seemed about 100 times the size of our ship. We also flew through a gorgeous, purplish gassy, lighteningstrewn nebula that created a particularly eerie effect. And in a scene that illustrated the amount of detail being put into the game, we flew past a fully operational ore-mining unit. As we flew up close, you could see the ship doing its ore-crunching the large pincer hands breaking off chunks of ore, which were then sucked into the craw of the ship. Eventually your lovely little sight-seeing excursion is going to get interrupted by space pirates or a rival house. Then you'll see another part of FREELANCER, one that takes a sharp turn from normal space combat. Roberts and company are throwing out the joystick as a controller and focusing on making the game playable with a unique mouse-and-keyboard interface. This fits in squarely with the FREELANCER design team's mission of focusing on the purely fun parts of space combat, which means avoiding the constant 180-degree turning battles so common in space sims, where you line up a bogey, pass them after narrowly avoiding a head-on collision, and repeat. FREELANCER completely avoids this MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER FREELANCER's multiplayer game, which will be sold separately from the main game, will be a massively multiplayer universe where thousands of players will be able to fly around and interact with each other in a variety of capacities. Digital Anvil envisions a dynamic, socially-oriented game that features the single-player game's politics and clans as a backdrop. This multiplayer game will also permit you to be allied with one of the main houses in the game, or to go it alone. Digital Anvil is committed to maintaining a meta story that will keep the game more focused. At one point, you might log in and hear about a big war between the Kusari and House Liberty. This could mean several different things to you; you might want to join in the war effort as a paid mercenary. Or you might deduce that war around certain planets means that certain goods might command top dollar on that planet, and you'll hire some of your friends to escort you on a money-making trade mission. Perhaps the coolest potential feature in multiplayer is the ability to own your own base. The game will feature a finite number of bases that can be taken over and controlled by human factions. The most unfortunate aspect of FREELANCER is the fact that we'll have to wait until late 2001 to play it. CGW CHRIS ROBERT'S GAMEOGRAPHY Times of Lore Genre: Action Strike Commander Release Date: 04 01 Publisher: Microsoft Wing Commander I IV Developer: Digital Anvil CHRIS ROBERTS \"Sure, the latest 3D shooters look pretty, but what new gameplay do they offer? Where are they taking the genre beyond having prettier rooms and more detailed characters? Too many of the game publishers seem to be going with safe bets: the latest sequel; a sports game with the latest team stats; an RTS game with a few different kinds of units; or another first-person shooter that differs only in its look. I've been far more impressed with the game design that's been going on in the console market. Games like METAL GEAR SOLID and ZELDA 64 have really blown me away by their design and the way the technical gee-whiz factors are used to enhance gameplay. There have been a few exceptions in the PC biz: GRIM FANDANGO and HALF-LIFE stood out last year.\" 90 NOVEMBER 1999. gw gamespot.com  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"COVER STORY-5 GAMES HALO The Closest Thing to the Real Thing by Jesse Hiatt POSTCARD MATERIAL Don't get so distracted looking at the groovy scenery that you get yourself smoked. ATTACK! There will probably be a lot of good reasons to use combined arms. arm could be reacting naturally to the recoil of his pistol, and his head could be turning to track an enemy. This kind of dynamic, fluid movement and attention to detail is unheralded on many levels. The effects are mind-blowing. And then there are the vehicles themselves. Driving around in the game's jeep could practically qualify as a game in itself, due to the extremely-detailed physics model (think GRAND PRIX LEGENDS off-road). The vehicles' tires kick up pebbles and dust that change color depending on the terrain you're driving over. Bungie also displayed an iridescent flying vehicle and hover tank that were equally impressive. As one final demonstration of the engine's power, Jones zoomed the map way out so that the marine appeared as just a speck in the distance. Then he smoothly zoomed in, close enough that I could read an indicator on the side of the sol dier's rifle that showed how much ammo remained. The standard soldier's weapons are a pistol with a built-in laser for painting targets, an assault rifle with an attached grenade launcher, and a machete for desperate situations. We also saw a cool zooming sniper rifle, a rocket launcher that leaves realistic smoke trails behind it that dissipate into the wind, a surface-to-air missile, a spear gun, and a funkylooking defoliator weapon. The aliens pretty much have an equivalent weapon for each purpose, but they shoot blue energy beams instead of familiar, earthly ordinance.

A theoretically feasible science-fiction construct, a ring-world is a thin ring of planetary mass thousands of miles across, with an inner surface coated with desirable life-supporting essences like an atmosphere, dirt, trees, and water. Because of the ring-world's unique halo orbit at the Lagrange Point between a gas giant and one of its moons, this freakish world actually spins in place, with the resultant inertia creating an effect similar to gravity (remember the space station in 2001?).

The game opens with an idyllic world, a tiny island practically glowing with lush vegetation. Your goal is simple: Get the whole world to believe in you and worship you as their god. You the player are manifested as an elegantly simple, all-powerful hand hovering above the earth. Not wanting to break the illusion of the gameworld with buttons, tabs, and menu screens, the designers have made the hand the entirety of your interface. You'll grab spells from your citadel and cast them with a wave, and you'll move through the world by \"grabbing\" parts of the landscape and \"pulling\" the world until your destination reaches you. While you cannot interact directly with the primitive tribes peppering the landscape, you can influence their lives indirectly. Spells allow you to rain down literal manna from heaven to feed starving tribes or to rip their fragile villages with vicious ribbons of lightning. Either approach will convince the tribesmen that there is something greater out there, and they will begin to worship you, either out of fear or out of adoration, and therein lies the heart of the game. Do you model yourself after Kali, the Indian black goddess who ate her own children, or the more benevolent, Christian New Testament God? It's the sort of decision games have rarely addressed.

What is interesting here is that you use the creature from your saved game online; any. thing that happens to it will be carried back to your ongoing solo campaign. Even more remarkable is Molyneux's plan for BLACK & WHITE'S online community, where players will be able to take their creatures online to interact with each other in a primarily non-combative setting. The creatures will learn from each other they could pick up bad habits, or they might learn a new, special attack. Again, this new knowledge will be carried back to the single-player game where you'll have to deal with their slightlyaltered personality. BLACK & WHITE should simply be like no other game, ever. Yes, it's graphically gorgeous, but it's the free-flowing, individualized play that is most tantalizing. It's an awful lot of ambition to shoehorn onto one CD-ROM, but if anyone can do it, Molyneux and Lionhead Studios can. CGW Still, I absolutely don't consider this to be the definitive word on \"god games.\" All genres have much more in them yet to be discovered. While the complexity of the level of detail in BLACK & WHITE marks a big step forward, it still could be improved upon. \"I hope to foster a huge online community. There will simply be no other experience like BLACK & WHITE GATHERING, because of the diversity and individuality of all the creatures. At the moment my creature is bordering on the very evil side, but my excuse for this is that I have to abuse him and the world around him to test the game.

"COVER STORY 5 GAMES hat is the appeal of the Skinner box that is the home? Security, tranquility, the sense of wholeness that can only come by surrounding yourself with those you love? Nah. I think it's more along the lines of an old Steve Martin routine in which he entertained thoughts of raising a child and teaching said offspring all the wrong words for everything. He relished the thought of a child raising his hand the first day of school and asking. \"May I moo dog-face to the banana patch?\" This is the appeal of THE SIMS, the ultimate expression of the entire SIM franchise, a game where you can run amok with the lives of people, without running the risk of jail for child abuse through enforced idioglossia. Maxis, the company that practically created the so-called \"software toy\" genre with SIMCITY, is now preparing to deliver the ultimate toy-human lives. Social Darwinism Made Easy by Robert Coffey SIMS BIRTH OF AN ARTIFICIAL NATION Seven years ago, Maxis founder Will Wright was toying with an architectural sim, a nice little program that would let people create their own virtual dream homes. But other products (most notably SIMCITY 2000) distracted Wright and the rest of his team until about two and a half years ago. When production once again resumed on what Maxis had been calling SIM DOLLHOUSE it was with one significant change the focus of the game had moved from the aluminum siding of the homes to the lives of the dolls within. Anyone who's played any of the SIMCITY games knows just how pesky the virtual people inhabiting those digital metropolises can be; whether moaning about taxes or whining for a sports stadium, the \"Sims\" were a difficult BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE Random events like burglaries and fires will add more life events for your Sims to deal with. BETTER HOMES & GARDENS A simple, intuitive interface makes home creation a snap, with floor design, door and window placement, and surface textures readily applied with the click of a mouse. EVERYTHING BUT A PINATA A variety of recreational objects will facilitate social intercourse and help you entertain your friends. You'll even be able to select the music you play on the stereo. 106 NOVEMBER 1999. cgw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

Happily, they remain just as challenging in THE SIMS, thriving only when players tend to the minutest details of their lives. One of the most remarkable things about the game is how the design team has distilled gameplay to three basic functions building, buying, and living and yet managed to pack so much of the real world into those seemingly limiting specifications.

Designing your own home is a remarkably intuitive process, using a simple click-and-drag interface to plop down floors, walls, windows, doors, and anything else you feel your home needs.

"COVER STORY 6 GAMES GOOD 5 EVIC on Gilbert has a story to tell us. It is an epic story of Theroes and villains, of good and evil. It is a story of a town in trouble, of a mighty warrior who Ron Gilbert Returns for an Epic, Comic RPG by Jeff Green comes to save the day. If anyone else were telling this story, we know what would happen next. We've all heard it many times before. Too many times. But this is a story by Ron Gilbert, a man who has created some of the funniest and best-loved computer games ever. So what happens next, in his story. is this: the warrior arrives in town, trips over a drainage ditch, impales himself on his own sword, and dies. Now they need a new hero. This is about all we're going to spill of the plot of GOOD AND EVIL, Ron Gilbert's new RPG/adventure, because to tell more would spoil things. All you really need to know is that one of gaming's best designers has something new up his sleeve, and if everything goes his way, it's going to change the way we think about role-playing games. FATHER OF SCUMM Gilbert's goals are high, but fortunately for him, he has a career-long habit of setting new standards whenever he invents a game. At LucasArts in the mid-'80s, he created hilarious comic masterpieces like MANIAC MANSION and MONKEY ISLAND 1 AND 2, and in the process essentially invented the point-and-click adventure (with his legendary SCUMM engine) as well as the cut-scene. Later, as cofounder of Humongous Entertainment, Gilbert completely redefined kids' games with the megapopular PUTT-PUTT, FREDDI FISH, and PAJAMA SAM franchises, which offer brilliantly scaleddown adventure games for young kids. Most recently, Gilbert helped start up Humongous' Cavedog subdivision, whose first title was the wildly popular TOTAL ANNIHILATION. Now Gilbert is again working on what his many fans have craved for years-a new comic story to savor. But it's not an adventure game, it's a role-playing game with a classic fantasy setting, with a plot and environments that will veer wildly as Gilbert unravels his involving story. And it is his story, not yours. There is no pretending that you are the main character. \"You're just not,\" says Gilbert. \"He has a personality, and it's not your personality. But the choices you make are going to help shape him, and shape the experience of the game.\" The focus on a specific character, with a distinct personality, is rooted in Gilbert's belief that story evolves from character and not the other way around. \"In a lot of the RPGs, it doesn't seem to matter which character I pick-they all say the same thing. I look at the character on screen, and I look at the dialog, and I think, 'why would this person ever say this? LOONY TUNESNA to be expected fro a game Ror Gilbert, GOOD ANO EVIL wille populated by an assortment on ridiculous characters. TIL NOVEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "


"COVER STORY-5 GAMES A WHOLE NEW WORLD For GOOD AND EVIL's look, Gilbert is striving to create a 3D world that is appropriate both for the game's comic sensibility and its role-playing underpinnings. providing enough randomness and diversity to keep gamers coming back for more-unlike the finality of most adventures and RPGs.\" The game will be combat-intensive, and you will die if you fail, unlike in Gilbert's previous games. It's going to be a relatively simple system, not dependent on the learning of fancy combo moves; it will be dependent largely on how well your character was equipped and skilled before going into battle. THE END GOOD AND EVIL is still a good year away, and a lot may change, including the title. But we confidently included it here because of Gilbert's incredible Midas touch, which makes anything he creates a mustplay experience. We'll let him have the last word. \"Why did I make this game? There are things about adventure games that I really love, and I wanted to I look at the dialog, and I think 'why would this person ever say this?' Characters just become the thief' or 'the archer' but don't have real personalities.\" I'M FUNNY HOW? As you'd expect from the MONKEY ISLAND Creator, GOOD AND EVIL is going to use lots of humor--much of it directed at role-playing conventions. Characters will talk amongst themselves about \"leveling up.\" for example, while the plentiful dialog and ridiculous characters, like an evil crow, will retain Gilbert's absurdist bent. But alongside the humor is going to be a serious role-playing game. As he put it, \"If I just do a funny story but it's not a good RPG.... I'm dead. So all the things you're used to seeing, they're there. They're all taken very seriously.\" Largely inspired by LEGEND OF ZELDA, Gilbert is designing a large, fully-3D world to be played in third-person perspective; it will be open enough for gamers to explore on their own, in a non-linear fashion, while simultaneously keeping things storybased. Depending on the choices you make, and on how much you choose to explore, gamers will have different experiences while still receiving the same major plot points. \"To me, the perfect game is like you kinda get through it and are done in a few hours, but then you can go back and play it over and over and always pull something new out of it. To me, that's a lot more interesting than slogging through 150 hours of gameplay just to get to the end of a story. The ultimate goal is to tell a cohesive story while still put those things into another type of game. What I hope this will do is completely raise the bar as to what story and dialog have to be in a role-playing game. My big fantasy dream is that once you've played an RPG with a great story and well-written dialog, Genre: RPG you'll never want to go Release Date: Q3 2000 back again.\" CGW Publisher: GT Interactive Developer: Cavedog RON GILBERT GILBERT'S GAMEOGRAPHY KORONIS RIFT \"To me, one of the most important things in the world Is stories.

"BLASTS FROM THE PAST ate to break it to you like this, but good games don't go to heaven when they die. Nope, there's no eternal bliss for the greats of gaming's classic age, no angelic host of perfect and eternal players; there's just a sort of fading purgatory of fond memories in the minds of aging gamers. It's a damn shame. Although most games from days gone by deserve their increasing obscurity, there are a bunch of gems in the rubbish pile that, with a bit of graphics polish and some tweaks to design, could shine in all their former glory. Bring back the love, we say! Let the classics live again! We rummaged through our memories-the few that have survived the senile dementia-and came up with this list of oldies but goodies that we think deserve another chance. We've also picked some contemporary game designers and development houses who we think have the stuff to do right by these classics. RACING DESTRUGTION SET GAMES THAT NEED TO BE REMADE AND THE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE TO MAKE THEM ELECTRONIC ARTS, 1986 ACING DESTRUCTION SET was one game in a series of Construction Sets released by Electronic Arts in their 80s heyday. We'd love to see the concept of do-it-yourself games make a comeback. But we'd be happy with the racing game for starters. In RACING CONSTRUCTION SET, you built a slot-car racing track from scratch. You designed the track; placed jumps, mines, and oil slicks; designed your cars; and even adjusted the physics of the world. Then you'd take your slot cars for a spin. For the remake, we'd pick the hottest car game group on the planet, the Electronic Art group responsible for the latest NEED FOR SPEED. Our demands are simple: We want a detailed and easy-touse track editor with all the bells-jumps, loops, banks, and a bag of obstacles to sprinkle around. We want a car editor that lets us build a car from tires to trans. We want to be able to screw with the physics. Then, we want to be able to hop into a car and make a wreck of it. And we want a movie editor. Tomorrow. That's all. By Chris Lombardi and the CGW Staff m m DITED GAMING WOD "


"BLASTS FROM THE PAST SEVEN GITIES OF THE excesiionis on land GOODS 370 En FOOD GOL 2 268 ELECTRONIC ARTS, 1983 EVEN CITIES OF GOLD was the game that changed a few of us at CGW from boys to gamers. A tiny ship. A handful of terrified men. And an entire hemisphere to discover. It was a great setup and brilliantly executed for its time. As cheesy as the graphics were, and as simplistic as the design was, SEVEN CITIES worked. It made exploring a map fun. And it was brilliantly paced. The long periods of peaceful exploration were punctuated by tense interactions with natives. This remake is a natural for Ensemble Studios, the creators of AGE OF EMPIRE.S And they've got a readymade name: Age of Exploration. Let us explore a huge, beautiful map on the same scale of the AOE games. Let us establish settlements in the RTS-base building style, but don't force us to micromanage the settlements; give us a good settlement-management AI. There needs to be some PACE: MODERATE TERRAIN: 0222age competition, too: Rival nations with explorers and conquistadors racing to find the new natural wonders and resources randomly but realistically spread across the world. But we don't want the game to turn into yet another RTS game. Exploration is the focus. Get it right, guys, or we'll hammer you mercilessly in the review. PIRATES! MICROPROSE, 1987 f anyone has approached perfection in a game design it was Sid Meier with PIRATES. Even with its dated graphics, the game still holds up today. MicroProse made a half-assed attempt at an update in the early 90s, but they only marginally improved the graphics and didn't touch the gameplay. The game and gamers deserve a visual revamping, and some of the weaker game ele. ments could benefit from recent advances in RTS design. PIRATESI had it all-action, strategy, adventure game elements, real time wargaming, history. In the course of living through the career of a pirate on the Spanish Main, you fought ship-to-ship cannon battles, clashed swords with enemy captains, searched for treasure and the members of your scattered family, married the daughters of goverors, and managed the logistics of maintaining a crew. You could even fight real-time land battles (though they weren't very good-the only flaw in an otherwise perfect design), and relive the historical careers of famous pirates. For our remake dream-team we'd pick Blizzard as the main design group, since they're so good at real-time games and do a great job of creating rich universes around them. We'd bring in the PRINCE OF PERSIA team to develop the sword-fighting sequences. We'd have Ensemble's Bruce Shelley, gaming's Mr. Peabody, consult on the historical details and manual. And maybe we could find something for that Sid guy to do. MULL PLANETFALL ELECTRONIC ARTS, 1983 alk to any wheezing gaming geezer and he'll probably drone on and on about M.U.L.E., a brilliant little multiplayer game a decade ahead of its time. M.U.L.E. was essentially a family board game set on an undeveloped planet. Players bid on land parcels, developed those parcels to produce the game's resources, and then moved those resources around the game board using their M.U.L.E., a Multiple Use Labor Element. The design was tight and the opportunities to screw other players were plentiful. New World Computing is the perfect choice for a remake. They've got boardgaming roots and the right sense of humor. We'd skip the boxed version and single-player game and go directly to Internet. And while they're in the right frame of mind, New World can bring back their hilarious multiplayer board game, NUCLEAR WAR. INFOCOM, 1984 f all the Infocom text adventures that could be revived, we choose PLANETFALL because it was one of the most popular. But we don't really care which ones gets remade-THE LURKING HORROR, TRINITY, MIND FOREVER VOYAGING-all we care about is a good story, great writing, and mature themes. All they had was text, so the Infocom authors did text very well. We miss their writing, boy, do we miss it. For our Infocom remake we'd team up the two current masters of storytelling, Tim Shaefer of LucasArts and Ron Gilbert of Cavedog. We'll take the LucasArts artists, too. Throw them in the basement for a year and prepare to hear a tale. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  cgw.gamespot.com. NOVEMBER 1999 119 "

We want, no, need a super-hero game, and we need it now! The concept is a no-brainer, a natural, but no one has ever been able to pull it off. We're going to give Peter Molyneax another shot at the INDESTRUCTIBLES. But this time, Peter, dump the first-person action game idea. Rather, think SYNDICATE and isometric perspective. We want a nice character creation and development system that will let us pick and choose super-hero traits and personalities. We want a butt-load of cool animations of superhero powers and environmental effects. We want to play multiplayer over the Net. We want to prance around in pretty underwear, shouting \"Zoiks and away!\" Is that so wrong? ARCHON MARBLE MADNESS ATARI, 1984 million arcade games could be remade, but we choose MARBLE MADNESS because it was so original, and the concept could easily be expanded. The basic idea for you youngsters: You played a marble who rolled around a weird 3D world full of traps and puzzles and \"bad\" marbles that would bump you off the world and into oblivion. It was different, it was challenging, it was fun. We give the redesign task to the master of arcade weirdness and funness: Shigeru Miyamoto, designer of DONKEY KONG, MARIO BROS., ZELDA, and other classics. We can't wait to see the bizarre maps, characters, and traps with which he'd litter the little marble's world. And he'd probably figure out a way to turn a lifeless sphere into a character worthy of lunch boxes and a cartoon series. We'd also commission a special rolling-ball controller from CH Products to completely recreate the feel of the original. ELECTRONIC ARTS, 1983 hess and the arcade game. Who'd a thunk. ARCHON blended this unlikely pair into a brilliant hybrid of action and strategy. The strategic portion was a very slight variant on chess: two rows of characters faced-off on an alternating black and white grid. But when the characters met on a square, they dropped into an arcade battle. For the remake, we'd keep the strategic game the same-spruced up graphically, BATTLECHESS-style. But for the characteron-character battles, we'd use the latest QUAKE engine to create the 3D battlefields. The kicker is the online play. We'd love to see a setup whereby people could play different roles: You'd have your strategians playing the chess game, while twitch gamers fought gladiator duels in a first-person action mode. As for design, we're going to keep this one for ourselves. We're currently working on the technology to transfer our cocktail napkin \"design docs\" into digital form. And we've still to convince Thierry \"Scooter\" Nguyen to change his major from English to computer science. But these are minor issues. With Jeff Green as project director, we're confident we'll have this one online for Christmas \"23. NEUROMANCER ARCHON   House of Pong GOPROPERTIAVE r 85 INTERPLAY, 1988 nterplay did a great job with William Gibson's novel in their game adaptation. They captured many of the seminal Jooo 117197 09 1 scenes, designed clever puzzles, and did a decent job with the difficult task of making battles with computer Als interesting. But the Apple II just couldn't deliver the gritty visuals suggested by the novel, and the adaptation of Gibson's dialogue for the game left something to be desired. The game was just far too cartoony. For the remake, we give the job to DreamForge, in particular, to the team that put together the award winning SANITARIUM. They've proven that they can do dark and moody, and they have a rare gift among game developers-an ear for dialogue and compelling narrative. Go at it guys. We want to be walking the streets of Chiba by summertime. MAGIC CARPET The sensation of flight on a magic carpet was so good it could, literally, make you puke. And the visual effects of the spells, like the Earthquake spell that could rip a continent in two before your eyes, were stupefying. MAGIC CARPET deserves another flight through the gaming world with the benefits of 3D acceleration. There are a lot of groups that could take this project on. But having just seen the 3D engine of HALO, we think Bungie deserves the draw. The HALO engine is capable of everything the MAGIC CARPET engine pulled off and a whole lot more. So finish up HALO realquick like, guys, and take us on another MAGIC CARPET ride. CGW BULLFROG, 1994 NOVEMBER 1999. cw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"ADVENTURE/RPG REVIEW COMPUTER Irrational Games Make Big Noise With Sequel to Quiet Classic RAMING Successful Shock EDITORS EDITORS CHOICE HANGING AROUND That minimap in the top right corner will capably lead you to ghoulish sites like this one. ontrary to popular gaming lore, the original SYSTEM SHOCK sold over 170,000 copies and was not a commerU cial failure. But it is true that when initially released in 1994, Looking Glass's ground-breaking game was overlooked by a lot of gamers, although greeted with favorable reviews. Some gamers erro neously dismissed it as a DOOM clone, even though it was actually the offspring of a line of games that preceded any of id Software's first-person shooters. SYSTEM SHOCK defied pigeon-hole classification because it borrowed elements from a variety of genres. Yet it is precisely because of its creative design that reviewed by P. Stefan \"Desslock\" Janicki it is now commonly, belatedly, regarded as one of the better games ever made. Irrational Games was given the task of creating a worthy successor to the cult classic original, but the good news is that they responded by delivering a game that both retains the best attributes of SYSTEM SHOCK while providing a fresh gaming experience. SYSTEM SHOCK 2 AND HANGING OUT Most corpses are worth searching for useable stuff.

"REVIEW SYSTEM SHOCK A BRAND NEW ME Should you do the unthinkable and die, you may be able to bio-reconstruct yourself, if you have enough nanites lying around. game elements are deeper than in the first game, as you're able to personalize your character's initial attributes and abilities and subse. quently update them. The game looks and generally feels like a first person shooter, but the RPG elements and detailed environments give gameplay more depth. Unlike a shooter, you'll find it hard to be successful in SYSTEM SHOCK 2 if you storm into every room, guns blazing. For good portions of the game the ammunition is scarce, forcing players to warily advance through dark hallways and lean around corners to look for resources and opportunities to dispatch foes. Even solitary enemies can be dangerous opponents, especially early in the game, and travel through the genuinely creepy surroundings often slows to a crawl as a result of the need for caution. Carelessly trekking into an unscouted room can alert a security camera and result in your character's quick death, courtesy of a legion of enemies or a well-positioned laser turret. Hackers beware. I WIN! A nice Vegas moment in an otherwise very spooky environment Sly Engine SYSTEM SHOCK 2's engine is well equipped for such stealthy maneuvering, consisting essentially of an enhanced version of Looking Glass's Dark Engine, created for THIEF: THE DARK PROJECT, combined with some of the better interface features and controls of the original SYSTEM SHOCK. The engine's 3D-accelerated graphics are capable of producing plausible, futuristic environments, and its fogging and lighting effects look particularly good. The engine seems less capable of depicting characters, as humanoid fig. ures look crafted from a fusion of rudimentary polygonal shapes, masked by a decent texture map. Since there's plot justifications for irregularly shaped beings, and since most of the game's settings are extremely dark, the relatively simplistic character models work fine, even if they're not as detailed as action gamers now expect. The music is appropriately atmospheric but the game's crisp sound effects deserve particular praise. Environmental audio is a supported feature that's used to great effect. Straining in the darkness to detect the distant whirring noise of a security camera, the haunting drone of a hybrid, or the misleading banter of a protocol droid becomes an essential tactic. It's great stuff, and contributes significantly to the tense overall mood. One of the best aspects of THIEF's engine was that it tracked how noisy and how visible (based upon surrounding lighting) your charac ter was, and ensured that enemy Al responded accordingly. Those details have been ported intact to SYSTEM SHOCK 2. Stomping hap. hazardly through a well-lit area while blasting a shotgun will attract considerably more attention than in an action shooter or in down town L.A., for that matter. Don't expect to be able to open the door to one room, deal with its inhabitants, and then calmly open the next door to do likewise. If any creatures are within earshot of combat, they'll try to join the fun, mak. ing it important to choose your fights carefully. The enemy Al is very WHO YA GONNA CALL? Spooky apparitions reenacting recent events is the game's primary means of advancing the plot. MR. SNEAKY Stealth is your friend. Move carefully, and you can sneak behind enemies and clobber 'em before they have time to react. 134 NOVEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "


"REVIEW WINTER WONDERLAND Don't lie down in a pile of snow. Those shiny baubles to the left of the body are pretty valuable. good, as even basic grunts charge after you instead of haplessly lumbering in pursuit, while certain deadly opponents will try to stick to shadows, where they'll launch barely visible rapid-fire attacks. SYSTEM SHOCK 2's interface is very well designed, with a simple click of the mouse allowing you to switch between the game's two modes Shoot mode, used for moving and engaging enemies; and Use mode, which freezes your view as in an adventure game, where you can explore the environment, use inventory items, and access your PDA. To help you navigate, you can superimpose semi-transpar ent compass directions over your viewing window, pull up an automap, or maintain a miniature version of it onscreen. Since your character is supposed to be grafted with a variety of cybernetic implants, there's a reasonable explanation for your character's ability to pull up HUD information, such as the digital compass or an TOYS R US You'll have a battery of goodies at your disposal, including the usual pile of weaponry and a PDA that logs your mission goals. NVENTORY COME ON IN, THE RADIATION'S FINE! The graphic engine is capable of some good fogging and lighting effects. K* assessment of an enemy's hit points. Thus, the interface actually contributes to the gaming world's ambiance, instead of detracting from it. SPANKING THE MONKEY These happy fellows may surprise you when you first meet them. Character Difficulties Your character is initially trained in one of three branches of the UNN, acquiring the skills and attributes of either an officer of the OSA (emphasizing psionic powers), marines (weapon skills), or the navy (a combination of weapon skills, hacking, and other technical abilities). The professions don't add as much depth as you might otherwise suspect, since during the course of the game you can develop any skills or attributes regardless of your initial profession. The professions are very unbalanced, especially at the beginning of the game when the cybermodules used to upgrade your character are extremely rare. It's almost impossible to survive without picking up at least a smattering of weapon and technical skills, and since navy characters start the game with those abilities, they have a huge advantage. Marines are essentially navy characters that have been stripped of technical skills. OSI characters are Luddites that lack both weapons and technical skills and are initially extremely fragile; there are very few items that allow them to replenish their psionic powers. I suspect almost all players will develop characters with a mix of PSI, technical, and weapons skills, so that instead of adding meaningful depth, your initial character election is essentially just a hidden additional difficulty setting. During the course of the game you can develop truly different characters who are capable of successfully completing the game, but the initial selection between professions isn't relevant in the manner it was intended. Lastly, even though the game features a novel setting and con tains significant RPG elements, gameplay doesn't evolve significant ly beyond that of recent first-person shooters. You'll spend much of your time firing at enemies around corners, opening crates, and engaging in key hunts that demand meticulous exploration But the realistic environments, intriguing plot, and creepy atmos. phere make SYSTEM SHOCK 2 compelling throughout. A patch is planned to add a cooperative multiplayer mode to give the game additional longevity. Like the original classic, this is a hybrid game that effectively blends a variety of genres into a thoroughly enjoyable, accessible package.

Magic potions will restore your health, make you invisible, and so on. Special crystals also add to your destructive arsenal. More than 50 weapons are included for Rynn, from rusty axes to magical swords. She will also find various suits of armor during the course of her travels. Arokh starts out with the expected fiery breath, but soon finds different runes that allow him to increase his power. By the time you're through, Arokh will have belched gas, lightning, ice, and lava. DRAKAN features a good range of villains upon which to test your murderous prowess. The troll-like Wartoks can both slash and head-butt you into submission. Orcs are irritating little guys with a tendency to duck your best blows. Giant spiders and the Lovecraftian Scavengers both kill and creep you out. More challenging enemies such as the demonic Succubus and evil dragons turn up later in the game. Unfortunately, many are by turns cunning foes and mouth breathing morons.

Each environment is lovingly depicted and fully immersive. Weather and fog effects, along with some fantastic colored lighting, complete the illusion. Character animations are equally good. Rynn moves like the lithe warrior she's supposed to be, and the Wartoks stomp around like they just emerged from under a fairytale bridge. With the exception of the atrocious voice acting (Rynn sounds more like a mall rat than a noble Dragon Rider), the audio effects are similarly fantastic. Rushing water, the echo of every movement in a cavern, the clang of blade on blade all is wholly believable. The musical score is similarly inspiring; if John Philip Sousa scored a film version of Lord of the Rings, it would sound like this.

Each turn presents you with numerous options, and requires careful planning especially since, early in the game, the enemy almost invariably has better, longer-range weapons than you. As you progress, your weaponry and skills get better, but the fighting, if anything, gets harder, with more enemies per sector with even more brutal weaponry.

While the game only has one long single player campaign and no multiplayer, much of the replay value comes from trying different mercs, or combinations of mercs. I played two games at once one at home and one at work and they were completely different experiences. The game's structure is totally non-linear (though you are warned which sectors to avoid early in the game), so there is endless opportunity to devise new strategies to try to whittle your winning time down. Random side quests will also keep you busy, as will experimenting with the game's many found objects, which, though undocumented, will often combine into useful new weapons and tools.

Countdown to Armageddon Ultimately, JAGGED ALLIANCE 2 is probably too tough and too slow-paced for the casual gamer, and the somewhat crude graphics may leave newer gamers wondering what the fuss is all about.

Discounting the Marvel characters in Capcom fighting games, can you think of any good comic book games? The last comic book based game I had any fun with was SPIDERMAN for the Atari 2600. So imagine my surprise, and sigh of relief, when I found that Acclaim went and made a pretty good game out of a comic book: SHADOWMAN. It's not a great one, but leagues ahead of the trash from other licenses. For those familiar with the comic series, the game takes place around the first story arc of the series relaunch. For everyone else: You play Mike LeRoi, who is essentially a comreviewed by Thierry Nguyen bination hitman/shaman when he becomes Shadowman.

Once Shadowman has acquired all the Dark Souls, he can defeat Legion. SHADOWMAN Stick a Pin in Me While SHADOWMAN looks like a great start, some things bog it down. The enemy Al isn't stellar.

"Asheron Beckons You to Encounter three cultures, thousands of adventurers, and countless monster A rogue and a sorceress A blademaster and a life mage Aluvian Realm Gharundim Domain As the first people to answer Asheron's call and venture to Dereth, the Aluvians brought with them a strong sense of justice and right. Many an Aluvian would rather go penniless and hungry, and be on the right side of the law, than be wealthy, powerful, and thriving on the misery of others. Even decades later, their utilitarian architecture reflects these traits. Unfortunately, these cultural tendencies often lead them to rebellious and warlike ways. The most famous of the Aluvians on Dereth are the heroes Thorsten Cragstone and Elysa Strathelar. Their Aluvian values proved priceless when they led the human slaves to revolt against their insectlike Olthoi oppressors. Descended from powerful magicians, gifted poets, and intrepid traders, many Gharu'ndim follow the belief that knowledge is power. Those lured to Dereth soon discovered they could not return home, but found the next best thing in the Amun Desert. The famed noble Musansayn led the newly arrived to these comforting sand dunes. Here, they established towns and cities and followed the Ghayaraqa Yadina (the poem also known as The Dozen Roads). Skilled Gharu'ndim smiths have set up shop in many settlements and some have even started crafting their coveted scalemail armor. One such smith is Maqura al-Waryah in the settlement of Tufa. "

The Virindi Masked Enigma of the Badlands Wielding wicked-edged sickles, these floating, mystical beings strike fear into most sensible adventurers.

Lurking on the Obsidian Plain, these apparitions mask, cloak, and conceal both their physical appearance and their intentions on Dereth. An archer and a warrior Sho Nation The Lugian Giant from the highlands Among the mightiest of Dereth's monsters, these massive mountaindwelling titans dwarf humans with their sheer size. Their strongholds are found across Southern Osteth, in the highlands of the Linvak Range. Even the lowest of their castes—the Lagus—can effortlessly dispatch an inexperienced explorer. Trained from youth for unarmed combat, a Sho is never defenseless. The elders use martial arts as a foundation for instilling the four principles called the Stones of Jojii: discipline, detachment, compassion, and humility. This philosophy is embodied in the meticulously crafted weapon, the tachi-a blade now forged in Derethian villages such as Baishi and Sawato. Although known to be reclusive, even the Sho on the homeworld of Ispar are beginning to trade with the distant Gharu'ndim and Milantan kingdoms. Certainly, for the Sho culture on Dereth to survive, they, as well as the other humans, must start working together. The Olthoi Scourge of the Land The bane of the Empyrcan civilization, these vile, hulking insects once enslaved all of Dereth's humans. Today, they have been vanquished to the deepest subterranean reaches. Although Derethians want nothing more than to see these abominations extinct, the hard truth remains that Dereth still needs heroes—adventurers strong and brave enough to travel into the shadowy hives and survive what horror and bounty await within.

"Appearance Allegiance System Strength in Numbers Starting out in Dereth can be daunting. You'll lack funds, lore, weapons, and armor. Fortunately, powerful nobles are always in search of new vassals. But choose your patron wisely. The right one will not only help you on your way, but can be a valued companion. Remember, though, when you become a patron yourself, you'll rise among the nobles only as long as you put the happiness of your charges ahead of your lust for power. Character Creation An Identity All Your Own With distinct heritage groups, nearly limitless facial features, and an array of clothing to choose from, the powerful character creation system makes it very unlikely you'll encounter two adventurers who look exactly alike. What's more, you'll select from a mix of skills and attributes from a myriad of options-all the way from the martial disciplines befitting a blademaster to the mystical arts of the sorcerer. In both appearance and talents, you'll be as unique in Dereth as you are in the world where you now reside. Magic System An Incentive for Secrecy Even with hundreds of spells in the hands of adventurers, there are hundreds more waiting to be discovered. In the ever-evolving world of Dereth, wizards are constantly vying to be the first to learn new methods of sorcery. For while a spell can be extremely powerful as long as its formula is kept to a few people, its strength will be fleeting once too many discover and use it.

A basic Eldar unit may eventually gain enough experience to reach Exarch status, an extremely formidable foe. It's easy to become attached to a squad that you've named and has proven itself in numerous battles, advancing in skills and effectiveness.

FU I LODGE OG Give Me More While there are a couple of mini-campaigns (three scenarios each) from the viewpoint of the Imperials and the Tyranids, the heart of the game is the 24-scenario full campaign covering the Eldar's attempts to right the wrongs on Davinuus. Beyond the absorbing story, the campaign maintains interest by offering a wide range of victory conditions, such as assassinating a key enemy leader, rescuing fellow warriors, finding and recovering a key artifact, and search and destroy missions. The problem is that there is only one full campaign, albeit a campaign that is fairly difficult to complete. True, you can replay the game and try out different army compositions, but the surprises originally presented in the plot will be gone. There is a scenario editor that will hopefully result in a wealth of battles appearing on the Internet. Still, one longs for a campaign involving the Imperials and the Tyranids that has the same plot quality of the Eldar campaign. However, it is a tribute to the engrossing qualities of RITES OF WAR that the player finishes the campaign longing for more. If you have any interest in science fiction and strategy gaming, RITES OF WAR is a must. CGW wa YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY Dealing with terrain is part of the challenge. Here, a valley forces your army to fight a narrow front. Tabletop vs. Computer f you're a tabletop Warhammer 40,000 fan interested in RITES OF WAR, or if you've played RITES OF WAR and are curious about its miniatures origin, you may be wondering what the key differences are. The first obvious difference is that in the tabletop game, a unit represents a single entity, while in RITES OF WAR each icon represents a squad. This results in a significant difference in the scale and tactics of battle. Additionally, strengths and weak nesses of units have been modified to avoid dominating invincible units and to ensure balance. Finally, RITES OF WAR presents a very small subset of the vast Warhammer 40,000 universe, as a visit to any Warhammer 40,000 web site will demonstrate. Check out some of the sites below.

The hero: part Fox Mulder, part Jesus, part The Fonz; a burly U.S. Navy Seal who walks like a runway model with a wedgie. Add to the mix a truly great music score, worthy of any blockbuster movie, performed by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. A strange mish-mash of elements to be sure, but the result is an extremely entertaining bit of interactive theatre. And what a refreshing change it is to have an experience on your computer that gives you the satisfaction you would normally only receive from a good book or mini-series.

"REVIEW OUTCAST PUT MY FOOT IN HIS MOUTH I'm showing this guy who's boss. HARD ROCK CAFE The desert world of Motazar is full of miners and their nifty machines. ...And some token platform jumping. WATERWORLD The region of Okasankar is a fisherman's paradise, but it is also home to some dangerous critters. THE TRUMAN SHOW Collision detection problems allowed me this view \"behind the curtain.\" the expectations of the scripting engine, but this was more of an annoyance, as nothing game-stopping occurred. Outcast uses a voxel-based engine, which is useful for making large, open outdoor environments, but the downside is that it doesn't support 3D accelerators. Infogrames will tell you that this is a feature, making the game playable on practically any machine, but this is rubbish. In truth, it still looks like crap on slow machines, just in its own special way. I played it on a Celeron 300A at home (not overclocked) and it ran pretty well, but it would bog down when there was a lot of on screen action. On a PII 450, it ran great. Just like any system hogging flight sim though, once you've seen it on a good rig, you won't want GUNSMOKE The machine to play it on anything else. pistol is the most handy all-around My one real beef with the game relates to the camera con weapon you possess. trol and weapon aiming. Probably due to the limitations of the engine, you can't look up or down very far. This totally bites when there is someone shooting at you from above, and you can't even look up far enough to see them. The auto-aiming function will latch on to these targets, but only some of the time. Invariably it will fail you at the worst possible moment. There is a first-person mode, but this is made almost entirely useless by the fact that when you try to aim up or down, your gun will annoyingly \"bounce\" back to the center. There were also numerous times when I was in a confined space between two walls, and the camera confused while looking for a good spot would suddenly fly up to the roof two stories up. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't drag me along with it. Of course, I was never meant to be up there, so like Wyle E. Coyote, after looking around for a moment, would fall through the roof, down two stories, and lose half my health. Thanks a lot!

Despite some minor annoyances, I felt a real sense of accomplishment and satisfaction after I finished OUTCAST. really got attached to all the funny characters and the universe in which I had spent about 60 hours. Whenever I got bored, or thought something was too obnoxious, the game would be right there making fun of itself and throwing me a change-up. There were also some jokes and surprises at the very end that were so hilarious that they left me with a very positive feeling about the whole experience. There are lots of elements borrowed from RPG and adventure games here that should make this game familiar and enjoyable to gamers who dig those gen. res.

"REVIEW HIDDEN & DANGEROUS Sniper Strategies HE'S THE MAN Your sniper is your primary tool in taking out the enemy. Make sure he's got adequate support and loads of ammo. hen picking your snipers, always select operatives with exceptional shooting abilities. Each mission should include a sniper in the plans, with a backup just in case. Pack your sniper with ample amounts of ammo, since you'll be using him to take down the majority of enemies. Study the strategy map in order to identify favorable terrain for sniper positioning. Support your marksman with another operative when you move him to optimal high ground a machine gunner with a high reaction score is great for this, especially in wide-open terrain. A machine gunner's high rate of fire and decent range compliments the sniper perfectly, making them a lethal combination of target interdiction and suppression Tire. Make sure you crouch or lie down before your sniper fires. This will decrease your chances of getting hit. Aim for the head when shooting, since a direct hit will kill your enemy most of the time. When using snipers to assault buildings and enclosed areas, use caution. Their low rate of fire can hinder them if there's more than one enemy blazing away at your sniper. fight.

"REVIEW STRATEGY Finally, a Star Trek Game for the Kink and Klingon—in All of Us COMPUTER GAMING WORLD True Trek At Last! eroes EDITORS' CHOICE PLANE OLD BATTLE While coordinating multiple ships as well as ship systems is one of the challenges of STARFLEET COMMAND, having to play in a flat, two-dimensional space is a little disappointing. Clsie Kons AD* ES MISS FIAE COM STARFLEET COMMAND SUTUD 1.ALETUL ith STARFLEET COMMAND the curious and not wholly ignoble history of Star Trek computer games finally has a product worthy of Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the classic crew. Based on the STARFLEET BATTLES board game and perhaps benefiting from BATTLES' breadth and depth of experience, here at last the interactive universe feels like Star Trek. And that universe overlays a plot that is very much in keeping with the classic Trek universe, a dangerous place. Despite Trek's innate emphasis on the Federation, to play only from the Federation's point of view would overlook the richness of the game's campaign sequence. The campaign structure fairly quickly reveals itself to be much more than just a straightforward progression through ranks and increasingly complex assignments. Without giving too reviewed by Keith Ferrel much away, be aware that the campaign sequences should be played from each of the game's empires. In the best tradition of Trek, the campaign reveals that not just the political balance of power is threatened, but in some ways the whole fabric of the universe. The size of the threat becomes larger with each successfully completed mission. Ultimately, the campaign sequence comes to feel almost like a movie or multi-part episode; in some ways closest to a Star Trek novel. It's gratifying to see plot taken as INSIDE INFORMATION A library seriously as playabiliof ship types and comprehensive vessel information gives you the chance to explore the techtyand STARFLEET nologies of species you may face in space. COMMAND SUCceeds at both. VARIANTS Care has been taken throughout the game to communicate the flavor of each race. Effective use of color and graphics establish the fundamental differences among the various races. While MAIL ORDER MADNESS Unfortunately, only players who buy the game directly from Interplay can face Khan's wrath. CGW RATED the basic interface remains similar enough race to race to be relatively intuitive, the differences in design and appearance serve to remind you that the goals (and tactics/weapons systems) of, say, the Lyrans differ from those of the Klingons. This is very much a game of multiple systems and systems man. agement, requiring players to coordinate helm, security, science, defense and offense, communications, and more, all of it in the heat of battle. Fortunately, the command screens and sub-screens are thoughtfully laid out. Tutorials and random non-campaign missions also help. The essentially mercantile approach to rising through the game's ranks might trouble purists. You earn points for missions successfully accomplished, and use those points to upgrade and refit your ships. The library of available ships with increasingly powerful systems is an additional spur up the career ladder. Remember, though, you can only buy tools you must learn the skills to use them well. Space scenes look great, with various ships, starbases, and plan ets well rendered. One large weakness of the game, though, is its 2D combat plane. Combat takes place along an axis rather than through out a globe, which is the game's only major drawback. The game contains a variety of riches that add to replayability. The political universe comprised of the game's races evolves and changes with your success or failure at various missions. The cam. paign sequence introduces familiar figures that further contribute to the Trek-ish verisimilitude Unfortunately, some of that universe's most familiar icons and scenarios appear to be available only on discs purchased directly from Interplay. This is a shame, because everyone ought to be able to take on the challenge of \"Balance of Terror\" or rest in the heart of a nebula when facing Khan. Bogus marketing schemes aside, this is a terrific game. Trek fans have waited a long time for a computer game that captures the richness of the Star Trek universe. STARFLEET COMMAND is that game, and it is rich and deep enough to keep most of those fans busy until the next time the universe is endangered. CGW PROS Feels like classic Trek ought to feel; deep replayability. <A CONS Lots of information to manage; 2D space battles; Khan only avilable in direct-order versions of game.

Land of mythology, mystery, pharaohs... and the most complex tombs known to man. Tombs littered with mazes, puzzles and traps, designed to drive even the most persistent raiders to distraction... or death. Enter: Lara Croft. Based entirely in Egyptian locations, The Last Revelation's plot revolves around ancient mythology and the alignment of the stars at the millennium. Finding herself in a serious predicament, Lara's objective is clear from the outset she must escape a terrifying destiny and rectify a situation that threatens to destroy humanity. from each adventure and a location map that players can access for hints and tips. Application of the transformed system will give new life to puzzle elements a key feature of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation. Clear objectives and smaller locations will result in less time spent traveling between areas. Individual environments are more reminiscent of the original game tightly focused and puzzle-oriented, but with higher levels of detail and a greater number of objects than seen before, The story is unveiled seamlessly through gameplay action driven by advanced engine technology. New programming routines allow levels to dissolve into cinematic cut-scenes and full motion video (FMV). Loading screens are eliminated, making the adventure a continuous, focused experience. Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation's redesigned inventory system replaces traditional inventory rings with an easier-to-use interface allowing items to be combined, collected and stored. The new inventory also features Lara's diary, which includes her personal notes The atmosphere will also be more akin to the original due to the emphasis on ancient locations and tombs. To further the atmospheric detail, the lighting system features spotlighting. New environment mapping allows a variety of surfaces and objects to reflect and react to light sources. Lara herself will have a new remodeled look fully skinned and more detailed. A range of new moves, both simple and complex, provides an assortment of brand new puzzle and trap mechanisms for Lara to negotiate. The puzzles are based on Egyptian mythology and will operate like complex board games right at the player's fingertips. "


"Special Advertising Section RE Interview with Adrian Smith of Core Design So what's the plot this time? We've made the basis of the story a lot simpler this time around the player is given a very clear objective from the outset. The plot will twist and turn as Lara progresses, but the ultimate goal always remains in sight. Very basically, Lara inadvertently releases something rather nasty whilst breaking into an ancient tomb... and of course she's the only one who can put things right. The path of true adventure never runs smooth so Lara will have various tasks to complete before she's able to face a final confrontation. Do you fear a backlash against this title since it is the 4th in the series? Despite any number of new features and improvements, the game is still, in essence, \"Tomb Raider\" an adventure game featuring Lara Croft. What we have done this time is completely re-address a number of key elements. This will immediately distinguish Last Revelation from its predecessors and bring fresh life to the title. The on-screen format is completely new gone are the old inventory rings, loading screens etc. It's always been our intention to make the fourth game as accessible to as many people (both old fans and new users) as possible. We've focused on simpler gameplay so the game will be easier that TRIII in terms of direction and objectives. Players will know exactly what to do, and where they have to do it. The difficulty lies in solving the puzzles that will enable players to complete objectives so it's very much like the original game in that respect. A very clear storyline and single location means that a lot less time is wasted covering vast distances. In some ways Last Revelation is a prequel to the trilogy, but the technical advances will make it far more detailed and atmospheric. If you've never played a Tomb Raider game, this is the one that we'll be recommending! Can you tell us about any of the new enemies that Lara will face? We're concentrating on highly detailed enemies there may be fewer of these but they will certainly be more purposeful than those seen in previous titles. Since we're dealing with Egypt, our artists and animators have really been able to let their imaginations go so we've got mythological baddies as well as natives and generics. Due to the nature of the plot, you'll find a lot of rather strange things happening and don't be surprised if you find that your are pitting your skill against an adversary through the adventure. Will there be another game in the Tomb Raider series? Well you know what they say... You just can't keep a good girl down...!

"Special Advertising Section Out Now! An interview with Amy Hennig, Director of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver of Kain: Piave TDCI How would you describe Legacy of Kain? What type of game is it? What kind of experience can players expect? Our goal from the beginning was to provide a seamless, immersive game experience an epic adventure set in a relatively non-linear game world, that rewards players' exploration and problem-solving skills. Soul Reaver is an action-adventure game with an intuitive set of player mechanics, an innovative combat system, lush visuals, and RPGtype elements like character growth, ability acquisition, and story progression. version of the physical world. During these plane-shifting events, the entire environment morphs in front of the player's eyes the architecture twists and distorts, the lighting changes, and the denizens of the area fade in or out, depending on their planar affiliation. Third, Soul Reaver offers an innovative combat system, which allows players to easily interact with enemies in a full-freedom 3D environment. By holding down the \"autoface\" button, the player can engage with and maneuver easily around enemies, sidestepping around them while planning an attack, and dodging and lunging easily to evade or launch attacks. Because Raziel's primary foes are vampires and therefore only destroyable by impaling, sunlight, fire, or water -the game also requires the player to formulate a plan of attack, to find weapons or use potentially-fatal elements in the environment to his advantage. Finally, behind all the action is a complex storyline, conveyed primarily through ingame cinematic events and voice-over. 1 think players will be impressed by the quality of the script and the voice-acting in Soul Reaver the voices are all provided by talented, experienced actors (most of whom are reprising their roles from the first game), and the voice direction and casting were provided by highlyrespected industry veterans. Any tips for playing the game? Secrets or hints? Mainly, players should remember that the game is all about freedom of exploration each time Raziel receives a new ability, the player should explore areas previously visited to discover power-ups, spells, etc. The player can charge right to Raziel's next goal, if desired none of these bonus areas are required to finish the game but the player will have a richer (and longer!) gaming experience if they revisit previously-explored areas with new abilities. So keep your eye out for locations that seem suspicious, and areas that you can't get to yet make a mental note of these, so you can return later when Raziel earns a new ability. Each of the new abilities opens up previously-inaccessible areas so if there's a gate you can't get through, an unreachable opening high up in a wall, a suspicious looking window, an area you can't reach without swimming, or some odd apparatus that you can't operate yet, it probably means there's a bonus item, or a new area to be unlocked, nearby Secondly, don't forget to autoface those enemies! Soul Reaver's combat is built around the autoface system you can fight enemies without using it, but the experience is much richer if you take full advantage of the autoface button. And finally -when in doubt, shift into spectral. If you think you're stuck, the twisted architecture of the spectral realm may provide the clue that you need to progress. What are the most compelling aspects of the game? The first thing that comes to mind is the data-streaming technology this allows us to provide a seamless, interconnected game experience, eliminating artificial divisions of the game world (and the annoyance of load times). Once the play er begins a game, we never want to disrupt the immersion of the game experience, or pull them out of their willing suspension of disbelief. Besides providing a seamless experience, this technology also allows us a greater variety of creatures, sounds, music, and environments in a much smaller area. Most games have to keep an entire level resident in memory (thus the load times, and the often apparent lack of graphic variety in levels); by streaming the data off the CD, we only have to keep a very small, localized area in memory at any one time. Run down a hallway in Soul Reaver, and the environment can change drastically without the player ever having been aware that data was being dumped and loaded. Second, our world-morphing technology provides something players have never seen before. As Nosgoth's first \"angel of death,\" Raziel can shift at will (more or less) between the spirit realm and the physical world; when he loses all his energy in the material plane, he is automatically forced back into the spectral realm. In the game, these two realms exist simultaneously, the spectral plane being an eerie, expressionistic, \"twilight\" Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and related characters are trademarks of Crystal Dynamics.

How long will it take players to finish it? Geographically, the game is huge but Raziel moves at a pretty good clip, and the placement of Warp Gates allows the player to teleport across the game world fairly easily. In terms of hours of gameplay, it will depend on how a player approaches the game. Players who proceed from one major goal to the next, without revisiting previously explored areas to find bonus levels, will probably get 35-40 hours out of the game. For players who take the time to find all the bonus items and hidden glyph spell levels, the game should provide over 65 hours of gameplay. eidos.com TEIDO ESRB "

Developer: 300 $30www.3do.com Force 21 is a 21st Century wargame that pits the US against China in 15 campaign missions. You play a tactical commander of armored cavalry style forces that are split up into \"platoon\" like ele* * * ments for command and control purposes. The missions don't follow your progress like they do in PANZER GENERAL or M1 TANK PLATOON II, since you cannot carry over units from scenario to scenario. Instead, you get whatever your supply officer has scrounged up that day, which is completely scripted and never varies. You do get to decide who leads the platoons, but even though the commanders have different specialties and abilities, they don't improve with time or seem to have any effect during the missions whatsoever. Your operation and intelligence briefings are just as lackluster, as the directives boil down to \"Kill all the enemy\" or \"Get to this location.\" Intelligence is anything but, with no reports of what the enemy forces consist of or even where they are, leaving you to figure it out on your own and usually necessitating a replay of the mission. The enemy Al is about as dumb as can be; its battle plans are hard coded and consist mainly of pre-planned movement and reactionary triggers. There's no joy when you actually drop into the missions, either. You run your platoons with a third person perspective that is locked to the unit you've selected. So you are not free to move your view around the 3D terrain to achieve fine control of your units. Also, the platoon that you are currently locked on will not take any initiative in firing. You must engage in a click-fest to target each and every enemy, making any actions quite difficult. As a result, you're forced to spend the majority of the game using the strategic screen where the controls are better, but where you can't see the fireworks. Lance A. Larka COMBAT: OPERATION VICTORY adds 30 missions and one adventure to MICROSOFT COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR.

"HARDWARE GAMING MACHINE. REVIEWS NEWS IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE  REVIEWS NEWS VOODOO3 3500 VS. FALCON SE XENTOR Graphics Card Showdown Suped-up TNT2 Ultra Beats Voodoo3 3500 t's been a pitched battle between 3dfx and nVidia as to who's the current 3D king. Voodoo3 is fast to be sure, but in most testing, it's been defeated by TNT2 Ultra. Couple that with the TNT2 Ultra's more complete rendering feature set, not to mention 32-bit rendering, and the edge goes to TNT2 Ultra. So now we move to Round 2, which pits by Dave Salvator Voodoo3 3500 clocked at 183MHz and loaded with TV/video capture features against the latest tricked-out TNT2 Ultra-based board from the dynamic duo of Guillemot and gaming system maker Falcon Northwest. Dubbed the Falcon SE Xentor, this board is over-clocked to 195MHz, while its 32MB of memory runs at a hurtling 235MHz. These two boards squeeze as much horsepower as anyone is going to get out of this generation of chips. So who's got the goods? For pure speed, Falcon SE Xentor wins the day. but the Voodoo3 3500 is no performance slouch, and still offers Glide compatibility as well as decent TV/video features. clearly isn't for everyone, die-hard gaming enthusiasts might want to drop one of these into their AGP slots. The first thing you notice is the active heat sink/fan combo. It's pretty large. In its current configuration, the card will eat the PCI slot adjacent to the AGP slot. The shipping fan will be less deep but may still obstruct a bulky PCI card. Each pair of SDRAM chips also has a small heat sink attached. The card we checked out had 4.3ns SDRAM onboard, and the card will ship at a default clock rate of 195MHz for the TNT2 Ultra chip and 235MHz for the memory clock. There will also be a special over-clocking utility shipped with the card, but Guillemot and Falcon Northwest are guaranteeing 195/235. One of the issues with highly-clocked TNT2 Ultra boards has been motherboard support. A number of motherboards do not deliver the 6 amps current at 3.3 volts to the AGP slot, as called for in the AGP hardware spec. Guillemot mitigates this somewhat by powering the cooling fan through the power supply with a standard connector like those found on hard drives. That should reduce the current draw a bit, but be aware that it could be an issue. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD EDITORS Speed Demon If traffic cops gave out speeding tickets to video cards, the SE Xentor would have its license revoked. And if its blazing perfor mance out of the box isn't enough to satiate the hard-core gamer's appetite, Guillemot has bundled an over-clocking slider that will push the internal clock speed beyond the coveted 200MHz barrier. Like Guillemot's mainstream Xentor32, the SE Xentor ships with a pared-down OEM version of KINGPIN. Unlike the Xentor32, however, this card will set you back $350. Ouch. Falcon Northwest customers get $30 off the list price, though. While the SE Xentor Pistols at Dawn We tested both cards on a 500MHZ Pentium III. With the sole exception of games that use the 3dfx mini-GL DRIVER (HALF-LIFE and QUAKE II), the Falcon SE Xentor bests the Voodoo3 3500. In some sense, this is not entirely an \"apples to apples\" comparison, as the 3500 also has TV and video capture capabilities. But TV aside, the 3500 is still 3dfx's highestclocked offering, The Falcon SE Xentor generated the highest-ever 3D GameGauge score on our test bed, at 51.5, compared to Voodoo3 3500's 49.5. Falcon SE Xentor's 32-bit scores at 1024x768 were also quite good. And this is where TNT2 Ultra pulls ahead of Voodoo3, both in rendering feature set, as well as 32-bit rendering support. We also took a look at the Falcon SE Xentor on a Pentium III/600, where its 3D GameGauge score was upped to an impressive 57.38 (an 11% gain with the 20% increase of CPU speed).

The unit connects via your keyboard port, and has a passthrough connector for your keyboard. This can be just the ticket for playing the old stand-up arcade games using the MACE emulator, and it'll even do pretty well with newer sports titles, too. NFL BLITZ, any. one? At $200 bucks, it ain't cheap, but if you want to indulge your arcade jones at home, then give this guy a look. Dave Salvator Hotrod Joystick, $200, www.hanaho.com Convergence, or Lack Thereof... First, let's dispense with the 3D question. The Voodoo3 3500 is quite fast for 3D games. It's not the fastest card we've seen in 3D GameGauge, but it's way up there. And, of course, it supports Glide, 3dfx's proprietary legacy API. If We tested both cards on a system with a that's what you're looking for in a Pentium-III 500MHz, Intel SE440BX2 mother3D graphics card, then this may be board, 128MB SDRAM, Windows 98, DirectX 6.1. the card for you. So on the merits of and EIDE storage components. its raw 3D performance, Voodoo 3 3500 is a contender. But the 3500 is supposed to be more than that. It's 3dfx's shot at making a convergence product, with onboard TV tuner, video capture, and TV display functions. It's in these key areas that 3dfx fails to deliver. The 3500 has an onboard TV tuner made by electronics giant Philips, and also serves as an FM tuner. This part works very well, and the on-screen \"remote\" works well, though it lacks keyboard equivalents for all the buttons. However, the channel auto-scan only picked up about half my good cable channels; I had to manually activate the rest. Video and audio connections are made through a small, slick looking breakout box. The TV-out is abysmal. More often than not, you get a garbled picture. Heaven help you if you try to use the TV and your computer monitor at the same time you risk making the monitor unusable, and booting with just the TV connected is the only way to fix the problem. If you do get it to work, the monitor refresh rate is an ugly 60Hz, and you can't run higher than 800x600. 3dfx is aware of these problems, but chose to ship the card anyway. If you have a hankering to output video to a VCR, look for a different solution. Voodoo3 3500's poor video output quality is mitigated somewhat by the ability to capture to a hard drive, and 3dfx automates time shifting of program recording to the hard drive in its control panel. But the capture quality is quite poor. If you try to use the MPEG-2 capture capability, you're limited to 320x240, and you will drop frames at that resolution (and this was on a 500MHZ Pentium PROS III). The WinDVD software DVD playExcellent 3D performance; er does a decent job of playback on Glide support, cool TV tuner. the PIII/500, however.

"HARDWARE Audio Update CREATIVE The Art of Noise BLASTER by Dave Salvator and Loyd Case SoundBlasterLive Give Your Audio Sub-System a $200 Ear-Lift Things on the PC noisemaker front have been, well, Sound Cards kind of quiet. We've heard some great new speakers Sound card choices are more limited than in the past, but the that have shipped this year from some unlikely places. But choices that do exist have more features and better performance than most of the progress has been on existing sound cards and sound ever. PCI is now the interface of choice; no major new ISA sound chipsets, as well as in more new games that are using these 3D cards have shipped in the last year, and it's unlikely we'll see any in audio technologies, some to very fine effect. All of this begs the ques. the near future (sound of cheering in the background). tion: Do I need to upgrade my audio gear to get ready for this holiday There are a number of key features to look for in a sound card, and season's offerings? Well, like all things computer-related, it depends. their order of importance depends on what you're looking for. The If you're still running that old Sound Blaster 16 ISA card, it's high first thing to look at, as with graphics cards, is the chipset. The two time you made the move to PCI. Even most prominent audio chipsets are the Listen Up: Vortex 2-based cards like Turtle Beach's Creative's AWE-64, a very good sound EMU1Ok from Creative Labs, used in the card in its day, is now long-in-the-tooth.

It's the same architecture as the original, but Aureal has streamlined the chip and improved performance dramatically. At 22KHz, 8-bit audio with 16 streams, Audio WinBench reported 0% CPU utilization. That's right, 0%. At 44.1kHz, 16-bit audio, the performance hit crept up to 2.32%, but that's hardly a problem in any game. Note that any game that makes heavy use of A3D 2.0's occlusion and wavetracing may still show some performance hit, but Aureal's rev B silicon should help a lot. Note that you'd probably still want a Sound Blaster Live if you're a dabbling musician or recording hobbyist, as CPU utilization does spike up with 32 voices. And while MIDI sounds much better with revision B than the older Vortex 2, it's still not quite up to the Sound Blaster Live sample set. But the new Aureal chip should alleviate any concerns about CPU utilization in games. Cards using the new Aureal chip will be distributed under the Aureal brand by IOMagic: www.iomagic.com.

"HARDWARE plan on using that feature right away. How We Tested DMX Soundsystem How Is \"Faster\" Audio Good? Performance is a key feature. You don't want your cool 3D audio to cause the frame rate of the game to tank. We can test CPU utilization with Audio WinBench 99, which gives us a good indication of perfor mance. The performance champ is Creative's Sound Blaster Live its CPU utilization stays under 3% with 8 and 16 streams of audio, and barely creeps up to 4% with 32 streams. Very few games sup port more than eight streams, however. The Sound Blaster Live also has a superb MIDI sample set, while Aureal's can only be described as adequate (MIDI isn't much of a factor in most games today, though). The Vortex 2, running the newer 2035 reference drivers, stays fairly low with eight 3D audio streams at 22KHz, but spikes up to just over 5% with 16 voices at 44.1 KHz. That's still pretty low if you have a fairly fast CPU (the next revision of the Vortex 2 will per form better see sidebar). The Canyon3D's performance was disappointing at both resolutions. Given that the Vortex 2 performance steadily improved with new driver releases, we can only hope that the same will be true with the new ESS chip. The Canyon3D came Terratec DMX mounted on a Terratec sound card that supports digital (S/PDIF) audio in and out, an optional FM tuner, and wavetable add-on connector. The quality of the 3D audio was good, as were the MIDI samples, but the performance penalty is too great for most of today's demanding games. However, the DMX control panel should serve as a model for a good audio conXitel Storm Platinum trol panel That brings us to the Sound Blaster Live versus Vortex2 debate. Our take on it is choose a good Vortex2 board, like the Xitel Storm or Turtle Beach Montego II, if you've only two speakers. If you have a fourspeaker rig, flip a coin. The four-speaker positional audio is slightly better in our Audio WinBench listening tests with the Sound Blaster Live, but A3D tends to sound better in real games; in either case, the differences are relatively small. The Xitel Platinum comes with a pair of headphones that have \"force feedback\" (read: they vibrate). We found this to be a worthless gimmick and turned it off, but the headphones themselves sound fine, and the whole bundle is $99. If we had to pick one card, though, it would be the Montego II, with its cool diagnostic tools and useful control panel. The Sound Blaster Live full version comes in a close second especially if you're an audio hob. byist as well as a gamer but it will cost you a bit more. ost of our testing of this audio gear was subjective listening. For the sound cards, we ran Audio WinBench's CPU usage tests, which measure how much of the CPU gets eaten when playing multiple wave files through both DirectSound and DirectSound3D. We also ran a number of MIDI sequences through the cards' wavetable synthesizers to evaluate the How They Stack Up quality of their General MIDI patch set. What we Audio WinBench Test found is that Vortex 2 Results for Soundcards based and SB Live cards do a good job of keeping CPU usage low, though 8.32 Terratec's new Canyon3Dbased card suffered from higher CPU usage. For speakers, our testing involved a lot of listening tests both of CD audio music as well as gaming audio. For musical material, we used a wide variety of music, ranging from Bruce Springsteen to the woofer-punishing Bach's Toccata and Fugue in O Minor, which brought a 22KHz, 8-bit, streaming, number of the speakers DS3D, 16 voices we tested to their knees. We were listening for tonal clarity (solid bass and clean, uncolored mids and highs). We also did our dreaded RFL (really, um, frickin' loud) test, where we ran the speakers up as loud as they would go without going into distortion. For gaming audio, we played the opening trailer for MECHCOMMANDER, as well as QUAKE 3: ARENA. Again, we were listening for good sound reproduction across the spectrum, 44kHz, 16-bit, streaming, and because the best way DS3D, 16 voices to have one's gaming audio is loud (as in very), NOTE: At 32 voices, SB live is still we again did the RFL under 4%; we only list results for the Diamond Vortex 2-based card test.

"HARDWARE Speakers AIWA SC-UC78 1 FRONT 100 arua evelopments on the speaker front this year have basically consisted of new, cheap offerings for companies looking to pay in the sub-$100 speaker range, where the great bulk of PC speakers are sold. There are, however, several note. worthy offerings that come in around $150. There is one primary consideration to factor into a speaker-buying decision, and that's of course the sound. Doesn't matter how cool they look, or what type of technol. ogy they use (cone driver, flat panel, dipole radiator, etc.); if they don't sound good to your ears, and cleanly deliver the volume level you're looking for, then they're not for you. Secondary considerations include an integrated power supply, or at the Philips 370 very least a Soap-on-a-Rope-style power supply. In this day and age, wall-warts simply don't cut it. Also, look for speakers that have a headphone jack \"upstairs,\" that is on one of the satellite speakers. This is a very handy feature late at night when you're looking to make with the mayhem and don't want to wake up the whole house. If they've got the headphone jack \"down. stairs\" (on the woofer), then that's better than nothing. So really, the main thing to do when buying a set of speakers is to make sure that the store you buy from has a good return policy. That way, you can take home that prized new set of speakLabtec 2414 ers and put them through their paces in your office, hovel, cave, etc., and make sure that they sound good to your ears. Because taste in speakers is a little like taste in wine, and not everyone is going to agree on which speakers are the best.\" That said, here are our recommendations, which we've broken into two categories: best overall and best value. without distortion, thanks to 80 watts of amplification. In fact, in gaming audio tests, our ears said \"uncle\" before these speakers did. They do come with USB functionality that frankly doesn't add much for gamers. In fact, we'd counsel you to avoid USB audio altogether, particularly on games that use 3D audio via DirectSound3D. As a feature on speakers, don't even bother looking for it. Honorable mention goes to Philips' 370s. These speakers have more bass than should be allowed by law. They also emit very loud volume without distortion, and have good imaging, though Yamaha's offering still sounded better to our ears. Also worth a look are Labtec's 5820 units, which also delivered lots of volume and sounded very solid across the spectrum, both on music and gaming audio. They didn't quite have Yamaha's smoothness, which is why the latter gets the nod. Best Value: Altec Lansing ACS54 Altec Lansing's low-cost, four-channel offering impressed us for its general sound in music audio, but more so in gaming audio, where they produced good volume without distortion. And because they're four channel, they'll certainly help make 3D audio more, well, 3D. About the only thing missing is a headphone jack, though the power supply is integrated into the woofer. Honorable mention goes to Labtec, whose 2414s sound good, and develop decent volume levels before clipping becomes apparent. But the 2414s deliver what they do for about a $40 street price. They lack a headphone jack, and suffer from wall.wartitis, but based on the merits of their overall sound, they're definitely worth a listen. Best Overall: Yamaha YST-M55 Yamaha is a long time denizen of the audio world, making everything from pro audio gear, to home A/V components, to PC speakers. In our listening tests, the Yamahas simply delivered the best sound quality, both for music and gaming audio. There was plenty of lowend, and mids and highs were also well defined.

"HARDWARE Headphones/Headsets There's a problem with speakers when using 3D sound: vertical cues. Even with four speakers, it's difficult to reproduce any sense of vertical position. For example, it's difficult to discern the position and direction of an aircraft circling overhead in a game. Headphones bring those HRTFs right up to your ears, and remove any problems with cross-talk. So the horizontal 3D positioning is much better, and even vertical cues can now be heard with some clarity though it's still not perfect. So it's to Xitel's credit that they bundle some kind of headphones with their Vortex 2 board. There is a gigantic selection of headphones with prices that range from $0.99 to $500. And the adage \"you get what you pay for\" doesn't always hold true. There are some very good headphones in the $30-60 range from companies like Sennheiser, Koss, and others. One of the best microphone/headset combinations I've run into is the Koss R-65B. These combine a great sounding pair of stereo headphones with a reasonably good condenser microphone (though the mounting bracket could be a bit more solid).

"HARDWARE Under the Hood101 BY LOYD CASE Gear Hunter Making Sense of Online Hardware Shopping products can be a great deal, but are often strippeddown. It may be something as simple as selling in a plain box without the software bundle, or something more complex like removing actual hardware features. It's common, for example, for OEM graphics cards to leave off the TV output that is common on retail versions. But it can be even worse than that. One graphics card company once sold an OEM product to one of the larger computer vendors with a slower RAMDAC than the retail product. Both the graphics card company and the system dealer got into hot water with buyers for that bit of cost reduction. So, pay close attention to what features are listed for a card, and make sure you're getting what you think you're paying for. n my years of building PCs, upgrading systems, and writing about it all, I've bought a lot of computer gear. In the process, I've learned a lot about shopping. There's a whole world of jargon to hardware shopping that you learn as you become an experienced buyer. Like all jargon, the language can be strange and confusing. It's not intended to confuse buyers (call me an optimist), but it often does nonetheless. So I thought we'd spend some time doing a little shopping and clear up some confusion along the way. Let's start by paying a visit to www.computershopner.com, one of many good Web resources for direct buyers. In our virtual shopping experience, let's first go looking for a CPU.

"HARDWARE NEED A KILLER RIG? \"Which 3D Card Should I Buy?\" f there's one question readers have asked us more than any other, this would have to be it. So-you asked for it, you got it. Choosing the right 3D card depends on your CPU and your motherboard. We have two recommendations for you: Choice A: If your CPU is a Pentium 233MHz or slower, or your motherboard is all-PCI (no AGP), or you've got a motherboard-down AGP graphics chip with no AGP slot, then get 3dfx's Voodoo2 1000 board. At about $100, it will do a very good job with current games, and a pretty good job with games coming out soon. And the best part is that when you swap in a new motherboard/CPU, you can migrate the Voodoo2 board to the new setup. Choice B: If your rig's motherboard has an AGP slot, then go with Guillemot Xentor 32, which is currently the fastest 3D gun in the West. At about $350 street price for the 32MB version, this card is pretty pricey, but it is the fastest (see this month's review on page 209). Even if you're running a Pentium-Il 233 or 266MHZ CPU, when you upgrade motherboard/CPU you can migrate the card into your new setup, and it's got room to grow with whatever CPU you mate it with. If your budget can't deal with a $350 price tag, TNT2 Ultrabased boards from Guillemot (Xentor 32). Diamond (Viper 770), and Creative Labs (30 Blaster TNT2 Ultra) will also do a good job without breaking the bank. The Ultimate Gaming Machine Product Watch Where's Athlon? fter last month's CPU shoot-out, you may be asking yourself, \"So if AMD's Athlon CPU is Iso damn fast, why isn't it in the Power Rig yet?\" A fine question. The reason? At press time, we couldn't buy an Athlon anywhere. They weren't shipping yet. And because we don't want to recommend anything that you can't actually buy, we're holding off for a month. When Athlon ships, you'll see it in the Power Rig and maybe even in the Lean Machine as well. In other CPU news, Intel is readying their next-generation chipset, code-named Camino. Now rechristened the 820, this new chipset brings several welcome additions, including faster memory, a faster hard drive controller, and AGP 4X. The 820 will support a 133MHz interface between the CPU and the North bridge, as well as a new memory type called RAMBUS, the speed of which will be somewhere between 1.2GB/sec and 1.6GB/sec, a serious speed bump from the current 800MB/sec that the 440BX chipset delivers. The 820 will also support SDRAM, since RAMBUS memory may be in relatively short supply as the 820 debuts this fall.

I can never seem to get the full capacity of hard drives after performing an fdisk. A 9.1 GB hard drive yields only 8.6 GB, and a 6.4 GB hard disk only yields 6.1 GB. Has it got anything to do with the BIOS setting? I'm currently using Win 98 and ABIT BX-6 R2 motherboard. way out of spec, and will fail with most TNT2 Ultra cards. Others miss the rated current spec (6 amps at 3.3 volts) by a smidgen. But a highly clocked card, like the Guillemot Xentor 32 or the Hercules Dynamite TNT2 Ultra that has an onboard fan, needs the full 6 amps of power. Guillemot has done a lot of testing on this, and you can find a list of probTem motherboards at their site, www.guillemot.com. At least one board, the Asus P2B-F, is fixed by simply updating the BIOS to the current revision. errors. One says that the registry files are unavailable (or something like that) then it passes by that and the BSOD comes up saying \"A device or resource required by VFAT is not present or unavailable. VFAT cannot continue loading. System halted.\" Is there any way of fixing this? It's probably not your BIOS. While older BIOS chips could not properly detect hard drives larger than 8.4GB, the ABIT BX-6 rev 2.0 isn't that old. What you're seeing is the difference between how the hard drive companies view the universe and how the rest of us look at it. Hard drive companies believe that one megabyte is 1,000,000 bytes. However, most computers and operating systems believe that one megabyte is 1,048,576 bytes. There are several possible solutions, in order of increasing severity. The easiest one to try is to boot normally. You'll end up at the DOS prompt. Go to \"\\windows\\command\" and type: \"sys c:\". This will make the hard drive a DOS bootable drive. But it won't work if the master boot record has been altered by the Linux install. If that's the case, try: \"fdisk /mbr\". DO NOT do this if you are using some kind of disk manager, like On Track or MaxBlast. Given that you were using Linux, though, this probably isn't an issue. The third thing to try is to get a copy of the latest version of Partition Magic, which understands Linux partitions, and can help in deleting Linux native partitions. Another cool utility is Symantec's Gdisk, which comes with their Ghost partition package. But Gdisk is command line driven and can be very dangerous, so use with caution. CGW I had Win98 and Red Hat 5.2 on a LILO dual boot. Being the idiot that I am I used Partition Magic to just delete the Linux partitions. Simple enough, right? I figured LILO would ask which operating system I wanted to boot as usual, only \"Linux\" would be a \"dead link\" and I could fix that later. Well now it's messed up. The usual LILO boot usually looks like \"LILO Boot:\", but now it just says \"LI\" and freezes up. I try to boot from a floppy, I get to DOS, I can browse my C: and newly created D: drives all I like. But when I type \"WIN\" it starts to load Windows and then I get two What's this I hear about TNT2 Ultra cards not working in some motherboards? A few cards don't work properly with some motherboards. A number of earlier motherboards that used the Intel 440LX chipset didn't deliver adequate power to the AGP slot.

"HARDWARE SAITEK P120 GAMEPAD Reviews Requirements: Joystick port. Price: $9.99 Manufacturer: Saitek Industries Contact: www.saitekusa.com Such a Deal ACTIONTEC 56K PCI CALL WAITING MODEM Requirements: Free PCI slot. Price: $105 Manufacturer: Actiontec Contact: www.actiontec.com Hold the Phones I've steered people away from PCI modems in general, because most of them are \"soft\" modems little more than an excuse to sell more powerful CPUs. Actiontec has finally shipped a modem that's the exception to that rule. Soft or \"Winmodems\" use your CPU to process most of the modem chores. They're terrible for online games, and often cause unacceptably high lag times. More traditional modems have their own controller chip that takes the burden off the CPU. The Actiontec PCI modem also has its own dedicated controller, so you don't get that severe CPU hit. When playing with TRIBES or Q3TEST 1.08, I saw server ping times as low as 120ms, and game play was smooth and lag-free on servers with less than 250ms * * * * pings. I was able to connect to a local ISP at data rates regularly above 44kbps (usually around 48kbps). The call waiting is handy, too, if you've got that feature on your phone. I was able to take a call while online, tell the person I'd call back, hang up, then disconnect from the Net gracefully (you have about 7-10 seconds). I wouldn't want to do this in the middle of a hot TRIBES session, though... At $105, the Actiontec is more expensive than those lowball Winmodems, but your gaming experience will be much better for the extra dough. -Loyd Case Most of the news about V gamepads has been about the herd migrating to USB. But Saitek has focused on making a very inexpensive gamepad that can be found for 10 bucks. That's right, 10 bucks. Now, you may be thinking that you'll get what you pay for, but Saitek's P120 gamepad is a generally competent gamepad that works well for sports titles, and is competent for driving titles. Installation is easy enough: Connect the P120 to your joystick port (no USB connectivity), * * * * * bring up the Game Controllers control panel, and configure a Custom controller with three axes and four buttons. A quick calibration and you're good to go. The P120 has a D-pad mini-joystick that can be stored in the body of the gamepad when not in use. I do have a couple of design gripes. The third axis is controlled by two index-finger buttons, but the buttons are essentially digital, so that the \"axis\" only has three discrete positions (center, hard-left, hard-right). This \"axis\" might as well have been two extra buttons. Also, the four-button layout is essentially a \"two-row\" design, rather than a circular ABIT BE-6 SLOT ONE MOTHERBOARD Requirements: ATX chassis, Pentium Il or better, and an Ultra ATA hard drive for maximum performance. Price: $130 Manufacturer: Abit Contact: www.abit-usa.com Ultra-Frustrating A bit has developed a wellH deserved reputation for offering motherboards that cater to users who love to tweak their systems and play around with over-clocking. The new Abit BE-6 mother* * * * board has an onboard Ultra ATA/66 hard drive controller, which is the latest version of the EIDE hard drive connection standard, and is faster than most current EIDE controllers on motherboards. The board uses an HPT366 controller chip to handle the Ultra ATA/66 chores. There are four IDE connectors on the motherboard, and you can have up to eight IDE devices attached. Abit even sup. plies an 80-conductor Ultra ATA cable for more reliable performance. Despite the thoughtful inclusion of the better quality cable, Ultra ATA/66 on the BE-6 wasn't very reliable in Ultra ATA/66 mode. I attached a pair of Western Digital Expert hard drives. The system frequently locked up dur. ing WinBench 99 disk WinMark testing when attached to the ATA/66 connectors. Switching to ATA/33, the hard drives ran perfectly, with no problems. In the end, I had to carefully run each test, one at a time, to get the final results. During normal use, the system did Crash several times a day, though it was hard to pin down the cause. The bottom line is that if you des. perately need an Ultra ATA/66 controller, you may be better off with another motherboard and a PCI controller card. Even then, the testing shows almost zero difference between Ultra ATA/66 and Ultra ATA/33, even on the fast Expert series hard drives. While Abit gets come credit for trying to push the performance envelope in general, this time they may have pushed it a little too hard. -Loyd Case 1-2-3-4 design like the Gravis Gamepad. I took the P120 for a spin through HIGH HEAT 2000 and NEED FOR SPEED: HIGH STAKES. In HIGH HEAT, the controller was fine and allowed me to control all aspects of gameplay it could be a good substitute for the Microsoft Sidewinder gamepad. In NEED FOR SPEED, I config. ured the third axis to control accelera. tion/braking, and here the controller did the job. But because the \"third axis\" is essentially digital (on/off), it made controlling the car more difficult. For ten bucks, the P120 is a very solid controller. Its no-frills design gets the job done, though you can't daisy-chain multiple controllers, or connect it via USB. But if you're an occasional gamepad user, then the P120 is worth a look.

Success requires the disciplined development of a number of sound tactical habits. WAIT FOR IT! (2 COVER OFTEN, COVER WELL AGGED ALLIANCE 2 is such a diffiJ cult game because it requires traits rarely rewarded in gaming patience and restraint. If you go into this game guns a'blazing, your Mercs will die. If you aren't willing to spend a lot of time set ting up a strategy, your Mercs will die. If you get sloppy with your tactics, your Mercs will die. Yes, the games will be long and a little tedious, but this is JAGGED ALLIANCE 2 not so much a game as a test of character over is everything. Cover is life. If you try to fight toe-to-toe with your foes without adequate cover, your Mercs will die. Your opponents have god-like aim, even with pistols, even at long range. So whenever possible, approach a sector from the angle that provides the best cover. If you find yourself fighting a patrol in a sector without cover, retreat and try to fight them on better ground. It's easy to tell when your Mercs are out of the sight of foes the foes turn black. What's not easy to tell is whether or not a particular rock, tree, or wall will provide cover from a particular foe, which is one of the more frustrating parts of the game. If your Merc has been sighted by a foe and is running for cover, leave yourself extra movement points so that you can experiment with various positions and postures. It may take some futzing around before your Merc is safe. Once in adequate cover, the most common tactic is to pop up to take a shot and drop back down. Always leave yourself enough movement points to duck down again, or else that's right your Mercs will die. That said, you must be very cautious with the Pop Goes The Weasel strategy. If your foes get set up in firing positions around your hiding spot, there's a very high likelihood that they will get interrupt shots when you pop back up. And a quick note on sighting: just because an enemy has turned black doesn't mean you can't hit him. If your line-of-sight is not blocked, you have a chance (although greatly reduced) of hitting a foe who's \"in the black.\" Sometimes these long shots are worth the ammo if the targeted foe is threatening your favorite Merc. 214.

"GAMER'S EDGE FLANKING UP ON THE HOUSETOP, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK Roofs are great for sniping and scouting. Projectiles also have a great range from up high. o ne way to alleviate the enemy-interrupt problem is to use the most important tactic in U JA2 flanking. Whenever possible, try to position your Mercs so that they have firing positions on the enemy from different angles. Flanking combined with the Pop Goes The Weasel strategy is very effective. A Merc can pop up from one position and fire, thus drawing the attention of your foes. Then another Merc can pop up from another angle. Since the foes are facing in another direction, they are much less likely to get an interrupt on the second Merc, and they must also change their facing to fire on the second Merc, burning valuable movement points. If you alternate between Mercs, you can keep your foes' heads spinning HIT-AND-RUN DIVERSIONARY TACTICS Another useful tactic, especially when outgunned or outnumbered on a night operaMtion, is the hit-and-run. Creep up on an enemy, take a nice shot, and then retreat. Have other Mercs positioned behind the first Merc so that they have a chance of interrupt shots on the pursuing foe. Fire, fall back, set up more potential interrupts. Repeat. Whenever possible, try to completely disengage from the enemy and return to realtime mode when using the hit-and-run; the reason being that when you encounter the enemy again and drop into turn mode, all of your Mercs will have their full allotment of movement points. V our foes will run toward the sound of gunfire. You can use this fact to set up nice ambushes. Send your stealthy night ops Merc to one end of the map and fire off a couple rounds. Wait until the enemy has moved toward that Merc, then slink away. You can then, carefully, bring the rest of your Mercs to the side or rear of the waiting foes. They will be facing in the direction of the gunfire, giving you a chance to sneak up and take some nice shots at their backs. Time to Pump You Up SZ Battle Improving your Mercs' stats is both rewarding and essential. How to I improve stats is obvious in most cases, but here are some not-so-obviFIGHT AT NIGHT Ous and some very cheesy ways to pump Mercs stats.

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE STRATEGY by Robert Coffey Gaming Outside the Lines Strategy's he days of cut-and-dried strategy genres are numbered. Yes, there's always going to be a place for pure real-time strat in the COMMAND & CONQUER mold, an audience for Sid Meier CIV-style grand strategy, and a home for hardcore wargames, but they're being whittled down by gamers' love of anything new, and the growing audience of casual gamers looking for games that cast a broader net. You'd think these disparate influences would work against each other, but surFuture Lies prisingly enough, the most interesting and enjoyable games on the horizon have in Genre something for both groups, and they're accomplishing it by blurring genre lines. Blending Role-playing influences are cropping up everywhere. While this trend began with the troop training portion of X-COM and MYTH's experience-gaining veteran troops, it's really coming to the fore in games like Sir-tech's JAGGED ALLIANCE 2 and Red Storm's upcoming SHADOW WATCH, which charges players with developing their individual units in over 70 skills and abilities. While this has an obvious effect on the strategic portion of the game, it gives strategy gamers a reward heretofore reserved primarily for MIGHT & MAGIC or BALDUR'S GATE fans-that sense of accomplishment that comes only from watching your characters grow under your guidance. Need more examples? What about WARLORDS: BATTLECRY and its very traditional fantasy RPG heroes, or METAL FATIGUE's experience-gaining 'mech Robert's Playlist crews? 1. Might and Magic VII Action 2.

Niggle, a Palm Pilot Scrabble-alike are becoming so numerous, they'd form their own genre if they weren't such a diverse lot. The first BATTLEZONE game proved the two apparently incompatible genres were a natural fit, and the sequel is taking it even farther, allowing gamers to all but forgo the action side of the mix to focus on base-building and unit commanding Games like ROGUE SPEAR and SWAT 3 may look like first-person shooters, but their heavy emphasis on planning and tactics make them stand out from the QUAKE-alikes, and let sound Robert_Coffey@zd.com strategists succeed even if their shooting skills aren't the best. For the ultimate in shooter/strategy hybridization we'll have to wait for next year's TEAM FORTRESS 2, where gamers will be able to play a pivotal role as a team commander and never have to fire a shot. Does this genre-bending harm titles? On the contrary, I think it lies at the center of AGE OF EMPIRES' incredible success. By giving gamers the ability to win by building Wonders and not destroying their enemies, Ensemble Studios created a game that can appeal both to grand strategists and to realtime vets. With even more ways to win in the sequel, the AGE OF EMPIRES franchise should only attract and addict more fans. Appealing to different sets of gamers might be what draws many to IMPERIUM GALACTICA II, with its blend of grand strategy, real-time combat, and a game engine that lets you pause the real-time combat to issue orders to your ships. So does all this mean that more traditional titles are dead? Not at all-Sid Meier could probably buy a private island with what he'll make from the upcoming CIV III, and a new WARCRAFT game from Blizzard is a guaranteed bestseller. But if the genre as a whole simply stuck its head in the sand and refused to change, it could find itself under a headstone-right next to the murdered-by-clones adventure genre. CGW Keep 'Em Coming Back for More he only letdown with the best games inevitably comes at the end when the fun stops. That's why we're so happy that Bullfrog is making a commitment to providing fans of DUNGEON KEEPER 2 with new content and upgrades. Over the next few months, the designers intend to post new game features, new maps, unique units, mini-cam. paigns, and eventually even the editing tools every week on their web site, www.dungeonkeeper.com. They hope to do this through November, or longer if sales of the game warrant it. With luck, this will be a huge success and will encourage other companies to do the same. All You Pretty Things Games like ROGUE trategy titles have been using 3D acceleration for some time now, but it's just starting to really pay off in the eye candy department. BLACK & WHITE should set a new standard for imaginatively-rendered name environments, while DARK REIGN 2's weapon effects, night-and-day cycling, and dazzling environments threaten to doom gamers to fallure as they neglect fighting and just soak up the gameworld. And while gamers have been oohing and aahing over gorgeous screenshots of HOMEWORLD's space fleet battles, IMPERIUM GALACTICA Il's 30-accelerated space wars flat-out tops them, with incredibly dynamic combat highlighted by brilliant ship-rending lasers and beautiful, twitching lightning guns. But the most impressive thing we've seen lately in a strategy title doesn't even use hardware acceleration: AGE OF EMPIRE II's trebuchet. A paragon of unit dosion and animation, we've been churning these babies out in multiplayer games just to drink in their muscular grace as they lob their payloads at enemy walls and buildings. 200 "

Such fans should check out NETHERGATE, a game set in 60 A.D. Britain dur ing the conflict between the Roman Empire and the Celts.

Games Need to WHEN IN ROME NETHERGATE extends Jell Vogel's fine series of traditional RPGs that favor complex gaming over graphical gimmickry. This one's set in 60 A.D. Britain. NETHERGATE phen role-playing games were a near-dead genre in the mid1990s, many gamers questioned why one of computer gaming's oldest genres suddenly became so unpopular. Almost all RPGs featured a pseudo-medieval swords-and-sorcery gaming world full of goblins, fireball spells, and giant rats. The lack of originality was so pervasive that new gamers were led to believe that elves and swords were RPG prerequisites. Strategy games with fantasy settings, such as MASTER OF MAGIC, were erroneously classified as RPGs. The horror! How did the genre become so stagnant? RPGs are not about Tolkienesque settings. RPGs are about being able to assume a role in an open-ended, meaningful way. Through Role-Playing character creation and development, or just through choices made during the game, players individualize their pixelated alter-egos and ultimately their experiences. The setting of the virtual world is irrelevant in Branch out characterizing a game's genre. Ironically, although the inspiration for their computBeyond Tolkien er counterparts, tabletop RPGs have featured a larger variety of settings, including science fiction (GAMMA WORLD, TRAVELER), western (BOOT HILL), comics (MARVEL SUPERHEROES) and horror (VAMPIRE, WEREWOLF). Several of the original tabletop RPGs, such as DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and TUNNELS AND TROLLS, were swords-and-sorcery games, but there's never been a shortage of paper RPGs set in other environments. Yet with a few notable exceptions, most of which were released in the 1980s, computer RPGs have focused exclusively on chopping up orcs and wielding +4 battle-axes. Deus Ex With the genre in full resurgence, I hope it doesn't doom itself again by producing increasingly derivative games and ignoring innovative settings. The immediate future still looks promising. Interplay's FALLOUT games garnered both critical and commercial success at least in part due to their milieu's stylish amalgamation of futuristic post-apocalyptic and '50s Americana. SYSTEM SHOCK 2 is a sequel but still seems highly original, because it includes relatively novel science-fiction elements such as cybernetic implants and psionic powers. Add Desslock's Playlist to the mix a development team (led by Ken Levine) experienced in making innovative prod1. System Shock 2 2. Half-Life ucts, an enhanced version of the THIEF 3D 3.

Helmed by industry veteran Tom Hall, ANACHRONOX's development team seeks to combine truly original science-fiction environments and the same sort of action/RPG hybrid gameplay offered successfully by several console RPGS. DEUS EX merges elements of James Bond's adventures and the X-Files. With the impressive R UNREAL engine, DEUS EX's development team has created some of the most realistic-looking, immersive environments yet seen in a role-playing game. The team is led by Warren Spector and Harvey Smith, who helped create the original SYSTEM SHOCK, ULTIMA UNDERWORLD, and other critically acclaimed RPGs. Promising games are also in the works based upon White Wolf's VAMPIRE and WEREWOLF milieus, although the game based upon the latter will emphasize action over RPG elements. Even with the gradual expansion of computer RPGs into science-fiction and horror settings, it still seems as though developers are artificially narrowing the scope of what really is gaming's broadest genre. How come we have yet to see computer RPGs set during the world wars? Saving Private Ryan's band of soldiers are a suitable model for a WWII RPG party. The Wild West? Outlaw legends provide ample fodder for compelling RPGs. Those intuitive settings have been consistently ignored by developers, as have others. How about a Viking RPG featuring the gods of that mythos? What about ancient Egypt, medieval Japan, or imperial Rome? Unless RPGs innovate and evolve into new settings, the renaissance RPGs are enjoying will quickly end. So many possibilities, yet such little innovation shown to date. CGW Who dares ignore the elves?

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE SIMULATION & SPACE by Gordon Berg grognard@concentric.net Labor of Love t's a shame (and a crime), but almost every computer product released these days seems to require a patch. And while most companies will allocate some time and resources toward a game after it ships, many games don't achieve their full potential Patching your even after a patch or two. Such was the case with two recent flight sims. The Favorite Flight companies released an intended \"final\" patch, but both games still needed more Sims, 24-7 work. Fortunately for us, a grassroots effort prevailed in both cases--a dedicated handful of people were willing to produce further revisions in their spare time. The newest patches should be available by press time. Another FALCON Patch peaking of patches, the 1.07 patch for FALCON 4 has arrived. Five months in the making, this latest effort goes a long way in fixing various avionics, campaign, Al, multiplayer and crash-to-desktop issues (see the patch on this month's demo disk). Although 1.07 is indeed a major leap forward for FALCON, this sim is still in need of some further work if reaction in the newsgroups is any indication. Given FALCON 4's immense scope, this is hardly surprising. Nonetheless, HI/MicroProse is hoping the next patch will be the last one, thus freeing them up to finally work on some add-on products. European Air War Two people are currently hard at work on EUROPEAN AIR WAR. EAW may be a gaming media darling, but it still has its problems, especially in the multiplayer department. After the version 1.1 patch shipped, Brandon Gamblin and Chris Coon of MicroProse kept close tabs on the reaction in the Internet newsgroups. Says Gamblin, \"We heard about the troubles that EAW was having on the Internet. So, a few of us started working on the Internet problem in our spare time, still devotGordon's Playlist ing full-time effort to 1. Warbirds our main projects. That 2. Jagged Alliance 2 was how the 'unofficial 3. Baldur's Gate: TOTSC patch got started.\" 4. European Air War (with v1.2 patch) 5. MechWarrior 3 Hasbro/MicroProse were supportive of the process. \"There was never any difficulty with them,\" said Gamblin. \"Once it looked like we had sufficient cause and substance for a patch, we told Hasbro/MicroProse about it and they started giving us support for it (QA, artists, etc.). It was always understood, however, that this was not part of our main work. This was always an extracurricular patch.\" Although this patch focuses on multiplay, it also adds some new features and a few more bug fixes. In addition, an \"unsupported\" art kit has been made available, allowing players to alter their own planes and virtual cockpits, as well as the terrain. For more information, go to support.microprose.com/eawupdate htm there weren't too keen on the potential tech support calls and confusion that unsupported patches might cause. After what I assume was much debate, they decided to allow me to produce patches unsupported by Activision.\" Harrison is primarily focusing his efforts on the flight model, but he's also adding new features. \"The modified aircraft won't be wholesale replace ments of the aircraft that shipped with the game, since generally those aircraft were sound. There were some changes made to them prior to shipping that made them easier to fly. I'm undoing those changes as well as tightening up some of the center of gravity and weight distribution data.\" The challenge has been in getting everyone to agree on what the final flight model should be. \"I've found that many people have their idea of what makes a WWII aircraft,\" he says, \"and I'm attempting to attain a balance between realistic simulation and playability. As to what will become the 'default,' that will largely depend on the users themselves. Regardless, there's plenty of room in the OpenPlane world for both hard-core flight simmers as well as for those who just want to get up into the air.\" For more information on ParSoft and OpenPlane, check out WWW.openplane.org. CGW Screamin' Demons ParSoft's Michael Harrison had to travel a different road with SCREAMIN' DEMONS OVER EUROPE. Although version 1.5 essentially turned SDOE into an altogether different flight sim, it still wasn't enough, especially when it came to the flight modeling. \"Unfortunately, we were only given two weeks to work on the patch, so that naturally limited what we were able to fix or add,\" explains Harrison. \"Activision didn't want to invest more time on the game, but there were elements that needed modification. Rather than leave the users in the lurch, I decided to take on future mods and fixes. Given that a personal goal of mine was that we try to build a community around OpenPlane so that we could continue to improve upon it, this struck me as the right thing to do rather than to treat each game as an independent island.\" These are admirable goals to be sure, but Activision was hesitant to approve any additional patches. \"Some people When not engaged in aerial maneuvers, Gordon Berg works as a network administrator for a non-profit social services organization. 230 NOVEMBER 1AAA GAY.amespot.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE by George Jones SPORTS Let's Get it on! Microsoft isn't even competing right now. (Side note: NHL 2000, which should be coming out soon, takes the game back to its early, faster-paced, shoot-it-out roots.) Advantage: EA Sports George_Jones@zd.com saw the early dominance of Microsoft firsthand when I worked at PC Week magazine, one of Computer Gaming World's boring older brothers. Remember WordPerfect? Or how about Lotus 1-2-3? Six years later, having seen Microsoft Internet Explorer reel Netscape in like a little cod, I'm wondering if EA Sports is picking up on the fact that Microsoft has them square in its targeting reticle. To be Microsoft vs. sure, EA has witnessed many a competitor, from VR Sports to Sierra Sports, trying to EA Sports move in on their turf. And to their credit, they've repelled all challengers in practically every major sports category with their unique blend of attitude and action gameplay. But now Microsoft is here, using the same tactics they've used to dominate other markets. Tactic number one: They've taken their time with their products. Both NFL FEVER 2000 and NBA INSIDE DRIVE have been in development for a long time. Tactic number two: Not having to worry so much about profits this time around, they're releasing their products at a much-lower-than-normal price: $19.99. Football Football is a closer contest than I originally thought, given the MADDEN series' noble lineage. MADDEN 2000 definitely has the bells and whistles-like the totally unique Great Moments mini-game, and 32-season career modes. It also has years of development behind it, which means you'll see unparalleled defensive play. To Microsoft's credit, they didn't just reverse-engineer MADDEN; the design team really put forth their own vision of digital football. It shows. NFL FEVER 2000 looks and plays more realistically, and incorporates a layer of graphical detail I've yet to see anywhere else. If you're into faster action and attitude, choose MADDEN. If you're more into realism, it's NFL FEVER. Advantage: Tie INDIANA Battle of the Network Stars But the gaming market is a little different. Since Microsoft doesn't have as many advantages in the gaming arena as they have in the browser or productivity George's Playlist arenas, a lot of this issue boils down 1 High Heat 2000 to one question: Who has the better 2. Age of Empires 2 (beta) games? Here's a breakdown. 3. Madden 2000 Hockey 4. NFL Fever 2000 EA Sports has this one 5. Quake III so locked up that Hoops NBA LIVE 2000 has better graphics, and two of the coolest features I've seen in a basketball game. You can play with players from the NBA's past, including Chamberlain, Magic, and Bird, and you can play with any of these legends-or any other NBA player--in a oneon-one schoolyard mode. Although Microsoft's NBA INSIDE DRIVE does play more like the real-life sport it simulates, the game lacks some visual appeal-as well as the classic players, free-agent salary negotiations, and the flavor of the game. Advantage: EA Sports Life vs. Computers Baseball Nolo contendere. The competition here isn't even close. TRIPLE PLAY dominates MICROSOFT BASEBALL. But TRIPLE PLAY isn't the finest baseball game around any. more. That title belongs to HIGH HEAT 2000. Advantage: 3D Could be the Vikings' year. ne of the high points in my life involves the cher ished autumnal ritual of running the year's batch of football titles through a full-season simulation. This year, 1 picked MADDEN 2000 and NFL FEVER 2000 as the officially-licensed prediction makers. Unless the two games know something we don't, the regular season featured surprises in both cases. In addition to predicting that the 49ers wouldn't even make the playoffs, and that the sur prising Tennessee Titans would win the AFC Central, NFL FEVER 2000 predicted that the Vikings and the Broncos would make the Super Bowl with the Broncos running away with it, 27-14. MADDEN 2000 saw things a little differently in one regard. The Broncos went out in the first round of the playoffs in this season sim, and the Jaguars somehow played their way into the Super Bowl against the Minnesota Vikings. Something that worried us is that MADDEN 2000 also saw the 49ers fail to make the playoffs. Here's a word to the wise: If this actually happens, the resulting depression here in the Bay Area might trigger the big Internet stock crash everyone's been expecting Once again, we will try to convince the maga zine's publisher to buy us a satellite dish so that we can \"keep track\" of how well these games model the real NFL season, and we'll let you know how the two games are over the course of the next four months. The frightening thing about all this for EA Sports is that Microsoft, unlike the VR Sports of the world, will keep plugging away until they figure out the formula for success. It's up to Electronic Arts to determine what happens-it's their battle to lose. If EA maintains an aggressive focus on balancing fun versus realism, and doesn't develop conservatively, Microsoft may find itself unable to easily dominate the sports arena. And for PC gamers, a competitive genre is much more fun. PlayStation owners know what I'm talking about-PSX football games got much better when NFL GAMEDAY came out.

"GREENSPEAK by Jeff Green Johnny Levels Up The King is Gone, but He's not Forgotten Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold -William Butler Yeats, \"The Second Coming\" (1921) Tow do you begin a column about Johnny Wilson? With a joke, perhaps, to pay tribute to his unre. pentantly raunchy sense of humor? With a memorable anecdote from times past, to acknowledge his 15plus years at Computer Gaming World? Or how about with some kind of erudite, literary quote to set the tone and establish a conceptual framework the kind of thing Johnny always did in these pages? The problem, unfortunately, is that whichever way you choose to begin, you're almost certainly doomed to failure. Because nothing you could write in one page could possibly do justice to a man who has been so closely identified with, and done so much for, this magazine. So you might as well go for the literary one. It'll make you look smart for the chicks and Johnny could always appreciate that, too. may be, in the grand scheme of things, a rather frivolous business, that doesn't mean we can't think about them and write about them with intelligence, and passion, and a strong sense of integrity. It was Johnny Wilson who insisted that all reviewers finish a game completely before writing a review. To him, anything less was half-assed and irresponsible the equivalent of writing a movie review after walking out halfway through. It was Johnny who for years refused to preview a game unless we had playable code. Long after CGW's competition began escalating the war to grab \"exclusive\" previews, Johnny stuck to his guns over the protests of his own staff and superiors not wanting to participate in what he saw as empty cheerleading for games that might ultimately suck. Johnny Wilson obsessed over every page of every issue that he ever worked on. I've never met anyone who took his job more seriously. He could not bear to see us print something that was incorrect. He'd fret in his office for days, with the door closed, if he perceived that we had blown it somehow. It was sometimes painful to watch. Market realities forced CGW to evolve over the years, but Johnny always fought to ensure that that evolution never took place at the expense of the magazine's integrity. He was a warrior and a visionary. He worked ceaselessly. He never gave up, even when he wanted to. He also did the best Elmer Fudd I've ever heard. Johnny Wilson is alive and well. Actually, with a new wife, home, and job, he's probably more alive and more As it turns out, this Yeats guy knew what he was talking about. The center cannot hold forever, even at a computer gaming magazine. Johnny Wilson, CGW's longtime editor-in-chief and patron saint, has moved on. And why should you care? Because you wouldn't be holding this magazine in your hands right now were it not for his extraordinary, near two-decade long career here. Way back in 1982, when Johnny first started working for CGW, gaming was still a young, humble, hobbyist's medium; a subculture of a subculture. Gaming was far from mainstream entertainment it was the arcane, funky new refuge of chess club and Dungeons and Dragons veterans. Guys like Richard Garriott and John Romero were not yet celebrity superstars, just geeky programming guys writing code late into the night. The early CGW reflected this: amateurish, pamphlet-sized, with ugly black-and-white artwork. Johnny's first review was for a game called HORSE RACING CLASSIC for the Apple, which he called \"a darn good party game.\" From such humble beginnings, Johnny ascended the ladder from writer to Associate Editor to Editor, and eventually to Editor-in-Chief. Along the way, he helped shepherd the magazine from an underground geekfest to a mainstream international publication with hundreds of thousands of readers. He saw the industry grow and mutate into something radically different from what it was, and he took CGW through this same process heroically struggling to straddle the line between satisfying older readers, while giving newer readers some thing they could relate to. Maybe he didn't succeed all the time, but he damn sure never stopped trying. ...you wouldn't be holding this magazine in your hands right now were it not for Johnny Wilson's extraordinary, near two-decade long career...) well than he's been in at least five years. So don't feel sorry for him. Feel sorry for his new bosses instead, because, unless he's undergone a radical personality change, he's going to start giving them all hell before they know what hit them. Don't feel sorry for Computer Gaming World, either. Because the thing is, Johnny Wilson hasn't really left at all. His heart and soul are infused on every page of this magazine. He taught us all everything we know. He was, and is, The Man. Thanks, Johnny What Jeff does realize is that if it weren't for Johnny, he'd still be reviewing networking cards for Macintosh magazines. Jeff thanks Johnny for that, too. Send email to jeff_green@zd.com.
