If you've heard What's Going On (Motown, 1971), you know what I mean. In fact, I may have just lost you to the daydreaming, introspective state of mind that album can put you in. Marvin's passion regarding the inner city, war, and even the environment creates not just a good listen, but a transcendent experience. Why? Because he meant every word he sang. Few albums are capable of making you feel as much as this beautiful, haunting epic did. Four or five times a year, computer games are capable of the same sort of transcendence. And without fail, the games that glue us to our monitors for hours at a time have one thing in common with What's Going On: They have creators who truly believed in what they were doing. It's so tangible an aspect of a great game that you can literally feel it, and in far more obvious ways than music.

You can go out and buy any of Marvin Gaye's music on compact disc right now. You can buy several different best-of compilations. Or his box set. But you cannot buy and play classic games like M.U.L.E., and unless things are different in ten years, you won't be able to buy and play HALF-LIFE.

I mean, I know the guy's a genius and all but why the hell does he look so smug? Every time I look at his picture I have an overwhelming urge to bend, fold, or mutilate someone or something. I am usually a very calm guy, but Case's photo definitely puts me into a Manchurian Candidate rage...please help. Anonymous via the Internet I've been reading Greenspeak for a long time now and I just noticed that Mr. Jeff Green looks a whole lot like the late Phil Hartman. I was wondering, does he look this way in real life or is it just that picture? Ryan Telles Via Internet It's definitely just the picture. In real life, he looks more like this: Let appearances fool you not.

When Readers Attack ne of the regular articles in your magazine that I enjoy reading is the Pipeline. I am always curious about what is coming up soon for purchase, and find it helpful. But it's frustrating that most games seem to be released about the same time. Why must all game companies release their products around Christmas? In an effort to express this frustration I have a better way for you to list the Pipeline release dates than Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. Q1 = We just missed Christmas, Dang! Q2 = Boy, did we miss Christmas! Q3 = What we really mean IS Christmas! Q4 = I hope we can release by Christmas! Wouldn't you agree that these sayings are more descriptive of what the software industry release dates are really like?

"LETTERS way to go. So what should I get? Any insight would be much appreciated. Jason Love You're in luck, Jason-every issue, in our Hardware section, we address this question. Check out our answer on page 189. Thanks for the Memories T highly enjoyed your article about the 10 games Lthat need to be remade (October, '99). Your article truly took me back to the glorious days of the Commodore 64, Spectrum ZX 81, Amstrad, and Atari computers. Thank you very much for making such an effort and bringing those beautiful memories back. I do wish, however, that you had mentioned the following games as well (Eleven games deleted for space! -Ed.): Elite: Being the first, most detailed simulation/trade style game, this opened up a path for countless other games to follow. Bruce Lee: One of the classic early arcade platform games, and one of the first games ever to present the concept of multiplayer gameplay on a single screen. Calling it awesome would be unfair, because it is way beyond that. Spy vs Spy: Very simple graphics, very simple gameplay, but Spy vs. Spy created tons of sleepless nights for me and my friends. This one was one of the first great multiplayer action/strategy games. Impossible Mission: I can't recall how many times I've been all the way through this game, solving those damn rectangles by collecting the puzzle pieces and running away from robots. I've played many successful games on the PC and other platforms which have similar concepts, but none have come close to the excellence of Impossible Mission. Gunhan Kaytaz The Star Treatment Then I received my October issue of W Computer Gaming World, I went right to the cover story to get the low-down on COMMAND & CONQUER: TIBERIAN SUN. I assumed I was going to get a review of the game-especially after seeing the cover, which stated \"Is TIBERIAN SUN Worth The Wait? We'll Tell You.\" But after reading the entire article, I asked myself \"So how many stars did it get?\" That was a review I just read, wasn't it? Look at the article you stated that you locked yourselves into a room for days \"to play the hell out of TIBERIAN SUN.\" You said that after playing the game, you felt it would live up to the hype, You went through all the new features. You even went into concerns about play balance. That sounds like a review to me-so where are the stars? Of course there is a technicality here--you have stated that it is your policy not to review games that are not finished yet. For all purposes though, this game was finished, based on the fact that you were playing a version that was just days away from being finished. Maybe that is why there are no stars here. But you DID review this game, so why did you essentially break your own policy AND the trust of your subscribers? Bill Richardson The October cover story on TIBERIAN SUN was not a review, although we originally intended it to be. At press time, however, the game still hadn't gone \"gold\" and was in the very late beta development stages. Since, as you correctly stated, we only review finished products, editors Robert Coffey and Tom Price weren't able to officially evaluate the game. We still feel like we still answered the fundamental question, however: Is it worth your money? In the future, we'll be more diligent about explaining what's going on in cases like this. And for the official word on TIBERIAN SUN, turn to page 120. Department of Corrections In last month's cover story, we incorrectly identified the ship date for Microsoft's FREELANCER. The game's official release date is late 2000, not 2001. In our October review of WEST FRONT BATTLE PACK 1, we listed the publisher as G.0.0. In fact, the publisher is TalonSoft. And finally, in our October READ.ME section, we mentioned WIZARDRY 8 as a game that had fallen victim to the CGW Cover Curse, implying that the game had been cancelled. Sir-tech Canada rang us up to inform us that the game is only very, very late, but development continues. They even sent us a screenshot as proof: in the October issue you guys did an article on TIBERIAN SUN. In it, I noticed that you said that the game didn't have rally points. I recently got the game and I found that there is a way to rally units. When you have the Barracks or Factory selected, press CTRL and ALT, then point to a spot and there you have your rally point. You can also group rally points by selecting multiple buildings, Tom Swift Contact the editors at cgwletters@zd.com.

"Read.Me The Latest News From All Around The Computer Gaming World X marks the Box Microsoft Secretly Developing a PC Gaming Console from anonymous industry sources close to the project. The push is on, and the battleground is your living room. The combatants? Sony, Sega, Nintendo, and L now. Microsoft. Several attempts at the \"Living Room PC\" have been made, but the units' hefty price tags-coupled with their not being very game-friendly-has kept the PC in the study for the most part. But with Sony touting its PlayStation 2 (PSX2) as a \"computer entertainment system,\" a lot of people in the PC industry, including Microsoft, are feeling very threatened. The response? Microsoft has been developing \"X-Box,\" the code name for their PC in the shape of a game console. Microsoft has flatly denied even the existence of X-Box, despite reports of game developers being briefed in the UK about it. Apparently, the iron curtain of secrecy has descended with strict orders not to talk, as evidenced during a recent trip to Redmond, where Microsoft officials could be seen rising in their chairs as their butt-cheeks stressfully clenched when they denied the \"rumors\" of XBox's development. But we still got the goods on X-Box Ramming Speed The PC and the home entertainment system have been on a collision course for some years now. Even though X-Box seems like a logical extension of the PC, it still opens up a huge can of questions about the future of PC gaming. Are we all going to be gaming in our living rooms next holiday season? What about upgradability? What about poor graphics quality because the TV is used as a monitor? All good questions, but the answers aren't clear at this point. To some degree, the line between PC gamers and console gamers has always been a little blurry, with CGW edi. tors and readers alike dabbling in the world of console tion 2 Announced While Microsoft Heats Up the Console Wars, Sony Announces Its Next Box n 1995, few in the gaming industry thought that consumer electronics giant Sony would have much success with their entry into the 32-bit videogame console market. The PlayStation went on to be one of the most successful gaming platforms ever, selling over 60 million units worldwide. With Sony's official announcement of the Playstation2's Japanese launch on March 4, 2000, and North American and European launches in the fall of 2000, few in the gaming industry are doubting that the PS2 will be anything less than blockbuster. Built around the 128-bit \"Emotion Engine\" CPU co-developed with Toshiba, the PS2 will be able to produce 66 million polygons-per-second at peak performance. Those numbers are ludicrously high and reflect a level of performance not seen even in the most powerful PCs currently available. The PS2 demo of GRAN TURISMO 2000 gameplay at E3 this year looked amazing, almost like pre-rendered cut scenes. The Playstation 2 will be much more than a powerful next-generation videogaming machine, however. The new 24x CD-ROM drive will not only be capable of playing PS2 and original PSX discs (backwards compatibility is a feature that Playstation fans with huge game libraries begged for), but will also be capable of playing DVD-ROM and DVD movie discs. So for about $350 (MSRP for the launch in Japan; may be lower for American launch) you can have a settop box that plays your old PSX games, amazing-looking new PS2 games, and DVD movies. It's hard to say at this point what kind of effect that's going to have on the video game industry much less the consumer electronics industry overall but it could be huge. Of course, most gamers want to know about the games, and GRAN TURISMO 2000 is the only officially announced launch title so far: but quite a few are already in development, including ARMORED CORE 2, TEKKEN TAG TOURNAMENT, and ODDWORLD: MUNCH'S ODDYSEE. Even though it's a year away, and the Sega Dreamcast is here now, many gamers are waiting for the PS2's arrival before investing in a next-generation console. The DVD capablities and backwards compatibility are pretty attractive features, but the PS2 will still have to compete against the Dreamcast, which should have a full head of steam by then, and the new Nintendo and Microsoft boxes, both of which are shrouded in secrecy. Still, the wild success of the original Playstation should give Sony a serious boost at launch time. 30 DECEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

But with the arrival of X-Box INSIDE THE X-BOX in the 2000 holiday season, the line will get even fuzzier, since you'll be able to play just about any new PC AMD Athlon CPU game in your living room. 1 64MB RAM And what about that hefty PC price tag?

But it's more than a year out, and a year 6GB hard drive in this industry is a mighty long Front-mounted USB ports time. X-Box will be equipped with an AMD Athlon CPU and nVidia's new GeForce 256 graphics chip, and should move 3D games along pretty handily. Couple that with a version of Windows 9X (not CE as has been rumored elsewhere) that's supposed to boot in under 10 seconds, DVD movie playback, and Web browsing abilities, and X-Box starts looking like a contender. PSX Games on the PC? Too Good To Be True? Maybe. PLAY HUNDREDS o canon Cames GGZ So, Are We Really Living Room Bound? This question is less about hardware and more about people and their gaming habits. The simple follow-up question is this: Do you want to play your PC games in your living room? X-Box won't ship with a keyboard and mouse out of the box, though you'll be able to connect them via a USB port. But if you want to have an inexpensive living room \"computing appliance\" that will be able to play PC games and DVD movies, then X-box will make that possible. PC makers are constantly looking to drive prices down into the range of home AV components, and X-Box-on paper anyway-appears to be one of the better attempts to do just that. But, does X-Box make the PC go away as we know it? Well that, fellow gamers (and rabid technology consumers), is up to you.-Dave Salvator Sega Dreamcast Launched leem! is a PlayStation emulator for the PC that allows you to pop your favorite PSX discs into the CD drive of your computer, and enjoy your games in 3D-accelerated glory. What does this mean for computer gamers? Will the lines between PSX and PC be blurred? Don't expect too many miracles out of Bleem!. It may be a great concept, but the software code it's built on needs a bit more development. The business model that Bleem LLC has developed to distribute Bleem! is quite ingenious, allowing for constant improvement and updating of the code. You download the software itself over the Internet for free, but then buy a CD key to unlock the program at $29.95 a pop. This allows the company to continually tweak the software to work better with more games. And tweaking is definitely needed. Bleem! does work, for the most part, but it doesn't provide the most satisfying gaming. Using D3D drivers, GRAN TURISMO looks great, but sound quality and muddy interfaces keep it from being the sublime title it is on the PSX.

"Read.Me The GOOD... More Trouble at Sierra Dynamix Closed, Games Cancelled as Company Reorganizes Again HOMEWORLD SHIPS It was a long time in coming. but it's finally hereand it delivers the kick in the pants the RTS genre needed. Our review is coming next month, but here's an early kudos to designer Alex Garden, one of the humbler. hardest-working guys in the business and welldeserving of a hit. Fear not, Alex-you delivered a good one. he press release arrived quietly and without warning in late September, and if you were a novice at reading marketing doublespeak, you might not think there was any bad news at all. But Sierra On-Line's announcement of a \"reorganization and enhanced focus on market success\" was nothing less than a devastating piece of news for many gamers. First of all, it meant the cancellation of a number of titles, including the highly-anticipated (and almost completed) BABYLON 5; two flight sims in development at Dynamix-DESERT FIGHTERS and PRO PILOT PARADISE; and Berkeley Systems CRASH LANDING BABYLON 5 is Tolkien game, ORCS: REVENGE OF THE one of the casualties of Sierra's latest ANCIENT. Also on ice, apparently, is MIDDLE \"reorganization.\" EARTH, the massively multiplayer Tolkien RPG announced with great fanfare and enthusiasm just one year ago. Sierra's reorganization involves splitting its products up into three business units: Core Games, Casual Entertainment, and Home/Productivity. Core Games will include the popular studios who survived the cutincluding Valve (HALF-LIFE), Impressions Games (CAESAR III), Papyrus (NASCAR), Relic (HOMEWORLD), Troika Games (led by Tim Cain, designer of Interplay's FALLOUT), and Massive Entertainment (GROUND CONTROL). Not on this list, most significantly, is Dynamix-the Eugene, Oregon-based company that was essentially the heart and soul of Sierra in its heyday. Most employees will lose their jobs, and Dynamix will cease to exist as a separate entity. Dynamix's TRIBES team will continue on as part of Sierra's Core Games group. It's a sad end to a studio which at one time made some of the best games ever, including three CGW Hall of Fame games: BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO, and RED BARON. As an interesting epilogue to this story, Pat Cook, the sports designer extraordinaire responsible for FPS FOOTBALL, recently signed up with Microsoft to head their sports division. During a recent visit to Microsoft, the CGW editors were going to meet with Cook, only to be told that he was in Eugene, Oregon-looking for job recruits. Jeff Green REDNECK RAMPAGE MOVIE Interplay's announcement that there will be a REDNECK RAMPAGE movie inspired no hoots and hollers over at the CGW office. Look, the game itself was basically one joke that stopped being funny after half an hour. Now we have to sit through a two-hour movie? The fact that the director of The Brady Bunch Movie and Dr. Doolittle is helming this project doesn't make it any more appealing to us. Y'all don't come back now, y'hear? and the UGLY... Reality Check While opinions varied on quite a few games, we evil media minions all questioned the point behind SKYDIVE! while simultaneously praising the uber-sequel SYSTEM SHOCK 2. Here's our roundup of 10 recent games and their corresponding review scores from the major gaming mags and Web sites. All scores use each pub's own scoring system.

Here's hoping all those line people who were laid off land on their feet.

"Read.Me 5, 10, 15 Years Ago in CGW Continued from Page 31 24-bit color at peak performance. Many games, like Sega Sports' NFL 2K and NBA 2K run at a super-smooth 60 frames-per-second. The 12X CD-ROM drive runs discs capable of holding up to one gigabyte of data, so expect a depth of gameplay and graphics unheard of on consoles. The cherry on top of this big triple sundae is an upgradable 56K modem. When Sega launches their online gaming network early next year, thousands of console-only gamers will be introduced to the brave new world of multiplayer competition over the net. Until then, Dreamcast users can use the unit to browse the net, a la WebTV. One big question remains: What about the games? We've only played a few, but so far we like what we see. Sega Sport's football title NFL 2000, is the best football game available right now, on PC or console, period. The smooth, motion-captured graphics are the closest thing we've ever seen to watching a real football game on TV, plus the underlying gameplay (including the elegant drafting system) is quite deep for a console game. Sega has always been known as a great platform for fighting games, and two of our favorite arcade titles, VIRTUA FIGHTER 3 and SOUL CALIBER are perfectly ported to the DC; SOUL CALIBER is actually improved upon. We're really looking forward to some of the PC crossovers to the DC, including RAINBOW SIX, SLAVE ZERO, and MDK 2. In our view, there's no denying that the Dreamcast is definitely going to change some attitudes about console gaming. Nov./Dec. 1984 Ill-conceived and poorly executed attempts to cap italize on fads have a long and glorious tradition among game publishers. Today's \"extreme sports games were yesterday's BREAKDANCE, an atrocious arcade game based on the 80s streetdance craze. The only thing worse than the game was the CGW editor's lame attempt to be funny and hip by using the lingo of the day in his review another hella nasty practice with a long tradition. /COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Pelet Origin Announces Ultima Online 2 New Massively Multiplayer World To Be 3D December 1989 And if you think the wave of deer hunting and bass fishing games--aka \"Bubba games\" is a new phenomenon, have a look at CGW in 1989. Among the games reviewed were AUSSIE GAMES, an arcade game featuring such events as belly whacking, bottle shooting, and marlin fishing. Then there was APBA PRO BOWLING, a text-only bowl. ing game, if you can imagine. And finally, there was BAR GAMES, which boasted such high-culture affairs as Pick-up Artist, Beer Sliding, and yes, of course, the Wet T-shirt contest. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD More s we went to press, Origin Systems announced that it was currently developing ULTIMA ONLINE 2, a sequel to their extremely popular massively-multiplayer RPG, to arrive in stores late next year. While the original ULTIMA ONLINE-still as strong as ever-will go on as is, VO2 will be a brand new game, a separate world, that will not overlap with the U01 world. Characters will not be transferable from the original game. As Jeff Anderson, UO2's executive producer, said in an interview, \"I have a great deal of respect for the UO community and how much work they put into their characters, but if you allow people to transfer those characters, you instantly populate the new world with too much stuff. It's our objective in UO2 to broaden the audience for this kind of game.\" As part of that effort, ULTIMA ONLINE 2 will feature a brand-new 3D engine it will not feature the Ultima Ascension engine, as we had reported last month). Anderson said that they had not yet nailed down whether the game would use a firstor third-person perspective, or both. (Also misreported by our own gossip maven Mr. Sneaky was the possibility of gamers being able to engage in online sex within UO2. This is not true, and Mr. Sneaky was spankednot in the good way-as a result). While it's still far too early for Origin to divulge any real details about the game, they did announce one intriguing feature: the involvement of Todd McFarlane, zillionaire creator of Spawn, who will help conceptualize monsters and characters and help develop action figures based on the game. When asked if there was room for another multiplayer RPG in the face of ULTIMA ONLINE, EVERQUEST, and ASHERON'S CALL, Anderson remained extremely confident. \"I think we've just scratched the surface of this audience,\" he said. \"A lot of the gamers are still waiting for an experience that is more accessible and fun. There's still enormous potential to grow this marketplace.

"CGW PROFILE Read.Me Are We not Vigilantes? Brian McCann DEER AVANCER Activision's INTERSTATE '82 Features Unreleased Devo Tunes This month CGW talks with Brian McCann, comedy writer for the Conan O'Brian show and creative force behind Simon and Schuster Interactive's DEER AVENGER 1 and 2. A PARDOYAW THE BEEN Does the world really need a DEER AVENGER 2? Quite honestly, yes. DEER AVENGER 2 puts money in my pocket, and the world needs that. I'm single-handedly responsible for so much beer consumption that I believe most breweries would quick ly go into default if I weren't supporting their efforts. What's a world without breweries, you ask? A sad one. An angry one. A world without laughter. A world without cheer. Sadly, the only way to avoid this disaster is to flood the already crowded computer gaming market with another \"deer gets rifle, heads to suburbs, shoots at people\" type of game. What are your favorite computer games? I've always been a fan of \"Guess your buddy's pin number.\" It's a time consuming game that isn't all that fun, yet it can really pay off big if you win. Try it, it's fun. What's the weirdest thing about working on the Conan show? Not too many people know this, but Conan insists that every single person that works for him gets a tattoo on their ass that reads, \"Conan is my pappy!\" He puts the tattoos on himself by carving them in with old coat hangers. ctivision's INTERSTATE \"76, one of the best games of 1997, achieved over-the-top greatness for one specifL 1 ic reason: its fantastic '70s-oriented funk soundtrack Now, Activision hopes do it again in INTERSTATE '82, enlisting none other than Devo, the quintessential '80s new-wave band, to provide music for the sequel's soundtrack. Most notably, the soundtrack will feature three previously unreleased Devo songs actually recorded in 1982 (around the time of the New Traditionalists album): \"Modern Life,\" \"One Dumb Thing,\" and \"Faster and Faster.\" I recently had the privilege of being the first game journalist to sample these songs, though (no kidding) I had to listen to them over the telephone. Given the less-than-stellar audio environment, I can still confidently testify-as a longtime Devo groupiethat the songs are, in fact, totally Devo, and will be must-haves for any Devo completist. Along with the three unreleased songs, the rest of the soundtrack was scored by Devo co-founder Mark Mothersbaugh's Mutato Muzika. Mothersbaugh, as some fans may know, has been doing soundtrack work for years, including the recent films Mystery Men and Rugrats: The Movie. The INTERSTATE '82 soundtrack will include \"homages\" to popular '80s artists that those old-enough-toremember will be pleased to hear again. During a phone interview with the band (which got off to a bad start when they called me \"Greg\" and I called them \"The Cars\"), Mothersbaugh and co-founder Gerry Casale talked to this unabashed fanboy longer than necessary about all things Devo, including the release next year of a multi-disc compilation set by Rhino Records, as well as Casale's possible interest in designing a Devo 3D computer game sometime down the line. Casale and Mothersbaugh said the band is constantly recording new material, and couldn't rule out the possibility of a future Devo album. \"Sometimes you're driving the big rig truck,\" said Mothersbaugh, \"and sometimes you're sitting in the rocking chair on the porch.\" Hey, you figure it out. When asked if they would go back to the '80s-their heyday-if they could, the answer was a resounding yes. Said Mothersbaugh, \"In the '80s, girls would run up to Gerry begging him to have sex with them. Now, they come up to him and say, 'I'd bet you'd like to have sex with me, wouldn't you?'\" Some game journalists know exactly how you feel, Gerry. -Jeff Green How many women have you slept with? Hey, let's keep this about the game, ok? 274. How come everyone in Hollywood says that you're the greatest comedy writer of all time? Look, it's kind of embarrassing to be singled out like that. Can we just remain focused on DEER AVENGER 2 and how wonderful it is? Rumor has it that you've had a three-way with Yasmin Bleeth and Morganna. No comment. Let's get back to the slick and funny DEER AVENGER 2, please. What does it feel like to know that every single 24-year-old babe in Italy wants to sleep with you? I know that's what the Poles say, but seriously, that has nothing to do with this game. Now, I'm only gonna take one more question, and please make it about the game! Bob Dylan claims you've made more of an impact on world culture then he ever did. Do you agree? Sure, I remember when Bob made those statements, and it seems every single time I sit down for an interview some smart-ass reporter has to dredge that up. Well, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of answering it. Thank you for your time. Goodbye. -Interview by Mark Asher 48 DECEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

Get this-it takes place in the past. While the game is centered on 1930's-era aircraft, this is no propeller-driven flight sim. The CRIMSON SKIES team (a little outfit called the FASA Corporation, responsible for the whole MECHWARRIOR and BATTLETECH series) is building the game with an emphasis on daredevil fun. Think Evil Kneivel meets Waldo Pepper. The gameworld is based upon a 1930's America fractured by an economic holocaust that has created approximately a dozen new countries, including the Nation of Hollywood, Free Colorado, Appalachia, and the Republic of Texas. Each of the invented countries has its own tongue-incheek indigenous air militia; for example, Hollywood has squadrons sponsored by movie studios (like MGM's Metro Marauders) and piloted by movie stars. The fiction behind the game permeates every aspect of gameplay, and should be integral to what FASA hopes will be a giddy sense of fun. Whether stealing Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose or gunning down zeppelins with your fancifully designed aircraft, CRIMSON SKIES may be the shot in the arm the wheezing sim genre needs-a light crossover hit that appeals to flight wonks and the broader gaming audience alike.

Let's start with the hottest selling game right now, COMMAND AND CONQUER 2: TIBERIAN SUN. Rumor is that Westwood is working on an addon, but reports of James Earl Jones filming scenes are false for now. Westwood is also considering a worldwide C&C 2 tournament. One of the surefire hits of this holiday season will be a surefire hit next year instead. With testing for DIABLO 2 slipping until By Seor Sneaky late October, Blizzard is already conceding internally that the game won't be done until February 2000. By the way, what happened to that 3D sci-fi action game they were working on? Is it dead, Jim? We may never know for sure, but BABYLON 5 may have been only a month or two from completion and might have been spared the axe if the BABYLON team hadn't been pulled off the project for nearly six months to work on RED BARON 2. What were they doing? Adding in the multiplayer component that Dynamix (R.I.P) never included. Is Eidos going French? Lots of X-COM stuff. First, the unannounced XCOM GENESIS looks like it will be a real-time game now. Next, Hasbro is really looking to pump life into the series as a multigenre, multimedia product. Expect an interesting launch\" in the near future as I was told that \"Fans of the series may have reason to rejoice.\" Hasbro is also looking at doing computer game conversions of some of the hallowed Avalon-Hill boardgames. ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER and PANZER BLITZ will be two of the first. GT Interactive has some problems. They've been sued for allegedly pirating a bowling game of all things, and now they're staring at an ugly 7-10 split as id, 3D Realms, and Epic are all interest ed in auditing GTI. What are they looking for? Any \"missing\" royalties they are due. Id threatened to audit six months ago and GTI coughed up $1.5 million in royalties that had been \"lost in the system.\" Latest Eidos rumor is that Havas is looking at buying them. Hey, at this point, the French could install Jerry Lewis as CEO of lon Storm he couldn't do any worse. I do want to squelch one rumor there is absolutely no truth to the story that John Romero is writing The Complete Dummies Guide to Game Development. Sheesh, I hate rumormongers! Verant Interactive, the hot development company behind EVERQUEST, is in serious discussions with a publisher to do a FPS team-oriented game set in a persistent online world.

"PREVIEW Blizzard Unveils the Answer to Gamers' Prayers by Elliott Chin GW has a secret to tell. Two years ago, we saw sketches for WARCRAFT III. And a year ago, we knew Blizzard was working on a powerful 3D engine for the game. We were sworn to secrecy then; but today, we can happily reveal to you the game that Blizzard itself has been dying to unveil. Yes, WARCRAFT III is under development-and has been for over six months. At this year's ECTS trade show in London, we sat down at a hands-on demo and really got to see what kind of a game WARCRAFT III will be. What we saw proved that Blizzard isn't settling for a tried-and-true sequel. Instead, they're hoping to create something new that will infuse an increasingly staid genre with creativity and personality. WARCRAFT III is not a real-time strategy game in the traditional sense. It's not a mission-based game where you start each scenario gathering resources, erecting buildings, and cranking out hordes of units. No, WARCRAFT III is narrowing its focus, injecting many role-playing elements, and is being touted by Blizzard as a \"3D role playing strategy game.\" WARLORD III GENRE: Strategy. RELEASE DATE: 04 2000 PUBLISHER: Havas Interactive DEVELOPER: Blizzard CONTACT: www.blizzard.com What's a 3D RPS? Blizzard defines the 3D RPS as \"a strategy game set heavily within a role-playing environment. WARCRAFT III will combine the focused combat and dynamics of a RPG and apply them in a competitive, strategic environment.\" It's a definite departure from WARCRAFT II, with six races instead of two, a 3D engine, a more WarCraft III THE MEN WHO FELL TO EARTH Meteor showers are more than just fireworks to catch the eye of this battling arc and human the Internal unit from the demonic Burning Legion plummel to earth in these heavenly fireballs. 58 DECEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "


"PREVIEW move the camera slightly, it will only be within a very limited range; basically, Blizzard doesn't think you should ever have to fiddle with it, since it would only distract you. Six-Way Race organic storyline, and numerous roleplaying elements. The new 3D engine looks very good, with incredibly fluid and lifelike animation. Both the terrain and the units will be 3D, and the units will be rendered with a skeletal and skinning animation. Unit animation is so exaggerated and full of character that no one should worry that this game will lack the personality of its predecessor. In fact, Rob Pardo, producer on WARCRAFT III, says Blizzard will be able to do an even better job due to the move to 3D. Despite concerns, WARCRAFT III won't be a MYTH clone. For one, there will be unit recruitment, town management, and the many RPG elements. Secondly, the camera won't be freeform, you won't have to deal with it at all. Blizzard says the camera will be fixed and lower to the ground, showing more of the horizon and giving you a wider view of what's ahead. Although you will be able to Campaigns and Interactive Worlds The campaign will play like an RPG-style storyline. Instead of mission briefings, you'll begin the game at your keep with your one hero, from there, you'll probably never leave gameplay again. NPCs will give you missions, moving the campaign along seamlessly. For example, when you leave your town to explore the map, you might suddenly meet a troll hunter loitering by the gate. When you greet him, he tells you that a human camp is nearby and you should attack it. He'll join you and suddenly, you have your first mission. While Blizzard hasn't said how many campaigns there will be, they did say you will get to play all six races in the open-ended campaignith four new races, the total of sides in WARCRAFT III jumps to six. So far, Blizzard has announced three of themhumans, orcs, and demons. The humans are the same as they were in WARCRAFT II, comprised of humans, elves, and dwarves. However, they are no longer the noble and good defenders of Azeroth. Instead, they have fallen to infighting, and only the arrival of the evil demons has rallied them together. Units on the human side include the dwarven rifleman, the human knight, and the human footman. The orcs have returned to their shamanistic roots, carving out a new life for themselves on Azeroth as they still fight the humans for respect. However, now that the demons have come to Azeroth, the orcs have no choice but to fight their former masters to save their new homeland. The orc side is composed of orcs, trolls, and minotaurs. The goblins and ogres such endearing members of the Horde in WARCRAFT II have switched allegiances. The last race we know of are the demons of the Burning Legion. The only unit currently revealed is the Infernal, a being composed entirely of flame and barely held in place by plates of armor. Infernals fall from the sky in comets, rising from the craters like creatures from hell. The Burning Legion once ruled the hearts of Orcish, but now that the orcs have overthrown the Burning Legion's demonic influence, the Burning Legion has seen fit to conquer Azeroth on its own. DARK TIMES AHEAD This is the spider temple, where the orcs must battle spiders and skeletons to save a blademaster here. BATTLE ROYALE This conflict between an ambushing or party and some encamped humans really shows off the 3D models and lighting effects. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. cow.gamespot.com . DECEMBER 1999 "


"PREVIEW WARCRAFT III which is still focused on the story of the orcs and humans. Another big change is a more interactive general world with lots of neutral locations and wandering monsters and mercenaries. You'll find towns to explore and temples and ruins guarded by hostile monsters. Inside each will be treasures and information. You might find townspeople to talk to, heroes to recruit, or mercenaries to hire in the town, while the ruins and temples might yield gold or imprisoned heroes. In the ECTS demo, we stumbled upon a human camp, a destroyed bridge, a spider temple populated by skeletons and spiders, a sage's mountain retreat, and a valley protected by a great dragon statue. Details will make the world even more alive. In the human camp, you'll see them sitting around a campfire and joking loudly when one might say, \"Shh...do you hear something?\" just before you attack. Additionally, music will be much more integral to the game and will change to suit onscreen action: quiet and soft during conversations, loud and fast during combat. SORCERESS The Sorceress, Warlock, and Shaman will be the spell-casting units for the Humans, Demons, and Orcs respectively. Still a Strategy Game Despite the heavy role-playing influence, though, WARCRAFT III will indeed be a strategy game. Rob Pardo takes pains to emphasize that there will still be lots of tactical combat, a tech tree, troop recruiting and upgrading, and even the building of structures. However, he says that in real-time strategy games, \"you spend about 70% of your time doing town management and about 30% actually out in the environment (in) tactical combat. We're looking to reverse that trend, so you'll spend 30% of your time lon town management and) 70% of the time you'll be dealing with tactical combat, questing, and interacting with the environment.\" In WARCRAFT III, you'll start in a keep, where you'll have all your basic unit-producing buildings and your hero. Says Pardo, \"The home keep for a player will operate in a very similar man ner to a WARCRAFT II town. There will be unit-producing buildings, a tech-tree (to research), and some base defenses. The only real difference is that we want to make it easier to manage, by taking out the need to build a huge sprawling base. Instead of building 30 structures to enable the tech-tree, the player will only need to upgrade his/her existing structures.\" So, strategy fans of the CRAFT series will still have to decide which troops to upgrade and when, and when and how to upgrade buildings to enable better troops. While you'll still research new troops, spells, and skills, these options will be open earlier and may also be dependent on more map exploration and questing. You'll still manage multiple squads, exploring the map and fighting the enemy. As for resources, the one confirmed resource is gold that will buy troops, upgrades, and building upgrades. You'll have METZEN 99 just enough to create a small party in the beginning of the WARLOCK game, gaining more as you adventure and kill neutral monsters. Later, you'll be able to build special structureslike farms, lumber mills, and towers that will produce continuous, additional gold for you. One key feature of Blizzard strategy games has been supply limit. In WARCRAFT II you had to build farms to support troops; in STARCRAFT it was pylons, overlords, and supply depots. Since the game is hero-based, you'll have to attach units to heroes to DIE, PUNY HUMANS Our orcs ambush another human camp with surprise, thanks to a troll hunter's information.

"PREVIEW WARCRAFT III 5 THINGS Five Orcs That Will Give Any Human Pause command them, with a hero's leadership rating determining how many troops you can field in battle (a rating of 2 gets you two troops to command, etc.). Since the maximum number of heroes you'll be able to command will probably be around six, battles will be more tactical and rely on fewer-but more effectiveunits. Fewer units means you'll be able to spend more time on them during combat, and you'll want to-because each will have a special ability. Orc grunts, for example, can go berserk, while wolf riders can throw nets. Pardo has little comment 1) MAKE NEW on the multiFRIENDS... This player supDwarven Rifleman is one of port, saying the new units in the series. only that 2) BUT KEEP Blizzard will THE OLD... While support more this Orc Wolfrider makes a players per triumphant return from the game than first WARCRAFT. WARCRAFT II's eight. Team play and questing will be supported, but there won't be persistent characters in multiplayer games. Blizzard feels it's important that the winner of the game be the most skilled player, not the person with the highest-level hero. At its core, WARCRAFT III is a deep strategy game, with upgrades, tech trees, and unit recruitment. But Blizzard is charting a new path for FTS titles by injecting roleplaying elements, shifting focus more to tactical action rather than to strategic building, while centering gameplay around heroes and quests. Every indication is that this newest chapter in the WARCRAFT saga will sustain the immersive gameplay of the original, while giving us a fresh look at the world of WARCRAFT itself. CGW 1. Orc Grunt The basic orc unit wields an axe in combat. The grunt's special ability is to go berserk. 2. Troll Hunter The Horde's only ranged unit hurls spears at opponents. Its special ability allows it to see heat signatures on the ground for tracking other creatures. 3. Orc Wolf Rider Back from WARCRAFT I, this very fast unit is best at hit-and-run tactics, as it is weak in melee. Its special ability is to ensnare and slow opponents with nets. 4. Minotaur This punishing melee attacker carries a large ball and chain. Its special ability is the opponent-stunning bull rush. 5. Orc Shaman The shaman can call on the forces of nature to fight its enemies, hurling balls of lightning and summoning lightning storms that ravage all creatures in the area. MUCH BIGGER THAN LIFE WARCRAFT III should continue the series' over-the-top sensibility just check out this steroid-loaded Heroes of Myth and Magic M o re important and rarer than normal units, heroes will have special skills, gain levels, and use magic items. Most importantly, you won't be able to control any units unless you attach them to a hero, so heroes become the central building blocks of tactical combat, much as in the turn-based HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC series. However, these heroes can fight, and they'll learn vital new skills as they advance that could include better leadership ratings, combat skills, or skills that enhance the performance of troops under them. You'll acquire heroes throughout the game, recruiting them at forts, gaining them through quests, or hiring them at neutral buildings. So far, we know of five heroes that will be in the game: the orc warlord, orc blademaster, human archmage, human paladin, and dwarf giantslayer. There will definitely be many more. Each of the game's six sides will have about six heroes to command, although not all will be unique. You might, for instance, be able to control two blade masters at once. With the game so heavily focused on heroes, Blizzard has decided not to penalize you too much should you lose one. Instead of holding your heroes back for fear of losing them for ever (as in STARCRAFT), you can throw them into battle knowing that they'll be resurrected in your keep should they die. The only drawback is that your troops will be left alone, and in WARCRAFT III, that means they're as good as dead. 62 DECEMBER 1999. cyw.gamespot.com . COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"PREVIEW Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Mark Asher Sovereign BIG BLUE MARBLE A fully-rotating globe of the world is the SOVEREIGN playing ground. You can use it to scout out potential sites for new cities or to keep tabs on deployed naval fleets like these. ohn Smedley, CEO of Verant Interactive, wants me to understand. \"This is an RTS game,\" he says, gesturing with both hands as if he's holding tight to an idea about to wriggle free. \"It just takes RTS gaming to the next level.\" Smedley is understandably concerned with labels when describing the massively multiplayer game SOVEREIGN. Verant's follow SOVEREIGN up to their GENRE: Multiplayer Strategy RELEASE DATE: 04 2000 huge online hit EVERQUEST is PUBLISHER: Sony Online Entertainment both a game DEVELOPER: Verant Interactive played in realwww.station.sony.com/sovereign time, and a game that promises the kind of depth we see in turn-based games like CIVILIZATION and IMPERIALISM. Toss in the X-factor of multiplayer games with anywhere from 4 to 500 players in size, and we've never seen a game quite like this. Size Does Matter SOVEREIGN is, first and foremost, big. Big in scale and big in ambition, the game is set in a world much like our own and employs current military technology. Just about any military unit you can think of is included-AWACS, subs with cruise missiles, VTOL transports, tanks--you name it, it's there. At the start of each game, the gorgeous 3D world is randomly generated and scaled in size to the number of players. SOVEREIGN is an empire builder at heart. At the outset, each player gets to place a city which can generate two of the eight to ten resources in the game. One resource will always be money. The second resource is based on the terrain you build upon. To get additional resources players build new cities, trade with one another, or buy them in the game's world market. Players can win by several different methods. For example, a game might have as a victory condition amassing a certain amount of money, or controlling a certain number of cities (either by conquering them or through alliances), or by cornering the market and controlling a certain percentage of two or more resources. Games with 500 players might take as long as a month to play. Such long games require interesting options, and Verant is building in a host of sophisticated rules normally seen in turn-based games only, such as morale for armies and citizens, tanks and planes that run out of fuel and need to be resupplied, complex research trees, and more. And yes, the battles are fought in real-time, but the sheer scale of the game, the realistic movement rates, and the cost of mounting and sustaining an attack will go a long way toward reducing the chances that SOVEREIGN will become a clickfest. To further discourage rushing, 64 DECEMBER 1999. cyw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "


"PREVIEW SUPPORT SYSTEM Among SOVEREIGN's innovative command options is the ability to put units on \"support\" duty. Instead of burning fuel by escorting these tanks, the aircraft will standby at their base, scrambling only when the unit they're supporting comes under attack. LLLLS troops and military units garrisoned in a city have their defensive and offensive capabilities doubled. SOVEREIGN'S strong role-playing element will let players develop characters that will accrue experience and gain new skills that carry over from game to game. Each of the six character classes comes with advantages; for example, Economists can borrow from the world market, Diplomats get a bonus in all treaties with other players, Scientists get a research bonus, and Theologians convert citizens into soldiers to send on crusades. As players develop their characters, they can customize them by picking from a vast number of available skills. To rise in levels, players get experience from successfully performing a variety of activities, including attacking and defending, spying, and building cities. Players can also lose experience, but it will be common to lose a game and still gain experience points. There's an abundance of diplomatic and espionage tactics available with players able to declare war, sue for peace, spy on enemies, engage in terrorism, and more. Players establish land, air, and sea trade, and other players can prey upon these routes as well. There's even a dash of card collecting in SOVEREIGN with its digital trading cards THIS LAND IS MY LAND But it's (DTC). A DTC not your land. Players can expect to battle over might raise the prime patches of real estate, since they'll determorale of your mine what resources a city generates and can provide natural defenses, like this mountain cities, or be a range. \"blackout\" card that blanks a region of the map from spy satellites. Verant will distribute new cards to players every week. Players will be able to trade DTCs in the game lobby. The big question is, how will a player's cities survive when the player is logged off? \"We're giving players three options,\" says Smedley. \"Players can lock down their cities, and all friendly units will automatically head to the nearest city and garrison themselves. Players can just log off, and units with orders (guard, etc.) will continue to move while the rest will head back to cities. Finally, players can let another player run all or part of their empire.\" SOVEREIGN is an extremely ambitious game. Unlike EVERQUEST, which is essentially non-competitive, SOVEREIGN is a cutthroat game that will pit players against one another, with backstabbing encouraged. There really hasn't been a game like this before, and if Verant can deliver, particularly in balancing the game properly, it promises to be one fascinating experience. CGW 5 THINGS 5 Cool Things To Do in SOVEREIGN SKYLINE Cities like this are the foundation for your budding empire. They produce your units, generate resources, and make pretty appealing targets for your enemies. 1. Torture captured spies to find out what they've discovered about you before sending them back with misinformation. 2. Use your spy as a terrorist to blow up enemy structures. 3. Have your spy assassinate a rival city leader to lower morale. 4. Invite a player into a secure chat room to discuss tactics, and allow another player to eavesdrop. Chat can also be encrypted and you can hand out keys to allow other players to break the code. 5. Have SOVEREIGN email or even page you when your ciues are attacked and you aren't currently playing, COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. cgw.gamespot.com. DECEMBER 1999 65 "

"PREVIEW ROLE PLAYING Pool of Radiance SSI Returns to the Pool to Launch Another Edition of D&D By P. Stefan \"Desslock\" Janicki GOLD BOX FACE LIFT This long-overdue sequel to the quaint old \"gold box\" RPGs is being updated in glorious 3D. Yes, you'll need a 3D card this time around. hen TSR launched the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons' Second Edition rules, SSI released the very first computer game adaptation of AD&D, POOL OF RADIANCE, and began the popular \"gold box\" series. After releasing nine similar AD&D gold box games (and a few spin-offs) with diminishing success, SSI forfeited the AD&D license to Interplay Productions, much to the chagrin of role POOL OF RADIANCE: RUINS OF MYTH DRANNORAL playing game GENRE: Role Playing . RELEASE DATE: 04 2000 fans. PUBLISHER: SSI SSI has now DEVELOPER: Stormfront Studios regained the right to produce at least one more Dungeons & Dragons game and aptly commissioned Stormfront Studios-the developer of the original POOL OF RADIANCE-to create a sequel to that classic title. POOL OF RADIANCE: RUINS OF MYTH DRANNOR is scheduled, appropriately, to be released around the same time as the Third Edition D&D rules. PUSH FOR EXCELLENCE RUINS OF MYTH DRANNOR'S 3D environment will include a number of interactive items. Here, a character pushes a table just because he can. BALDUR'S Influence The commercial and critical success of BioWare Corp.'s BALDUR'S GATE brought D&D back to forefront of the RPG genre, so it's not surprising that RUINS OF MYTH DRANNOR is similar in a number of ways to BioWare's game. Both games are party-based RPGs that use an isometric perspective and individually crafted pre-rendered backgrounds. But unlike BioWare's title, RUINS OF MYTH DRANNOR uses 3D polygonal models to sharply depict its characters and monsters. Backgrounds won't be flat, since a 3D-texture map will provide depth rendering so that characters appear at different heights. Characters won't be able to levitate or climb walls, but will scale furniture and other objects to gain a tactical height advantage in combat. The development team is promising to make interactive environments to allow your party to, for example, push tables around to block doors and bar advancing enemies. Only select objects will be interactive, so don't expect a comprehensive world-sim like ULTIMA VII; but 70 DECEMBER 1999.oow.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"PREVIEW POOL OF RADIANCE POOL PARTY RUINS OF MYTH DRANNOR will let you tote around a party of six, over which you'll have complete control. Combat will be \"phased\" timed turns. the availability of even a few interactive items will add an interesting dimension lacking in the static gaming worlds of BALDUR'S GATE and DIABLO. RUINS OF MYTH DRANNOR's plot ties into the original POOL OF RADIANCE and its three sequels. The story starts out in the Forgotten Realms city of New Phlan, where the mystical Pool of Radiance was originally unearthed. Legendary mage Elminster recruits your neophyte party and a more seasoned group of adventurers to investigate a new Pool that has appeared near the mythical elven city of Myth Drannor. When the veteran party meets an untimely fate, your party is mandated to acquire the skills to complete Elminster's task and avoid succumbing to the unknown forces that dispatched your allied group of heroes. Tabletop D&D has meticulously detailed Myth Drannor and its surrounding area, and the development team intends to incorporate existing maps and other source materialwhich should please tabletop D&D veterans. THIRD TIME AROUND The game's release is going to incorporate the just-announced D&D Third Edition rules, including all the changes in character classes. TRIUNDAR THT MRBARUAN AC TO MIT 20 DAMAGE0 200 GP WILL STA BIELT COC CLOSE It's My Party You'll create four inexperienced characters and be able to round out your party by asking two non-player characters to join your group. You'll retain complete control over party member NPCs and be able to direct their actions in combat and determine when they leave your party. Priests, sorcerers, fighters, rangers, rogues (the Third Edition name for thieves), and barbarians will all be available character classes. Excluded are paladins, traditional and specialty mages, druids, and monks, which is somewhat surprising since they allexcept perhaps those tree-hugging druids-are relatively popular classes. You'll also be able to create a multiclassed char. acter in accordance with the Third Edition rules. Humans, elves, half-elves, dwarves, halflings and halforcs are all available character races. Characters will be able to advance up to experience level 13 and access over 100 spells, including 6th level priest and sorcerer spells. . D&D has always placed an emphasis on combat, and the developers of RUINS OF MYTH DRANNOR hope to deliver in that department by implementing a phased combat system-essentially a turned-based system that limits the amount of time available to each character. Console RPG fans will be familiar with phased combat systems, which seek both the excitement of a real-time system and the tactical nature of turn-based combat. Some monsters will tower over your characters, enveloping a good third of the screen with their gigantic mass, and the early 3D models demonstrated to us featured impressive animated effects. The game will require a 3D video card at least as powerful as a 12MB Voodoo 2 card, which will also be used to create some spiffy colored lighting and particle effects for spells. Multiplayer support will be provided for six players, and a matching service like battle.net is being considered, as is support for voice communication between players over standard modems. Dungeon Heaven The developers of POOL OF RADIANCE: RUINS OF MYTH DRANNOR seem to be aiming to improve upon every aspect of BALDUR'S GATE, in addition to bringing back aspects of the popular gold box series. Interestingly, the game may well arrive on retail shelves around the same time as the inevitable sequel to BALDUR'S GATE, which should make late-2000 a pretty exciting time for RPG fans.

"PREVIEW Silent Hunter II Here Comes That Sinking Feeling Again by Marc Dultz ired of sinking helpless Japanese merchantmen at the drop of a hat? Ever wonder what it would be like to lay in wait for a cargo-laden convoy bound for England in the frigid North Atlantic waters? Well, mein kapitn, it looks like you'll get your chance: SILENT HUNTER II is preparing to set sail from the SSI sub pen. Like its predecessor, SILENT HUNTER II incorporates a stunning array of visual effects and cinematic soundtracks to dramatize each type of submarine engagement. Every ship and aircraft type will be fully modeled and accurately portrayed in many types of maritime conditions, ranging from fog and overcast skies to calm and heavy seas. Likewise, all of the important stations on the submarine will be modeled in exquisite detail, from the sonar room and bridge to the deck gun and periscope. The game will contain an interactive tour of a submarine, which not only will explain all of the important aspects of a standard U-Boat, but will also describe how each type of boat was used SILENT HUNTER II in combat. It GENRE: Strategy/Wargame. RELEASE DATE: 04 99 includes a fullPUBLISHER: SSI featured mission DEVELOPER: Aeon Electronic Entertainment recorder, which lets you record, save, and replay any of your missions at a later date. In addition, the game will include a dynamic campaign generator for more varied encounters, and an advanced scenario and patrol editor to let you create your own missions anywhere in the North Atlantic. When Silent Hunter was first being developed, SSI went to great lengths to ensure that the game accurately depicted life aboard a US submarine in the vast Pacific Theatre of Operations during WWII. For SILENT HUNTER II, SSI tracked down Erich Topp, former U-Boat commander and Admiral of the German Navy's post-war Bundesmarine. Topp not only serves as the technical advisor on the sequel, but also relates some of his chilling experiences in Der Unterseebootwaffe, including the sinking of several Allied ships. His experiences are sure to help SILENT HUNTER II track down and nail its target. CGW DIVE DIVE!

"AGE OF EMPIRES II CGW EXCLUSIVE REVIEW GAMING comePTE EDITORS CHOICE Fection arius, the Persian warlord and king, climbed a hill to watch his men cross the Hellespont on their way to a disastrous encounter with the Greeks. History has it that Darius, looking down on his ant-sized men, was overcome with the thought of how brief and cruel was the human life, and he wept. Having played AGE OF EMPIRES II and watched from my bird's-eye view thousands upon thousands of my men fall before the vicious computer opponents, I think I understand ol' Darius. For AGE OF EMPIRES II is as difficult as it is beautiful. AGE OF EMPIRES II: THE AGE OF KINGS (AGE II) is the sequel to the popular AGE OF EMPIRES, a base-building and conquest strategy game that, thanks to a strong design, a historically-inspired setting reviewed by and the almighty Microsoft label, sold and sold and sold to Chris Lombardi the final tune of about two million copies. AGE II comes almost three years after the first game, and a year after its originally scheduled release. Developers Ensemble Studios decided to delay the AGE II release in order to create the RISE OF ROME expansion pack, and to take their sweet time with the sequel and get it right. And did they ever. CGW RATED PROS Meticulously crafted graphics, sound, and interface; near-perfect play balance; challenging and charming single-player campaigns; varied multiplayer games and win conditions; loads of extras, including campaign/scenario editor and historical guide. WHAT A DIFFERENCE AN AGE MAKES Fundamentally, AGE 2 is the same game as the original. Your task is still to gather resources in order to build a base, develop technologies, and outlit an army capable of defeating your enemies. The game's challenge is still to strike the difficult balance between economic development and warfare. You can still win through conquest in battle, wonder-building, or the hoarding of artifacts (now called \"relics,\" which can only be transported by monks). And, again, there are 13 different civilizations to choose from although since we've gone from the \"Age of Empires\" to the \"Age of Kings,\" the Assyrians, Phoenicians, and Yamato have evolved into Persians, Byzantines, and Japanese, and the technologies have advanced a few hundred years. So, at a gross level, we've got the same game: but at the level of fine details and AGE II is all about fine, details we've got a vastly improved experience. CONS Minor annoyances with peasant behavior; typical RTS oddities in computer opponent tactics, extremely difficult on anything but the easiest levels. Requirements: Pentium 166MHZ, 32 MB RAM, 200MB hard drive space. 3D Support: None. Multiplayer Support: Up to eight players via Internet or LAN.

The Defensive stance is a huge boon to command and control, as the units will only fight within a certain radius of their position, and then return to their original position when the fighting is over.

"AGE OF EMPIRES II Ode to the Trebuchet FIAT ( 3 9 dward I of England refused the surrender of Stirling Castle in Scotland just so he could watch his newly acquired trebuchet, a powerful slinging catapult, destroy the castle walls. A cruel and gratuitous act, to be sure. But if his trebuchet was anything like the beautiful, graceful, and deadly machine in AGE OF EMPIRES II, then you've got to cut Ed some slack. GOOD TREE, GOOD FRUIT The complete technology tree is a click away. The tree tracks your development, so you always know what your next research step should be. improved unit path-finding intelligence, a mini-map that displays both economic and military information, a great tutorial campaign, advanced information displays that show your peasants' activities and your army composition and on and on I could go and it's quite evident that the developers have made every effort for the game to be as easy to play as possible. Okay, maybe not every effort. I have a few peeves that I wish had been addressed. Managing your farms is still a major headache. Off you go on a raid, only to return to find all of your farms lying fallow and your peasants whistling Dixie. Farm management was neither fun nor interesting in the first game, and it still isn't probably never will be. In a similar vein, I wish the peasants, after building a mining camp right next to a pile of gold, would actually start mining rather than staring at their navels. Combat units also have quirks; if given a choice as to which enemy building to attack, they'll always pick the least important target. They have a strange obsession with mining camps, and will attack them with extreme prejudice, even when more important targets lie nearby. ORDER OF BATTLE The new combat formations at work: Cavalry in front, men-at-arms allegiance. behind, archer in the third row, and priests and siege units in tow. Saladin's troops will pass pyramids on the road to Cairo. You'll wander through the streets of a recreated Jerusalem in order to destroy a battlement next to the Dome of the Rock. The Mongols will capture Chinese siege engines to actually take on the Great Wall. As a whole, the campaigns are varied and cleverly designed, drawing on the entire range of strategic possibilities: land and sea battles, multi-front wars, siege warfare, religious warfare, economic challenges... In addition to the campaigns, there are two head-to-head game styles against the computer, the standard open-ended competition and a new Regicide game, which starts each player with a castle and a king who must be protected at all costs. The opponent Al is extraordinarily good. Like most self-respecting gamers, I usually won't play a game on any level below \"moderate\" difficulty, but AGE 2 forced me to swallow my pride and play on the easier settings; unless you're some kind of RTS ubermensch, or you like to reload saved games over and over, you will too. AGE II seems to greatly improve upon the computer's ability to assemble combined arms attacks, and alter its unit production to counter your production patterns. Computer opponents also make capable allies now. When allied, the computer will ask you for resources it needs, give you resources you request (using a set of prerecorded multiplayer taunts and messages very cool), and tell you when it's about to launch an attack against another player. Yes, the computer will still do things that make sense only to its own strange silicon logic, and at times it has trouble coordinating its attacks for maximum effectiveness. But you know, that's the state of real-time AI, and that's okay; the computer is damn good at production, and the volume of its unit output can well make up for its minor tactical weaknesses. THE MIDDLE AGES GREATEST HITS The original AGE OF EMPIRES emphasized multiplayer games and random single-player scenarios over elaborate campaigns. AGE II retains this emphasis, but the developers have put a great deal more effort into five campaigns, each of which follows the career of a medieval military legend. The stories of William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Genghis Khan, Frederick Barbarossa, and Saladin are told with simple but beautiful pencil and charcoal sketches and quality voice-overs. Initially underwhelmed by the subdued production values and a few early scenarios involving \"foozle\" hunts, I was eventually charmed. The designers use the game engine to re-create ancient geography and form mini, quasi-historical pageants. Units will march up to your little Joan of Arc character and swear their Age II seems to greatly  upon the computer's ability to assemble combined arms attacks... to counter your production patterns.

As in the original, each Civ has a unique technology tree along with production bonuses. These differences have been enhanced, making the decision as to which Civ to play in which circumstance a very interesting one. Also, each Civ has a unique special unit that can be produced by its Castles, and there are some sweet units in the mix. The English longbowmen are a favorite, with their incredible range and power in large numbers. The Mongol Mongudai, a fast and fierce horse archer, are a devastating hit-and-run force. The variations in the Civs, as well as among the individual units, are finely balanced, there are no Civs that are clearly supreme in all circumstances, and there is no unit for which there isn't an effective counter. The wonder-building dynamic in multiplay is still delicious. Do you start building a wonder first and become the target of all other players? Or do you wait and build second, counting on the others to destroy the first? Or do you go all-out on the offensive and count on your aggression to crush all the wonder-wussies? There's nothing similar to this chess-like dynamic in any other RTS game. MINUTES A THOUSAND YEAR REIGN? When all of the improvements and additions in AGE II are computed to a final sum, AGE II stands out as one of the high points in gaming this year. The word \"craftsmanship\" is a word rarely seen in discussions of software, but it's totally appropriate for the level of excellence achieved by the AGE II team. The multitude of artistic and design details, and the remarkable rock-scissors-paper balance of the military units, testify to the devotion the designers have heaped upon this game. I, and I suspect many other gamers, will be playing this one for a long, long time to come perhaps even as long as the next age. CGW THE FIRST oals for the first 15 minutes are to build up a robust economy, explore the map, and advance to the Feudal Age (second age). You begin with three Villagers and a Scout Cavalry unit. When the game starts, immediately spend any food you have to build new Villagers. Then begin construction of one to three houses so that new people can be produced. Scout the map near your Town Center (using waypoints) to find Sheep, forage bushes, wild game, gold, stone, shore fishing sites, relics, coastlines, choke points, etc. Put one Villager on cutting a tree close to your Town Center. Put new Villagers on food (either Sheep, shore fishing, Wild Boars, or forage bushes). Harvesting one tree com pletely adds enough wood to the 200 pieces that you start with to allow you to build three houses, a Mill, and a Lumber Camp. Place the Mill next to forage bushes and the Lumber Camp next to the woods. After you have six Villagers on food, put the next six on wood. Put six more on food, and then put some on stone and gold. If fish are nearby, put more people on wood and build three to five Fishing Boats. Set gathering points on trees, gold, stone, fishing grounds, etc., to send new Villagers and Fishing Boats directly to a resource gathering site. Expand the map search with your Scout and get into the corners of the map to find enemies. Hit the period key occasionally to locate any idle Villagers, and put them to work. After 15 minutes you should have built at least one Mill, one Lumber Camp, a Barracks, a Mining Camp gathering stone, a Mining Camp gathering gold, and possibly a Dock supporting Fishing Boats. The best Ensemble Studio players have 25 to 35 Villagers/Fishing Boats at this point. Their economy is gathering resources quickly. When the nearby fast food sources are exhausted (Sheep, shore fishing, Wild Boars, forage bushes). players turn to hunting deer or building Farms. Note that you can build Farms in the Dark Age, but wood is usually at a premium. When you convert over to Farms for producing food, build 10 to 15 of them adjacent to Mills and Town Centers. There's nothing similar to this chess-like dynamic in any other RT5 game. 98 DECEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com . COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

Gold will be needed for many technology upgrades, and for building better fighting units. It may be useful to overload stone mining until you have the stone you need for a Castle, and then switch some of your miners to gold. Some players use Castles offensively, building one near an enemy. You must build at least two of the following buildings to move past the Feudal Age: Blacksmith, Market, Archery Range, or Stable. The first two are musts. The Blacksmith is where you upgrade the armor and fighting ability of your military units. Research Cartography at the Market to share line-of-sight with allies. At the Market, buy and sell commodities as needed to raise gold or get needed resources. The best players at Ensemble Studios don't wait for the extra few hundred stone or gold they need to be mined; they buy or sell resources to advance quickly. From the Market, you can also build Trade Carts that can be useful for bringing in gold from trade in a multi-player game. Archers are particularly useful on defense when placed inside Towers. Stable units are primarily offensive units but can be useful for defending against foot units attacking the town. To move past the Castle Age, you need a Castle or two of these: University, Monastery, or Siege Workshop. Castles produce your unique unit and the Trebuchet. Castles are also strong buildings with fighting power. At the University, you can research technology upgrades important for defense, plus technologies that improve your missile weapons. Chemistry allows Gunpowder units. Some players skip the Monastery. Monks built at the Monastery can quickly heal units that are within range and without orders. Monks can also pick up Relics and garrison them inside a Monastery, creating a modest flow of gold into your treasury. You can win the standard game by collecting and holding all relics in the game. @ Use CNTRL #groups to help control battles. One interesting economic decision is when to upgrade woodcutting, mining, Make one group of fast units for killing Monks. Villager productivity, and Farm productivity. These upgrades improve production of Another group might be infantry for killing buildcommodities in the long run, but may temporarily delay progress through the Ages. ings. Another might be ranged units that you can Whether to upgrade early (Feudal Age) depends on what is most important. If you target quickly to take out a particular enemy need extra wood because of fishing and other boat building, the wood cutting unit. upgrade is particularly desirable. The stone-mining upgrade might be needed because you plan to build multiple Castles. If little fishing food is coming and you have convert O Food is gathered most quickly from Sheep, shore ed to Farms early, consider the Farm upgrade. fishing, and Wild Boars. Boars fight back, howPlayers in a particularly safe map position may attempt to \"boom.\" They build 30 to ever. Hunt them with five or more Villagers to 40 Villagers and progress through the ages quickly. Boomers may feed resources to avoid having a Villager killed during the hunt. others who are taking the fight to the enemy or who are acting as a shield. In the middle and late stages of a game, delete Villagers and Fishing Boats that are If an incomplete building is going to be no longer needed.

This is espeties at the market for the best price. cially true for Castles. o if you plan to send Villagers into no-man's land, send multiple Villagers or upgrade their hit points with Loom technology to better withstand attack by wolves. Your Scout or other military units can also support Villagers. GROUP FOR FINE CONTROL For better control in messy battles, group like units together so they can be accessed using the number keys. Grouping is especially useful with range units. who are very effective when their fire is directed at a single toe. O If an enemy is using Monks against you, or you are fighting with expensive high-quality units such as Persian War Elephants, consider researching Faith at the Monastery to make it harder for enemy Monks to convert your units. THE RUSH Walling off and fortilying your base is an essential defense against the inevitable early rush by multiple computer opponents. And don't forget a gate, like I did here. The best defense against those batterinn rams is a cavalry rush, but the cav need a way out! If your Scout discovers Sheep far from home, it is unlikely they will walk to your town on their own without being captured by another player. One tactic is to select the Sheep together with your Scout and send the group home. The Scout will prevent the Sheep from being stolen without a fight, although the group will move at the speed of the Sheep. O Rollover text can be activated or turned off as you wish.

"HALL OF FAME SPECIAL INDUCTION Sid Meier GAME DESIGNER was never more satisfying-torch an enemy with a flamethrower and you'd be treated to the spectacle of a shrieking, burning man running in circles before crumbling into a pile of ash. Use a microwave gun on a victim, and you'd see their flesh goo and dribble away from their frame. While CRUSADER laid the foundation for later isometric standouts like DIABLO, it was the richness and interactivity of the gameworld that made it so incredibly addicting. Groundbreaking SVGA graphics created realistic futuristic environments where the glass bricks dividing office cubicles could be blasted to shards. Railings, walls, desks, chairs, and more were fully destructible, allowing you to leave a wholly unholy path of carnage in your wake. Further, objects in the world could be manipulated to allow you to seize control of turrets or surprise your enemies with lethal jets of scalding steam. It's a level of interactivity that we've come to demand in our action games. For that, and a giddily violent sense of fun, CRUSADER: NO REMORSE is a most deserving Hall of Fame title. CC keep the fun stuff and throw away the rest.\" This was the response of game designer Sid Meier when once asked about the secret to his design success. A coy remark, and, as we've come to learn, an outright lie. We now know the truth: Sid Meier is a virus from outer space.

Everything else was just feeble, third-rate swordsand-sorcery knockoffs, woefully out-of-date compared to the hot strategy and action titles of the day. And then came DIABLO. Blizzard Entertainment, riding high on the massive success of WARCRAFT II, decided to cavalierly ignore conventional wisdom for its next title, in a bold, conscious effort to bring the RPG back from the dead. And not only did they succeed better than anyone could have possibly dreamed, but, in the process, they made a computer gaming classic. DIABLO boiled the role-playing game down to its simplest, most visceral elements: hack-and-slash combat in an increasingly difficult series of dungeons.

"HALL OF FAME either/or situations-do you increase your magic or defense skill, upgrade your movement or attack ability-but they gave gamers new strategic elements to consider, letting them shape their alter egos to suit their strategy. HEROES II proves that fantasy has a place on the strategy gaming battlefield, and it certainly deserves a spot in the Hall of Fame. n't an RPG at all. It was too action-oriented, and the storyline, dialog, and character development were minimal. But to regard DIABLO this way was to completely miss the point of the game. By stripping the genre bare, what Blizzard accomplished-brilliantly-was to restore the one ingredient missing from RPGs for years: addictive, fun gameplay. Once you got into it, this was an impossible game to stop playing. Combat was fast, furious, and often, scary as hell. Every single element--the interface, sounds, graphics, weaponry, spellcasting, music-was calculated to create a tense, moody atmosphere that gripped you from the moment you launched the game. The game was accessible to newbies-introducing them to RPG concepts like leveling up and point distribution-yet kept hardcore gamers riveted for months. DIABLO revived a genre, was one of the scariest and most addictive games ever, and helped launch the online revolution. For all of these reasons, it easily earns a prominent place in CGW's Hall Of Fame. I MYTH Bungie, 1997 HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC || New World Computing, 1997 mihe definitive \"just one more turn\" strategy game, L HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC II was so incredibly addictive you practically needed a methadone program to stop playing. At its core, it seemed like so many other turnbased strategy titles, asking players to collect resources, build units, and obliterate enemies. The genius of the game was in the execution, in the heart of the game's design, which forever dangled carrots in front of the slack-jawed faces of mesmerized gamers. There was always another mine, another new unit, another spell, another enemy castle to storm-and they were all always just one more tantalizing turn away. HEROES II's embrace of its role-playing roots (in the MIGHT AND MAGIC RPG universe) added a layer of strategy missing in other titles: developing characters. The heroes leading your armies gained experience with each battle won, forcing you to choose between new or improved abili ties with each level they gained. The decisions were simple TAThile the rest of the industry was focused on how V to milk the Real-Time Strategy (RTS) genre, Bungie went ahead and did something new: They added another dimension. This third dimension wasn't just for eyecandy, though; either you remembered how important hills are in a battle, or you died horribly. Some of the other RTS games may have had elements of 3D terrain, but none were quite so visceral or effective as the 3D-accelerated landscape in MYTH. Moments such as marching your archers in a rainy swamp, or blanketing a mob of zombies with dwarven explosives, fulfilled the visual-titilation requirement that gamers want nowadays. MYTH didn't just rely on one gimmick, though. Wrapped around the beautiful 3D-engine was an intensely gritty campaign that echoed the other famous phrase: \"War is hell.\" Not only was the campaign well-written, it also required tactical thinking uncommon in other RTSs. With limited numbers of men and no resource gathering/building, you had to learn to intelligently use formations and the terrain in order to win. This wasn't a campaign you could blaze through, either; every difficulty level provided a good measure of challenge, and in fact, different difficulties created situations that required entirely new tactics. Add to that bungie.net support for the wide variety of multiplayer modes (King Of The Hill, Capture The Flag, etc.), and you had a game that would last a long time on the hard drive. All in all, MYTH was the closest gamers came to experiencing the brutality and beauty of medieval warfare scenes of the ilk found in Braveheart. It also proved that the strategy genre can greatly benefit from the 3D-acceleration craze. And so Bungie's visionary game deserves a place in the Hall Of Fame.

Not only are the planning screens more concise, but the addition of easily accessible game menus during the action phase provides for example a venue for remapping keys or enabling a joystick. complete most missions with a single operative, ROGUE SPEAR's improved Al means you'll need every operative. No more dumb terrorists blindly walking past their fallen comrades; terrorists are smarter, quickly reacting to noises and open doors, and ducking for cover when fired upon. WELL-DRESSED MAN How important is wearing the right camouflage? When your team's life depends on hiding in plain sight plenty. Elite Forces When the planning's done, it's time to execute your mission in one of 18 areas of operations. ROGUE SPEAR now sports a vastly improved action bar that is placed at the bottom of your cinema screen for easier team control. Need to recon the hallway before continuing toward your objective? Command your team to hold, and they'll form a defensive position until you signal for their assistance. Team fire and movement is more realistic, so your Red team, for instance, escorts hostages out of the building while your Blue team continues exterminating tangos. And when your direct supervision is required elsewhere, switching between teams and team members is easier to do. Unlike RAINBOW SIX, where you could 1. Study map layout; specifically insertion points, team waypoints, and loca. tions of objects and terrorists. Note possible ambush points for terrorists. 2. Get familiar with the GO codes and practice using them in the tutorial or Terrorist Hunt modes. If the situation demands a dynamic response, you can always change a team's ROE code. In order to escort hostages safely out of the area, don't forget to change the ROE code of your team to Escort. 3. Maintain timing from team to team. For instance, if you blitz two teams down two separate corridors before they meet at the entrance of the Opera House (where terrorists are holding hostages), it's very important that both teams are in sync so that their attack on the theater is numerically superior to the enemy. 4. Try to use the heartbeat sensor when not engaged. It will help in not getting your operatives killed by wellhidden terrorists waiting to ambush you. 5. Don't expose your entire body. Slice the pie by leaning down corridors or around doors to shoot when just a portion of the terrorist is in view. 6. Always know how many rounds remain in your magazine. If you get below ten rounds, it's time to reload, ideally in a spot where you're not THERE'S NO \"I\" IN TEAM Team coordination is now even more crucial to successfully accomplishing mission objectives. Thankfully, an improved interface makes it easier than before. exposed. 7. Remember that moving while firing effects your accuracy, so try not to blitz when firing at longer ranges. Full auto can be more of a burden than a help, so utilize three round bursts in weapons using this rate of fire. It'u help conserve ammo. DECEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "


"REVIEW HEAD CALL ROGUE SPEAR's realistic environments are great and character models that pant steam in the cold air only heighten the realism. This Kosovo mission is extremely dangerous, with plenty of sniper hiding places in the war-torn buildings. The higher la extends to your team as well-commandos no longer block your line of fire or get stuck in corners. Team operatives are more proactive, sometimes reacting to situations so quickly they dispatch terrorists before you even see them. To add to the realism, Red Storm added crouching and leaning movements so that you can look down corridors without exposing your character. Operatives can also climb on objects and walls, and jump off ledges. An auto-targeting feature assists target acquisition if you're having problems locking on tangos, but it's only available on easier game settings. The Deadliest Game Two of the most exciting additions are the Lone Wolf and Terrorist Hunt games. You get these options after completing a single player map: your goal is to exterminate 30 randomly placed terrorists with either a single operative in Lone Wolf or an entire team in Terrorist Hunt. Not only is this a great way to hone your tactical skills, but it's a great way of gaining proficiency in commanding your teams. Think of it as a more nerve-wracking extension to ROGUE SPEAR's excellent tutorial. Graphically, ROGUE SPEAR is just great. The environments are more detailed and evocative of real world locations. You really feel as if you're in Siberia disarming nuclear weapons, freeing hostages at the Prague Opera House, or taking out tangos at an ancient castle in Azerbaijan. The weather effects are awesome, with rain, snow, and wind adding to an already astounding mix of realistic environments. 3D sounds are marvelous as well, making ROGUE SPEAR a com pletely immersive experience travel along a sewer and hear the water rush underneath your boots. With all this visual splendor, it's a shame frame-rates sometime drop (especially when moving through wide open terrain) even on fast PCs with TNT2 cards. Some model clipping can still block your view, especially in tight corridors; then again, I've yet to find a 3D game where some clipping does not exist. The ballistics model is more realistic than before, so picking the right weapons for the right job is important. Snipers should utilize sniper rifles like the M-14 or Walther WA2000 for better long range accuracy, while close combat is better served utilizing COB weapons like the MP510SD or UMP45. You'll also have your choice of rounds. Shots are body-specific, so you'll need to place your fire so that you kill your enemies, if you don't, you can track them down thanks to the new wound effects that make everyone in the game bleed, leaving the telltale blood trails wherever they go. Maybe twice in multiplayer games did I notice a rare ballistics bug-an operative can shoot ter rorists at point-blank range with the mighty Barrett, but the bullet passes through without damage. Talk about your magic bullet. false turn and your hostages become the proverbial ducks in a barrel. It's incredibly tense and fun. Unfortunately, LAN games can be tricky at times, with the game perfectly simulating an alternate dimension mystery spot, where team members remain in the same game but can't see each other. Server options have been beefed up for multiplayer game cus. tomization. Now you can completely modify games by including ene. mies, auto-targeting, varied insertion points, kit restrictions, and other features. Arm patches have been added to player uniforms so that you can easily determine friend or foe. Still, it would be nice if the game shipped with a mission editor for modifying maps and games. In the final analysis, a host of revisions and improvements leave ROGUE SPEAR a big improvement on the original. Added realism, a greater accessibility, and even more inventively devious missions make this game the new benchmark of tactical simulations. CGW Cool Links The Killing Zone With a slew of multiplayer options to choose from, ROGUE SPEAR should last on the hard drive for a long, long time. Improved features and options cover about a dozen game types for either co-op or adversarial play.

What it isn't is groundbreaking or innovative. COMMAND & CONQUER: TIBERIAN SUN Ham & Cheese From the moment TIBERIAN SUN's install program announces \"Welcome Back Commander\" in faux low-res lettering, it's clear that Westwood is pandering to the nostalgic impulses of long-time C&C fans.

"REVIEW ACTION The Prince Is Back in Red Orb's Prince of Persia 3D Third Person Singular TRIPLE TRAP Blades to the left, blades underneath, and once you climb the wall, it starts to move pushing you toward the floor blades, PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D A ne mark of a good game is that you keep wanting to play it even after the \"wow factor\" has worn off. The dazzling graphics, the stunning animation, the lush virtual environment all the things that made you drool in the store get less exciting as they become familiar. A good game is one in which the actual gameplay keeps you coming back for more. The difference between a good game and a great game is this: Not only does the gameplay keep you coming back, but the \"WOW factor\" never wears off. I think it's safe to say that PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D almost passes this test. As of this writing, I have been playing it for the last six days and the hairs on the back of my neck are still standing straight up. But part of that is frustration. The game's appeal is not just that it's great to look at though God knows that's true but that PRINCE OF PERSIA 3D offers as reviewed by Charles Ardai rich and satisfying a total experience as any classic adventure movie The Thief of Baghdad, Raiders of the Lost Ark, take your pick. This is adventure on the grand scale, with scimitars and alley. ways and potions and death-defying leaps; with imperiled princesses, impassioned rescues, and impossible trials somehow survived.

"REVIEW BRAVEHEART Keeping What's Yours NOCTURNAL COLLISIONS BRAVEHEART'S 3D weather effects add considerable battlefield ambience. You'll fight in rain, snow, fog, storms, and nightfall. Just make sure you stay away from the trees when lighting strikes. EN EENEHMERZE s you conquer neighboring clans, build impenetrable lines of supply and communication by dotting them with keeps, stockades, watchtowers, and patrolling forces. A strong defensive position allows forces to quickly support attacks as well as your offensive moves. At the same time, keep your forces intact through managing their morale. Troops grow restless when engaged in the same task for extended periods, so rotate garrisoned troops, change their duties, and keep them well fed. If that doesn't work, disband them then reform from the peasant pool for a new, happy squad. DER Claymores Into Haggis Large scale, real-time 3D combat is BRAVEHEART's most distin. guishing feature, but also one of its biggest disappointments. Gamers familiar with MYTH's fluid combat interface will cry for mercy from BRAVEHEART's clumsy battlefield woes. Once your army reaches its military objective or is attacked, you have the option of backing out or of being thrust onto a 3D battlefield that takes some time to load. Every battle begins with complete disorientation, because you have no idea where enemy forces, towns, or villages lie. So you spend a good five minutes scouring the map searching for the enemy or, you can just read something entertaining while waiting for the enemy to find you. Sadly, computer forces blindly attack, even if their army pales in comparison to yours. You may form units into three formations a la MYTH, but this does nothing to enhance your tactical advantage since everyone ends up fighting in one big, massive scrap. The victor is usually the army with the most units, turning combat into a battle of attrition rather BLOOD ON THE HEATHER For all than battlefield its posturing as a tactical game, BRAVEHEART com prowess. bat generally boils down to bloody free-for-alls, The clunky where the army with the most guys wins. camera-control SELE2 interface is also a nuisance. Not only do your mouse and fin gers have to per form acrobatics to get the best viewing angle, but panning across the 3D environment gets even trickier. Throw in some clipping problems when zooming close to the action and you've got all the ingre. dients for frustration. On a positive note, BRAVEHEART is graphically stunning. 3D-ren. dered hills, trees, water, units, and objects, coupled with really cool night battles and weather effects, enhance the overall atmosphere and realism of BRAVEHEART. The battlefield has an authentic feel for what it must have looked like when facing a Tartan army seven centuries ago, the developers used topographical satellite images of Scotland for added realism. BRAVEHEART's battle sounds, unfortu. nately, sound trite and cartoonish. YOU'RE IN THE ARMY NOW Over time, your clan's arsenal should provide the swords, axes, bows, spears, lances, shields, and armor you'll need for equipping your troops. There are even ballistas and siege towers for assaulting enemy fortifications. Fair Is Foul and Foul Is Fair Then there are the hardware requirements. A whopping installation of 600MB on your hard drive is too much, especially since there's no minimum install choice. Add another 50 to 100MB for each saved game, and this becomes a real concern for those with limited space. In addition, stability issues with Direct3D forces TNT and TNT2 card owners to download a patch a patch that was released about the same day as the game. Talk about pushing something out the door. Multiplayer falls flat, because Eidos released a net game unready for prime time. At press time, you can only play direct connection or TCP/IP against four players, regardless of the manual's claim of up to 12 competitors. It's moot; due to BRAVEHEART's limited combat capabilities, a free-for-all battle grows boring very quick. BRAVEHEART's resource and territorial management is its only sav. ing grace. I was really looking forward to this game, and though I find the resource management highly addictive, the bulk of the game is a buggy letdown. Considering what this game could have been, that really pisses me off. As it stands now, if you wait for another three or four patches, BRAVEHEART will be a steal in the bargain bin.

"ROLE-PLAYING REVIEW I Know Diablo. Diablo Is a Friend of Mine. You, Sir, Are No Diablo. Darkclone ITSY BITSY SPIDER? These spiders win the prize for the most startling appearance. Most other enemies look about as threatening as a box of laxatives. 132 Phe marketing wonks at Gathering of Developers want you to believe that DARKSTONE will fill the void between DIABLO and DIABLO II and why not? There are a few great new elements to be found here, as well as much that is familiar. So do I recommend that you rush out to buy it? Well, that is the major problem with DARKSTONE. Of all its environments, it leaves me with the one that I'm least comfortable in the middle of the road. DARKSTONE FAMILIAR? Equipment, inventary, and attributes are handled in a manner most of us will recognize. Be prepared to do lots of equipment juggling. Déjà Vu All Over Again The premise will most likely be familiar to you: You must stop the evil that threatens to destroy the world by destroying the inhabitants of various dungeon levels, collecting gold and items to be taken to town. Once in town, you can buy and sell items, get quests, repair your equipment, and heal yourself. As you gain experience, you reach new levels and earn points that you reviewed by Greg Fortune can distribute between your character's four attributes these determine which weapons and armor your characters can use, as well as which spells. You will also find the standard health and mana system alive and well in DARKSTONE. Sound like anything you've played before? The game is not totally derivative. The most prominent new feature is the ability to take two characters into a dungeon in single player mode. You can choose from any of the four character classes, creating a team with complementary skills. You can switch between the characters at will, with the computer assuming control of whichever character you don't control. The addition of a rotating, zoomable 3D perspective is also welcome. It's very nice to be able to step back to control combat, and then step back in to grab items on the ground. You must also take food with you or forage in the dungeons, as hunger is a factor. There are new skills to learn in town, each with multiple levels to buy. These skills allow you to learn new ones that require no mana to use. If there are so many cool new features built on top of a successful framework, what's the problem? The problem is that, despite my thor oughly addictive personality, DARKSTONE never made me want to play it. Unlike DIABLO, I never felt that urge to put my entire life on hold so that I could be with it. The whole affair is decidedly ho-hum. Play some more, kill some more, sell some more, repeat. The character classes are cool, but they just didn't help me overcome a strong feeling of detachment. At times, it was almost boring tromping through yet another dungeon on another dreary quest-yet never so much so that I hated doing it. Even after I had finished the game, the thought of continuing on to a harder level left me thinking, \"Do I really want to go through all that again? Well, maybe...\" On the Fence So, you see the problem. I can't say that you should rush out and buy DARKSTONE because I'm sure you'll be hooked, but I can't say that you shouldn't rush out and get it, because it's still a decent game. The game's look and gameplay are strong, and there's a good amount of replay value. I just can't assure you that it will capture your imagination enough. DARKSTONE is a very solid game, but is it, as the ads claim, enough to make you forget about DIABLO II? I don't think so. CGW CGW RATED CAN YOU SAY TEAMWORK? The ability to take more than one character into the dungeon is a major step forward for this genre. The Rat Man, however, disagrees. CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS There are several townspeople walking about waiting to give you quests. It's too bad the only thing gained by completing most of them is 10,000 gold pieces. PROS Cool 3D engine; dual-character single-player mode; decent interface. CONS Lack of compelling environments and addictive play.

"REVIEW SPORTS MADDEN 2000 Kicks Off the New Season in Fine Form Boo-Ya! ONE SINGULAR SENSATION While waiting for the ball to arrive, players often demonstrate their love for Broadway musicals. Here, the Cowboys' Ernie Mills and the Falcons Marty Carter stage an impromptu chorus line. MADDEN 2000 Iven the most rabid Sunday afternoon Fox-watcher has to admit that John Madden has been slowing down. Where he once ener gized a game and served as the goofball-enhanced \"after\" to Pat Summerall's \"before,\" the big guy is now edging closer to obsolescence. Perhaps it's all those years in the broadcast booth catch. ing up with him, but now he's more cornball shtick than great show. Thankfully, the same can't be said for EA Sports' MADDEN football series. The most-celebrated franchise in PC sports gaming celebrates its 10th anniversary this reviewed by Brett Todd year, with perhaps the most complete re-creation of the NFL ever seen. MADDEN NFL 2000 has it all: cleat-crunching action, an involving franchise mode, and weighty enough stats to blow out tires on the famed Madden Cruiser. It has a few problems, but it's still a must-buy for anyone who gets couch sores each autumn. a Fill 'er Up All of MADDEN's longstanding features are back, many sporting spiffy additions. You can take the field in practice, arcade, exhibition, season, franchise, tournament, situation, and online modes. Franchise play returns in an enhanced format that supports up to 30 consecutive seasons. (I guess that was necessary to sate those Browns fans. Enjoy the rebuilding, folks.) COMING THROUGH As the Jags' Fred Taylor is demonstrating to the Miami defense and this terrified referee, you can Given the recent run the ball effectively in MADDEN 2000.

"REVIEW MADDEN 2000 FOUR BY FOUR Being able to open as many as four windows at the same time makes the user interface a chaotic mess. Even after two dozen games I didn't know if I was setting up games properly. And don't even get me started on that spacebar stuff. EXHIBITION A RENT T R E -CERLO ENOSA SCELLANTLAN INTERS ESPORTS TEAM SELECT STADUM SELECT SYSTEM OPTIONS CUSTOM GAMEPLAY CUSTOM TEAMS RENOTE PLAY CONTROLLER SELECT LOAD/SAVE GAME PM MENNESOTA NEN ENDEAN NEW ORL NEM YORK NEW YORK REFENSE SP. TEAMS A WAY CARBINES OVERALL UAENSE 4 . TEAMS OS IST IN DEALBETTNCS N ATAQSIM OPEN EN CONG 56K connection, most of my games have been lag-free. EA Sports and Tiburon have really upped the ante here. No PC football game can legitimately ship without killer online play now. You can replay 10 legendary matchups in situation play. You start with the Miami-San Diego overtime thriller from 1982 and work your way up. More classic teams can be unlocked by reaching in-game milestones and answering 200 trivia questions with the Madden Challenge feature enabled. The best new wrinkles are slider bars that allow the gamer to adjust aspects of the offensive and defensive artificial intelligence. Along with general guidelines telling the computer coaches to run more often than pass (and vice versa); and to call plays with a conservative, normal, or aggressive bias; you can tweak specific areas of gameplay. Offense, QB accuracy, pass blocking, WR catching, RB ability, and run blocking can each be modified separately. Defensively, you can tinker with awareness, pass knockdowns, interceptions, break blocks, and tackling. Special team settings can also be changed, in case you find field goals and kickoffs unsatisfying. A few games of experimentation, and you'll find the NFL you know. It's about time that designers gave us this sort of control over the Al. I can't recall a single sports game where I haven't cursed my inability to turn off a penalty that's called too often, or dial down some characteristic that was overblown. FAI A PRG PLAYER STADIUMO WAGAME OPTIONEN GC13 MNUTES SACHSEN RES36X L CN UNIDA INFO LINES GUL D E EGALINE NORMA R DO MICH OFT MADDEN di 2000 CHOOSE THE MATCH-UP THIS WAY, GUYS Arizona's Adrian Murrell leads the way on a dark and stormy night in San Francisco. Unfortunately for Adrian who's about to be placed in traction he's supposed to be behind the tubby guy on the upper left. Daylight at Last Perhaps the best news about MADDEN 2000 is that we can finally run the ball. If you've got a good enough offensive line, your running backs will see plenty of daylight. Holes open up just like they should. So say goodbye to the magic tackles that killed any sense of realism at higher difficulty levels in previous editions. As an example, I've been regularly guiding Emmitt Smith to 100-yard games in the franchise I'm currently playing with the Cowboys. It's not easy, of course, but it's doable. Passing is equally well done, although the Al slider bars have to be adjusted somewhat to avoid too many interceptions. I was getting between seven and ten a game before nudging up throwing accuracy and catching, and practically turning off interceptions. After this, I found just about everything to my liking. Backs and safeties no longer react to balls thrown in their direction with preternatural swiftness. The addition of \"hot route\" audibles where you can manually adjust a receiver's pattern with the gamepad is another welcome touch. It's a great way to take advantage of a suspect defensive formation. Passing plays are affected by one irritating problem, though. Players seem to have no awareness of where the sidelines are. Quick outs have to be completed at the speed of light, or your target will already be cruising toward the Gatorade. Even if you do catch the ball with both feet on the green, your momentum will likely carry you immediately out of bounds. I lost a lot of yards before finally just giving up on out patterns coming from the backfield. Given the enjoyable on-field play and the season and franchise options, longevity isn't a problem. Well...it isn't a problem as long as you can overlook a few quirks. Al trading still requires a fair bit of work. While you generally can't hoodwink anyone, computer GMS will often stage ludicrous fire sales in the offseason. So wait 'til June to rebuild that porous secondary. Poor clock management also stands out over time (no pun intended). The PC doesn't recognize situations as well as it should, leading to some bizarre play choices in the closing minutes. With no time-outs and a scoreboard deficit in the final seconds, a run up the gut is almost as likely as a Hail Mary. Another sore thumb is the interface. Equal parts REBELLION and FoxPro for DOS circa 1990, it is absolutely horrendous. Designers have provided a window system that allows us to open more than one at a time. Theoretically, this should make the whole thing a little like the standard GUI. Realistically, it's a nightmare where you can't figure out where anything is. And did I mention that the spacebar (?!) is used to enter some commands? I wish I could explain things better, but after two solid weeks of playing, I'm afraid I still don't understand it. Oh, and it also slows your mouse to an irritating crawl. I feel like I've developed St. Vitus' Dance every time I return to regular-speed Windows. All in all, this is easily the worst interface I've seen in a computer game, and it cost the game a half-star in the rating. Looking Okay Graphics and audio are about the only places that MADDEN 2000 doesn't set new standards for a football game. For an EA Sports title, the chrome isn't what it should be. The 3D-accelerated visuals are good, but they seem choppier and almost unfinished in comparison to last year's game. Animations stutter at times and heads, arms, and elbows go through opposing players far too often. Microsoft's NFL FEVER 2000 is far better from a purely graphical point-of-view. Sound also falls a touch short of current standards. Generic onfield effects are done well enough, but nothing stands out. Grunts, smacks, trash talking, and so on all seem canned and predictable. I was never really immersed in the game by anything I heard. And Summerall's and Madden's commentary actually had the opposite effect. Pat is confined to enlightening observations such as \"Third down coming up,\" while the big guy simply repeats many of the same things he said last year. None of it is useful or entertaining. But in the areas that really count, MADDEN 2000 is the real deal. Atrocious interface and minor aesthetic letdowns aside, this is the most entertaining and thorough tribute to NFL football currently available on the PC.

"REVIEW SPORTS Microsoft Goes Long With Their First Entry in the PC Football Genre DirectFootball 1.0 UPON THE FIELD OF BATTLE The rain is going to turn this field into a serious mess by the end of the game, kind of like what the 49ers are going to do to the Browns. the PC football game market is being fought over by two serious heavyweights this year. Electronic Arts' MADDEN 2000, the perennial 400-pound gorilla of the genre, has a new challenger in NFL FEVER 2000 from Microsoft, the 400-pound gorilla of, well, everything. The MADDEN franchise has run plenty of contenders into the turf, but this year, EA may have something to worry about. It's hard to resist the temptation to joke about Microsoft making sports games (the image of Bill Gates in a clean-room suit inspecting a pigskin comes to mind), and based on earlier attempts like MS BASEBALL 2000, it would be easy to apply a general stereotype about MS products that they are technically profireviewed by Tom Price cient, but lack \"soul\" NFL FEVER 2000 bucks that stereotype by offering one of the most realistic-feeling football experiences ever to be had on the PC. It's an intense and brutal football simulation that will have you shouting ESPN clichés at the top of your lungs and checking your face for cleat marks. NEL FEVER 2000 Hit Parade The immersive quality of the game can be credited mostly to the amazing graphics. Stadiums are accurately modeled, and fields degrade over the course of a game. Players are well designed with faces clearly visible under masks, body types that accurately mimic their real-life counterparts, and legible names on the backs of jerseys. Passing and running animations are top-notch, with pump fakes and fake hikes by the QB and a full compliment of spins and jukes for the run ner that for once don't look like they were motion captured by Barishnikov. But the animations really pop when it comes to tackling. In most other titles, a defensive player makes contact with the ballcarrier and a pre-rendered tackling animation ensues. In NFL FEVER 2000, such a great variety of things happen when players are tackled that one might think the programmers were using inverse kinematics or some other esoteric physics calcula. tions to render the animation. Example: Running back Garrison Hearst goes on a strong side sweep, and is wrapped up around the waist by the cornerback about three yards short of the first down. Any defensive player in the NFL knows that Hearst doesn't go down easy, so he starts dragging LITTLE BLACK BOOK The playbook provides numerous options for getting the ball into the endzone and keeping it out.

"REVIEW NEL FEVER 2000 La 49ERS 29ERSS 49ERS 1928353 HOA! YOU SPIN ME RIGHT ROUND BABY, RIGHT ROUND Tackle animations, like this sequence of Tommy Vardell getting upended, are expanded beyond simple knockdowns and wrap-ups. Check out the player detail, right, on the shot of Terrell Davis on the wrong end of a Billy Lyon piledriver, another move that will have you shouting \"that's gotta hurt!\" osa the puny CB slowly to the marker. Out of nowhere comes a linebacker who lays a hit on Garrison broadside, knocking him a few feet laterally, and spinning the hapless CB around on his axis. Replays of hits like that, plus guys getting upended and helicoptered around, are what you'll be showing off to your friends. Number Trouble NFL FEVER 2000 is hindered significantly by its lack of drafting capabilities or an ability to create custom leagues and sea sons. Maybe Microsoft assumed that those features are enjoyed solely by stat nerds who prefer a screenful of numbers over a screen into the numbers. But even Red Bull-swilling arcade junkies want to see their AB's passing rating. Microsoft clearly needs to add improved statistics, a draft fea. ture, and customizable seasons to this already.superb football engine before they make it to Monday night prime-time. Whatever depth the game lacks in customizing, it makes up for with a huge playbook and play editor. You'll appreciate the complexity of some of the plays deeper in the book, and you'll definitely need them when playing in All-Pro mode. But in the default rookie mode, running and passing are criminally easy. Your biggest full back can break loose for the endzone on just about any sweep play, and your air attack need only consist of sending all your wideouts on streaks. Thankfully, the Al gets much more clever and challenging as you dial up the difficulty. If the multitude of formations and plays are too much for you to digest, or if you would rather have a pro scripting your plays, you can choose one of the options listed under \"Millen's Call\" a group of plays suggested by color commentary man, Matt Millen. Millen is no Madden, but the guy's been in the trenches and knows his way around the gridiron, so the plays he suggests are usually good ones. Thankfully, the developers have also kept his and Dick Stockton's in-game commentary to a minimum, Ultimately, if you're looking for a fun, action-packed football title that's more realistic than NFL BLITZ (but with a lot of the same boo-yah factor), but less stat-oriented than FRONT OFFICE FOOTBALL, NFL FEVER 2000 is your game.

"REVIEW ACTION Updated SINISTAR Is a Fast Blast From the Past That Doesn't Last Back to the Future A REAL HEAD CASE This is your worst nightmare the ultimate Sinistar, looking mighty peeved and surrounded by a flock of his minions. SINISTAR UNLEASHED he underrated 1984 sci-fi flick The Last Starfighter chronicled the exploits of a teenager who went from humdrum ruralAmerican existence, to savior of the galaxy, in just a few days. All this because the kid kicked ET ass in a stand-up space-shooter arcade game that, as it turns out, was surreptitiously planted by our interplanetary allies as a way of locating natural born alien killers. Real-life video gamers never got so lucky. Yet the early 80s was a magical and expensive time for fans of this new breed of interactive entertainment, with hordes of quarter-suckers based on the \"blast the space ship\" theme. One of the most captivating machines of the era and surely an inspiration for The Last Starfighter was Williams Electronics' SINISTAR,\" a game that has now been significantly revamped and re-launched as SINISTAR: UNLEASHED. SINISTAR: UNLEASHED asks you and your trusty spaceship to reviewed by Gord Goble battle aliens and halt construction of their massive \"Jumpgate,\" a portal through which the ultimate space weapon, a Sinistar, will eventually emerge. Should the Sinistar arrive on time, prepare for a space barbecue with you as the main course. However, the longer you can hold off the completed Jumpgate, the longer the Sinistar remains in hyperspace, and the weaker it becomes. From a first or third-person viewpoint, you command an upgrade able ship wielding weapons that include single long and multiple short-range missiles, charging photons, concussion bombs, lightning storms, mind control, and nifty drones and turrets that orbit around you and fire independently. The catch? Crystals must continually be harvested from passing asteroids to keep your weapons energized. If you play your cards right, the Sinistar will arrive in substantially un-sinister condition and ripe for the picking, or, ideally, won't arrive at all. In this case, the jumpstation explodes in spectacular fashion and all is well. Until the next level, that is when you're off to another quadrant of the galaxy where another bunch of spacedinks are hard at work on another seemingly identical Jumpgate for the teleportation of yet another Sinistar. And that is the downfall of what is otherwise a frantic edge-of-theseat ordnance and graphics bonanza. Despite the rare bonus level where you're ordered to protect a colony or other such task, the game becomes a case of \"been there, done that,\" leaving you won. dering if you can take 20 increasingly more difficult levels of defending yourself from warrior ships, attacking others, hunting asteroids, stopping enemy transports, and making near-suicidal runs at the Jumpgate to slow its completion. Before that sense of repetition kicks in, however, SINISTAR is riotous good fun. And graphically, this is not the SINISTAR of your teens. Explosions are cataclysmic, from traditional fire and brimstone to wild plasmatic light shows. Each insect-like enemy vessel is distinct in appearance and movement, the Jumpstation itself is a translucent delight; and the backdrops are surreal in their makeup, color, and shading. Overall, SINISTAR is a sleek albeit CPU-intensive visual tour de force. Those, um, mature enough to remember the original game will be happy to know that the ultimate, final Sinistar retains his evil façade, vocabulary, and susceptibility to BURN, BABY, BURN! This ugly felyour nastiest low is reduced to an insect inferno with three weapon-the blasts from a short-range missile. The blue Sinibomb. If you appendages around the screen are the wings of were hooked on your craft, turned translucent for first-person view the game back in old days, or if you simply hunger to watch your explode in front of you, SINISTAR will deliver.

Wrong! TEST OF TIME does incorporate all of the expansions, but it also features a new wrinkle in gameplay. Now, you don't simply worry about the surface area of the globe, but also about undersea civilizations, underground civilizations, and celestial civilizations as well. Now, you not only add elements of magic and the far-future technologies that many believe are tantamount to \"future magic\" but you have the capacity to teleport T ERET and move both vertically and horizontally between venues and vistas. The new technology trees are sophisticated enough to warrant a new poster for each style of game (fantasy, original * * * * and extended, and science-fiction), and either the artificial opponents are smarter than in previous versions, or I've grown dumber.

We've played Tetris clones, Donkey Junior, Gin Rummy, and even Space Invaders rip-offs. But we couldn't get a sporting fix until we received TIGER WOODS PGA TOUR GOLF from EA Sports. The graphics aren't pretty, the tri-click interface moves a little slowly, and the putting is more difficult than it should be. But Palm owners will appreciate the quick draw times and the speedy mode of play, in which you can play 18 holes over a 30 minute bus ride. The game, solo or with real-life Al golfers, even comes with three courses.

"HARDWARE GAMING MACHINE. REVIEWS NEWS IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE  REVIEWS NEWS 10 TOP-OF-THE-LINE GAMING SYSTEMS REVIEWED In Search of The Ultimate Gaming Machine (part one) t's been one hell of a year for computing hardware. We've seen shake ups in both the CPU and graphics card arenas, as both the perennial performance champs, Intel and 3dfx, have been overtaken by upstart competitors. And hardware prices have continued to drop like the fall guy in a Don King boxing match. So, if you're ready for a gaming system upgrade, it's a good time to go shopping. To assist you in your shopping adventure, we've rounded up a pack of top-of-the-line complete gaming systems and put them through their paces. We've divided these systems into two categories: \"Burn, Baby. Burn,\" where price is not a consideration, and \"Bang for the Buck,\" where value for dollar is key. It's interesting that this year the line of demarcation between the two categories began to blur. We saw a couple of systems priced below $2,000 that turned in very respectable performances, and we also saw a lot less exotic hardware than in years past. Gone are twin SLI Voodoo2 cards eating two PCI slots. Hell. there wasn't a Voodoo2 board to be found in any of the systems we tested a testimony to the fading importance of having Glide support. And our earlier findings about AMD's Athlon outgunning Intel's Pentium III were confirmed with the three top performers this year all using Athlon. Intel's Pentium-III shouldn't be discounted, however, as it made several very respectable showings. Another interesting finding was that the gap between the winners and the rest of the pack narrowed considerably. This was due in large part to the big system makers getting their 3D graphics card acts together, and making sure that they can make 3D games not just the word processors and spreadsheets go fast. There's a lot to cover, so strap yourself in-and let's have at it. by Dave Salvator and Loyd Case Fierce Competition Among Hardware Makers Means Great Gaming Machines Are More Affordable Than Ever Systems photographed by Michael Falconer 166 DECEMBER 1999. cgw.gamespot.com. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "


"HARDWARE Burn, Baby, Burn! Performance at All Costs GADGETS FOR GAMERS For this section of this roundup, we're looking for the best there is in gaming rigs, irrespective of price. This, obviously, can lead to some pretty ridiculous price tags: but we're looking for a Testarosa, not an Escort. For some gamers, these systems will fill the bill nicely. For others, it's more a chance to see just how fast these things can go. Intel's hold on the high ground of PC gaming has been broken. AMD marshaled its forces and pushed Intel off the peak of performance leadership, and even allies like the new GeForce 256 3D accelerator didn't help. This year, we found ourselves in a bit of a dilemma: On the one hand, Falcon Northwest once again kicked ass and took names, but then there was Dell with their Dimension XPS 1600, just four points off Falcon in 3D GameGauge, and $1,500 cheaper. In some sense, we're breaking our own rules here, since we normally don't factor price into our final decision in the \"Burn, Baby, Burn\" category. But given a price difference this big, we just couldn't overlook it. So we're declaring a tie, but each system gets the nod for a different reason. Falcon is in the winner's circle yet again for simply being the fastest system in the roundup that ran nearly hiccup-free. Their attention to detail and choice components make this latest iteration of the Mach V yet another in a series of impressive gaming boxes from this crew of Oregonians. Dell, on the other hand, delivers a solid box with a lot of performance, but for considerably less money than the Falcon. True, Falcon has better components in several instances, including speakers, case, and mouse, but Dell nonetheless delivers very solidly. Another system of note was Sys Technology's Cold Fusion, which married an active refrigeration unit with an Athlon running at 800MHz. However, Cold Fusion's performance was marred by sub-par performance of the Diamond Viper 770 Ultra's stock Diamond drivers. Gateway, Compaq, and Micron also nipped at the leaders' heels, and even the slowest of the big rigs were no laggards by any means. Is it real or is it Parkay? This battery-powered, full-scale MP5-A5 airsoft model faithfully reproduces nearly every detail of the real submachine gun used by SWAT and special forces teams. The MP5-Ab extends and folding stock extends and retracts. The sights adjust. The magazine detaches. The selector switch lets you toggle between semior fullauto: Pull the trigger in full auto mode, and this baby spews out 800 rounds of 6mm plastic pellets per minute until the magazine runs dry. To keep the party going, slap in a fresh 50-round mag. Or to rock'n'roll Hollywoodstyle, use high-capacity mags that hold 200 rounds each plenty for chewing big gaping holes through lots of bull's eyes. Among the must-have accessories is the fauxsilencer, a cleverly disguised tracer unit ($145) designed for use with special phosphorescent ammo. The result: a showstopping stream of brilliantly glowing tracer streaks truly, not to be missed! Airsoft, $395, www.747imports.com. BURN, BABY, BURN COWINNER Dell Dimension XPS 600B CAMING EDITORS: CHOICE I hen it comes to making a solid if somewhat generic machine, Dell has the routine down pat. Their latest Dimension B series continues that trend, offering Intel's new Pentium-III 600MHz B CPU. The B designation means this CPU has a 133MHz front-side bus (the connection between the CPU and the North bridge), though it lacks an integrated Level 2 cache. Dell's entry was unique in being the only rig in the roundup to use Intel's new 820 chipset. Other components include a Creative Labs graphics card powered by nVidia's GeForce 256 chipset, as well as Creative's Sound Blaster Live Value. Another interesting footnote: Dell's box was the only one to arrive with DirectX 7 on it (the rest have DX 6.1a, which is part of Windows 98SE). As for performance, Dell presents an interesting case. They offer somewhat unbalanced performance that favors games over traditional benchmarks. On ZD benchmarks, with the exception of WinBench 99's Disk WinMark and 3D WinBench 99's 3D WinMark, Dell's scores are all below the group average.

"HARDWARE In Search of The Ultimate Gaming Machine HOW WE TESTED Dell Dimension XPS 600B (continued) GameGauge this Dimension shines, essentially tying Sys' Cold Fusion box for second place. Interestingly, Dell's use of the 820 chipset and RDRAM only bought them two points on 3D Game Gauge, versus the Gateway high-end system (the systems are otherwise nearly identical). Other notables include Dell's choice of Harmon/Kardon's HK-595 Sound Stick speakers. Curious-looking things, the 595s sound pretty good overall, and develop decent, though not ear-shatter. ing volume. But at louder volume levels, it became evident that the magnetic shield ing on the satellites wasn't enough to prevent magnetic interference with the 19\" Dell Trinitron display. So if you're considering Dell, you'll want to steer clear of the Sound Sticks until they revisit this magnetic shielding problem. All told, Dell has put together yet another very competent, albeit boringly beige, box that thanks to good component choices makes high-end games run very fast. www.dell.com. Price: $3,300 as tested BURN, BABY, BURN ROWINNER **** Falcon Northwest Mach V GAMING EDITORS' CHOICE very year at this time, the dynamic duo of Loyd and Dave have to bid farewell to loved ones and embark on the yearly quest that takes us down to ZD Labs, the mother of all testing labs, for two weeks of testing, testing, and more testing. While locked away in this Tech Mecca, we put these systems through a series of brutal tests that look at all sub-systems' perfor mance, and especially at how well they run games. We're looking to ferret out weakness; to find bugs, glitches, or any shortcoming that might keep a gamer between them and the thing they love most. We start with ZD's benchmarks, including WinBench 99 (2D graphics, hard-drive, CPU), 3D WinBench 99 1.2 (3D graphics), CD WinBench (CDROM), and finally Audio WinBench to look at CPU usage by the sound card while playing WAV files. Next we bring in the big guns, which are the nine 3D games we use (seven Direct3D, two OpenGL) that comprise 3D GameGauge 2.0, whose final score is an average of the nine demos. The Direct3D games are: EXPENDABLE, MADDEN 99, UNREAL, DESCENT 3, POWERSLIDE, and JANE'S WWII FIGHTERS. The OpenGL titles are HALF-LIFE and QUAKE II. We run 3D GameGauge tests at 1024x768x16-bit with V-sync turned off to \"let the ponies run;\" that is, to give the most accurate performance picture possible. And finally, as this year's fillrate torture test, we used QUAKE 3 TEST v. 1.08. We ran the game at 1024x768x32-bit with all the rendering goodies (vertex lighting, trilinear filtering, flare effects) turned on. We also looked at case accessibility, and other bells and whistles that can add to the gaming experience, to round out the system's overall rating. And of course mainly because we like annoying everyone at ZD Labs we put the bundled speakers through our RFL (really frickin' loud) test to see how they handle game audio. Dave Salvator alcon Northwest once again leads the pack, though the pack is baying at their backs. The Mach V demonstrates that a judicious combination of well-tuned components can outpace other systems that may be stronger in individual areas. This year's Mach V marries a 700MHz Athlon with their Xentor 32 Special Edition TNT2 Ultra card, to beat the Sys box by an average of four frames per second on 3D GameGauge 2.0. The Sys Technology Cold Fusion boasted a faster processor, but its Diamond Viper 770 Ultra couldn't stand the heat. The Gateway came stock with an Nvidia GeForce 256 card, which pumped out one of the highest QUAKE 3 scores, but the overall 3D GameGauge average suffered, because the 600MHz Pentium III couldn't cope. The rest of the Mach V's components were a curiously conservative choice. We would have preferred the Optiquest V115T (which has an aperture grill tube) over the more sedate V115. A natural flat monitor like the Mitsubishi 2020u would have been better still. Falcon's choice of the Creative DTTS-2500 speakers is great for gamers, since it can do both four-channel DirectSound 3D imaging, as well as 5.1 Dolby Digital imaging for DVD movies but it couldn't match the audio quality of the THX-certified Klipsch speakers that came with the Compaq. We did run into a couple of crashes with the 3D Game Gauge tests, but all-save one-were resolved by removing EMM386 from the Mach V's CONFIG.SYS file something needed only for certain DOS games anyway. Also, the MADDEN 99 test seemed quite sensitive to heat, and would lock up periodically as it did on the IBM system also. In the end, the Mach V performed superbly, but the boys in Ashland better keep looking over their shoulder. The competition's getting wiser by the day. Falcon Northwest . www.falcon-nw.com.

"HARDWARE In Search of The Ultimate Gaming Machine BURN, BABY, BURN ** * Compaq Presario 5815 rompaq likes engineering. No, strike that, UCompaq REALLY likes engineering, sometimes to a fault. Past systems saw configurations that were obviously put together by engineers who sort of forgot to have their case designs reality-checked for usability. Their notorious inverse mezzanine card for I/O slots will live in infamy as one of the great knuckle-busters of our time. But Compaq must have heard the complaints levied by users and analysts alike, because their latest box continues an encouraging trend of using good commodity components, and putting them into an accessible box. Compaq was the only entrant this year to include a digital flat panel (DFP) display, which was unfortunately only 15\" (viewable screen about equivalent to a 17\" CRT monitor). The only problem with this choice is that the DFP uses the now-proprietary PanelLink connector, which means you're essentially married to the graphics card that comes with the system thankfully based on the TNT2 Ultra chip. Future DFPs will use the DVI (digital video interface) connector, which is different from the PanelLink pin-out. Compaq also gets credit for being the only system with USB ports where they belong: on the front panel of the CPU; and it's the only system with FireWire (which goes under Sony's name i-Link). The only problem here is that Compaq put them low on the front panel, and given that the case is a tower form-factor, it's most likely going to live on the floor, making these ports not as accessible as they could be. Compaq also has what are without a doubt the best sounding speakers in the roundup in Klipsch's four channel ProMedia v.2-400s. These babies carry THX certification, pack a 400-watt power amp (that's right, 400 frickin' watts), and put out some serious sound. Another plus: This Presario also has a CD-RW drive. As for performance, Compaq fared quite well, owing to their choice of an BURN, BABY, BURN **** Athlon 700MHz CPU and TNT2 Ultra graphics. Their 3D GameGauge score of 59.6 tied them for the bronze medal with Gateway's high-end entry.

"HARDWARE In Search of The Ultimate Gaming Machine BURN, BABY, BURN *** IBM Aptiva S Series 865 BURN, BABY, BURN A* Micron Millenia Max 600/133 The IBM system revealed little ironies throughout our testing. Only the IBM, for example, came in black, complete with matching black bezels for floppy and CD-ROM drives. The case popped open quite easily without tools, but the latch was cleverly hidden at the bottom of the chassis bezel. Inside was a Maxtor hard drive, making IBM one of the few systems to ship without an IBM hard drive. The Vortex 2 chip was on the motherboard itself, but the Infinity speakers lacked punch. And the less said about the kludgey mouse, the better. On the other hand, it did have a 650MHz Athlon CPU and an ELSA TNT2 Ultra card. The ELSA isn't the fastest TNT2 Ultra card you can get, and it showed in the game tests. Its 3D GameGauge score of 47.9 not a bad score until recently outpaced only the Future Power system. The ELSA card does have TV-in as well as TV output, and a home phone-line networking card was plugged into one of the PCI slots. Finally, the IBM had three USB ports on the back, a total exceeded only by the Compaq. Despite having relatively low scores, IBM gets the most improved\" award. It offers decent performance, a good set of components (except for the lame speakers), and comes in black. And that's not a bad combination. n pening up the Micron system is a dream. Lift up a catch on the U side, and the cover slides off neatly. Inside, you find a swing out plastic bracket that can hold additional cooling fans it needed. Liftina this up reveals a most interesting motherboard, which uses the VIA Apollo Pro 133 chipset. This chipset fully supports PC133 SDRAM, and the Micron came equipped with a full 128MB of PC133 memory. Unfortunately, the VIA chipset actually held the Micron back. You can see this best in the CPUMark 99 and FPUMark scores, which trailed all the other 600MHz Pentium III systems. Although equipped with a 600MHz Pentium Ill and a Creative Labs nVidia GeForce 256 card, it posted benchmarks sig. nificantly slower than the 440BX-equipped Gateway system. The low-end Monsoon speakers get the job done, but they won't win any awards for volume or audio quality. Kudos go to Micron, however, for supplying a CD-RW drive to facilitate backups. Also, Micron ties with Compaq and IBM for shipping a chassis that wasn't just a plain beige monolith. We'd love to see more interesting form factors and colors in the future. One problem we encountered was with AGP 4x mode. The 3D benchmarking software kept crashing until we disabled AGP 4X, so clearly some work needs to be done with the chipset or BIOS. While we applaud the use of technology such as PC133 SDRAM, the VIA chipset needs attention before it can match the through. put and stability of the more mainstream Intel 440BX core logic. www.micronpc.com. Price: $2,841 www.aptiva.com Price: $2,888 as tested AMDA Athlon AMD The King Is Dead! Long Live the King! It's a shooting war, finally. During the opening days of World War II, Polish cavalry made valiant but fruitless attacks against the German onslaught. Like the Polish cay, AMD has been fighting the good-but-fruitless fight against the Intel juggernaut, but has been hobbled by relatively poor performance in games when stacked up against Intel CPUs. As this roundup demonstrates, that's no longer true. It's as if the Polish miraculously got hold of a few dozen M1 tanks. Of the ten systems reviewed, the top three slots were captured by Athlon-based systems. Given that a 700MHz Athlon simply clocks faster than the fastest Pentium III system, that may seem obvious but again, that hasn't been the case in the past. As we saw in our recent testing, an Athlon system will run games faster than a Pentium III at the same clock rate, all other things equal. And if AMD can crank out high clock rate CPUs that are stable, more power to them. However, AMD would do well not to rest on its laurels. We've seen the first 820-equipped system in the Dell system, and while its scores don't approach Athlon, by the time you read this, Intel will be shipping 667MHz and possibly faster Coppermine CPUS. All of the Athlon systems we tested used the AMD 751 chipset. While it does support some advanced features, such as ATA/66 hard drives, it doesn't offer AGP 4X or advanced memory types (like PC133 SDRAM or RDRAM). Those advances will be left to chipset maker VIA, whose Apollo KX133 chipset looks like it may deliver the goods. We weren't encouraged by the performance of VIA's Slot One chipset, but the KX133 is newer, and the Athlon's raw horsepower may overcome any deficiencies. What is clear is that this Intel/AMD slugfest is now a much more evenly matched fight on the technology and product fronts. Intel's sheer size and resource base, plus its manufacturing prowess are now its competitive edge but not its CPUs. The world has changed. -Loyd Case 172 DECEMBER 1999. cgw.gamespot.com.

"HARDWARE In Search of The Ultimate Gaming Machine BURN, BABY, BURN **** Sys Technologies' Cold Fusion level O), which accounts for Sys' first place finishes in storage testing. In stark contrast, their CD WinBench score was the lowest of the pack. The Sys rig is a solid competitor to be sure, and a driver update to nVidia's 2.08 reference drivers might be all it needs to take the brass ring. But one issue with the active refrigeration unit is that if the day comes and it's a ways off, to be sure you want to upgrade the CPU/motherboard, you'll probably have to ship the unit back to Sys, or forego active refrigeration on your next CPU. www.sys.com Price: $4,299 as tested ys gets the \"close but no cigar\" award this year, with its Cold Fusion system. Sys' claim to fame is that it ships the only 800MHz X86 CPU on the planet, thanks to their use of Kryotech's active refrigeration units that allow Sys to take a 600MHz AMD Athlon CPU and over-clock it 33% to 800MHz. The Kryotech unit chills the CPU to a frosty -55° C, which keeps the seriously over-clocked CPU from going up in smoke. The result is impressive, though not quite as impressive is it should be. Sys' inability to claim the crown lies in their decision to go with Diamond's stock driver for the Viper 770, based on nVidia's TNT2 Ultra chip. In the wake of the S3/Diamond merger, Diamond has been very lax about posting driver updates, and had yet to incorporate nVidia's 2.08 reference drivers at press time. The result is a somewhat unbalanced system, with a very potent CPU coupled with a fast 3D graphics chip that should go faster. And the proof is in the numbers. Sys trounces all comers on CPU tests because Athlon has proven itself a very worthy CPU, and because Sys is running the chip 100MHz faster than the next competitor. The speedy CPU also put them on top in 3D WinBench testing. But turning to 3D GameGauge, the Viper 770's drivers delivered a score of \"only\" 61.43. Now bear in mind, this is the second fastest score in the roundup, and is only four points off winner Falcon NW; but given Sys' 100MHz CPU advantage, and that it's using the same 3D graphics chip as Falcon, Sys should have won handily. It didn't. Sys packs aboard a Promise EIDE RAID array, running twin IBM DeskStar hard drives striped together to form a single volume (RAID Intel 820 Chipset: Worth Waiting For? 57.5 3030 Intel made a lot of hay at their recent Intel Developers' Forum (IDF) about the new 820 system chipset. \"Look at this neato benchmark we wrote to show 820's higher memory bandwidth with RAMBUS, versus the 440BX chipset with SDRAM. The 820 delivers nearly three times the system memory bandwidth of the 440BX box. Pretty cool, huh?\" This was the mantra. Well, we viewed the results with the skepticism one should when seeing any vendor-created benchmark. The results could be true; they could be bogus; or more likely, they could be true given a very specific set of conditions. What we did find when we got our own Intel 820 to bang on is that using current benchmarks, an 820-equipped system with 800MHZ RDRAM was no faster than a similarly-equipped 440BX-based system CPUMark99 FPU WinMark 3D (see table). This was further borne out by how Dell whose latest GAMEGAUGE Dimension is equipped with the 820 and RDRAM fared versus the other boxes in this roundup. As you can see from the test results, Dell was about on par with but not much faster than the other contes44.1 3030 tants. So what can we conclude from this? On paper, the 820 chipset should make games go faster with its speedier front-side bus, architectural enhancements, faster system memory, and AGP 4X. But for now, there's not really any difference Could it be that the 820 chipset has more \"head-room\" than the 440BX? That current games haven't brought the 440BX to the \"knee\" in its performance curve where it will run out of gas, whereas the 820 will keep going? Given the 820's specs, and admittedly giving Intel a little benefit of the doubt, that's probably the case. But we won't real. ly know until we have more demanding titles that push the \"plumbing\" harder. We're looking into some newer games currently in development that will do just that, and when they're ready to be rolled into 3D GameGauge, we may be able to see just what the 820 chipset buys us. But until then, the 440BX/820 showdown is basically a draw.

"HARDWARE In Search of The Ultimate Gaming Machine Bang for the Buck: Gaming on a Budget BANG FOR THE BUCK WINNER GAMING EDITORS Hypersonic Silver Bullet SE CHOVICE m he second part of the Ultimate Gaming Machine roundup is where we get tough with the system makers. What we want is the best gaming machine they can build for under $2,000 (including monitor), which involves making tradeoffs while at the same time keeping system performance balanced. What we found here were two competent boxes, and one that could be a contender with a different 3D card choice. All in all, these three systems ran well through our tests, and two out of three would be good choices for gamers on a budget. ypersonic, a new entrant into our Ultimate Gaming Machine competition, proved to be In this year's winner. With a Pentium III 600MHz CPU, a Voodoo3 3500 over-clocked to 195MHz, and 128MB of SDRAM system memory, this box proved itself to be a solid contender, scoring 54.1 on 3D Game Gauge testing. It just edged out the Gateway, owing primarily to its 100MHz CPU clock advantage. The Voodoo3 3500 has some digital video features that were still rough around the edges, but the rig does ship with the 3500's AV input/output breakout box. The crew at Hypersonic wrings a little more performance out of the 3500 by over-clocking it to 195MHz, and to keep things cool, they include twin fans mounted above the AGP slot in the case to move more air across the chip. The system was very stable, and we experienced no lockups. The one limitation with the 3500 is that it can't run in 32-bit color (despite 3dfx's claims of \"22-bit equivalent rendering\" using a post-RAMDAC filter), which is why Hypersonic took a \"Did Not Run\" in 3D WinBench and QUAKE 3 testing at 1024x768x32-bit color. If you like, however, Hypersonic's alternative graphics load-out is Guillemot's Xentor 32, based on nVidia's TNT2 Ultra. Other accoutrements include Cambridge's Four Point Surround speaker system, replete with flimsy rear-channel tripods. Although real Tinker-Toys would make for better tripods, these speakers coupled with Hypersonic's choice of the Sound Blaster Live Value deliver good four-channel output for DirectSound 3D-enabled games. We also liked their keyboard and mouse choices: Logitech's New Touch keyboard and the MouseMan Plus USB mouse. Getting into the case involved removing two screws and sliding off a side panel, which allowed easy access to most system components. Storage components were easily accessed, with a removable cassette for the hard and floppy drives that could be pulled after removing one screw. Pulling the second side panel allowed for access to all mounting screws for the DVD-ROM. All told, Hypersonic has put together a terrific box for the money. You'll need to add game con trollers to taste, but given how personal a decision that is, it's probably better left for you to decide anyway. www.hypersonic-pc.com Price: $1,999 as tested ULTIMATE GAME MACHINE BENCHMARK TEST SCORES 238 3D WinBench (1024x768x32) 785 887 972 Compaq Presario 5815 Dell Dimension 600B Falcon NW Mach V Future Power Gateway Performance 500 Gateway Performance 600 Hypersonic IBM Aptiva S Series Micron Millenia Max Sys Cold Fusion 3D Quake III GameGauge Fill Rate Torture Test 5 9.64 37.6 61. 2338. 4 61.23 65.52 39.1 25.90 (crash) 53.64 15 42.5 42.5 59.61 42.9 55.09 55.09 (did not run) (did not run) 47. 87 3 5.4 57.52 5 37. 61.43 31.1.

The Power Series uses Diamond's Stealth III S540 (based on a 125MHz Savage4 chip), which managed to drag the 3D GameGauge score down to 25.9 over 20 points lower than the second slowest system. Although this system is the least expensive in the roundup at $1799, it simply can't keep up. Here's where a Voodoo 3 card would have been a much better price/performance choice for gamers. One cool feature of this system is the audio controls on the front, tucked into one of the 5.25\" drive bay. It even sported a LED graphic equalizer, which allowed you to tweak the audio, though the Spatializer audio adds excessive reverb without really creating any sense of, well, space.

"HARDWARE Under the Hood BY LOYD CASE System Upgrade 2000 CPUs above 650MHz will have both features. So a Pentium III 650 EB CPU has both embedded L2 cache and the 133MHz FSB, for example. Making Sense out of the Bevy of New Upgrade Options he year 2000 will surely bring with it a number of incredible new advances: personal rocket-packs, complete meals-in-a-pill, and an end to human labor. But sadly, it won't bring an end to the age-old human dilemma: How and when should I upgrade my gaming machine? Between Intel's unveiling of their Coppermine Pentium-III CPU and 820 system chipset, and AMD's impressive Athlon chipset performance, the upgrade puzzle for the following six to nine months just got a few more oddly-shaped pieces New questions arise: With Intel's new wares, is AMD's Athlon still faster? What happens to all my old SDRAM? Will AMD be around to support Athlon? Will my hardware investment stay with me for the next year, or three? Let's try to sort out this mess. Now the Good Part... Here's where we get to the good news for upgraders. You don't have to upgrade everything-CPU, motherboard, and memory-at once. The 820 chipset supports both PC100 SDRAM and the newer RDRAM RIMMs. This is good news, because moving to RDRAM means discarding your current memory. And since RIMMs will initially cost two to three times as much as the PC100 SDRAM, you'll be paying through the nose if you really want the latest technology. The reason for the outrageous prices for individual RIMMs is that all the big system-makers-Dell, Compag. Gateway-will be grabbing almost all the available R DRAM for a few months. But most 820 motherboards The good news for upgraders is that you don't have to upgrade everything at once. once. U Getting to Warp Factor 13 Let's talk CPU performance. You've seen the numbers that show Athlon is faster for games than a Pentium III at the same clock speed. But there's more to a system than raw CPU horsepower. As games-particularly 3D games-become more complex, the ability of a system to move data around from chip to chip becomes just as important as raw CPU speed. The fastest CPU in the known galaxy is reduced to a glorified doorstop if the system chipset \"data pipelines\" aren't fast enough to feed the CPU data when it needs it. It's in the area of \"data pipelines\" that Intel is innovating with their new 820 chipset. When these \"fatter pipes\" are coupled with the new Coppermine Pentium III CPUs, the performance gap between the Intel and AMD CPUs will narrow. The fatter pipes include AGP 4X (1.1GB/sec of maximum throughput), a 133MHz frontside bus (FSB), and a new memory type, RAMBUS DRAM (RDRAM, a.k.a. RIMMs), with a peak data rate of 1.6GB/sec (twice as fast as current SDRAM). The next consideration is the Level 2 cache type. Anything with an on-chip cache is one of the new Coppermine class CPUs. These new CPUs are built using a higher-density semiconductor process, which enables Intel to put 256KB of Level 2 cache on the chip itself. Intel has also finally lifted the veil of secrecy shrouding their new Coppermine CPUs. But with this unveiling comes a new alphabet soup you'll need to understand, so hang on. You'll now be seeing some extra letters at the end of a Pentium-III's designation. The letter \"E\" means the CPU has embedded Level 2 cache. Next, the letter \"B\" indicates that the CPU has a 133MHz FSB. And any CPU over 650MHz won't have any of these markings, because all will also ship with sockets for PC100 SDRAM. Any CPU with a 100MHZ FSB clock will run in most newer 440BX motherboards, although you'll almost certainly need a BIOS upgrade. So if you bought your system in the past year, you're protected to a great extent, especially if you've built your own or are comfortable with upgrades. So if you have a 440BX system that's less than a year old, you can probably install a Coppermine CPU that runs as high as 650MHz. If you want to upgrade your motherboard, then you can drop in an 820 motherboard, a Coppermine CPU, and your old PC100 SDRAM. Just know that any new Intel CPU with a \"B\" designation (133MHz FSB) will need an 820-based motherboard. Then there's Athlon. The new chipset from VIA supports PC133 SDRAM. At the same clock speed, the Athlon CPU is definitely faster than a Pentium III, but the question is: Will an Athlon system be as fast as a Coppermine system? At press time, I still couldn't buy an Athlon motherboard from my usual sources, and I can't recommend something you can't buy. From our testing for the Ultimate Gaming Machine roundup, Athlon-based systems cleaned up, taking the number one, two, and three slots in 3D GameGauge performance. The jury's still out on Intel's 820 chipset. 3D GameGauge testing didn't show any real performance gain versus 440BX, though I suspect that as the newer, more complex titles come out, 440BX will begin to run out of gas whereas the 820 will keep going. It's a good time to be a gamer. With 500MHz CPUs at rock bottom prices and the top performers hitting 700MHz, anyone can afford a good gaming rig. CGW 84 DECEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com.

"HARDWARE \"Which 3D Card Should I Buy?\" f there's one question readers have asked us more than any other, this would have to be it. So-you asked for it, you got it. Choosing the right 3D card depends on your CPU and your motherboard. So, we have two recommendations for you: Choice A: If your CPU is a Pentium 233MHz or slower, or your motherboard is all-PCI (no AGP), or if you've got a motherboard-down AGP graphics chip with no AGP slot, then get 3dfx's Voodoo2 1000 board. At just under $100, it will do a very good job with current games, and a pretty good job with games coming out soon. And the best part is, when you swap in a new motherboard/CPU, you can migrate the Voodoo2 board to the new setup. Choice B: If your rig's motherboard has an AGP slot, then go with Guillemot's Xentor 32, which was still the fastest 3D gun in the west at press time. At about $200 street price for the 32MB version, this card is well priced for what you get. Even if you're running a Pentium-11 233 or 266MHz CPU. when you upgrade motherboard/CPU, you can migrate the card into your new setup, and it has room to grow with whatever CPU you mate it with. NVidia's new GeForce 256 chip has just been announced, and it looks to be a serious contender, but we didn't have a product at press time to test. Look for more on that next month. Product Watch What? Still No Athlon? Evolution of a species Engineered to win his month's Power Rig is still using the 600MHZ Pentium III. But you can rest assured that it's not a conspiracy against AMD. The Athlon is demonstrably faster in games than the Pentium Ill at the same clock rate, but finding a motherboard that you can buy has turned out to be quite a chore. Over the next month, we'll be checking out several Athlon motherboards. If we find one that's stable with the components in the Power Rig, then you may see the first non-Intel Power Rig Machine ever. Loyd Case Saitek Intel 820 Chip Fails to Make Good First Impression ntel has a world of worry about AMD's Athlon. Athlon has proven itself to be a worthy competitor, besting the Pentium-111 across the board. We were wondering if Intel's new 820 chipset, with its faster front-side bus, faster main memory, AGP 4X and faster disk controller, might not even the score a little.

"HARDWARE TECH MEDIOS Tech Medics You've Got Questions, We've Got Answers by Loyd Case and Dave Salvator I just installed a Voodoo3 card to replace my old Monster 3D II. But when I try to run a game that uses Direct3D, the game locks up or goes into software acceleration mode. Help! Wounded on the technological front? Our medics may be able to patch you up and get you back in the action. Send your gaming-related technical questions to cgw_hardware@zd.com. Go to the 3dfx Web site at www.3dfx.com/view.asp?IOIDE 96 and download the DELV.INF file to your desktop. Now, uninstall your Voodoo3 drivers and reboot; you'll be in VGA mode. Find the DELV.INF file on your desktop, right-click on it, and select the installation option. This will remove any old 3dfx drivers, including those leftover from the Monster 3D II. Now reinstall your Voodoo3 drivers and you should be good to go. Ever since installing the new edition of Windows 98, the Shutdown and Restart commands have not worked right. When I select Shutdown, my computer restarts, and when I Restart the computer, it goes to a black screen. Any idea what is COMMAND will allow up to three players on a network to play with a single CD. Other games, such as NEED FOR SPEED III, allow you do a multiplayer-only installation on multiple computers. However, the majority of games require that you have a CD in each computer when you play multiplayer. wrong? I recently installed a Voodoo3 3000 in my computer. Since then, I've have a number of problems relating to \"Shell32.dll,\" which I discovered to be a desktop icon library. I get general protection fault and invalid page fault errors. My icons have disappeared, for the most part. I tried changing the icons, but to no avail they just show up as white boxes with a few scattered pixels of color. The weird part is when I open the icon libraries, the icons look fine there, but on the desktop they are all messed up. I reinstalled Windows 98, but this didn't seem to work. What can I do? Yes. Run MSCONFIG by selecting the Start button, selecting the Run command, and typing \"msconfig\" in the text entry field. Under the \"General\" tab, select \"Advanced.\" Check the box labeled \"Disable fast shutdown.\" That should do the trick. Help! I can't run the BATTLEZONE II demo! I get a blue screen of death, a weird message, and the whole system locks up! If you have Windows 98, check out Tweakul, a program that can be found in the following directory: \\toolsTreskit\\powertoy. There's a \"repair icon\" tool built into Tweakul that should fix your problem. Note that if you have Windows 98 Second Edition, it doesn't come with Tweakul, but you can find the program on the Internet. One place you might look is members.theglobe.com/ windows 98/software.html. I recently set up an Ethernet network at home with 3 PCs. I want to play some of the games my son enjoys head-to-head, but I'm wondering if I need a second copy of the game (or third, if using the third PC), or is it possible to play multiplayer with one copy? Check your CONFIG.SYS file. Chances are you have the EMM386.EXE memory manager loaded. The BATTLEZONE II demo and a number of other Windows games don't like EMM386.EXE. The memory manager may have been installed by your system vendor before you bought the computer, by the Sound Blaster Live installation program, or by other software. Either delete the EMM386 program or remove the command that loads EMM386 from your CONFIG.SYS file. Note that you will lose the ability to run DOS audio with the Sound Blaster Live if you have one. But the BATTLEZONE II demo should now run. CGW It depends on the game. Some games can be played from one CD (often called \"spawning\").

Verox laughed at it. Apple made it a household word. Microsoft and IBM were Alate bloomers with it. The mouse is one of those pieces of hardware that made the PC rev. olution possible. The mouse has also long been a staple of PC gaming, and in the world of 3D shooters, mouse preference often slips into the realm of religious altercations and slap fights as to who's got the best gaming mouse out there. There have been incremental design improvements: more buttons, more comfortable shape, and most notably, the scrollwheel. But the fundamental \"guts\" of the mouse have remained unchanged for 20 years. Microsoft is looking to change all that with their new USB-based IntelliMouse Explorer. Gone are the ball and roller sensors that detected its move. ment, replaced by a LED sensor that takes 1,500 pictures\" a second to determine how the mouse is being moved. The result is that this mouse can operate on nearly any surface, except for transparent glass, without a mouse pad. This new design has yielded a well-heeled mouse that produces smooth movement. New to this mouse as well are two thumb buttons, which neighbor one another horizontally. In game testing, this button design proved to be uncomfortable, as it requires you to shift your hand position on the mouse to get at the front thumb button. An over/under design would have probably been the better way to go. During a spin through some QUAKE 3 deathmatches, the IntelliMouse proved itself an agile instrument, with quick response and an overall comfortable feel. Microsoft paid careful attention to add weight to the Intellimouse to compensate for the absence of the ball. In fact, the Intellimouse is about a half-ounce heavier than its predecessor. All told, the new IntelliMouse Explorer is a solid offering, though it is a bit pricey. There are other excellent USB-based ball-design mice out there for less money that get the job done. A less expensive version of the IntelliMouse Explorer, the IntelliMouse, will use the same design but with the LED guts, and will cost about $55. Dave Salvator ACTIONTEC USB NETWORKING KIT Price: $75 Manufacturer: Actiontec Contact: www.actiontec.com have a confession: I can't circle strafe. I must hang my head in shame at such an admission. I've played 3D shooters fairly regularly. but haven't been particularly good at it. So when the Dual Strike came along, I viewed it with some skepticism. Other attempts at 3D controllers have either had a steep learning curve or been spectacular failures. Not so the Dual Strike. If you can already rocket jump, circle-strafe, and fire on the fly with mouse and keyboard, stop reading, The Dual Strike is for * * * * the middling to-average action gamer (me), who plays often enough to be familiar with the game style, but not so much that they pick up on all of the \"pro\" nuances. The Dual Strike looks like a gamepad that's been broken in the middle and rejoined with a gimbal. The right side rotates about the gimbal in discrete axes (not freely). This is key, because it's much easier to get used to. For the best perfor. mance, you should turn on \"mouse-look\" in the game's controller setup. I was circle strafing in no time, something I never quite got the hang of with mouse and keyboard. The cool thing is the mode change that happens when you push the right half to the extremes of the gimbal (which you can feel in a sudden change of force required at the margins). The controller goes from mouse-look mode to fast-rotation mode in an instant, but you can still move the aiming cursor. It's much harder to describe than to do. The sensitivity of the turning and the move. ment (which comes from a D-pad-like control on the left half) is adjustable. Overall, the Dual Strike is one of the best attempts at a 3D game controller around. It won't make you a PGL champ, but you may, at least, finally be able to hold your head up. -Loyd Case Plug and Pray Networking have to hunt for the software driver, and that step is not documented. In fact, all you need do is to click a \"Next\" button, but the screen is likely to baffle many users. Once running, the installation software installed TCP/IP itself, but not IPX you'll have to do that through the Network Control Panel. Windows 98 self-configures IP addresses, so we were up and running pretty quickly. This kit performs a lot like a standard Ethernet. A 10MB file transferred in slightly over 17 seconds. Ping times of 9. 10ms were common. We played several network games, including STARFLEET COMMAND, HALFLIFE, and QUAKE II, and all performed nicely. Then we tried Q3TEST, which failed miserably. Whenever the second system would try to connect to the server, it would hang with repeating audio noise. This didn't happen when connected to normal fast Ethernet. Q3TEST is only a test, so you can't completely fault the networking kit; still, it was a bit worrisome. The real issue is that this kit is too expensive at $75. You can get fast Ethernet kits, complete with hubs, for $100. Still, the ActionTec kit might be an ideal solution for USB-equipped laptops. -Loyd Case ust plug it in and it works that's the promise of the Universal System Bus (USB). While this promise is made good with most USB devices these days, there are a few that have some problems. Take the ActionTec USB networking kit, for instance. My natural inclination when I popped open the kit was to plug in the single USB cable. This dual-headed cable is unique in that it has two male downstream connectors, so you can plug it * * * * * directly into the USB ports on the back of your PC or a USB hub. However, my eye caught a small slip of paper in the pack age that warned against this; it told me I had to install the software first. These folks must have taken a lesson from Thrustmaster.

At an average street price * * * * * of $185, Creative Labs' 3D Blaster TNT2 Ultra brings decent 32-bit graphics performance and very solid 16-bit perfor mance into a more affordable arena. According to Creative Labs, a lot of work went into ensuring compatibility with a wide variety of motherboards. The default clock rate as shipped is the standard 150/183. The card we tested came with 32MB of Ens (200MHz) SDRAM, and Creative's 2.04 driver release. Creative also supplies a perfor mance enhancement utility on the company's web site that allows you to adjust the core (TNT2 chip) clock and the memory clock up to a maximum of 166MHz core clock and 200MHz memory clock (166/200). The package includes a memory clock slider. We ran it successfully at the maximum 166/200MHz clock speed supported by Creative's utility without any problems on our 500MHz Pentium III test bed. Performance at the higher clock speed falls into the top third of all cards we tested. As you can see, it's faster than Voodoo3 3500 on 2D, though the 3dfx part is speedier on 3D. But to get the highest-clocked 3dfx part, you need to get the 3500, which also includes a TV tuner, and many other extras that gamers may not need. The limited software bundle includes Colorific color matching and 3Deep gamma correction utilities from Sonnetech and an MPEG (not MPEG-2 or DVD player. But the Reed USO t's the easiest networking I've HOICE ever installed. Period. I was skeptical about Entrega's 3-USB port plus Ethernet combo hub, especially after wrestling with their nearly nonfunctional serial/parallel port multifunctional hub. To be fair, I did have to connect it to a hub, and configure network settings, such as IP addresses and so on. But the physical con * * * ** nection was a piece of cake: Plug in the USB cable to a USB port on the PC, connect the small power brick, and slip the floppy with the drivers into the drive. The hub and Ethernet port are autodetected on boot-up. Several mouse clicks and one reboot later, the Ethernet port drivers are installed and a basic TCP/IP setup is live. You do have to con figure IP addresses if necessary, and add IPX protocols for games, but after wrestling with a number of different \"home networking\" setups, this was a cakewalk. The hub ships with drivers, small power pack and a USB upstream cable to connect to the PC. To connect to a second PC, you need either an Ethernet hub or a direct connect Ethernet cable (a.k.a. an Ethernet crossover cable, which has two wires swapped so that the hub isn't required). Note that it's more expensive than some Ethernet kits, but you do get a couple of additional USB ports in addition to networking. This is also different from USB networking kits that daisy-chain via USB ports. The Entrega's port looks like a stock, 10-Base-T Ethernet port to the network, and it played well in a mixed 10-megabit/100-megabit network. It moved a 10MB file across the network in under 17 seconds about par for 10Mbit/sec speeds and ping times with HALF-LIFE and TRIBES were well under 20 milliseconds. This is real Ethernet!

If you let them degrade too much, they'll break and require repair before you can use them again. This presents an interesting challenge, one that isn't found in traditional first-person shooters. If you plan on using a lot of weapons, you'll need a good maintenance skill to keep them in working order.

"GAMER'S EDGE Dungeon Keeper 2 MULTIPLAYER STRATEGIES STRAIGHT FROM THE BULLFROG'S MOUTH utside of the Marquis de Sade and Hannibal Lecter, no one knows dungeons better than the developers at Bullfrog who designed DUNGEON KEEPER 2. So we asked the homy devils themselves to let us in on their own strategies for keeping rival dungeon keepers at bay. Here's what they said. NICK RICKS' TIPS ANDY TROWERS' TIPS Fortify Imps Early on in the game, you will find that you do not have enough imps, but as the game progresses and your dungeon takes shape, your need for them will decline. Then, it is important to remember that just keeping imps alive will drain mana. Therefore, if you do have a large number of idle imps, get rid of them especially lower-level ones. When you take over areas of high strategic importance (such as Portals and gem blocks), ensure that you protect them heavily with traps. Always use at least one alarm trap so that you are notified immediately when the area is under threat; you can then provide backup if so required. Mana & Gold Mana is a recharging resource and can be converted into gold. In a long game with many creatures, you will quickly exhaust all of the gold around you, so it is vital that you manage your mana well. Mana intake is limited, as is the amount you can store; when you reach the upper limit, you are wasting a resource. Whenever your mana is maxed-out, it's a good idea to cast a Create Gold spell into your treasury. This will immediately add gold to your reserves, and your mana will soon reach its maximum again without your Nicholas Ricks having wasted any.

If money is of no concern, use the training room to build creatures' experience in the early stages. While the combat pit provides quicker advancement, it requires your attention to make sure that no creatures are dying. Using the training room frees you to do other things. Prisons and Enemy Low Level Creatures A portal will only attract 15 creatures into an enemy dungeon, and while your opponents creatures are alive, they will count to that tally. Therefore, keep the captured lower level creatures alive, especially fireflies and goblins. They will require minimal healing, but will ensure that your opponent's number of creatures remains capped. If you want your combatant units (like this dark knight) to stay interested and committed to a fight, drop them some chickens and gold. Rehabilitation When you have captured an enemy creature, decide whether they are more valuable to you converted or as skeletons. Although skeletons are relatively weak in battle, their fearless ness makes them handy as shock troops that won't run away when the battle goes against you.

Some good combinations include a Sentry trap behind a Freeze trap, a Lightning trap behind a Barricade (which in turn is next to water), and a Trigger trap surrounded by Inferno traps (mana allowing, of course). Combat Pit Combinations If you pair up the combatants in the Combat Pit carefully, they'll spend less time unconscious. Don't pit a Firefly against a Dark Angel...most cre tures are best off fighting others of the same kind. It may be worth buildir several separate Combat Pits so you can control who fights whom. Dropping and the Call to Arms Dropping your killer attack squad near the enemy is a good way to get concentrated force into the combat zone, but don't drop them too near enemy creatures, or they'll get clobbered while stunned. Drop them a bit ther away and use Call to Arms to lead them that's what it's for. Dropp Goblins before Bile Demons can tip the balance as well, since the Goblir get back on their feet quicker and can protect the slower risers.

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE by Gordon Berg SIMULATION & SPACE Spaced Out o my subscriber copy of the October CGW arrives in the mail, see. I walk into the house with extreme tunnel vision and trembling hands, staring at the wonder I hold before me. Kissing the cat on the lips and scratching my wife behind the ears, I proceed to the kitchen table, oh-so-eager to read my very-firstever printed article. Other than lamentAre Space Simsing over how my mugshot is noticeably absent (I think Jeff Green boycotted its Realistic? How inclusion because he was threatened by my stunning good looks). I'm pleased as Should I Know? punch with myself. I'm in the Big Leagues now. I've been published. And then I notice it. The actual name of my column. \"Simulation\" I expected, but \"Space?\" As in, the Final Frontier? As in, the vast gulf between my ears? Suddenly I'm not feeling so sure of myself. Although I have plenty of opinions about flight sims, I'm not what you lot of examples in real life to draw from (there's, well... none). We can only imagine what space combat might actually be like, and Star Wars has forever colored our interpretation. Ironically, Lucas was grognard@concentric.net inspired by WWII dogfighting when he created his famous trench run scene. Therefore, I find it interesting that while just about every space sim out there is emulating Star Wars in one fashion or another, they've largely failed to capture the crucial features that make WWII era dogfights so compelling. The key to all of this is the presence or absence of an atmosphere and I don't mean ambience. Most space sims have taken the best of both environments when crafting a flight model for their spacecraft. You get many of the properties of flight through air (lift, drag, etc.), combined with the benefits of space (e.g., no gravity). The result is flight without risk: just simple yank-and-bank on the joystick, without fear of stalls or spins. Frankly, I find that boring. When I played through the WING COMMANDER series, I stuck with it because of the story, not the combat. So far, FREESPACE has been the prettiest space shooter out there and a joy to look at, but it's not what I'd call a simulation (I can't comment on FREESPACE 2 because, at the time of this writing, I can't get the demo to work). TIE FIGHTER is my all-time favorite. I remember drooling over the prospect of one day being able to engage in multiplayer combat against an X-Wing, later to be hugely disappointed when it amounted to nothing more than cutting speed to 1/3 and turning in circles, ad nauseum. By the way, XVT: BALANCE OF POWER did a good turn by offering cooperative multiplayer. So why is it that there's only a skirmish mode in X-WING ALLIANCE? Heck, even the original DOOM got it right by including both deathmatch and coop modes, yet few games since have managed it. 00:00 INDEPENDENCE WAR DELUXE would call a space sim fanatic. I suppose I do enjoy a good romp through the universe as much as the next gamer, but you'll sooner find me spending my free time killing dragons in some RPG (coincidentally, fellow CGW columnist Desslock has admitted to me he prefers adding to the total annual tonnage of floating space debris). So, until I can convince the editors here that my column really needs to be entitled \"Gordon's Favorite Pre-Avionic Flight Sims & The RPGs He Plays in His Spare Time,\" someone around here has to talk space sims. Tag-I'm it. Not My Department So at this point I'm thinking maybe Thierry Nguyen's column should read \"Action & Space,\" because there's very little realism going on out where no one can hear you scream. Then I remembered which game CGW's Space Sim of the Year award went to last year: INDEPENDENCE WAR. Never having played this title, I swung by my local software store in the hopes of picking it up cheap. Lo and behold, INDEPENDENCE WAR DELUXE has been released and is extremely inexpensive. Now, I may only have just started the main campaign, but I can already tell IWAR is the best reason this side of RED BARON 3D to keep a 3Dfx card handy. It's official: I'm hooked, and have become a bonafide space sim fanatic. I mean, they've actually modeled lateral thrusters and inertia! It looks like the fate of Arulco or the exploration of Durlag's Tower will just have to wait. I've got a dreadnaught to pilot.

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE ACTION by Thierry Nguyen License Revoked thierry_nguyen@zd.com The Horror, the Horror... o doubt, The Matrix has all the elements of a great action game: intriguing premise, lots of guns, unique visuals, and gunplay scenes straight out of a John Woo flick. Too bad it'd probably become a horrible game, if it were adapted. It's a sad fact that licenses of creative properties are gravely misused when they are turned into games. For every Creative JEDI KNIGHT or ALIENS VS. License Should PREDATOR, there are many more YODA Be... Creative STORIES or SOUTH PARKS. In fact, good games using creative properties are the exception, rather than the rule. Why is this? It seems that companies expect the license to sell the game, and they focus more on promoting the title than on such trivial things as, oh, game design. Marketing, rather than Development, is in charge of the project. This is the only plausible reason why complete dreck such as TEKWAR ON TRESPASSER got into stores in the first place. Gamers sometimes get suckered at first, but then a title ends up dropping off the chart after word-of-mouth has spread. What companies need to do is to learn how to use a creative license as more than a name-brand gimmick. And the way to do this Scooter's Playlist is simply stated: Explore 1. System Shock 2 rather than rehash the 2. Soul Caliber (DreamCast) license. 3. Gabriel Knight III (beta) It sounds exciting to 4. Battlezone 5. Quake III Arena Test recreate entire scenes or films in a game, in theory. But the reality is that such games are never very fun. We already know what happens, so it isn't fresh. What good games do is use elements of the license to explore concepts unseen in the original properties. Bethesda's TERMINATOR games let us tour the apocalyptic Los Angeles that was hinted at in the films. JEDI KNIGHT presented classic, archetypal themes with the Star Wars universe as a backdrop. The world was briefly seen from the Alien's eyes in Alien3, and that perspective constituted a full third of ALIENS VS. PREDATOR. By contrast, STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE was a dull play-by-play of the film with barely a hint of variation. This lack of variation, of creativity, is the kiss of death. It's conservative; it sticks to \"what people know.\" There're some that do try to explore the license, but then lose sight of fundamental design issues, like SOUTH PARK. A few just screw up everything (TRESPASSER). Hopefully, companies will start to learn to balance solid design with creative use of a license (as in JEDI KNIGHT still the standard, two years after release), rather than to be sorely lacking in one or both elements. We'll see if anyone learned these basics when the next wave of licensed action games including the Star Trek games, OBI-WAN, and HEAVY METAL: F.A.K.K.2 hits over the next year. CGW Two games have really stood out in action gamers' minds in recent memory: SYSTEM SHOCK 2 and HALF-LIFE. A lot of the reason why is their atmospheres. I asked the respective designers what non-gaming influences went into the overall atmosphere and mood of their games, and here are their responses: Marc Laidlaw, Designer and Story-Writer for HALF-LIFE: \"Alien comes up frequently in our discussions of how to cre ate frightening atmosphere without the trappings of Gothic horror. Early literary influences included Stephen King's The Mist (a horror story with a somewhat \"technological\" rationale for the horrors) and the work of H.P. Lovecraft, who wrapped his best horror stores in the scientific method. When it came time to [design the alien vistas of Xen, we tried to avoid standard science fiction imagery as much as possible, and drew our textures largely from biological sources (insects, marine life, microorganisms) to create a queasy, squamous environment.\" Ken Levine, Lead Designer of SYSTEM SHOCK 2: \"Ridley Scott's films are far more influential than James Cameron's. Scott directed both Blade Runner and Alien, which pioneered the look of cinematic, dark sci-fi. For storyline, Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars was a strong influence.

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE SPORTS by George Jones This Magic Moment george_jones@zd.com The same holds true for baseball. The great baseball title has to do all the little things right; a baseball game has plenty of dramatic moments built into it already. Designers have to pay attention to the pitcherbatter confrontation/guessing game, the odds playing in the dugout, various pitchers' ability (or inability) to get the ball over the plate, and the almighty change-up one of the most psychologically devastating plays in sports. No surprise that HIGH HEAT 2000 one of CGW's favorite games this year -surpasses expectations in all of these categories, much as the original Nintendo RBI BASEBALL did. Which brings us to basketball. Even though NBA LIVE and Microsoft's INSIDE UPDATE UPDATE CGW's HIGH HEAT Baseball League! Little Things TORRYTECH omen's tennis is far more entertaining to watch than the men's game, for one critical reason: It has more drama. More meaningful big moments created by lots of little elements...longer, nailbiting baseline rallies; shorter matches that create more tension, more quickly. It makes for a much more exciting experience than the men's three-hour long, threehit rally matches. This fact which dawned on me when I was in Mean A Lot in Europe, starving for baseball or the Sports football got me thinking about Game Game PC sports games, and how drama and the ability to crystallize and emotionally convey big moments through little details define success in our arena as well, far more so than killer 3D graphics. Realizing this, I now feel I have resolved two mysteries I've been grappling with for some time now: 1. Why do people who can't stand the thought of watching a two-and-ahalf-hour soccer, hockey, or baseball game play FIFA or HIGH HEAT (or TRIPLE PLAY) for hours at a time? 2. Why do five-on-five computer basketball games (still) suck? The easy answer to both questions rests in the details. Baseball, soccer, hockey, and even football games are great, not because of killer graphics or how fast the gameplay speeds by. The top-tier games in these categories succeed because the designGeorge's Playlist ers found a way to break down and dis1. High Heat 2000 till the fundamental 2. Age of Empires 2 3. Madden 2000 elements that com4. NFL Fever 2000 prise the essence of 5. Quake III the sport. Consider soccer, a sport that resembles most relationships between men: couch potato-dompunctuated by intense moments of excitement -followed by couch potato-dom. Yet EA Sports' FIFA is absolutely intense, because they have successfully abstracted the finer details of what makes soccer entertaining quick passing, fluid motion, a lack of selfishness, and the emotional damage resulting from a single score. EAT IT HIGH HEAT's devastasting changeup is one of those sublime elements that makes the game great. ON THE OTHER HAND... Basketball games still focus on supposedly \"big\" moments like dunks, while ignoring smaller fundamentals. DRIVE are fine games, they lack the drama even a five-on-five, pickup park-and-rec game provides. Why? Because thus far, no one has done an extraordinary job of bottling the essence of roundball. It's not the dunk. Dunks make the highlight reels, but they're more of an exclamation point than sustained drama. The drama comes from the emotional tug-of-war within the game; when the Bulls, Lakers, or even Warriors bring the ball slowly down the court, trailing by three points, and hit a crucial three-pointer to tie the game after swinging the ball around the perimeter several times. Hoops drama comes at the end of a game, when the other team picks up their efforts and starts playing hyperaggressive defense. Or when they start fouling intentionally to send the other team to the line. It comes when one of your teammates blows two free throws at the end of the game. It doesn't come when you shoot free throws with a glorified swing meter, and it sure doesn't come when a game plays more like JOUST than basketball. CGW The season trading I deadline has come and gone with no last minute deals though Robert Coffey did manage to con Jesse Hiatt's Texas Rangers out of starter Curt Schilling for Greg Vaughn and Andy Ashby a few weeks earlier. Complaints were registered, but Robert, being the commissioner, ignored them. The real player movement occurred behind the scenes, with new ownership taking over for every team in the West. The most notable addition has undoubtedly been Copy Editor Holly Fleming the only player in the league without a Y chromosome. Caterwauling like a rabid lemur, Holly's animated playing style consistently threatens to topple computers and destroy gamepads as she leaps, lunges, and prances about the room in her efforts to manage just one hit. With an inadvertent walk the only flaw in an otherwise per. fect game for Steve Wanczyk's Orioles against Holly's Oakland A's, Holly figures to be a real (some would say disturbingly) wild card as the pennant races heat up. Keep up the good work, Holly. 220 DECEMBER 1999  cgw.gamespot.com  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD "

"INSIDE GAMING INSIDE by Desslock RPG / ADVENTURE Roll Call Dungeon Keepers desslock@desslock.com he company founded to create Dungeons & Dragons, TSR Inc., was rumored to be in financial turmoil a few years ago. Tabletop D&D's popularity was waning, and SSI's once successful series of D&D computer adaptations was winding down to a not-so-glamorous finale Wizards of the Coast was the corporate \"white knight\" that acquired and revitalized TSR ironic, conCan D&D sidering that the overwhelming success of WOTC's Magic the Gathering card game contributed to TSR's Survive Hasbro? financial misfortunes. Many gamers were skeptical of WOTC's chances of restoring D&D to prominence, especially given the company's focus on competing products. Those concerns turned out to be unfounded WOTC has done a fantastic job with the D&D franchise. nterplay Productions recently unveiled its BALDUR'S GATE spin-off, ICEWIND DALE. ICEWIND will recycle the BioWare Infinity engine created for BALDUR'S GATE (adding enhancements, including limited support for 3D video cards), and is essentially a single/multiplayer dungeon crawl in a hardcore D&D setting. Interplay's other Infinity engine game, PLANESCAPE: TORMENT, is a single-player, more story-driven game that'll explore some truly bizarre environments. BioWare's NEVERWINTER NIGHTS will use a new 3D engine and put players in control of a single character, while emphasizing online multiplayer action. Lastly, Stormfront Studios's sequel to the original \"gold box» game, POOL OF RADIANCE, looks similar to BALDUR'S GATE but features an interactive environment and 3D characters (see preview in this issue). NEVERWINTER NIGHTS and POOL OF RADIANCE 2 will use the upcoming 3rd Edition D&D Rules. One Man's Filth... Prior to WOTC's acquisition, D&D was reshaped against the desires of its customers into a less controversial (and less interesting) game. Ill-conceived concerns over the effects of fantasy role playing on presumably malleable teenage players led TSR to adopt a rigid \"code of ethics\" for all D&D products. Authors were required to compromise their creativity by, for example, requiring evil actions to be pun. ished, even when they were consistent with a character's moral alignment. The code, and changes effected by D&D's 2nd Desslock's Playlist Edition Rules, removed character classes and 1. System Shock 2 (still) races of ambiguous morality, downplayed the role 2. Independence War Deluxe of mythological supernatural beings (in spite of 3. Starfleet Command the game's fantasy setting), and discouraged 4. EverQuest material considered by the code's authors to be 5. Asheron's Call (beta) potentially harmful. The code was cynically established to stave off potential legal liability. So blatant was TSR's effort to detach itself from aspects of D&D perceived to be controversial, that it added save-yer-butt ambiguous declarations to the code, such as \"the depiction of 'filth' should be minimized.\" With such restrictions inhibiting creativity, it's not surprising that D&D's commercial viability began to be questioned. While other tabletop games such as White Wolf's Vampire and Werewolf games attracted players in droves to their novel, edgy settings, D&D felt outdated in comparison. After TSR's sale to WOTC, D&D seemed to get back in it. BALDUR'S GATE was a tremendous commercial and critical success, perhaps in part due to WOTC's more open-minded involvement with the franchise, and there are a number of other promising D&D games in development. WOTC has also been actively involved in improving D&D, recently announcing that next year it will release D&D's 3rd Edition Rules. The 3rd Edition Rules have been almost universally lauded, as they remove discriminatory class restrictions; restore demons, devils, assassins, monks and half-orcs; and establish a new skill system. When I learned about the pending acquisition of WOTC by Hasbro Interactive, I was disappointed-what impact would the change of control have on the enlightened D&D fostered by WOTC? SSI's POOL OF RADIANCE 2 Toying Around Once Interplay's and Stormfront's D&D licenses expire, it wouldn't be surprising if Hasbro developed its own D&D games. Whether a company with a lineup consisting largely of board and arcade game adaptations and children's games is capable of creating compelling D&D games is questionable. My concerns are somewhat assuaged by WOTC Vice-President Ryan Dancey, who announced that Hasbro would not alter WOTC's D&D strate. gies, and that they accept the more adult aspects of D&D's language, tone, and content. And on the plus side, D&D will now have access to Hasbro's formidable distribution and advertising. In spite of Dancey's stay-the-course message, it would be naïve to believe that Hasbro's acquisition won't have any impact on D&D's future, and I remain skeptical that the impact will be positive. But it's good to learn that in the short run the course plotted by WOTC will remain unchanged. And the demons and devils are coming back!

"GREENSPEAK by Jeff Green Insert Your Face Here So You Wanna Be A Game Journalist? Join My School! sa mildly respected member of this field, the one question I'm asked the most (other than \"what's that thing on your nose?\") is, \"How can I get your job?\" Believe me, folks-it isn't easy. To reach this pinnacle, to ascend this dizzying mountaintop, entails a commitment for which few have the stamina. Like all the tough professions-medicine, law enforcement, terrorism-game jour. nalism requires you to give yourself over to something more than just a job, a paycheck. It is a way of life. Those of us who have chosen to walk this difficult road have sacrificed much. A decent salary, for example. A healthy complexion. The respect of people over age 12 Yet we walk on. tions flak (or \"stooge.\") On the one hand, the PR flak will annoy you endlessly on the phone, demanding covers for games like REGIS PHILBIN 2D SOLITAIRE. On the other hand, the flak can prove an invaluable tool for gaining last-minute access to screen shots, spec sheets, and other pertinent info that you forgot to get on your own because you were too busy playing QUAKE 3 all week. Game Review Workshop: Channeling Your Bitter Jealousy Prerequisites: Lifelong hatred of those with more talent and money than you. Lack of tangible accomplishments accompanied by need to criticize the hard work of others. It's well known that game designers and programmers make lots more money than game journalists. For example, most can actually afford to eat everyday. Just because they have more talent and money, though, is no reason to sulk. In this course we'll teach you how to channel years of resentment into revenge-exacting game reviews. Yes, in one evening's bit of work you can undo three years worth of a talented person's effort. Even better, you can do it without actually playing past the first 10 minutes of a game, or knowing how to fairly critique a product. Specific techniques such as false assumptions, unrealistic expectations, and unfair comparisons will be discussed. Some of you the few, the proud-may still not be discouraged by this. To you I say \"bravo!\" To you I say, well, you just might be crazy enough, brave enough, to be one of us. Which brings me to my point. While deep in meditation one recent Saturday morningduring the break between Batman Beyond and Pokemon-it struck me that while tomorrow's young leaders have more than ample access to medical schools, law schools, and terrorist Web sites, there is a rather appalling void in our education system for the aspiring gaming journalist. Having recognized this void, I've decided to \"share the wealth,\" as it were, to spread my knowledge and skills through the formation of the Greenspeak School Of Gaming Journalism. This fully accredited correspondence course will teach you, through a series of low-cost tapes and videos-narrated by entertainment legend Joe Piscopo-all you need to know to launch a career in this glamorous profession. Soon you too can be playing games at home while earning, literally, hundreds of dollars a year. Here's but a small sample of the courses I'll be offering: Stress Management Workshop The greatest misconception of our profession is that it's easy. In this course we discuss the often backbreaking pressures of this job, and how best to cope with them. Through proven psychological methods such as whining, psychopuppetry, and group hugs, each session will help you come to Soon you too can be playing games at home while earning, literally, hundreds of dollars a year. 1 Introduction To Preview Writing: Honing Your Cliches Prerequisites: Proven willingness to step up and take it to the next level. This intensive writing workshop will train you in the fundamentals of writing game previews. Critical to the course will be learning how to sprinkle copy with such essential phrases as \"gorgeous 3D graphics,\" \"the next generation of insert genre here) games,\" and that catch-all closer, \"we can't wait to play it.\" Rewriting press releases will also be discussed, as will the best techniques for interviewing game designers without asking any real questions. terms with different problems. In the first week, we'll deal with these topics: How Come Everyone Got An AGE II Beta But Me?, Lunch Crisis: Taco Bell or Burger King?, and Why Can't I Get A Chick Like Lara? Tissues recommended. The PR Flak: Friend, Or Spawn Of Satan? In this reflective 10-part series of seminars, we will examine the complex, sometimes difficult relationship between the gaming journalist and the game company public-rela Sounds great, huh? Amazingly, this is but a taste of what my school has to offer. About the only think you won't get here is a Pulitzer Prize--you'll have to earn that yourself! So what are you waiting for? Send me your money now and see you in class! What Jeff doesn't realize is that the authorities were alerted to this scam weeks ago, and should be closing in any minute.
