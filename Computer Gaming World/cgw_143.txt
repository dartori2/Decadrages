"WHY IS DUKE NUKEM 3D THE BEST? Even Even running in super crisp 800x600 SVGA it blasts along faster than every other comparable 3D PC title. It's not pure speed at the expense of versatility either it is possible to look up, down, or sideways at any time, with the bitmapped scenery undergoing minimal deformation and no speed loss whatsoever. The engine also caters for full interaction, so bullets leave pock marks on walls, enemy's blood drips down crates and earthquakes cause huge sections to shift altogether, thereby granting access to new locations. It all contributes to the feeling of being encased within a grim world as opposed to wandering through impregnable, static corridors. The effect is hugely rewarding and is surely the direction in which such games should be heading. Computer Play SD 4A perfect 10!\" Out of 5 stars\" PC Entertainm ** This potential has luckily been exploited too. So often games fail to capitalize on excellent technologies but each of Duke Nukem's levels are noticeably different, being packed with huge ramps, drops, lifts, jumps and cunningly hidden secret areas. None look the same (indeed there is often a significant variation within a single building) and there is always a feeling that there is a new trick round the next corner. -Edge Magazine \"In terms of graphics, gameplay and overall go more strategy and variety than DOOM.

In other words, he found new and diabolical ways to break audio and video hardware (AVH) and helped Ziff magazines inform the consumer (YOU). Dave reviews hardware and emerging technologies (HET) and evaluates new support technologies (NSTs) such as Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs) and powerful new chips (BFCs) that make games more compelling. In addition to being the king of three letter acronym (TLAS) speech, Dave has been an avid musician for 20 years, playing the saxophone (SAX) and keyboards (PNO), and plays out regularly on Jazz and R&B (RNB) gigs.

Action/Arcade (AC): The emphasis is on hand-eye coordination and reflexes, usually emphasizing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure (AD): Games wherein you control an alter ego and move through a story line or sequence of events, where puzzle-solving takes precedence over conversation and combat. Classics/Puzzles (CP): Classics are old stand-bys and parlor games that appeal to many different types of gamer. Examples include: backgammon, bridge, chess, MONOPOLY, parchesi, Risk, and SOLITAIRE. Puzzle games are computer games which emphasize spa tial relationships, word games and/or problem-solving without requiring gamers to follow a storyline. Examples would be: SHANGHAI, Tetris and ZIG-ZAG. Role-Playing (RP): RPGS are a subset of adventure games, but stress character development, often through improving stats or other attributes. Conversations with non. player characters (NPCs) and tactical combat are generally more important than in Adventure games. Finally, the game world tends to be large, and the plot less linear, often with some quests/treks outside the main storyline. Simulations (SI): Highly realistic games from a first-person perspective: you may drive a realistically simulated race car, fly a military aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed scifi environment. Usually poly. gon-filled technology is used to build the simulated world on the fly. Sports (SP): The sports game category is a broad genre which includes action (NBA Live) and strategy games (FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO) based on sports. Strategy (ST): Problem solving, short and long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X-COM, OUTPOST, MOO), as well as \"pure\" strategy games and \"software toys\" such as SIMCITY. Wargames (WG): A subset of strategy games, these recre. ate historical conflicts from a command perspective. They may be tactical, operational, or strategic, and stress anything from logistics and firepower to morale and leadership. They may be simple (PANZER GENERAL, EMPIRE II) to incredibly detailed and complex (PACIFIC WAR). THEY SEND YOU HOW DO WE RATE? ** YOU'RE NOT ALONE Your mission is to unravel the mystery behind the Majestic's star-crossed voyage.

"JOHNNY WILSON edito i The Source Of Frustration n Why You Can't Always Find The Game You Want ver wonder why your local retailer carries some games, but not others? Ever won der what criteria are used to decide what games reach store shelves? Ever feel like there is a mad conspiracy at large to keep you from finding the game you want? Well, you aren't the only one. We sometimes ask the same questions. Better yet, since our van tage point gives us a few answers, we thought we'd try to demystify some of the voodoo. First, retailers only want to han. dle a game for two reasons: 1) it makes good marketing sense or 2) they are subsidized enough that it makes its own kind of marketing sense. Under the first rationale, retailers talk in terms of margin and turns. Margin is their percentage profit comparing the price the game costs them versus the price they will sell it and correlating this profit to the amount of square feet of shelf space they commit to the product. Turns are the number of sales they will get on each bit of shelf space. The term is short for turnover. Obviously, a higher num. (C Many stores don't carry products from companies that won't buy space in their catalogs or pay for promotional programs. 3-D And More3-) he dynamic world of computer gaming is on the verge of a 3-D revo'lution unprecedented in the history of the hobby. The 3-D revolution shouldn't be confused with what are presently considered 3-D games\" like Doom II and DUKE NUKEM 3D, where the player navigates in a first-person environment, seeing through the \"eyes\" of his on-screen persona. Rather, this 3-D revolution entails new software that renders characters as true 3-D objects, not just flat, texture-mapped characters common in presentday titles, and these 3-D games are not limited to the first-person perspective of conventional \"3-D\" games (confused yet?). The 3-D revolution also applies to hardware, particularly graphic accelerators, which help crunch all the data to paint those 3-D rendered objects quickly on a home computer This month's cover story is but a glimpse into the stunning, atmospheric 3-D games in development. Of course, we'll cover more of the titles as soon as we can see and play them. But the software is only half of the story. As computer gamers, you are probably accustomed to the endless onslaught of technology advances which often necessitate upgrades. And upgrades are exactly what will be in store for you if you don't have a fire-breathing Pentium 150 and you want to play these compelling new games. That's why we're working on a major feature for next month that examines the technology and explains the issues involved. We'll look at the first wave of graphic accelerators and accelerator chips which are, in most cases, making their way to market now. So if you've been confused by all the talk about \"500,000 goraud-shaded, z-buffered, bit mapped, tri-linear filtered polygons per second,\" and you're waiting to see somebody seriously examine what 3-D hardware will do, and who's making the best stuff for your purposes, be sure to tune in next month for an enlightening article and some real world answers. building special shelves; 2) charges for special signs or shelf lineage; 3) rates for cooperative advertising (both in the retail chain's own catalogs and in coop newspaper adver. tisements); 4) promotional charges for end caps (the displays at the ends of the shelves) and POPS (Point of Purchase displays--those special boxes and signs near the cash register), and more. As a consumer, you need to realize that many retail stores will not carry products that are not advertised in their catalogs or are not part of a promotional program from which the stores glean extra money. The decision to carry or not to carry a product in a given store may have nothing to do with the quality of the product. Second, individual store man. agers in a retail chain rarely get to make their own decisions. Corporate buyers who, at best, may see a demo of the flash and sizzle of a game at a trade show and, at worst, make their decision over a sales sheet and an MDF contract, decide which titles they'll carry, and managers pretty well have to stick to that approved list. This makes it ber of turns equals a higher rate of profit and success. In most cases, the profit margin on computer games is insufficient to justify shelf space under ratio nale #1. so the retailer accepts the product under rationale #2. Rationale #2 is called MDF, which stands for Marketing Development Funds. These are the fees that computer game publishers pay to retailers in the form of: 1) costs of CG JUNE 1996 "

"JOHNNY WILSON ZIFF-DAVIS PUBLISHING GROUP CHAIRMAN AND CEO Eric Hippeau CONSUMER MEDIA GROUP President J. Scoli Briggs Vice President J.

Malcolm Morris Vice President, Human Resources Rayna Brown Vice President, Planning Darryl Olte Vice President, Production Roger Herrmann Vice President, Controller Mark Mayer Treasurer Thomas L. Wright tough for great titles from new com. panies to get consideration. Third, it is now a fad in the retail chains to stock games in slimmer quantities. This means that if the stores expect a game to sell 10 units per month, they're only ordering five units at a time and counting on the reorder in two weeks. On a hot-selling game, this may mean that they sell out on the first weekend and the shelf sits empty for 10 days before the reorder gets there. The retailers have been burned by heavy returns from a few bad games and they don't want the inventory clogging up their channel. So, they're stocking lighter. Low inventories in the stores means that there is less likelihood of heavy returns and protects the industry against another crash like that in the mid-'80s. The bad news is that each title may not sell as many units as possible before the retailer uses that space for something else, even if it is selling out. More importantly for you, you may not get to buy that game as soon as you wanted to. You might even miss it all together. Another factor of bad news is that most distributors pay (when they pay) on a net 90 basis (i.e. they have 90 days to pay after accepting delivery, ostensibly to cover their returns liabil ity). How many distributors do you think pay before that 90 days are up? None. So, if retailers are ordering smaller quantities and waiting to reorder, what do you suppose is hap. pening to orders from distributors? Right, they're getting smaller. So, what happens to the publisher who is waiting to get revenue to pay for the development of that product? He's stuck. The smaller orders mean that it takes longer to recoup the develop ment budget. Where once the distrib. utor would order large quantities of product and be liable net 90, now they order small quantities and Teorder as needed. New game devel. opment is often the victim. Fourth, there is a new marketing procedure called Single Source Marketing. In the computer game business, it began with GT Interactive. This company, best known for putting together the marketing and distribu tion deal for id's DOOM \"shareware at retail\" packages, put together a deal to go into Walmart. This was the holy grail for most of the industry. If they could get into Walmart, they would be mass market at last. The catch was that Walmart didn't want to have to deal with the sales reps of a lot of different distributors or compa nies. They wanted one source for everything. GT stepped into that void and opened up Walmart as an extensive source of revenue. Of course, everyone in Walmart has to allow GT to take a piece of the action for being that single source. Then, Electronic Arts made the same kind of deal with Toys.R-Us. If any computer game publisher wants to be in Toys R Us, they have to allow EA to take a piece of the action for being that source. Well, that's extra money for what ever company gets to be the single source serving these large chains, but it also means that publishers have to fund their competitors or get out of certain markets. If you can't find your favorite games from a given publisher in a retail store, it may be because the publisher of those games doesn't want to enter into a distribution deal with that source. Why can't you find the games you want in a given store? There are lots of reasons from basic marketing through lazy corporate buyers. What can you do about it? Voice your feelings. Let your local store know that you're frustrated with the selection. Ask them which one of the four problems listed above is the one keeping them from having the game in stock. The bottom line is that informed cus tomers can change things. You can help retailers stock better games.

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH WING SCAM-PANDER Regarding Martin Cirulis column in the February issue, thank you on behalf of us all for asking where the documentation went. T've been increasingly annoyed at this latest scam where the game publishers want to charge us $60 for a game, and then get an extra $20 for tlic information we need to play it. A big sinner you didn't mention: Origin and WING COMMANDER IV. They spent millions on this game, but only gave us minimal information on the ships and weapons. The manual tells you to check the README.TXT file. The README.TXT doesn't contain any information at all about ships or weapons. Checking Origins web site, I found some minimal information on fighters, but none of the other data. When I e-mailed them, they said they were working on it, and it would be posted soon. The game was already out, and the strategy guide was already in print. Obviously, they already had this data, so why clicn't they give it to us? This type of tactic is really nothing less than the gouging of the consumer, and I hope Origin and the others were reading your column. Bravo.

True enough, but how realistic is it that these very strippers continue their dance whilst you shoot it out with a bunch of alien monsters. Be that as it may, my beef is with your response to Lane's letter. You are trying to justify something that is truly inexcusable in order, I have to assume, to make your point about the exciting game play of DN3D. Even somebody with a very distorted set of values would at least have to admit that the inclusion of the stripper element is of very questionable taste. Sven Nebelung New York, NY can't help. I play these games and enjoy them. I have cohed and aahed at demons flying apart from a wellplaced rocket, but then again, as Lane pointed out, demons are fairytales. I don't want to see a Jessie Helis type approach to these games, but I think that there has to be some self-imposed limits to violence in general. Good taste (if any can be claimed by a shoot-em-up) should be used. Violence has a place, but it should not be as extreme as Duke. Patrick Dugan Charlotte, NC WHERE IS THE NOTABLE QUOTES SECTION? I'm (unfortunately) cancelling my subscription renewal because I hate the new format. Greg Brookfield, CT The Publisher asked us to wait until you were gone before putting your quote in. I just read the message from \"Lane Denson, MTSU\" in the April issue. Was that an April fools joke? How did this loser discover that shooting the strippers in DUKE NUKEM 3D kills them? Imm? I expected some whining to come from right-wing moralists, but the disdain he shows for parents and parental responsibility as guardians of their children is typical knce-jerk big government liberalism at its best. What would make him happy? A DUKE NUKEM 3D decency law banning this licentious work? Every company should do as 3D Realms has and allow parental control over content, simply because it's good business. That doesn't mean that they should stop producing PCincorrect games. The answer in this information age is not censorship, but personal and parental choice and control. Gary Bringhurst via the Intemet NOTABLE QUOTES Okay, if you're tired of hearing about the Duke debate, here's a smattering of redom ramblings from our mailbug, Where was Steel Panthers when I was single? Todd. Fort Wayne, IN The people at Orgin (sic) are damn fools to think they'd profit off WC5 after launching stuff in space. Quinn Henning Orlando, FL I think you are correct in saying that game play is why DUKE NUKEM 3D is such a great game. I have to bring up a point, though. For most people, the scenes depicted in DUKE NUKEM 3D are just images in a game. There are two groups that come to mind where these images are more than that, Children and the Mentally unstable. Children do not understand that the images of sex & violence that you see on TV or computer games are not real. I have a 12 year old step daughter and I preview any material she uses on the computer, but I think that most people don't take the time to see what their children's games involve. I have seen many kids in the arcade finish playing MORTAL KOMBAT 3 and then, proceed to karate chop cach other into picces. These kids don't understand that these are games. The rising vioIence level in kids is definitely due to the amount of violence that they are exposed to on a daily basis. The other side is the people who skirt the fringe of society. Now, these people would probably strike without any external influences, but these images You're damn right! They would be if they thought that, but you better go back and take another look at that reference to \"The Fool\" at the end of the April news story. Don't feel badh, you're not the only one who was snookered. Good luck getting that egg off, though. Whatever happened to \"Once Upon A Time\" (the page in CGW that showed 5and 10-year old games)? Ben Esdcove Wimberley, TX We dumped it five or ten years ago. FIRING LINE AND IN THIS CORNER ... While I agree with your response to Lane Denson's letter in CCW 141, concerning the very impressive game play of DUKE NUKEM 3D, am afraid that this assessment might have clouded your judgment about the issue with the strippers... With the inclusion of the strippers, that can be shot and killed, the game has undeniably crossed the line from senseless to nasty violence. You argue that the game wouldn't Computer games and software were always a point of interest for me. But until Computer Gaming Monthly came along, I haven't been able to get into it very much.

Europe's major exhibi tion for \"leisure soft ware,\" insiders were treated to a preview of '96 and beyond. As in the U.S., the watchword was 3-D, but vive I'differance! Europe's commitYet, this is not where the 3-D becomes impressive. The 3-D becomes impressive in games like Psygnosis' ECSTATICA 2.The characters are much more detailed than in its cult favorite predecessor, and the terrain fea tures have enough depth that you can look over cliff edges and castle sides, as well as fall down wells and out win dows. Despite this enhance ment, the game plays faster than ever and fea. tures moves common to the best fighting games (dodging side-rolls, back flips, forward rolls, kicks, slash es, and special moves). Mindscape's DARK EARTH (see cover story) also features impressive fighting sequences Add Psygnosis' ATHANOR to the stew and you have exciting potential. ATHANOR requires you to learn 15 different styles of fighting in a game where every frame is high-res 3-D, shadows are important clues, and the stereo sound provides important cues. Other 3-D adventures will include Philips Media's DOWN IN THE DUMPS, a wild little adventure about characters who live in a literal dump; as well as Viacom's Joe's APARTMENT, a roach-infested adventure based on the MTV series (this one's being developed in the U.S.) and AEON FLUX, based on the dark, animated heroine of MTV fame. Viacom is also developing Snow CRASH, a mission-based action adventure created around the cyberpunk novel by Neal Stephenson. Psygnosis' ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU uses amazing technology to bring to life the island from the H. G. Wells novel, while the company's CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a marvelous implementation of the acclaimed French film by Marc Cato. Psygnosis is also develop ing DiscWORLD 3-D, a '97 project which manages to continue the artistic feel of the earlier DISCWORLD and the new animated DiscWORLD 2 scheduled for this year. In the action realm, 3.D games run the gamut from Activision's BLAST CHAMBER TO Philips' Q.A.D. (QUINTESSENTIAL ART OF DESTRUCTION). The former is a fresh multiplayer concept where four competitors have time bombs strapped to them. They move throughout a 3.D environment (which can, in turn, be moved) and chase crystals which can either elongate the amount of time on their timer or attenuate the amount of time on their opponents' timers. The latter is a flying shoot-'em-up with a very «3-D STUDIO\" look. Add Team 47 GoMan and GOTHIQUE to the ros.

In Europe, developers are work. ing on authentic 3-D solutions that combine high-res textures and fast performance. Here are some of the highlights of what we saw in and around ECTS, and what you can expect to see at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in the U.S. Europe has its share of rela tively slow, but showy, 3-D titles. SHADOWS OVER RIVA (the third REALMS OF ARKANIA RPG to be published in the U.S. by SirTech) opens with a traditional, albeit sometimes gross, 3-D animation and LORDS OF THE REALM II (a medieval strategy game from Sierra's Impressions subsidiary) opens with a very fluid scene-setting animation. ON THE SHELF PSYCHIC DETECTIVE After enduring an eternity of multi media hype masquerading as games, we finally have an interactive film that-no offense to the excellent WING COMMANDER IV-isn't based on an action game. The plot of this sci-fi detective mystery is carried on in real-time, and regardless of where you are in the game world, the other (non-play er) char acters get on with their fictional lives-making your quest for clues that much more challenging. The concept is fresh and mature, the acting surprisingly good, and the writing very strong indeed. There is a certain degree of frustra. tion, as you are likely to fail often before finalTy winning the game. After you get hooked, however, you find that there's much more to replay than just finding the 14 different endings. Experienced gamers may only get 25 or so hours of gameplay out of PSYCHIC DETECTIVE, but they'll find that it's a wild mindread, indeed.-A.

X-Com: UFO Defense (MicroProse) N w n our very visual world, it's easy to forget that we do a lot of \"seeing\" with our ears, using sounds to determine both location and direction of things we can't see, or see only peripherally. Studies at MIT's Media Lab compared user's perceptions of a baseline program and a second program with identical graphics, but better sound. When asked what was different, the users said the graphics looked better. Sound can add tremendously to gaming, and using sound cues to locate objects in an environment can add a good bit more. To that end, Microsoft announced its Direct3D Sound API (Application Programming Interface) at the Computer Game Developers' conference. This newest member of the DirectX API family integrates tightly with DirectSound, allowing developers to assign positional information to sound events in a game. Direct3D Sound then applies filters to those sounds to make them appear to come from some other place than the speakers. Microsoft's goal with Direct3D is consistent 3-D audio effects, so that regardless of your audio hardware, the API will use your sound card's Digital Signal Processor if it has one, or use the CPU if it doesn't (check out our sound card feature in this issue). Version 1.0 of the API will be available to software developers in August, and titles using it should come out later this year.-Dave Salvator N Now ia ZORK NEMESIS In case you were wondering what's been happening lately in the land of Frobozz, things aren't going too well. Apparently some entity called Nemesis has brought a curse down upon the Forbidden Lands. It's your job to go and see what he's up to, and while you're at it, locate four missing VIPS. Unfortunately this new chapter in the ZORK saga plays more like a sequel to Myst. You wander around beautifully rendered 3-D environments, solving puzzles and piecing together the wellCrafted plot, which is based on the science of alchemy. But connections to previous ZORK games are peripheral; noticeably absent is the wicked sense of humor that elevated those games to something more than just another dun. geon hack By itself, ZORK NEMESIS is an artistic achieve. ment, and a challenging puzzle adventure for anyone who enjoys that sort of thing.

"READ.ME NASA Likes The Feel Of A ThrustMaster o ThrustMaster's $500 F-16 FLCS Special Edition was a little to cheap for your tastes. You want quality and precision and you're willing to pay for it. How does $5,000 sound? If you're NASA, and you're looking for a joystick good enough to fly zero G space shuttle simulations, five grand is a bargain. Thrust Master, the maker of popular flight sim game controllers, recently won a contract with Lockheed Martin to supply space shuttle simulator control sticks to NASA. The RHC or Rotational Hand Controller, will connect to UNIX stations and PC laptops to enable astronauts in training to practice maneuver ing and landing techniques before jumping behind the stick of the real thing. According to ThrustMaster's Bob Martin, the RHC is a \"median fidelity\" design. Essentially, it has all the same components-the stick and gimbals assembly-as the real shuttle stick. The only difference is that it's not flight certified; that is, it doesn't have the triple redundancy systems required of flight-certified instruments. Like your typical PC joystick, the RHC has a button, a trigger and a hat switch. However, the stick also has three axes of movement: a pitch forward, a tilt backward and a \"twist\" or yaw, which emulates aircraft rudder pedals. The latter allows the pilot to angle into a crosswind without deviating from his target course. In addition to these three axes, the stick has a knuckle pitch-a small joint in the shaft that creates a smaller movement radius, which in turn provides more stability in the controller by keeping the push/pull action restricted to the wrist. Major General Joe Engle, former commander of the space shuttle Discovery, teste d and evaluated the controller. He says the RHC is, \"very similar to the shuttle's. It has the same close geometry and stick force gradients.\" Maj. Gen. Engle is the only astronaut to ever manually land the space shuttle, entering the Earth's atmosphere at Mach 35. The ThrustMaster RHC is expected to cost NASA about $5,000 per stick-a fraction of the estimated $1 million that NASA engineer Jim Brock says an original would cost. But if five grand is still too rich for your budget, ThrustMaster plans to have a retail version of the RHC on shelves by fall of this year for approximately $30.-Jill Anderson ONE GIANT STICK FOR MANKIND The Thrust Master stick designed for space shut tle simulators will be coming to a store near you.

Sadly, even the characters didn't capture my interest, and as for trying to engage that \"elusive female audience,\" we can get profound lines such as \"She's obvi. ously a great piece of ass\" and \"I don't want to play basketball, I want to get laid,\" from Melrose Place. --Charlotte Panther Philips Media, (800) 8833767 Mac/Windows CD-ROM REC CG JUNE 1996 "

"THE COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 1996 he past year has seen a number of games destined to follow in the footsteps of titles like FALCON 3.0, Sid Meier's CIVILIZATION, and M.U.L.E.—these programs, too, will someday be considered classics. As computer hardware has reached new heights of speed and power, and developers have honed their craftsman's tools, today's simulations edge ever nearer to the real thing, recent wargames bring you that much closer to the battlefront, and adventures may finally be achieving the Holy Grail status of true interactive movies. We present here the best of the past year, in the Computer Gaming World Premier Awards. Each year, the editors of CGW try to single out the best computer game in each category, as well as the Best of the Best-our Premier Game of the Year. We don't nominate games that are merely popular, or games which simply appeal to us. We nominate games with the realism, brilliance, and audacity to suspend a cynical gamer's disbelief and have him or her crawling, with complete disregard for sleep and social standing, back for more. In other words, we nominate the BEST. The games are judged on a number of levels, including originality and innovation, playability, contribution to their genre, popularity among our readership, impact upon the computer gaming hobby. and just plain fun value. In the next few pages, we invite you to celebrate the fa nalists and winners of these Premier awards with us. You'll discover why we thought the finalists were so important. and why we believe the winners are truly the best in their class. And, for the first time, we've also included the Readers' Choice for each category, so you can see how your choices compared to ours.

"CG PREMIER AWARDS 1996 GAME OF THE YEAR WARGAME OF THE YEAR TITATI argames returned to their roots this year. All of the final ists were turn-based, but none quite as staid or pre. dictable as one might expect. SSI'S STEEL PANTHERS, this year's winner, is the most focused game by legendary designer Gary Grigsby in years, Grognards love the game for its attention to realistic detail, while others are entranced by the game's beauty. Within the familiarity of the turn-based structure, STEEL PANTHERS keeps things brisk, unpredictable and violent. The smoke, the wreckage of the battlefield, the distinctive \"chink\" of Sherman tank fire bouncing helplessly off Tiger tanks-all add to the tension and chaos of battle in this evocative, tremendous achievement of WWII tactical warfare. BATTLEGROUND: GETTYSBURG by Talonsoft is so much sheer fun that it could have captured top honors in many prior years. As the BATTLEGROUND series continues to mature, it continues to blend the best elements of board games and miniatures with the strengths of com: puter wargames. LEADER REPLACED HEN232 BER in 'Cornand Art Command An Comhand Sputation Unit he overall Game of the Year always generates controversy. The Game of the Year must transcend genre boundaries and appeal to a wide range of gamers. This year's winner was a clear-cut choice. THE BEAST WITHIN: GABRIEL KNIGHT II pushes the envelope in story, technology, and design. Both GABRIEL KNIGHT adventures have been something special. They are more than games, they are art. The original GABRIEL KNIGHT offered brilliant symbolism using the visual metaphor of dream se. quences in the style of a graphic novel. As a game, it offered a mix of easy, tough and in decipherable puzzles, but as a story it com. municated that we have indissoluble and mysterious links to our past that need to be integrated into our personal image of self. THE BEAST WITHIN goes further. It still offers brilliant symbolism, but it also offers more in gameplay than its predecessor. As the title suggests, Jane Jensen's script addresses humankind's desire to embrace the primitive and how that base nature can overpower us. Yet, she doesn't preach to us or even offer a final answer. She merely used wordplay and symbolism to illu. minate, rather than to blind. In terms of game design, Jensen offers a great variety of clue types: audio, text, visual object and cinematic scene. She even inte grated a strategy game within the climactic puzzle. Nathan and Darlou Gams designed a game environment with a rich, textured look and Robert Holmes outdid his past efforts with an incredible faux-Wagn er piece for the finale In terms of technolo gy, the program ming team seamlessly interlaced the digitized video, photographic backdrops and the game interface. Finally, the full-mo. tion video was used extremely well to reward the player with additional information rather than punish the player with interminable cut scenes. GABRIEL KNIGHT || is the continuation of a brilliant tradi tion-the graphic adventure as art. That it combines solid technology and a marvelous aesthetic with outstanding gameplay is a testament to a designer who understands that \"the game is the thing.\" Long live Gabriel Knight! Readers' Choice: WARCRAFT II, BLIZZARD Incredible Simulations' CUSTER'S LAST COMMAND builds on the modest success of DEFEND THE ALAMO! with a richer, more hardedged historical simulation of the controversial events of the 7th Cavalry's last ride. It's challenging, fun and quite clever-not bad coming from what's essentially a one-man operation. Scott Hamilton's PANTHERS IN THE SHADows goes beyond even the customary HPS Simulations level of detail. PANTHERS is as complex on a tactical level as say, PACIFIC WAR is on a strategic one. Still, it you can handle the sheer amount of data thrown at you, you will find a playable and enjoyable game at its None of these people is Gabriel Knight; they're members of the development team: (left to right) Jerry Shaw, Robert Holmes, Jane Jensen, John Shroades, Sabine Duvall, Darlou and Nathan Gams core.

For those who wonder why all those old SPI board games never find their way onto the computer, RAW Entertainment comes to the rescue with RISE OF THE WEST. The game isn't much to look at, but it's old-fashioned in the best sense: a tough Al. clean interface and challenging scenarios let you attempt to out-do Charlemagne, or die heirless. The sweep of the Dark Ages takes on a certain grandeur, as does this modest product, easily RAW's best game in years. Readers' Choice: STEEL PANTHERS, SSI SEED CG JUNE 1996 "

"CG PREMIER AWARDS 1996 ROLE-PLAYING GAME OF THE YEAR NSSCREAM ADVENTURE GAME OF THE YEAR he Adventure Game of the Year is Harlan Ellison's T HAVE No MOUTH AND I MUST SCREAM. Though Ellison has won many awards for literary excellence in the past, he shares this honor with the game's designer, David Sears, the game's de: velopers, The Dreamers' Guild, and the game's publisher, MGM/Cyberdreams. I Have No MOUTH is an innovative game where the interaction enriches the vivid atmosphere of Ellison's award-winning story. Even Ellison's voiceover as the sadistic uber-computer, AM, adds to the game's freshness. With both intense game: play and emotional punch, I HAVE NO MOUTH proves that game licenses don't have to be pale imitations of their literary predecessors. The other finalists provided their own degrees of freshness and strong writing. Capstone and DreamForge Intertainment teamed to bring the late Roger Zelazny's science fiction visions to life in the beautiful CHRONOMASTER. The many worlds of the various \"pocket universes\" are each unique, featuring clever puzzles and gorgeous his is the year of the solitaire role playing adventure. 3-D first-person perspective has caused a de emphasis away from adventuring parties and focused on the single hero adventure. This year's Role Playing Game of the Year is ANVIL OF DAWN, developed by DreamForge Intertainment and published by New World Computing. It allows the player to assume the role of any one of five different heroes and play the game in first-person from that hero's perspective. The magic system emphasizes seven different magical disciplines (each with three or four spells) and doesn't overburden the player with redundant spells. Instead, like the rest of the game, the focus is upon playability. Also, the game is enriched with skillbased development. The more you use the talents possessed by your hero, the more they develop. Playability and balance make Anvil this year's winner in a year where both finalists are Kill Foozle games (where the sole goal is defeating an Ultimate Bad Guy) and both finalists are 3-D first-person games, The other finalist was Interplay's STONEKEEP, nominated for its beautiful SGI rendered characters and fascinating story de velopment, but limited because of the number SVGA scenes. Both the script and the voice talents lift CHRONOMAS: TER well above the usual standards of the genre. Sanctuary Woods took a more classical adventure game approach to showcase the explorations of Robert Ripley in THE RIDDLE OF MASTER LU. The end result is satisfying and even charming-an \"old-fashioned\" adventure game in the best sense, because it de pends on strength of writing and interac tion with charac: ters to win. The more than two years that went into Spec trum HoloByte's STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION: A FINAL UNITY, proved worth the wait. Despite incon: sistent graphics and disappointing tactical combat, near impeccable voiceovers from the stellar televison cast made the game very compelling. Moreover, the game's script was at least as well written as many of the series' final episodes. Readers' Choice: FULL THROTTLE, LUCASARTS The Anvil of Dawn team.

The Dreamer's Guild rises from the darkness of I HAVE NO MOUTH AND I MUST SCREAM to be joined by Cyberdream's David Mullich. of CGW readers who couldn't fight past the bugs.

"CG PREMIER AWARDS 1996 CRUSADER SPREUVERT ACTION GAME OF THE YEAR uccessful action games are the ones that send you into an environment so real that you find yourself literally ducking around corners, grunting with exertion and living as your on: screen avatar. Imagine the adrenalin rush that comes with rushing forward into a dark tunnel, your shotgun dancing in the bloody light of the wall's red alert signals, while you wait for the first mech to rear its ugly metallic head so you can destroy it with a shower of hot fire and cold steel. This year's Action Game of the Year, Origin's CRUSADER: No REMORSE, provides just such a rush, reeling you into a bloodpumping world of explosions, burning bodies and laser crossing. As a reformed trooper who's seen the light, you decide to infiltrate the evil facilities of the government, wreaking havok and engaging in guerilla warfare to destroy the government's infrastructure. Beautifully rendered isometric SVGA graphics are backed by an amazing variety of weapons to choose from; automatic pis tols, massive energy beam weapons, grisly shotguns, three types of mines, and other weapons of mass de: struction. At every level you'll find challenges beyond the visceral combat, such as floor puzzles to de cipher and alarms to dismantle. At the heart of the game, though, is unadulterated, vicious, immersive fun. CRUSADER faced a tough challenge from the other finalists. We spent many hours playing DARK FORCES from LucasArts, which took Doom to the evil Empire and the Death Star, where we battled Boba Fett, Darth Vadar and a host of Storm Troopers. What ultimately crippled this dark romp though, was its lack of a save game. Hexen, the sequel to Raven's HERETIC, was another Doom bloodfest distinguished by its fantasy setting and the fact that it let you play as either a fighter, priestor mage, each with unique attributes and weapons. Finally, THE NEED FOR SPEED, Elec tronic Arts' incredibly fast and enthralling driving game, almost caught the checkered flag. Multiple courses with distinctive feels, brilliant SVGA graphics, and some of the hottest iron on the road made this 3D0 conversion a worthy entry into the PC action game arena. Readers' Choice: CRUSADER: No REMORSE, ORIGIN SPORTS GAME OF THE YEAR or the first time in four years, we have a winner other than FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL. While Patrick Cook's brainchild is still the best pigskin simulation available, it received little more than a graphic upgrade this season-leaving the field open for a new champion. Certainly, this year's winning NBA LIVE was every bit as innovative as the original FPS FOOTBALL, bringing for the first time the true feel of action-oriented basketball to the PC. The licensing fee paid by EA Sports was well spent, as almost every NBA hoops hero outside of Michael Jordan was included: you can duplicate Barkley's low-post moves; take soaring jumpers as Mitch Richmond; rebound ferociously as Dennis Rodman-complete with the patented carrot-top hairdo. The real surprise though, is the accuracy of the statistical infor mation. Patrick Ewing and Hakeem Olajuwon are always among the scoring leaders, Rodman gets his share of rebounds, and John Stockton racks up league-leading assists. When you add in the gorgeous high-res views and the addictive flow of play-nasty fouls, blocked shots, quick hands creating steals-NBA Live is simply the best blend of sports action and simulation currently available. Another EA Sports game that consistently leads the competition in its category is finalist NHL HOCKEY. But the '96 version, while still the best hockey game, fails to reach the heights of NBA Live, despite the on-rink action and upgraded graphic look. The other worthy contenders tend toward pure simulation and strategy. PGA TOUR GOLF '96, another example of EA Sports' dom inance in this category. echoes the beauty of LINKS 386, and adds competition against golf legends Tom Kite, Fuzzy Zoeller and others, with faster CD loading times and a better Al than last year's model. TROPHY Bass by Sierra rewards patient gamers with the best fishing simulation yet. And TITLE FIGHT PRO Boxing may be from a small company, Comp-U-Sports, but it boasts a heavyweight boxing simulation punch, realistically recreating professional pugilists from Joe Louis to Iron Mike Tyson. Our congratulations to these finalists, and to the winner, NBA Live, for its creativity and sense of sheer fun in a competitive arena.

"CG PREMIER AWARDS 1996 SIMULATION OF THE YEAR MEGHWARNIN imulation games are based on the modeling of vehicles in real-world environments. Typical sims put you in the cockpit of fighter aircraft, behind the wheel of a 230 mph-plus race car, or at the con of a submarine stalking its prey. The successful simulation balances a high level of realism with fun, not tedious, gameplay. In this year's winner, EF2000, develop ers Ocean and DID manage to provide that winning balance. The Eurofighter 2000's systems are modeled in fantastic detail, from the AWACS downlink to the wide variety of available weapons systems. The flight model does a good job of making you feel like you really are flying an advanced, fly-by-wire fighter jet. The ground-breaking terrain and aircraft graphics don't hurt, either. The innovative dynamic campaign engine-especially the fully functional version in the EF2000 2.0 patch-gives this sim lasting play value. This year's finalists provided tough competi tion. ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS, from Electronic Arts' Jane's Combat Simula tions line, makes up for its aging engine by providing the best multiplayer environment of any modern sim. The variety of aircraft available for network play is amazing. FIGHTER DUEL, from Philips, deserves special note for its superb modeling of top World War Il fighters and its sweat-inducing head. to head play. INDYCAR 2, from Papyrus (now a division of Sierra), takes the al. ready excellent INDYCAR design and adds much-improved driver Al that makes the race to the checkered flag all the more gut wrench ing. We also admired the graphics, which were supercharged to SVGA resolution, but we have to admit the remarkable variety of crashes was part of what kept us glued to the screen. Finally, the Russian-designed Su-27 FLANKER from SSI should keep the ultra-realism fans enter tained while they continue the vig il for FALCON 4. This simulation of the Rus sians' hottest fighter includes an astonishing variety of allies and targets in the air and on the ground, as well as extremely challenging computer pilot Al. The outstanding mission editor built into the game has resulted in a variety of challenging freely-distributable scenarios, available across the net. Readers' Choice: EF2000, OCEAN/DID SPACE SIMULATIONS reating a successful space simulation is tough indeed. Without a convincing back story and a passing nod to sci: entific theory, an attempt at a space simulation can quickly degenerate into a 3-D shoot-em-up action game. The successful space simulation manages to create a science-fiction environmentboth in the universe portrayed on the screen and the underlying back-story-that's convincing enough to im merse you in the game experience. While the experience may be pure fantasy, the successful space sim simulates its imaginary universe to a degree that you can suspend disbelief and be drawn in. It's this rich, enthralling universe that can makes Activision's MECHWARRIOR 2 our Premier Space Simulation of the Year. Designers Sean Vesce and Zachary Norman had the advantage of a pre-existing, richly documented universe to draw on, as MECHWARRIOR 2 is based on FASA'S BATTLETECH universe. But what makes this more than just a giant robot game is the designers' superb adaptation of that universe. A few missions into the game and you'll really feel like you have a stake in the continued success of the Wolf or Falcon clan.

"SNEAK PREVIEW DARK EARTH CSNEAK GPREVIEW GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT Old World, MEN New Tech, Dark Future Mindscape's DARK EARTH Paints Brilliant Visuals of a Dark Future by Johnny L. Wilson n Europe, those who face the chal lenges of the present are overbur dened by the glory of the past. In modern France, this is par ticularly true. The buildings of the colonial era with the masquerades (stone faces set above first floor windows) and neoclassical masterpieces of the Second Empire rest as uncomfortable reminders that the French cul. ture of today doesn't permeate as far through. out the world as did that of the colonial era, Napoleonic conquests. To speak of French culture conjures visions of turn of the century Impressionist painters and musicians or the early 20th-century Existentialist philosophers, a cafe society of the past rather than progressive visionaries of the present. Even in French music video stores, visitors are likely to see more emphasis on the latest trends from the U.S. than the modern equivalents of Debussy in music or Cocteau in film. Even in, or perhaps especially in, computer games, this is true. Baltimore's Sid Meier is better known than any of the designers at Ubisoft, Infogrames, Cryo, Delphine, Psygnosis (Paris) or Mindscape (Bordeaux). This Christmas, that may not be so true. 3.

The spiritual heirs of ALONE IN THE DARK and OUT OF THIS WORLD are on their way, and they look marvelous. Further, they not only look marvelous, but their designers want them to play marvelously, as well. DARK EARTH, Mindscape Bordeaux's venture into the 3-D graphic adventure market, is at the forefront of this new wave of French artistry. Even if this game universe was not giving birth to a network television series, its own line of novels, and a strategy game to follow the adventure, it would be something special. Not only may it serve as a key product in defining this new wave of French culture, but it does so by building on the strengths of France's past.

"DARK EARTH SNEAK PREVIEW Sun God (Great Solaar). They are also the ruling caste through their Council of the Seven. This group, analogous to priests throughout history, supervises food distribution, civic sanitation (through various spiritual cleaning expeditions) and dispense \"divine\" justice. The \"Church\" of Dark Earth also has its enforcers, the Guardians of Fire. These are the security forces, municipal utilities (keeping the torches lit to provide light and the braziers stoked to provide heat), firefighters, and communications specialists (via a series of giant mirrors atop each Stallite dome). They also provide research and development of each Stallite's primitive technology. Add to these upper castes the roles of Builders (craftsmen and the proletariat), Providers (hunters and farmers against the odds), and Scavengers (the disenfranchised who sift through the waste and ruins of the universe in order to eek out survival). ARKHAN ASYLUM The game begins in the bedroom of Arkhan, a Guardian of Fire. This shot shows the main perspective within the game. Jules Verne, a sense of science reflecting post-revolutionary France as a center of reason, and the French artistic traditions related to light all contribute to the richness of the DARK EARTH universe. A TRIP TO THE GLOOM Naturally, the set-up of the universe would lead one to believe that existing in this world is the cliche' goal of recognizing the ongoing battle between light and darkness as good and evil, and then aiding the side of light (or good) as it strives to win the ultimate battle. According to Guillaume Le Pennec, the design director JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE LIGHT The DARK EARTH world is our world three centuries in the future, after a cataclysmic brush with a comet that nearly duplicates the meteorite storms posited in modern dinosaur theory. Put far too simply, many scientists feel that a series of meteorites impacted the surface of the earth, causing volcanic eruptions and geological upheaval. The result was that the atmosphere was thick with enough ash, dust and gaseous pollutants that the positive effects of the sun were blocked, an ice age encroached, and the warm. blooded species like the dinosaurs were destroyed. DARK EARTH uses a similar set-up. The meteors hit, geological calamities are followed by almospheric devastation, photosynthesis stops, poisonous clouds drift through much of the world, and 98.6 percent of the world's population dies. The remainder of the human population assembles under rare pockets of light where they build feudal city-states called Stallites. Between the Stallites, only mutated creatures and deadly bands of brigands travel. With the bulk of human population destroyed, so is the bulk of scientific and technological knowledge. A civilization analogous to those of the Dark Ages develops, where the masters of faith and/or superstition and the masters of force and/or oppression form a hierarchy to rule the remainder of humanity. It seems almost axiomatic that for a French design team to place a religious hierar. chy in both roles. Remember that during the French Revolution, the assets of the Church were taken from the priests because of the Church's role in supporting the decadent monarchy. Only with Napoleon do we see some of these assets returning to the Church. Obviously, in a world where much of the planetary surface is covered by deadly darkness and icy cold, and the most habitable places for survival are pockets where the sun peeks through the cloud layer, the dominant religion is likely to be based on sun wor ship. The Sunseers are a priestly caste who lead the worship of the FIRE FIGHTERS In addition to keeping the peace, maintaining the fires, and fighting fires that burn out of control the Guardians of Fire train to be warriors in the traditional sense. who is leading the DARK EARTH project, that would be an erroneous assumption. While it is true that there is an ongoing struggle between light and dark, it is not true that they are equivalent to good and evil. The world of DARK EARTH is a world of grays and, the deeper the player gets into it, the more gray it becomes Le Pennec prefers to speak of the ongoing struggle within the land as that of light versus shadow. He hints that they may be closer to symbols of life and death, but wisely notes that death is not always evil. Within the course of the game, the player tries to puzzle out the meaning of light and shadow through events that point to a JUNE 1996 CG "

The technology we're using allows us to have multiple light sources on the 3-D characters and, depending on the light sources, sometimes, multiple shad. Ows.\" In a world where light is so important, it is important that the play of light be as prominent in the graphics as it is in the story. Dark Earth's designers have accomplished this by designing costumes for the Sunseers that have all sorts of refracting pieces of glass, jewels and metal upon them so that you get to see marvelous effects when they hit the light. Of course, the weapons play off the light sources, as well. Further, there are times when your character is the bearer of the light source; this is even more vividly illustrated. Even if you don't care for the mythical/philosophical storyline, you have to be impressed with the visual look of this game. The LAB TEST The remnant of Dark Earth's lost technology can often perspective is a three-quarter overhead view similar to CRUSADER: be found in this laboratory a la Jules Verne, No REMORSE, but the resolution seems higher because the detail on the characters is amazing.

Instead, the machines are a cross between Jules Verne and the French designers of the early industrial age.

"SNEAK PREVIEW DARK EARTH has a cool jazz theme that segues into a martial theme as he moves into the military hall of the Guardians of Fire. Further, he has added fighting themes with a heavy percussive feel, and magical themes to reflect the appropriate moments within the game. RASTA MAN This cyberbum is representative of the characters to be found in the cinematic sequences which unfold the secret history of Dark Earth. MYSTERIOUS ARKHAN Of course, all the artistic detail and conceptual brilliance of the world will come to nothing if the game play isn't right. In DARK EARTH, you control Arkhan, one of the Guardians of Fire. You move him through the world using the front, left, right, and back keys on the keyboard much like you controlled the character Twinsen in RELENTLESS. The difference, besides the game universe, is that you are not on as linear of a game track with Arkhan as you were with Twinsen. With Twinsen, you basically had to solve each puzzle in a sel order so that you could move on. With Arkhan, you encounter more friendly characters than Twinsen did, and you have more options in responding. For example, right after you leave Arkhan's sleeping quarters, you encounter your martial arts trainer. He tells you that he has time for a lesson, but you have the option of following him or not. If you follow him, you receive training that will not only improve the attributes behind your fighting skill, but will familiarize you with the combat interface. At first, your goal is mere exploration, but soon you discover that you have been contaminated by a black, porous, ice-cold ooze of parasitical substance which you will even tually discover is called Shankr Archessence (to reveal more is to spoil some of the effect). Once contaminated, you will discover that you are mutating into one of the monsters from which you protect the Stallite. You find everyone shrinking from you as though you were a leper. You have to get to the bottom of the story before you become one of the vampire-like creatures of the dark A Jules Verne-esque thermometer shows the status of your life force and contamination. A red line in the center symbolizes life force and two tubes darken around it as your life is constricted by the contamination. To reverse the trend, you'll have to choose postures and attitudes as you converse with the supporting characters you encounter (there are many more conversations than we've seen in most 3-D graphic adventures); discover what passes for magic and for technology within this universe: and engage in combat. Combat is extremely satisfying. The artificial opponents are at this point in production) extremely tough to beat and the combat animation is the fastest we've seen. The basic moves (Parry, Duck, Kick and Strike) would be challenging enough, but there are some special moves to be encountered as you move through the game, as well. During combat, camera angles change a la ALONE IN THE DARK, but with a smoother effect and less disorientation than we experienced in the earlier game. Finally, the secret history of DARK EARTH is revealed through 3-D cinematic sequences which blend SOFTIMAGE animation, motioncapture, and film techniques. If the rest of the game is stunning, these cinematic sequences are brilliant. Olivier Bailly-Maitre, the team leader on the cinematics, calls himself \"Ed Wood\" after the cheap film director of Hollywood's past, but the cinematic effects are nothing like Wood's cheap sets and meagre effects. These sequences serve as both reward and inspiration. AROUND THE WORLD IN 3-D WAYS With DARK EARTH, Mindscape Bordeaux appears to be raising the bar for 3-D entertainment. They are building a world through which it would be fascinating to adventure in no matter what technology was used, and they are enhancing it using the 3-D character of the presentation to help unfold the story as no other technology (FMV, traditional pixel-based animation, or low-res first-person point of view) could do. As early as we saw DARK EARTH, we can't know about the one critical part of the game-pacing. If you feel Arkhan's desperation and ticking biological time bomb as you play the game in the way we think you're going to feel it, this will be a great game. If not, it will merely be great technology. Either way, it stands to be one of the most talked about games for this Christmas. I certainly think Jules Verne would be proud. cise JUNE 1996 "

"SOUND CARDS MAKING DECISION ASOUND I It's Easy To Find A Sound Card That Sounds Good, But Compatibility With Games Is The Real Trick by Loyd Case QUOS BLASTER AWE32 PNP For The U sol Wire-Table S lus Esperience acsis ou'll be amazed how much better your games look with a good sound card and speakers. Sound like fuzzy logic? Perhaps it's not. Lucasfilm recently released a new version of Star Wars remastered for the high-end, Dolby THX sound system. When people were shown the two versions of Star Wars, with the original and new soundtracks, they were asked to rate the image quality of the picture. Even though the only thing that had changed was the soundtrack, people consistently picked the THX version as having better picture quality. For the most immersive gaming experience, great audio is essential. For instance, the sounds in MECHWARRIOR 2 and ZORK NEMESIS add enor. mously to the atmosphere. Clearly, however, if the sound card (and speakers) can't deliver a quality signal, then that immersive experience is diminished. We took a look at a number of the latest sound cards, including sev eral Plug ann Play (PnP) cards and one General MIDI (GM) daughter. card. The good news is that these cards sound better than ever; even the lower-cost cards sound pretty good. The bad news is that Plug-andPlay is actually making life more difficult for DOS games (more on this Das TV CREATIVE LABS AWE32 PLUG-AND-PLAY in the reviews.) In looking at these sound cards, we took into account the installation headache factor, their sampled wave audio and GM sound quality, and game compatibility in DOS and Windows 95.

"SOUND CARDS a Mozart solo piano piece, the theme from Star Wars and a generic fusion/rock piece with lots of electric instruments So without further ado, let's dive right in, shuffle the deck, and lay the cards on the table. WE ENSONIQ SOUNDSCAPE ELITE CREATIVE LABS AWE32 PLUG-AND-PLAY The AWE32 sound card originally hit the streets over two years ago. Since then, it's gone through a couple of iterations, the newest being the PnP model. We checked out the full AWE32, which differs from the value edition in having a connector for a MIDI daughtercard, plus some additional software. The digital audio section, which is usually responsible for speech and sound effects, sounded pretty clean, certainly cleaner than the old Sound Blaster 16. We checked out several Windows 95 games, includ. ing Activision's latest release, ZORK NEMESIS. Whatever the merits of the game, the audio in ZORK NEMESIS is very demanding, requiring a 16-bit sound card. The verdict: great speech and sound effects. The built-in MIDI wavetable on the AWE was less impressive, howev. er. With only one megabyte of wavetable ROM, compromises have to be made. The strings sounded thin and shrill, and the horns sounded just okay. The trumpet was weak, lacking fullness. The piano was pret ty good, befitting the keyboard synthesizer legacy of the wavetable. However, the snare drum sounded downright awful and the kick drum was very muddy. GM sound quality can be improved in one of two ways: adding a GM daughtercard or adding RAM (the AWE has two memory slots.) There is a shareware, 2 MB GM patch set for the AWE available on CompuServe. Installation was relatively straightforward, although we needed to go back to the Windows 95 Device Manager to manually adjust IRQ settings (but that beats setting jumpers.) Plug-and-play boards automati. cally select IRQ settings, but unfortunately they're rarely the \"standard\" settings that DOS games expect. To run DOS games, you need to install a PnP driver, supplied by Creative Labs on floppy disk. Unfortunately, there's no mention of this in any of the documentation, only a README file on the disk itself, so be warned. Once you install the driver (which uses only 2 KB of mem ory), DOS games run just fine, either in Sound Blaster or AWE mode. The AWE is pricey for what you get: a nice, clean digital audio section, a mediocre MIDI wavetable, a high degree of compatibility with most games, and lots of room for expansion (which adds to the cost, of course.) ORCHID NUSOUND PLUG-AND-PLAY Like the AWE, the Orchid NuSound is a PnP, wavetable-capable sound card with a highly compressed, 1 MB wavetable. Although a bit quirky (some of the instruments seemed very inaccurate), the overall Wavetable sound was one of the best 1 MB sets we've heard. The digital audio section, based on the Crystal Semiconductor chipset, sounded pretty clean. The board also has built-in Spatializer 3-D sound capability, making for some interesting effects when playing games like DUKE NUKEM 3-D. The installation was a bit problematic, though. The Crystal chipset has a problem with some Award PnP BIOS chips, so check for compatibility before buying. We tested on systems with both Award and AMI BIOS's. Running Award BIOS 4.50pg, the system refused to boot with the Orchid card. However, the AMI-based system ran just fine. After talking with several card vendors, it seems that the problem lies with the Award BIOS rather than the card itself. Once running, the board installed without any problems. There were two very odd quirks during installation that could confuse some users, though. First, when installing the Windows 95 applications software (after installing the drivers and getting sound out of the system), the audio drivers were disabled and had to be reinstalled. Second, to run DOS games outside of Windows 95, you need to load a driver in the CONFIG.SYS file. This is well documented, but the manual also discusses some DOS utilities that are used to configure and adjust the card. Several of them are only available, however, if you install from Windows 3.1. There is no way to extract them if you only have Windows 95 (or a DOS-only system, for that matter). One cool option for the NuSound is a front control panel that can be mounted in an available 3 1/2-inch drive bay. It has a little volume control, a couple of defeat buttons and all the connectors, right there in front ORCHID NUSOUND PLUG-AND-PLAY CG JUNE 1996 "

"SOUND CARDS For the cost, the NuSound is a nice little card, but watch out for the installation quirks, Mixing It Up With DirectSound irectSound is the audio part of Microsoft's DirectX software toolkit for Windows 95 game developers. It's of concern to those of us playing Windows 95 games since you need to have the right driver to get DirectSound support. To the programmer, DirectSound appears to have the features of a rich, high-end sound card. The core of the DirectSound API (applica. tion programming interface) is the hardware abstraction layer (HAL), which can use whatever dedicated audio hardware a sound card has to offer, and off-loads the rest of the audio duties to the CPU. ENSONIQ SOUNDSCAPE ELITE This is the one non-PnP card in the roundup (other than the daugh. terboard). Even so, installation was fairly straightforward. The only hitch was that the Windows 95 drivers shipped with the card didn't support Microsoft's DirectSound for Windows 95 games, but Ensoniq already has a new version up on various online services (look for build 44). True to its high-end synthesizer legacy, the Ensonig Wavetable sounded very clean, although the solo piano sounded a bit bright. The horn section was a little weak, but strings were great. Rock sounds played with a huge applied reverb, particularly on the kick drum. All in all, a very nice, 2 MB wavetable. Digital audio was very clean-when it worked. Like many DSP. based boards, the Ensoniq uses software to download a Sound Blaster emulation program to the board, and that approach doesn't always work well. We could never get EA's ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS to run with the Ensonig's Sound Blaster emulation-it would lock up solid. Most other games worked well. Quite a few of the more recent games ship with native Ensoniq drivers, but even that is no guarantee. While the TIE FIGHTER CD ran (and sounded) great, TERRA NOVA would proper ly autodetect the Ensoniq card, then never play speech or sound effects. These kinds of problems are really unfortunate, because the Ensoniq is a great sounding card at a reasonable price. Check your DOS game library for compatibility before buying. Windows 95 games, however, sounded superb. Another plus is Ensonic's above average customer support, which is quite refreshing these days. There are two ways of supporting digital sound in Windows 95. One is through the normal multimedia audio mechanism (known as the Wave API, which first appeared in Windows 3.1), and the other is through DirectSound. The neat thing about DirectSound is its support for hardware acceleration, which is particularly critical for mixing sounds. As game audio gets more complex, titles will be mixing many discrete channels of sound in order to achieve a more immersive effect. Mixing audio, however, is CPU-intensive, and has to happen quickly (known as low-latency), and good sounds card will have an onboard hardware mixer that game programmers can directly access using DirectSound. An interesting aspect of DirectSound is what it'll mean for Creative Labs, which has enjoyed market dominance thanks in large part to their Sound Blaster specification. Many legacy titles will still need Sound Blaster compatibility for audio, but DirectSound titles won't care if there's Sound Blaster-aware hardware in your PC. Creative makes good hardware, and has the lion's share of the sound card market, but now the playing field may level somewhat. Additionally, future versions of DirectSound will support audio compression, allowing more digital sound to be stored in less space, and a 3-D sound API (see other sidebar). The key to the best game experience under Windows 95 is to check with your sound card vendor to make sure their audio drivers support DirectSound. ADVANCED GRAVIS ULTRASOUND PLUG-AND-PLAY Like two other boards in this roundup based on the new AMD Interwave chipset, the Gravis board had problems with the Award BIOS. Even when we used an AMI-based system, the board was frustrating to set up and annoying to use. Ultrasound's installation and setup was by far the most complex of any board in our survey. Even GRAVIS. ULTRASOUND PLUG & PLAY Wariable PC Sound Card when following directions explicitly, we never got MIDI to work in Windows 95, and had to resort to Windows 3.1 to run our MIDI tests. Unlike past Ultrasound cards, the Ultrasound PnP has a built-in wavetable. The built-in wavetable was rather mediocre, with a thin piano section, flat-sounding horns and an unimpressive drumset. Since we had the Pro version, which ships with additional RAM, we also tried it in \"Gravis\" mode. The sound quality here was consider. ably better. Running with DOS games was, to put it bluntly, a nightmare. There are two different Sound Blaster emulation modes (one of which also supports GM), the Interwave mode (which has little or no support from DOS games currently) and the Ultrasound mode (available on only the Pro version). On top of that, you have to run a program called Prepgame for most DOS games, which would add drivers and update DOS extenders. While it sounds fairly good (when it works), this is no card for the technically faint-of-heart. We'd recommend avoiding this ADVANCED GRAVIS ULTRASOUND PLUG-AND-PLAY CG JUNE 1996 "

"SOUND CARDS card unless you need some of Gravis' unique features. standalone card-the DBG50 is a general MIDI daughtercard that requires a Waveblaster-style connector on a standard sound card. Yamaha's other offering is the SW60XG, an ISA board that fulfills the same role as its daughtercard cousin. The only difference is that the SW60 uses its own 18-bit digital-to-analog converter for its output, rather than going through a host sound card. The SW60's 18-bit reso. lution output makes for improved patch sound quality. 3-D Audio: Sound All Around CRYSTALAKE SERIES 140 CrystaLake is a fairly new company, and currently offers its cards via direct mail order. You can email your order or contact them on their non-toll free telephone number. Their high-end card, the 140, is very compelling, but has some quirks. Like two other cards in this roundup, the CrystaLake 140 doesn't work with the Award PnP BIOS. However, you can order it without PnP support, which works fine with the Award BIOS. There are some problems with the software installation-one DOS setup file was missing. The README files on disk are quite technical, and require some careful interpretation. The manual is complete and clear, coming close to the AWE32 in thoroughness. The card has a whopping 4 MB of wavetable sounds and built-in SRS 3-D audio. The card uses the Crystal Semiconductor 4232 chip for digital sound. Overall, the digital audio was the cleanest of the bunch, even better than the AWE. The GM sounds were superb. The piano was quite realistic, even Disn't just for graphics anymore. There's been lots of buzz about 3-D technologies coming to a PC near you, and audio may very well be the next big thing. Some titles out there, already implement crude versions of \"2.5-D\" audio, relying on volume and panning (left/right) to place sounds. While this method is a cheap way to apply some positioning to sounds in a game, the overall effect is less than convincing. On the hardware side, some \"3-D\" technologies have already reached the market, including SRS, Spatializer, and QSound, among others. But none of these technologies have become a de facto standard, and few title developers write to any one of them. SRS and Spatializer have found their way into multimedia speakers, but the problem with speaker-based implementations is that the entire audio signal is processed, rather than specific parts. CRYSTALAKE SERIES 140 better than the Yamaha daughterboard to our ears. The horn section was terrific, as were the strings. The drum section was very tight and solid, and the electric bass was stunning. We'd give the Yamaha daughterboard an overall edge, but this is a very good wavetable card. Once we installed the DOS driver, every game we threw at it ran quite well. Doom 2, ATF, TERRA NovA and WARCRAFT 2 all sounded great Under Windows 95, CIVILIZATION 2 and ZORK NEMESIS yielded some of the most impressive sound we've ever heard out of a standalone card. One other interesting feature for recording enthusiasts is the dual microphone inputs-very handy for true, digital stereo recording. If you're willing to overlook some of the installation quirks and are willing to buy direct from a young but friendly company direct, this card bears investigation. The term «3-D audio\" has been the subject of much confusion and marketing spin, so let's clarify the different types of audio enhancement technologies out there First, there are stereo field extension or \"spatializing\" technologies, which let you perceive sounds anywhere in a 180-degree semicircle in front of you. This method can be applied in the speakers themselves, or a sound card can apply the effect before sending the signal on. Though rela tively inexpensive, stereo field extension is basically a \"non-positional\" 3-D audio technology, and can't convincingly place sounds behind you. Next are multispeaker array technologies like Dolby's AC-3, which cur rently requires five speakers and a sub-woofer. Rather than apply algo rithms to approximate how we localize sound, multispeaker technologies direct sounds to specific speakers so that those sounds are physically located where we'd expect them to be. While this is a positional 3-D audio technology, it's a good deal more expensive than your garden variety pair of multimedia speakers. The newest entry in the 3-D audio game on the PC is binaural rendering, championed by Crystal River Engineering (CRE). Humans use a number of cues to localize sounds and binaural rendering applies effects to simulate these cues. While this positional 3-D audio technology can be very convincing, it can also be very CPU-intensive, and often requires a digital signal processor (DSP) to be on a sound card. Also, binaural ren dering tends to be far more convincing when played through headphones rather than speakers. Microsoft announced the Direct3-D Sound API at the recent Computer Game Developers' Conference, and while this API has positioning algo rithms hard-coded into it, QSound, Spatializer, and CRE have their own APIs that can talk to DirectSound. These three players along with SRS all have processor chips that sound card vendors can add for positional pro cessing, and Dolby is working on a two-speaker version of its AC-3 techInology. It's rumored that Microsoft will be licensing CRE's positioning algorithms for the Direct3-D Sound API, though they declined to comment. It remains to be seen which of these technologies developers will embrace, but hopefully, game titles will be able to take advantage of whatever 3-D audio accelerator hardware is out there.-Dave Salvator YAMAHA WAVEFORCE DBG50XG MIDI DAUGHTERCARD/ WAVEFORCE SW6OXG WAVETABLE SOUND UPGRADE CARD Unlike the other cards in this roundup, the Waveforce is not a CG JUNE 1996 "

"SOUND CARDS The DBG50 card can plug into a Sound Blaster 16 (not all models) or AWE32 (not the value edition), the NuSound card and any other card supporting a wavetable connector. At a street price of about $160, it's a serious investment for an addon. However, the Yamaha had the overall best MIDI sound of the lot. While the piano seemed a touch less realistic than the CrystaLake piano sound, it was full-bodied and rich. The only problem was the chording, which sounded more like bagpipes than piano. The clarinet and horns sounded quite good. Yamaha has extended the GM standard with its proprietary XG (Extended General MIDI) specification. XG allows for additional simul laneous real-time effects beyond the stock chorus and reverb, like a screaming wah-wah pedal on an electric guitar. XG also increases extends the number of patch banks available to the synth engine, making for more available patches. While the demos for XG sound impressive, the only game we were able to find that supports XG is TERRA Nova. GM music sounded great, but the XG demos were really stun ning. It remains to be seen, however, whether or not Yamaha's XG will become a prevalent standard. If you're in the market for a MIDI daughtercard, the XG definitely bears checking out. The price is slightly less on the street than the Roland SCD-15, our benchmark for GM, and the sound quality is just about as good. March issue, and the CrystaLake speakers in this month's \"READ.ME\"), and is a key piece in the audio puzzle to delivering killer sound. There seems to be a gradual shift away from GM to digital audioin the form of Audio-CD tracks-as multiple CD games become more prevalent, game designers now have the real estate to offer full digital music. The advantage here is guaranteed consistency in soundtrack quality rather than having to depend on varying quality wavetable synths or even poorer-sounding FM synthesis. Nonetheless, there's still a lot of GM support in current and future games, so having a solid wavetable adds to the overall gaming experience. of the cards we checked out, each seems to have its place. If you want guaranteed compatibility, Creative Labs' AWE32 is a good, albeit expensive choice. The Soundscape Elite comes from a company with a highly musical legacy, but it does have some drawbacks in the area of DOS game compatibility. The CrystaLake 140 is an impressive card from a young company that has its idiosyncrasies, but it's one of the better all-in-one solutions we've seen. The Orchid NuSound seems to be a solid card for those on a tight budget. About the only card we'd avoid is the Gravis Ultrasound PnP-it just requires too much work to become operational. The AWE32 with the Yamaha Waveforce daughtercard makes a nearly unbeatable combination-if you have an unlim: ited budget. We've certainly come a long way since the days of the original Adlib Music Card, and the choices available to the gamer are better than ever. With any luck, the next time you play your favorite game, maybe, just maybe, the game will look a little bit better. The difference, though, will likely be in your ears. BIG PICTURE...

"LOYD CASE TECHNOLOGY DOS Boot Tips For Win 95 cal Killer Configs For Running DOS Games Under Win 95 text file that contains various pieces of information that Win 95 needs when it boots.

DON'T DELETE THEM!!> ent. Finally, DnSpace=0 and Db/Space=0 makes sure that the disk compression drivers do NOT load. I don't use disk compression, but I've noticed on some systems the drivers load anyway, often taking up precious low memory. 've been answering a lot of c-mail questions lately about how to run DOS games under Windows 95. There seems to be a lot of confusion over the best way to run DOS games, how to set up the various configuration files and how to get the most out of low DOS memory. I thought I'd take some time to discuss how my system is set up-and why I do what I do. First, a philosophical point: I run my DOS games from the DOS prompt, not from the Windows 95 desktop. I don't even want the slight performance hit incurred when running in DOS exclusive mode, and I certainly don't want the performance hit that occurs when running a DOS game as a Windows 95 app. I've always been pretty comfortable with the DOS command line, so I don't mind changing to the right directory and running a game. Even so, I don't like mucking around with my configuration files or creating a boot disk, just to get a game to rum. So I've got my system running in a way that obviates the need for a boot disk. Let's take a look at the files used to configure Win 95 as it's booting up. I'll explain each of them, and show the tweaks I've made to my system. The first file of interest is MSDOS.SYS. In older versions of DOS, this was a binary file that was part of the DOS core, and was a lidlden file that was loaded during the boot process. In Windows 95, it's still a hidden file, but now it's just a simple With this setup, I do have to reboot occasionally, but I've never had to use a boot disk. The important stuff is under the (Options) heading, BootMulti= 1 gives me the ability to boot back to DOS 6.22 if I want by pressing the F4 key at the \"Starting Windows 95\" message. Note that this line is meaningless if your system came pre-installed with Windows 95. BootCUI=0 is a key parameter.it tells the system to boot to the DOS prompt! 'The DOS prompt you get is the Win 95 DOS prompt; the Windows environnent never loads. I'll explain why later. Nehwork=1 turns on Win 95 networking, BootDelav 10 means that Win 95 will pause 10 seconds at the \"Starting Windows 95\" message. Tlie default is two seconds, which isn't enough time to decide between old DOS or Win 95. BootWinI means that the default is to boot to Win 95, I have to take some action (press the 14 or 1:8 function keys) to do something differGO CONFIGURE... The next important file is CONFIG.SYS. Yes, it still exists, and it behaves much the same way as the old version did. CONFIG.SYS is where a lot of operating system paramctors and DOS drivers are loaded. Win 95 supports multiple configurations, just like DOS 6.

I lowever, they also don't require much lower DOS memory So I have a configuration that loads all my DOS drivers low, and I don't run the Win 95 desktop with this boot setup. This gives me 515 KB of lower DOS memory, more than enough for most DOS extender games. INOMEM DEVICE=C:\\WIN95\\HIMEM.SYS DOS=HIGH buffers=20 files=50 UND NOW VE BOOT...

The rest of the file is pretty much what you'd expect, but look at the single entry under: WIN95. It's the win command. If you boot to the Win 95 DOS prompt (as I specified in the MSDOS.SYS file), you can still run the Win 95 desktop by typing win, just like prior versions of DOS. This is how I still manage to boot to the DOS prompt for my games, but rum the Win 95 desktop by default. There's one more important file that resides in the default Win95 clirectory called DOSSTARTBAT: This is a critical file for running an MS-DOS exclusive game. The DOSSTARTBAT file contains commands that normally run in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, but are only required for MS-DOS mode. Typically, they would include the MSCDEX.EXE driver for CDROM access and the DOS mouse clriver. The problem with running MSCDEX.EXE from this file is that it assumes that the CD-ROM device driver ASPICD.SYS in my case) has been exccuted in the CONFIG.SYS file. Also, Win 95 sometimes REMS the command lines for the CDROM controller drivers when it installs. Thankfully, there's a simple solution: Look in your CONFIG.SYS file and make sure that your CD-ROM controller drivers are loading If you're booling Win 95, it will ignore these DOS drivers and use its own. If you're booting into exclusive DOS mode, these drivers will be there for MSCDEX to call. That's it in a nutshell. With this selup, I do have to reboot occasionally, but I've never had to use a boot clish.

"GAME DESIGN TECHNOLOGY Client vs. Host Processing Design Issues To Prevent Cheating In An Online Game by Alan Lenton CC The key question is, \"How much intelligence do we put into the player's software?' 72 e're now into the third month of development on our online game, EXPLORER, and so far we haven't programmed any of the actual play mechanics. Instead, our programmer is working on the software tools we need to set up the game's databases. These tools give us a kind of designer's workbench\" which is essential to sct up the game. Eventually they will be available to higher level players to add their game, because the design isn't completc. own quests Meanwhile, I have been doing some So when are we going to start program design work on the terminal program ming the game? Who are you, the pro (sometimes called front-end or client softducer? (Don't answer that.) It's a good ware). The key question is, \"How much question, but the truth is that if we start intelligence do we put into the player's programming loo soon, we'll waste a lot of software?\" Athomy question.

Two, sooner or later someone VIEW TO A SKILL Additional skill parameters mean more CPU work all around, will back the client software and more network traffic. and publish a chcat version. No matter how well we protect this code, someone will eventually hack it. There are ways around this problem. For example, we can check key parameters. If this was a naval simulation, we might determine whether the ship is turning through a right angle in one yard as opposed to accomplishing the same maneuver in one mile. Perhaps the host can act as referee so that if two front-ends disagrec, the host will decide which position is correct. We could also keep statistics. It's casy to spot the statistical changes hackers tend to make. Rarely do they change the stats for a 9mm rifle to a lOmm rifle; more likely they'll change it to an 88mm anti-tank gun! These kinds of results are going to stand out like a sore thumb in a supposedly normal distribution curve. \"The point is, though, that they all involve extra work in the host. This raises the question whether it's necessary for the client software to do this work if it must be duplicated in the host. The alternative, which we've adopted for EXPLORER, is to make the terminal just an intelligent display unit. The processing takes place in the host and the results are passed to the terminal for display. In this way, the processing power available in the player's computer will be used only to provide a display that can be customized to the player's requirements. This design tradeoff imposes some constraints, since there will be additional network traffic and some problems with packet re-synchronization. But since know about them at an early stage, the game can be designed so that these limitations do not affect it. & BEN 88 2 x CG JUNE 1996 "

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA  GAME DESIGN The Gamesters The Computer Game Developer's Conference: High-Brow Content And Low-Brow Schmoozing by Paul Schuytema s I sit here in the airport musing on my time spent Sitting in one session after another, couldn't escape the sense of dedication and commitment. The attendees seemed to care deeply about the quality of the game experience. Al programmers wrestle with the most effective methods to craft cunning wargame or NPC intelligence. Graphics programmers struggle with incredibly complex techniques to cke the most realism out of our machines. For annual Computer Game Developer' s Conference (CCDC), I can't help from thinking how lucky you, as game players, really arc. Sure, the conference was over-crowded and full of too much schmoozing to really create a blistering signal-to-noise ratio, but it showed one clear indication about the people who make the games you play: they love to do it and they take their art and craft very, very seriously. Came developers spend incredible amounts of energy on the problems of design, interactivity, graphics, sound, everything. Not one person I talked with at the conference was anything but a dedicated (almost maniacal) game creator. exchange ideas, from wargame design to the problems with WINDOWS 95. It is interesting to note that the \"WINDOWS 95 Debate» roundtable was far less of a debate than expected. Almost universally, all attendees had already acquiesced to the reality of WIN95 becoming tomorrow's game platform. Most of the action went on behind the scenes in a near-orgy level of professional shmoozing. HIGH CONTENT The point of the conference, more than anything else, was communication. It was a time for developers (that's every body who helps create games, from artists to musicians, programmers to writers) to come together and share the experience. Conference session subjects ranged from the value of violence in computer games to creating «moder Al\" genetic and neural network algorithms. HAVE YOUR PEOPLE CALL MY PEOPLE... HAVE 3-D, WILL TRAVEL Technology was displayed in three dimensions at the CGDC expo-almost every booth focused on Most of the some type of 3-D tool, from modeling packages to accelerator action at the chips. CCDC went on \"behind the scenes\" in a near orgy-level \"code hacks,\" the talk is of algorithms and of professional schmoozing Companies \"CPU budgets» (the percentage of CPU held suites in the hotel for impromptu processing power used for Al and painting interviews, book publishers stalked the images on the screen). bars, looking for the next great title for a The vast majority of a CGDC day was strategy guide. On Sunday night, many of filled with Icarning sessions. Some were the companies that held suites opened up non-technical in nature, while others their doors for a \"suite crawl.\" For hours, were nuts-and-bolts examinations of a the glassy-eyed developers could specific topic. Round tables (often the first schmooze and slurp over great games and to fill up) allowed participants to imported beer JUNE 1996 CG "


"PAUL SCHUYTEMA TECHNOLOGY The schmoozing, while frowned upon by some in the industry as some sort of incestual fertility dance, served the purpose that the CCDC itself once served. It was the time for everyone lo interact and Crawford Conference loss around ideas it didn't matter who you worked for or how long you'd been in the industry velcrans and newbies alike gathered to unwind and share tales and anecdotes and yes, even trade secrets. process, many hardware companies like Creative Labs, Intel and others, displayed the latest in 3-D acceleration technology. None of the chips that I saw were polished to perfection, but the time is soon when 3-D accelerators will be as essential as Sound Blaster compatible cards. (Watch for our first major feature on 3-D graphic accelerators in next month's issue. -Ed.) While some developers haven't yet jumped on the 3-D bandwagon, many are closely watching the field, trying to predict which, if any, will leap to the fore and become the de facto standard. Apple Computer was also there in force, heralding the launch of \"Game Sprockets,\" its new game technology SDK (software development kit), featuring 3-D sound, 3-D acceleration and speech recognition. It remains to be seen if this is too little, too late for the Macintosh gaming community. On an expo floor crowded with people, the large Apple booth was often barren. PROGRAMMER FOR HIRE, ANYBODY? While community and dedication to computer games was the cornerstone of this ycar's CCDC, another facet was equally important: the job search. CGDC is the place for an up-and-coming game developer to find the first job, or for a hot-shot programmer to land in the company with the largest coffers. In the long line to get into the opening reception, a gangly man stood, like a ticket scalper at a Grateful Dead show, with a hastily scrawled sign in blue magic marker: \"wanted, hot programmer, SIOOK/ycar.\" A job fair was the first stop for those with resume in hand. Dozens of companies, from Accolade to Virgin Interactive, all hung out their shingles and free peus and gawked at the parade of wannabe programmers, artists and producers. While the job fair was the most visible of meat markets, most of the action lell between the cracks, with wandering head hunters, company execs and hundreds of \"job opening\" fliers plastered everywhere. I spent not more than 15 seconds perusing the job bulletin board before I was accosted by two head-hunting search agencies. cach desiting to help me find my niche. When I turned to show them my CGW badge, they faltered for a moment, but continued their pitches. hris Crawford, the founder of the Computer Game Developer's Conference, has a problem with its huge growth and success. When the CGDC first came into being, it was held in Crawford's living room-an informal jam session of ideas and predictions. Over the past few years, the CGDC has become a large and successful conference, drawing in developers from all aspects of the game industry. For him, the deep level of interaction has become too diluted by the masses of attendees. This year, he decided to do something about it, so he created his own one-day conference. \"The predicating assumption behind this conference,\" said Crawford in the program, \"is my belief the conventional computer games and video games have reached a creative dead end, yet there remains so much potential to interactive entertainment.\" Hand-picking the 43 attendees, Crawford foot the bill for everything, asking only a few things from the attendees. Each of us attending had to submit a workshop idea. Crawford then picked 24 ideas for the one-hour workshops. You didn't know if you were running a workshop until you actually arrived. The day's topic was the \"future of interactive entertainment\" and the lively discussions ranged all over the spectrum. One workshop wrestled with the weighty subject of trying to quantify the moment of epiphany so often found in other art and so rarely found in computer games. Crawford explored the continuum between depiction (showing something on the screen as realistically as possible) and representation SELF-ADMITTED HAIRSHIRT (providing visual information Chris Crawford says that the through more abstract graphics, computer games industry is such as in comic books). This creatively dead. His day-long workshop was the most heated of conference, preceding CGDC the day, often erupting into declarations of wildly opposing viewpoints. explored the future of interactive Essentially, the group fell into two entertainment (not games). schools: those who preferred snazzier, more realistic graphics with less interaction and those who were willing to have less \"superrealism\" in the graphics but much more interaction. I suspect that the \"high content\" of the Crawford Conference was a little loftier than those early days in Crawford's living room-not because we have all grown smarter, but because we have all logged many years in the game industry, and we now have the wisdom of hindsight. Also, it certainly helps that technological limitations are falling away like dead skin, allowing for more pragmatic musings and explorations. ABRASH TALKS QUAKE Perhaps the most crowded session was Michael Abrashi's technical talk on how the QUAKE graphics engine works. Abrash, along with id legend John Carmack, have worked over the past year creating the most visibly stunning 3-D environment on the PC. Abrash described the many dead-ends he and Carmack encountered as they cobbled together the techniques that allow QUAKE to be both beautiful and fast. He said that they wanted the QUAKE engine to achieve the same level of a technological leap as Doom was over WOLFENSTEIN 3D. To do that, they had to struggle with the most abstract image processing problems, finally arriving at a hybrid engine which does the job. In the most itting reflection of the spirit of the conference, Abrash ended his talk with the simple iclca: \"We're just trying to make the world a little better. How much better would you have been if John and I patented these icleas instead of me coming up here and telling you how we did it?\" The crowd responded with a long thunder of applause. TECHNOLOGY OF TOMORROW In addition to the job fair, a small \"expo-like\" show was set up for the developers to peruse the latest development technology. The lion's share of the booths were dedicated to \"things 3-D.\" Many booths displayed their 3-D development wares, such as Martin Harcu's spline based 3-D modeling and animation program. Autodesk, makers of the ubiquitous 3D STUDIO showed off 3D MAX, their Windows NT upgrade of the defacto 3-D game standard. On the other side of the clevelopment JUNE 1996 "

Acts I&II are always exactly the samc in all the scenarios. You have the same conversations, solve the same puzzles, visit the same locations. Even Act III isn't all that different; the changes per Ripper, while significant, tend to be minimal. It's best to put this one aside after finishing, and relum to it sometime later, if you want a new culprit. The puzzles vary from the obscure to the obvious. The password (obtained in Act II) to decrypt Catherine's journal, for instance, is buried in a very unlikely spot, which has at best, only a minimal connection to lier (asking hier is not an option; she's an almost-victim and spends the game in a coma). I mention this one because reading the journal is the only way to open up certain things in Act II. You can casily become frustrated there when nothing new is happening or available. In this case, the password should have had a more visible relation to her. Mystery fans may not be happy with the motivation for the Ripper. In only one case is there really a sufficient motive; in the other three, it's rather glossed over.

"SCORPIA'S MAIL SCORPIA Scorpia Goes Gold ADVENTURE/RPG The Queen Of Crustaceans Comes To The Rescue For The 50th Time This is something of a momentous occasion-the 50th Mail column (Eek! It can't be that many, can it?). That's a lot of columns and a lot of mail-and a lot of years, but let's not count those (wink). Even after all this time, I still enjoy helping out gamers where I can. I get a kick out of hearing that someone was able to complete a game thanks to a hint I gave. But let's not get maudlin here (I have a reputation to maintain, after all). Besides, the mail sacks are waiting... ANVIL. OF DAWN: Most of the puzzles aren't too tough, but many adventurers tend to have trouble in the Barrier. Specifically, they're having a hard time getling out the other door. This requires sevcral steps. The first one is getting to the floor plates in the extreme four comers of the level. All of those have to be weighed down. Then there are some switches that have to be pulled, including along the exit corridor. After you've done all that, you'll be able to go on to bigger and better dungeons. DARK SEED II: One of the tricky situations in this game is determining who is Ik and who is Uk. This is easy to do, once you have all the necessary information. You need to speak to them first to start off. Then you have a little chat with the officer in the jail near the Hall of Justice, and follow that up with a conversation with the guard outside the house. That will give you everything you need to know to tell the twins apart correctly. DISCWORLD: Rincewind's adventure continues to give gamers fils (well, it is one of the harder games around these days). One section causing premature gray is gelting the broomstick back from Windlepoons in Act III. For this, you need something slinky, something stiffening, and a fertile imagination. Put them all together, and you'll be able to make the switch EYE OF THE BEHOLDER II: After a long hiatus, this one appears to be popular again (must have something to do with those shovelware multipacks. I leh). There are several tricky instances in the game, and one of them is the place with the sign that reads \"You must leave many things behind.\" Well, \"many\" doesn't mean \"all.\" and you don't need to put something on cvery floor plate, just on some of them. Think of it as marking the spot. GABRIEL KNIGHT 2: The end game in the basement can seem harder than it actually is if you don't realize that Cabe can shut the doors down there. Just trying to chase the werewolf around won't work; he'll get away every time. You must close off access to all the bolt holes before you go after him. Then, you have to work out the one right path to force him into the furnace room, I HAVE NO MOUTH: Ted's scenario isn't too difficult, except perhaps for discovering the location of the mirror.'The devil's hint is a trifle on the obscure side, and he isn't referring to the evil chapel (which would seem the likely spot). In this casc, you'll probably want to catch Scorpion's Mail up on your reading there's some hot stuff to check out. PRISONER OF Ice: Some folks have found the office safe to be a bit difficult to open up. They have half the combination, but the other part cludes them.

"REVIEW BAD MOJO DIFFICULTY LEVEL ADVENTURE/RPG Twilight of the Cockroach BAD Mojo Evokes Kafka So Well It'll Turn Your Stomach by Arinn Dembo 'll never forget the first sentence of The Metamorphosis.

"REVIEW JACK THE RIPPER DIFFICULTY LEVEL Reason & Rage ADVENTURE/RPG JACK THE RIPPER'S Century-Old Tale Still Serves Up A Saucy Mystery by Arinn Dembo hitechapel, 1888: putting together that name and date still gives us a shiver. This poor suburb of London, in the year 1888, was the epitome of everything that could go wrong in an industrial city and a modem age; if there has ever been a blacker hog's wallow of filth, addiction, prostitution and poverty, I haven't heard of it. The life blood of the city was cheap gin; in alleys full of garbage and running sewage, women sold their bodies for the price of a drink. The streets were lined with vermin-infested dormitories for the poor, work-houses for men and shabby cribs for women still young enough to carn the price of a room. Violence was so common that the cry of \"Rape!\" or \"Murder!\" wouldn't lift an eyebrow-the residents of Whitechapel were so wretched, that death no longer concerned them. But in the autumn of 1888, they rediscovered the value of human life. From the morning of August 31st to the night of November 9th, the borough was a lunting ground for the most famous scrial murderer of all time: Jack the Ripper LIGHT & SHADOW The stark graphic look is eerily appropriate, making you wonder where in foggy Victorian London the Ripper might strike next. Tack the MADU Price: $49.95 System Requirements: IBM compatible 386-33 or better, 4 MB RAM, 5 MB hard drive space. SVGA graphics, 2x CDROM, mouse; supports AdLib Sound Blaster, Gravis and Roland sound cards. Protection: None (CD must be in drive) Designer: Intergalactic Development, Inc Publisher: Gametek, Inc. North Miami Beach, FL (305) 935-3995 Reader Service #: 332 ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON JACK THE RIPPER is an old-fashioned murder mystery, in which you are cast as an unknown amateur investigator, working your way through the Whitechapel and Spitalfields boroughs of London during the Ripper's reign of terror, interviewing suspects, searching locations and gathering information. When a witness is interviewed or an object discovered, a text window appears on the screen. The goal of your interrogations and searches is to collect «premises»-blocks of text containing important facts and hints-from the written description of a person or an object. Once a premise has been discovcred, it is entered into a notebook. The key activity of the game is opening this notebook and trying to form two of these premises into a conclusion-a third premise that follows from the first two. Ultimately, you should have enough information to put together two premises, applying pure logic, and come up with the most important conclusion of all the identity of the Ripper. Success in the game is measured in points: you receive 85 for every clue found by searching a location; 75 for every premise copied into the notebook; and 225 for each conclusion; with a bonus of scveral thousand points, depending on difficulty level and how quickly you solve the mystery, for discovering the identity of the Ripper. Time is the most important factor in the game. You have a total of 17 hours to work cach day, and your investigation occurs only on the days when the Ripper has struck, giving you a total of 68 hours to uncover the Ripper's identity. If you haven't put two and two together by midnight on November 9th, you will be Jack the Ripper's final victim. The interface is very friendly and intuitive, as well as amazingly fast to use: it's mouse-driven, with multiple menus and windows of information, including the screen shot of your current location, sketches of suspects, witnesses, and physical evidence, and text windows. You can use the Search Location command, to search the entire area and uncover any evidence in plain sight, or left-click and drag open a box in a superimposed on smaller area of the screen, which can be scarched more quickly to expose hidden objects. To interrogate a witness, you select the Interrogate command, then click on the text of the interview, sentence by sentence, to find any premises it may contain. Double-clicking on a premise will enter it into your notebook, at which time it can be given a label to make the information easy to recover. Dragging premises from the notebook to the blackboard will clctcrmine whether any two premises lead to a conclusion. JACK THE RIPPER is a simple, elegant, CG JUNE 1996 "

"REVIEW. JACK THE RIPPER Frank Aberline, Oswald Allen, Inspector Beck, Georgo Cross, Mrs. Emma Green, Aaron Kosminska, Dr. Llewellyn, Patrick Mulshaw, PC John Neil, Dr. George B. Phillips and Mr. Walter Purkis are here. ADVENTURE/RPG or Difficult will make your investigator's virtual time pass more quickly.) There are five solutions to the game, with clifferent evidence planted to incriminate different suspects. The replay value of the game is limited by the number of solutions, but the software yields somewhere between 25 and 40 hours of play if you try to solve every scenario. And, as an added bonus, Intergalactic sive, and well-clirectedl; 72 human beings and 31 locations in Whitechapel and Spitalfields have been reproduced for this game, using photographs, line drawings, blueprints and sworn statements from 1888. It goes to show you that a design can always afford to be clever-and that simplicity can be a strength rather than a weakness. Not to say that there are no weaknesses in the game-there are only a limited number of conclusions that can be drawn from the available premises, and I found it HULLO, WHAT'S THIS? As you enter each crime scene, you are provided with a list of suspects, along with witnesses, newspaper items, police reports, and various clues. whitech Del Mortuary and intelligent game employing investigation techniques reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes-the use of pure reason and deductive logic to solve a crime. The player's inventory contains just the essential facts, and there are no ridiculous quests or contrived puzzles to solve. Gameplay moves fast; any single investigation will usually be resolved within six or seven hours of play, depending on the difficulty level. (Setting the game at Intermediate WHERE TO, GUV? This close-up of the navigation screen shows some of the famous locations accessible-by hansom cab, of course-as you travel across a pleasant period map of London. Horror: Precise & Stylish Development, Inc., the developers of this little gem, will send you a sixth solution on a 3.5\" disk for just $5! I found this gesture quite refreshing, in an industry where companies with far more resources are squeezing the consumer for every bloody clime. very hard to catch the Ripper if the game went beyond the third day-but all the basics have been nailed down. I was never bored, or so frustrated that I didn't want to keep trying. Even if I had to restart a scenario, I was always eager to continue and win. Essentially, this game is a modern evolution of the old text adventures, low budget but highly entertaining. If you'd like to try a game that tests your wils rather than your reflexes, you should give this one a try. Why are we still fascinated by the Ripper? Hard to say. The 20th century has certainly seen higher body counts; only five murders are officially attributed to Saucy Jack, whereas Ted Bundy once laid claim to more than two hundred. Jack's mutilations were spectacular in their precision, in the utter disregard for the humanity of his victims, but in comparison to the butchery and amateur taxidermy of a character like Edward Gein, let's face it-he was a bit of a piker. Of course, the Ripper was never caught...but neither was the Cleveland Torso Murderer, despite the efforts of one of the great lawmen of the twenties, Elliot Ness. If you analyze the particulars, there is very little in the Whitechapel murders that hasn't been done bigger and better by some more modern monster. If we are still interested in the Ripper, it comes down to something that cannot be measured objectively-that is, style! The Ripper created not just a mess, but a mystery; at bottom, there's always the burning desire to know how it was done. Why was there so little blood on the skin and clothing of Polly Nichols? How did he perform the spectacular double homicide of September 30th, killing two women in two separate neighborhoods in less than two hours? Were the police really baffled as to his identity-or was it all a cover-up? And above all: who was he? JACK THE RIPPER may not give you the definitive answers, but it's a gaming journey well worth taking. STRENGTH IN SIMPLICITY JACK THE RIPPER is a fine example of a good game with limited resources. There are no embarrassing voice actors or painfully bad dialogue. There are no primitive animation sequences, no terrible live action video clips, and no sliny, empty SVGA sprites which cover an intellectual vacuum. There are no pointless clepartures into old arcade clones, no mazes, no gambling, no Reversi puzzles. Instead, the system demands of this game are negligible, and its technical performance is absolutely flawless. While the graphics are low-tech, the black-andwhite drawings and grainy old photographs are atmospheric and pleasing. The wriling is good, and the research that produced this title was thorough, extenAPPEAL: Anyone who has ever wanted to know the true identity of Jack the Ripper will enjoy hunting him down using Sherlock Holmes-type methods. PROS: Smart, well-researched and well-written title which provides an immersive simulation of 1888 Whitechapel. CONS: No explosions, no shooting, no puzzles, no inventory-is this really a computer game? Fans of the latest computer technology may find this dated. CG JUNE 1996 "

Or the luscious, tunnel-crawling intro to CRUSADER: NO REMORSE? Remember wanting to play those games with the same graphics you found so delicious in their introduction sequences? Well, it never happened. Game intros do not look like the games that follow them. That is pretty much a hard and fast rule. There's the stylish rendered intro, and then there's...well, whatever the game may be, and the two are invariably different animals that don't share a bed. How, then, to explain TINE COMMANDO?It looks like an intro. It plays like a lustrous 3D platform game-cum-beat-em-up.

And not just a hit. Also a few wellplaced kicks, left jabs and roundhouse rights.

"REVIEW  DESCENT II NOTI)V DIFFICULTY LEVEL You're Going Down Interplay Serves Up A Second Helping Of Vertigo Stew by Paul C. Schuytema ast year, murmurs of Interplay's DESCENT hit the streets even before the shareware version, and nobody seemed too impressed. Already the gaming community had feasted upon a glut of Doom wannabes, and DESCENT seemed like nothing _new. In fact, Parallax Irad shopped their idea around to Apogee and id before Interplay bit. But once DESCENT hit the net, the 3-D bumouts had been rebom: here was something new and cool. Real 3-D, with six degrees of freedom and levels that looked like some sort of Escherian nightmare rather than a D&D graph paper dungcon. 97 LBEER 006 SHAFTED You're back in the mines and blasting robots because your employers exercised a little contract clause to get you to wipe out the last alien stronghold. FROM FLIPPERS TO FEET So this year, gamers have waited in anticipation for the sequel, DESCENT II. It is to DESCENT what Doom II was to Price: $44.95 DOOM: an evolutionary step rather than a System Requirements: revolutionary leap. Parallax has tweaked IBM compatible 486-50 the game in many important areas, but or better, 8 MB RAM, DESCENT's weaknesses still linger. 2x CD-ROM drive, VGA (with SVGA support), At it's heart, DESCENT II is a lot of fun. 25 MB hard drive You're zipping through strange and twisty space, DOS 5.0 or later; supports Sound mines, armed to the teeth with cool Blaster compatible weapons, blasting robots and gobbling up sound cards, Forte VFX powerups as you search for the throbbing 1.

Publisher: Interplay Irvine, CA Perhaps the most significant evolution (800)-INTERPLAY |ary upgrade in DESCENT II is the addition Reader Service #:334 of the guide-bot. This little flier is trapped near the beginning of each level. If you blast it free from its cell, it will gladly assist you in navigating through the twists and turns of the mines. The guide-bot is a great idea, since the lion's share of player frustration in the original came from becoming utterly lost in a large level. Because of the limited textures and lack of discemible objects within the mine, visual cues are few and far between, so wandering aimlessly was par for the course in the later DESCENT levels The guide-bot is an ingenious workaround. Not only does it help you navigate, but it also adds some excitement and surprises to the play experience. Some might argue that the guide-bot is a crutch, but I disagree. It is only concerned with one thing: finding its goal (you can tell the guide-bot what to seek: the next key, hostages, power center, reactor, whatever). Since it isn't the slightest bit sentient, it will gleefully lead you into a room crawling with robots, causing you to literally jump out of your seat. The guide-bot makes the play experience much more visceral, since there's no need to worry about the layout of the mine. Another advantage of the guide-bot is that if you see a robot snipe at you and take off, you can high-tail it after the pest for a rousing dog-fight with the knowledge that the bot will come gather you up and get you back on course again. Of course, for you hard-core sadists out there, you don't need to free your little friend. ROBOT BRAINS Another major problem in the original was the sheer lumbering stupidity of the alien-controlled robots. That's gone now, replaced with a bunch of silicon bad-asses who want nothing more that to lure you into trouble. Running across a solo robot in a corridor no longer means an easy kill. Now, the robot will take a shot and then JUNE 1996 "

While I have been a fan of the earlier immersive 3-D worlds by Looking Class Technologies (the Origin-published ULTIMA UNDERWORLD I & II and SYSTEM SHOCK), the ads for TN were so steeped in testosterone that I was afraid I was going to have to slog through yet another lobotomized, but pretty first-person shooter.

This relatively simple task, though, quickly becomes something far more epic and deadly-not only to you, but to all the Clans, who may lose their liberty permanently. The plot is recalcd by inter-mission scenes, competently acted out amidst nicely-rendered backdrops. Initially, the interaction between you and your squad is a little too dysfunctional and insubordinate to make me believe that I'm watching a military outfit. Moreover, the story immediately goes into the oldest of space-sim clichés: \"The Blatant Informer on Base.» Fortunately, the whole story doesn't hang on this hoary point alone, and TN skims away from the dark edge of tedium to cruise into the land of enjoyable melodrama. SUIT UP AND HEAD OUT! Of course, unless your game has the initials WC, most people are going to be more interested in your combat engine than your story line. When I first entered combat I thought I was merely looking at an upgraded ARMORED Fist, using Starship Troopers instead of tanks. At higher resolutions, the pixelated feeling fades quite a bit; but it's not until you get into the fourth or fifth campaign scenario that you realize the terrain is as much a part of the game as the weapons and suits. Players will find themselves sneaking through gullies, leaping up and off cliffs, and even shimmying along mountain tops in order to get the drop on enemy installations. This is the first combat sim since M-1 TANK PLATOON where I've found myself instinctively using the terrain to my advantage, instead of just looking at the map and figuring out where the designer wanted me to go.

"DENNIS MCCAULEY SPORTS compared to the higher profile products. While FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO 96 and Accolade's UNNECESSARY ROUCHNESS dominated the shelves at software retailers this past football scason, you'd only have stumbled upon ACTION PC FOOTBALL if you scanned the small ads in the back of sports magazines. How do the little guys do it? Perhaps they've found their niche in sports gaming-statistics. After all, table-top baseball games have been around since at least the early 60s, so they've had plenty of time to perfect their stat models. Camers know they're getting a reasonably accurate simulation of actual results, which is more than can be said for some of the graphics oriented sims, with their 4,000 yard rushers, all-too-frcquent l-O hockey scores, and home run hitters whose output regularly eclipses the best production of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. This is a real bone also appeal to upgrade refuseniks who can't or won't send their credit card on a fly pallem just to keep up with the latest full motion video, live announcer sports sim. Heck, many of the less-demanding stat-based games will run easily on even a 386, allowing sports junkies to get their numbers fix and still have a few dollars left to buy tickets to a real game once in a while. Stat-oriented sims have history on their side, too. When you purchase a STRATO. Matic or an APBA, you know you're buying into decades of sports simulation cxperience. Other games, like Lance Haffner's FULL COUNT BASEBALL, have a track record of several years to rely upon. There's a certain reassurance that comes from knowing a publisher depends on your purchase for his livelihood, and that the product will be there year after year, with updates, past season disks, and other game-related add-ons. With the bigger companies' sports products, you have to wonder whether your favorite sim will survive the annual sharcholders' meeting. Think it can't happen? Cuess again. In a recent example, MicroProse has cropped ULTIMATE FOOTBALL. like a slippery pigskin after just two seasons. Let's hope you didn't invest too much time in ULTIMATE FOOTBALL'S play book editor, designing a custom offense for a game that's now as defunct as the single wing For all their virtues, you have to wonder about the survivability factor of the statoriented sports sim in a gaming market where 3-D video is the latest buzz. To hold on against the big boys, small publishers must emphasize what they do best the little differences that set them apart from their corporate brethren. you do. Amazingly, some small companies don't even have an Internet address, much less a Web Page. Hello? This is 1996. guys! Perhaps even more frustrating, others have e-mail, but don't answer inquiries promptly, if at all. We've come to expect the impersonal treatment from the software bureaucracies, but from a little firm, the snub feels so much more personal. And, say, Mr. Small Company CEO, here's a question that you don't need a Harvard MBA to answer. What's better than one lonely customer playing a sports game solitaire? Why, 28 frenzied customers busily engaged in league play, of course. It's a surprising fact that many of the stat-based sims completely ignore the possibilities of the modem. With the oldline companies, this is probably because their customers have a 30-year history of organizing Play By Mail (PBM) leagues. Well, guess what? As a veteran of many PBM leagues in my dice and card days, I'm here to tell you that I'm not going to lick stamps anymore. I want direct modem play and I'm not the only one. Finally, small publishers should do what they do best, and not get caught up in on-screen gimmicks in a futile effort to compete with graphics-intensive games. The type of gamer who leans towards NHL 9 or TONY LARUSSA BASEBALL IS not going to switch to a stat-based sim just because it features an optional mouseactivated bat and ball graphic. Yet, in a questionable allocation of resources, one company is adding such a module to its '96 version. Professional athletes often use the term, \"Stay within yourself.\" It means play your own game, and don't try to be something you're not. Stat-based game companies should take heed. Make no mistake, this is a niche market. Small publishers ignore this fact at their own peril. It would be a shame -our loss as well as theirs-to eventually see the little fish in sports gaming gobbled up by a hungry school of officially-licensed, multimedia sports extravaganzas, too many of which tum out to be all icing and no cake & BACKFIELD IN MOTION UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS 96 may emulate the mechanics of a good running game, but for realism, you're still better off with an old-fashioned statbased football sim. of contention for the stat-oriented game publishers, who, quite naturally, see their type of product as the Holy Grail of sports gaming. One designer told CCWhe'd tried several times to shop luis baseball game's well-regarded statistics engine to major publishers as a means of giving their graphical sims a better foundation, but had been rebuffed. He came away with the impression that the larger companies believe that graphics are what sell. and most consumers don't really care about the underlying statistical precision. Could they be right? Text-based and stat-oriented games THE SMALL COMPANY PLAYBOOK Where can small companies make their mark? Customer service is paramount. Publishers must know the gamers who buy their product, and be responsive to their needs. I speak from personal experience when I say that, sadly, this isn't always the case. Some firms just don't get il, customer relations-wise. Do you have a modem? Do you use e-mail? Of course CG JUNE 1996 "

ON THE RADAR Spectrum HoloByte has finally lifted the cone of silence from FALCON 4.0. This Windows 95 F16C simulator drops you in the cockpit during an air and land war set in the Korean peninsula. Look for the sim to be the antiTop Gun, upping the realism ante significantly with over 10 radar modes, more than 10 HUD modes, and avionics support for Wild Weasel anti-radar missions. Look for AWACS coverage in combat, and much better team Al from your wingmen. FALCON 4.0 will support multiplayer play using networks, modems, direct cable connections, and online via the Total Entertainment Network (TEN). The sim will support 3-D graphics cards, so look for some amazing graphics. And taking a cue from BACK TO BAGHDAD, FALCON 4.0 will support hooking up an old Hercules graphics card and monitor to provide a second screen displaying your radar output. Spectrum's not giving dates yet, but you'll probably have more luck getting this sim from your valentine than from Santa. JUNE 1996 CG "


"DENNY ATKIN SIMULATION SPACE PATCHED PATCHES Last month I took a look at patches for some recent flight sims. Of course, as you'd cxpcct in the Mach 2 workl of flight sims, those patches have been patched. If you installed the EF-2000 2.0 patch. you're probably reading this magazine because interaction with your computer is liable to result in $3,000 worth of hardWare being tossed out a second-story window. When DID decided to make EF2000 more challenging, they overdid it Enemy missiles became super-effective, while your own couldn't hit the broad side of a fjord), DID recently followed up with another update, 2.01, which balances play quite a bit. We'll have 2.01 on next month's CG-ROM, or you can get it from http://www.did.com if you don't want to wait. In the meantime, practice on version 2.0, and 2.01 will seem like a picce of cake. SSI's Su-27 FLANKER has also seen more upgrades, up to 1.1 Beta 4 as of this writing. Along with clouds, a better field of view, fine-tuned instruments, and improvements in the mission editor, comes the Holy Grail: head-to-head play! The 1.1 update is designed to play over an IPX network. However, you can also fly over a modem connection if one player owns the Microsoft PLUS! add-on for Win 95, which contains the Dial-Up Networking (DUN) host application. One player installs the DUN host, and the other calls up. If everything's configured properly, you'll be able to play over a modem connect.

Up to eight players can fly over an IPX network, or you can go head-to-head using a modem or direct serial connection. You can fly any of the Single Missions or Quick Missions here. The Quick Mission interface sports a number of options to enhance multiplayer mode: You can set up a free-for-all battle, or divide players into two sides; time and kill limits are adjustable, as are the number of lives a player is allowed; and you can choose how many kills constitutes a win. Both missile and guns-only combat are allowed. The action is smooth as silk in multiplayer mode, with no warping or jumpiness at all in network play or over a 14,400 bps modem connection. What makes the multiplayer a real blast is that you can fly any aircraft in the sim. Set up a MiG-21 vs. F-4 Phantom battle, pit an A-10 against a Harrier, or take control of a lumbering C-5 Galaxy and see if your friends can escort you home alive. A total of 90 different aircraft (counting camouflage variations) are available, including bombers, fighters, helicopters, and transports Stripped of multiplayer mode, ATF is little more than another USNF data disk with a nice multimedia aircraft encyclo pedia. But once you take on a human player, the game takes on new life, and becomes one of the most purely fun flight simulator experiences in existence today. If you have a friend with ATF anda odem, you must buy this game. Otherwise, you might considering buying them a copy. And a modem, if need be. You won't regret it. m APPEAL: USNF fans looking for new action; anyone with an interest in multiplayer flight simulation. »PROS: The most entertaining, flyable multiplayer simulation yet.

"REVIEW SILENT THUNDER: A-10 TANK KILLER 2 DIFFICULTY LEVEL Silent Thud Under All The Pretty New Makeup, It's The Same Old A-10 SIMULATION/SPACE by Scott A. May Silent Thunder LEX | ct fighter sims can be a detached experience: Bogeys appear as blips on long-range radar screens, identified and dispatched with perfunctory case. Ground targets may offer visual sightings, but thanks to laserguided ornance, you can be long gone before impact occurs. In short, the fighter pilot is dislanced from the immediate action, in all its smoke and glory, like some veiled avenger. Sierra's SILENT THUNDER: A-10 TANK KILLER 2 drops you out of the clouds and right into the caldron of up-close and personal air combat. Nicknamed \"Warthog for its ungainly appearance, the A-10 Thunderbolt II is the modern equivalent to the fabled Trojan Horse-a lumbering giant capable of unleashing hell's fury on any ground target in its path. Designed to fly low, long and hard, the A-lo's major claim to fame is its tank killer\" capability, courtesy of the GAU-8A Avenger gun. Mounted beneath its nose conc, this massive seven-barreled Catling style weapon can fire milk bottle-sized 30mm shells at a blistering rate of up to 70 rounds per second. A split-second burst is all that's needed to reduce a main battle tank to a flaming pile of molten shreds. In many ways. it's like shooting fish in a barrel, except these fish arc armed to the gills and don't hesitate to fire back BOOM TOWN Follow the winding roads and you'll find plenty of targets of opportunity that blow up real good. such as Korca, Columbia and the Gull, weeding out terrorists, drug lords and the like. Another important shift: A-10s now fly mostly solitary missions, backed only by reconnaissance planes and the occasional Apache gunship. Combined with a new variety of locales -from flat desert to rugged mountain terrain and improved chemy Al, the skills required to command this formidable beast have changed dramatically since the carlier game. The game's visible improvement is a complete graphics facelift. The flat polygons of the past are still there, but they're now 3-D texture-mapped and light-source shaded, using Dynamix's updated 3Space technology. Thanks to SVCA resolution, the devil's in the details, including magnificcnt multicolored explosions, realistic smoke, fire and mist effects, highly delined buildings and aircraft markings. Terrain features such as roads, rivers and shorelines are not only pleasing to the eye, but important for navigation. Using a combination of hotkeys and mouse controls, you can view the action from virtually any angle. The graphics look best when viewed from a distance; up close it's the same old carpet of blocky polygons, and occasional glitches cause objects to be visible through terrain. The game uses Direct Draw, supporting cither a windowed display or full-screen, at a maximum of 640x480 resolution. An umattractive low-res option is available for slower machines. Price: $59.95 System Requirements: IBM compatible 486 DX266 or higher (Pentium recommended), 8 MB RAM (12 MB recommended).

Skill variables include three threat levels and adjustable realism (limited or unlimited ammunition, normal or invincible damage). A special training mission, with on-line verbal cockpit assistance, helps novices carn their wings. Due to the variety of mission objectives-essentially, anti-tank, air support or interdiction-and potential enemy resistance, the game places heavy emphasis on pre-flight weapons loadout. Beyond tanks mere cannon lodder for the AMANUAL: MIA Like some other recent Sierra games, SILENITHUNDER ships without a printed manual. All background material and syslem specs are instead contained in an online help document, accessible only from the main menu screen or through Win95's Explorer. On-line help may be fine for non-gaming applications, as a supplement to a printed manual, but it makes a poor substitute for having written refercncc matcrial at hand. You can print out desired information, but it's a hassle. Making the best of a bad situation, I'll admit there are some advantages to online hclp: hypertext jumps to related material, plus the ability to quickly search the manual for specific topics. This is one trend I hope doesn't catch on. As combat flight sims go, SILENT THUNDER doesn't exactly shake the rafters or add anything new to the genre, beyond its Win 95 platform. Veteran Warthog warriors will enjoy the game's graphic overhaul and new mission selection, but they'll likely be disappointed by the inattention to improvements in other areas. If you're an absolute flight sim beginner, or if you're looking for an arcade action adrenaline release and you're extra-willing to suspend disbelief, SILENT THUNDER may be worth a look. 10-you'll also be facing a diverse range of aircraft, anti-aircraft units, radar sites. boats, bridges, buildings and unarmed transports. Four pre-set weapons loads are available, based on mission briefings, or you can customize it yourself from a hefty list of bombs, rockets and missiles. Enemy Al is considerably juiced up from previous versions of the game, especially when set at the aggressive threat level. Play difficulty is also much greater, primarily due to your lone wolf status. Wingmen do appear in sclect missions, although communications is not an option. The HUD and cockpit displays are somewhat muddled, but since you're moving so low to the ground (typically 200 feet or less), you'll end up flying by sight most of the time. The game supports the usual collection of high-end analog flightsticks, throttles, and rudder pedals. For Windows 95, a digital joystick, such as Microsoft's Sidewindler, is the optimal way to go. Control response felt sluggish in the heat of battle; the flight model doesn't appear to have been upgraded at all from the ancient A-10 1.5. Flight characteristics that were acceptable seven years ago feel weird now. Acumbed-clown light model is acceptable, even appropriate, in a beginner's sim, but if you've learned how real planes respond to control inputs, vou'll likely have trouble handling the unresponsive A-10 in this game. The Secret Wor ILENT THUNDER'S archaic flight model has turned many experienced flight sim fans off. It's not that it's not deadly accurate-many sim fliers enjoy simpler games like USNF-it's that the plane just doesn't fly as an A-10 should. The real A-10 is a fairly nimble bird, while SILENT THUNDER's flies more like a B-52 hit by a shrinking ray. Turns and throttle control also don't feel right to experience fliers. Dynamix has heard the cries of sim fans, and is issuing a patch which should be available online by the time you read this. A second flight model will be added that's still not deadly accurate, but should fly much more like a real A-10. Also planned in this free update are fixes for sound and joystick problems, and a new eightmission mini-campaign called \"The Secret War.\" APPEAL: Action gamers looking for a starter flight sim; nostalgic players of the original A-10 games. PROS: Target-rich environment with spectacular explosions, stereo sound effects and much-improved graphics. CONS: Unrealistic-not just simplified-flight modeling and poor plane handling. No paper manual. Beyond updated appearance and more timely mission specs, gameplay isn't much different from original DOS and Amiga versions. CG JUNE 1996 "

There is a special pin these men wear, one which has not been awarded since WWII. That pin is the Submarine War Patrol pin, and it designates the wearer as a submarine combat veteran. These men went to war with boats of steel, and sank those boats on purpose in order to attack stealthily. Not only did they attack, but they paid the price by being attacked right back. They returned with an unmatched war record to a grateful nation. Unfortunately, the mortality rate for submariners of WWII was astronomical. There are many boats listed as \"Still on Patrol\" in the Pacific. One of the chief roles of the WW II submarine veterans who survived is to make sure that we, as a nation, remember their sacrifice. SSI'S SILENT HUNTERS attempts to refresh that memory by recreating the experiences of submariners in the Pacific theater during WWII. For authenticity's sake, SSI brought a distinguished WWII submariner on board as a technical advisor. LCDR William \"Bud\" Gruner joined the submarine service in 1939, and took command of the USS Skate during 1944. Gruner's involvement gave SSI the benefit of much real-life experience.

I set the realism at 100 percent, and landed in the control room of an S-class diesel boat. Once on board, I took a quick tour of the boat and checked out what she had to offer. I was pleased to find that all the controls, from inclinometers to engine order telegraphs, are accurately depicted. The compass rose is casy to discern, and making depth changes can be casily accomplished by setting depth manually or by one-keypress commands to come to periscope depth or radar depth, crash dive, blow main ballast, or surface. The chart is an absolute pleasure to use, allowing you to set navigational points quickly and easily. The zoom fcature is particularly handy, and is critical when setting up an attack. Orders can be sent to the ship's controls without leaving chart mode. The radar is accurately rendered; you'll find it extremely useful for locating targets and obtaining range information. Radar was one of the edges that allowed US submarines to operate so successfully, and was an early indicator of the need for advanced technology in weapon platforms. The bridge contains repcaters for the ship's control equipment, as well as a set of \"big cyes.\" Known as the TBT, or Target Bearing Transmitter, these extra-large binoculars allow surface engagement of targets by sending data to the Target Data Computer (IDC), much as is done with a periscope. For the artillery-inclined, there is a deck gun which can be fired manually or automatically. The TDC is the true gem of the control room. This device can be set to operate in automatic or manual mode. In automatic, the target information is automatically fed to the TDC.

"REVIEW  SILENT HUNTER SIMULATION/SPACE in the target solution is gained, a small gauge in the TDC mirrors the level of confidence. The target solution is ed into the weapon in the form of a gyro angle. In manual, all readings must be manually fed into the TDC. These readings are used to formulate a target solution, which is then fed to the weapon. The 'TDC is my favorite feature of SILENT HUNTER. I play the game with the TDC in manual wherever it's practical. When faced with multiple hostile targets. manual play is entirely too time consuming. Automatic mode allows you to maintain the big picture without acceding to TDC tunnel-vision. But I highly recommend that you become familiar with the TDC in manual, and use it whenever possible, in order to experience the full measure of the game. single mission, you'll find SILENT HUNTER presents a multitude of opportunities. There are numerous historic missions, where famous submarine actions are recreated, including those of advisor \"Bud\" Gruner. You can also set up encounters with merchant ships and warships, as well as patrol encounters. In these encounters, you'll be able to choose the size of the escort, presence of air cover, and a variety of other variables. Those who wish to undertake a longterm commitment to submarine service, lacking only the sleep-and sun-deprivation, can choose career mode. You'll chose a starting date, which affects the choices of technologies you'll be afforded. For instance, certain classes of submarine and certain types of equipment were not available until midway through the war. There are also realism settings which run the usual gamut of unlimited weapons and dud torpedoes, to visibility and vulncrability. The higher the reality level, the higher the score in a mission. tain range. When I circled the convoy, just out of gun range, nobody would break formation and give chase. I purposely stayed on the surface, firing the deck gun, and considering throwing rocks. However, in other missions the Al was dead-on. My final criticism is not of the actual game, but of the historical information therein. There are a number of interviews, but they're all of «Bud\" Gruner. While sincerely respect Mr. Gruner wholeheartedly as the hero he truly is, there are a lot of other stories to be told about the submarine war, and more than enough storytellers are still with us. The submarine fleet of World War II was staffed by many brave men, and I would have enjoyed hearing some of their firsthand accounts of the war. They will not be liere forever. The submarines that are still on patrol deserve a mention as well. As Dynamix and ACES OF THE DEEP did for the Uboat, I was hoping for more of the same from SSI. The US submarine force has paid particular attention to keeping its history intact. There are many submarine museums and archives, as well as oral historians and organizations like the SubVets of WWII. The resources are there, and 1 would have enjoyed seeing more of this type of information available in the game. \"That said, this game is well crafted, with superb simulation of the sub's equipment and posts. Its my hope that those who play the game and find it entertaining will seck out more information on the submarine force of WWII. The more you learn, the more amazed you will be at their exploits, and it will add a whole new dimension to your computer gaming. And maybe next Memorial Day you'll remember those that are still on patrol.\" PATROL ORDERS If you just want to sit down and play a 00531 TITANIE 03.1 NOVI ON REN LOCK TORPEDOS For a real challenge, try to operate the dead-accurate Target Data Computer during the heat of combat.

The SVGA graphics are extremely well rendered, Zooming in with the periscope or binoculars affords a high level of detail on the enemy ships. As the weather turns nasly, the boat pitches more and speed is affected, although the seas themselves remain graphically flat, a disappointment after the rolling waves of ACES OF THE Deer: Digitized voices give the correct replies to many common orders without adding any choppiness to the gameplay. I did find one problem with the Al in SILENT HUNTER. While playing a warship encounter, I was shooting at a battleship with three destroyers escorting. After launching all weapons and going deep, I figured the destroyers would be all over me. After a long wait, the destroyers were still on their merry way, despite the fact that I had just attacked the battleship. After being snubbed by the destroyers, I surfaced for a look around. After a little experimentation, I found that the destroyers would only fire their guns at me, and only when within a cer21960 100no APPEAL: ACES OF THE DEEP fans ready to play the good guy. »PROS: Dead-on simulations of sub systems and TDC, beautifully rendered SVGA graphics, a variety of exciting missions, and numerous difficulty leyels.

"REVIEW . FAST ATTACK DIVE SURFACE ENERIENCY SUPLACE MERGENCY DEEP SIMULATION SPACE a DOS program that's been set up to install and run under Win 95 using the AutoPlay CD feature. Unfortunately, game stability under Win 95 isn't as good as it should be, and even some DOS users have experienced crashes and lockups. PAST ATTACK doesn't play well with 32-bit sound cards; if your system has a Soundblaster AWE32, select the Soundblaster 16 during setup. A patch clisk is on the way, but the ability to save during missions would have been nice for those without the patch who experience lock-ups. PES infamous hotspots. The Career option places you in command of the USS Pittsburgh. The success and failure of your crew rides entirely on your shoulders as the boat transits from one hotspot to another. There are promotions and medals to be carned, as well as explanations to be made to Congress if you fail. It is here that the full measure of the game is pursued. Three difficulty levels are available. Easy level places sonar, lire control, and weapon reloading in the hands of the computer. Standard starts you with an approximate lire control solution, which you must refine. The Real level gives you full control of every facet of the game. Successfully completing a career in Real mode is quite an accomplishment. GARDE DEPTH OF PLAY You'll control depth and direction from this screen; quirky controls make evading incoming weapons a real challenge. WEE voices and animation), you'll choose whether to play a training mission, a battle set, or start a career. The training missions are challenging, and I heartily recommend that players start here. FAST ATTACK has a definite Icarning curve, and this curve can be climbed much faster if you follow the tutorial in the manual. There's a flow to successfully prosecuting a target, and it's important to learn this flow carly in your career. «Battle Sets\" are like being dropped into the middle of a war zone. Lach set has a number of missions, and if you're too chronologically challenged to commit to a virtual career, you'll enjoy these little journcys into some of the world's most Simple Realities laying FAST ATTACK at the Real level is challenging, since it forces you to do all the sonar listening, plotting, maneuvering, observing, and communicating. In reality, the closest simulation to actual submarining would be playing in Easy mode. Checking the information is important, but gathering and evaluating information is not the Officer of the Deck or Captain's iob. Their job is to make decisions and maintain the big picture, not dial in a possible solution. The actual tracking and prosecution of an enemy target takes a lot of people working together. The sonar team tracks the target and relays information to the tracking team. The diving officer and the helmsman/planesman handle the maneuvering. The chief of the watch compensates for trim and handles the bulk of communication. The fire control tracking team consists of a time-bearing plot, a geo plot, fire control, quartermasters (navigators), and timerange plot. The torpedo room loads the weapons and prepares them for either remote or local launch. Those not actually involved prepare for all possibilities. Information flow is the key to successful target prosecution. While everyone can be perfectly competent in their job, it is the team that accomplishes the mission.

The computer opponents are also quick to identify the predominant civilizalion in the game (usually yours) and gang up on it both militarily and diplomatically. More than once I had a substantial lead scratch. Several maps also come with the game, including smaller maps, such as Greece and the Mediterranean. More interestingly, cities and units may be added to custom maps, allowing for the creation of scenarios. Two come with the game (WWII and Ancient Rome) and others are already available on the internet. Still, the real heart of CIVILIZATION II is the development of a balanced empire, consisting of a strong military and an equally strong focus on economic and diplomatic matters. This is where Civ Il really excels. The challenge to the player is stronger than in CIVILIZATION, and the race to keep ahead tends to be competilive a lot longer than in the original. Is this the perfect game? My version ran without a hitch, although to save time I shut down many of the ancillary graphi cs, which have reportedly caused some crashes. Patches continue to be chumed out by MicroProse, so visit their web site at (http://www.microprose.com) The biggest problem for me was the lack of a multiplayer engine of any kind, particularly given that CIVNET is already up and functioning. Also, it's too bad the computer can't just concede defeat when you've amassed an insurmountable lead, so you don't have to slog through hours of uncompetitive play just to see the victory screen. Still, this is a minor quibble. On the whole, Civ II is a spectacularly addictive and time-consuming sequel worthy of its predecessor. I had to delete CIVILIZATION from my hard drive to fit this game on, and I suspect that Civ II will stay on my hard drive until (if) Civ III comes along. & Welcome To The War long with a new combat system, Civ II has many all-new units. Adding more unit types smoothes out the transition of your armed forces over time, provides interesting new capabilities, and generally makes military campaigns both more interesting and more challenging. Here are my favorite troops from each time period: WAR AND PEACE Diplomatic relations have also been expanded, as the computer now tracks your reputation. Stab your allies in the back and you may find few friends the next time you need help yourself. Along with a stronger defensive military system, reputation makes warmongering both more difficult and less rewarding, demanding a more balanced approach to expansion The designers have thoughtfully tweaked the economic system as well. In particular, new city improvements (harbors and offshore platforms) give coastal cities considerable economic power, especially in the long run. The changed economic system offers more rewards for careful city management and smart players will have settlers busy around their primary cities from the beginning Government properties have also changed. Fundamentalism is now available later in the game for fanatical expansionists, while Monarchy has been hecfed up to encourage economic growth carly on. Your type of government now also affects your ability to manipulate spending; only democratic governments have full control of the public purse, while less developed systems must work within predefined ranges. In addition to new twists on old ideas, Civ II also includes a number of completely new features. Players now have more input into the characteristics of the randomly created maps, and may also custom design their own world from Ancient Archers: a good multi-purpose unit. Elephants: expensive but pack a good punch Pikemen: the perfect defense against roving horsemen Crusaders: the heathen-basher's favorite weapon Industrial Revolution Dragoons: mobile horsemen Cavalry: packs the biggest punch for mid-game units Fanatics: Fundamentalist cannon fodder Galleon: with frigate allows separation of fighting and transportation Modern Stealth: both bombers and fighters available, best units in the game Paratroopers: can drop onto any square within range, including undefended enemy cities Alpine: tough, mobile infantry Cruise Missiles: one-shot expendable missile that packs a real punch, the perfect antidote to an aggressive computer AI. AEGIS Cruiser: defense doubled against air and missile attacks, crucial for the endgame. APPEAL: CIVILIZATION fans and megalomaniacs the world over must play this game. PROS: Highly addictive, makes original Civ even better, scads of replay value, different enough to warrant buying. CONS: No multiplayers mode; no way for computer to concede if you get way ahead early in the game. RATED A CG JUNE 1996 "

You portray one of four heroes-the noble Knight Marshal Calis, the Warlord Lord Marcas, the Archmage Krell, or the beautiful Sorceress Mordra-chosen by the Council of five to overthrow this tyrannical monarch. Like its illustrious predecessor, FC is a turn-based affair, where you wage a grand war against the computer, scenario by scenario. It's also the model for a perfect strategy game. It will appeal to hard-core wargamers with its incredibly tough AI and challenging scenarios. Light strategy gamers and newcomers to the genre will like its brisk pacing, reasonable learning curve and intuitive interface. Even fans of Dungeons o Dragons and Tolkien will find themselves entranced by the wonderful array of fantasy units: Wercbears, Fire Beetles, Undead Cavalry, a half-dozen clifferent types of Dragons. FG's core ROMMEL WOULD BE PROUD One of the best qualities of FANTASY GENERAL is its pacing. Much like PANZER GENERAL, the FG campaign starts out nice and easy, but once you've gotten the hang of things, begins to pour on the challenges. In the first of five continents, Keldonia, you only need to fight through three simple scenarios, with few enemy units, to defeat the ruling Orc King Dragga. It's a nice way of introducing newcomers to the game without overloading them with multiple units and strategies. You are in for a rude awakening in the second continent, however, the number of victory hexes increase dramatically, as do the quality of enemy troops and the aggressiveness of the computer opponent. FANTASY GENERAL has great Al, and it will go after your missile and siege units, concentrate on climinating your weakened troops, and sneak behind your lines to take your starting hex. In short, the computer employs the very same tactics a smart human player would if it were in the computer's shoes. The turn limits for cach scenario force you to push quickly towards your objectives, increasing the tension. You leam pretty quickly to prioritize your strategies, plan your moves in advance and also to not spread your forces too thin. What the smart Al, turn limits, and setup of the scenarios do is challenge you to think and CG JUNE 1996 "

Win the southern-most scenario here on the second continent, and Ferras will happily share with you the secrets of mech units. classes are available to you, but you can only recruit the first grade troops. To upgrade these troops, you must first research these new unit types by assigning them a percentage of the gold you win after each scenario. After enough money and time, you soon get a pop-up window telling you the new upgrade has been discovered. With the four different races, ten classes and five grades, not to mention dozens of individual heroes and villains, FANTASY GENERAL, provides a staggering 200+ units to play with. You can also add to this mix experience, which units gain from killing other units in combat. When they amass enough experience they gain a level (maximum: five expericnce levels), and they are granted increased armor and attack ratings. Just as you'd expect from a fantasy game, magic plays a part in the World of Acr. You have spellcaster units, which can cast one spell, though cach grade knows a different spell. In addition, all heroes except for Marcas have some form of spellcasting, though it's static. meaning the heroes can never leam new ones. There are also a plethora of magic items, plan intelligently, something other games, even good ones like COMMAND & CONQUER, don't do quite as well. And with each passing continent, the struggle only gets tougher. So what else is great about this game? Try a treasure trove of units. They are the game, since spells are so few and far between. I would have liked a magic system more akin to HEROES OF MICHT & MAGIC or MASTER OF MAGIC, where you could gain new spells and cast a variety of enchantments to heavily influence combat. Don't get me wrong, the magic in the game isn't bad, but I just wish it was more fleshed out \"The biggest nuisance, though, is the lack of scenario descriptions on the continent maps. When perusing the continental map to decide which of several scenarios to tackle, you don't know which path to choose because the only information you have on any of them is the name of the scenario location, like Scarlet Plain. It's colorful, but it doesn't tell you anything. Yes, once you click on a scenario, you get a description, but in FG, once you click on a scenario, you're committed to it. SSI should have allowed you to see the briefing before you commit to the scenario so that you could plot a strategy for traversing the continent, rather than just pointing randomly and clicking But these two faults are only minor details. As a whole, this game is easily the equal of its esteemed predecessor; and I even think the fantasy angle makes it more appealing. When you add up all the great features, like the Al, the number of units and scenarios, and the challenge; you get a game that is a near-perfect foray into the magical realm of strategy wargaming.

"REVIEW COMMAND & CONQUER: COVERT OPERATIONS STRATEGY / WARGAMES Getting Aleg Up o help keep frustration at bay as you leap into these self-proclaimed \"hyper-hard\" missions, here are some tips and insights into the first mission for either side. In general, players should defend their bases in a full 360 degrees in order to stave off sneak attacks, even having your back against a cliff isn't enough anymore. Wise commanders will sprinkle mini-gunners throughout their bases. Also, given the intense money requirements of sophisticated defenses, players should build a second harvester as quickly as possible; the investment will pay off quickly. Those with access to CGW back-issues or the Internet, would also do well to check out the first C&C strategy guide in our February issue, and the second part on our Web site, as lessons leamed there are doubly-important in COVERT Ops where any advantage is as good as oxygen. istC ON GUNE GDI Mission 1-Blackout ollowing the road to the NOD powerplants is pretty easy for your pair of commandos, just be careful to watch out for the angry NOD troopers who will emerge from the wreckage. Once you destroy the powerplants and deprive the deadly NOD Obelisks of power, your construction vehicle will appear. Drive it around to set up shop just north of the NOD installation you just demolished. While you go through the initial base setup, you must quickly send your commandos to blow-up the Obelisks SW of your base and their guard turrets before the NOD commander rebuilds enough power plants to get them back on line and ruin your whole day. After this, build a trio of BazookaMen to take out the cliffside turrets that your commandos cannot reach. Without this maneuver, your precious harvester will get shot up as soon as it begins to wander east. As I've mentioned, defense is your biggest construction priority, and you will come to rely heavily on the Guard Tower/Advanced Guard Tower combo to buy you enough time to build the Advanced Communication array and defend your base. If you can beat back the nearly constant NOD attacks, you can then use your basic skills to crack the very hard NOD base to your North. It won't be too difficult, just long. CAPTAIN COMMANDO Use your two commandos to eliminate the plants that power the NOD Obelisks, and then build your base here, north of that site. NOD Mission #1—Bad Neighborhood FELLETT pretty basic base fight here, but daring commanders will ignore the first Tiberium patch they see (as it dries out very quickly and is a far drive from the bigger patches), and drive their construction vehicle NE just south of a bridge that links to rich Tiberium fields. (Be careful not to stray west initially, as there is a GDI Mammoth lurking in the shadows.) If you set up here, block the small gap between cliffs directly to the NE and watch the GDI harvesters burn. Back it up with a Laser Tower as quickly as possible. If you are short on cash and have a couple of rocket bikes sitting around, drive them to the upper NE corner of the board behind the NOD base and blast a hole in the fence you find there. One bike should survive long enough to get through and grab the cash crate waiting there. PILLAGE AND PLUNDER If you need cash, use your rocket bikes to blow a hole in the northeastern fence and then enter to grab a stash of cash. up and thank Westwood for giving it to you at a fair price while they work on really expanding things. before your first foundation dries. The computer is now very fond of dropping off engineers behind your base by chopper, and you can count on this air-dropped gift at least twice a battle. The only drawback I found to these new tough missions was that most of the fun came in the carly stages. The trick is to survive long enough to establish your defenses: once that is done, you basically have an hour-and-a-half exercise in attrition and base-busting merit investing even more money into this game?\" I think the answer for COMMAND & CONQUER fans is a definite yes. Along with the missions, you get 10 new multiplayer maps, giving the game longer legs for us social-gaming types, although it's unfortunate that computer players in multi-player games still refuse to build bases, a flawl was hoping this disk might correct. The final benefit to gamers is that this disk comes with the latest, debugged version of the C&C program, and what was a pretty smooth game now runs even smoothier The lack of anything really new here as far as gameplay means COVERT OPS is definitely in the quick fix category, so if you just gotta have more C&C, then step APPEAL: COMMAND & CONQUER nuts itching for more missions and multiplayer maps will definitely want to play COVERT OPS. >PROS: New missions worth 40+ hours to the average gamer, with scenarios that are challenging without being \"puzzles.\" CONS: Gamers looking for anything new will have to wait. Pretty much reserved for those who can't get enough of a good thing. DECLASSIFIED OBSERVATIONS The real question with any add-on disk has got to be, \"Is there enough here to CG JUNE 1996 "

"HALL OF FAME W elcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. WING COMMANDER Origin, 1990 HIGHLIGHTS WING COMMANDER II Origin, 1991 WING= comidas DRYCH he original WING COMMANDER had little pretense of being a \"space simulation.\" Action lovers, though, could have hardly asked for a more streamlined space shoot-'em-up than Chris Roberts' original design in the series. While any attempt at a flight model in space would have been ridiculed, the game's engine pushed the hardware of the time by offering smoother performance than many more realistic polygon-filled flight sims. When you threw in the beautifully-rendered bitmap overlays at the time beyond anything else on the market-the game's visceral appeal was enough to win over even the most die-hard simulation addicts And what action! The WC universe was fast-paced, and so internally consis. tent that it allowed you to shoot anything-even your fellow pilots or your mother ship! The now-familiar \"branching plot tree\" was introduced here by Origin, adding depth and elements of adventure to the intense joystick action of the combat sequences. The \"hot washup\" scenes, winding down in the bar of the Carrier Tiger's Claw, discussing Kilrathi tactics and the progress of the war, seem corny now. But at the time of the game's release, they offered a welcome respite between frantic missions, and did a good job of portraying your shipmates as something other than Al loops. As the production values rise with each new WING COMMANDER release, it would be easy to dismiss the original as outdated. Quaint though it might seem to those weaned on fast 486s, however, WING COMMANDER is still a model of how to take a vision and develop it into a virtually seamless and purely enjoyable game. Would that more high-tech games today could remember that simple approach. ow do you follow one of the most suc cessful computer games of all time? If you're Origin, you do it with a highpowered sequel that manages to surpass the original. Chris Roberts' dream had always been to bring intense dogfighting space sequences of his favorile sci-fi movies to the computer screen. And while Roberts' cinematic aspirations wouldn't reach fruition until WING COMMANDERS III and IV, the seeds were definitely sown in WING COMMANDER II. The strong script found Origin's writers at their peak. The characters are more well-rounded than those of WC I: Spirit's calm demeanor and acceptance of duty, for example, actually make you believe in her \"warrior's code\" of honor. Other supporting characters are by turns arrogant, demanding, confused, even vulnerable. It wasn't Faust, but the story was darker and deeper than before, adding to the sense of grand galactic battle-especially since we were able to glimpse the Kilrathi behind-the-scenes, and find out that they were as quirky, insecure and arrogant as the spacefaring humans. Although it is rare to find sequels in our Hall of Fame, WING COMMANDER || deserves the honor, if only because it did everything the original did, with a more confident touch. The wrist-wracking action of the original was even more wrist-wracking. The enemy pilots were improved (but still somewhat predictable compared to modern sims). The sound effects were so well done that they inspired many gamers to try their first sound card; arguably, this is the \"killer application\" that helped to put Sound Blaster on the map.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what wo What's The Deal With...Sequels? The last evolution in the series that really couldn't have been covered with a cheap expansion disk was the jump from HARDBALL 2 to 3. They are up to ost people would pre. fer to spend their money on more of what they know they like, rather than risk it on an unknown quantity. It's this foible of human nature that makes the sequel such a powerful marketing force, in movies, in books, and even our beloved computer games. The way I see it, game sequels come in three categories: EVES (Evolutionary forms); MOTS, (More Of The Same); and FRAMS (Franchise Milkers). EVEs are the strength of main stream computer gaming, where the flexibility of programming code allows the expensive breakthrough work done on a game to become part of a \"toolbox\" to build the sequel. Games like Civ2, COMMAND & CONQUER or the WING COMMANDER series offer greater depth and complexity while keeping the qualities that made the predeces. sor a classic. Each successful install. ment allows designers more money and freedom for the next incarnation; this is never a bad thing. Some EVES, though, are so radical that they scarcely resemble the original game, and are more the designer's attempt to \"Get it right,\" as in the latest install ment of UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. I'm more ambivalent about the MOTS-games like DOOM 2 or XCOM 2-quick follow-ups to immense. ly popular games that cash in on suc cess and give gamers more of what they are screaming for. Yes, I enjoyed the previously mentioned games, but I can't deny that there was a real strong \"been there, done that feel to the pro. ceedings. This might have been reduced had the price tag been smaller-say, in an \"Expansion Disk\" for mat-where the company was honest and said, \"The designers have noth ing new to say right now. But if you're hungry for more, here's some more levels at a discount to tide you over until we're ready to really blow you away again.\" Expansions like GHOST BEAR LEGACY for MECHWARRIOR 2, or COVERT Ops for COMMAND & CONQUER, are perfect examples of how companies can quickly cash in on the public's high demand for a game without soaking us for the full price of a \"new\" game. A deeper problem with MOTS is h ow dangerous they can be to a series. Often, designers are so desperate to cater to us quickly that they forget what the audience is really after. Those of us with long enough memories may recall the disastrous \"origi. nal\" sequel to DUNGEON Master, back in the Amiga/Atari ST days. It was a case of picking the wrong \"same\" to make more of-when \"more challenging\" translates to \"tedious and inane,\" a popular franchise can spoil pretty fast. One could argue that FRAMs are a subset of MOTS, but these endless. unnecessary sports sequels really get on my nerves! Do we really need a new HARDBALL game every few weeks? ( Gamers should only pay full price when there is a whole new game-unfortunately, software companies rarely lagree. 77 has won CGW's Best Sports Game award for the last three years running, and with good reason; but come on, it's pretty much the same game every bloody year! Here's an idea for you profit-crazed kids at Sierra: give it a rest, put out an expansion disk with the '96/97 roster and a few tweaks on it for $30, and then spend a year creating a sequel that actually justifies its own existence! Wouldn't everybody be happier to hear a consumer 20 months down the line saying, \"Yeah, really liked FPS: FOOTBALL 96 but '98 blows it completely away!\" instead of \"What a gyp! I just paid $60 for a game I already have!\" Of course, the only reason FRAMS and MOTS exist is that they get bought in droves, and expansion disks don't have the same profit curve. Companies that re-invest in creating evolutionary sequels to their winning designs aren't doing that much better than the ones who churn out the same old thing, and until they do, 1 imagine things will keep going along they way they have been. Still, cookie-cutter software bugs me...even when it's a cookie flavor like. 5 now, with no visible improvements other than getting prettier. Even solid games like FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL are falling prey to publishing entire \"new\" versions year after year.
