"WHY IS DUKE NUKEM 3D THE BEST? Even running in super crisp 800x600 SVGA it blasts along faster than every other comparable 3D PC title. It's not pure speed at the expense of versatility either it is possible to look up, down, or sideways at any time, with the bitmapped scenery undergoing minimal deformation and no speed loss whatsoever. The engine also caters for full interaction, so bullets leave pock marks on walls, enemy's blood drips down crates and earthquakes cause huge sections to shift altogether, thereby granting access to new locations. It all contributes to the feeling of being encased within a grim world as opposed to wandering through impregnable, static corridors. The effect is hugely rewarding and is surely the direction in which such games should be heading. Computer Player PC Entertainmen \"A perfect 10!\" -Out of 5 stars\" This potential has luckily been exploited too. So often games fail to capitalize on excellent technologies but each of Duke Nukem's levels are noticeably different, being packed with huge ramps, drops, lifts, jumps and cunningly hidden secret areas.

"JUST THE FAQS strategy games, these recreate his torical conflicts from a command perspective. They may be tactical, operational, or strategic, and stress anything from logistics and firepower to morale and leadership. They may be simple (PANZER GENERAL, EMPIRE II) to incredibly detailed and complex (PACIFIC WAR). How Do We Classify Games? Action/Arcade (AC): The emphasis is on hand-eye coordina tion and reflexes, usually emphasiz. ing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure (AD): Games where in you control an alter ego and move through a storyline or sequence of events, where puzzle. solving takes precedence over conversation and combat. Classics/Puzzles (CP): Classics are old stand-bys and parlor games that appeal to many different types of gamer. Examples include: backgammon, bridge, chess, MONOPOLY, parchesi, Risk, and SOLITAIRE. Puzzle games are computer games which emphasize spatial relationships, word games and/or problem-solving without requiring gamers to follow a story line. Examples would be: SHANGHAI, TETRIS and Zig-ZAG. Role-Playing (RP): RPGs are a subset of adventure games, but stress character development, often through improving stats or other attributes. Conversations with nonplayer characters (NPCs) and tactical combat are generally more important than in Adventure games. Finally, the game world tends to be large, and the plot less linear, often with some quests/treks outside the main storyline. Simulations (SI): Highly realistic games from a first-person perspective: you may drive a real istically simulated race car, fly a military aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed sci-fi environment. Usually polygon-filled technology is used to build the simulated world on the fly. Sports (SP): The sports game category is a broad genre which includes action (NBA Live) and strategy games (FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO) based on sports. Strategy (ST): Problem-solving, short and long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X.COM, OUTPOST, MOO), as well as \"pure\" strategy games and \"software toys\" such as SIMCITY. Wargames (WG): A subset of What Is Your Reviews Policy? 1) We only review from the final copy of the game. Though it has become popular among PC gaming magazines to review from late beta copies, we feel that the reader is best served by having the reviewer look at the same copy of a game that the readers will find on the shelves. While we recognize that this causes some delay in coverage, we believe the reader is better served by such caution. 2) We expect our reviewers to finish the game. We want our readers to be assured that we do not review based on immediate or early impressions of a game. Our reviewers give a game ample opportunity to show its quality. In some cases, bugs make it impossible to finish a game, but we identify situations where that has occurred. 3) We make every effort to match the reviewer to the game. We take into consideration the preferences, background and possible biases of the reviewer and, where possible, We find people with actual life expe. rience or special backgrounds that match a game. We believe this policy enhances both the credibility of the review and the enjoyment of gameplay when the real world and the game world are competently compared. 4) We do not accept free travel from software or hardware companies. We believe such gifts have a tacit assumption of coverage attached to them. We will only cover such events/launches as we believe will benefit our readers. HOW DO WE RATE? Outstanding: Very Good: A Average: A The rare game high-quality game mixed bag. Can that gets it all that succeeds in be a game that right. The graph many areas.

"JOHNNY WILSON edi.toulay The Top expre 100 Gets Anon Upgrade The Best Game Ranking System Gets Better e've always known that the Top 100 Poll and the Playing Lately lists were important to you. That's what you tell us in letters and surveys and that's what people in the computer game industry tell us. It's often the first page in a new issue that they will check out. It's also been relatively unique. Many magazines (including ours) provide ratings where the editorial staff makes qualitative judgments of the relative values of games and many provide lists of bestsellers, but our Top 100 is a list of the curulative, qualitative judgments of hundreds of readers-the best gamers in the world. Combined with Playing Lately, a list of what our readers are actually playing during the month surveyed, CGW offers two different ways to glean game recommendations from our readership. Playing Lately indicates what games are hot, right now. The Top 100 gives a value judgment that reflects a game's value over the course of months and years. Playing Lately offers the most timely recommendations we can provide from our readers, and the Top 100 tells which games are passing the test of time. Realizing that gamers often use these lists to make buying decisions, and that many publishers have factored in our Top 100 list when deciding whether to publish certain games, we have always wanted these lists to be the best they could possibly be. In 1989, for example, we changed the system. We noticed that more and more games didn't fit into our two-genre classification system. At that time, we classified games as either Action/Adventure or Strategy/Wargames. Where do you put simulation games in that system? Not only was the classifica tion system weak, but there was so much historical weight in the top scores that newly rated games couldn't budge them-even if they were blockbusters. Worst of all, we thought, was the fact that we published numbers that seemed to promise more exactitude than they actually provided. For example, what was the difference between CARRIER FORCE (7.04), DECISION IN THE DESERT (7.03). EUROPE ABLAZE (7.01) and SEVEN CITIES OF GOLD (7.00)? When  (C TO obtain more reliable game rankings, we're mailing nearly 2,000 questionnaires each month to our subthe meaning of 11 in a 12-point system. He told us that as long as we were accumulating data in order to get historical weight and trends in the ratings, we would have to move the highest rated games into the Hall of Fame and purge the rest after two years to make room for new titles. We were also painfully aware of another problem affecting both the pre-1989 and post-1989 systems-self-selecting respondents. Until this month, all you had to do to rate a game was fill out the prepaid postcard bound into the magazine each month. This allowed three major forms of contamination into the data: 1. The same people could rate the same game multiple times over several months-raising the number of responses, but giving greater weight to the individuals who responded every month. 2. The most vocal and fanatic minorities were the most likely to rate games every month and as a result could force higher ratings for games that had limited appeal outside their niche. Many a CEO's head has been shaken at the high LARREN CARRIER FORCE was rated by 108 gamers and DECISION IN THE DESERT by 35, it could be a considerable difference. We had an expert in statistics look at our process, and he advised us to move to a letter grade system to get the data to fall into natural groupings. He suggest ed that people understood better what an A meant in a system that ranged from F to A+ than they did SEPTEMBER 1996 "

Software companies could respond en masse and stack the deck. (It may be wrong to mention Accolade, Epyx and MicroProse as companies who attempted to cheat, but we're in one of those \"tell-all\" moods.) Fortunately, we did regular postmark checks in response to this problem, and we caught a lot of those attempts, but surely not all.

Wright CC Accolade, Epyx and MicroProse all tried to stack the Top 100 in their favor at one time or another. readers, we have continued to use the more expensive approach to create the list in the magazine. Now, however, we have changed the system again. Too many people didn't understand how we went from their letter grade ratings to a numerical presentation in the Top 100 list. So, we've gone to a straight 10-point system (think of it as your version of our 5-star sys tem, including the half stars), and we've done something about the self-selection problem! We now mail almost 2,000 questionaires per month to our subscribers. These are random, nth name mailings. This means that we are getting valid responses from different subscribers each month, and we believe this system will take care of the contamination described above. It also gives extra value to our more than 100,000 subscribers. Now you must be a subscriber to be eligible to rate the games. Playing Lately is handled on the same questionnaire The only potential downside is that when you shift methodologies and are working with cumulative data like this, the initial data may be fairly volatile. The early results bore that out, with a number of titles that rated surprisingly high for one reason or another. However, the benefit of cumulative responses is that you should see predictable track records as time goes on. We'll watch with interest, and we hope you will do so as well. You're still getting valuable recommendations from the best gamers in the country-there's just less noise in the translation now. It's yet another example of how we're trying to serve our readers better. We hope you'll agree that this makes one of CGW's classic features even more valuable.

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH an exaggeration to say that type of ammunition and point of impact for artillery fire can be changed seconds before a barrage arrives. The apparent ability to do this in TACOPs is an abstraction that is explained on page 106 of the User's Guide. In short, the TACOPs artillery implementation is effect oriented rather than procedure oriented. Abstractions in TACOPs, like those mentioned above, and its less than state-of-the-art sounds and graphics were not oversights in design. Thiese things were done intentionally so that the game would perform well under the Windows 3.lx operating system on computers dating back to the 386. I. L. Holdridge Developer of TACOPS ARSENAL MOUNTS A TACTICAL DEFENSE I have been invited to comment on the review of TACOrs (Windows) in the August issue of Computer Gaming World (page 186). I do not agree with the article's statements that TACOPs is a \"dud\" and a \"mediocre simulation.\" Other than that, I consider the review to be technically accurate except for two minor errors in interpretation and some exaggeration. It was an error for the article to state that vehicles in TACOPs fire antitank guided missiles (ATGM) with great accuracy while moving at full speed. Movement and combat in TACOPS is abstracted into pulses that represent 15 seconds of scale activity. If an ATCM can reach its target in less than 15 seconds, the game engine reduces the forward movement potential of the firer to reflect the time lost to its conceptually executing a short halt before firing. If an ATGM will require more than 15 seconds to reach its target, the game engine holds the firer in place until the ATGM impacts. It was an enor for the article to state that the time required to reload ATGM launchers is not taken into account. In TacOps, single-shot ATCM launchers have a reload time that varies from 30 and 75 seconds. Plus there is sometimes another 15 to 30 seconds of delay attributable to target acquisition costs. The ATGM launcher on the Bradley, on the M9011TV, and on the LAV25AT holds two missiles. The second missile can be fired as soon as the first hits, but once the second round is fired there will be a reloading delay of at least 75 seconds. It was an exaggeration to say that TacOps makes no attempt to model morale or command, control and communications (C3). TACOps does not model varying levels of these factors, but it does model a situation of optimum training, morale, and C3. It was also Thanks for the clurification. It's always interesting to look at the players/reviewer's perception in relation to the designer's intent and model. Since most calculations in a computer game are handled invisibly, we sometimes think certain factors are ignored or overabstracted. Thanks for the assurances on your design As for the \"dud\" issue, we plead guilty. We try to write headline copy that will draw readers into an article, but in this case the deck misinformed. In terms of design and gameplay, TACOPs is certainly not a dud. Graphically, it is considerably behind the times, for precisely the reasons you just discussed. Some readers have pointed out that we gave the Macintosh version of TacOps a higher score than the Windows version. That's because, after the delay, we were expecting more, so the PC version rated lower. For either version, however, the term \"dud\" was, at best, an overstatement. Patrick Miller should not be blamed for wordplay injected into the article by the editorial staff. We often rewrite the headlines for the articles und, this time, we hurt the article instead of strengthening it. WIN95 AND THE NETWORK GAMER Am I the only person who thinks Windows 95 is the most counterintuitive, buggiest, pickiest, horrible excuse for an operating system ever invented? I'm beginning to suspect a plot of silence that is keeping people from talking about the utterly unworkable Win95, and am wondering if dissenters are being quietly disappeared by Microsoft goons in dark sunglasses and black trenchcoats. Let me say that the only reason 1 am faced with the nightmare of using Win95 is because I am addicted to PC games and everyone is saying that this is the future of PC gaming (please, dear God, let them be wrong). I am so addicted to PC games that I have, in my home, four Pentium 166 decked out ultimate gaming machines simply for playing multiplayer games. I don't use them for business, word processing, spreadsheeting, calculating or keeping my budget. Games, games, games. I keep my systems up-to-date and spend way too much money on games each month. I buy almost exclusively network-multiplayer games as I can find few games worth playing on my own. I know I have a problem and that's half the battle, right? I have owned PCs for the last eight years and have had to deal with all the frustrations [of] getting games to work with DOS. I have been working in the computer graphics industry for three years now and am a senior animator on the CGI television series Reboot. I work everday with Unix, Mac and PC operating systems. I have had to get all sorts of games to network properly on my home system. All this adds up to a fairly computer-literate person who is probably above-average in the amount of computer experience most people have had in their lives. AND I CANT GETA SINGLE SEPTEMBER 1996 "

"LETTERS BOTTICE MATINER GAMES Full Full Count D til Hege BASEBALL # COURTSIDE College BLOODY THING ABOUT WIN95 TO WORK PROPERLY!!!!! I just want to play games. Network games. I can't even get Win95 to install on one of my computers (it installed fine on two of them and all four are exactly them same). I can't get a Microsoft game (CLOSE COMBAT) to network with the TCP/IP protocol it demands (or anything else). I spent six hours this last weekend trying to figure out TCP/IP settings and adresses (options for which are spread throughout so many dialogue boxes as to nearly drive me switch my modeming over to Win95. Doesn't work worth a damn. I got detailed instructions (which are about eight times as long and complicated as setup instructions for Win 3.11) and installation disks from my Internet provider and followed them carefully. It still doesn't work, even slightly. My hardware dealer is a wellrespected supplier of Comtex computers, one of the best PC sellers in Canada. He specializes in network systems. He and I are still trying to work out my problems (we have been for the last nine months when I upgraded from 486s). This operating system is supposed to be the easiest, most intuitive point-andclick intercial feature on how to set up a multiplayer gaming nelwork and get nine of the best games rumning on it. It probably won't solve all your problems, but we hope it will help make things casier. think the Haffner games offer the best value in strategy-based gaming today. You can play the games very quickly and you don't need a lot of horsepower. It's almost refreshing in a way Anyhow, thanks again for the coverage. It's good to know I'm not the only out there, and hopefully this will help spur more coverage of this type of product. Rick Rosinski Freeland, MI created and mass-marketed by an evil, bloated software corporation. 1 don't understand how anyone (let alone the average, barely computer literate family) can get anything at all out of Win95. I am baffled. Utterly. I am scared when I hear of all the hype about Win95 being the future of gaming when from my painful experience so far it has failed miserably on all counts. Zeke Norton zeke@reboot.com Senior Animator, BLT Productions Vancouver BC, CANADA TO HAFFNER AND TO HOLD . I've been a subscriber to Computer Gaming World for about 10 years. I read it cover to cover every month (and) I respect your opinions and reviews very much. I've watched you follow the trends of gaming from Apple and Commodore, Amiga and Atari ST, to Mac and IBM. I have owned a Commodore 128; Amiga 500,2000 and 1200; and various IBM compatibles from 286 to Pentium. I appreciate your coverage in the July 1996 issue of the Lance Haffner sports games. I have been using FULL COUNT BASEBALL since my Commodore days and thoroughly enjoy it. I started my strategy baseball gaming on Avalon Hill's STATIS PRO BASEBALL by playing the board game. When I saw the computer version of that, I had to have it and went out and bought a computer to play it on. The product had some limitations, and that's when I discovered Haffner's FULL COUNT BASEBALL. In addition to FCB, I also own 3 in I FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL: THE PRO CAME, and COURT SIDE COLLEGE BASKETBALL. You may want to take note that you called the latter \"Full Count Basketball\" in your issue, which is not correct. I Some of the most eerily accurate season replays we've ever experienced were played using the Lance Haffner games. We've been playing them since the Apple II days and love them. As for the error on COURT SIDE COLLEGE BASKETBALL, I guess we're still confused from when Lance had to change the title from FINAL FOUR COLLEGE BASKETBALL insane), and my computers still can't see each other. The only game I've been able to network briefly through Satan's operating system has been WARCRAFT II, which runs slower than under DOS and without many of the sound effects. The volume of Win95 is always cranked (or off) regardless of whether I try to change it through the sound control panel or in the game. I am using Soundblaster 16s, the most compatible soundcards there are. And now one of my Win95 computers refuses to run WARCRAFT II at all due to soundcard conflicts (even though ran it succesfully before). I made the mistake of trying to FIRING LINE Zeke, we feel your pain.

"READ.ME Whatever Happened To .... Some Vaporware Condenses While Other Games Dissipate BATTLECRUISER 3000 A.D. few prod. ucts that may have long ago been con signed to the \"Vapor Forever\" category are currently showing signs that they are \"not quite dead, yet.\" Long-anticipated games that seer genuinely close to release as of press time are: BATTLECRUISER 3000 A.D., HARVESTER and THE ELDER SCROLLS: DAGGERFALL. Take 2's strategy for BATTLECRUISER 3000 A.D. was to move lone wolf designer Derek Smart-whose well-known problems with Three-Sixty Pacific (money troubles), IntraCorp (contract differences), Mission Studios (legal difficulties) and Take 2 (contractual disagree. ments) have been well-dis. cussed on-line-to Latrobe, PA, where the rest of Take 2's developers (known for STAR CRUSADER and RIPPER) are located. Take 2 is currently improving the art (see screenshot) and interface (see our AOL or Web story) while Smart focuses on the game programming itself. It certainly looks as though the game will ship in October (1996, not 3000). At press time, we have received a \"near-gold\" version of Bethesda Softwork's THE ELDER SCROLLS: DAGGERFALL. Currently, the terrain model has been significantly enhanced by algorithms built by fractal genius and pioneer, Dr. Ken Musgrave. This addition guaran. tees a better look for the game than originally planned, but the true beauty in this game is below the surface. DAGGERFALL offers role-playing detail far beyond games of recent vintage. Another vintage vapor program is Merit Software's HARVESTER. HARVESTER was a perennial demo at computer industry trade shows and anticipated as one of the most con troversial adventure games ever (due to the prodigious blood and gore factor). Delays in HARVESTER can be attributed to both the perfectionism of the designer and the cash flow difficulties of the publisher. Now, Merit anticipates that HARVESTER will be in stores around late October, and our beta version looks like the game is in just about the right condition to make that ship date. Ironically, at the same time that these classic vapor titles are nearing publication, some nearly complete titles have been pulled back (even though they were allegedly \"reviewed\" in another game magazine). Mindscape is attempting to make a clear commitment to quality by cancelling SSI's RENEGADE 2 and their own WARHAMMER 40,000 AD: DARK CRUSADERS. In both cases, com pany officials candidly admitted that the products weren't what they wanted them to be. They suggested that cancelling the products was less expensive in the long run than trying to the ones that frankly ain't so hot. Reviews for most are coming soon.

At the time this issue went to press, there were no plans to liquidate, consolidate or change the operations of either of the two acquired firms. Although a spokesman for GT was unable to reveal the dollar value of the FormGen purchase, he did say the purchase of Humongous was valued at approximately $76 million.

Some of these games are still months away, and they aren't even playable yet, but at least you can see what they look like, and get an idea what their intentions are. X-Wing Vs. TIE Fighter WING VS. TIE FIGHTER, the next space sim from LucasArts, sounds simply outstanding. LucasArts has finally jumped into the world of multiplayer gaming, and this first foray won't disappoint all you space jockeys out there. Unlike its predecessors, there is no \"plot\" or campaign structure, but it is filled with a string of nonlinear missions. The design team is discussing the pos sibility of the Battle Of Endor as being the backdrop to these missions. The game has some single-player missions, but those will mostly be used as trainers for the real purpose of this game: multiplayer Star Wars. The confirmed ships for each side are the Rebel alphabet soup (X, Y, Band A-Wings) plus the Z-95 Headhunters. And those with Imperial tastes will fly the four TIE models--Fighter, Interceptor, Bomber, and Advanced as well as the Assault Gunboat. The other ships have yet to be decided, but there will be no TIE Defender or Missile Boat, as game. play will be too unbalanced. In addition to the multiplayer capabilities, X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER also features a gorgeous new texture-map engine (check out the blast door on that Assault Transport), and in the end, looks like another great space sim.

"F-22 SHOOTOUT F-22 LIGHTNING II irst off the runway will be Novalogic's F-22 LIGHTNING II. While previous NovaLogic efforts have tended to skirt the line between simulations and action games, the company is making a concerted effort to ensure that this product will be perceived as a true sim. Slated for release in early September, this MS-DOS game should be a pleasant surprise for those players who wrote off the COMANCHE Series as arcade games. FJORD ESCORT The coastal terrain in Novalogic's F-22 LIGHTNING II is dazzling, but don't let the scenery distract you from your mission. and then to inland mountains in one area, while another will feature a variety of desert landscapes. Perhaps the most interesting to dogfight over will be the Vietnam-like mountainous jungle environment with its steep, rocky cliffs. Seasons will also come into play, so expect snow cover in some missions. It's the terrain that's the most striking feature of F-22 LIGHTNING II. (To be fair, all entries here top previous efforts in the genre.) Novalogic isn't using its trademark Voxel Space technique here, but the terrain graphics are breathtaking nevertheless. There's no ground warping, visible tiling or polygon pop-up here, and because the game is written completely in speedy assembly language, the terrain flies smoothly at 640x480, even on slower Pentium systems. If you do find things jerky, 320x200 and 400x300 resolutions are supported as well. (The latter resolution is great for full-screen displays on 800x600 laptop screens.) The aircraft look great as well; the F-22 here is by far the most strikingly rendered plane yel seen in a PC simulation. Control sur faces move realistically as you maneuver, and you can watch the thrust vector as you pull on the control stick. Enemy and allied aircraft you'll encounter include AWACS, B-1Bs, F-15s, MiG-27s and Su-27s. All the aircraft are light source shaded and fully texture mapped. Except for a preliminary heads-up display (HUD), the cockpit was unfinished in the version that I flew, but Novalogic plans to accurately model the instruments found in Lockheed's F-22 simulator, including four multifunction displays (MFDs) showing the overall situation, threat status, target information and stores status. Flight modeling sets new standards for Novalogic. It's tough to really put a simulation of an advanced aircraft like the F22 through the wringer, since its digital fly-by-wire controls help keep the plane from departing from controlled flight and because its engines are so power. ful that you can pull off maneuvers that would TARGET DISPATCHED An unlucky MiG-27 falls victim to an send lesser planes F-22's AMRAAM missile, never knowing what hit it. plunging toward the earth. Still, the aircraft does properly lose speed in turns, and stall characteristics seem realistic. Novalogic says the sim should properly reflect the F-22's nonlinear pitch rate and accurately model the plane's roll velocity and response. Once you master the F-22's flight characteristics, you'll be able to test your skills against other players. You can fly any of the campaign missions in cooperative mode, or set up melee-style free-for-all air combat. Network, modem and direct serial connections will be supported. Although the flight model, terrain and graphics engine were solid in the version I tested, the enemy Al wasn't complete, leaving that as the That said, F-22 LIGHTNING II is still accessible to the less hard-core sim flyer, and in fact the campaign mode seems geared more toward the casual sim player. Instead of a dynamic campaign or a branching mission tree, F-22 LIGHTNING Il features a series of sequential mis. sions, a la COMANCHE The game consists of five campaigns, each of which features eight or nine missions. Each campaign is located in a different potential trouble spot: Myanmar (Burma), Siberia, and Serbia were strong can didates for inclusion as this was being written. Rather than changing the next mission depending on the outcome of the previous attack, Novalogic is working on the theory that your reward for winning the mission is being able to move on to the next one. Look for these missions to be primarily of an air-to-air variety. That's true to the real F-22, which is an air-superiority fighter first and foremost, with precision ground strike as a secondary role. The F-22 is an extremely expensive aircraft, about $100 million a pop, so the Air Force will be using the machine primarily on missions involving high-value targets. Look for AWACS attack and escort missions, attacks on priority targets, and defensive dogfighting, as well as occa. sional ground attacks using the new JDAMS (Joint Direct Attack Munitions) precision-guided bombs. In addition to the campaign, there will be a US NAVY FIGHTERS-style quick start mode, where you pick the type of mission, the kinds of planes to include and the enemy skill level, and then jump right in. These missions will take place over a wide variety of terrain types. depending on the campaign. Ocean will give way to green, rolling hills SEPTEMBER 1996 "

Assuming the opposing aircraft fly in a challenging and realistic manner (the quality of the now-complete portions of the sim imply that they will) then this first F-22 sim should garner quite a fol lowing. Only those who desire a dynamic campaign environment are likely to be disappointed. IF-22 LIGHTNING F-22 LIGHTNING marks the return of former MicroProse chief Wild Bill Stealey to the flight sim arena. (Interactive Magic's previous sim efforts, APACHE, HIND, and F-16, are cooperative productions with England's Digital Integration.) This game is a far cry from the simple \"kill the primary target, then take out the secondary target\" MicroProse sims of yesteryear.

Because the game that supports Direct 3D, you'll be treated to resolutions up to 1024x768 with 16-bit color. F-22 will use a dynamically generated campaign system, similar to that in EF2000, where the simulation tracks the progress of the ground and air war going on around you. The simulation will examine the current battle situation and generate a list of potential missions. As squadron leader, you'll choose the mission for your flight. Before you take off, you'll be able to modify aircraft weapons loadouts, change waypoints to and from the target to avoid radar cover. age, and alter other mission parameters. Typical missions should feature four to six aircraft. Many of the missions will be escort assignments, where you'll fly top cover for F-15E Strike Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons and A-10 Warthogs. As squadron commander, you'll be able to choose how many F-22s to take along-you can bring reserve aircraft for particularly tough missions. The development team plans to take special care to emphasize the F-22's stealth abilities. Lockheed touts the aircraft's ability to fire at enemy targets before it's detected-a move the Interactive Magic guys likened to attacking while invisible in an AD&D game. But you'll want to plan your missions carefully, since your \"invisibility\" won't do you any good if you're flying right next to a massive radar-echo generator like a B-52. 1F-22 will model the Lightning's data-link capa. bilities, which will allow it not only to share threat information with other squadron aircraft but to use AWACS radar to launch AMRAAM missiles stealthily. As campaigns progress, you may be tasked with air-to-ground duties that require you to carry external weapons, sacrificing your stealth abilities for additional firepower. 1F-22 will feature a four-MFD cockpit panel patterned after Lockheed's F-22 simulator cockpit. The 3D-rendered cockpit will have the added touch of being fully functional-along with the standard keyboard and joystick controls most of the cockpit switches can be activated using the mouse. The flight model was still a work in progress when I examined the sim. Interactive Magic explained that the actual F-22 performance data is classified, so they're basing the aircraft's performance and HEAD FOR THE ROCKIES With satellite images mapped on accurate terrain elevations, iF-22 LIGHTNING's ground sports unprecedented realism. is still a ways off-it won't ship until the first quarter of 1997-recent ly flew to Interactive Magic's headquarters in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, to meet with F-22's development team and fly an early alpha version. The most startling initial impression comes from the simulation's terrain system. Where NovaLogic's terrain is representative of the combat arena, and JETFIGHTER 3 uses hand-created textures wrapped on realistic elevation data, IF-22 goes a step further by wrapping real satellite images on top of accurate Digital Elevation Map (why caps--throughout?] data. The alpha test version used a Grand Canyon terrain map, with spectacular results. The final game will send the player on missions in Bosnia, the Persian Gulf and the southwestern corner of the former Soviet Union. Approximately 80,000 square miles (a 400-by-200-mile corridor) of each region will be modeled using photographically accurate 3D terrain. A welcome feature will be Interactive Magic's unique fractal microtexturing, which will add detail as you fly low to the ground. This will spare you the experience of flying over giant, square pixels that you get when hugging the ground in other sims. Standard graphics will be 640x480 with 256 colors, but if you own a 3D card LAST RITES This MiG-29 is about to meet its end thanks to the 22's ability to fire off-boresight missiles that can actually turn to hit their targets.

"F-22 SHOOTOUT handling on current F-15 style flight models, extrapolating for the F. 22's agility, power and thrust-vectoring abilities. Varying levels of realism should make the game accessible for beginners but will hope fully still satisfy the hard-core simulation crowd. Like the early MicroProse sims, as you progress in your career, you'll be given the opportunity to earn medals and promotions. Although it's too early to make a call, 1F-22 is poised to attempt to capture the market by combining the fun factor of classic sims with state-of-the-art technical advances. It sounds like a potentially win. ning formula. TFX3: LIGHTNING STRIKE -FX3: LIGHTNING STRIKE is the working title for the sequel to the Premiere Award-winning EF2000. Created by the UK's Digital Image Design and to be distributed in the United States by Ocean, this Windows 95 simulator will build on the foundation laid by are in place. TFX3 will feature an updated graphics engine, significantly enhanced from the preliminary screen shots that accompany this article. Look for light source shading and shadows on terrain, as well as a new smoothing feature designed to eliminate pixelation at low altitudes. All the aircraft models have been redone, adding bitmapped textures and significantly more detail. At the moment, it doesn't look like DID will support Direct 3D. Instead, TFX3 will directly support the 3Dfx graphics chipset, providing 16-million-color graphics at high resolutions. Finally, look for a significantly enhanced multiplayer experience. Instead of the King of the Skies free-for-all players will now be able to form teams. Each side gets an airbase, an AWACS aircraft, a tanker and ground defenses. The objective will be to land on an opponent's airbase to capture it. Tactics are up to the players. Do you spread your team out on defense or drive straight for the enemy airbase? And, when all is said and done, TFX3 will present you with animated victory or defeat animations rather than the simple, disappointing \"You Won\" text messages. The furthest out of the titles here, TFX3 is currently slated to ship around March 1997. If you want an early taste of TFX3's technology, check out SUPER EF2000 FOR WINDOWS 95, which should be available early this fall. JETFIGHTER III W hen we previewed JETFIGHTER III in our December 1995 issue, the product was on the leading edge of flight simulation technology. Had it shipped in January, as developer Mission Studios originally planned, it would indeed have pushed the state of the art forward. Now slated to ship October 1, this MS-DOS game is in the middle of the technology pack. It may not cause your jaw to drop, but it still promises to be a solid, entertaining game. Of all the sims covered here, JF3 plays loosest with the facts by basing your F-22 squadron on an aircraft carrier. Although a naval variant has been proposed, as it stands the F-22 is purely a landSe REAL OPISE . DESERT LIGHTNING TFX3 will use a refined version of the EF2000 graphics engine; look for the pixellation evident in this early alpha to disappear. EF2000 and the TactCom mission planner add-on (see next month's Simulations column for details on TactCom). This time around you've traded your Euro Fighter 2000 in for the even hotter F-22A Lightning, and you're off to defend American interests in the Red Sea region. The terrain covered by the TFX3 campaign includes Ethiopia, Sudan and parts of Iran, Iraq and Kuwait. However, the political situation changes each time you start a new campaign, so your allies may differ from game to game. Be careful about offending neutral countries-one misplaced AMRAAM could make a new enemy. TFX3 will give you much more control over your mission planning than EF2000 did. Waypoints and cruise altitudes can be altered based on intelligence data, and you can designate targets yourself. You'll also be able to assign additional flights for strike, escort and Wild Weasel (anti-missile radar) mission. Alternatively, you can plan missions by manning an AWACS control station, where you can actively vector aircraft to targets. DID is aiming to create a tactical command experience with a HARPOON 2 level of intensity at the AWACS station. The difference here is that you can jump into the cockpit of one of the F-22s after your orders FIREFOX REVISITED Although terrain can be handy for defensive maneuvers in JETFIGHTER 3, it's probably too late for this Flanker-pursued F-22.

"F-22 SHOOTOUT Since the original preview (available on CGW's Web site) was written, Mission has added high-res graphics that improve the look of JF3 dramatically. The over 3.5 million miles of accurately modeled terrain (based on real-world Digital Elevation Maps) precludes the use of satellite imagery, so JF3 uses tiled, drawn textures instead. The two included campaigns are set in Cuba and Chile, and the terrain covers those countries as well as parts of Florida, Argentina and Antarctica. The campaigns are scripted rather than dynamic, but they feature a wide variety of branching missions, so there should be plenty of replayability. An add-on disc will add new terrain areas as well as multiplayer play. In addition, there's now a new aircraft, the FIA-18 Hornet, and programmer Bob Dinnerman might be able to slip the F-14 in there as well before the product's ship date. If you're trying to accurately relive the F-22 driver experience, this isn't your sim, but if you enjoyed US NAVY FIGHTERS or ATF, JETFIGHTER III could very well provide a wild ride. 17 OH SHIP! JETFIGHTER 3 bases its F-22s on an aircraft carrier, but it looks like you'll be needing a runway to land on today... based fighter. In addition, the weapons loads in the pre-beta versions don't match the real F22's capabilities. If you're a purist, you'll want to look elsewhere, but if you don't mind a little fiction tossed in to enhance gameplay, JF3's rich mission environment should be a good draw.

"F-22 SHOOTOUT The Real F-22 The F-22 is a big fighter: 44 feet, 6 inches in wingspan: 62 feet, 1 inch in length; 16 feet, 5 inches in height. Despite that size, its classified radar signature is likely much smaller than that of your average bird. hen you read Air Force publications covering the Lockheed Martin F-22A Lightning II fighter program, you can almost sense the writer drooling on the keyboard. Now that Russian fighters have caught up with their American counterparts in many respects-in fact, an Su-27 Flanker can detect an F-15 before the F-15 sees it-the Air Force is anxious to regain its air superiority. The F-22A is the dream fighter designed to do just that. Among the fighter's advanced features are supercruise (the ability to cruise at Mach 1.58 without using fuel-sucking afterburners). stealth, thrust vectoring for superior maneuverability, and an extremely advanced avionics package that greatly reduces a pilot's workload while giving unprecedented situational awareness. The F22A is designed to use its stealth to move undetected into firing range of its target, launch its missile and get away before the enemy knows what hit him.

"NET PLAY CH NE QUAKE Come See The Carnage Cabaret by Dave Salvator PE OMM nless you've been under a rock, you've no doubt heard about QUAKE, id software's latest horrific hell-spawn, the shareware edition of which was recently unleashed on the impatient gaming public Many gamers were priming their pumps with Orest, an initial release of several DeathMatch levels that at least gave them something to gnaw on until the shareware was pushed out the door. But the wait is, well, almost over. The rumor mill has the full, registered version of QUAKE Shipping sometime in August, so with any luck, it will be out by the time you read this. The shareware edition has four ghoulish levels featuring bone-crushing new weapons and a cast of nasties ghastly enough to make Freddie Krueger feel inadequate. Fiendish foes aside, one of QUAKE's coolest components is its IPX. and TCP/IP-based multiplayer capabilities, because human opponents make for a more targetrich environment and of course there's the taunt factor. id software, (214) 613-3589, www.idsoftware.com NICE PANTS Using the No Friendly Fire feature prevents fratricide-as long as your fellow player has the same pants preference, MOR 2 'IGI NET SERVING UP QUAKE To launch a TCP/IP-based multiplayer fragfest, you can run Quake in a DOS window under Windows 95 or load the Beame and Whiteside DOS TCP/IP stack. Each has its relative merits and downsides. Windows 95's TCP/IP stack is pretty easy to configure, and you simply edit the Q95.BAT file to enable QUAKE to talk to Win 95's TCP/IP stack. Of course, running Quake in a Windows 95 DOS window may slow your frame rate, since parts of the OS are still in memory and access ing the CPU. The Beame and Whiteside DOS TCP/IP stack is the only real-mode stack that QUAKE will use, and because you're running in DOS with much less overhead from Windows 95, you should get better overall performance. But DOS TCP/IP stacks are notorious for being a royal pain to configure and get running, and Beame and Whiteside's is no exception. What's more, latency over the net can be a pain, especially if one player has an especially slow connection. QUAKE can also talk to Kali, which can run IPX-based games over TCP/IP (see Loyd Case's Technology column this month for the lowdown on Kali). Once you've started Kali, launch Quake, and create or join a network game as if you were running over IPX. Closer to home, you can play QUAKE over your IPX network, and getting a match started is pretty straightforward. QUAKE has two kinds of servers: Listen and Dedicated. A Listen Server is run on a player's machine-usually the fastest computerwhich acts as the server in addition to running the game. But if you've got a spare PC that's pretty fast, it can act as a Dedicated server, han dling all server duties, leaving all players' machines free of the addi tional overhead. QUAKE will allow up to 8 players when running on a Listen server, and 16 players on a Dedicated server. Type \"Quake.lis. ten\" to launch a Listen server, and \"Quake dedicated 16\" to launch a Dedicated server with support for up to 16 players. In setting up a multiplayer game, QUAKE offers several options: DeathMatch vs. cooperative, difficulty level, starting level, and teamplay. The team play options enable and disable Friendly Fire. When No Friendly Fire is selected, your shots won't injure your teammates. (Members of the same team all wear the same color pants.) Recently, id inked a deal with Mpath so that QUAKE will run over the Internet through the Mplayer Web-based online gaming system. But you don't need an online service to run QUAKE over the Internet. You can enter the IP number of a server where Quake is running and con nect directly. What about multiplayer strategy? Well, because QUAKE has so many networking options, we've covered those here. For strategy tips on how to ferociously frag your friends, check out the Action section on page 142 TACTIC 0001 SMART-AXE BEHAVIOR With both the Pentagram of Protection and Quad Damage active, even an axe is a formidable weapon.

Blast right through it: remember, this is make-believe, OMMA So put the pedal to the metal, and be happy that EA gave us a properly tuned sequel, rather than just a new paint job and added chrome. Electronic Arts, (415) 571-7171, www.ea.com R2 IGH he Lamborghini could best me on the straightaways, but its design, though eye-popping, left it turning like a warm slug. So I waited for my chance and blew by my adversary, the Dodge Viper responding to my every command, becoming a blue streak as I jetted across the finish line mere yards away. My silicon opponents had little to say, but the human drivers were rather critical It seems I had \"bounced\" a couple of them while negotiating the final turn. Hope their insurance is paid up for the next race... While admittedly lacking the painstaking accuracy of say, NASCAR RACING, NEED FOR SPEED packs a lot of detail into its arcade racing framework. The learning curve is moderate-it's fairly easy to jump into a car and drive competently (with the possible exception of those who crafted their driving skills in L.A. or New York). But to win consistently the game requires enough skill that you have to constantly refine your techniques. The mechanically inclined can even fiddle with the transmission without needing a Ph.D. from the Indy 500 racing institute. The cars do handle quite differently, so that a lot of the fun and strategycomes from figuring out which vehicle runs best on the various tracks. The main problems with the original game are more than adequately dealt with here: Several new tracks have been added, you have eight cars instead of two from which to choose, and the multiplayer options let you compete against up to seven other human would be Richard Pettys or a mix of human and computer opponents. S07:00.0 03:00.J. LOL 1.8 miest 2/2 NET HIGH-SPEED NETWORK RACING NEED FOR SPEED: DELUXE EDITION lets you play net games from one CD-but everyone but the \"CD holder\" must install 170+ MB of graphics and sound to their hard drives. The big decision here is finding the connection that lets you glide down the track most smoothly. Your best bet is with a Winsock IPX connection, which has the added advantage of being able to transfer data quickly. We had some lockups with DOS IPX, although your \"net driver mileage\" may vary. Because this arcade game simulates a 3D environment without tak. ing advantage of newer 3D video card technology, you really need at least a fast 2 MB video card or you're going to watch the frame rate tumble like a 'Vette flipping on an oil spill. And if you want to install less than the 173 MB maximum to your hard drive, you'd better have at least a quad-speed drive (our best results were with the high-perfor mance six-speed Plextor). As far as processor speed goes, we had to turn down the detail level on an older P100 to keep up with the pack. The moral here is, if you insist on racing your 486 against your friend's P133, don't expect to be competitive. Finally, your version of Windows 95 may not properly install the DirectX2 drivers correctly the first time. So go through the installation routine twice to make sure all the video and audio drivers make their way onto your system. eco TACTIC RCI GEARING UP FOR A WILD RIDE It's easier to start with automatic transmissions, but switch to man. ual as soon as you have the controls down. You'll find it more challenging at first, but once you get the timing down, there's nothing more exhilarating than shifting down into second gear and passing your adversaries while going up a hill. The physics are pretty darn good for an arcade game, but the realism isn't. After flipping a car, you can bounce right back up. Use this to your advantage: Be aggressive, and have fun! ELASTIC COLLISION Bouncing off a hillside is a great way to take out enemy cars in a tight race. SEPTEMBER 1996 "

"NET PLAY NE NUKEM 3D Rip 'Em A New One REALTH ARMOR 100 100 WEAPONS 2200/200 5050/50 :99/99 3:50/50 4200/200 1:49 250 0.99799 A1110 419 by Thierry Nguyen and Dave Salvator COAST IS CLEAR That's the safe way to clear a laser mine from a distance. COMM UKE NUKEM's got legs, and those boots were made for stompin. Despite QUAKE's release, DUKE still enjoys top billing from many multiplayer commandos (especially those with 486s). With weapons like the pipe bomb and laser trip mines (which are begging for net-play use), a fiendishly detailed and interactive envi ronment, and perhaps the funniest Remote Ridicule system to date, DUKE is a multiplayer maniac's dream. The thrill of floating above an opponent who just ran into your Holoduke trap surrounded with pipe bombs and tapping Alt-F8 to say \"Haha, wasted\" is something no other game can match. Taken as a whole, DUKE NUKEM 3D is the best net action game other than QUAKE on the market today. Formgen/3D Realms, (602) 443-4109, www.3drealms.com PRIOR must start a net game from the Setup utility rather than from the game. Players can dynamically leave during a net game, though. To start a network game, launch the Setup utility in your DUKE3D subdirectory. From there select Network Game. In this menu, you can change the number of players (from two to eight) or tweak other prop. erties. All players can also change player name, select a custom-made User Level, put in a new set of taunts to DUKE's infamous Remote Ridicule system and change the text of taunt macros. If your network is supporting several DUKE matches simultaneously, you may need to specify a network socket number, or DUKE will attach you to the first match it sees. The network socket number can be any four-digit number: client players will attach to a server using that same number. All other players will then connect\" to this server, and when the designated number of players have attached, the fun begins. Once all players have arrived at DUKE's main menu, the server player, called the Master, sets the level parameters. The Master can set the starting level, whether the game will be cooperative or a DeathMatch, and whether there will be monsters to keep you company during a DeathMatch. The Master can also specify to start the net game on a user-designed level, if one has been created, One cool thing about DUKE's network play: If the Master decides to flee, the remaining players can stay and slug it out. So have at it! FIG DIVNET DUKING IT OUT WITH THE NETWORK For multiplayer action, you have the head-to-head options of playing via modem or serial cable. But the real fun begins when you have any where from three to eight players slugging it out. Duke has two options for bringing additional players on board. You can run DUKE on your IPX-based network, or if you're looking for opponents in faraway places, 3D Realms has a deal with the TEN online gaming service for Duke matches over the Internet. (We'll be taking a closer look at TEN and other online gaming players in our next issue.) Duke doesn't require you to be logged on to a server; you just need to have an IPX protocol stack running. Check out our \"Building Your Own Game Network\" feature on page 87 for in-depth details on network configuration. In the meantime, here are the quick-and-dirty steps you'll need to configure DUKE. Duke's IPX gaming functionality is limited, in that it doesn't allow dynamic entry of new players once the match has started, and you \"COME GET SOME...\" Know your weapons, and use them effectively. The two best all around weapons are the Shrinker and the RPG. The Shrinker is an extremely powerful gun; it only takes one or two shots to shrink opponents, and then you can just step on them. The RPG is powerful, and it's something you can find pretty quickly in just about every level. It shoots a bit slowly, but one to three direct shots will usually \"gib\" your opponent. Just be sure not to fire from too close. The rest are a mixed bag. Both pipe bombs and laser trip mines can be used to make great traps. The shotgun can be a standby, like in Doom, but its best range is up close and personal. The chain gun is good for suppression and for spraying in wide open areas (like the Stadium). The freeze gun is a nice concept, but too many hits are needed to freeze someone, and they can ricochet and hit you. The only reason to prefer the RPG over the Devastator is that the Devastator eats up its rockets like there's no tomorrow. If you have the ammo and your opponent is cornered, just let them rockets fly.

"NET PLAY th 186 TSAS SLACER SLASER VELAS SLASER NEEI NETMECH FOR MECHWARRIOR 2 autre Meching The Best of It by Greg Fortune ARMED AND DANGEROUS Standard mechs load up the arms with weaponry, so taking them out first may rob your opponents of most of their firepower. OMMA O, you're feeling a little cocky since conquering your enemies and becoming Khan of your clan? Are you worthy? Now it's time to prove it, freebirth! What could be better than frying your friends with a 75-ton BattleMech? The NETMECH add-on for Activision's MECHWARRIOR 2 features both team and free for all missions, with a wide variety of objectives to brawl over. This is a Deathmatch style slugfest, with no Al mechs present on the battlefield. Don't worry, you'll probably find your human opponents a bigger challenge than Als any. way (not to mention a lot more fun to taunt after you blast one of their legs off)! You are free to use the custom mechs you've built in the standalone version of MECHWARRIOR 2, but you cannot use mech designs from the GHOST BEAR'S LEGACY expansion pack in NETMECH. Look for that capability in the upcoming MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES missions (see page 76). So strap on you neural helmet, mechwarrior, and let's take a look at what it takes to make this baby run. Activision, (310) 473-9200, www.activision.com IGH 2 players: The DOS version of NetMech will work with your copy of the game, although you will lose any custom cockpit controls you have configured. I recommend that you install the Net Mech package into the same directory as your MECHWARRIOR 2 installation. If you follow this advice, you'll be able to use all of your custom mech designs and cockpit settings in your network games. You'll need to make any changes from the configuration screens of the standalone product, so make your adjustments before you link up. Once you are ready to get online, you need to decide how you wish to connect. If you have access to a LAN, you can link a maximum of eight people using the IPX protocol. If you have a 9600 bps modem or better (14.4 Kbps recommended), you can either play with three other MechWarriors via Dwango or against one other person by dialing them directly. Your last option is to con nect with a null-modem cable, so that you can taunt your opponent both onscreen and verbally. NET e CO MECH A CONNECTION! First, be warned that the version of NET MECH that's bundled with the Win 95 version of MECHWARRIOR 2 won't talk to the DOS version, due to its use of Microsoft's DirectPlay networking routines. Setup on an IPX network is pretty painless, but if your friends are using the DOS version, you'll be playing solo. A ray of hope for Win 95 MECHWARRIOR TACTIC MALAS SUES ISLAS SUCER SEASER MECH A BREAK FOR IT Like many great multiplayer games, NETMECH is simply an extension of its single player predecessor. The skills you have learned reaching this point in your career will serve you well on the battlefields ahead. If you are fighting a single human opponent, keep your eyes open for opportunities and your mind open to the unconventional tactics you are sure to face in your battles with these inner-sphere scum. Keep one eye on your heat meter and pick your shots carefully; three rapid misses followed by a hit are often worse than a single miss, due to the heat you will accumulate. Group your weapons wisely, as different types of weapon require different amounts of lead for your shot to hit true. If you're playing on a LAN or via Dwango and have more than two players, you'll need to work with someone as a team to win the day, Even in a free-for-all, don't be surprised if some of your opponents form temporary alliances for the purpose of thinning the pack. You don't get bonus points for dying with your honor intact, so be prepared to form alliances of your own to counter these kinds of tactics. In team play, keep your lines of communication open and coordinate your actions with your starmates. The clan that forms an organized, planned attack will quickly gain a tactical advantage over the clan with no plan for attack or defense. CI K : 2 HOT GUNS The PPC is a deadly weapon, but it's heat intensive, so make sure you load up with heat-sinks or you'll shut down before victory. CG SEPTEMBER 1996 "

While these are noble, worthy ideals to fight wars over, MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES, gives you the most motivational incentive for fighting a war: cold, hard cash. In MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES, you portray the captain of one of the mercenary groups during the turbulent year of 3039, 18 years before the events chronicled in MECHWARRIOR 2. In this prequel, the clans are advancing, the Inner Sphere houses are busy fighting each other, and your purpose is to profit from everyone else's skirmishes. Your ultimate goal is to become one of the elite mercenary groups that will be contracted by COMSTAR or another Inner Sphere group for the epic Battle of Tukayyid. 'IGH XPLOSIVE IMPROVEMENTS No more boring polygons-nearly everything in the MERCENARIES world is lovingly texture-mapped. NET WATCH FOR FALLING MECHS MERCENARIES features a significantly enhanced update of the original MECHWARRIOR 2 engine. Detailed textures flow across the landscape, and the mechs now sport textures on individual components, as well as insignia. The new multiple-light sourcing is best seen when firing a stream of missiles in a dark city; the addition of a particle system yields missile smoke trails and richer explosions. An improved night vision mode uses a more efficient infrared sensor, instead of the sickly green phosphorous-type light amplification of the original game. Finally, a tweaked physics model means that, in certain cases, blowing a leg off a mech will result in said mech falling to the ground. The sight of a mech struggling on the ground, waiting to be finished off, is one that a ruthless merc will glory in. you purchased the spare parts and brought them with you from home base when you went into the field. MERCENARIES will also feature salvage, which means head-shot kills will be rewarded with new arms and legs to graft onto damaged mechs. This will be a key factor in cerlain missions, and will allow you to obtain enemy technology and get some free parts from a battle. TACTIC CASH OR CREDIT? Besides the engine enhancements, Activision has dramatically altered the basic flow of the game. Before, when fighting for the clans, you were only the military end; all expenses were taken care of by the government and the laborers. With the new economic system, you liter ally have to work for your parts. Your missions are now paid contracts from various parties. The money you earn will be used to pay for your mechs, your technicians, your repairs, your weapons, even more pilots. This addition of money is only one cog in the wheel of the new resource management nature of the game. Since you have to pay for everything now, you will have to be more careful about weapons and damage. Damage sustained in combat must be repaired by paid techs, which means money out of your pocket-and that's assuming STORY MECH-ANICS Perhaps the best improvement in MERCENARIES is the branching story line. Instead of the \"replay the mission until you get it right\" rou: tine found in the original, the story line now branches: Your perfor mance in a mission affects your mission choices later in the game. Look for more surprises in missions in this incarnation not everything will turn out to be what it seems. Add to that Novice Mode, which will let casual players who don't want to deal with economic realities jump in and play, the Instant Action option (the merc's answer to the clanner's \"Trial of Grievance\"), 32 new mechs (in addition to those in MECHWARRIOR 2 and GHOST BEAR'S LEGACY) unique to the Inner Sphere and the mercenary groups, and the chance to engage in the biggest, most famous battle in BattleTech history: The Battle Of Tukayyid. This fall, clanners will see just how cool the gritty and money-lined life of a merc is. Activision, (310) 473-9200, www.activision.com CG SEPTEMBER 1996 "

"NET PLAY CH NET PLAY NEEI ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS Mixing It Up At Mach 2 not DOO 9001 onant anna PE by Denny Atkin MIRROR DANCE The rear-view mirror is an especially useful defense mechanism. In multiplayer action it's too easy to get caught up in just what's in front of you. OM ane's ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS (ATF) has the balance of realism and accessibility that makes it a natural for network gaming. It's not a hard sim to get up to speed in, so you can easily fill out its maximum of eight players with flight-sim novices. The novice pilots don't have to feel like targets, though. Because of the huge variety of planes in ATF, you can give the newbies the hottest planes in the sky, such as F-22A Lightning Ils or Dassault Rafales, and stick the old-timer aces in museum pieces like F-4 Phantoms or Mig 21s. In all, you'll find 90 different aircraft models available in multiplayer mode, from experimental fighters to bombers and transports. The Quick Mission builder lets you set up raw, head-to-head combat either with two teams competing or in an anything goes free-for-all. Victory conditions are adjustable and include total kills (by player or team), total damage delivered to opponents, or the kill ratio (kills inflicted versus deaths suffered). You can limit the number of revivals each player gets, and set a delay interval between death and revival. You can also adjust the distance from the fight at which a revived player reappears and what kinds of armament that player will have. Multiplayer single missions are also available for instance, where one group of players would be tasked with defending a group of tanks while another tries to take them out. All these options make ATF a blast, whether you're looking for a quick aerial frag-fest or an afternoon of tournament combat. Jane's/Electronic Arts, (415) 571-7171, www.ea.com GETTING CONNECTED ATF requires a network with IPX support for play with more than two players. (Two-player games are possible with a simple modem connection or a direct serial link.) Note that ATF will not run under any version of Windows, so you'll need DOS-mode IPX drivers for network games. For two to eight users, you can use Thin Ethernet, an inexpensive setup that requires only an Ethernet card and T-adapter for each computer, two terminators, and Thin Ethernet (coaxial) cable. This setup avoids the need for a network hub, but it's slower and will bog down as you add users. If you have multiple ATF games going on a network, with a total of more than eight players, you'll need to go to a full-blown 10BaseT (or 100BaseT) setup with a network hub. 'IGH INET CO TACTIC KING OF THE SKIES The best way to rule the skies in ATF is take the most maneuverable aircraft. Fly the A-10, EF2000, F-22, Harrier or X-29 and you'll be able to turn inside less agile opponents. The X-31 and X-32 are also highly maneuverable, but manual thrust vectoring is too hard to take advantage of in the heat of combat. Load up on AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles, since most of your combat will be at close range. The heavily armored A-10 is a particularly vicious weapons platform: you can arm it with up to 12 Sidewinders, along with its massive 30mm cannon. Although ATF supports only eight players per session, you can run multiple ATF games on the same network. If you have a large number of players, you can use tournament-style play to get everyone in on the competition. The winning team can challenge the winners of the other games in an ongoing sports-tournament fashion, until everyone is eliminated except the final victor. (Meanwhile, eliminated pilots can continue to play in separate games.) In single player mode, ATF normally gives you only 14 planes to choose from, but if you want to practice flying the more esoteric aircraft before the big net game, just press the secret keys. Holding down the Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys on the right side of the keyboard, click Quick Mission, then click Cancel. Hold down the keys again and choose Quick Mission once more, and you'll be able to practice using any plane in the sim. VCI WEAPONS HOG WILD With a massive (if unrealistic) load of 12 Sidewinder mis. siles, the A-10 Warthog is good choice for multiplayer melees. 12 SEPTEMBER 1996 "

"NET PLAY NI WARCRAFT I Separating The Orcs From The Dorks In Multiplayer Melees CON by Elliott Chin COM TOWER POWER A good strategy for disrupting your enemy's cash flow and killing off his peasants is to erect several cannon towers near his most important gold mine. he battle for Azeroth in Blizzard's WARCRAFT II offers some of the most fun and frantic multiplayer action this side of COMMAND & CONQUER. As a multiplayer game, WARCRAFT II's options are pretty hard to match. It supports up to eight players over a network and has four map sizes for different styles of play. There's a small map for quick battles, a medium-size map that allows a brief moment of exploration and build-up before a tumultuous showdown, and two larger maps that are big enough to allow ample exploration and army-building prior to an eight-way blood fest. Both the Orc and Human races are available to all eight players, and WARCRAFT || also allows gamers to form alliances and team up against friends. With a seamless point-and-click interface, WARCRAFT II is an easy game for newcomers to digest. Strategy veterans, on the other hand, will be challenged by the variety of structures and units they can build, as well as the quick, real-time battles that demand thinking on the fly. With over 70 missions between WARCRAFT II and the expansion disk. and an included scenario and unit editor, there is virtually no end to the variety and number of multiplayer maps you can play on in WARCRAFT II. Blizzard, (800) 953-SNOW, www.blizzard.com FIG setup, up to eight players can participate in a multiplayer match. The game also supports two-player, head-to-head play over a modem or a direct link with a null modem. In addition, you can play WARCRAFT II over the Internet using the application Kali, though fast connections are necessary for any reasonable performance. Multiplayer games of WARCRAFT II can be played in both DOS and Windows 95. By far the best multiplayer feature of WARCRAFT II is the spawning technology. This unique technology allows up to three people to play per CD. Only the host needs to have the WARCRAFT II CD in the CD ROM drive, while the other two players can connect and play without one. For a six-way match, two CDs are needed, and an eight player match requires three. DIYNET CONNECTING TO AZEROTH WARCRAFT II matches can be waged over an IPX network. In this GOLDEN MEANS The key to winning is maintaining a steady income. Explore the map early. The minute you've spotted an extra gold mine, send a party of military units and a peon to the gold mine and have the peon build a town hall while the soldiers stand guard. At this early stage of the game, it is unlikely that your opponents will have claimed these extra gold mines, so it is essential that you get there first. Once the town hall has been built, recruit an additional peon, and then build a guard tower for immediate protection. This will double your income, giving you a sizable advantage in growth over your opponents. One tactic for wreaking havoc on your opponents is building several towers near his primary gold mine. Send out three peons to your enemy's mine, and then have one begin construction of a tower while the other two \"repair\" it and speed its completion. Once the tower is built, immediately upgrade it to a cannon tower, and then build another one. If you're fast enough, you might get two towers up before he kills your insidious little workforce. The towers accomplish two things: First, they kill your opponent's peons, forcing him to waste gold recruiting extras. Second, they severely inhibit, or even cut off, his gold supply by making the route too dangerous to travel. ARC SOM DEO GREAT BALLS OF FIRE To destroy those pesky towers, right-click on them with your catapults. Catapults' longer range enables them to destroy the towers easily. SEPTEMBER 1996 "

OMM MOR 2 NAME: KILLS LORD WAEB. 27 OMMAND & Conquer nabbed the Premier Award for Best Strategy Game of the Year not only for its engaging real-time gameplay and high production values, but also for its immense success as a multiplayer game. In multiplayer matches, COMMAND & CONQUER Supports a maximum of four players. Unfortunately, the map sizes are fairly small, but between the original game and the mission disk, COVERT OPERATIONS, there are dozens of maps for multiplayer fans to choose from. Players can choose to be either the good GDI or evil NOD Brotherhood. One advantage C&C has over WARCRAFT II is the variety of army capabilities: The GDI has large, powerful units, while the NOD has fast, stealthy ones. These differences lead to necessarily different strategies, which will challenge even veteran strategy gamers. You can also alter the parameters of multiplayer games, such as starting credits, the existence of computer opponents, the game's tech level (which dictates the types of troops you can build), and the distrib. ution of crates around the map that hold money and special bonuses.

'IGH COMMUNICATELE INTER NET SALVAGING THE SITUATION When you're being pummeled, as in this guerrilla attack, you can sell off structures for money and additional troops. CONNECTING TO COMBAT COMMAND & CONQUER can be played over a network with the IPX protocol. In this case, up to four players can compete in one match. There is also support for head-to-head play over a modem or null modem. In modem games, C&C requires that both players have a 9600 bps or faster modem. For the best performance, CGW recom mends playing C&C on a 486/100 or better system with at least 16 megs of RAM. C&C is a DOS product. If you launch it from the Windows 95 desktop, it will take you to DOS mode, and you won't be able to access your other Windows applications. COMMAND & CONQUER FOR WINDOWS 95 should be available by this fall and will support TCP/IP play over the Internet TACTIC harvester cuts his income by half and requires that he waste money building another one. During that time, you will enjoy a two-to-one advantage in harvesting tiberium and building units. Shortcuts and extra features available in C&C are detailed, not in the documentation, but in the README file. These keyboard shortcuts are convenient for managing your troops and issuing special instruc. tions in single player mode, but they're essential for multiplayer games. During a battle, at times the selected units bunch up, which leaves them vulnerable to certain weapons. You can scatter the bunched units by pressing the X key. If the situation becomes hopeless, you can resign from the game. In single player mode, you will abort the mission; however, in multiplayer mode, you go out with a bangliterally. To cause all your units to self-destruct, press the R key. CONQUERING THE COMPETITION Harvesters are the weak link in every player's game. Therefore, guard your harvesters and don't let them stray too far beyond your defensible perimeter. Check up on your harvesters periodically to make sure they don't wander into enemy territory. Conversely, you want to hunt down your enemy's harvesters. On the NOD side, bug. gies and bikes are good for taking out enemy GDI harvesters, because they are fast enough for hit-and-run tactics and can flee if the enemy sends heavy tanks to defend the harvester.

Only in CIVILIZATION can your leader have a reign that spans millennia, and only in CivNET can you share that experience with other human leaders. (It appears the multiplayer hooks in CIVILIZATION II won't be taken advantage of, so don't expect a CivNer II any time soon.) One of the reasons that CivNET works is that Sid Meier actually con sulted on the design. The upside of this is that the game plays very like the original CIVILIZATION. What comes as less-than-welcome news is that everything looks dated, now that Civ II is conquering many a gamer's hard drive. Another problem is game balance: Humans can't benefit from the cheats that computer civilizations do, so falling behind early often means that you stay behind other human empires. And then there are the infamous bugs. Whereas Civ II has benefited from gameplay patches, you don't need these enhancements to play the game. In CivNet, you either get the latest patch or you console yourself that you've bought a Windows version of solo CIVILIZATIONbecause you aren't going to be playing for very long over a network Despite all this, the game works pretty well once the band-aids have been properly affixed. The parallel turn sequence is a boon for those who hate waiting for their opponents to move in turn-based games, and it helps add to the tension during play.

Since the action is turn-based rather than real-time, latency isn't as big an issue as it could be. Even so, you'll want to avoid Windows 3.1x; if you must play with Win 3.1, don't try to play with people who are using Win 95, unless teeth-gnashing is one of your favorite hobbies. Similarly, we don't recommend that you mix and match very fast systems-say, P133s-with 486/33s and slower machines. It shouldn't make a difference, but it does, especially over a network. When you install CivNET, make sure you let the program install the WinG drivers, even if you are convinced that you don't need them. And while it might seem obvious, don't try to multitask while you are playing a multiplayer game (although popping your favorite music CD in seems to work OK in Win 95 CivNET games). murid TACTIC CE \"Your civilization makes us laugh We vill agree not to crush your vorthless civilization in exchange for the secret of Horseback Riding We ignore your hollov threats Give secret of Horseback Riding OK SNEAKY CIVPLOYS When you design a world, make a land bridge along the Antarctic coast connecting two larger continents, then research chariots and horseback riding.

"BUILD YOUR OWN GAME NET FIGURE 1 Wiring a null-modem cable. fost gamers like the idea of multiplayer gaming, but think the hardware is too complicated and expensive. To play a computer game with one or more friends, you need three things: a game with multiplayer sup. port, two or more computers, and a way to connect the computers together. These days, it's not all that difficult to meet those require ments. Just about all newer titles have some sort of head-to-head play option, either over a direct serial connection or a network. Coming up with two or more computers also isn't as hard as you might think. You, or a friend, may already be a two-computer household, where the parents have recently bought themselves a new computer, and given the older machine to the kids (or vice versa). Or, you may have a friend who is willing to bring over a portable (or even a not-soportable) computer to your house for a friendly (or not-so-friendly) round of gaming. The last step, connecting the computers, is the one that throws most people. That's because when they hear the word network, they think of a local area networks (LAN) maintained by large businesses-comprised of a huge server with dozens of workstations, and ruled by an all-powerful system administrator. Many LAN administra tors have strict policies about gaming on the company network, with punishments ranging from a wrist-slap to summary execution. Most of their concern stems from problems with Doom1.O's network functionality, which flooded networks with excessive traffic, causing clients to lose their connections, and bringing overall network perfor mance to a crawl. That problem was quickly remedied, and networked games published since use very little network bandwidth, making administrators' concerns pretty much outdated. But old policies die hard, so using your company network may not be an option, even after hours, for networked gaming. Fortunately, setting up a game net work is much simpler, requiring only a bare minimum of hardware and software and no special expertise. Here's a guide to getting a game net up and running, so you can bring multiplayer gaming home.

Since almost every computer already has a connector for a second serial port, the only hardware you'll need is the cable itself. You can buy a null modem cable (or a null modem adapter that fits on the end of a standard serial cable) at almost any computer store for less than $20. Serial ports come with either 9-pin or 25-pin connectors, though, so make sure that you get a cable with ends that can plug into both computers. If your computers aren't located close together, you may find that a standard 6-foot or 10-foot null modem cable isn't long enough. FormGen sells a 30-foot head-to-head serial cable for about $35, with both 9-pin and 25-pin connectors on each end. Or, if you're handy with a soldering iron, you can easily make the cable yourself. All you need is two female D-shell connectors (25pin or 9-pin, depending on which connector your computer has) and some wire with at least three conductors (such as four-conductor telephone wire). The Transmit (pin 2) and Receive (pin 3) lines should be crossed, so that pin 2 of one connector goes to pin 3 of the other. The Ground line (pin 7) goes straight across from one connector to the other (see Figure 1). No special software is required for a direct serial connection, other than the game itself. Just run the game on both computers, and select the proper multiplayer option from the menu. Games like DUKE NUKEM 3D and Doom require you to run the Setup pro 10Base-T A network connection using UTP cable with RJ-45 connectors on each end. 10Base2 A network connection using coax cable with BNC connectors on each end. BNC A cylindrical connector with a bayonet mount. Coaxial cable (coax) A two-wire cable with an inner conductor surrounded by a braided shield, separated by a layer of plastic. Crossover cable A UTP cable in which a Transmit line on one end connects to a Receive line on the other. Used to connect two 10Base-T cards together directly, without going through a hub. Ethernet Hardware standard used by most network cards. Ethernet cards come in two speeds, 10 megabits per second (Mbps), and 100 Mbps. Hub A central device where each client machine, sometimes called a node, connects in a star-topology LAN. It acts as a traffic controller, routing information from one computer to another. IEEE 802.2 or 802.3 Ethernet frame types, which describe how information is sent over Ethernet networks. Novell NetWare 3.X networks generally use 802.3, while Netware 4.X networks use 802.2. IPX Internetwork Packet Exchange, the protocol used in Novell networks. LAN Local area network. NDIS Network Device Interface Specification. A device driver standard for Ethernet Ceds used by Microsoft networks, which allows multiple protected-mode network protocols to be used with the same card.

NetBIOS Protocol used by network operating systems such as Lantastic and some game titles. NIC Network interface card. An Ethernet NIC is usually an ISA card that plugs into your computer. Null modem A serial cable that crosses the Receive and Transmit lines, allowing a direct connection between the serial ports of two computers. ODI Open Datalink Interface: Novell's device driver standard for linking a network card to multiple protocols. Peer-to-peer A network in which each workstation can share its hard drive and printer with any other. Protocol An agreed-upon method for transmitting information. You can think of a protocol as the language\" a network speaks. RJ-45 A connector that resembles a modular phone connector, but is larger Stack A series of driver programs used to implement a protocol. Networks are built with layers of software, which insulate or abstract-an application from the hardware. Star-topology LAN A network in which each computer is connected via 10Base-T to a central hub. If any one station disconnects, all others remain connected. TCP/IP Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. Protocol used on most Unix networks and on the Internet. Terminator A 50 Ohm resistor pack that plugs into the T-connector on each end of a 10Base2 network. It prevents signals from being reflected back down the line, causing noise. UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair. A type of cabling that uses separate conductors for Transmit and Receive, twisted around each other. Used in 10-Base-T networks with RJ-45 connectors. SMCS LAPTOP CONNECTORS The PC card NIC (right) is the least expensive means of connecting a laptop to a network. It plugs into a PC card slot and accepts an RJ-45 or a BNC connection: the Linksys PC card shown accepts both connectors. If your laptop doesn't have a PC card slot, the parallel port ethernet adapter (left) is the alternative, but it's much more expensive.

"BUILD YOUR OWN GAME NET wigs example, that your network driver files live in a directory called C:INET and DUKE NUKEM 3D's game files are in C:\\DUKE3D. A DOS batch file to load the drivers and launch the network version of the game would look like this: for each Ethernet board. Newer boards let you tweak these settings from software. The default settings for many boards are IRQ 3 (which conflicts with COM 2) and a port address of 300 (which may conflict with wavetable sound cards). Before changing these settings, you should determine which port addresses and IRQs are free. In particular, check what IRQs your sound card, internal modem, and mouse use. If you're running Windows 95, you can use the System Properties window to help determine which IRQs are in use. Usually, IRO 10, 11, or 12 is free. Clicking the Input/Output radio button will give you a list of I/O port addresses in use. Once you've determined which IRQ and I/O addresses are free, go into DOS mode and run the board's configuration program. After you've set the IRQ and 1/0 addresses, the configuration program may allow you to test your hardware connection by actually sending data packets from one computer to the other. Once you're able to send packets, you're through with the hardware part of the job.

CD IDUKE3D SETUP REM Unload network drivers from memory IPXODI U CD ADD DRIVERS TO TASTE The next step is to set up and load the network drivers. Most com puter games require network drivers that are compatible with Novell NetWare, currently the most popular network operating system. Novell's main protocol for sending information down the wire is called Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX). If you look at the requirements listed on the package, you'll see that most games require an \"1PX net. work\" for multiplayer mode. The good news is that you don't have to install a complete Novell network, replete with file server, network file system, mail and all the rest. All you really need for gaming purposes are three small network driver programs, known as an IPX protocol stack and consisting of: LSL.COM: The Link Support Layer. NE2000.COM: The ODI (Open Datalink Interface) driver for your Ethernet card. (The name may be different, depending on your card The Maxtech NIC, for example, uses a driver called NIC2000.COM or NWMLID.COM.) IPXODI.COM: The ODI implementation of Novell's IPX protocol. The ODI driver file for your Ethernet card can be found on its installation disk, and you may find the other two drivers there as well. If not, you can download them in a file called VLMUP4.EXE on Novell's Web site (http://ftp.novell.com). Before you can load these drivers, you need to create a text file called NET.CFG, which provides some setup information. A sample NET.CFG file looks like this: Once you've used this batch file to load the network drivers and the program, select NETWORK GAME from the menu. You'll see a number of settings that you can change, including: Player Name: Select the name you'll use in the game, Number of Players: Every machine should show the total number of players connected. Network Socket Number: This number allows you to play the game on a network that has other traffic on it.

SMC LINK DRIVER NE2000 FRAME ETHERNET_802.3 INT 12 PORT 300 SL The IRQ and PORT info will be used by NE2000.COM Common protocol all players use Card Interrupt Card 10 Address common question about multiplayer games is how many copies of the software are required for network play. From a technical standpoint, the full game software should be installed on every computer on the network. From a legal standpoint, the general rule is that you are required to buy one copy of the game for each rig on the network. This is true even when you can install the full game from the CD and play without having the disc in the drive. In some cases however, game manufacturers grant a more liberal license. WARCRAFT || only requires one CD for every three players, and both COMMAND AND CONQUER and WEREWOLF VS. COMMANCHE come with two CDs, requiring only one game purchase for every two players. Games that require you to have the CD in the drive when you play them, however, almost always require a separate copy for each player. So before buying a multiplayer game, check with the manufac. turer to see how many copies you'll need to play legally on your game network Change this file to reflect your own setup. If your card uses a driver called NWMLID.COM, for example, replace the NE2000 entry with NWMLID. Be sure to place this file in the same directory as the driver programs. Before you start your game in multiplayer mode, you must load all three of these drivers, in the exact order listed above. Suppose, for CG SEPTEMBER 1996 "

When you've completed installing the drivers, you'll be prompted to restart your machine so the new settings can take effect. Once you've set up the software on all the computers and restarted them all, the names of the various peer machines appear when you click on the Network Neighborhood icon. You won't see any resources on these machines yet, because you haven't set up any drives for sharing. To enable sharing, open up the My Computer window, and right click on the icon of any drive you want to share. Select the Sharing item from the menu, and you'll see a Sharing properties tab (see Figure 5). Click on the Shared As button, and enter a name in the Share Name box (like \"C_Drive\" or \"CD-ROM\"). You can also select an access type: Read-Only, where others can read files, but not delete or change important system files; Full, where others can read and write; or Depends on Password, where you can enter one password for Read-Only access and another for Full access. Once you've shared a drive, its icon will change to include an outstretched hand, and the drive will now appear when you click on your computer in the Network Neighborhood window or on its entry in the Explorer window. You can follow the same procedure to share CD-ROM drives and printers. Once you've set up sharing on all of your computers, you can access network drives from your programs just as you access local drives. And you can use the Explorer window to drag files or directo ries from one computer to the other. If you've set up your Windows 95 network using Microsoft's IPX/SPX compatible protocol, you'll be able to play network games from a DOS window without loading IPX driver software first. This will only work if all rigs are running Windows 95. If some machines are using a DOS IPX protocol stack, they probably won't be able to communicate with the Windows 95 machines. In that case, you should reboot all the Windows 95 machines to DOS and run the same IPX driver stack on all computers. Another case where you may want to reboot to DOS is if you find your games running slower under Windows 95. Another very compelling reason to set up Windows 95's networking functionality is so you can play networked Windows 95-native games, many of which will soon be using Microsoft's DirectPlay Application Programming Interface (API), the networking part of the DirectX API family.

"LOYD CASE TECHNOLOGY techno LOCO Look Ma, Log No LANS! How To Play Multiplayer Games Over The Internet With Kali etwork gaming is one of the biggest technological develop ments of 1996. This issue, CGW explains how to set up a local area network (LAN) so you can take advantage of the increasing number of network-playable games. But setting up a network in your house is a complex endeavor. You need cables, network cards, multiple computers in one place and an understanding of how to get everything to work. If that sounds insurmountable, you should know that you can play most of the same multiplayer games via the Internet. You don't need a service like DWANGO or TEN to get a good game of WARCRAFT II or COMMAND & CONQUER going between you and your far-flung friends. The majority of multiplayer games use the IPX networking protocol (a protocol is the low-level description of how the data is broken apart, transmitted over the wire and reconstructed at the other end). Popularized by Novell, 1PX is a very common protocol supported by almost every PC networking card available. IPX is nice because it's relatively easy to configure by users-no worries about what your computer's address is or other arcane data. It's also mostly used on LANs, rather than the big, wide-area networks such as the Intemet. The Internet uses a completely different protocol, known as TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), taken from the Unix world. Let's take a closer look at the Internet, which is fast becoming the de facto method for communicating over a wide area. It's also dirt cheap these days, with a variety of large and small companies offering Internet connections with unlimited connect time for a scant 20 bucks a month (less in some cases). I was able to use Kali95 to find a ANYBODY OUT THERE? At first blush, it seems that the Internet would be an ideal environment for multiplayer gaming-except that most multiplayer games use IPX to communicate with other computers, not TCP/IP. Into this gap stepped Jay Cotton, who wrote the original version of Kali, which ran under good old MS-DOS. But Kali wasn't an ideal solution, because you had to be able to connect to your Internet account over DOS-110 mean task-and then configure Kali to talk to your DOS TCP/IP software. Although a lot of people, through sweat and swearing, managed to get the DOS version of Kali working, it wasn't a task for the faint-hearted. NETMECH game, launch NETMECH and find an active game-all with a few mouse clicks. LAB NOTES Scitech Display Doctor: UniVBE, from Scitech Software, has become something of a de facto standard in the game business for configuring SVGA graphics for a host of different graphics cards. Scitech Software, the creators of UniVBE, has renamed the product SciTech Display Doctor and released a new version, 5.2. Version 5.2 has some interesting features. It supports the VESA accelerator standards (only with ATI Mach64 cards currently), enabling some acceleration capability. It also supports the VESA 2.0 linear frame buffer mode, which allows much faster access to graphics memory. Scitech has added support for a large number of new cards, including the Diamond Edge and the upcoming 3D Blaster PCI, based on the Rendition Verité chip. Both of these accelerators are pretty slow DOS performers (although the 3D Blaster is very quick at DOS SVGA resolutions); Display Doctor now makes these much more respectable performers in the DOS arena. Display Doctor was on last 1 month's CGW demo disc, but you can also download it from the Scitech forum on CompuServe (GO SCITECH) or from their Web site, http://www I .scitechsoft.com.

Simple: Kali makes your Internet connection appear to be un 1PX connection to your game. This means that all those IPX games can now be played with a number of other users over the Internet. This is pretty heady stuff, but still not the most profound part of Kali. (Bear with me, I'll get to that soon.) Craphical environments, such as Windows 95 and OS2, however, make networking much easier. Most configuration is done with dialog boxes and pop-up menus.

The server responds by sending information that shows players what's happening in the game world: creation of a new entities (such as a bullet, a new player or a teleporter flash), sounds, items that are picked up, a door opening, etc. TECHNOLOGY TOO BIG FOR MULTIPLAY? E1L5, the Abyss, from DUKE NUKEM 3D, shows an interesting way to set up a huge level for multiplay. Weapons and health are concentrated at each end of the level, with special multiplay teleporters allowing players to zip back and forth without getting bogged down in the maze. DATA-JAM \"If you have eight people blasting away at each other in a small area, this can be a fair amount of data,\" says Cash. This quantity of data can add up to a real problem when you consider play over the Internet. The primary concem of designcrs is dealing with the latency of an Internet-based game. Any multiplayer game, whether it uses a direct link, a LAN or the Internet, must be able to handle the varying amount of time needed to get information from the client to the server and back to the client. This latency problem becomes magnified if you are playing contain information about the player's actions: movement, changes in heading (and facing, since you can side-step without changing your facing), and weapons In DOOM, information was constantly sent back and forth between all the computers in a given game. At any given moment, the \"game world\" in all the players' PCs would be nearly identical. Essentially, each PC was running the game fully, by sending out information and processing the inputs from all the other players. In some more arcane, dedicated multiplayer simulators, such as those used for military training, the peer-to-peer system is much more refined. Using a technique known as dead reckoning, the individual peers estimate the position of the other players in the environment, thereby cutting down on network traffic. \"We tried several variations on dead reckoning and were not able to find one that we were satisfied with,\" Cash says. «Although it's fine in many cases, the speed at which things change in QUAKE and the six degrees of freedom in movement cause dead reckoning to mispredict things by way too large a margin.\" QUAKE uses a client-server approach, so that only one PC, the game server, has a grasp of the entire game world. The server is generally the fastest computer in a LAN setup, or is a dedicated server for an online game experience. The clients are the PCs participating in the game. They send packets of data up to the server for processing and redistribution, which This is POLLY. POLLY ** A Sleep Goes \"bqqa\". Circle Reader Service #239 "

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA a TECHNOLOGY T.00 via the Internet and you use a modem to connect to your service provider. With round-trip data-travel times of 120 to 300 milliseconds, the server can process only several input changes each second, which is a significant limitation with a fluid action game such as QUAKE. \"Latency problems can be avoided for quite a few things,\" Cash says, «but there are unavoidable cases where you have to grin and bear it. The Internet is also extremely variable. It's one great big resource being shared by millions of people so there's no such thing as a constant (data flow).\" One advantage of QUAKE's clientserver design is that the game server can better handle the latency variances of the players. The server keeps the game running at top speed rather than slowing gameplay to the lowest common denominator -as happened in DOOM. \"If Player l has a low-quality Internet service provider and is getting really rotten play,\" says Cash, \"it does not affect Players 2 and 3 other than to give them a slowmoving target. The game goes on.\" THINK IN CIRCUITS This Duke Level I design follows Gray's simple rules. The level features several circuits that are quick to traverse.

There are so many limits, like the small maps, and the palette that's been cut down to a quarter, and the limited polygon counts on the monsters... Or do you want to hang back and work with a technology that delivers the best gameplay?

"Jurassic Lark fut. bar SCORPIA ADVENTURE/RPG ad ventun ks, fur. kare Scorpia Roams With The Dinosaurs in DINOTOPIA U violence or sexual matters; and Nathan is never in any really dangerous situations. tion urner Interactive's DINOTOPIA, based on the books Dinotopia and The World Beneath by James Gurney, is set on an luncharted island, where dinosaurs are intelligent and live side by side with humans. Unlike most adventure games these days, the story is rather modest. You're not out to retrieve secret plans, catch a scrial killer or save the universe. As Nathan, survivor of a Shipwreck, you just want to be reunited with your sister Constance, who washed up somewhere else on the island. The game thus revolves around Nathan's efforts to find her, with a little help from both humans and dinos. Everything in DINOTOPIA is very simple, which is not surprising, as this is a family-oriented product, aimed primarily at kids, although certainly playable by adults. The atmosphere is nonthreatening; the dinosaurs generally have a \"cute\" look to them; there is no strong language, MAKING TRACKS DINOTOPIA's interface can only be described as minimalist. At the start, there are only two cursor icons: a hand for picking things up, manipulating objects and talking to people, and dinosaur tracks for moving Nathan around the world. Later in the game, Nathan gains a dino companion, Atrick, and a third icon, an eye. becomes available. When the eye is clicked on an object or person, Atrick might comment on it, providing clues or information. Items are stored in a scrollable inventory box on the lower left of the screen, while at the bottom center is a picture of the island that you use to travel to new locations. In keeping with its kid-oriented focus, most of DINOTOPIA's puzzles are not hard to solve, and there aren't, in fact, many of them. Each location typically has one, or sometimes two, important things to do. For instance, the vital activity at the beginning is learning the language of Dinotopia, after which Nathan is able to travel around part of the island by dino cart. The game is partly linear, but not strictly so. Nathan can go to any available location at any time, so backtracking to, for example, a previous town to pick up a missed item is no problem. DINOTOPIA ran cleanly on my system; it never crashed, froze, locked up or exhibited bizarre graphics. There was one place where I ran into something that might be a bug (more on that shortly). Sound quality, however, was not all that good. The digital voice recordings were done at a very low level. Even with the volume bar at maximum for sound and minimum for music, I still had to turn up the volume on my speakers, the first time this has ever been necessary for a game with internal volume controls. This isn't so much a game as a Dinotopia travelogue. trave linguage of CRYSTAL BALL > Computer AD&D fans will have to wait a while for the first official AD&D role-playing game after SSI's DEATHKEEP. Interplay is working on two AD&D games, both of which have yet to be named, set for release in late 1997. The first will be set in Forgotten Realms and the second in the Planescape universe. After the success of BURIED IN TIME, Presto Studios has teamed up with Broderbund to publish the third game in the series, tentatively entitled JOURNEYMAN PROJECT 3. Presto has been working on the story for several months, and they've added staff to beef up their strategy of highly polished photorealistic graphics, good story, tough puzzles and a first-person perspective. This game also won't be released until the end of next year.  If you're depressed that Bullfrog's THE INDESTRUCTIBLES may be another year away-and you're really desperate-you should know that Inverse Ink has teamed with DC Comics to bring Superman and Batman to CD-ROM. No word on whether they have the guts to electronically publish Frank Miller's classic graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns. Her Interactive, flushed by the success of MCKENZIE & Co. has announced that their next game will be the VAMPIRE DIARIES. You bite, girl! SEPTEMBER 1996 "


"SCORPIA ADVENTURE/RPG The speech itself was uneven in playback. Sometimes, it came through clearly; other times, there was a lot of stuttering and skipping, making it very hard to hear what people or dinos were saying. For instance, the voice of the smith in Pumice Town played smoothly, with no breaks, whereas the speech of the two dinos who pulled the cart was only partly understandable. There was no reason I could discern for these differences, but it was certainly annoying, the more so as there is no option for text. This sound quality, by the way, was with native Gravis support. Unlike too many other products these days, DINOTOPIA has drivers for a wide range of sound cards, which at least puts the game in reach of a greater number of players. You don't have to worry about \"Sound Blaster and 100% compatibles only.\" DINOMOMIA SPARE CHANGE? In DINOTOPIA, people and dinosaurs walk the streets together. YOU TALKIN' TO ME? One of the things I found irritating in the game was the lack of conversation there are only monologues. Nathan himself, the star character, never speaks When you click on someone, that person says something, and that's that. I often had the feeling that Nathan was being lectured to instead of talking to people. everything went fine (not counting the many jumps I made to get the timing right). However, in my second pass through the game, the Skybax simply didn't move. Nathan dropped down the cliffside, while the dino remained, unmoving, at the far right. This was extremely puzzling, since had done all the correct actions to bring the creature over, and repeated plays and restores didn't help. However, when I booted up the game fresh the next day, and restored the position, everything worked perfectly the first try. The Skybax flew over, Nathan landed on its back, and that was that. So if you have similar problems, you may want to try exiting the game, rebooting your system and then running the game again to see if that helps. There are also parts of DINOTOPIA that are incredibly tedious. When you reach Alpine, you have to visit a monastery at the top of a mountain. So you go up the mountain. And up. And up. And....well, you get the idea. It appears to go on forever, with nothing to see except snow and pine trees, no one to talk to and nothing to do but walk on. The desert is much the same way. Here you have to lead a blind dino back home of course, you don't know where that home is, so you begin trudging across the sands. As with the mountain, there isn't much to see or do, and since this is a large area, walking around takes a long time. And because you don't want to lose the dino by going too quickly, you have to move slowly In real life, mountains may be tall and deserts large, but this is a game. Putting in wide expanses of essentially nothing does n ot add to fun or playability; it simply makes for a boring time. My general impression is that this isn't so much a game but a Dinotopia travelogue. A good deal of the world is mainly backdrop and window dressing. Waterfall City, for instance, has a lot of buildings, but only three that can be entered. The rest exist just to make the city look like a city. Only a few of the characters are relevant to the story; the majority either have nothing to say or make some inconsequential remark that may shed some light on Dinotopia generally but otherwise doesn't mean a lot. DINOMORIA A LITTLE PRIVACY, PLEASE! We don't know what this dinosaur is doing-and we don't want to know. KID STUFF Overall, DINOTOPIA, with its emphasis on exploration, easy puzzles, simple interface and generally laid-back atmosphere is most suitable for the young novice gamer who has little or no experience with adventures. Veteran gamers, and kids who have already played the likes of RIPPER OG PHANTASMACORIA, may find this one too simple, and a bit dull. The place where there might be a transicnt bug is at the cliffs. Here Nathan has to jump off at the right moment and land on the back of a flying clino called a Skybax. The first time through the game, CG SEPTEMBER 1996 "

"SCORPION'S TALE ADVENTURE/RPG Impossible Mission? Scorpia Disavows Any Problems In Defusing Mission CRITICAL I FEEL A Draft o here we are coming out of another dry summer, and looking forward to all those Christmas releases that usually begin showing up around now.

That's the critical factor for me. And speaking of critical...MISSION CRITICAL is one of the better things Legend has done in recent times (even if the game itself isn't very hardl). There's a logical (if grim) reason for being alone on a spaceship that's in big trouble, and since it is in trouble, let's get right to it After watching the extensive opening movie, which explains why you're here and why the ship is in the condition it is, you begin the game standing in a corridor of the abandoned Lexington, with nothing main computer is offline. Aside from that, everything is more or less OK. While time seems to be precious here, you do have more than is apparent. There's no need to be too nervous about the situation, but on the other hand, you don't want to dawdle too much, either. Fixing the hull puncture is the first order of business, if only to reduce the noise level (heh). This is a simple matter, once you get your hands on the patch kit. f you're having trouble finding things in Mission CRITICAL, keep in mind that the game progresses very logically. In addition to the usual puzzles, there are important audio and visual clues. For example, you can find the hull breach on deck 2 simply by listening to the breeze. As the noise level goes up, you're getting closer; as it recedes, you are losing the trail. but a note from the captain in your pocket. This is a good time to read it and follow the directions.  r ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE You can then listen to Tran's recorded message about the state of the ship. Let's see: There's a hull puncture on deck 2, the reactor is heading for meltdown, and the Look at Take Open RADIATION LEAKS CAN MAKE YOU PULL YOUR HAIR OUT Then you can begin making your way down to Engineering to work on the reactor. Go down one deck at a time (skip deck 4, which has nothing accessible), looking in all rooms you can, picking up everything you can, and remembering to open any storage cabinets you come across. As far as I could tell, there is no limit to what you can have in inventory. You won't be able to make it directly to Engineering: there's a leak in the system and the elevator won't go down there. That means you have to reach the deck the bard way, by going through the maintenance corridors from Reactor Spaces. There's radiation in some of those corridors, too, and you don't have a radiation suit. So we'll hope you do have something else that will guide you along a safe path to Engineering. Once you fix the reactor, you can take the clevator back up.) Dealing with the reactor is a simple matter. You only need to position the gates so the coolant from the backup tank flows in a complete circuit through the reactor core. Just remember that this is a manual backup system, so the tank has to be physically opened first Now that the ship is safe (for the CH Take the Hun Pacch Kit IS IT STUFFY IN HERE?

"REVIEWD DIFFICULTY LEVEL o Gets An F 90871LNINJAGV Acclaim's Real-Time Murder Mystery Is Two Hours Too Long by Mark Clarkson FEEL LUCKY, PUNK? Redefining the low end in bedside manner, the good doctor in D gets ready to blow your head off. alk about bad news from home. Laura is settling in for another semester at college when she receives word that her father-a respected doctor, scientist and director of the Los Angeles National Hospital has gone berserk, shooting people in the halls of the hospital and taking hostages. Our heroine scoots up to LA. where the police let her past the barricades and into the hospital. The hallways are littered with bodies-more so than usual — but before she can look for her dad, some evil relative of the water tentacle from The Abyss swallows her and whisks her off to another dimension Welcome to D, where, according to the box, \"solving the mystery means visiting the dark pit of your soul.\" I wish could report a D-lightfully frightening good time, but, other than enjoying the game's creepy ambience, I was D-cidedly dissappointed. You'll recognize elements of a lot of games in this first-person horror adventure Mysr, THE 7TH CUEST, PHANTASMACORIA, THE DARK EYEevery one of which is far superior. The game takes place in a \"house\" which supposedly exists inside Laura's wacky dad's head. If this is Dad's mind, it's pretty sparsely furnished, and you'll find few clues here as to what's going on. You'll confront the occasional gratuitous logic puzzle, but most of D's secrets involve finding the keys to various locked doors (yawn). you lose or stop, you have no recourse but to start the game over again. Two hours is an awfully short time to solve a mystery of any complexity, but since Disn't a mystery of any complexity, you'll be running out of game in about two hours anyway. I discovered no way to die in D, or any way to lose at all short of letting the two hours expire. In fact, Laura seems virtually indestructible; I/she fell down a 30-foot well and landed on the stone floor at least a dozen times. Each time, she stood up, shook her head, slowly brushed dust from her lapels and climbed out of the well. I, on the other hand, was going to scream if I had to watch her go through that tedious routine one more time. That's another big problem with D: movement through the game is painfully slow. Laura walks everywhere slowly, carefully, as befits the heroine in a creepy movie. That wouldn't bother me much if there was some way to skip past scenes you've already walked through, or if you weren't in such a hurry to solve the puzzles for the third time so you didn't have to start the darned game over again. The combination of a time limit, no save game feature and a plodding pace is especially maddening The plot, when it finally unfolds, is terribly lame. The ending fails to throw much light on the beginning, while the actual game, sandwiched in between, has little to do with either one of them. I found out what the \"D\" stands for, but Other than that, I was left scratching my head, muttering \"Huh?\" Any quasi-experienced adventurer will finish this game by the second or third try. That makes for a whole four to six hours of gameplay, most of which is spent walking slowly through a house. According to the box, D sports multiple endings, but you'll have to take Acclaim's word for it. With no way to save your game, the only way to experience multiple endings is to go back to the very beginning and play the entire game over, trying different things here and there to see if they affect the ending.

Whether you play a head-to-head duel via modem or engage in one of the numerous 16-player slaughterfests hosted all over the Intemel, the path to the biggest grins is paved with everyone else's body parts. There's little doubt you're in a hurry to make as much progress along that murclerous path as possible. So here is a glimpse of how I whip through my buddies like a hurricane. Elite DeathGUN CONTROL Ever notice in DOOM or (TEST (the public QUAKE\"engine test\"), how you'd effortlessly hit whatever was in front of your gun? Well, QUAKE is a lot more realistic: no more auto-aiming, so the farther away the target, the more difficult it is to hit. By whatever means, learn to hit the bull's-eye-especially when it runs around and shoots back. It might help to type \"CROSSHAIRI\" at the console to activate Crosshair mode.

Although the Ring of Shadows power-up provides complete invisibility (except for your eyeballs), you can also find excellent concealment in the deep shadows generously sprinkled throughout QUAKE. Avoid crossing open spaces, and stay close to the walls. The 3D nature of QUAKE underscores the importance of spotting threats from above and below. Accordingly,\"freelook,\" the ability to look up and down, is invaluable. You'll need freelook to blow snipers out of their perches overhead, as well as to safely negotiate water and low-gravity environments. Although freelook is available using either keyboard and mouse, it's most intuitive with the latter («mouselook»). Mousclook lets you look in all directions fluidly-which is absolutely vital to rapid target acquisition and superior accuracy. MULTIPLE TELEFRAGS Oh, the bloodthirsty joy of a 16-player frenzy in which the telefrags just keep coming. Stay off the telepads or risk being snuffed. This is what flight-sim jocks call deflection shooting. If your shots miss, try more lead. Keep at it until you see red pixels spray over your target-that indicates a clirect hit. Don't get trigger happy though. Use short, controlled bursts, even for cover fire, Better yet, develop the steely nerves required to hold your fire until the right moment; this will ultimately earn you more frags than you can imagine. Take a tick longer to aim carcfully, particularly with the double-barrel shotgun or grenade launcher, and... blammo! You've bagged another frag.

"STRATEGY  QUAKE DEATHMATCH DeathMatch 101: TheBasics ACTION o matter how good you are at beating up monsters solo or cooperatively, expect an entirely different beast when you play against fellow humans. Burn these basics into your brain so you can do unto your playmates before they do unto you:  Never stop moving, and always run. This makes you a much more challenging target. Simply toggle on the Always Run option in the menu. Even if someone spots you, you won't be easy to hit. Flee when necessary. Staying alive is a prerequisite to earning frags, as well as of depriving your enemy of another notch on his belt.  Learn the level. Know where you are and where you're going, so you can hit the ground running as soon as you spawn on a level. You want to beat everyone else to the power-ups, which often require extended trips through slime. (Be sure to grab that Bio-Suit before diving in.) Beware of potential ambush points and kill zones; other dangerous spots include teleport destinations. If you've done your homework, you'll know the places to avoid. Also, being able to recognize telltale sounds from different parts of the level gives you information about where the other players are. Help the Quake environment beat up on other players. Pump some lead into a radioactive container and watch the resulting conflagration clear the entire room. Blast someone into the molten pools for a permanent visit to the lava gods. Follow your prey into a teleporter and hope for the splat of a successful tele-frag. Scavenge for frags. If you happen upon a firefight in progress, hang back and pick off the survivors. We affectionately call these buzzard kills, but hey, a frag is a frag. Or better yet, don't even bother waiting for survivors: go for all the frags by lobbing in a generous helping of fireworks. Use the mouse, the controller of choice by everyone at id Software. Although the keyboard is easier to learn initially, the mouse lets you perform advanced maneuvers and use mouselook (the ability to look in all directions fluidly)  Practice, practice, practice! 'Nuff said. Match mastery: Proficiency with the mouse maximizes your potential to shoot accurately while evadling enemy fire. \"Circle-strafing\" (circling around a target while shooting it) is the fundamental maneuver-all DeathMatch experts excel at it. It's not loo difficult to leam: Point your gun at the target, sidestep (using keys) in one direction, and turn (using the mouse) in the other direction to keep on target. For example, to circle right, you sidestep right while turning left. Properly executed, this manuever lets you sweep around the target faster than he can turn to snap off a good shot at you. Tim Willits, an id level designer and cutthroat DeathMatcher, has his own variation, which I call the broken circlestrafe.\" It's a circle-strafe made up of approximately four or five abrupt stopand-go ares. Willits accomplishes this by using the default Doom mouse configuration (mouse button 3 = strafe). It keeps his left hand free for sandwiches and is cleadly enough to get him called various foul names during DeathMatches at id. The key to circle-strafing is properly coordinating the turn with the sidestep.

Although it's best to finish off your frags one at a time, the chaos that permcates DeathMatch frequently makes it necessary to take on multiple adversaries. A combo good for taking two targets is \"Mobius strafe,\" which looks like a figure eight encircling the two targets. It consists of circle-strafing one player until you reach a point between him and the other player, where you suddenly over-rotate your tum by about 180 degrees and begin a circle-strafe in the opposite direction. My favorite mouse maneuver is also the most obnoxious and therefore gratifying-way to slap another player across the face.

CM5000's greatest attribute, though, is the variety of computer opponents based on styles of Grandmasters past and present. Here, you can see how that neverplayed match between the classic style of Fischer and the bold, adventurous play of Kasparov might really turn out, or simply pit your own style against «Spassky\" or \"Karpov.\" Over 70 CM styles are included, from the eccentric Bird to the nervous Nimzovitch, with the opening books for cach specifically tuned to accentuate that player's particular style. Adolf Anderssen's flair is unmistakable, as he attempts to ensnare your pieces in wild, attacking King's Cambits. Capablanca elegantly simplifies to a superior endgame, while Alekhine tries to complicate even the CHECK! Mindscape has rather ambitious plans to bring CHESSMASTER 5000 online, and part of this scheme is already up and running. Anyone who enjoys a bit of pawn-pushing should visit http://www. chessmasternetwork.com, which (if you can manage to type it in correctly) is one of the best gaming Web sites we've seen. California State Chess champion and National Master Curt Schilling is a frequent contributor, as is the president of the California Chess Association. One of the more controversial threads currently running is a list of the top 10 Chess Masters of all time. In addition to the expected pull for Bobby Fischer, there is a surprising amount of support for Tigran Petrosian. Whether or not you recognize the names, drop in. The comments are well informed and far more civil than on many gaming Web sites SEPTEMBER 1996 CG "


"TERRY COLEMAN CLASSICS & PUZZLES Normally. one of the best ways to improve your play isn't simply to play lightning-speed chess. But there's an exception: play \"Dr. Pepper\" Chess of \"10-2-4\" instead. Give yourself 10 minutes for the entire game, and a stronger computer opponent only 2 minutes, then play a four-game match, alternating colors. Save your games and use the CM5000 auto-annotator feature to find flaws and improve your play. When you reach the point where you're winning the majority of these games, give yourself only 5 minutes until you can tackle the computer on a equal-time footing. Then move on to a tougher opponent. If you're having trouble making headway against the Grandmaster personalities, try turning off the computer's opening book. Warning: This will not work as well against the Morphy or Capablanca styles, which depend more on natural moves than hardcoded \"memorization.\" If you've taken the full install option, it isn't strictly necessary to have the CD-ROM in the drive to play a game. But the program does check for the CD before loading, so that you can use the opening library editor, etc. If you have another CD, such as an audio CD, in the drive, the program won't load. So wait to load your \"Ferrante & Teicher's 10 Great Chess Themes\" until after you've launched CM5000. You really need at least a Pentium 90 to get the full use of the program, and we recommend at least 16 MB of RAM. most quiet position. Morphy's pieces seem to effortlessly find just the right squares to maximize their mobility. Fischer, it seems does everything well. If you somehow manage to tire of these opponents (more than six dozen), you can design your own, adjusting such attributes as playing strength, mobility, control of the center, King safety, and how the computer player values cach piece. Advanced players will find that while the CM styles may lack the endgame savvy of a real-life Fischer or Capablanca, the endgame Al is improved over that of CM4000.

One of the few weaknesses in CM5000 is the rating system for human players. You can play game after game against quality competition, yet the only way the program rates your progress is in how you match moves from classic CM games in a quiz format. If you were a poor student, but knew Capablanca's games, you would be rated higher by the computer than you deserve-setting you up for some disappointment in live play against a correctly rated human. On the plus side, the tutorials are much improved over CM4000; they forma library of sorts that takes you from the simplest rules of Chess to intermediate concepts such as open files and the importance of the 7th rank.

I do. In fact, it seems wasted an entire decade of sports gaming playing ho-hum games like baseball, football, basketball and ice hockey. Just recently, though, I was rebom. The blessed event took place at about 190 MPH on the steep-banked curves of Talladega Super Speedway. I was driving in Papyrus Software's NASCAR RACING LEACUE prototype, which is an online, multiplayer competition.

"DENNIS MCCAULEY SPORTS Like Colorado's Coors Field, HARDBALL 5 is a batter's paradise. Would-be Nolan Ryans playing the game should try the following strategies to improve their stuff. >Before pitching to each batter, view the back of the player's card by hitting the Backspace button twice, and then check out the batter's contact and power ratings. If the batter has low contact ratings and high power ratings you are probably OK to pitch to him as long as your pitcher's stamina is high. The more fatigued your pitcher is, the more likely it is that even poor contact hitters are going to hit the ball. Also, pay attention to your opposition's batting order. If first base is open in a tight ballgame and the current batter has good contact and power ratings, check out the batter on deck. If he's deficient in either category, select Strategy-Intentional Walk to walk the slugger and pitch to the weaker player. length and the skill level. Want some free advice? Don't sign up for a race at an unfamiliar speedway. At best you'll be cating the dust of the leaders. At worst your car will end up in little pieces. Keep an eye on the length of the race, too. Most are set up for either 5 or 10 percent of actual course laps. Occasionally, however, an ambitious driver may propose an even longer race. The choice is yours, but the additional laps can be tedious if you drop belind. Most important is the skill setting Newbies start Hawaii at Level, and work their way up with solid outings. The game won't permit players to enter races beyond their abilities, but open races usually show wide deviation in driver skill levels. Anyone logged onto the system can \"nominate\" a race. Players who've signed up for an event wait in a chat room until sufficient slots are filled. Hawaii then automatically fires up the copy of NASCAR on your system, and drivers go through the usual practice and qualification stages. Warm-ups are abbreviated, however, lasting only long enough for lastminute adjustments before the cars move to the starting line. At the cliscretion of the permitted to race on courses already installed on their home systems. Judging from a recent weekend I surrendered to the Hawaii prototype, Talladega and Atlanta seem to be the most popular speedway choices. 'Dega, of course, appeals to speed demons, since you never have to take your foot off the gas. Not quite as fast, Atlanta nonetheless offers a challenging 1.5 mile course. Hawaii is a great spot for organized play as well, a fact that has not escaped a number of online racing associations. For the true NASCAR buff, what could be better than participating in an entire championship season using actual NASCAR tracks and racing against a couple dozen equally obsessed drivers? Hawaii's sclup allows password-protecting race entry, so a club can easily schedule races and then limit access to members. Drivers can chat as well as drive during a race. Since it's a near impossibility to simultaneously type and control the car, Hawaii includes eight preset messages activated by function keys. These can be edited to suit the player's needs and temperament. Accidents typically elicit nasty responses from the victims, and inept drivers will find they can run but can't hide from their angry competitors. Trash talki ng is fairly common too, so pack a thick skin along with your racing gear.. Give the crew at Papyrus major points for Hawaii's polish. The system juggles dozens of users and integrates seamlessly with NASCAR. In several hours online over the course of a week, I had no problems either getting or staying connected. Hawaii nins NASCAR in either VGA or SVGA, at the user's discretion. While both look good, SVGA makes reading car numbers much easier. This is a big help when you need to identify Mr. Clueless. You know the guy who tried to pass you in the tri-oval, and left both your cars scattered from here to Daytona. What's that they say about paybacks? may or may not be a pace lap. NASCAR purists tend to insist on one, while Type-A drivers prefer a quick green flag The Hawaii server supports every track included on NASCAR and the Track Pack expansion kit, but gamers are only Qualifying Grid f you want to drive the NASCAR RACING LEAGUE prototype while it lasts, a few preliminaries are required. First you'll need to own a copy of NASCAR RACING. Next, download the self-extracting HAWAII.EXE from Sierra's web site (http://www.sierra.com). Run the file and follow the installation instructions. After that, all that's needed is a cool head, a hot car setup, and a stomach for long distance charges to Boston. Sadly, at press time there were no local dial-ups for Hawali, and your Internet connection just doesn't provide the oomph required to keep pace with NASCAR's intense graphical environ ment. In technical terms this is due to NASCAR's demand for low latency. In layman's terms this translates to big phone bills. since that's what you'll be getting once Hawaii hooks you and reels you in. And hook you it will. The first time you find your self among a pack of brightly painted Fords and Chevys running full out at 'Dega, or sliding around the curves at Martindale, it's all over. You might as well sell your other games. Keep the modem, though. You're gonna need it when the final version of Hawaii goes online, CRASH COURSE Crashes-automobile, not computcr-are common on Hawaii -perhaps too common. Typically there's at least one pilcup on the opening lap of a crowded field, especially if inexperienced users are in the race. While veteran drivers find this maddening, it does tend to thin the herd a bit. Also, there's a scary sort of rush in trying to weave your way through a wreckage-strewn course at close to 200 MPH. Worse are the crashes in which one of the lack markers accidentally takes out a passing leader late in the race. And worst of all is the occasional jerk who logs on for the sole purpose of causing as many wrecks as he can. FINISH LINE So where is Papyrus going with all this? Considering the recent agreement that parent company Sierra signed with NASCAR to form an entity called the NASCAR Racing League (NRL), it seems pretty clear that the free ride won't last forever. Factor in the planned release of NASCAR 2 later this year, and you can bet that bigger and better things are in store for online racers. & CG SEPTEMBER 1996 "

"SNEAK PREVIEW  ABC'S MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL SPORTS Ready For Some Football? ABC'S MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IS A Pigskin Celebration by Terry Coleman CSNEAK CPREVIEW t's a hot, muggy evening-the temperature in the mid 80s, the humidity typically high for this seaside sports town. This is Frank Gifford coming to you from Hunt Valley, Maryland, as we take a look at OT Sports and their first game, ABC's MONDAY NICHT FOOTBALL. We've been looking forward to this one for a long time, as we trust you have. Now here's Al.\" \"Thanks, lank. Tonight we look at a talented, experienced team with members going all the way back to the venerable COACHES CLUB FOOTBAL., one of GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT portend? Can the additional funding and new marketing muscle translate into a winning season? And what about this being a Windows 95-only product? Here's Dan with a look at the match-ups.\" \"Thanks, Al. When you talk about computer sports football, you have to talk about FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL Pro. Even though Pat Cook and company have won the CCW sports crown three of the last four years, they really showed their age last year. Sierra can't continue to hide their vulnerabilities behind a graphic smokescreen if they expect to hold off the OT Sports guys. And what about EA Sports? Are they running scared with their perennial vaporware, MADDEN NFL. 97? Frankly, the only other legitimate contender is Accoladle's NFL LECENDS. It seems the time is right for OT Sports to make its move. And besides, MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL has us for announcers. How can it lose?\" This has the potential to be real professional football, or at least as close as the average fan can get to it. The main intcrface screen is a marvel. As you move your mouse over each of the windows, audio is automatically triggered. Everything from 1995 NFL Films close-ups of your favorite pro team-say, Miami Dolphins QB Dan Marino breaking the all-time 'ID pass record to the highlights from the game you are currently playing, are available with just a mouse click OT Sports deserves a lot of credit for taking chances. Instead of having AI, Frank and Dan play it safe with vanilla commentary, the designers cncouraged them to approach the voice-overs as though they were calling the actual game. While last-minute trades may result in some gaffes, it's worth it. Nothing captures the feeling of watching a Monday night game more beautifully than listening to Al's dulcet tones describing Emmitt Smith plunging for a crucial first down, Frank setting the stage for the confrontation, or Dan criticizing a questionable call. All you need is popcom and the bevcrage of your choice-it's better than 'IV. Kordell Stewart Quarterback Height 6' 3\" Weight 210 Years.

GET IT KICK-STARTED The familiar hom riffs form their circular, staccato counterpart to video clips of wide receivers defying gravity to catch touchdown passes with their fingertips. Hank Williams Jr. bursts onto your monitor with a bevy of voluptuous females to spark an undeniable party atmosphere, belting out the famous theme song. And sure enough, Al Michaels, Dan Dierdorf and Frank Gifford are right there to lend commentary and play-by-play. There's little doubt that an American institution has found its way to CD-ROM, in style. ABC'S MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL is a far cry from the tame multimedia shenanigans of ABC NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL, to name but one example. PLAY-BY-PLAY Of course, all this multimedia won't matter if the game can't follow the blocks and hit the hole. In the game, as in real life, some things are obvious: Pittsburgh is likely to have quarterback woes this year; Emmitt Smith will rush for a lot of touchdowns; Deion Sanders is an all-world cornerback. Even in this early version, I was able to play several games with multiple outcomes, all of which were reasonable, given the teams' various strengths and weaknesses.

"SNEAK PREVIEW  ABC'S MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL SPORTS cheat codes are advised to get their pigskin fix elsewhere; MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL rewards those who understand football. For example, QBs are rated for their ability to roll out to the right or left. This nicely simulates the differences between Steve Young and Dan Marino without a lot of complicated rules. And unlike a similar system in the old ULTIMATE FOOTBAL, it works. The huge playing field gives you a quarterback's-eye view of the defense, so that you can read the deep zone coverage, note the blitzers, and take appropriate action. The actual plays you call are depenclent upon your team's playbook, which includes an editor, so you can create your own custom plays. This is simple to use, as it follows standard Windows 95 Explorer conventions. Essentially, the game system assumes that the coaching staff calls plays in to the huddle for each formation-very close to the real thing. This may sound limiting, but it isn't. MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL has the most robust system for calling audibles yet: Simply click and pull to adjust a receiver's route, change the hole the runner hits and pull the lead blocker closer to the point of contact. You can even change blocking assignments. As you create new plays and variations on old ones, just save your plays-such are the advantages of Win 95 gaming Thus, Kordell \"Slash\" Stewart can play both quarterback and wide receiver, plus field goal holder, without disrupting the game system. Additionally, you can modify the stats if you feel that Aikman's arm is losing its zip, or if Brett Favre's endurance is likely to diminish without painkillers. Our advice is not to tweak too much, because the player ratings are provided by Stats, Inc., the people who invented \"yards after catch\" and other such down-and-clirty statistics. As if all this were not enough, there are Infinite Audibles CALL PLAY Standard Pro Heavy One Back Three+WR Historical Run Shoot Special Teamt Fal I-Formation Nex Sholgun Slot Split Trips CGW learned just prior to press time that OT Sports is close to singing a deal with Dwango. Dwango feels that it has the latency problem licked so much, in fact, that you would be able to play MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL in action mode. We'll keep you posted. FORMATION SMORGASBORD Choose your favorite formation flavor from today's dozens of combo specials. Play Calling RUN PASS DRAW SCREEN PUNT KICK TRICK BACK IN THE POCKET Make no mistake, MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL is an action game. The scoring tends to be a little high, but every game won't end up 41-38. Whereas most action games are 90 percent reflexes and 10 percent stats, MNF tends toward a more even balance. So you can't take your third-string receiver and catch 10 straight passes against the likes of Rod Woodson or Aencas Williams. In fact, until you touch the joystick, the computer controls all of the players on the field during each play. The game is quite playable in coaching mode, but it's admittedly more fun as an action game once you get the controls down. And in a major coup for OT Sports, this will be not merely the first but one of the only major computer football releases this fall to include modem play: Yancey Thiopen S AVE PLAY CALL PLAY Standard Pro INSERT FORK Then avoid a nasty blitz aftertaste by sending your receiver on one of 14 audibled pass routes a host of trick plays included, so that you can repeat Marino throwing the Flea Flicker, Jerry Rice tooling left on a flanker reverse, or Steve Bono's unlikely 70-yard quarterback draw. Late in the game, you might feel audacious enough to try an all-out block of a punt. The list goes on and on. So the question remains: Will MONDAY NICHT FOOTBALL. be a hit? The talent's obviously there at OT Sports, and they're clue a division title. The graphic look has all the pieces, provided the coaching staff puts it together in time for the season. And the plan to have the game on the shelves in September has the guys putting in a lot of extra time in training camp. The game has the advantage of being the first on the block with the '96 season players and teams. Can the intuitive interface overcome the leather-helmet offense of NFL LEGENDS and the late-season blitz of defending champion FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO? If so, we could see a new champ come January AMAL HO. STEA TWIST KNIFE Finally, rub salt in the wound. Go to the multimedia screen and watch your completed pass on replay. Mix well.

"REVIEW  TONY LA RUSSA BASEBALL 3: 1996 EDITION SPORTS DIFFICULTY LEVEL Power Hitter Humble Yet Strong, TONY LA RUSSA 3 '96 Slams One Out Of The Park by Jeff Green static screen: no matter who's playing, you're always looking at the same two images, both wearing the number II. The playing controls are harder to master than those in games like HARDBALL, and fielding and base running is so tough that after screwing up enough plays you'll probably just want to let the computer cover it for you. Hitting the ball is also difficult, but again, whether this is good or bad depends on your perspective. When you mode, where you can indulge in the kind of minute, strategic decision-making that is at the heart of this game. The best improvement is the inclusion of head-tohead batter/pitcher statistics and situational batting stats (such as how well a player does on the road, at night, etc.) that can really help you out when you're tweaking your batting orders and pitching rotations. Now when you're playing a game, you can call up a screen that will show you how the current batter and hithere is no shortage of showboats in the world of sports. from megalomaniacal NFL stars jiggling their overpaid tushies in the end zone because they finally eamed their paycheck, to NBA stars strutting and trash-talking their way down the court there's a lot of athletes out there who never tire of beating their chests and proclaiming to the world how great they are. But for every Deion Sanders or Dennis Rodman (to name two random players), there's a low-key, no-nonsense athlete who goes out there day after clay and, with little pomp and circumstance, gets the job done. In the world of computer baseball simulations, such a game is TONY LA RUSSA BASEBALL 3: 1996 Edition. While the makers of the new crop of baseball games are all busy flapping their arms and doing their Supcrior Dance about how theirs is the ultimate in ultra-realistic, 3D baseball action, TONY LA RUSSA 3, with none of the graphic bells and whistles of its competitors, is quietly proving itself to be perhaps the best pure baseball simulation of them all. #19 RF AVG .262 SA .566 HR 40 RBI 121 PER JOHNNY WILSON FLASH IN THE PAN TONY LA RUSSA's graphics, state-of-the-art just a year ago, are now starting to look a little crude next to the competition. Price: $39.95 System Requirements: 486-66 or better, DOS 5.0, 8 MB RAM, 11 MB hard disk space (58.5 MB for full installation). SVGA graphics adapter, 2x CD-ROM drive, Microsoft-compatible mouse, supports most major sound cards, joystick optional Protection: None (CD must be in drive) Developer: Stormfront Studios San Rafael, CA A SWING AND A MISS For the 1996 Edition, Stormfront has significantly updated the game's statistical capabilities, but has not touched the graphics or interface at all. Depending on your bias, of course, that's either good or bad news. The bottom line, graphics-wise, is that TONY LA RUSSA 3 96 is now woefully out-of-date compared to its flashier cousins, HARDBALI 5, FRONT PACE SPORTS BASEBALL 96 and TRIPLE PLAY 97. If your main concern is state-of-theart visuals and immersive arcade action, shop elsewhere. When playing a game, both pitcher and batter are nicely rendered, but it's a consider that the greatest hitters in the major leagues only hit the ball a little belter than 3 out of 10 times, 'TLRB3 is much closer to reality than arcade-based games that consistently let you connect on the first pitch.

"DENNY ATKINSIMULATION/SPACE 960 UDBUTTO Padlocking The Future in altes Breaking Out The Crystal Ball And Forecasting The Future Of Sims puters, the sim world today doesn't look dramatically different than it did this time last year. That's going to change, though. The promised PC renaissance is still on the way, it's just arriving a bit more slowly than we expected. When it finally takes hold, look for sims to arrive that will make today's games look positively primitive. The ugust, 1995. Windows 95 is released and the face of the simulation world changes forever. The days of sound card and video card configuration, of locating VESA drivers, of prerying for support for the more esoteric sim peripherals on your system, are past. Now getting started with a new simulation is as easy as popping a CD into your computer and watching it automatically loud. DOS is dead forever. In an alternate universe, perhaps. Our reality is one where most of the sim action is still taking place under MS-DOS, where the few Win 95 simulations are ports or minor enhancements of DOS games. Other than the usual faster comThe Pentium isn't dead yet, but its days are numbered. adopt by 1998 to stay current Chief among the upcoming changes is the microprocessor. Intel has wrung nearly all the performance out of the current Pentium design that it can. Our testing showed 200-MHz Pentium chips are a mere 10 to 15 percent faster than their 166-MHz brethren, and that's with the addition of other high-speed components such as SDRAM memory. With the motherboard running at a relatively poky 66-MI Iz maximum speed, souping up the chip's internal clock speed any further has diminishing retums. The Pentium's not dead yet, though. The new MMX Pentium chips will start to HARD CHOICES As always, the most dramatic changes will come in the area of hardware. I you're a dedicated flight, space, or racing sim fan, you've probably come to terms with the expensive reality that you need to replace your system every two or three years to get the horsepower necessary to run the hottest software. We're entering another cycle of hardware upgrades now, Look for new standards to hit in 1997 for the early adopter crowd-standards that the mainstream sim players will have to ON THE RADAR Our ultra-sensitive Internet worms have picked up a hint that Thrustmaster has another cool project in the works-a device to better take advantage of the mode in sims like FALCON 4.0 and BACK TO BAGHDAD that allows you to show one of your MFDs (MultiFunction Displays) on a monochrome monitor. If you don't have an old Hercules card gathering dust, ThrustMaster may have a solution on the way. Dlf your tastes tend more towards the historical, you'll want to check out Grolier's upcoming BATTLE OF THE IRONCLADS. This naval simulation set during the War Between the States puts you at the helm of the highest-tech vehicles available at the time-the Monitor and the Merrimac-for both historical and \"what-if\" missions. If the Al is up to snuff, this Civil War ironclad sim will be a welcome respite from the frantic pace of modern combat. History buffs will find it worth the purchase for the beauti| fully-executed QuickTime VR tours of the ships-especially since the real things are still sitting under water. BATTLE OF THE IRONCLADS SEPTEMBER 1996 "


"DENNY ATKIN SIMULATION/SPACE addition of MMX instructions and better support for running older 16-bit code. By late 1997 we expect the upgraded Pentium Pro to be the chip of choice for performance-hungry sim fans. The next most significant change is one that, happily, won't require you to replace your entire system. I've seen carly Alpha versions of flight simulations that take advantage of the second-generation 3D chips from Rendition and 3dfx, and I was absolutely blown away. Once you've flown a sim on a system equipped with good 3D carcl, going back to standard SVGA is like watching a cartoon. Be warned that it's a little early to make this jump, though. The first-generation 3D chips such as S3's Virge and ATTs 3D Rage are based on older 2D designs, and while they provide some impressive texture and filtering effects, they don't provide the 3D speedup of the ground-up designs. year. Mind you, they're a lot of fun to use, but until the resolution reaches at least 640x480 at prices lower than the current low-res units, they just can't replace your monitor. But don't think you're through buying new hardware yet. I'm going to be first in line for a force-feedback joystick when they hit the market in coming months. You haven't experienced flying a sim until you find yourself overspeed in a dive and your joystick fights you as you attempt to pull up. Once you've used a force-feedback stick, older designs seem positively flaccid. VIVID NIGHTMARES FLYING NIGHTMARES 2 will be one of the first sims to try to entice you to buy a 3-D card-dropping one in your system will yield dramatic textured graphics at resolutions up to 1024x768. appear in coming months, and will give the design one final performance boost. These chips should help the speed of even older simulations, thanks to their bigger 32K internal Ll caches. But the strongest boost will come for sims that take advantage of the new MMX instructions, which can considerably speed graphics manipulations on systems withiout 3-D hardware.FALCON 4.0's developers report a 30 percent frame-rate speedup on systems that take advantage of MMX support. The real action will soon move to a chip with a more promising future, though. Intel's initial Pentium Pro designs were lousy sim engines. They ran 16-bit code more slowly than a comparably clocked Pentium, and the support chips couldn't pump out video very quickly. Look for a new Pentium Pro design to hit soon that does away with the internal 12 cache; this will hurt performance a bit but drop prices dramatically. The performance shortfall will be made up by the PERIPHERAL VISIONS You may not be stuck looking at those dazzling 3D graphics on your dinky old 15-inch monitor, either. Cateway's Destination system is just the first of the \"big-screen\" solutions for gamers. I expect to see more systems and separate monitors with sizes of 25 to 31 inches pop up over the next year, eventually dropping to prices not much higher than a TV of the same size. And we won't necessarily be watching these screens from across the room-a 31-inch monitor on a (sturcly) desk is the closest you can get right now to a \"virtual reality\" experience. Speaking of VR, don't expect VR glasses to be a significant factor over the next What will you be running on all that new hardware? It won't be Windows NT 4.0, at least not in 1997. NT's hardware protection features and poor DOS compatibility make for terrible performance for your old DOS games-if you can get them to run at all. And despite the acklition of DirectX to NT 4, don't expect the majority of 32-bit Windows games to be very compatible with the new OS. You will, however, very likely be running Windows 95 (or the upgrade, codenamed Nastrville, slated to ship in February, 1997). There haven't been many compelling Win 95 sims yet, and the best-such as Su-27 FLANKER and FLIGHT UNLIMITED-are also available for DOS. But that's going to change soon. Most of the sims set for release next year are designed specifically for Win 95. And now that the DirectX toolkit is reaching maturity, those games will finally start to really take advantage of the operating system, making the upgrade worthwhile-especially in conjunction with the hardware upgrades outlined above. It's the hardware that's going to change the face of simulations, but Win 95 will be the glue that tics it all together and makes it easy for developers to take advantage of the new features. DOS holdouts will find that OS getting only a little more sim support than AmigaOS in a year or so. And unlike the premature passing of the Amiga, the belated death of DOS is a good thing, an event that's long overdue. Some hints to get you cruising smoothly in BACK TO BAGHDAD: >You can speed up mission loading a bit by making sure to load SMARTDRV.EXE before starting the sim. It still takes a long time, but the wait is noticeably shortened. >Here's an odd one: some gamers have reported that BACK TO BAGHDAD, a DOS game, actually runs smoother under Windows 95. Especially if you have lots of memory If you're using a Hercules monitor to display the MFD, be aware that this configuration won't work under Windows 95. You'll have to boot back to DOS or the secondary monitor will be scrambled. SEPTEMBER 1996 "

"STRATEGY JANE'S AH-64D LONGBOW SIMULATION/SPACE Longbow Bullseye Staying On Target In Jane's Chopper Sim by Robin G. Kim he tactics required to survive in the realistic combat environment that JANE'S AH-46D LONGBOW portrays are quite different from those most vetcrans of fixed-wing flight sims are used to. This article will take you beyond the basics covered in the manual and training missions, helping you make the most of your Longbow Apache-the deadliest attack helicopter in the world-when flying at the highest realism and difficulty settings PLAYER LONGBOW Learn from experience: Ride with Us on a sample Longlow mission on this month's CG-ROM. PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF The 30mm chain gun can kill even a T-80 tank if you hose it down long enough at close range, LOW AND SLOW For a lighter pilot, getting low and slow in hostile territory can mean big trouble. For the pilot of an attack helicopter, flying nap-of-the-earth at 50 knots, 20 feet off the ground, is business as usual. Use the collective to control altitude instead of the cyclic, because the collective is much to your flanks or rear, get as close as possible to the hilltop so you won't have to rise as high. A quick 360 degree scan before unmasking, to check for enemies you may have bypassed, never hurts either. If you must go over, rather than around, a bill, do so at the lowest possible altitude; staying in the ground clutter will often prevent your detection by enemy radar even when they have a clear line of sight. more responsive and helps maintain a constant speed. The flight path marker, available only with the Transition HADSS (Integrated Helmet And Display Sighting System) mode, is a valuable aid when flying in the weeds at any speed. Just keep it pointed in the direction you want to go. The quick stop maneuver, a rapid deceleration to a hover without gaining altitude, is an important one to master for staging bob-up attacks or just to peek over the top of a ridge. The key is to modulate the collective to maintain altitude as you flare with the cyclic. Be prepared to add lots of collective as you slow down and translational lift disappears. Stay above 10 fect-higher if pointed downhill-to avoid hitting the ground with the tail boom. Once you're below 15 knots, activating Hover Hold will finish the job. Because popping up from behind a hill tends to expose you to any threats lurking MEMORY MAP The Longbow radar system memorizes every target it detects. The TSD (Tactical Situation Display) shows a map that combines what the radar sees now with everything it saw earlier. This is an invaluable situational awareness aid, but note that the last known locations of moving targets get stale over time after contact is broken. If your ingress flight plan happens to take you near a tall hill far behind the front lines, it's useful to \"preload\" your NAP OF THE EARTH Reducing collective to descend this slope while keeping the nose high avoids unwanted acceleration. At the right sink rate, the flight path marker will follow the contour of the hill as shown here. SEPTEMBER 1996 "

Hence, the Hellfires LOAL (Lock On After Launch) mode is rarely useful except for attacking from behind a hill at close range or when you have to bob up higher than about 40 feet to lock onto your target(s). If your wingman launches a Hellfire at a target you've ordered him to attack, avoid turning so far that the target leaves the TSD view, because your wingman will match the tum, causing his missile to lose lock and miss. Hellfires don't work against airborne helos or Su-25s, which, coincidentally, are your biggest threats. Unlike SAMs and AM, these will hunt you down in your hiding places; keep tabs on them so they can't sneak up from behind. Enemy choppers are best engaged from maximum range with two Stingers each-one rarely does the trick. The Su-25 moves fast and is hard to bring down, so avoid it. Evade its devastating strafing attacks by putting it near your three or nine o'clock and moving fast. Ordering your wingman to attack a distant aircraft is usually not a good idea because he'll charge out toward it, heedless of danger. However, if you're about to get tangled up in a dogfight, use the \"weapons free\" command to let your wingman fight on his own.

The residents of your planet also hold a Cameplay is further helped by the overall number of religious beliefs, which in turn humorous approach, and by the diversity affect the requirements of heaven and between heaven and hell. come with the game itself. Anything less is either incompetence or gouging. The only mitigating factor in the case of AFTERLIFE is that in the course of playing the first few games most people will pick up all they need to know to be successful. In part this is because the basic game system should be pretty familiar to players by now, and because your celestial advisors will provide detailed, useful advice when things start to go wrong. Paying attention to their requests will guide you past most problems, along the w ay teaching you how to play. Still, this is no replacement for a decent rule book. Still, the paltry instructions that do come with the game are enough to get you going, and even when you are losing, AFTERLIFE is a lot of fun to play. I have always questioned the long-term replayability of strategy simulations like these, which do not have an opposing player to race against. The success of SimChy, amongst others, suggests that I am in the minority here, but I do think that building the same type of heaven and hell time after time has a tendency to get boring Why couldn't the designers of AFTERLIFE have added in a multiplayer option where one player controlled hell and the other heaven? The rivalry scems like a natural, and it certainly would give the game a longer life on my hard drive. In the end (grin), if you like this sort of simulation in general, you will probably have a great time in the afterlife. If SIMCriy put you to sleep, the humor of AFTERLIFE might keep you awake for a little while. And when you're not busy laughing, you'll have a great time playing Demiurge and doling out rewards and punishments in the afterlife. Elementary Strategy nlike earlier sim games, AFTERLIFE does not necessarily reward a rapid initial expansion. Everything costs money, and cash usually becomes pretty short around the 100 year mark. (Or earlier, depending on your spending habits.) Since the flow of souls grows gradually as your planet develops, there is no need to rush into massive building early in the game. As a general rule, only build the absolute minimum, and go for quality over quantity whenever possible. The following tips should get your first few games off to a good start >Manage your vibes carefully. In hell, bad vibes are good, as they make the environment less pleasant. In both heaven and hell, better vibes mean more sophisticated buildings. Better buildings mean more souls per square, and also more pennies per soul, which is the key to a positive cash flow. >Train and house demons and angels from the beginning. Imported workers cost a lot of money, and topias send out beneficial vibes. Always listen to your advisors, and check with them for feedback often. They will give you advice about many things which are not in the rule book. HELLISH DOCUMENTATION The game's only real fault is that it was relcased with completely inadequate documentation. The manual is a little booklet that comes inside the CD case, and provides only the most elementary information about the zoning possibilities and the commands. There is almost no attention given to how to play, or how the various aspects of the game interrelate. The on-line tutorial provides some help, and in fact, as tutorials go, is quite good, but it simply cannot make up for the complete lack of other documentation. Just to show that they are not completely neglecting their paying customers, LucasArts has included a few excerpts from the strategy guide. Huli? Why not just include a little errata note saying \"We have all the information you really want, we just figure we can get you to shell out a few more bucks to read it.\" The last time I checked, strategy guides were supposed to provide gamers with aclclitional hints on winning, if they felt they needed them. Information crucial to playing the game in the first place should APPEAL: Fans of SUMCITY who like laughs with their city building. >PROS: Lots of humor, two distinctly different and challenging realms to manage, good on-line help and a fresh approach to planning sims. CONS: Horribly inadequate documentation and gameplay that eventually gets repetitive RATED * CG SEPTEMBER 1996 "

"REVIEW  AMERICAN CIVIL WAR DIFFICULTY LEVEL ADVANCED STRATEGYZWARGAMES LWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home merret Vielzburg LE MOULIV AMERICAN CIVIL WAR: More Firepower On THE ROAD FROM SUMTER  APPMATOX by Terry Coleman Bubu Rouge Flew Orleans answers to questions such as these were simple, it wouldn't be much of a game. They aren't, however. As a result, AMERICAN CIVIL WAR is a complex, rich and ultimately satisfying game. THE FATHER OF WATERS 1863 scenario: New Orleans has fallen, and to keep the Mississippi River out of Union hands, Pemberton must hold the Vicksburg fortress and slow Grant's advance-challenging for both sides. he War Between the States is more than dry history to most Americans. Tales of families tom asunder by the war, of homes decimated, and of relatives who never came home, are passed from one generation to the next-right along with the stories of great struggles at Gettysburg or Shiloh. I distinctly remember hearing some of these stories one night as a teenager, and (having memorized most of these tales) being unable to place one of the soldiers' names-I had never heard it before. This hcrctofore unmentioned ancestor buried in my family's Civil War lore turned out to be my great-great-great uncle. Seems that my great-grandmothcr's sicle of the family conveniently forgot to mention the man's existence to me for many years. His \"un-person\" status came about simply because the man had fought for the Union, and you guessed it-he had thereby forsaken his native Mississippi. even the mediocre (BLUE AND GREY by Impressions) and the poor (Empire's CIVIL WAR). Now, of course, that Talonsoft's BATTLEGROUND: GETTYSBURG has made the Civil War again fashionable, the floodgates are open, with both ACE OF RIFLES and ROBERT E.LEE: CIVIL. WAR GENERAL (wonder where they came up with that catchy title?) on their way even as you read this. But as challenging and entertaining as these tactical/operational games might turn out to be, where does that leave more strategically-minded gamers? Thankfully, Interactive Magic knows a diamond in the rough when they see it. AMERICAN CIVIL WAR is the third attempt from Frank Hunter to perfect his THE ROAD FROM SUMTER TO APPOMATTOX design. And a long, difficult road it is, where you must tackle the tough decisions faced by Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis. Should I remove the ineffective General Halleck and put Ulysses S. Grant in his place, regardless of the consequences? Do I risk violating Kentucky's neutral status? How do I get that blasted Stonewall Jackson out of the Shenandoah Valley?! If the WAS MY BROTHER IN THE BATTLE? True to the strategic scale of the game, the smallest unit that may operate independently is a division; more commonly, you maneuver corps and armies. Each division is comprised of brigades, so that you may have famous units such as the Iron Brigade serving in their historical role as part of the Army of the Potomac. Each unit begins as green, and with combat experience, can be transformed into a hardly group of veterans. Naturally, more experienced troops have better combat modifiers. So, for example, it's not uncommon for a group of veteran troops armed with inferior weapons to defeat larger forces comprised of mostly raw recruits. Inexperience tends to be more of a problem for the Union, since the Rebels rarely get enough volunteers to swell the ranks sufficiently to make up for their losss. All in all, though, the game provides a good simulation of the manpower differcnces between North and South-although the Confederates did a better job in real life of blending green troops into crack units without losing much efficiency, a situation that the game doesn't faithfully recreate.

"REVIEW  AMERICAN CIVIL WAR STRATEGY / WARGAMES Combat won't do much for those weaned on WARCRAFT II Gone are the miniatures-style battles of SUMIERTO APPOMATTOX, victims of poor Aland unmanageable real-time command systems. While no doubt a painful decision for the designer, this radical change has improved the game immensely. When the competent strategic Al out-mancuvers your army, you must now save yourself through your wits instead of your mouse If anything, the combat options have been pared back too much. Now, all you have is a choice of Skirmish, Low or Moderate intensity. You make your choice, rating here can change Defend orders to Attack-never a dull moment. Inspiration = Affects overall morale of troops, and may give \"morale shifts» to combat odds; leader may attempt to rally routed troops; an Army commander with high inspiration trains troops more effectively Initiative = Based on leader's experience and innate sense of timing: directly affects casualties and morale during and after battle. Tactical Ability Primary combat resolution statistic; may increase with experience. tions to the front and of cotton to Europe, is essential for any hope of Rebel victory You learn how: to juggle production; to clefend against amphibious invasions; to get your fast vessels past the Union naval blockade; and to manipulate European politics for more aid (and maybc, even an carly end to the war). And you play the game again, and again, cach time with a different strategy... Rewriting History:Confederate Playing Tips Dalam TEILLES wataingoa x Anal MARYLAND exe ATS 18 LATE ASKHOAN FAREWELL Are there problems with AMERICAN Civil WAR? Well, the Win 95 interface works, but at times, it's slower than a snail racing on a cold plate; running the game in Windows 3.1 is even more sluggish. You can't really open multiple windows, either. To be fair, the wonderfully complete manual includes a nice tutorial. And the game itself, while complex, has a nice internal logic. The multimedia add-on disk isn't Ken Burns, but it is professionally done, and certainly better than most Civil War fare for CD. When you balance the irritations versus the number of options in the gamechanging the Confederate capital, modifying slavery status, the scenario editor-it's hard to go wrong with this game. Provided, that is, that you accept AMERICAN CIVIL WAR for what it is the best strategic-level game on the entire War Between the States. I'd like to think that, torn as he was between North and South, my great-great-great uncle would agree that this game does justice to both sides of the conflict-and to all the brave souls who fought in it. HERE A LEE, THERE A LEE Send \"Marse Robert\" to Memphis, where he has a good chance of retaking Tennessee and/or threatening Kentucky. Just make sure to train your green troops heavily first. VIRGINIA REEL Meanwhile, leave Joe Johnston as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia. While not as popular as Lee, Johnston can easily hold Fredericksburg against large numbers of Union troops the computer rolls the bones (in more ways than one), and a lot of numbers get crunched, based on the relative morale, training, weaponry, supply, terrain and leadership of each force. It would have been nice to try outflanking, refusing lanks, frontal attacks, and other options but I respect the decision, obviously made to keep the games complexity from getting out of hand. (Besides, if it's battle intensity you crave, Talonsoft marches onto a new BATTLEGROUND every couple of months.) After the battle, the loser retreats and the victor is generally exhausted--a pretty fair simulation of Civil War conflict. This unique blend of ratings allows the leaders to emulate their real-life roles. McClellan, for example, is an inspiration to his troops. While perfect for training and whipping an army into shape, McClellan is so hopeless tactically that he eventually becomes a liability. If you remove \"Little Mac» before his approval rating with the average Yankee soldier drops, however, you will find that your approval rating as President drops dramatically. It's not easy being Lincoln... What does scem casy at first is playing the Confederates, with their clashing, talented leaders such as Lee and Jackson. But you soon find out that all these abilities and more are necessary to balance the North's enormous advantage in men, materiel, and huge Union fleets, poised to strangle the waterways of the South. Eventually, you figure out that the detailed supply rules are more than just a nuisance. The transfer of food and muniAPPEAL: If you're into Civil War grand strategy, this is the only game in town. >PROS: Depth and tremendous scope, from naval conflicts to the confused fighting in the Trans-Mississippi. Leader models and politics are excellent and seamlessly integrated. >CONS: Interface fails to take advantage of Win 95; long load times on anything less than a Pentium 90. Strategic combat is realistic, but way too streamlined. THE SOUTHERN SOLDIER BOY Where the game really shines is in its depiction of leaders. Over 100 staradorned military minds of both sides are rated for Aggressiveness = A personality trait much like Battle Lust in an RPC. A high RATED A SEPTEMBER 1996 "

At Austerlitz in 1805, Napoleon faces THE SOUND OF SILENCE There's also the matter of the game having absolutely no sound. What game publisher in the 90s produces a game without sound? Even the rudimentary games I played on my Kaypro Il back in the mid-80s had sound.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what hot What's The IME Deal With... ma Gimmicks? incredible game-but if you really look at it, most of what makes it special is buried deep in the writing and plotting The live-action gives it a greater sense of realism, but quality graphics could have done the job almost as well. We are just entering the realm guess it's fallout from those local news bites on the E3 show a few months ago-you know, the one with some guy in a bad suit going to the booth that has the most scantily clad women, believing everything he's told-but I find myself growing tired of these people endlessly crowing about \"things to come,\" when they should be making sure that today's games are worth playing. Despite the fact that only ravens like shiny new stuff more than I do, I find that all the excitement over gimmicks and techno doo-dads at these shows really tends to overshadow the truth: that there is nothing very entertaining about another bloody Super Mario game I guess I should thank Nintendo for making a big deal out of skewed 3-D graphics (\"Now you can make Mario travel anywhere in the virtual world, exploring as you want!\" Golly, you mean the way you've been able to do in real computer games for about the last BILLION years?). At least they drowned out the agonizing babble over Virtual Reality, and how it's going to change civilization forever by next weekend. Of course, just when I thought the VR hype-fest was over, spotted yet another book on its implications. Given the actual state of the technology, and the fact that the aver. age person can't be bothered to read a book, never mind pick their own movie endings, all this fretting is almost as premature as running home after the first performance of Macbeth and penning an essay on what its effects on TV might someday be. What I'd really like to see is this: all the money currently going into bad VR headgear being saved until somebody invents cheap, fast color flatscreens. Instead, they could put more effort into technologies that might actually bene fit gamers, like really efficient voice recognition software. Let's face it, voice commands are probably the only way the average Joe is going to be able to handle the next generation of sims. The Command cut of ACES OF THE DEEP certainly proved that voice command is as important to realism as the multifunction joystick was to FALCON. The larger the vehicle being simulated, the more vital voice recognition becomes. The cool but unwieldy RULES OF ENGAGEMENT 2 would have been infinitely more enjoyable if you could have called for shields or warp speed. The transition from Gimmick to Feature is an important one to com. puter gaming, and it's important to recognize that even something as widely used as live-action video is still really in mid-transition. While multime dia abounds in the gaming world, it still functions as pure chrome in most of the games, and only rarely does it become an intrinsic part of the game For instance, GABRIEL KNIGHT 2 is an ( Multimedia abounds in computer gaming, but until it becomes in the hype that they an intrinsic part of the game, it's still just a gimmick. that achieves the latter is PSYCHIC DETECTIVE, a nifty little title that makes an initial impression of pure Gimmick, but delivers up gameplay intrinsically tied to live-action video. Personally, I'd love to see that design team getting a little more money and time; they could develop a real breakthrough title. The fact is, the entertainment media will never pay attention to skill, and will never stop searching endlessly for the next HOT tech-expecting them to spot relevant trends in this industry is as foolish as setting aside money for your own VR pit. It would be nice, but only if marketers weren't so caught up in the hype that they dedicate whole sections of a store to gaudy displays with vaguely three-dimensional Marios in washed-out, \"night-sniper-scope\" green. (Not that the thought of looking at Mario through a sniper scope doesn't have it's own dark appeal...) After the smoke and delusion of E3 fades, I'm sure there will be a few more execs out there (who have never played a computer game in their lives) dreaming that some badly executed gimmick will double their sales. M aybe, if we are very lucky, something useful might evolve from it. At least we can hope. ENGAGEMENT 2 would have been infiyou where multimedia is relevant enough to shape the flow of a game, as it does in the last two WING COMMANDERS. Even more rarely, multimedia can serve an important function in the game itself.
