"JOHNNY WILSON edi too late Flunking the Playtest on inte How Bugs and Flaws Survive Despite Playtest Exterminators ponent cocktails every few months, you realize that it's impossible to program for, debug, and test every hardware configuration. Many bugs-even crash bugs--are restricted to a few strange configura tions as opposed to being universal Some of the flaws our readers complain about are endemic to the playtesting process. Before I was a CGW editor, participated in beta n an industry dri ven by engineering and technology, you would expect that playtesting would have become a science by now. However, the more I view this industry, the more I am convinced that playtest ing is an art, not a science. Every month I get letters from readers who complain about a recent game and say, \"How could Way. Late Software have released this game in this condition?\" Naturally, we can't overlook the obvious reasons Way-Late Software may have released the game in that condition. They may have shipped a game that they knew was buggy because it had to ship before the end of the financial quarter, or they may have shipped a buggy product because they were out of development funds and needed immediate cash flow. They might have shipped the product in a buggy form as a last resort to cut their losses. We also can't overlook obvious hardware incompatibilities. Recent research indicates that up to 20 per. cent of the installed base of con sumer computers may come from screwdriver shops (local computer stores that assemble machines with components du jour, often resulting in systems with configuration anom. alies). When you consider that even major PC manufacturers such as Dell, Gateway, and Micron mix com(Gamers are concerned that publishers are skimping on Al in favor of multiplayer gaming. Unfortunately, this creates \"playtester tunnel vision.\" Game interfaces, icons, ter. minology, and structure end up following familiar patterns. As a result, playtesters zip right by flaws and don't even notice. For example, was playing a WWII naval game which had both strategic and tactical elements. The game had a bug which would not allow you to reaccess the strategic map once the tactical map had been activated. As a veteran player of the General Quarters rules for miniatures, I was used to the convention of seeing a strategic map, creating a basic bat: tle plan with the other captains in my squadron, and never getting to view the strategic map or confer with the other captains after the battle began. So, I never tried to re. access the strategic map after I'd entered the tactical engagement. As a result, I thought the game was superb. Gamers who were unaccustomed to the rules conven tion I had used in the past were frustrated at the bug. Apparently, all of the playtesters missed it because they (many of whom were also miniatures aficionados) never dreamed anyone would try to go back to the strategic set-up once the tactical battle was being waged. Was it a bug? Yes! Should it have been caught? Definitely! Did the company deliberately try to foist the bug on the general public? Nope. The playtesters missed it. Playtester tunnel vision caused them to see what they expected to see. Even though every playtester agreement I've ever seen has challenged the playtesters to try unex. pected actions, tactics, and sequences, most companies recruit volunteers who love a given game's style and subject matter. As a result, the games aren't tested as thoroughly as they should be. Another complaint readers have concerns the current level of artificial intelligence in games which have both solitaire and multiplayer capability. Gamers are legitimately concerned that publishers may be skimping on the Al, since the multiplayer game aspect is \"where it's at.\" We don't really believe that publishers are deliberately underfunding Al development and testing, but we have noticed a tenden cy at some publishers for the playtesters to spend so much time with the multiplayer version of the game that they tend to pay less attention to the solo mode. As a result of playtesters becoming so enamored with the multiplayer mode, the majority of playbalancing and tweaking suddenly favors the multiplayer game. The worst case is where elements vital to the solitaire mode are stripped out because they weren't used in multiplayer mode. Monitoring the styles of playtesting play is absolutely vital. Development teams are bound to be pleased testing, and I learned why playtest. ing doesn't catch all of the flaws. First, the playtesting process caters to experienced gamers. Many times, computer game pub lishers build their playtester lists from the gamers who complain about previous products. They are impressed with how deeply the playtesters have gone into the prod ucts and they want that kind of commitment on their next prod. ucts. Indeed, that's how yours truly got on playtest lists CGW JUNE 1997 "

"JOHNNY WILSON ZIFF-DAVIS PUBLISHING COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CEO Eric Hippeau when playtesters get wrapped up in the multiplayer mode and play far longer than designers' original expectations. They are very likely to respond to the playtesters' criti cisms concerning multiplayer mode and change the design with out reflecting on the cost to the solitaire balance. In order to correct this tendency, playtest departments will have to walk a razor-thin Consumer Media Group President 3. Scott Briggs Vice President J. Thomas Coltingham Executive Director, Research Randy Cohen Business Manager Cynthia Mason Assistant to the President Francesca Kos Ziff-Davis Publishing President, U.S. Publications Ronni Sonnenberg President, Interactive Media And Development Group Jeffrey Ballowe President, International Media Group J.B.

Malcolm Morris Vice President, Human Resources Rayna Brown Vice President, Planning Daryl R. Otte Vice President, Production Roger Herrmann Vice President, Controller Mark Moyer Treasurer Thomas L. Wrigtit Director of Public Relations Gregory Jarboe ( Since programmers are always trying to clean up their code, they sometimes restore a bug when they are trying to fix something. drop is made by simply freezing work on the network and moving into compile format. Since pro grammers are always trying to clean up their code and make it more efficient, they sometimes go back and undo a bug fix when they are trying to fix something else. Unfortunately, during some chaotic schedules, it is entirely possible for bugs to be fixed at one point, and then creep back in on a later drop when an old file is recompiled into the new build. Since the development team believes they have fixed the previous bug and, as a result, isn't looking for the bug in the next build, it ends up sliding through-unless the playtesters find it again. In one baseball game, I personally saw the direction of the ball logic reversed from one build to another. I could direct the pitcher to pitch inside and he would invariably pitch outside, and vice-versa. One typo and an obvious bug showed up. If this can happen with some thing this obvious, imagine what happens within a complex game where you would have to make a definite series of choices to hit the same bug. In a role playing game or a huge strategy game, it would be tough to find the bug again. It's very easy for gamers to ask the question, \"Why didn't Way Late Software test this game?\" I hope this editorial will shed some light into how bugs can still sneak through, even when publishers do test the games. My desire is not to excuse the bugs, but merely to explain some of the ways they can occur and encourage publishers to tighten the playtesting process. I also hope that publishers will hear the questions and take seriously gamers' frustration with \"buggy games.\" Though playtesting is still more of an art than a science, publishers should try to make the playtesting process more effective.

Finally, another reason flaws slide by the playtesting process has to do with the development cycle. Out-of-house playtesters send in their bug reports at odd intervals. Yet, toward the end of the cycle, programmers are providing new \"drops\" or \"builds\" daily. When these builds come together, all of the various game systems and functions are recompiled together.

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH THE LADY IS A CHAMP Being a woman myself, I read with some interest (and some heat) Martin Cirulis' column in Aprilis issue (\"How To Play Games with Women,\" #153). I don't question the demographics he cited, nor do I take exception with the point of the article. I realize that I am a minority among computer users and game players. This is in my face with every computer magazine I read and they are many), with every tech support person I talk to (and they are more), and I finally stopped dealing with computer salespeople completely. If my husband, the man who firmly believes computers should be used as doorstops, is in the room with me, I am ignored. To add to the issue, I am (gasp!) 43 years old and (double gasp!) a museum professional by trade (how conservative can you get?). The problem here is stereotyping. I have loved games since my father (a U.S. play-by-mail chess champ) taught me to play chess at the age of six. By 12, I was a poker wiz and discovered Avalon Hill. Thus began wargaming. In my thirties, I participated in a play-by-mail computer space game with 49 other people (all men) from across the country. I hid my identity as a woman for a year and a half before it came out. One of the alliances, without my knowledge, adopted and protected me for the next year and a half Needless to say, I was one of six remaining players in the end. (Thanks?) I bought a Sega system around then and finally got the first computer that I ever touched in my life six years ago (when I graduated in 1971, there were no PCs). I started, typically it seems, with RPGs. Then I discovered strategy (my favorite). Then, I tried HEXEN and became hooked on shoote rs. There's no better stress reliever at the end of a day than to come home and kick some serious butt. I don't use cheat codes, I am pretty darn good, and I have no interest in adventure games at all. Tam on my third computer, brand new last week. She's (note pronoun) a Falcon Northwest Mach V, 166 MMX, loaded. My ll-yearold son and I are currently playing DIABLO, HEROES II, and DAGGERFALL. I use computers heavily at work and, with another woman, am one-half of the tech-support unit there. I am the one up late at night when my husband goes sighing off to bed. I am trying to get him \"friendly» with our computer and am teaching him how to navigate the programs. Well, back to my problem with the article. (Martin Cirulis) writes from the beginning as if only men will be reading the page. You buy into the stereotype throughout while abhorring it. This is no better than the facts that: PLAYING GAMES WITH WOMEN You write a great magazine. I have been a subscriber for about two years, and you guys have never let me down. In your April issue (#153), I found the article, \"How to Play Games With Women,\" just what the doctor ordered in getting my wife to see why I love this thing more than sleep. I got her started on DIABLO and I must say I have created a monster! Now, she says,\"I'll be in in a minute, honey!\" then comes to bed early the next morning. She wants another computer for herself so we don't fight over my rig so much. Which is okay 'cause then I can get to kick her butt in some WAR2 or QUAKE. Thanks again for the article, gotta go, promised her I wouldn't take long. Never get this thing anymore. Greg Glover Portland Oregon DIABOLICAL DAGGERFAULT I wish to write about a disturbing trend I have noticed in computer games. I feel that role-playing games have begun to lose any sense of coherent plot. DAGGERFALL is one of the most notable examples. Here is a game with thousands of towns, temples, and dungeons (even if they are mostly redundant), hundreds of spells, superb graphics..and a plot as thin as tissue paper. I applaud Bethesda for a noble attempt at an open-endedness and freedom of movement that is unmatched in the genre. However, this game simply has no structure. You're given one lousy little cut-scene in the beginning, and that's it. Your character is an anonymous nobody with no history or backround save the few statistics and questions you answer in the character builder, which has far less real effect on the course of the game than all the commotion and excitement about it would lead us to believe. The point is, there is no character development whatsoever. Yes, some of the open endedness must be sacrificed if true character development is to occur, but I think that it is crucial to an interesting and satisfying story. Anything else is nothing but a series of randomly generated dungeons to fight through. But DAGGERFALL is not the only culprit. DIABLO, for example, is a superb game. Unfortunately, its plot is nonexistent. Again, your character is faceless, and without reading the manual, you wouldn't even know why you're where you are in the first place. It's almost as if an interesting story line has become irrelevant as long as there are enough monsters, treasure, and towns to visit. If I want endless redundant dungeons to go through on tiresome cookie-cutter CGW JUNE 1997 "

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH on one of our characters. Ever get hoodwinked into smuggling without realizing it? One of our characters did. What you call the paper-thin plot does rely heavily upon the completion of multiple mini-quests, but it's essentially an overlay of Shakespeare's Scottish play with Machiavellian spice from time to time. We learned to savor each new twist in the plot. We would have liked more meaningful conversations and would have enjoyed the plot advancing in some other ways, but we found it to be a fascinating game, nonetheless 1. Most people on your staff are men. (The women generally hold marketing positions.) Is there that much of a dearth of women reviewers? (With the possible exception of Scorpia-a pseudonym.) 2. Too many games have women getting killed, maimed, beaten, and naked 3. There are too many scary articles about creating women's games,\" lower violence, moral issues, blah, blah, blah, I suspect mine will not be the only letter on this subject. The salesman at Falcon told me they had a lot of women clients. (See, when a woman is a gamer, she buys a SERIOUS machine!) Continue addressing the issue of women gamers, but put your money where your mouth is, too. Watch the sexist tones in the review, create opportunities for women reviewers, let the game companies know they are ignoring, or belittling, 50 percent of their potential market! Sandra Allison Del Haven, New Jersey light on the serious gender gap in gaming while encouraging readers to share our hobby with their partners. In fact, he cast men in a rather unflattering light, but by writing to a largely male audience he may have appeared to buy into old stereotypes. If he sounded \"sexist,\" it's may be because he's blazing territory that the gaming media has largely ignored. As for our mostly male staff, almost half of the CCW staff is female. Our editorial staff includes three female editors and three contributing editors, and as you know from our telephone conversation we are interested in having you write for us. This issue is too large to address in a short reply, but there is more to it than just bias. On average, men buy more games and spend more time playing them than women. We are very cognizant of the fact that 97 percent of our 100,000+ subscribers are male. That's our audience, and magazines have to know who their audience is to serve them. But, we appreciate your observation that the gender gap can not be closed by playing to it. Thank you for your perspective and for your passion for gaming, and be sure to read the other letter in this section from the other side's view. WE'RE NOT DEAD, YET! It certainly is a testament to the power of your editorials: Your article had an amazing impact on the folks here at Crystal Dynamics. We were quite surprised to see Crystal listed on your obituary list. We're nowhere near the great video game graveyard in the sky. In fact, we've just finished our second profitable quarter! Specifically, we're currently putting the finishing touches on PANDEMONIUM and LECACY OF KAIN and will have three brandspankin-new products to show at E3 this June. We're going to have a great 1997; the best year in our history! Wed hate for you to miss it, so I'm officially inviting you to come down to our office and kick the tires. Scott Steinberg vice-president of marketing Crystal Dynamics Sandra, you ignorant slut Just kidding. As you know, Martin Cirulis was trying to shed Ulama 2 DIO Johnny Wilson replies: I usually only dig the graves. This is the first time I've ever hit a company with the shovel & quantity of gameplay does not necessarily make a good game. Jason Rabin Montreal, Quebec, Canada missions, I'll play Doom, or some other mindless drivel. I truly hope that I'm not the only one who is concerned, because I really love the RPG genre, and I would like to see it flourish in the future. Perhaps companies like Bethesda and Blizzard should look to games like the ULTIMA series and BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, which managed to combine an open-endedness and freedom of gameplay with an intriguing and well developed plot. In any case, I hope plot will be taken a little more seriously, and that the RPG companies remember that Since we just voted DAGGERFALL as our Role Playing Game of the Year, we obviously have to wonder if you played the same game we did. Never before in a CRPC has one of our characters been thrown out of a guild for non-performance, yet we experienced this in DACCERFALI.

"READ.ME Edited by Charlotte Panther (CPanther @zd.com) Escape to L.A. Activision and Interplay Bare All ick of staring out the office window at the fog and the rain, CGW decided it was time to pay our friends in sunny Southern California a visit. Not only did we lake in a few rays, we also got the scoop on all the products Activision and Interplay have slated for release over the next year. Here's a whistle-stop tour of what we saw. races in this driving game, but the point is to run over pedestrians and smash other cars. You gain points for artistic merit if you produce excessively bloody displays of vehicular gore. DIE BY THE SWORD is a tight ing game with medieval, fantasy combatants, unrestricted 3D arenas, and even an adventure game component. The engine is 3D, the blood flows freely, and Interplay hopes you'll be carving into Kobolds with your sword sometime this summer. Continued on pg 32 ATOMIC BOMBERMAN It's simple to grasp-move a little guy around screen, plant bombs to kill human opponents (up to nine), and evade opponents' bombs-but isn't just brainless arcade action. Power-ups, obstacles, and the crafty intelligence of your human foes serve to make every game chaotic and hellacious. ly fun. Interplay plans an early summer release. CARMAGGEDON, developed by SCI for Interplay, is a simple game of drive-by destruction. There are CARMAGGEDON INTERPLAY  THE SECRET OF VULCAN FURY, Interplay's new Star Trek adventure game (slated to ship at the end of the year) was top of the list. Written by D.C. Fontana, one of the writers of the original Star Trek series, VULCAN FURY develops ideas that were conceived, but not written, for the TV show. Interplay's OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS has DIE BY THE SWORD an artistic look and feel that accentuate the story, rather than existing parallel to it, as in many post. FORGOTTEN REALMS Myst games. Millennium fans will be intrigued by the plot, which involves the confluence of conditions at the prophesied moment when the forces of darkness are unleashed. Some declare BOMBERMAN the greatest multiplayer game in history. We'll reserve such praise until we see the final product, but the beta-PC version of the game, ATOMIC BOMBEAMAN, is certainly fun. Short takes on games released just prior to press time. THIS JUST IN TEST DRIVE OFF ROAD Test Drive does not fulfill its promise of \"true to life driving mechanics,\" nor does it test your off-road skills as much as your ability to float a fore-aft pendulum through a pinball-like environment that has you rebounding more than driving. The game allows you to drive one of four production 4x4s through twelve tracks. Considering the different vehicles, conditions, and environments, very little variance is actually reflected on the track. This one's anything but a test drive. --Gordon Goble Accolade, (800) 245.7744 PC CD-ROM Reader Service #: 301 CGW JUNE 1997 "

WUM PANASONIC 10X BIG 5 CD-ROM For a 10x CD drive, the Big 5 isn't the fastest we've seen: Our WinMark test came in at a so-so 570 kbps. Still, the data trans fer rate for 4K records is good at 1497-kbps (more than enough to take advantage of most games), and the average access time is a fast 234 ms. You don't buy the 10x Big 5 for sheer speed but rather, flexibili ty. In a single CD-ROM bay, you get 5 CD slots. These can be configured as one drive-so that you don't have to change CDs on games like PHANTASMAGO RIA Or WING COMMANDER IV (provided the game supports the Panasonic format); or, it can be des i gnated as one CD drive per slot. While the IDE drive is fairly simple to install, it isn't quite Plug-n-Play (I suggest that you get the updated drivers, especially for DOS), and you do give up some performance versus a faster SCSI drive But the street price of $240 is a steal, especially considering the flexibility of the drive.

"READ.ME Escape to A. >>Continued from pg 30 ACTIVISION  ZORK: THE GRAND INQUISITOR, due this fall, is the ambitious, epic new installment of the legendary Zork adventure game series. This model consciously embraces the entire Zork history, with the re-appearance of many favorite characters and LEGACY OF KAIN SCREAMIN' DEMONS locations. In the game, you attempt to defeat the Grand Inquisitor and restore magic to the Great Underground Empire.  Activision's WWII flight sim is coming along nicely, but perhaps the oddest development was the decision to change the game's name from DOGFIGHT to SCREAMIN' DEMONS.  In BLOOD OMEN: LEGACY OF Kain, a port of the PlayStation action/RPG hit, you play a bloodthirsty, shape-shifting vampire out to avenge your death and rescue the land of Nosgoth from a terrible evil.  DARK REIGN, slated for a June release is sure to be one of Activision's bigger hits of 1997. A real-time strategy game, this, unlike other C&C and WARCRAFT clones, has the potential to be just as exciting as those fathers of the genre. DARK REIGN sports realistic terrain features, robust multiplayer options (including handicapping and meaningful alliances), and more flexible controls, such as waypoints and toggleable Al, not to men. tion some very cool units and buildings. DARK REIGN Hexen II, the third game in the HERETIC cycle is another winner (see the full preview in our QUAKE Killers cover story). The weirdest game we've seen yet, NETSTORM, definitely has a new angle that distinguishes it from other real-time games. The emphasis isn't on control but placement-where you put your units is key, since you can't control them after you place them. The game has a psychedelic look, with many units and creatures that are seemingly inspired by Dr. Seuss. With more focus on strategic place ment than on-the-fly unit management, this game could appeal to those with a more detached, yet strategic, play style. Look out for sneak previews and in depth coverage in CGW as we follow these developing games from initial design through final product! THIS JUST IN SCREAMER 2 The newest incarnation of the SCREAMER racing line is nice to look at, but that's about it. SCREAMER 2 sports a lush, yet non-interactive, PlayStation-type graphics envi: ronment, with a choice of available cars, tracks, and types of competition. However, the game has a big problem with controller sensitivity. Steering is so touchy that at speeds above 60 mph, any attempt at rounding a corner results in a 360 degree spin-out. This is incredibly frustrating, considering that your competition seems to have no problem handling the turns.

"READ.ME Reconstruction Zone Cow Survey PLAYING LATELY CGW Survey 7 n early March, Microsoft unveiled a new incarnation of its Internet Gaming Zone at www.zone.com. The original Zone, in addition to providing matching services for Microsoft games such as CLOSE COMBAT, MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS, and HELLBENDER, also featured a number of card and parlor games. The revamped Zone will eventually have much more to offer gamers. Currently available is ZoneLAN, a Kali-like utility which allows players to play DOSbased games that support IPX network (and run under Win 95) over the Internet. Microsoft also plans to partner with some third-party developers to allow their games to be played on the Zone as well-Hasbro is the first of these, and will offer free online play for boxed games such as MONOPOLY and Risk. Another alliance is with the DWANGO multiplayer gaming service. If you can't stomach Internet laten. cy for your favorite action game, you'll be able to use the Zone to find opponents in your area, and then automatically dial your local DWANGO server and play with much less latency-albeit for a small charge. Perhaps the most significant announce ment, though, is that all of Microsoft's upcoming boxed game titles for 1997 will feature free Internet play using the Zone. That doesn't mean everything will be free on the Zone, however. Microsoft's first \"pay to play\" game, FIGHTER ACE, will enter beta-testing on the Zone in June. This updated version of VR-1's AIR ATTACK is a more beginner-oriented cousin to AIR WARRIOR and WARBIRDS. Microsoft doesn't plan to charge by the hour to fly FIGHTER Ace, though. Instead, you can pay by the day or month and fly without watching the clock.Denny Atkin co Last Month Months on Chart 1. Diablo (Blizzard) 2. Red Alert (Westwood/Virgin) 3.

Now, unless you've spent way too much time with a microwave oven, you don't have eyes in the back of your head-so how did you know where your friend was? Your ears told you. Diamond Multimedia has harnessed real-time 3D-positional technolo gy from Aureal Semiconductor, and forged it into their new Monster Sound card, which should be shipping as you're reading this. We recently got our first earful of the PCI-based Monster Sound audio accelerator, and liked what we heard. We installed the Monster Sound sans hiccups, and were very impressed with its ability to \"put\" sounds behind us one of the hardest sound effects to pull off. Monster Sound also has a digital joystick port, and can handle Soundblaster compatibility for DOS games running in a Win 95 DOS box. But don't pitch your Soundblaster 16 just yet, because Monster Sound can't support Soundblaster compatibility run ning in pure MS DOS mode. Bundled titles will include Activision's MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES and HYPERBLADE, as well as Maxis' SIMCOPTER, though the list wasn't complete at press time. Priced at around $199, Monster Sound is a bit on the pricey side, but as more titles ship that take advantage of Microsoft's DirectSound 3D, this will be very desirable iron to have in your box.

"READ.ME Diamond Stealth 3D 2000 Pro: ViRGE/DX Gets Some Respect Lara Dresses Up Nice... ne of the best-selling 3D-accelerator chips on the market today is the S3 VIRGE, and despite its reasonably good 2D performance, its pathetic 3D performance has earned it the moniker \"3D decelerator.\" With the release of the ViRGE/DX, S3 has redeemed itself somewhat, and Diamond has added its usual set of refined tools to make the Stealth 3D 2000 Pro a contender in the crowded 3D accelerator market. Installation is about as easy as it gets for a graphics card-pop the card into an available PCI slot, boot the system, insert the installation CD, and click \"install drivers\" on the AutoPlay menu. As a 2D Win 95 accelerator, this is a fast card. On a Pentium 166 meaning no more TSRs are needed to run SVGA-graph ics DOS games. So, how good is the 3D? We took a quick look at two Direct3D titles, HELLBENDER and HYPERBLADE, both of which certainly got better frame rates on the Pro than the earlier Stealth 3D 2000 running crisply in accelerated mode. Overall, the Stealth 3D 2000 Pro is a definite improvement over the original. It's faster in Windows and runs DOS SVGA-graphics games without assistance. And while the ViRGE/DX 3D performance doesn't approach 3Dfx or even Rendition, S3 can finally shed the title of the Rodney Dangerfield of 3D accelerators. Tune in here next month for the full skinny the Stealth Pro, as well as STB's Nitro 3D, based on S3's SGRAM-based VIRGE/GX. -Loyd Case Micron Millenia running at 1024x768 with 65,530 colors, we saw 64.5 WinMarks in Business Graphics tests, and 30.4 Win Marks in High-End Graphics tests in WinBench 97.

And that's just running on the CPU. Eidos has also released several patches that let TOMB RAIDER take advantage of 3D accelerators.

When Spelling Entertainment, the company that holds about 90 percent of Virgin Interactive Entertainment's stock, announced last month that it was discontinuing its operation of the international electronic games divi. sion, rumors began circulating that the company was in trouble, and that company leadership was shaky. Not so, says Virgin President and CEO Martin Alper. Spelling Entertainment is in fact preparing to take Virgin public, and part of the process will be to make Virgin a \"leaner and mean er\" company by shedding weaker titles currently in development. \"The industry is not appropriate to With the exception of the blockbuster COMMAND & CONQUER: RED ALERT, Virgin's lineup of PC titles fared poorly during the crucial holiday season, despite the inclusion of critical Successes like CIRCLE OF BLOOD and TOONSTRUCK. Alper admits he's surprised and disappointed. \"We put a lot of ourselves into [TOONSTRUCK), expecting it to do better.\" Virgin's sales are strong in Europe, and the company will focus on making products that appeal to more of an international market. Fully two-thirds of RED ALERT's revenues came from the European market. \"You've got to start looking at the global picture. It can't just be an American product,\" says Alper. >Continued on pg 44 NHL POWERPLAY the market size,\" he said. \"We will be appropriate.

"READ.ME READ.ME Hi-Val DVD ROM Drive: The Next Generation of Storage Arrives We tested this late beta unit on a Gateway P166, and in WinBench 97's CD-ROM WinMark, Hi-Val scored an 828KB/sec on the Overall Test, just shy of 6X overall performance. However, in sequential read tests, Hi-Val fared much better, with transfer rates around 1,200KB/sec, about 8X performance. We expect that these numbers will improve somewhat as drivers are optimized. fter much hoopla about DVD and its potential impact on the computing world, units are starting to ship, and DVD must now step up to the plate and deliver. Hi-Val, with its DVD System, has delivered one of the first DVD-ROM upgrade kits, which includes an EIDE Toshiba SD-M1002 DVD drive, as well as Quadrant's Cinemaster PCI MPEG 2 decoder board which also delivers Dolby AC-3 \"five-dot-one\" audio output. Setup was essentially pain less: After attaching the Toshiba DVD drive to our motherboard's EIDE controller, and plugging in the MPEG-2 board, Win 95 recognized the DVD-ROM as a CD ROM drive, found the MPEG-2 board on startup and, after feeding driver discs, it was a done deal. Unfortunately, at press time there was a shortage of DVD game titles, though quite a few were in the works. We did take a quick look at SILENT STEEL, an FMV-based submarine adventure which, despite the uninspiring game play, looked good. Because of the lack of DVD content, we took an initial look at Hi-Val's performance as a traditional CD-ROM drive, since it will be pulling double-duty playing both media for some time. 8/97 PIPELINE 10th Planet Bethesda 11/97 6300 2D/3D Chip Set Tseng Labs Summer 97 Achtung: Spitfirel Avalon Hill 7/97 Agents of Justice MicroProse Summer 97 Alde De Camp 2 HPS Simulations Summer 97 Atlantis Cryo 7/97 Battle Spire Bethesda 9/97 Blade Runner Virgin/Westwood 10/97 Blood Omen Activision 7197 Buccaneer SSI 9/97 Carmageddon Interplay Summer 97 College Football 97 MicroLeague 9/97 Demon Isle Sierra 10/97 Earthsiege 3 Sierra late 97 European Air War MicroProse late 97 Falcon 4.0 MicroProse late 97 Fallout Interplay Summer 97 FPS Football 98 Sierra 11/97 Front Page Sports Skiing Sierra 10197 Flying Nightmares Il Eidos Summer 97 Flying Saucer EA/Any River 7197 Golgotha crack.com Fall 97 Hardball 6 Accolade 7/97 Heavy Gear Activision Summer 97 Hexen ll Activision 7/97 Imperialism SSI 9/97 Interactive Gamepad (USB) Alps Summer 97 Island of Dr. Moreau Psygnosis Journeyman Project III Broderbund Fall 97 MicroLeague Baseball 6.0 MicroLeague 6/97 Mig Alley Empire Fall 97 Myst 2: Riven Broderbund Summer 97 NFL Legends Accolade 9/97 NHL Powerplay 98 Virgin 9/97 Quarterback Club 98 Acclaim Fall 97 Pacific General SSI 7/97 Pacific Tide Star Fall 97 Panzer General II SSI 11/97 Pentium II Intel Summer 97 Pictionary Hasbro Interactive 9197 Populous III EA/Bullfrog Fall 97 Prey Apogee/3D Realms Spring 98 Pyramid 3D Accelerator Tritech Summer 97 Quake Il id Xmas 97 Reach for the Stars II SSG/Microsoft Summer 97 Rebellion LucasArts Summer 97 Red Baron Il Sierra 9/97 Redguard Bethesda 10/97 Return to Krondor 7th Level Summer 97 Sabre Ace Virgin 9/97 Screamin' Demons Activision Fall 97 Semper Fi Interactive Magic 9/97 Shadows of Riva Sir-Tech Summer 97 Sin Activision 3/98 StarCraft Blizzard 8/97 Steel Panthers III SSI 11/97 TFX 3 DID late 97 Tone Rebellion Broderbund Fall 97 Trespasser: Jurassic Park DreamWorks Xmas 97 Ultima On-Line Origin Summer 97 Unreal Epic Fall 97 WarCraft Adventures Blizzard 12/97 Warlords III SSG/Broderbund 7/97 Wes Craven...Fear Cyberdreams 10/97 X-COM: The Apocalypse MicroProse Summer 97 X-Fighter Sierra late 97 Zork: Grand Inquisitor Activision Fall 97 Now the not-so-good news: The unit as tested has a list price of $799, a bit on the steep side given that EIDE 12X and 16X drives are shipping for one fourth that price, and considering the currently thin herd of DVD game titles shipping.

Prior to the phenomenal success of WARCRAFT II, the WARLORDS series was the best-selling and best-loved of fantasy strategy-gaming. Serious wargamers (who'd never admit to enjoying a fantasy game) often played WARLORDS as if it were WWII on magical drugs: Giant spiders became tanks; dragons were really tactical aircraft; heroes were John Wayne or Toshiro Mifune. But while they quibbled about \"realism,\" they playedand along with more mainstream gamers--they marveled at the Al and the wondrous play balance.

Take elements of TOMB RAIDER, PRINCE OF PERSIA, and of the past decade, ALONE IN THE DARK, along with the more recent TIME COMMANDO. TWINSEN'S Odyssey is the sequel to Raynal's RELENTLESS.

"The New Games Are Still Bloody, but Now They've Got More Meat secrets of the world around you, unveiling more of the story, and giving you a glimpse at the relationship between your characters and the NPCs of the game. hatever you think of QUAKE, one thing is certain: It raised our expectations for 3D action gaming. Now, it's almost impossible to go back to any thing less than true 3D. The immersive realism of 3D levels, monsters that seem to be in the flesh\"--and a full six degrees of freedom has propelled us to a new level of experience. But if QUAKE showed us the wonders of 3D, it also exposed the weaknesses in current first-person Interactive and Functional Environments for Increased Realism and Immersion Being able to affect your environment, and being in recognizable, functional places will become as important as technology for creating a believable and immersive environment. In the best example, Hexen II, you'll be in levels that Real stories will bring the game to life and even affect gameplay growing abilities. In Jedi, you'll be able to increase Kyle's Force powers, while in HEXEN 2, your success in battle will directly translate into more power for your paladin. By letting you invest in your character, these games will make you care for his welfare. Real Stories That Bring the Game to Life Hand-in-hand with the role playing elements are engrossing stories that give both your character and the environment life. In Jedi, live. More innovative gameplay will definitely become the rule. Role-laying and character advancement will make games like JEDI KNIGHT even more compelling. look so much like real cathedrals that you would swear they could be used for communion.

Now that the technology has been brought up to speed, it's time for the gameplay to be as well. The next generation of first-person action games-the QUAKE killers-are doing just that by introducing real stories and innovative game design. Not surprisingly, many of the games fea. tured here share the same innovations and ele. ments-elements that will finally bring action gaming to the next level. Better Game Design That Goes Beyond Key-hunting and Shooting Action gamers are tired of the same old thing. In games like JEDI and HEXEN 2, you'll have to master new abilities, like Force powers and magic, that will affect how you fight. Puzzles are also playing a larger part in game design, espe. cially in DAIKATANA and JEDI, meaning that you'll have to have a quick mind, as well as quick reflexes, for victory. Also, with stories playing a larger role, mission-based games with real goals, rather than level-based games with no point but violence, will become the norm. Environments will be even more interactive and bellevable.

"QUAKE II AND QUAKE WORLD id Software Works to Improve Its Benchmark Shooter by V. Long hat better place to start this roundup than with the founder of the genre: id Software. Work proceeds apace on Quake II and QUAKEWORLD, the latter of which is id's online multiplayer fragfest. The latest version of QUAKEWORLD increases support to 32 players per game and reduces client-side latency by better handling bandwidth hogs such as nailgun fire. QUAKEWORLD will also include Capture the Flag, a phenomenally popular QUAKE mod (see CGW March, 1997, p. 221). The QUAKEWORLD plug-in for Netscape Navigator is also nearing completion, which will allow even easier access to Internet QUAKE. All this work on QLAKEWORLD will form the foundation for multiplayer QUAKE II. Developer: id Software Publisher: id Software Target Release Date: December, '97 A MORE CIVILIZED OGRE Here is one enemy from QUAKE . Id is accomplishing some cool effects with this guy, when you shoot him, he'll start to become transparent as his image fades and wavers. Among the other improvements in Quake II will be the ability to merge demos into the game itself. This will allow for immersive \"cut-scenes\" that actually take place in the game world itself. Another change will be the merged streaming of demo and audio tracks, which allows id to include highly compressed soundtracks and score them to specific points in a demo, as if it were a movie. For Quake II, Programmer John Carmack says that he is strongly considering dropping QUAKEC in favor of exporting most of the game logic to a separate .DLL file.\" The switch will not only boost overall speed, but also allow for an increasingly sophisticated Al and more monsters. Carmack plans to release the source code, but you'll still need a compiler to hack the game. John Cash and Tim Willits tell us of various QUAKE Il improvements. There will be true rotating objects, such as spinning tunnels, conveyor belts, and leaf doors. In fact, the rotating objects are so realistic that you can shoot between the spokes of a wheel as it turns. Two-way exits that let you go back to a previous level are also new.

Long and Elliott Chin INREAL is currently very much a workin progress. CGW saw the development tools, and received a sneak peek at the first level (in 512x384 resolution) run ning on a P166 MMX with 32 megs of RAM. The textures and environment look convincingly grim and befit the prisoner transport ship that com prises the first level. 16-bit color and dynamic lighting add to the visuals. However, neither the monsters nor weapons are fully implemented yet You play one of four characters (two male, two female), and explore such diverse locales as skycities, alien derelicts, and mines. Some pro posed weapons include a flamethrower and the Stinger-a weapon that makes targets living bombs by firing a mine into them (the mine detonates if shot a second time). Steve Polge, creator of the Quake Reaper Bot, is on the UNREAL team working on the monster Al. Some of the beasts will be smart enough to hunt in packs, to run away if outgunned, and even to compete with humans for artifacts such as health. GT Interactive claims that UNREAL shareware will be available in early September of this year with the final product following later that month BRUTE FORCE Monsters in the game include the Brute, which is hiding in this gloomy room. (the editor will come with the game). Though the game is still early in its development, we should have something that's definitely worth playing pretty soon-if Epic can meet its shipdate, that is.

"VILLERS DAIKATANA Samurai Game Designer John Romero Slices Action With RPG Elements In lon Storm's Premiere Game by V. Long will do just that, by adding different characters, time periods, and role playing elements to the ohn Romero is one of a small number of \"stars\" in the world of computer gaming. He helped found id Software with John Carmack and two others in 1991, designed Doom, and played a key role in the development of QUAKE. Six months ago he left id in a much publicized break to form his own game company. Today, Romero's lon Storm is located in the penthouse of a Dallas office building, has about 40 employees, and is developing three titles using id's Quake engine. Developer: Ion Storm Publisher: Eldos Interactive Target Release Date: December, '97 action formula. The game also blends in some compelling features from console games such as Square Soft's CHRONO TRIGGER, FINAL FANTASY III. SECRET OF MANA, and SECRET OF EVERMORE. Consequently, DAIKATANA will depart from the stereotypical lone hero-versus the world paradigm of the current slew of 3D first-person games. Despite whatever awesome skills you possess as the main character, Hiro Miyamoto, the game is nearly impossible to complete without your two companions, Mikiko Ebihara and Superfly Johnson. It reflects real life. You and your buddies have to work together as a team to solve puzzlesas well as to survive some very hairy situations. Those familiar with Romero know that he has always wanted more complex challenge in his action games. He hopes lon's first title, DAIKATANA, CREEPY CRAWLEY This is the church level in the third episode (Dark Abyss) Daikatana: the Movie \"Full 3D, six degrees of freedom of move. ment is cool, and gameplay is important, but ARMORY JUNE 1997 "


"OO Sidewinder With Rocket Launcher Battle Boar Ragemaster 5000 Kineticore setting events right, you will be rewarded with immense riches. In order to recapture the Daikatana, you must break into an impenetrable fortress built to safeguard the relic. The action starts when you are air-dropped into the swamp surrounding the fortress. the story is a huge part of the experience, explains Romero. \"I want you to become so emotionally attached to the characters that cer tain events in the game will make you break down and cry, just like in the opera scene from FINAL FANTASY III.\" Romero intends to forge such relationships between you and the characters through a variety of interactions, such as having you come to each other's rescue and engage in wisecracking banter. The heartbreak you will feel only indicates how much you've bonded with the characters. This is a novel departure from today's 3D shooters, where the only pain you feel comes from receiving two loads of buckshot at point blank range. Among some of the ideas Romero has for heightening the sentimental immersion in DAIKATANA's world are integrated voice-overs throughout the game to provide more of a movie-like experience. Indeed, Romero made high-quality dialog a priority, and has commis sioned a Hollywood scriptwriter, Christian Divine, to craft the lines. Plus, a powerful soundtrack scored by Will Loconto (of Information Society fame) will compli. ment the game as well. Unearthing the Plot Though yet to be finalized, the plot currently revolves around the quest for the mythical Daikatana, an ancient Japanese sword possessing magical powers, including the capacity for time travel. In 2455AD, Dr. Toshiro Ebihara unearthed the Dalkatana after a massive and expensive archaeological search financed by his family fortune. This wherewithal came courtesy of his grandfather, Dr. Tetsuo Ebihara, who discovered the cure for AIDS in 2030AD. Unfortunately, Dr. Ebihara's evil assis. tant coveted the relic for himself, beheaded Dr. Ebihara, and travelled back to 2030AD to steal credit for discovering the AIDS cure-and to enjoy the resulting fortune. You play Hiro Miyamoto, Dr. Ebihara's bright est student, and an expert in Japanese martial arts. Mikiko, Dr. Toshiro Ebihara's daughter, tear fully tells you of the tragic murder and the impending alteration of history. In return for Let the Games Begin DAIKATANA is much like CHRONO TRIGGER in that the hero and his trusty companions are sent hurtling through time again and again. In DAIKATANA, each of the four episodes corre. sponds to a distinct period in Earth's history. You start out in the future, 2455AD. However, in order to save the future, you must travel to the near present, 2030AD. Unfortunately, because of an inadvertent oversight, you and your pals are blown back to 2030BC instead. After some time, you manage to collect enough power to escape 2030BC, but only to emerge in 560AD, the Dark Ages. By the final episode, you make it to the intended destination, 2030AD, where events can then finally be corrected. The episodes will be completely different worlds onto themselves, with unique non-player characters, monsters, resources, weapons, and technologies. In fact, weapons and items brought from one episode into another may be rendered useless simply due to a lack of ammo or energy. Each episode will also have distinctly different art and color palettes, One of the most eagerly anticipated aspects of playing the hero is the prospect of wielding a mighty JUNE 1937 "


"QUAKE Japanese sword. Although such a melee weapon is nothing new in first-person games, it's certainly one weapon that many fans of the Highlander series and Akira Kurosawa movies want to see done right. What also makes the Daikatana special is the bond you will develop for it. As you gain experience in its use, its powers will grow tremendously-to the point of it almost becoming a sentient being Like any good RPG, DAIKATANA will give experience points to players who accomplish specific tasks, such as finding artifacts or killing monsters. Such experience can be allocated to the enhancement of a character's attributes such as speed, strength, and attack delay. One innovation Romero is contemplating for DAIKATANA is the ability to play from the perspective of either of the two companions. Not only will your abilities be determined by that character's unique combination of attributes, but you'll see the story in a remarkably different light. For example, the exact same scene may have different dialog to reflect what that character understood. Another idea that Romero is considering that would add even more play value to DAIKATANA is the inclusion of various challenges that aren't neces sary to the story-line, but are fun as a change of pace. Romero cited examples including the Reaper Bot contests on Cary's now-defunct Quakehole Web site, and the fastest-to-complete-the-level con tests on ION Storm's Web site, all of which have been enormously popular among Quake fans. Despite the focus on the plot, the action gaming aspects of DAIKATANA will not be neglected Romero talked excitedly of incorporating ele: ments from Doom DeathMatches, such as the \"use\" key, BFG type weapons, balanced weapons capabilities, and \"Doom-speed.\" It's safe to say that many gamers will relish the opportunity to use the Daikatana to take a few heads à la Highlander As with any game so early in its development cycle, expect some things to change. Look for more details in follow-up articles by CGW. Romero projects that DAIKATANA will ship in November, 1997, and that the shareware and commercial versions will be released simultaneously. Eidos will publish this and the other lon Storm games. However, Romero assures CGW that he won't release DAIKATANA Unless it's perfeat; \"Ut it's late, it's late because of me!\" THE S+ORY BEHIND ION SHORM esign is law.\" proclaim John Romero and Tom Hall, two of the biggest names in PC game design. In fact, game design is so important to them that these long time friends left high profile companies, namely id Software and 3D Realms, to start lon Storm. They founded the company with Todd Porter and Jerry O'Flaherty, both from 7th Level. The four founders have since added Bob Wright, far left, and Mike Wilson, at bottom. The founders are left to right: Porter, Hall, Romero, and O'Flaherty. As first reported in the January, 1997, CGW (#150) Tom Hall leads the 3D RPG currently litled ANACHRONOX, while Todd Porter leads the unnamed 3D real-time strategy, first-person action project.

"MAY +HE FORCE BE WITH YOU You have a selection of 10 weapons for blasting the Imperials, from pistols to stormtrooper rifles to repeater rifles to lightsabers, all with different abilities. The Tusken Prod can shoot single bolts or multiple shots, the repeater rifle fires rapid laser blasts, the rail gun shoots charges that stick to targels and then explode-great for deathmatches. The developers say that you'll even be able to pilot a speederbike or Crow ship in some of the lev. els. These won't be REBEL ASSAUL-style sequences; you'll have full control over these vehicles. \"Obi-wan Has Taught You Well\" The lightsaber will be the most powerful weapon in that it deals great damage and can block lasers. For saber blocking, just hold down one key to block all laser blasts in a cone in front of you. Atlackers from above and behind you will still be able to hit you. However, as you increase in level, you'll have the option of improving your saber blocking, which extends the range of your cone. You won't be able to fire while holding down the block key, but you could make your opponent exhaust his ammo and then rush in with the saber. In addition to saber fighting, there will be a dozen individual Force powers. LucasArts says you will be able to use Force powers and a weapon concurrently, such as strik: ing down an enemy with your saber while you are side from saber fighting and well regeneration (the rate of replenishing your Force points), there are 12 other Force powers. There are 4 basic Force powers, plus 4 each for the Light and Dark side. Among the four basic powers are Force jump and Force speed.

Of course, the team is still tweaking the graphics engine.

"QUAKE ELLERS HEXEN II Astonishingly Beautiful Hexen II Boasts Major Improvements Over QUAKE by V. Long and Elliott Chin ar, far away from the commotion of central Texas, somewhere in bucolic Wisconsin, Raven Software is brewing up the latest incarnation of the Heretic Cycle, using the powerful QUAKE engine, some Quake II technology, and lots of wicked imagination, all warped by large quantities of Dungeons & Dragons. Developer: Raven Software Publisher: Activision Target Release: Summer, '97 As with the other games in its generation, Hexen ll is bringing us something beyond retread gameplay. Come summer, it will provide us with a beautiful game courtesy of a drastically improved QUAKE engine and Raven's talented artists, but it will also give us role playing ele ments and character growth; hub based levels; environments that look like functioning, realworld places; and interactive environments. opposite of the necromancer.

The basic archaic weapon idea The necromancer is the master of black magic, remains from HEXEN (Swords, axes, maces) and His motivation for destroying Eidolos is obvious: there will also be spells, wands, and staves. He wants the power for himself. The assassin is Although Raven won't be resurrecting the the hands-on agent of evil, also known as the Taker Morph Ovum from HERETIC (which turned foes of Lives.

On the right are shards of glass as you shatter it. Note that the clouds behind the glass are placeholder art. CGW JUNE 1997 "


"TRAVEL +HE WORLD What particularly distinguishes Hexen II from the other Quake killers is the RPG element: Your character increases in skill and power as he gains experience and completes certain levels. For example, the crusader develops immunity to poison, while the necromancer gains the ability to revive (as undead servants) the crea. tures he has killed. The Magic of Immersion The sorcery Raven added to the QUAKE engine comes in two forms: magical attacks for the game and an almost magical heightened immersion in the environment. Raven made sure to create the impression of habitation. You'll see levels complete with living quarters, chapels, stables, and outdoor areas. As in the original Hexen, you'll see leaves swirling in the wind and be able to interact with your invironment. Hexen I also adds new effects such as falling rain. Fans of wanton destruction will enjoy the ability to smash open wooden chests to grab the goodies held within, or to crash through doors to make a grand entrance. We smashed open a few barrels and turned a wooden cart into a shower of splinters. Players can also put the environ. ment to productive use. For example, you can push around barrels, chairs, chests, and carts to help solve puzzles and circumvent traps. Raven even improved the sensation of fly. ing by implementing a soaring flight model that banks when you turn. The attention to detail in Hexen ll is sublime. Observant gamers will notice that as the Fallen Angel and Skull Wizard (two aerial enemies) fly, their robes will ripple and flutter convincingly. We'll see the first implementations of QUAKE Il technology in Hexen II The magnificent light ing effects, especially from the stained glass in the spectacular cathedrals, are courtesy of QRAD a new tool that adds light radiosity to the environment. The true rotating objects, such as swinging doors, complex traps, and even functional drawbridges are probably more obvious to the casual observer. WHAT A TRIP! Here are some more breathtaking looks at Hexen Il environments. Notice the brilliant, azure floor painting and murals in the Egyptian level. Just as nice are the water and paintings in the Roman bath house. Four Play Hexen Il consists of 30 levels, divided into four distinct time periods (rather than episodes): medieval European, Egyptian, Meso-American and Roman. Each era will have a distinct look. In one Egyptian level. you run through a catacomb filled with sphinxes, pharaoh statues, and beautifully textured murals of hieroglyphs that truly look like they are etched into the walls. The medieval level is set in a cathedral that fea tures huge, stained glass windows; a court. yard with destructible barrels and pull carts; and cobble stone floors. The artwork and attention to detail in the environment is simply stunning. Not only does each era look historically accurate, but the textures used are simply gorgeous. The fact that the environments are interactive will also draw gamers into the game. You can shoot at the stained glass windows in the cathedrals, and they'll shatter with a resounding crash as the shards cascade around you. Like Hexen, Hexen Il connects the levels and episodes with hubs. Raven plans to include approximately four specially designed death match levels as well. Raven and Activision hope to release the game sometime in June, 1997. CATHEDRAL OF PAIN Notice the exquisite textures for the stained glass windows and the detailed organ in the background. Guarding this dark but gorgeous scene is the Fallen Angel, whose robes ripple when she flies. "

"QUAKE VILLERS PREY og 3D Realms Waits for the Generation After the Other QUAKE Killers to Unleash Its Revolutionary Shooter IS +HIS MYS+ ? by V. Long hat's happened to 3D Realms' PREY the game that was supposed to be the ultimate QUAKE killer? Well, it turns out that 3D Realms is content to let the \"rabble\" fight it out for second generation supremacy. PREY will come in and pick off the winner. Developer: 3D Realms Publisher: Apogee Target Release: Mid-'98 Paul Schuytema, the lead designer for Prey, explains that although the engine had reached QUAKE-level functionality by mid-1996, it wasn't what 3D Realms wanted. \"We wanted Prey to be more than just a QUAKE clone,\" says Schuytema. So they boldly started over. William Scarsboro, the lead programmer, developed a fresh approach to 3D engine design that Schuytema terms \"Portal Technology.\" Portal Technology treats the world not as BSP trees (as Quake does) but as a collection of rooms, which allows for dynamic environments. For example, you can tear down a wall and walk through the hole to the other side. Other intriguing implications include the placing of portals anywhere in the level, so that a door in the wall of one room might connect to a trapdoor in the ceiling of another; thereby creating a nightmarishly topsy-turvy world. Preditor, the Prey editor, seems quick and easy to use. The partially completed test levels, complete with realistically blended 16-bit colored lighting effects, run very smoothly. Soon to be incorporated into Preditor will be the entity module for creating new classes of monsters and programming their Al via a simple point-and-click scheme. PREY's storyline also underwent changes. Although Prey remains a violent, frightening science-fiction game, it now revolves around a mod. ern era Apache named Talon Brave. Armed with his wils, brawn, and plenty of attitude (as well as some hellacious weapons), he faces a trinity of alien species known as the Trocara, and a fourth species known as the Keepers. While we wish we could see more than just tools and a preliminary work-in-progress, what we did see was encouraging. PREY is currently scheduled for release in mid-1998, and will require at least a Pentium 133 with a 3D-graphics accelerator. The graphics quality for Prey already looks stunning. Of course, the environments are still unpopulated, and much of the game isn't even in the production stages yet. TRESPASSER: JURASSIC PARK Return to Jurassic Park for Innovative Gameplay and Prehistoric Action Developer: Dreamworks Publlsher: Dreamworks Target Release: December, '97 reamworks is charging ahead with TRESPASSER, a 3D first-person action/adventure dubbed the \"AntiQUAKE\" by the design team. TRESPASSER will be an entirely physics based world where all objects are interactive and can be manipulated. Most of the environment is also outdoors in an island jungle, and the game is goal-oriented, rather than level-based. Gameplay is also miles apart from QUAKE's simplicity. Throughout the game, packs of velociraptors will be hunting you down, and tyrannosaurs and other dinosaurs will meet you for the occasional scary encounter, so action will be a major part of the game. However, equally important will be puz zle-solving, as you will have to climb fences with out being electrocuted, fix and turn on damaged power generators, and find your way from the bottom of the island to a radio beacon at the top of the mountain. The puzzle solving even extends to how you fight off the therapods, because since they will be thinking animals, and not unthinking monsters, you might be able to outsmart them rather than wading into them with guns blazing. Alternatively, because Dreamworks is striving to create a near-perfect ecological simulation, you could climb up a tree and just watch the ecosys. tem at work. For more on this innovative title, read Johnny Wilson's cover story in our March. 1997, issue. Also check out the TRESPASSER Web site at www.trespasser.com, created by members of the TRESPASSER team.

"HARDWARE Oaza foi 20 1.26 131 2.16 2.61 3.06 3.51 901 Smashing Sound Surround yourself in Crushing Walls of Stereo Sound by Loyd Case E'VE COME A LONG WAY from the days of silent movies, silent games, and nearly. silent built-in PC speakers. Still, many gamers don't realize just how good the music and sound effects have become, because they can't hear it with their tinny speakers. Today's sound cards have cleaner digital audio sections and more carefully crafted MIDI patch sets. To really appreciate the audio quality of today's games, you need good speakers. CGW JUNE 1997 JUNE 1997 "


"IKE SOUND CARDS AND WAVETABLE SYNTHESIZERS, computer speakers have improved over the past couple of years, though there's still a lot more chaff than wheat in retail land. We gathered a variety of new speaker offerings to test with games and music CDs, and we were fairly impressed. These speakers are all \"multimedia\" speakers, which generally means each has its own built-in amplifier and is more compact than many home stereo speakers. There are, however, alternatives to these types of speakers, which you'll find in the Aural Alternatives sidebar at the end of this article. Many of the newer speakers are configured as a pair of satellite speakers with a powered woofer. Although labeled \"sub-woofer,\" the bass units are really woofers, since the satellites only handle midrange and treble; true sub-woofers augment an existing bass speaker set. Another trend has been the packaging of the powered woofer as a stand-alone item, but I tested most bass units with the company's equivalent stand-alone satellites. Enough of the preliminaries: Let's pop a CD into the PC and pump up the volume. It's time to rock. MIDI Land MLi S35 Sound Blaster SBS 380 and SBW500 Advent AV370 The S35s are fairly typical of the current crop of satellite/powered bass combinations. Housed in beige plastic, the sound quality is fairly average, but a definite cut The AV370 is a simple, three-way system, with a powered bass unit and two satellites. The satellites sport Advent's signature wedge shape. Setup is quite easy: Three wires plug into the woofer and you're live. The front panel controls are simple and straightforward, though there's no provision for headphones. The bass unit is quite heavy, suggesting a strong amplifier, How We Tested Although sold separately, the SBS380 and SBW500 make a nice, relatively-inexpensive combination. They illustrate something that's often little understood: Powered bass units help the satellite speakers sound better. Tested by themselves, the SBS380s demonstrate flaccid, weak transient response and are completely lacking in any bass presence. When you throw in the SBW500 into the mix, you'd expect the bass to sound more robust, but the transients also become a lot crisper. The opening MIDI Land peaker testing is some thing of a black art, but I've always maintained that anechoic chamber tests or close mike tests for speakers is a somewhat futile pastime. There is probably greater variance in the accuracy of speakers than in all other parts of the audio sys tem combined. In fact, seeming ly identical speakers can have significantly different responses over the typical 20Hz to 20Khz audio spectrum Given that, my choice is to always pick a wide variety of music to test speakers, along with games that deliver great sound effects. In addition, we used a test CD that delivers both a 15Khz and 50 Hz tone, handy for uncovering how speakers perform at the margins. The five audio CDs used vary greatly, ranging from delicate classical tracks to seri. ous rock'n'roll. For game titles, we used WING COMMANDER IV. above the 370Qs from the same company. Transients are crisp, if a bit subdued, and the overall midrange and treble sound pretty good. Despite the separate bass unit, the bass still lacked any \"oomph,\" but it is fairly compact. The real problem with the S35s is the horrendously complicated setup. The entire setup is controlled from a single box, to which a confusing array of wires and connectors run. Plus, the satellite speakers have their own set of controls, since they can be bought separately. Connecting everything properly proves to be an interesting exercise in puzzle solving, and operating them is equally confusing. I'd save the puzzle-solving for adventure games and take a bye on this one. MIDI Land MLI S35.

The sound in this game definitely rocks the room with the right sound setup. I listened for accurate stereo imaging and overall tonal quali l y across the spectrum. I also listened at lower and higher vol. ume levels, paying attention to where speakers began to distort, or started to sound strained. I also tested for clarity in reproduction of transient sounds, which are percussive sounds such as a piano key being struck. The test system was a 200MHz MMX Pentium with an AWE-32 sound card and Roland SCD-15 MIDI 7 daughter card. The Windows 95 mixer was set at the midpoint for all settings, except for maximum volume tests. The test area was a typical office desk set in the comer of a room-pretty typical for most gamers. Sound Blaster PHOTOGRAPHY: SCOTT PETERSON movie from DESCENT 2 goes from being ho-hum to hair-raising. One test track has a heavy, synthesized bass, which the SBW500s have no trouble reproducing, albeit with a significant mid-bass emphasis. Overall, the Sound Blaster speakers are solid, middle-of-theroad units with decent sound, a good price, and easy setup. Sound Blaster SBS 380 and SBW500.

"Smashing Sound Smashing Sound H AV The 570s come as a pair of fair. ly large, wedge-shaped cabinets with a 5-inch woofer and 1-inch dome tweeter. The first thing you notice when you unpack them is that each speaker is oddly heavy. That's because each speaker is a discrete unit, complete with indi vidual power supply and amplifier. Connecting them to a sound card is a bit of a chore-you have to split the sound card cable, high volumes, you can detect some strain, but overall, these sound very nice, indeed.

On the other hand, the sound is uncolored, if a bit subdued. Transients are crisp, but not particularly strong. Acoustic music, in particular, sounds clean, but playing DESCENT 2 on this system didn't rattle the rafters like some of the other units. Overall, if you like clean, uncolored sound and have a small room or office, the 370s are worth a listen. Advent AV370. List Price: $299; (847) 3173700; www.recoton.com Together, these speakers comprise a fairly compact, full-featured setup, with enough power for smaller home offices. The sound quality of the JS-300s is really nothing to write home about. Transients are somewhat weak and the stereo imaging seems vague, but the overall effect is reasonably good. The bass response from the JS-900 isn't the strongest I've ever heard, but it's still pretty good from such a compact unit. Advent AV570 Advent AV570 Powered Partners because each speaker needs its own RCA jack. Each unit also has a separate bass, treble, and vol. ume control. You adjust the balance by adjusting the volume on the individual speaker. They can be mounted on stands (sold separate. ly) or wall mounts. These speakers sound very clean, and can generate very high sound pressure levels. The bass, while good for a two-speaker system, lacks the visceral punch of a separate bass unit. Transients and voice sound very good. At very Roland has long manufactured portable, powered monitors for musicians. The MA-8s, released some time ago, are quite similar to Roland's monitor line, and are even referred to as \"stereo micromonitors\" on the package. The overall impression when listening to the Rolands is one of brightness-not necessarily a bad thing for computer games. The transient response is excellent and the reproduction of sibilants is quite realistic and unexaggerated. The bass drivers of these two-way speakers measure only four inches across. Factor in the 8 watts per channel (real RMS power, though). and you begin to notice that bass response is lacking. Just for fun, 1 I have a confession: I have coveted these speakers for years now. Before Acoustic Research was acquired by Advent, these speak ers were the AR570s, and were the original multimedia speakers. Jazz JS-300, JS-900 "

They are easy to set up, but the first clue as to the real quality of these babies is the speaker wire, which looks like 24 gauge aluminum-not exactly a confidence builder. The next clue is the mammoth power brick. This is easily the largest power brick I've seen in awhile, though at least it's the pass through type where the wall plug isn't part of the brick itself.

Media 4 and Media Sub The ACS-55s are unique to this roundup in offering Dolby Multimedia Surround Sound out of two micro-tower satellites and a powered bass unit. The largish satellites, which look like they came right out of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" each have a front-firing and sideways firing dri ver. The front speaker is the main mid-range/treble unit, while the sideways-facing drivers handle the surround sound chores. The ACS 55 woofer is a compact black box that looks vaguely like it was left in the sun a little too long. Setup is easy, and Altec Lansing has definitely improved the user interface. There's only a single power cord (no brick!) that is attached to the bass unit. The sound quality of the ACS. 55s is a little on the bright side, but they deliver pretty good sound levels. Transients are crisp and the human voices are realistic. The bass driver has a clear, mid-bass boost, but delivers room rattling sound effects on the Descent 2 intro.

The transient response seems okay, but the stereo imaging is quite vague. I first thought that these speakers put out a lot of sound, but when you feed in a track with a high bass content, you can hear the speakers straining on the high end Overall, these might be worth looking at-the price is right, the JBL has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the better manufacturers of mainstream home audio and studio monitors. Now they've turned their attention to multime. dia speakers, and the experience shows. I looked at the Media 2 and Media 4 satellite speakers and the Media Sub powered bass unit.

"Smashing Sound Diamond Sound S2 Powered Speakers Although the sound doesn't seem as uncolored as the Cambridge Soundworks, nor quite as loud as the Diamond Sound S2s, the overall effect is very impressive, and JBL's offerings deserve serious consideration. JBL Media 2, Media 4 and Media Sub. List Prices: $99, $99, $149; (516) 496-3400; www.jbl.com Diamond Sound (no relation to Diamond Multimedia), sent us one of their first of the S2 line of multimedia speakers. If the Cambridge Microworks is a com. puter speaker designed by audiophiles, the Diamond Sound S2s must have been designed by a computer hardware designer. JBL Media 2 and Sub Cambridge Soundworks Microworks ICE The hinged stand allows you to vary the vertical angle of the drivers a bit. Setup in all cases is pretty straightforward, though each requires its own power connection. The overall sound of the Media 2 is very clean, though there's almost no midor low-bass content. Stereo imaging is exceptional, as is transient response. The Media 4 ups the ante with a 5-inch woofer and 1-inch dome tweeter in a more traditional box shape. Like the Media 2, stereo imaging is very good. Because of the 5-inch bass driver, there's more bass content, making the intro to DESCENT 2 satisfyingly loud and thumping. Throwing the Media Sub into the works really demonstrates the value of separating the bass unit. Without the Media Sub, it is easy to crank up the volume to the point of distortion. But with the Media Sub added, high volumes sound much less strained. The original Soundworks burst onto the scene a couple of years ago, delivering reasonable sound quality, but lacking the \"oomph\" factor when compared to some of the competition. Cambridge's answer to the critics is the Microworks, and they've clearly been paying attention. The first thing you notice is the size of the powered woofer. The wood case houses a 6-1/2\" long throw woofer---finally, a real bass driver! The satellites are very similar to the original Soundworks: They consist of miniature cubes, each roughly four inches square. Controls take a minimalist approach, with just a power switch and bass and volume con. trols. The volume control can be easily attached to your monitor with the supplied adhesive backed velcro. The setup proce. dures are reminiscent of setting up a small home stereo system, which is a comparison not too much off the mark. The sound quality is nothing short of stunning. To my ear, the Microworks is probably the most accurate set of multimedia speak ers I've heard: They are smooth, transparent, and lack any kind of audio coloration. The transients are sharp, the voices balanced, and the bass is satisfyingly solid. You can crank up the volume, even on demanding passages, and there is absolutely no sign of strain on the speakers. These are really great-sounding units, but at $349 for the set, they are the second most expensive speakers in the roundup. However...I wouldn't mind having them grace my office. Cambridge Soundworks Microworks. List Price: $349; (617) 332-5936; www.hifi.com Diamond Sound CHOICE The S2s are a geek's dream, complete with a control unit that can be mounted in an empty drive bay.

"Smashing Sound Coda t's clear from this list of speakers that PC audio has come a long way. Given ditferences in taste and budgetary constraints, most of the speakers here might find a home in someone's office. My recommendation, though, lies with either the Cambridge Microworks or the Diamond Sound S2 speakers, if your wallet can handle it. If you're on a somewhat tighter budget, check out Altec Lansing's ACS-55s, which are a great value for the dollar. If all you need to do is add a powered bass unit, the Sound Blaster SWB500 would be a good choice, though the Jazz JS900 could work well in a smaller office. On the other hand, if spending several hundred dollars on speakers is a real strain, then the Roland MA-8s are a solid choice. quality. The S2s aren't quite as accurate as the Microworks, but sound very good indeed, and the massive bass unit delivers much stronger bass punch than that sported by Microworks. The small, two-way satellite units deliver crisp sounding transients and realistic voices. The horn solo in one of my test tracks sounded particularly good on this system If we ignore price for the moment, the differences between the S2 and the Microworks become a matter of taste. Given the nature of game audio, most folks might prefer the somewhat boomier S2S (DESCENT 2 certainly sounds glorious on these speakers). It's a difficult choice, really. If had to choose between these two great systems, though, I'd have to lean toward the Microworks, but, then again, my tastes tend to be hardwired that way. You should give these speak. ers a listen if you can, but be pre. pared to pony up. Diamond S2 Powered Speakers. List Price: $450; (310) 582-1121; www.diamond audio.com 011 Aural Alternatives henever you read computer magazines, you might get the impression that the computer guys invented powered speak ers. In fact, musicians have used monitor speakers with built-in amplifiers for many years, Generally, they sound good and deliver a lot of sound pressure. They tend to be pretty pricey, though, except at the very low end. Typical manufactur ers include Roland and Yamaha. Another interesting alternative is to have your sound card wired into a small stereo system. In my personal rig, I have a 160-watt Dolby Pro Logic surround sound receiver going through a set of Cambridge Ensemble III home speakers. This entire setup cost me less than $600, and gives much more flexibility than most powered speakers. If you consider that some multimedia speakers now cost in excess of $500, this is not a bad alternative. Even the best sound cards often send out a \"spike\" when they're first powered up, or when they are powered down. So to avoid sending this spike through your speakers, be sure to turn your rig on first, then turn on the receiver. When pow. ering down, turn the receiver off first, then your PC, Finally, there are headphones. This solution is often overlooked, but in some small apartments or dorm rooms, it's the only way to avoid eviction. Sure, you can get cheap headphones for twenty bucks that will plug into your sound card, but get serious. Higher quality headphones start at around $70 and some professional models can cost upwards of $200. Again because of the signal spike that sounds cards put out, don't put headphones on before powering your rig up, and take them off before powering down. Be careful of mixer settings when using headphones, since sound levels can be surprisingly loud from sound cards. A great sound card doesn't do jack for you if you're deaf. CGW JUNE 1997 "

Although his sarcastic remark about why you might hate them (sleeping with spouses) may have been inappropriate, your curt, rude answer I found to be equally offensive. Myst may not be my favorite game, but I admire the artwork and beauty of it, and enjoy playing it from time to time. I do not care if you absolutely hate this game. What I would like (as well as many others I believe) is a straight-forward explanation as to why you dislike it so, and why you feel you have to put it down on such a regular basis. Thank you.\" Timothy Kirkland, via the Net GNOME p.144 because the game continues to be a top-seller despite having illogical puzzles, no characters to interact with, and an emphasis on pretty, empty graphics rather than game design.

"REVIEW. INTERSTATE \"76 ACTION 3000 NTERSTATE '76's multiplayer mode is a righteous, well-designed gaming experience in its own right. \"Multi-melees\" allow up to eight people to battle it out over a LAN or the Internet (via Activision's servers), or two players to go at it via modem or serial connection. Players choose from 23 car models (from little speed bugs to a school bus), configure the vehicle, and then choose a terrain (mostly variations on the single-player game locales). Not documented, but on the CD nevertheless, is a mission editor for designing your own multiplayer scenarios-another cool touch. INTERSTATE '76's multiplayer technology surpasses QUAKE's in a few ways. First, the host can drop out at any time without killing the game for everyone else. Second, Activision foresaw the Weasel Factor of just picking the biggest trucks and most powerful missiles, and assigned points to kills. The easier you make it on yourself, the less points you'll get. Finally, through the \"instant melee,\" users can play on the multiplayer STAYIN' ALIVE Waste your opponents big-time with rear-mounted weapons like the firedropper. Just about everything in your vehicle is customizable: the engine, suspension, brakes, tires, weapons, armor, and chassis reinforcement. It's up to you to decide how to accessorize and upgrade the car, while keeping in mind the need to be both powerful and quick. INTERSTATE 76s combat system is also outstanding. Depending on the model, cars are equipped with top, front, side, and rear short-and long-range weapons. Radar missiles cause a lot of damage, but they're useless in bumper-to-bumper dogfights. Turreted guns are particularly deadly up close, as they'll lock on to enemies regardless of which way your vehicle is facing. Again, it's up to you to decide the ideal mix of artillery. Be prepared for some serious fighting. The computer opponents, for once, seem unusually smart and agile they won't just stand there, à la QUAKE, and take your punishment Aesthetically, the game is stylish and beautiful. The 3D graphics are a generation above MECHWARRIOR 2s, and the forthcoming Direct 3D patch (not available as of this writing) should improve levels by themselves with a configurable number of computer opponents for practice. There are signs that the multiplayer game was a bit rushed. In the 1.0 release, gamers were randomly dropped back to Win 95 without warning. However, the game's first patch seemed to fix these crashes. INTERSTATE '76 now has the dubious distinction of replacing QUAKE as that most-played game that gets the CGW editors in trouble.

These commands are given to vehicles (split from their units by the player), sections, platoons or the entire company. A context sensitive control menu on the screen is where you set paths and tactics for units. Tactics include the head-long (attack), the safer (engage) and the circumspect (defend).

A mission appears and your choices begin to multiply.

It's actually possible for both sides to gain a victory by fulfilling different objectives. This reduces the effective ness of a typical zero-sum strategy, and is a real boost in multi-player games. To maximize your victory chances, espccially against well-equipped elite forces, you must carefully tailor the forces that accompany your core platoon from the units (limited by resource points) available for that mission. By using terrain and qualitative superiority, you can maximize kills, minimize losses, and carry out tasks despite usually being outnumbered in the unscripted and infinitely replayable battles. The rewards for your success are the usual medals and \"attaboy's from HQ, but given the lame reward sequences of many games lately, they're still welcome. come of the campaign really does hinge on your actions.

'The Al is reasonable, but is handcuffed in that it must employ standard, heavy-handed Soviet doctrine, casily defeated with finesse, but punishing for reckless players. It's a tribute to Interactive Magic that they didn't go through the motions on the Al, as so many companies are doing when a game has modem and network play. The main limitation for IMIA2 exists in its narrow scope, wlrich fails to encompass the whole of modern ground warfare. Even so, it's an excellent game about amored operations. It is simply rich with data on weapons, vehicles, organization, and tactics. Moreover, IMIA2 actually rewards you for using real tactics on the battlefield.

IMIA2 doesn't disappoint: The campaign missions are among the most realistic and dynamic available in any game, much less a tank simulation. The connected battles start with a defensive or offensive posture. If you do well, you come closer to the enemy main base (its capture signals victory). Conversely, a loss will throw your forces back towards their own base and make your posture less aggressive. A campaign has no set limit, and has a number of possible cbbs and flows.

"***** REVIEW  AIR WARRIOR II DIFFICULTY LEVEL Air Warrior YdS/NOTIVIONIS Goes Solo This Updated Online Classic Packs Loads of Stand-alone Play by Denny Atkin iven the excitement of World War II air combat, it seems amazing that the last new stand-alone WWII sim for the PC was released way back in 1995. The drought has ended, though, with the release of AIR WARRIOR II, the new combat simulation from Interactive Magic and Kesmai. This isn't the first stand-alone version of the venerable multiplayer air combat sim, but this iteration gets almost everything right The vast majority of these take place in World War II Europe. Here you'll find three campaigns for the Axis forces: a Battle of Britain series on offense, and two defensive campaigns which begin in 1943. On the Allied side, you'll fly Hurricanes defending England during the Battle of Britain, attack strategic targets in Europe flying B-17 Flying Fortresses, and fly with the 8th Air Force's 4th Fighter Group from September, 1942, through April, 1945. to shoot down Japanese Admiral Yamamoto. Other interesting scenarios include flying with the American Volunteer Group (the Flying Tigers) in China, flying defense against Kamikaze attacks, and flying A-26 Invader tankbusting sorties. In addition to the European and Pacific WWII missions, AWII also includes World War I and Korean the aters. However, there are only 2—4 missions for each side in these scenarios, and the sims engine isn't as well-tuned for the characteristics of the aircraft of these eras (lead-computing gunsights in biplanes?).

"REVIEW. AIR WARRIOR IN Dueling in the Skies TE SIMULATION/SPACE MORE TO COME II 360 missions aren't enough, the included editor lets you create missions (but not campaigns) of your own. one-on-one combat mode is new to AIR WARRIOR II. It uses Microsoft's DirectPlay technology, so you can connect over a local network, via modem, or via the Internet--but not using a null-modem cable. Any two vehicles can face each other in a duel, so you can pit a Sabrejet against an Me-262, or a tank against a Flakpanzer. This is a simple head-to-head mode, with no mission parameters or cooperative options. Of course, AWII supports the classic multiplayer arenas as well. The gameplay here is more or less a free-for-all war between three virtual countries, but the real fun comes from joining an online squadron and coordinating attacks with a group. AWII is currently available on CompuServe, Delphi Internet, and Earthlink. (America Online still hosts only the original Air WARRIOR for Windows. The service is apparently holding back on adding new games while it addresses capacity problems.) See www.kesmai.com for more information. Give AWII a try against human opponents for the real challenge. While the sim's Al is very good-probably the best seen so far in a WWII sim-it often ignores vital tactics such as boomand-zoom attacks. Nothing's more challenging than a cunning human opponent. Authentic cockpit interiors are included for cach aircraft type, with canopy frames, seat backs, and other obstructions realistically blocking your view (these can be disabled). With over 12 directional vicws from within the cockpit, AWII offers terrific situational awareness; unfortunately, there's no padlock view. AWII puts the 3D action in an inset window with a standard wraparound instrument panel. Two new clisplay modes can be toggled on the fly, one with a larger action window and textual performance information and another with a full-screen cockpit and working instruments. Unfortunately, only the insct-view mode gives you full access to both instruments and radio messages. the multiplayer arena. Unfortunately, these important communications can't be seen when you're flying in fullscreen cockpit mode. There are other carryovers from the online world, such as the ground radar screen (which substitutes for the vectors pilots were given by ground controllers) and the icon system for tracking enemy aircraft. While this will make AWII accessible to old-time AW players, it's likely to confuse newcomers. CON Learn more about online play by checking out the CG Guide to AIR WARRIOR at www. computergaming.com. BUSY SKIES Among the simulation's other features are superb flak effects, including air bursts and turbulence: an instant-action mode; a light recorder; and fully adjustable graphics detail. AWII includes both thorough online help and a nicely done 140-page manual AIR WARRIOR II's online roots make it a bit quirky as a single-player game, but the wealth of immersive, historically inspired missions makes the learning curve well worth climbing. If you enjoy World War II air combat simulations, you'll definitely find lots to like in Air WARRIOR II. SIMPLE BUT DEADLY While AWII supports resolutions up to 1024x768, the graphic detail is state-of-the-art 1992. GREAT PERSONALITY... Graphics have seen only incremental improvements in this version. The terrain is tabletop-flat, with occasional polygon mountains popping up here and there. Aircraft exteriors are more detailed than in previous versions of AW, but, for the most part, they don't even match the detail of the old Dynamix ACES series. This graphic simplicity does make for a smooth frame rate, even on the slowest Pentium systems (a frame-rate problem in the Pacific terrain was addressed by a patch within a week of the game's release) AWII's top-notch sounds do much for keeping you immersed, despite the retro graphics. Your engine makes realistic spin-up sounds, you hear a telltale drone as you approach a bomber formation, and your airframe creaks when pulling heavy C forces. One area where sound is missing is wingman communication. Instead, AWII displays textual messages onscreen, in an eerie simulation of the chat window you sce when you play in The flight models, for the most part are very well done. Performance is right on for the various planes, and quirks such as the Zero's inability to maneuver at high speeds are properly represented. However, the planes are a bit too stable to be really convincing, especially if you've spent much time playing PcHER DUEL or WARBIRDS. New fliers will appreciate the three levels of Might model realism, as the accelerated stalls in the full realism modle will frustrate those used to being able to jerk their joysticks around. APPEAL: World War II air combat fans looking for a chance to relive hundreds of historical battles. PROS: Amazing variety of historical missions, good flight modeling, wonderful sound environment, plays smoothly, both online and off-line. CONS: Low graphic detail, computer Al doesn't always take advantage of the strengths of the plane it's flying, interface can be confusing to newcomers. RATED CGW JUNE 1997 "

Unfortunately, little attention was paid to anything else. mission zone from the start, regardless of blocking terrain or distance, which eliminates the possibility of any surprises. You can't get a range on a target unless you select it and put your crosshairs near it, and there is no way to tell if a target is within a weapons range. Even when targeted, enemy infantry is harder to kill from your HAWC than on foot. I was also sorely disappointed in the environment, as it is composed of texturning around or firing a single shot. And this was on the hardest difficulty setting! Sadly, being independent of your vehicle is the most prominent multi-playcr feature as well.

In fact, look closely and you'll see that the terrain even shades itself-proof positive of the game's subtle but utterly mind-blowing attention to detail. Because golf is such a fast-paced sport-OK, I'm being sarcastic JN4's screen redraws are markedly quick. Technically, it's incredible, considering that nearly two-thirds of what you see is 3D-rendered terrain, unlike LINKS LS, which relies much more on a 2D painting horizon to fill the screen. Of course, overall speed is still reliant on hardware factors, such as processor speed, system and video RAM, graphic detail, and screen resolution.

Not only do you get five courses and a built-in designer, but you'll also inherit what amounts to an instant library of thousands of custom-designed links. JN4 has the ability to import and convert courses created with its predecessor, JACK NICKLAUS SIGNATURE EDITION. All you need is a modem and access to the Internet or other major online services, including America Online, Compuserve, and Delphi. There you'll find enough courses to make your putter flutter indefinitely. The conversion process only transfers terrain shapes and elevations, so you'll have to add objects such as trees and bushes.

"MAGIC THE GATHERING  REVIEW ***** A Fine Gathering DIFFICULTY LEVEL INTERMEDIATE STRATEGYZ WARGAMES MicroProse Finally Delivers on the Promise of PC Magic by Bob Proctor Wordane EDIBE De Fast Bledsassius BSS 've found a wonderful place to play Magic: The Gathering I can play as much as I want, whenever I want, and use legendary cards like Black Lotus and the Moxes without card sleeves and without spending hundreds of dollars. Yes, MicroProse has finally made it possible to play this popular card game on the computer. Their aim was to re-create the feel of the original card game and, for the most part, they've succeeded. Many veteran players will be playing with the power cards\" for the first time, and will enjoy the novel adventure-game environment of Shandalar. Is it paradise? Not quite; the card selection is small, the Al is a bit stupid, Shandalar has a tendency to crash (especially in the late stages; fortunately, the game autosaves), and there is a flagrant absence of multiplay. But it's very playable as is, and all of these issues are being addressed by the publisher. JADI DUELING CARDS Here is a regular duel if you just want to skip the extras and go for some quick Magic action. MTG veterans will feel right at home with the easy interface and faithful rules reproduction. the computer smokes you with one of your own decks do you cheer or cry? macie CASTING DESCRIPTION... MAGIC is really four products in one Tutorial, Deckbuilder, Duel, and Shandalar. All are single-player programs-a fifth product, allowing play between humans, is still in development. MicroProse says it's working on both multiplayer Magic and expansions which will add new cards and features. The Tutorial is FMV with actors, and is well done. It doesn't begin to teach you everything -there are 57 pages in the manual to explain the rules of MTGbut its a good beginning. I highly recommend the Tutorial to beginners. The Deckbuilder program is merely adequate and boring. It is easy to use, but offers even less than most shareware products in the way of testing and tuning features. Of course, you could argue that Magic's Duel program offers much better testing The Duel (you've seen it as the playable demo) is an amazing accomplishment-it captures every nuance of MTG There's a lot of information on the screen, but it's well organized and very clean-once you learn all the functions that can be accessed (via right clicks and small graphical elements). You choose a deck from a list and play it against the computer, who also uses a deck from the list. You can specify which deck the computer should use, let it pick randomly, or try to run the gauntlet and beat every deck on the list (there are 55 predefined decks, and you can add more using Deckbuilder). It's a funny feeling when, after you've beaten 34 decks in a row, A VISIT TO SHANDALAR For me, the best product is Shandalar, It's a sort of adventure/RPG with ducling as the combat system. There are four levels of difficulty: apprentice, magician, sorcerer, and wizard. You start with some gold, 10 life points, and a collection of spells (mostly of the major color you choose). The quality of your deck will depend on the difficulty level. Apprentices get a decent one-color deck, and wizards get a heap of rubbish -a random assortment of spells in all five colors. As you roam Shandalar, creatures appear and challenge you. Some are weak (4-8 lives), some are strong (12—20 lives). All duels are for ante, meaning that you risk losing a card from your deck; however, if you win, Price: $69.95 Minimum System Requirements: 486DX/100 (P120 recommended), 16MB RAM, 4x CD-ROM drive, SVGA graphics, Windows 95: supports Windows 95-compatible sound cards.

"MAGIC THE GATHERING REVIEW Deck Construction Rules Xarik ala tt Gladi. you gain a minimum of two cards. To build a collection, you can win cards, find them for free, buy them in villages, and carn them as rewards for quests. The ultimate goal is to defeat five powerful wizards (one for each color) and then beat Arzakon, the \"Big Foozle.\" It's a long, hard fight with literally hundreds of duels. Decks that were effective against opponents with 6 or 8 lives lose steam against monsters with 22 or more. Your strategy will have to be flexible and make use of the spells and special abilities (called World Magics) that come your way. You can concentrate on a single deck or build several, but to cope with changing conditions and opponents, you'll need to tune and retune your decks. It's the heart and soul of MAGIC. his is what makes the computer game different from any version of the card game.

BUT DID YOU GET THE SHOT? >>Continued from pg 161 four Black Lotus and four Mox Jet while you're at it. Shandalar adds a few more twists. The minimum deck size can be even smaller depending on your level of difficulty: from 40 for wizards down to a mere 25 for apprentices. Remember, smaller decks are more powerful when given the same cards. If you have only one Fireball or one Serra Angel, you will draw it much more often from a 30-card deck than from a 60-card deck. With such small decks, finding a single powerful spell can make a big difference. To avoid degenerate decks, the rule for duplicate cards has changed too. The smallest decks are limited to one copy of each spell. When your deck gets to 20 cards, you can have two copies; and at 40 cards, three. Only 60-card decks can have the normal 4 copies of a given spell. There is also a world magic called \"Tome of Enlightenment\" that increases this limit by one at each of the lower levels and removes it for decks over 60 cards. You heard right, no limits! Ever wonder what a deck with 10 Mishra's Factories, 8 Wrath of God. and 7 Swords to Plowshares would be like? It would be awesome, no doubt.

"***** REVIEW INTO THE VOID DIFFICULTY LEVEL STRATEGYI WARGAMES Keep It in the Void In a Genre of Classics, Playmates' Space Strategy Game Isn't Even Worthy of Mention by Tim Carter On top of the well-wom subject matter, the interface for ITV is clumsy and involves far too many commands that achieve far too little. Controlling planets and resources isn't intuitive, and some menus, such as ship design, are in strange and unrelated areas of the overall menu. 'The manual is also very, very weak; although this is compensated in part by an online tutorial. As a gamer who actually likes to read the manual, though, I can't help but feel ripped off when information crucial to playing the game can't be found in print.

"***** REVIEW  STAR COMMAND REVOLUTION DIFFICULTY LEVEL STRATEGYZWARGAMES Preemptive Cloning The First Launch in the Real-time Space Race Is Not a Winner by Martin E. Cirulis t the time of this writing. MASTER OF ORION II is in the midst of a third, disastrous patch, and most spaceploitation fans are pinning their hopes on Blizzard's STARCRAFT, a game that promises to bring all of WARCRAFI's speed and playability to the sci-fi wargame arena. But while we're all waiting for STARCRAFT, someone else has managed to sneak their own WARCRAFT-in-space clone off to market. GT Interactive may have beaten Blizzard to the punch by a few months with Star COMMAND REVOLUTION, but considering the quality of the game, don't think anybody will remember it by the time STARCRAFT ships. Research in this game is just parking your mothership next to a research station until you leam\" how to build each race's ships. The campaign game is a series of battles that take you through a very basic rebellion story. What is different in this game is a somewhat non-linear campaign that lets you go on to the next mission even if you don't finish the current one. Each map is connected to at least one other map by a travel gate, so if you can't find what you need to win one battle, you can go through a gate and try your luck in the next battle. Unfortunately, only your construction ship and your stored resources travel with you: There is no gathering an unstoppable armada in this game. SPACE BOULDERS One ridiculous aspect of the spacewar is these impenetrable rocks. You can't fly over them, instead you have to wind around them in maze-like fashion. Who ever heard of such silliness in space?

The biggest problem I have with SCR is that it isn't just like WARCRAFT-inspace, it is WARCRAFT-in-space. The designers haven't done anything to make this feel like a space game, except to have stars in the background instead of dirt. Call me a little anal retentive, but I have major problems with impassable \"terrain» in space. I am not talking about planets or moons, but ridiculous walls of «solid\" asteroids, gas, and crystal that force your ships to wind along idiotic paths and face utterly artificial bottlenecks. I can accept the premise of space terrain, but to make it impassable to ships, yet open to a weapons fire, is just sloppy game design. The rest of the game is your basic realtime, resource-gathering wargame, with nothing very original to recommend it.

"DENNIS MCCAULEY SPORTS |Tiger Green frioiel Parc STROKE ME Sierra's upcoming FPS: GOLF eschews the standard motion-captured golfers for 3D players—but 3D acceleration will only be available via a downloadable patch after the game ships Not surprisingly, Sierra titles will support the Rendition chip cither directly or via Direct 3D. Fasser is yet another member of the 3Dfx fan club, and indicates that Sierra will also support the high-end chip. While the FPS titles have migrated over to native Win 95 mode, Fasser notes that DOS-based games require direct chip support, since they don't access Direct 3D. This is an important consideration for Sierra, whose Papyrus subsidiary still favors DOS for its racing simulations like NASCAR 2. GOLDEN GLOVE EA Sports' TRIPLE PLAY 98 will be the last of the company's major sports releases to make the conversion to 3D. The PC version will follow the PlayStation release this summer. WAD 004 MPH executive mentions Power VR, 3Dfx, and S3 VRGE as likely candidates. And support is a key issue that's being kicked around at all of the game companies. After a football vapor-lock last year, Accolade is pinning its gricliron hopes on NFL LEGENDS 98. Grenewetzki can't commit himself on accelerated 3D support for LEGENDS, since much of the work on the game was completed for last year's planned release. \"It will probably be a carcspecific solution,\" he says. \"My guess is that we'll pick two cards, probably the S3 and one or the other of 3Dixor Power VR\" forn, but a downloadable 3D patch will be offered shortly after publication. What about the Sierra mainstays, FPS: FOOTBALL and BASEBALL? Both will appear later this year, but their graphics are still in the plann ing stages, according to Passer. \"We haven't talked about acceleration on BASEBALI,\" he says. \"There are some 3D fcatures that we're looking at.\" With FOOTBALL, \"It depends on which direction we go in '98,\"Passer says. \"Whether we make the big jump into 3D, or polish it up IT'S IN THE 3D GAME Ric Neil, one of the producers of MADDEN 97, tells me that EA Sports hopes to support as many chip sets as possible, while at the same time avoiding tuming off potential customers who don't have an accelerated 3D board under the hood. \"If you have a 3Dfx or ViRCE chip set you'll get extra eye candy that doesn't really matter for gameplay,\" says Neil. \"Maybe you'll get sideline people or cheerleaders, or a better rendered stadium. But gameplay will still be good on lower-end machines. Until they become a standard, we don't want to be packaged with something that says our product only works if you have this particular carcl.\" Just to show how fluid the whole 3D issue is, Neil indicates that his counterparts on the NHL side of the house may actually release both accelerated and nonaccelerated versions of their leading hockey sim. Neil also says that the '98 versions will see all EA Sports titles not only support 3D acceleration, but also move to Win 95-native status. And, just to make it more interesting, Ric whispers that previously arcade-oriented MADDEN 98 would be making a move onto Sierras turf. \"We're going to start trying to compete with FRONT PAGE for the first time,\" the producer says. \"It will be our first experiment in a strategic sports game. We'll have the action game stronger than ever with upgraded graphics, GrIP support, and four-and eight-button joystick support, but you won't have to use the joystick to play the game.\" While Neil remains mum on specifics, all signs point to a fascinating year for sports gamers. FRONT PAGE NEWS Of course you can't talk sports gaming without calling on Sierra. The publisher of the Front PACE SPORIS games has its own peculiar stake in the hardware side of the 3D market, since it markets the Screamin' 3-D, a Rendition-based accelerator. Scott Fasser, product manager of the Screamin' 3D, fields questions on his firm's move into 3D gaming. The big news is that FPS: BASKETBALI will debut in 1998, and will feature full 3D support. Sierras upcoming FPS: GOLF will not ship in accelerated Fans of TROPHY BASS 2 will be disap pointed to learn that no 3D support is upcoming, but Passer mentions plans for a force feedback system for joysticks, and an add-on for TB2 that will include new lakes and new spccies. Hey, an upgrade runs through it! Passer is unequivocal in expressing Sierras corporate enthusiasm for 3D acceleration. \"We're interested in doing as many accelerated games as possible,\" he says. \"Especially as sports games move toward true 3D. You'll see a lot more sports titles come out accelerated because it helps the frame rate and the look quite a bit.\" CGW JUNE 1997 "

"TERRY COLEMAN STRATEGY/WARGAMES strate Silicon Leaders COMPUTER SQUAD LEADER Is Finally Marching on SE Forget squad Leader CLOSE COMBAT this is the real SQUAD LEADER. The Game of Infantry Combat in WWII quad Leader The very name conjures images of hard-fought battles, where mapboards studded with arcane hexagonal overlays magically transform into French villages, bridges over the Ruhr, or Russian streets reduced to rubble. John Hills 70s masterpiece emphasized morale, training, and elan in a way that makes games such as CLOSE COMBAT pale by comparison. It was difficult to learn, more so to master; yet the flexibility and depth of the game made it the system for simulating squad-level combat Despite its daunting complexity, Squad Leader became hugely popular outside the small circle of hard-core wargamers, a tribute to its unique style and focus. Building on this cross-genre popularity (even adventure gamers found the roleplaying elements fascinating), allowed Squad Leader to sire a number of sequels. These in turn became more abstruse and complex with each new release, to the point where the system threatened to collapse under its own weight. So, led by Bob McNamara (now at Talonsoft), and development guru Don Greenwood, Avalon Hill's in-house staff redesigned Squad Leader from the ground up. Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) was an immediate success. To date, the series (including the original Squad Leader) has sold over one million units, with new add-on modules appearing annually. ago, tackling a project as huge as ASL seemed too daunting for their initial line of releases. Ironically enough, one of the first designs commissioned was THIRD REICH-a similarly complex project that took three-and-a-half years to release--so, in retrospect, AH may have made the correct decision. Buoyed by the success of the WORLD AT WAR series, Atomic Games contracted with Avalon Hill in 1994 to develop BEYOND SQUAD LEADER. Atomic's concept was that all of the data in Squad Leader could be translated to the computer, with the added tactical considerations of real-time play. While the final product did sport a psychological model, it had little, if anything, to do with that of Squad Leader. The morale system over-emphiasized the negative aspects of combat without really allowing for the positive aspects, such as heroisin in the line of fire. Of course, everyone knows by now that BEYOND SQUAD LEADER metamorphosed into CLOSE COMBAT and was published by Microsoft, not Avalon Hill, Rather than go into all the legal ramifications and recriminations between the parties involved (which would make a ENDLESS LOOP Squad Leader would seem an obvious choice for a computer game, since even its boardgame unit sales rival those of the SIMCry or WING COMMANDER series. But when the Avalon Hill computer line was jump-started by Jim Rose four years TALONS BRIEFINGS BLITZKRIEG (AVALON HILL) Evidently, when Atomic split from Avalon Hill, AH retained the rights to WORLD AT WAR. The next in the series will be BLITZKRIEG-no relation to the old AH boardgame-developed by the appropriately-named Grognard Simulations. SSI is increasingly moving into the fast and furious real-time strategy genre. Following the success of their own WAR WIND, SSI will be distributing Gametek's DARK COLONY. SSI insists, however, that they will still develop turn-based games as well. >Continued on pg 193 Gromar Satulations L CACYJGHT 1956 13 en E va JUNE 1997 CGW CGW "

"TERRY COLEMAN Continued from pg 191 solutions being discussed is to convert the game to a more manageable battalion-level scale. BRIEFINGS NEW SSG TITLES SSG is back with a vengeance! In addition to their upcoming WARLORDS III with Broderbund (see the sneak preview this issue), they are also well into designing REACH FOR THE STARS II for Microsoft. But, the big news is that THE LAST BLITZKRIEG will be distributed by SSI as DECISIVE BATTLES OF WWII, planned as the first release in an ongoing series. STRATEGYZWARGAMES ROAD TO MOSCOW (ARSENAL) ROAD TO Moscow is one of the most ambitious designs ever for a wargame, which might be why it isn't shipping anytime soon. The scale is primarily to blame: the entire WWII conflict in Russia is simulated on a strategic level, all the way down to each company! Even when the code is optimized, it's unlikely that even a P200 MMX chip could crunch this vast amount of calculations in any reasonable length of time (and we won't even speculate on how well the Al might perform given these restrictions). While it may disappoint Arsenal's loyal fans, we believe that president Jim DeGoey is taking the right step in attempting to revamp the product before release. Among the many SID MEIER OUT OF THE CIV GAME? If you're wondering why AGENTS OF JUSTICE is delayed, it might not be just because of MASTER OF ORION II. Steve Barcia is being asked to carry the creative torch for a lot of MicroProse's franchises. Scheduled projects for SimTex include MASTER OF Magic II and, evidently, CIVILIZATION III. The latter may not have Sid Meier's name above the title, because, according to Sid and his lawyer, \"I have my name back,\" for which Firaxis is undoubtedly grateful. Even Avalon Hill has a sci-fi strategy game in development, TANKWARS 2020, which combines turnbased strategy with arcade-action Virtual Reality. tank between two buildings, We'll replace a lot of this with more real-world' algorithms, and all of these complex computations will be handled by the computer. So it's more realism with less hassle for the gamer.\" ASL was one of the first board wargames to offer a good campaign game with Red Barricades. The computer game will carry on this tradition, with all of the tedious record-keeping chores (promo tions, experience, recruits, wounded soldiers, and so forth) once again handled by the computer. Its unlikely, with the number of top-notch scenarios published by Avalon Hill (with more appearing every few months in All's magazine The General), that COMPUTER SQUAD LEADER will consist of only one product. Rather it would seem to have the potential for a franchise line, with games covering each theater of war, much as the boardgame series does now. This would still mean that each game would have dozens of scenarios and multiple campaigns, all ticd to a central theme In addition to the strong Al for which Moylans games are known, the current plan is to support both email and Intemct play Far from being intimidated by such a daunting project, Moylan is enthused about the opportunity to breathe new life into a classic game:\"The enduring success of ASL is that no other game shows quite so well the differences in doctrine, training, and equip ment between the various armies of WWII. A Wehrmacht squad is differently equipped then a U.S. or British squad, and each nationality requires that you master different tactics. Our goal is to capture those dynamic differences in a playable fashion.\" This means a welcome lack of arguments over linc-of-sight, or questions concerning the appropriate defense modifier for a tank with open turret in a ravine after a medium rain on a Tuesday when the moon is full. While it's true that he doesn't see the BUILDING A CARDBOARD BRIDGE COMPUTER SQUAD LEADER will be turn-based. While Moylan isn't averse to an initiative-based system, as in OVER THE REICH, he wants a different feel than in STEEL PANTHERS. \"You want the information in the game to be accurate, but if the flow of play feels too frantic, you are going to lose a lot of gamers. Also, we've had a lot of people asking for email play, which doesn't work well in a phasedor initiative based system.\" ASL is a complex game; you can't frantically throw units around as you would in COMMAND AND CONQUER, because your squads aren't cannon fodder. So, the decision to go strictly turn-based makes good sense. And there are those hundreds of thousands of boardgame owners to consider, many of whom assuredly own computers and who will be expecting turn-based play.... ger company, Moylan says that he enjoys working with Avalon Hill: \"If I were elsewhere, I'd likely be forced into doing real-time games. Avalon Hill allows me to do the type of games I enjoy doing. If big sales come from COMPUTER SQUAD LEADER, fine. If not, I'm still making a living doing what I want to do, and how many people can say that?\" Those of us who enjoy playing Moylans games hope that he continues to follow his tum-based muse as far as it will take him.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: FLYING CORPS GAMER'S EDGE The Planes! The Planes! When you do finally decide to mix it up, always go after the high bandits first-conserve your altitude religiously! It's easy to dive after the rest once you've clowned the first target. It's much tougher when you find yourself thousands of feet below the fight and facing the prospect of a five-minute climb back up to where the action is. Use high speed hit-and-run passes for your first few attacks to milk any initial energy advantage for all it is worth, especially when your opponents are flying more maneuverable planes. Avoid steep dives, however, since the rapid acceleration makes control and accurate aiming difficult. At times, you will probably be forced to fight on even terms, or at a slight disadvantage. These scenarios usually begin with a dangerous head-on pass. The danger comes from both the risk of collision computer pilots just love to play chicken-and the Al's aptitude for making such zero-deflection shots count. Evade enemy fire by diving a bit and jinking just before you come into range. Though this will save you from taking damage, expect immediate casualties on both sides as your wingmen and the enemy blast each other to bits on the first pass. This gives you all the more reason to work for the upper hand before engaging-when circumstances permit. ach of the six aircraft you can fly has a different character.

The most mission types. The End Game Eventually, most encounters degenerate into relatively low-speed turning battles, so it is necessary to know how to handle yourself in one. Turn continuously in a furball to present an elusive target for any bandits trying to line up on you. Constant maneuvering actually makes spotting them easier because of the way a turn tends to move pursuing aircraft out of your blind spot directly astern. However, that will do you no good if you neglect to look back there periodically. Shoot enemies off the tails of your wingmen when you can, but don't case off on your turn for too long unless you're sure no one is sncaking up behind you. If you get locked into a tight turning fight with a bandit, use an occasional low yo-yo (entering a shallow diving turn to gain some speed and temporarily improve your turn rate before climbing back up toward your opponent) to pull lead, and try to pepper him with a deflection shot. A few hits usually degrade the target aircraft's performance STRAFING RUN A slow, shallow dive will maximize the time available for you to line up and hose down your ground targets. EASY PICKINGS The typical tail gunner in a two-seater isn't very accurate, but it's prudent to play it safe and attack from his blind area behind and below. JUNE 1997 CGW 199 "

Woort Tank Depot Aeri Afrie 20 The Battle of Cambrai nlike the other campaigns, winning the Tank Battle scenario demands more than just good piloting skills: an effective strategy is also essential. As Jasta leader, your goal is simple: Slow the British advance until reinforcements can arrive. To accomplish this, you must strike a balance between offense and defense while maintaining the health and morale of your squadron. Artillery is your most potent weapon against the enemy's marauding tanks, but it is susceptible to aerial attacks. Disrupt such operations whenever possible. Enemy ground attack planes operate individually, all along the front lines.

There's nothing like a little fricasseed Antaren to put me into a better mood. Last month, I explained how to build a stalke and cconomically viable empire. While peace is essential to achieving stability and strength, war is essential to winning the game. At some point you will have to begin constructing a flect and conducting offensive operations. You can expect your enemies to respond in kind, thus requiring defensive action on your part. Generally, it's a good idea to have at least two main fleets one for offense and (at least) one for defense. Begin to build up command enemy planet. Also, you needn't leave your main battle fleet protecting a weak system after it falls to your troops. As soon as you control the system it falls within the protection of your defensive fleet. Obviously, you will want to pick your first opponent carefully: You want an enemy who is not too strong, but has enough decent systems to make it worth conquering. If you're not sure, do a little scouting of your prospective enemies systems before making your decision. Once you've decided on your first victim, leverage as many goodies out of him through peaceful means before declaring war.

You should have enough spies built and waiting to simultaneously wage a serious espionage campaign along with widespread combat, and you should have enough marines in transports that your first space victory will also be your first planetary conquest If your technological research is moving at high speed, there's a good chance that large ships will be halfway obsolete even as they roll off the production lines. If you think this is likely to be the case, you may want to build 3/4 ships initially, with the engines, hull, and specials intact, but with space left to upgrade key weapons or ancillary systems through a quick relit immediately after your initial production is completed. Of course, the downside to this approach is that you could be forced to defend a key The great Gnolam and Mellor come together for yet another important moment in history, Marine Barracks Cost Here: 60 Maint.

Also, if they declare war on you, your diplomatic penalty will be considerably less and other races will be less likely to turn on you. points as you approach the point at which you want to begin a major shipbuilling effort. Communications technology and star bases are crucial to economically maintaining a significant military force. For defensive purposes, consider researching warp interdictors and star gates as well. Stargates will allow you to defend your entire empire with a single defensive flect, which can shuttle rapidly between threatened systems. Also, owning star gate technology makes it much easier to hold newly conquered planets.

Make sure you con't waste valuable production time building obsolete weapons that you know will be replaced as soon as the ship is completed. Its better to leave a few empty slots and then add in the latest weapons during the initial refit. Tactical combat is actually quite simple in MOO II. Although there are a tremen dous number of options available, most of your key decisions will be made at the ship design stage. Once you get into battle, play to the strengths of your fleet, and don't be afraid to run away if things look hopeless. It's generally a good idea to take a look at your enemy's larger ships at the start of combat to identify which ships have leaders on board. Many leaders' bonuses will affect the entire flect, so taking them out carly will make the rest of the battle that mich easier. Still, most tactical battles are won through having superior ships.

"MOO II GAIVIER'S EDGE MAKE ONE MISTAKE AND YOU'RE HISTORY. PLANET EXPLORER TH BIR    Small Med A dangerously authentic world task, rather than a single ship configured to do everything. For the most part, bombs are a complete waste of time and effort, at least until your enemies have strong planetary shields. Your beam weapons and missiles should be more than sufficient for destroying defensive systems -and for planetary bombardment, if thats to your taste. In MOO II, support systems on your ships make a big difference to the effectiveness of your main weapons systems. For instance, there is zeon missiles only do 30 points of damno point in building beam weapon ships age (until you can MIRV them, of until you have a decent targeting com course).

"MOO II GAMER'S EDGE HOW EVOLVE OR D I E arly in the game, long before you should be thinking about attacking any of your opponents, you may wish to build a fleet just strong enough to take out one or more of those pesky space monsters that guard the really valuable systems. The computer is usually quite slow in attacking them, but it will get around to it eventually, so don't wait too long. The trick to low-tech monster bashing is using weapons that will have at least some effect: Forget about beam weapons altogether, as they will generally just waste your time. Buy hoards of missiles, and if you have the technology-gyro destabilizers. Both will automatically hit their targets, a crucial factor before you have advanced computer technology. Build cheap, very expendable ships with the maximum weapons and minimum defenses. Most monsters will kill one ship per turn while defending, but don't have the versatility to take on a 10-ship fleet. Evolution THE GAME OF INTELLIGENT LIFE Luin im Tex recently released a ver sion 1.3 patch for MOO II that has some problems with the diplomatic system; this may make winning so easy as to make the game pointless. Other than this defect, however, the patch greatly balances some of the more one-sided elements of the game. For instance, plasma cannons will cost more, ion cannons will be less effective, and the attacking fleet will always move first during space combat. These changes should make for a better game, without significantly changing most strategies outlined in this article. The attacker-moves-first rule, however, means that your systems must be defended by a strong fleet. Planetary defense, already pretty weak, will be completely ineffectual again the huge attack fleets the computer likes to send against your home systems. It goes without saying that you should attack as much as possible in order to take advantage of this new rule. A Darwinian strategy game where you either get smart... or go extinct. Another key factor to keep in mind when designing ships is that your weapons will fire in the order that they are placed on the ship. This can have important ramifications for the overall effective ness of your ships in combat. During tactical combat, for instance, it's not unusual to drop an enemy ship's shields with one attack, then use a second ship to inflict damage to the hull by firing into the area formerly protected by the now-down shield. However, if you have gyro destabilizers as you first weapon system, you will spin the enemy ship, more often than not leaving it with a fully functional shield facing your beam weapons. Also, most beam weapons have special characteristics which can be used in combination to inflict extra damage on defending ships if they are used in the correct order. For instance, neutron blasters damage shields directly, thus making them a good initial firing weapon. When neutron blasters are combined with ion pulse cannon, which passes directly through armor and the hull to target internal systems, they can make a devastating one-two attack. On the other hand, if you start with, say, plasma cannon or mauler devices, both carrying significant brute force type attacks likely to decimate enemy shields, there is no point in following up with neutron blasters unless you want to kill off enemy marines. When you order your weapons properly and combine this with modificationssuch as shield piercing and armor piercing--you can boost the overall attack capability of your slips considerably & Coming this fall from Discovery CHANNEL MULTIMEDIA CIRCLE READER SERVICE #064 JUNE 1997 CGW "

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS Diablo A Beginner's Guide to Multiplayer Gaming in the Depths of Hell by Thierry Nguyen Sorcerer IABLO is one of those games that simulates real life. You might ask how venturing down into a dungeon to fight off the Lord of Terror and his many minions is a simulation of real life, but the realism springs up when the word battle.net comes into play. When you step into the world of multiplayer DIABLO, you enter a world filled with bargains, con men, patron saints, avengers, and murderers. This guide will give you a few pointers on multiplayer games in general. You'll also learn about play styles, how to fight the creatures of Hell without getting snagged by friendly fire, and get a listing of the hottest items for trade on battle.net. So, strap on that armor and polish that sword, it's time to take on Diablo with a buddy. Rogue Warrior Three Times the Carnage One large, fundamental difference between single-player and multiplayer DIABLO is the fact that multiplayer DIABLO has various difficulty levels, some of which are restricted to higher level characters. What does a change in difficulty yield? The main difference between difficulty levels is stronger monsters. For example, a balrog has an average of about 200 hit points on Normal difficulty. Step up to Nightmare level and that average jumps up to about 350 hitpoints. Try to knock them around in Hell difficulty, and they swell to around 550 hitpoints. If blood knights at 200 were bad, how about a blood knight with 700? Easier creakures simply take a bit longer to kill (a skeleton is still a skeleton, no matter how pumped up it is). Its when the advocates and hellspawn have hit points in the multiple hundreds that adventuring gets troublesome. With the increased hit points come additional experience and cash...and resistances. It's nice to be able to fight skeletons on Hell difficulty and get 4,000 experience points and 300 gold. Thanks to Hell difficulty, it is pretty hard for DIABLO players to go broke. The extra gold isn't worth it when fighting Hell advocates though; they become resistant to fire and immune to every type of spell. So, with the added boost of more money and experience, you also get more headaches in terms of monsters' outrageous hit point levels and new immunities. LILILIT Tag-team Tactics You might suddenly be a bit apprehensive about taking on the elevated monsters, but don't worry too much. In multiplayer DIABLO, your friends can come along for some added muscle. We'll address the issue of whom to trust later, but for now, lets assume you can go around a corner and not get nailed in the back by these people. There are essentially two styles of fighting short-and long range. Of course, coordinating these two styles of attack is difficult. In general, the warrior will do all the short-range fighting, while the sorcerer and the rogue will hang back and shoot at their leisure. Of course, this lends itself to the danger of friendly-firc, as arrows and spells can still hurt friends. This clelicate balance of long and short is at the crux of multiplayer DIABLO. One simple solution is to have the different characters split up and face opposite directions when entering a room. This way, the fighter GOLD VIPER TOTAL KILLS 7 TRENE HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER Here is the \"lure.\" While the balrog and three gold vipers concentrate on the level 32 rogue, my level 31 rogue safely picks them off from a distance.

"GAMER'S EDGE ADVENTURE GAME TIPS STRATEGY & TIPS Scorpia's Mail You've Got Questions? Scorpia Has Answers ell, here we are in the mailroom again. Something's creeping around outside the door, and it's spring, so we'll just keep the door shut. Not that spring is a bad time of year, but if spring is here, can summer be far behind? And summer, as you all know, is always the worst time of year for game releases. Of course, there hasn't been a whole lot of new stuff around since Christmas, either. The post-Christmas season period has been a bit dull, and I'm hoping we'll see some good games show up before the mid-year doldrums set in. Meanwhile, we'll have to make do with what we've got, and what we've got is some mail to check. Discworld II Having a spot of bother getting into that Novelties Shop? You can't do it until Act II (so if you're still at the start, leave it for now). And even then you need a couple of things from the Holywood set to get in the Shop. Heavy, man! But maybe not heavy enough? Well, just stick to it, and you'll come up a perfect 10. Really! Wizardry Nemesis You can spend a lot of time in the Nithera library wondering what's going on. The answer: not much. There are some interesting books to read, but the only thing of real interest here is an optional (read: not necThe Pandora Directive Fable Extended Vir's pass wiper Milor's tasty Potografica el Als Hidr strated to Michats Airport of the cu WANAWA EXAMINE HINT PENTRU MOVE OPEN TALK ortore ome gamers are having a little trouble finding a certain box in a certain sewer. Even with the handy tracking device, it isn't easy. The thing to keep in mind is that you want to check the walls, and not merely at eye-level (hey, that would be too easy! Heh!). Also, take your time moving the cursor around, because what you're looking for is small, and can be overlooked if you're not careful. hile not the toughest game around, this one does have its moments. One of them is in the Engulfed Fortress. Before hitting the briny deep, you may want to save the game. You only meet the seahorses once, and after the conversation, one of them should hand you an item. This object is crucial to success down here. If you don't get it, you'll have to do the conversation over again until you do (which means, of course, restoring the game). So take your chances and hope for the best. Daggerfall DAGGERFALL is still the most popular topic on the mail list. Considering the complexity of the game, that's not surprising. One circumstance that gives people trouble is when you become a vampire or werebeast. First, once you've made the change, there's not much you can do except go on and wait for the werehunters to catch up to you. They will offer a quest to cure the condition. In the meantime, as a werebeast or vampire, you do have to go hunting to keep up your strength. The game will let you know when that's necessary.

"TIPS! Action 25 Strategy/Wargames MAGIC THE GATHERING: BATTLEMAGE Though many of you will opt for MicroProses title over Acclaims, some others might still be trying to best this real-time adaptation of the card game. Here are more tips for winning in BATTLE MAGE, so you can move on to more MAGIC. AVOID CARDS THAT HAVE CONSTANT ACTIVATION COSTS You can't afford many high maintenance spells that require constant re-activation. Spells like Circle of Protection and Lifeforce are especially bad because they must be used in reaction to something, and the timing is very tricky. They will distract you when you should be using your time and mana to cast new spells. Note that this applies to pumpable creatures too. For example, Killer Bees can be powerful in the card game but are next to worthless here. Keeping them at moderate strength would take all your time every turn! A Shivan Dragon is better since it is a strong creature without pumping, but I still wouldn't spend time pumping him unless I were pretty certain he QUAKE MISSION PACK No. 1: SCOURGE OF ARMAGON If, like us, you think Hard difficulty in behind it. Run up the railing and onto the QUAKE is for wusses, then follow us to the crates -but be careful not to drop off the Nightmare difficulty level in Mission PACK crates to the floor below. No. I: SCOURGE OF ARMAGON. Look to your left and you'll see a red To enter the Nightmare slipgate, follow arrow pointing up inside a small room hid| the corridor to the Easy slipgate and then den to the left behind the crates (see the make a right at the Easy doorway. Then, screenshot). Run in, and an elevator will continue left down the corridor. As the take you up.

Heres a few tips to keep you alive and running (Scorpia will provide a complete walkthrough of the game in the next issue.) was not going to be blocked. A Sengir Vampire, which can grow without your assistance, is usually better than the Dragon 1. USE BIG CREATURES The wisdom you learned playing the card game must be rethought. Use more big monsters and fewer little ones. Along with Vampires and Dragons: Serra Angels, Mahamoti Djinns, and Craw Wurms should be staples in your deck. Nightmare and Force of Nature are very playable, but watch out for the Lord of the Pit -it's hard to keep enough creatures in play to satisfy his appetite! Be sure to look around in all directions (QUAKE fans should be used to this.) You'll often find ammo or other goodies hidden below (or above) your direct line of vision. Look out for enemies hiding above. The shotgun is your friend. It is a rapid-fire weapon with plenty of available ammo. Don't waste your time with the slower, more powerful weapons when you're in deep trouble. The time you wait to recharge may be your final moments alive When in doubt--run. Sometimes you can advance in the game without killing everything in sight. Three words: save, save, save. 3. 4. CGW JUNE 1997 "


"TIPS! Razrushatsa Tankov Nyest2 Puzzles Classics POKER CHALLENGE PM NE Simulation/Space ACES OVER EUROPE A few issues back, we listed some new aircraft and scenarios for ACES OVER EUROPE, but at the time we were only able to locate the proper patch files on the CompuServe online service. We've since discovered that ACES fans can now access a wealth of patches and new aircraft for RED BARON, ACES OF THE PACIFIC, and ACES OVER EUROPE on Timoleon Ravazoulas' Aces Page. The current project in the works by Timoleon and his cohorts is the Eastern Front, 1943 scenario, featuring new Russian and German aircraft. This is a team effort, so whether you're interested in helping out or just checking out some of the new aircraft, head over to http://www.netor. gr/user_pages/timoleon/aces.htm. 8:00: G-NOME B . 3.HOCK @ut.ee One way to take advantage of the computer opponent is to attract its attention while separated from it by a large obstacle, such as a stone wall. Once you have its attention, step back at least 120 meters from the obstacle and your enemy. Circle around behind the Al, maintaining your distance. The Al will keep trying to reach your previous position, despite the obstacle remaining in its path. Meanwhile, you may pummel it at your leisure. Only after its vehicle is destroyed will the AI turn to attack you. The key in POKER CHALLENGE is to recognize that as long as you make over your $112 ante, you are actually better off getting a mix of hands. The difference between the final score and your S112 ante (minus your remaining unplayed cards) is multiplied by cach type of hand scored. So, if you finished with a score of 123 (after remaining cards were deducted), and you had a Pair, \"Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, and Flush, the final score would be: 123 112 x 5 [types of hands] = 11x 5 = 55 or, 123 + 55 178. In this sample game, it's tempting to go for the Full House, but you're actually better going for the lower-paying Flushes and Straights. We barely managed to top $112 in this round, but ended up with over $200 paid out, because we had several types of hands. Also, you should always strive to get your jokers to the bottom of a row. Note in our sample game here how much flexibility the joker at the bottom of the row provides, allowing us to get rid of any unwanted card. In fact, if it weren't for the three jokers here, there's no way we could reach the S112 threshold. Sports Paketler O LINKS LS LINKS LS fans have a plethora of online resources at their disposal, but one Web site that's way above (or would that be below?) par is The Hackers Corner at: www.emperor.com/www/ gulley/s/links.html This elegantly designed site is a huge repository of useful information and files, including the latest patches, sound files, tournament utilities, and links to other LINKS sites. Best of all is a listing of every course available for the game with a description, numerical rating (based on Championship player and tee settings), and screen shot of the course. If you're a serious LINKS-head, grab your bag and spikes and cruise on over to the The Hacker's Comer clubhouse. JUNE 1997 CGW "

If designers want to help, they can give Net games the ability to flag IP addresses and inform the player if they are about to get into it with a computer on the cheater list. Let's make social pressure do the work for us, and exclude people whose behavior is unacceptable. The most serious threat to the graphic multi-user dungeon games, which are trying to catch on as viable social and economic entities, are the Killer types, or PKer's (Player Killers). as they have come to be known. I am sure the suits at Studio 3D0 and BattleNet think it's great that players are spending money hunting each other; unfortunately, for every hour spent at the game by the sociopathic murderer, or those who let them selves get caught up in useless revenge, 10 hours are lost to the game from newbies who sign on, are pointlessly butchered, and departnever again to return. E ven experienced gamers can grow tired of having to keep an eye out for virtual serial killers instead of actually getting into the game world. ULTIMA ONLINE Director Starr Long promises there will be dire conse quences in his game for killing other players, and that the online staff will frown on the practice. But I wonder if this will change anything, unless someone in charge is prepared to lose the patronage of a few losers for the sake of a more viable community? To all you MUDers out there who defend Pking as \"part of the game,\" why don't you haul your passive aggressive little butts over to a game where killing other players is the point, like QUAKE, NETMECH, or AIRWARRIOR, and face players who actually expect you to come at them? Is that too much like a fair fight? When it comes down to it, the only real way for online gaming to defend itself against these pathetic new vermin is to add a little responsibility to all the anonymous power that the Net provides. Game servers should start looking into setting player's names/ personas into stone, so that some sort of record of your behavior can follow you around in a game. After all, a place where everyone knows your name\" can be a real deterrent to being a psycho-geek. & Computer Gaming World (ISSN 0744-6667) is published monthly by Zitt-Davis Publishing Company, One Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016.
