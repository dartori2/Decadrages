"CREDITS Thell1 Computer Gaine Magazine MAY 1998 PUBLISHER Jonathan Lane At the ripe old age of 23, Elliott Chin is the junior member of the CGW staffbut we like it that way. With an abundance of energy and almost unerring gaming instinct, he assists the CGW greybeards by doing what they can't, like playing fighting games and opening childproof containers. Elliott never thought that the countless hours he spent playing Civ and EMPIRE would have paid off, but now he is CGW's Strategy/Wargames Editor and PlayStation specialist. A \"gamer-of-all-trades.\" Elliott relaxes by badgering troops in strategy games, pulverizing enemies in space combat sims, or beating up the reflex-challenged in his favorite fighting games. Of course, all play and no work would make Elliott an extremely happy person, so the senior editorial staff pays close attention to his workload, and then triples it. His non-gaming hobbies include building an impressive Lego armada that will one day rule the New World.

Beginning this month, he takes over as the new action. games columnist, donning the crimson robe of the High Priest of Action. In addition, Peter researched and wrote most of the material for this month's Sony PlayStation supplement. DESIGN Art Director Edwin C.

When he's not cruisin' the Net to get scoring updates for his hockey pool, Gordon is busy hot-wiring his Pentium to run the lat est racing simulators and sports games. Formerly an agent for a professional auto racing team, he now runs his own one-man desktop publishing business in Vancouver, B.C. First turned on to computer racing with INDIANAPOLIS 500, Gordon continues to seek substance over style in his pursuit of the ultimate digital sports experience.

To subscribe, simply call 303-665-8930, and specify that you want the CD-ROM ver sion. RESCUED ADRIFT How Do We Classify Games? Action/Arcade (AC): The emphasis is on hand-eye coor. dination and reflexes, usually emphasizing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure (AD): Games wherein you control an alter ego and move through a story line or sequence of events, where puzzle solving takes precedence over conversation and combat. Classics/Puzzles (CP): Classics are old stand-bys and parlor games that appeal to many different types of gamer. Examples include: backgam mon, bridge, chess, MONOPOLY, parchesi, Risk, and SOLITAIRE. Puzzle games are computer games which emphasize spa tial relationships, word games and/or problem-solving without requiring gamers to follow a storyline. Examples would be: SHANGHAI, TETRIS and ZIG-ZAG. Role-Playing (RP): RPGs are a subset of adventure games, but stress character development, often through improving stats or other attrib. utes. Conversations with nonplayer characters (NPCs) and tactical combat are generally more important than in Adventure games. Finally, the game world tends to be large, and the plot less linear, often with some quests/treks outside the main storyline. Simulations (SI): Highly realistic games from a first-person perspective: you may drive a realistically simulated race car, fly a military aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed sci fi environment. Usually poly. gon-filled technology is used to build the simulated world on the fly. Sports (SP): The sports game category is a broad genre which includes action (NBA Live) and strategy games (FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO) based on sports Strategy (ST): Problem solving, shortand long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X-COM, OUTPOST, MOO), as well as \"pure\" strategy games and \"software toys\" such as SIMCITY. Wargames (WG): A subset of strategy games, these recreate historical conflicts from a command perspective. They may be tactical, operational, or strategic, and stress anything from logistics and firepower to morale and leadership. They may be simple (PANZER GENERAL, EMPIRE II) to incredibly detailed and complex (PACIFIC WAR). THEY SEND YOU HOW DO WE RATE?

"JOHNNY WILSON ZIFF-DAVIS PUBLISHING GROUP CHAIRMAN AND CEO Eric Hippeau are play. Therefore, games are for children. That's the equivalent of say ing that all Germans are Nazis, all Irishmen are terrorists, and all editors are arrogant. Children play to try on roles, to imagine possibilities, to experience the exhilaration of competition and its consummate reward of success. The same is true with all of life. Professional writers play with words; professional businessmen play with business plans, professional soldiers play with simulations, and profession TE CONSUMER MEDIA GROUP President J Scolt Briggs Vice President J.

I n order to be applicable to reallife, the lessons of play must be \"interpreted\" by the gamer. Sometimes, this interpretation will be subconscious and the gamer improves his/her perspective/skill set without knowing it. Sometimes, this interpretation takes a conscious leap. Whether one is a Freudian who believes a healthy mind requires \"reality testing\" (play is essentially testing possibilities without final consequences) or a Jungian who believes that \"phantasy\" is required to reach the imagination and inspire interpretation, play is tremendously important-especially for people who are willing to change and grow. Jung understood why people resist play. According to George B. Hogenson (Jung's Struggle With Freud, p. 138). Jung maintained that \"It is phantasy that makes interpreta tion possible, and the activity by which phantasy works out its various interpretations is play.\" Jung went on to suggest that most people, being in the grip of orthodoxy, are not willing to open up their field of experience to the emergence of the opposites from the unconscious. In other words, play is threatening to people who are not mature enough to want to learn more about themselves. So, the next time someone bashes you about your \"childish\" hobby, ask them what they're afraid of. Those who are afraid to play are people who are afraid to grow, to change, to beeven if they write for the San Francisco Chronicle. Silly writer, games aren't just for kids. al artists play with stone, paint, clay and junk. Prior to presidential debates and news conferences, I am told that it is standard procedure to role-play the event. Prior to my one and only network television appearance, I role played several scenarios with a professional public relations consultant. To repeat-play helps us prepare for life. By playing, all of these professionals prepared better for an upcoming experience. Of course, someone will suggest that playing DOOM death matches or solving MYST doesn't prepare one for life. This straw someone might even go on to state that the examples above are \"reality-based\" play and therefore, subject to special case consideration. SimCity is okay by this logic because it reflects real lessons in urban planning, but Accolade's upcoming DEADLOCK isn't because it reflects a fictitious situation. Hogwash!

"LETTERS LETTER OF THE MONTH adults.\" I believe that this is an incorrect statistic and should be corrected in your next edition (sic) of Computer Gaming World. Thaux, KENO via the Internet THE MERRY PRANKSTERS erhaps it is a comment on the broader, fanciful aspects of our hobby and avocation that it took me all the way to the bottom of the article\" in the READ.ME section of the April issue to realize Thad been had. We have come to expect so much from the folks that feed our addiction to this sort of escapist entertainment. Bigger, Better, laster. More seems to be the catch phrase of this industry so much so that even absurdist parody takes a while to sink in! Either that or I am more gullible than I thought. But as I sit here pulling the fish hook out of my cheek, saving myself at the last minute from being pulled into your clever boat. I console myself with the idea that April Fools jokes that cannot by reason of a set schedule be delivered on the actual day have a better chance of success. Enjoy your day and thanks for a great publication that just keeps getting better. Gerry Palmer via AOL St. Louis, MO were very nice to tell me that the OEM version of Windows 95 now being shipped by Microsoft doesn't have any mouse driver for MS DOS 7, and the CD ROM drivers are hidden. Well, fortunately, I still had my old machine. I copied the MS Mouse drivers, put them into my machine, and put the command in my Autoexec.BAT (just like the old clays, huh?). After a bit of exploration, Micron also helped me get the CD ROM drivers into the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Will most new computer buyers be able to figure this out? What will they do with their new machine if they can't play [a DOS game]? I wonder if the folks up in the Pacific Northwest told the game developers about this. I wonder if the folks at the Justice Department would consider this restraint of trade (maybe FURY3 isn't selling so well?). In any event, let the buyer beware... MS doesn't want anyone using anything but Windows 95, and they are looking for every angle to make it so. Robby Robertson Lakewood CO An independent suncy of game buyers in October of 1995 indicated that the average age of game buyers is 31 years of age. This is in line with other surveys, most notably the annual consumer survey of the Software Publishers Association. You and your friends may thoughi\" othenvise, but it won't change the facts. APOLLO FOOLS You did know that whole business about real spaceships in WING COMMANDER V was an April Fools joke, didn't you? ROBBY DOES WINDOWS Tread with some interest your article on Plug N Play, where those who want to play DOS games are going to have problems. Sure made me change my mind about PNP Soundblaster cards. But this is not the end of the story: After deciding that it might be unwise financially to upgrade my system, I found a buyer for my old computer and ordered a P150 from Micron. It arrived and started up into Windows 95 just fine. I began loading my Windows games, and everything worked fine. Then, I loaded Caesar II. I inserted this Autoplay CD ROM game. It said we were going to MS DOS mode. Imagine my surprise when it said it couldn't find a CDROM drive. I went out to DOS, and guess what, neither could MS DOS 7. I tried another CD-ROM game in DOS. Then, I called Micron. 'They THE CASE OF THE MISSING PERFORMANCE Your magazine is one of the best. Period. I've never been disappointed. I wrote this letter to especially thank Loyd Case for his insightful and extremely helpful tip in your March issue. In his column, he gave a lip on how to make Windows 95's refresh rate and graphics run faster and smoother. His comments hit a bullseye! I thought that my slow refresh rate could be contributed to one of those \"Windows 95 things\" (you know what I'm talking about). 1 decided to give his suggestion a try. Boy, did it work! Windows 95 works much better now. Kudos to Mr. Case! Betsy Huey Ruston, LA We don't know about the conspiracy you suggest, but we're sure that sharing your experience will probably sare some new Micron owner some anxious moments.

I wish (MicroProse) would take the approach Interplay did with STONEKEEP and keep their customers informed on the progress of the game. As of right now, we haven't got a clue. Finally I want to thank Computer Gaming World for creating and maintaining such a great magazine which is the source for a lot of the information on my webpage. William R Brickles III via the Internet AVENIDA DE VSTOL Our man in Brazil says that you can race backwards in SCREAMER, but perhaps that's because he lives south of the equator, reading your magazine monthly Now that your February issue's Pipeline states that the game will be pushed back until Summer '96, feel that I have to find a way to express my anger and frustration. My questions to MicroProse remain unanswered, and I feel that I must to tum to the print media to be recog nized. As you well know, there are hunchreds of thousands (maybe millions) of Magic players out there that can do nothing but play this game. When we first heard that a computer version would be released we immediately became excited. After all, now we can play without having to find a bunch of friends at one o'clock in the morning. When I heard that MicroProse was making the game, I thought, \"Well, OK, IL could be worse.\" Well, I've been waiting for nearly a year now for this game to be released and they still have nothing to show for it, and I'm disgusted. I have taken upon myself to sift through various sources of information and rumors to create a wcb page containing a lot of information about this game. You can find the page at http://www.on.com/users/town/ma gic2.html. Once MicroProse actual ly did reply to one of my e-mails, but they would disclose nothing. I hope that MicroProse realizes that putting this game at the bottom of their priority list after putting so much hype into it is severely hurting their company's image in the eyes of many Magic players. I, for one, realize the incredible task it would be to program the game would take a very long time and understand the delays. What I don't understand is why they refuse to release any information about the game except that it will be Win95 and that Sid Meier will work on it. I don't know how big find. As we reported in the Sightings section of the April issue, Sid Meier is actually doing a lot of the coding for Magic: THE GATHERING. So, it's not just a matter of PR in this case. Also, Sid has changed the Al since we saw the game last year so that it is no longer deck-based. In addition, your character will now walk through a typical acenture/role-playing perspective of the world rather than moring from static hot spot to static hot spot as we described it in last year's Sneak Preview. Further, things have changed considerably in the online world since last year. The online service where the head-to-head game was to have debuted is no longer as viable for a product of this magnitude as it once was, and plans are changing to reflect the changes in the online world.

Active Movie is something of a \"wrapper\" technology that serves as a structure within which all media types, including AVI, QuickTime, WAV, MPEG, and MIDI files, can be synched and played. Microsoft is positioning Active Movie as a key multimedia title development tool that tightly integrates with DirectX APIs. Active Movie has its own internal time code to which all streamed media can be slaved, which is intended to improve audio-video synchronization during playback. Multiple media types can be pieced together as well, for example, an MPEG file with a MIDI sequence added for back. ground music.

The so-called \"technology demo\" allows null-modem and modem-based head-to-head matches, and up to eight players for a full-on LAN-based splatterfest. QUAKE is a true 3-D polygon-based world where everything, including the players, has much more depth and realism than any of id's previous games. Though some of the graphics are still pretty raw, the overall effect is enough to keep you coming back for gore. Highlights include new weapons like a nail gun, and its bigger, uglier cousin, the super nail gun. For more direct results, the grenade tosser and rocket-propelled grenade weapons will leave opponents speechless (and probably headless). As a match progresses, the Because the death match is basically an early beta of the forthcoming final version, there are some rough edges, though its rough-hewn state leaves it much more configurable. The entire game is driven from a command prompt where you can tweak a lot of different game attributes ranging from the color of your player's clothes (can you say \"camouflage\"?) to the amount of gravity the level has. Getting a LAN-based frag a-thon to work, with one system acting as the \"server\" to the other systems, took some doing. However, having additional players makes for enhanced mayhem.--D.

Stealth 3D DIAMOND Diamond Stealth iamond will be shipping its Stealth 3D 2000 by late June, but we got hold of a beta unit with beta drivers and were pretty impressed. We checked out the Stealth running an early build of DESCENT II that takes advantage of some of the Stealth's rendering features, and under Windows 95 we ran MECHWARRIOR 2-DirectDraw drivers and all. The Stealth is based on S3's VIRGE 3D chip, and has hardware support for Z-buffering, MIP mapping, bi-linear filtering. texture mapping with perspective correction, alpha blending and fogging. The Stealth will support titles using Direct3D when they ship: meanwhile, the planned software bundling will include DESCENT II, DESTRUCTION DERBY, and TERMINAL VELOCITY. The estimated street price is $249 with 2MB of EDO DRAM. In our preview tests, the \"enhanced\" version of DESCENT II was expectedly shaky in overall performance, but the rendering quality was very impressive. Especially striking were the detailed texture maps on the walls, and the anti-aliasing of all vertices kept the \"jaggies\" to a minimum. MAY 1996 "

"SNEAK PREVIEW DEADLOCK Construct & Conquer GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT SimCity Meets Civilization In A Cosmic Battle Over A Newfound Planet by Denny Atkin ith few habitable planets in known space, and all spacefaring races desperate for room to grow, Gallius IV was a rare prize indeed. The newly dis. covered plane seemed ready to ignite a war of previously unseen proportions. As the anti-matter beams began flying, it became evident that the battle would have no victor--the mass of firepower gathered over Gallius IV would only burn away the planet's atmosphere i unleashed. I was a no-win situation. A deadlock. A treaty was hastily crafted--the Compact of Gallius IV-as none of the races wished to see their potential price incinerated. Each alien race would send a group of colonists down to the planet, equipped with only the bare essentials. The race that first proved capable of building five cities-or the race that could first wipe out all the other colonists-would gain possession of Gallius IV to exploit or colonize as it pleased. DESTRUCTION ZONE Although battles are turn-based, you can view real-time replays, such as this building falling to Uva Mosk forces SWORDS OR PLOWSHARES? That's the situation in DEADLOCK, Accolade's game of planetary conquest. As an alien commander, you'll work to obtain Gallius IV for your people, either peaceably or forcefully. Your opponents will be one to six alien races with decidedly different strengths and methods, driven by artificial intelligences or networked human play ers. Although it may seem somewhat derivative, at first, the richly developed backgrounds of the alien races and the thoroughly VERDURA PER refined technology tree give this game a personality all its own. You'll start out with only 400 colonists, a city cen ter, a colonizer unit, and 500 monetary credits to your name. Settlers have a starter supply of resources to build a self-sufficient, expanding colony. Whether your planetary conquest plans are honorable or dastardly, you'll still need to build a heavy infrastructure. After settling in, you'll zoom in on your home territory, where you'll build your initial colony SimCity-style. Drop down farms, mines, factories, power plants, universities, cultural centers, and other buildings as you construct your colony. These structures won't build and run themselves, though. You'll need personnel for the construction and operation of each building, as well as the raw materials to build them. Personnel are the vital resource in this game. The more workers you drop on a building square, the faster it will be built, the more it will produce, and the faster it will be upgraded when new technologies become available. You'll start with simple structures such as apartments and farms, but eventually shipyards, missile bases, tech labs, defense cannons, and other high-tech structures come into play. which structures to build is only part of the game; where you build them is just as important. Mines work best in rocky regions, while the cracked earth squares are best for producing energy. Some squares have bonus markers, and will produce above normal quantities of a given resource. When you expand into multiple terri tories, you'll need to consider in which territory you want to build a particular structure. While you can transport resources between colonized areas, it costs money to do so, and takes time to move them. Occasionally, when exploring a new territory, you'll come GETTING TANKED The overview map shows distribution of laser tanks and other forces across the planetside. and iron. That's it.

All the money in the world won't help if you get caught with your pants down (assuming the race you're playing wears pants). BATTLE CRIES In the Alpha version of DEADLOCK, the actual battle sequences were the weakest elements, particularly when compared with the strong resource management and exploration elements. You can tell forces to concentrate on eliminating buildings or populace, or take a defensive strategy: you can also set a damage level where the unit will try to retreat. You get a report on how the battle played out at the beginning of the next turn, and you can optionally replay a video of the fight Basically, you end up with only a little more control over the bal. tle than in games like CIVILIZATION. The DEADLOCK team is consider ing other combat options that allow you to pinpoint specific buildings to attack, so you could, say, take out a threatening missile silo. The dilemma is balancing the desire to give the user some strate. gic control over the fighting while not making all the other players in a multiplayer game sit around and wait on the battle's resolution the weakest part of the alpha version of DEADLOCK that we examined was the artificial intelligence. Of icourseat this point in development, the Al was still even a bit confused about some of the rules. Thus, much of our play so far has been in network mode. We quizzed DEADLOCK's programming team about the Al that would drive the final game. It seems that the alien Als will function more or less like the govemment bureaucracies, only they'll be efficient. At the head of the organizational chart of each alien race's Al structure is the president. It's this randomly chosen character who will determine the overall tactics of a race in a particular oame-economic or militaristic. The president chooses Al ministers of technology, defense, war, government, commerce, and labor, each of whom is responsible for managing certain sectors of the colony's infrastructure. The labor minister, for instance, attempts to provide as many happy workers as possible. To accomplish this he requests the necessary resources to provide enough food, culture, and housing to create a happy and growing populace. Similarly, the defense minister does what's necessary to keep from losing territory, by requesting the resources needed to build defensive weaponry and the milli tary forces needed to protect each terntory. Each minister is assigned a priority by the president, so a wartike government is more likely to favor the technology defense, and war ministers' requests. All of this goes on behind the scenes, invisible to the player. Accolade is considering implementing an extra set of the Al ministers who could offer the player advice upon request, informing you of the tac tics they would choose if playing at the behest of an Al president These techniques should result in computer players who Aplay with rich involved strategies that involve building a comXplete infrastructure, instead of simpleton routines that concentrate only on the resources that are absolutely necessary to win the game. FRIENDS AND ALIENS Although DEADLOCK Should fare well as a single player game, it truly shines as a multiplayer experience. Up to seven human players can participate. The game's Taunt feature is enjoyable even in single player mode, but it's particularly enjoyable when friends and ene. mies are the targets of the computer's ruthless jibes.

The path you follow is indirectly affected by the remarks you make during cinematic encounters, but mostly by your in-flight perforImance during combat, covert and recon missions. Game flow is divided into 13 mission series of various length, each containing between 1 and 7 total assignments. Not all missions are essential for completion of the game. In fact, many are dead ends, accessible only if you've followed the wrong course of logic or failed to complete the objectives described in the preliminary briefings.

To view your current location in the game, press Alt-V at any time during spaceflight. For example, B5 indicates you are on the fifth mission of series B. The game features 48 missions.

The casino, on the other hand, was simple to enter. I tried my hand at a few games, first using my Universal Tool and a lucky rabbit's foot bought at the bar to improve my chances. I also talked to the bartender about the race Fortuna's ruler intended to participate in later in the day, and to the band, which told me it would help me out if I found them a new glifnod. Fortuitously, one of the ugly musical instruments was for sale at the security counter. I played it like a pro, and the band gave me SPAGE a tip in return.

Four puzzling lines, no directions. Or were they the directions? I recited them and found my machinery working normally once again. Two new locations were open to me. Before tangling with Avalon Greer, decided to investigate Cabal's glorious volcano. A strange tableau greeted me: floating bubbles, sturdy and huge, one with a bedroom set inside. returned to Forge to borrow the dwarf king's bubble wand and then used it to transport myself to the largest bubble. A young woman lay in the bed; when she rose she turned out to be Greer's daughter, and was eager to help me rescue her father from the evil spell he'd cast on himself. Her tips helped me capture Greer's floating spy, the \"crystal eye,\" and then her kiss turned it into a tool I could use to defeat him. When I confronted him in his tower, he surrendered. All that was left, after I sent Milo some warnings that would help him on Jungen, was to solve Cabal's World Key puzzle. This time it was a potion rather than a spell I had to cook up. First, I planted the flower from the bubble in the witch's garden, then I watered it and collected its seed and planted that. When it magically burgeoned, I entered it and used the cauldron I found inside to mix water, fire, wind, and earth, plus some powder I'd made from one of the crystals I'd pried from the wall. I drank, and was done with Cabal. But neither the worst nor the strangest was behind me. \"Last night I was so preoccupied in finishing Shivers that I was shocked to receive a phone call from my neighbor telling me that my lawn was on fire!!

Through the gates the beast had guarded, I found a maze of rooms con taining odd, incongruous objects: refrigerators and eyes on long stalks, a mailbox and upside down metal mountains, funhouse mirrors and a boy in knee pants. In each room I had to collect a wooden stair. In the mailbox room, I had a stair sent to me by rearranging the letters in a note received.

I did a little mechanical tinker. ing with the sphere's main entrance, and then used my powers of recall to foil the computerized security system. The ruler of Urbs greeted us with gunfire as soon as we were inside, but a bit of tampering with his mechanized biosuit (which I carried out while Milo kept him distracted) put him out of commission. We explored the city, turning up a seedy \"chop shop\" where people could buy bio-mechanical body modifications. I boned up on the surgical techniques until I knew enough to help the chief surgeon. In return for the help and our pointing him toward the biosuit we'd just liberated, he paid me $50,000 Next, we went to the city's largest estate, a high-security mansion outfitted with a room for the ruler of each of the worlds I'd been to.

I took the door key, along with some food for the road. The key opened the Verdry room, which held more of the world's concentrated lunacy than I could stand to look at. I smashed all the glass could find (including the funny glasses on the jack-in-the-box), and used the coin to get an eyeball out of the gumball machine in the corner. A mushroom appeared, and I used a surgical clamp to pull it out of the ground. Another key was revealed, along with a flute that looked like Arabou's. This key opened the Urbs room, where a spare biosuit waited to be aclivated. Once I fixed it with the panel I'd pulled out of Fortuna's TV set it helped me smash open the door to the Aurans room. Milo, who'd been captured when we reached the estate, was tied up inside and guarded by both a ketter beast and the nomad chief from Aurans. The flute got me through this tense standoff, and the food I'd grabbed from Avalon Greer's banquet got me past the beast. I collected Milo and the other half of the Fortuna lottery ticket, and we flew off for our final showdown. Before we could buy passage to the center of Dyce, we needed to cash in the winning lottery ticket; fortunately, a one-eyed robot was at the head of the winners' line and ceded his place to us in return for the eye I'd got ten in the Verdry room. We flew to the final hideout of the final villain, where I used my resonance tracer and Universal Tool to solve the World Key puzzle and throw Dyce into stasis.

Well, not exactly making hardware-independent game titles, since a DirectDraw-aware game \"I'M SORRY, DAVE...\" calls Direct Draw rather than going Let's digress for a moment, and talk straight to the metal.\" about the inner workings of DirectDraw. The problem here is that the HIAL must One of the key internal catures of be supplied by the graphics card vendor.

If you're running an okler es the graphics card, it must go through Windows 95 graphics driver, it may know the HIAL. The program calls the nothing about DirectDraw.

The choice is emulator \"fools\" the old DOS file system, based on up to you DirectDraw driver into thinking the increasingly creaky File Some of you may realize that that there's a Direct Draw HAL.

The version 1.0 Windows 95 drivers also exhibited relatively poor performance with the two test games. Loading up the r ev 2.2 drivers made a world of difference in both WARHAMMER and MECHWARRIOR 2 for Windows 95. In fact, MECHWARRIOR 2 ran better than the DOS version, which was gratifying The moral of the story is simple. If you're planning on running Windows 95 games, particularly games that use DirectDraw, then make sure you have the most current drivers for your graphics hardware, and be sure they are DirectDraw enabled. Without the right set of drivers, it almost won't matter if you have a 166-MHZ Pentium, you'll still have performance problems. However, once you install DirectDraw-aware drivers, you will be amazed at the difference in performance. If you have access to the World Wide Web and you should!), you'll usuall y find that the manufacturer of your graphics card has the latest versions of the driver for your card on its web site CG MAY 1996 "

"CAME DESIGN TECHNOLOGY Online Design Diary IF {Compromise Design} Now THEN > {Compromise Programming} Later = Limits {Unnecessary} by Alan Lenton yson's Comer, VA. Ina hotel room near AOL headquarters, I've just pried Nick, my chief programmer, off the laptop. He claims lie was \"testing\" FREECELL. bundled freebic on Windows 95. It's been a hectic month. The first part was devoted to getting every thing ready for a game milestone. When people give money for a product, they expect to see evicence of activity at regular intervals! We cleaned up the design document, wrote the storyboards and designed the front end. It was quite chaotic, but everything got there on time. In the process a number of design issues were resolved-including that of game time. We decided to allocate a set amount of game time for cach expedition The game will keep track of simultancous sub-expeditions, and figure out how much they overlapped. Players will need to orgacach quest. At present, I'm not precisely sure how we are going to implement this time fcature. I know some designers start to take account of programming limitations at this stage, but I disagree with that approach. Anything can be programmed, the question is whether it will run fast enough and fit into the target machine's memory limitation. When we actually program this bit of code, we will make any necessary compromises and I'll tell you the outcome. I know the way programmers' minds work. If I make compromises now, I will have to make more compromises at programming time! While I cleaned up the design, we continued work on the storyboards. I'm not going to tell you much about them, because that would give away the answers. However, 1 can tell you that everyone's favorite is the search for the mummificd remains of Cleopatra's Asp! One thing that became obvious was that we needed a proper combat system. We had intended to have just an abstract combat system, but eventually settled for a tum based system with a maximum time for giving orders. We would rather have a real-time combat system, but with network delays looming large we opted for a turn-based system. More next month!

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA level Construction 101 TECHNOLOGY \"lay of the land\" cannot change as the game is being played. Buildings can't topple, walls can't blow open and doors can't rotate or swing open. Essentially, the bird's eye view of a level can't change at all, since those boundaries are all precalculatcd. FROM SIMPLE SECTORS... I decided to try my hand at level design and began crafting the entrance to the student union of the college where I teach. The first step was to lay out the sectors for the steps. LOOKIN' LIKE A CAVE Initially, it isn't much to look at, more like a mossy cave than anything remotely collegiate WOLFENSTEIN 3D, id's carlier game, which was bankrolled by Apogee, doesn't have those restrictions, because it used a technique known as ray casting. 'This approach essentially traces imaginary rays of light to see what they bounce off of, such as walls and doors. This worked well in the rather simple geometry of WOLFENSTEIN's castles, but when the environment becomes complex, the time it takes to calculate the light rays increases logarithmically The Build Engine uses a technique similar to that used in calculating sector intersections wlien a DOOM BSP is built, but does it on the fly. By optimizing the code which calculates what can or can't be seen, and coupling that with highspeed assembly language routines which actually craw that data into the video buffers, the Build Engine can successfully juggle complexity and speed, without the \"Sectors can't change rule imposed by DOOM'S BSP reliance FUN WITH TEXTURES The first step was to begin applying textures. The vertical banding occurs because each stair sector also creates its own wall EXTRUDE AND EXPAND Each step has to be \"grown\" individually, by placing the mouse cursor on the top of the stair and tapping the PgUp key. ANY SECTOR IN A STORM The chief atom for the Build Engine is the sector. A sector is most casily defined as a closed polygon. A rectangle for a room is a quick and clirly example. Yet Once you dive into the Build Editor, you quickly discover that the sector-equalsroom metaphor breaks down almost immediately. A sector is more like a \"region of interest\" than a room, such as a pool of light on the floor, an ATM machine or a desk. A level in DUKE NUKEM is simply a large combination of sectors, each with unique properties, along with myriad placed items (such as guns, monsters and cye-candy). Sectors may either define the walls of a room, or they may define something else, like a lighting effect or solid object. If you consider the adult bookstore in the shareware version of the game, the magazine COLLEGIATE CORNER At last, after several hours of work, the entrance to the student union is finished. Notice the recessed lighting and the sloped face of the ATM machine, all done by manually manipulating the sectors. The carpet is created with two floor sectors with different textures applied to each. CG MAY 1996 "

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA 19010NH)31 shelves are sectors that look like objects, while the strange and severe shadows near the bathroom, arc lighting cffect sectors. Both types of sectors are exactly the same, they've just had different properties applicd to them in the editor. In a way, a level map is like a database of individuals. The sectors have unique positions in the level, and each side of a sector, as well as its floor and ceiling, point to a record of unique information, such as the shade of the wall, the texture map which is applied, the slope, the height, as well as any action tags, such as information that tells the engine that this sector is a door which will open under certain conditions, and so on. When the Build Engine revs up to begin a DUKE NUKEM gaming session, it initially combs through the level data to remove any \"invisible\" sprites and then places the sector data in memory. As you play the game, the graphics routines use the sector information, both the bound aries of the sectors and the attached information, to determine which sectors you can see and how to draw them. INTO THE EDITOR Creating levels using Silverman's Build Editor is at once a simple and a highly involved art. To simply create a \"generic\" room, you can just place the points for a rectangle in the 2-D, CAD-like portion of the program. A simple key tap brings you into the 3-D portion of the editor, which is just like the game itself, except that you may now effect changes on the environment you see. Initially, the room is lowceilinged and all surfaces are covered with the generic \"dirty bricks\" texture. A few keystrokes is all it takes to raise the ceiling, change the wall texture, add a parquet floor and dim the lighting to a more subdued tone. If you jump back into the 2-D editor and draw another rectangular sector within your room, it will turn red, showing that it isn't a \"walled\" sector, but an interior sector. Back into the 3-D mode, you won't see any changes, but you can modify that sector on its own. A few keystrokes, and you can recess the rectangle into the ceiling, apply a fluorescent light texture to it, and turn the brightness up to maximum. Another few keystrokes and you can illuminate the floor rectangle to create the illusion that light from above is shining on the floor. You can even raise the sector out of the floor and apply a desk texture to the top of Buildin' The Build he guy's just brilliant-he's a work from home and commute to Texas only programmer from Venus,\" when necessary.

When designing a level, you need to think alcad, since sectors are not the equivalent of rooms. Generally, a level starts out a one or just a few huge sectors, with everything else added on after that. To create stairs, for example, you must create a sector for each step and then \"extrude\" them out of the floor. When you apply a texture to a surface, a 64x64 bitmap texture tile is applied to the entire face of the surface. Often, your wall or floor won't mesh perfectly with the tiles, so the editor allows you to slide the tiles around on the surface, as well as to stretch or expand the image to get just the right fit. Once you have your room the way you want it, you can add details, like a potted plant or a pig cop, simply by returning to the 2-D view and placing a sprite.

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA TECHNOLOGY Bul DING CONCEMNED think like the Build Engine, not like a commonsensical human being, Beyond the visual, though, the Build Editor is the tool used to create all of the event linkages in your level. Sprites and walls all have an attribute called a \"lowtag\" which is a numerical value that allows an object, such as a sprite for a switch, to be associated with an action, such as opening a door or raising a platform. In addition, several special purpose\" sprites, which are culled out in the pregame read of the level, can be placed any where on the level. These sprites can allow the designer to create realistic actions such as triggering a horde of enemics to charge the player who steps through one of these invisible objects. EXPLODING MATCHES All of the thin orange sticks are compressed C-9 canisters, just waiting for the trigger to ignite into an impressive fireball els for DUKE NUKEM 3D. A level's design often evolved from one of the Apogee crew discovering some cool sector effect, such as the ability to create subway trains, for example. While it may take weeks to craft a particular level map, it takes even more time to work through that level and tweak it for gameplay (both single and multiplayer) and frame rate. \"Since the Build Editor is so easy to use,\" said Blum, \"you can instantly (create) something that's clog-slow.\" Using the editor, which can display the current frame rate, designers Allan Blum and Richard Gray can cull particular regions, simplifying and modifying to make sure that the game performs as promised. As mentioned above, creating stairs requires you to create and raise a sector for each step. When the Built Engine is calculating a view that contains steps, it must deal with cach and every sector of sprite to be anything you want. If you choose the pig cop, then the editor knows enough to create the code that tells the creature how to behave within the game. With a plant or trash can, the object just sits there, Iooking pretty Creating a level that looks right takes a great deal of time, and it forces you to MANY MONTHS OF DUKE Even with the Build Engine and the powerful editor in hand, Apogee has spent close to 20 months creating the levAthenalin ElectricMe EDUCTIES PIE 19 Tregan Way L.Hunte CA MAT b ollannalaumotoctava mo na http://www.playmatestoys.com Into the Vaidis a trademark of Small Engineering and Electric Moo Productions.

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA the steps each time it calculates a frame. Because of that, nothing bogs down frame rate like steps. Halfway through the project, the team was frustrated with this limitation and turned to Silverman for a solution. He modified the engine to allow it to handle slopes, so that a single sector could be used instead of many. While steps are crucial in some levels, slopes have been used in other places to keep the frame rate manageable. Many of the spectacular effects in DUKE 3D came about as the designers forced the Build Engine to its limits. In level two of the shareware version, when the building blows up, allowing you access to the yellow key, Blum discovered that if you placed a canister of C-9 explosive on the ground, and then shrink it to its thinnest proportions, it is visible in the cditor while invisible in the game. This allowed him the opportunity to prechorcograph\" a massive explosion by placing dozens of these emaciated canisters in front of the building, Blum and Gray have also logged many hours improving certain levels of the game to cnhance the multiplayer experinec. Gencrally, the smaller, more compact levels favor multiplay, while the sprawling levels are ideal for solo outings. \"We may give net players a great place to hide and snipe from,\"admitted Blum, \"but there's always a way to get there.

AM hates everyone, and has kept these \"lucky» folks alive to torture them endlessly, both physically and mentally. Not exactly a cheery situation. Now AM is playing a new game with them, and that's what this one is about. Each character goes through a custom scenario created by AM, designed to exploit that person's weakness. Naturally, the computer hopes they will foul up. Y our job is to see that they don't. You do this by making the right choices, and keeping an eye on the Spiritual Barometer (SB), which is the background color of the characters portrait. It starts as black, turning brigliter green as you perform the right actions. Perfect play will bring the SB up to white, although that isn't absolutely necessary to \"win\" the scenario. However, it is vital that the color be at least very bright green for each character to ensure success in the endgame. The order of play doesn't matter, eachi scenario is self-contained, so you can start with any of the five and continue in whatever sequence you like.

"SCORPIA ADVENTURE/RPG man in the operating room. This is a good time to honor his original request. Step into the anteroom for a moment (something you need is there), then make tracks for the oven room exit, because the pris. oners just broke out of confinement (gee, I wonder how that happened?). Either conversation line will get you through the gate and off to the bunker. What Nimdok needs to do here is get the golem operational. First though, check out the vat very carefully, for an important item, and be sure Nimdok looks at it. After examining both the blueprints and the golem, what comes next will be obvious. You do have to be careful about what you say here, though, being honest is important. On the way out, you'll run into Mengele. It's tempting to kill him (alter pumping him for all he has to say), but there's a better way of dealing with him. Outside, Nimdok finds the prisoners have caught up to him. He only has to do one more thing with the golem, and the scenario will end. that little icon from the chapel; while arriving on what looks like the surface of a nothing important hinges on this, it will brain.

He starts in a room with several monitors; choosing the castle is the right move. Once inside the castle, he soon comes across Ellen (his girlfriend, apparently; no relation to the other Ellen above), who isn't long for this world. She tells him about her magic mirror that protects her from her cvil stepmother. Too bad the mirror is missing: now we'll have to find it. As you check out the various rooms, be sure to read all the books you come across, and, as usual, pick up anything you can. In the kitchen is a maid who might be helpful; I don't advise accepting her offer of a cozy bed, though. Okay, so she wasn't much help; at least Ted is keeping himself pure for the moment.

"REVIEW  MISSION CRITICAL DIFFICULTY LEVEL INTERMEDIATE 9d/101NJAOV The Savior Syndrome Despite Clichés, Legend Scores A Critical Sci-Fi Hit by Martin Cirulis must admit to a dark secret: I have a problem with Adventure Games. Namely, I usually don't find them to be very adventurous. I grew up on the escapades of heroes, both real and literary, and, while they were all quick of mind and had to deal with the occasional maze, I don't remember any of them having to endure all the endless, inanc, and unrealistic puzzles-disguised-as-problems that infest every square inch of the average computer adventure game. So it was with more than a little trepidation that I booted up MISSION CRITICAL, the new SF title from Legend. Fortunately, MISSION CRITICAL is a pleasant surprise, the rare game that can serve as an example of how to do a good, straightforward SF adventure. ACCESS DENIED While this looks like a physical puzzle, it's actually a logic problem--and if you don't solve it, you'll never reach the computer in order to effect repairs. Price: $59.95 System Requirements: IBM compatible 486-33 or better, 4 MB RAM. VESA compatible SVGA graphics, 2x CD-ROM, mouse; supports SoundBlaster, General MIDI and compatibles. Protection: None (CD must be in drive) Designer: Mike Verdu Publisher: Legend Entertainment Company Chantilly, VA (800) 658-8891 Reader Service #: 323 MILITIA FANTASIES MISSION CRITICAL Sports an extremely well fleshed-out story and background, except for the clichéd premise so common to SF adventure games: the Evil UN is spoiling everything, and only clever Americans can lead the way back to freedom. In this case, all those crazy foreigners take over the world and proscribe cerlain technologies, specifically nano-bot Al lifeforms, as being harmful to mankind. Eventually, a group of countries rebel against this motherly yoke and break away to form The Alliance, which fights in the name of umchecked scientific advancement, cating cake for breakfast and running with scissors. Of course, knowing what hotheads those UN types are, a long war of secession immediately breaks out: and attrition being what it is, the Alliance finds itself slowly losing ground and in desperate need of an unbeatable tactical advantage such as the accidental discovcry of an Alien outpost on the distant hellplanet Persephone. This is where you come in. You are an Alliance Naval officer and basic Good Guy, and while it isn't stated overtly which country leads the Alliance your starship is the USS Lexington leaving little doubt which way your apple pie is buttered. Your starfaring Battlecruiser is escorting a science ship into orbit around Persephone, when suddenly a UN Battleship pops out from around the far sidle of the planet and rayages both Alliance vessels so badly that your captain (played in near-subsonic fashion by Star Trek: TNG's Michael Dorn) must surrender. Fortunately, all is not lost, and in a Kamikaze mancuver, your Captain knocks you out to fool the enemy scanners and transports the crew of both vessels to the victorious UN Battleship. But much to everybody's chagrin, he also brings along a thermonuclear warhead that goes boom at the moment of docking \"This renders you both friendless and chemy-less in a single white flash, and incidentally leaves you with the almost impossible task of continuing the mission alone...but I guess Wort figured that a slim chance is better than no chance at all, and preferred to die rather than let the UN take the prize. Contrived?

"BAD DAY ON THE MIDWAY. REVIEW ple are dropping like flics. Playing the game through won't take you long: an hour or two. But with Bad Day's many characters, choices and surprising helpings of pure randomness, it's never the same two hours twice. one good tale. Jim Ludtke and The Residents have given the genre a muchneeded spike of heroin-a dark glimpse into people's souls, exploring alienation and deformity and insanity and death, with a big dash of macabre humor. If this virtual drug trip isn't for you, fine. On the other hand, if you want to try something truly clifferent, BAD DAY may just be your ticket. ADVENTURE/RPG TILT-A-WORLD The characters are played by still-jointod puppets with actors' faces projected onto their heads, composited into Bad Day's tilted, 3D-rendered workel. The result is decidedly funky and not very real istic, but it fits well with the look and feel of the rest of this demented game. The introductory sequence flies you over the midway then swoops down and punches straight through the back of cute little Timmy's head, leaving you looking out through lis eyes. After that, any time another character stops to talk, you have the chance to \"jump\" to that character, trading one sct of cycs and inner voices for another. \"The characters interior monologues play out in broken fragments across the bottom of the screen. It's a mistake lo ignore them and go clicking your way framtically about the midway, looking for clues; most of your clues are right in front of you. Rather than the typical, linear game where we follow a single character down a long, narrow plot path find the key, enter the city, find the balloon, find the helium, fill the balloon, fly to Tumbolia BAD DAY offers a shorter, widler, more convoluted plot path which you experiCNCC over and over from different perspectives. No single pair of eyes sces everything, no one person knows the whole story. The point of the game is to play it through again and again, to explore the inner worlds of all the characters, to experience every possible ending, includiing all the death scenes. While there is as much multimedia as game hcre, BAD DAY nonetheless manages to tell several good stories, when most adventure games can't spin even APPEAL: This is for anyone who can't stomach another goody-goody adventure game with cute elves and overly polite princes. >PROS: As bizarre as the entire experience is, the characters are so intriguing-even the ones you don't like--that they entice you to play again and again.

"STONEKEEP STRATEGY Deep In The Keep 908718 NINOV A Traveler's Aid For Unlocking STONEKEEP'S Toughest Puzzles by Petra Schlunk 1129112201 1 801\" o you ever stare at walls, umsure if they are real or imaginary? Tired of mystic symbols and unfeeling orbs that leave you cold? Will the purple mists around your head never clear? If So, you aren't alone Interplay's STONEKEEP is filled with puzzles that can stump even experienced players. The following guide will take you to localing fountains, show you where keys are hidden, and what dangers to avoid. Be careful, however, lest you spoil the game for yourself by reading too far ahead of your current position. SWEETIE: WOULD YOU FIND MY DAISY CHAIN? PLEEEEEZE? WHAT A FAERY Give the Faeries what they want and they'll reward you with useful items and advice. FROM RUINS TO SEWERS First, find your way downstairs from the tower and head cast. Go up the stairs in the southeast comer to find the nearest healing fountain. Mark this location; Drake will return here many times to recuperate from his battles. After you defeat the Shargas in the central room, you get Afri's Orb. Placed on the ground in front of Drake, this orb reveals hidden rooms and nearby unexplored areas. Sewers, and you must fully explore both routes. The Sewers can only be drained, however, with two cylinders hidden under the brackish water. Step back, literally, and you will find a cylinder in cach of the two Sewer sections. Place these cylinders in the mounted drain cylinder switch control devices on the previous level, then press cach device. This crains the Scwers and opens the two walls there that l'arli commented on. In the center of the Sewers lives a huge, tentacled beast. Kill the beast, brave adventurer, and get the small marble staltie that it drops. In the area surrounding the beasts lair, listen for the sound of the whistling winds. When you hear them, go through the illusionary wall to your cast, so that you can exit the Sewers. You find that you have re-entered the Ruins, but are in an undiscovered area. Once you find the pedestal, place the statue on it to open a passageway to the Sharga Mines, THE SHARGA MINES AND THE TEMPLE OF THROGGI In one area of the mincs, Drake falls into a pit -it's inevitable, don't light it. Be prepared to back up quickly, though, or a giant will smash your character with a huge boulder. Elsewhere, you find this same giant sleeping by a chest. I le can't be killed, but you really must get to that chest how? Once again, retreat; then smash the barrels near the chest with a ranged attack-firebombs work well for this. Afterwards, the Giant will have fled the premises, so you are free to recover the Througish Key and Aquila's Orb from the chest. By using Aquila's Orb on the party, Drake can hcal everyone two times on cach level. The Throggish Key unlocks the western exit of the second level of the Mines, leading to the Temple Entrance. Beware! A section of the Entrance is full of arrow traps. Make sure you've explored everywhere else that you can by: 1) trying to walk through the walls somewhat clifficult;or, 2) wait until you have freed Parlithe dwarflet him detect the walls for you. Make sure to go down both stairwells from the first to the second level, or you may not find everything.

There are two ways into the inner temple. One is a secret passage that leads from a prison cell to the temple. The other is through the main entrance if you have fought Gorda Karn and recovered the Throg Pendant from him. Inside the inner temple is a statue of Throggi. Steal one of his eyes; this is Azrael's Orb. Used on Drake, it endows him with Quickness, and you must have Azrael's Orb to pass the gate of spears near the entrance to this level in any case.

THE FEEDING GROUNDS AND DWARVEN FORTRESS \"To reach the Feeding Grounds' second level, you must find one of two copper-colored Throggish Keys. There are two doors on level one with glowing green glyphis that damage Drake if he tries to pass them. Until Drake has been to l'eeding Grounds level two, he won't be able to pass these glyphs safely. Once you've reached level two of the Feeding Grounds, you find some red feathers. These allow your party to pass the glyphis on the doors upstairs. When you meet the chained dragon, you free her by finding two halves of a sturdy key. Also on this level, you encounter the infamous purple wisps. Even if they irritate you (as they do the Dwarf), keep in mind that these wisps are facries and therefore friendly! Where the Faeries disappear is the entrance to the Faerie Realm; keep this in mind for later. Meanwhile, you should check out another item on this level: a huge stone, made of magic flint, something you will definitely need later on. After you've explored the accessible areas of level two of the Feeding Grounds, return to the first level and go through the glyphed doors, one of which leads to the Dwarven Fortress. Here you meet a blacksmith whose forge must be re-lit before he can help you. Take the magic chisel he gives you, and return to Feeding Grounds level two. Use the magic chisel on the large stone to get a piece of flint. Return to the fortress, re-lighit the forge and get the key fixed. With the now-whole key, first unlock the chains binding the dragon's legs and then the ones around her neck. After she leaves, you can explore the corridors that her body had previously blocked.

You're going to have to go back to New York and get someone to help you on this caperdon't forget to bring refreshments for the trip. isn't easy following in the foot steps of a master especially a canny old genius like Master L. If you've run into some obstacles while guiding Robert Ripley through the twists and turns of this game, I've got just the clue for you. Pei-Ping, first visit: Having trouble getting rid of that pesky peasant? Tired of seeing the charming snapshot of Ripley's grave? The key to handling this guy is what he does for a living: collecting salvage metal. The only way to get him off your back is to arrange a distraction with a valuable piece of metal-say, by putting it where he can't immediately reach it. Pomerania: Finding the entrance to the Baron's secret laboratory is difficult, unless you're a real ace. It's in the billiards room, naturally--but where? There was a clue for you when you opened the drawer of the games cabinet something was missing Bet it's hanging around here Easter Island: It takes an odd combination of engineering, navigation and arts n crafts skills to get through this part of the adventure. Ripley will have to do quite a bit of extra leg work. Here're a few suggestions to move things along The first thing to do is get the Watching God back on his feet; it's going to take some leverage to accomplish this. The fulcrum (base) of your lever is lying on the beach. I'm sure you can put together the rest out of simple campsite materials. As for the Watching Cod's missing eye, it has been broken into two parts: the pupil's PUZZLED IN PERU There are three important locations in Peru, and you should thoroughly search all of them, including the one you're standing in the Posh Express office Mocha Moche: Here's your chance to get rid of that cursed Emerald; but I'm sure you've already figured out who you can palm it off on. The main challenge here is keeping Ripley alive while he hangs over the side of the tower, trying to recover a gleaming artifact from the skeleton niche. The key to solving this dilemma is a simple formula: two vines equal one rope, so long as Ripley docsn't have to trust his full weight to them. face, but the white of the eye has been taken from the island. Dr. Tivelvetrees'shed is awfully useful. Ripley should search the place at least once before exploring the quarry, and he may find something in there to get himself and Tivelvetrees out of a jam.

"HINTS & TIPS RIDDLE OF MASTER LU ADVENTURE/RPG Way presents an interesting series of problems. The monks here are cryptic, deliberale creatures: virtually every word spoken. both at the gate and at the Temple, has two meanings. Of course, you won't get through the gate at all unless you figure out how to pass as one of the brothers. The mark of the leruple is the ring that the gatekeeper wears on his forefinger: Look through your inventory; the Baron may have given you more than one key The challenge of the Temple is three fold. The gatekeeper has told Ripley that five of the Brothers have been given the wrong prayer wheels. Ripley must rearrange those live prayer wheels until rearrange those live prayer wheels until cach monk has the correct wheel. To be brief, the monks with the incorrect prayer wheels are in cells #4, #6, #9, #12 and #15. Keep in mind that a monk who knows a certain prayer does not need the prayer wheel for that virtue. It took me some time to realize that Ripley was also supposed to be looking for the Brother who had been studying in the Temple longest. Why? Well, because Ripley is seeking the Ilicden Wayand, as the gatekeeper said, \"Only he who studies longest knows the Hidden Wav!\" The problem of the prayer wheels is actually an elaborate logic problem, a test to see whether supplicants are intelligent enough to be allowed into the Temple. Here's the solution. USE the prayer wheel brochure to identify the wheels, and give each to the appropriate monk: Monk #4 Knows Prayer of Insight Ilas Wheel For Serenity Needs Wicel for Wisdom Monk #6 Knows Prayer of Wisdom Has Wicel for Peace Needs Wheel for Serenity Monk #9 Knows Praver of Truth Tas Wheel for Insight Needs Wheel for Peace Monk #12 Knows Prayer of Peace Ilas Wheel for Truth Needs Whicel for Insight Monk #15 Knows Prayer of Serenity Tas Wheel of Wisdom Needs Wheel for Truth his journal back, there's still the problem of recovering the solution to Master Lu's puzzle. Kuang ripped out the vital page of Ripley's notes, and there's no way of getting it back-or is there? Take another look at the journal, and consider that Ripley has to press awfully hard to make those bold, thick lines when he's sketching The Emperor's Tomb: The farmer has everything you need to break into the tomb; don't be afraid to ask him for equipment. Once you're in the solution to Master Lu's Riddle will become imminently clear. The last hurdle in the tomb is one of the most difficult;a lake of mercury bars Ripley from the entrance to the Emperor's mausoleum. Keep in mind, however, that mercury is much denser than water and thus has a higher surface tension), and a somewhat silly solution may present itself. I lope you didn't forget anything at the jace door >If these clues aren't enough to help you bag the Seal of the Emperor Shih Huang-di. all is not lost.

Since the maze is rectangular, consisting of square rooms connected by paths of light, the best way to get through it is to create an old-fashioned map on graph paper. The Hidden Way is 11 rooms in length (I would suggest making this a height measurement) and nine rooms in width. Counting from the top and left, Ripley enters the maze in the fifth room of the second column. There are artifacts to be collected in the maze: an incense burner in the bottom room of the eighth column, and a bone chisel in the ninth room of the first column. You can collect these if you wish, but Ripley doesn't need them to solve any puzzles. The exit to the maze is in the sixth room of the fifth column. If you have absolutely no luck mapping the maze yourself, you can try to follow this sequence of directions: it should take you to the exit.

The Ilidden Way is in cell #14, and consists of a maze bencath the temple (sce \"The Amazing Maze\"). When you reach the exit from the maze (it has a rather complicated ladder apparatus instead of four ropes hanging in the center) PULL the rope in the upper left corner to lower the ladder. Climb the lackler into the cupola, look at and sketch the copy of Master Lu's writings, then climb back down the ladder. Finally, at the Sikkimese Posh Express Office, send the bone chisel and the incense burner to Feng Li, and buy a ticket to Pei-Ping. Pei-Ping, second trip: 'This episode can be frustrating, since Ripley has so little control over the unfolding of events. There is no way to remove the gun from the brazier. The only way to protect Ripley from the exploding bullets is to shield him-or to use an object shaped like a shicll.

"PETER OLAFSON ACTION begins. At least, they're honest in saying: \"We're going to kill you!\" And so they are, unless you set about using that little dagger in your right hand. Consider: carly in the game, you'll run into a fellow named Harris, who'll set you on a mission. His voice is sly, his forchead is high and his eyes don't quite look in the same direction. You wouldn't buy a used personnel carrier from this man. And, sure chough, you may discover in the course of your mission that I larris is a rat. Take the key he offers when you retum from your sojourn, and you're setting yourself up for a deadly trap in the governor's office. Kill him, as he so richly deserves, and you're on your way to finding the hidden rebel headquarters. MY, WHAT BIG PIXELS YOU HAVE STRIFE's graphics still need some work, evinced by this wounded soldier's Lego-land look. CTIPS! DESCENT II has been out for over a month now, and it's 360-degree, 3-D action has been commanding the attention of action gamers everywhere. Here are some cheats to alleviate frustration and mortality. To use these cheats, simply type them in while playing. You don't need to type anything to initialize the cheats. But you can try typing gabbagabbahey, the old DESCENT Cheat-enabling code, for a little surprise. The cheats are not case sensitive and will work with the DESCENT II demo on the CG-ROM. Descent II Cheat Codes BITTERSWEET-Creates a warping effect on screen. ERICAANNE-All weapons bounce off walls and doors, though they still do damage to enemies. MOTHERLODE-Gives you all weapons and full ammunition. CURRYGOAT — Immediately gives you all keys. EATANGELOS-All weapons automatically home-in on targets. JOSHUAAKIRA-Automatically provides you with a complete map of the current level. WHAMMAZOOM-Warps you to any level. ALIFALAFEL-Immediately gives you all accessories. ZINGERMANS-Bestows invulnerability. You'll find money along the way (a nod to CYBERMACE here), and can use it to buy weapons and armor in shops, and treatment at the hospital. You'll find trainers who will improve your skills, whose lessons will ensure that you shoot straighter as the game progresses. And you have allies. You can't command them. but, in the fashion of the armed «Bobs» of MARATHON II, can use their presence lo good cffect. The concept of levels has changed as well. You know how it usually works: walk in one end, kill everything that gets in your way and walk out the other. Here, they're not so much levels as picces of an environment that flow into and out of one another, which you will cross and re-cross through many avenues. (In the demo, the town connects with the Orders sanctuary in three separate places.) Saving is also handled differently. In DOOM, you could save anywhere on the cusp of every crisis and that shortened the life of the game. Here, you can still try to save anywhere, but STRIFE records your progress only if you've reached certain benchmarks. Unlike the MARATHONS, which used this concept to finc.game-lengthening effect, STRIFE handles it invisibly. (After all, having a game-saving device on a wall is rather unrealistic, isn't it?) This should at least make players more cautious Dead isn't dead here, but dying invariably means you'll have to replay some portion of the game. It's a good idea; the action game in which death isn't a threat isn't much of a game. Not to say that everything was just hunky-gory in the teaser. Some wall tiles and certain item and character graphics were rather muddy and broadly-drawn. The designers didn't seem to have done much with spot lighting effects the whole place is lit up like a basketball court-or more gencral ones that might reflect the passage of time (a uscful tool in an RPG). The single saved position per character may not sit well with Doomers accustomed to saving at every dark corn er, and would seem to invite the player to paint himself into comers. Afterall, if you saved after a crucial mistake, you'll have to restart the game, since recovering from your saved point won't do you any good; you already saved after the fact, remember This can be a real problem if you've played for dozens of hours and are suddenly forced to restart the game. Playing from the beginning can be frustrating, but this approach definitely makes you think, and can lead to more intelligent gameplay But while I have trouble with some of the details, STRIFE looks like a solid game. It seems the DOOM engines are going to be with us for a while yet. The actionRPG is here. And the bloom is back on the rose. CG MAY 1996 "

"Video On My PC Some of the hottest computer systems today are those equipped with MPEG playback. MPEG technology compresses and decompresses digital video and audio to deliver full-motion, full-screen digital video playback with realistic clarity, color, resolution, and sound. Diamond offers a video playback board, the Stealth64 Video 2001 which enables these types of capabilities. Video adds a new association Using video to educate and train via computer allows people to learn through actually seeing the lesson, providing detail and intimacy that text alone cannot provide. In the realm of entertainment, the Internet and commercial online services are loaded with video clips of favorite actors, musicians and politicians. With MPEG, those video clips can be viewed at full-screen, full-motion. delivering remarkably clear playback of video clips, movies, and games, it can offer improved performance on older slower systems, and add the ability to listen to CD-quality MPEG audio. Diamond's MPEG Video Player 1100 Series daughtercard, at $129, offers the additional performance of hardware MPEG technology, with the Stealth64 Video 2001 Series multimedia accelerators. This Stealth product utilizes the Scenic/MX2 MPEG decoder from S3, a leading supplier of MPEG solutions.

Multimedia presentations incorporating 3D deliver more impact than 2D graphics. With 3D accelerators, graphics arts, action games, and 3D on the Internet are more realistic. For gamers, 3D signifies a new level of immersion and interactivity. The technology allows for crisper graphics at resolutions as high as 1024 X 768.

Secmis you've only escaped from the frying pan into the fire. THIS AIN'T THE BATMOBILE Comic book-style artwork frames the ROADWARRIOR action and helps advance the story. or years, your only dream was to get the hell out of Kemo City, the giant, brutal metropolis-tumed-prison maintained by the faceless Omnicorp. You were a cabbic, driving a hovercab, and in between your job and sleepless nights in the backseat, you'd man aged to run down more than your fair share of crazed psychos, gun-totting lunatics, and innocent\" pedestrians It made you a perfect recruit when a member of the guerilla underground came looking for a hitman to take down the Omnicorp. It was a crazy idea, but, hey, the Omnicorp started the craziness when they began pumping the city's water supply full of psychosis-inducing hydrogene, right? In no time at all, you'd smashed the administration center, killed all the scientists, blown up the hydrogene factory and the TV station, and with the right combination of guts, guns and secret passwords, finally escaped from Kemo City...only to find nothing beyond the city walls but sand, sand, and more sand. Blinded and WELCOME BACK ROAD WARRIOR is a new first-person shooter from Gametek, the sequel to last year's violently dally QUARANTINE. Think of it as Doom from a car. Once again, you are Drake Edgewater, mercenary cabbie, and you see the world from behind the wheel of your Checker hovercab. IF QUARANTINE was trying to evoke the look and feel of Escape from New York, then ROAD WARRIOR is trying to evoke the look and feel of...well, The Road Warrior. You're a lone, macho Judle, cruising through a post-apocalyptic desert in a WARRIOR hot car. Although your ride is a taxi, it's armed to the teeth. When the bad guys get in your way, you can lose them down with hot lead from your roof-mounted chain gun, or chuck exploding «Blackjack\" mines at them out the back end. It sometimes helps to crash into your victims once or twice to disorient them. That way they'll hold still longer, giving you time to aim and let loose a few missiles, or a few hundred rounds of armor-piercing ammo. ROAD WARRIOR's plot is advanced with a nicely done comic book which rolls between levels. After you finish off one level, you charge across the desert, dodging lanks, inissile-spewing dune buggies, falling rocks and tumbleweeds on your way to the next city, town, airport or rebel basc. Things are bad all over and it won't surprise you one bit to find that Omnicorp is behind most of it. Even in the verdant Mutton Valley, things are amiss.

In ROAD WARRIOR, performing missions for the underground is pretty much all you do. You'll track down and kill lawyers, blow up trains, run over joggers, shoot down crop dusters, put out fires with water balloons, and here mutant pigs back into their pens. Your missions usually operate under a time constraint. If you take too long to complete the objective, you fail and are doomed to repeat that mission again and again until you finally get it right. As you tick off missions, you'll progress through Omnicon-controlled cities, rebel bases, a twisted Disneyland knock-off (home of Stickey Mouse) and eventually, back to Kemo City R3902 00 10 KM AUTODROME ENEMIES LEFT 003 D.

Huh huh.\" WHAT'S NEW, MUTANT CAT In QUARANTINE, you chose and purchased your own weaponry out of your hard-earned fare money, and it was your responsibility to keep it full of ammo. By contrast, you begin each mission in ROAD WARRIOR fully repaired and automatically. cquipped with whatever weaponry is deemed necessary to complete the objeclive. One mission you've got missiles and ---Getting About torpedocs, and the next you've got nothing but retractable spikes on the front bumper or a gun that shoots water-filled condoms. In QUARANTINE, there was a grid of power broadcast posts and if you left the grid, your batteries began to run down. In ROAD WARRIOR, energy is not a consideration. You start every mission with your battery fully charged, and it never drains, no matter where you drive. In addition to the view through your four windows, ROAD WARRIOR allows you to see things from your enemy's point of view, as well as from above and behind your cab. The latter comes in especially handy when your view is blocked by the giant mutant pig impaled on your bumper spikes (don't ask.) The graphics are improved from QUARANTINE, offering a wide-aspect ratio SVGA mode, and the music is still a cut above average, featuring an eclectic mis of punk rock and hillbilly swing. But, despite being quite explicit in some ways, ROAD WARRIOR isn't big on realism. It doesn't feel very much like you're driving a vehicle (although. I can't say I know what driving a hovercabo feels like). The levels feel really big, but the environment isn't very interactive: glass docsin't shatter, exploding vehicles leave no debris, and so forth. You can blow through trees like so many puffs of smoke, but bounce off of a tent. Most fences will stop you as dead as a concrete wall, while you can run through others with nary a bump or scratch. For some unexplained reason, every pedestrian on the recciving end of your punishment looks like they're wearing a softball uniform, whether you're running them over in the alley ways of Flagg City or impaling them on your bumper spikes in the cornfields of Mutton County Camc'lek took many of my favorite clements looking for fares, managing money, deciding what weapons load to take-out of the game. Also, you can no longer change tracks on the CD. or plug in your own music CD and jam to Nine Inch Nails while rumming down giant mutant pigs. Still, if you liked QUARANTINE, you'll probably get a kick out of ROAD WARRIOR. Like its predecessor, ROAD WARRIOR is juvenile, low-brow and wacky, chock full of blood, severed limbs and toilet humor. But how can you not like a game that includes cow tipping? wak.) he secret to getting about quickly in ROAD WARRIOR is to regard roads as \"suggestions\" rather than imperatives. Roaring through the undergrowth doesn't slow you down anywhere near as badly as it did in QUARANTINE. If you don't run into a wall or fence or building, you can rock along off-road about as quickly as you can on the road...and there's a lot less traffic. With the power grid eliminated, you no longer have to worry about running your batteries down every time you take to the fields. This strategy isn't perfect; if you get too far off the beaten path, you can find yourself trapped in a box canyon, or between solid rows of buildings. Still, in general, you'll make better time and can complete the between-level runs through the desert with virtually no combat or damage. To prevent getting lost, try driving directly adjacent to the road: on the sidewalk, shoulder, or what have you. When you are driving on the road, resist the temptation to go too quickly. Otherwise, you'll waste a lot of time by missing turns and slamming into buildings. APPEAL: Anyone who likes QUARANTINE and BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD. PROS: This game will make you laugh with its juvenile humor, and it boasts really big, detailed levels. CONS: The humor is profane, and many of QUARANTINE's finer elements-those that made you think about weapons and money management-are gone. CG MAY 1996 "

"TERRY COLEMAN  CLASSICS & PUZZLES Chess Moves MAURICE ASHLEY Opens Up The Game Of Kings, While VIRTUAL CHESS Slams The Door Shut The top hess is an odd game. It has no luck, other than perhaps your opponent missing an obvious move. It isn't really a sport, but Bobby Fischer used to train for big matches at Grossinger's, the same gym Ali used to prepare for licavyweight bouts. Chess has been called the ultimate tactical game, yet it has strategies so subtle that a human can still beat a computer calculating billions of potential moves ahead. Chess is somewhat of an art form, a symphony, even a religion. What it has rarely been is entertaining. With the exception of the l'ischerSpassky and Kasparov-Karpov matches, most people couldn't name two worldclass chess masters if they ran into them on the street. from Mindscape, with its powerful stable of opponents and chess problems. BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHess gets brownie points for bringing a sense of fun to the party, but its chess engine is really pretty weak. Neither of these programs, good as they are, can really prepare you for MAURICE ASHLEY TEACHES CHESS. Maurice Ashley is not only the first African-American International chess master, he is also a fabulous coacl, whose two teams win top honors constantly in the National Junior High Team Chess Championship. Having lost in the state team finals twice, trust me: it's a tremendous achievement to get there, much less win the nationals year after year. Ashley inspires his charges to treat chess like any other sports competition, complete with slam dunks. The CD treats you to the master's style of coaching with video, audio and chess diagrams interspersed with animated illustrations of technique. These aren't just the typical \"Rook to C-7\" moves, either. Pawns become Ninja Assassins, while Rooks on open files are depicted as charging rhinos. To promote a Pawn to a Queen, you are instructed to move supporting pieces to cover the Sth rank, like a lineman in football blocking for a running backit's the first time I've ever heard touchdown\" when playing chess. From the basics of how to move pieces to the subtlcties of weak squares and the sharp tactics of sacrificing pieces for checkmate, MAURICE ASHLEY TEACHES CHESS has all the answers. The quick drill format even works as a refresher course for intermediate players, and the whole process is invariably enjoyable as well as informative. And while the chess engine will never challenge CHESSMASTER, the top level of ASHLEY is more than competitive enough for the average chess player. If you want to tum a friend on to chess, or level of ASHLEY is more than competitive enough for the average chess player. U CHESS MADE EASY Things might be changing, however. The best teaching tool for chess has always been the CHESSMASTER series push pieces yourself, this is the best program you can buy. MAURICE ASHLEY TEACHES CHESS, Davidson/Simon Schuster, 800-457-8357. CHECK! According to Mindscape, CHESSMASTER 5000 will be able to import and analyze data from BOOKUP (see above), making it a much more attractive product for serious chess-meisters. CHESS MENTOR from Aficianado, Inc. has a lot of chess talent behind it, including four International Masters and the designer of Kasparov's Gambit, Ralph Nagel. It tries to be so non-threatening, however, that it misses the point: any chess teaching program, no matter how good, can only benefit by letting you use what you've learned against the computer. Having a chess teaching program without an Al is like teaching moves in the low post without ever playing a basketball game. Chess may aspire to be art, but it's still about competition. CHESS MADE UNNECESSARILY DIFFICULT When VIRTUAL CHESS scored the best of any program at a recent event against human Grandmasters, I figured it would jump like a Knight to the top of the heap. Problem is, we don't have a new chess engine here -we got VIRTUACHESS Plus instead. I'm no Grandmaster, but I still get more of a challenge out of CHESSMASTER 4000 than VIRTUAL CHESS, especially on MAY 1996 CG CG "

"GEORGE JONES SPORTS SPODOTT Pondering The Intangibles usua usu Slvin TUEN Adding Realism To Computer Sports Games ne thing constantly bums me out about computer sports games: their lack of depth. I know that sounds a little weird-how much deeper can you get (or do you want to get) in a game that features a full season replay with player personnel decisions, et cetera? My problem is that very few sports titles have taken the genre much farther. The FRONT PACE SPORTS titles and TONY LA Russa 3 are the only games I can think of where the challenge has greater scope than merely trying to win the scason title. Maybe designers are afraid that if they inject a game with too much replavy value, sales will go the way of Major League Baseball Attendance. Or maybe it's just too much effort. But imagine an NCAA college basketball game where you have to recruit players, deal with their myriad off-the-court problems, and possibly, even face an NCM investigation. What would happen to your computerized pro basketball team if, in addition to calculating statistics and ratings, you had to deal with intangibles such as how salary negotiations or suspensions over failing to stand for the national anthem could affect a given player's performance.

But while playing around with NHL 96 and NBA LIVE 96 with some friends, I noticed that the action got more than a little confusing at times. Gameplay, in both cases, became quizzical contests of \"Who has the ball?... Who has the puck?...

The same is true of multiplayer NHL 96 and NBA Live. Therein lies the problem. Whenever I passed to another player, I expected my GrIP-enabled teammate to be given control of the new ball-handler. But that doesn't happen if you don't pass to your teammate specifically (the other guy on the floor with a colored star around his feet), you just keep passing to yourself. It's not the Gravis GHIP's fault. This is a game design flaw that is present in all EA Sports games. But it does indicate that before we plunge into the realm of multiplayer play, game clesigners are going to have to occasionally rethink gameplay. Maybe that's the real reason online sports games haven't happened yel. Next Month: George Jones passes the baton to Dennis McCauley, his first pick in the draft as new sports columnist.

"PREVIEW  NHL POWERPLAY '96 SPORTS Victory On Ice A New Challenger Makes A Run For Computer Hockey's Cup by Gordon Goble -CZE 08 CAN 005800 SNEAK YG PREVIEW tives out there GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT any have tried, but few have succeeded. In the end, it must be concluded that the hockey cuvironment is not easy to depict on the PC. Sure, EAS NUL HOCKEY line has towered over the market lo these many years, and rightfully so. Anyone Anyone who's joystick-handled their way through some of the truly frightful alternatives out there knows why: there just isn't anything else One near-exception was Accolade's 1995 release, BRETT HULL HOCKEY. While BREIT was no cup contender, and certainly couldn't touch the EA juggernaut, there were hints that the people putting this thing together knew a little about the sport. The design house responsible for that promising, but seemingly incomplete, project was Vancouver's Radical Entertainment, and now, like a stubborn bulldog, they're at it again. Distributed by Virgin, NHL POWERPLAY '96 is the name of this game, and if the final days of beta WARM UP FOR THE OLYMPICS In addition to the regular hockey season play, there is an international tourney to play, with teams from across the globe. testing and refinement can solve a few niggling little details, it will have winner written all over it. AMA 001803) NHLPA adical Bauer BENEL FROM THE LOOKS OF IT Graphic hounds be forewarned this won't be the pixelated 3-D masterpiece of NHL HOCKEY'96. There won't be a rink full of free-floating cameras, unearthly zoomable replays or atmospheric extras such as shattering plexiglass, reflecting icc, dislodged nets and feats of \"listic\" fury. Furthermore, gameplay will feature just a single panning 70-degree above-ice view of the proceedings with no other viewing options! But if it's accurate gameplay you're after, with an Al that you'll continue lo respect halfway through a long season, POWERPLAY may be your ticket to hockey bliss. Even in the beta version, POWERPLAY skaters seem to be thinking out there, making choices that are both intelligent, diverse, and rarely repetitiveunique in this genre. During a game, proper positional play is usually observed and only deviated from when opportunity arises. Yes, Islanders scoring machine Ziggy Palffy managed to zip through my defense and home in on my net, but the whole darn team didn't come with him. Instead, the other winger hung toward the left boards, and the defensemen, while certainly pinching, kept an appropriate distance back. This time, a deft kick save preserved a 2-1 game, and as my skater started up ice, he was hounded by a pair of forecheckers while the others slowly retreated. Perfect! D efenders might tie up puck carriers for several seconds, rendering them unable to pass or shoot--a lovely mimicry of the real thing. When they do get a chance to launch one, a slap shot takes longer to set up than a wrist shot, and a backhand carries less momentum than a forehand. Goals aren't dependent on \"hot spots,\" coming from anywhere within reason (I potted a couple from my own end of the ice, but Radical assures that won't be the case in the final version), and you simply don't get the feeling that events are KAYGIER HAT TRICK POWERPLAY's gameplay is second to none, complete with great Al, players that play and move like they do in reality, and even team coaching.

"PREVIEW NHL POWERPLAY '96 SPORTS Off the ice, there's some good and some not-so-good news. On the downside, player trades will not be permitted (although I hear they will be in future products). On a more positive note though, POWERPLAY does breathe new life into the oft-ignored realm of team coaching Offensively and defensively, your team's general style of play can be customized before and during each contest. Depending on your instructions, they'll \"Cump and chase\" or carry the puck in when attacking, and set up zone or manto-man coverage when defending Feeling a little surly? If so, the intimidalion mode works nicely, but beware of the penalties that come with forceful play. Protecting a lead late in the game? Then tell your crew to hang back.

With an estimated 700,000 units already sold, upstart Sony has broken the Nintendo/Sega head. lock on the console industry with their first entry into the gaming maelstrom. When the Playstation debuted in September 1995, it arrived with a deep line-up of first-party and third party software that showcased the power of this revolutionary gaming machine. Gamers took one look at the 3-D, 360 degree roving camera in games like BATTLE ARENA: TOSHINDEN and RIDGE Racer, and were amazed at the graphics power of the 32-bit console. Even more compelling was the long list of titles in development from established computer game companies like Origin, SSI, Interplay and LucasArts. When we discovered that Origin was porting WING COMMANDER II to the PC, or that Descent was being developed for the Playstation, we were pleasantly surprised. And when we saw that X-COM, CGW's Game of The Year, and PANZER GENERAL, were making their way into the PSX line-up, we knew it was time to take a closer look. What we found was no typical gaming con sole. With top notch graphics hardware and unprecendented support from PC ven dors, the Playstation can attract even the most hard core computer gamers.

"ACTION MayStation PlayStation PEN THE FLOOD GATES Playstation Fast Cars, Furious Fighters and Psychotic Russians PlayStation by Peter Olafson Playstation ction is what the Playstation is all about. It is its meat and potatoes, the largest beneficiary of the machine's power, and the source of much of its popularity. The best Playstation games are action: driving, fighting, flying, platform and shooting games. Load 'em up, and hang on. MayStation PlayStation PlayStation 3-D ACTION Doom started this genre, and if it weren't for that demon-splattering bloodfest, we'd never have the trio here. ALIEN TRILOGY (Acclaim), the only decent \"Alien\"-based game available, pays homage to the trilogy with a mission-based stroll through a giant derelict spaceship, a cocooned colony and a prison. The graphics are inconsistent and the game's not exactly scary, but it's fun enough that you won't notice. SPACE GRIFFON VF-9 (Atlus) is one of the earliest, and most underrated, Doom-style games for the Playstation. It has a pseudo RPG feel as you explore a moonbase with teammates, talking via comlink. Some graphics are sloppy, though, and the controls are elusive and some. times unnecessary. KILEAK: THE DNA IMPERATIVE (Sony) is a game with uninspired levels and stupid enemies, but it does have some nice architectural touches, basic but well-integrated puzzles and a rich, polished veneer. TWISTED METAL If you want undiluted mayhem and violence, drive on down to the arena for car-blasting fun. PlayStation PlayStation MayStation THE NEED FOR SPEED (EA) has come a long way from the 3D0 original, with better scenery, new tracks, a deepened view and a full-field racing game to supplement the grudge match. However, adopting the racing. game format sacrifices some of the game's individuality. The ribbon of road is too narrow, and crashes aren't as exciting in this version. DESTRUCTION DERBY (Psygnosis) is a must-have game, not simply for the frenetic action, but for its marvelous use of progressive damage. It's a great visual effect, and also a measure of the car's deteriorating handling and road-worthiness. There are also a half-dozen small tracks, where demolition rules still apply, but the idea is to get to the finish line first. The problem is that the game's just not...destructive enough. For more straight-forward destruction, steer toward TWISTED METAL (Sony). This is car wars plain and simple: arena combat against oppo. nents ranging from armed ice-cream trucks to 18-wheeler cabs to milltary vehicles. If you're not a flaming hulk when it's over, it's on to the next arena. Automotive violence isn't restricted to arenas. The Playstation transla. tion of Bullfrog's race-and-shoot hovercraft game, Hi-OCTANE (EA), takes it out on the tracks, with beguilingly easy controls that create a true hov. ering experience. ROAD RASH (EA) is identical to the 3DO version, but don't let that deter you. This motorcycle racing game was a classic in its first 32 bit rendi. tion due to its manic speed and violence, and both are preserved here. RACING GAMES There's no shortage of racing games on the Playstation. One of the first, RIDGE RACER (Namco), was mobbed in the arcades, and has been effectively translated. The resolu tion's been knocked down a bit but the play, the elaborate background graphics and the slippery handling are all in place. Too bad you're only racing on DESTRUCTION DERBY For flying into cars, smashexpanded versions of a single ing up doors, flipping hapless drivers end over end, there's no better game than this. track.

"ACTION Playstation WIDEOD PlayStation PlayStation IPEOUT (Sony) is smoothness personified. It's a totally immersive hovercraft racing game, but even immersive\" doesn't quite say enough. This one gets under your skin, even without a VR helmet. WiPEOUT never reminds you that it's running on a machine subject to constraints of CD access and loading times. It just envelops you. You pop it in strap it on and race in a sort of cockpit hush. The looping track speeds by as if seen from a car. The powerups start to seem like second nature. The jumps are just long enough to make you want to look down. And the track is just wide enough that you don't feel like a captive. But you are TOP POSITION 203 La recere OY22.5 Playstal PlayStation not quite as 1848 OU SESSM hands-on as TEKKEN-you use weapons to fight-and doesn't have the same sense of impact. On the other hand, I'm of two minds on CRITICOM (Vic BATTLE ARENA TOSHINDEN No game showcases Tokai). On the 3-D more than Toshinden, which lets you dodge surface, it's a left and right and displays action in all 360 degrees hybrid of the two great Playstation fighters, with the look of Tekken and the sophisticated moves of TOSHINDEN. But it isn't exactly fun. The characters are too man. nequin-like and you end up not caring for your fighter. ZERO DIVIDE (Time-Warner) also owes much to TEKKEN, but comes off busy and muddled--both in its complex polygonal figures and hard-to-execute special moves. Nor can I bring myself to get too excited over MORTAL KOMBAT 3 (Sony). The excessive blood no longer distinguishes it from other beatups, and is sometimes downright silly. What's left is an average, nicely animated fighter. Of course, sometimes silliness works great. I don't like PRIMAL RAGE (Time Warner) because it's a good lighting game. I like it because it's downright goofy. Imagine a bunch of Godzilla stand-ins, battling it out with snout gouges and tail whips amid torrential outpourings of blood as human worshippers look on. PlayStation 0136.0 0742.9 PlayStation Two games worth avoiding are ESPN EXTREME GAMES (Sony) and CYBERSPEED (Mindscape). The former is a violent race through gates on skateboard, rollerblades, land luge and mountain bike. The synthesis of all these elements doesn't really work, and the tracks are uninspired. CYBERSPEED was a lamentable race-on-a-wire Windows 95 game, and while the Playstation version has a bigger, more in-your-face feel, it's essentially the same bad game. PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation FIGHTING GAMES Fighting games on the Playstation are among the best the industry has to offer. STREET FIGHTER ALPHA (Capcom), an animated 2-D fighter, is a good example. It's fast and responsive, the enemies are varied and smart, and none of them just kissed the canvas; they always put up a good fight even as I moved in for the kill. I especially liked it because could win by playing conservatively without having to memorize special moves first (or rather, by picking them up as I played). BATTLE ARENA TOSHINDEN (Sony). is also a top-notch game, ranking a close second to TEKKEN among 3-D fighters. Here, more than the character is 3-D: you can dodge right and left and call upon magic STREET FIGHTER ALPHA Sure it's a 2-D fighter, The only reason 1 but it's got rich animated graphics and great give it second gameplay ranking is that it's Doom he venerable father of 3-D is an incontrovertible classic of this genre, and it is no less a classic on the Playstation. For sheer, lusty abandon, blood & guts, treachery and unalloyed terror, it knows few equals, Doom (Williams for the Playstation is a one-stop shop: you can toggle between ULTIMATE Doom and Doom II at the main menu. The speed is superb in the near-full-screen mode. The music is wonderfully brooding, and the deathmatch and cooperative multiplayer modes-the meat of Doom—are included, though you'll need a linking cable to use them. Though better than the Jaguar and 3D0 versions, Playstation Doom isn't a straight PC translation. The graphics have been knocked down a peg. Devotees of the original game will notice a reduction in colors, lighting effects, subtle simplifications in level architecture and the odd missing texture. But the feel is entirely intact, and the feel is what counts, PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation Anitation CG MAY 1996 "


"ACTION PlayStation you always feel at the heart of the action. PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation in Tekken EKKEN (Namco) is simply unrivaled among Playstation beat-em-ups. It's the game that feels most like what its all about: fighting. (Indeed, the only comparable games are VirtuA FIGHTER Remix and VIRTUA FIGHTER 2 on the Saturn.) When these big, richly DER AV drawn characters go down in a flurry of fists and feet. they really go down. You feel as though you've been beaten up yourself. No wonder the winner does a victory dance. It's in 3-D, and that makes all the difference. These '90s rockem sock-em characters seem to genuinely occupy space and carry weight. In fact, could you excuse me for a sec? I need a cold com press. I just got my ass kicked by the marine...again. PlayStation PLATFORM GAMES Interestingly, platform ers aren't big on the Playstation. But the ones that have been released are no worse than aver age...and I found at least THUNDERSTRIKE This helicopter flight one charmer in the game is full of gorgeous terrain and explodbunch. ing buildings. JOHNNY BAZOOKATONE (U.S. Gold) has some of the goofy feel of EARTHWORM JIM and some of the rendered look of DONKEY KONG COUNTRY. You're a musical warrior with a giant knob of red hair, gunning down all comers and grabbing musical staves. The graphics are good, the levels are challenging enough to keep your attention, but JOHNNY lacks a certain magic to pro. pel it beyond mere platformhood. The same goes for Gex (Crystal Dynamics). Without Dana Gould, this 3D0 conversion would be a solid platformer with a lizard. With him, it's a solid platformer with a lizard who makes annoying puns on every other stage. My favorite turned out to be RAYMAN (Ubi Soft), a sweet, almost Disneyesque platform-hopper designed for the young and young at heart. How could anyone not like this little guy, who closes his eyes happily when he jumps in the air and sticks his tongue out on cue? PlayStation Playstation Then there are the atrocious fighters. STREET FIGHTER: THE MOVIE (Capcom) uses stiff digitized characters for the fighters, and some of the fights are just ridiculous. Sharing the bottom of the barrel is Rise 2: RESURRECTION (Acclaim), which made me long for its poor ancestor, Rise OF THE ROBots. The sequel uses small, graphically muddy creations and dispenses with story entirely. PlayStation SHOOTERS Blasters of all description have been released for the Playstation, and they're a mixed lot. Some are electrifying, some are dire...and a few will PlayStation Playstation PlayStation FLYING GAMES AGILE WARRIOR (Virgin) is one of several good flying games for the Playstation. It's a pure arcade game--you collect floating powerups when you destroy certain buildings-but it brings ground detail to a whole new level. It's great fun to literally blow the roofs off radar buildings, and watch guard towers keel over. THUNDERSTRIKE 2 (U.S. Gold) is from the same general school-except with a helicopter. You're running from the frying pan to the fire in 26 substantial missions, and you're in AGILE WARRIOR territory from the start: great terrain, incredible explosions and tasks whose completion will fill your heart There's one more arcade flyer, and it's good. WARHAWK (Sony) is more of a fantasy campaign than a military sim. You're piloting the experimental War Hawk to stop the forces of a leader WARHAWK Forget realism. This game is known only as Kreel. absolute fun with spectacular graphics and The missions are mempulse-pounding action. orable the graphics are often spectacular and Air Combat he things I've seen in AIR COMBAT (Namco). I've followed oil pipelines to refineries and sent them up in smoke, I've come in over enemy cities at night--so low I could see the neon signs atop high rises-and blown installations right out the side of office buildings. I've hit their industry on land, and their Navy at sea, and left them smoking. After all, this is war. This is a system-seller. In this arcade flight sim, you're a mercenary running an air campaign against an aggressive enemy, and it doesn't just mean shuffling paper. You'll fly missions of all descrip tion in all manner of planes, and you can use the money you earn to buy more, hire wingmen of varying experience and assign them orders. The game looks fantastic. I've seen such beautiful textures and surface structures only in the most elaborate computer games, and even there Ive rarely seen smoke that looked more real. Even the planes-a whole raft of them, from B-52s and C-5 transports-look good, and you'll get to see them up close. My only complaint is the size of the game. Sixteen missions is about eight too few for my blood. Sequel, please, PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation Playstu MAY 1996 "


"ACTION PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation surprise you. ASSAULT RIGS (Psygnosis) is one of the more pleas ant surprises. This is essentially a fine-tuned version of CYBERSLED. You still have to blast opponents, but also grab the nec RAYMAN Here's the cutest platform game on the essary gems and Playstation, with levels of colorful fun. find the exit, while negotiating treacherous multilevel terrain. But the one player game lacks sufficient challenge. It's better on two machines than one. CYBERSLED itself, however, turns out to be Namco's only Playstation miss so far. This coin-op conversion is unadorned arena combat where two polygonal tanks square off against each other until one of them gives up the ghost in a gas-fired explosion. The arenas aren't especially large or complex, and the battles often turn into Old West quick draws. KRAZY IVAN (Psygnosis) is the closest thing to a MECHWARRIOR-style game for the Playstation. You're a paranoid schizophrenic Russian soldier in a 40-foot high Steel Cossack powersuit with orders to defend the earth from aliens. So off you go, rolling in smooth 3-D over sculpted gray green hills, blowing up everything in sight, collecting the tiny human hostages that appear afterward and destroying the generators that produce the alien's expanding energy shields. You're in for a good time here. For some action in space, JUPITER STRIKE (Acclaim) wouldn't be a bad choice. The graphics are hardly cutting edge, but I enjoyed its mix of shooting and targeting. Then there's VIEWPOINT (EA), an isometric blaster from the Neo Geo. It's one of the prettiest shooters, with lus: cious rendered scenery, but it's also infuriatingly difficult. Try PHILOSOMA (Sony) for something different. Its gimmick is a mercu PlayStation PlayStation rial view. Stand in one place for too long and it switches styles on you: horizontal shooter, 3-D, front-to-rear perspective 3-D, ZAXXON-style iso. metrics-you name it, it's in here. Despite the mess, it manages to achieve a certain consistency of tone. Unfortunately, it's too easy to beat CYBERIA (Interplay) also tries for multistyle play, but in a more creative way: It uses 11 distinct action sequences as punctuation in a strong graphic adventure. Like the PC version, you'll solve puzzles and explore places, but the action is solid, too, right from the first-level gun turrets. For a sideways-scroller, you can't do better than IN THE HUNT (THQ) -a sumptuous blaster in which virtually everything can be blown to bits. Torpedoes fired from your little submarine lay waste to everything in your horizontal path, while missiles wreak glorious havok on the elaborate structures above. The only problem is that the sub sometimes has only a small amount of room to maneuver. For more earthbound action, try OFF-WORLD INTERCEPTOR EXTREME (Crystal Dynamics). A monstertruck rally gone awry, it lacks TOTAL ECLIPSE's variASSAULT RIGS This 3-D tank shooter is fun alone, but ety--no tun: an absolute riot when played competetively between nels heretwo machines but because you have more control of your craft, you can experience the game more fully. Old games can be fun, too. RAIDEN PROJECT (Sony) is a charming blast from the past. A descendant of great vertical blasters like 1942, this rich top-down vertical shooter offers loads of large, aggressive sprites for you to detonate. Fast-flying shooting isn't all good, though. NovASTORM (Pysgnosis) and TOTAL ECLIPSE TURBO (Crystal Dynamics) are both disappointing. The first is like MICROCOSM without the blood vessels and is rather old hat, while the latter, for all its fast 3-D shooting in tunnels and skylanes, just comes off dated. SHOCKWAVE ASSAULT (EA), a bundle of two 3-D shooters, SHOCKWAVE and its add on OPERATION JUMPGATE, likewise suffers from old age. A good game on the 3D0 a few years ago, SHOCKWAVE's gameplay is too restrictive these days. And at the bottom of the barrel we have the \"to avoid\" list. LOADED (Interplay), a top-down maze shooter, is the bloodiest game on the Playstation. When you kill an enemy it makes a very wet \"SPLAT!\", and you'll see a red silhouette on the floor. I made many red silhouettes, laughed a bit, and then looked around for the game. Unhappily LOADED came up empty. The same goes for REVOLUTION X (Acclaim), the only gun game for the Playstation. We didn't waste any time on this game, and you shouldn't either. PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation UMPING FLASH (Sony) is a platformer with a difference: 3-D. Rather than bouncing around the landscape in a side-view. you re in the game, looking through the eyes of your character. Don't worry: This isn't another DOOM-style game. All the platform rules apply in this action/adventure-the head bounces that kill, bonus stages and power-ups. And because the play area is deep, as well as wide, there's so much more to see and try out It may take platform vets a little while to get into this new \"head.\" But I found it utterly captivating It's an experience you won't want to miss PlayStation PlayStation Toitation MAY 1996 "

Feature for feature, it can't compare to PGA TOUR 96 (Electronic Arts), which NFL GAMEDAY This football game evokes images of looks great, plays intuitiveJOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL, high praise indeed. ly, and, best of all, is challenging. It's definitely a keeper. We're also looking forward to VR SPORTS GOLF (Interplay), a game that promises more camera angles and faster play than anything currently available. The rest are odds and ends. The first-person tennis premise behind POWER SERVE 3D TENNIS (Ocean) is a fine one, but the game is frustrating. It doesn't even have a practice mode to learn how to hit the ball. WWF WRESTLEMANIA: THE ARCADE GAME (Acclaim) captures nicely the fla. vor of this silly, theatrical \"sport,\" and can be played for some good laughs. PlayStation ports on the Playstation? Stay tuned. There aren't a lot of games out, but a whole locker-room full of stuff is headed our way. However, a few of the games released to date are exquisite. Take, for example, NFL GAMEDAY. This smoothly animated football game reminds me of the games in EA's MADDEN line-with rational, Madden-like controls on screen-but with a greater sense of intimacy and closeness. It got me caring about football games again-some thing I haven't done in a long time. But it's April now, and you're probably looking for a baseball game. Unfortunately, as we went to press, there was only one, and it was bad. BASES LOADED '96 DOUBLEHEADER (Jaleco) has mediocre graphics, includ. ing a skewed pitcher-balter perspective, and suffers difficult batting and pitching that results in pathetically low.scoring games. You're in luck if you like basketball, though. IN THE ZONE (Konami) offers a more realistic turn on 3-D basketball games like SLAM NJAM. The large size of the players helps bring the game home, and their smooth movement and realistic execution of dunks and jumpers sells it. You should note, however, that it is strictly an action game, without sub. stitutions or even a full-season mode. NBA JAM TOURNAMENT EDITION (Acclaim) is something a little different: a hybrid of basketball and shoot-em-up in which power-ups hold court-like slamming the ball home from anywhere on the court and levitating above the backboard. COLLEGE SLAM (Acclaim), an amateurish NBA JAM, is worse. It has a ridiculous roster of power-ups, like reversing the direction of balls in flight, frying your rim with lightning to prevent your opponent from scor ing, and making a teammate invisible. It also has an ugly introduction and some bad graphics Soccer is well-represented on the Playstation, and FIFA 96: VIRTUAL STADIUM SOCCER (EA) unequivocally rules the roost. I've never played a game that so accurately and excitingly reflects what takes place on the field, or one that makes this hard-to-embrace sport so accessible, Nothing of consequence is missing, and virtually anything you're uncomfortable with in the default settings can be adjusted to your lik: ing. GOAL STORM (Konami) is another strong contender. It's not quite up to FIFA's realism or depth, but it has big, clearly-drawn polygonal char acters and, most importantly, it's fun to play. On the other hand, I never could quite get a handle on STRIKER 96 (Acclaim). It was all I could do to get my foot on the ball and understand the thick accent of the English announcer. The moment I liked best is when the players walked off the PlayStation PlayStation NHL FOCE Off PlayStation PlayStation in hockey, though, we have greatness. NHL FACE OFF (Sony) has the \"feel\" of professional ice hockey down to a science, has the game's running water fluidity. It has great game sounds. It has the checks (but not the fights), and the penalties. It has the gleam of the ice, but not the skate marks. It has the real NHL players, exhibition and full-season play (including the playoffs), and the ability to create, draft, trade and release players (but not argue over salaries). You can edit your lines or assign the computer to take over as goalie. You can also change the view to suit your taste. Most importantly, NHL FACE OFF has the moves. Complaints? Not a one.

But don't think for a moment that, because it's simple to play, it's easy to win. Germany may have rolled over Poland in 1939, but its defenders will go out fighting. DEFCON 5 (Data East) is a mixed bag of strategy, exploration and action that finds you defending an outpost.

We X-COM veterans must expose this UFO wannabe for the monthly supermarket checkout line fodder that it is. X-COM is hardly a fast-paced game on the PC, but I could have fixed a sandwich between CD load times here. A bigger problem was the gamepad, so unsuitable for this game that I had to GESC replace it with a Playstation mouse. Otherwise, the game mechanics are the same. The aliens can't see your hidden units, just as in the PC. But the more aliens the Al had to move, the less felicity it showed in patrolling, maximizing fields of fire and so forth-probably a memoiry limitation. To offset this, the aliens were \"tweaked\" to fire much more accurately than in the PC version, interception of UFOs is also tougher here, because the Al runs away faster, and your fire is curiously less accurate. Do these cheats hurt? Not that much, really, because the core of the game is intact in all its strategic and research-heavy glory Tactically the Al still pounces on weak human moves with those nasty Alien Grenades, and Mind Control is as effectively creepy as ever.

Multiplayer mode has seen the most dramatic improvement. Previously, it was more or less a guns-only free-for-all. Cum hits were so difficult that four players could fly around in circles for half an hour mirrors (superbly implemented) have been aclded. Happily, you'll no longer be surprised by SAMs or AAMs when flying in formation. Better external view options let you pinpoint enemy or friendly aircraft and watch dogfights in progress. Radar is better modeled, with target aspect angle affecting radar return. Keymaps have been adjusted to better support programmable controllers such as key, the view returns to the front. Similarly, a toggleable altemate view sct is available for joystick view hals, giving side views off the wings instead of angle views behind the tail. A partial panel view shows you the most important instruments while keeping more of the action visible. Aclitional controllers are supported, and the second view hat on sticks such as the CH F-16 Combat Stick now trims the aircraft (the function such hats serve on real aircraft). A config file lets you redefine any button or view hat function. Armament has been split into two banks. You can now fire cannons, machine guns, or both. Bullet lethality is toned down, so kills are a bit harder to get The flight model has been tweaked, with more realistic roll rates and the addition of prop drag. In rcalistic flight modes, you'll now have to catch the wires at the rear of the aircraft carrier to land successfully. Finally, when you die, you'll now get to see your plane explode or splash into the ocean, rather than being unceremoniously clumped back to the results screen.

"TERRY COLEMAN BRIEFINGS a lot topic again, largely because Talonsoft's BATTLEGROUND: GETTYSBURG is selling quite briskly. But while I enjoy pitting Lee vs. Grant as much as anyonc, I can't help but feel sorry for Napoleon. It's been years since Le Petit General had a hit. There hasn't been a good Napoleonic wargame since SSI did BXTILES OF NAPOLEON, which sold less than 10,000 copies, according to the publisher. The last big-budget altempt to place Bonaparte on the computer was the illfated FIELDS OF GLORY by Spectrum HoloByte. Despite the game's luscious graphics, it didn't exactly break sales records, proof that gamers are much more savvy than marketing folks give them credit for. Association strives to position itself as an oasis of ethics in a turbulent industry, as evidenced by their strong stand against software piracy. But those lofty aspirations don't help the average gamer to understand where SPA is coming from when it hands out the annual \"Codies\" awards (check out the SPA winners in our Read. Me section). In a year with WARCRAFT II, STEEL PANTHERS, BATTLEGROUND: GETTYSBURG, HEROES OF MIGHT & Magic, and COMMAND & CONQUER, among other strong candidates, the Best Strategy Game Award from SPA went to the pretty, but agonizingly incomplete design of ASCENDANCY. Maybe the judges should actually play some of the games in the category before voting next year? Maxis has a lot of interesting projects in the works. SIMCITY 2000 is going online, with real-time action that lets you play cooperatively or competitively. SIMPARK lets you design a national park, place it anywhere in North America, and fill it with the animals you want. No word yet on how this game reconciles the Contract With America and the Birch Society. PAX IMPERIA II has been delayed until late Summer, possibly as late as September. For those of you who've never had the pleasure of playing the original Pax (only on the Mac), Pax II looks every bit as grand in scope as the venerable MASTER OF ORION, but differently-flavored, with the option of playing either real-time or turn-based. Incredible Simulations next \"last stand\" game, ZULUWAR!, will probably be their biggest hit yet. Jeff Lapkoff has secured the services of Dennis Bishop, who brings both a knowledge of history and a background of clean, enjoyable wargame designs (Dennis' board wargame Like Lions They Fought, published in Command magazine, is an enjoyable romp through Zululand). STRATEGYI WARGAMES See Marge. SHINY NEW NAPPY So it comes as somewhat of a surprise that a few companies are actually bringing new campaigns of Napoleon to market-albeit with a little caution. The most prominent of these is Talonsoft's BXTILEGROUND: WATERLOO, and the obvious question is whether the game system can make the transition from the American Civil War to Europe in 1815, while retaining enough historical flavor and play balance Bob McNamara of Talonsoft thinks so. Boardgamers will recognize Bob as \"Mr. Advanced Squad Leader\" from his design years at Avalon I lill, and it was Bob's input that resulted in many of the positive changes to the BATILEGROUND system between ARDENNES and GETTYSBURC. From what I've seen so far, Bob and the other folks at Talonsoft have good reason to be excited about their new war child. WATERLOO'S most obvious difference from GETTYSBURG is the range of the smoothbore muskel, much shorter than the rifled musket more common in the Civil War. This has immediate effects on tactics, which are accentuated by the formation options available. In addition to forming in line or column, units may also be unformed.\" An unformed group of units won't suffer the negative effects of disruption, but they neither move as effectively as a column nor fight as well as units in line.

Assign one peon to build the structure, and then assign other peons to go to the construction site and begin \"repairing\" it.

You don't have the time to be as deliberate as Monty was historically, so just build better units. Matilda Ils are the best way to keep the desert sands out of your shoes; buy at least two, preferably three, and expect to take a few losses along the way.-Terry Coleman STRATEGY / WARGAMES Allied General-Can't seem to get major Hill, whose Waterloo board game is being converted—1960s rules intact-to a '90s PC palate (see last month's 19th Century Warfare» feature for details). While you're waiting for AH or Talonsoft to meet their Waterloo, you might check out NAPOLEON THE EMPEROR, a Windows turn-based game by Reality Engine Computer Games. It looks a lot like BATILES OF NAPOLEON, but is even simpler to play. Essentially, you choose a formation, give it an order, do the same with your other units, and execute your grand strategy by ending the turn. Since the Al h as a limited amount of things to keep up with, it isn't bad. All in all, the game is a lot like Swfte's GETTYSBURG game, without the arcade-ish artillery of that game. The shareware version of NAPOLEON THE EMPEROR is available on CGW's ZiffNct forum, or you can order the registered version by calling 800-2424-PsL or 713-5246394, or by IAX to 713-524-6398 or by CompuServe e-mail to 71355,470. If this \"Napoleonic maneuver\" becomes a trend in this industry, I'll be among the first to cheer. l'or now, though, I'll be satisfied if the games just get released with no cute robots, arcade curia ssers, or bad voice-over acting in Pidgin trench. Until next time, Happy Hougomont. & might become unformed would be infantry trying to move through a village while remaining in line-it simply isn't going to happen. Thus, the «informed» rule is a good way of simulating the practical realities of a given situation-making us grognards happy-while keeping the game's mechanics relatively simple. Similar methods are used to model cavalry charges, a must in any Napoleonic game. In the movement phase, cavalry first declares charges. Then the infantry in its path desperately tries to form into square formation; its success or failure is based on the unit's troop quality, already a cornerstone of the BATTLECROUND SYStem. Then there is the customary defensive fire phase, any enemy cavalry counter-charge attempts, and then the charge is resolved during the melec phase. The design team is also considering letting a cavalry unit charge a target more than one tum's ride away, provided it makes all troop quality and morale checks. Skirmishers likewise depend on troop quality in order to attempt with drawal before melee. WATERLOO has a number of cosmictic changes to keep the marketing folks happy as well. The sprites are 50 percent larger than in GETTYSBURC, and the Battlevicw cutaway hexagon view has never looked better. More importantly, though, the scenarios have a great deal of variety and \"what-if\" scenarios. What if Grouchy had shown to help Napoleon? What if Blucher's Prussians had arrived later, carlier, or not at all? How would Wellington's reverse-slope defense have fared if the French had attacked over a cry field in the morning, instead of a morass of mud in the afternoon?

The beta preview copy ran slow as cybersnails, even on a PCI-equipped Pentium 90 system with 16 MB of RAM and a quad-speed CD-ROM drive (excessive overhead for what is essentially a strategy game). At the time of this writing, minimum hardware requirements were not yet available, but judging by the game's pre-release performance, it's safe to say that anyone at the low end of the system scale-486/DX2 66 MI Iz with 8 MB of RAM-will face constant frustration. The product's multiplayer options modem, network and Internet connections-could not be tested, but seem almost certain to cause further performance clegradation, cven on high-end gaming systems.

"REVIEW  SPACE BUCKS STRATEGYZWARGAMES ponents slide slowly up a six-tiered techinology scale whose development is outside the player's control. Since this is basically a transportation game, engine improvements that increase a ship's speed and range should be coveted; the more worlds a ship can serve in one fiscal quarter, the more profits it can rcap. Amidst the trade routes, there are the usual assortment of random mishaps to plague you. Also, if the player chooses, the spaceways can be enlivened by espionage attacks, which range from making a rivals world break its charter, to inducing pirates to attack competitors. The traditional pals of the 'Tycoon gamer, the dreaded bank and the lovable stock market, also make an appearance in SB, though in pretty basic forms. With all this, you'd think that all SB needed was a little style to put the components together to create a game the equal of Air Bucks. Well... USELESS GADGETS The ship customization is cool but not very useful: you don't really need weapons or shields because pirates hardly ever attack And this brings us to the whole moneymaking process of SB: moving cargoes from supply worlds to consumer worlds by creating trade routes for your ships to follow. A few clicks of the mouse produces a loop for a ship to travel; a few more give precise commands for what to pick up and deliver at each world. Of course, what would a transport cmpire stretching across the stars be without the starships to do the work? In SPACE BUCKS, players get to choose ready-made ships or design their own based on six hulls of varying cargo capacity and three other components: Engines, Shields and Weapons. All ships require an engine, but shields and weapons are optional and useful only in the (rare) event of a pirate attack. While all hull sizes are available from the outset, the three additional comfleet, a computer player can lose every ship and still somehow gain money! Even worse, though, is the game design itself. It seems to me that a game about building a Calactic shipping cmpire should be more interesting than terrestrial commerce, not less-SPACE BUCKS is so basic that each planet is less interesting than the smallest towns in RAILROAD Tycoon. Even the sense of direct competition with your computerized companies is mostly lost by the fact that only one company may operate from a planet at a time. With no real contact between the companies, there is no need to worry about such important business concepts as advertising, service quality or even ticket prices. And what about taking advantage of the galactic venue? Instead of predictable random events like meteor swarms or earthquakes, why didn't the designers think about the subject matter and plague our companies with outbreaks of war or strange alien viruses? I'm afraid SB has very little to do with its fine Airline predecessor, and far more to do with the same mediocrity that created the lamentable POWERHOUSE. If you love to create ornate moving sculptures that generate endless money but do very little else interesting, then SPACE BUCKS will have some appeal for you. Set at its hardest level, the game offers two or three hours of challenge before your empire grows to the point that nothing can really harm it and you simply sit around absorbing planets from your competitors and doing more and more unwieldy upgrades to your entire fleet. Other than that, it is pretty to look at, but definitely no Air BUCKS in Space about Go Dutere Yew Bratton \"WHERE'S THE CONGEALEDPROTEIN-SUBSTITUTE?\" What bothers me the most about SPACE BUCKS is the fact that it will probably get a number of glowing reviews based on how good it looks and feels for the first couple of hours: the SVGA graphics are sharp and imaginative; the alien races are interesting; the random map and large numbers of worlds seem to offer extensive replayability; the ship building system appears to have all the traits you'd find in a fancy spaceploitation strategy game; and most importantly, Space BUCKS is a child of the very successful Air BUCKS. Despite all this, if you play further into the game, you find it devoid of the quality you'd expect from a sci-fi Tycoon game. The alien races have very little impact on the game and I would hazard that it makes no difference at all which one you choose to play. The ship designs are interesting but, except for cargo-size and engine speed, the variations are irrelevant (even the computer rarely arms or shields its ships). SPACE BUCKS also displays either a gameplay \"bug\" or the worst Al cheating I have seen in recent years. It is so blatant, that in a game where your profits are supposedly proportional to your APPEAL: Gamers looking for a great-looking first few hours will have fun, but not those desiring extended gameplay. PROS: Good-looking introductory Tycoon game. CONS: Uninspired design, simplistic modeling, dubious Al \"advantages\" and very short-term challenge make this game an \"also ran\" in the space race. WHAT COMPETITION? The most interaction you ever have with your rivals is bidding for (and losing) landing rights at different worlds. su ran\" RATED CG MAY 1996 "

"HALL OF FAME Welcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. HIGHLIGHTS WAR IN RUSSIA Strategic Simulations, Inc., 1984 WASTELAND Interplay Productions, Inc., 1986 WASTELAND SLO rior to WAR IN RUSSIA, gamers who wanted to play strategic level games that covered the entire Eastern Front were restricted to massive boardgame designs which covered two or three cafeteria-sized tables at a game convention. Computer games were by and large limited to smaller actions where tactics were all-important and a strategic perspective either non-existent or so abstracted that strategic-level gamers felt the computer for mat was unsuited to the depiction of large actions. With WAR IN Russia, the first \"monster\" game on the computer, Gary Grigsby was able to present the ater-wide action on a wide-scale and give individual gamers the thrill of being the theater commander for the first time. Experienced gamers came to discover that the Al could be faked out easily in an early move of subterfuge, but the game continued to have popularity because of its scale, subject matter and suitability for playing by mail (i.e. the save positions were in the right spot for players to be able to save their move, send a disk and wait for the return of the disk for their next move) or e-mail (sending saved game files at a rapid 300 baud per second). It was popular among wargamers for as long as the Apple Il remained alive, and it provided some of the initial research for Grigsby's later SECOND FRONT and WAR IN RUSSIA on the IBM, though neither had the same game mechanics. t is difficult to speak of computer role. playing games without invoking the ven. erable title, WASTELAND. This post-holo. caust adventure was set in the Mojave Desert regions of California, Nevada and Arizona where the players were \"rangers,\" the last remnant of law and order, trying to solve a mystery involving both massive atomic mutations and an incursion of aliens circa 1950 \"B\" drive-in movies. The game proved the value of a skill-based role playing system and created interesting algorithms for handling the nonplayer characters. One couldn't simply strip the NPCs of their items as in other games; the NPCs had \"minds\" of their own. Further, although the game was combat-intensive and used a computerized form of Michael Stackpole's combat-rich MERCENARIES, SPIES AND PRIVATE EYES game system (still available in boxed form from Flying Buffalo, Inc.), it was replete with ethical dilemmas and non-combat puzzle solving of the most devious sort. The story was written by Mike Stackpole, and many of the maps were fleshed out by veteran game designers like Liz Danforth and Ken St. Andre. Now, years later, WASTELAND is still held with great esteem by CGW's readers and was most recently available on Interplay's 10th Anniversary CD-ROM.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what bot What's The [ME Deal With... mal Science Fiction? even in the hyperbaric chamber of the straight-to-video market. While the fail ures and the thinking behind them are dreadfully apparent, (witness Byron Preiss's MARTIAN CHRONICLES and ROBOT an somebody please explain to me why, in an industry where at least half the titles on the shelves at any given moment involve some kind of SF or Speculative bent, and a sizable percentage of con sumers would probably consider themselves \"fans\" of SF, the games themselves so very rarely do a good job with what should be an infinity of possibilities? I have a few ideas to explain this state of affairs, but most of them involve dark Cabals and Entropic conspiracies, and my shrink told me not to talk about this stuff in public. Seriously though, it's unfortunate for us that gaming is relatively newborn, compared to SF (which I believe is working its way through late adoles cence) and is more vulnerable to \"it doesn't matter\" syndrome. All the problems of a fledgling art form are exacerbated when you believe that the mechanics of a game are the only issue that matters, and that premise or even a story is something to be hung loosely about the graphics at the end of the production run. While it's certainly true that for action or most strat egy games, the gameplay accounts for 80 percent of the success of the prod uct, I think it's a mistake to ignore the fact that a clever and well-thought out premise can be the added magic that will take a good game over the top into the realm of \"Great.\" For me, part of the appeal of DOOM was its heroic, twisted premise, which harkened back to the great Humanist SF stories of the '50s and early '60swhen there was no humanity-crushing force, be it alien or magical, that couldn't be defeated by a smart monkey with a big enough gun. It was gen. uinely satisfying to take on those demons; they may have been torturing helpless sinners for the first half of eternity, but they looked a little less cocky staring down the steel depths of a double-barreled Remington in the hands of an angry primate. Strat titles like Sim-Tex's MASTER OF ORION and the upcoming sequel MOO 2: BATTLE OF ANTARES have also benefited greatly by having a convincing premise, whose implications were woven into the game itself. Certainly this can partially explain their success versus the uninspired fare from impressions (like SPACE Bucks or WHEN Two WORLDS WAR). Of course, nowhere is the battle between good writing and knee-jerk cliché mining more obvious than in the realm of the venerable Adventure game, the sub-genre where you can find every Hollywood investor with extra pocket change lurking nowa. days-all looking to bankroll story ideas so weak that they couldn't thrive ( A few recent titles are giving me something akin to hope that computer games may someday complement SF. recent titles are giving me something akin to hope that computer games may someday complement SF, instead of just propagating its worst qualities. While THE DIG actually had the wit to think an adventure game might benefit from dialogue written by a real writer, (the stalwart Orson Scott Card), the surprising Mission CRITICAL went even further in improving the sub-genre by making the game serve the \"reality\" of the story. I didn't have to play Reversi or fetch a part from a guy in another village once while repairing my rippled Battlecruiser. It was wonderful. To be honest, though, my optimism has been given its greatest lift by such recent titles as I HAVE NO MOUTH AND MUST SCREAM and PSYCHIC DETECTIVE, where the writers were allowed to disturb and provoke the player, instead of just shock and puzzle them. If adventure games are going to evolve into a valid form of mature entertainment on a par with movies (as is the hope of all the suits investing in game companies), then it's time to leave behind the '50s Drive-in \"Good Enough\" thinking, and start treating SF like a genre that has been read and written by some of humanity's brightest lights for over 150 years.
