"JOHNNY WILSON A Game for All Seasons How 4th Quarter Syndrome Is Endangering Future Computer Games for retail in the fourth quarter will actually hit the shelves, and that dis tributors and retailers will once again be able to demand exacting tribute from the publishers in the form of cooperative advertising and marketing development funds. This ake a 250ml beaker and pour in a 12 ounce can of Coca-Cola. Now, pour in the same amount of Pepsi-Cola and RC Cola. What do you have? More than one-half liter of mixed cola drinks all over your lab table. Not a very pretty picture and not a very positive result. Yet, this alleged science experiment isn't far from what is happen. ing in the computer game industry. Too much of a product mix in an inadequate container is going to cause spillage. For years within the computer game industry, we've heard the laments about how difficult shelf space is to obtain. Yet, software publishers currently seem to be playing chicken with each other in that very limited retail space. Most have latched onto the market research which indicates that more dollars are spent on computer games in the fourth quarter than in any other, and have decided to hold more products than ever for the holiday season. On the face of it, that's like saying that it's best to go fishing when the fish are biting. The problem is...there are only so many fish. This strategy for putting the bulk of the product line out al during the Christmas season means that there will be more titles vying for the same amount of shelf space. This means that not all of the titles slated ( How many worthy products get buried under the holiday retail avalanche? 27 a seller's market in which exhibitor clout wanes.

You have summed up the main reason I don't play on the Internet. The creators of the games had the right idea in bringing all the fans of their games together on the Internet, but it only takes one \"Psycho Ceek\" to ruin the whole thing. The biggest problem with them is that they might end up giving someone who really wants to enjoy the game such a bad experience that they won't ever try again. I wish! had a solution for the problem, but I don't. The solution I created for myself is not practical for everyone. I am in the process of setting up a small server for myself and some of my close friends to enjoy multi-player games with each other. That way at least I know who is on the other end, and I don't have to put up with a problem that will surely just get bigger as online memberships continue to grow, Chris Moore via the Internet This month we review two new 3D-gaming cards, which you'll find in our Hardware section. We're planning to do another major round-up of 3D cards in an upcoming issue. You may also note that every round-up now has a CG Choice. This means that this is a card with a price-to-performance ratio which we can recommend. Of course, some gamers may have different criteria than we do, so we try to print as much information as possible about all the hardware we test. This enables you to have the best of both worlds: data to make your own choice and our recommendations. Believe it or not, we've had hardware manufacturers tell us that a halfstar difference in rating hardware means a significant dcclinc in sales. We just call 'em like we test 'em HARD CHOICES I have been a faithful reader of your magazine for several years now. Each Issue is more enjoyable than the last. I get a kick out of the letters you publish that people send in about things that are really insignificant that happen to show up in your magazine. The use of a word that is heard everywhere, but when printed it now becomes taboo. The advertisements that offend readers, yet prime-time TV shows more blood, sex, and even advertises contraceptives. TV has a much larger viewing base and much higher editing standards than a magazine. So, don't you pay any mind to those who have trouble turning a page rather than staring at it till their blood boils. If it were TV, they would just turn the channel. So, let them turn the page instead. I think you're doing just fine. Well, all except for one thing that does bother me. Why is it when you review hardware you can't come right out and choose the one you think is best? Surely your opinion would be helpful due to the fact you have the time to try cach product, whereas we the readers can't buy one of each and return the ones we don't like. I have been wanting to buy a 3D-gaming card for sometime now and have been waiting to see more reviews but haven't seen any yet. Surely with the recent release of many new NOT-SO HOT ROD SYNDROME I've just finished reading \"The Hot Rod Syndrome,\" Johnny Wilson's May editorial. In it, he argues that gamers are caught in an endless and expensive race to stay on the cutting edge of technology. I find this argument both compelling and well-reasoned. However, as a long-time gamer, I have personally followed a different strategy I have opted to stay on the lagging edge. For the last five or six years, I have routinely upgraded the \"bottleneck» component in my system to the best replacement available at a commodity price (read \"cheap\"). I believe this approach offers several bencfits. First, I can save some serious money. Rather than spending $2,500 every two or three years for the latest Byte Whacker 3000, I spend about $400 a year on whatever buys the biggest performance payoff. Second, I find relatively few bugs or conflicts in \"seasoned\" hardware and software. When I do find a problem, the patches or workarounds are readily available. Third, I am able to use the horror stories of the early-adopters» as well as CGW's ongoing coverage to weed out the real lemons. And finally, I am always within shouting distance of \"current\" technology. There are very few games I cannot play at a reasonable level of performance.

But if we did, even hall-of-fame games such as WING COMMANDER would be little more than museum pieces. Obviously, the staff at Origin doesn't subscribe to such a revisionist view, because the latest in the series, WING COMMANDER: PROPHECY, resembles nothing so much as the first Wing COMMANDER. Don't panic; this doesn't mean that Origin has returned to The mysterious alien Manta. MCGA graphics or a predictable enemy pilot Al.

ABIT IT5H MOTHERBOARD I tinker with motherboards the way some people adjust valve timings on their British sports cars. Motherboards are all much the same, but now and then, a new twist on an old theme arrives, in this case, the Intel 430HX chipset-based ABIT ITSH. The really unique thing about this board is the complete absence of jumpers. If you've ever wondered how parameters like CPU speed and bus clock are set, it's incredibly simple-you set all your CPU timings in the BIOS. In fact, you can set all kinds of interesting timings, including boosting the bus clock to 75 MHz (the 2.0 rev will take 83 MHz timings), suitable for Cyrix P200+ processors. It even comes with a PS/2 mouse connector. In other ways, it's a pretty typical AT board: 4 ISA slots, 4 PCI slots (one pair shared) and the usual collection of serial and parallel ports. Performance is pretty good, generating a CPUMark 16 of 431 and CPUMark32 of 424 with a P55C MMX Pentium (all bus timings at 66 MHz). The manual is probably the best I've seen, although it's still not for the technically-challenged.

From talking to them, however, it's obvious that, as much as they respect Chris Roberts, they felt the later games in the series crossed a little on the uncomfortable side of that fine line between game and movie. Kilrathi and Confederation were pretty evenly. matched, the exotic technology of the aliens means that you must come up with new tac. tics-a big plus for what has always been one of the most innovative space combat games. It's a given that WING COMMANDER: PROPHECY will be one of the major gaming events of the year. And while details are largely classified now, our agents are already on the case, because loyal Confederation citizens (and CGW readers) have a need to know. So stay tuned for further developments. Terry Coleman As for the plot? We promised that we wouldn't give away any big secrets here, but some of the rumors you've heard are true. Even though the emphasis on video has been cut back, many of your favorite characters are scheduled to return, with some contract negotiations still going on as of press time. In any case, the biggest change from earlier WING COMMANDERS is that you no longer play Blair, but a young, cocky space pilot right out of training. The Kilrathi do return, after a fashion, but there won't be any big kitties serving aboard a Confederation carrier: According to team members, after what happened with Hobbes, another Kilrathi defector just wouldn't have any credibility.\" The sons of Kilrah aren't exactly the Big Bad Guys this time either.

"READ.ME off the Arcade Sega Brings Strong Arcade Lineup to the PC hatever you think of Sega and its less than-stellar console sys tem, Saturn (believe me, the thoughts aren't pretty around here), you cannot deny its incredible arcade prowess. Sega dominates the arcades with top-rated games in the fighting, racing, and shooting genres. Sensing that the gaming landscape now makes single-system loyalty untenable, Sega has chosen to port many of its arcade titles to the PC. So far, we've only seen the older generation, such as VIRTUA FIGHTER 1 and VIRTUA Cop 1. This year, we're still not getting the latest from Sega, such as rac ing game SUPER GT or VIRTUA FIGHTER 3, but we are being brought more up to speed. Here are some of the titles being port ed to the PC: VIRTUA FIGHTER 2: This was Sega's premier fighting game, until the stunning VF 3 last sea son, and it will hit PCs in August. The game features two new fighters, more moves, and better graphics, along with Akira LAN, modem, and Internet play. from the VIRTUAL ON: This is a robot VIRTUA fighting game with unrestricted FIGHTER series movement in full 3D arenas. You can choose from eight robots. and duke it out against friends in split-screen, modem, LAN, or Internet play. In the arcades, the game used a dual joystick for control, which Sega will soon bring to the PC. This MMX-only game should be available, direct from Sega, by the time you read this article. VIRTUA SQUAD 2: Known as Cop 2 in the arcades, gameplay is a little better, this time with different tracks to choose from, more enemies, and better graphics. Sega will support PC light guns for this September release. DAYTONA DELUXE: DAYTONA USA on the PC was a disaster, with terrible graphics, no multiplayer capa. bilities, and a ton of console KURA conventions still left in the code. This time, Sega will try a more sincere port, with improved graphics and multiplayer support, as well as additional new tracks and cars. DELUXE will ship in September. MANX TT: Based on England's Isle of Mann Race. VIRTUA FIGHTER 2 MANX TT, Sega's motorcycle racing game, should hit desktops in July. In the arcades, you actually ride on a motorcycle prop and lean left and right to maneuver. On the PC, you won't have that immersive control, but Sega is hoping to convert as much of the fun as possible. Like every other Sega title this year, there will be multiplayer support. You'll have eight bikes to choose from, but only three tracks to race. LAST BRONX: Another fighting game, this one is set in the rough-andtumble inner cities where police and thugs duke it out with billy-clubs and fists. It should arrive by year's end. TOURING CAR: This is another racing game, with even less forgiving and more realistic handling and physics than DAYTONA. It's also due out by the end of December. ---Elliott Chin reputation, and manage a staff with bizarre hobbies.

"READ.ME READ.ME Commanding Conquest Eidos Is Hopeful About Its Real-time Contender Concept art of one of the aliens in CONQUEST EARTH. It seems that after TOMB RAIDER, everything Eidos is peddling is supposed to be a sure-fire hit. That's a lot of hyperbole, but their real-time title, CONQUEST EARTH, has some interesting features that could at least elevate it above the rabble Like many other games in this genre, CONQUEST EARTH features aliens as the villains. You can play either the humans or the inhabitants of Mars. The two sides will not only have different units and buildings, they'll also have completely different interfaces. The humans will have a very hi-tech interface, while the aliens' interface will be organic. When their monitors open, you'll see membranes pull apart to reveal a screen; when the monitor shuts off, the membranes will close like eyelids. CONQUEST EARTH will also feature some technical advancements, such as being able to show FMV within gameplay windows. When a barracks is destroyed, a live-feed will pipe through one of your monitors, and you'll watch full-motion video of the barracks being destroyed. You could even have multiple FMV sequences playing in several monitors on the side of the interface while the action is still raging on the game screen. Whereas other games are trying to downplay CONQUEST EARTH the action aspect of real-time games, CONQUEST EARTH is embracing it. You'll actually be able to seize control of individual units and control them, as in action shooters. This action will still take place from the top-down perspective, but it allows the twitchy gamers to take an even more active role in the combat. CONQUEST EARTH is slated for release this summer. A mission editor will come with the game, and Eidos promises many grotesque cut-scenes to, er, flesh out the alien invasion storyline. -Elliott Chin Other Eidos Titles to Look for in the Coming Months: For those of you having Lara withdrawal symptoms, do not fear: The lovely lassie will return at the end of the year in TOMB RAIDER 2. Miss Croft will be showing off her latest weapons and exercising some new abilities as she battles it out with more bad guys. If that seems a long time away, check out the TOMB RAIDER: UNFINISHED BUSINESS expansion pack, available now.

Banished to a lonely island, you must persuade the other exiles to join in your efforts to vanquish the wicked Warlord. Available early 1998. DEATHTRAP DUNGEON, Eidos' 3D action/combat game (based upon lan Livingstone's fighting fan. tasy game book series), offers ten levels of hack'n slash conflict, set within the confines of a dark and ghostly dungeon. The game has multiplayer capabilities (up to four players via network or Internet) and should be available in October. Eidos' FORMULA ONE racing game, based on the 1995 season using the official Fuji license, features 13 teams, 17 circuits and a new networking system that allows up Death Trap Dungeon to 26 people to player against each other.

"READ.ME PIPELINE THE HEAT Is ON Who's That Girl? VIGILANCE's Nikki could give Lara Croft a run for her money. SegaSoft Prepares to Join the Online Gaming Ranks ith scores of companies jump ing aboard the online gaming bandwagon, the necessity for original and eye-catching content is greater than ever. SegaSoft is the latest contender to strut its stuff in cyber space with its new Internet gaming network, HEAT.net. HEAT will offer a free area where players can access most of the games and chat rooms, and a premium area with exclusive games, tournaments, and special events, which will be available for a minimal fee (SegaSoft anticipates the ser vice will cost LOSE YOUR MARBLES between $40-50 per year). HEAT will also be supported by advertising, and the company plans to make viewing an ad worth your while. cking on an ad buys you frequent player points, which can be exchanged for goodies at online stores, or used to buy power-ups in games. HEAT uses Mpath's low latency technology and also supports IPX-technology allowing gamers to play third-party games like QUAKE Over HEAT. SegaSoft is developing a selection of exclusive titles for HEAT, the most interesting of which could be NETFIGHTER, the first fighting game created specifically for Internet play. SegaSoft hopes that the animated action sequence as each character moves will help con: quer the latency issue. What we've seen so farwell-rendered characters each with their own dis tinct fighting style-is impressive, but only hands-on gameplay will tell if the latency problem has truly been resolved. We'll keep you posted. Other games include Scud, a fast action, multiplayer shooting game filled with a host of power-ups and special weapons; ALIEN RACE, an action/strategy game which allows three teams of ten people to compete against each other in an attempt to protect their own alien territory, and HEATWARZ, an eightplayer search-and-destroy strategy game. SegaSoft will also release VIGILANCE, an action/adventure game with a Mission Impossible type story, in which you play one of eight members of an anti-terrorist group. Using the photo realistic AnyWorld Dynamic 3D engine, the game boasts stunning lighting and real-time transparency effects. It will support LAN and Internet (over HEAT) play. SegaSoft's fast-paced 3D adventure game, Skies, is set in persistent universes where each mythical character will visibly age as they gain experience.

Prepare your imagination for the real world. cow PAINT Y Cartoon: Eric. W. Schwartz NEW. Sclewat he death of the Amiga is often lamented by hundreds of thousands of former users (and a number of CGW editors) who fond ly remember the machine smoothly doing things in 512K of RAM back in 1985 that are still clunky on a 32MB Pentium Pro today. Well, to paraphrase Twain, the reports of the Amiga's demise may be exaggerated. Although Escom, the German company who purchased the rights to the Amiga, followed Commodore into bankruptcy, the machine has been rescued again, this time by Gateway 2000. The compa: ny was slated to announce the machine's future at a press conference at the World of Amiga show in London in mid-May. And Amiga pundits may yet get their wishthe Amiga could still become the world's most popular computer. A Chinese company has purchased the rights to build an updated version of the Amiga CD32+ console (68030 processor, CD-ROM drive, and a modem) for the Chinese market. Although targeted mainly to play CD movies (which sell for $1 each in China due to the lack of copyright protection), if you plug in a PC-compatible keyboard, you have a full-blown computer at a fifth of the price that an IBM-compatible sells for in that country. With China's huge population, the Amiga platform may yet gain the success it missed the first time around. -Denny Atkin QuakeCon\" WHERE DO YOU WANT TOQUAKE TODAY? ie-hard QUAKE fans, pack your bags and prepare to hit Dallas: The second annual QUAKE Convention will take place July 16 through July 23 (as of press time, a specific location had not been confirmed).

"READ.ME MAKE ONE MISTAKE AND YOU'RE Activision Reveals Gear and Weapon Specifics for HEAVY GEAR HISTORY BEAR TRAJECTORIES PLANET EXPLORER The Grizzly is the backbone of the Northern Guard's gears. It has sophisticated armament and 70mm armor. THE BETRAYAL A dangerously authentic world where the characters, places and n an exclusive to Computer Gaming World, Activision has revealed two of the gears (giant robotic fighting machines), and two of the heavy weapons to be featured in their upcoming HEAVY GEAR combat simulation. As expected, the Northern Guard will be represented by the Grizzly model gear. The Grizzly is equipped with 70mm armor, as well as the following weapons: M225 Heavy Autocannon, GH-8 Rocket Pods, GU-10 Gatling Gun, M25 Pack Gun, TD-76 Mortar Unit, and the HWVB-1 Vibroknife. It has a running speed of up to 40 kph and a rolling speed of up to 65 kph. The Southern MILICIA will feature the versatile medium-class gear known as the Mamba. The Mamba is equipped with 56mm armor, as well as a PR-55 Autocannon, Vogel-8 Rocket Pod, two GL-01 Grenade Launchers, VU-11 Vibromachete, and HG-C4 Hand Grenade. It runs at up to 55.4 kph, and glides at a top rolling speed of 84 kph. It is also rumored that the Southern MILICIA will rely more upon the King Cobra gears than the basic Spitting Cobra gears as their heavy units. Both sides will have a variety of weapon modules with which to equip their gears. As of press time, CGW had secured images for two basic weapons: the Light Particle Accelerator and the Rapid Fire Bazooka. As in the original sourcebook, the Light Particle Accelerator will have an effective range of 400 meters, and can penetrate up to 100mm of armor. It's a good thing that it takes a heavy unit like the grizzly to han. dle one of these weapons, since the weapon is not only capable of penetrating the heaviest gear's armor, but doing electrical damage to said armor once it pen. etrates. We haven't seen an image for a Heavy Particle Accelerator yet, but this heavy weapon is expected to be used only with Strider vehicles-huge support artillery. The HEAVY GEAR design team has not confirmed this, however. Technically known as the Paxton RFL-2 Soothsayer, the Rapid Fire Bazooka may be the most versatile weapon in the arsenal. It has the same 400-meter range as the Light Particle Accelerator, but a higher level of penetration (200mm of armor). Think of it as a burst firing rocket launcher that can be used by any size gear. These are the first definitive specifications and images received on the gears and weapons them. selves, though we saw Hunters, Grizzlies, and Mambas when we played the prototype for our recent cover story (April, 1997).

"PREVIEWS ZORK GRAND INQUISITOR Target Release Date: October, 1997 Developer: Activision Publisher: Activision A Whole Grue World The Great Underground Empire Rises Again in a Brand New ZORK Trilogy by Jeff Green n May 25, 1977, Star Wars was released to the world, and a universe was born. Eight days later, so the legend goes, a group of MIT programmers, including Dave Lebling, Marc Blank, and Tim Anderson, created a universe of their own. The result was DUNGEON, a text-based fantasy adventure game that ran on mainframe computers. This game eventually evolved into one of the first text adventures-and one of the best games, period-ever to appear on a personal computer: ZORK. As with Star Wars, the first ZORK game was only the beginning. For the next 20 years, over the course of ten games, the story expanded, encompassing roughly 750 years in the history of the Great Underground Empire, a land inhab ited by evil sorcerers, dimwitted kings, man-eat ing grues, and youthe quick-thinking adventurer. Along the way, the ZORK series set a standard for humorous, yet brain busting, gameplay that few other adventure games have even come close to matching. HONEY, I SHRUNK THE GAMER The Grand Inquisitor's totemizer, where those who practice magic are cut down to size. THE NEW ZORK Now, exactly 20 years after DUNGEON was con c eived, Activision is embarking on the most ambitious ZORK project to date. ZORK GRAND INQUISITOR, due this October, is the first in a trilogy of games that will fill in another huge chunk in the Zork timeline, and will take gamers back to visit some of the series' most legendary char. acters and locations ZORK GRAND LAS INQUISITOR begins INQUISITOR begins in the year 1067 The Great Underground Empire has fallen on hard times ever since the end of the Age of Magic in 966 (as recounted in BEYOND ZORK and SPELLBREAKER). Since then, the evil Mir Yannick has seized control of the Empire through his mastery of technology and, to ensure his domination, has dubbed himself the \"Grand Inquisitor\" and forev. er banished the practice of magic. As the game opens, you, the anonymous adventurer, have arrived in Port Foozle, where you discover a lantern containing the trapped, disembodied spirit of the Dungeon Master, who, in the game's opening cut-scene, had been obliterated by Yannick. You grab the lantern, descend into the Great Underground Empire via a secret entrance, and embark on an epic adventure to save your friend, restore magic to the world, and defeat the Grand Inquisitor once and for all. To accomplish your tasks, you'll need to travel back in time to recover three legendary treasures: the Coconut of Quendor (from BEYOND ZORK), a Cube of Foundation (from SPELLBREAKER), and the skull of Yoruk (a character in ZORK NEMESIS). Along the way, you'll visit some of the most famous spots in the ZORK universe, such as G.U.E. Tech and TWICE THE FUN An artist's rendition of the two-headed beast guarding the Gate of Hades. You'll need to figure out a way to get past this bad boy. CGW JULY 1997 "


"PREVIEWS the legendary white house, and meet with some of its most famous characters, including everyone's favorite sorcerer, Belboz. ZORKIER THAN THE REST Since transforming from text into graphic adventures in 1993, the ZORK series has been a mixed bag. The first effort, RETURN TO ZORK, was a bit cheesy, and suffered from an incom. prehensible interface. The second, last vear's ZORK NEMESIS, was a very popular game, but was a departure for the series in many ways. Activision Mystified the ZORK universe with undeniably beautiful graphics and a dark, por: tentous storyline, but came up short on the humor that had always been a hallmark of the series. Of all the games in the series, NEMESIS was the least Zorky ZORK. With ZORK GRAND INQUISITOR, Activision is wholeheartedly embracing the Zork legacy while retaining the sophisticated look of NEMESIS. ZGI employs the same \"Z-Vision\" engine created for Nemesis, which allows 360 degree panoramic scrolling within each scene, but the graphics themselves have taken on a lighter, less austere tone to match the game's more comic approach. Activision is also promising more interactivity with the environment (rather than just one or two hotspots per pretty picture), as well as a more populated world-consisting of both liveaction and computer-generated charactersto help give the game the kind of vibrancy that made the old text adventures so great. Other refinements include a new inventory system, which will let you store, examine, and combine objects, as well as a dynamic map, which fills in as you explore the world and allows you to quickly move between places you've previously visited. CASE OF The biggest (and most welcome) change, ADVENTURE BREAK GLASS! however, is the incorpo ration of a spellbook given to you at the beginning of the game by the enchantress Y'Gael (from BEYOND ZORK).

Mondain, the great Foozle in ULTIMA lore (prior to the Guardian), had his soul corrupted by powerful magic, causing him to twist the Gem of Immortality to his evil will. When the hero (this is before Check out our in-depth Avatarhood, folks) finally interviews with Lord overcame Mondain, the British and ULTIMA ONLINE immediate evil was Producer Starr Long at ended. But the Gem of www.computergaming.com. Immortality was shattered into thousands of pieces, each con: taining a mirror-image of Sosaria. This back story allows for multiple worlds which is a good thing, because it's doubtful that if 20,000 people want to play ULTIMA ONLINE on the same weekend, they're all going to fit in a single game world. When you want to switch from one ULTIMA ONLINE world to another, you can't take your worldly possessions, such as a building that you own, with you. This has engendered consternation in some ULTIMA fans. I'm all for having control of your gaming envi ronment, but if you move from Boston to Milwaukee, you can't take your house with you, so what's the problem? In any case, you should be able to keep your character stats intact, so most players shouldn't have a problem exploring strange new worlds as they open up for business in the ULTIMA ONLINE universe. ULTIMA VIII). Those who really aren't into quests and want a sort of extended chat area can live a perfectly fine virtual life as a baker. Of course, if your pastries become renowned throughout the land, you could lead an ancillary existence as a purveyor of information to travelers seeking adventure. Likewise, a blacksmith known for crafting swords with a well-honed edge will be highly sought after as well. While being a craftsman really is role playing in a general sense, most of us crave a bit more action and suspense in our daily RPG lives. don't want to give away any major plot twists, but be assured that there are plenty of things going on in the ULTIMA ONLINE world. Some are obvious, such as Lord British's struggle to impose order and virtues upon the world, and the attempts by the forces of chaos (supposedly led by Lord Blackthorn) to stop him. Others are more subtle, involving the manipulation of magical forces, the finding of hidden teleportation areas, the binding of strange creatures, and the like. Then there are the guilds. There are straightforward guilds of craftsmen, and even assassins' BUT HOW DOES IT PLAY?

To keep such gamers from having a collection of ULTIMA scalps to line their virtual trophy case (next to their ears from DIABLO), the designers have multiple lines of defense. The game engine remembers when a character has committed a misdeed, and will actively pursue and arrest you in towns, and may even offer an armed escort to mer. chants or travelers to protect from highway robbers. If this fails, keep in mind that the Origin staff will be playing the game on a regular basis, with the capability of removing malcontents. This doesn't mean that they will adopt a Big Brother attitude, just that they aren't going to stand by and watch a handful of players disrupt the structure of the game world.

"PREVIEWS DECISIVE BATTLES OF WWII: THE ARDENNES OFFENSIVE FAST-PACED, FLUID COMBAT 16 : Hotto 116.23 Marche * of historical variants. All of the scenario options appear to be based on a purely historical rendering of the battle. As with many other wargames, this means that gamers get a single campaign game covering the entire battle and then a multitude of scenarios that each cover one small element of the campaign. A little variability in the arrival of reinforcement, or perhaps some political tinkering, could give the game added playabilily at little cost to the historical version. Sure, purists would be appalled, but they can stick to playing the historical game and sending hysterical messages over Usenet. As for me, I like to have as many opportunities for new and different challenges as possible. arche 1350 13 cil Ol The true test of a wargame is how it deals with combat. DECISIVE BATTLES does a masterful job of organizing attacks in such a way that most of the factors one would like to see in a wargame come into play. The results are fair, and for the most part, reasonable. They are also random enough that you can't predict every outcome, and less sanguine gamers may find themselves fingernail-free by the end of the game. Here, Panzer Lehr, 560 Infantry, and elements of the 116th Panzer Division close in on Allied infantry units in the town of Marche. Like most Bulge games, DECISIVE BATTLES breaks the majority of divisions down into three separate regimental units. A few independent battalion or regimental units also come into play, as do engineers and independent artillery. Each unit may have up to three steps which can be destroyed in combat and replaced through, well, replacements. As one might expect, as units become depleted their combat strength diminish es, so that your forces can be gradually eroded away. Thus, management of replacements is a key issue both for sus taining a defensive line and keeping the momentum when attacking. The terrain is generally a pain to tra verse, particularly along the main German axis of attack: It includes twisting roads: many bridges (that likely will be blown up by the time you get to them); woods on all sides. Lateral movement-crucial to break ing out both from the starting point and later Allied defense lines-can require considerable finesse and planning. Speaking of combat, the designers have included virtually every factor one could expect into the combat tables, so that careful planners and good tacticians will be rewarded with considerably better odds. (See the sidebar for a more detailed explanation.) Following in the footsteps of many computer wargames of late, DECISIVE BATTLES looks like a board wargame, with a hexagonally based map and cardboard counter-like units. As an additional homage to the Avalon Hill classics of old-including multiple editions of a Battle of the Bulge game--the stacking rules allow only three units per space. From the beta it looks at though DECISIVE BATTLES will be playable head-to head, live via modem or LAN, or by email. As some German turns took me well over half an hour, I suspect that the email option will be the most frequently used. As the larger campaign games are only 32 or 64 turns long, this seems quite functional, and the interface and familiar turn-based system are well-suited to an email format. One small quibble I have with the ver. sion I received was the lack of any kind The German player then commits some or all of the units adjacent to the town. It's very easy to select and deselect eligible units while keeping an eye on the final odds, thus allowing you to tinker with the attack until you have just the right mix. aus KILLER AI As one would expect from the folks at SSG (and SSI, for that matter), the artificial intelligence looks pretty strong, though the scenarios were still far from being balanced at press time. All in all, I suspect that DECISIVE BATTLES will be a big hit with the wargaming crowd. The beta looks good, plays quickly and easily, and rewards those who are willing to plan carefully, count hexes, and fiddle with the odds. There are a few missing pieces. For instance, the traffic congestion markers on my version didn't display a number indicating the num. ber of movement points addedwhich the documentation says will be in the final version. Also, the computer never blew bridges when on defense, a crucial flaw that makes the Americans somewhat easy to overrun at present. But these are minor quibbles, especially since this beta was more fun to play than many finished products I've seen. Against a human opponent, DECISIVE BATTLES should be a tense and enjoyable game, probably the best ever on the Battle of the Bulge. Now, when are they going to apply this system to the Western Desert? FORES The computer totals the basic attack and defense factors as well as bonuses (or penalties) for divisional integrity, supply, or entrenchments. It then computes odds, which in turn are modified. The defenders get a four-column odds shift simply for being on defense, plus additional column shifts for artillery support within range. The attackers get shifts for attacking from multiple directions, for artillery, for leaders, and for air support. Having all the combat info you need on one screen makes force management easy, and the computer conveniently shades off units that have moved already, as well as those that have attacked.

"Jane's F-15 Taking the Lid Off Origin Skunkworks' Project «Big Bird» Jane's F-15 Estimated Release Date: Early 1988 Developer: Origin Skunkworks East Publisher: Jane's Combat Simulations HOC DOXASSO 1) 5 n an unassuming office park on the outskirts of Baltimore, a team of designers is meticulously working to duplicate one of the U.S. military's highest-tech weapons systems. By poring over documents obtained from the Air Force and NASA, examining satellite data, consulting with exand active duty military pilots, and gathering data from one of the most respected authorities on military operations in the world, they've managed to replicate the most minute details of this system. The project is covered by a shroud of utmost secrecy. When questioned as to what they're up to, team members only own up to the project's ambiguous code name: \"Big Bird.\" In late April, I traveled to Maryland and infil. trated this secret office. The East Coast branch of Origin Skunkworks, to be exact, where for the last year a team with credits that include such acclaimed sims as F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER, F-14 FLEET DEFENDER, and F-15 STRIKE EAGLE III has been working on the next product for Jane's Combat Simulations. As the first journalist to ever enter the offices, I felt like I was about to be let in on a great military secret. Some of the team members seemed anxious to spill the beans, while others appeared to feel awkward to be revealing what's been kept secret for so long. They cued up a video, and Desert Storm footage flashed by the screen. Then the product name appeared: Jane's F-15. Yes, the Eagle flies again. Prose's F-15 STRIKE EAGLE III, so he brings a proven track record to the F-15 simulation. The members of his team bring equally impressive experience, with products on their resumés that read like a list of the best simulations of the '80s and early '90s. Jane's has, so far, focused on two types of simulations: survey sims, such as U.S. NAVY FIGHTERS, where you can fly an entire range of related aircraft; and specialized sims such as AH-64D LONGBOW, where a single aircraft is simulated in exacting detail. JANE'S F-15 is one of the latter, focusing on the F-15E Strike Eagle, the dual-role strike fighter version of the McDonnell Douglas jet. ale Striking The project is being headed by Andy Hollis, who's most recent product was the 1996 Premier Award winner for simulations, JANE'S AH-64D LONGBOW (LONGBOW was created by the other division of Origin Skunkworks, based in Model Excellence By focusing on a single aircraft, the team is able to simulate its performance and systems in exact detail. The most groundbreaking aspect of JANE's F-15 is the flight model. In previous sims, developers have gathered data on aircraft performance and attempted to create routines that will let their modeled planes approximate that performance data in common circumstances. The Skunkworks team took a different approach: They obtained the math that the Air Force itself uses to model aircraft characteristics-DATCOM, a series of huge books that incorporate pretty much everything the Air Force has learned about flight, and they've incorporated those equations directly into the program. The DATCOM research was publicly funded, so it was available to the team-although not easy to obtain. But that was only part of the puzzle: The DATCOM formulas model aircraft stability and control, but in a general respect. To use them, ALBINO EAGLE The F-15 pictured here is the \"albino\" F-15C pure-fighter variant; the F-15E models will be even more detailed. JULY 1997 "

OTTO WOOOOO doBOO DODOOD hold, bank angle hold-the program doesn't just move the plane into the right position, it actually imparts the correct inputs to the con trol surfaces to stabilize the plane. External stores-weapons and fuel tanks-are all modeled with the proper weights and aerody. namic drag. You'll see significantly different han dling between a \"clean\" F-15E and one armed to the teeth. \"It's gonna be a pig when it's all loaded up,\" says Kreafle. When you release weapons, the plane's balance and aerodynamics will be affected accordingly. Because the F-15 isn't a fully fly-by-wire plane like the F-16, the flight computers don't put limits on what the pilot can do, and that may cause problems for gamers used to being able to jerk the stick all the way back. \"If you yank back on the stick in one of these airplanes, you'll kill yourself,\" says Kreafle. \"The F. 000 VUM INSGE 00 OOOOO 10 BODO 10000 INSTRUMENTAL FEATURES The F-15E's systems are modeled in such detail that you'll actually be able to use the mouse to interact with the up-front control panel and MFDs. what it really feels like to pass through the sound barrier--transonic effects on aircraft handling are also part of the flight model. BACK SEAT DRIVER Jane's F-15 also lets you operate all the back-seat weapons systems officer functions. you need stability derivatives for the specific air: craft you're modeling, Luckily, the team was able to enlist the help of a group of Air Force engineers who shared the unclassified F-15 per. formance coefficients. Once the data was plugged in, the Air Force engineers ran the same tests as the JANE'S F.15 team so they could compare and check the data. NASA documents were used to fill in the gaps for modeling different speeds and angles of attack. By using the actual flight equations, all the plane's performance characteristics \"come for free,\" says Greg Kreafle, one of the sim's design ers. \"Instead of making the sim's physics fit a performance curve, by modeling the actual char acteristics, the performance falls out,\" Kreafle says. \"So all the subtle effects we get, because we're doing it for real. You don't have to deal with the weird transitional stuff-it's there,\" he adds. With earlier sims, things like stalls, flat spins, and speed bleed had to be specifically modeled as \"special case\" items. For the DATCOM formulas to work, you also need a very realistic atmos: phere model. With this, you get many of the details that other sims leave outcontrol surfaces that have less effect at higher altitudes, and Mach numbers that change depending on altitude. JANE'S F.15 is likely to be the first sim that approximates All Systems Go Once the initial data was plugged in, the team was ready to test the flight model. And when they first took their virtual Eagle into the skies, they realized something was terribly wrong-the plane was a bear to control, and didn't feel right at all. There was nothing wrong with their math. It turned out they were indeed properly modeling an F-15-an F-15 without the Computer Aided Stability (CAS) system, that is. Although the F-15 isn't a fly-by-wire aircraft, it does have (and requires) a set of computers to counteract the basic instability that makes it so maneuverable. Rather than trying to find a workaround, the team set out to recreate the functionality of the F-15's autopilot systems. When you engage var. ious autopilot modes-altitude hold, attitude 15 will let you do what you want. This thing will pull a 15 G maneuver and break itself up into a thousand pieces.\" Varying G limitations in different flight regimes are part of the flight model, and you'll find there are some flight modes where pulling 9 Gs is a fatal no-no.

"COVER STORY 15 heads-up display (HUD) with the very top of the instrument panel showing. Look down into the cockpit, though, and you'll see an exact replica of a real F-15E's instrument panel; the same applies for the WSO (weapons systems operator, pro. nounced \"whizzo\") position in the rear seat. Views outside the cockpit are of the type used in AIR WARRIOR 2 and WARBIRDS, with eight primary directional views, as well as up and down modifiers for each view. It is hoped that the adoption of this viewing system by the JANE'S F.15 team will help promote it as an industry standard. The up-front control panel and the multifunc. tion displays (MFDs) all have functioning buttons, and you can work your way through recreations of the F-15's actual system menus. This is provided not only for realism fans, but also for those virtual pilots who'd rather not have to learn dozens of keypresses to operate the jet's various systems. The complete suite of systems is modeled, with a few exceptions. Although radar control is realistically modeled, for example, there are some esoteric modes that are almost never used by actual F-15 pilots. JANE'S F-15 will faithfully replicate all the air-to-air and air-to-ground modes that pilots do use. \"We want to provide realism, but in a way where it's for the benefit of the user,\" says TAKE OFF, EH With the sim's realistic flight model, you'll find takeoffs and landings have a different feel. Raise the nose, and when the plane gains enough speed, lift will cause the plane to leave the runway. set to simplified mode. \"Far be it for us to tell you how to have your fun,\" he adds. Hollis. \"We're not out to out-knob and out switch everybody. What we want to do is provide all the options that are appropriate and provide access to them in an intuitive way.\" That doesn't mean you'll need F-15 training to take to the skies, though. Simplified modes will also be available, and realism levels can be adjusted for individual systems and aircraft char. acteristics. \"Where things are intuitive,\" Hollis says, \"we provide it the real way, but also in a way where beginners can figure out how to do it.\" And there's no penalty for playing with everything Sightseeing At this early stage, F.15 is up and running with only 2D graphics cards, in 256 color mode. Don't think that dooms you to slow, blocky graphics, though. The reality-based flight model the system uses actually depends on a fast frame rate for accuracy, as the flight calculations can't have much of a real-time gap between updates. Hence, the team has worked to insure smooth frame rate even on mid-range Pentiums without 3D cards. If you examine the screens that accompany this article, you'll notice there's no blockiness in the terrain textures. The team is doing a sort of software simulation of bilinear filtering that scatters pixels at color borders. It doesn't match hardware filtering, but it's a dramatic improve ment over traditional 2D filters. Real-time light sourcing is present. Many of the F.15E missions were flown near dawn and McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle Type: Two-seat, dual-role fighter/attack plane. Power plant: Two Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 turbofans, each rated at 23,450 lb. thrust. Armament: 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon, up to 24,500 lb of external weapons including AMRAAM and AIM-9 missiles as well as various bombs and air-to-ground missiles. Maximum speed: Mach 2.5. First flight: July 27, 1972 (F-15A); December 11, 1986 (F-15E). The F-15E went into active service just in time for the Gulf War, where pilots-many of whom had only recently finished checking out in the new fighter-built an exemplary record. The F-15E is a formidable strike aircraft, capable of carrying over 24,000 pounds of ordnance. But it retains all the air-to-air capabilities of its \"albino\" (so named because of their lighter paint schemes) predecessors, making it a formidable fighter threat that can act as its own escort.

"SO COVER STORY STRIKE EAGLE Expert Advice dusk, so be prepared for some dramatic shadowing effects as morning breaks. Aircraft are also realistically lighted-as in real life, a glint off a canopy may be your first visual indication of an enemy aircraft. FLYING THE F-15E IN THE GULF WAR William L. Smallwood AUTHOR OF WARTHOG Into the Action The sim will feature three modes of play: quick action, single missions, and the mission builder. Quick action lets you set up a dogfight against a single aircraft type, or a strike against a ground target that can be optionally defended by air assets. Single missions focus around the game's elaborate mission builder. Not only will you be able to set the typical mission characteristicstarget, waypoints, altitudes, defenses, and so on-but the mission builder also incorporates events. You can trigger actions in the scenario based on a goal being completed, or on air craft entering a certain area, for example, Instead of designating specific targets, you can create an area goal, where you're tasked with taking out as many targets as possible in a predefined kill box. Not only can you edit briefing text, but you can also associate your own text and voice mes. sages with events. Debriefs aren't fixed for win/loss, but can be based on a goal matrix where the text will vary depending on which of a number of goals were reached. The campaign is planned to mix the best ele. ments of dynamic and scripted campaigns. eorge Wargo, a former F-15 pilot, is an advisor for Jane's F-15 (he also served this role for F-15 STRIKE EAGLE III). Along with his experienced advice on mission structures and flight modeling, Wargo also provided a connection that allowed the Big Bird team an unprecedented opportuni. ty to test their routines: he was able to get them onto a real F-15E base. The team was able to fly for hours in F-15E simulators, checking performance characteris. tics, filming HUD/FLIR tapes, and recording warning sounds and the Bitchin' Betty voice. They were also able to work in switchology sims that allowed them to more exactly repli cate the functions of the various switches and MFDs. In addition, they taped interviews with F-15E pilots and WSOs, some of whom were Desert Storm veterans. If you want to get a jump start in preparing for the sim, locate a copy of Strike Eagle: Flying the F-15E in the Gulf War, by William L. Smallwood. Published by Brassey's, this excit ing retrospective served as an unofficial \"bible\" for Big Bird's development. Although the campaigns aren't randomly gener. ated, your actions do affect future missions. Destroy a bridge in one mission, and it will still be demolished if you fly over it in the next mis. sion. On a following mission, you may see a pontoon bridge, and a few missions later a partially built replacement. In addition, if you fail to take out a target, you may be tasked later with taking it out again. While individual missions may be prescript ed, some elements are randomized, so you can't always count on the same interceptors coming from the same area. Aircraft and target locations can change. At any rate, you won't be reflying missions in a campaign in an effort to better your score. Campaigns are handled at a squadron level, and if your pilot is killed on a mission, you'll need to choose a new Pilot and WSO to fly as in the next one. Taking away the ability to refly a failed mission adds another level of realism, and makes bringing your plane back intact even more important Both campaigns in the sim are based around Iraq. The first is a historical campaign based on Operation Desert Storm; the second is a hypothetical campaign that assumes Saddam hadn't stopped at Kuwait, but had pushed into Saudi Arabia. More to come There are dozens of other features that I don't have room to go into, such as saveable custom weapons loads and optional resource management. At this stage of development, there's still plenty left for the team to add to the simulation. The whats and whens of 3D card support and multiplayer play are still to be decided, and the missions are still under development. Look for a detailed, hands-on preview in these pages as JANE'S F-15 grows closer to release.

The sim supports the TCP/IP protocol for LAN, modem, and direct connect play. Bandwidth is the only limitation on number of players-there's no hard-coded ceiling. Ten has an exclusive deal for online multiplayer play, so don't expect to see easy support for direct internet connections. If that's the case, however, it's almost certain that Kali or a similar product will find a way to kludge free Internet play for FALCON 4.0. That's not to say that you shouldn't consid er the Ten option, however. Not only will the service provide a low-latency connection and matchmaking, but it also has the potential to provide an AiR WARRIOR II/WARBIRDS Style per sistent arena. The development team hopes to work with Ten to create a server that will allow you to fly missions, log off, and come back the next day to find that 24 hours have passed in the game world, the war has con tinued, and the bridge you blew up yesterday is still gone. The hooks are already in the game for such a connection. CLEAR VIEW Pop-up MFDs let you remain in full-screen HUD view; a full instrument panel is also available. Mission Orders FALCON 4.0 will have four modes of play. Instant Action is designed to get you up in the air for quick combat. You can fly immediately, or configure air-to-air or air-to-ground combat, your starting position, and enemy skill level. Scoring is based on a point system where each plane has a base score (roughly the cost of the air craft), and there's a modifier that depends on how many planes are shooting at you. You pay points for each weapon you fire, so you won't want to indiscriminately lob Sidewinders around. Dogfight Mode is basically Instant Action tailored for multiplayer. Configure up to four flights F-16C Fighting Falcon Type: Single-seat multi-role fighter. Power plant: General Electric F110-GE-1000 turbofan, rated at 27,600 lb. thrust.

Dogfights can be dynamic, where players can enter and leave at will, or you can start only when everyone's ready. Tactical Engagement is where you'll find the mission builder. A series of missions will be included, and you can design your own or download them from the Net. You can configure virtually every aspect of a mission here, placing ground troops, air targets, waypoints--the works. The meat of the game is the campaign mode. This is a real-time, truly dynamic campaign engine. In fact, it's so real-time that, as you're working with the campaign interface planning your next mission, your airbase can actually come under attack, forcing you to scramble in its defense. The campaign engine will provide you with a list of missions appropriate to the current battle situation. Once you choose a mission, you can use the flight planner to modify its parameters. In addition to adjusting waypoints, you can alter altitude parameters and climb rates (best speed to altitude or a fuel conserving climb), and set up pop-up attacks. Routes can be based on time-ontarget, or simply on speed. One of the pieces of information you'll get in the mission briefing is the contrail level. You'll JULY 1997 CGW "

"COVER STORY want to make sure you don't cruise at this level, or your aircraft will leave visual advertisements of your position. You can also view other active flights. At a given moment, you might find two B-52 flights and two F-16 flights. After selecting the F-16 flight, you could hop into the cockpit en route and join the mission, as long as they're not already directly over the target. Three starting conditions are possible. The neutral scenario starts the battle at the current demilitarized zone. The disadvantaged scenario puts South Korean forces at the southern tip of the country, with U.S. reinforce ments just arriving. The advantaged scenario has South Korea pushing North Korean forces back into China-and China entering the conflict. 05 Bells & Whistles There's plenty more innovation planned for the program. Like FIGHTER DUEL 2, FALCON 4.0 supports multiple-processor Windows NT PCS, SO performance maniacs can take advantage of dual Pentium Pro machines.

A wide variety of weapons are available, including rearand all aspect Sidewinders, as well as both TV. and I Maverick missiles. The preliminary version of FALCON 4.0 I saw left little doubt in my mind that it's going to be a worthy successor to the classic FALCON 3.0.

"COVER STORY Sabre Ace 3D Air Combat Over the Skies of Korea or aviation buffs, the Korean Air War is perhaps the most fasci nating aerial battle in history. It featured the ultimate in prop driven aircraft battling the first jets, in an age before missiles. Yet, other than a nod in CHUCK YEAGER'S AIR COMBAT a few years back, and the deserted Korean arena in AIR WARRIOR, the conflict has been ignored by sim producers since the days of the Atari 800. The Korean Air War is finally getting its deserved spotlight, with Virgin's SABRE Ace and Empire's MIG ALLEY both slated to ship before year's end. CGW recently received a late alpha version of SABRE ACE, and it looks like the wishes of Korean War sim fans will finally be fulfilled. Missions are prescripted, rather than dynamically generated, and the detail is very impressive. Voice communications run throughout, giving your flight leader and wingmen personalities. In addition, you often encounter other allied aircraft performing strikes in the same area. Your F-51 flight might be tasked with taking out a series of bridges while B-26 Invaders bomb a nearby airfield. In addition, some of the missions on different sides of the war are tied together. In one American F-80 mission, you're tasked with escorting General MacArthur's C-54 transport from Japan to Suwon. In a Yak-9 mission, you'll try to shoot down MacArthur's plane before it can land at Suwon. The 45 missions are divided between flying escort of bombers, transports, and photo recon aircraft; flying ground support; and flying combat Sabre Ace Estimated Release Date: September, 1997 Developer: Eagle loteractive Publisher: Virgin Flight Line SABRE Ace allows you to fly on both sides of the conflict. On the American side, you'll start with a series of missions in F-51D Mustangs. You'll then progress to the straight-winged F-80 Shooting Star jet, and final ly to the swept-wing F-86F Sabre. On the Russian side, you'll start in the prop-driven Yak-9 and move up to the MiG-15 jet. In addition, there's a series of training missions to bring new players through the basics of takeoff and landing, navigation, ground attack, and air combat. An instructor talks you through each task in a manner similar to the original FLIGHT UNLIMITED. You'll start in either the T-6 Texan or the Yak-18, depending on whether you're flying for the American side or for the Russian side. SMOOTH FLYING You won't see any blockiness on the ground if you have a 3D card, as SABRE Ace supports bilinear filtering and other 3D tricks, Virtual Air Force SABRE Ace features a wide variety of Korean War-era aircraft.

"COVER STORY Phantom Ace agle Interactive is also hard at work on its next simulation, PHANTOM ACE. Set in Vietnam, this simulation will put you in the cockpits of Air Force, Navy, and North Vietnamese aircraft. You'll be able to load your saved SABRE ACE pilot, simulating a Korean veteran flying in the next conflict. SABRE VS. MIG When high speed jets face off sans missiles, pilots will need quick reflexes to attain victory 5 patrols. None of these are milk runs, so don't expect to work your way through them over a weekend. Armament includes guns, unguided rockets, bombs, and napalm. In addition to the scripted missions, there's also a custom flight section where you can set up battles with up to four aircraft on each side. You're limited to the planes that are flyable in the campaign mode, but your wingmen and opponents can fly any of the aircraft in the sim. If you just want some basic gunnery practice, set up all your opponents as unarmed C-119 Flying Boxcars. You can adjust time of day, enemy skill levels, starting altitude, and cloud cover. Although it wasn't yet implemented in the ver. sion I tested, developer Eagle Interactive also promises multiplayer support in the final product. This will be head-to-head air combat, with a setup similar to the Custom Flight section. NICE PANELING PHANTOM ACE will feature authentic instrument panels, even the F-4B and F-4E panels are modeled separately. from pushing into accelerated stalls, which makes the plane's vertical maneuvering a bit sluggish. The flight model is still a work in progress, though, and it's hoped that the maneuvering problem will be eliminated, or at least be toggleable, by the time the game ships. A unique feature is Formation Augmentation, a special autopilot mode that makes it easier to maintain your position in formation. This is especially important in early missions where you won't be flying in the formation. If you want to fly manual formation, you'll appreciate the padlock feature, which swaps between the various cockpit views to keep the enemy in sight. SABRE Ace is one of the first flight sims to use Direct3D. On a Rendition-based Screamin' 3D card, the game had one of the smoothest frame rates I've seen on a texture mapped flight sim. Performance on 2D-only cards was acceptable as well, but final judgment will have to await the release version. Explosions, aerial flak, and other effects (such as real-time light-source shading on aircraft) further enhance the sim's visual appeal. With a wide variety of never-before-simulated aircraft, immersive missions, and good 3D card support, SABRE ACE looks ready to launch the Korean War sim genre with style. Stick and Rudder The flight model tuning wasn't complete as of this writing, but initial indications are positive. For instance, the MiG-15 is suitably touchy at low speed, and you'll need to be careful not to depart from controlled flight when landing. The version I flew had a G-limiter that prevented you Flyable aircraft include the F-8 Crusader, F-4 Phantom, and A-4 Skyhawk for the Navy: F-100 Super Sabre, F-105 Thud, and F-4E Phantom for the Air Force, and the MiG-17 and MiG-21 for the North Vietnamese Air Force (where you'll fly as a Russian pilot). In the Eagle Interactive tradition, there will also be a wide variety of other period aircraft present, including the F-104, B-57, A6, A-50, B-52, KA-3, F.11, and F-5 Skoshi Tiger Carrier operations and aerial refueling will add new challenges for pilots. As in SABRE ACE, there will be a training syllabus. This time you'll be able to fly the T-2 Buckeye, TA-4 Skyhawk, T-37 Tweet, and T-38 Talon. PHANTOM ACE will model the technical advances that occurred as the war progressed. For instance, early in the war, ECM Jamming and radar warning receivers weren't common, so you may not have their benefits on early missions. F-104 Starfighters will only be in the the aler early in the war, F-111s only near the end. Eagle Interactive's Gary Kinney says you won't see any flat terrain in this game as the game will simulate the actual topography of Vietnam.

The actions of these planes aren't scripted, either. They'll taxi towards aerobatic aircraft, but this one seems realistically around SFO and other airports, enter equally impressive. The C172 seems to handle landing patterns, and do all the other things you'd just like the real thing, both in normal flight and normally see in the skies.

Ground, tower, approach, departure, Unicom, and ATIS information frequencies are all active and packed with authentic traffic. This traffic isn't canned, either. FLIGHT UNLIMITED 2 builds appropriate communication on the fly using a splicing technique. A real air traffic controller provides the ground voice, and also helped ensure the accuracy of the communication. As you tune to an appropriate frequency you'll hear both the tower and other aircraft. Sitting on the ground at SFO and listening to planes being directed to vari ous taxiways is eerily like the real thing. Interaction with the ground controllers is handled through a menu system where you build appropriate requests. You'll generally only need a few keypresses to request entry into a pattern, get takeoff clearance, and so on. Cessna 172 Type: Four-seat general aviation monoplane.

The focus is on what you need to know to play the game-wannabe pilots looking for all the gory details may want to pick up a copy of Sierra's Pro Pilot as well. You might even try adding some weather effects. FLIGHT UNLIMITED 2 will support two cloud decks, as well as realistic rain. To get in the air, there's a quick flight setting that lets you choose basic condition and your location (in the air at a specific spot, at an airport, or on a 3-mile approach to any runway in the game). There's also a more sophisticated flight planning tool which lets you interactively set up routes on a detailed sectional chart. Your flights can take place during various times of day, but there's no real-time transition. It was too difficult to implement convincingly with photorealistic terrain. FLIGHT UNLIMITED II should please any. one with an interest in real flying. While some may find the single geographic area limiting (add-on discs covering other regions are planned), the fantastic detail more than makes up for it, and the San Francisco Bay area has plenty of variety. cow CGW JUL 397 "

If you have a cluttered desktop, but often can't easily get to the desktop because of multiple open windows, click on the Deskmenu icon, and you'll get a menu containing all items on your desktop. Download Power Toys at the following address: www.microsoft.com/ windows/common/contentW95UGB.htm. 1. Norton Utilities Whether you're still using DOS and Windows 3.11 or have fully made the move to Windows 95, Norton Utilities is a must-have item (just don't use the older versions on Win 95 problems). Though I generally don't find much use for items like the System Doctor, tools like Disk Doctor and Norton Diagnostics (which only runs in DOS) are invaluable. One feature that I was initially skeptical about is the System Genie. But once you get by the overly-cute interface, there are some very nice gems in there. Want to change the way Windows 95 handles long file names? Consult the Genie. Want to hide some of those pesky desktop icons? Consult the Genie. Want to be young rich, and thin?

There was a club in Seattle, the Mountaineers, that came up with the idea of the Ten Essentials. This idea says that if you go traipsing off into the wilderness, you should-at a minimum-take along Ten Essentials. These include obvious items like extra food and clothes, and not-so-obvious (but necessary) items like sunglasses and sunscreen. Along those same lines, there are some tools-software and hardwarethat I frequently use when hunting down an elusive system bug. And since any really good idea is worth stealing, I'd like to offer up my Ten Essentials for computer troubleshooting. system bug. 3. Kernel Toys At the same URL as Power Toys, you can find Kernel Toys. These are utilities that make life easier for the DOS gamer. When you run a DOS game from Win 95, a default set of condition exists, as sct in the \"virtual\" AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. One of the Kernel Toys, DOSWZCFC, allows you to change those defaults. But, the user interface is a little on the arcane side. Another Kemel Toy called DOSWINKY deactivates the Windows icon key on the keyboard when running DOS games. 'Nuff said. 4.

The most useful tool is TweakUI, which allows you to change a number of Win 95 options--and not just the user interface. You can change boot Memory Upgrades: A Point to consider  If you're considering adding more memory to improve your machine's performance, consider carefully how much you want to add. In some cases, you can actually add too much. Every Windows 95 system will benefit from having 32MB of memory. In most cases, even 64MB can be useful. There's a temptation to think that more is better but 'tain't necessarily so. For example, systems using the Intel 430VX and 430TX chipsets can't cache memory above 64MB. Some motherboards using the 430HX chipset can theoretically cache up to 512MB, but only actually cache the first 64MB if the vendor has skimped and left out the necessary TAG RAM, which stores cache memory addresses. If enough isn't present, higher memory addresses won't be cached, Continued on page 120 >>> You can reach Loyd at his new email address: Icase@pacbell.net JULY 1997 CGW "


"LOYD CASE Who's In Charge Here? Advanced Graphics Settings 2X A9 010 N 1011 These settings control how Windows uses your graphics hardware. They can help you troubleshoot display-related problems. Graphics Hardware acceleration None >>>Continued from pg 119  If you have an older S3-based graphics card, such as the Diamond Stealth 64 or Hercules Terminator Pro, you may notice relatively poor performance on some Windows 95 games. It turns out there's a conflict between the Win 95 drivers and the Win 95 accelerator feature. To turn off the Win 95 accelerator feature, right click on My All accelerator functions: Use this setting if your computer has no problems. (Recommended) OK Cancel hard disk. Microsoft has supplied FDISK since the carly days of DOS, but the basic user interface is still the same. Partition Magic cleans up the interface with a graphical (but non-windows) interface. While handy for new disks, Partition Magics real benefit comes when you want to reconfigure your existing drive. I recently installed OSR2 (OEM Service Release 2) of Win 95 so I could add the FAT32 file system to my disks. FAT32 removes the 2GB disk partition limit and expands it to two terabytes. Normally, I would have had to back up all my drives, run FDISK, reformat my drives, reinstall Windows, reinstall my backup program, and finally, restore my files. Partition Magic 3.0 allowed me to change all my partitions to FAT32 without losing a byte of data. Download the 3.02 patch from Powerquest before attempting to merge volumes. Check it out al www.powerquest.com. Computer, click the Performance tab, click Graphics, and turn down the accelerator slider to zero (see graphic).

In addition to showing you what's installed on your box (or what Win 95 thinks is installed), it may reveal an errant device responsible for an 1/O resource conflict. Bring up the Control Panel, double-click on the System icon, and select the Device Manager tab dialog. You'll see a listing of devices, and any misbehaving device will have an icon that's an exclamation point in a yellow circle. This isn't a diagnostic tool per sc, but it can provide important clues when hunting down an clusive system glitch. running slowly, I've used both the WinBench Graphics WinMark and the CPUMarks to see if my system was running up to snuff. A couple of times, I've uncovered radical slow-downs owing to older 16-bit drivers that may have been installed without my knowledge. WinBench gives me a baseline performance figure. To get WinBench, check out www.zdbop.com. 7. Scitech Display Doctor Scitech Softwares Display Doctor started out life as UniVBE, and allows non-VBE (VESA BIOS Extensions) graphics cards to run VBE-based SVGAgraphics resolution games. It also comes with other useful utilities, including VBE Test, which checks your graphics card for VESA compliance. Since I go through a lot of graphics cards, Display Doctor is an invaluable tool at $35. Download a trialware version from Scitech at www.scitechsoft.com 10. Recovery Disk A recovery disk is essential, whether you use the Win 95 Control Panel to create a basic one or Norton Utilities to create a Cadillac version. You need an appropriate minimum set of tools-FDISK, SCANDISK XCOPY, EDIT, SYS, and FORMAT to recover from disk problems. On occasion, I've lost something potentially disastrous --such as the boot sector on my hard disk. With a recovery disk, I can usually run utilities to repair the problem. It can save an cnormous amount of blood, sweat, tears, and toil. 5. Syquest Syjet 1.5 The Syjet is a 1.5CB, removable hard disk from Syquest, and the external version is two, yes, two drives in one. It's primarily a SCSI drive, but also comes with a parallel-to-SCSI adapter cable. Just buy the «parallel port\" version of the Syjet and you also get a SCSI drive. I use the Syjet for backup. It comes with a limited, but very useful, backup utility. It's fast, easy, and once you make the up-front investment of $500, chcap. Cartridges cost around $125-less than ten cents per megabyte. Backing up to this baby has saved my bacon on several occasions. And, because it's so fast, I back up more often. For more information, check out www.syquest.com. 8. Electric Screwdriver & Forceps These may seem like luxuries, but to me they're essentials. The electric screwdriver can pop open a case and remove (or install) expansion cards or peripherals in no time. And the forceps are useful for installing jumpers in awkward locations, and getting into hard-to-reach spots. KEEP THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE If you find yourself getting frustrated and reaching for a hammer, walk away. Remeinber that a world exists outside of that beige box sitting on your desk. Get some sleep, read a good book, or take a walk. It's amazing how sometimes a solution will suddenly pop into your head when you're not intensely focused on the problem. Computers should only be a diversion, like the games we play on them. As I check the clock, I see it's time to get going, I'm off for a good day's hike. I guess that new motherboard will have to wait until next week. & 6. WinBench 97 Huh? A benchmark in my set of troubleshooting tools? You bet. On a number of occasions where things seemed to be 9.

"HARDWARE TUTTE Make your PC by Loyd Case nly a few years back, there seemed to be sound cards coming out of the woodwork. Everyone was doing one, and like the 3D graphics chips of today, there were a host of boards from a wide array of vendors. Changes in the landscape of the sound card market have driven off all but a brave few-but only long enough for them to regroup. A slew of chip makers have recently announced PCI-based audio chipsets, most of which will make their debut later this year. These new chipsets will bring a couple of things to the party for gamers, but chief among them will be positional 3D-audio technology. Here's a look at one such board that's already here, Diamond's Monster Sound, as well as a look at some of the leading non-PCl-based sound cards on the market.

"Diamond Monster Sound Creative Labs AWE-64 Gold Of the most interesting products out there is Diamond's new Monster Sound. First off, this card goes into a PCI slot, not an ISA slot. And given how crowded the ISA bus has become, a PCI audio card is a welcome change. The PCI slot is no gimmick, however-this card needs PCI's additional bandwidth, because it's a true positional3D-audio accelerator card. The technology behind Monster Sound was developed by Aureal Semiconductor, who is something of a Phoenix, having risen out of the ashes of the old Media Vision bankruptcy and then merging with Crystal River Audio. They're now focused strictly on developing 3Dpositional audio chips. The MonsterSound is the first fruit of Aureal's 3D audio technology to hit computer store shelves. It's strictly a Windows 95 device, and makes no pretense of working in DOS exclusive mode. There is Sound Blaster emulation software that lets DOS games running in a Windows 95 DOS box think there's a Sound Blaster present, but Diamond strongly recommends keeping your old ISA sound card. Setting up and installing the Monster Sound is the audio equivalent of installing the company' s Monster3D graphics card.

"HARDWARE CEREALM Turtle Beach Tropez Plus Turtle Beach has long been synonymous with the high-end of sound cards. Several years ago, they made an abortive foray into multimedia kits and entry level audio. Recently, as they were returning to their roots-high quality audio-they merged with Voyetra. One of the results is Tropez Plus, a high-end, Sound Blaster Pro-compatible card with 4MB of wavetable ROM. The Tropez Plus uses Crystal Semiconductor's CS4232 for digital audio and Sound Blaster Pro emulation, and an ICS Wavefront Wavetable synth. Win 95 installation is easy. After sliding the Tropez into an ISA slot, Windows 95 autodetects the card and prompts you for drivers. The Tropez drivers are in a two-floppy set, which feel a bit odd in this CD-oriented era. Still, the installation is easy and straightforward. That is, until you discover that MIDI won't play. It turns out that the Tropez wants IRQ 9, but my network card had already grabbed that IRQ. The problem can be solved by de-installing the Ethemet card in the Windows 95 device manager and letting Windows re-detect it when it restarts. Once that little problem is solved, the Tropez Plus handles most Windows 95 audio chores with aplomb. Occasionally, the Tropez Plus control panel mysteriously crashes, but this doesn't seem to affect sound at all. The MIDI patches on this card sound terrific. In an A/B comparison with an AWE-32 with a Roland SCD-15 Sound Canvas daughtercard, the acoustic piano on the Tropez is every bit the equal of the Roland, which is high praise. The Star Wars theme, a 24voice MIDI sequence from LucasArts, sounds very good too, though I would give the nod to the Roland for string chorus sounds. Drums are less impressive though, with kick drum and snare sounds paling compared to the Roland. Digital audio sounds every bit as good as the AWE-64, although there is just a bit of background noise and the occasional light popping sound. Windows 95 games seem to run fine as well: RED ALERT, EMPEROR OF THE FADING SUN, MECHWARRIOR 2, AND MAGIC: THE GATHERING all play fine and sound great. If all this sounds too good to be true, well, read on. Problems begin to surface when configuring the Tropez for DOS mode. Booting into DOS with the Tropez Plus is an exercise in patience. It tests the onboard circuitry and downloads code to the audio chip, and it takes its sweet time doing it. Luckily, there's a little spinning doodad that tells you your system is still alive. The DOS installation program is good, but it warns you not to run it if you have Windows 95. Pay attention to what it says. You do not want the DOS stuff loaded when Windows 95 is running, as it seems to cause numerous mysterious lockups. When actually in DOS, the Tropez Plus seems to run in Sound Blaster mode quite well. I configured the original DOS version of PANZER GENERAL to recognize a Sound Blaster Pro and general MIDI wavetable card, and it sounded great The Tropez Plus has a connector for an IDE CD-ROM drive, and the manual is extensive, with a very solid troubleshooting guide, which you'll probably need if you're in DOS a lot. If you remain in Win 95 most of the time, however, the Tropez Plus is a solid card with a very solid wavetable and good digital audio. Turtle Beach Tropez Plus $230 (street) Contact: (800) 233-937 www.voyetra.com PROS: Very nice General MIDI Wavetable; fairly clean digital audio. CONS: DOS setup and boot is something of a chore; no 3D audio functionality. RATED Miromedia Surround The Miromedia Surround is an interesting little card that adds a Dolby ProLogic decoder in your PC's audio system, you have a spare ISA slot. There's also a surround sound mode using technology licensed from consumer electronics giant JVC. This card is more of a luxury item than necessity, since there are only a handful of ProLogic-enabled games out there. The Miromedia Surround is a typical Plug-and-Play device, meaning that Windows 95 will sometimes detect it, and sometimes not. Installing the Windows driver is simple; The hardware is something else again. The card installation is no problem, it's the speakers that Still, the Miromedia Surround give you trouble.

"HARDWARE Watch YOU The Future of Audio Is Behind You by Dave Salvator f you think about it, we can see\" much more with our ears than we can our eyes. We can determine the position, and often the direction, of sound usually without having to move our head. This process of how we determine both the position and direction of sounds is called \"localization, and researchers in an area called psychoacoustics have learned quite a bit about how humans localize sound. Using this knowledge, sound designers can fool our ears into telling our brain that a sound is at a specific location by applying digital filters. These filters approximate how sound behaves in the real world when at a given position-left, right, in front, behind, above, or below-relative to the listener. As audio migrates to the speedier PCI bus, and as graphics traffic is shifted over to the AGP architecture, gamers should look, CGW JULY 1997 "


"forward to the next aural dimension: real-time, 3D-positional audio. For a primer on the physics behind 3D audio, check out www.computergaming.com. In this article we'll take a look at the different approaches to doing 3D audio, some of the hardware in the works, and game developers' take on this new technology. Conventional Stereo: Sounds seem to come from between speakers. Some front-to-back range. typical PC audio and home hi-fi. Positional 3D Audio: This technology holds the most promise for gamers, since it allows sounds to be rendered in real-time and is ideal for mapping sounds, both stationary and moving. Positional 3D audio can also be used to virtualize a multispeaker array such as AC-3 into two speakers. This technology tends to be more effective in headphones, since each ear gets a well-isolated signal of the rendered sounds, but improvements have made this technology quite convincing, even when used with so-so multimedia speakers. Will the Real 3D Audio Please Stand up... Admittedly, the term «3D Audio\" has been the source of some confusion and much marketing hooey. But when all is said and done, 3D audio architectures basically fall into three camps: 3D Stereo, Multi-speaker Array, and Positional 3D Audio. All three spruce up traditional 2-channel stereo, but gamers will get the most benefit from the last two, because programmers can position individual sounds, rather than just apply a \"3D\" effect to the entire mix. Here's how each type works.  3D Stereo: These technologies are really \"2.5D\" implementations that essentially take an existing stereo output and \"spatialize\" it, meaning they apply some filters to the stereo signal to widen the perceived stereo field. This technology has shown up on sound cards and in speakers, and has been developed by companies like QSound, Spatializer, and SRS. The effect is an incremental improvement over traditional stereo, but these technologies offer little or no granularity for processing individual sounds.  Multi-speaker Array: Dolby is the best known champion of these technologies, both in movie theaters and home theater configurations like Pro Logic and Surround Sound, and more recently, AC-3. These technologies rely on placing actual speakers behind the listener, and then panning sounds into these rear speakers to give a 3D effect. Though primarily used for movies, several game titles, including the WING COMMANDER series and NovaLogic's F22 and COMMANCHE 3, have used ProLogic There's an interesting overlap here with DVD-ROM drives, which will soon be proliferating into PC markets. DVD movies use Dolby's AC-3 audio encoding, which is called a \"5.1\" setup consisting of left, right, center, left rear, right rear, and sub-woofer channels; or, in other words, five speakers and a sub-woofer. The main problem with these systems is the cost of the extra speakers and a multi-channel amplifier. Also, AC-3 is primarily designed for movies, and can't really be used for game audio, because it's too computationally intense to encode in real-time. So while the 3D audio here can be convincing, it remains to be seen whether gamers will want to shell out the cash for these elaborate speaker systems, though this setup could be ideal for a living-room PC. The good news here is that DVD/AC-3 will also help drive 3D positional-audio technologies, and both will go a long way toward bridging the quality gap that has long existed between Something Wicked This Way Comes Diamond's Monster Sound fully supports positional 3D audio, and though game titles that take full advantage of it are still DIAGRAMS: XPLANE / ILLUSTRATION: PETER BOLLINGER 3D Stereo: Sound range extended beyond speakers on either side, approaching 180°.

"Surround Sound: Five speakers used to place sounds completely around listener. expand other aspects of the game, especially audio. But before we can cross over into this brave new world of enhanced gaming, 3D audio does face some hurdles. Sound designers we interviewed at Maxis, Westwood, and Reality Bytes are all planning on implementing 3D audio in some form in upcoming titles. However, they express concern about Microsoft's recently revamped DirectSound 3D API still being somewhat incomplete. Like Direct3D on the graphics side, DirectSound 3D delivers a baseline quality level when using the CPU, but it's unable to use specific features of some hardware-based 3D audio technologies. Again, as with Direct3D, a universal API is a very alluring idea, but difficult to bring to fruition. As for CPU-based versus accelerator-based 3D audio, all three designers are impressed with Aureal Semiconductor's technology, but are also looking to use some CPU-based solutions as well. A key word all three echo is scalability, that is, building game audio so as to take advantage of a 3D audio accelerator if it's there, but also provide some scaled-down 3D audio if processing has to be done on the CPU. From the CPU-based solutions, David Chait of Reality Bytes says he's looking for a discernible difference in 3D quality with little or no additional CPU overhead. Of course, as is the case with 3D graphics, 3D audio rendering quality will vary widely across different chips, with some vendors making trade-offs and punting certain features to keep costs down. There will be a bevy of cards out there, ranging in quality from not-so-hot to very impressive. As more 3D audio and PCI-based audio parts, as well as new CPU-based 3D audio options, begin to circulate, we'll have at 'em and separate the posers from the real positioners. Stay tuned. For more on the innards of 3D audio, check out Durand Begault's 3D Sound for Virtual Reality and Multimedia (AP Professional). relatively few, this board delivers 3D audio that can be readily local ized, thanks to filtering technology from Aureal Semiconductor. Euphonics has also developed 3D positional filtering technology that will show up in VLSI's new SongBird chip. In addition to doing 3D stereo, QSound also has positional technology that will soon show up in a PCI-based audio chip. Crystal Semiconductor also has a PCI-based audio chip cooking that will support both Dolby AC-3 and positional 3D audio. For their part, Dolby is working on a positional technology, internally code-named \"Project X,\" that will be based on their ProLogic multi-channel architecture. There is one downside to Diamond's MonsterSound: It only supports Sound Blaster compatibility running under Win 95. PCI audio chips from VLSI, Crystal, and S3 will all support Sound Blaster audio running under MS-DOS mode, thanks by and large to a new feature called DirectDMA in Intel's 430TX, and all future-generation chipsets. Also on the horizon are a host of CPU-based 3D-audio technologies, many of which will take advantage of MMX, including QSound's QSoft3D, Intel's RSX, and Spatializer's enCompass. At press time, we didn't get a good listen to these technologies, but because full-bore 3D audio processing is pretty intensive, it's doubtful these CPU-based technologies will match the overall quality of their hardware-accelerated counterparts. Then again, because these technologies require no additional hardware, they're usually hard-wired into games, and won't cost you anything extra. But Why Does This Matter to Gamers? These new developments will most likely touch games before any other application, and we gamers will reap the reward, especially in first-person perspective games and simulations. Additionally, overall quality should also head north thanks to the higher bandwidth available on the PCI bus. And as AGP-based 3D-graphics chips take on more duties in the rendering pipeline, more CPU cycles will be available to Virtual Surround Sound: Two speakers used to place sounds completely around listener.

"*** REVIEW  STB NITRO 3D HARDWARE Lukewarm Nitroen W by Loyd Case seen so far. Image quality is pretty good, too. But even with this second-generation chip, S3 still trails ATI, Matrox, and Rendition-based cards in 3D WinMarks. If you want a fairly stable 2D accelerator with okay 3D performance and a great software bundle without paying through the nose-check out the Nitro3D. But if you want really fast 3D, you should look elsewhere. hen S3 delivered the VIRGE 2D3D accelerator chip last year, they beat many graphics chip vendors to the punch. Users then discovered that they had a pretty fast 2D accelerator, but the 3D graphics, although pretty, were less than speedy. In fact, unaccelerated versions of a game like DESCENT 2 woull actually run faster than the accelerated\" version. So, S3 went back to the drawing board and came out with the VRCE/CX and VIRGE/DX The GX-based Nitro, although capable of using SCRAM, comes with 4MB of 28 nanosecond Silicon Magic EDO DRAM, and lists for only $149. You also get a terrific game bundle that includes MECHWARRIOR MERCENARIES, INTERSTATE 76, SPYCRAFT, and HYPERBLADE. But, only HYPERBLADE actually supports 3D hardware acceleration through Direct3D. As a Windows 2D accelerator, Nitro 3D is a bit above average, but not much, posting 51.5 on WinBench 97 running at 1024x768x16-bit color on a Micron Millenia P166 test system. However, it does great on scaled video tests, scaling up a 320x240 AVI file to 800x600 (24-bit color) with only a single dropped frame. DOS performance was decent. Cbench DOS SVCA graphics score was 35.5 fps-again, good, but not great. QUAKE 1.07 ran speedily, but Nitro 3D doesn't support VESA 2.0 in hardware; you'll need a software VBE driver like Scitech Display Doctor. What about 3D? Using Ziff-Davis new 3D WinBench 97 (see related story in Read. Me), the Nitro 3D posted a score of 28.2. We've run quite a few cards through 3D WinBench by now, and the Nitro is the fastest S3-based card we've Price: $149 with 4MB EDO DRAM Manufacturer: STB Nitro 3D Distributor: STB, Inc. Richardson, TX (972) 234-8750 www.stb.com Reader Service #: 341 | APPEAL: Those looking for an inexpensive 3D card. PROS: Inexpensive, respectable 2D performance; great bundleware. CONS: Mediocre 3D performance; lack of VESA 2.0 support in firmware. RATEI **** REVIEW. RV-FLASH 3D Voodoo for Less to by Loyd Case HARDWARE Here's the bottom line: If you're looking for a very fast, 3Dfx-based 3D accelerator for a very modest price, and aren't concemed with software bundles, this card warrants a serious look. While technical support from an unknown manufacturer might be problematic, the card itself looks well-designed and solidly built. Its at least worth more than a casual glance hen Orchid Technologies shipped the first 3Dfx-based 3D accelerator, the visual and performance quality made a lot of W gamers drool with excitement The $299 list price, however, generated a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth. Since then the price has dropped to around $210 mail order, but it's still not a trivial purchase. Firing a shot across the bow of Orchid and Diamond is Taiwanese vendor Deltron, with their Flash 3D. At first blush, the Flash 3D closely resembles the other two 3Dfx boards on the market, complete with 4MB of 40 nanosecond EDO DRAM. But there's one important difference: it only costs $149. As you might expect from the low price, this board comes with few amenilies. The documentation, a few pages of photocopied text, gives new meaning to \"sparse.\" There's no real bundleware, just the CLQUAKE cxccutable (which requires the full version of QUAKE),clemos of TOMB RAIDER and CYBERGLADIATORS, and a Microsoft Game Sampler. Installation was very casy, though. Windows 95 delected the Plug-and-Play card and even found the correct driver on the Flash 3D driver diskette. One reboot later, and Flash3D was ready for action. The to the products sparse nature, there's no display control panel applet to adjust display parameters. As for performance, the card scored 97.2 on ZDs 3D WinBench on a Micron Millenia P166, just a couple of points behind the 99.2 posted by Orchid's Righteous 3D. We also ran CLQUAKES TimeDemo numbers, and Flash 3D matched Righteous 3D frame for frame, and the image quality was superb. Price: $149 Manufacturer: Deltron Taiwan, R.0.C.

"***** REVIEW X-WING VS TIE FIGHTER DIFFICULTY LEVEL Sans Solo SIMULATION/SPACE LucasArts' Newest Star Wars Sim Leaves Single Players in the Dust While exercises, mclccs, and combats are played as one-time missions, tournaments and battles record your progress. That's all there is to the game. You can jump around and play any mission at any time, but that's it. There's no progression between missions, no scenarios that open up after more wins; just a haphazard pool of available missions. All the missions can be played single player, but if you do, be prepared to lose often. Because the missions are designed for multiple pilots, and because the Al can't be counted on to fly as intelligently as humans, you'll often feel overwhelmed.

THE THE DARK SIDE OF THE GAME \"The biggest problem with XVT is the poor single-player component. There are no truly intercomecled missions and there isn't a shred of continuity in the game. The only encouragement for playing more than a few solo missions is to amass points. Multiplayer combat is the main focus for XVT, but still, the majority of people who are buying this product will no doubt also want to play some compelling solo games. If LucasArts had incorporated the original TIE RICHTER solo missions, or added some cut-scenes and mission debriefings between each battle mission, it would have added more value to the single-player game. Also, none of the classic battles from the Star Wars movies are available for play. It would have been great to fly the X-Wing into the Death Star's core to blow it up, or to play the TIE Interceptor chasing Wedge into the core. If a mission editor had been included, we could recreate historical Star Wars missions like the Death Star run in Return of the Jedi, but one isn't available and LucasArts has been traditionally hostile towards user-created mission editors. >>>Continued on pg 157 CGW JULY 1997 "

Each underlying system has its own implementation of the Java Virtual Machine, but since there's only one Java Virtual Machine specification, the Java platform acts as a standard, uniform programming interface to applets and applications on any hardware. -So-Java applets and applications can run in any lava TITEL S.3 "

As you might expect, this special new website can be found at http://www.station.sony.com. Highlights of The Station include: StationPass, a unique communications feature of The Station combining the best of technology and design. The Station Pass is The Station's webwide walkie-talkie, allowing for two-way communication through realtime messaging from passholders and announcements from The Station itself,  Personalized areas that include personal descriptions, favorite links, buddy lists of other users active on the site as well as account and billing information; CommStation, an area where users can access multiple communication features such as instant messages, electronic postcards, interactive threaded discussion groups and realtime chat; Station Search, an area where users can search for people, services, and products in The Station; and An extensive shopping network that allows multiple companies and brands to offer online customers an opportunity to buy goods ranging from books and CDs to promotional merchandising for entertainment offerings. our web browser has likely already led you to your first Java experience, since the Java Virtual Machine now resides on all major browsers. But Java computing hasn't stopped there. Remember: anywhere there's a Java Virtual Machine, Java applets and applications can be dynamically downloaded and run. That's why Sun Microsystems has made a Java development kit available for Windows95 and Windows-NT, MacOS 7.5 on PowerMacs and 68030 (25 MHz and faster) and 68040 Macs. IBM, meanwhile, has ported the Java Virtual Machine to Windows 3.1, OS/2, and AIX. And the Open Systems Foundation has ported Java to assorted UNIX platforms, while other ports are underway for Nextstep, the Amiga and possibly other platforms. JAVA COMPUTING IN SILICON BEHIND THE SCENES: A LEADING EDGE For development of its exciting new site, Sony turned to a leading provider of consumer-focused online solutions, Art Technology Group (ATG), which supplied Sony with commerce, advertising, user-profiling and communications capabilities from its Dynamo suite of Internet applications, and developed extensive network management and administration technology for the web-based online network. \"ATG has built for The Station a seamlessly integrated and entirely web-based entertainment service unlike any other on the web today,\" said Jeet Singh, ATG's chief executive officer. \"We integrated different Sony programs for music, game shows, soap operas and kids, as well as third-party content into a single, large-scale, consumer-driven service. Our approach was to design an online network that focuses on delivering a well-integrated, personalized user experience.\" All applications are created using the Dynamo Developer's Kit, a Java computing application development framework. But the Java computing arsenal goes way beyond that. Soon microprocessor versions of the Java platform will be incorporated into cellular phones, pagers, palmtops, even thermostats. And for good reason. By the end of the decade, the average home will contain between 50 and 100 microcontrollers. Java technology makes possible easy communication between all these devices. In fact, Java technology can help link the millions of cellular phones, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other Internet appliances operating in a networked environment and highly optimized for small applications running at top speed. Eventually, you'll be able to interact with these devices from your PC, Mac or laptop and it'll all be as simple as using your web browser. So promising is this new world of Java computing "

"Java driven online imaging Whether you're net surfing, doing in-depth research, creating Web pages or just contemplating splicing Aunt Harriet's head onto Uncle George's torso, you'll like what Photo CD can do and you'll like the price even more: Photo CD is free. ave you moved your photo opps onto your computer yet? There's never been a better time, thanks to Java computing. Kodak's Photo CD system is a powerful tool that provides complete online viewing, manipulation and storage capabilities for scanned 35mm photo images. Introduced in 1992 as a linchpin of Eastman Kodak's Digital Science product family, the Photo CD system delivers cost-effective, convenient, highquality imaging to desktops everywhere. Support for Photo CD images has been built into most leading operating systems, including Solaris from Sun Microsystems, and dozens of software applications, such as Adobe Photoshop and Pagemaker, QuarkXpress and many others. No wonder the Photo CD image file format called Image Pac — has quickly become a de facto computer industry standard. IMAGING IS SERIOUS FUN... Obviously, Photo CD on the Web can be a lot of fun for web enthusiasts. But there is another side to Photo CD on the Web, too: the technology itself is a huge leap forward in online imaging quality, offering a 24-bit graphics format and an advanced color management system. With that kind of capability Photo CD on the Web promises to be exceptionally useful for students, academicians and other serious researchers, giving them immediate access to important graphical information across the Internet. IN Already, such institutions as the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, the University of Pittsburgh, Oregon State University and the American Museum of Natural History are all currently demonstrating Photo CD on the Web technology in a production environment. PHOTO CD-AWARE WEB BROWSERS Now Kodak has unveiled a new Java application, called Photo CD on the Web, to make its imaging technology easily and universally accessible to users anywhere in the world. With Photo CD on your desktop browser, you can access, view and manipulate high-resolution images stored anywhere on the web. Because of Java's platform-independence, access is always seamless; it doesn't matter what kind of system the user has or where the image is stored. So every Java enabled web browser is also automatically Photo CD-aware, providing users with unparalleled imaging capabilities. DYNAMIC INTERACTION WITH ONLINE IMAGES Do you give away snapshots only to wish later that you still had them? Now you can share all your photos and keep them, too. And that's just for starters. Anyone with a Java enabled Web browser has immediate and transparent access to a vast array of high-resolution digital images from detailed pictures of the surface of Mars to the Smithsonian's collection of Native American artifacts. Using your web browser of choice, you can dynamically interact with online images like never before. Photo CD on the Web allows you to view, zoom, enlarge, crop and rotate any remote image in real time as long as that image was previously captured and stored in Kodak's Image Pac format The Image Pac format stores a photo image in five different levels of resolution, and you can view and manipulate every one of these levels on the web without losing image quality — which means you can create far more interesting and dynamic Web pages than were ever possible before. ...AND JAVA COMPUTING MAKES IT HAPPEN Java computing is ideally suited for the robust, distributed operation this kind of demanding application requires. As a user of Photo CD on the Web, you can download the content you select say, images or portions of images from a remote Internet server at a museum, university or elsewhere, and then execute the Java applet locally. Rather than downloading an entire five-megabyte Photo CD digital image, the program brings across only the five kilobytes of highresolution image data required for full operation. Result: performance that's extremely fast, responsive, and efficient. A BRIGHT FUTURE No matter what kind of system you have on your desk, odds are that Photo CD on the Web will be running there soon. And when Kodak issues a new version of this Java powered marvel, all you have to do is visit Kodak's web page and download your automatic update. It's hard to imagine software distribution getting any easier. The power and elegance of Java computing plus Kodak's technology-leading online imaging brightens the future for all of us.

Many other vendors are developing Java applets and applications that businesses will use to reach their customers — that's us, folks — via the Internet and dedicated corporate networks. One smaller financial organization that has gained competitively thanks to Java computing is the Heritage Bank & Trust Co. of Lafayette, Indiana. Over the past year, the bank's CEO accumulated several Java applets at little or no cost, downloading them from various applet sites on the web such as Gamelan. And he wrote applets of his own. Now Heritage Bank offers its customers access to a Java based mortgage payment calculator. An income qualification calculator uses a potential mortgage borrower's income and expense data to figure out the maximum prudent monthly mortgage and maximum loan amount. In theory, a Java applet can come from anywhere and be capable of attacking unprotected machines in ways that might not be stopped by traditional methods. That's why the Java platform protects its users by placing strict limits on applets to prevent potentially malicious applets from stealing information, spreading viruses or acting as viruscarrying Trojan horses. They cannot read from or write to your local disk. Standalone windows created by applets are clearly labeled as being owned by untrusted software. SECURITY The Java platform's security allows a user to import and run applets from the web without undue risk to the user's machine. The Java applet's actions are restricted to its \"sandbox,\" an area of the web browser or the Java Virtual Machine. The applet may do anything it wants within its sandbox, but cannot read or alter any data outside of its sandbox, allowing users to run untrusted code without compromising their trusted computing environments. If a user does accidentally import a hostile applet, the local machine will not be damaged. A SAFE SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT Java computing is secure All that Java computing security means that Java powered websites are a safe place to shop. More and more are appearing every day.

"REVIEW X-WING VS TIE FIGHTER >>>Continued from pg 144 IS THE FORCE WITH XVT? The game's enginc looks and plays like TIE FICHIER, with the addition of texture mapped graphics. One problem with the engine is scaling: Capital ships look too small, so you can easily misjudge the distance to a Star Destroyer and then get caught by its guns bcforc you rcalize you're too close. Graphically, the game looks good, with excellent lighting effects when the starfighters get hit. Cockpit graphics, on the other hand, are rather out of place with a drawn appearance that contrasts poorly with the detailed texture maps on the ships. Along with overall good control and graphics, Xvl' does have some great music, and can be customized. You can remap all the commands and create the perfect keyboard/joystick layout for your needs. The list of orders to give your wingmen, as well as the targeting options for hitting ship components, are good holdovers from previous Star Warssiins. If you just take the multiplayer action, from dogfights to co-op missions, X-WING VS TIE FICHTER is a four-star game. But its poor solo play doesn't rate much higher than two stars. What you end up with is a game with single-player missions that serve best as practice 3) VAS/NOTIVIONIS The Multiplayer Side of the Force or a game geared so strongly towards multiplayer action, X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER'S networking is a surprisingly mixed bag. Once you get up and running it performs well, but the restrictions on setup and number of players will annoy gamers experienced with more flexible network games. XVT's Internet play is handled through the Internet Gaming Zone (www.zone.com) Web site. The Zone provides chat rooms where you can easily find opponents with low latency numbers and then start a game with only a few clicks. No matter what time of day logged on to the Zone, I was able to find enough players to launch a mission almost immediately. As long as all the players showed up green on the latency meter, games were smooth, with almost no perceptible lag or warping, even when I hosted on a less-thanoptimal 26,400-bps connection. You'll need Microsoft's Internet Explorer to access the Zone-in typical Microsoft fashion, Netscape isn't supported. Because of the sheer amount of information being sent over the Net-locations of not only players and missiles, but also dozens of computer-controlled ships--the Zone limits you to four human players in order to keep performance up. By using Kali 1.10 or later, or by manually connecting to a host player's IP address and bypassing the Zone, you can play with more than four players. You'll probably only be able to play melees without computer-controlled ships, due to the amount of data being transmitted. Network connections easily support eight players; modem play, as you'd expect, is perfectly smooth. While there are few technical problems with the game's connectivity, there are certainly plenty of annoying design decisions. Perhaps the biggest irritation is the inability to join a game already in progress, even if there are player openings. If a player gets dropped from a game, he will be unable to rejoin unless all players leave the game and relaunch it. If dynamic entry were allowed, you could rejoin a lost connection, or other players could pop in to fill gaps in the team. Also, if you have trouble connecting to a game, the program sits for over two minutes before it times out. If you haven't connected in a minute or so, you're probably not going to, and an option to escape from the connection screen should be available. One nice feature is the ability to watch the battle from a tactical display on the observation deck-and even zoom in on specific ships and give them orders-once all your own ships have been destroyed. At least you'll have something to do if you die early on.-Denny Atkin DEATH AT TWELVE O'CLOCK In one of the better multiplayer missions, you and a small group of X-Wings have to take out a Star Destroyer for the real funthe >APPEAL: Gamers who always multiplayer missions. wanted to play TIE FIGHTER multiplayThe sad part is, I was er.

"*** REVIEW . F/A-18 HORNET 3.0 DIFFICULTY LEVEL Hornet Gets Some Buzz SUMMER 3)VDS/NOTIVIONIS Another Mac Flight Sim Launches a Successful Attack on the Windows 95 Market by Robin G. Kim IN THE GROOVE Carrier landings can be an interesting challenge, but the sim is too tolerant of errors-slamming into the middle of the deck will get you down just as well as a perfect approach to the three-wire trap. othing compares to the adrenaline rush of a catapult launch, or the sweatypalmed terror of guiding a multi-million dollar jet through total darkness toward a controlled crash on a tiny patch of moving real estate. Graphic Simulations Corporation obviously understood this appeal back when they created F/A-18 HORNET for the Macintosh. Version 3.0 lets PC owners in on the action for the first time, while advancing the Macintosh line through the introduction of rolling terrain, wingman commands, and other minor enhancements. Like most Mac flight sims, HORNET uses flat-shaded polygon graphics with no texture mapping. The result may not appear photorealistic, but the 3D objects still look great, and almost any Pentium system can achieve fast frame rates at resolutions from 640x480 to 1024x768. The sim trics hard to maintain this speed, actually slowing the passage of game time (sometimes down to IB normal) when the scene gets busy. In practice, this is barely noticeable, and probably less so than if it just allowed frame rate to pluminet. record and undertake a tour of duty. A tour consists of seven sorties of gradually increasing difficulty, each one offering four different missions from which to choose. The missions are basically canned (the results of one have no lingering effect on those that follow) but the randomized placement of enemy forces keeps things interesting over multiple replays. A wide enough range of difficulty settings is provided to suit players of any skill level. The F/A-18 is a true multi-role aircraft, and the diversity of missions in the sim accurately reflects this. Assignments range from air intercepts to escort duty to strikes against targets on land and sea. Unfortunately, the sim lacks any sort of mission planning. You can't even review your waypoints before taking off, much less change them. Also, most flights start you out very close to your objective, Though this is clearly unrealistic, the only direct consequences are less time spent in boring transits and a reduced need to conserve fuel. As a side benefit, the short flight times also make reviewing films, created using the game's excellent mission recorder, more entertaining. One or two wingmen accompany you on most flights, but they can only lend air-to-air support-ground pounding is strictly your department. The Al is Price: $45.00 Minimum System Requirements: Pentium, 8MB RAM, 35MB hard drive space, 2x CD-ROM, SVGA video, Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0.

"REVIEW . FIA-18 HORNET 3.0 SIMULATION/SPACE fairly good when it hasn't been intentionally cumbed clown for play balance, as is done on some missions. Your wingmen do have an annoying tendency to crash into the ground when ordered into formation at low altitudes, but this design fault can be avoided by simply not issuing them those particular commands. Acknowledgements and status reports are conveyed by cligitized speech with a staticky background that sounds much more realistic than the ultra-clean stuclio recordings heard in some other sims. Radio communications from ground control, the control tower, and the camers landing signal officer are also well done, substantially enhancing the feel of the sim. modes, 5 autopilot modes, and 140 key even a novice-albeit a highly motivated board commands, the cockpit is a nir onc up the steep learning curve. vana for fans of systems realism.

Up to four people can participate at once, dividing up into two teams of one or two players each. Computercontrolled aircraft aren't available, so you can't fly campaign missions with your friends, but the six multiplayer-only missions that are included offer a good variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground themes. The chat feature allows you to type messages to everyone or to just your wingman. Despite the low player limit and lack of campaign support, the multiplayer missions are entertaining enough to boost the sim's long-term play value greatly-as long as you can find people to fly against. Performance over the Internet is relatively good, so Kali and Kahn users should have little trouble finding opponents and teammates online. Unfortunately the PC version can't currently connect to the Macintosh version, so PC owners won't be able to join in on the dueling ladder that Macintosh players have already established.

"F/A-18 HORNET 3.0 . REVIEW demand absolute fidelity will be disappointed by HORNEI's shortcomings. But if you are the kind of person who is willing to cleave to the spirit of the sim rather than dwell on its deficiencies, you may find that all types of missions play out in a fun, challenging and realistic enough manner. For many sim players, that is perhaps what really matters & landings are especially well done, though no landing grades are given, and the sim is rather forgiving of mistakes. Regrettably, digging a little deeper uncovers many significant errors: Altitude has no effect on tum performance; plane handling is nearly unaffected by heavy ord nance loads; ground acceleration and deceleration is so overdone that it is possible to land on a carrier without using the hook and to take off without using the catapult; absurdly effective rudders make 9 flat turns possible at supersonic speeds; and fucl consumption on afterburner is about three times too high. with these seemingly damning flaws, it would be easy to write the sim off as a glorified arcade game. But unless getting the numbers right is more important to you than gameplay, this may not be entirely justified. It turns out that if you intentionally fly the plane in a realistic manner-as the designers obviously intended-most of the flight model's greatest failings are not readily apparent. Make no mistake: This sims flight and avionics inaccuracies definitely do distort reality, so those who VS/NOTIV 10WIS INFORMATION OVERLOAD Players used to flying a sim before reading the manual may find HORNET's realistic array of cockpit avionics a bit bewildering. not air modes) that can see through hills, and electro-optical sensors that are unable to detect ground vehicles except at ridiculously short ranges. APPEAL: Worshippers at the altar of high frame rates; sim veterans who enjoy complex systems models and can overlook failings in other areas. PROS: Outstanding avionics modeling; fluid flight model feel; good SVGA-graphics performance; excellent use of digitized speech; wide variety of mission types; smooth running multiplayer modes. CONS: Some major flaws in the flight modeling; limited number of missions and no mission builder; campaigns lack flow; wingmen occasionally go suicidal. SURFACE REALISM At first glance, HORNET appears to have an outstanding flight model. It has a pleasantly fluid, controllable feel that seems convincing over a broad range of airspeeds. Angle of attack is appropriately tied to lift, and energy bleeds off in a realistic fashion under heavy Cloads. Carrier RATED * GOLDEN GATE gean Forget about leaving your heart.

Mineral assets on asteroids agents to engage in theft and sabotage play out very quickly, and so your in alien asteroids. Missile attacks are money runs out just as fast. Instead of simply making the rocks in this game meatier, the designers introduced a tax return for every worker under your control, so while everything in the game tells you to create lean, ultra-efficient workforces, actual gameplay dictates that you build up large populations of personnel who do nothing but play video games and pay taxes. The endgame is also disappointing--you just get a generic spreadsheet marking all your accomplishments in the game, and there isn't even a saved high score feature to make a point of continued play. Perhaps a careful study of the endgame in Civ would have been a good idea before Interplay sent ALLEGIANCE out the door. And, in what is becoming a very disturbing trend in sci-fi strat titles lately, the manual with this game is sparse and inadequate. While it does cover the basic workings of the interface, it does very litt le to illuminate the actual mechanics and technical details of the game. Tliere is no way to tell the effect of various ship weapons, except to rely on the notion that the more expensive a weapon is, the more damage it must do. As unfortunate as these flaws are, FRAGILE ALLECIANCE is easily the most fun I've had at a spaceploitation game so far this year. The play is unique and infinitely variable, with a constantly shifting gameficld and tenacious Al opponents. Interplay has gone far in delivering a sci-fi strat game that actually takes the environment and mechanics of space into account, and they've produced a game that's smart as well as sexy. ALLEGIANCE stands well apart from the more generic fare populating games shelves this year. & APPEAL: Gamers who want a different kind of strategy game with some realistic space effects and a good economic model. PROS: Original, innovative gameplay and mechanics; detailed graphics; economics are as important as military strikes; effective AI. CONS: Cool economic angle is undermined by poor playbalance; barely adequate manual; lack of variable speed control; can't play as aliens. RATE CGW JULY 1997 "

This is prime material for wargaming, and if this controversial add-on pack gets banned in some overly-sensitive Eurochamber, then fine. SSI deserves a lot of credit for shaking things up; I hope this attitude will carry on to STEEL PANTHERS III. E T he original STEEL PANTHERS was a relevation, a great step up in realism from games like PANZER GENERAL, but with a simliarly accessible interface and crisp graphics. STEEL PANTHERS II was a very good game, but with a slightly worn luster. However, sales of STEEL II were brisk; this is, after all, a scqueldriven business. The surprise, then, is that CAMPAIGN Disk #1 is not your typical add-on pack, but an enhancement that supplies a needed spark to the STEEL PANTHERS franchise. Air strikes are better integrated, opportunity fire seems more realistic, and even the individual scenarios are better balanced than in the parent game. Some of the more than 30 battles, such as Grenada, are academic exercises, while others are little more than DUG IN WITH NOWHERE TO GO In Korea 1998, you don't have to wait long for the fireworks to begin.

Third, pick out the spot on which you want to touch down (or a landmark off to the side if the runway is obscured by your plane's nose) and strive to minimize its relative motion. If the spot moves up, you are descending too rapidly, so add power. If it moves down, reduce throttle because your glide slope is too shallow. 'The piston engines of most WWII lighters provide good throttle response, but jets often exhibit a noticeable lag between input and result, forcing you to think farther ahead.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: FLIGHT SCHOOL GAMER'S EDGE Angle of Attack Angle of Attack 15° 319 Direction of Motion ne of the most misunderstood aerodynamic concepts among novice sim pilots, angle of attack (AOA) is an important determinant of an aircraft's turning performance. AOA is the vertical angle between the direction an aircraft is pointing and the direction it is moving; it has nothing to do with a plane's pitch angle. The accompanying diagram of an aircraft descending to land illustrates this difference. Although its nose is pointed slightly above the horizon, it is nevertheless losing altitude (anyone who has watched airliners land at an airport will be familiar with this phenomenon). Its pitch angle is about 5 degrees, but its AOA is 15 degrees. If you rotated the picture a quarter-turn clockwise, the plane's pitch angle would become 95 degrees, but its AOA would still be 15 degrees. In normal flight, the pilot can increase AOA simply by pulling back on the stick. The lift an aircraft's wings generate, which can be used for turning as well as just staying up in the air, is roughly proportional to AOA at a given airspeed. That is why you hold the stick back to make high G turns. The greater the AOA, the more lift produced-to a point. Going beyond this point, increases in AOA result in huge reductions in lift and a boatload of drag. This is what it means for an aircraft to stall. Note that a stall occurs whenever you exceed the AOA at which lift is maximized, regardless of your airspeed. When this occurs at higher speeds it is called an \"accelerated stall,\" the onset of which can be sudden and violent. The way to maximize your rate of turn, then, is to ease up to the edge of a stall without stepping over. Finesse is the key. target was not destroyed, climb (the \"zoom\") so far away that the bandit cannot retaliate.

Fighting Styles Once you have mastered the rigors of routine flying, it is time to start thinking tactics. Though the number of possible air-to-air combat styles is practically infinite, it is useful to divide them into three basic categories: angles tactics, energy tactics, and \"boom & zoom.\" Which is most appropriate depends on the plane you are flying, your own proficiencies, and the circumstances of the engagement Angles tactics, the most intuitive of the three, favor the use of aggressive tums in a brute force attempt to gain the upper hand. This is generally the quickest way to get a kill when it works, and is the natural choice if your plane has a turn rate advantage. With energy tactics, the goal is not to out-turn the opponent, but to build up a sufficient energy advantage (in the form of airspeed or altitude, or bothi) to enable you to maneuver into firing position while the bandit lacks the cnergy to counter. This decisive energy advantage is achieved through aircraft superiority, more efficient flying technique, or, against an evenly matched opponent, by giving up angles. The prototypical end game involves pulling up into a zoom climb that the bandit cannot follow, then coming back down for the kill while he's slow and helpless. Successful use of energy tactics requires more skill, patience, and good judgement than angles tactics, but they are your best bet if you find yourself trapped in a dogfight against a more maneuverable plane. While there is some overlap between energy and angles tactics, \"boom & zoom\" is a whole different ballgame. Instead of fighting it out at close quarters, a boom & zoomer will typically make a diving firing pass (the \"boom\") from a large energy advantage and then, if the 252 Discworld II Scorpia Shows you the Way 256 Magic the Gathering All About Color Strategy 260 CG Tips!

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS: FLIGHT SCHOOL Figure 1 effective opening moves is the lead turn.\" A lead turn is simply a turn started before you pass your opponent. Figure 1 shows an offset headon pass where both pilots turn toward each other as they go by. Since they both do the same thing, neither gains any edge over the other. Now look at Figure 2, in which the fighter on top begins a lead turn before the other aircraft passes. By the time the second fighter begins to turn, it is already at a considerable disadvantage, The principal components of a successful lead turn are timing and flight path separation (the lateral offset between the two planes' flight paths, also known as \"turning room\"). If you turn too late, you won't gain enough angles to make much difference. If you turn too early, your opponent can slip in behind you. Flight path separation is not strictly necessary for a lead turn to be useful, but does allow you to turn in sooner and potentially grab a greater angular advantage. Even the most basic lead turn described above can prove devastating against someone who has never seen it used before. Unfortunately, it is pretty easy to counter: Just steer toward the bandit and minimize flight path separation. That will render any lead turn the bandit performs much less effective, but not totally worthless. One way to discourage this countermove is to do your lead turn straight up as shown in Figure 3. It works similarly to a level lead turn except that if the bandit wants to take away your flight path separation, he must commit to a steep dive (not shown), necessitating a lengthy, energy-consuming recovery afterwards. No Lead Turn Figure 2 Typical Lead Turn Figure 3 Corner Speed The most common mistake beginning sim pilots make is to hold the stick all the way back during a dogfight in a vain attempt to maintain a tight turn indefinitely--it just doesn't work that way. No fighter has so much power that it can sustain a maximum rate level turn without losing airspeed, and if airspeed decays too much, so does turn rate. Excessive speed will also impair a plane's turning ability. Between these two extremes is a sweet spot that optimizes turn performance at a given instant. This sweet spot is called an aircraft's «corner speed.\" -176: 174 -170: 129 196: 605 Climbing Lead Loop 200110 flies off, or the energy difference between the two planes shrinks enough that the attacker can no longer zoom away with impunity.

"GAMER'S EDGE Torque Effects ingle-engine prop planes have a strange tendency to yaw to one side at high power settings, especially at low speeds. For planes whose props rotate clockwise from the pilot's point of view (as most do), the effect manifests as a leftward pull on the nose that must be countered with right rudder. The cause FINAL APPROACH To avoid getting overly fixated on any one thing as you come in for a landing, it helps to cycle your attention continually between your plane's airspeed, sink rate, line-up, and glide slope. TWO PROPS ARE BETTER THAN ONE The P-38 Lightning's twin counter-rotating propellers almost perfectly cancel out each other's torque, P-factor, and slipstream effects, glving the plane exceptionally stable low-speed handling. of this uncommanded yaw is often referred to simply as \"torque.\" but it really results from three separate effects: engine torque, spiral airflow caused by the prop, and something called \"P-factor.\" If engine torque spins the propeller clockwise, an equal and opposite force will roll the fuselage counterclockwise, to the left. This does not produce any yaw per se, but by countering this roll with some right stick to keep the wings level, you increase the drag on the left wing relative to the right; that does cause a leftward yaw. A clockwise rotating prop will create, naturally enough, a clockwise rotating current of air behind it. This helical slipstream will hit the vertical stabilizer on the left side (but only at very low speeds), causing the tail to move right and the nose to move left. P-factor describes how one side of the prop disk will produce more thrust than the other at non-zero angles of attack (see the Angle of Attack sidebar). When AOA is positive, such as during takeoffs, landings, and tight turns, the right side of the prop disk is dominant, causing the nose to pull-you guessed it-to the left. All these effects are modeled to some degree in most recent prop sims. Usually, some right rudder is all that is required to keep the plane in line. Nevertheless, the yaw can actually become unmanageable if sufficient power is applied at a low enough airspeed, so it is best to avoid such conditions. The maximum lift a plane's wings can produce rises rapidly with increasing airspeed--the faster you go, the more Gs you can pull and the quicker you can turn. Eventually, the number of Gs available reaches the structural limit of the airframe. Beyond this speed, it is not practical to take advantage of the extra lift because any additional Cs could cause the wings to snap off, possibly ruining your whole day. The lowest speed at which a plane can generate its structural maximum load is its corner speed (the name comes from the a sharp peak, or corner, that appears at that speed when graphing maximum turn rate versus airspeed). A plane may have its highest instantaneous turn rate potential when flying at corner speed, but if this entire potential is constantly exploited, airspeed will inevitably drop off (unless executing a diving turn, but you can only dive so low). If you expect a prolonged turning fight, it is therefore a bad idea to use all the turning ability you have unless you are going for the kill, or if your life depends on it. For such engagements, you will want to fly nearer the speed that offers the highest turn rate that can be sustained in level flight with no deceleration. This speed is typically below corner speed for WWII fighters and above it for modern jets. Mission Debriefing Air combat tactics are an extremely complex topic. The concepts and techniques explained here barely scratch its surface, but they should give you something to think about as you develop your own fighting style. (For an authoritative book-length treatment of the subject, I highly recommend Robert Shaw's Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering.) Although several of the lessons covered in this article apply to jets as well as WWII prop fighters, be sure to check back in next month's CGW for the final part of this series, which will give details specific to modern air combat.

Don't sweat the multiple creepers on your way to rescue Skeeter, because with a two-minute time limit, you've got to move. Cet the speed up and hang a right on Oil Well Road. Speaking of oil, lay plenty of it behind you and your pursuers won't be a problem. With a killer chasm off to the left and very little shoulder, drive fast, but take care through any hard rights. Oh yeah, negotiating that monster jump just before Fisher's Field will require the judicious use of nitro. Scene 7 THE KEYSTONE BRIGADE In Scene 7, there's a bunch of cops on the take who are trying their best to box you in between impenetrable roadblocks, but here's a plan. Just past the first roadblock, make a quick right on Bauxite Il Road and drive until you see a brown barn off to your right. Drop a load of bloxdroppers around the perimeter of the barn, because you'll be leading a fuzz, parade back here later, Back out on the highway, travel down to where you're just in sight of the waiting cruisers.

Since it's dark, it's a good idea to drive slowly through each segment to gauge the distance to the next ramp, then turn around and come back at full speed. If you do miss the third jump and plunge down into the chasm, you can still get to the station by following the directional arrows on the barriers, then cutting through the desert. At the station, you'll get two swarms of creepers. You'll want to kill 'em quick before they destroy the station, but you'll get some limited assistance from Inferno, an ally with a flame thrower and somewhat shoddy marksmanship. Don't be afraid to chase each bad guy down. It works because they don't have much in the way of rear-mounted weapons, and because others won't take the opportunity to attack while you're S USTAFAKE 9990 E V OTNOUS CXbe cons PRND 2.1 GESTRECHO 9000 HIDE OUT In Scene 7 hide in the barn on Bauxite Road.

For example, Scene 6 sees Groove hurtling several knocked out bridges, and the only way you can tell if it's a bridge or just a hill is to check your satellite view Off-roading isn't as damaging or as difficult as the manual would lead you to believe, and cutting corners where the terrain is flat is advised. > Look around for alternatives to the suggested routes—even Taurus can be wrong sometimes  Get yourself a multi-button stick. Using the period and comma keys to change gears is not fun. Learn the fine art of driving at the Burnetti racetrack. Run this mission over and over again to become a boss Piranha pilot. Salvage bigger and better performance parts whenever you can, but let Skeeter repair anything highlighted in yellow or red before you use it. Because they improve cornering and road grip over bumps, suspension upgrades should be considered a priority, as should fatter tires. SATELLITE TV Here is an overhead perspective of Fort Smith, using the blimp view to locate a tank. This view makes it easy to locate enemies and spot the terrain for bridges and chasms. Scene 10 ROADBLOCKS RUS range Aim-Nein missile hits before they scramble. Now, lead them back down the highway, discharging the rest of your bloxdroppers en route When you get back to the barn, drive inside it. There's enough room to turn around inside, and since the cops can't get at you while you're in there, you can take pot shots at them as they drive by. With a little luck, some will drive over those bloxdroppers you laid earlier. After awhile, the helicopter they've called in will vacate and you can drive out, finishing the job. Taking out a fourth car will persuade them to remove a roadblock and let you pass. ore bad cops, more roadblocks. Quickly head straight toward the assembled throng (use a nitro), then veer slightly to the left just past the final side road. This will put you on the cliff just above and to the left of the roadblock. Drive just past it and drop back down to the roadway before the height gets too severe. Wien approaching from the rear, the cops put up a curiously weak fight while you're able to pound them with turrets or mortars. One or two may sneak up the cliff and get close, but if you monitor the satellite view you'll know before they get there.

Then nail the gray Cavera and don't let either get to the warehouse, which stands just south on highway 214. The key here is to bait the rest of the creepers and lead them away from the warehouse. Scene 11 A BRIDGE TOO FAR here's no way to stop the creepers from taking out both obvious bridges, but a third awaits.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: INTERSTATE \"76 GAMER'S EDGE The Good: Linked Machine Guns: Bar none, the best thing you can do for your hitting power throughout the game. Oil Slick Dropper: Often it'll simply delay the inevitable, but in missions where screaming past the bad guys is advisable, it is very useful. Turrets: Will follow target even if you're facing another direction and are great for helicopters, Cherub Missile: A rare beast but stupendously fatal. Use from long distance only. Just past the bridge is a relatively gentle upgrade, one you can use to get up to the bridge. You'll encounter lots of bigtime firepower, but it's way better to forsake the shooting gallery routine in favor of a little nitro Just keep following the road and you'll hit the highway where you hang a left to meet up with Taurus once again. GROOVE TO THESE MOVES Mounting a turret on your roof is a good idea, because it will track your targets. The Bad Cannons: They pack a punch but don't have nearly as many rounds as machine guns and feel and look a bit odd when being tired. Mortars: Effective only when blasting a static target, and static targets can be hard to find. Specials: Aside from repeated nitro applications, I didn't use a one. I mean, a cup holder? The Ugly Handgun: Great for eliminating a driver while leaving his or her vehicle unscathed. But mastering the pistol can be quite difficult, and you can easily muddle your way through Without ever using it. Flamethrowers: Tum virtually anything into a crispy critter, but you've got to be really close, Car-E-Racer: Does what it says, but a brand new one has just five applications.

Take out the helicopter, the rather lame creepers that follow, and then begin shooting the buildings.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: INTERSTATE \"76 GAMER'S EDGE MANTA RAID Malochio drives a Manta like this (albeit of green color). It's got plenty of hard points, good speed, and armor, so select the Armored car for this showdown and use a cherub missile to cripple him from afar. As exemplified by Scenes 6 and 8, it's always smart to deal with creepers individually rather than en masse-they're often more interested in qunning you down than accomplishing their primary goal. Monitor your radar constantly and respond to it early. There are a few missions where an overwhelming number of evil-doers will force you to run rather than fight, but if you must fight, get involved quickly. > Ramming a creeper, then blasting him before he gets his wits together is often quite effective. Perfect the art of the bootleg turn. Your \"Z\" key is the emergency brake and using it while slamming the wheel to either side will immediately spin you around. Much quicker than traditional turning and a great aid for in-close dogfighting > With a pair of linked machine guns you're rarely out of ammo.

Strategy/Wargames Admiral Sea Battles W hile this game can be fun, its lack of realism makes PANZER GENERAL look like Wacht Am Rhein by comparison. Your best bet is to unleam anything you know concerning real naval tactics. For example, the best defense to prevent the enemy from capturing your ships is to keep them in pairs. Only two ships will fit in a square, and if both vessels in that square are yours, then no enemy can enter or board. Wonder what Nelson would have thought? But 7th Levels helicopter-based action shooter is a good time if you are into fastpaced, mindless fun. To that end, here are some cheat codes to help you through the crime wave. Type these cheats in at any time during gameplay: lironman Makes you invincible. Istagewin Automatically completes current mission. Red Alert fyou've played RED ALERT online, you've likely fallen prey to the infamous Soviet Tank Rush. Since the designers wanted to avoid snall-arms fire being able to take out armor (as in C&C), building infantry isn't much help. Also, since the design prizes mobility, simply going on the passive defense doesn't help. What you have to do, to paraphrase Gen. CGW JULY 1997 "


"TIPS! Simulation Space Sports QSoccer iM1A2 Abrams  Advance to contact in a wedge. This gives you flank protection as well as a good forward field of fire. Go into echelon toward known threats, and employ line formations only for defense.  Infantry will deploy when their carriers halt and will only move with carriers. Make them your backstop forces.  Know your vehicles; read the data charts. The best American AA weapons, other than special units, are APCs with Stingers, so use them against those enemy Hinds.  If you stop when ordered to, you may incur a victory point penalty, despite what your communications data says. Make sure to play missions to the very end.  While it might seem obvious, use terrain to your advantage. Above all, trust your gunner. Don't play Davy Crockett when commanding a platoon or company. Rocket artillery is devastating but takes longer to re-load. Use mortars and 155s for cautious, slow advances and defense. Jim Cobb COT Puzzles/Classics Marble Drop If you find you're spending all your hardI earned points buying back marbles in Maxis' MARBLE Drop, here's one way to get your bank balance back up. On certain puzzles, such as 15 Democratis, if you quickly drop a bunch of marbles one after the other into all the available funnels, pretty soon they'll start bouncing around in perpetual motion. Every time a marble hits the crossbow you gain ten points. We left the program running for a while and returned to a score of 50,000 points. You'll want to Dince there's currently no kick-ass soccer game on the market (both FIFA and MICROSOFT SOCCER leave a lot to be desired), why don't you try a kick-head soccer game instead? A group of deranged folks who go by the name of Qsports have come up with a free QUAKE add-on called QSOCCER that lets you play the world's most popular sport with a whole new twist: You kick a severed head instead of a soccer ball. Though this sounds like more of a gimmick than a game, the multiplayer matches can be awesome fun (though we wish you took damage hits for shin kicks). Be on the lookout for Version 4, which promises to add a working referee to the match. One question: will we get to kill him? You can find QSOCCER at www. planetquake.com/qcalas. reset that particular puzzle in order to solve it, but when you do, your newly acquired high score will remain intact. of approach to your base, and smother the lead tanks of your opponents formation with overwhelming fire. You don't have to worry about the angles of your shots, because RED ALERT (unlike say, STEEL PANTHERS) doesn't model front/side/rear armor differences. If your enemy stubbomly persists in futile attempts to punch through your defenses, you'll have time to scout around for his base. there's been an upsurge of interest in this Hall of Fame title. If you're having trouble winning at the higher levels of difficulty, check out the unofficial X-Com Web site at www.franken.de/users/speedy/hakan/ hobbies/daddel/xcom/Welcome-e.html. It's worth typing this ridiculously long URL to get the easy-to-use utilities, which include editors for weapons, soldier and base stats, UFO pedia, and even alien containment. James Longstreet, is to make the enemy fight on grounds of your choosing-casier said than done, of course.

"TIPS! COMBAT AIR SUMMER Simulation/Space FIA-18 Hornet 3.0 raphic Simulations' F/A-18 HORNET 3.0 is a fun sim, but it limits U you to flying just one of the 15 planes it simulates. That is, unless you know the insider codes used by the programmers for debugging the game's missions. Simply type the codes listed below in the pilot callsign field in the following format: fly:PLANE-##, where PLANE is the aircraft code and ## is the aircraft ID for that mission. Please note that you cannot fly helicopters using this feature, and that the codes only work in specific missions. Also keep in mind that these codes are designed for the release version of the game, not the demo version. Because this feature was designed for debugging purposes, you'll find that some planes exhibit quirky behaviors. For example, if you engage the autopilot, the computer will take control of the plane. Also, the plane may occasionally take control itself. And aircraft may no longer taxi on their own, even with autopilot on. This Easter egg is not officially supported by GSC, and they kindly request you don't bother tech support with problems about flying the B-52.

But when asked to create a beloved of the genre, but its roots CARTELS clone for EA, Dani Berry (then Dan are humble indeed. Jon van Bunten) decided-luckily for gamers-to Canegham, a self-taught programmer and RPG throw away the template. Bunten created an environment fan who had never made a game before, took upon himself where four players would try to explore and colonize another planet the task of creating an RPG that would stand up to the giants of the day, using a M.U.L.E., the robotic \"mule\" that enables you to farm, mine, the ULTIMA and WIZARDRY games. He did it almost all himself-the story, transport equipment, and perform any other function you wish to perthe programming, the computer graphics, the manual-and the result form on the planet's surface. was an epic RPG that more than accomplished his ambitious goal.

Also present in van Canegham's first game are lessly drive all other players out of business -sort of Monopoly meets the foundations of the series' enduringly engaging combat and spell sys Dark Side of the Moon. The game contains no bombs, guns, or missiles. tems, as well as an emphasis on exploration and plot advancement (in It just offers an exciting game of cutthroat competition complete with live. addition to the usual hack.'n'-slash) that became a hallmark of all MIGHT auction action that actually makes economics fun.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what wot, ME man und 13. What's the Deal with... Sick Ads? this column from is the one where the biggest threat to young adults are other young adults, and every legisla tor on the planet who can't think of anything useful to do is looking to find an easy goat to blame, and to pass yet another dumb-ass law to fix things riginally, this was going to be a sequel to last year's \"Dumb Ads\" column: another witty little rant pointing out which companies really need a slap in the PR department, and perhaps a little musing about how ad proposal meetings must be going much better with coke-they must be because I can't imagine how else a group of adults decides that using the word \"douche-bag\" is a Clever and hip idea. And then I stumbled across this little gem from the kids at Kali, and everything just tumbled into place. My whole disgust and loathing over the endless violence-and-gore ads Crystallized when I read their ad and realized that poor taste could be the least of our problems. \"In prison interviews, psychopaths often speak of the incredible power that comes from killing another human being. You're a lot closer to being interviewed than you'd like people to know.\" Now Kali is a cool net gaming service, and I am sure everyone working there is very hipper-than-thou, but really have to ask them one question: What the hell were you people thinking when you OK'd this vile piece of tripe? Are we living in the same dimension here? Because the one I am writing Il can't imagine how a group of adults decides that using the word 'douchebag' is a clever idea 2 Thate to break it to anyone, but computer gaming is still out on the fringe of societyand when push comes to shove, we aren't any safer than lesbian volleyball players or communist Boy Scout leaders when the crypto-fascists with an agenda come looking for somebody to blame for the \"dire state of today's youth.\" Nobody is going to bother with subtleties like dead-end poverty and societal contradictions when some guy can stand up and say, \"Lookee here Bubba, this ad says it'll make kids into psycho-killers...somebody ought ta do something about this!\" Do you think that way back in 1980, when Tommy Hanks was getting work portraying a crazed college Dungeon Master on TV, and every reverend on the tube was burning AD&D manuals, that TSR would have been real smart to run full-page ads to the effect of, \"Hey adolescents! We know what you REALLY want to do is slab people in the back and steal their gold, worship Pagan gods, dabble in dark, violent sorcery, and have tons of sex with over-endowed people in fur underwear! Buy a D&D starter set and you could do all this and more!\"? Money-crazed Internet entrepreneurs may think the past can't touch them, but all you have to do is look at the ratings on computer game boxes to realize how easily our hobby can be clubbed by the misinformed. Given the current state of politics, a retarded hamster could walk into Congress with the Kali ad, that delightful Re LOADED campaign, and a few pics of guys lying around in bathtubs of blood, and our little hobby would be regulated back to PONG. While wouldn't mind the eradication of a few brainless shooters, I am not so stupid as to think that it wouldn't take only a few more days before strat games using nukes and flight sims where you can fly German or Russian aircraft were found \"inappropriate.\" If you think I am being hysterical, or just not getting the joke,\" go down to the library, check out a little paranoid gem called Seduction of the Innocent, and look up the artistic horror that was the Comics Code Authority Seal. It's part of evolution that computer gaming has to be put at risk by the MORTAL KOMBATS and the NIGHT TRAPS, but we shouldn't have to be put in danger of being legislated to a level of morality that would bore an 8-yearold, just because some idiots have decided that violence is all that sells games. And if companies can't sense the chill in the air, then perhaps magazines, CGW included, should have the guts to see further than the power of the Almighty Buck and start sending a few ads (and checks) back with a little note saying, \"get a grip and try again.\" After all, there won't be much left for anybody if we have to try to fill gaming magazines with 10-page strategy guides for the Tipper Goreapproved LEMMINGS 27.& T Regardless of how tasteless and just plain stupid that kind of \"serial killer chic\" ad copy is, isn't anybody paying attention to the news? Do these people, who think crap like this will sell games (or online time, as the case may be here), have some sort of brain-damage that keeps current political events from sinking in? Are they unclear on the fact that people out there are so desperate for easy answers (and easy targets), that you can't find a political being anywhere willing to stand up and say the V-Chip is the worst idea since plutonium?
