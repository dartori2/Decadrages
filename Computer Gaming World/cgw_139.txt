"CREDITS Thell CoinputerGame Magazine CG 139 FEBRUARY 1996 PUBLISHER Jonathan Lane Editor-in-Chief Johnny Wilson has been a fixture in the computer gaming industry longer than most PC gaming maga. zines have been in print. The grand (grandiose?) old man at Computer Gaming World has written for the magazine since 1982, joined the editorial staff in 1986 and authored more than 300 reviews during his reign of terror. He has also written the SimCity Planning Commission Handbook and the SimEarth Bible, as well as co-authored Sid Meier's Civilization or Rome on 640K a Day (with Alan Emrich) and The SimCity 2000 Planning Commission Handbook (with Peter Spear). Although Johnny has a Ph.D. in Old Testament Studies, has been named to Who's Who in the West, and won the SPA's Best Software Reviewer award in 1991, he is much stuffier than that.

CG's Adventure Games Contributing Editor has been an avid gamer since purchasing her first computer, an Apple II+, back in 1981. In 1982, she co-founded the original GameSiG on CompuServe, where publisher Russell Sipe asked her to write for this magazine (which, up to that time, she'd never heard of). Thus began the Scorpion's Tale in 1983, and the rest, as they say, is her. story. She is arguably the most experienced, most outspoken critic of unimaginative or sloppy adventure game design, and though game publishers often fear her reviews, her loyal audience wouldn't have her any other way. Aside from her monthly columns here, Scorpia can also be found online on Genie, Delphi, and AOL.

"FAQ torical conflicts from a command perspective. They may be tactical, operational, or strategic, and stress anything from logistics and firepow. e r to morale and leadership. They may be simple (PANZER GENERAL, EMPIRE II) to incredibly detailed and complex (PACIFIC WAR). How Do We Classify Games? Action/Arcade (AC): The emphasis is on hand-eye coordina tion and reflexes, usually emphasizing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure (AD): Games where in you control an alter ego and move through a storyline or sequence of events, where puzzle solving takes precedence over con versation and combat. Classics/Puzzles (CP): Classics are old stand-bys and parlor games that appeal to many different types of gamer. Examples are: BACKGAMMON, Bridge, chess, MONOPOLY, PARCHESI, Risk, and SOLITAIRE. Puzzle games are computer games which emphasize spa tial relationships, word games and/or problem-solving without requiring gamers to follow a story line. Examples would be: Shanghai, TETRIS and ZIG-ZAG. Role Playing (RP): RPGs are a subset of adventure games, but stress character development, often through improving stats or other attributes. Conversations with nonplayer characters (NPCs) and tacti cal combat are generally more important than in Adventure games. Finally, the game world tends to be large, and the plot less linear, often with some quests/treks removed from the main storyline. Simulations (SI): Highly realis: tic games from a first-person per spective: you may drive a realistically simulated race car, fly a military aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed sci-fi environment. Usually polygon-filled technology is used to build the simulated world on the fly. Sports (SP): The sports game category is a broad genre which includes action (NBA Live) and strategy games (Front Page Football Pro) based on sports. Strategy (ST): Problem-solving, short and long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X-COM, OUTPOST, MOO). as well as \"pure\" strategy games and \"software toys\" such as SIMCITY. Wargames (WG): A subset of strategy games, these recreate his What Is Your Reviews Policy? 1) We only review from the final copy of the game. Though it has become popular among PC gaming magazines to review from late beta copies, we feel that the reader is best served by having the reviewer look at the same copy of a game that the readers will find on the shelves. While we recognize that this causes some delay in coverage, we believe the reader is better served by such caution. 2) We expect our reviewers to finish the game. We want our readers to be assured that we do not review based on immediate or early impressions of a game. Our reviewers give a game ample opportunity to show its quality. In some cases, bugs make it impossible to finish a game, but we identify situations where that has occurred. 3) We make every effort to match the reviewer to the game. We take into consideration the preferences, background and possible biases of the reviewer and, where possible, we find people with actual life experience or special backgrounds which match a game. We believe this policy enhances both the credibility of the review and the enjoy. ment of gameplay when the real world and the game world are competently compared 4) We do not accept free travel from software or hardware companies. We believe such gifts have a tacit assumption of coverage attached to them. We will only cover such events/launches as we believe will benefit our readers. HOW DO WE RATE? We only review finished product, not pre-release versions. The ratings are as follows: DIT Outstanding: The rare game that gets it all right. The graphics, sound, and gameplay come together to form a Transcendent Gaming Experience. Our strongest buying recommendation Very Good: A high-quality game that succeeds in many areas. May have minor prob lems, but is still worth your time and money, espe cially if you're interested in the subject matter or genre. Average: A mixed Weak: A game bag. Can be a with serious prob game that reaches lems. Usually for the stars, but buggy, seriously falls short in signifi. lacking in play cant areas. Can value, or just a also be a game that poorly-conceived does what it does game design-and well, but lacks flair 1 you will want to or originality. think long and hard before buying it Abysmal: The rare game that gets it all wrong.

"JOHNNY WILSON Litouri Show And Tell Today's Gamers Need More Than Pretty Pictures From Games And Magazines To this end, we've redesigned Computer Gaming World to help you get what you need even faster. Here's what's new. First, we've redesigned our logo to key on emember the \"Show and Tell\" experience in ele. mentary school? really hated it-it was boring to watch other kids show toys, pictures and souvenirs that couldn't handle or use. \"What's the use?\" I'd say. \"I'll never get one of those.\" Immature? You bet! Short sighted? Of course! Yet, my childish reaction to elementary school's \"Show and Tell\" underscores an important truth about human nature: we only want to pay atten. tion to what we believe is going to affect us. We don't just want to be talked to; we want to do something. You've read my complaints in this column about what I call multimediocre products. They're multi mediocre because the sole level of interactivity often seems to be pointing and clicking between pic. tures, text blocks, video clips and music/voiceovers. You don't feel like you've accomplished anything and there doesn't seem to be an imme. diate way to put what you've found to use. It's just \"Show and Tell.\" Even some computer games have such a low interactive component that you might as well be watching a movie for all the mental stimulation you gain or feeling of accomplishment you achieve. They might as well be \"Show and Tell.\" Right now, people like Larry Ellison of Oracle Corporation are dreaming of a $500 Internet box. They seem to have overlooked the past. Philips' CD-I, Commodore's CDTV, Tandy's VIS and even Trip Hawkins' 3D0 Multiplayer were all supposed to be powerful processing machines at a consumer price point, designed to provide positive computing experiences for the masses. Yet, they all missed the point about computing. Computing is about letting the user/gamer/player make what he or she wants. Word processing? Playing with words until you get something you want. Spreadsheets? Playing with numbers until you get the results you want. Databases? Playing with data until you find the cut you want. Games? Playing with problems and situations until you can get the result you want,VICTORY. What good will an Internet box do if: you can't print out the recipes you find, store the sound files you download, or play with the data you find? Not much! It's \"Show and Tell!\" You give the public a choice of things to look at, but it's still mostly looking-not using. The same thing can be true of magazines. We know you don't read our magazine just to read what we think about a game. You want the rumors, news, facts and informed judgment in a package that helps you find out if a given game is for you. We also know you don't read our magazine just to lust after pic. tures and text about the latest com puting equipment for gamers. You want to find the right equipment solution for your individual needs. We know you want help in winning games, getting extra value from the games you have, and overcoming bugs in games. Anything less is just \"Show and Tell!\" ( We've redesigned Computer Gaming World to help you find what you need even faster. 22 software publishers than to computer gamers. Second, you sometimes had trouble finding what you were buying the magazine to getresults. Results like purchase recommendations, strategy tips, news and rumors, and, of course, ways to get extra value from games you've already purchased. The old logo looked like our old philosophy. Under the World emphasis, we tried to be so comprehensive that you often had to wade through long blocks of text to find the hint, tip or rumor you needed. Our old logo was a big block of text. Under the World emphasis, the pages have often looked rather flat and lifeless because all of the action was in the text. Our new logo looks active and bold. It speaks of action. That's why, whenever you see references or graphics which focus on Computer Gaming or CG rather than the more familiar Computer Gaming World, you'll know it's part of our concerted effort to provide action-results. So, when you see CG-ROM, you'll know we've provided some. thing you can do on our CD. We're offering files to test games, fix what's most important-Computer Gaming. We originally called our selves Computer Gaming World because we believed it conveyed the fact that we try to cover the entire spectrum of computer games-design, production, evaluation and participation. This had two disadvantages. First, we sometimes found ourselves writing more to the 20 CG FEBRUARY 1996 "

There are demos to play, but there is much, much more. We're also pleased that subscribers can now order the magazine with the CD-ROM instead of having to find a newsstand copy or borrow it from a friend. When you see CG-ONLINE, you'll know that we're either providing something active on one of our electronic editions or have found something very cool on someone else's. CGONLINE tells you that you can download something you can use, find additional information, or interact with us on-line. As part of the results-oriented theme of the new look, we've added several new elements to the reviews. You'll find a difficulty scale that tells you at a glance how difficult it is to learn and play that game. The familiar 5-star ratings system and Pros/Cons hasn't changed, but we've added an \"Appeal\" line to the ratings box to suggest what kinds of gamers might like a given product. If a game is so good that it deserves a 4.5 or 5-star rating, you'll see a CG CHOICE graphic, which tells you it's one of the best games we've played all year, either technologically, creatively, com petitively or all three. Many readers have commented in the past 18 months that they like the color-coded \"home section for different game genres. So we've expanded the format to include new home sections: Classics/Puzzles (so that Bridge, Poker, Monopoly, Tetris and Shanghai players don't have to look through the Strategy/Wargaming section to find their types of games) and Technology to keep you abreast of new hardware and rapidly emerg. ing technology). We've also added CG TIPS to the columns which open each home section. This is in response to your continuing requests for more strategy tips. The CG TIPS are technology or gameplay tips that tell you how to beat games in that genre. You want earlier looks at games? We've turned the Pipeline into a Game Track which includes: Sightings (early screenshots and information on upcoming games). Pipeline (the publishers' release schedules), and Hands On (our first experiences with preliminary working code). Another change you may notice this month is that We've re-classified science fictionstyle simulations. In the past, we felt that games which do not attempt to model real-world vehicles couldn't be labeled \"Simulation.\" However, some of these games have become so detailed and realistic that it became impossible to consider them just \"Action\" games. As a result, you will now find realistic first-person simulation games like MechWarrior 2, Wing Commander 3 and Tie Fighter reviewed in the Simulations section rather than the Action section. Of course, the re-classification of this genre is carried through into the Top 100 games index, where you will find both kinds of simulation combined. The reclassification fits better with what the wider gaming market con. siders to be a sim as opposed to an unrealistic, fast-paced action game. Most of all, we're excited that we can present this useful new look with. out losing one word of text from the traditional CGW layout. We tested it with old articles in the new layouts and came to one conclusion: our graphic artists are geniuses. Here's to all who helped in the new design-artists, editors and contributors.

"LETTERS COMPUTER 100 Games Rated! GAMING WORLD LETTER OF THE MONTH Hero Software's Champions im amazed each month by the increasing size of every new CCW that graces my mailbox. This phenomenon is not due to increased ads either, there are more reviews and features in every issue! Hats off to CCW! Imagine, though, the shock I felt at seeing the December issue on the newsstand with a WING COMMANDER IV CD-ROM demo which my mailed copy was lacking! How can I get hold of that demo CD short of buying another isstie of the greatest magazine in the world? Also, who thinks up the catchy article titles? They're always a laugh. Andrew Vane Green Village, The staff's pride in being able to produce a December issue 100 pages larger than the closest competitor was tempered by the knowledge that subscribers wouldn't be able to get the demo disk. There is a chance you may be able to obtain one by calling our subscription number. (303) 665-8930. Going fonvard, subscribers now have the option to receive the CGROM with your magazine, at a slight additional cost. If you would like to get the disc, call the number above. As for those catchy titles, we have to suy its either The Rumor Guy, Headline Elves or the night janitor making changes after hours. We don't want those truly responsible to take the blame for their sometimes egregious punmanship Brooks to discuss the game concept and his idea of how a computer game based on his novels should look, and we contimied to provide updates to Mr. Brooks and his Random House editor, Owen Locke, during the course of development. Other than that, the work is completely ours. Lori and I read and enjoy CGW cach month, and we really appreciate the efforts your authors and editors make to lift game developers from obscurity. We sometimes wonder if the continual 80-hour weeks and stress of trying to make Christmas deadlines are worth it, and secing our names in CCW's reviews and previews helps us remember why we are in this businessbecause we care about our games and giving players the best we can make. Corey Cole Oakhurst, CA SINS OF SHANNARA Lori and I were very pleased to see our new Legend Entertainment game, SHANNARA, listed as #5 of the Top 10 adventure games in the \"Holiday Hot 100\" section of CGW #137. Unfortunately, the writeup has one major factual error which I hope you can correct in an upcoming issue: SHANNARA is a completely origSorry about the confusion. We interviewed Terry Brooks, creator of the Shannara novels, in the prior month, which made some editors assume that he authored the game. So they referred to a Terry Brooks design in the Hot 100 article. We had actually interviewed Brooks to get background on the creation of the SHANNARA DOVels, and Brooks had observed that he would control the content of the novels and let others (ie. Legend and the Coles) control the creation of the games. So SHANNARA is a game based on the Terry Brooks universe, but the game was written and designed by Corey and Lori Cole of QUEST FOR GLORY fame. what happened to it. I heard it got out to Beta Testing, but I never heard about any builds or anything about it. Hero Software has been non-responsive to my letters, so I was hoping you could answer my questions: D) What happened to the CHAMPIONS CRPC? Why didn't it ever come out when they were so close to finishing? Why did they resign themselves to just publishing (the) HEROMAKER (character generution software? 2) Do you happen to have the Beta version or possibly one of the builds for CHAMPIONS? If so, could I have a copy? I am a big fan and I just need to see the game to try it out. I'm a bit of a programmer. I know Visual Basic and C++ and a friend of mine and I want to build our own game. That is not why I want the CHAMPIONS CRPG (Computer Role-Playing Came), though, I just want to know what I missed (or didn't miss, whatever the case may be). 3) What's up with INDESTRUCTIBLES, the hero game that is supposed to come out from Bulfrog? Is it going to be a role-playing type or just a Rock'em/Sock'em game? Mark G. Roberts Kennewick, WA Lori & Corey Cole CHAMPION CHARLIE BROWN This may seem a little old, but I can't seem to get any answers any. where else.

"LETTERS ically picked up interesting games in the DOS or Macintosh markets like LINKS 386 PRO and TONY LARUSSA 2 and ported them to the Windows environment as MICROSOFT GOLF, MICROSOFT BASEBALL, etc.. C TONIK 110% Why do you use stars for your reviews instead of percentages? David Tune Orlando, FL The mag is great! But the stars for ratings kinda' bite! Stars and percentages would be nice. C.S. Luken Evanston, IL principals at Hero Software decided that the game was too outdated to finish and bring to market. This was a sad decision, since the entire company was formed from people who loved the people and paper\" role-playing game and had sunk their mortgages und royalty money from other projects into working for years without salary and trying to make this game happen. We have heard several reasons for this. To name a few: 1) the paper game's exception-driven rules system led to programming nightmares; 2) the paper modules which the scriptwriter intended to plug into the game didn't low as neatly as expected; 3) the principals were out of money and patience; and 4) the \"dated\" look related to the project taking so long caused several potential distributors to pass on picking up the product. Regardless of which reuson or combination thereof might be most valid, no one is currently at work on the CRPG. That's why you can't get hold of anyone at Hero Software. As for the beta, there naer was one. Our 92 cover story was based upon one module that had been converted to the computer and we played through that in pieces. At that time, it looked like the game would come together very quickly. Unfortunately, it didn't. We no longer hene even that one module, but we couldn't give it to you if we did. It would still belong to the principals of Hero Software: VEROMAKER was an attempt to get some revenue out of the character creation utility that had already been programmed for the game. THE INDESTRUCTIBLES looks like it will have both role-playing elements with character creation both similar lo and more advanced in some ways than the CHAMPIONS game had) and real-time action (in 3-D). We are ven much looking fonvard to this mid-tolate '96 release STONEWEEP OR STONEDEEP? Interplay must have been in a big rush to release their highly touted game, STONEKEEP, because it sure was not ready! Like the many hundreds of others I have ccountered online, I have got nothing but headaches out of STONEKEEP. Originally my problems arose from a lack of usable memory clue to Win 95. I eventually managed to fix this problem--no thanks to an hour wasted on the phone with interplay's technical support, and numerous messages postcdon AOL. After I finally got the game up and running I encountered not the dragons, and goblins and other monsters that I expected, but rather I ran into bug after gruesome bug! Taking a look at the BBS that Interplay has for STONEKEEP ON AOL, I saw that many others had experienced the Same bugs I had in addition to a multitude of other problems that I was fortunate enough to have avoided. There also seem to be two definite opinions concerning Interplay's Tech Support: 1) They are non-existent; and 2) They have no idea what they are talking about. the bottom line is Interplay was not ready to release this game and as a result they have jilted many gaming fans out of their time and money. I have begun a campaign to boycott Interplay products until restitution is made. Jack Cox Denver, Colorado bad news is that such technical flows can turn off gamers such as yourself. We print your letter as a service to our readers who might be as frustrated as you. fier the years this product spent in development, we don't think Interplay rushed it out the door. We simply recognize that a lot has happened and wish that the technical support was better. We also received many more positive than negative letters on the product. Here are some of them Loaded up STONEKEEP at 5 a.m. and the next thing I knew, it was lunchtime. Now, that's a game! Joe S. Allen Park, MI STONEKEEP is the first RPG I've played in some time that actually makes my hair stand on end! excellent game, well worth the wait! Daniel C. McLaughlin Brockport, NY We use stars because they are part of an established ratings mechanism that has been used by film, television, literary and restaurant critics for decades. A quick look at our five star scale gives you a quick take of our editorial staffs valuation of the game. Frankly, since these are subjective ratings (see \"How We Rate?\" in the FAQ section) as opposed to objective medsurements, we're not sure our readers would gain any real value by trying to figure out whether an 85% or an 84% rating is better and why? Both would more than likely be de facto \"Buy\" recommendations. We don't use percentages because we think they imply an exactitude which is impossible to quantify in a subjective ratings system.

"READ.ME 3-D Art Gets Faster And Cheaper SoftImage's NT Tools Offer Affordable Performance Softimage 3D for Windows NT may render SGI workstations unnecessary for game developers. igh-end computer animation just got a lot more afford able. One of the major software animation pack ages, Softimage 3D, is now available for Windows NT. Until this launch, game developers and professional animators who used the powerful toolset were required to use expen sive Silicon Graphics machine was more than two times faster than the SGI. Plus, the NT operating system allows accelerator cards to help complete rendering jobs even faster. Softlmage 3D for Windows NT is a full-function 3-D anima. tion tool that enables artists to develop complex models with subtle expressive movements. the software offers capabilities that few people outside the field can understand: function curves, animation timelines, fast preview rendering, adaptive ray tracing, mental ray tracing, inverse kinematic chains, and lattice deformation (the tool used to make the dancing gaso. line pumps in a popular televi sion commercial). It is these kinds of features that have been used to bring dinosaurs and ghosts to life in films like Jurassic Park and Casper, not to mention dozens of computer game characters. Most important for game developers is that the program offers eight different ways to do polygon reduction (lowering the number of polygons in an image to make it easier for a processor to draw, while saving as much detail as possible). In addition to the Netpower and Digital systems (which begin with a 266 MHz Alpha driven EV 4.5 system at $18,495 with the NT software) the NT software will allow companies to use: Intergraph Computer Systems entry level Pentium Pro systems which start at $15,500, bundled with the NT program and can be beefed up to having four processors. The advantage of the quad-processor solution is that two can be rendering in the background while the animator is working in the foreground without a perfor mance hit. The bottom line: With less expensive 3-D tools and affordable 3-D graphics accelerator cards, our anticipation of a 3-D graphics revolution in 1996 seems more certain than ever. As they say in the animation biz, stay \"toon\"ed. Softimage 3D can be used to render cartoon characters like this little bugger. well as the ones which may not s urvive though the winter chill. machines. Now, with the release of the Windows NT conversion, complete with all the functions and commands available in the SGI version, it will be possible to perform the same tasks at a much reduced price point ($15,000 for the Netpower R4400 RISC-based turnkey system bundled with Softimage's basic $7,995 software package). Plus, animation houses and software publishers will be able to set up \"render farms\" that cost less and work faster than current SGI models. In December, Softimage demonstrated an identical ren. dering being performed on an SGI Indigo-2 and a new Digital Equipment EVS machine (run. ning at 366 MHz) equipped with a RISC-based Alpha processor and Windows NT, The Digital ON THE SHELF ere's a quick look at the hottest me products on store shelves, as NAVY STRIKE NAVY STRIKE boasts an intriguing com bination of strategy game and flight simulation.

Some of these games are still months away, and they aren't even playable yet, but at least you can see what they look like, and get an idea what their intentions are. Age of Rifles SSI'S AGE OF Rifles is one of the most accessible wargames we've seen yet. Although it's too early to see the campaign or judge the Al, the included scenarios, the premise and the engine look solid. For new wargamers, there are quick com. bat reports, as well as a bar on the bottom of the screen with quick hints on how to manipulate the massive amount of information and troops in each game. Look for many different reactions to the same stimulus. Look for GALAPAGOS first on the Mac in late spring, to be followed by the PC version in the summer. AGE OF Rifles to hit the stores in the Summer, but if you want to play it sooner, we'll have a demo of the game on our March CG-ROM. FALCON, the upcoming simulation effort from Digital Integration and Interactive Magic, has been delayed until the third quarter of this year. Di is revamping this realistic F-16 simulation to include modern texturemapped graphics. After seeing TORNADO-a superb sim lacking only in the graphics department-flounder in the US market, this may not be a bad idea. Quake veryone wants to know the same thing about QUAKE: When is it going to ship? Not anytime soon, according to our Orion Burger anctuary Woods' animated comedy adventure ORION BURGER IS named after an intergalactic fast food chain you are subjected to wacky IQ tests rigged to make you look like mutton, while an invasion of alien cretins disrupts your home life. ORION BURGER will feature high-res graphics, handdrawn cel animation, and professional voice actors. F-16 Fighting Falcon espite hype you may have already heard about the sim, it turns out that F-16 FIGHTING Galapagos here is artificial life afterall. GALAPAGOS (by Anark) is a 3-D texture mapped world with dangerous and deadly obstacles, and it's your job to guide Mendel, the main character, through them. Mendel is an artificial life form which adapts and learns quickly, through positive and negative feedback, much like a dog. However, Mendel has a mind of his own and may express where earthlings comprise the tasty protein patties. However, the cosmic EPA demands that humans be non-sentient before being turned into Patty melts. So, sources. The guys at id Software have always insisted that it would ship \"when it was ready,\" and they're sticking to their words. But we're betting Quake will probably \"be ready\" sometime in the middle of the spring. Hopefully Afterlife ucasArts first foray into strategy games is a novel concept: the rule of heaven and hell. AFTERLIFE, which owes much of its interface to SIMCITY, sees you as the custo dian of the afterlife. You build structures and manage the two planes just as they were cities in similar strategy games, except this time, your citizens are dearly departed souls. In addition to making their eternal rest satisfying, you must also manage the caretakers of your realms-angels and demons-and shepherd certain souls toward reincarnation. AFTERLIFE's heavy dose of puns (you'll cringe at the literal Bat Out Of Hell) and its unique concept should be enough to pique the interest of SimCity-fans. FEBRUARY 1996 "

That's the imaginative story line of CRY.SYS Sierra's new action game Combining elements from clas sic arcade games with sophisticated 3D graphics and tons of fun, CRY.SYS harks back to the simpler, entertaining days of computer gaming. An isometric playing field, similar to CRUSADER: No REMORSE, but reminding us more of Gauntlet (remember that one?), is the virtual battlefield, where you'll have to navigate seven virtual worlds, each consisting of nine different levels and lots of bad guys. As you progress and find the numerous power-ups through out the game, your Herobots (each one has particular strengths, weaknesses and spe. cial attacks) attributes improve and they'll acquire better, more powerful weapons. Take hits and your Herobot reflects the damage by losing the ability to move in certain directions and to fire. The controls are keyboardand mouse-based, and will hopefully be configurable.

The game's animation is reminiscent of LucasArts' classic THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND (TSOMI), since the Sword fights are done mainly for laughs and do not require any actual reflexes. Yet, Touche' offers nothing as clever as the dueling diction of the insult interface in TSOMI, and the voice-acting, though most Americans think any schtick performed with a British accent is de facto hilarious, is distracting. After all, if the game is supposed to take place in France, we would CRY.SYS t's the end of the world and you know it, so a group of sur vivors tuck them selves in for a little cryogenic nap, figur. ing they'll snooze until the earth is a happy, habitable place again. Unfortunately, the Artificial Intelligence they use has a few defects, and when it's time to wake up, only two people-a man and a woman-are alive. That's bad. What's worse is that the woman is alive, but is being Chaos Overlord he future in CHAOS OVERLORD looks awfully familiar. The world has been united under a single government that has squashed all individuality and challenge. Life is complacent and dark, so a new breed of warlords has emerged to make a better life for themselves. These men and women descend into the oppressed cities and create havoc; and from that havoc seize all power and gain control of the city. In short, this premise looks like Blade Runner with gang warfare. CHAOS OVERLORD, from New World Computing, is a networkable strategy title where you, as a gang lord, impose your own order on the dark world. Rival gang leaders oppose you, and as in other strategy games, you must eliminate them and take their territory. Up to six players FEBRUARY 1996 "

It stars 64 authentic NCAA teams and will offer action modes and coaching modes in either exhibition games or a real-life NCAA Tournament The graphics are pretty slick-the bas ketball court looks more lifelike than any other hoops game we've seen. And while the motion.captured players look nice, their limited animations could use a little more fleshing out. Gameplay will be a little slower-paced than, say, NBA Live-the designers must favor Rollie Massimino's Villanova stall game--but once the play balancing has been tweaked (balls were still bouncing 15 feet off the rim on missed lay-ups), NCAA should be a lot of fun. Just being able to play college ball will make some fans happy. The feature that fascinates us most, however, is the one thing no other bas3931 can try their hand at ruling the underside of town, where gameplay involves researching new lethal weapons and accessories in order to extort the local businesses for money. Once you terror ize all the citizens you move to the next sector of town for more. Although the interface is supposed to be easy to learn, at times it can be con fusing. It's not that the commands aren't easily accessible, it's that you don't really know what they do. Also, there is a lot of information to process in order to get any kind of handle on the game, and unfortunately, it isn't pre. sented very clearly. Hopefully, proper documentation will alle. viate some of these problems. -Elliott Chin New World Computing (818 5889-5600 Mac/Win 95 CD-ROM stimated release dates based on the latest information from developers.

"GABRIEL KNIGHT 2 REVIEW DIFFICULTY LEVEL Knight of Eur Diamonds GABRIEL KNIGHT 2's Blend of Suspense And The Supernatural Is A Full House For Gamers by Johnny L. Wilson W7 WHICH V et W t en bebes Vet : YEYE WO IST ME? Grace, Gabriel's assistant, takes a much more aggressive role in GK2. In this standard interface shot, she interviews a city official. hen I saw the initial GABRIEL KNIGHT game, raved about it as ...an exceptional blend of art, game and understanding.\" GABRIEL KNIGHT 2: THE BEAST WITHIN is even more so. The story is fascinating, the writing is deft, the acting is well above the computer game norm, and the soundtrack is near perfect. Those who have never experienced a Gabriel Knight adventure will need to know that Gabriel, the protago. nist, is a bookstore owner from New Orleans. In the first game, he is a wannabe novelist who, with assistance from his female associate Grace, ends up solving a series of voodoo murders and writing a bestselling novel based on his efforts. The game's story was a study in contrasts: light vs. darkness, black vs. white, logic vs. the supernatural, and dream sequences vs. reality. By the end of the story, Gabriel becomes a schattenjaeger, a hunter of the supernatural. With its sophisticated handling of psychological archetypes and titillating use of the supernatural, the original game was as much a work of interactive literature as it was a game. GABRIEL KNIGHT 2: THE BEAST WITHIN (GK2) takes the quality up another notch. This time, the schattenjaeger has taken up resi dence in the family castle in Germany and, as a result of his mystical responsibilities, must solve a case which borders sus piciously on lycanthropic behavior. It maintains the sophisticat. ed dream sequences which foreshadowed both danger, solu. tions and inner turmoil in the first game, as well as a welldefined symbology. St. George continues to hold the place of light in GK2, and there is an interesting interplay between the swan and the wolf. By the time the adventure is through, gamers will have linked Ludwig Il of Bavaria, Richard Wagner and a few historical liberties in a most remarkable plot. GK2 also provides more balance between the principal char. acters. In the original, Gabriel's associate Grace is definitely a supporting character. In GK2, she has equal weight with Gabriel, allowing gamers to view the story from more than one perspective-more story and movie than traditional game. The new game retains the style of clever dialogue used in the Price: $59.95 System Requirements: PC compatible 486-25 or better 8 MB RAM, 5 CMB HD space, SVGA with 256 colors, 2x CDROM-or higher.

Bellevue, WA 98007 (800) 757-7707 Reader Service: W320 original. Sometimes, this is handled as throwaway humor and sometimes with profound foreshadowing. I was amused when a fireplace was described as adequate for the big bad wolf to come down in a story about werewolves, but I particularly liked the way Gabriel would allude to the case with double entendres. When a Hunt Club member asks Gabriel if he hunts, he quietly responds, \"I hunt. I hunt all the time.\" Another time a suspect complains to Gabriel that, \"No matter how much I spray them down, they still stink.\" Gabriel retorts, \"Yeah, I guess some creatures are like that.\" These are very nice touches within the context. Some of Grace's lines seem unnaturally testy at first, but as noted later in this review, it actually works. The first adventure offered high production values in sound and music. In GK2, Composer Robert Holmes and his col. leagues raise the bar further by using the operatic style made famous by John Williams in Star Wars (different theme music for each character) so that Gabriel's theme has a heavy lugubriOus counterpoint, Grace's theme is a delicate and romantic melody blending piano and harp. Even such minor characters as a police inspector has a theme with a martial percussion Certain locales like the Rittersberg church and the secret pas. sage also have their own themes. I also liked the delightful gui tar version of \"When The Saints Go Marching In\" at the CG FEBRUARY 1996 "

When examining an item in inventory, such as Grace's notebook shown here, you will get this close-up view. Marienplatz fountain during Chapters 1 (where author Jane Jensen makes her Hitchcockian cameo) and 3. tourist map of Bavaria (for Grace) with active locations appearing as the characters learn about them. Best of all, the digitized film sequences don't get in the way of the game. A mouse click will let you bypass a sequence and, whenever a walker (the on-screen character moving through a scene) needs to traverse the entire screen (such as at the Marienplatz of Munich), there is a fast-forward icon that moves the character to the next virtual fork in the road. As for the film sequences themselves, a variety of styles in close-ups and other camera angles are directed with flair by Will Binder and some sequences use an entirely different look. The posterized wolf's-eye view and the television camera view in Chapter 3 were particularly effective in adding visual variety, as was the Francis Ford Coppola-esque opera staging of the final chapter. Another fresh look occurs when Grace investigates some castles. Not only can the player click on various objects and locations, but there is a button to click which plays a docent tape and allows the player to discover more about each sight. This adds to vocal variety so that players don't always have to hear the character's voice describing each object or locale. Frankly, the film clips are paced so well and spaced so effectively throughout the game that they often serve as mini-reward sequences. They are generally exciting enough to keep you pushing from puzzle to puzzle in order to see more and more of the story evolve. Unlike many games which utilize LOVE STORY The paintings depicting Wagner's Tannhauser proany sort of interactive movie vide additional clues to the mystery, and the Tour Tape button technology, I found myself adds vocal variety to the harvesting of the clues. experiencing delighted anticipation rather than frustrating impatience whenever the hour glass icon would signify that the program was calling up a film sequence. Of course, the fact that I could skip scenes I'd already seen enhanced that feeling that the film clips were rewards for a triumphant puzzle solver. METAPHOR METAMORPHOSIS The first game used the visual metaphor of a graphic novel (a book in the style of comic book art for mature readers) to unfold the story. The New Orleans settings and backgrounds looked a lot like what you would expect to see in a Dark Horse Comic. Players navigated from location to location using a tourist map interface where all the famous sites appear as colorful icons whenever the character learns of a clue. GK2 uses the film metaphor. Nathan and Darlou Gams have blended the photographic backgrounds and digitized video (using a chromakey or green screen process) almost seamless ly, so that the whole look is significantly better than the video with rendered backgrounds of PHANTASMAGORIA. Actors move in front of actual Bavarian locales with photographic resolution, and it is very effective. Players navigate from place to place using an actual mass transit map of Munich (for Gabriel) and a Comic CHARACTER TRANSFORMATIONS From the start, the characters in the Gabriel Knight adventures have been characters with solid motivation and inner conflict. In GK2, the digitized performances make the characters even more believable. To be sure, some of the performances are over the top\" in a nearmelodramatic perspective (Xavier, the Hunt Club doorman, and Mrs. Smith, the cliche-ridden demonologist from Pennsylvania, come to mind), but most of the performances are both credible and pleasing. As a cast, think they offer the most even quality of performance, WAILS FROM THE CRYPT Grace encounters Gerda grieving at a local crypt. This moving scene shows how well the photographs and video have been integrated in GK2. FEBRUARY 1996 CG "

"GABRIEL KNIGHT 2 REVIEW PRE:12MMBRIE WEBSITA EVENTS T O ANTE ber Lyri der HINT MAPPED METAPHORS The tourist map of Bavaria and the mass transit map of Munich provide the travel interfaces for GK2. from Dean Erickson's Gabriel Knight through the lowest-ranking supporting character. To complement the characterization, GK2 offers plenty of dra matic tension to bring the characters into focus. Grace is played to sardonic perfection by Joanne Takahashi. One quickly understands that her bitter view of the world is as much rage turned inward as it is rivalry with Gabriel and jealousy of Gerda. Of course, Kriminalkommisar Leber's territorial protection of his professionalism and the hostile paranoia of von Zell, one of the Royal Bavarian Hunt Club members, add to the opportunities for dramatic interaction. Flare-ups and tender reconciliations abound in GK2. even when they think they have already clicked there. This is particularly true in Chapter 1 when the key is hidden in a dark shadow, and Chapter 4 when you must click on a display case on the exact corner twice. You'll also have to keep returning to most locations several times before you solve everything, but that's a common adven. ture game convention. Thankfully, Jensen has divided your progress into 697 points of information-gathering/puzzle-solving, so you feel like every incremental point counts and know when you're making progress. Fortunately, the blinking cursors on the map symbols let you know when you haven't yet collect ed all the clues or performed all the actions in a given location. The only unfair clue I can remember in the game is the mag. azine/tape recorder schtick in Chapter 3. Now that I've mentioned it, the reference may come in handy when you've reached the end of your patience. Still, the blend of history and clever storytelling make the exposition of the plot a joy, in spite of occasional clumsiness in the puzzle system. PUZZLING TRANSMOGRIFICATIONS Most importantly, the puzzles aren't dumbed down to reach a broader audience. Though some are relatively simple, some are diabolically clever. Nearly everyone will immediately know what to do with the quick-drying cement or mirror image puzzles, but some will have trouble fig. uring out the tape-splicing puzzles and the cuckoo clock. Plus, the pacing of each investigation isn't bogged down by having every clue delivered via a short movie. Clues are to be found by ANGEL OR DEVIL? Gabriel examines his inventory to decide reading books (with or withwhat he might share with his attorney. out the accompanying voiceover), examining museum artifacts, interview ing witnesses in film clips, and listening to audio clips. This is extremely positive because it lends variety to the game Unfortunately, one disease common to most modern adventure games still infests GK2-pixelitis. On several occasions, gamers will have to find and click on a precise spot to get the next clue, WEREWAGNER Plot, puzzles, characterization and art all lead to one of the most ambitious denouements ever in graphic adventure game history. The lost-opera-of-Wagner scene is worthy of a film epic It offers tense moments, comic relief, and a fascinating catharsis. We've always believed that a significant amount of produc. tion resources should be spent in rewarding the gamer who plays all the way through the game. GABRIEL KNIGHT 2: THE BEAST WITHIN transforms game endings-a dynamic finish to a most dynamic game. Jane Jensen just may have become the interactive Anne Rice she's always wanted to be APPEAL: Readers of Anne Rice-style gothics and traditional graphic adventure gamers are in for a rare treat in this one. PROS: Great story, extravagant backgrounds, exceptional acting, and a near-perfect soundtrack makes this a graphic adventure benchmark. CONS: Some puzzles may be obscure enough to seem unfair.

So, in tic depictions of real life racing available-the only true test of one's driving abilities. And, judging by the vaporware and unfulfilled expectations we've seen over the last few years, the auto-racing sim sub-genre is a hard club to successfully join. In my humble opinion, only five programs have scaled the lofty heights and climbed into to the Racing Sim Hall of Fame: INDIANAPOLIS 500-THE SIMULATION (1989), WORLD CIRCUIT (1992), INDYCAR RACING (1993). NASCAR RACING (1994), and the latest inductee, INDYCAR RACING II. It's no fluke that all but one (MicroProse's WORLD CIRCUIT) have hailed from those motoring magi. cians at Papyrus Design Group-they started the revolution in 1989 9x1000 RPM and have been directing it ever since. MPH 040 LAP 1 OF 5 PAD 1 DAAT DINKED MAKING IT REAL To be considered a simulation, a program must adhere to rigid guidelines. For starters, it must incorporate an authentic car feel, with elements such as tires that grip when heated, yet slip when DRIVING ON THE LEFT WORLD CIRCUIT, an import from MicroProse UK, included plenty of aids to help keep beginning drivers on the track. CHITEKH REPLAY chronological order, let's take a quick peek at the programs that have made it into the Racing Simulation Hall of Fame.  TRACK SKY CRASH AAUGH! THE POLYGONS! INDIANAPOLIS 500: THE SIMULATION ushered in a new level of play realism, but the crashes were a bit lacking. THE FOUNDING FATHERS Modern racing simulation arguably started with INDIANAPOLIS 500THE SIMULATION, developed for Electronic Arts by Papyrus. Sure, the graphics in this EGA PC and Amiga game look blocky and primitive now, but back in '89 INDY 500 changed the way we look at auto racing games. It had only one place to drive, the fabled Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But the game more than compensated for this with extensive, true-to-life car modifications. The transmission was an automatic and acceleration was digital, but the rear view mirrors worked, and wrecked cars stayed on the track for that added demo. derby effect. The only successful attempt at reproducing the elite Formula 1 environment came in 1993 with WORLD CIRCUIT. This product ended a four-year drought in the world of competent racing sims, and to this day is the subject of numerous on-line message threads and racing contests. It's not quite as horrifyingly real as the latter-day Papyrus sims, but one might argue that that is what made it so downright fun. Despite admirably realistic driving characteristics, this remains the sim for those who can't or won't spend hours in training and car set-up mode. As an added bonus, several driving aids that could be switched on or off on the fly meant driving time for any level of playpushed too far; real-time acceleration and braking; and the visual impression that you really are going 180 mph). Sim racers view the action from the cockpit, avoiding contact with other cars to prevent damage. In realistic sims, drivers quickly dis. cover that only a smooth, consistent driving style and sticking to the racing \"line\" will win races. A proper mechanical set-up and judi cious pit stops are equally important. Replays are a must in a good sim-if not to relive one's glory, then to act as an after-the-fact driFEBRUARY 1996 CG "


"BURNING RUBBER er. WORLD CIRCUIT also sported a couple of multidriver modes, includ. ing modem play and the never since duplicated \"two players/one computer/one joystick\" feature. Opponent Al was questionable, and a short replay left us wanting more, but it was easy to see beyond these things and enjoy a thoroughly superb product. The second release from the Papyrus stable, INDYCAR Racing, took TV ] Suddenly you understand the NASCAR \"train,\" the meaning of the word concentration, and why a tight corner seems to bring these cars to a crawl. From magnificent audio to break-apart cars that continue to function with three tires and a departed hood, NASCAR RACING brought a real racing environment home. It also brought home the fact that Papyrus was in this racing game for keeps, and that their intention was to keep things very real and very tough (remember Bristol?). The newest entry in the racing stable is INDYCAR II, also from Papyrus (see the review, page 74). This sim elevates the open-wheel ers to the same high-resolution as NASCAR. It's absolutely gor: geous, even when things go wrong-collisions may result in your car being reduced to a mere pod, bereft of wheels, body parts and engine. Extreme instances of such carnage may even involve the disappearance of driver's helmets from their cockpits. Of course, this sort of horror would involve backtracking at tremendous speeds for the sole purpose of a 400 mph meeting, and just what sort of sicko would want to do that? Opponent Al has been radically improved from its predecessor; computer cars recognize the appearance of an imperfect human, and make the necessary adjustments. One might say that the Al drivers are getting downright mannerly. Gaidae Cicine on WI.

Coming Soon auto race sims into a new level of realism and danger. It also sig. naled the encroachment of processor-intensive texture mapping into racing sims, and this is when it all began to get very serious. Auto racing was no longer a matter of who could go fast and who could n't. Now there was a gaggle of modifications that almost warranted a digital mechanic's license, and car modeling that was in a very diffi. cult league of its own.

But if the beta is any indication, GRAND PRIX II will be an audiovisual masterpiece, with high-res texture-mapping, light-source shading, and 3-D sound. It's not actually a sequel to a program called Grand Prix, but rather to WORLD CHCUIT. (Spectrum/MicroProse has adopted World Circuit Racing as their new brand name for racing sims, so the title will be World Circuit Racing's GRAND PRIX II. Confused yet?) Pieced together by Geoff Crammond and many of the same people responsible for WORLD CIRCUT, GRAND PRIX II comes from good stock, and the beta shows flashes of brilliance Cars behave in a fashion reminiscent of its predecessor, but are faster, harder to control, and will actually grab some air when they're off-tracking. The word is that an associated program, GRAND PRIX MANAGER, will be a strategist's dream. i Chase HONDA MICHIGAN IN THE SVGA AGE While INDYCAR's textures made for a better looking game, it was the addition of high-res SVGA graphics in 1994's NASCAR RACING that brought a high sense of realism-if you had the necessary hardware.

Mainstream driving fans know what really matters isn't found in the pits, but on the farmac: heart-pounding, full-tilt driving action.

SCREAMING FOR MORE Virgin Interactive's SCREAMER takes a quantum leap towards real coin-op style arcade racing on the PC. This DOS-based game offers a lot of bang for the buck, including network play, responsive controls, sensational sound effects, and absolutely dazzling graphics. Only three courses are available, but they are whoppers-Palm Town, Lake Valley and Lindburg. Each twists and turns through realistic urban and country settings, filled with high banks, rolling hills, tun. nels, bridges and other hazards designed to keep you sharp.

A pop up CD player lets you choose from seven electrifying musical sound tracks, complete with vol. ume controls. NEW YORK KAY GRAND PR HAM TIL 11 SIMPLE OR SIMULATION? Bridging the gap between racing sims and arcade dri ving games is Electronic Arts' THE NEED FOR SPEED. Aesthetically, this game is a stunner-the culmination of years of excellent racing design from the old pros at Distinctive Software (TEST DRIVE I and II, STUNTS and GRAND PRIX CIRCUIT). The big differences between this and the other games mentioned here are perfor. mance and polish. Everything about this game looks, feels and sounds authentic, capturing much of the depth of a simulation with out forfeiting the fun of arcade racing. Unlike the previous titles' generic racers, THE NEED FOR SPEED offers real, blistering street machines like the Corvette ZR-1, Dodge Viper, Ferrari 512TR and Lamborghini Diablo. Of course, racing these spirited beauties on mundane tracks just wouldn't do. In addition to standard closed-loop tracks, there are a series of spectacular cours es, ranging from full-throttle country settings to coastal gauntlets and precarious mountain ridges. Besides fellow racers, road hazards include off-track obstacles, slow-moving civilian traffic and one of the 125cc shifter for all-out thrill seekers. Courses include a variety of professional closed circuit tracks, as well as high-strung runs through the streets of San Francisco, Baltimore and New York, rendered with exacting detail to their real-life locales. Competition ranges from practice laps to single player races against a roster of feisty computer-controlled drivers. The biggest kick, however, is network play, where up to eight people can compete simultaneously. The action is full-bore and more than a little madcap, often resembling a high-speed game of bumper cars Once the novelty wears down and drivers of equally matched talents go head-to-head, the game delivers some of the most rous ing action seen in any game of the genre Controls are light and responsive, with kart performance directly affected by options for tire class, gear ratios and track conditions (dry, wet oricy).

"Car Wars When Driving 100 Mph Just Isn't Enough... by Peter Olafson n the future, driving will be a blast: we will evidently have even more and bigger weapons in our cars than some of us do now. I know this because I've been playing a raft of next generation driving games in which drivers do not simply humiliate opponents by beating them to the finish line, but add injury to insult by blowing them to kingdom come along the way. Blame it on Mad Max, which added the expression \"post-apocalyptic war zone\" to the nation al vocabulary. Or on the fact that prudence and safety, while altogeth. er admirable things in real-life, are not especially dashing or fun when encased in a computer game. Explosions are fun. Beating people with a lead pipe until they run off the road is fun. Using a rocket launcher to rip them a new tailpipe is fun. Driving the speed limit, not cutting people off and turning right on red only when safe may be a futuristic fantasy, but it does not win the hearts and minds of gamers. None of this is especially new, of DESTRUCTION DERBY DESTRUCTION DERBY (Psygnosis) is a perfect illustration of the potential of this aggressive artform, and it's about as civilized as this sort of game gets. Which is to say not very. It is a celebration of that auto motive staple of the American heartland-the demolition derby-in which drivers use their cars as battering rams to do as much damage as humanly possible to other cars. The last one that can still move, wins. In that respect, it's a great simulation. The high-speed collisions of the texture mapped cars are convulsive and realistic. The first time you see one-or feel one, in first-person view-it'll be all you can do to stop from bouncing off the back of your seat (can a computer game cause whiplash? Psygnosis will be hearing from my lawyer...). DESTRUCTION DERBY has never seen before quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to open-mouthed friends and relatives (apart from the addition of new graphics here and there, it's effectively identical to the PlayStation version). What's especially marvelous--and unprecedented for this sort of game is the detail in which car damage is addressed. Hoods crumple to steeper and steeper angles, doors cave in, steering and speed deteriorate, steam begins to erupt from a ruptured radiator and eventually turns an oily black when you're out of commission. However, for a game so unapologetically entertaining, DESTRUCTION DERBY's useful life span is surprisingly short. The main drawback: the demo-derby arena and half-dozen stock.car tracks are all dead flat-a limitation of the game engine-and after a few rounds you'll crave new and creative ways to wreak havoc. A little STUNT TRACK RACER sensibility would have helped: imagine DESTRUCTION DERBY with elevated segments, ramps, jumps, loops and banked curves. Imagine a track editor. Hopefully they'll keep this in mind for the planned followup. (Sony Interactive's TWISTED METAL-a PlayStation conversion due in March-should offer a taste of this vertical dimension, with weapons to boot). Despite its limitations, this is a great game, but it has a lot more potential. Hace points 88 MIZE 01/25 SIMPLY SMASHING Destruction Derby has NASCAR RACING-style graphics, but with more emphasis on the wrecks. WIPEOUT WIPEOUT (also from Psygnosis) covers well-trod territory, but nevertheless makes the old new again. Hovercraft racing has been done many times before, but rarely with such svelte assurance. You guide a needle-nosed craft along a narrow track over steep hills, across canyon-sized jumps and roller-coaster curves, all the time collecting power-ups-rockets, missiles, mines, shields and speed boosts-and use them to gain ground on your rivals (it's impossible to destroy the competition in WIPEOUT). Qualify by finishing in the top three, and you move on to the next track. I don't think the screen resolution here is quite as high as the PlayStation version-it doesn't have that amazing hard-edged lookcourse. Who can forget ROAD BLASTERS or SPY HUNTER? Driving and shooting have gone hand-in-trigger at least since Electronic Arts released RACING DESTRUCTION SET for the Commodore 64. CD-ROM games like MEGARACE and CYBERRACE brought automotive violence to the big-time, and the advent of the Pentium (and the Power Mac) has primed this genre for the next level. CG FEBRUARY 1996 "

"BURNING RUBBER OX2S. across the galaxy. Unfortunately, you don't really steer; your bird-like ship is on a guide wire. You control the throttle and rotation of your bird-like craft to collect power-ups and keep out of the path of what ever incoming dangers your rivals throw at you. CYBERSPEED does throw in a couple of new elements, though. Most race games of this sort are one-way only. Not this one--you can turn around and head in the other direction at any time (just make sure to keep an eye on your opponents' locations so the joke's not on you). Most games in this vein are also strictly linear. Not this one-you can occasionally switch to an alternate path by tapping the \"Tab\" key at the appropriate time. Technically, it's reasonably welldone-the ads and silly announcer patter patch in seamlessly between the races. And on a Pentium 90, it moves along at a good clip with the detail set to medium. But CYBERSPEED is ultimately more a diversion than an obsession. The level of interaction makes it more a 3-D arcade game than a true race. While Wipeout makes you feel free as a bird-you're really flying-CYBERSPEED makes you feel more like an elegant pig in an elegant pen. 00-lÃ© OTTIMUN GLIDE-O-RAMA WIPEOUT emphasizes speed and finesse more than crashing and destroying, but the action still sucks you in. 100% 0001 HARRY 1 000 but when you get the hang of the curves well enough to stop bump ing into the edges, you'll still be taken in by the bewitching smoothness of the whole affair Never mind the fuzzy-wuzzies.

This isn't simply MAGIC CARPET on the race track; it's a lively and lovely game all its own. There's just enough scenery to be distracting, and there's just enough give when cornering to make you watch your speed. There's also just enough extra space on the track to make you go back and explore what you may have missed. And the speed and smoothness is...well, I can't speak to frame rates.

"REVIEW INDYCAR 2 TV 2 to miss the evil trackside barrier, yet certainly figured I'd be bonding with a few of my peers. Suddenly, like the Red Sea, they parted company just enough to let me in. This sort of Al shows up all over the place, such as Laguna Seca's corkscrew where a timid early braking maneuver doesn't necessarily mean rear wing separation at the hands of a charging driver. You may experience the odd tap (can you say Detroit?), but no damage. Sadly, Papyrus wasn't able to deal with the problem of com puter cars coming to a dead stop when a vehicle is slow or stopped on the driving line. Here, the other drivers remain KSET SIRU0:00:39.14 XIKITA SHOW STOPPER When you see this conflagration in front of you, there's nothing to do but close your eyes and duck. incredibly stupid. Remember, if you crash, come to a stop right on the traveled area, and nobody's gonna finish the race. 0:00:36.12 An Indy Primer f your previous PC racing experience has been limited to arcade-type games, don't be surprised if your first few INDYCAR II forays are accompanied with sentiments such as, \"Why did I buy this game?l\", \"Nobody can drive this thing!\" and the ever popular, \"$%+# II\" If you ride out the initial storm, however, it will get better. First-timers would do well to customize some options before they even get near a track. From the Main Menu, choose the wide and somewhat forgiving Michigan oval to cut your racing teeth. Go to the garage and load the Easy set-up. Before driving, knock the fuel load down to a half-tank (20 gallons), so you won't have to worry about large amounts of methanol negatively impacting car handling. Behind the wheel there are three golden words that must be committed to memory: Patience, Smoothness and consistency. Remember, there will always be another time to pass a given vehicle, so don't attempt wild maneuvers that could end up in a clock-eating bobble or spin. Driving fast down the straightaways will be the least of your problems. Dealing with turns is tough. Enter a turn from the outside (up near the wall), cut down to the inside, and slow down. Try clipping the apex before accelerating through the exit. Using this technique, you will naturally swing back to the outside wall at full acceleration. Traffic and other considerations won't allow a textbook turn each and every time, but stay as close to this philosophy as possible. Remember that you're in control of a constantly changing machine, and things like a depleting fuel load and warming tires will get you moving faster and adhering better as the race progresses. Passing is something else altogether. Mastery of the \"draft\" or \"slipstream\" creativ enhances the straightaway pass. Many high-brow scientific principles take place here, but it goes like this: If two cars, lined up one behind the other, are traveling approximately the same speed, the front car will be \"cutting the air\" for the one tucked behind. The narrower the gap, the greater the effects of the vacuum. So, if you start several car lengths behind, you will begin moving faster and faster until you're on the lead car's back wing. Just before you rear-end him, pull out to the inside and your momentum will carry you safely by. Works every time. Passing in a turn, on the other hand, generally involves a little maneuver called \"outbraking.\" In essence, you want to make the pass before you slow for the corner, and the only way to do that is to brake later than your rival. Make sure you are on the inside line as the two of you go into the turn, then wait. When his image drops back in the rear-view mirror, apply the binders. If you do this just right, he'll have to fall in behind you (watch a replay blimp view to see why). Never pass on the outside, particularly in a turn. Those are the basics. Welcome to the \"real\" world of INDYCAR II. SHARP EDGES Graphically, ICR II comes through with flying high-res colors. Sparkling, sharp, clear-pick a superlative and it applies to everything on and off the track, including transparent windshields. (even though curbing is conspicuously absent.) Of course, such was the case with NASCAR, but the much-heralded frame-rate fiasco muted the enthusiasm of anyone operating on less than a Pentium 100. Fortunately, in a stunning stroke of programming smarts, Papyrus deals a blow to the god of slow frame rates with ICR II. Running a Pentium 90 with a Diamond Stealth 64 VRAM, I set maximum cars drawn in front and behind, with all sounds on. Flagrantly flirting with disappointment, I bravely cranked all graphic options wide open, only to discover a smooth frame rate. In the end, I killed the grass and road texture, and the darned thing flowed like honey from corner lo corner, side to side. Regrettably, I'd remained riveted on the program's visual bounty a little too long, and suddenly found myself involved in the most embarrassing of on-track incidents. Yes, this time I'd pounded the pace car, and darned if that driver didn't have something to say back to me! Well, have patience with me, buddy. After all, I don't have my training wheels any longer. XaKII AWAITING DISASTER One big tip: if you want to see parts fly, just try driving clockwise on the track. APPEAL: Hard-core racing fans who want complete control in and out of the pits, or wannabee fast drivers who don't mind learning the ropes. >PROS: Crisp graphics with a better frame rate than NASCAR RACING, as well as cataclysmic collisions. Major improvements to opponent Al and car handling from the original INDYCAR. CONS: Road courses are nearly impossible without a wheel-andpedal controller unit.

What is for computer gaming. ROM drive to SCSI. SCSI. The aforementioned large hard disks are a good example. Even now, the largest EIDE hard drives are 1.6 gigabytes, with 2 gigabyte drives yet to hit the streets, but you can get SCSI hard drives as large as 9 gigabytes. The other advantage is device variety. Onone SCSI interface, you can have up to seven devices, including CD-ROM drives, hard disks, tape drives and scanniers. This can be very valuable in the PC architecture, with its limited number of hardware interrupts. For example, the Adaptec 3940 twin-channel SCSI interface can support up to 15 devices, using only a single interrupt (IRQ). Contrast this with systems which support four IDE devices. Each pair of IDE devices uses an interrupt, so if you have four peripherals attached, you use up two interrupts. Anyone who's tried to configure scanner cards, network cards, and a flurry of other oddball devices can testify to the hairpulling that goes on in the eternal hunt for a free interrupt in a full PC. Then there's the performance issue. In systems with a single hard disk, EIDE drives often outperform their SCSI cousins, even if the same core disk drive mechanism is used. As soon as you go to multiple drives, things begin to change. This is because of the way IDE is implemented. LAB NOTES FEBRUARY 1996 CG "


"LOYD CASE 19 010 NE011 When the PC sends a request to the IDE drive for some data, it waits until the IDE crive says it's ready. With SCSI, the PC sends the request, then immediately goes on and does something else, assuming the SCSI drive will do its thing. With IDE hard drives, this slight wait is imperceptible, and often hidden by the fast data rates and access times of modern EIDE disks. However, it becomes quite noticeable in CDROM drives, which have slower data rates and slower access times. This has nothing to do with transfer rates or access times. The secret to why SCSI CD-ROM drives will always outperform their IDE cousins is CPU utilization. When the computer sends a request for a data transfer to the IDE device, it waits until the device says its ready flying back and forth, the CPU has to work much harder. In contrast, with a S CSI CD-ROM drive and its intelligent controller, the computer simply issues the request and continues on to the next task Even with very fast IDE CDROM drives (6x and faster), digital vidco cut scenes from some games occasionally stutter in the middle of a game-even on a 133-MHz Pentium.

"THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE PART THREE The Ultimate Game Machine TECHNOLOGY Building The Electronic Hot Rod From The Chassis Up Loyld Case here is a group in Southern California known as the Banzai Runners.

"PART THREE THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE TECHNOLOGY board business for nearly a decade, and it shows. The M54Hi looks like a clean design, is well laid-out, and allows for up lo two full-size interface cards. The board is quite rigid, unlike some less-expensive boards, and installing into the lower case was a snap. The machine was configured withi 16 MB of 60-nanosecond EDO RAM, direct from chip manufacturer Micron. Same Assembly Required PC Power & Cooling 10-bay Case With Silencer 270 Power Supply THE WHEELS No computer is complete without storage. Skipping IDE and EIDE (Enhanced IDE) disks entirely, as they require processor power to transfer data, I went with the Adaptec 2940UW ultra-wide SCSI drive. The 2940UW is capable of burst data rates of up to 40 MB per second using ultra-wide SCSI drives (see my column in this issue for more info on SCSI). Unfortunately, Ultra SCSI drives aren't very common yet, so we obtained a Quantum Atlas 2.1 gigalyyte wide SCSI drive. This drive transfers data in 16-bit chunks (rather than the usual cight bits for standard SCSI) and can handle burst transfers of up to 20 MB per second. With an access time of 8.5 mil. liseconds, al MB buffer and a rotation speed of 7200 RPM, this drive is about as fast as you can get As for the floppy, I went a little exotic here, picking Combytes double speed floppy /QIC tape drive combo unit. This is a nice little imit that works as advertised, and with 2.1 CB of storage in our hot-rod system, a few 800 MB QIC tape cartridges supply ready backup capability. isting all the parts like this makes it sound like a pretty cool system until you have a garage full of boxes, a lot of seemingly incomplete manuals and not much time on your hands. Although it's much easier than it was a few years ago, building your own computer is still not a task for the technologically faint-of-heart. This is especially true if you're trying to build on the \"bleeding edge\". However, if you're still tempted, here's some advice. First, heed all the warnings you may have heard about static electricity, particularly if you live in a dry climate. One ungrounded shuffle across a carpet, and that Pentium processor that set you back $600 is now a piece of scrap silicon. Although it's possible to exercise caution by simply touching the power supply or other ground periodically as you're working, a better solution is to invest $20 in a grounding strap. These are available at most electronic hobbyist stores. There are also several incredibly useful tools: an electric screwdriver, a set of spring tongs (for retrieving those dropped screws) and a pair of forceps, which are ideal for inserting jumpers in awkward places. And whatever you do, don't forget to pick up a set of those cute plastic standoffs that are absolutely essential for mounting your new motherboard in its case. While the 10-bay tower case I used is overkill for most systems, do try to get a full sized tower, if possible. At least get a midsize tower or full size desktop-avoid a minitower at all costs. Your Knuckles will thank you for it. How did CG's hot-rod go together? I've built and upgraded a number of systems over the years, so it went fairly smoothly. However, I had odd, unexpected problems. For example, the ten-bay case was built to better tolerances than most cases I've seen, which meant that the metal slot cover on some 1/0 cards fit very snugly. Also, working with the new generation of plug-and-play devices proved somewhat daunting. Configuring plug-andplay cards should be an oxymoron, since they are selfconfiguring. Problems occur when the system picks a set of parameters for a card (e.g., the AWE-32) that isn't consistent with what many games expect. Part of the problem stems once again from being \"between generations.\" When Win 95 native mode games become the norm-probably not for another year-then DOS configuration hassles will become an unpleasant memory. Until then, plug-and-play can be frustrating. Poor documentation didn't help, either. To properly configure the AWE PnP in a DOS environment, you need to load a software driver, which isn't really documented anywhere. Only by pawing through the AWE package, did find the Intel Plug and Play ISA Configuration Utility disk. On a more mundane note, lifting a 21-inch monitor was quite a challenge, and those of you without bulging muscles should ask for assistance. The all-steel tower case was no lightweight, either. WINDOWS ON THE WORLD Of course, the operating system is Windows 95, which can run the newest Win 95-native games and handle DOS games with panache. In the worst case, you can always run your games from the DOS prompt. The Matrox Millenium handled the graphics chores Unlike carlier Matrox cards, it's a very solid DOS performer; it also offers stellar Win 95 performance. The Millenium is expandable to 8 MB of WRAM (a new kind of memory optimized for graphics adapters) and las expansion connectors for video-capture and MPEG daughtercards. I've been using the Millenium for several months now, and have been impressed by ils overall speed and rock-solid Windows performance. My choice of the Millenium, however, was because none of the neat new stuff was on the verge of shipping. We've been a bit disappointed with the Diamond Edge, but we're looking forward to cards based on Rendition's VÃ©rite 3-D chip and S3's Verge 3-D accelerator Those won't be out for several months yet, though. Ah, yes, the monitor. I couldn't settle Micronics M54Hi Motherboard The choice of CD-ROM was somewhat conserva tive, but still prctly quick: NEC's XCD ROM reader. The X sports an access time of 145 milliseconds. It handles digital video better than even an 8X EIDE CD. ROM, due to the fact that SCSI transfers don't incur the huge processor penalty EIDE accesses do.

"PART THREE THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE TECHNOLOGY Go Combyte Floppy/Tape Combo MAKING IT FLY No game system is complete without a set of controllers. First, the mundane: you gotta type and you gotta mouse around. My keyboard of choice has always been the Northgate Omnikey 101. No other keyboard manufacturer has come close to the feel of the Omnikey line. They're a little hard to find, but well worth the effort spent looking Although I took a close look at the Microsoft Natural keyboard. I found pressing the keys down took too much work, despite the more relaxed layout. Imagine a mouse with a rubberized surface rather than a slippery one, and you've just imagined thc Logitech Sensa. The Sensa comes in several colors and pattems; two of them have a rubberized surface that feels natural to the hand. The action is smooth and silky. Now for the controllers. I've always been something of a flight sim fan, though not quite a true fanatic. Nonetheless, it was a difficult choice between the hyper-realistic Thrustmaster FLCS/TQS joystick/throttle combination and the new F-16 Combat Stick/Pro Throttle upstarts from the venerable CH Products. In the end, I found myself sur prised to give the nod to the CH controllers. The Pro throttle, in particular, had a much smoother feel than the TOS, and was much casier to adjust in small increments. I also found myself liking the CH Pro Pedals better than my personal set of Thrustmaster RCS pedals. These new controllers constitute quite a comeback for CH, in my book. The Pro Pedals can also do double duty in driving simulations. Rounding out the controllers, the CH Virtual Pilot Pro is a very nice yoke-andthrottle setup that can also be used, albeit not quite realistically, in driving sims. Still, flight sim-oriented joysticks aren't necessarily the best sticks for action games, so I used the solid Gravis Gamepad for fighting games and the new Microsoft Sidewinder 3D Pro for other action-oriented games. One lastminute addition we set up with the ultimate rig was the VVD Virtual Vehicle driving device from Interactive I/O. Although we didn't include it in the total cost of our system, this $1295 controller/cockpil should be on your list if you're a really big fan of NASCAR Racing or IndyCar II.

"THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE . PART THREE All these controllers have a lot of cables. Life is made much casier with a Joyswitch, a $20 box that hooks up four controllers and two foot controllers. Rounding the system out is the new US Robotics DSVD modem. This modem allows simultancous voice and data over a single phone line, which makes modem gaming much more fun. A 3COM Etherlink PCI LAN card is the final device, for multiplayer games. THE HOLY GRAIL Is the ultimate hot-rod worth it?

In fact, the CPU benclunarks are ever-so-slightly slower. The overall DOSMark is among the highest I've seen, however, which is also attributable to the Matrox card and the Quantum disk.

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA  GAME DESIGN techno Oy The Big Bang The Pyrotechniques Of PC Game Explosions yachie cxplosions in onc. Despite the competence of the Origin artists, WING COMMANDER'S explosions still didn't look real. Recent games using this technique, like NovaLogic's COMANCHE, still show less than stellar results. In fact, none of the games that rely on hand-drawn bitmaps for their explosions can quite live up to the visceral feel of the real pyrotechnics used in Star Wars. fyou appreciate a good fireball as much as the next pyromaniac, you may have noticed that game explosions have grown more convincing in the last year or so. You might not care how digital artists do it, so long as they keep doing it better, but when you think how long it's taken for the PC to realistically portray flying debris, and how challenging it is to illustrate expanding flame balls with binary data and pixels, you start to wonder what they're doing behind those mirrors. Well, the special cffects business has long been a refuge for the visually deceptive, and computer games are no exception. Here, then, is a peek behind the curtain at the artists and magicians who make things go \"boom!\" 60 It's a joke around LucasArts that every explosion in REBEL ASSAULT was the same one. IN THE BEGINNING... Several years ago, game designers used utilitarian paint programs to craft yellow, orange, and red pixels into simple 320 x 200 bitmap explosions. They needed scvcral frames of different bitmaps to render the explosion's rise and eventual dissipation. Designers programmed these image frames into a small collection of animated pixels called sprites, Sprites can restore the previous pixel configuration on the game screen after they dissipatc, or move somewhere else. Origin artists used animated bitmap sprites in the original WING COMMANDER for all Kilrathi fighter explosions, painting cach frame of the bitmapped fireball on the screen until it became nothing more than a memory: WING COMMANDER'S simple pixel-based pyrotechnics bear some resemblance to explosions in the Star Wars movies spherical or ellipsoid in shape, and often appearing as two USE THE SOURCE, LUKE If you want to make explosions similar to Star Wars, why not use the real thing? camera-created side effects such as lens LucasArts clic just that, popping over to flare and flash had to be cleaned up.

"PAUL SCHUYTEMA GAME DESIGN REBEL FLAMBÃ Thanks to the special effects pros at Industrial Light and Magic, the explosions in REBEL ASSAUL II are more realistic, and this time they don't all look the same. like edge-lighting all of the objects in the scene with an orange glow.\" SMOKE AND MIRRORS Today's high-end 3-D animation systems use mathematical systems to generate tiny particles, each with its own head ing and variely. LucasArts artists used particle systems to model some effects in Rebel II, but not explosions. \"We didn't do explosions in 3-D STUDIO,\" said Green, \"because they tend to look sort of comicaleverything is even and unatural. In After the credits, REBEL II pulls out all the stops to show a ship exploding on the landing pad. A small initial explosion blows the windows out of the cockpit, followed by a big bang of several mapped explosions, with tons of debris flying out and bouncing off the landing pad. \"It made more sense,\" explained Green, \"to have clebris flying out when you have an atmosphere. Then gravity can get involved and make things really interesting.\" project director for WING COMMANDER IV, \"you lose a lot of 'wow' potential.\" In WING IV, the game's installation program loads the explosion animation to a player's hard disk, allowing the animation to stream directly from the faster drive. This means that explosions can be between 50 and 75 frames long, WING IV's explosions appear in a manner similar to REBEL ASSAULT, with one primary difference: WING COMMANDER uses a free-form 3-D engine, while many graphics in REBEL ASSAULT are \"pre-rendered.\" Origin pre-rendered the explosions in WINC IV into compact animation files, but it's impossible to predict when or where one will be needed on the screen. This hinders Origin's artists from adding orange glow and edge-lighting effects. When gameplay calls for an explosion, the 3-D engine will create a \"quad,\" essentially a free-floating, invisible polygon, over the object about to go nuclear the quad follows the object (since things zip around rapidly in a WC IV dogfight). The game texture maps an animated explosion onto the quad in a way similar to REBEL ASSAULT To make the explosions sccm as real as possible, the Origin artists work with the raw TIFF frames to combine several explosions, and use particle systems to create sparks, add a shockwave effect, and anything else to make it better than real.\" \"Even with the raw footage,\" said Chris Douglas, production designer for WING IV and lead artist for WING III, \"you can play around with it and spruce it up a lot.\" For the larger explosions, such as a crumbling capital ship, several explosion arcas might be combined into a single animation \"We don't change the explosion,\" said Marone, \"for different player facings. It's drawn square-on, but you can't tell that it's fat or not perfectly matched in the heat of battle.\" Years ago, just a few orange and red pixcls would have satisficd us all, but as our games evolve and become more and more like our favorite movies, we want our game pyrotechnics to be just as flashy and real. After all, where's the heat without the flames? ali testet IN THE WINGS While the carly WING COMMANDER titles used hand-created bitmaps for explosions, WING COMMANDER III followed in LucasArts' footsteps by using digitized footage. Origin hired DreamQuest studios, the special effects firm behind Terminator 2 to create a library of explosions. DreamQuest recorded the explosions on Beta videotape which the media lab at Electronic Arts processed into franc-by-frame TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files. These filled up around a half-dozen CD-ROMs, complete with alpha channels\" providing mask files that correspond perfectly with the image for each frame of the explosion. WING 3 uses digitized explosions, but the program shuttling information between the game CD-ROM and the computer requires that explosions be less than than 15 frames long, \"At 15 frames,\" explained Tony Marone, KABOOM! A capital ship goes nuclear in WING COMMANDER IV. Notice the two distinct explosions emanating from ground zero. fact, I haven't seen a 3-D program yet that can make a realistic fireball.\" Particle systems do hold an advantage for creating smoke cffects, such as after a laser hits a wall or for interlocking spheres of smoke trailing a doomed ship.

"SCORPIA ADVENTURE/RPG ad venturn Champions Of Might & Magic New World's ANVIL OF Dawn Casts Quite A Spell own character, this is a single-player journey. While the characters are pre-created, you can take them as is or rearrange the stats to your liking. There are four: strength, stamina, agility, and power, and you have a total of 20 points to distribute among them. Strength, naturally, determines how much you can carry without becoming encumbered, and a high strength also means more damage done in melee combat. Stamina measures how quickly you become fatigued when exerting yourself, and agility is used in determining chances to hit a target. Power is related to magic, and governs how many spell points you have at the start of the game. It also has an effect on the spells you cast: a higher power rating means more potent spells. he world of Tempest, typical of worlds in fantasy games, is in trouble. An evil ruler, \"The Warlord, has sent his armies rampaging out of Desolation and across the land, and nothing can stop him. At best, the armies of Tempest can manage only a holding action, and even that won't last much longer. The only chance left is to discover the source of the Warlord's power and destroy it. Five champions are sent out with that mission. They are the last hope of Tempest; if they fail, the Warlord will be victorious, and a very dark age will descend upon the world. So the game begins, and you choose one of those five to maneuver as your  Now that Al Lowe has finished the family-safe TORIN'S PASSAGE (see the review in this section), he is busy designing LEISURE SUIT LARRY 7. Fans of Al's more usual risque humor can expect the lounge lizard, along with the usual bevy of beauteous babes, to return with tongue firmly in cheek by Christmas '96.  In the crowded sub-genre of Myst-alikes, it's always nice to see something with a different slant. Tribeka Interactive, Robert DeNiro's fledgling softYou can expect to see different critters each place you go, and there are plenty to go around. THAT OL' BLACK MAGIC There are seven magic disciplines: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Lightning, Flesh and Void. Each discipline has only three or four spells, and they total a mere 24 in all. That is low compared to some games that overwhelm you with long spell lists, but actually makes a lot of sense. Most people don't use all of the spells available in a game; typically, they settle on a few and forget the rest. The spells in ANVIL are certainly sufficient, and you probably won't be casting too many of them as it is; each spell has its own power point cost, and of course the better spells require more. Even a powerful character will run out quickly when spells are in the 300+ point range. Therefore, even with magic, you can expect to do a lot of physical combat, which is in real-time. Four weapon skills are in the game: hacking (axes and hammers), slashing (swords), thrusting (spears) and ranged (bows and thrown weapons). At the start, your character is a complete novice in both weapon and magic skills, having a level of l in all of them. Increases come with experience, which is measured by bar graphs, one graph each for magic and weapons. The more fighting you do, the faster the weapons graph increases, the more spells you cast, the faster the magic graph increases. When a bar is totally filled in a level is achieved, and you can choose which weapon skill or magic discipline to raise. It doesn't matter if, for instance, all your CRYSTAL BALL ware company, seems to have bought a clue on their way to the computer game industry superhighway. Their first game (as yet untitled) follows the familiar formula of mysterious, gorgeously-rendered rooms filled with puzzles to solve. But here, the puzzles, while sometimes arcane, do actually relate to the story. The entire game takes place in a \"Fantasy Island\"type resort for rock stars-with a mindset every bit as strange and fresh as it sounds. Release is tentatively set for Springwe'll keep you posted.

"SCORPIA TIPS ADVENTURE/RPG through the target, and is never seen again. Save frequently when using the spear, as a precaution. In ANVIL'S Gorge Keep, the man you free from the ice block tells you how to raise the portcullis to leave by the back door and get across the chasm. However, it is entirely possible to get across the chasm another way, and come into the keep by the back door, using a special item to lower the gate. If you enter that way. do NOT play with the winch: leave it alone, or you won't be able to leave by the back again. That will mean a very long trip around to reach the other means of crossing the chasm.  Steelripper, a nifty spear in ANVIL OF DAWN (a fantastic thrown weapon!). has a disturbing tendency to disappear at odd times, especially when you're fighting Slog Riders. The spear seems to go le, hardly the norm when spellcasting in most RPGs. DEMONS DIFFER, BUT THEY ALL DIE The dungeons have their own types of monsters as well. There are generally two kinds or, on rare occasions, three, running around the premises. You can expect to see different critters each place you go, and there are plenty to go around. Happily, once disposed of, they do not regenerate, which gives you time to explore afterwards. Automapping is simply excellent.

"SCORPIA Chinks h The Armor ADVENTURE/RPG NVIL OF DAWN does have a few bugs (seemingly inevitable these days), although overall it was pretty smooth sailing. Because HMI forgot to tell New World about a couple of things, Gravis owners will get voice and effects, but no music. This can be worked around by running Soundblaster emulation instead. Something more serious is what happens after you take out the Castellan in the Evil Stronghold. As you run the cursor over the expired prisoner, a talk balloon (indicating conversation) comes up. If you click the mouse, the game will go into a permanent hang, and the only way out is to reboot entirely. New World is aware of these problems, and by the time you read this, a patch should be available, both directly from them and on the nets, to correct the problems. I've already checked out the Gravis fix, and the music is much better with real Gravis support. substitute for patience and thoroughness. There is a lot to get through, so take your time, and always keep an eye on the map. It's interesting when your character encounters one of the other four champions during the quest. Perhaps not surprisingly, they aren't doing so well, and some, indeed, are almost dead when you meet them. They do, however, usually last long enough to give you something or tell you something, which is thoughtful of them. Voice-overs in the game are done well. People have actual conversations here, as opposed to the usual melodramatic declamations that occur in so many other products. Emotions are expressed, but not in an overblown, hammy way. You can listen to it all without cringing The music is also good. There is a different tune for each dungeon, and the tunes are varied enough so that they usually don't get on your nerves. The music is also well-matched to the particular area. When you finally reach the penultimate moment when you confront 'The Warlord, it may surprise you. If you expected the usual raving maniac, \"I'm going to rule the world, and you can't stop me, hahaha!\" hysteric, our baddie here is Mr. Cool, calm and rather seductive. The experience is very much like Darth Vader and the Emperor trying to bring Luke over to the dark side. The entire ending is a refreshing change of pace from the usual shenanigans that go on at this moment, although some may be shocked by it. Another nice touch is the Black Charl. the Dwarf who forges the special containcr you need. His hand is neither out for money, nor does he have some silly errand for you to perform. As he says, \"The price is the good. The more difficult the task, the more good it must do in the world.\" When was the last time we came across something like this?

SUMMONING, especially in its reliance on floor plates, teleporters, and rolling boulders for the majority of puzzles. Fortunately, these are simpler to figure out, although by now, we'd expect that Dreamforge could have come up with a little more varicty. As it is, the weigh-theplates, bop-several times-into-a-teleporter, dash-past-the-rolling-boulder stuff becomes old pretty quickly Players hoping to run a cavy-duty magic user will be disappointed. As mentioned carlier, the better spells are costly, and power regeneration is slow. There are altars to restore power, but they are not always convenient. Likewise, the magic plants can restore power, but they don't retum much. Inevitably, you'll be spend ing a lot of time just standing around in a safe place, reading a book while you wait for the points to come back. In addition, there are certain areas where magic won't work, or spell reflectors are in the way, so only melee combat is possible. Skimping too much on fighting skills can thus lead to problems; even the strongest mages will need to be good with a sword. It would also have been nice to have at least some idea of how much damage the offensive spells were capable of doing. While you know the damage potential of the weapons, there is no information at all about the spells, which is an amazing omission. There is no way to sidestep, so combat technique is limited to swinging at an opponent, then quickly stepping back to avoid the return strike, then stepping for ward to continue the battle. It's not always possible to do that, though, and the ability to move off to the side would have been very helpful in confined areas, or when facing multiple opponents. The documentation is in error with regard to magic amulets. While the manual says the amulets Â«permanently\" increase stals, this is not the case. An amulet provides an increase only while being wom, and of course, you can only wear one amulet at a time. Overall, ANVIL OF DAWN is a dungeon pomp with several points of interest, and a couple of pleasant surprises. While there were annoying moments --Dreamforge is still too fond of floor plates, and the magic system needs some tweaking did enjoy playing the game. It was also nice to see a product that clien't have those overused words dark,\" \"dungeon,\" or \"keep\" in the title! E What you fear, you will covet. What you loathe, you will worship. What you ravage, you will rule. What you are, you will abandon. The first net-capable, intergalactic, PC CD-ROM game of ultimate strategy. You've been warned. Circle Reader Service #77 "


"SCORPIA'S MAIL Quest Busters ADVENTURE/RPG Scorpia Shows You How To Get On With The Journey the stairs first, heh). After you've obtained a certain item down there, the Faith door will open for you. STAR TREK: A FINAL Untly: Some adventurers are having a little trouble with a certain power generator on Allanor. This one is a bit tricky, but not too tough, really It's an instance where some violence will be necessary... after you've taken the necessary precautions to avoid blowing your self up. Drain a little off the top, as it were. or place the tip more than once for the black gate to appear. ENTOMORPH: 'The Queen Bee in the hive is a difficult prospect (just seeing how big she is may be enough to daunt some people!). It's entirely possible that you won't be able to kill her in the first encounter, especially at higher difficulty levels. If that's the case, don't despair, and don't try to win the first time around. When your bee is killed, simply call in elp! Help! I'm drowwwning! Wow, is there a lot of stuff out this Christmas! There hasn't been so much new product crowding the shelves in a long time. After years of occasional releases, we're suddenly inundated with games, and it's going to be hard keeping up with it for awhile. On the other hand, everything is hitting at once, and just as this column is going to press, so there's not been time yet for questions about the newer arrivals to come in (although I'm sure that mail will be picking up a bit in the near future. Gulp!). Which means that this month, we're still looking at letters about the older games. Before we get to that, though, a reminder to readers outside the United States: please remember to include your retum address somewhere in your letter. There's no way I can send you a reply if I don't know where you are. Not too long ago, a letter came in from Rianto S. in Indonesia, and he's still waiting for an answer, because no return address was included. So be sure to put that in somewhere before you send off any questions. And now, on to the good stuff! LANDS OF LORE: This game certainly has some staying power, and it seems a lot of people playing it these days are getting stuck in the same places. One of those is the Faith door on level 3 of the White Tower. First, the room beyond doesn't have anything vital in it, so if you want to skip that, you can do so without worrying about missing something important. However, if you want to check it out (there are some goodies in there, but save before you touch anything!), you'll need to prove your faith first. That can be done downstairs in the basement (of course, you'll have to find the key for the door to Use tricorder on door DATA, OPEN THE DAMN DOOR If you're stuck outside the generator room on Allanor, try jamming it open with something pointy when the droid comes through. ULTIMA VIII â PAGAN: The endgame, where you place blackrock fragments on the giant pentagram, has proved puzzling to several players (especially if they aren't playing the patched version, which gives a little help here). First, keep in mind that the fragments all have to be placed in the right spots on the diagram; you can't just set them down on any point. There is a relation between where you cnergized the pieces and where you put them on the pentagram. Second, the tip should be energized and placed last. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to click another one and go back to the fray. Eventually, you'll wear the queen down and take her out. DISCWORLD: Plenty of questions about this game, and no wonder; it's certainly one of the tougher adventures to come along in awhile. Many have trouble in Act 1, trying to get into places that are closed. Generally, you can figure that if there's no way in, then there's just no way in during that Act. Some locations (such as the Inn) only open later in the game. Speaking of later in the game, if you're having trouble with getting into Shades, maybe you need FEBRUARY 1996 "

"SCORPIA'S MAIL 9 d it nINI| 0 | to visit the palace and have a chat with someone there. RETURN TO ZORK: Another game that just keeps hanging in there. Some folks are having a bit of difficulty locating the final piece of the Disk of Frobozz. \"This one is hidden, and it will take violent action to reveal it. I hope I'm not boaring anyone here; or are you lost in the woods? RAVENLOFT II: STONE PROPHET: Sometimes, people are just too cager to go everywhere and see everything all at oncc. It doesn't work that way in this game. For instance, getting into the Sphinx takes awhile, because you have to do the underground chambers of the Harvest Temple first and before that, you have to mess around in the Temple of Set). Likewise, reaching the Temple of Ra means doing the Sphinx first. And you'll need to do both the Harvest Temple and the Troll hangout before you can do any thing with the Royal Burial Hall. So do take your time here, and complete what's open first. Otherwise, you may wander around that desert for a long time! PRISONER OF ICE: Naturally, you'd like to escape from that cell in Schlossadler Base before you come to a sorry end. So would anyone, after all, there's a world to be saved. However, it isn't quite so easy as it looks. First, you'll have to wait for Dietrich to show up and make his little proposition. Then you have to move quickly, because time will be short. A diversion is necessary, and that paper you got from Dietrich will help, if you use it in the right place (luckily, there aren't many to choose from). Next is dealing with the guard, which shouldn't be too hard (don't sit down on the job here). I don't recommend using the front door to leave, though; it's better to (ahem) vent your frustrations elsewhere. THUNDERSCAPE: In the Radiant Keep, on the third level, you may find yourself in a room without an exit (the door closes when you pull a lever, which you have to do). Sorry to say, you're gonna have to do some jumping to get out of here. You can try going up the short stairs to the ledge and leaping over to the other side, or you can try for the big block suspended in the middle of the room. I had more luck with the block, using a running jump to reach the top. That one is a matter of timing, and it will probably take several tries. Remember to be upright (not in crouching mode) whichever place you're trying to reach. And that's about it for this look in the mailbag.

Peeling a lot like a kid with an early Christmas present, I went straight for the game, deciding to pass over (for the nonce) the enclosed novella, Tliera Awakening. I wasn't disappointed, because there was more than enough story in the beginning sequences to whct my appetite for the game. The city of Stonekeep is shown being swallowed up by a darkness beyond which you see the perpc trator of the evil deed, the Shadowking. Only one boy, Drake, survives, being whisked away in the nick of time by a mysterious, cloaked figure. When Drake returns ten years later to the site of the devastation, a vision of a lovely goddess appears before him. Thera, the goddess of Earth, tells Drake that he must descend to the lost city and retrieve the nine receptacles (these are orbs) in order to free Stonekeep and her. To keep him safe, she frees his spirit from his body and sends it down into the lost city where the adventure begins. 120||1|2|160180109 as two-dimensional representations.

It is most definitely worth playing for its delightful characters alone, but it can also be enjoyed as an old fashioned, fun dungeon romp with monsters to kill, treasures to find, traps to spring and puzzles to solve. Even with the long, long wait, this game is well worth the time for any RPG fan. & DEARLISHHH. WE DON'T WANT TO WAKE IT! SHOW SOME SENSE, MAN Your companions have half a brain (unlike many RPGs). Here, Farli the dwarf suggests that you let sleeping dragons lie. rible law, but STONEKEEP manages to overcome this weakness with an intriguing story line and charming characters. Given the limitations inherent in trying to tell a story on scrolls and in one or two sentences tillered by characters now and then, STONEKEEP's story is well told. Tivo great worlds battle, with Earth caught in the middle, and the gods themselves imprisoned, as the power of the Shadowking increases.

It is these characters and their storics that really redeem STONEKEEP from its limitations in role-playing options. Like most games, STONEKEEP suffers from a few (some important) bugs.

PROS: Charming story line and characters, nicely written dialogues, lots of levels, spells, puzzles and objects de fun all combine to make for an enjoyable role-playing game.

"THE DIG REVIEW DIFFICULTY LEVEL Spielberg's Comet ADVENTURE/RPG Looking Through THE DIG's 2-Year Vapor Trail Reveals A Good Game Underneath by Martin E. Cirulis SF games take a long time coming these days (think MECH WARRIOR 2), it's not that unusual that LucasArts' ligli-brow adventure is only now seeing the light. Certainly few computer games have such a distinguished pedigree: George Lucas company, a Steven Spielberg story, dialogue by Orson Scott Card, even a novelization from Alam Dean Foster. While I usually avoid prerelease buzz, I will admit that I anticipated THE Dic, and to be honest, I wasn't disappointed. Unfortunately, what we might have here is a game too good for its genre. DESERT SPACE-ISLE The attention to sound, backgrounds and other details make you feel as though you really are marooned on an alien world. DIG THE SKY IS FALLING...AGAIN! The Dic begins with a clichÃ© of SF computer games: a mega-asteroid is on a collision course with the Big Blue Marble and unless something is done quickly, it'll be cockroaches sitting in a theatre watching Homo Sapiens Park in a few million years. As Boston Low, the NASA mission Commander, you must take a crew of experts up in a modified shuttle-craft lo nuke the incoming rock into a kinder, gentler orbit. While the mission requires five specialists to succeed, only three will venture down to the asteroid surface. You and two others, a gutsy woman reporter and a slightly superior-sounding Germanic archeologist are assigned to plant the warheads. Though the rationale for sending such an eclectic group instead of a SEAL demo team is a thin one, you'll be willing to suspend a little disbelief as things unfold. For some, just getting there and deflecting the killer rock would be adventure enough, but for this game it barely rates as a first act. I think I'll be giving nothing away when I tell you that things really start after you deflect the asteroid into orbit, when your excursion team ventures back down to the blasted surface out of plain of curiosity. Once there, you \" lig\" around a bit and find yourself in an ET version of \"Mousetrap.\" In reality, the killer rock is an Alien IQ test for the Earth and you pass it with flying colors. Unfortunately, your prize is an apparently one-way trip to another world, courtesy of the asteroid, which turns into an FTL starship and takes you to a place \"far, far away.\" (And Â«long, long ago,\" if you're a fan of relativity.) From the moment your \"ship\" evaporates around you and you are grected by nothing except blowing sand, high mountains and two strange moons in the skyyou and your team realize that not only are you not in Kansas anymore, but the ncarest McDonalds is probably not within space-shuttle distance. Once you accept that you're on your own, the party must determine the secrets of this alien base while avoiding such trivialities as starvation, dehydration and just plain old accidental cleath. After you get the hang of the arca and receive help from an ET ghost/tour-guide, you begin to rcalize that, while the place seems abandoned, it once served a purpose of galactic import-and if you can just figuire things out, not only might you find a way to get home, you may just change the path of Humanity itself. Of course, things are never straightforward, and along the way you discover that your companions Price: $44.95 System Requirements: 486DX2-66 or better, 8 MB RAM, VGA graphics, 1 MB hard drive space, 2x CD-ROM mouse; supports most major sound cards.

"REVIEW THE DIG ADVENTURE/RPG grossly unrealistic? In fact, the interaction between you and your two crewmates is touted as a strength, but it actually weakens the game. Going through it solo would have actually enhanced the experience, by not slamming you against character motivations and conversations that reflect game mechanics instead of the story. The heightened realism of the story also clashes with the puzzles themselves, mostly because of the preconceptions built by playing more traditional adventurc games. Most experienced gamers are used to a \"cold, warm, hot\" response when we work with an adventure puzzle. If you are on the right track, even if you haven't done everything you need to do, there should be some visual or sound hint that you are getting warm. This admittedly unrealistic convention is lacking in many of the more complex problems in this game, and they are much more difficult to solve because of it. Gamers should beware of abandoning a seemingly right idea just because there is no result at all tweak your plan a bit and try again. may have different ideas on how to do with impressive detail for its low-resoluthings and what's important to the species. tion, and the alien technology is consistent and visually fascinating.

"SNEAK PREVIEW TERRA NOVA NOTI)V Combat Unlimited TERRA Nova Makes Final Preparations To Blow Open 3-D Gaming by George Jones BENESSEREWONER SNEAK GPREVIEW ost software developers would love for their product to be described as \"The Thinking Man's DOOM.Â» But the game designers at Looking Class Technologies aren't happy with that description of their newest game, TERRA NOVA: STRIKE FORCE CENTAURI. Came Constructor Art Min will tell you, quite seriously, \"We do not want to be described as that. Our product is much, much GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT more.\" HEDGING EVIL TERRA Nova's full-screen view maximizes the action, but still provides vital statistics at the top of the screen. And they're right. As much as we all like to define product in terms of other products, TERRA Nova defies this sort of description (not that there's anting wrong with Doom). But I'll try anyway.

Your task is to drive the forces of a corrupt Earth --multitudes of pirates and totalitarian Hegemony forces-out of your clan's newly-formed slice of the pic. Outnumbered as you may be, you've got two things going for you: your Power Battle Armor (PBA) -the most sophisticated assault-wear for its time, and your finely-trained squadron. Advance through the missions, which vary in their objectives and difficulty, and you'll gain more sophisticated weaponry along the way: Win it all and you'll be a AP.10 BOKS WEAPON STATUE MISSILE LAUNCHER ands such as \"attack my target\" and \"retreat.\" In TERRA NOVA you'll be able to draw out specific missions for individual members of your squad (who have different strengths and weaknesses) by clicking on their icon and creating waypoints, issuing offensive or defensive commands cach step of the way. This simple addition completely changes the scale of the game. In one mission, for example, you're charged with taking out a supply cavalcade driving a canyon route toward a bridge. In most games you'd have to move toward the enemy and engage them in order to get your team into the battle. In TERRA NOVA, however, we were able to give two troopcrs orders to flank the enemy and one trooper orders to engage from above; we took out the bridge to halt their progress. During the course of a battle you can also order squad members into various modes, like berserk, advance and retrcat.

Jump Jets can be attached to squaddlies to give them greater mobility, and special weapons, like the railgun, can permanently destroy enemy armor.

TERRA NOVA appears to be one of those rare games that, long after you've been impressed with the graphics and heart-pounding action will continue to drawn you in. There's that much depth, particularly with the future possibility of expansion packs. \"Thinking man's Doom\" indeed. FEBRUARY 1996 "

"HEXEN STRATEGY Hexing Hexen ACTION How To Become A Hexen Hero In Three Painful Steps by Hank Leukart illy mortal. You just had to have Raven's new 3-D game, didn't you? Despite repeated warnings from loved ones, employees and parents, you had to buy Hexen. And now look at you. Drooling, stuttering, pathetic fool. You had no idea what you were getting into. This is not the mindless death and destruction experience Doom was. This is something entirely different, and now you, like many others are stuck right smack dab in the middle of it. Silly human-your type never learn... Fans of 3-D games who didn't hesitate in picking up Hexen may have been pleasantly surprised to find that it differs significantly from most other 3-D titles. The action is still there, but a whole new level of depth and difficulty has been ackled. There are five episodes of Hexen and an epilogue, cach with a funky blend of puzzles and hazards, some of which are casily worthy of a good role-playing game. For those of you who are having some trouble getting through it all, here's a partial walkthrough Note: In order to be as efficient as possible, I've avoided using the \"M\" word (as in monster). I'm confident you'll know what to do with them when you find them. 91000 SEVEN PORTALS The first cpisode of l lexen, Seven Portals, essentially entails two \"levels\": The Winnowing Halland The Seven Portals. All you have to in the first level is ring a bell, while the second requires a little more thinking. Let's go Winnowing Hall: In The Winnowing Hall, the primary goal is to ring the bell in the bell tower to the south. This can be fairly casily accomplished in three steps. First, you need to find the Emerald Key. Break the stained-glass windows in the chapel; one has a passage behind it that leads to a switch. Hit this switch and a pillar in the center of the chapel will lower to reveal the key. Use the Emerald Key to open the green door: You'll find a switch on the other side of the door. Push it and PIGO 126 UW 301 FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS Ring the bell to open the portal in the center of the chapel in Winnowing Hall. head over to the tower in the south. Once you get there, a switch will rise from the floor that will open a door in the bell tower courtyard. Grab the key in here, open the door to the bell tower, climb up to the top and ring the bell. This will open the teleporter in the chapel that will bring you to The Seven Portals. The Seven Portals: 'The Seven Portals consists of seven gates, which I'll refer to in clockwise order, starting with the one on your left. Each gate leads to an individual sub-level. You'll have to hit 'em all to finish. The first and only) gate you can open is gate number 2: do this by flipping the switch on the pillar near it.

"GEORGE JONES SPORTS Nixon stole second with two outs, ask yourself how you know that. You might be amazed. While on the subject of real-life sports, I had a rather eerie experience recently coaching my Oakland Raiders squad in FRONT PACE SPORTS FOOTBALL 96 (Sierra). The Raiders, as usual, have been one of the more frustrating teams in the NFL this season. Inconsistency, penalties and poor play have been their banc all year. So when the latest version of FPSF rolled into the office, I quickly seized it, intending to rewrite a frustrating chapter in Raider history at least for 1995-96. Wrong, I just finished one of the most frustrating electronic seasons ever. All year long, my Raiders were plagued by you guessed it -erratic play, injuries and penalties, penalties, penalties. The defense worked well, the offense sputtered, and I was lucky to drag my team into the playoffs with a 10-6 record (sound familiar?), at which point we quickly lost to the Buffalo Bills in the first round amidst freezing cold weather. I was up 143, but the turning point came late in the 3rd quarter. Jeff Hosteller, my quarterback, was sacked (for the 5th time) and fumbled the ball, and the Bills scored on a one yard run after a really dumb defensive pass interference penalty on James Trapp. And then they scored again. All in a day's work for the Raiders... damn. For the gridiron low-clown, stay tuned for next month's reviews of FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL 96 and Unnecessary Roughness 96.

"DENNY ATKIN  SIMULATION/SPACE su Wat ing No More ing Flying Solo sim that AIR WARRIOR 2.0 Invades The Online Skies ir combat simulations just aren't that realistic. Despite the advent of striking 3-D, textured graphics, CD-quality sounds, and ultra-fast processors that can handle deadly-accurate flight models and challenging Al, there's still an element of predictability in air combat sims that gives the experience a mechanical, inhuman feel. Computer pilots just don't fly like the real thing character from Wes/World: it pursues you with clogged determination, executes its maneuvers with flawless accuracy, and doesn't give up until it's blown to smithereens. In real combat, the pilots you encounter aren't always going to pick the perfect counter-maneuver to your Immelman, and not all of them can stick to your tail like glue. Even the best pilots aren't likely to stick around in the fight if their engines are pouring out smoke and fuel is spewing out holes in their wings. Nope, they're going to turn tail and head for home, hoping to safely come back and finish the fight another day. Certainly, there are difficulty levels in many games that cause pilots not to fly as well as they can, but the fact remains that so far no sim has succeeded in capturing the feel of real, human opponents. That's where the multiplayer sim comes in. If you've only flown against computer pilots, you only think you've experienced fun and excitement. Part of the thrill is the competitive game-knowi ng there's a real person whose day you're ruining with your superb flying skills. But what's really exciting is the unpredictable nature of a real human's flying fleshy opponents don't always react the way you'd expect them to. There's also the camaraderic of flying with human teammates--although it can be fun to take out a target with computerized wingmen, you can't invite them out for a brewski later to celebrate and relive the victory.

WARRIORS OF A KIND One of the first games to truly capture the excitement of multiplayer air combat was Kesmai's Air WARRIOR. This multiplayer, World War II air combat simulation first appeared on the CEnie online network. Players with PCs, Macs, Amigas, and Atari STs could download a front-end program that essentially amounted to a combination simple flight simulator and terminal program. You could practice flying (but not combat) offline, then log on and try your luck against real human pilots. The effect was amazing-as well as amazingly frustrating for some. AIR FEBRUARY 1996 "

Concentrate too much on one bandit, and another will surely be moving in on your six. ARMED AND DANGEROUS The weapons modeling --everything from guidance systems to missile intercept trajectories to gravity drop of ballistic weapons--is top notch. Over 35 types of aircraft ordnance are provided, and air defense systems are equally varied, including nine kinds of AM and 13 SAM launcher types. If this array of air defenses doesn't frighten you, it should the combat environment in Su-27 FLANKER is extraordinarily deadly. Part of the danger comes from your realistically modeled missile launch detector that only sounds if a rocke t motor is burning while in range of the system. Missiles fired from far away won't FEAR OF FLYING Despite the somewhat retro graphics, Su-27 does a good job of immersing you in the combat environment. Sitting at the end of the runway, the nose dips as rising engine thrust strains against the wheel brakes. Release the brakes and the nose bobs back up as your Flanker quickly gains speed. Pull up at 300 km/h and you're airborne, reacly to experience the most realistic flight model of any jet fighter simulation made for the PC. But don't let this intimidate you --the Su-27 is a snap to fly. The feel is fluid, yet stable and damped. Pointing the plane where you want to go is casy enough, yet it doesn't feel like it's riding on rails. Altitude and ordnance load affect acceleration and turn performance as expect3)VASINOTINIONIS loseSight, lose The Fight cd. Su-27 FLANKER's flight model also excels near the edge of the envelopeand beyond. Accelerated stalls (pulling past the stall angle of attack while going faster than level stall speed) and spins are exceptionally well done, and other rarelycncountered effects such as roll reversal and procession are also modeled. THE SILENT TREATMENT Flying alone all the time isn't much fun, and in Su-27 FLANKER you don't have to. Up to three wingmen may accompany you on your missions, and you will often run across other friendly aircraft intent on their own tasks. But as there are no digitized voices or even text messages from other aircraft, you may feel like you're by yourself anyway; sound effects in general are weak in this sim. There are few commands you can issue to your wingmen, and your ability to control each individually is limited. The artificial intelligence of your wingmen and all computer-controlled aircraft is very good, however. Computer pilots make extensive use of the vertical, and usually manage their energy effectively. Enemy flights use team tactics aggressivehe flexibility of a cockpit view system can make or break a flight sim-you can't dogfight what you can't see. Su-27 FLANKER gives you 42 fixed overlapping view angles you can pan between and a padlock view that tracks your target automatically. Despite the large set of views. Vou have a 180-degree blind spot to the rear due to the Su-27's canopy placement and bulky ejection seat. The real plane has rearview mirrors to minimize the blind spot, but they did not make it into the initial release of the game. (They should be available in the Su-27 1.1 patch.) If you manage to padlock your target and then lose it in the blind spot, your view will freeze in that direction. Don't panic and start panning around trying to reacquire him; just keep turning. If you can bring him back into view in the next few seconds, padlock tracking will resume. You'll know the padlock view has given up when you're booted back to the default forward view. Even when your target is not in your blind spot, it's easy to lose track of where you're looking and become disoriented. The solution comes from the Su-27's helmet-mounted display. Whenever your view is shifted so the HUD is no longer visible, a compact overlay appears, displaying critical flight information. The overlay's offset from the center of the screen corresponds to the direction and angular distance between where you're looking and straight ahead, so you always know which way you're facing.

"REVIEW  STAR RANGERS DIFFICULTY LEVEL SIMULATION/SPACE Star Raiders Redux Recipe For Action: Take One Part Space Combat, Add A Pinch Of Strategy, Sprinkle With A Dash Of Nostalgia by Scott A. May ostalgia alert! Drop shields and prepare to dock with a classic game. Interactive Magic's STAR RANGERS is an unofficial tribute to the timeless Atari 400/800 classic, Star RAIDERS. The bells and whistles may reflect present day expectations, but the basic gameplay remains true to the original. Except this time, you're not facing ultralow-res TIE FICHTER-wannabees, but rather WING COMMANDER IV-esqe, 3-D space fighters. Alas, tributes are only effective if today's audience remembers yesterday's achievements. That said, STAR RANGERS' ode to the origins of electronic gaming may be lost on players cutting their galactic teeth on Origin's WING COMMANDER series or LucasArts X-WING.

"REVIEW. STAR RANGERS CI G AG   Wow 1 scottatured Marted SIMULATION/SPACE coded Xs and dots, but not terribly intuitive. Flanking the radar display are gauges showing current throttle, velocity, shield and energy levels. A multifunction display serves triple duty for communications, damage assessment and energy management systems. Finally, the targeting system.. Vector images of ships currently targeted show orientation, shield strength, speed and distance. Consult this display to avoid wasting ships you're supposed to be protecting. before ascending to the next. The designers compensate somewhat for this by randomly generating key parameters for each mission, changing the location and movement of friends and foes. It's a superficial fix for a fundamental problem: Campaigns should progress along a branching storyline, with cach success or failure determining the ultimate outcome. Here, campaign mode is simply a smoke screen for arcade-style play levels. Hit the ceiling of your present abilities and the game simply stalls. BUT WHERE'S HOBBES? Choosing a good wingman pays off-you can actually send him off on his own to dispatch the more wimpy threats. STAR PATROLS Campaign mode launches a series of 17 self-contained missions, each with unique circumstances, goals and difficulty levels. Choose one of five wingmen lo accompany you (three male and two female). Urgent orders for assistance often require warping from one section of the quadrant to another, using a strategic map to pinpoint your desired destination. You can expand the scope of the quadrant map by dropping transponders during flight. Warping involves a short but wild ride through a wormhole tunnel. The accuracy of your warp, along with energy depletion, is affected by your ability to navigate this narrow corridor. The game's key strategy elements involve managing your ship's limited energy resources, while deciding which sector hot spots require immediate attention. If the threat is slight, order a wingmento warp into combat and return when finished. As your ship incurs damage, use the energy management system to route energy from your guns to the shields, or vice versa. As the hull weakens and energy drains, dock at a friendly space station to replenish your systems. Space combat is fast and frenzied. A fully functional HUD fills the main cockpit display with more information than some joystick jockeys probably care to know: missile locks, target designator, pitch/bank and directional indicators. velocity and throttle readouts, closing speed and intercept times. The action zips along at such breakneck pace, however, there's little time to appreciate such attention to detail. For rookie pilots, two inflight options help ease the burden of combat stamina: Combat Autopilot tracks the currently targeted craft, and Match Speed mode matches your speed to the target's if it's within 300 meters. Most of the game's option menus deal with graphic detail and screen resolution. Here you can toggle ship texture mapping, Couraud shading, background details and prelight cinematics. Actions sequences can be viewed in either high (640 x 480) or low (320 x 240) resolutions. Another important option allows you to switch between arcade-style versus flightsim joystick orientation. The game's greatest weakest is the nature of its linear campaign mode. Each mission must be successfully completed ONLY BLAST-ADDICTS NEED APPLY The game also suffers from a lack of personality. There's no background story or between-scene cinematics to suggest the player is part of some larger, robust space adventure. Indeed, compared to other efforts in the genre, this game seems oddly incomplete. Space combat alone may have enthralled players 15 years ago, but today's audience expects something much substantial more \"Hollywood.\" Perhaps there are players who dislike the cinematic approach, who would rather be vaporizing aliens than following some contrived space opera. If that's the case, warp on over and begin blasting. Truth be told, STAR RANGERS begs to be more than it is. The nostalgia factor makes for a fine curio, but won't sell to today's sophisticated market. Though technically adept and stylistically exciting, an overall lack of ambiance renders the game little more than a simple space shooter APPEAL: Space combat fans who find cinematic interludes annoying; anyone who's waited 15 years for an update of Star Raiders. >PROS: White-knuckle space combat coupled with intriguing strategy elements. SVGA graphics and atmospheric sound effects are a plus. Excellent joystick support. CONS: Lacks personality. Linear campaign mode hampers longterm player involvement. Combat sequences are well-designed, but repetitious. DIG THAT WORMHOLE Warping from sector to sector requires traveling through a wormhole; imprecise navigation will leave you far from your desired location. RATED CC FEBRUARY 1996 "

"ALLEN EMRICH  STRATEGY/WARGAMES Stratiesy The Wings geng Of War man japp Mastery Of Flank Attacks Is The Most Decisive Route To Victory com by Alan Emrich lthough there is much to be said about military maneuvers, the most difficult invariably, are those executed on the battlcficld. From ancient to modern times, battles commenced when two forces would line up in opposition, cach seeking to defeat the other. Since the shortest distance between two points remains a straight line, the natural tendency was for each army to launch into a full, frontal assault, thus spawning the standard battlefield maneuvers of the \"charge\" and its antithesis: \"stand.\" These unimaginative ploys have lead to many bloody, and often inconclusive, battles. Before the trench lines of WWI extended across entire fronts, armies were deployed along roughly parallel lines, cach with a center and two flanks (left and right). Superior commanders would try to anchor their flanks along difficult terrain (rivers, woods, ctc.), but few natural barriers are impassable to armies. Thus, the flanks of a force are often exposed to potential enemy maneuvers. STRENGTH VERSUS WEAKNESS It wasn't long before wise field commanders added an attack upon the e nemy's flanks to their book of battlefield maneuvers. When successfully executed, this maneuver often proved decisive. Why? The cold logic is revealing the goal is to direct your strongest attack capability against the enemy's weakest position least able to counterattack-the classic con11 A wellexecuted flank maneuver could just turn the enemy's line and also turn history on its side! BRIEFINGS  HPS Simulations has developed three campaign disks for PANTHERS IN THE SHADOWS. They include: INTO THE CAULDRON (4th County of London Yeomanry in North Africa, 1941/1942), RACE ACROSS FRANCE (1st SS Panzer, from Operation Goodwood to the Falaise Gap, 1944), and THUNDERBOLT!

Interplay Productions is rumored to have scored the rights to do the PC version of Milton Bradley's Axis & Allies. Grolier is planning to enter the strategy games market. Partnering with new player Hyperbolic (not to be confused with Greg Roach's Hyperbole Studios), the company is planning to release BATTLE OF THE IRONCLADS (naval action during the War Between The States) and BATTLESHIPS OF STONE (where the player works with the king's architect in order to build the most efficient castle).  I've discovered two great new scenarios. The first comes from Nicholas Bell (72162.1667@ compuserve.com) with a file name of BARANOV.ZIP. Here you have a TIGERS ON THE PROWL scenario where the beleaguered 3rd Panzer Division counterattacks lead elements of the Soviet 1st Guard Tank Army on August 16th, 1944. Two full-strength Panzer V companies with supporting arms attack Russians of unknown strength holding a town and bridges. The other don't miss scenario (TOLKIEN.

It could be the best turn your forces ever make & HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC: Short of finding an artifact, you can increase your hero's movement rate by simply exchanging all his troops for only fast units. Your hero moves only as fast as the slowest unit in his band. Thus, if your hero has a paladin, a few horsemen, and some ogres, then he only moves at the ogres slow pace. Get rid of the ogres, and the yellow movement bar by your hero's portrait will jump to full the next turn and stay there until you saddle him with some slower troops. STEEL PANTHERS: To set up an infantry trap against armor, set your range to 1 since close combat occurs at 1 hex distance, not 0. Zero range is useless unless you want your snipers to stay unspotted in a tree hex. Use engineers against tanks that come into range because they can blow off almost any tanks with flamethrowers and satchel charges. Use your infantry in reverse slope condition in order to avoid enemy concentration of fire once they are detected. CG FEBRUARY 1996 "


"Yamaha sounds best, whether you play here... or here. Ti On stage or on CD, Yamaha instruments set the standard for the best sound quality. Now the Yamaha WaveForce DB50XG puts all that sound on a daughter board that snaps right on to your existing Wave Blaster connector-equipped soundcard. It doesn't require any new software or messing with switches. The DB50XG instantly and dramatically improves the sound of your games, music and multimedia presentations. The DB50XG uses exclusive Yamaha Advanced Wave Memory (AWMM) technology so you're hearing actual sounds digitally stored onto 4MB of wave-ROM (that's four times the amount most other cards use). More wave-ROM means more variety and better sound quality. And these sounds are identical to the ones Yamaha puts in our highly acclaimed professional keyboards; the best sounds in the industry. GENERAL It's not just the sounds, but the superior control of them that sets the DB50XC apart. The new XG format takes control far beyond General MIDI (GM). And with major game developers implementing XG, you won't want to be stuck with a card that doesn't keep up with the times. The DB50XC will play all of your favorite GM compatible software. And with its superior sounds, it will play them better than you've ever heard before. It's amazing what a simple upgrade can do. The Yamaha Waveforce DB50XG sounds so good, you'll need to check your CD-ROM drive to make sure you're not playing an audio CD. But first you'll have to check with your favorite computer reseller.

No, it isn't that CIVILIZATION; it's a rendition of the popular and vencrable strategy board game. While the basic themes are similar, ADVANCED CIVILIZATION, from Avalon Hill, has a very different feel from Sid Meier's classic. There is no exploration, as it uses the same map every game. Instead of clog-cat-dog warfare with neighboring empires, you are encouraged to build your civilization through trade. And instead of gaining new military technology, empires strive to acquirc Arts, Crafts and Sciences that help society surmount man-made Price: $59.95 and natural calamities.

Goods have values from one to nine and are arranged in stacks according to value, somewhat like cards. If you have only one city, you get one good from the One stack. If you have three cities, you get one good from the One stack, one from the Tivo stack, and one from the Three stack; you are not only getting more cards, you're getting higher value cards. In order to get a good from the Nine stack, you must have nine cities on the board the maximum allowable in the game. The value of goods can be further increased by collecting sets of a single good. Since you can never draw two of the same good on any turn, the quickest way to get more is to trade with other players. Goods are traded in books of three, and you must state honestly what two of them are. The third may be some Good of lesser value (promise them Cloth but give them Hides), or it may be a calamity that you had the misfortune to draw. Calamities, unfortunately, hide in the same stacks as the goods, waiting to be drawn by unsuspecting players. Most of the calamities, though, can be traded, and this adds an element of risk to the otherwise beneficial trading process.

The difference Digital vs. Board Game Mechanics here are very few differences in rules and mechanics between the computer and board games. The biggest differences are in the trading phase: you always trade exactly three goods instead of three or more. This is not a big change, but it does rule out the kind of trades where a large set of a low-value good is traded for one or two higher value goods. The other difference is that trading is conducted in orderly rounds instead of in the chaotic shouting matches of face-to-face play. The number of trading rounds is variable and is set before the game begins; the default is two. Playing with only two rounds puts pressure on all players to get offers on the table or miss out, but at least the whole affair is more civilized. Bigger differences occur when playing by e-mail (PBEM). In this mode, all players must be human, so you are limited to the number of partners you can find. One of the players controls the game; files must be sent and received from each player. To reduce the number of exchanges, movement is conducted by all players simultaneously, which changes the feel of the game quite a bit. I did have considerable trouble with the game crashing in PBEM mode. If PBEM is important to you, I suggest you consult more recent information to see if this is a general problem or unique to me.

The inclusion of a city vicw, whicre you can view your domestic chores in progress makes city management more accessible. rather than a simple spreadsheet command, and the addition of technology allows for some rather interesting new weapons. Another feature is that all generals now have special abilities, in addition to their standard statistics (leadership, intelligence, and so on). Numbering over 40, these special abilities for combat and politics allow generals to set fires in combat, spy, build weapons, give added archery proficiency, and conduct myriad other The Three Kingdoms he Three Kingdoms\" is both an era in Chinese history and a popular Chinese novel, with the novel being a romanticized view of the period, with clear biases for and against certain characters. In the novel, which is fairly faithful to history, the main protagonists are Liu Bei and his two blood brothers, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu. The novel chronicles the fracturing of the Han dynasty and the rise of these three. especially Liu Bei, who eventually came to rule a third of China as an emperor of one of the Three Kingdoms. His chief rival, Cao Cao, the emperor of the Wei Kingdom, is depicted as a talented but ruthless and jealous warlord. He is clearly the villain, while Liu Bei's kingdom is depicted as the force for good. The Kingdom of Wu, ruled by Sun Quan, is neutral. In the end, the novel follows history, as both the Shu and Wu kingdoms are defeated, and Liu Bei dies an unfulfilled death. His kingdom is ruined by his son's excesses, and Cao Cao's grandson, Cao Rui, eventually unifies all of China. He is then overthrown by one of his own generals, who establishes the new Jin Dynasty, which itself only lasted a few decades. Though the tale of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a glorified chapter in Chinese history, it really was a tragic episode, in which a dynasty crumbled, and after years of fractious warfare, three kingdoms emerged to claim China as their own, only to crumble themselves after a few war-torn years. tasks. While every gencral can aid in city chores, in order to conduct external affairs and foreign plots, they must have the appropriate special ability or they will be unable to execute the desired command.

On the offensive, take advantage of natural VISIBilu 19 AnAmerican Disaster: Can You Do Better! he American attack on Sidi bou Zid, Tunisia, on February 15, 1943, is a classic study in how not to conduct offensive operations. Convinced they faced only a weak diversionary attack by the Afrika Korps, the Americans sent a tank batallion supported by tank destroyers, infantry and artillery to seize the small oasis village. Charging across 13 miles of open terrain in a parade-ground formation, relying on faulty intelligence and conducting no advanced reconaissance, the U.S. force waltzed directly into a German trap. Just outside Sidi bou Zid, the Americans encountered a steep-sided wadi (dry riverbed), an unplanned obstable that forced them to split up their formation as they crossed it. Just as their tanks were beginning to emerge from the dry riverbed, General Heinz Ziegler unleashed his panzers to first pin the American flanks and then hit them in the center with his main attack. When the battle ended, the Americans had lost 54 tanks, 57 half id horrible tracks and 29 guns. A tactical situation based on the battle at Sidi bou Zid was created using the Steel Panthers scenario editor. The scenario, which can be found in this issue's CG-ROM, starts with the Americans approaching the wadi outside Sidi bou Zid. After crossing the wadi, the U.S. units are attacked by the Germans before they can reorganize. When the main German attack hits the American center, superior gunnery gives the Afrika Korps the advantage. The Germans smash the American main attack and cross the wadi to mop up what remains of the U.S.force. Can you do better than the American commander at Sidi bou Zid?

"STEEL PANTHERS STRATEGY important role in every battle. On the offensive, cach lead tank or AFV should always carry an infantry squad to protect it from ambush by enemy infantry and to assist in spotting enemy units. Dismount your infantry five or six hexes short of a defensive position and have it precede the armored vehicles into an objective area to locate mines, dug-in troops and anti-tank guns. This is often hard on the infantry, but infantry losses during a campaign are far easier to replace than AFVs and their experienced crews. During defensive missions, infantry deployed around or in victory hex arcas, especially when equipped with bazookas, satchel charges or flame throwers, can prove lethal to attacking chemy AFVs. Infantry small-arms fire will also suppress armored vehicles, reducing their combat effectiveness. Because German infantry is well-equipped with anti-tank weaponry from 1943 on, the American infantry's greatest challenge is keeping enemy troops away from U.S. armor. ON THE WAY, SIR! self-propelled artillery units are extremely The Americans are blessed with a wide useful vehicles because they can serve variety of artillery and there's usually plennot only as indirect fire artillery, but also ty of it, ranging from offshore ships to offin the direct-fire mode, where their largemap artillery batteries to on-map, self-procaliber, high-explosive shells wreak havoc pelled artillery units.

"STRATEGY. STEEL PANTHERS STRATEGYZ WARGAMES on soft targets. The trick to successfully using artillery is to get it on target as quickly and accurately as possible. Although any unit can call in and spot for artillery, leader units usually experience shorter delays. Your overall command unit (AO) often gets artillery support more quickly than its subAttack Strength Modifier's Terrain Circumstance Hard Cover Dug-in Hard Cover Positioned or pinned ordinate commanders. One method available to get artillery fire with no turn delays is to use the command unit of an on-map self-propelled artillery section to call in the fire. The subordinate unit in the section will fire with a one-tum delay. By firing several sections in this manner, it's possible to lay down a withering artillery barrage very quickly. Although artillery bombardment can be plotted on unsighted hexes, it's generally far more accurate when the unit calling for the fire can also see the target hex. In addition, the higher the artillery command rating of the spotting unit, the more accurate the fire will be. If you have infantry units as part of your core force, check the artillery command ratings of their leaders. Alcacer unit with an exceptional rating makes an excellent forward observer. in STEEL PANTHERS, even though closesupport aircraft are more readily available to the Americans than other nationalities, getting effective use from them can be problematic. Plotting an air strike within cight to ten hexes of friendly ground units can sometimes cause damage to your own units. If you do want air support, perhaps the best ground attack aircraft available for any nationality is the American P38 Lightning, a potent killer of tanks and light armor with its rockets, cannon and machine guns. Aircraft are best used in offensive missions where they can soften up defensive positions and perform limited reconnaissance. One effective tactic is to use air support in conjunction with artillery. Send in a lonc aircraft well ahead of your ground attack and make note of the enemy units the plane spots, anti-aircraft guns in particular. Hit the anti-aircraft units with artillery so that your aircraft can nun later bombing raids with impunity.

"STEEL PANTHERS STRATEGY your planes should also be targeted for artillery bombardment. MINE OVER MATTER Mines are most likely encountered on assault missions and can quickly bring your offensive to a grinding halt. Therefore, when buying support units prior to an assault, you should buy at least three sections of Sherman engineering vehicles and two or more platoons of engineers. Deploy your engineering vehicles in a line abreast at the head of your force with an engineer squad riding on cach vehicle. The remainder of your force should follow closely in the tracks of the lead vehicles. The engineering velhicles are far more likely to detect mines and can immediately dismount their engineer squads to begin clearing them. Having an engineer squad and a crab tank in the same hex will significantly speed up your mine-clearing operation On the defensive, mines are cheap and extremely effective weapons. If mines are available for your mission, they can be Tanks might be the queen of battle in this purchased as miscellancous support units game, but they are far more cffective at a cost of five points for every ten mines. when their efforts are coordinated with Placing two or three mines per hex artillery, air, engineering and infantry suparound the outside edges of a victory hex port, all areas in which the Americans are arca will usually produce very favorable cqual or better than other nationalities. results as enemy troops and vehicles SOFT will inevitably flock to these areas.

"SO WHATS-YOUR favorite NEW FEATURE? Designed for Microsoft Windows 95 I have to confess: My favorite is the automatic CD-Player. Whenever I pop in a music CD now, Windows just plays it. I don't have to fuss around with launching a program to do it. The CD Player does allow me to program the running order and skip tracks I don't want to hear. And the system remembers it every time. Windows 95: Making It Work For You 1-56276-288-5 $24.95 Matt Lake Co-author, Windows 95, Making It Work For You YURAN Matt Lake and Yael Li-Ron believe that Windows 95 is a system to intimidate, not to be intimidated by. Their book, Windows 95: Making It Work For You includes a comprehensive approach to Windows 95, incorporating a look at its technical structure with illustrations and a guided tour, plus a Windows Fixer section with techniques and tips for making Windows 95 do stuff it doesn't want to do!

">>> continued from page 72 Climb Behind The Wheel Controllers To Help Tame The Savage Beast by Gordon Goble NDYCAR RACING II is the first racing sim I've encountered where I honestly must say that a good joystick just won't do. For years it's been me and my trusty sidekick, the CH FlightStick together through the streets of Monaco and on the hallowed bricks at Indy. However, new and potentially deadly tracks such as INDYCAR II's Australia demand the precision and extra throw of a solid wheel and separate pedals. COMPETITION DRIVING SYSTEM I've had the pleasure of putting a few wheel/pedal combos through their paces, and with out a doubt the premier unit is Extreme Competition Controls Competition Driving System. At $439, the price tag is high, but so is the quality in this professionally appointed, nearly all-metal unit. A velour-wrapped wheel, on-the-wheel shifting and a rock solid base highlight the steering unit. The pedals are perfectly angled to fit a racing posture, with a slightly heavier brake than accelerator. This baby is noiseless, with none of that annoying springiness of other wheels. My lower lap times (particularly on road courses) and undamaged cars attest to its capabilities. You won't find this baby at your local computer superstore, though-you'll have to contact the manufactur er to buy one, at (612) 824-6733. CH PEDALS Racers who picked up the original CH Pro Pedals were none too happy when they discovered the fore-aft motion designed into the unit for airplane rudder control just wouldn't go away when on the track. CH came CH Pedals up with a solution, a pair of chocks that jammed unwanted movement. A few months ago CH introduced a better solution for racing fans: the less expensive CH Pedals, which have no fore-aft capabilities whatsoever, just normal car pedal movement. Finally, good, cheap pedals. Racing addicts may want to look elsewhere, as the CH Pedals' angle of attack is not complementary with the position you sit in to use most control wheels, but more casual gamers playing with joy. sticks and sitting in a pseudo-secretarial posture should be just fine. Extreme Competition Controls Competition Driving System FORMULA T2 Thrustmaster recently introduced its latest Formula product, the T2 wheel and pedal combo. While it's not up to the preci sion and awe. some feel of G-FORCE More flight yoke than racing wheel, Suncom's G-Force nevertheless performs just great with World Circuit and IndyCar, but a little less so in the ultra-realistic IndyCar II. Featuring a swiveling column for forelaft axis control and a U-shaped yoke handle that pivots at the base and arcs from side to side, the G Force loses some necessary precision simply because it moves in four directions. Yet CH Virtual Pilot it's a decent starter, and the built-in locking mechanism effectively prevents foreaft movements if and when pedals are added to the system. the Thrustmaster's Formula T-2 Competition Driving System, it is substantially lower priced and a step ahead of the \"let's drive a truck\" Formula T1. Noteworthy improvements include a smaller, thicker wheel more befitting racing games and rubber pedals instead of those odd little rollers on the original. Personally, I don't like the idea of a separate shifter-it requires that I take my hands off the wheel--but the unit performs pretty well. Once I'd become accustomed to that darn shifter, I felt I had a much better grip on the situation than a joystick could provide VIRTUAL PILOT The CH Virtual Pilot is yet another flight yoke that adapts for driving games. Unlike the G-Force, the Virtual Pilot's wheel attaches to its housing via a rotating shaft that pulls back and pushes forward. Unfortunately, this accelerator and braking motion is definitely far too clunky for advanced sims, and serious racers would be advised to stick with a good joystick or, ideally, move up to a full-blown wheel/pedal combo. & CG FEBRUARY 1996 "

We do hereby LONE IN THE DARK has earned a induct Betrayal at Krondor (BAK) place in the Hall of Fame into this august collection of clas. because of its creative use of sics. Raymond E. Feist's world of 3-D technology to place fantasy came to life in BAK. True to its roots as Kroncho gamers within a chilling adventure game a world created for gaming, the universe context. Its ancestor (released in this country described in Feist's best-selling books became, once again, a world as OUT OF THIS WORLD) proved that 3-D technology was useful for cinematic where characters could move, explore and define their own stories. BAK was action games, but ALONE IN THE DARK (AITD) took the experience to another full of side-quests and story character-building encounters. Even using old level. AITD combines a Lovecraftian environment with a sense of urgency by technology, the game would probably have been a success. As it was, BAK placing a 3-D character in the midst of an inexplicable incursion of the infer. was the first role playing game to offer a 3-D environment and, though the nal. Through atmospheric pacing, camera angles and innovative combat pop-up paperdoll cutout characters may not hold up to today's production modeling, the game becomes more immersive and more challenging as the values, it was one of the first games to use digitized images effectively in the player advances. IMotion was also innovative in using line of sight and context of a role playing game. Though initial sales of the game were slower maneuvering around objects as an integral part of the experience. Many than expected, fans of the Feist novels soon discovered that the universe had gamers felt AITD was the most realistic experience they had encountered in been handled thoughtfully, and even those who hadn't heard of the novels an adventure game. For attention to movement, perspective, camera angles, found that BAK offered a remarkable fantasy experience. So, BAK became a story and play balance, we recognize AITD as worthy to stand with the great benchmark for computer role-playing games, and in fact dominated the top games of all time. slot among role-playing games for a full year, since February of '95.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what hot What's the VIMEO Deal with... ma Documentation? the game doc in the first place. At least half the pages of the typical strategy book are taken up by details about game aspects and \"equipment\" that players shouldn't f you don't count the inane titles cloned from cartridge machines, computer gaming is usually a complex experience. The player is experi encing a simulation of some kind. From building a rail empire to flying high-performance jets to running a theme park, most games are trying to give you the feel of a job you probably wouldn't get a crack at in real life--and that's where the fun really is. CPA by day...dashing Air Warrior by night Of course, when you paid 50-odd bucks to be thrown into somebody else's life in the old days, you got some background and a little instruction proportional to the task ahead. If you were trying to be a space.cowboy invading planets, you got a decent manual that covered the rules, explained the game con trols and showed you what every thing cost. If you were expected to drive some intricate simulation of a real-world machine or take control of massive armies, then there usually was something more-a hefty tome in there with your floppies, a book that would make you a master of the game, if you were willing to do the reading. I even admit to hav. ing done some of my game-pur. chasing by the pound: the heavier the box, the happier I was. Unfortunately, except for brutally complex flight sims, one would be hard pressed to shop that way in today's wonderful multimedia world, where some smart suit has figured out if you cut everything that goes into the box with the game to a bare minimum, you can pay for more terrible acting for your live video sequences. While I'll agree that many adventure games and the like require minimum instruction\"Grab like this, talk like this\"-it seems a shame that additional materials like the classic fake newspaper or desperate diary filled with clues seem to be going the way of the dodo. I'm sure touches like these cost a bit more, and they don't catch the media's eye like a real-time starlet with breasts twice the size nature originally gave her, but they are invaluable in creating the sense of mood that distinguish. es a great game from a slow-loading B-Movie. Even worse, now games without Even worse, now games without the dubious advantages of multime. dia seem to be discovering the dol lar value of the evil duo of '90s gaming: Minimal Doc and the $20Strat Guide. . Now, I have nothing against the strategy guides per se, but what is getting to me is the fact that most guides these days are less about strategy and more about filling in the facts that should have been in ( The evil duo of '90s games is a minimal doc and the $20 strat guide. what the horde of gadgets that you discover actually do, in game terms; the game's documentation offers nothing but vague descriptions. I opened up STEEL. PANTHERS expecting to find another classic Grigsby tome filled with history and countless tables, and instead found 50-odd pages that looked like they had been run off and stapled by the kid in the SSi facilities department. As far as I am con. cerned, the little books you find in the Microprose/Sim-tex games or the one that came with MECHWARRIOR2 should be considered the minimum for any kind of complex game. One of the nicest things about CivNet was just open. ing the box, and finding a CD game with a good, hefty rulebook. Just to go over it one more time for you marketing guys out there: documentation is about telling the player everything they need to get the most out of their game. Strategy Guides are for giving players every advantage they can get to \"beat\" a game. While the latter is fun, we paid for the former the moment we slid our hard-earned bucks across the counter at the store have have to pay extra to find out about For some reason, game companies have decided that since you can fit a few instructions on a slip of paper inside the case of a CD, a player doesn't deserve more. Yeah, maybe-if software was $10 a pop. Recent strategy and wargames seem to be very cynical in this tac tic.
