We expected CompuServe to come out on top because of its reputation for software publisher support, or perhaps GEnie because of the variety of on-line games offered. But the winner among game buyers is the same as the industry leader elsewhere—America Online by almost 2:1. Also, would you expect gamers to spend an average of eight hours per week on line? I hope the results of this survey were as interesting to you as they were to me. There is much more data than space will allow here, but it's always enlightening to see how the community of gamers spends its time and money. With the sales of IBM-compatible PCs outpacing new TV sales, according to Intel, and with the avid interest gamers are showing in their hobby, it's no wonder that companies are directing ever more focused marketing efforts at you. I believe that the gaming market is poised for explosive growth in the coming years. As sales of personal computers continue to increase and compatibility problems fade with programs like Windows 95, you'll find growing numbers of people who want to experience the same things you've been enjoying for years. And that's great. But I hope that the game publishers don't lose sight of the fact that what appeals to gamers is good, challenging, replayable gameplay, I'd hate to see the creative possibilities of this technology squandered on big-budget superficiality.

The graphics, sound, interface, and, of course, the game play come together to form a Transcendent Gaming Experience. *** Very Good: A quality game that succeeds in many areas. May have minor problems, but is still worth your time and money, especially if you're interested in the subject matter/genre. ** Average: A mixed bag. Can often be a game that reaches for the stars, but falls short in significant areas. Can also just be a game that does what it does well, but lacks Nair or originality, Weak: A game with serious problems. May be buggy, may not have much play value, may be ill-conceived—and you may want to think twice about buying it. Chairman and CEO: Eric Hippeal President, Consumer Media Group: J.

"READ.ME The Unbearable Lightness Of Be, Inc. 0: 00 3 Upstart start-up Be, Incorporated, is doing the unthinkable: launching a new hardware platform in 1995, one that's completely incompatible with everything else on the market. How does Be think it can succeed this late in the game? By going after the hackers. Founded by former Apple exec JeanLouis Gassee, Be is targeting hobbyists and multimedia application developers who are looking for a machine with top-notch performance and an operating system that's not hobbled by a need to remain compatible with 10-to 15-year-old designs. The system they are designing should be on gamers' radars. The BeLan & $2 Va : Crtal we ele a ole four serial I/O ports, and three infrared controller ports. PC-standard keyboard and mouse ports, as well as three PCI and five ISA slots, means inexpensive add-ons can come from what Be calls the PC-clone organ bank.\" The Be system software supports preemptive multitasking and real-time response, combined with the dual PowerPC architecture, this means games could be amazingly responsive, since one processor can handle all the 1/0 and graphics while another is dedicated to handling Al computations. Direct video access, similar to that in Win 95, means the BeBox should offer blazing video performance. Pierre Raynaud-Richard is Be's games guru, and he says the company is definitely keeping gamers in mind: Be plans a Game Software Development Kit, OpenGL support, and various 3-D graphics options. With its multiprocessor architecture and sleek operating system, the BeBox could be the Amiga of the 90s--a hot machine that's only a minor player, but blows away everything else technologically. \"The ultimate machine for hackers, definitely,\" says Raynaud-Richard, \"and a very good machine for games.\" Denny Atkin Box hardware looks blazing: dual PowerPC 603 processors running at 66 MHz, room for up to 256MB of RAM, built-in SCSI and IDE, integrated 16bit sound, two PC-standard joystick ports, two MIDI ports, one parallel and The 64 Gigabyte 2 vision, not in a book. It bugs the hell out of me that we can't do a convincing real-world simulation That's what I really want to do. Unfortunately, we're so limited by our tools that we always end up falling back on the crutch of fantasy or science fiction. And before anyone starts screaming, let me say that I love fantasy and science fiction—I just wish we could do someWarren Spector may be best known to computer gamers as the evil Dr. Spector from MARTIAN DREAMS, a Victorian-era space opera using the ULTIMA VI engine. Yet, Spector has a lengthy pedigree as producer and designer of both traditional and computer games. Prior to coming to Origin, Spector designed Toon for Steve Jackson Games and the Buck ROGERS boardgame for TSR. At Origin, Spector has produced ULTIMAS V and VI, WINGS OF GLORY, CYBERMAGE and CRUSADER, among others, as well as designing MARTIAN DREAMS. Spector is a top-notch design talent and a worthy mind to ask the 64 Gigabyte Question: if you had no limitations in budget or computing power, what kind of game would you like to design? Over the last six and a half years, I've been involved in the creation of over a dozen games. I've produced three-quarter-overhead perspective roleplaying games, interactive movies and flight sims (and I hope to make a real-time strategy game sometime soon). I've enjoyed every last one of the games I've worked on. But of all the game's I've produced, there's one kind of game I live for—first-person, real-time POV games. When I play a really good POV (point-of-view) game, I'm there in a way I can't be in any other medium-not in movies, not on teleone can tell us that our orcs don't look or act like real orcs. Try to make a POV Die Hard and watch people scream that your state-of-the-bleeding-art game doesn't do everything just right (in other words, exactly like the way things work in the real world). Not that any of these problems are going to stop me or my colleagues here at Origin and elsewhere. I'm in this business because I know that someday I'll produce a game that is so convincing you'll have to stop and think, \"is it real or is it Memorex?\" The game world and everything in it will look just the way you expect, and you'll interact with this world in ways that mimic the real world far more effectively. You'll decide whether to walk, drive or jump out of an airplane to get where you want to go. Confronted with a hostage situation, you'll have to decide whether to shoot that terrorist or try to talk to him (and you'll really talk to him) to get him to let his hostages go. You'll get all the thrills and chills and emotional content (beyond the adrenaline rush everyone expects in games today) you expect from a fast-paced action movie with none of the actual risks. And unlike an interactive movie (which, by shifting to the third-person perspective, distances you from the action), you'll be right in the thick of things. Oh, and speaking of interactive movies, there probably won't be any live-action video in my dream game. If wanted to make movies, I'd be in Hollywood making movies. I'm after something bigger and, to my mind, cooler than that. thing else once in a while. Unfortunately, there's a little rule of the road that we just can't get around (yet): The more realistic you make your game the higher players' expectations get.

"SNEAK PREVIEWICOVER STORY MacDowell, and a brilliant performance by Tom Wilson (\"Maniac\"), along with production values never-before seen in a computer game. And, like most trilogies, WinG COMMANDER III ended with a big bang—to the tune of $4 million in production costs, and 700,000 copies sold. The Kilrathi were defeated once and for all, with peace sure to reign throughout the known galaxy. All very dramatic, and nicely sewn up. But as I approached Origin's new facilities in Austin, I wondered what they could possibly do for an encore, now that they were outside the safe confines of the best-selling game trilogy of all time. That, my friends, is the $12 Million Question... TO SEEK OUT NEW ENEMIES When WING COMMANDER IV begins, we find that Colonel Blair (Mark Hamill) has retired to be a farmer. But his idyllic lifestyle is soon interrupted when Maniac arrives to fetch the good Colonel (and thereby you) back to active duty. Did the kiltrilogy is as familiar to the modern popular artist as was a sonnet to William Shakespeare. Because of their popularity, trilogies are often criticized as too predictable, too safe, too uneven-and it's true that rarely do all the parts come together to form a cohesive, unified whole. Still, in the hands of a visionary, a trilogy is an effective art form, dramatic and accessible all at once, with the capacity to develop familiar characters through more than a single work. While it's hard to compare Chris Roberts games to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or George Lucas' Star Wars trilogies, it can be argued that the WING COMMANDER series is as close as gaming has come to a sustained body of work. When the series' detractors ask why WING COMMANDER IS so popular-a year after its release, WING COMMANDER III still stands atop the CGW Top 100 Games chart--they overlook the obvious: it's incredibly fun to feel as though you're a part of an ongoing story, especially when you are calling the shots. And while Origin's other famous series, ULTIMA, includes some wonderful games, it's also true that Wing COMMANDER has been more consistent in terms of quality-while ironically taking more chances. WC is definitely a lot more than your average space shoot-'em-up affair. Who can forget the thrill of negotiating treacherous asteroid fields to bag that first kilrathi in WING COMMANDER, or the crushing feeling when you realized that Spirit, your trusted wingman through WC I and II, was on a suicide mission—and that there was nothing you could do to save her? It certainly wasn't Faust, but you did get attached to your wing-buddies, which only added to the feeling of satisfaction when you almost singlehandedly turned the tide of war for the Confederation. Throughout the series, Origin has utilized every trick available to draw us deeper into the action. WC had the rudiments of a sustained plotline with its \"branching tree.\" WC II added digitized sound for your wingmen and enemies (and was probably the main application which put SOUND BLASTER on the map), competent voice-over acting and more coherent plotting. WC III, of course, gave us Mark Hamill, Malcolm rathi return, somehow resurrected through timetravel, cloning, or some other sci-fi cliche? Thankfully, no. It seems, rather, that some mysterious group of humans, calling themselves the Black Lance, has begun a reign of terror from the Border Worlds, blowing up innocent civilian ships and plunging the Confederation to the brink of Civil War. As the plot develops, you find that conspiracy theories abound, and the eyes of Big Brother Confederation are everywhere. The level of subplots and intrigue make for a story so dark at times that the shaky morale of the crew in Wing COMMANDER III seems almost upbeat by comparison. I actually had doubts that the cast could pull it off. WING COMMANDER IV is, after all, still primarily a space-combat game, and the acting in WC III, while fine for a game, still paled at times compared to a good movie. Yet, when I played through the missions, I was rather impressed with the acting in WC IV, which is even better, based on what I saw, than in WC III. John-Rhys Davies once again stood out. He doesn't get a lot of on-screen time, but he functions as the conscience for the interactive portions of the game, while remaining true to the Paladin we've come to know over all four games of the series. While I still have a weird feeling about seeing \"myself,\" as the Col. Blair character, played by an actor-should any gamer really see himself portrayed on-screen in an essentially \"out of body\" experience?-I must admit that Mark Hamill also does a fine job. Obviously more comfortable amongst WC IV's real sets than in front of WC ill's bluescreen, he makes Blair a much more human and believable character than in the previous game. The charismatic Tom Wilson, winner of CGWS best live acting award in 1994 for WC III, reprises his role as Maniac. This time around, the script gives him a bit more to work with—the sarcasm really flies, and we get to see our freespirited flyboy go down in flames several times at the hands of women who somehow don't appreciate his advances. At least Origin recognizes Maniac's marquee value-rumor has it that the wild wingman will star in his own add-on disk sometime in 1996. The lesser-known actors range from solid to outstanding. The best minor characters return from WC III: Cobra is just as vocal in denouncing Go to Sle DEATH THROES The spectacular graphics of WC IV are evident both in space combat, where this capital ship explodes in 100-frame technicolor brillance, and back at the carrier, where the mix of real sets and state-of-the-art computer graphics gives more visual depth than was possible in WC III.

WC IV shouldn't apologize for giving gamers a what I would consider a reasonable time. I think break from the \"upgrade at all costs\" philosophy, especially since it offers Origin can get away with spending that much more gameplay and a more involved storyline. Newer CD-ROM technology means money, because they're building on a known extra data on each CD, so that the game, along with its five and one-half winner.

"LHS HOLIDAY ADVENTURE GABRIEL KNIGHT 2: THE BEAST WITHIN DAGOG20 Everyone knows that werewolves are mere legends, right? Try telling that to the residents of a small Bavarian town, who live in lycanthrope-induced terror. As Gabriel Knight, the Designer Jane Jensen, unsatisfied with filming actors in front of a blue screen, actually went to Germany to research local history and scout authentic locations for the game. GABRIEL KNIGHT 2 by Terry Coleman & Elliott Chin his year, it appears that Santa's elves have forsaken the old wooden workbenches, loaded up on Twinkies and Jolt, and glued themselves in front of their computers to design a hot mix of adventure titles. Science fiction and horror are the twin themes of an adventuring year that has embraced the exploration of strange, exotic and fantastic worlds. As you might expect, you can explore the dark depths of a haunted mansion or stalk the werewolves of Germany. But if your sights are set on the future, you can command a starship, travel through time, or be the unwitting captives of a strange alien race. Whatever your fancy, this year's crop of adventure games has such a good mix of quality graphics, sound, and plot that they pull you in to a fantasy world more real than you'd expect. schattenjaegar-hunter of the supernatural-you are the town's only salvation against the dark forces that lurk in the shadows of GABRIEL KNIGHT 2: THE BEAST WITHIN. This sequel to GABRIEL KNIGHT: SINS OF THE FATHER builds on that game's rich graphics, dark story, and impressive voice acting. As before, author Jane Jensen has opted to blend psychological crisis and supernatural terror into a seamless blend that satisfies in story and interaction alike. This time, instead of investigating Voodoo Murders, the New Orleans murder mystery of the original and source for Gabriel's best-selling novel within the background story, Gabriel Knight and his colleague, Grace, must separate myth and superstition from reality amidst the moonlit forests of central Germany. They are helped in their quest by a cleaner interface, fine acting, an original score composed to sound like a lost opera by Wagner, and a powerful story which goes beyond the achievements of even the first GABRIEL KNIGHT. The more than 1,000 photos used for the game's background are augmented by computer graphics to provide a lush, photo-realistic look which adds to the eerie feel of GABRIEL KNIGHT 2. While the interface is even simpler in some respects than Sierra's other horror game, PHANTASMAGORIA, even veteran adventurers should find plenty of challenges. Moreover, any gamer will appreciate the live acting, as Grace and Gabriel change and grow, coming to grips with their own frailties as they learn more about the mysterious werewolves. Even the supporting cast deliver performances far beyond the norm of any multimedia production. Since the first GK won CGWs best adventure game last year and this game is even better-it looks to be a can't-miss for even the most casual horror fan. $54.95, Sierra On-Line, (800) 757-7707. 72 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  DECEMBER 1995 "

"HOLIDAY CYBERMAGE: DARKLIGHT AWAKENING PHANTASMAGORIA HOLIDAY HOUDY your true tasks. Each level in this game is like a separate issue of some great comic book epic, and you are the star superhero. This game should appeal to all gamers, whether they like action, appreciate great stories, or love adventure games and RPGs. $54.95, Origin/EA, (800) 245-4525. CYBERMAGE: DARKLIGHT AWAKENING is a blend of fast-paced, first-person action; the nonlinear, character building world of an RPG; and the plot of a comic-book adventure. The story. usually the basis of any great game, is spellbinding. In a world where genetically engineered humanoids have replaced humans in preeminence, you must fight against the tyranny of a sorcerer named Necrom. Government as we know it has collapsed, and corporations now rule the world. You have been transformed into a mysterious superbeing, who can drain the \"Darklight\" from the dead. As you do so, your powers grow greater, and your strength increases. But character building is not the gist of the game; solving the mystery of your powers, finding Necrom, exploring the nuances of Darklight, and discovering the root of the war and the all-powerful corporations are 6100 This is a game so powerful that it will leave an awful, terrified feeling in your stomach even after you have finished it. This is definitely not a game for the squeamish or the young. However, despite its emotional and supernatural horror, or actually because of it, PHANTASMAGORIA is an incredible work of art. It has achieved a height of realism that has so far been missing in computer games. The seven CDs offer an excellent story, amazing graphics, eye-catching video sequences and good acting. Like any good horror film, the game has pacing and mood, starting out leisurely and then rushing to its frightening, blood-pounding crescendo. You take the role of a female protagonist who has moved into a haunted house with her husband.

"HOLIDAY SHANNARA Set between the Sword of Shannara and Elfstones of Shannara novels, this adventure game from Legend is an original story auSHANNARA thored by Terry Brooks himself. SHANNARA is a bridge between Brooks' two novels, and this time you must guide another descendant of Shannara, Jak Ohmsford, to stop the evil doings of the shade of Brona. This game boasts lush graphics, and is being designed by the same husband-and-wife team that created the QUEST FOR GLORY series from Sierra. You must move Jak through the world of Shannara, meeting familiar characters such as Alannon the Druid and King Menion of Leah. One very interesting innovation in this game is that you get to play from the perspective of the various characters, adding depth to the storytelling and the personality of each character. Those who loved the novels will be pleased to know that Terry Brooks is proud of the game and believes it is faithful to his vision. With a great story line, an involving world, and an innovative take on role-playing, this game should win the hearts of any adventure gamer. $TBA, Legend, (800) 658-8891. STAR TREK: A FINAL UNITY You take on the roles of Captain Picard and the other officers of the famed Enterprise-D, and explore a universe that is pure Star Trek in this space adventure. The main thrust of this game is solving the galaxy-threatening riddle of the long gone Chodak. But there is also a civil war that needs soothing, a space station in need of salvation, an archaeological mission of dire importance, and a xenobiologist whose rescue is of great concern to the Federation. To top this all off, your missions are dangerously close to the \"neutral zone,\" and the Romulans do not take kindly to unannounced interlopers. In short, this game is like any other Star Trek episode, except that this time around you get to command the Enterprise. The original cast from ST: TNG has returned to provide the voices for all the characters, adding another stroke of authenticity to an already incredible adventure. The only failing of this game, apart from a STAR TREK staid tactical portion, is that it will leave gamers and Trekkies alike clamoring for more. $79.95, Spectrum HoloByte, (800) 983-4821, (510) 522-1164. 76 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

For sheer star quality, it's hard to surpass RIPPER from Take 2, whose impressive cast includes Burgess Meredith, Karen Allen and Christopher Walken. Even with such talent and a near $3 million budget, there's no guarantee that Ripper will be able to successfully update the Jack the Ripper tale to the 1990s, much less avoid the full-motion video jinx. Likewise, don't hold your breath for EA's PSYCHIC DETECTIVE. The game does offer slick video production, and at times is reminiscent of a good sci-fi whodunit from the fifties—but will there be enough gameplay for veteran adventurers? A better attempt would seem to be Activision's SPYCRAFT: THE GREAT GAME. Here, the photo-realistic backgrounds offer a more familiar adventure game backdrop for you to live out your counterspy fantasies. The participation of ex-CIA operative William Colby adds a needed air of authenticity to the project. Of course, one of the most-anticipated games for the holidays is Trilobyte's THE 11TH HOUR (distributed by Virgin). If you liked THE 7TH GUEST, you'll appreciate that the sequel has more coherent plotting, and thus a better sense of suspense, than its storied predecessor. And while the video is improved as well, the look of the competition has substantially raised the ante. It will be interesting indeed to see how well 11TH Hour does in the marketplace.

But the emphasis for CRPGs is on character development and interaction. Purist adventure gamers would also point out that the subset also emphasizes combat, sometimes to an extreme. Traditionally, this genre has been dominated by fantasy themes, and this year's crop is no exception. So, come cast a spell or swing a sword as we enter the kingdom of CRPGs. the dilemma-solving character generation. Capstone's WITCHHAVEN and id's upcoming QUAKE more than match that first-person combat experience for action-gamers, but in DAGGERFALL, Bethesda Softworks has not only greatly improved their game engine with regard to combat action, but they've added dozens of new touches, as well. DAGGERFALL's character generation requires some trade-offs between advantages and disadvantages, as well as insightful answers to the existential dilemmas presented in multiple-choice format. The game transparently performs thousands of calculations based on each character's basic attributes (as modified by the aforementioned advantages/disadvantages), health, fatigue, magical resistance, skill, knowledge, phobias, guild affiliation, race, vampirism, lycanthropy and more. Such detail ensures that encounters won't be the same from character-to-character, that character generation and game decisions will have consequences throughout the game. guilds. Conversations are richer than those in ARENA, and DAGGERFALL promises to offer considerably more plot flexibility. Within the game engine, the 3-D environs of the towns and dungeons are better than ever. Full 3-D battlements allow characters to hide on rooftops or behind walls. Also, characters who can use a spell to levitate between floors, platforms and catwalks will find that they have to be careful not to bump their heads on the realistic 3-D structures. What really impressed us, however, was the addition of underwater combat. When we played, our character had to both defeat the monsters and get rid of some heavy armor before he drowned-a very nice touch. Strategic movement has been simplified with a fasttravel map, and the Al for monsters has been significantly enhanced. Chances are that gamers who liked THE ELDER SCROLLS: ARENA will like THE ELDER SCROLLS: DAGGERFALL even more. $69.95, Bethesda Softworks, (800) 6770700. DECEMBER 1995. COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 85 "

Add to these features a tremendous soundtrack which features musical themes appropriate to each situation/culture and STONEKEEP may well offer the deepest pure CRPG experience scheduled for holiday release. $59.95, Interplay, 800-INTERPLAY. An epic story, solid roleplaying elements, fullscreen videotaped/rotoscoped characters, ambitious 3-D STUDIOcrafted monsters, fast-moving, step-by-step, first-person action and extremely satisfying combat sequences make STONEKEEP a game worth the wait. Originally conceived as a mere 3-D dungeon romp with a great combat interface, STONEKEEP's perilous quest to reach the market has involved some of the best paper game designers in the business. It has, as a result, become a game with an intriguing intricacy of plot to match its easy interface for play. The magic system is rich and satisfying with its alchemical feel. Just as satisfying are the video snippets where gamers encounter proud, garrulous monsters a la Tolkien or the hubris-laden ultimate bad guy who underestimates the protagonist and mocks the player with annoying regularity (although not with STONEKEEP DRUID: DAEMONS OF THE Mind takes place in a 3-D-rendered environment on the planet of Navan, a world where Druidic, values concerning the elements and balance of nature are still cherished. Your character is summoned into this world of detailed 3-D characters and monsters in order to both rescue a missing Druid named Lawson and discover both the higher purpose of the Druids (and yourself). Most of the game is viewed from the traditional, oblique, overhead perspective, but the 3-D rendering of characters and setting allows for some intriguing first-person encounters. Further, the interface is completely mousedriven, with all movement, investigation, combat and magic interaction handled via a two-button mouse.

Alien dialogues are much more sophisticated, plus the aliens are now depicted on-screen by elaborate puppets filmed in digitized video. Add into the mix a plot where the player strives to defeat an evil, spacefaring race and things get DRUID pretty interesting. The new HyperMelee still uses many of the basic algorithms of the earlier games, with only a few adjustments to reflect the characteristics and weapons of the 12 new ships that appear here. As in the original game, each ship has a basic weapon: The Daktakblakpak Vivisector has arms which grab an enemy ship and start drilling into the side; the Harika/Yorn Ravager has a bola missile, where two missiles are connected by a tether-if the tether connects with anything, both missiles converge on the object encountered. And of course there're the special weapons: The Vivisector launches a capsule that automatically launches missiles whenever an enemy approaches its range; and the Ravager, a very slow ship, can get a turbo boost by eating members of its crew. $TBA, Accolade, 1-800-245-7744.

A.D. 2050) role-playing game where you take on the persona of Tom Driscoll, pilot of a ALBION spaceship that has crash-landed on a planet with very primitive life forms. There's a considerable variety of gameplay here. An exploration segment uses a 2-D world map viewed from an oblique overhead perspective. This part of the game looks a lot like Interplay's LORD OF THE RINGS and, at times, appears to use the same \"follow the leader\" Al. More interesting, however, is the 2-D combat planning screen which allows you to select magic and combat options on a chessboard reminiscent of BATTLECHESS. Then, you get the pay-back of watching 3-D results of that combat with lots of special effects.

Armed with spells, called dyshas, you must locate the alien stronghold, free your captured friends, and put an end to the alien menace. We really like the handling of the magic system in this game. The acquisition of spells requires the harvesting of crystals. Then, the combat is purely spell-based, without any melee fighting.

"HOLIDAY ACTION MECHWARRIOR 2 Although it's been out for almost half a year now, this is one action game that shows no signs of dying out. Combining gorgeous graphics (which are stunning in low-res and breathtaking at 1024x768) with true Mech-anized combat (that means fast action and some actual thinking involved), this game permanently raised the bar on Mech combat games, completely outdistancing the competition. It has MECHWARRIOR 2 Ano, Hest to the next Nav point and do the same. And this is the first Mech game we've seen where you can actually utilize your brain instead of your trigger finger. During one mission, you're able to sit on the top of a mountain range, zoom in on your targets and pluck them off one by one at least, until the enemy figures out where you are. Another mission makes you sprint through a mountain pass and destroy an enemy Mech before he completely destroys some friendly strucPELAS PUAS SO 90 tures. It's nice, for FLAS once, to avoid the \"sight the enemy, run right into him, all guns blazing\" syndrome. But that doesn't mean all is stealth in this war. There will be plenty of mech-tomech (and most of the time more than one mech) battles. Thankfully, your unit can be completely armed to the teeth with all manner of lasers, blasters, machine guns and missiles. And you can completely custom configure your weapon load. But enough gushing. Whether you're a novice PC gamer or die-hard, battle-scarred Battletech player, this is the action game of the year right here. You'd be wise not to miss it (or let other special gamers in your heart miss out). Activision is busily at work putting the finishing touches on a MECHWARRIOR mission addon and the much anticipated networking module. The mission disk will involve the intriguing clan of the Ghost Bear, and will include snow-filled missions and underwater missions as well as several new Mech classes. NETMECH should also be available for the holiday seasons. Available through the Activision web site, this IPX-compatible network game allows up to eight players at a time to engage.

No series to date has managed to capture such a Hollywood feel and successfully combine it with such quality action. From moment one, WinG COMMANDER 3 wowed us (and tons of other gamers) with its cinematic style. We expect WING COMMANDER 4 to do the same. Although the use of 35mm film will not make much difference in what we see on PC screens, the real sets definitely will. Infronts. While you're picking off targets from the hill, your cohorts can be on the other side of the map doing their own thing. TERRA Nova allows you to order your troops around through a simple point-and-click interface. If you want your wingmen to head over to the river and stand on watch, you can diagram that maneuver.

Hexen carries on the time-accelerating, visceral-response gaming experience that we've come to expect. New in this game, and the genre in general, is the ability to select from three different heroes (fighter, cleric and mage), each of which has unique weapons and abilities. But what really excited us is the incredible level of atmosphere Raven has been able to inject into the game. From the fog-filled expanses of land to the leaves wandering across the screen, Hexen really goes a long way in convincing you that you're in a world, as opposed to in a level of some game. Also aiding in that suspension of disbelief are the integrated level schematics and the presence of some fairly involving puzzles that go beyond the simple \"push this button in and run to the door\" variety. (This is a new, and welcome, addition to the DOOM HEXEN: HERETIC 2 engine.) Hats off to Raven Software for pushing the genre even further than we thought possible.

GENERAL It's not just the sounds, but the superior control of them that sets the DB50XG apart. The new XG format takes control far beyond General MIDI (GM). And with major game developers implementing XG, you won't want to be stuck with a card that doesn't keep up with the times. The DB50XC will play all of your favorite GM compatible software. And with its superior sounds, it will play them better than you've ever heard before. It's amazing what a simple upgrade can do.

"HOLIDAY NEED 4 SPEED Normally, racing games that are fun, yet still retain challenging elements (read: that don't allow you to keep your foot on the accelerator throughout an entire race) are the domain of the gearheads over in the simulation area, but that's changed with Electronic Arts' release of NEED 4 SPEED. This may be arcade excitement, but it's the first taste we've gotten that actually stuck us to the monitor for more 102:43.3 N 00:17.6 22 2 85 .3 MILES Y 6/8 than one race at a time. What makes this racer one of our \"should-buys\" for the gift-giving season? A combination of things. For starters, in high-resolution mode, this game's graphics are rivaled by no other racing game out there, save the gems from Papyrus (NASCAR, INDYCAR RACING II). And the action will surprise even the die-hard simulation driver. Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Toyota Supra-there are three different classes of cars here with enough high-performance vehicles to please everyone and their father. Better yet, the cars actually perform differently on the road. The Lamborghini's got a low center-ofgravity and steady handling; the Ferrari has lightning-fast acceleration You'll hit the road on several different courses, from the city to the country to the mountains to Las Vegas. And you can either race against one car, or a pack of vehicles. There's even a circuit of races. A slick multimedia car encyclopedia detailing the statistics, capabilities and history of each car round out a package that should be capable of pleasing both the die-hard race driver and the Sunday spinner. $59.99, Electronic Arts, (415) 571-7171.

Points 88 laun. 01/2 Racing fans who find themselves playing race games all too often just to create dramatic crash after crash will finally have a chance to step over to the dark, crushed-metal side of the fence. With Psygnosis' DESTRUCTION DERBY, fans of \"big-crash racing\" can have their cake and eat it too. Racing takes four different forms: Time Trials, Stock Car Racing, Wreckin' Racing and the Derby itself. Stock car races are flatout races to the finish—no points are awarded for damaging cars, although it's still possible. Wreckin' Racing is also a race to finish a certain number of laps, with the exception that you also can accumulate points by knocking the tar out of each other. The Destruction Derby is simple: take 20 cars and put them in an oval arena where you get points for spinning each other and knocking opponents out of the \"race.\" The graphics are similar to NASCAR's low-resolution modethat is, nothing breathtaking, but solid. But it's the action that is the key draw here, and it's stellar. Adding further depth to the game, there are several variations of DESTRUCTION DERBY you can play by yourself, like tag and one-on-duels.

"3D PINBALL MORE WINTER ACTION Up until the last year or so, Pinball has been relegated to the back alleys of computer gaming. Digital tables like CRYSTAL CALIBURN by Starplay have permanently changed that. Sierra's offering, 3-D PINBALL, looks like a winner for the winter, boasting three unique tables and a completely new take on the game. Set in space, each table--Space Mine, Command Post and Colony—is more than one pinball table in itself. In the Space Mine, for example, you'll occasionally need to defend your mine from invaders, and if you open up certain passageways you'll be able to put your ball into play in a completely different sector of the game. You can even warp between the three different tables of the game. This might be the best pinball game of the year. 22:25: $49.99, Sierra, (800) 757-7707. Glololo 3D PINBALL SO MAGIC CARPET 2 In addition to DESTRUCTION DERBY, there are several other racers out there that intrigue us. Virgin's ZONE Raiders is one such title, with some seriously slick graphics and some structure to the game besides \"blow up everything in sight.\" Gametek is readying, the release of ROADWARRIOR, their sequel to QUARANTINE, which they promise will contain plenty of «mindless violence and killing, implied sex, and big cars going very fast...Another Virgin racing game that looks mighty fine is SCREAMER, which resembles Pole PosiTION's fast-paced action. 3-D LEMMINGS is another title we're anxious to get our hands on, with its completely new look at the ac tion puzzler (for more information, see our Sneak Preview on page 312). On the fighting scene, we're anxious to get our hands on 47-Tek's Go-MAN TEAM 47, a 3-D giant monster fighting game that will pit you against a host of baddies; alas, it's been pushed off to the January/February timeframe. Speaking of monsters, we also can't wait to see Magnet Interactive's MONSTER ISLAND, which will (hopefully) allow us to live our Godzilla fantasies. There are also some platform games which should ship either right at the end of the year, or sometime next year. HEART OF DARKNESS is one game that seems to have caught everyone's fancy, but it remains to be seen whether it will ship anytime, soon. One game that should make it in time for the holidays is Activision's EARTHWORM JIM. This gamingturned cartoon character is being feverishly ported to Windows 95. Of course the game everyone wants to get their hands on is id Software's QUAKE, which has been canceled. Just kidding, just kidding! The designers are feverishly working on it in Texas, and while they were originally shooting for December, it appears that date has slipped a bit into the first quarter of next year. \"It'll be done when it's done\" is the company's official word. In other words, when they tear themselves away from playing HEXEN ... HOLIDAY NUU With Magic CARPET 2, the best just got better. Using their revolutionary first-person engine (which is running faster than ever), and adding several tweaks, Bullfrog once again appears ready to devour large chunks of gamers' time. The theme is pretty much the same as before You must stop the advance of Vissuluth The Dark One over the course of 25 different levels, each of which presents more advanced challenges than before. At your magic carpet's disposal are a powered-up selection of 75 different spells, like gravity wells and whirlwinds. There are tons of new monsters to deal with this time around. The designers obviously listened to the thousands of die-hard Magic CARPET players out there, and have made several gameplay adjustments that really enhance MC2's play value. One such addition is the presence of mission objectives for each level, which gives the game considerably more structure than before. Not a whole lot has changed here in the basic gameplay, but then again, not a whole lot needed to be changed. If you're a fan of the first MAGIC CARPET, or are looking for a fast-paced shoot 'em up the likes of which you've never seen before, this game will make a solid addition to your stable. $59.99, Electronic Arts, (415) 5717171.

"-HOLIDAY S P O R T S FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO  With SVGA graphics and tons of tweaks and updates, FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO '96 (FPSF PRO) by Sierra easily takes the trophy as top sports pick for this holiday season. The third time around is the charm for this updated pigskin romp, expected to be the last version of the game using the current engine. (Pat Cook, the original designer or replay the action from virtually any angle desirable. Another significant-and still unrivaled-feature is FPSF's season and career play. During the course of a season, which may be set up in a number of different ways, coaches can choose to handle GM duties or simply call the action. Those who want to run FPSF '96 2 by George Jones hat smell is in the air-you know, the one that says fall is coming to an end and snow is on the way, Baseball has finally crowned its champion. Football's playoff hunt is just heating up. Hockey is right at the point where you think the season will simply go on forever, and basketball is fresh and new enough that you watch as much of it as you can. What also happens at this rare time of year-when most professional sports are on our minds is that a massive avalanche of sports titles comes our way faster than bobsleds down an Olympic run. In the past, many of these titles have been mediocre at best. This year, though, things are different. Picking 10 hot games that we would like to play proved no problem at all. It seems like sports game designers are finally putting together a winning game plan! of the game, is digging his teeth into a complete redesign for next year's version.) Of course, everything we loved about the original FPSF Pro is still here. All the real players, all the real teams, the most robust statistical model to grace the computer screen, full league and career play. There really aren't many good reasons not to buy this game. For the rookie user, FPSF Pro revolution izes pigskin play on the PC. It combines a tremendous game model with great graphics, different angles from which to view the action, and more plays than Mike Ditka could draw up into one package. The on-field action is breathtaking, especially so in this edition. With real motioncaptures and high-resolution graphics, this promises to be the most attractive FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL Pro game ever. Of course, players still straight-arm, spin and get flipped like pancakes. And the CAMS (Camera Angle Management System) is still around, which means you'll be able to view the front office make personnel transactions-placing injured players on the Injured Reserve list, choosing draft picks, signing free agents and making trades. The computer handles things for the rest of the league, and the design team is promising that the General Manager Al will be much stronger this time around The presence of career leagues is something that really distances FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO '96 from the competition. This allows players to coach their favorite team through the years, losing players to retirement and injury, and gaining new players through drafts and trades. They essentially take part in their own version of NFL history. few things feel better than taking a really crummy team and developing it into a powerhouse over three years' time. Emotional attachments are usually reserved for adventure games, but this is one sports game where you'll take personal pride in your team. $59.95, Sierra, (800) 757-7707. 108 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"HOLIDAY S P O R T S NHL HOCKEY '96 TONY LA RUSSA 3 BASEBALL and scoring in this version of the game is tough. Also, in a move the real NHL wishes they could make, the puck in NHL '96 has been super-enlarged. You'll never have a problem following it in this game. Sure, there are still some problems with the opponent Althere always have been, due to hockey's intricate game flow-but this is the best hockey game on the market, made better for 1996. $59.99, Electronic Arts, (415) 571-7171. Since most of the sports genre consists of sequels and sequels to sequels, it's a good thing that each iteration seems to be a genuine improvement. EA Sports NHL HOCKEY '96 is no exception; graphics, gameplay and appearance have all been radically changed this time around, all for the better. First off, the perspective has changed from the standard vertically-oriented view to which we've grown accustomed to a slightly closer-to-the-ice angle that's changeable on the fly. Although things may be a little disorienting at first for the veteran NHL fan, this new graphical approach makes a big difference during the on-ice action. The players seem bigger and skate more realistically, making more sense in the actual flow of the game. One other bonus in the graphic redesign is that veteran NHL players will have to re-conquer a learning curve. Favorite moves no longer work like they used to (many can't even be attempted the same way), Tony La Russa may have jumped ship from the American League to the National League, and he may have a lot to learn about pinch-hitting for pitchers and double-switches, but the baseball game bearing his name will remain one of the better PC sports experiences on the market for the holiday season. Developed by Stormfront Studios, TONY LA RUSSA BASEBALL 3 has already carried the famous computer baseball series to higher levels than before, with a great look and a superb statistical model. As much as HARDBALL 5 is for the action gamer, TONY LA RUSSA is for the cerebral fan--the guy who'd rather coach his way to the title. It does have its play action elements, but they're not the strong point of the game. What is the strong suit? The chess-like nature of the game itself, which TONY LA RUSSA 3 captures magnificently, TONY LA RUSSA 3's statistical merits hold rank with those of the \"hardcore\" baseball sims: PURSUE THE PENNANT and STRAT-O-Matic, both of which recreate authentic numbers with great accuracy. Plenty of managerial   #47 STEPHAN LEBEAU (1) UKIWA HARDBALL 5 TONY LA RUSSA 3 0 Accolade's HARDBALL is probably the longest running sports game on the PC Market. Ever since its initial version way back in 1985, when it pitted the Red team versus the Blue team with fabled sluggers like H. Contos and left-handed pitchers like T. Frisina, this game has been the action baseball game. Some of the other games out there have action modules built in, but this is the only title that is created primarily with that in mind. This year, the action is even better. Last year's version boasted some major league graphics improvements. HARDBALL 5 takes the same graphical engine and improves upon it. The perspective of the batting screen has been modified so that the batter fills almost the entire screen, which means that strike zone is nice and big: picking up pitches is even closer to the real thing. Also different is the speed with which pitches cross the plate; it's much more realistic, and will require quicker reflexes than before. Accolade has taken a new approach with this classic game. In the past, they felt that the action itself would stand on its own, and it did to a certain extent. But with HARDBALL 5, they've figured out that even us twitch gamers want lots of depth and simulation. To that end, they've included minor leagues, free agents and injured lists. They've also added tons of statistics for number geeks, 40 different stadiums, all the real players and 12 classic teams and stadiums. $69.95, Accolade, (800) 245-7744. BALLS STRIKES OUTS INNING decisions are at your disposal (fans of Tony La Russa 2 will be happy to know that the double-switch finally works), and the game's interface is nice and simple, $69.99, Electronic Arts, (415) 571-7171., HARDBALL 5 110 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Thankfully, Electronic Arts (who else?) changed that. Never a group to rest on their laurels, they're looking to improve upon an already very good thing with the next incarnation of digital hoops, NBA LIVE '96. The release is coming down to the end of the holiday game clock, but it will be worth the wait This is a game that comes closer to simulating the real thing than anything we've seen. The controls are smooth and intuitive, allowing you to dribble behind your back, throw alley-oop passes and actually rely on your outside game. And the graphics are stellar. There's a certain pleasure in playing with Shaquille O'Neal and actually being able to make low-post moves, and basketball fans will appreciate actually being able to properly execute a pick and roll. Even more amazing is the fact that statistically, this title is mighty solid. What's new this time around? From what we've seen, the designers are focusing on graphics and AI. LIVE 95's high resolution graphics looked nice, but the perspective wasn't close enough to the action to follow. That's being changed to look more like NHL Hockey's high-res mode, complete with selectable camera angles. In fact, even the low-resolution view will apparently use the NHL model. Of course, the majority of NBA rookies, from Joe Smith to Yinka Dare, will all be \"in the game,\" as will the ability to call plays and offenses. When this title hits the shelves-hopefully soon-double dribble your way to the store and pick it up. You'll probably get your money's worth in the first week alone. $59.99, Electronic Arts, (415) 571-7171. NBA LIVE '96 112 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1995 "

Unfortunately, when it comes to football action, there isn't even a playing field. Enter EA Sports (who else, it seems, nowadays?) with its high-profile PC version of John MADDEN FOOTBALL Exhibition : Wikim VARI Timet A 16-bit mainstay ever since 1990, every version of John MADDEN has boasted addictive, fun, yet seemingly realistic, action as well as quality graphics. And these two underlying principles will be improved upon twenty-fold for the PC version, which will boast hires (640x480) graphics and tons of full-motion video to spice things up, including the FOX sports commentators John Madden (of course), Pat Summerall, James Brown and Leslie Visser. The action, of course, will be top-notch and extremely good looking. The engine is still pretty much the same basic game engine from the old days, with plays selectable from play boxes and unrivaled ground and passing games. Veterans will appreciate the ability to customize their playbooks, although you still can't create your own plays. Graphically, JMF is gorgeous. Using the latest in motion capture technology, each players' movements appear so realistic that you'll be shaking your head in disbelief; this is not 16-bit football.

But that doesn't stop us from dreaming. In the meantime, computer duffers can make do with what looks to be the best golfing simulation around for the holidays, Electronic Arts PGA GOLF '96. This golf title sports lush graphics that will probably raise again the ante for future golf games and has the usual wealth of sparkle and detail that is the mark of EA Sports titles. New to this version is a waggle feature that helps you determine how well you'll hit the ball, and a \"Play of the Day\" feature that will save your best shots for posterity's sake. The basic interface of the game has remained the same, with the red and blue arc being your main focus. One big improvement over PGA GOLF 486 (last year's version of the game) is that the amount of time the program spends loading and redrawing holes has been reduced considerably.

Most of the programs can be tuned down to work on 486 systems, but even Pentium-133 drivers will find that sims like Flight Unlimited will push their systems to the limit. Designers have realized that even the best Al can't match the challenge of a good human opponent, so you'll find multiplayer capabilities built into many of this year's top games. If you unwrap any of these programs on Christmas morning, prepare for an immersive experience. After all, \"reality\" is a concept for those who can't handle simulation. Suddenly my wingman breaks in, \"Contact! One-niner-five degrees! Fifteen nautical miles! Angels four!\"I call back, \"Engage\" and jerk the stick back. Checking the MFD display, I can see from the data link that the AWACS has the bogies painted. Looks like the excitement's not over yet. Just a typical day in the life of the EuROFIGHTER 2000 pilot defending Scandinavia in Ocean's EF2000. Developer Digital Image Design gained the cooperation of British Aerospace while designing the sim, and it shows. The Eurofighter 2000 aircraft is modeled with precision detail, down to the innovative radar section on the HUD and the adjustable multifunction displays (MFDs). An innovative control scheme finally makes the instrument panel useful even in a combat situation. The panel view is divided into nine sections, each of which is accessible by pressing a key on the numeric keypad. For a quick look at the bottom-center MFD, just press the \"2\" key. All the other expected views are there, including padpect with a fundamentally unstable aircraft with computer-assisted control. Missions are divided into Quick Action, a series of start-inthe-air missions attacking both ground and air targets; Simulator, where you'll find free flight, training, and full takeoff-to-landing strike missions; and a Campaign mode. You're not up there alone, either. Up to eight players can engage in network combat. Where EF2000 truly shines, though, is with the best graphics this side of Flight Unlimited. The effect as an island cliff begins to gain detail as you approach it through the fog is breathtaking. You're attempting to prevent Russian forces from invading Norway and Sweden, so look forward to combat over some very scenic glaciers, mountains, and fjords. With a target-rich environment, a fluid campaign, and amazing sound and graphics, this looks to be the benchmark flight sim for some time to come. $69.95, Ocean, (408) 289-1200. 120 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"HOLIDAY 15 MULA TION SILENT HUNTER FIGHTER DUEL and a campaign mode. In the campaign mode, hardware improves as the war progresses, giving you the opportunity to captain Gato-, Balao-, Tambour-, and Salmon-class boats. To train you for action, SSI includes multimedia presentations of technical and historical natures by William \"Bud\" Gruner, who skippered the U.S.S. Skate for three war patrols in World War II. $55, SSI, (800) 601-PLAY. Underwater action is your game, but you're tired of playing the U-boat-driving bad guy. SSI dives to the rescue with SILENT HUNTER, an SVGA submarine simulation that puts you at the helm of a submarine fighting to help win WWII for the good old U.S. of A. You'll start your tour with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, hunting for warships and merchants in the South Pacific. The goal is simple: send as many tons of enemy hardware to a watery grave as possible. The game uses the now-standard control room interface used by classics such as SILENT Service and ACES OF THE DEEP. Detail abounds, including a fully-functional fire-control system. (However, since real subs often used tracking parties of up to eight crewmen to handle fire-control systems in combat, SSI wisely gives you the option of letting the computer set up your targeting solutions.) SILENT HUNTER offers both single missions FIGHTER DUEL is like a sleek sportscar. It's not loaded down with fancy options and accessories, and it's not that easy for learners to drive. But, boy, is it fast! And the handling—sweet! This isn't one of those ultra-ambitious sims that asks you and your P-51 to win the war single-handedly. Instead, FIGHTER DUEL concentrates on a single aspect of the air war: pure, unadulterated airto-air combat. This complete rewrite of Jaeger's Amiga classic sports runs in SVGA, but is still playable on a 486-33. Not inappropriate for a sim that concentrates only on air combat, the ground graphics are sparse—a carrier and a few islands. But the aircraft are extremely sharp and detailed, and the instrument panel is unbelievably realisSILENT HUNTER SET You can fly FIGHTER DUEL against computer opponents, or head-to-head over a phone line or null-modem link. The computer pilots sport eight levels of AI, and you can take on up to eight opponents at a time, of any mix of FIGHTER 380013 INDYCAR RACING II 1100 support of accelerated graphics cards. Other improvements include enhanced Al for the computer-controlled drivers, better car handling, and updated data from the 1995 IndyCar season. And those of you who like to drive the wrong way on the oval will be happy to know that new crash sequences feature dented cars and parts flying in every direction. $55.00, Papyrus, (800) 836-1802 or (617) 8685440. FIGHTER DUEL Chalk one up for the theory of evolution. From the EGA-based INDIANAPOLIS 500 through the VGA INDYCAR RACING to the SVGA NASCAR RACING, the Papyrus racing sims have grown more intelligent—and better looking to boot. Now INDYCAR RACING Il takes the series a step higher, tuning up and turbo-charging the game's engine in an attempt to push to the head of the racing-sim pack. The most dramatic enhancement comes in the form of SVGA graphics. Beautifully texturemapped tracks, cars, and scenery, along with much-improved sound effects, really pull you into the experience. The game is available in DOS, Windows 95, and Mac versions, and the Win 95 version really shows the promise of the new operating system. Papyrus says that Win 95 INDYCAR || drivers can expect graphics speeds up to four times those of NASCAR RACING, thanks to Win 95's INDYCAR RACING II DUEL'S 13 planes. The real fun, though, comes when you take on a friend. Single-session and tournament play are supported. The game sports a full-force flight model, but it can be toned down if you're taking on a novice opponent. If fighter-tofighter, guns-only combat is your thing, look no further. $49.95, Philips New Media, (301) 444-6626. HUIMAUSTINA 12592 35 srt 23 122 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1995 "

The sim includes an interactive tutorial section with 33 lessons, so beginners and aces alike should learn a few things. The computerized instructor takes you through a maneuver, then hands you the stick and gives you a go at it. FLIGHT UNLIMITED And while you're learning, you'll enjoy some beautiful sights.

"HOLIDAY s I MULATION SU-27 FLANKER HOLIO It's been a good year for the \"bad guys.\" Games like TIE FIGHTER, PANZER GENERAL, and Aces OF THE DEEP have put you on the dark side of combat. Now sim pilots can join in the fun with Su-27 FLANKER, SU-27 FLANKER which puts you in the cockpit of one of Russia's hot fighters and finally gives you a chance to down some Americanski F-16 Falcons. If you're a newbie PC pilot, skip the rest of this entry and check out Top Gun below: Su-27 FLANKER is a simulation for the experienced simulation buff. Between the top-notch flight model (you can even pull off the famed Cobra maneuver) and the deadly-accurate instrument panel (down to the Cyrillic writing on the gauges), this game should prove itself to be the spiritual heir to FALCON 3.0's throne. You can fly combat at training, single-mission, and campaign (both squadron and theater-level) modes. A full range of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons are included, although the Su-27 is primarily an interceptor. The SVGA graphics exhibit an interesting dichotomy: they're primitive compared to sims such as EF2000 and FLIGHT UNLIMITED, with planes and terrain being built from nontexture-mapped polygons. However, these polygon objects are amazingly detailed, and the utilitarian yet crisp graphics actually seem appropriate for a Russian fighter sim. $55, SSI, (800) 601-PLAY.

In single-player engagements, you can fly both pilot and gunner positions. Multiplayer modes support two players over a serial connection, and up to 16 via a local area network.

"HOLIDAY s 1 M U L A T 10 N TOP GUN Just like the real Top Gun school at Mirimar Naval Air Station, Spectrum HoloByte's Top GUN: FIRE AT WILL is designed to build the skills of novice fighter pilots. This is the sim to check out if you're looking for a program to give a beginning sim pilot, or if you find yourself getting waxed by bogies all the time in more advanced sims. TOP GUN retains the slightly reckless, seat-of-the-pants flavor of the Tom Cruise film, yet combines it with a fairly detailed F-14 Tomcat simulation. This time around, you're Maverick, and actor James Tolkan reprises his role of Hondo, the tough-talking, cigar-chewing commanding officer. The game has a high level of cinematic content between individual missions, where you'll interact with over 20 actors and watch CNN-style news briefs as your carrier attempts to cool down conflicts in Cuba, Korea and Libya. There are also a number of training missions for learning carrier landing skills and dogfighting techniques. Aircraft control is geared toward beginners, with simplified instruments, but happily the game doesn't toss the laws of physics out the window. It just doesn't bombard the beginner with ultra-complicated radar systems and such. The SVGA graphics are top-notch, and you'll fly to a rocking soundtrack that includes tunes such as a re-recording of the Kenny Loggins hit title song. Once you feel confident of your piloting skills, you can take on up to 15 opponents via network play. Price unavailable at press time, Spectrum HoloByte, (510) 5221164. ALSO IN THE PATTERN TP .

The much-lauded sim, however, had its share of quirks. Electronic Arts has addressed those quirks and beefed up the sim engine with the MARINE FIGHTERS add-on disc, as well as adding an assortment of new missions and aircraft to fly The emphasis of MARINE FIGHTERS is vertical/short take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft. You'll fly the Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier II, the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier, and the Russian Yak-141. There's also an AC-130 Hercules gunship tossed in, mostly for novelty value. Along with the new planes comes a much more detailed combat arena, with some four times the graphics detail of USNF. Other improvements from USNF include better controller support, turbulence, improved flight models and better Al for enemies and wingmen, and support for the Forte VFX-1 virtual reality helmet. The finetuning of the original program and the uniqueness of V/STOL combat make the USNF/MARINE FIGHTERS combo a worthy addition to any gamer's arsenal. $29.95, Electronic Arts, (415) 571-7171. NovaLogic's WEREWOLF VS. COMANCHE 2.0 is the perfect gift for friend or enemy; it ships with two complete combat chopper sims on two CDs, giving you everything you need to go head-to-head in one package. Spectrum HoloByte is releasing the sequel to WoRLD Circuit Racing, called GRAND PRIX II, under its new World Circuit Racing brand (confused yet?); the classic racing sim has been updated with texture-mapped, SVGA graphics. If you're just darned tired of realism, try Mindscape's Air Power: BATTLE IN THE Skies, which transports you to an alternate 1930s Earth where air battles take place using dirigible-launched fighters. If you have a 3D0 owner in the family pick up a copy of Domark's FLYING NIGHTMARES, noteable as the most sophisticated flight sim yet to hit the console market. The Microsoft FLIGHT SIMULATOR fan in the family will appreciate FLIGHT SIMULATOR FUGHT SHOP, which among other things lets you design your own aircraft, and Tower, a surprisingly addictive air traffic control simulation. Mission Studios' JETFIGHTER III won't hit stores until just after the new year, but the updated classic promises an exciting South American campaign built around accurate texture-mapped terrain created from government data.

This year's Christmas strategy treats break ground in challenging our desire to expand, explore, and exploit, from the comfy confines of Old Earth to the farflung reaches of yet-uncharted galaxies. Fantasy games make a strong bid for playing time, allowing us to bash orcs (or humans, or trolls), make peace with elves, uncover insidious plots, and have fun fighting enemies with unpronouncable names. Even some of our boardgame favorites are faithfully translated to the silicon screen. Real-time and turn-based, tactical to grand strategic, it's all here for the taking! Alpha Centauri expedition with the Aztecs, what effect will a multiplayer version of CivLIZATION have on national productivity? Be sure to list specific examples supporting your thesis. For those of us who are lifetime members of CIVILIZATION Anonymous, the impending release of CivNET has caused us to reschedule appointments, load up on non-perishable food stores, and find reasons to take vacation time which we could never otherwise justify. Are we simply living in the past, bound by loyalty to a four-year-old game design? Hardly. Consider: in an industry where the average shelf life of a design--even a good one is three to six months, Civ is still selling reasonably well (now past the 850,000 unit mark), despite its dated graphics and sound. The new version offers SVGA graphics, MIDI sound support, and a much better interface; much of what we expected the Windows version to be is here, and more. expansion. Research is simplified, as the science advisor is actually helpful this time around, allowing you to see up to two advances ahead of current technology. The Al is even tougher than before, making for a much better game on levels other than Emperor. The other tweaks include: auto-saves after each turn, and auto-backup after five turns; detailed city reports; multiple world maps; and better alert functions when you are attacked. Still, it's the multiplayer aspect that drives the game. You may form alliances with other human players, and even eavesdrop on chat conversations of your enemies with diplomatic spies. The game flows surprisingly well in either classic turnbased or parallel play, and will support network, modem and, perhaps, even internet play.

"HOLIDAY S T R A T EGY COMMAND AND CONQUER CAESAR II HOLIDAY freshingly non-linear in that respect. Wrapped around the incredible real-time game engine are breathtaking 3-D graphics that complement the storyline. COMMAND & CONQUER has a much upgraded Al over Dune II, but the best opponents will be human: the game is multiplay-capable over both modem and network. $59.95, Virgin/Westwood Studios, (800) 8744607. Well, it wasn't enough that Dune Il redefined real-time strategy gaming. Now, COMMAND & CONQUER, the \"unofficial\" follow-up from Westwood Studios, has upped the ante once again, while still retaining some similarities to the popular computer game set in Frank Hebert's world. You still command various troops and build structures to increase your productivity and power, and you also must harvest certain elements to maintain production: in this case, it's the celestial element, Tiberium, instead of Spice. The game is set in the near future, so the warfare takes place in various locales on Earth. The technology is also a mix between modern weaponry and slightly futuristic war machines like battle suits. COMMAND & Conquer has over 30 various scenarios to battle out, and like Wing COMMANDER, there are various possible branches toward victory; the game is reCOMMAND & CONQUER Appease the emperor, conquer new lands, build up your Roman provinces, and manage the cities within your sphere of influence in CAESAR II. There are three levels to the game: Empire, Province and City. In the Empire level, you must deal with the emperor, appease his demands, and curry his favor; this level is sufficiently more diplomatic and more complex than in the first Caesar game. In the Province level, you'll, not only defend the Imperial provinces, but develop them as well. You must build structures to increase the industry and population growth, and accumulate resources for the Emperor. Unlike the original CAESAR, the combat system here is fully integrated with the strategic game, and is great fun in and of itself. The near-effortless interface gives you command over lines of heavy infantry, cavalry, phalanxes, and even massive war elephants, so that you may prevail against the barbarians of the periphery. Still, it's the City level that is the true center of the game. Here, you must govern the city, maintain the standard of living, appease the citizens, and build the City to its WARHAMMER Options Speed Help 148 B.C.

You command a motley crew indeed, from goblins and demons to mounted knights and even CAESAR II COPIPII Cost: 3 m wererats. The world you inhabit is a ale whirlpool of demonic forces and magical creatures. As the game evolves from a loose storyline, you are left relatively free to decide your own course of action. In addition to contesting whatever scenarios you want in any order, you have the choice of fighting against or collaborating with the Ultimate Evil. Since everything is real-time, the fighting is intense and hectic, as is the magic system, which rivals MASTER OF MAGIC for visual effects and complexity.

"HOLIDAY S T R A T EGY MASTER OF ANTARES Darlok Spy MicroProse's MASTER OF ANTARES, the eagerly anticipated sequel to MASTER OF ORION (MOC), should be out in time to make every strategy gamer's Christmas wishlist. This game is everything MOO was and more. It will feature more alien races and will even offer customizable aliens; you can select from a plethora of racial strengths and weaknesses and weave them into a new species. MicroProse is also bringing \"Legendary Commanders,\" into MasTER OF ANTARES, army leaders in the MASTER OF Magic mold. Unlike MOO, there will be (finally!) modem, hotseat, and network play, so you and your friends can all vie for control of the universe. Ship-to-ship combat won't be dominated by massive, hundred-strong fleets any more (the limit should be 50); but on the plus side, players will now be able to board enemy vessels, capture ships, and salvage them for parts and resources. And casting a dark shadow across the entire game will be the mysterious aliens of Antares. Overthrown eons ago by the Orions, they now seek revenge on the entire universe, and stand between you and the conquest of a galaxy. It looks like another hit for the folks at Simtex, who always remember to put the gameplay first. $47.99, MicroProse, (800) 879-PLAY, (410) 771-0440. MASTER OF ANTARES HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC This wonderful game from New World Computing is a great wargaming/strategy hybrid with elements of role-playing as well. In HEROES OF MIGHT AND Magic, you begin with control of one castle and a hero. As you gain HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC wealth, you can upgrade your castle, raise greater armies, recruit spell-casting wizards and warlike fighters, and wage war on your three rivals. As you send your heroes out to explore the world, they find mines and towns to add to your kingdom's production, discover artifacts, and gain experience by fighting monsters and rival heroes. The goal, though, is to conquer the world and vanquish the three other warlords in the realm. This game supports multiple players by hotseat, modem, or network play-which is good, since this game isn't nearly as fun when played alone. You can choose to play either a long campaign or single scenarios. The graphics are beautiful, and the worlds you explore are all extensive and blacked-out, waiting for discovery. This is that rare hybrid game that will appeal to first-time gamers and veterans alike. $69.95, New World Computing, (800) 3258898, (818) 889-5600 136 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1995 "

"HOLIDAY S T R A T E GY WARCRAFT II HOLIDAY Once again, orcs and humans will engage in endless warfare in Blizzard's WARCRAFT II. This time around, the venue has changed. There are large-scale naval battles, with sub marines, frigates, and carriers. To create an even more fantastic feel, new monster troops have been added, such as trolls. Like the original WARCRAFT, you can choose either the orc or human side and battle it out with your opponent over a semi-linked campaign. There is the requisite multiplayer option, with support for up to seven players. You will still have to harvest lumber, gold, and ore to maintain your war production, but now you'll also have to find oil to keep those massive fleets going. Those seeking a challenging opponent shouldn't be too displeased; the Al has been given a major upgrade, and will not be so foolish or rigid this time around. WARCRAFT II is a much bigger and more extensive improvement over the original, and should provide players with great fun bashing orcs (or humans). $39.95, Blizzard, (800) 953-SNOW. WARCRAFT II STRATEGIES GALORE Sht ASCENDANCY ASCENDANCY is similar to other space strategies like MASTER OF ORIon, but it has more going for it than just its tried-and-true concept. It delivers great SVGA graphics, a very Star Trek-like soundtrack, and an incredibly extensive universe. You start out on a single planet, building structures that increase your production, research, or industry. As your research increases, you will gain the technology to colonize other star systems and meet the other alien races in the universe. The diplomacy in this game is not as extensive as in MASTER OF ORION, but the aliens all have unique personalities, to say the least. It does look like the Logic Factory put a great deal of effort into creating realistic, scientifically viable aliens with unique qualities and perspectives on life. They are amazingly successful, and manage to create a very engrossing universe. One setback is the less-than-intuitive interface. Also, when researching new technologies, the computer doesn't tell you beforehand what the benefits of each technology are. In general, though, the breadth of strategic options outweigh the faults of this game. $49.95, Logic Factory /Broderbund, (800) 521-6263, (415) 382-4700 It seems that the galaxies of gaming are teeming with all sorts of intelligent life. The grandest of scales belongs to the long-awaited strategic empire-builder Pax IMPERIA II. Resurrected by Blizzard, this game has graphics and an interface that could leave MASTER OF ORION in the galactic dust, but now it looks as if MASTER OF ANTARES will, be out first. Still, if the ship-building in Moo was too simple for you, try out this complex affair-playable either real-time or turn-based with network support. A more fun alien romp may be had with GREEN THINGS FROM OUTER SPACE. Tom Wham's comic masterpiece for Steve Jackson Games comes to a computer nebula near you courtesy of QQP. As aliens-more funny than scary proliferate on your already-crowded spaceship, you turn to everything from zap guns to fire extinguishers in an attempt to stay the otherworldly menace. Given QQP's, tendency to produce balanced, enjoyable games, it seems that the Znutar will bring a lot of enjoyment to earth-bound gamers-whenever QQP manages to finish the campaign game. It also seems that the litigation between FASA and New World Computing has died down a bit. As a result, METAL LORDS (formerly MECHLORDS) may finally get published. A rich blend of politics and corruption, 'bot combat and maneuver on a grand scale, this game could be to, strategic mech combat what MECHWARRIOR II was to tactical.

"2 HOLIDAY W A R G A M E S ALLIED GENERAL A cigarette flickers in the darkness, the ash stretching as if to defy gravity. Removing it from its hiding place (a three-day growth of beard), the duty Sergeant absentmindedly flicks the butt into the cold, damp ground. Looking over his list, he checks off each item: SVGA graphics: Windows 95 interface (he mulls a bit over that one); new Allied weapons and unit loadout new campaigns; even tougher Al. \"What'll they think of next?\" he muses, as he signs the list-everything was ready for the invasion, which had been given the code name of ALLIED GENERAL men and materiel although the relative inexperience of the Gls makes for a pretty balanced contest versus the seasoned Wehrmacht. The greatest challenge, however, comes from playing the Soviets. Here, you must survive the whirlwind onslaught of the Germans and stop them before they reach the gates of Moscow. And even though you have wave upon wave of troops and wonderful artillery to aid your patriotic cause, there is still a sense of urgency as each battle unfolds.

But the wargames available for this holiday season offer much more than pretty situation maps and finely-detailed tanks. They bring smoother interfaces, stronger computer opponents, and a greater sense of realism than ever before. And, while WWII is still a fertile field, designers are letting us explore other theaters of warfare, trom knights clashing in medieval castles to proud frigates letting carronades fly on the high seas. There is even--finally--a good Civil War game. So, strap those bayonets on your muskets, and get ready for the best \"historical\" holiday we've seen in quite a while! As SSI approaches their own D-Day with the imminent release of ALLIED GENERAL, the obvious question is whether any game can successfully follow both the critical and commercial success of PANZER GENERAL. The thrill of finally playing the Good Guys is enhanced by three distinct campaign styles. As a British general, you are the next Monty, sending the Afrika Korps reeling across the desert sands. Should you emerge triumphant, you may either retire a war hero, or continue fighting the Germans after D-Day for even more glory. For sheer blood-and-guts, Pattonesque-play, it's hard to resist the American superiority in es, it's all here, with the Al-already among the best of any wargame-improved from PANZER GENERAL. Other welcome additions make it harder to cheat during e-mail play and add more slots for saved games (for those generals with multiple human adversaries). The Win 95 engine runs smooth as silk and saves time by letting you keep several windows open at once. While it may not be the genre-buster that PG was, ALLIED GENERAL is proof that sequels, when done right, are often the best that the industry has to offer.

"HOLIDAY W A R GAMES STEEL PANTHERS WOODEN SHIPS & IRON MEN HOLIDAY HOLIDAY paigns are varied and challenging. While one could wish for a better computer opponent, and there are a few bugs (seemingly inevitable these days), it's obvious that STEEL PANTHERS bridges the gap between realism and playability better than any computer wargame has for a very long time. $64.95, SSI, (800) 601-7529. Cynics would have you believe that the wargaming in the post-PANZER GENERAL era is fun, but lacking in substance. STEEL PANTHERS shows that, quite to the contrary, you can have accessibility right alongside a hefty dose of realism. The newfound SSI love for elegant interfaces is readily apparent, but it can't disguise the Gary Grigsby touch: every small-arms.weapon and armor type is painstakingly researched; the use of combined arms tactics is rewarded; and the game faithfully recreates the Smoke-filled chaos of the WWII battlefield. The graphics are so stunning that it's hard to believe this is a wargame, and the sounds capture both the screaming velocity of mortar shells and the \"chink\" of near-misses more than adequately. The game plays briskly, even in two-player mode, and the camSTEEL PANTHERS 11100 One of the most valuable lessons that Stanley Associates learned from designing 5th Fleet for Avalon Hill was that they had remained perhaps too faithful to the board game. However, all traces of board game awkwardness are notably absent from the computer version of WOODEN SHIPS & IRON MEN (WS&IM). The cardboard counters and hexagons have been replaced with an eight-point movement system and 3-D STUDIO-rendered ships-of-theline. The details that made the board game great, however, are still here. Would-be sea captains must select from solid, double and chain shot; form boarding parties; put out fires; blast away enemy rigging; and juggle between battle, full and mid-sail. Noted designer Joe Balkoski has worked with the design team to include options not even included in the paper version, making WS&IM the most accurate high seas simulation yet seen on the computer, without the tedium of charts and excessive die-rolling. EMPIRE IL CONSTITUTION SRO QU game lets you get right to the heart of the fighting without having to worry about all that boring stuff.\" A package greater than the sum of its parts, this is both a fine introduction to wargaming and a guilty pleasure for any veteran gamer, with the latter likely to get the most out of the \"design your own\" features. $49.95, New World, (800) 325-8898. If you expect this game to be a facelift of the popular EMPIRE DELUXE, think again. Eschewing the strategic scope of its predecessor, EMPIRE Il attempts to portray battles from prehistory to the modern age and beyond, using a grand-tactical scale. Whereas most games covering multiple historical eras fail, Empire Il somehow manages to inject enough period flavor into the battles that Gettysburg, for example, has a different feel than the Battle of Waterloo. In addition to the 30plus battles included, the easyto-use editor makes it a breeze to whip up battles as famous or obscure as your campaigning tastes require. Morale, supply and logistical factors are liandled simply but cleanly, and the WOODEN SHIPS & IRON MEN Blo EMPIRE IL Whether you sail proud French corvettes against the haughty British and Lord Nelson, or take command of the Constitution in a War of 1812 campaign, one thing's for sure there has never been a game which captured the flavor of crossing the \"T\" and unleashing a fiery broadside quite so well as this.

"BATTLEGROUND: GETTYSBURG It doesn't seem that long ago that CGW (and our readers) was complaining loudly about the BATTLEGROUND: GETTYSBURG lack of good American Civil War games. It seems that our prayers have finally been answered with this second in Talonsoft's BATTLEGROUND series, a rousing rendition of the greatest battle in The War Between The States. The game system does a nice job of differentiating between melee and fire combat, and emphasizes morale, always a must for a good Civil War game. The maps, created by former Avalon Hill artist Charlie Kibler, give Rand McNally a run for the money, and they are functional. Even at the early beta stage when we saw the game, the computer opponent seems to have improved upon that of BATTLEGROUND: ARDENNES; the question will be how well it carries out a sustained plan in the campaign scenario, where you fight through all three days of Gettysburg. From the miniatures-style formations of soldiers to the more subtle modeling of line and column, artillery and rifled muskets, this game has something for the General Lee in all of us. $49.95, Talonsoft, (410) 821-7282. PERFECT GENERAL II QQP, like most companies, has had its share of disappointments, but when the folks from Jersey are on target, it's hard to find games that are more enjoyable. Such is the case with Perfect GENERAL II, a game that offers a fun, if only passingly historical, view of 20th-century warfare. Any game trying to replay both Stalingrad and Desert Storm with the same system is bound to elicit howls from realism-minded gamers, but PG Il blithely rolls along, confident that its tried-and-true, turn-based system will see it through. Artillery is king of the battlefield, and air power is pretty limited, but the game does reward combined arms, and also encourages flank, rather than frontal attacks. A riot for twoplayer contests, this is not up to the sustained brilliance of PANZER GENERAL, but it is a nice, light wargame. $69.95, QQP. (908) 788-2799.

"PANTHERS IN THE SHADOWS \"The answer is: It figures shell velocity, allowing for angle of deflection, type of ammunition, thickness of target armor and differences PANTHERS IN THE SHADOWS 000 VS OO ***00 RSS @ in pockets of air pressure between the firing unit and its target.\" Well, Alex, the question must be, \"What is the new game from HPS Simulations?\" Yes, the last bastion of realistic-to-the-extreme wargames scores another hit, with even more number-crunching data with which to wow the tread-heads. The good news for normal wargamers is that PANTHERS shows a lot of improvements over its sibling, TIGERS ON THE PROwl. First, the graphics, while no threat to STEEL PANTHERS, are certainly clearer and less of an eyesore. Plus, the already competent Al is better this time around, especially when counter-punching—and HPS Als never cheat. Not for the faint of heart, but if you want a powerful game engine that will challenge both your knowledge of history and your abilities as an armchair general, look no further. $69.95, HPS Simulations, (408) 5548381. @ 1 # CONQUEROR: 1086 AD Some 20 years after the Norman victory at Hastings, you become the next in a line of conquerors. Our first question upon seeing this game was: why? After all, LORDS OF THE REALM had already managed to make medieval husbandry fun. But what Software Sorcery has done is to focus less on the realistic aspects of Dark Ages England, and more on the enjoyable aspects of being a knightly lord. CONQUEROR is an Errol Flynn romp, filled with valiant defenses, jousting for the honor of fair maidens, and sword fights everywhere you turn. The most disappointing aspect of the combat is that the sieges are fairly realistic, so that you can't use those catapults in DEFENDER OF THE Crown-style fashion to E shatter your enemy's ramparts. Regardless, this is an enjoyable game on a neglected period of history, $54.95, Software Sorcery, (619) 452-9901, CONQUEROR: 1086 AD 148 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. DECEMBER 1995 "

"HOLIDAY BATTLEGROUND: ARDENNES HOUDAY BATTLEGROUND: ARDENNES 100 It's rare that a new wargame company makes much of a start with this title. The scale is more than tactical, less than opersplash in terms of units sold, but Talonsoft is off to a solid ational, but it seems to work reasonably well in recreating the Battle of the Bulge. The less-experienced U.S. units still have Hatic for Bastogne, December 19, 1944 File Phase Units Assault Reinforcements Status Display Options Help good morale, and tend to hold out in places like St. Vith and Bastogne, as they did historically. The Germans have all the wonderful hardware, but rarely do they get enough fuel for their needs. The road network is a maze in the winter-as well it should be—yet the game system keeps the flow of play moving well enough to avoid tedium. This game pioneers a \"cutaway stacked hexagon\" side-view, which gives the old hex grid a new lease on life, familiar and fresh simultaneously. BATTLEGROUND: ARDENNES might not satisfy the purist, but it's a good challenge for those who prefer more tradional wargaming fare. $49.95, Talonsoft, (410) 821-7282. LubaZOendra ORDERS RE:0 3 Atk08 May 20 Bos19 Del Mc Quietre Pe Time 00.00 (Limit 03.00) Allied Artilery Fire Phase (12.16) COMING DOWN THE WARPATH BATTLES IN TIME It seems that in the far future, the human race has eliminated poverty, sickness and war. All well and good, until a militaristic alien race shows up to crash the party. Your mission—and you have no choice but to accept it is to travel back through time, re-learning the lessons of war, so that you may return and defeat the menace from the stars. On the Hokey Scale, this premise definitely ranks up near the summit, but once begun, the game has more than a little of that QQP play-balance and charm. The graphics build on the SVGA palette of THE PERFECT GENERAL II and the interface is better than a lot of QQP titles (I'm still holding out on the manual, however). Since the game covers all of history, the potential variety is incredible. Our main complaint with the beta version we saw was that the units of each era had not yet been tweaked so that they had distinct flavors. If this \"vanilla\" problem is rendered moot through additional spice, the game should appeal to a wide audience. For a \"move, fight and be damned\" wargame with few frills but many hours of gameplay, this game should deliver. $59.95, QQP, (908) 788-2799. It probably won't make Christmas, but THE LAST BLITZKRIEG looks to be a winner for SSG regardless of when it ships. Roger Keating and lan Trout always develop some of the best Als in the business, and this game should build on the lessons learned from the already tough computer opponents of WARLORDS II. What our friends from Australia are striving for is a game with the playability of WARLORDS and even more realism than their old BATTLEFRONT System. Of course, there are WWII games designed on the home front as well. By the time you read this, D-Day, evidently the last of the WORLD AT WAR series Atomic Games is doing for Avalon Hill, should be released. This is not a computer version of the AH, boardgame, but sort of an update and expansion of the old UTAH Beach title, with obviously better AL and the newer Atomic interface. Speaking of Atomic, they have officially signed with Microsoft, with whom they plan to publish a WWII tactical real-time game, formerly known as BEYOND SQUAD LEADER, with a different name.

"HOLIDAY 502 HARDWARE SOUND CANVAS How do you spell disappointment? Try loading up a hot new game on your advanced desktop PC and hearing music that sounds like it's coming from a kid's toy. While digital audio (i.e. sound effects and voices) has become standard on many new multimedia systems, the equipment you need for quality music playback-Wavetable synthesis-is just now coming into age. Old-style FM syntheve Convos a SOUND CANVAS hill, this is the one. This mighty daughter card (a device which snaps onto sound cards with the WAVE BLASTER feature connector, like Creative Labs' AWE32) is all you need to really get the rich music out of your games-music that's just waiting for you to let it out of the bottle. Several of the developers we talk to actually compose game music on the SOUND CANVAS, so when you use one of these cards, you hear the muHoland sic as the artists did when they composed it. Instruments don't drown each other out--it's unlikely that you'll hear a baseline overpowering the melody of a given song. There are two models of the SOUND CANVAS: the SCD-10 and the SCD-15. The difference between the two is that the latter has the entire 354-sound GS patch set (an extended version of General MIDI, which has only 128 sounds). If GS ever takes off, it may behoove you to be compatible. Additionally, the Roland Sound Canvas is available as a standalone ISA card, the SCC-1, which is great for those of you who don't have a sound card with the necessary feature connector. Also, standalone external modules that plug into your sound card's MIDI port, as well as a PC Card (the new name for PCMCIA) variant, are available. The SOUND CANVAS was Computer Gaming Worlds Editor's Choice for daughtercard and stand-alone General MIDI sound card for gamers from our October Sound Card Roundup. Daughtercards: SCD-10 $259, SCD-15 $329; ISA Card: SCC-1 $399; Roland: (213) 685-5141. by Mike Weksler & Loyd Case Then Santa comes down your chimney this year, forget the milk and cookies—just leave him a computer toolkit and a note asking him to install your new computer hardware! This holiday season should prove to be a bonanza for anyone looking to improve their system, with the emphasis on speed, innovation, and more attention to superior audio. Hard disks are faster, hold more data, and are cheaper than ever. Additionally, low-priced, high-speed modems are the norm and CD-ROM technology is booming. The level of innovation in game-related peripherals is equally astonishing, with programmable throttles and joysticks as the hot items. Finally, the latest crop of sound cards (some of which rival professional MIDI keyboard in sound quality and highend multimedia speakers are increasingly affordable, sis--the common denominator for music playback on soundcards—is proving to be the Achilles heel for game music composers. Storing music data in a MIDI file (like a player piano scroll) takes up very little space on a game's CD or on your hard disk, but there's no guarantee that you'll hear the music as intended by the composer unless you have a good wavetable sound card. (Music can also be digitally recorded so that it plays back like an audio CD, but that takes up considerable storage space.) Wavetable sound cards actually record samples of real instruments, so a piano sounds like a piano instead of some weird electronic device. Most wavetable sound cards are General MIDI compatible; this is a standard that allows wavetable synthesizers to be compatible so that a file created on one General MIDI synthesizer will play back on another company's synthesizer. This year, we highlight the Roland SOUND CANVAS-if any sound product is king of the 160 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  DECEMBER 1995 "

"HOLIDAY HARDWARE FIREBALL 1080 # 6-PLEX HOUDAY slick package at this price, but if you're interested in a big, fast drive at a great price, don't overlook the FIREBALL. $220 (street price), Quantum, (800) 624-5545. If there's any certainty in the computer biz, it's that over time software will need more of everything--more CPU, more memory and more disk space. One of the best Christmas presents a game player can get is a big hard disk—the bigger the better. Last Christmas, a one-gigabyte hard disk was an expensive luxury, but drive prices have been dropping at a feverish rate. But size isn't everything: performance counts as well. One of the faster hard disks on the market is the Quantum Fireball 1080. At a street price of $220 for the EIDE version and $300 for the SCSI drive, it's also a good choice for the cost-conscious. The one gigabyte FIREBALL gets its fast speed from its 12-millisecond access time, 5400-RPM rotational speed and magnetoresistive (MR) heads (there's a word for your next cocktail party.) Don't expect a FIREBALL 1080 The Plextor drive was the first sixspeed drive to hit the market, and is still one of the fastest, sporting an average access time of 145 milliseconds. Although a number of other six-speed (and one eightspeed) drives have hit the market, the Plextor is still a quick, reliable performer. The 6-Plex is a SCSI drive, so you'll need a SCSI interface, and the drive uses caddies for the CDs. (However, this allows the drive to be mounted sideways if necessary.) We used the 6-Plex for several months, and it rapidly became one of our favorites. Plextor's parent company manufactures industrial CD drives (you know, music for dentist's offices...), so we anticipate long service from this drive. The 6-Plex is a little on the pricey side, but in this case, you definitely get what you pay for. $509 (internal), $549 (with 16-bit SCSI host adapter), Plextor, (800) 886-3935. PENTIUM OVERDRIVE PENTIUM OVERDRIVE You're ready to upgrade, superscalar architecture, branch predic1100 but you don't want to sink tion, and a faster math co-processor. $2,000 into a new system. With a suggested list price of $299, the Enter Intel's 83-MHz Pentium OVERDRIVE procesPentium OVERDRIVE becomes a viable upsor upgrade.

If we could give any advice to all the gamers out there, it's three words (read in your best Denis Leary voice): GET A MODEM! Find multiplayer opponents, get technical support, hang out with game developers, and even browse the web. But, if you want to cruise the info highway, you need a ride. The SPORTSTER V.34 (U.S. Robotics, not Harley-Davidson) is a 28.8 V.34 data/fax modem that's fast, easy to use, and ships with software that will get you on line without much fuss. While it's hard to get too excited about a modem, the SPORTSTER V.34 really has some features to peak your interest. At 28,800 bits per second, World Wide Web pages actually load at a bearable speed. The external version (and external modems in general) has LEDs on the unit so you can keep an eye on the status of your connection. Another really useful feature is the volume knob on the side of the external unit at last, you can listen in on your session without your non-computer-using neighbors thinking you're firing phasers in your living room. Finally, all the settings you need to make are right on the back of the modem via a few DIP switches (the settings info is printed right on the bottom of the modem).

This year, the DYNAMITE has been eclipsed by another, even hotter DOS performer from Hercules: the STINGRAY 64 VIDEO, which posted the fastest DOS benchmarks we'd ever seen. Windows performance is respectable as well. Hercules has had some teething problems with its digital video support, but they seem to be in the past now. The STINGRAY 64 Video, available in PCI only, is based on the ARK 2000PV graphics controller, and comes with either one or two megabytes of memory.

Altec Lansing Multimedia's ACS-500 speakers not only feature crisp sound and a booming subwoofer, but also genuine Dolby Pro-Logic surround sound. Imagine sound that seems to not only come from behind your ears, but also from a center channel speaker that really isn't there, while bass thunders forth from the 6.5-inch, 40-watt subwoofer. The huge, 18-inch tall ACS-500 satellites offer superior stereo separation, and the system can be expanded to use rearsurround speakers and a center channel speaker. The only drawback we could find is that the power switch is awkwardly located in the rear of one of the satellite speakers. Additionally, there is no tone control; however, there are controls for both centering and surround levels, as well as separate volume controls for the subwoofer and the satellites. While there are no games that we know of that are encoded for Dolby Pro-Logic, if you play your audio CDs on your computer's CDROM drive and you are looking for good sound with rich bass response, then this system is definitely worth considering.

Madeline and her friends want to stage a puppet show to save neighbor Monsiur Benet and his animals, but first she must find all the things she needs to put on the show. Gameplay is very similar to the FREDDi Fish and Purt Purt adventures, where hot spots set off quirky animations or reveal objects needed to get on with the game. When all the pieces are gathered, you participate in staging the show by assembling the puppets, painting the backdrop, and designing the invitations. Players direct the show by choosing a course of action for the puppets to follow at key decision points, thereby creating a different show each time the game is played. Adventurers may also stop by the classroom, where Miss Clavel teaches French or Spanish through a series of concentration-type matching games. The program is gorgeous to look at, with graphics faithful to Ludwig Bemelmans' books, but the background music is tinny and annoying, even plinking away right over the music that accompanies animated sequences. Thankfully, it can be turned off. The cast from the television show supplies voices, with Christopher Plummer providing flawless narration. $39.95, Creative Wonders, (800) 543-9778, (415) 513-7555. 333 Euca brradura Cape balloons gumballs ELROY GOES BUGZERK HOLIDAY spite these flaws, Elroy and Blue are likable characters that won't insult children or parents, and the story is excellent, with a sly, rapid-fire style reminiscent of Bullwinkle cartoons. Remarkable, too, is the sophisticated graphic style, which places retro-60s animation over sepia-toned photographic backgrounds. Ages 7-12. $49.95, Headbone Interactive, (800) 267-4709. H0 The first entry in a new series of adventure games from Headbone Interactive, Elroy GOES Bugzerk introduces our hero and his hound dog Blue. They must capture a rare bug, the elusive Technoloptera, in order to keep the nefarious Gordon Smugs from winning this year's Insectathon. Elroy's problems are compounded when his parents send him to stay with an uncle who lives on a farm, and chaos ensues when Blue eats a birthday cake meant for Elroy's aunt. Players must help Elroy and Blue bake a new cake and capture the bug in time for the contest. Along the way they'll pick up interesting facts about bugs, which must be used later to solve puzzles. These aren't just a dry collection of textbook yawners, either. Elroy enlightens us, for instance, as to how a swarm of locusts once covered a 75-square-mile area in an inch of dung in a matter of hours. The game suffers from a lack of interaction-players must watch several long animated sequences without manipulating the action at all and some may be frustrated by the way a wrong decision will suddenly land them back at the beginning of the game.

"HOLIDAY 12 FAMILY SOFTWARE HOW MANY BUGS IN A BOX? . C HOLIDAT David A. Carter's popular pop-up counting book comes to life on the computer, and as soon as those tiny fingers can press a mouse button, younger children will enjoy counting all those HOW MANY BUGS IN A BOX? big colorful friendly bugs. Players have the option of reading an animated version of the book, playing eight games that strengthen basic skills such as counting, reading and color-recognition, or hanging out in the Juice Bar. Each section has a difficulty setting that can be raised as children master each level. The host bugs give lots of guidance and cheerful encouragement, and a clean, simple interface makes navigation very easy. Lots of perky songs and animations keep things jumping. Be warned, though, that the Juke Box in the Juice Bar plays songs over and over and over. ... Ages 3-6. $49.95, Simon & Schuster, (800) 223-2336, (201) 7675000) NEW FOR THE KIDS ST RESTPM OZZIE'S WORLD Remember those big, chunky activity books you had as a kid that kept you busy for hours when you were stuck in the house? Ozzie's WORLD is a kind of animated activity book for your computer, providing a smorgasbord of activities for kids to explore ecological and environmental themes. Most of these are hands-on experiments that children need to carry out away from the computer. These range from very simple tasks, such as an experiment where a rubber band stretched over the hand simulates a seal's flipper, to more involved activities, like throwing a party or building a tropical rainforest terrarium. Each of the experiments is detailed in the user's manual, so parents need not frantically take notes or run through the sequences again and again. Games and activities are organized by theme in each of the areas of Ozzie's neighborhood: beach, garden, veternarian's office, forest and bedroom. The games include jigsaw puzzles, pair-matching games, hidden picture puzzles, and relational sorting games. Though the interface is a bit cluttered, it encourages kids to explore by clicking around. Absolutely jam-packed with things to do, Ozzie's World should keep kids busy for quite a while. Ages 3-8. $39.95, Digital Pictures, (800) 775-4232, (918) 742-2022. There are a couple of other good picks coming out of Santa's workshop this winter. As any bookstore owner will tell you, teenagers love a good scare, so Sierra Online is releasing SHIVERs, an adventure set in an abandoned museum, for the Fear Street crowd. Like the much-hyped PHANTASMAGORIA, emphasis is on the spooky story rather than puzzle-solving, but unlike that adult game, SHIVERS allows for replayability by changing the puzzles once they are solved, and the first-person perspective adds to the chill factor by putting the player right in the story. Creepy visuals and haunting music complete the package for what looks to be good shivery fun. If the idea of Junior toddling up to your beautiful new Pentium and putting his zwieback-coated fingers all over that shiny mouse makes you cringe, Maxis is working on a new title that will let you breathe easier. MARTY AND THE TROUBLE WITH CHEESE is a voice-controlled children's title that allows players to interact through a microphone. More storybook than game, the version we looked at did not truly allow players to make decisions for Marty; what a player says has little effect on Marty's course of action. Freed from the necessity to push a mouse button, or to recognize letters on a keyboard, toddlers will get a kick out of finally being able to use a computer like the big kids, even if only in a very limited way.

"HOLIDAY STOCKING STUFFERS MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95 An operating system as a stocking-stuffer? Certainly, especially when it will avoid that sad, Christmas-morning realization of \"batteries not included\" when one of the gifts under the tree is a hot new game that requires Windows 95 to run If you're running a 486 with 8 MB or more, you'll find Win 95 useful right out of the box. It's packed with features that will help you when you're using your PC for the \"serious\" stuff—it's got Internet connectivity, a better user interface, ing system-it's much more solid than Win 3.1. It's not as crash-proof as Windows NT, but try running DOOM II under NT. (It's like watching a silent movie in slow motion.) Win 95 is the bridge that will take gamers and home users into the realm of 32-bit computing without forcing them to sacrifice performance or compatibility. Of course, like many things you'll find under your tree this year, Win 95 has an element of Fi Windows 95 CD ROM DEX Windows 95 Tour red Nepal Microsoft Windows95 Microsoft Exposition Hover!

Add/Romovo Software Plecyckelry Start Windows 95 CD-ROM 334 429PM by Keith Hunter here's more to life than computer games. At least, that's what someone told us once; we're still not sure about that. But in case you do spend some of your time hacking around with your computer, optimizing its performance, or gazing at full-motion video, we decided to take a look at some of the better products out there that aren't games. (Although if you tried to install Windows 95 over your old Win 3.1 setup, you might have gotten that «You're in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike\" feeling that made you think you were in an adventure game all over again.) and a set of utility applets that are much more useful than their Win 3.1 predecessors. More important than what's in the box, though, is the potential that it gives your PC. Win 95 games support AutoPlay, so installing a CD and running it is a simple matter of sliding it into the drive. The DirectX drivers in Microsoft's Game SDK promise games with amazingly fast graphics— faster than their DOS predecessors even as well as improved digital sound, easy controller setup, and powerful networking capabilities. And perhaps the biggest panacea is the Win 95 memory architecture. Once you're running primarily Win 95 games, you'll no longer have to deal with multiple configurations and stacks of boot disks. Although you may hesitate to upgrade until the first set of bug-fix patches ships, it turns out that Win 95 is a remarkably stable operat\"some assembly required.\" It will run almost all your old Win 3.1 applications and Windows games with no problem, but running your DOS games is going to require you to set up properties dialog boxes for each game, or to configure your system so you can boot back into MS-DOS mode for playing games. This initial hassle should pass quickly, though, as more games are designed specifically for Win 95, or at least tested for compatibility with the new operating system. If you plan to surf the Internet or if you're cramped for hard drive space, you might also check out the Plus! add-on, which adds DoubleSpace 3 disk compression, better TCP/IP Internet support, and loads of graphics, sounds, and pointers for your desktop. $209 (stand-alone), $109 (upgrade), Microsoft, (206) 882-8080. 186 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  DECEMBER 1995 "

"Part One: The Ultimate Gaming Machine The Upgrade Strategy That's Right For You Whether you have an old war-horse PC or a hot showroom-stock Pentium, you can squeeze more performance out of it with some key upgrades. Loyd Case explains the issues related to each major component, to help give you the Big Picture before you start buying the parts. by Loyd Case hen FALCON 3.0 arrived on the scene, most game players were shocked to discover that the game wouldn't perform well unless they had a 33-megahertz 386. One of Falcon's modes even used a floating point Co-processor. FALCON 3.0 also consumed a thenmassive 10+ megabytes of disk space. That was in 1991. Since then, the average system require ment for computer games has been ratcheting up steadily. Until recently, the rate of change has been somewhat predictable, but in the last few months, large numbers of games have shipped that have seemingly staggering system requirements. There are some games today that require 16 megabytes of RAM to run at high resolution, and others that will gladly eat up all the CPU cycles a 133-MHz Pentium can throw at it and then grab you by the throat and demand more. This has left many gamers with the dilemma of upgrading. Do I go out and buy a new system? Will more memory be enough? Just how much can I get for my money? Some gamers no doubt believe that a PC is a black hole on your desk into which you throw money. Nonetheless, there are strategies you can pursue to upgrade your system. Your strategy for upgrading depends a lot on what equipment you have. If your PC is an old 386, your best bet is to throw it out and buy a new system. On the other hand, you may have a fairly new Pentium that doesn't offer quite the performance you expected. First, we'll look at three typical systems, and suggest upgrade strategies for each. Then we'll look closer at the components and discuss performance issues in more detail. DECEMBER 1995 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 205 "


"houses will let you change the configuration a bit, but only if they carry an item in stock. If you buy a pre-built system at a retail store like Circuit City, you're out of luckyou'll just have to upgrade later. Don't underrate the local clone vendor-they can usually build you a system to your specifications, but it will be more expensive than an offthe-shelf system, TECHNOLOGY SECTION THE MODEL T Okay, so you have a 386 or old 486 system; if you're lucky, you've got a VESA local bus graphics card. Your 486 probably runs at 33 MHz, maybe 66. It's likely you've got an IDE hard disk and 4 to 8 megabytes of RAM in 30-pin SIMMs. The best thing to do is buy a new system. You can keep the old system for multi-player games, for your kids, or sell it off (although don't expect much in the way of resale value.) If you're budget constrained, we'd suggest a short-term strategy of upgrading to a faster CPU, if your system can handle it. If there's an overdrive socket, you can add a faster 486, such as a 100 MHz DX4. If you have a P24T (Pentium Overdrive) socket (look for an empty row of holes encircling your 486 chip), then you can add a Pentium overdrive. The faster CPU will run most current games adequately, although you might need to turn the detail level down. In other words, if you have a 386 or slow 486 with slow parts, stop and save your money until you can get a whole new system. then you can buy a faster processor. Most 75 MHz-capable systems can handle at least 100 MHz chips, and many can handle 120 or 133 MHz Pentiums. If you have one of the newer, high-speed 486 systems, then there's still hope. It's highly likely that a newer 486, say a 100 MHz DX/4 system, has some pretty good components, 72-pin SIMM memory and PCI graphics. In that case, you can go to your local clone shop and have them swap the motherboard for a fast Pentium board. If you want to do this, don't get anything less than a 90 MHz Pentium, or you might not see much in the way of performance improvement. If you're inclined, you can do the swap SUM OF ITS PARTS So you're ready to upgrade. Where do you start, and what's the highest-priority replacement? Let's take a look at the various pieces to the puzzle, discuss what they each do, and give you some tips on what you should look for in performance upgrades. THE PROCESSOR The microprocessor in that box on the desk is the brains of the system. The best set of peripherals in the world won't make up for a lack of CPU horsepower. As recently as 15 months ago, the choices were fairly simple: do you get a 486 or a Pentium? Pentium systems were pretty pricey, and games hadn't gotten to the point where they would overwhelm a 486, so a lot of people opted for a fast 486, usually running at 66 megahertz. Now Pentium prices are dropping faster than the stock market in 1929, and the number of different Pentium variants is staggering. You can now buy Pentium systems that run at six different speeds: 60, 75, 90, 100 and 133 megahertz. Soon, Intel will be shipping 150 and 166 megahertz variants, but they'll likely be dropping the 60 and 90 megahertz chips. On top of that, there are a variety of 486s out there. There's still the venerable 486-66, now the bottom of the barrel in performance. A lot of today's games specify the 486-66 as a minimum requirement to run the game. In addition, there's the DX/4 75 megahertz (although you almost never see those in desktop systems—they appear mostly in portables) and DX/4 100 megahertz 486s. Now add into the mix the Overdrive chips, which include DX/4s and Pentium Overdrives. These are chips that plug into a special THE FAMILY CAR Let's say you have a fast 100 MHz 486 or a midrange Pentium, say a 75 MHz system. The trick here is to take an inventory of the capabilities of the different components of the system. Do you have a slow graphics card? What kind of hard disk does it have? How much memory? The best short-term trick is to add more memory, particularly if you have 8 megabytes or less. Adding RAM to get to 16 megabytes is about the best performance kicker you can get in the short term. Next, look at your graphics card—if it's a slow performer, move up to a faster card. Third comes mass storage-a fast hard disk, then a quad-speed CD-ROM drive or better. One point about the newer Pentium systems is that the motherboard is very likely capable of handling multiple clock rates. If you're running a 75 MHz Pentium and you feel comfortable popping open the hood, or know somebody who can, INTEL PENTIUM OVERDRIVE PROCESSOR yourself (see this month's \"Under the Hood\" on page 422). THE SHOWROOM STOCK Okay, so you've dropped three or four grand on the hottest retail rig you can find from Dell, HP, Micron or any of a host of vendors. What's next? Most of the high-end systems have some minor flaws. It might be the graphics card, it could be the amount of memory, or the monitor. Often, the sound card is problematic.

"TECHNOLOGY SECTION socket in your computer and effectively replace the existing CPU. There are also Intel alternatives. Cyrix makes a line of 486 compatible chips, but they lack a floating point co-processor (see below), although you can add one externally. Additionally, their performance hasn't been as good as the equivalent Intel chip. Some software developers have reported minor incompatibilities. AMD makes a line of 486 chips as well these are much closer to the Intel 486 in performance and compatibility. AMD ships 66 and 80 megahertz DX/2 variants, as well as 100 and 120 megahertz DX/4. (The \"DX/2\" and \"DX/4\" refers to the internal speed of the processor. A DX/2 always runs at twice the speed of the external clock; for example, a 66 MHz will talk to the outside world at 33 MHz. The DX/4 nomenclature is more confusing; suffice it to say, it runs faster than the DX/2.) Then there are the Pentium clones. The only one actually on the market is the NexGen Nx586. There have been reported compatibility problems with some games, and the Nx586 doesn't have the juice of the equivalent Pentium—and it doesn't have floating point This brings up an interesting question: what good is floating point hardware? The floating point co-processor is the part of the microprocessor that deals with fractional numbers, such as 3.42. A CPU without floating point acceleration can do floating point, but very slowly. Still, does it matter with games? To date, only a few games use floating point. However, Intel has stated flatly that all future versions of the Pentium and beyond will have floating point hardware, so it's possible that future games might use the floating point hardware, particularly games like flight simulations. called the motherboard, but you'll also see referpresence of a local bus.

The next piece of the motherboard is the core logic chipset, usually just referred to as the chipset.

PNY TECHNOLOGY SECTION line Memory Module), commonly used in workstations and the newer Power Macintosh systems. There aren't any PCs that use DIMMs currently, but that will likely change because of the convenience factor: you'll be able to add a single DIMM to a Pentium Sys2009ANANANAND 16 MB SIMM RAM CHIP (72 PIN) GBUGBBULOOSOBODobboobbbbbUBOOOODS MEMORY Memory used to be simple: just add more, please. Unfortunately, while the price of every other PC peripheral or component has been falling fast, memory prices have actually increased a bit. There is currently a worldwide shortage of memory that will probably last well into 1996. In addition to the expense, there are now two kinds of memory: regular DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) and EDO (Extended Data Out) RAM. EDO memory is slightly faster, but also slightly more expensive. In addition, the system must specifically be able to support EDO memory, and only the latest systems do so. Also important is the memory speed. At a minimum, specify 70-nanosecond memory, which is the minimum requirement for most systems these days. Then there's the issue of the type of SIMM (Single In-line Memory Module). The SIMM is a tiny printed circuit board which holds the RAM chips. There are currently two types of SIMMs in common usage: 30 pin SIMMs, usually found in 486 systems, and 72-pin SIMMs, found in newer 486 and all Pentium systems. You typically need four identical 30 pin SIMMs before you can install them in a 486, or a single 72-pin SIMM. Since the data bus is twice as wide in a Pentium system, you need to buy a pair of 72-pin SIMMs at a time. The different SIMM types create a real problem if you're moving from an older 486 to a Pentium system. Suddenly, your old memory is useless. Luckily, market forces have been at work, and there are now a number of companies that will take older memory as a trade-in on newer memory. You lose some money in the process, but if you're careful, it's really a minimal loss. Looming on the horizon is the DIMM (Dual Intem to upgrade memory, instead of a pair of modules. There's one last issue. If you are contemplating a motherboard that uses Intel's Triton chipset, consider buying 32bit, non-parity SIMMs. Traditionally, PCs have used 36-bit SIMMs, which access memory in 9-bit wide chunks. The ninth bit was used for parity checking, which is a method of detecting a memory error. The Triton chipset doesn't support parity checking, so you can save yourself a few bucks by buying 32-bit SIMMs instead. If the clerk at your local computer store or catalog outlet is confused, tell them you want 72-pin SIMMS for the Macintosh. in a nutshell, memory can be somewhat confusing, but the rule of thumb is to buy as much as you can afford. If you're running Windows 95, get at least 16 megabytes (your wallet will scream in pain, but your computer will thank you). HARD DISKS The design and manufacture of hard disks is an arcane physical art, even more so than chip design. Hard disk designers live in a world of magnetic domains, flying heads and rotation speeds. One key performance spec out of whack means the entire hard disk performance suffers. Disk performance is important because of the increasing storage requirements of modern computer games and operating systems such as Windows 95. While many games allow you to run completely off of a CD, the best performance is obtained by loading frequently-used files onto the hard drive. A full install of ACROSS THE RHINE takes 90 megabytes; games which require 20 or more megabytes of disk space are quite common. With cost per megabyte at an all-time low, you should expect to purchase a 1.6 gigabyte hard disk such as the Western Digital CAVIAR AC31600 or the Maxtor DURANGO 7000 for under $500. Some games which use DOS extender technology create swap files, areas on the hard disk the game uses to store temporary data. The difference in perception of game speed in these games can vary radically between systems which are identical except for hard disk performance. What are some of the key performance parameters to look for? The list can be pretty long, but there are a few key ones: access time, rotational speed, data density, cache size and interface type. Access time (also referred to as average access time or occasionally, average seek time) is simply the time it takes the drive head to move from one part of the disk to another. Since hard disk heads are mechanical devices, there's always a delay as the head is moved to a different part of the disk. Access time is usually quoted in milliseconds. A few years ago, this performance spec was abused by some drive makers, but these days it's become fairly standardized. Look for access times faster than 12 milliseconds for good performance. High-performance drives have access times lower than nine milliseconds. Rotational speed is simply how fast the disk spins, in revolutions per minute (RPM). This actually varies all over the map, ranging from 3600 RPM to 7200 RPM. You'll see drives with intermeMASS STORAGE Mass storage encompasses a variety of ways of what's euphemistically termed \"persistent storage.\" Here, we'll focus on the two areas that have the most impact on game performance: hard disks and CD-ROM drives. First, there's the question of the drive interface. Check out the accompanying sidebar to see whether IDE or SCSI is the interface for you. 214 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  DECEMBER 1995 "

"parameters, such as CPU utilization, that are almost never quoted. * WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DRIVE K!! HARD DRIVE KIT BE WORLD UT PERMARE TECHNOLOGY SECTION Ouick Install how quickly a big install can go on a fast CD drive like the Plextor 6 Plex or the NEC MULTISPIN 6x. A more useful parameter is CPU utilization. Take quad-speed drives, for example. Quad speed drives, at 100% CPU utilization, will all pretty much behave the same they'll transfer data at their maximum speed of around 600 kilobytes per second. However, if the CPU is only 40% used for CD transfers, the data rate varies quite a bit from drive to drive, and is always less than the maximum 600 KB per second. This means that if your game streams data off the CD while you're playing, the CPU utilization will have an impact on how fast the data is loaded WESTERN DIGITAL CAVIAR AC31600 1.6 GB EIDE HARD DRIVE diate speeds: 4500 and 5400 RPM are typical You might think the faster the rotational velocity, the faster data can be streamed off the disk. To a degree, that's true, but another performance spec is related to rotation speed: data density. This is usually stated as track density, in tracks per inch or recording density (bits per inch). This is a pretty arcane parameter, but a good rule of thumb is the fewer the platters, the higher the data density Data density is important because the more densely packed the bits, the faster the disk can be read at a given speed. Thus, if all other parameters are equal, a disk with fewer platters will move data off the disk faster. (The current champion in this category, by the way, is IBM's ULTRASTAR series, which packs two gigabytes of data into two platters; expect to pay a serious price premium, however.) Cache size, also referred to as buffer size, is another important parameter. Within limits, the larger the cache, the better, although for most desktop PC systems, the point of diminishing returns occurs at around one megabyte; very few PC drives have buffers greater than 512 KB. Some disk drives load up their onboard control programs into part of the buffer, effectively reducing the real size of the cache. (This onboard cache is different from an operating system disk cache, such as Microsoft's SMARTDRIVE. For one thing, it operates at the speed of the hard disk; there's no computer between the disk and the cache. For another, it's always there, even when Smartdrive is off.) The faster drives have cache sizes of at least 128 KB. Finally, you should consider what interface type (SCSI V. EIDE) to get (see sidebar). Until recently, access time GRAPHICS ADAPTERS wasn't considered to be too significant. Since the The final puzzle piece in our performance coMPC level 2 specification called for an average nundrum is graphics performance.

"TECHNOLOGY SECTION Interface Wars: IDE VS SCSI Other than a few rare portable devices that attach to the parallel port, most storage devices use either an IDE or SCSI interface. Which is best for your application? terface, allows for the connection of up to seven devices for standard SCSI 2 interfaces, including scanners, Ho SCSI Mas DE is the easiest to set up and configure. Until recently, IDE drives have been limited to 528 megabytes, and you could only have two total drives on a system. The newer Enhanced IDE (EIDE) spec has pushed the limit up to four drives of up to 8.4 gigabytes each; conversely, you can attach CD-ROM drives and tape drives to EIDE interfaces. The interface is much faster than the old IDE as well, supporting transfer rates in excess of 16 megabytes per second. Finally, EIDE is inexpensive; most newer systems have PCI bus EIDE controllers built into the motherboard, and EIDE drives are less expensive than their SCSI counterparts. One important parameter when considering EIDE drives is the data transfer mode. Most newer drives support mode 3 PIO (programmed 10) or mode 4 PIO transfers. Mode 3 has an upper limit of around 13 megabytes per second, while mode 4 allows transfers of greater than 16 megabytes per second. Still, SCSI is the performance leader. SCSI, which stands for Small Computer Systems Inbays in your computer case. Although SCSI has come a long way, it's still harder to configure. With EIDE drives, you only have to worry about which drive is the master and which one the slave. With SCSI, you have up to seven IDs to set, as well as having to worry about terminating the SCSI chain. (Termination identifies the ends of the SCSI chain of peripherals.) You can add multiple SCSI controllers to a system, as long as you have free slots and IRQs. What about performance? SCSI 2 can handle 10 megabytes per second, while the more expensive wide SCSI variant can move data at 20 megabytes per second. SCSI is a better solution for multi-tasking, making it a more efficient solution for Windows 95. The newly emerging ultra SCSI standard can handle 40 megabytes per second. Note, though, that SCSI performance does come at a price premium. You usually need to add a SCSI host adapter to your system, and SCSI drives cost more than the same drive with an EIDE interface. Finally, the fastest SCSI hard disks and CD drives are typically faster than the fastest EIDE drives. ---Loyd Case SCSI Master PU Cadaptec Face tape drives, disk drives and even the oddball printer or two.

"TECHNOLOGY SECTION Head Games A Head-To-Head Comparison Of The Virtual 10 i-Glasses vs. Forte's VFX-1 by Loyd Case ou stick your head around the corner, then jerk it back as a tracer passes within inches of your face. You drop to a crouch and click the safety of the smartgun off. After a moment, you pop around the corner in a crouch, firing measured, three-round bursts into the packed horde of mutants. The crosshair in your targeting monocle snaps from target to target. You sense, rather than feel, hits from a couple of slugs, but your kevlar vest soaks up the impact. After several frantic moments, the last of the enemies goes down. You breathe a sigh of relief, safe the smartgun and reach up to remove your helmet. After blinking for a moment, reality sets in and you find yourself staring at the monitor. Sound too good to be true? Well, it is, but an experience such as the one described here is getting closer. Only a scant three years ago, a virtual reality (VR) helmet with very limited color depth and resolution cost thousands of dollars-and that didn't include the Silicon Graphics workstation. Now there are two competitors shipping VR gear for just under a thousand dollars that work on a home PC. That's still quite a pocketful of loose change, though. Are they worth it? This month, we'll take a look at the VFX-1 helmet from Forte Technologies and the i-Glasses from Virtual 10 (VIO). THE VIO I-GLASSES At first blush, the I-GLASSES appear to be industrial strength welding goggles. A closer look reveals some interesting details. The GLASSES don't stay on like normal glasses, despite the heftylooking earpieces.

Normally, this tively short length of the cables makes it too easy can cause some people to have problems focusTHE FORTE VFX-1 Given that Forte designed the Gravis ULTRASOUND audio card, we approached the VFX-1 headset with some trepidation. The ULTRASOUND's quirky behavior has frustrated more than a few game players. However, the Forte headset proved to be well-designed, although still suffering from a few flaws that are simply the result of pushing the technology envelope. The VFX-1 is a one-piece, injection-molded, black plastic helmet with a flip up Visor. It somehow manages to look incredibly cool and quite geeky at the same time. Unlike the i-GLASSES, the VFX-1 attaches to the computer with a single cable. The tradeoff is that it requires a free ISA slot for a custom interface card. Another compromise is the use of the VGA feature connector for driving the display, rather than a VGA pass-through like the Glasses. The feature connector is two rows of pins on a graphics card used to pass VGA information on to another device. Using the feature connector can be problematic, as various display cards implement the feature connector differently. Some cards even have the two rows of pins, but no circuitry to drive them! Needless to say, if the VFX-1 appeals to you, you should give Forte a call and check to make sure your card is supported. Our Matrox MILLENIUM seemed to work without any problems, but we did lose head tracking occasionally. HEADGEAR GUNU HOPPING THE BUS The VFX-1 interface card is an ACCESS.BUS card, meaning you can connect (daisy chain) multiple peripherals that support this emerging standard. In addition to the helmet, Forte supplies the Puck, a device resembling a hockey puck with three buttons. The puck plugs into an ACCESS.BUS connector on the helmet itself, and acts as a kind of 3-D mouse. The cable seems to be fairly long, but it's not long enough to stand up and spin around, and like the i-GLASSES, it's easy to get tan232 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD . DECEMBER 1995 "

"Day 5: I'm not sure Chapter 6 of Phantasmagoria 1859b0bb0_35905 PHANTA THE BEAST WITHIN GABRIEL KNIGHT: The top two computer gaming magazines both named the first Gabriel Knight mystery the best adventure game of the year in 1994. Creator Jane Jensen might want to start dusting off her awards shelf again, as The Beast Within mixes a strange, new brew of mutilation murders, a centuries-old curse, and criminal misdeeds on multiple CDs. Gabriel Knight, a detective of the supernatural, is summoned to Munich to investigate a series of murders blamed on werewolves. The edge-of-your-seat tale unfolds to implicate the mad King Ludwig II, a lost Wagner opera, and Gabriel's own dark past. Shrewd thinking and paying attention to details are rewarded as players unravel clues while taking on the role of Gabriel and his partner, Grace Nakimura. Shot on location in Germany and the U.S. with more than 40 surprisingly talented actors, The Beast Within is possibly the most visually stunning, realistic adventure game to come out on CD this year. Even the photo on the box is enough to induce a minor heart palpitation. HORROR PITANTASMAGORIA Unless you've spent the last couple of years spelunking in Zanzibar, you've already heard of Phantasmagoria. Now it's finally here with all the elements of a big hit: a master story teller in the person of Kings Quest creator Roberta Williams, feature film quality footage, and a story so rich and elaborate it took a record-setting seven CDs to contain it all. The tale of Don and Adrienne's bizarre discoveries about their newly-acquired mansion is told in realistic live video. No, you don't watch a movie and then click on a plot option. You run this show. But the thrill of Phantasmagoria isn't simply the technology, it's also the story. As Adrienne explores her new home, its dusty secrets begin to reveal themselves.

This is truly the kind of game you'll find yourself staying up all night to play. And, with its decidedly macabre storyline, the middle of the night may be Phantasmagoria's finest hour. When he headed the L.A.P.D., Chief Daryl F. Gates founded SWAT, the first Special Weapons And Tactics team. Now these highly trained forces are the elite of law enforcement, while Gates' Police Quest: SWAT stands as the elite in tactical simulation games. In this, the fifth installment of the successful PQ series, you join a SWAT team, take intensive training, and learn to handle advanced class 3 weaponry, like an MP5, Benelli tactical shotgun, M16 and LASH radio.

And now they've got their own computer game: Trophy Bass. There are three sides to Trophy Bass. You can choose tackle, pick your bait, read the water, set the weather conditions, and then finesse your casting technique on one of five virtual lakes. Option two is to play in Tournament Mode and try your luck against conditions and competitors dished out by the computer. Or you can get even more serious and watch the full motion video \"how-to\" section and pick up more than 100 nuggets of solid advice from America's top tournament bass fishermen. Now, obviously, the Jims of the world are going to love this game, because playing can bring you more success out on the water. But, surprisingly, you don't have to know what a lunker bucketmouth is to get a charge out of Trophy Bass. As Jim would say, \"It's a keeper.\" A city simulation? Hmmm, haven't I seen something like this before? Yes and no. Yes, you've seen amazingly-detailed 3D renderings before. And, yes, you've played sims that put you in the municipal driver's seat. But, no, you've never played anything quite like Caesar II. For starters, if you do a good job quelling riots, dowsing fires, recruiting soldiers and building great cities, you earn approval ratings that grant you the right to take on another province. Then it really heats up. Along with wearing your city planner hat, you get to don the general's helmet and fight off hordes of barbarians in battle sequences (check out the Carthaginians on armored elephants). With each additional province you control, the closer you get to the best hat of all: the emperor's snappy laurel wreath.

But, no. They put the pads back on, threw out the old playbook, and came back with Football Pro '96. It keeps all the things that earned its forefathers the Best Sports Simulation award three years running: Slavish attention to real NFL player and team stats, a play book with over 10,000 combinations of X's and O's, and league play over CompuServe. Ah, but that's the old stuff. For 1996, you can suit up as a player for an arcade game or appoint yourself coach for the football sim. What's more, 3D animations were created using films of actual players shot from dozens of angles simultaneously, so tailbacks juke, wide receivers sprint, and linemen grunt just like their reallifo counterparts.

"Day 27: It took 3 but I finally reached, Level Osogooogosco 3-D ULTRA PINBALL Not every 65b65dodo THE The pinball wizards at Sierra have just come up JINLAHI with a better idea on how to stick five vertical feet of pinball machine onto seven inches of computer screen. While most other pinball games show you the table as if it were shot pointing straight up, Sierra's 3-D Ultra Pinball slants the table so you can see the whole thing easily without scrolling. This bit of clevemess was then totally exploited with the most amazing spacescape graphics to appear this side of Alpha Centauri. Another innovation: 3-D Ultra Pinball uses advanced physics formulas to give you an uncannily accurate feel of a real table. Thanks to genius programming from some people who weren't sleeping during Physics class, lipper responsiveness, table bumping, ball rolling and ricochets look and react just like an authentic tavem machine. It even tilts like classic pinball. Damn! The game's three tables can be interconnected so you can keep going until the sun comes up. And action on all versions is super fast; an amazing feat especially for a Windows game. If there's one downside to this addictive game, it may be that the garbage isn't going to get taken out for a while, and the dog may have to start walking himself. Now that the THEXDEB Windows 95 frenzy is going full tilt, you may wonder, \"is there a game specifically designed for this amazingly cool new operating system that takes full advantage of its multi-threading capabilities?\" Or perhaps you'd like to know, \"is there a game so incredibly wicked that it will actually increase my supply of testosterone?\" The answer to both questions: Yes. And you're looking at it. Thexder flies, runs, jumps, morphs into a tank or plane, and blasts his way through five worlds, each with ten different levels of increasing hair-pulling difficulty. Your job in all this is to help Thexder work his way through mind-numbing mazes while steering clear of energy fields, sheer drop offs, and other assorted game-enders.

Actually, there are other enemies you can take on: the bad dudes you play against on your network or your modem. All this battling is supercharged courtesy of Windows 95. Along with the main horizontally-scrolling action window, there are five additional screens to keep you filled in on your position, available equipment, enemies and weapons. Due to that multi-threading business, THE LAST Last Dynasty isn't the best new game to come along in a while. It's more like two of the best. Start by parking yourself in its first-person, full-view, real-time combat simulator. The completely customizable cockpit, with continuous on-line help, locks on and destroys typical space fight games. The information overload as you plan an attack, while your radar and windshield fills with enemy ships, is truly stomach-churning. Then comes an even cooler part: You can grab a momentary breath during all this chaos by switching into strategy mode, where you can map out and execute your next attack from a mega-choice of battle strategies. Carrying the action game forward are spectacular interactive cinema clips, haunting original music, and enough mindracking tension to have you sweating an arsenal worth of bullets. While the action side of this equation beats most pure space arcade CDs at their own game, Last Dynasty shines again in the fully-rendered, high res scenes in the adventure portion of the game. This mind-puzzler takes place aboard a multi-level space station.

But the beauty of IN The Isr DEGREE is that, on top of the ordinary joys of its gameplay and its \"let justice prevail\" climax, it has a cynical sensibility it isn't afraid to display. While it seems obvious that Tobin is guilty, the chilling realization sets in during play that Sterling Granger would do all the same things even if Tobin turns out to be innocent.

If you also happen to be a game master (GM) who likes to play face-to-face DARK CHAMPIONS, but doesn't have a lot of time to create a viable game world, you'll be glad to know that Steven Long's HUDSON CITY BLUES module has come to the computer in the form of a colorful, relatively easy-to-use database. Goldtree Enterprises HUDSON CITY SECTOR 1 ($44.95-DOS only) offers a considerable amount of information at the GM's fingertips. It reconciles the scheduled activities of non-player characters (NPCs) and player characters (PCs) alike within the ficitional locale of Hudson City. So, you never have to roll a die in order to determine how many NPCs are in a bar or which NPC is working the counter at the local army surplus store. It's all available within a few keystrokes. As a GM who was constantly having to stop the flow of action in an evening's scenario to find that misplaced chart or character sheet, I really like having it all available on the computer. And scenario management is really this title's strength. We use HUDSON CITY SECTOR 1 for handling the environment for both CHAMPIONS (our heroes always function in the gray, with or without the sourcebook) and MERCENARIES, SPIES AND PRIVATE EYES (the decaying urban environment is perfect for film noir-style adventures).

I emerge from the timestream atop a Mayan pyramid, the burial place of a high priest. The natives are at the bottom, so I can't climb down. I go inside, reading all the inscriptions along the way. It seems there are nine gods I have to placate if I want to travel through the underworld. Do I want to? Well, I must have come here for a reason, and I won't find out what it is walking in circles on top of a pyramid. In the main chamber I find a pair of disks mounted on the wall (a calendar of some sort, apparently), and a bowl. Outside is a statue with its hands outstretched. I spin the calendar disks to a setting shown in one of the inscriptions, put the bowl in the statue's hands...and a hole opens under me!

Offer a weapon to placate this militant deity. Commander of war. I lay out on the altar the only instrument of war I've got with me. (At least the knight on the tower didn't die in vain.) The door opens, and foolishly I walk through. Three hundred years before I was born, they made movies about grys who liked to poke around in ancient temples right now, I wish it was one of them, not me, who had to deal with the skeletons, snakes, and spikes I'm looking at. At least the snakes here are statues, not real, and the skeletons are resting in peace (not to mention in pieces). By keeping my head, and using one or two of theirs, I make it through without getting skewered. The prize at the take end? off Another stone block. No idea what I am supposed to do with it, and nothing I put on the third altar gets me any further. So I'm stuck. But I do have an idea what I might do with that bracelet I found. A quick jump timewise takes me back to the Crusades, where I pick my way down to the forge again. There's a pan over the fire, and once the metal's melted there's a mold I can pour it into. It cools quickly; by the time I carry it back into the castle, my new key is ready to unlock the chest in the storage room. On my way down, I find the tapestry again and follow the instructions I read earlier to activate its hidden machinery. Now, when I get to the storage room, I not only can unlock the chest but climb through its false bottom to the treasure room underneath. I find gold coins in a pile—a good enough haul by itself. But I also find the king's sword, and that's what I'm really after, since close inspection tells me the diamond in its hilt is what's been tampered with in this era.

Indeed, though the graphics are completely different, the gameplay is essentially the same, with few differences. The ground game, revolutionary for the PC platform simply because there is one, allows you to actually find holes at the line of scrimmage and pop through them. The passing game remains one of the easiest-to-use and most enjoyable in the game. Drop back, hit a button to go into pass mode, select your receiver and drop the ball in.

Eventually, the Americans were forced to withdraw after dark. 3 G 5656 olf labuc 2013 BEACOD 26D22020 22012002201 122000120 VED This small engagement is an ideal battle to create using the STEEL PANTHERS' Scenario editor. It gives you the necessary tools to reconstruct battles, duplicate the deeds of your favorite World War II combat units or even set up your own hypothetical battles. first designed a map of Singling and the surrounding area, purchased the correct units for both sides and then manually deployed them on the map to reflect the tactical situation the opposing commanders faced. The Germans have two Panther platoons (eight tanks), an infantry company, two 75mm anti-tank guns, and two sections of Jagdpanzer IVS (four-tank destroyers) armed with 75mm L/48 guns. These particular German tank destroyers aren't available in the game's unit database, but by editing and renaming the Jagdpanzer IV-70, which is included, I created the historically correct units in a few minutes. F The American tank company comprises 12 Shermans armed with 75mm guns and five armed with 76mm guns. Supporting the Shermans is a platoon of four M-18 Hellcat tank destroyers, an infantry company, three machine guns sections and two artillery batteries. The U.S. tanks made liberal use of the superior HVAP anti-tank round, so the ammo loads were edited to reflect that fact Although the Americans have more armored vehicles and better artillery support, playing \"Slugfest at Singling\" from the German side should be relatively easy. Playing the Americans is a far greater challenge! If you can fight the Wehrmacht to a draw in this battle, you're doing well. Here's a hint: The Americans can't win without capturing the three victory hexes on the upper right side of the map.

Looking like an overtium chip. A Pentium is a hefty chip, surturned bathtub, the Y2 chip contains a prisingly heavy, and sporting 273 gold-plated pins. With an external data bus at 64-bits wide, Pentium can chomp on data and process instructions at blazing speeds. If you could chip open (no pun intended) the ceramic casing, you'd find over pentium three million microscopic transistors, some as small as .8 microns in width. The newest breed of Pentiums use 3.3 volts of power (as opposed to 5 volts for the earlier 60 MHz variety). The speed of a Pentium, stated in megahertz (such as a 133 MHz Pentium), refers to the clock cycle speed. The easiest way to think of the MHz rating is to think of it as your computer's heartbeat.

In today's motherboards, crystal oscillators have been replaced with solid state integrated circuits. The small Texas Instrument chip near the Y2 handles the clock speed of the CPU. The clock speed or speed is set by the blue jumpers on the board. When setting up the motherboard, you first need to specify the CPU's speed.

The original 8080 boards sported up to eight 8-bit card slots. With the advent of the 286, the AT was born, and so was the 16-bit ISA bus. When DX chips arrived, we finally had true 32-bit data memory access. With the new generation of Pentium boards, we have a 64-bit local bus in the PCI bus, and 64-bit RAM access, plus a whole host of other high speed goodies living peacefully together on a small plot of silicon and gold. Couple that with a processor which can calculate rings around the 286 and 386 systems of only a few years ago, and you have a gamer's dream system in hand. Next time you crack open your computer to upgrade your sound card, spend a few moments looking over your motherboard. You'd be surprised at just how much power and processing actually goes on in that most overlooked and underrated of PC components.
