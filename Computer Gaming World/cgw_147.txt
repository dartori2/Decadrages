"WHY IS DUKE NUKEM 3D THE BEST? Even running in super crisp 800x600 SVGA it blasts along faster than every other comparable 3D PC title. It's not pure speed at the expense of versatility either it is possible to look up, down, or sideways at any time, with the bitmapped scenery undergoing minimal deformation and no speed loss whatsoever. The engine also caters for full interaction, so bullets leave pock marks on walls, enemy's blood drips down crates and earthquakes cause huge sections to shift altogether, thereby granting access to new locations. It all contributes to the feeling of being encased within a grim world as opposed to wandering through impregnable, static corridors. The effect is hugely rewarding and is surely the direction in which such games should be heading, Computer Playe PC Entertainme \"A perfect 10!\" Out of 5 stars This potential has luckily been exploited too. So often games fail to capitalize on excellent technologies but each of Duke Nukem's levels are noticeably different, being packed with huge ramps, drops, lifts, jumps and cunningly hidden secret areas. None look the same (indeed there is often a significant variation within a single building) and there is always a feeling that there is a new trick round the next corner. -Edge Magazine \"In terms of graphics, gameplay and overall gas more strategy and variety than DOOM.

"JUST THE FAQS JUST THE FAQS from there to your hard drive. We strongly recommend that you back up any previously saved games before installing a patch, as this may overwrite your existing program. How Do I Get The CG-ROM? Newsstand issues come in two flavors: with and without the CD. Each type is clearly marked. If you can't find the version you want in the store you frequent, encourage your retailer to carry it (or subscribe to ensure that you get a CD every month). To subscribe, simply call (303) 665-8930, and specify that you want the CD-ROM version. Classics/Puzzles (CP): Classics are old stand-bys and parlor games that appeal to many dif: ferent types of gamer. Examples include: backgammon, bridge, chess, MONOPOLY, parchesi, Risk, and SOLITAIRE. Puzzle games are computer games which emphasize spatial relationships, word games and/or problem-solving without requiring gamers to follow a story. line. Examples would be: SHANGHAI, Tetris and Zig-ZAG. Role-Playing (RP): RPGs are a subset of adventure games, but stress character development, often through improving stats or other attributes. Conversations with non player characters (NPCs) and tactical combat are generally more important than in Adventure games. Finally, the game world tends to be large, and the plot less linear, often with some quests/treks outside the main storyline Simulations (SI): Highly realistic games from a first-person perspective: you may drive a real istically simulated race car, fly a military aircraft with a meticulous physics model, or swoop through a detailed sci-fi environment. Usually polygon-filled technology is used to build the simulated world on the fly. Sports (SP): The sports game category is a broad genre which includes action (NBA Live) and strategy games (FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO) based on sports. Strategy (ST): Problem-solving, short and long-range planning are the keys here. These games almost always emphasize resource and risk management. This genre includes conflict-based sci-fi and fantasy games (X-COM, OUTPOST, MOO), as well as \"pure\" strategy games and \"software toys\" such as SIMCITY. Wargames (WG): A subset of strategy games, these recreate historical conflicts from a command perspective. They may be tactical, operational, or strategic, and stress anything from logistics and firepower to morale and leadership. They may be simple (PANZER GENERAL, EMPIRE II) to incredibly detailed and complex (PACIFIC WAR). How Do We Classify Games? Action/Arcade (AC): The emphasis is on hand-eye coordina tion and reflexes, usually emphasiz. ing fast play over story or strategy. Adventure (AD): Games wherein you control an alter ego and move through a storyline or sequence of events, where puzzle. solving takes precedence over conversation and combat HOW DO WE RATE? *** What Is Your Reviews Policy? 1) We only review from the final copy of the game. Though it has become popular among PC gaming magazines to review from late beta copies, we feel that the reader is best served by having the reviewer look at the same copy of a game that the readers will find on the shelves. While we recognize that this causes some delay in Coverage, we believe the reader is bet ter served by such caution. 2) We expect our reviewers to finish the game. We want our readers to be assured that we do not review based on immediate or early impressions of a game. Our reviewers give a game ample opportunity to show its quality. In some cases, bugs make it impossible to finish a game, but we identify situations where that has occurred. 3) We make every effort to match Outstanding: Very Good: A The rare game high-quality game that gets it all that succeeds in right.

"JOHNNY WILSON edito in The Emperor's New Code on i Hope And Hype On The Internet he danger in magazine journalism is that it's easy to become obsessed with the hype that potentially sells magazines and drives advertising pages instead of remaining focused on the needs of your readers. In the world of com puter journalism, this is particu larly difficult. Journalists who fail to perceive the magic in the latest round of technological \"advance. ments\" are quickly labeled Luddites and has beens. In a business where the product cycle keeps getting shorter and shorter, it's dangerous to ask philosophical questions like \"Why?\" and prag. matic questions like \"What is it good for?\" Take CD-ROM, for instance. was an early advocate of the med ium. After watching game boxes swell and 3.5-inch floppy disks pro. liferate in those same boxes even after their data was compressed to the max, I championed this storage medium ont he basis that it would: save publishers money (sometimes several dollars per package in cost of goods, permit longer and better soundtracks, reduce software piracy, provide space for increased use of video, ease installation, reduce the size of software packages to save both natural resources and shelf space, and, hopefully, provide savings for consumers in the long run. So much for prophecy. If customers have saved money, it's only in that prices have not increased at the rate of inflation. CD-ROMs haven't reduced box sizes or increased the amount of available shelf space. Publishers have spent any savings they might have gained on cost of goods with increased budgets and new technology that is now threate ning the previous reductions in software piracy. We could establish similar report cards for our hopes in construction kits (the availability of editors has not really facilitated the onset of incredible creativity among gamers with its corollary free exchange of new games and scenarios over the Internet), connectivity (see Martin Cirulis's \"What's The Deal?\" in this issue), or Windows 95 (why doesn't Direct Play support play by null modem? why do you need the con. figuration trick covered in Loyd Case's column?). They were all sup. posed to make things better for us. If we were reviewing these trends and technologies on the CGW scale, we'd have to give them three stars. They may have reached high, but they didn't reach their potential. ( If the gaming experience isn't good, Internet gaming could die out faster than the Hula | Hoop. 72 something about \"multimedia.\" Yes, I know multimedia was supposed to bring in entire new waves of gamers, but it bogged down in software that was as interesting as playing SIMCESSPOOL or EL-DUST BUNNY. We called it \"multime. diocre\" and \"interinactive\" software, because it didn't really do anything. So do you think the poor suckers who purchase or \"rent to buy\" those $500 Internet boxes or those televisions with built-in Web browsers are going to be any hap. pier with the first-generation games that their substandard processors are going to allow them to play? They might be able to play Concentration and Tic Tac Toe with their fellow subscribers to cable television or telephone-based Internet providers. They might, and this is by no means certain, be able to get a keyboard so that they could play some of the Play.By. Electronic-Mail games described in the latter part of this month's fea. ture, but they're certain not going to be able to play full 3D texturemapped versions of NASCAR RACING II, any multiplayer equiva. lents to THE ELDER SCROLLS: NET RESULTS With regard to gaming on the Internet, let me simply say that the emperor has new code. Can't you see it? Internet gaming will create global community. Don't pay any attention to the little boy in the crowd asking how wasting each other in deathmatches is going to lead to global understanding. Don't pay any attention to the little girl who's saying that building commu. nity requires communication and interaction that's more complex than running, spinning, ducking and pulling a trigger. Yet, with language barriers, limits to sound over data technology, bandwidth issues and lowest common denominator design, what can we expect. The emperor's new code flour ishes a wonderful promise of new gamers. Notice the color depth, the wide palette of choices. Ignore the rabble who keep muttering CG OCTOBER 1996 "

Wright DAGGERFALL that might become available, real-time FRONT PAGE SPORTS: PRO FOOTBALL, or next year's successor to QUAKE. The new gamers are going to feel robbed. Of course, my wise readers can smirk and claim that it doesn't really matter to them. They can point to their hot rod machines and state-of-the-art connections to the Internet and say that it doesn't affect them. The trouble is that it does. It will affect them because many big publishers and service providers are going to open up gaming services with flat-rate pric. ing. The game hogs, reduced from paying hundreds of dollars per month for their virtual lives on tra ditional online services, will suddenly be able to stay online all the time for under a hundred dollars per month, and possibly under fifty dollars. Their increased efficiency at the games will enable them to run rough-shod over new players and rule their favorite games with an iron fist. They'll make life miser able for new players, and they'll clog up the pipe so that it's hard to stay connected, much less get an efficient frame rate. If the gaming experience isn't good, Internet gaming could die out faster than the Hula Hoop fad in the '50s. My wise readers should also pay attention to the idea of the Internet as a publishing platform. It is becoming so, for better or worse, because of two factors: investment dollars and profit potential. Inves tors and vulture capitalists alike want to reach those millions of potential customers who are not yel gamers. The Internet represents a new chance to reach them. Pub. lishers and new startups will focus disproportionate energy on Internet games compared to what they will spend on improving their core products. This means that my wise readers just might find themselves and their hot rod machines in the same computer morgue as the Apple II, the C-64, the TRS-80, the Atari ST, the Amiga, and probably before you know it--the Macintosh. Just as the computers in this '80s. era morgue were superceded by the IBM platform in spite of their superior sound, graphics, resolution, 3D handling and speed, the bandwidth-challenged Internet just might take us all back to square one What can you do to keep from being reduced to lowest-commondenominator games? First, do your research. Find out what games you like (or could potentially like with a few changes) and reward the providers of those games with your business. Then, start communicating with the developers and the services, if applicable, that carry those games. Ask for changes to improve the games and become a missionary in recruiting new gamers into those games. Second, pay attention to the companies in your area that are investing in the Internet. If you have a progressive cable television company like TCI or Viacom, urge them not to make the same mistake they made with the Sega Channel. Write them about good online games and explain what interactivity is all about. Third, always register your packaged software and fill out the questionnaires-even if you've purchased software from that publisher before. They may not send you anything in return, but they tabulate those questionnaires and heed those demographics as they plan for future products. This way, you force publishers to stay up to date with you. Finally, answer mag. azine and publisher surveys about computer games. Honest answers may pave the way for product decisions you'll appreciate. If you follow these steps, you could keep us all from being offended by the emperor's new code.

"READ.ME PILOT ALERT FALCON 4.0 On Track For 1997 Takeoff FALCON 4.0's campaign system was designed from the ground up to support multiplayer play, to the extreme that solo play is actually treated as a network game with only one player. Along with campaign play, there are also two pectrum HoloByte first showed early work on FALCON 4.0 way back in the Fall of 1994. With little news on the project-other than reports of turnovers in the development team in the ensuing years, many sim fans had written the program off, figuring it would never ship. Spectrum recently invited us to its offices to take a look at the latest version, slated to ship in the first half of 1997 under the MicroProse label. Unlike that first look two years ago, this time major por: tions of the game are up and running. Spending about an hour flying the Alpha version on a system equipped with the 3Dfx Voodoo 3D accelerator definitely gave me the impres sion that this game will be worth the wait. No other sim has captured the feel of moving over real terrain at high speed this well-the 16-bit color graphics were spectacular. Set in Korea, the sim uses satellite data to accurately model the jagged terrain. But the FALCON series isn't about looks, it's about hard core accurate simulation. FALCON 4.0 is set to deliver that in spades, modeling a huge chunk of the real systems of an F-16C Block 52. These include the APG-68 radar (including the modes omitted in BACK TO BAGHDAD). HARM targeting, laser designation, and probably LAN TIRN systems.

This is now easily the best action-oriented baseball game on the market. Great graphics, motion-captured movements (except for the oddly swishy way that batters walk to the plate) and sound effects, along with an interface designed for maximum ease, combine to make this a game entertaining and accessi ble enough to appeal to even casual sports fans. Serious base ball gamers can find a lot to rip this game for-such as a strike zone the size of Montana-but why fight it? With built-in GrIP support for up to six players, this is the one baseball game on the PC that you can actually play with friends without having to con stantly apologize for the way the game looks and feels.

Intel's new P55C Pentium chip, originally slated for release before the holidays, has been delayed until the first quarter of 1997. This updated Pentium chip includes the MMX instruction set, which will allow developers to significantly speed up applications such as real-time audio manipula. tion and high-speed display of 24-bit color graphics. Because the MMX enhancements require specific support in programs, the more significant initial speedup will likely come from the P55C's double-size 32K internal Level 1 cache. A better solution for power-hungry gamers may come from Intel's updated Pentium Pro chip, code.named Klamath, set to ship around the same time as the P55C. This redesigned chip also sports the MMX instruction set, but does away with the original Pentium Pro's huge internal 256K cache in order to dramatically reduce size and cost. Performance should still be significantly better than a Pentium running at the same clock speed, thanks in part to the Pro's dramatically faster floating point capabilities, and especially if the rumored improved support for running 16-bit applications pans out.

"ONLINE GAMES Lock, Load, and Log On CGW's Guide To The Best In Online Gaming t's the most hyped new gaming trend since full-motion video, but this time there's some substance to back up the talk. The Internet and the new crop of online gaming services have the potential to change the face of gaming. Once you've gone into a virtual battle--whether it's fought in a martial-arts ring, over 3D Pacific skies, or on a hex-based representation of the Eastern Front-it's hard to go back to facing simple, often predictable computer players. However, online gaming is an industry in its infancy, so don't fear that you'll always need to track down a live opponent on the Net any time you want to play a game--that's not going to happen anytime soon. There are plenty of technological and economic bumps ahead on the road, and some of the players in the race for your online dollar may crash and burn. To help guide you safely into the world of online games, we enlisted Net curmudgeon Martin Cirulis to take a look at the players, major and minor, in the nascent Net gaming world. If you're trying to figure out which service to try, give his overview a look. Of course, the real decision boils down to where you'll find the games you want to play. Our crack editorial team spent dozens of hours combing the networks, pilfering software company game plans, and playing as many online games as we could get our hands on, to present you with a list of the best online games, and where to find them. And if you're not on the Net yet, we've also put together a list of the best tools for getting connected. So read on, grab your controller, log on, and prepare to meet the most vicious, unpredictable opponents in the universe-other gamers.

"ONLINE GAMES. GAMING NETWORKS Online Gaming Comes Of Age New Services Compete For Your Gaming Time-And Your Gaming Dime BY MARTIN E. CIRULIS fter years of limping along in the game areas of major online services like Genie and CompuServe, along with the odd false start such The Sierra Network (a good idea long before the technology was robust enough to do it justice), it seems that the age of viable online gaming ser vices is here. At least, that's what a whole lot of people who are investing a whole lot of money into the Internet are hoping. Just a couple of years ago, a dedicated gaming site was considered the best way to lose your shirt next to body surfing in a hurricane. But in the last few months, several contenders for your gaming money (and more importantly, your loyalty) have sprung up out of the woodwork. Once they're all online, you can expect the hype-explosion to be truly overwhelming. One of the first online gaming services, DWANGO (www.dwango .com), has been making its way on the Internet for some time now, and it's surviving nicely. Unfortunately, it is not the most user-friendly setup in the world, and some of the new, big-money servers may leave it looking like a garage band: eclectic and cool, but probably not opening for The Who anytime soon. Full-scale, serious Net gam. ing is going to require the ease and accessibility that these new companies are promising. In order to help you sort through the hype and make the best of the new online gaming experiences soon to be available, CGW has collected background information on the early contenders and passed it all under the jaundiced eye of this grumpy old gamer. It's still too early to foretell the future with perfect accuracy, but here's a look at the players, what they have to offer, and my calls (based on the information at hand) on how likely it is that they'll be able to deliver on their promises. provide a direct number or whether you are going to need another subscription on top of that to get going. There's a potential problem with connecting to a gaming service through the Internet: While the service may brag about how fast their server is and claim that you'll suffer no hiccups or latency delays while playing (something that is merely annoying in a strategy game, but fatal in the middle of a sim), if the ISP you subscribe to gets overloaded easily during your prime gaming hours, you're out of luck. The other major difference with these new services is the sheer number of quality games offered. In the old days, online gaming usually meant one or two good games (to its credit, Genie manages to have four or five), and a lot of mainstream fluff like Hangman and Backgammon taking up the slack. Not only will the numbers of \"real\" games be far greater on these new services, but most of them will be versions of games you have already bought for home use. In fact, the great race among all these startup companies is to secure exclusive rights to the hottest new games in the pipeline. You'll make your choice of service the same way you choose a movie Ten PLAYER GETTING WIRED There are two major differences between these new game services and the older generation. The first is the method of connection. All the new services can be accessed through the Internet; some will also provide direct dial-up access. Services that are only accessible through the net require that you have an account with your own Internet service provider (ISP). You should know whether the money you pay to the game service will ENGAGE MPG-NE AMERICA OCTOBER 1996 "

WELCOME MAT With its point-and-click front-end program, TEN endeavors to make the online gaming experience accessible to newbies and Netheads alike. THE BIG THREE My picks as the best bets in this new battlefield are all services dedicated to gaming and entertainment. More importantly, though, TEN, Mpath and Engage all have deep and extensive experience in real computer gaming--they aren't simply led by a group of suits who have read the top 10 best-selling software list and think \"Myst ONLINE\" will be the hottest thing since sliced bread. When it comes down to it, I'm far more comfortable supporting people who know and love our hobby, rather than those who are just leaping in to make a quick buck, and the odds of getting what you paid for are much higher when you're dealing with people who know what the heck computer gaming is about Total Entertainment Network (TEN): At the moment this is the company to beat in the world of online gaming. TEN (www.ten.net) has been at work preparing for Web gaming since early 1993, and it seems to have the most solid grip on the situation for its planned grand opening on September 1. Unfortunately for the company's cor. porate future, most of its competitors have timed their own openings to roughly coincide with TEN's debut, so any advantage will soon be lost unless the additional year and a half that TEN has spent prepar ing for launch is evident to consumers. This service represents the closest hybrid between past and pres ent. Though it's an Internet-based entity, TEN will retain the direct dialup capability and full service of the old generation of online providers. For the technical reasons mentioned above, direct-dial-up access from major North American cities will be a great advantage for gamers who are willing to pay the extra amount. With this deal you also get full Internet access as well as unlimited play time, so in the long run it may be the cheaper option. And speaking of costs, I suspect this factor more than anything else will separate the gamers from the kids on TEN. With an unlimited play rate of $30 per month ($50 with direct access and full Internet capabil ities), a year's worth of all the gaming CU O you can stand will FRAGGED! An opponent meets his end in an be a little steep for online \"Duke-match.\" If your Net connection the average allowisn't speedy, Jerky movement can add a whole ance. Fortunately new challenge to action play-a problem all for the budget con the services are working to minimize. scious, there is an hourly/monthly rate as well: a base charge of $7.50/month, which is applied against a $1.25/hour fee. So basically, your monthly fee gives you six hours, and then you pay extra for any more time you spenda good deal if you're planning to spend less than 24 a month on the game grid. The teenage action set may not feel completely at home here, however. Although there will be a nice selection of shoot-'em-ups--this will be the exclusive home to Duke Nukem and all the FormGen/3D Realms titles for quite a while-TEN also seem to have a firm commitment to in-depth strategy games. It will feature PANZER GENERAL, DEADLOCK, DEADLY GAMES, COMMAND & CONQUER and WARCRAFT in its ini. tial offering of 10-odd games, while SIM CITY 2000 and MASTER OF ORION 2 also wait in the wings. While they appear to be a little light in the RPG category, with only the SSI leather-fest DARK Sun in the corral at the moment, that's probably going to change as the months pass. The plan for most titles offered by TEN is to have an icon available that will connect you directly to the network for online play whenever you install an off-the-shelf game under Win 95. Provided you have a TEN account, just double-click the icon and you'll find yourself in a virtual lounge with all sorts of compadres, and you can immediately start looking for opponents. It doesn't get much easier. By the time you read this, TEN will be available and striving hard to flourish as a pay service, offering a complete entertainment package: not only games, but all the support, strategy and newsgroups needed by the serious gamer. TEN represents an attempt to evolve the reliable infrastructure of the old online services into a more dynamic, gameroriented service, which serves the hobby at the same time it profits from it. Mplayer: If there's a prime contender for TEN's initial lead, it's Mpath Interactive and its online gaming service, Mplayer (www .mplayer.com). Initially, Mplayer seems to be narrower in scope than TEN, choosing to concentrate on optimizing player interaction and speed. While I'm not sure how this is going to enhance strategy titles, it will certainly help to make them paramount in the hearts of action fans. CG OCTOBER 1996 "

"ONLINE GAMES ADVENTURE/RPG MUDs In Your Eye INV2 LCHA ole playing over the Internet has been alive and well for years in the form of hundreds of text-based games called MUDs, (multiuser dungeons), each a self-contained world with its own culture, customs and social structures. MUDs can be so complex and involving that they've been known to completely swallow gamers! lives (which, of course, we would never condone here), and there are so many to choose from now that they're likely to still be around long after everything else in this section has come and gone, and possibly up until cockroaches (or apes) take over the planet. This is essentially a long winded way of saying that, if you're interested, you're going to need to check them out yourself, since we couldn't possibly cover them all here, even if we weren't so long winded. But we can at least point you in the right direction. Possibly the best source for MUD listings is Lydia Leong's Web site (www.cis.upenn.edu/nlwl/mudinfo.html), from which you can access her huge MUD Resource Collection (a list of of links to MUD sites) and MUD Home Page Links, which features a huge list of MUDs classified by genre. You might also want to check out the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.mud for late-breaking MUD announcements. DEM BONES One of the season's hottest games, DIABLO, will be even hotter online, where multiple players can dismember skeletons together in the name of global interaction. CONECT The plot involves the misadventures of an elite military tactical team after they become \"genetically enhanced\" (we don't dare guess how) following a mysterious mission. This story will begin life as a comic book released in December, with a new issue to follow every six weeks. The online game will pick up where the story leaves off, with users able to inhabit the identities of their favorite characters and play out the action from the book. As new characters, weapons and scenarios are added to the comic book, GTE will add these elements to the game. Sounds odd, to be sure, but from oddness, Frodo, great things often come. At press time, new online RPGs seemed to be cropping up faster than we could type them up. We'll keep you apprised of the latest and greatest developments in upcoming issues. In a similar vein is Viacom New Media's ARCHMAGE: WAR OF THE Wizards, a Windows 95 title being developed by Simutronics, the com. pany behind the immensely popular text-based RPG, GEMSTONE III. ARCHMAGE, which is scheduled to be available on commercial online services by year's end, will pit two teams of wizards (up to 16 players total) against each other in a battle over crystal spheres. Wizards can collect up to 50 spells, and can gain experience over time to collect enough power to become an archmage. Again, the action slant might make this a game that will appeal more to fantasy action fans than tra ditional role players. (Simutronics, by the way, has also recently released a brand-new text-based RPG called DRAGON REALMS, now available on AOL.) A third action-oriented RPG, and perhaps the most intriguing of the lot-especially for comic book fans-is Siege, a joint venture from GTE Entertainment and WildStorm Productions (home of artist Jim Lee and creators of the Wildcats and Gen 13 comic books, among others).

At least, not yet. There is still the issue of latency over the Internet, which could cut the frame rates of games that usually run at a minimum 20 frames per second in half. Still, there is a huge demand for action games online, as evinced by the thousands of gamers who daily brave horrid latency delays and expensive phone bills to play QUAKE and DUKE NUKEM 3D over the Internet.

"ACTION ONLINE GAMES Spacewar! Grows Up Javelin Warbird ometimes it's the simple things that grab you. SUBSPACE, for instance, doesn't have stunning graphics or a complicated set of missions, but it's pretty addicting anyway. Players log on, choose a name, select one of four ships, decide which arena is seeing the most action, and jump right into the fray. Upon entering a zone, the player is assigned to a squadron. You fly around, pick ing up powerups and blasting away at anyone except teammates (or at them too, if you want to be unpopular). Players get points for kills based on their opponents' bounty. Because a new player's bounty is small, more advanced players will tend to leave him alone until his skill--and kill value-increases. After racking up a certain number of points, players are invited to enter the elite zones. SUBSPACE is very easy to learn, but provides enough depth to keep things interesting. The variety of ships and weapons, and the clever touches like being able to piggyback with a squadmate, let more strategy-minded pilots rack up points right along with the top guns. Chat mode lets a player broadcast messages to the entire zone, or chat privately with his squadron or an individual. Spirited trash-talkers may also program their taunts as macros. Many players have formed tournament leagues, complete with elaborate Web sites. With emphasis on the functional rather than the flashy, SUBSPACE's latency was quite good in the beta version we played. Even at modem speeds under 14.4 Kbps, ship han dling was excellent, and even though opponents sometimes jumped around, they could still be targeted fairly easily. Though the graphics were still being revised at press time, the tradeoff in speedy gameplay will be negligible. SUBSPACE IS available only on the Windows 95 platform, and requires an Internet connection.

"ONLINE GAMES CLASSICS & PUZZLES The Online Classics Classic Board Games Make for Social Online Play BY TERRY COLEMAN SECONOSTO IMPACT YOU SUNK MY BATTLESHIP! Those hankering for yesteryear can have their nostalgia and blow it up-in real time-playing BATTLESHIP on the Internet. from Castle Risk! thrown in) support modem and Internet play, but if world domination's your game, you'd better upgrade, because Risk! is Windows 95-only. here really aren't any great puzzle games scheduled for the Internet anytime in the foreseeable future (we're still waiting for FULLCONTACT VR TETRIS). Computer versions of old board-game classics, however, have become the Next Big Thing. Old Mr. Pennybags holds the Internet MONOPOLY, where you can play opponents the world 'round, converting German marks to British pounds, rubles to dollars, and so forth. There's even a dedicated Web site where you can meet fellow Boardwalk tycoons. Far from resting on its laurels, Hasbro Interactive has an ambitious publishing schedule for the next year. Not every game will feature Internet play-you won't be able to engage in world-wide manhunts for Colonel Mustard and the candlestick in Cwe. BATTLESHIP, though, is a big surprise, transformed from a childhood favorite to a fast: paced real-time environment. Fleets maneuver over the ocean grid, rather than being frozen in place, and the tame \"B-6, hit!\" has been replaced by cruise missiles, aircraft, even stealthy submarines, all of which gleefully target enemy vessels. All this increased activity shouldn't cause much of a latency problem, given the small fleets engaged on the game \"board.\" Best of all, the chat feature lets you hear \"You sunk my battleship!\" from opponents fighting in any of the vast oceans of the Net. And while this certainly won't challenge DUCK! Playing Risk! over the Net, up to six players QUAKE from a per game can vie for control of the Napoleonictechnological styled elevated landscapes standpoint, it looks to provide plenty of the same sort of mindless fun. Even if BATTLESHIP is a surprise hit, the most eagerly awaited classic game has to be Risk! The animation we've seen is, if anything, better than that MONOPOLY's, with sabre-rattling cavalry charges and booming cannon fire accompanying each attack. The territories, from Yakutsk to North Africa, are still a geography teacher's nightmare, but they make it to your monitor unchanged by the ravages of time. There are even cards to \"flip\" and dice to \"roll,\" for the purist. Hasbro insists that their bevy of Risk! experts are putting the Al through its paces, hopefully avoiding the tepid opponents of computers past. Both the original French and modern American versions (with some extra rules MAKE YOUR MOVE Chess might be the easiest of all games to play over the Internet.

"SIMULATION/SPACE ONLINE GAMES Aces Over The Internet Cyberspace Provides A Deadly Battlefield for Sim Drivers BY DENNY ATKIN o you think you're an ace pilot, kid? Well, Junior, when you enlist in the ranks of online simulation squadrons, be prepared to be humbled. No com. puter-flown craft can match the cunning and unpredictability of 1031035 HC even a mediocre human pilot. If you real. ly want to test your mettle, log on to one of the services described below before you grab your joystick. If you can emerge unscathed from these battles, then you'll have bragging rights. WARBIRDS is a more graphically impressive game that has evolved quite a bit since our initial look at it in these pages. The latest version features aircraft carriers and a number of new aircraft. ICI has been running periodic campaigns, complete with custom terrain. The recent Solomon Islands cam. paign will be followed by a Russian Front scenario, which should feature some new planes as well. When there's no scenario in play. these sims are more or less organized anarchy. The game is always going on, and players can jump in, choose a country, and start going after enemy planes. But a better bet is to join one of the many squadrons players have formed, where you'll get the chance to fly with other players on organized missions. If you're looking for a simpler flying experience, Air ATTACK from VR-1 Entertainment promises a more arcadelike flying experience (the game has yet to go online, however). There's also a multiplayer version of the original RED BARON ON INN (the service was recently pur. chased by AOL), but the communications delays make the game so jumpy that we can't recommend it. LIGHTNING STRIKE The P-38s in VR-1's AiR ATTACK should be significantly easier to fly than those in more sophisticated sims. PROP WASH While historical simulations, especially World War Il sims, have been all but ignored by com. mercial sim producers in recent years, they're thriving online. Kesmai's classic Air WARRIOR has faced a challenge from upstart ICI's WARBIRDS, and now CONFIRMED KILL from Eidos looks likely to give them both a run for your money, These sims are all targeted at the fairly hard-core sim pilot. They model a wide variety of aircraft with a level of realism that will challenge even experienced sim pilots-the only WWII simulation you'll find on store shelves that can match the flight models is FIGHTER DUEL. Add a dedicated group of experienced fliers who form their own vir tual squadrons and fly regularly, and you have a combat arena far more vicious and challenging than you'll find in any boxed simulation. WARBIRDS and AIR WARRIOR both feature simplified areas geared toward beginners, but they're rarely in use. The upcoming CONFIRMED Kill will have a unique method of matching up players, see sidebar for details. AIR WARRIOR has evolved quite a bit over the years--the newest version playable on AOL and CompuServe runs under Windowsbut it sports a graphic look that has changed little over the years. The action takes place in a window surrounded by a wraparound instrument panel, and while the aircraft interiors are superb, the relatively flat terrain still uses pyramids to represent mountains. This should change soon, with the release of Interactive Magic's boxed version of the game (playable both online and as a stand-alone sim), which will sport Kesmai's revamped graphic engine. BOX SEATS As the new Internet game services ramp up for launch, a number of sim producers have announced online playable versions of their flight sims. FIGHTER DUEL will be playable on Engage, FALCON 4 on TEN, and RED BARON II on INN. How successful these will be probably will depend on how much effort is put into tailoring the games for online play and how well the games deal with the latency inherent in online play. A good sign that the games will be playable is the success many sim players have had using Kali (see Loyd Case's column in the September issue for details on Kali) to play IPX network-capable games over the Internet. EF2000 is a current popular play on Kali servers, as is Top Gun, and Jane's has recently patched ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS to make it more Kali compatible. The free NET DUEL patch for FIGHTER DUEL allows nine player battles over Kali connections. OCTOBER 1996 CG "


"ONLINE GAMES Any network.capable flight sim has the potential to work over Kali, but Success actually depends on the size of the packets the sim sends to the game server and how much latency the sim can handle. LOGGING TIME Of course, there's much more for the sim fan to play online. Sierra will soon launch NASCAR RACING LEAGUE, based on NASCAR RACING 2. Look for many new sim releases to have online support from the start (designers from groups like Jane's Combat Simulations keep getting silly, knowing grins on their faces when we ask about online play in future products). As more sim players are exposed to online, multiplayer play, who knows-we may eventually describe computer-flown Al vehicles as \"those easy bogies we used to practice on.\" Confimed Kill Flies Again SPACED OUT You're not just limited to aircraft sims when you log on-they do call it cyberspace, you know. At press time, BATTLETECH: SOLARIS was available for play on GEnie, and for a free beta period on Kesmai's Web site; look for it to appear eventually on AOL. Set in the same BattleTech universe, this game mimics MECHWARRIOR 2 by dropping you into the cock pit of a giant robot Although the game engine isn't as tuned as MW 2's, the variety of arenas and objec tives available makes it worth checking out for action sim fans. SHATTER DAY An unlucky Mech meets its doom in BATTLETECH: SOLARIS. Although SOLARIS concentrates almost completely on action, the upcoming MULTIPLAYER BATTLETECH: 3025 will also feature a role-playing shell that will allow you to join a classic Battle Tech house and enter a strategic military campaign. Of course, MECHWARRIOR 2 itself is playable online on Mplayer, and some gamers have successfully played over the Internet using Kali. Interplay's upcoming SHATTERED STEEL, another fast action giant robot game, will be featured on Engage. But the most exciting news is Activision's inclusion of in-the-box Internet play support-no commercial gaming service required-in the upcoming MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES. You'll be able to connect directly to a multiplayer game using TCP/IP, and a separate server program will be included as well. With no dollar-clock ticking in the back ground, MERCENARIES has the potential to rival Quake in time spent play ing online. It's not all giant robots, either. ICI is following WARBIRDS with PLANETARY RAIDERS, which MERC-Y KILLING MECHWARRIOR 2: MERCENARIES will feature both will support direct play over the Internet space combat and trade. Kesmai is taking interactive Magic's underrated STAR RANGERS online, where the sim should truly shine. And while we haven't ferreted out any concrete plans yet, you know it's just a matter of time before WING COMMANDER ONLINE is launched. hen Domark's agreement with ICI to produce CONFIRMED KILL (CK) fell apart and the game went on to become WARBIRDS, the company (now renamed Eidos) didn't throw in the towel. Instead they went back to the drawing board to create their own version of CK. Like its competitors, the game will feature a host of ultrarealis tic WWII aircraft, including the P-51D, P-47D-40, P-38J-25, Spitfire Mk. V. Il-10, F4F3, Ju-87G-2, and others. Look for nextgeneration graphics and possibly real-time voice support. CK has the potential to really shine with its innovative approach to the combat arena. Instead of portraying a single, constant battlefield where all the players fly, CK drops you into a lobby where players will be sortable by name, squadron, skill level, connection speed, call sign, and rating. There you'll see a list of CONFIRMED KILL missions you can tly. Players can create missions by adjusting a wide variety of settings, including flight model (easy, intermediate and realistic) damage model, gunnery, fuel consumption. weapons loads, starting location and winning conditions. With this ability to customize mission complexity, CK should be a more friendly environment for beginners. In addition, scor ing will prioritize sportsmanlike play, so with luck you'll see fewer jerks trying for dive-and-run kills. You'll also be rewarded for sticking by your wingman in a tight. CK will premier on TEN this fall. For more information, check out www.domark.com CG OCTOBER 1996 "

"ONLINE GAMES STRATEGY/WARGAMES Marching Over The Internet When Artificial Intelligence' Isn't, Human Opponents Await Online BY ELLIOTT CHIN AND TERRY COLEMAN he most oft-repeated complaint of strategy and wargamers is that the Al just isn't good enough. Even games like PANZER GENERAL, COMMAND & CONQUER and CLOSE COMBAT can't offer the unpredictability and intelligence of a human opponent. That's why so many strategy. games have multiplayer options that include Internet play. Of course, some developers aren't convinced that multiplayer gaming has arrived (as Civ II fans are painfully aware), but as long as the Al fails to live up to human intelligence, there will be much better opponents online. THE FINAL FRONTIER The long-awaited MASTER OF ORION 2 (M002) is scheduled for release this holiday season. This follow-up to MicroProse's MASTER OF ORION is an expansive space-exploration game that can only be described as \"CIVILIZATION in space.\" Unlike the original, it will support up to eight players in multiplayer matches, with options for quick start or lengthy 090 ODDD000 10 campaigns. The game will be playable online only through TEN. Another strategy game in space is Accolade's DEADLOCK, M002 Multiplayer options will send this game from which puts merely great to stellar you in com mand of one of six alien races vying for control of a single planet's resources. Previewed in our May issue, DEADLOCK has all the makings of an engrossing sci-fi world-building game of conquest and diplomacy. You'll be able to play it over TEN and Mplayer. Another strategy game in space can't be found in store shelves. You'll have to point your web browser to www.webmap.com/stars to play STARS!, a turn-based space strate gy game by Star Crossed Software. This title has a similar theme to M002, in that you must build up a huge galactic empire, interact with several other alien species and wage war against them in conquest or defense. Because Star Crossed Software continues to update the game, the controls and gameplay only get better with each new version. The real-time baltle for space, STARCRAFT, is not a sequel, but the fact that it draws on WARCRAFT II's heritage of excellent multiplayer gaming means many are waiting for the game with bated breath. Blizzard has since dropped the entire \"Orcs in space\" feel and gone for a more 3D, high-tech look. The game is still realtime, but there will be EURO a major improvement in gameplay, with open space battles, STARCRAFT This isn't a copy of WARCRAFT II space station battles in space, but a richer game, with three and inner ship battles. races, distinct abilities and refined gameplay. There will also be three distinct races to play with different abilities and weaknesses. The multiplayer features of WARCRAFT II, such as the spawning technology, large maps and up-to-eight-person play, will still be present. But even better, STARCRAFT will be playable online over Blizzard's new free online gaming service, battle.net. As described in last month's Network Gaming feature, it will allow anyone with an ISP and the game to con nect to battle.net for real-time wargaming, at no additional charge beyond your ISP fees. STARCRAFT should be available by Christmas, and battle.net will be up in late September when Blizzard's RPG DIABLO ships. REAL-TIME WARS Speaking of Blizzard, fans of WARCRAFT II will finally be able to play this incredible real-time game over the Internet, without the use of Kali. Interplay has signed an agreement with Blizzard for the exclusive right to offer WARCRAFT II for play over their new online gaming ser. vice, Engage. DWANGO, though, at least until some legal action is taken by Engage, is also offering WARCRAFT II for play with its service.

"ONLINE GAMES STRATEGY/WARGAMES playable online, through TEN, Mplayer and DWANGO. Another entrant into the real-time fray is SSI'S WARWIND, which should arrive in stores in the next few weeks. This real-time game boasts four unique races, a more consistent campaign that allows you to bring troops along to different scenarios, and a theme that combines magic and technology. WARWIND will be available for play over Mplayer in October The other real-time player, is of course, COMMAND & CONQUER, which will be playable over Mplayer. However, COMMAND & CONQUER FOR WINDOWS 95 and RED ALERT, both due later this year, will offer TCP/IP support for play over the Internet. Watch for reviews of these two products in the upcoming months for more detailed information on their internet play. ANZER ONLINE offers several smaller scenarios suitable for play during a lunch hour, such as Poland. But even the larger PG scenarios are manageable, due to parameters you define. For example, instead of waiting for your opponent to take his entire turn, you can move in alternating impulses: 1 move three German units, you move five Russians, etc. This results in some interesting strategic decisions. Do I send out tacti cal air to soften up defenses, knowing that my opponent might send fighters to intercept? Or do I throw my superior armor into the breach, knowing that my infantry won't follow until the enemy has had a chance to respond? These questions are rendered more acute by an unusual factor for a turn-based game: time pressure. The version of PG ONLINE that we saw was experimenting with user-defined time limits. You could give your opponent more time (say 5 minutes an impulse to move those massive Russian armies, or put pres sure on a veteran German player, giving him only 2 minutes. It's a lot like speed chess with WWII combined arms. When you throw in the extra scenarios designed specifically for two-player play, PG ONLINE looks like a sure winner for TEN.

JAGGED ALLIANCE may well be the computer game version of The Dirty Dozen.

"ONLINE GAMES. PLAY BY E-MAIL Time Flies When You're On The Net Have Your Time and Game, Too, With Play By E-Mail BY JOHNNY L. WILSON t's been around since e-mail first appeared. It's usually text-based. It's always turn-based. Sometimes it's free. Sometimes you pay by the turn. It's not for everybody, but it's an answer for those who can't be online for hours on end and a perfect answer for gamers who have very little time to game, period. It's Play By Electronic Mail (PBEM). At its simplest, PBEM can merely be two players swapping saved game files for PANZER GENERAL or a host of other turn-based games. Al its most complex, PBEM can be a multiplayer game where hundreds of people play. It offers the advantage of letting busy people play games that would normally require a group. Instead, PBEM gamers shift time and play games lasting months that would normally be played in one evening or one day of real-time, face-to-face play. Multiplayer Play By Electronic Mail is an extension of the postal gaming hobby. Multiplayer PBEM is any game where all the players submit their move(s) by e-mail, form or online program during an established period of time and wait for the response of the batchprocessed move. PBEM began with games like Chess on mainframes and migrated to the online services with Chess and Diplomacy. Today, there are all kinds of PBEM games available online with a variety of pricing structures. Some are free; some are advertiser sup. ported; some require a set fee per turn these are usually online ver. sions of long-lasting play-by-mail games); some charge a flat fee; and some charge by the hour. This article will list some of the multiplayer PBEM games with which we're most impressed. HUNDRED YEARS WAR (currently available on AOL): Master wargame designer Jim Dunnigan has developed an amazing experience where hundreds of players assume the roles of medieval nobles and vie for control of fiefs in France and England. To some, Hundred Years War is a role-playing game with player interaction being the key. To others, HYW is pure diplomacy--the art of the deal. To others, it is a turn-based wargame with economic elements. HYW is all of these and more. Nobles use a simple menu-based form to input their economic decisions for each fief, military maneuvers and role playing decisions (such as taking one's wife or mistress abed, arranging marriages, or gambling to increase one's funds), as well as correspond with the hundreds of nobles represented in each game. The next day, results are printed in the chronicles of the game or in the individual fief and noble summaries. Although the results of various games can vary far from the results of history, HYW does a wonderful job of demonstrating the chaos and intrigue of medieval politics. Every student of history should try it as an educational experience, but wargamers simply shouldn't miss it. (AOL pricing applies.) PRESIDENT '96 (available on AOL and the World Wide Web): At press time, Crossover Technologies' PRESIDENT '96 game was just moving into the convention season where daily moves are weighted over the convention proxy moves of sending all your moves at once. Throughout the primary season, weekly moves were sufficient. In this game, thousands of \"campaign managers\" fill out weekly (now, daily) forms to advise their candidates (fictional characters that may reflect amalgams of well-known personalities in each party) on responding or not responding to the issues of the day or to various deals offered by other candidates. Moves are handled via form-based input, so the interface is dead simple. The issues are as complex as those in the real world, though, so don't underestimate the challenge of the game. Crossover doesn't like being referred to as a PBEM game because PRESIDENT '96 offers multimedia speeches by the candidates in video and audio, faux Web pages for each candidate, and online chat/ 12 Netscape President 6 Deal Status!

"ONLINE GAMES MODEMS Strings Attached f you've done any modem-based gaming, you're no doubt familiar with the dreaded initialization strings that set modems' various feature switches on and off. Though arcane at first, once you get the hang of them, they're not so horrendous. There's a fairly standard lexicon of AT commands among modems: however, vendors often have their own as well. Check your documentation to see how to implement these features. We'd like to tell you there's a silver-bullet init string that will work across the board, but there isn't. More often than not, it comes down to trial and error from game to game and modem to modem. Many titles' readme files include modem string settings for different modems, but here are a few string settings that usually work well with most games: In general, modems communicate with one another with varied success, with throughput ranging from pretty speedy to butt slow. In particular, early on different vendors' modems manufactured to the V.34 specification had difficulty connecting to one another in higher speed modes; sometimes they couldn't establish a connection at all. Many of the incompatibilities have since been remedied, and most modems from different vendors will connect to one another. The hit rate on establishing higher-speed connections is also on the upswing. But to better understand the issues involved, it's helpful to consider the whole \"network\" involved in making modem connections happen. String What It Does AT Z AT &F Resets modem to the configuration stored in nonvolatile memory and clears any other settings. Most basic setting; puts modem in \"autoreliable\" mode, where it will negoti. ate error correction and compression for best connection AT &C1 &D2 Sets carrier detect the way many games expect it. his could be the year online, real-time gam ing really takes off, with a host of services all vying to become your online playground. If you want to play it on the line, a modem is your ticket to the fun zone. Modems have greatly improved over the last few years, with gains not only in speed but in capabilities like fax and simultaneous voice and data. But modems are notorious for causing more than their share of configuration headaches. Because of rapidly changing standards, modems have been dogged by compatibility problems that some times keep them from communicating at their top speeds. Adding to the confusion, modem settings-what's enabled and disabled-vary from game to game. So one game's smooth settings may make another crash and burn. The key to making online gaming happen is knowing the three things gamers need most out of a modem: low latency, speed and compatibility. Latency is the amount of time required to transmit data from your rig to another to keep a multiplayer game going. Low latency is espe. cially crucial in action titles, where the lag time can make or break the overall experience. Modem speeds have been on the rise, with the data rates making their way toward 28.8 kilobits per second (Kbps) and newer modems going to 33.6 Kbps. The fatter pipe means more data across the wire, more opponents, more mayhem, more... You get the idea. CALL ROTO-ROOTER In fairness, the modem isn't always the culprit; phone lines often dictate how fast two modems are going to communicate. Phone lines were originally designed to carry voice signals, not data generated by modems, and line \"impairments\" -caused by the distance the signal travels and by certain pieces of routing equipment that phone compa. nies use-often keep modems from achieving top speeds. Line quality for any given call can vary greatly, which partly explains why you'll get 21.6 Kbps on an Internet service provider (ISP) connection one day and 24.4 Kbps the next. The latest International Telecommunications Union (ITU) specifica. tion, which new modems use, is called V.34. It calls for throughput of 28.8 Kbps. ITU recently agreed upon an extension of V.34 that calls for boosting throughput to 33.6 Kbps. For gamers, the fatter pipe may mean more opponents, sometimes as many as 16, which can make for quite a ruckus. But while modem speeds have been steadily increasing, one issue has by and large been ignored: latency. Experienced online gamers are already painfully familiar with the problem, where a game's rate of play is consistently poky, or worse still, varies wildly. Unfortunately, my esteemed profession is partly to blame for this predicament. Because the focus of modem reviews in computer magazines has concentrated on speed, speed, and more speed, that's where modem vendors have concentrated their efforts, instead of trying to minimize latency. Modems use different buffering schemes to increase overall through. put, but any memory buffer is like another train stop on your home. ward commute, so the extra speed comes at the cost of added latency. In Web surfing and other online activities, where most of the traffic is flowing one way-to you-latency isn't really noticeable. But with highly interactive, twitch-and-splalter titles like QUAKE, or real-time strategy titles like WARCRAFT II, where data needs to be passed rapidly back and forth between two or more rigs, latency can really rain on your parade. What's more, game data usually has to make four modem passes-out your modem, through your ISP's modem, through another ISP's modem, and into the other guy's modemto reach a fellow gamer, compounding the latency problem Recent research at ZD Labs showed that nearly all modems have similar latency times, ranging anywhere from about 80 to 100 millisec onds with good line conditions. As a rule, as line condition goes south, latency increases. Latency problems are further exacerbated by the Internet, which is no speed demon. If you've ever used the Ping command to see if another computer is on the Net, you've probably seen it returns a round-trip time of milliseconds-typically in the CG OCTOBER 1996 "

"ONLINE GAMES MODEMS 200-300 millisecond range. So Internet gaming can sometimes be subject to almost a half-second of latency, which normally isn't much time but in an action game can be an eternity. Some online gaming services have been crafting workarounds to bring latency down, but the jury is still out as to how effective these tricks will be. Emerging technologies like Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and cable modems may begin to address the problem (see sidebar) but they're still a ways from widespread implementation. In the short term, we'll be dealing with at least some latency. So how do you squeeze the most performance out of the current crop of modems? We tested five modems to see how they fared for gaming. Three of these modems also have Digital Simultaneous Voice and Data (DSVD) technology implemented, which lets you make a data connection with another PC and talk to the gamer at the other end of the line. We trekked down to ZD Labs and used their TAS tele. phone network emulator to evaluate the units. The TAS simulates typical line conditions found on the Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) that most of us use to get online. TAS allowed us to have the same testing environment, or line condition, for all modems evaluated. Unfortunately at press time, none of the Windows 95 titles we had in house that used DirectPlay--the modem/networking component of Microsoft's DirectX application programming interface (API) family, were solid enough to use as testing tools. But as those titles begin to ship, we'll be looking at their head-to-head modem play and how well they do when connecting to online gaming services. So without further ado, let's have at it. sure it's Plug-and-Play (PnP). Non PnP internal modems are fraught with configuration problems under Windows 95, and will probably conflict with your rig's existing COM ports. Unless you really enjoy whiling away the hours trying to solve seemingly paradoxical I/O conflicts, save yourself the trouble and go with an external modem. The external PnP units we evaluated installed in less than 5 min. utes, and were pretty much ready to rock in both DOS and Windows 95. In both our test systems, we ran into numerous conflicts with nonPnP internal modems trying to hook to COM ports and having to fight Windows 95 to access them. Interestingly, Hayes's PnP Accura internal modem came up without a glitch, as did Creative's external Modem Blaster 28, also a PnP unit. External Modena BLASTER CREATIVE LABS MODEM BLASTER 28.8 Creative's Modem Blaster (is there anything these guys won't blast?) had one of the easiest installations. Both internal and external versions are PnP, but only the external version came up in both Windows 95 and DOS sans difficulties. The internal version relies on Creative's PnP utility to get its 1/0 resource settings in MS-DOS mode, and this utility wouldn't assign the same 1/0 settings we used success. fully in Windows 95. In addition, the DOS-based Diagnose utility wouldn't allow us to map the same 1/0 resources used in 28:8-Esterly Instant Internet Access pl. the Hottest Moden Games High Performance 28.800 bps/1.34 External Mede Easy Installation and Configuration Stock External Case with LED Display FPLE kternet, Games and Consunications Software ETA SA CREATIVE YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE? The first painful lesson we learned here was this: Get a Plug-and Play external modem! If you have to go with an internal model, make ADSI: The Next Big Thing? hough latency tends to be the primary culprit in sluggish modem gameplay, a fatter pipe wouldn't hurt either. A recent quote from id programming guru John Carmack is telling. Commenting on QUAKE's somewhat sluggish modem play, he said, \"I've been playing it over my T1 connection, and the gameplay seems fine.\" A T1 connection is what most medium-sized corporations use to connect their entire outfit to the Internet. T1 offers 1.54 megabits per second (Mbps) of bandwidth, over 50 times faster than current modems, but it's prohibitively, expensive for most individual users (Ferrari drivers excepted). Faster, lower-latency communications methods are needed to get the online gaming train really rolling. Predictions about the next dominant communications pipe are best left to genies and mages. Here are a few technologies that are brewing and may make their way into your home over the next few years. Current modem technologies connect to one another at a top rate of 33,6 Kbps. Using clever compression tricks, modems can sometimes deliver an effective transfer rate of 115.2 Kbps. But games often want compression disabled for their connections, since this feature tends to add overhead (more latency). There's been quite a buzz surrounding technologies like Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), which can deliver a 128 Kbps pipe, and cable modems, which may one day be widely available to deliver even fatter pipes. ISDN's other big appeal for gamers is that its latency is considerably less-reportedly about half-that of conventional modems. Both technologies face their own hurdles, though. There's still some specification squabbling over how ISDN achieves its 128 Kbps pipe. And as for cable modems, which may be able to deliver a 10-Mbps plus pipe (burn, baby burn!), cable companies will first need to retrofit some of their infrastructure before these modems can become widely available. _ Since phone companies don't want to be left in the dust, they are developing a new specification of their own. Asymmetric Digital S ubscriber Line (ADSL) will run over standard phone lines, and may deliver as much as 6 Mbps downstream (into your home), and 64 Kbps upstream. Latency for ADSL is supposed to be comparable to that of ISDN, and will be good news for gamers init achieves widespread implementation. ADSL may even have a fighting chance, since it requires very little additional equipment and phone companies don't need to do major plumbing upgrades to make it happen. We'll be following all these technologies as the online gaming world continues to blossom, and we'll keep you apprised. Stay tuned. OCTOBER 1996 "

"ONLINE GAMES MODEMS OSVD Modens:A Big Happy Dysfunctional Family! number of modem vendors have recently brought out Digital Simultaneous Voice and Data (DSVD) modems, which let you talk to a fellow gamer. At first glance, it's a pretty cool technology, Most implementations take a 28.8 Kbps connection and divide it up, giving the voice channel about 9.6 Kbps and data transmission the remaining 19.2 Kbps. Voice quality is on a par with what you'd hear on a normal phone, and hands-free headsets are widely available, letting you focus your attention where it belongs. But like any technology, DSVD has its limitations. Most notably, DSVD is a point-to-point technology, meaning it works fine for two people connecting directly, but online game services aren't imple menting DSVD features, they are opting instead for their own voice-chat functionality. So once you re in a chat room or into a game with more than two players, DSVD can no longer be used. DSVD has also suffered from compatibility woes, with different vendors offering slightly varied versions of DSVD modems, which may or may not talk to one another in DSVD mode, To squeeze your voice data through a 9.6-Kbps pipe, DSVD modems use a speech coder/decoder, or codec, to compress and decompress your voice transmission. Vendors have pretty much settled on two different codecs for DSVD: one called TrueSpeech and another called DigiTalk. DSVD modems from different vendors that use the same speech codec can usually connect in DSVD mode: two modems that use different speech codecs, cannot. Is DSVD a good option for gamers? If you're headed online for multiplayer adventures, DSVD doesn't bring much to the party. But if you do a lot of head-to-head gaming against people with compat ible DSVD modems, this technology lets you squeeze the frag and the taunt into one phone line instead of two. was good for the most part.

HAYES ACCURA 28.8 DSVD Hayes has been in the modem game for many moons, and Hayes compatibility is something of an industry standard. Their Accura 28.8 DSVD is positioned as \"The Total Gaming Solution,\" and it does cover many of the bases. Their software bundle includes starter kits for sev. eral ISPs and online services, fax and communications front-ends, as well as a voice mail application that turns your PC into an answering machine. Most notable for gamers though, is a bundled copy of Papyrus's NASCAR RACING. Windows 95 installation was absolutely painless. After we put in the PnP card, Windows 95 detected the Accura on startup. We fed it a driver disk, and Windows 95 installation was a done deal. Because PnP devices can sometimes be allocated I/O resources that DOS applications can't use, Hayes includes a DOS program called COMSET16, which sets 1/0 resources when you reboot into DOS.

Our initial impression of the 14.4 Kbps model was that it had some good ideas but also some rough edges. The nonPnP 28.8-Kbps version hasn't refined these rough edges, which include a borderline-sadistic installation routine and a proprietary DOS utility designed to connect you to other gamers-in DSVD mode if they're also using a HeadOn. Curiously, the HeadOn is the only DSVD modem reviewed here that needs additional 1/0 resources (one IRQ and one I/O address) to enable its DSVD functionality. Because HeadOn relies pretty heavily on its own utilities to make modem connections happen for games, it only supports a limited AT command set, which makes manually configuring it a bit more difficult. In fact, we fussed with this modem for four hours, and despite a lengthy tech support call and various attempted workarounds with two different systems, we were unable to get the HeadOn to come Hayes Total Gaming Solution $* ACCUBA INTERNAL Modernos Weth Sentancours INTRA CG OCTOBER 1996 "

"MODEMS ONLINE GAMES deserves serious consideration as your next modem. Supersonic up at all. Given the severe installation difficulties, we can't recommend the HeadOn. It seems Eiger Labs had some good ideas, but their nonstandard, propri etary implementation seems to cause more problems than it solves. US ROBOTICS SPORTSTER VI US Robotics' Sportster Vi is a DSVD modem that ships with a couple of ISP starter kits, a version of Intel's ProShare, and a fax/communications front-end. It's non-PnP, so you're left to muck with jumpers. There's a Windows utility called Comtest, which recommends 1/0 settings before you actually install the modem. But after we followed its recommendations, Comtest failed to find the modem, despite trying three different 1/0 settings and two different modems. Also, the driver installation is buried in the Intel ProShare install disks, a minor annoy. ance. As it turns out, the Sportster Vi's documentation wasn't updated after Windows 95 shipped, so there's no mention of Windows 95 installation, nor is there a configuration file to tell Windows 95 what kind of modem the Vi is. Some deep digging on USR's Web and FTP sites finally turned up the correct.INF file. But because this modem is non.PnP, we had a good deal of trouble clearing I/O conflicts in both our test systems so it would work under Windows 95. The Vi's DOS performance was good, and gameplay for the most part was smooth. However, the Vi was unable to con nect in DSVD mode, and installation under Windows 95 required us to go on a driver quest in addition to the repeated 1/0 headaches. Overall, the Vi delivers good DOS gaming performance, but because this unit is non-PnP and internal you'd do well to either opt for one of US Robotic's external models. If you have to go internal, you may want to look elsewhere Incred 28.8 Faxmodem with DSVD Digital Simultaneous Voice and Data with True V.34 DIAMOND SUPRASONIC 336V+ The SupraSonic 336V+ is Diamond's \"high-performance\" model, whereas their SupraExpress line is positioned as their \"better-value\" offering. Given the fact that few applications pound on a modem the way fast-paced games can, you'd do well to shell out the extra bucks and go with the high-performance model. Windows 95 detected the PnP SupraSonic without any hiccups and installed the appropriate dri. ver. The unit also worked fine under DOS, and because it's an external unit, there's no need for a PnP configura. tion utility. Sportster Vi The SupraSonic is a 33.6 Kbps modem, though you'll need another 33.6 Kbps modem at the other end to achieve that speed. Even then, mediocre phone line conditions may negotiate the connection down to 28.8 Kbps or lower. But as more 33.6 Kbps units hit the market, connec tion speeds hopefully will creep up toward the desired speed. As firmware updates become avail. able, the SupraSonic's ROM can easily be flash-updated. Another nice feature of the SupraSonic 336V+ is its LCD display. which displays what the unit's doing (dialing, negotiating) and the type of connection that's been established. Gameplay with DOS titles moved along well with the SupraSonic. Even QUAKE, which really pounds modems with a lot of data, wasn't bad from the client side, which tends to be the slowpoke. NASCAR was very smooth as well.

You may think all you'll need is a shotgun, a Kevlar vest and an attitude, but that's not enough for the real world. If you want to play, you got to get therea clean connection is everything. Connecting to the net for some virtual payback to the buddy who fragged you online is easy if you do it right. So listen up, meathcad. 'The first thing you need is a good ISP. ISP does not stand for Illuminati Socicly of Patagonia. An ISP is an Internet service provider. As opposed to dialing up your buddly direct, Internet connections require you to first hook up to a friendly ISP. Some ISPs have bulletproof installation programs, but others will throwa floppy at you and leave you to rot. But you've got the right weapon in your kit: Windows 95, which makes con necting to the Net so easy a raw recruit like you can do it. First, the basics. The Internet uses a network protocol called TCP/IP. Basic TCP/IP setup is a snap. You need the TCP/IP addresses used by your Intemet provider, the names of its mail server and news server, an account name and a password. Next, you need to be able to connect. Having a modem is only the first step; you also need to have dial-up networking and TCP/IP installed. If you don't have any network stuff set up-odds are you c on't--you need to load this from the Windows 95 CD. First, add the Dial-Up Adapter. It fools your computer into thinking your modem is a network card, using the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which can also handle other protocols like 1PX, NetWare's main protocol. To install the Dial-Up Adapter, run Control Panel, select Add/Remove Programs and click on the Windows Setup tab. The Dial-Up Adapter is part of the Communications package: Just doubleclick on the Modems icon, select Dial-Up Adapter, and let Windows 95 do its thing. Next, you'll need to install the TCP/IP protocol. Cct that Control Panel back up. run the Network applet, and click on the ISP does not stand for Illuminati Society of Patagonia. An ISP is an Internet Service Provider. Add button. Double-click on Protocol, select Microsoft, then click on TCP/IP. Windows 95 will install the TCP/IP driver and restart itself. Now you need to add the TCP/IP addresses of your ISP. There may be a number of different IP addresses, but the three main numbers are your rig's IP number, the primary DNS and the secondary DNS. IP addresses look like numbers with too many decimal places-usually four numbers separated by three periods. DNS stands for domain name server, it's your primary link to the outside world. The DNS takes the computer name you send it (say, ZD.COM) and translates it to an IP address that it understands (say, 155.23.48.493). Once TCP/IP has the IP address, it can then communicate with the remote computer. Because there are only so many possible IP numbers and millions of new computers on the Net, some ISPs are taking advantage of Win 95's Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This allows the ISP's server to dynamically assign you an IP number each time you login, keeping more numbers available for general use, since you give the number up when you end vour session. Of course, for us gamer types, this method poses a probLAB NOTES MMX Gives Unreal a Dose of Reality Epic MegaGames (http://www. epicgames.com) will be one of the first games out to make use of Intel's new MMX technology. MMX adds 57 specialized math instructions to the Pentium and Pentium Pro, enabling greater efficiency among certain types of math functions. The folks at Epic Games are using MMX to make better use of color The MMX-enabled version of Unreal will use 8-bit textures (.e., each texture can have up to 256 colors) on polygonal objects. However, each texture will have its own palette, and the game will run in 24-bit color mode, which has the potential of making the game look much better. If Unreal can deliver the performance and gameplay to go with the better look, then this game might just be, well, unreal. The first MMX-enabled chip, the 200MHz Pentium P55C, should be ship ping by the end of this year. OCTOBER 1996 CG "


"LOYD CASE TIPS! TECHNOLOGY > If you've just dropped a wad on a spanking new Pentium Pro system, you may have noticed that game performance isn't what you expected. Fear not, there's help available, in the form of a utility called FASTVID. FASTVID can be downloaded from the Action Games forum on CompuServe (GO ACTION). Written by John Hinckley of Vistapro fame, FASTVID streamlines memory accesses and data transfers by the Pentium Pro. For example, a Pentium 166 may run Quake at 11-13 fps (at 640x480); with the same graphics card, a Pentium Pro may get QUAKE at 16-17 fps. FASTVID can boost the performance up to 22-24 fps. you're playing a game with a friend through the Internet, the data packets may have passed through a number of computers in a complex relay (called hops) to get from your friend's system to yours. Even in the best of connections, there's a bit of time delay added this time delay is called latency. Recently, I participated in a NetMech game using Kali95, and discovered that one particular Mech couldn't be killed, even when four other players were pounding on him. He wasn't cheating: latency was the culprit. His NetMech program was out of sync with the others, and so the damage from weapons fire wasn't being properly recorded. lem: What the hell is my IP number this time? Cames that can use TCP/IP directly will require you to know your IP number so other gamers can connect to your rig Kali95 will report this information, but if you're going direct over TCP/IP, you can get your IP number using an undocumented Win 95 utility called IP Configuration, which will report all relevant IP information. Run it by going to the Start menu, selecting Run, and typing \"winipcfg\". (If your ISP has assigned you a static IP address, you won't have to worry about this; check with your ISP). There's one last picce of the puzzle you need to get from the Windows 95 CD: the Dial-Up Scripting Tool. Dial-up scripts are strings of commands and responses, like a DOS batch file, that automatically log you on with your ISP. The Dial-Up Scripting Tool is on the CD in the directory \\admin apptools/dscript. Install it by rumning the Add Programs applet in the Control Panel, selecting the System tab, then finding the correct directory on the CD. When you install the scripting tool, some sample scripts are installed; you can modify them, but the tweaks aren't necessarily straightforward. Because each ISP handles logins in its own quirky way, you may need to contact your ISP's tech support desk for help. Microsoft's Plus pack has an Internet Wizarch installation tool that cases TCP/IP setup, though manual setup will also get you there. to the Net, rather than Windows 95's protocol stack. It works, but it makes installing other TCP/IP applications difficult. I use a local ISP that has one of the best installation routines I've seen. It even configured the dial-up script for my connection; all I had to do was add the IP addresses for the DNSs and the phone number I wanted to use to connect OK, you've installed TCP/IP, got the Dial-Up Adapter working and can even run Netscape or Internet Explorer to connect to outside Web sites. What about games? Unfortunately, there's no standard way to connect to other games. Online gaming services, like the Total Entertain ment Network, MPath, and Dwango charge money, but they facilitate the process of finding other gamers and their networks have some provisions for speeding up overall game performance. Tools like Kali95 (see last month's column), let you play your IPX-networked games over TCP/IP. Some games, like QUAKE, can use TCP/IP directly. So until some of the standards begin to shake out, it will really depend on the game. Once you can actually connect, there are still two big headaches you might encounter. The first is modem hassles. Your modem and those used by your ISP may not get along very well. I had enormous problems with US Robotics Sportster modems with one particular ISP, but have had no problems with the same modem in connecting to CompuServe or other services. Contact your service provider's tech support for advice The second problem is more subtle, perhaps more insidious, and is difficult to control: latency. The Internet is a huge network of interconnected computers. If GET THE MACHINE THAT GOES... You can test the latency in a crude way by using an undocumented utility called PING that exists in your Windows 95 COMMAND directory. To use it, you need to know either the domain name or IP address of the server in question. You bring up a DOS prompt in a DOS box (i.e., run the MS-DOS command prompt from the Windows 95 task bar). Type \"ping domain name\" or \"ping IP address\". PING will respond with messages that indicate the number of milliseconds it took to send a packet to the other server and get a reply back. You'll find typical response times of 200-300 milliseconds over the Internet, which can be too long for some games. Modems compound the problem somewhat with their own latency. which can range from 170 to about 250 milliseconds. So between the Internet and your modem, you may get upward of a half-second delay. For garden-variety data transfers and Web surfing, it's not much of a problem. But games requiring latencies of less than 200 milliseconds are probably not good candidates for play over the Intemet. Unfortunately, the internal network latency of a multiplayer game isn't published in the documentation, so trial and error, or a call to the game vendor's tech support rep, may be the only answer. There's a lot more to the Internet than we can cover here, but you've got the basics. Now get out there and frag somebody AVOIDING THE THUMB SCREWS If you have a good ISP, then they've probably tried to make installation fairly painless, but the results are often mixed. For example, AT&T's Worldnet software uses its own TCP/IP software to conncct CG OCTOBER 1996 "

What's really inviting about Mystique is its price: $199 for the 2 MB version, and S279 for the 4 MB version Despite a tradition of blazing WinBench performance, past Matrox accelerators had less-than-stellar DOS performance and compatibility problems with some DOS titles, but Matrox has taken these problems to heart, and the result is flawless, speedy DOS-title performance with EF2000, DUKE NUKEM 3D, THE NEED FOR SPEED SE, and QUAKE. Frame rates on all these titles are smooth, even at some higher VESA display modes, thanks in part to Mystique's VESA 2.0 support in its firmwarc. Mystique continues the Matrox tradition of kicking ass and taking names in 2D Windows performance, with WinBench scores staying in the 29-30 Graphic WinMarks range at 800x600x256 colors, 800x600x16,530 colors, and 1024x768x256 colors. PLICHT UNLIMITED 95, which uses Direct3D title uses this form of texture compression, Mystique will accelerate it. All in all, Matrox has put together a very fast 2D board with pretty impressive 3D performance as well. Mystique is very competitively priced in both its 2 MB and 4MB versions, and would be a solid addition to a tricked-out gaming rig. Z-buffering of the Direct3D titles that were far enough along to run, Microsoft's HELLBENDER looked pretty impressive, and the enhanced scenes sped along nicely compared to the title running sans hardware acceleration. Of the bundle Ware we saw, the Mystique-accelerated version of MECH WARRIOR 2 was dramatically improved over the unaccelerated version, with all ground surfaces beautifully texture-mapped. And despite a lack of bilinear filtering, these texture-map surfaces looked smooth. Matrox decided not to have Mystique support bilinear interpolation in favor of keeping frame rates in the 30-plus fps range, since this feature essentially quadruples the computation involved in rendering every texel (textured pixel). Matrox believes that developers will instead favor a form of texture compression called Color Lookup Table 8, or CLUTS. This form of compression gives each texture its own 8-bit (256-color) palette, as opposed to storing the textures in 16-bit RCB APPEAL: Gamers who want to accelerate their DOS titles and be able to get more out of Direct3D games when they ship en masse. PROS: A 2D screamer that delivers solid 3D performance as well. Nice added touch of embedded utility for changing resolutions. CONS: Does not support bilinear filtering, which can smooth overall image quality. Minor texture distortion in MECHWARRIOR 2. The installation is a bit confusing.

"CRYSTALIZER TIDALWAVE 32  REVIEW Crystal Clear Sound But Not Quite Ready For Prime Time 19 0 10 N1211 in part to a 2 MB General MIDI wavetable patch set. Most of the instruments, as well as drum kits, sounded very good, though the homs were somewhat thin. Supposedly, the card can record and play back audio at 48KHZ by Sheldon Leemon he TidalWave 32 is touted as an outstanding performer with an especially easy Plug-and-Play (PnP) installation. In fact, the board does deliver good overall sound quality, but its irksome installation utility doesn't quite live up to its claims. The Tidal Wave 32, like most recent sound cards, is completely software-configurable. But here's where it gets kludgy: Windows 95 detected the PnP board's presence at startup, but the install routine didn't finish the job. According to the documentation, drivers for the card's four components (audio, wavetable synth, joystick port, and IDE CD-ROM controller) must be installed individually, in a particular order. The installation software originally set the wavetable device to IRQ 10. An error message indicated that this device wasn't working, so we had to manually switch it to IRQ 7, using the Device Manager, in order to get it to work Once we slogged through the installation, the card sounded very good, thanks than monaural sound with the TidalWave's Sound Blaster emulation. In Windows 95 however, we came across no other liccups, and titles using DirectSound worked fine, with General MIDI music sounding very good. Crystal Computer is a relative newcomer to the sound card arena, and while the TidalWave 32 gets some things right, ils rough edges can't be overlooked. If you're looking for good gaming audio and clean General MIDI, and don't mind massaging its installalion a little, TidalWave 32 delivers on much of its promise. ENTRUMMORUMU (DAT quality), but the bundled wave editor's maximum sampling rate was 44 KHz (audio CD quality). We couldn't test the full-duplex audio feature-useful for speaker phone-like applications such as Intemet Phone--because the drivers weren't quite ready Some games like WARCRAFT II can Some games \"AutoDetect\" audio hardware, but they were unable to automatically identify this card as Sound Blaster compatible. In these cases, manually tweaking the sound card settings usually fixes the problem, but DUKE NUKEM 3D couldn't produce more APPEAL: For those interested in good gaming audio and wavetable synthesis with General MIDI. PROS: Good sound once installed, fairly solid Sound Blaster compatibility. CONS: Clumsy installation that is somewhat at odds with the card's lofty \"Plug and Play\" claims.

"SCORPIA  ADVENTURE/RPG Tex Murphy, Part Deux adven'tu rus, put ary underg Tired Of Walking Out Of Interactive Movies? Try THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE It all started so simply. Tex Murphy, old-style P.I., is approached by Gordon Fitzpatrick to locate an old friend, Thomas Malloy. It's just a whim, so he says, brought on by seeing Malloy's picture in the newspaper. Murphy, down on his luck and needing cash, takes the case. Before long, he's involved with serial killers, the 1947, Roswell, NM UFO; conspiracies; double-crosses; inscrutable Mayan references; and a mysterious beautiful woman. Finding missing persons was never quite like this in Hammett and Chandler. Tex begins to wonder if he might not be in a little over his head, but it's too late to turn back now. For belter or worse, he must follow the twisting trail to the end. THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE, the sequel to Access's hit UNDER A KILLING MOON, is a complicated story, and a big part of the game is watching that story unfold. So it wouldn't do lo give away too much of the plot. Besides, how things go in the game depends in large measure on how you play the part of Tex Murphy. FORKS IN THE ROAD You can choose from three main paths through PANDORA, leading to seven different possible endings. The routes can be summed up as \"nice guy\" (Mission Street), \"neutral guy\" (Lombard Street) and nasty guy\" (Boulevard of Broken Dreams). The Mission Street path has two endings, Lombard one, and Boulevard four. Tex's actions in the game, particularly how he deals with people in certain situations, determine the route and conclusion. So it isn't any one event but the development of Tex's personality over time that determines the outcome-as well as sex1 The ability to develop Tex's personality is worth the price of admission all by itself. LL CRYSTAL BALL  Gazing into the crystal ball this month, your adventure-game soothsayer sees a famous man...a big man...a man who has played Fred Flintstone in the movies. Yes, it's John Goodman, and with him are members of the seminal '70s come dy troupe Firesign Theater. What are these clowns doing in CGW's crystal ball, you ask? Why, they're involved in a full-on, hilarious-looking parody of one of the best-selling computer games of all time. We'd tell you which one, but we're getting all misty-eyed just thinking about the comic possibilities. Look for a sneak preview next month. Family Another celebrity in the crystal ball is horrormeister Wes Craven, who is collaborating with Cyberdreams to create his first computer game, Principles of Fear. We don't know much about this late '97 release yet, other than that it's (what else?) a psychological thriller, told from the perspectives of a man and his 10-year-old daughter, with much of the action taking place within (what else?) the dreams of the characters. Uh, Freddy is dead, isn't he? AULAY TANEL the dro MURPHY, P.I. Players familiar with UNDER A KILLING Moon will feel right at home in THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE. It features the same engine with an identical interface as its predecessor. OCTOBER 1996 "


"SCORPIA ADVENTUREIRPG EIGHT MONTHS A WEEK The big gaffe in The Pandora Directive is the Mayan date puzzle, based on the 260-day Mayan calendar. To open one of the Pandora boxes, you first figure out some Mayan dates (which is easy), then calculate what they would be in our calendar, and line them up on the box. I thought this would be a snap, since I happen to have a Mayan calendar (really), As it turned out, however, the puzzle designer set it up wrong, inadvertently treating Mayan days as months. This gives results rather far from reality. I discussed the matter with Access, who were a little nonplused by their error. However, after doublechecking the material in the game, they believe that if players work on the puzzle using only the clues provided, they will come up with the solution the game expects. So, don't go running off to the library for a book on Mayan civilization. Use only what is provided in the game itself to solve the puzzle. Thom.

There is definitely more here than solving a few puzzles. PANDORA also presents two modes of play: Entertainment and Game Player. The two coincide fairly closely in most respects: the main difference is that Entertainment can give you answers if you're stuck, while Came Player has more points and a few extra puzzles. Entertainment mode doesn't tell you everything, however. The answer screen will get you through the adventure part of the game, including conversations. With the Pandora puzzle boxes and a few other things though, you're strictly on your own. If you find them too hard, you can type in a code to solve the puzzle automatically, at a certain cost in points, but you won't get any hints toward the solution In Came Player mode, no hints or help are offered; you depend strictly on your own brainwork. Additionally, the puzzles at this level come with bonus points and either a time limit or a move limit. Por a time-limited puzzle, you have a certain amount of free time\" on the clock. When that runs out, both regular points and bonus points begin decreasing. 'The bonus can run down to zero, but most of the time the regular points maintain a minimum regardless of how long it takes to reach a solution. The move-limited puzzles are similar, except that you have free moves instead of free time. If you use up your free moves, once again both bonus and regular points start decreasing Should you find that too tougl, you have the option to switch to Entertainment level.

"SCORPIA ADVENTURE/RPG you can ask people about topics from a list of subjects or give or show from the inventory. Naturally, not everyone will know about everything, but it's usually a good idea to go over everything once with each person. You can save your game almost anytime. The save feature is, in fact, the most claborate I've seen. The number of saves is limited only by your drive space, and all save files are less than 5K. Each save is stamped with the real-world day and time and the game day and location, and to these you can add your own comments. Finally, more than one person can play at the same time: You provide a player name at the start of a new game, and this is used for the on-disk save-file names. PLAN 9—NOT!

In another cutscene, players learn of some con game itself and lends nection between the Roswell crash in 1947 and Tex's current case an air of artificiality. in San Francisco, circa 2043. And if the designers insist on time limits. PATHS OF GLORY Despite these critcisms, THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE is still a superior entry in the adventure field. It is evident that Access took a great deal of care (most of the time) to provide a game that's enjoyable for both novice and experienced players. Complete captioning, dual-play mode, a detailed hint system, a simple interface, easy travel, a wide range of puzzles, an excellent save facility and an interesting story line all combine to make a pretty good game in themselves. Best of all is the the multiple paths. The ability to develop the lead character's personality in certain ways-ways that have a definite, material effect on the conclusion, irrespective of puzzlesolving-is worth the price of admission by itself. This is something you expect in a role-playing game, but rarely if ever see there. To find it in an adventure is amazing, to say the least. So don't let the \"interactive movie\" label put you off; THE PANDORA DIRECTIVE is worthy of your attention, whatever your level of gaming expertise. CG OCTOBER 1996 "

I sure hope so, because we can certainly use some good new products, especially role-playing games. Many of the letters I've been receiving lately have said, pretty much, \"adventure games are nice, but where are the CRPGs??\" Where, indeed? So few have been released this year you can count them on one hand. That's dismal, to say the least. The renaissance of the adventure game has really overshadowed the RPG the last couple of years. So we can only hope that, before too long, rumors of such games as the new MIGHT & MACIC, ULTIMA IX, LANDS OF LORE II, DACCERFALL, WIZARDRY VIII, an so on., will turn out to be reality (any game not in my claws, or not in the stores, is a rumor as far as I am concerned). In the meantime, there's still mail on older games to be answered, so let's get to it. RIPPER: People fooling around in the Isis well may be having a little trouble \"breaking the Ice\" (heh). The Egyptian hieroglyphics can be confusing, and this can be a tough puzzle until you catch on to the secret. Then it's as simple as A, B, C, if you know where to start, and you should. STONEKEEP: Fighting in this game was pretty easy for the most part, until the party arrived in the Palace of Shadows. Then it turned very tough, very quickly. With every combat a real life-or-death struggle, I looked around for a better way, and found one: invisibility! Once the group couldn't be seen, the monsters were duck soup. We could walk right up to them, beat on them and they never noticed a thing. Good stuff! Just remember when fighting those skeletons that you have to pick up the skulls, swords and helms they drop, or the critters will come back together again. GABRIEL KNIGHT 2: THE BEAST WITHIN: A lot of gamers are having trouble finding matches at the hunting lodge. First, the fire has to be going in the fireplace. That means visiting all the rooms upstairs, including a certain locked one. Then check the mantle over the fireplace very carefully. The box is small and easy to miss. But if the fire is going, the matches are there, so look close, and you should see them. LANDS OF LORE I: People are still play ing this one, and still having the same difficulties. One of those is the White Tower, particularly the snakes upstairs. Unfortunately, there isn't anything you can do about them once they appear; you just have to stand there and take the damage, So you have to stop them from showing up, and that means killing the ghosts as soon as possible. It's the ghosts that summon the snakes. No ghosts, no snakes. That's easier said than done (as I well know!), but using emerald swords can help matters a great deal; those are the best weapons against spooks. ENTOMORPH: Some folks are a little bugged (heh) by not being able to do anything in the pyramid. At least, not without a certain coin. This is a tricky thing to find, but if you look carefully around the third rebel hideout, you may come across it. Just don't expect anyone there to roll out the carpet for you. ULTIMA VII: SERPENT ISLE: Ycp, the ULTIMAs remain popular, and so do the problems. In this case, it's getting the password to a certain gate up in Cwani land. This one is not easy. First, of course, you have to help the Cwanis. Then you have to remember you're looking for Batlin. Then you have to do something to get on his trail again. Finally, after all that, you need to find someone (not too far off) who will give you the password. ANVIL OF DAWN: Some gamers are, so to speak, stuck on the heights. They've gone through Quagmire, climbed the mountain, and now discover they can't go any farther, at least not on their own. Reaching the evil stronghold across the way requires help, and if you think otherwise, you're just whistling in the dark. RAVENLOFT: STONE PROPHET: Players at the end game are wondering what to do now that they have Anhktepot coming after them. Well, I don't suggest trying to fight him; that's a losing proposition. However, if you've reassembled the two seals and used them in the proper places (which you should do before waking the Big A), then all that's necessary is to play follow-the-leader and bring about the happy reunion. And that's it for this look into the mailbag. Until next time, happy adventuring! Reach Scorpiaat: PAOL: Scorpia's Lair (keyword: scorpia) Delphi: GameSIG (Groups and Clubs menu).

"REVIEW THE ELK MOON MURDER DIFFICULTY LEVEL Shallow Grave ADVENTURE/RPG THE ELK Moon MURDER Looks Pretty, But Gameplay Is Left For Dead by Jeff Green verifications; review casefiles, evidence and notesand receive barking voicemail commands from your boss. The acting throughout the game is surprisingly good, as is the dialog, which helps elevate the characters well above the level of caricature common to this genre. Along with the realistic sets and well-designed interface, ELK MOON, on a superficial level, has the aura of a first-class production. It's only when you actually try to play the thing-a minor detail, I know that you realize just how superficial it is.

Protection: None (CD must be in drive) Designers: Shannon Gilligan, Sam Egan Publisher: Activision Los Angeles, CA (310) 473-9200 Reader Service #: 320 TIME OUT OF JOINT Essentially, THE ELK MOON MURDER is an adventure game rail-shooter, guiding you along and only letting you talk to certain suspects at certain times--and once you've seen the two or three video clips recorded for that person, you can't talk to them again. If you've since discovered a crucial piece of information that contradicts their testimony, too bad. Worse, the game is not smart about knowing when you've picked up information from one character that would affect your questioning of another. That is, the first time you talk to someone, you will always ask the exact same questions and get the same video responses, the second time you talk to them, you'll get the seco nd round of canned questions and answers. What this means is that, depending on the order in which you talk to people, you're often going to know way more than you're going to be allowed to ask. To give one small example, once I knew that Karen Gordon had spent the night with Ed Snyder, I went to talk to him. But because I was visiting him for the first time, I was watching Canned Video Sequence II, and Karen's visit doesn't come up at all. We know he's lying, yet we don't confront him. This reliance on canned could be, even on this level, and it has enough problems that even newbie adventurers should probably think twice before laying down their cash. DEAD AND LOVING IT Activision's two-CD interactive murder mystery is set in Santa l'e, New Mexico almost Tony Hillerman country--and the story bears more than a passing resemblance to that mystery novelist's work (specifically A Thief of Time).

(And, by the way, what kind of detective, other than Inspector Clouseau, would, when making an arrest with his partner, manage to get clobbered on the head with a shovel?) Granted, in all these cases you gave the wrong answer and therefore lost the game--but these are cheap and unsatisfying resolutions to all the red-herring stories. If I picked the wrong suspect, fine. Great. I lost. But how about showing me where I slipped up, rather than just hitting me on the head with a shovel? That's a game ending? Certainly the designers could have done better than that. hours of play. Isuspect this was done to create the illusion of \"replayability,\" but really, there isn't any.

"REVIEW  PHILIP MARLOWE, PRIVATE EYE DIFFICULTY LEVEL ADVENTURE/RPG P Dance, Little Sister, Dance Dis Philip Marlowe CD Don't Stink Up Da Joint by Charles Ardai The Little Sister was the first of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe novels that I read, and what I remember most about the experience is being confused. I later grew to love Chandler, and Marlowe, and have since read all the Marlowe novels more than once, but that first time I was disappointed. So many characters to keep track of, so many relationships knit together in Author Barbara Lanza has taken some liberties with Chandler's story, but players get to choose for themselves what degree of liberties they will tolerate. The first choice the game offers is between the novel's original plot and an alternate story line cooked up especially for the game. CAPES & CARTRIDGES Hmm...this evidence seems Either way, the first half of the to point equally to guns and comics. Real funny until story unfolds The same way: somebody gets an ice pick in their skull. the honorable but harcboiled detective Marlowe gets a visit gave us RAY BRADBURY'S THE MARTIAN from mousy, nervous Orfamay Quest, CHRONICLES and Isaac Asimov's ROBOT and after some dickering, agrees to help Criy turning these fine works into her find her missing brother Orrin. some of the weakest CD-ROM games Marlowe starts by digging around around you must forgive me for ap Orrin's last known address, a seedy Bay proaching PHILIP MARLOWE, PRIVATE EYE City flophouse, and two of the men he with some trepidation. But wonder of meets there shortly turn up dead with wonders, miracle of miracles, this time ice picks expertly inserted at the base the Preiss is right. of their skulls. Looking askance at GET UP, YOU LOUSY BUM This old drunk was lying there \"like an old Ford with a leaky head gasket.\" Forties-style animation and hardboiled prose help you get into the Chandler ouevre. Important clues Price: $39.95 System Requirements: IBMcompatible 486DX-66 processor, 8 MB RAM, 2 MB hard drive space, Windows 3.1 or better, SVGA graphics, 2x CD-ROM, Windowscompatible sound card, mouse Protection: None (CD must be in drive) Designer: Byron Preiss Multimedia Publisher: Simon & Schuster New York, NY (212) 989-6252 Reader Service #: 320 such a tangled web of deceit, so many archetypal scenes piling up in a kind of nightmare repetition...reading The Little Sister was hard work. It made my head hurt. So, which of Chandler's seven novels does Byron Preiss select to turn into a computer game for Simon & Schuster? The Big Sleep, with its well-known characters and plot? The Lady in the Lake, with its single main setting and satisfying, inexorable denouement? Nope: The Little Sister, the hardest of them all to get into and get out of. Since this is the same developer who FAREWELL, MY LOVELY At first glance you may be forgiven a little trepidation as well: after some nifty 3D animation sets the scene, you will be startled to see the game's characters represented by flat, crude, almost ugly cartoonlike drawings. A gangster looks like his sneer was drawn on with a single swipe of a felt-tip pen. But then the characters start to move, and their movements are fluid and dimensional. They may be flat sketches, but they move as if they were real people. It's a little like the style of art used in the current Adventures of Batman and Robin TV series: deliberately artificial, evoking the style of authentic 1940s cartoons without that period's technical limitations. It takes only a few scenes to grow on you here. 1. The man in the rooming house was bald when you met him, but has hair when you find him dead in the hotel. It's worth a look under his toupee. 2. Don't let the police sirens scare you out of an apartment you've broken into. You usually have time to scan one or two screens before they take you into the station, and even then they just hassle you, 3. When you come to in the doctor's office with a dead body in front of you, though, get out as fast as you can. If the police catch you there, the game's over. CG OCTOBER 1996 "

"REVIEW  PHILIP MARLOWE, PRIVATE EYE self to them, luxuriating in the decadence and charm of Chandler's world. ADVENTURE/RPG Marlowe's fortuitous proximity to two homicides, the police start giving Marlowe their usual hard time. Meanwhile, anonymous phone calls start coming in at Marlowe's office. \"This is a warning, Marlowe,\" they say, the nightmare repetition I mentioned above. Chandler's readers grow accustomed to seeing the same scenes turn up again and again. Marlowe gets knocked out; Marlowe gets drugged; Marlowe gets a visit from two twitchy guys with guns. IMYONTORY ITA AL ST. way 9 Here Ice TV BEEN Dact LOTSA LEGWORK Bein' a P.I. ain't all fists and dames. Make sure to use the files on these goombas-and check back in your casebook. Enough lumps on the head, you might go into the big sleep and forget somethin! \"Back off. Stop nosing around. Keep out of our business!\" Did I mention that Marlowe gets coldcocked at one murder scene by a dame in dark glasses and knocked out at another by a shady doctor with an erotic letter opener and ready access to potassium hydrocyanide? Well, now I have. It's all part of THE LONG GOODBYE You may well ask, however, whether this is a cartoon or a game. Am I watching or am I playing? The answer is that mostly you are watching. The interactivity consists of choosing which scene to watch next by selecting locations from a map of California. When you travel to locations at which no character is present, you get to do some adventure game-style exploration, searching a room for clues before the cops pick you up for breaking and entering (not that the game ends if you're arrested; you're allowed to continue even after your license is revoked). When you run into other characters, you occasionally get to affect the direction a conversation takes by choosing between two alternatives: Do you ask Orfamay about Orrin or about the rest of her family? Do you wake the sleeping hotel manager gently or rudely? This hardly qualifies as adventure gaming, though, and on the whole PHILIP MARLOWE, PRIVATE EYE delivers little for gamers to sink their teeth into. Still, for fans of the Marlowe novels, PRIVATE EYE is a treat, a teeth-rotting little bonbon they'll gobble up. You can keep your trigger finger from getting arthritic by playing QUAKE and your adventure game muscles limber on GABRIEL KNIGHT 2, the fact that PRIVATE EYE is light on game elements shouldn't keep lovers of hardboiled mysteries away from this pleasant and faithful adaptation. Marlowe Mania Marlowe also gets pushed around by the cops, gets warned off his case and visits refined-but-deadly mobsters at nightclubs. Finally, Marlowe cracks wise with hot dames and occasionally gets to lock lips with them as well. Only the names change from book to book It's all there in the game, too, even in the alternate plot line. What you might expect to be tiresome repetition, however, is actually welcome familiarity. Just as readers of Homer cherish cach reference to \"the wine-dark seas,\" readers of Chandler grow to cherish cach coldcocking and every laconic \"There was nothing in that for me, so I let it pass.\" Along with Chandler's scenes, Lanza lifts entire chunks of Chandler's prose verlatim, which is probably the smartest thing she could have done. Take Chandler can't hold a candle to the real thing. And what you get here is usually the real thing, though a bowdlerized version: \"a cheap bastard\" becomes a cheap bum,\" and a pair of stylish glasses is described as \"slinky\" but not as \"cockeyed and oriental.\" The repartee is delicious: The sluttish Dolores Conzales is «as hard to get as a haircut\": tough movie star Mavis Weld is \"So smart (she could talk her way out of a safe deposit box.\" The actors' delivery is good, though Marlowe is a little too nasal and everyone sounds rushed. As long scenes of the oddly compelling animation play out before you, you surrender yourf the seven Marlowe novels, the first is the best starting point. Though its plot is baroque, The Big Sleep has some of the most memorable characters and by far the most staggering final punch to the reader's gut. Playback, Chandler's last novel, is extremely readable. The Lady in the Lake shares that virtue and also gives you a chance to see Marlowe operate in a setting other than his usual urban \"mean streets.\" The High Window is as strong a novel as The Little Sister but also as hard to get into. Farewell, My Lovely is easier, but only if you can get past the casual racism with which Chandler peppers his prose. The masterpiece of the lot is The Long Goodbye, a sobering exploration of loyalty and betrayal, it's the one everyone should read. Robert B. Parker, of Spenser For Hire fame, wrote two authorized Chandler sequels, Poodle Springs and Perchance to Dream. Neither is as good as the originals, but they are better-than-average pastiches. An even better modern heir to Chandler is Lawrence Block, whose novels about ex-cop Matt Scudder are the best hardboiled detective stories since the Marlowe books. For sheer suspense, start with A Ticket To The Boneyard; for a brilliant puzzle, try A Stab In The Dark, or for raw emotional power, read Eight Million Ways To Die. APPEAL: Anyone who longs to hear Marlowe's timeless wisecracks spoken out loud to the accompaniment of saxophones and gunfire. PROS: Authentic Chandler prose and plot twists, presented in a different and ultimately satisfying graphic style. CONS: Not enough of a game-just a little light snooping and a tiny bit of interaction inserted into long scenes of conversation and action. RATED CG OCTOBER 1996 "

"PETER OLAFSON ACTION ELDEUTY2H \"I'll Be Back» The Terminator Returns In Bethesda's SKYNET, m an The Sequel To FUTURE SHOCK SKYNET, ow quickly we forget: Before QUAKE, there was FUTURE SHOCK. This Terminator spinoff was the first of the truc 3D action games and the first game to make me feel sick to my stomach. Of course, it may have been forgotten in the excitement over QUAKE. The follow-up, SKYNET, due in October, is set to bring FUTURE SHOCK back up to speed with its competition. A first look at a late alpha version found the game, while still distinctly a work in progress, rich with potential. Originally planned as a multiplayer patch for FUTURE SHOCK, SkyNer has matured into an eight-mission standalone miniature with an add-on price in the $20 to $30 range) and a raft of new features: SVCA graphics, a multiplayer mode and a range of lesser refinements. And, naturally, a new story-built around SkyNet's plans for a citybusting nuclear missile left over from the last war and the human resistance's plans to thwart it. Once again, you're taking orders from John Connor and crew, and running the dusky grayand-brown gauntlet of post-apocalypse LA on foot, in a jeep or in a hunter/killer aircraft But it's not quite the same. The levels in which FUTURE SHOCK'S 17 missions were carried out were often sprawling horizon tal structures. SKYNET ON under an improved version of the Xngine-a step up from the one used for DACCERFALL that can throw around about 20 percent more polygons. One nice side effect is that the designers have been able to build more complex levels that use vertical space to much better effect MECH MY DAY Some of the biggest enhancements for An outstanding exam SKYNET are beautiful SVGA graphics, a more dimensional ple is the third mission, in philosophy to level design, and meaner robots. which, having found the missile and made your escape, you must the building to activate the clevator, use it locate the Cyberdyne building, make to reach an otherwise-inaccessible area to your way onto its roof from outside the open a door in its cellar, explore said cellar structure, wind your way down through and (pant, pant, pant) make your escape.

However, Mindscape has silenced SILENCERS, an ABUSEesque side-view shooter OCTOBER 1996 16 "


"PETER OLAFSON NOTI)V BIG BANG SKYNET will add multiplayer gaming to FUTURE SHOCK, allowing you to blow up cohorts on foot or from jeeps and airplanes. They've also taken QUAKE's explosionat-the-butcher-shop approach to outrageous violence to the next logical level: comedy. In multiplayer mode, you can blow a rival's head right off its torso, leaving a little red-ringed stump of white vertebrae, and then shoot the head around all while the poor owner is forced to watch from a tumbling point of view. (At press time, there was even some talk of allowing you to put the head through a basketball hoop.) In something of the same spirit, a missile's-eye view has also been incorporated, and it should be delightful to watch your opponents flee in terror at its passage. And while I was playing an early version, which crashed if I looked at it funny, I also noticed that SKYNET is distinctly cleaner, irritating little problems in FUTURE SHOCK, like the inability to properly target enemies at lower elevations, weren't present. IS THE BEST YET TO COME? I can't comment on some of the potentially most promising aspects of the game. I couldn't display the SVCA graphics (I'm told they're much crisper, and that distant objects look better), and the story animation wasn't in place. Bethesda is also trying to include levels of visual damage for certain in-game objects like walls and cars, but that hadn't been implemented yet either. Nor had multivehicle play. In the original game, you couldn't switch between vehicles. In SKYNET's multiplayer mode, you will be able to--and a generous setup screen will allow you to configure the eight multiplayer levels in detail. That means you'll be able to hop in and out of jeeps and fighter planes to mow down your friends in deathmatch. However, I was able to explore some of the multiplayer landscapes: the baked brown hills with a huge, fallen-down HOLLYWOOD sign; a sewer with mucky-sounding footsteps and corridors built for ambush (with a death trap or two); and a nighttime descrt rich in weapons and cover. I can already see the long-distance artillery battles unfolding, a sort of SCORCHED EARTH 3D. Clearly, SKYNET will be worth another visit. If I have any concerns based on this early look, it's that Bethesda is letting its creative eye stray a little too much toward the competition, SKYNET allows you to adopt a third-person view in multiplayer mode. (DUKE NUKEM 3D has an optional third-person view.) In SKYNET's multiplayer mode, you'll be able to destroy catwalks. (Gee, DUKE has destructable catwalks.) One of the new weapons is a ricocheting pipe bomb). (Cee, DUKE las those too.) See my point? A little of this borrowed design could be a good thing. A lot of it risks making the original look like a pretender, and in the year of games that are (or appear to be) truc 3D, that's an important distinction. SKYNET needs to cut a swath of its own. One thing I'd liked to have seen them borrow from DUKE isn't in the offing: a built-in level editor. I'm told that Bethesda's in-house tools are too developer-oriented for general consumption. That's a good reason to tune them upmuch as Bungic has tuned up the Forge design engine for inclusion with MARA\"THON INFINITY. I'd urge Bethesda to rethink its posture or at least make the datafile geometry available to enterprising shareware coders, as id has done with Doom. Editors have given the nearly three-year-old Doom a good extra two years of life, and there's no reason for FUTURE SHOCK not to benefit from the same fountain of levels. But, that said, there's more than cnough new here to keep I'UIURE SHOCK veterans happy for weeks--and even to send them back into the original game with a fresh perspective, as SKYNET will also update FS with the new features. In other words, SKYNET is still a patch. But it's also a full mctal jacket, and a very hip and up-to-date one lo boot, and I can't wait to try it on. I'll be back TIPS! selection halls, take the corridor to the right--the one leading to the off-limits QUAKE'S SECRET NIGHTMARE LEVEL If there's a problem with the shareware edition of Quake, it's that, even at the \"hard\" level, it's far too easy. But have you tried the Nightmare level? Did you even know there was one? (Maybe not-the entrance is hidden in a region you're unlikely to explore.) Pick any of the difficulty-level halls. When you reappear in the episodefourth episode-and drop into the pool at its end. Allow yourself to sink. Before you reach the bottom, swim to one of the three sides closest to the point where you dropped in. That way, when you fall through the pool's false bottom, you'll land on an overhead beam, rather than on the floor below. The exit on the left leads to the corridor that selects Nightmare. Once you exit the teleportation portal at the end of this corridor, you'll be taken back to the episodeselection hall, with the difficulty now ramped up to Nightmare level. ENTER MY NIGHTMARE After you drop down from the pool onto the beam, enter this dark hallway to confront QUAKE's Nightmare level. CG OCTOBER 1996 "

"SNEAK PREVIEW  TOMB RAIDER ACTION She's A Beauty TOMB RAIDER Dazzles With Beautiful Graphics And A Cool Heroine by Peter Olafson CS SNEAK CPREVIEW GAME STILL IN DEVELOPMENT PRETTY The graphics in TOMB RAIDER will take your breath away.

But while the English developers have borrowed ideas from diverse sources-a little ArrD, a bit of PRINCE OF PERSIA and the collected works of Harrison Ford-TOMB RAIDER, due in November, has a feel distinctly its own. This third-person 3D action/adventure game-a huge hit with crowds and critics at last spring's E3 trade show-puts you in control of a sort of \"Indiana Jane\" character, one Lara Croft. She's an adventurer who's contracted with a shrewd businesswoman named Jacqueline Natla to find the three pieces of the ancient Scion, a mysterious artifact whose qualities, at this time, are about as nebulous as its name. On her quest for the lost pieces, Lara will explore four huge worlds, cach with three levels, drawn from civilizations lost to time: an Inca city, a Creco-Roman labyrinth, an Egyptian ruin, and, finally, the Pyramid of Atlantis. The twist in the story, though, is that Natla double-crosses Lara after she has recovered the first piece, so Lara must find the remaining two picces for herself and face Natla's forces in Atlantis, where the conflict between villain and INTO THE RUINS I had a chance to play a pre-alpha version, with early incarnations of three of the levels and the museumlike training ground, the Cym, in which you can try out a wide array of moves without having to watch your back. (If you need to be persuaded of your character's Indiana Jane status, the Arc of the Covenant can be found in this mansion as well.) The gameplay and environment were so good I was hooked. So what's to like? Lots. For starters, it's just nice having a woman in the driver's scat. Sure, it's been done before, typically by Sierra's Roberta Williams, but also typically without pushing women's roles beyond the conventions of literature and film (eg., a princess, a girl detective, a dreamy blonde with a possessed hubloy), and not in this sort of game. TOMB RAIDER could conceivably coax young women into a genre that's typically been exclusively a boy's club. And, to adopt the language of Core's wry synopsis, \"psychologically, a male playing the game will be more involved with a woman character, in some macho protective little farly way.\" Maybe. But Lara's a thoroughly modern, versatile young lady, even if she is made of textured polygons, and she can look after herself very nicely, thank you. She has a high, clear forehead, an enticing shade of lipstick, a mail-order hiker's outfit including a bottomless little backpack with a rotating graphic inveno ry, which seems to hold everything the ancient regimes can throw at her. Lara's biggest asset, though, aside from her firearms, is her Olympic-gymnast constitution. And once the game's ramped up to SVGA, she becomes even more lifelike, her movements more supple and lithe. PHYSICAL EDUCATION You can also tell Lara's been taking her vitamins, because her actions are almost superhuman. When she jumps straight up she almost touches the ceiling. She can also somersault in three cardinal CG OCTOBER 1996 "

"REVIEW  QUAKE NOTI)V DIFFICULTY LEVEL E10 On The Richter Scale QUAKE Pushes Gaming Over The Bleeding Edge Freelook Or Die Download Quake version 1.01 shareware from www.zdnet .com/gaming by V. Long he long-awaited QUAKE is finally here, and already it's a sensation on the Internet and a deep indulgence for action gamers everywhere. I think it's safe to say that the threeyear wait for id's all-new, totally 3D game was worth it. Since I wrote CGW's Sneak Preview of the game (July), a few things have changed and id principal John Romero departed id--but the gameplay didn't change. It's still a towering programming feat that goes beyond immersive to make you feel like you're there in a combat environment. Like its storied predecessors (WOLFENSTEIN 3D, DOOM, HERETIC, HEXEN, et al.), QUAKE is a white-knuckle \"kill or be killed\" splatterfest. You're a muscular, axwielding hero who starts off in a futuristic military installation and teleports via \"slipgales\" into nightmarish places populated with monsters and other vicious creatures The difference is that QUAKE is a true 3D environment, and it promises to tum cyberspace into a raucous DeathMatch playground, A LAKE's awesome, true-3D environment can only be appreciated by using \"mouselook,\" which gives you the ability to look fluidly and intuitively in any direction. It's perfect for glancing up and down, swimming, and hitting opponents on the run. touches, such as deep shadows and dynamic lighting effects, add realisin. Fire a rocket into a passage, and the rocket's glow illuminates the corridor as it travels. Although neither creatures nor players cast shadows, the real-time visuals are nonetheless impressive, even at 320x200 resolution. The only downside to the totally immersive environment is that it takes a Pentium 60 to run it. Price: $50 (shareware version can be downloaded free) System Requirements: IBM-PC compatible Pentium 60; 8 MB RAM (16 MB for Windows 95); MS-DOS 5.0 or Windows 95; VGA graphics; CDROM drive; 80 MB free hard drive space (30 for shareware): supports Sound Blaster and GUS sound cards. # of Players: 1-16 (LAN or Internet) Protection: None Designer: id Software Publisher: id Software Mesquite, TX 1-800-idgames Reader Service #: 319 TOTALLY AND TRULY 3D Life is 3D, and so is QUAKE. Nothing I've seen on a PC beats QUAKE at creating a first-person environment on flat monitors with such bloody, in-your-face immediacy. Not everyone agrees with me some gamers expressed disappointment that QUAKE's graphics didn't surpass Doom the way DOOM surpassed WOLFENSTEIN 3D. Others point to DUKE NUKEM 3D as having more \"innovative\" environments, weapons and level design. But I think both arguments really miss the point: Doom's and Duke's illusion of 3D is so convincing that it's easy to overlook that they are actually 2D cleverly simulating 3D. Everything in QUAKE, in contrast, is polygon-based, mapped with sinister texturcs and rendered in real-time. The architecture is constructed as it is in real life, with rooms above and below and structures spanning open space. To appreciate it, and to survive, you need to take advantage of the game's \"mouselook\" feature, which lets you slew your view as if you were turning your head. This is something no other «3D\" game can touch: It deepens your sense of immersion and affords deadly-fast targeting accuracy. While other \"3D\" games still utilize cardboard-flat sprites, QUAKE puts you in the midst of creatures that move much more smoothly and convincingly and can be viewed from any angle. Various other A DELICIOUS NIGHTMARE Some gamers might go for DUKE's colorful look and irreverent attitude, but I prefer QUAKE's moody atmosphere. The gloomy textures and color palette enhance the spooky atmosphere and combine with the true 3D and scary monsters to make QUAKE all the more nightmarish. The lack of an auto-map feature adds to the impression of being there: GG OCTOBER 1996 "

Few things will put a bigger grin across your face than pouncing on an opponent while you're invisible thanks to the Ring of Shadows. As in Doom, players can engage in DeathMatches via direct cable, modem and IPX local area network connections. QUAKE ups the ante to 16 simultaneous players and adds options to choose colors and assign teams. Id went even further by integrating both dynamic entry, which allows players to join at any time, and TCP/IP connectivity, which permits play over the Internet. As a result, you can drop into any of the hundreds of 24-hour fragfests hosted by fans on the Internet. While some who dial into their ISPs for Internet DeathMatches grumble about lag, it's amazing that it works as well as it does. No other game provides this degree of multiplayer connectivity. With more multiplayer options, such as Capture the Flag, it could've been all the more outstanding Although it's not perfect, QUAKE cxcels at pure pulse-pounding action, and is more fun than I've ever had on a computer. It's the most immersive \"visceral reality\" experience out now. I'm not alone in thinking this: The overwhelming majority of my friends quickly succumbed to QUAKE's addictiveness, particularly after trying DeathMatch and mouselook. The fast-growing pool of playmates, servers and add-ons will ensure that QUAKE stays at the top of my playlist, and the playlists of thousands of other gamers, for a long time. APPEAL: Fans of first-person action shooters seeking the next generation. Everyone else should at least see what the fuss is about. PROS: Pure action shooter, cool 3D architecture and creatures; outstandingly moody atmosphere; multiplayer mayhem second to none. CONS: Requires a muscular Pentium; the noninteractive environment is a letdown after DUKE NUKEM 3D. The soundtrack is lousy compared to Doom's. OCTOBER 1996 "

"ROUNDUP FIGHTING GAMES NOTI)V Four New Fighting Games Battle For The Crown, While Three Others Train For The Next Round by Elliott Chin ive years ago, a silent and powerful martial artist, master of the Shotokan school of karate, arrived on the shores of the United States, claiming to be the best fighter in the world. He was as good as huis word, and more fighters, hearing of his prowess, made the journey to his fighting ground, hoping to challenge this disciplined master and take his mantle of World's Greatest Warrior. That warrior five years ago was Ryu of Capcom's STREET FICHIER II, the now-classic 2D fighting game that created the fighting game craze in the arcades. Not long after STREET FIGHTER II proved that there was a market for fighters, Midway's MORTAL KOMBAT hit the coin-op world, and turned a one-man show into a head-to-head brawl. Over the next two years, numerous fighting games came and went, including a dozen iterations of STREET FIGHTER II, three MORTAL KOMBATS and a slew of copycats. Then, in 1993, a new fighter, with a totally new style, stole the thunder from STREET FIGHTER Il's punch: Sega's VIRTUA FIGHIER. This was the first 3D fighting game, and though it was still fought pretty much in 2D-left to right, the characters, arena and look of the game were all 3D. Since then, several companies have followed Sega's lead into 3D, enriching the battlefield, much to the delight of fighting fans everywhere. While this revolution and one-upmanship was occurring in the arcades, computer gamers could only watch withi envy the combatants duking it out for the favor of fighting fans. The PC couldn't equal the arcades, or even console machines, in graphics power and game controls, which meant that fighting games, which pushed both envelopes, couldn't be converted to the PC. Happily, that's all changing. Today, with Pentium processors outmuscling the 32 bit chips on consoles, and with PC gamepads popping up left and right, the dawn of the PC fighting age has finally arrived. FX FICHIER, and the MORTAL KOMBAT and STREET FIGHTER ports, were only the beginning. Now we've entered Round 2 of this tournament, and four new contenders have stepped into the ring And In This Corner...

The six rightside buttons and the left-right buttons on top are perfectly placed, and the sticky direction pad in particular is nice (it has small indents for the diagonal directions, making diagonal movement easier). Best of all, you can plug up to four gamepads into a Grip multiport, which plugs into the joystick port in your sound card. The GrIP Fighting Machine package is ideal for fighting games since it includes two gamepads (and a bundled game).

However, when trying circular movements, such as one fluid motion from down to down/forward to forward, the rising cardinal bump on the pad sometimes gets in the way. A great feature, though, is that you can daisychain up to four Sidewinder gamepads via a port at the back of the gamepad. This worked perfectly for VIRTUA FICHTER PC, with one gamepad connected to the computer and another gamepad connected to the first. Both responded fine and felt very comfortable. The Sidewinder gamepad will be out in late October. Grade: ACREATIVE LABS BLASTER GAMEPAD The Blaster Camepad is also a nice gamepad and has a switch so it can function as either a gamepad or joystick. As a fighting gamepad, it's not bad, though its design isn't as comforting as the GrIP's or Sidewinders. Still, it has a load of programmable buttons (six on the right, a select-and-start button in front, and two left-right buttons on top). It might be a bit big for smaller hands, but nevertheless functions quite nicely. One plus is that it supports BATTLE ARENA TOSHINDEN, a game that needs all those buttons.

Worse than the silly characters are their fighting styles. In VFPC, characters look like they're really fighting; they employ real fightpogee has thrown its hat into the arena with a new 2D fighting game, XENOPHAGE. It has detailed SVGA graphics that look 3D rendered, but the game really is a side-scrolling 2D game. That's not necessarily bad if you've got the gameplay of STREET FIGHTER II, but in a game like XENOPHACE, it certainly docsn't help. The story here is that representatives from several alien races, including humans, have been spirited away by powerful alien gods. These aliens must fight to the death in a bloody tournament for the amusement of these powerful overseers: The winner gets to live another day; the loser forfeits the life of his entire race. Tivo things will hit you the first time you fire up this game: The characters are, to say the Icast, lame, and the blood and gore in this title are excessive. There are some pretty weird-looking aliens cuking it out here, and the humans don't look at all like they're ready to fight—the lone human female fights in a skirt and blouse. Look at VFPC; real women don't trade blows in office garb. Still, the characters, no matter how strange. are nicely rendered in beautiful SVGA graphics. Of course, since every other fighting game in this roundup is either in stunning SVGA or amazing 3D polygons, being pretty really isn't much of a distinction anydistasteful, among the numerous options Apogee provides is one for tweaking the level of gore, mercifully. XENOPHAGE's gameplay isn't exactly great compared to the amount of time evidently put into graphics and bloody details, the actual gameplay seems to have been overlooked. Sure, you have the usual assortment of special moves, different characters to learn, combos and ending moves reminiscent of the MORTAL KOMBAT fatalities and animalities. Yet, undemeath all that, you won't find much that distinguishes XENOPHAGE from other fighting games. Only the outward shell does that; inside, you have characters that aren't different enough or well-balanced cnough to make you want to try out each character, and much of the fighting seems to be too much like MORTAL KOMBAT: In the end, you have a fighting game that plays more like Rise 2 than VIRTUA FICHIER PC. TAKE THAT XENOPHAGE has some implausible characters (would you fight in high heels and a skirt?) that don't know how to fight, but plenty of blood. ing styles, and when they punch, they throw their bodies into it. In XENOPHACE, the human characters look like they don't know how to fight. Sclena's front kick is an example of such ineptitude. She throws out her leg, with her arms hanging limply by her side. That's not how you fight. What happened to keeping your arms up for protection or following through with your kick? As far as the blood and guts go, this game spews them out in torrents. Even simple slashes from an alien creature spill buckets of blood. Major combos color the entire floor crimson. For the MORTAL KOMBAT Crowd, this is great, but if you find all the gore APPEAL: Fighting fans tired of MORTAL KOMBAT who aren't afraid to play with lots of blood and weird characters. PROS: Nice, big, detailed characters; lots of blood (if you like that sort of thing). CONS: Lame characters; mediocre gameplay; just another MK tripoff.

"CHARLES ARDAI S3122nd ? SISSV1) synthesizer chords on the soundtrack, excessively arty photography. But it's a Potemkin village: Behind the ritzy facade is a paucity that beggars the imagination. In seven practice tests of 20 questions apiece, the same question types turn up again and again. (In all, I estimate that there are only seven or eight distinct types.) Then, when you move from the practice section to the \"real\" test, you find not only the same types of questions but the same questions. Of course, you've crammed on those questions already, so you know all the right answers. For filling them in mechanically, the computer awards you a \"141+\" IQ rating. What Iesson does that teach kids? To fill out the package, BRAINSTORM! also contains a set of audio files about the human brain that sound like those filmstrips they used to show in high school (\"The human brain is the supreme achievement of nature..an average weight of only three pounds...the more we learn, the more we realize how little we know...\") and a catch-all «Mindbusters\" section allegedly containing \"rebuses,\" \"brainteasers,\" and \"puzzles.\" Only one of the \"rebuses\" is an actual rebus; the other nine are what Games magazine used to call Wacky Wordies, and are poor examples of the type at that. (For instance, you see \"forwellmed\" and are supposed to guess \"well informed.\") The Puzzles section contains all of five puzzles of the sort you used to get in math class: A train pulls into a funnel at 50 mph, it's a quarter of a mile long, the tunnel's a mile and a half long, yadda yadda yadda. 'The Brain Teasers section is the most appalling: it contains a grand total of two brain teasers which, in BRAINSTORM! For multiple-choice questions, start by eliminating one or two choices that are obviously wrong. Then, even if you are forced to guess among the remaining choices, you've improved your odds by as much as 13 percent--especially good for speeding through timed tests. When asked to envision a flat shape folded into a cube, eliminate all answers in which adjacent squares on the flat shape turn into opposite faces of the cube. This is impossible.  If you have to select the symbol that doesn't belong out of a set of similarlooking symbols, start by mentally pairing up symbols that are identical to each other either entirely or on a characteristic-by-characteristic basis.

In LEMMINGS PAINTBALL, the latest escapacle from Psygnosis, you'll get to know a few of these cute and cuddly creatures on a more personal level. As in LEMMINCS, the idea of the game is to guide your furry friends safely through an obstacle-ridden landscape before your time runs out. Unlike the original version, in which you were responsible for a whole pack of pests, this time you'll have to care for no more than four lemmings at a time. A squeaky \"Let's Go\" indicates that the vociferous vermin are about to be released from a trap door suspended in mid air From there on, it's up to you. The first few levels start easily enough: You guide a single lemming across a landscape (Pointand-Click 101) to retrieve a flag that signif ies the end of each game. Don't be fooled, though. You'll soon find yourself maneuvering one lemming over a vast neon vista, avoiding watery depths, pools of fire and heated coals, while another lemming searches for levers that operate lifts in order to allow yet another lemming to jump to higher ground. Also look for balloons, which help you d rift over water or fire, trampolines to help you bounce to safety, keys to unlock barriers-and perhaps most importantly, paintballs.

The earliest on-court screens show that the game is going to look almost nothing like its best-selling 2D predecessor, but will be much closer to the Sony Playstation title SHOOT OUT. Considering that SHOOT OUT's the most stunning-looking basketball collection features 46 vintage powerhouses, such as the Jim Brown-fueled 1964 Cleveland Browns. (Hey, remember when they had pro football in Cleveland?) There's also Vince Lombardi's 66 Packers, and great AFL clubs like the '68 Jets led by QB Joe Namath. Of course. Gibrall's site also offers the undefeated 1972 Dolphins, those devastating Steel Curtain defenses, the dominant Joe Montana-cra 49ers, and enough others to ruin your social life for a very long time.

It doesn't necessarily Roach Motel STOP MAKING SENSE Virtually nothing in FRONT PAGE SPORTS BASEBALL PRO '96 works as it should; every module fails under close analysis. Unlike most other baseball sims, FPSBB does not rate players from statistics. Instead, hitters are provided with numerical ratings in contact hitting, speed and power hitting, while pitchers are rated on such attributes as control and proficiency at throwing certain pitches. When you're drafting a player, those attributes are all you see. In spring training, you can allocate different percentages of each player's effort into developing his various attributes. You can thus build a team of ballplayers from the ground up or tweak an existing team to fit your personality. Want to see Ken Griffey, Jr., go for 400? Abandon power hitting and defensive ability development and pour all his training into contact hitting This is a wonderfully entertaining conwe can't list all the bugs in the shipping version of FPSBB 96, because Sierra's own bug list is a three-page singlespaced document. So here's our Top Five: 1. A World Series that only lasts one game. 2. Fielders are sometimes unable to pick up the ball. 3. Players with \"out\"-class injuries are allowed to keep playing. 4. Position players pitch too often. 5. Pitch indicator shows green when pitch is not a strike. CG OCTOBER 1996 "

"REVIEW FRONT PAGE SPORTS BASEBALL PRO '96 Patch Work SPORTS translate into better ballplayers, however, and it's very difficult to determine exactly why. Some players with top-notch ratings simply don't perform well, while those with average ratings end up leading leagues. Ultimately, you have to ignore the ratings and concentrate solely on performance. FPSBB's stats basically leave a lot to be desired. There simply isn't much differentiation between the good and bad players. The best can come from unpredictable places, too. In my first full season, Pittsburgli outfielder Mike Kingery led the league in slugging percentage (.581), hit 25 home runs and was second in on-base percentage. This despite posting a .411 slugging percentage in hitter-friendly Colorado in real-life 1995 and never litting more than nine home runs in a long career. than 40 to 50. Top-rated outfielders, who normally make about three pulouls per game, rarely catch more than 100 fly balls in a complete season. On the pitching side, even the greatest pitcher of this generation, Greg Maddux, is often mediocre, despite having top-notch ratings-including a 100 mph fastball that leaves his real-life 88 mph heater in the dust. The game pays little attention to individual walk and strikcout totals, giving everyone pretty much the same results. Maddux has the best control rating, yet walked more than four batters every ninc innings-vcry near the bottom of the list. A little unpredictability is nice. Complete abandonment of baseball common sense is infuriating. AND SPRING TRAINING OAKLAND TK MAKE . Player 3 50 n the years I've been reviewing and enjoying sports simulation software, I've never seen such a negative reaction to the release of a game as that of FRONT PAGE SPORTS BASEBALL PRO '96. One center of public discussion, the Usenet newsgroup comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.sports, featured missive after missive denouncing Sierra for releasing this product in its original bug-ridden condition. Sierra President Ken Williams, to his credit, threw himself into the discussion. But his comments, which included getting the name of the game wrong, were more troubling than helpful: \"FPS: Baseball 97 (sic) is one of the finest products Sierra has ever shipped and deserves the success it is already seeing,\" Williams wrote. \"There are certainly improvements that we will make in the years ahead, but I am 100 percent confident that essentially all of you who buy this product are going to be VERY pleased.\" Soon after, however, Sierra announced that a major patch would be released in mid August that would attempt to fix the game's most glaring errors. (On August 15th, the day this story went to press, Sierra announced that the patch would be delayed indefinitely.) Twas able to briefly examine version 1.09.1 of the promised patch. It seemed Dynamix programmers listened to user complaints, although I can't be sure how close this patch will be to the \"real\" one. They focused on making the game engine more usable, and while problems remain, the early patch is an improvement. The Swing window that rendered the hitting interface laughable is gone. To help guide batters, pitches within the strike zone are green and pitches outside the strike zone are red. Batting is now an exercise in timing and color recognition. Since you still have to select the location of your swing before the pitch, it makes no sense at all to select any area but the middle of the plate. You're not going to hit anything thrown to the top or bottom of the strike zone, but the simulation is much more generous about awarding contact with a pitch. There are still far too many foul balls, and fielders still drop way too many pop-ups, but dozens of problems have been fixed, including the bug that made runners seriously overrun bases while advancing on a hit. Troubles with simulation accuracy have yet to be addressed, but at least the much-hyped, but previously absent post-season awards are now in the game. However, simulation speed is still slower than a series of Charlie Hough knuckleballs. The beta patch at least makes FPSBB playable, and hopefully a final patch will be in your hands by the time you read this. 11 BA REPOZ F2243-288 elelaldeles GON 0000 PRIME RATES FPSBB eschews a standard statistical model for numerical player ratings in numerous offensive and defensive categories. MOON SHOT To make matters worse, this game grinds through its simulations as if it's trying to calculate the exact parameters of a space flight to Mars. FPSBB takes days to simulate a complete season, whereas most of its competitors can do the same in an hour or less, with much more realistic results. In the best pure simulations, league totals will be fairly close to normal league totals, and the variations among players will show a deviation from average similar to that in real life. In FPSBB, neither is true. FPSBB spends about a hallhour on a Pentium 75 just to churn out the physics of every baseball put in play for a single day. Your hard drive will sound like it's grating cheese, while all you can do is watch television or read a book (I'd recommend Hawthorne's stories, or maybe War and Peace). Yet virtually any other game on the market will give you more interesting numbers in a hundredth of the time. Team management is an equally frustrating endeavor. You Thirty-five-year-old ballplayers don't suddenly post MVP-caliber seasons out of nowhere, especially after leaving the best hitter's park in baseball history. Even aside from Kingery, the numbers produced aren't very baseball-like. All but the wcakest two or three hitters manage more than 10 home runs in a season, but almost no one gets more than 35 to 40. All but the slowest steal at least 10 to 15 bases, but nobody stcals more 444 CG OCTOBER 1996 "

You can customize the look of your team until they're as pretty as you are. batter-pitcher interface, defensive play and player information. You can customize your playing environment by resizing and moving windows. The game allows several levels of pitching, hitting, base-running and fielding, ranging from automatic to impossible to inconceivable. Creating windows is very expensive from a system resources perspective, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the bxatting interface. In real baseball, you have about one-quarter of a second to decide whether to swing, where to swing and how hard to swing a bat. In FPSBB, you can choose the direction and how hard to swing before the pitch is thrown. The pitcher then delivers the ball, and you press a button to begin the swing, timing it to connect with the pitch. Graphically, this is done very well. The pitch arrives quickly, with a realistic flight path. Just as you're ready to swing, however, FPSBB starts to draw a Swing window on the screen, and by the time it's can set lineups and pitching rotations, but when it's left to simulate, FPSBB shows little understanding of the game. Your starters play every game unless injured, and there's no way to designate backups. It's not unusual for a player to be on the roster all 180 days of a season and have three at-bats during that time. Some pitchers get abused as well, repeatedly NO-HITTER All of these complaints could be ignored if Sierra had at least put out a good arcade game. I wish I could say this is the case.

"FRONT PAGE SPORTS BASEBALL PRO '96  REVIEW mates where the ball will touch ground. Wien balls are hit into the outfield, the angle of view renders the main window useless. You need to use a tiny top-view window to guide the fielder dot toward the touchdown dot. If this sounds entertaining, I can suggest some '70s Atari console games you might like. SPORTS product is nothing short of a bug-ridden disaster. Sure, with patches the game may eventually prove to be great, but why should gamers have to put up with that? We don' need no stinkin' patches. After shelling out $45 for a baseball simulation, is it asking too much to be able to play it out of the box without suffering through such atrocities as a one-game World Series? Say it ain't so, Sierra. finished, it's too late to hit the ball. Hitting therefore, requires that you anticipate this window when you begin the swing. There's no opportunity to evaluate the pitch, and you've already determined the placement of your swing FPSBB isn't very generous about granting contact with a thrown ball, either. Most pitches simply can't be hit, no matter how lucky you are with swing placement. It's a pretty interface, but poorly implemented. Unless you instruct the program to throw all pitches to the center of the strike zone, you will frequently suffer entire games without a hit. The fielding interface has been completely changed from FPSBB '94. When contact is made, a fielding window pops up on the screen. Stick-like fielders move after the ball as it's in flight. Despite the advanced physics model used, there's little perspective on the main window. So fielding involves trying to guide the nearest defender to a shrinking circle that estiIF YOU BUILD IT, THEY WILL WAIT (FOR THE PATCH) Aside from the numerous playability problems, FRONT PAGE SPORTS BASEBALL PRO 96 looks terrific. There are carefully textured and detailed representations of every Major League ballpark, and the pitches and batters look great. In a time when game designers release so many titles utterly lacking in inspiration or imagination, it's painful to have to criticize Sierra heavily for a title that promised so much. But despite the designers noblest intentions, the bottom line is this: As released, prematurely, by Sierra, this APPEAL: For those who simply must have every baseball game released. >PROS: Nice graphics, interesting player-attribute model.

How about the best racing game ever? GRAND PRIX II is the official name of the sequel to WORLD CIRCUIT (it's marketed as part of the \"World Circuit Racing Series\"), and for a number of reasons, it's the strongest PC racing title to date. Undoubtedly, that judgment will provoke those who've been feasting on a steady diet of hard-core Papyrus sims and those who prefer the arcade style of racing.

"REVIEW GRAND PRIX II 3)VSS/NOTIVIONIS seen in the PC racing game. With all detail options cranked up, their refleclions are a sight to behold, textures and all. Remember though, it's questionable whether the computer has yet been built that can support all the graphical detail in front and behind you without slowing Furthermore, an entire chassis can and will become airbome in moments of extreme stress, flipping about somewhat unrealistically in what seems to be slow motion before crashing back to carthi. The scenery here is without peer. The pit arca features visible crews for all the teams, hands that come across the screen to clean your windshield (it never really gets dirty), and so on. The landscape and sky have to be seen to be believed, and the barriers and signage look to be straight out of a IV broadcast. AIRBORNE AT SUZUKA The green flag's just dropped, and someone's been a littie overly aggressive. It's common to be able to pick up several spots at the start by sprinting down the sidelines. NED UUS. TUNNEL VISION AT MONACO With graphics at full detail, it's near impossible to run a successful race at under five frames per second, and the current position attests to that fact. BEHIND THE WHEEL The CP II cockpit retains much of the feel of WORLD CIRCUIT, with elements that, although not true to life, are definitely appreciated on a computer monitor. With a quick glance, you can check on suggested gears for upcoming turns, which driver's aids you have tumed on, your current position and lap, car damage and more As fast laps are turned, they are posted across the top of the screen, as are retirees and cars in the pits. Tum workers display green and yellow flags as the situation dictates, and you can jump into a competitor's car to monitor what he's doing. The underwhelming victory celebration is a letdown, but post-race statistics are comprehensive and printable. The short (20-second) and unimaginative replay prcsents more of a problem, simply because occasionally it's incorrect. On one occasion, after having been T-boned and destroyed by another car, my replay showed that I hadn't! As the game lets you pick up again right where the replay ends, 1 miraculously began driving again, unscathed. What was good news for me this time wasn't good news for the CPII the game to a crawl.

In particular, GP Il is an exercise in controlling wheel spin. From the start, where moderate acceleration will keep the tires gripping the track better than a \"foot to the floor\" approach, to sudden braking that might just put you in a fatal skid and opposite lock skids through turns, it's all here. Mastering the beast is difficult, but possible. For starters, you should kill as much of the lovely graphic detail as possible. A smooth frame rate's going to help you more than a view of the pretty clouds. Then you'll want to pick a track and stick with it.

Keep the Ideal Line feature turned on and you'll get a graphic idea of where to enter and leave turns while maintaining maximum speed. Don't try little shortcuts like taking the inside line into a turn-it may look faster, but it rarely is. We could do an entire article on how to best set up your car, but here are a couple of constants to get you started. First, learn and use the Data Logging guide. This is much like the system used by the real-life teams, and that graph will tell you just where you're lagging behind on all track sections. Second, start by fashioning a speed machine. Get that thing moving as fast as it can on the straights, then start detuning it so it handles the turns. This is one thing, getting good with other drivers all around you is even more important.

"TERRY COLEMAN has more depth.\" It certainly is more work than STEEL PANTHERS, I'll grant you; but it's also outdated and clunky, despite Grigsby's ycomanlike efforts at updates. STEEL PANTHERS contains just as many \"Grigsby formulac\" as its storied predecessor, but the complexities of the design are mitigated by the much more userfriendly interface. JRA 2 STRATEGYZ WARGAMES in SHARPENING THE SPEARS What makes this discussion all the more interesting is that the latest design from Incredible Simulations lands squarcly in the middle of the «realism versus playability\" debate. Just calling ZULUWAR! another of those \"last stand\" games cloesn't really do it justice. Much BLOOD & FIRE After a victory (note the skull symbol), Zulu impi will often break formation and go home to celebrate the victory. Don't win your battles too close to home, or the remaining British will burn your kraal (as here) before your units can regain formation. Tips For Zulu War! Once the tide turns against the Zulus, Cteshwayo generally flees like the BATTLEGROUND Series from Talonsoft, Jeff Lapkoffs designs have improved with each new installment DEEND THE ALAMO! was actually real time, which worked nicely to capture the feel of Texan defenders, far too lew in number, trying to cover all the holes in the Alamo's defenses against overwhelming Mexican forces. CUSTER'S LAST COMMAND let you play either \"Yellow Hair\" or Crazy Horse in a traditional turnbased setting. The number of \"what-if\" options, combined with the competent computer opponent to make for lively and fairly balanced play-a nice job, especially considering the controversy of the subject matter. ZULUWARI marks Incredible Simulations' most ambitious design yet. Unlike CUSTER, the scalc of the ZuluBritish conflict can't be confined into a platoon-level game. If you simulate only Rorkes Drift, you lose Islandhwana, for cxample. ZULUWAR! thus takes on the entire campaign, showcasing the Zulu warriors supcrior mobility versus the incredible firepower of the British Army. \"lums are five days each-by contrast, ALAMO! look only 13 days to recreate the entire siege-and two miles per hex, appropriate for the battalion level maneuv ering it simulates. Your task is made all the more difficult by bad weather, disease from the harsh African climate, and an angry army of fierce Zulu warriors, some 50,000 strong If you are too cautious, the Zulu forces will become bold enough to attack British camps; too bold, and you'll return home in disgrace, having lost to a group of savages.\" Even if you find the right march tempo, however, you may find that victory cludes your grasp long enough for the Zulu king, Cteshwayo, to sue for a more favorable peace. When portraying Cteshwayo, you must keep your royal personage away from the insidious British until the gods grant your brave warriors the final victory over the hated foc. Your warriors are fleet of foot, and they have more firearms than the enemy suspects (you may adjust the percentage of Zulus carrying flintlock muskets when setting up the scenario). * LILLI WAR! toward the upper left corner of the map.

In normal combat, the British begin with any machine gun fire, then the two sides exchange rifle fire, and finally meet in hand-to-hand combat. A popular Zulu tactic is to try and ambush the British, where the natives get to fire first, and their superior melee strengths are deadly. The British counter by burning the Zulu kraals, putting the warrior impis out of commission permanently. The fog of war rules require the British to use their cavalry for recon, and keep Chelmsford's columns from getting too cocky. For British players who have memorized ment this requires often leaves little for entrenched camps. To balance a game between a new and veteran player, give the novice the Natal Zulus for extra firepower, but not with the Guerrilla option. STIFF UPPER LIP, WHAT? As British commander Lord Chelmsford, you face a daunting task: to subjugate the native tribes without taking too many casualties-shades of Desert Storm. OCTORFR 1996 "


"TERRY COLEMAN Hurta Different Spear f the historical alternatives available, the best bet for the Zulu player is to opt for the \"Guerrilla\" war, avoiding huge battles in an attempt to frustrate the British. This isn't mere design chrome, but a viable historical altemative-the British were horrified at the prospect. Think about how badly the British fared when facing guerrilla tactics during the Boer War just NB a few years later, against troops nowhere near as ferocious as the Zulus. The \"Hollywood\" scenario is exactly that-about as realistic as slave ships in Ben Hur. But don't let that stop you from having some fun here. This is a good way to get your first win against the Zulus, and it makes for a really short game, regardless of who wins. STRATEGYZWARGAMES PLANET HOLLYWOOD Cteshwayo wouldn't recognize these warriors, but the fanatical charges help sharpen your defensive skills for the real game. the location of the Zulu kraals, just randomize their setup hexes before starting the scenario. There are a lot of nice touches in the design. If, for example, a particular British unit doesn't move its full allowance, whatcver movement points it has remaining are turned into fortification. So if you're force-marching your columns to the limits of their endurance in an attempt to keep up with the Zulus, you won't have a fortified camp to cover your assets when the inevitable counterattack comes. There is a real temptation for the British player to split liis columns in an attempt to pin down the Zulu forces. He often succeeds-at a terrible cost. Similarly, the Zulu player is enticed to go after British forces in headlong assaults before enemy reinforcements arrive There's no magic formula that gives you the \"best\" wiming chances, making ZULUWARI a very replayable game. Also, the game's asymmetric nature helps to keep the outcome in question, often until the last few tums. The Al is stronger than in most wargames, and will try clifferent strategies from game to game. But where ZULUWAR! truly shines is in twoplayer mode, as there are numerous opportunities for feint, manuever, ambush and bludgeon, even in the shorter scenarios. The better you know your opponent's style, the more devious your strategies become. I find myself having to ask: \"Is ZULUWAR! realistic?\" Given its operational scale, the game certainly has a different feel than say, a Civil War or WWII historical epic. \"There's enough favor with the Maxim machine guns, the burning kraals, the Zulu ambushes-but those who want this game to be \"Chelmsford's Last Command\" may want more tactical detail. On the other hand, ZULUWARI is psychologically realistic, because it puts you in the mindset of the military Icaders of the period. In the end, ZULUWAR! is a good example of where wargames are headed these days: well-balanced, tense, and enjoyable, it's a more than passingly historical game that achieves its goals without becoming mired in complexity for its own sake. And for obscure subjects like these, you're going to get a lot more gamers hooked on wargames with ZULUWAR! than you are with a dozen TACOPS, for all the latter's claims of superior \"realism.\" EYE OF THE BEHOLDER Now, as an old guard\" gamer myself, BRIEFINGS >>>>continued from page 263 features some command control restrictions on the Union to provide the proper historical balance, plus a \"what if McClellan woke up\" scenario where the little Napoleon can end the Civil War in a single battle. After Antietam is published, the series returns to the 20th century with BG: SINAI  In a departure for Talonsoft, the upcoming AGE OF SAIL will be real time rather than turn-based It will be interesting to see how the flow of play-you can give orders to formations as well as single ships-compares to Avalon Hill's WOODEN SHIPS & IRON MEN. Expect a sneak preview as soon as the game system is filled out enough for a test sail.  Interactive Magic is happy enough with the success of AMERICAN CIVIL WAR: FROM SUMTER TO APPOMATTOX that they have reached an agreement with Frank Hunter to publish a similar title on the Napoleonic Wars, probably next year. APPEAL: Anyone who wants a fun, playable game on a relatively obscure subject. PROS: Tough computer opponent; unique situation handled simply but fairly realistically; tons of clever \"what-ifs.\" CONS: Because of the operational scale, tactical detail is lost, and Custer/Alamo fans may feel slighted.

"REVIEW CLOSE COMBAT Close Combat Survival Guide STRATEGYZWARGAMES CLIEU lay as the Germans first. Defense is easier and you have fewer units to command. Panzerfausts give German riflemen anti-tank capability. During deployment, you can check a unit's line of sight by pressing the Alt key while selecting the unit. If events are moving too fast, set the game speed to slow or medium. To issue orders, use the keyboard commands: Z = Move, X = Fast Move, C = Fire, V = Smoke, B = Defend and N = Hide When the battle starts, immediately issue a defend command to your entire force to avoid having units act on their own. Use the zoomed out view to minimize map scrolling. On the Jump map, click on the area you want to view and then zoom Use the team monitor at the lower left to give orders. Double-clicking on a unit will select it and center the map on its location. To fire mortars, get the target in sight, single-click on the mortar in the team monitor, press the key and then click on the target. If you've selected an order you've decided not to give, pressing the Esc key will cancel it.

Once you've mastered the tactics and played the campaign to its conclusion from each side, there's little incentive to revisit the game. Its focus is too narrow, its depth too limited and the capability to create custom battles is nonexistent. Still, CLOSE COMBAT is a unique and innovative work that provides multiplayer capability and breaks new ground in realtime wargaming. If Atomic can improve and expand on the concept, the best may be yet to come. deploys your units, but you have the opportunity to reposition them before combat begins. Once the action starts, it doesn't stop until one side's morale fails or both sides become exhausted. Unfortunately, you're allowed no opportunity to give orders prior to combat, which initially can force you to issue frenzied instructions in an effort to avoid pointless casualties There are six unit commands: Move, Move Fast, Fire, Fire Smoke, Defend and Hide. (Strangely, there is no command to cease fire). While this sounds simple, mastering tactics in the bocage (hedgerows) and on the streets of Saint-Lo is anything but easy. The artificial intelligence is quite good at infantry tactics, but less impressive at using annored vehicles. At battle's end, each side receives a score based on the number of casualties inflicted, objectives taken and vehicles and guns destroyed. You can also view a detailed breakdown of how cach man performed during combat, and you can save a replay of the battle. Tivoplayer network play is supported through a TCP/IP connection, enabling play on a LAN or via the Internet. Direct modem-tomodern connections are not supported actual performance by attempting to advance ahead of the historical timeline The Germans try to put the Americans as far behind schedule as possible. Some players might be put off by the game's use of «dynamic play balancing,\" which is intended to keep one side from gaining so great an advantage that they easily breeze through a campaign. In theory, the idea has merit, but in practice, it has the effect of penalizing success and excusing failure CLOSE COMBAT is a good game, but it could have been better. Some will find gameplay extremely frustrating, not because the game is tough to lear, but because the best techniques for giving orders and moving around the map are largely ignored in the manual (see sidebar). These omissions, combined with the real-time system, slow map scrolling and ciclayed responses to mouse clicks, make the game seem more difficult than it is and more frustrating than it should be. Microsoft shot itself in the foot by failing to provide adequate documentation on how to best play the game. Of course, you could plunk down $16.95 for the Microsoft strategy guide advertised in the manual. CLOSE COMBAT is unmatched in its ability to provide a realistic and challenging experience from the perspective of a World War II infantry licutenant. However, the APPEAL: Players seeking a realis. tic, challenging real-time simulation of highly tactical World War II infantry and armor combat. PROS: The graphics, sounds and combat model make CLOSE COMBAT an outstanding \"you are there\" real-time simulation. The artificial intelligence is generally strong and realistic tactics are required for success. Twoplayer network play is also provided. >CONS: Sometimes sluggish performance, even on high-end Pentium sys. tems. Lacks documentation on keyboard commands and shortcuts, has no scenarioediting capability and its focus is too narrow.

"REVIEW  CYBERJUDAS The Path To The Oval Office STRATEGY / WARGAMES ondering how to be a successful president? A good rule of thumb is to start small and work your way up. For instance, if you wish to depose the government of, say, Libya, don't immediately foster a coup d'etat, as your probability of success will be low. U.S. UT JUAR TOTAL INCOMES OSE PAD BOLLA mo PRASOMAL 15.6 CORPORATE INCOHE SPEHOTNE $1.au 5-103 Instead, spend a few months destabilizing the government and the economy, then have the CIA place a strategic phone call to a general or two. Likewise, if you wish to build your social and economic ties to an allied or neutral country, begin with a low-risk option such as a cultural exchange, then gradually increase aid (if needed) while launching more ambitious initiatives. Of course, there will be exceptions to any rule. Getting your budget on track and making the U.S. economy grow at better than the usual 2 to 3 percent is crucial to your overall success. For one thing, lower taxes, high growth and a balanced budget will do wonders for your popularity. Also, having extra cash for massive foreign aid projects or increased military spending can make a big difference in the success of your foreign policy. My usual plan for economic arowth involves balancing the budget through military cutbacks and tax increases in the first days of my presidency. Follow up immediately with a global freetrade initiative. This may cost you a few popularity points, but the election is a long way away, and the resulting economic gains should allow you at least two years of very high growth and significant tax cuts, with money left over. Once the U.S. economy starts to grow fast enough to produce a surplus, channel some money into infrastructure investment, which will, in turn, create even higher growth. $ in lions TOTAL SPENDING PENSE 201 CMP Growth Prodeeta.. 2.1% Popularitu Preset:: $0.00 INVESTMENT ress. FORHIAN AND IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID Money equals success, so make sure you encourage improved relations with powerful economic nations like Japan and Germany. As a result, the Cyberjudas scenario opens up new menus and options: You not only counter the traitor's intemational policy, but also conduct your own intemal investigation to root out the Jucas. The scenario plays through three phases, cach with its own Judas. So even when you catch the first traitor, you don't have a \"clean\" cabinet There are ways to root out the traitor, though. You may burgle his/her office, try to break his/her computer passcode, and launch various other underhanded tricks in pursuit of truth, justice and an election vic tory. Once you have a suspect in mind, you can take action against the traitor-but be carcful, some advisors have tremendous prestige and power and may not be casily removed. Could Ford have fired Kissinger? There are a variety of ways you can undermine the authority of your own cabinet, wlrich hopefully should cut the culprit down to size. Still, even with traitors crawling all over the White House, I have to question the designer's decision to use this particular strategy to liven up the geopolitical model. Wouldn't it have been easier to provide different world power balances, thus giving the Unites States a few truly extemal enemies? While I wouldn't want to be the guy who had to reprogram the entire database for the 1960s, thus reincamating the cold war, surely it wouldn't have been difficult to posita resurgent Germany, Russia or China? My disappointment is duc, in part, to the strength of the game's modeling of world affairs, and how the U.S. affects them. Not only is a full range of options available, but the best results often come from patient, well-planned strategies that require fairly claborate sequences of initiatives, as in real lifc. Conversely, rasl military operations are punished fairly heavily, and the armed forces really do become a tool of last resort. Perhaps this is just a personal quibble, but having so many neat loys seems a waste in such a dull sandbox. Still, whenever a local crisis does erupt, an adventurous president can easily make the world more lively and challenging by setting very ambitious goals and pursuing them aggressively A further criticism I have concems the lack of victory conditions or a scoring system. True, one must get re-elected (or in the case of truly troubled administrations, avoid coups and assassination attempts), but it would be nice to have an additional yardstick against which one could measure cach game. (Of course, when playing the CYBERJUDAS scenario, the goal is to catch the traitor, but even here it would be useful and entertaining to have a Civ-like scoring system based on the state of the world at the end of the game.) Ultimately, these are but minor complaints. On the whole, CYBERJUDAS delivers what it promises, a detailed and relatively accurate simulation of world politics, with some espionage and backstabbing thrown in to keep the pace moving. APPEAL: For those who'd like to experience the presidency first-hand, students of political science, and Bob Dole. PROS: Highly detailed simulation of geopolitics. The Judas scenario adds suspense and deepens the game. CONS: May be too complex for some gamers; not for the impatient. Benign post-cold war milieu lacks strategic intrigue. CG OCTOBER 1996 "

Unfortunately, your old enemy, the Cybrids, and their giant robot fighting machines, though defeated on Earth, seem to be thriving in the depths of space. You are a military commander in some sort of corporale army composed of Hercs, the human answer to the Cybrid's war machines, and you are basically out there protecting mining interests while beating on the Cybrids. Another major premise change here is that instead of noble humans mamming these machines, you get to breed artificial life forms called BioDerms, which are specially designed to link with Hercs and fight more effectively than any mere human could. You are expected to fight your way through four different star systems, having to destroy the main Cybrid base in each system before moving on to the next. Each group of worlds offers more exotic conditions and more ferocious resistance to the company presence, until you finally destroy the Cybrid home world. Since you are a company man, every thing costs money, which you earn from taking on missions in between your crusades to save humanity from digitization.

The proper base-cracking force will consist of three or four of the heaviest Hercs available, with a string of next-best models strung alongside and two or three light scout Hercs to give you long-range vision and targeting. All Cybrid main bases consist of two parts: a horde of Mechs and a withering array of turret defenses. Victory will always go to the commander who separates these two components and destroys them independently. Advance slowly in a bunched line and draw the defenders to you, where you can concentrate firepower on them without coming under the guns of the static defenses. If you come under withering beam weapon fire from out of sensor range, you're probably too close and should back up until the mobile defenders are NO HUMANS ALLOWED Though you are supposed to breed artificial BioDerms to pilot your Mechs, all you are doing is buying people and jacking up their stats with money. it could have been so much more. Initially, it seems as if it's finally going to be the mech Wargame that we have been waiting for -but when you get down to it, it's all just endless fights on endless worlds against endless Cybrids, who fight mainly the same way, in the same machines. I'm afraid what you have here is yet another SFVOID (varies only in degree) title. It never changes, really; you just end up doing the same thing against more and more enemies. The different mission types, though they seem initially to have different aims and require different styles, almost all boil down to the same thing: \"Kill off all the Cybrids as quickly as possible.» The tactical subtlety is pretty limited, and it's hard even to get away from the \"biggest is best\" strategy of Herc force construction. The campaign game is particularly clisappointing. You never quite get the feeling you are stuck between warfare and capitalism, much less that what you are doing matters. Every once in awhile there seems to be some sort of plot update, but it never really effects on the game, even though you keep hoping it might spark with regard to style and universe with plot elements that never seem to alter the actual battles, and the tedious elements of this game rise to the surface quickly enough that gamers are left with 20 to 40 hours of competent but repetitive SF tactical wargaming and a fun network game for Mech enthusiasts. The game's most grievous offense, however, is the lack of a paper manual. Online help files are great supplements to a rule book, but it was a fatal mistake to try this \"no-paper\" stunt with a wargame where tables and charts, which you can leaf through in your off moments in the bathroom, are so important. The lack of a real manual undermines Cyberstorm's potential considerably. I was hoping this would be the great robot wargaine we'd like to see. It isn't. Instead, it's just an interesting prototype. HEAVY METAL When taking out the Cybrid bases, have a line of heavy Hercs, to punch through enemy Cybrids and artillery batteries, and light Hercs for scouting. mostly destroyed. For the first base, make sure you have a couple of large Hercs equipped with nothing but the most powerful beam weapons; these will act as anti-Herc batteries to destroy incoming suicide-robots. Once the Cybrids are down, rush the turrets in a concentrated wedge from one side of the base to another, and victory is yours with minimal losses. The only other things you need to keep in mind are these: shields forward, use what terrain there is, and crouch your Hercs at the end of their turns. APPEAL: This combat strategy game is for fans of quick, easy and light Battletech-style tactical robot bashing. PROS: Extra CD for instant multiplayer gaming, pretty graphics, the only robot wargame in town. CONS: Lack of a manual; repetitive missions; not much challenge to winning.

Next month we'll provide defensive strategies for thwarting invasions. 1. First, use Gnomish flying machines to uncover the map and find out where the Orc camps are, how many troops they have, how the camps are laid out, and where the towers are. Then, keep the flying machines close to the Orc villages so you can monitor Orcish activity and watch your own troops when you move in. Flying machines stationed beyond your borders also give you advance warning of incoming enemy units. If you have the magic, tory without detection. The paladin's holy vision spell is also good for recon. 2. After you've scouted the enemy camp, take out the towers. Use Dwarven demolition squads to destroy those towers at the edge of the enemy camp. Make sure, though, that you have flying machines scouting the path that the Dwarves will be taking. If there are troops in the way, eliminate them, and then send in the Dwarves. Against those towers protected by walls or located in the middle of the camp, use ballistas. Make sure that you escort them with a force of footmen or gryphons though, because they have weak armor. Ballistas are most effective when you double (or triple) them up, as a group will be able to destroy a tower instantly. 3. Mages with blizzard spells are also good for decimating towers or Orc troops. Just make ICE STORM A devastating tactic in camp invasion is to have a line of footmen stand ground with several mages behind them.

Destroy it quickly (be wary of the towers), and build your first camp here. peppering it with many guard towers to protect against dragons. Then send a force of peasants, clves and footmen south to find the second gold mine, which is guarded by a daemon. Destroy it with the elves and build a second camp. Set up guard and cannon towers near this second gold mine to kill incoming peons, as another Orc nation will be trying to use this gold mine as well. After you've built a large (20to 30-man) army, move in an are cast and then north to take out the other Orcs. In Scenario 5, move south to destroy the small Ore village there and build your own camp. While building your town hall, gather your knights, footmen, elves and ballista into a nine-strong party. Send this group castward along the southern coastline. Once you find the two towers guarding entry into the Bleeding Hollow Orc camp (orange), have your ballista take out the towers from afar.

SCENARIO 5 Scenario 6 is incredibly difficult, but there are two means of winning. You can load up all troops into your transports and send them, along with the warships, southcast to Bleeding Hollow Clan (orange) immediately. Make sure you use your warships to clear the shore of any towers and ships before unloading your troops at the northern shore of Bleeding Hollow. Then, using the base-cracking tactics in the sidebar, decimate the camp quickly. Every orange-colored building, including the Bleeding Hollow oil platform, must be sure you guard them with gryphons or a line of footmen. The good thing about gryphons is that all ground units, except for trolls, will actually turn tail and run from a gryphon, so they won't even touch your mage. 4. After the towers, you will have to deal with any death Knights the enemy has. You can either cast invisibility on a paladin and send him deep into enemy territory to exorcise a death Knight, or if you have enough mages, send in a group of three or four invisible footmen to do the dirty work. Keep in mind that death Knights can still detect invisible paladins. You can also simply rush a death Knight with your footmen once he has exhausted his spells. 5. The actual invasion force should consist of at least two nine-unit waves, half of which should be composed of footmen and knights for the heavy-duty melee, with the majority of the other half consisting of archers for support and several mages for special attacks. Take out enemy barracks first, then kill all the peons, and afterward, move to the Orc stronghold. If the camp has towers deep within, take along at least two ballistas with their own dedicated footman escort. Never group Dwarves with your attack formation; if they explode next to your troops, they'll take them out too. You'll be in good shape if you attack with at least numerical parity, upgraded troops, and units grouped together to attack single Orc units one by one. 6. Gryphons are great for taking out cannon towers, buildings, ships and ground units, but have them attack targets away from your main force because their thunderbolts will also harm nearby friendly units. 7. If you're invading coastal camps, use Gnomish submarines to take out any Orcish ships lying near shore, unless they are within watch of a tower. In that case, use gryphons or battleships to destroy these vessels and any cannon towers on shore. Warships can also be used to bombard and clear the shore before you unload your troops. 8. Lastly, keep in mind three crucial things First, upgrade your stronghold and units as quickly as possible. Second, don't stay on the defensive too long, because the longer you wait, the more entrenched the computer enemy will become. Strike as soon as you've amassed a large army. Third, if your first wave doesn't do the job, keep cranking out the troops; victory takes time. OCTOBER 1996 "

Take it when needed, though you'll have to clear the island of trees before you have space to build a town hall. With all your gold mines secured, start cranking on the war production. From there, it's a matter of whittling the enemy Orcs down with Cryphon harassment, submarine attacks and then a fullscale invasion of the other two Ore camps far south. In Scenario 9, first travel eastward toward the Bonechewer clan (green) with all your troops, except for two footmen. Do not attack the town, but instead go slightly north of it, skirting the Bonechewer towers, to free the prisoners in a walled prison north of the camp. Use the ballista you freed to take out the Bonechewer towers, and then take the settlement. When you send your troops to do this, also have your peasants build just a town hall and lumber mill at the first gold mine you passed on the way east, which is located at the bottom middle of the map. Then surround this compound with farms and guard towers. Use this location only as a gold depot. The Bonechewer camp should be your true base.

Have your battleship destroy the single tower guarding passage into the camp, and then unload your troops from your transport at the forest opening. There are two towers inside the camp, so send your two dwarves to destroy them. Have your troops move in to take out the settlement, and then raise your own camp.

SCENARIO 10 SCENARIO 11 destroy those. As soon as you clear away the towers and destroy the camp, send in two peasants to set up a camp here. Build lots of towers first though, preferably four or five, because dragons and the remnants of the horde will come to attack occasionally.

"HALL OF FAME elcome to the Cooperstown of Computer Games. Here, raised upon pedestals, you'll find the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for untold hours. HIGHLIGHTS CHESSMASTER Mindscape/Software Toolworks, 1986 he only chess program in the CGW Hall of Fame, CHESSMASTER is the Cadillac of castling. Every game in the series has improved upon the design, adding new features without sacrificing what has made the line so success ful. Recent additions include advice given in digitized speech, SVGA graphics and improved sound support. For the chess enthusiast, the myriad of classic games, the easy-to-use interface and variety of chess problems provide entertainment for players of all skill levels. The current version, CHESSMASTER 5000 (see September 96 issue), offers over five dozen opponents, many based on great chess grandmasters throughout the ages. From the classic attacks of Boris Spassky and Garry Kasparov to the tough defense of Anatoly Karpov to the near-effortless mobility of 19th-century American champion Paul Morphy, all the portrayals are unique (each GM opponent even employs the appropri ate historical opening repertoire), giving the gamer a steady stream of fresh opponents. When you toss in the multimedia chess tour, the archives of great tourna. ments and classic chess matchups, it's hard to find fault with the CHESSMASTER series-whether you're interested in exploiting backward pawns, launching queenside majority attacks, or just playing an enjoyable and challenging game of chess. CHESSMASTER truly deserves its status as the Game of Kings. DAY OF THE TENTACLE LucasArts, 1993 hen the zany team of Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer created the script for DAY OF THE TENTACLE, they had one goal in mind-to L create the interactive equivalent of a Chuck Jones cartoon. They succeeded so well in their mixture of crazy dialogue and offbeat sight gags that by the time they showed DAY OF THE TENTACLE to their idol (Jones is arguably the king of the classic Warner Brothers cartoon directors), he was impressed enough to try to hire artists Peter Chan and Larry Ahern out from under the project. Fortunately, the artists stayed aboard; the animation team created smooth-flowing sequences that some game designers had always said could not be done; Richard Saunders (WKRP In Cincinnati's Les Nesman) led the voiceover actors in a series of clever performances, and the script from Grossman and Schafer kept gamers full of both challenge and laughter from start to finish. DAY OF THE TENTACLE was supposed to be a sequel to MANIAC MANSION, Lucasfilm Games' first game as publisher instead of developer. DOTT even used the same set of tools as MANIAC MANSION, the SCUMM engine (for Story Creation Utility for MANIAC MANSION), but today DAY OF THE TENTACLE is better known and better loved than the game that spawned LucasArts' successful string of graphic adventure games.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what (hwot What's The IMEI Deal With.. man Net Games? much the same way that the first graphic adventures made text-based games obsolete nearly overnight. But to be honest, the Froggie title I am most looking forward to is THE INDESTRUCTIBLES, a networkable, firstperson view superhero game, which promises to be the ultimate t's hard to believe that just a short couple of years have passed since I started griping about the lack of multiplayer games. There are enough con nectable titles now that I can start getting picky about them. In the beginning, it was enough just to be able to battle other human beings in strategic or action venues, a much-needed alternative to the shoddy state of computer opponents. Unfortunately, I think too many designers have become fixated on the \"Deathmatch\" aspect of some action games. These are almost always fun, but many games are not detailed enough to keep this activity interesting for any length of time-though legions of psychotic Nukem and QUAKE warriors tend to prove me wrong by knocking each other around night after night on the Internet. RISE OF THE TRIAD did an excellent job of providing special levels for grudge matches, but no matter how ornate they were, without any tar gets other than a handful of human players, they got boring. Just calculating the body count ceases to satisfy after a while. Even hard-core gamers often desire purpose, objectives and accomplishment within their virtual worlds. Strategy game designers seem to have caught on to this idea, and COMMAND & CONQUER, WARCRAFT II and CivNet all allow you to mix human and computer opponents, with varying degrees of success. The real issue is whether designers make networking an organic part of their games-or whether they try to tack it on at the end as a gimmick, or more innocently, leave it until the end of the programming period, in case they are behind schedule and need to drop an \"option.\" While I was happy enough to accept these last two sce narios during the birthing years of net gaming, I think the time has come to be a little more discerning. I would really like to see the end of that little note on boxes saying that the net or modem capability advertised isn't quite ready, and if you'll just send in your registration card, they'll have it for you in a month or so. ZEPHYR and WARHAMMER: SHADOW OF THE HORNED Rat might both have been received better by the market if multiplayer capabilities had been integral to their designs. The two companies that seem to understand gamers' desire for more variety in multiplayer play are Bullfrog and Blizzard, both of which seem to have a solid commitment to creating games with the social aspect incorpo. rated from the ground up. On the action/combat front, if Bullfrog is suc cessful in bringing together two very ambitious designs, they will at the very least put themselves firmly in the fore front of the industry-and possibly score an upset against those id kids. DUNGEONKEEPER could revolutionize the whole multiuser dungeon scene, in CC The best multiplay games are those where network play is integral to their design. in which human opponents are part of the initial design concept. Their WARCRAFT2 is a real treat to play, and a worthy technological successor to the original WARCRAFT (a game limited only by the fact it was restricted to head-to-head play). It may well be that DIABLO will open up multiplayer fantasy gaming to an even greater degree. Right now, the industry seems to be on the cusp, and is evolving into a more dynamic, popular form of social entertainment, with many developers taking advantage of Windows 95's built-in networking and the Internet itself. Unfortunately, there is also a drive to get the most gimmick for the buck, and multiplayer capacity is still lumped in with features like SVGA-rendered backdrops and exploding body parts and tacked on at the end of prod uct development, if there's still time in the fiscal quarter. If computer gaming is to become a truly social activity, gamers (and reviewers, for that mat. ter), need to demand more challenging variety in play, as well as rich, dynamic universes where our virtual entities can make a real difference. It's no longer enough to accept the same old games tarted up with some lastminute bells and whistles. in Champions-esque software titles. I can't think of a game with longer legs than one that will let you design your o wn superhero and wander about a dynamic urban environment, knocking bad guys through walls or whacking friends around with broken-off telephone poles. Just think of all the Hulk vs. Superman arguments to be solved!
