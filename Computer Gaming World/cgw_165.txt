"JOHNNY WILSON edito Play! What Is It Good For? on tes Why We Shouldn't Be Ashamed of Playing Games spending so much time at \"silly\" games-here's an attempt to elucidate why people play games. You might want to make copies and pass it on to any peer or authority figure who's afraid that you're too caught up in game worlds and not enough in this world. Why do people play? At first glance, it's simple. People play for exhilaration, accomplishment, and escape. They play to get away from ecently, I made several television and radio appear. ances with regard to our Holiday Hot 100 shopping guide. As always when dealing with journalists outside the gaming arena, I was struck by two misperceptions about gaming. First, that gaming is primarily for kids. Second, that it's a silly waste of time. Whenever possible, I try to dispel such notions. With regard to the first misperception, the demo graphics in the survey I shared with you in the January issue certainly assert that computer games are not primarily for kids. As for the second point, I point out the positive aspects of play. Play is more than the adrenaline rush we so often refer to in a game's \"fun\" factor, but without that fun factor, we wouldn't keep coming back to a game. Play is more than the rules for procedure scoring, and victory that comprise a game, but as Paul Newman's Butch Cassidy so eloquently put it punctuating his assertion with a kick to an opponent's groin, \"Ya' gotta have rules!\" So, just in case you get the same patronizing looks I get when you mention playing computer games-or in case you need spousal or parental approval for ( I suggest that human play is even more useful than play among animals. provide catharsis, establish prestige within a limited circle, and cre ate overarching structures of ideas and approaches (sometimes called paradigms) that can be applied to problem-solving in multiple real-life situations. In my April 1994 editorial (\"Toward A Gamer's Liberation Movement\"), I quoted a passage from a Humanities professor at the University of Minnesota (Ralph Ross, Symbols & Civilization), who con tended that art \"offers syntheses of types of experience...yielding possi ble frameworks in which we can organize the fragmentary bits and pieces of our ordinary lives so that they are related and significant.\" still believe that gaming is an art form that accomplishes this. Gaming is structured play that allows the gamer to assume the perspective of a member of anoth er class or race, a personage from history, a command persona, another sex, another profession, or another belief system. It allows us to earn prestige by accomplishment and, whenever a game is reset, allows us to compete on a level playing field. By letting us accomplish feats and solve prob. lems that we might never face in real life, gaming gives us a vicari ous sense of worth and a bit of emotional catharsis-a chance to feel good, perhaps reborn. Nearly every game enables us to improve our organizational and planning skills. In addition, every style of game has its particular forte. Role-playing and adventure allow us to examine other lifestyles. Strategy allows us to expend and amass resources (whether they be troops, food, gold, magic points, or reputation). Action games allow us to hone reflexes, recognize patterns, and memorize intricate moves. Simulations allow us to participate vicariously in and appreciate situations that are too restricted, dangerous, or expensive for most people to experience in real life. Yet, all of these game styles and differing perspectives work together to challenge and teach us. Games are \"What if?\" scenarios that broaden our perspectives significantly as they entertain. Imagine an entrepreneur who started a business with out \"playing with business plans on a spreadsheet. That's not some. one I'd want to invest in. Imagine a general who didn't \"play\" possible scenarios before conceiving a battle plan. That's not someone I'd want giving me orders. Play is a vital part of real life. That's not something I'd want to give up. life. They play to experience more from life. Yet, is that all there is to the appeal of play? Animals participate in play in order to sharpen their survival skills, develop innale talents, and establish informal pecking orders. Is human play any less useful? I suggest that human play is even more useful than play among animals. Play among animals can develop stealth, reflexes, and pattern recognition. Play among humans can do that, as well as APRIL 1998 CGW "

"The #1 Computer Game Magazine LETTERS computer Gaming World Death of the Dream I agree wholeheartedly with Johnny Wilson's editorial «Death of the Dream» (CGW11163, February '98), but I think you're wrong as to the cause. It's not the pursuit of short-term profits that is the cause of the poor quality in the industry. The root cause is that the majority of managers in the bi are just as incompetent in the gaming field as in any other industry.

With the present dominance by the 3Dfx Voodoo chipsct in the 3D-accelerated PC game market, I fail to see the logic of introducing new 3D cards with non-3Dfx chips. I have a Rendition V1000 card and am fed up that I have no access to such notable games as NBA LIVE: 98, EXTREME ASSAULT and HEXEN II. It doesn't mean crap i the new Rendition V2200 or RIVA 128 can do this or that, if it is not supported by PC game makers! I have nothing against 3Dfx, I just have to kick myself for buying the \"wrong» 3D card. PC game makers who support only one chipset should realize that they are losing potential I just finished reading Johnny Wilson's editorial (\"Death of the Dream\"), and I had just one thing to say: Amen! As the QA manager for GTE Interactive, I was constantly fighting with management over the release date of TIMELAPSE. Sales and marketing had set a release date without so much as a \"What do you think?\" to me. When I confronted them! was told that it had to be in the storcs before Christmas, so I would have to make do. My testers and I put in a lot of overtime on bug lunts, but either the fixes didn't happen fast enough or one lix caused three more problems. The upper management upgraded TIMELAPSE from alpha to beta to gold master over my protest. At the end of the six-month testing period, we still clid not have a stable game. I again asked that we delay the release date, only to be told that if there were still bugs, \"We can always send out patches later.\" A lot of good people put in a lot of hard work on TIMELAPSE. Unfortunately a few short-sighted executives were more concerned with the bottom line than the long-term survival of our company or putting out a quality product. As you said, if you take the time to do it right you will have a winner, but when you rush your game out the door in the quest for the last buck, people will not return to buy your next piece of trash. I just want you to know from someone who's been there that you hit the nail on the head.

"LETTERS ZIFF-DAVIS INC Chairman and CEO oc Hippeau Chief Financial Officer Timothy O'Brien customers. I, for one, recently dumped the idca of getting the three above-nentioned games, because I discovered they do not support the Rendition chip. Intergraph and Creative Labs (which previously used the Rendition V1000) have since abandoned Rendition in favor of the new 3Dfx Voodoo chip for their latest 3D cards. Which begs the question, \"Am I stuck with a Betamax now that VHS is king? Ashley Tan Singapore To help cut through some of the confusion, we've now added an entry called «3D Support\" to our system requirements information for every game reviewed. We'll let you know which 3D standards the game supports: Direct3D, OpenGL, 3DA, PowerVR or Rendition. Also check out this month's feature concerning all things 3D, in which we further clarify which games will run on which platform. Presidents ZD Publishing Claude P.

Not revealing her identity is kind of cute, but allowing her to write reviews that are not rated is growing tiresome.

Miller Senior Vice President Nancy Newman Vice Presidents Technical Editor Dave Salvator responds: The ongoing 3D standards belching contest has created a tremendous amount of confusion in the market. The roots of the problem have been part technical and part religious 3Dx enjoys a superior position right now, due in part to ils excellent performance, but more so because of its proprietary Clide API, a development tool that allows programmers to make their games \"talk\" directly to 3Dhx's hardware. Because Clide is specific to 3Dkx's hardware, developers know that it's going to work, and they know what level of performance they can expect at run-time. This combination makes 3Dfx and Glide very appealing to developers. With Microsoft's Direct3D API, which is a non-chip-specific API, developers don't necessarily know what level of performance to expect, and not all of Direct3D's features have worked correct ly in the past. In the world of 3D accelerators, there are Ferraris and then there are Yugos, and all of them can accelerate or, in some cases, decelerate, Direct3D. To further complicate matters, Direct3D is a Microsoft product, which inspires acrimony among some developers. Are you now the proud owner of a Betamax? Depends on what kind of games you want to play. It's true that 3DEX Iras amassed an impressive library of game titles that will run only on its hardware. But take heart. There are still a good number of titles, both shipping and forthcoming that will use Direct3D and will run on your Rendition chip We agree. Scorpia resisted game ratings because she believes it isn't fair to developers or readers, and makes it tempting to skip the review. The result, ironically, was exactly what she was trying to avoid. Without a rating, her reviews were relegated to the back of the magazine, which was a disservice to the games, and it decreased her readership Beginning this month, Scorpia's reviews will be true reviews with ratings Bob Bader John Dodge Kathleen Goodwin Roger Herrmann Jonathan Lane Eric Lundquist Jim Manning Charles Mast James F.

CROFT: Listen, wanker. One more comment about my breasts and I'll show you some of those moves right now. Just as soon as I remember the combo. Who changed this blasted interface, anyway? Prima donna designers can't leave anything alone! t's been a long time since we've seen Lara Croft playing on our hard drives. Once the darling of the computer gaming world, Lara somehow lost her sense of proportion a few decades ago. After a 40-year absence from the digital dungeons, she's trying to make a comeback with her self-funded TOMB RAIDER 2050. CGW caught up with England's polygonally encumbered ex-cover-cutie to find out what she'd been up to for all those years. CGW: So, you're trying to make a comeback. (Yawn.) How does it feel to be back after all these years? CROFT: It feels great. (Exhaling a volcanic plume of smoke.) I'm finally getting back to my roots. I took great pleasure in deflowering all those computer gaming geeks so many years ago. Unfortunately, when the next big thing came along, they deserted mewas thrown in the closet with the baseball bats and Star Wars cards. Yeah, I saw all those fickle gamers going gaga over every little tramp that bounced onto their screens, but I wasn't worried; I knew they'd come back. Well, get ready 'cause mommy's coming home again! CGW: Aren't you a little old to make a comeback? CROFT: Bugger off, you cheeky wanker! Maybe I'm not as spry as I used to be, but I still ooze more sex-appeal from my arse than these new little sluts... CGW: Now, let's be civil. CROFT: Alright, I'll be honest with you. I saw the DEATHTRAP DUNGEON XXI disc, starring that little tramp Red Lotus, and I decided, 'Hey, if she can do it, so can I. Red Lotus ain't got nothin' on me! CGW: Rumor has it you walked in and saw her in a splash screen with your husband, Mr. Nukem. CROFT: Bollocks! I dumped that bum a long time before he ran to Lotus. Shame really, he was such a cutie-pie-lovely arse and gorgeous pecs, but nothing going on upstairs. CGW: Which brings up an interesting question. Don't you ever feel like you were exploited by the big gaming companies? You have to admit you haven't been cast in a TOMB RAIDER since Eidos started modeling gravity. CROFT: Yeah, I get that a lot. But it's never been just about big boobs and tight shorts. In case you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly easy. I've got the moves that gamers die for. CGW: I see. And what moves can you do now that anyone would possibly want to see? CROFT: Lots of new moves, ya pisser. Hit a special key combo and I quickly chug my drink and bash the bad boyz with the bottle. With the new transparency and fog effects, I can blow enough smoke from my fag to confuse an army. Let that Lotus slut try that. And wait till you see my super thigh slam.

"BYTE.ME Flesh For Fantasy News Passé An Interview With the PGL's Hottest New Poster Boy >>Huge scoop! CGW has learned that Sid Meier's next CIVILIZATION game will use the QUAKE Il engine! Gone will be the focus on the series' more arcane and obtuse elements, such as resource management and economic modeling, which Sid now admits were \"bor: ing.\" Instead, players of CIVILIZATION 3D will advance through time by collecting various power-ups scattered throughout the game-world. With the Quake Il engine,\" said Sid, \"we're finally able to take this series where I've always wanted it to go first-person action combat.\" n the hotly contested world of the Professional Gamer's League, no one has made a bigger splash than instant celebrity Thierry Nguyen, known to the gaming public as \"Flesh.\" Flesh's QUAKE skills are already the subject of legend, and his success in the PGL has already won him numerous prizes, endorsements—and even a fan club (the \"Fleshettes\"). But that's not all. Over the past few months, Flesh has been roman tically linked to at least three of the Spice Girls (prompt ing internal squabbling within the group, according to numerous tabloids), and is rumored to be lining up a cameo appearance for James Cameron's upcoming Titanic 2: Alien Intervention. CGW managed to catch up with Flesh for this exclusive one-on-one interview. CGW: Did you ever imagine this could happen as a result of being a gamer? FLESH: Of course. My parents always told me that gaming was a waste of time, and that I should study and stuff, but I knew better. What am I going to do with an education? Get some low-paying job like being an editor al a gaming magazine? Please. I have ambition. CGW: How did you get to be so good at QUAKE? FLESH: Basically by doing nothing else for a year. I wore an IV, so never had to stop for meals, and I kept a bucket under my chair, for obvious reasons. Not showering or changing for a year kinda sucked. CGW: Are you surprised by all the fame and media atten. tion you're garnering now? FLESH: Nah. People are attracted to success. They can smell it. And right now, they can smell me. Flesh and his Fleshettes CGW: Has your life really changed a lot since joining the PGL? FLESH: Well, it was like I was telling Scary the other day. I don't think it's-or was it Baby? No, wait-it was Posh. I'm sorry, what was your CGW: Well, what we really want to know is how you've managed to be so popular with the ladies. FLESH: Hey, I'm like, an athlete, you know? Women watch me work the mouse and keyboard, and you know, they're all, \"check him out.\" Baby told me the other day-no, wait, it was Scary this time-that watching guys playing Quake was like the greatest aphrodisiac ever.

"The Latest News From the Computer Gaming World READ.ME Unreal Takes Form Edited by Charlotte Panther (CPanther@zd.com) GT Interactive's QUAKE-Killer Shoots High GT Interactive and Epic Megagames are sticking to their early 1998 shipdate, so expect this game in the coming months. They couldn't be more specific than that. A demo/share. ware version should hit harddrives before that. Keep an eye out for this upcoming UNREAL experience. -Tahsin Shamma hey said it would look good, and it does. They said it would rival QUAKE II, and it just might. The folks down at GT Interactive are finally making UNREAL a reality. When I saw the game in alpha form, it looked as good as QUAKE II, and boasted some features that could portend an even more sophisticated experience. As the story goes, your character is aboard a prison ship that has crash landed on a planet inhabited by the Nali, a peaceful people oppressed by the warlike Skaarj. The good guy (or girl) that you are, you decide to help the Nali beat back the Skaarj's evil. There's quite a bit about UNREAL that impressed me. For one, the interaction between you and the game's inhabitants involves more than just violence. In your quest to help the Nali free themselves, you'll need to holster your gun and follow the game's many Nali guides to hidden secret areas. The Al in UNREAL looks good, and so it should, considering that Reaper Bot creator, Stephen Polge, is creating it. The Skaarj, for instance, leap out of the way of incoming weapons fire. And, typically, an early level hulking brute may be powerful, but don't expect him to exhibit the kind of thinking that some of the bosses do. In deathmatch, there will be one great surprise for gamers: the ability to play dead. You can feign death at a keystroke, and when your unknowing opponent runs past your prone body, you can leap up and pump their back full of lead. However, the best part of UNREAL is its mind-altering graphics. The code for generating such effects as lightning, lava, and water is affectionately known as the \"fire engine\" to the guys at Epic Megagames. The fire engine's fractal texturing results in liquid and ener gy effects that give the world a presence of its own. It's the engine's little visual details that can haunt you while playing UNREAL: the silhouette of a creature as it steps in front of a light source, the smoke released by a weapon as it fires, the glow of a weapon as it charges up. BIG, UGLY, AND SMART The Al in UNREAL should take the genre to a new level, thanks to Reaper Bot creator Stephen Polge CGW APRIL 1998 "


"READ.ME Who Do You Want to Shoot Today? Microsoft Unveils Part of Its 1998 Lineup News uring a late January trip to Microsoft's Redmond head. quarters, CGW got a sneak peek at some of the new titles that Microsoft planned to unveil at its second Gamestock event. Some of the software remains top-secret (we can tell you that AGE OF EMPIRES 2 is under development with all kinds of user-suggested features included, but if we violate our non-disclosure agreement to give you more details, we'll be forced to bundle Internet Explorer with the magazine for the next year). Here are some of the highlights we can talk about. Microsoft should release its first combat flight-sim, currently code-named Spitfire, before the end of this year. This isn't the jet simulation that former members of the Su-27 FLANKER team have been rumored to be working on. Rather, it's a World War II combat game based on the FLIGHT SIMULATOR engine. Most intriguing is that, as in FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98, the aircraft and terrain formats will be available to third-party developers and end-users who want to create their own aircraft. Along with that extensibility, though, the game will also be bringing the baggage of the very old FLIGHT SIMULATOR engine, and we'll have to see if the team can get the frame rate high enough for smooth play. On the hardware front, Microsoft showed a new device code-named Tilt. Although it looks like a larger version of the Sidewinder Game Pad, it can also be used in a unique man ner-tilting the entire controller sends joystick like inputs to your PC. It's a natural for motorcycle and driving games, and we found it worked great in MECHWARRIOR: MERCENARIES as well. The racing game that we hinted at last month is MONSTER TRUCK MADNESS 2. This time, the emphasis is on even better graphics and pure racing fun. It's not a sim, although there will be realistic weather effects and progressive damage. There are now more trucks, tracks, and races, and even a World Wrestling Federation tie-in: Five trucks will be named after famous wrestlers, and Hulk Hogan will make a video cameo. Look for it sometime in summer 1998.Denny Atkin and Elliott Chin >>>It may seem like another April Fool's joke, but this is actually for real.

"READ.ME In the Works News Flash M.A.X. 2: Taking it to the Max DOOOOOODDO TETO 030-050 >> Activision is ready to release its DARK REIGN expansion pack: RISE OF THE SHADOWHAND. The planned release date is March, and by the sound of it, this pack will make gamers sit up and take notice. SHADOWHAND Will boast several technical and gameplay enhance ments. For starters, there will be over a dozen new solo missions and several multiplayer scenarios. There will be new units, including a unit that can deform the terrain, and an animal trainer unit that can tame the new \"critters\" that will be added to the game. Internet games will also be improved to allow up to eight players. More enhancements include Al tweaks, new buildings, and added features to the con struction kit. A.X.2, Interplay's return to the strategy genre, is filled with new tactical challenges for players to hurdle. The story continues where M.A.X. left off, the humans in this world are petitioning to join the Concord, a galactic united nations that gives MAX technology to those who join. MAX technology consists of transplanting the brain of the species into vehicles, thus allowing faster and more precise control. The sequel builds off of M.A.X. (Mechanized Assault and Exploration) by offering real-time gameplay in addition to the original turn-based and simultaneous turns systems. The thing that gives M.A.X.2 an edge over other games is its terrain modeling. The landscapes during gameplay are as good as can be portrayed in 2D, almost on par with TOTAL ANNIHILATION. The use of parallax scrolling, which moves BEER 0000000000 objects and terrain at higher elevations at a different speed than those at lower eleva tions, is the game's most compelling terrain feature. Units on high ground appear closer in the top down view. For those extremely precise moments, M.A.X. 2 also incorporates a three. quarters isometric view that gets you closer to the battlefield. Yet, in this age of tactical technicality, the folks at Interplay haven't left out waypoints, line-of-sight, non-scripted Al, and advanced order options such as Guard Units and Seek and Destroy. Although M.A.X. was not as well received by players as it was by edi. tors, M.A.X.2 looks as if it might deliver enough exciting gameplay to hook fans, as well as critics, this time around. Look for it in late March.-Tahsin Shamma 058-0+ NI ISOT SIHI 109 proves difficult at best: Sometimes the key. board won't accept more than two key inputs at the same time-a necessity when you need to turn, fire, and accelerate.

"READ.ME PIPELINE In the Works Die By The Sword: Savage Swordplay 6/98 IE BY THE SWORD will bring the third-person action of games such as TOMB RAIDER up close and very personal. The game casts players as one of two sword-slinging heroes hacking and slashing their way through cramped, winding dungeons filled with orcs, ogres, and the like. While there are some puzzles and jumping sequences, the focus here is squarely on combat. Power-ups and potions are scattered throughout the tunnels, but there's just one weapon for players--the sword--and you'd better learn to use it. Instead of simply ask. ing players to aim and mash a \"fire\" key, DBTS really tries to place that sword in your hand, offering multiple, complex control choices for key board, joystick, and gamepad for a total of five different options. A move editor allows you to create and save complicated custom attacks. All of the polygonal, full-3D monsters have individual attacks, adding to the challenge. Skeletons dance and somersault through the air, diminutive kobolds leap high over your best backhanded slashes, and ogres exploit their superior reach to pound you into jelly. As with Activision's NIGHTMARE CREATURES, DBTS allows you to lop off the limbs and heads of your adversaries, and will even keep track of your dismemberings in the game's one-on-one arena combat mode. -Robert Coffey 03 98 Abyss: Incident at Europa Sound Source 8/98 Aces: X-Fighters Sierra 03 98 Age of Empires II Microsoft Xmas 98 Asheron's Call Turbine/Microsoft 02 98 Axis & Allies Hasbro Q3 98 Battle of Britain 1941 Talonsoft 03 98 Battlewagons SSI 8/98 Battlezone Activision Q2 98 Blackstone Chronicles SSI 11/98 Creatures II Mindscape 11/98 Deadlock 11 Accolade Deep Six Virgin Q198 Descent Freespace Interplay 5/98 Duke Forever Apogee/3D Realms Earthslege 3 Sierra 01 98 Earthworm Jim 3 Interplay 6/98 European Air War MicroProse 5198 Extreme Warfare Red Orb 01 98 Falcon 4.0 MicroProse 5/98 Fighter Duel 2 Ocean 01.98 Flanker 2.0 SSI 8/98 Flying Nightmares 2 Eidos 01 98 Freedom in the Galaxy Avalon Hill 10/98 Galactic Mirage Virgin 7/98 Game, Net & Match Blue Byte 5/98 Grand Prix Legends Papyrus 01 98 Great Battles of Julius Caesar Magic 6/98 Gualdalcanal Avalon Hill 02 98 IA-10 Warthog Interactive Magic IF-IA-18 Interactive Magic 5/98 Incubation: Wilderness Blue Byte 4/98 Jane's F-15 Jane's/ EA 01 98 King's Quest: Mask of Eternity Sierra 01 98 MechWarrior III MicroProse/FASA 04 98 MIG Alley Empire 02 98 Might & Magic VI New World/3DO 01 98 NHL Power Play 98 Virgin 9/98 Operational Art of War TalonSoft 01 98 Pacific Tide Star 03 98 Panzer Commander SSI 6/98 People's General SSI 10/98 Phantom Ace Virgin 02 98 Prey Apogee 3D Realms Xmas 98 Quest For Glory V Sierra 01 98 Rally Championship Virgin 6/97 Reach for the Stars Il Microsoft SSG 1 999 Redguard Bethesda 01 98 Redline Accolade 5/98 Return to Krondor Sierra Xmas 98 Revolution Fenris Wolf GT Interactive Sanitarium ASC Games/DreamForge 4/98 Screamer 3 Virgin Q3 98 Screamin' Demons Activision 02 98 Settlers 3 Blue Byte 03 98 Sid Meler's Alpha Centaurl Firaxis/EA 6/98 SimCity 3000 Maxis 01 98 Skies SegaSoft Q2 98 Squad Leader Big Time/Avalon Hill 03 98 Star Control 4 Accolade 10/98 Star Trek: First Contact MicroProse 02 98 Stratego Hasbro 03 98 Trespasser: Jurassic Park DreamWorks Q1 98 Ubik Cryo 5/98 Ultima IX Origin Xmas 98 Ultimate Civ Il MicroProse 5/98 VR Baseball '99 Interplay 01 98 VR Powerboat Racing Interplay 01 98 Warhammer 40k: Chaos Gate SSI 6/98 Wizardry VIII Si-Tech 02 98 X-Files Adventure Game Fox Interactive Q2 98 THIS JUST IN developer Coconuts claims that it will allow monsters to react differently according to how you play the game.-Allen Greenberg 47-tek, (415) 561-0700 www.47-tek.com Win 95 CD-ROM GOMAN A team of international humans is being readied to guide a group of three-dimensional Japanese animated-robots in GoMan.

You wake up in a hospital and find yourself with a ban daged face that could be straight out of Darkman. It's the kind of hospital where no one bats an eyelid at the sight of a guy bashing his head upon the wall in constant rhythm. And when you start talking to children with decaying faces and two mouths, that's the cue to start worrying about your sanity. SANITARIUM is the latest adventure game from DreamForge (CHRONOMASTER), in which you find yourself searching for the most fundamental characteristic of one's life: your identity. A deeply disturbing and surreal mystery unravels as you travel to odd locations digging up memories of your past and trying to discover why you're here. The alpha 1 played only let me go as far as a deranged town full of grotesque chil: dren (Jeannette, the actual town where DreamForge is based), but the company says that when the game is finished, your journey will take you to an Aztec temple and perhaps even to Hell and back.

In a collision, it is even possible to get the wheels interlocked with those of other cars. If your right rear tire, for instance, is resting on a wall, you can drive right off that wall, but you'll have to deal with the potential spinout when the other tires are spinning at different speeds. The tire models factor in all the things you hit in the world-hedges, fences, barriers, concrete walls, gravel, and so on. In fact, if you drive off the road at Zandvoort in South Africa, you might discover something you've never encountered in a racing sim before: sand traps. This is satisfying enough in the Formula 2 and Formula 3 cars, in which you can often throttle full down and use the steering to slide through curves, and in the street cars that you take out to learn the track.

Recovering from a spin by bearing down on the throttle isn't nearly as easy as it is in the other cars. For gamers like me, the chance to drive a Brabham, BRM, Eagle, or Lotus from this era is a dream come true. FAST TRACK GPL also brings new standards in track modeling to the genre. At the time of this preview, the following classic tracks had been suc cessfully licensed for use within the game: Kyalami, Mexico City, Monza, Mossport, Rouen, Spa, Watkins Glen, and Zandvoort. It was not clear whether Nurburgring (roughly 16 miles of wicked road course) would make it into the game, but courses like Spa, Rouen, and Zandvoort-very long tracks with lots of altitude changes-are extremely delightful (or masochistic, depending on your skill level) to drive. Even straightforward courses like Monza have degrees of detail, like seasonal foliage and accurate sponsors, that add to the experience. Getting licenses for many of these tracks has been a nightmare. Some of the configurations no longer exist. Further, many of the European towns and villages didn't really want the courses mapped out as accurately as Papyrus planned to execute them, for fear that tourists would try to match Grand Prix speeds on those old roads. Fortunately, Papyrus' diligence is beginning to pay off. For example, the record lap at Spa in 1967 was 3:28:30.

"Off to See the Wizards Most of the 3D-related difficulties that face both gamers and developers boil down to standards. There's an old adage popular among programmers: \"The great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from.\" With 3D games, problems come from not only the number of available standards, but also the different takes that various hardware developers have on these standards. Today the majority of games are programmed for Direct3D, the so-called universal standard; for OpenGL, a standard that originated on workstation-level computers and is now popular in games based on the QUAKE engines; or Glide, designed specifically for the 3Dfx Voodoo chips. (In some cases, games are programmed for both Glide and Direct3D.) But in the beginning, there were no standards. Microsoft had announced that it was working on supporting 3D in Windows 95 through its coming Direct3D, but the hardware and games were ready long before Direct3D was. So, various card makers developed their own 3D APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). The most notable of these was the Glide API for the 3Dfx Voodoo chipset. \"Glide emerged when there was no Direct3D,\" says Andy Keane, vice president of marketing for 3Dfx. \"It was the only thing out there. Its origins were in the arcade market.\" However, Glide isn't EXPOSED APRIL 1998 CGW "

"3D Exposed really an API in the traditional sense; it doesn't provide sophisticated functions such as you'd find in Direct3D. Instead, it's a \"chip in software,\" giving programmers an interface to draw things using the Voodoo chipset. Because this \"down to the metal\" method was very close to how programmers were accustomed to writing graphics routines, Glide quickly became popular with programmers who were converting 2D-only programs and beginning to develop new games. Glide's popularity wasn't hurt by the arcane techniques necessary to get decent results out of the version of Direct3D that shipped with DirectX 3.0. In fact, it was this poor design that resulted in the adoption of yet another API, Silicon Graphics' OpenGL, for the 3D version of QUAKE. \"DirectX 3.0 was horrible,\" says id Software's John Carmack. \"I spent longer doing an unfinished port of the GL QUAKE code to Direct3D than it took me to do the original port to GL from software rendering. \"DirectX 5.0 has improved things quite a bit,\" Carmack adds, \"and DirectX 6.0 will simplify yet more things with automatic texture management.\" Still, Carmack remains a proponent of OpenGL. \"OpenGL is the usability target that D3D is shooting for,\" Carmack says. \"I am more productive and more innovative working in OpenGL on NT than in D3D on (Windows) 95.\" ROGUES GALLERY As 3D boards grow in capability and programmers learn how to get the most of them, monsters get more threatening. DAIKATANA's rogues' gallery looks much more threatening than the creatures in last year's GLQUAKE. Developers haven't standardized on Direct3D in part because of the capabilities of the other APIs. Many developers find OpenGL more usable, while others find Glide lets them use familiar programming techniques. But there's another reason: Although Direct3D is a \"universal\" API that can support all graphics cards, all graphics cards don't AGP: Will It Help? have the same feature set, and there are even graphics cards that \"lie\" to programs about what capabilities they do have in order to score better on benchmarks. The result is that despite Direct3D's universality, developers must still test on virtually every kind of 3D card unless they want to be restricted to a very limited subset of features shared by all cards. \"Direct3D is universal in the sense that every consumer 3D card has D3D drivers, but that's about as far as it goes,\" says Doug Kubel, vice president of technology for Interactive Magic. The company found out just how varied driver support was when it released IF-22, one of the first flight sims to take advantage of Direct3D. \"From the start, you need to spend a good deal of time just keeping up with the newest cards, and even more testing with all the latest drivers,\" Kubel explains. \"The amount of time you spend supporting specific cards depends on how well you want to support them; perhaps you could spend as little as ost new Pentium Il systems ship with an AGP (Advanced Graphics Port) expansion slot in addition to PCI slots. AGP allows your computer to send data to your graphics card more quickly and lets chips store textures in your computer's main memory. \"Right now, AGP's main benefit is that it lifts texture limitations,\" says id Software's John Carmack. \"Texture management can be a significant performance issue on cards with only 2 megs of texture memory. Texturing directly from AGP memory can make that limitation disappear, or AGP can just be used as a double (or quad) speed PCI bus to make the texture download to the card faster.\" When graphics chips get faster, AGP will make for even greater benefits, Carmack says. \"In the future, AGP's largest benefit will be in providing the command bandwidth necessary to get millions of triangles a second out of real-world applications.\" Still, AGP is no panacea to 3D's current ills, say FIGHTER DUEL 2 developers Matt Shaw and Theodore Jump. \"We sincerely doubt that single technologies like AGP will solve many of the current headaches, even as they do help with some problems. We, as developers, and all of us as users need to keep in mind that 3D video technology at consumer levels is still INCOMING! Rage Software's INCOMING is one of the first fairly new and will take a while to action games to take advantage of the detailed textures mature properly.\" available on AGP machines.

Even worse, between the limitations of the interface and the implementation of some drivers, it simply isn't possible to build a truly hardware-independent version of an application using D3D.

This support will still be through the Direct3D if we have to due to time constraints or developer-support issues, but our goal is interface and so cannot really be called 'card specific.\" to do the best we possibly can, and that's usually not by relying on generic APIs.\" This mix of supported features in various Direct3D drivers requires so much testing that it can really stretch out development time.

This is exciting: It allows us to venture down design avenues that have been closed to us in the past due to technical constraints.\" There are still bumps ahead on the 3D road, but one thing everyone agrees on is that the results will be worth the pain. It's clear from talking to both hardware and software developers that, as far as 3D capabilities go, we ain't seen nothin' yet. The Future of APIs a single standard is necessarily a good thing. Neil Soane, producer of SSI's Su-27 FLANKER 2.0, says, «It will be interesting to see where this ends up. I firmly believe that it is always better to have competitive standards, as this pushes the industry along and gives us software manufacturers a goal to aim for. I would hate to think that we end up with a single 3D standard. Then we'd be at the mercy of the controlling company as to what will be achieved. This would not be good for the 3D games market in general.\" Dfx isn't the only company to provide a custom API to developers: Rendition, ATI, NEC/Videologic, and others have as well; but Glide has proven the most popular. One company that hasn't done a custom API is nVidia. Instead, the company's RIVA 128 chipset was designed specifically to be fully compliant with the Direct3D feature set; the company should also have an OpenGL driver available by the time you read this. \"Proprietary APIs don't move the industry together as a group,\" says nVidia's Mike Hara. He acknowledges that Direct3D has caused developers some headaches because of unimplemented features, but seems optimistic that such problems could soon be a thing of the past. \"In 1998, given the level of deep submicron silicon that we're getting access to, I don't think there's any excuse for a 3D processor not to support the full Direct3D feature specification,\" Hara says. \"We want to get to the point where developers can look at the Direct3D spec and program to it.\" Although 3Dfx continues to support its Glide API, it doesn't push it in favor of Direct3D. \"We're a big D3D proponent,\" says 3Dfx's Andy Keane. \"We have probably five times the resources on D3D than on Glide.\" One level of confusion may disappear in a couple of years. Microsoft and Silicon Graphics have announced that the capabilities of Direct3D and OpenGL will eventually be merged into a single API called Fahrenheit. Most developers are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward Fahrenheit, and not everyone thinks DEADLY COBRA SU-27 FLANKER 2.0 is one of the only announced OpenGL games that's not based on the Quake engine.

"3D Exposed Part 2: The Hard Choice How to Make the Why 3D? becomes a necessity if you want to When Buying a 3D Graphics Card by Loyd Case eeping your PC's hardware on the bleeding edge of technology is expensive and confusing. It seems as if every year there is a new piece of hardware that becomes a necessity if you want to get the most out of the latest games. Well, this year that new hardware is the 3D card. If you don't have 3D hardware in your PC yet, you're not seeing many of the newest games in all their glory. Choosing a 3D card isn't easy. Your choice will depend on many factors, not the least of which is deciding which games you want to play. But with all the 3D cards out there, and the confusion regarding different kinds of 3D software support-such as Direct3D, Glide, and OpenGL-how do you make the jump into the world of 3D without buying the wrong equipment? Well, this article will help you figure it all out. This is not another article explaining arcane 3D terms; that's been done already. Instead, let's take a look at 3D cards from the perspective of the puzzled buyer. As I can attest from the volume of email CGW gets on the subject, choosing the right card for your needs is a tough challenge. Read on and you'll find out why you want a 3D card, and what you should look for to make certain that the hardware you buy supports your favorite games. Without 3D card support, many games run smoothly only on computers with very fast processors. This is because displaying a three-dimensional world in the confines of your 2D monitor requires a tremendous number of mathematical calculations. Of the calculations needed to display 3D graphics, the most intensive is the final rendering-for example, turning those mathematical calculations of space and time into a picture on your screen that changes 15 or more times per second. When you add those calculations to the math required for basic gameplay-artificial intelligence, tracking enemies, playing music, reading a joystick, and the like-you end up with a daunting set of tasks for even the fastest processor. A good 3D accelerator card can take much of the burden of rendering the 3D game world from your processor. Its specialized hardware handles the tasks of placing objects on the screen, which leaves your processor more time for its other tasks and results in smoother gameplay. Games that support 3D cards (adding a 3D accelerator won't do a thing for old games that predate 3D hardware) will generally run much faster if you have a 3D card in your system. APT HUILES 3DE CGW APRIL 1998 "


"Product of Mexico HIGH VELOCITY Cards based on the RIVA 128 chip can hold their own against 3Dfx-based cards, but they won't run Glide games. 123 GRATIS How much faster? Let's take Quake as an example. On a 200MHz Pentium system with a decent 2D graphics card, you can get DOS QUAKE to run, at best, around 16-17 frames per second at 640x480 pixels resolution. Now, if you add a graphics accelerator with a 3Dfx chip, such as the Canopus Pure3D, that number kicks up to 28 frames per second (or better) at the same resolution. In DOS QUAKE, all of the graphics are handled by QUAKE itself, and the 2D card is just a \"dumb frame buffer,\" meaning that all it does is display the final image. However, the 3D accelerated version of QUAKE (known as GL QUAKE) uses OpenGL. OpenGL is one standard way of writing 3D software (more on this NECES BINO All AGP Cards Aren't Created Equal Non-Standard Standards CI slots haven't caused many problems for graphics card purchasers. For the most part, you buy a PCI graphics card, plug it in, and it works. AGP is different-and more complicated. The AGP bus runs at 66MHz. It stores 3D texture maps in main memory, called AGP texturing. Here, only the amount of texture needed is downloaded over the bus, not the entire texture. Then there's full AGP support, which includes 2x sideband addressing and address demultiplexing, which can double the amount of data that can be passed to the card from 256MB per second (66MHz) to 528MB per second (133MHz). Part of the blame for AGP confusion lies with Intel, for not taking a stand on AGP features. Basically, any chip that can run on an AGP bus—whether it takes advantage of AGP features or not-can be called \"AGP compliant.\" So if you're in the market for an AGP card, choose carefully. Here are some guidelines. Also, check our handy chart on page 88 for AGP feature support. Several graphics chips use the AGP bus as a sort of glorified PCI bus. They don't allow textures to be stored in main memory (AGP texturing) or take advantage of address multiplexing or sideband support. I've labeled these AGP 1x-only cards, but another term you might see is \"AGP lite.\" These aren't necessarily bad cards, but if you get one, make sure you get 8MB of RAM. Chips that are AGP 1x-only include the Number Nine Ticket-toRide, Rendition V2100/2200, and Voodoo2. Then there are those cards that add AGP texturing to AGP 1x speed. These still transfer data at 66MHz, but allow for off-card texture storage. These include the RIVA 128 and Permedia 2. Finally, there are cards that fully implement the AGP spec. These cards include the Intel 740 and ATI Rage Pro. later). You can run GL QUAKE on the most recent releases of Windows 95 (OSR2 and later) using Windows' own software OpenGL driver, but it would be painfully slow because it doesn't use the 3D hardware in your system. To solve this problem, 3Dfx has written a driver that translates the OpenGL software instructions generated by GL QUAKE into hardware instructions used by the 3Dfx chipset. The result is much faster performance. Similar \"mini-GL\" or \"QUAKE GL\" drivers are starting to show up for other graphics cards. Drivers that are fully compliant with OpenGL and offer the ability to actually customize OpenGL (to a limited extent) are expected for most graphics cards this year. (You'll see the full drivers referred to as \"ICDs,\" short for installable client driver.) Then there's the issue of image quality. Without going into the technical jargon, 3D games look much better and more realistic using hardware acceleration. Most of the latest generation of graphics hardware can now turn on these imageenhancement features with relatively little sacrifice in performance. The improvement in the quality of the graphics can be quite remarkable. If you've ever seen LONGBOW 2 in its full, hardware-accelerated 3D glory, going back to software-only 3D is almost painful. In addition to making things look better, good 3D hardware allows for special effects that would be far too costly in terms of processor horsepower for even a 333MHz Pentium Il to render. For example, Quake II makes heavy use of colored lighting and shadows. These tricks are performed by blending multiple texture maps (bitmaps) together (using the hardware to perform the blending). This is a snap for a good 3D accelerator to handle, but it would slow a 3D-less system to a crawl. The bottom line is that 3D accelerators can significantly enhance the gaming experience by increasing the frame rate at which the game plays and creating a more realistic virtual world. Okay, now you're sold on the idea of buying a 3D accelerator. Which one to buy? Here's where it gets difficult, because various games support a number of different, incompatible 3D standards, and you'll want to make sure to get a card that supports the standards used by the games you like to play. The various 3D standards are based on different 3D APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), the software layer that programmers use to tell the 3D accelerator hardware what to do. There are three prevalent APIs, and a couple of somewhat common ones. Many cards support more than one of these. The three APIs that are most common are Microsoft's Direct3D, OpenGL (originally developed by Silicon Graphics), and Glide, the proprietary API that exclusively supports hardware using 3Dfx graphics chips. Direct3D games have been slow in coming, but are now beginning to increase in number. Early versions were poorly documented and performed poorly, as well. Direct3D became usable with only DirectX 3.0. DirectX 5.0 supplied better documentation and performance. For All Gamers LLUSTRATIONS BY TODO DAVAN: PHOTOS BY MEHEL FALCONER ome of you wargame and strategy game grognards are probably scratching your heads and thinking, \"So, what's in it for me? Well, it's inevitable that some wargames and strategy games will make extensive use of 3D graphics. We've already had a taste of this with the turn-based, tactical combat game INCUBATION, which can use a 3Dfx accelerator. MYTH, the real-time tactical combat game from Bungie, also makes heavy use of 3D acceleration. You only have to look at the TalonSoft games to realize that 3D graphics could enhance those types of games as well. 3D will eventually permeate all genres of gaming. APRIL 1998 CGW "

"DIAMOND FAST AND FRIENDLY Cards based on the 3Dix Voodoo Graphics chipsets may not be the absolute fastest out there, but with support for Glide, OpenGL, and Direct3D, they allow you to run the widest range of software. A . w During the interim, 3Dfx stole some of Microsoft's thunder by evangelizing its own 3D API, Glide. The performance of the 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics chipset was well ahead of any other 3D chips at the time. so quite a number of 3D game developers were attracted to the chips because they could use their power to show off the developers' games. On top of that, Glide is a \"thin\" API, which primarily handles rendering chores instead of trying to do everything. This allows 3D programmers to continue to work with whatever 3D methods they prefer. Meanwhile, the boys at id Software turned a cold shoulder to Microsoft and picked OpenGL to add hardware acceleration support to the QUAKE engine. At first, it seemed somewhat quixotic, since stuums CPU Speed Matters OpenGL was the purview of very professional-level 3D chips, but 3Dfx stepped up to the plate with a \"mini-GL\" driver that included only the OpenGL functions needed by Quake. All the mini-GL driver does is take the OpenGL calls used in QUAKE and translate them to the appropriate Glide calls. At the same time, NEC and Rendition were out beating the drum for their respective proprietary APIs. All of this has resulted in an enormous amount of confusion among the buying public. Until the market settles on a single 3D API, you'll need to look at the games you want to play, consider which APIs they use for 3D, and then buy a 3D card based on this information. Be sure to check out the chart elsewhere in this feature that details which APIs are supported by which popular games. To get an up-to-theminute list of the hottest graphics cards, check out Loyd Case's Ultimate Game Machine feature at www.gamespot.com. Designing and producing a graphics chip takes time. The record time to market for a new chip probably goes to nVidia's RIVA 128—the chip went from inception to production in around nine months. Chip designers have to use their crystal balls and decide which kinds of systems the people using their cards will have. Bear in mind that most graphics cards and chips sold go into new systems by big PC manufacturers, not into boxes Top Ten 3D Misconceptions are already two strategy gamesMYTH and INCUBATION—that support 3D acceleration. A 3D accelerator will speed An up all of my 3D games. Not necessarily. First, the game has to be written to take advantage of a 3D accelerator. Second, some of the first-generation 3D \"accelerators\" actually ran more slowly than if the game had simply used the software renderer. and my 3D games don't run any faster and look just the same. You probably didn't enable 3D acceleration in the game. Most games still default to software rendering, and you actually have to tell the game's setup or preferences boxes to turn on 3D acceleration. An AGP Voodoo2 will blow He everything else away. Maybe, maybe not. It probably won't run any faster than a PCI Voodoo2. 3Dfx has stated that the PCI bus is not a performance bottleneck. On top of that, the Voodoo2 is an \"AGP lite\" chip, meaning it doesn't support any advanced AGP features, just the 66MHz bus. And, you'll lose the ability to add a pair of Voodoo2's to double performance both have to be PCI cards. It's far better to get an advanced AGP 2D/3D card and a Voodoo2 or maybe a pair of Voodoo2's. It seems if I want a Windows 3D card I have to get a combination 2D/3D card. and if I want to run DOS-based According to all the computer magazines, AGP is totally useless and is no better than PCI. Most computer magazines focus on \"productivity\" applications, which are generally all 2D based. AGP won't help much with 2D work. AGP begins to come into its own only with games that have huge textures and that understand AGP. The box says \"3Dfx,\" but w the game won't run ini accelerated mode on my card! If a box has the 3Dfx logo on it, it may be designed specifically for cards based on the 3Dfx Voodoo/ Voodoo Rush chips, or it may be a Direct3D game that runs on all brands of 3D cards. Check the system requirements fine print carefully to see if your card is supported you can't rely on the logo. I'd like to upgrade to AGP, U but buying another graphics card will stretch my budget, since I'd have to throw away my PCI graphics card. No, you don't. Assuming your AGP motherboard has enough slots, your P CI graphics card will work just fine in it. Then you can sit back, wait for the dust to settle a bit, and pick the AGP card that's right for you. ficient. Is there an answer for me that will not compromise the power of my existing card? Most games don't run 3D in a Window-they run full screen. So you don't have to give up your hotrod 2D card, especially if you use it for high-end graphics. Just get an add-on accelerator, like a 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics card. An AGP graphics card will Ja run faster than a PCI card Again, not necessarily. Some AGP cards are really just glorified PCI cards. Unless the card supports some of the advanced AGP features (such as AGP textures), you'll see very little benefit over a PCI card. I can only buy a 3Dfx TU card because I want to play Quake and QUAKE II. I'm sure the boys at id would take exception to calling Quake II a 3Dfx game. QUAKE Il uses OpenGL for its 3D acceleration: 3Dfx happened to be the first one out with a \"miniGL\" driver for GL QUAKE. There are indeed games that support only 3Dfx, but there are also some very good Direct3d games. Also, OpenGL is now a viable option now that Microsoft and SGI have kissed and made up. 0 I only play strategy and O adventure games, so I don't need a 3D card. Guess again. Some point-of-view adventure games have started adding 3D accelerator support. There 3D is useless. I bought one of the highly rated 3D cards, U CGW APRIL 1998 "


"CPU Speed Matters Some new graphics cards are hot performers in speedy Pentium Il rigs, but can't match last year's 3Dfx in your trusty Pentium 166. We took three graphics cards and tested them in the PCI slots of a P166MMX and a P2/266 to gauge their performance in each system. Memap 3D Winbench 98: Pentium MMX/166 ATI xpert@play 204 Diamond Viper 330 2401 Diamond Monster 3D 217 on store shelves. Naturally, a chip designed last year would want to target the AGP bus and the Intel Pentium II. Of course, the operating system would either be Windows 95 or Windows NT. There's an interesting side effect to this necessity. Owners of existing mid-range Pentium systems may find out that the latest hot chip doesn't do so well on their rig. The RIVA 128 and ATI's new Rage Pro are good examples. Both do very well on Pentium II AGP systems, Pop a PCI version into a Pentium 100, and you'll wonder what all the fuss is about. Using 3D WinBench as our measure, the newer chips run a lot faster than a 3Dfx accelerator (such as the Monster 3D) on a 266MHz Pentium II. On the other hand, the RIVA will actually run 3D WinBench 98 slower than a 3Dfx card on a Pentium 120. The one exception to the rule seems to be the Rendition V2200 chip, which has a very even performance curve. This means that the graphics card you might choose for a new, AGP-based system would be different than the one you'd get to upgrade an existing PC-based Pentium system. While the ATI All-inWonder Pro might beat out a Monster 3D in your new 300-MHZ AGP Pentium Il system, it will be a distant second in a Pentium 166 PCI box. 3D Winbench 98: Pentium 11/266 ATI xpert@play 451 Diamond Viper 330 485 Diamond Monster 3D 361 Percent Speed Increase in Pentium Il System ATI xpert@play 221 0896 Diamond Viper 330 202.08% Diamond Monster 3D 166.36% on the 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics chipset, which works in conjunction with the 2D card already in your system. Unless your primary graphics card is truly awful, this is your best bet-and could even delay that much dreaded system upgrade for a few more months. Later, you can add a low-cost, 2D/3D accelerator. My current favorite 3Dfx accelerator is the Canopus Pure3D. If you do want to get a 2D/3D card, then take a good look at the Rendition V2100or V2200-based accelerators. They offer balanced performance on a wide variety of systems and are the only good bet if you're on a very tight budget and need to find a card that sells for $100 or less. If you have a very fast system—say, a 233MHZ Pentium MMX or a 200MHz Pentium Pro—a 3Dfx add-on card is probably still the first option to consider. But some interesting options open up, particularly if you want to do 3D in a window (for example, VRML on the Web or MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98). The RIVA 128 and ATI Rage Pro begin to shine at CPU speeds of 200MHz or faster. The RIVA is somewhat faster than the Rage Pro cards, but the The Right Choice Performance Difference Between Cards, P166 6.37% ATI xpert@play Diamond Viper 330 9.5896 Diamond Monster 3D 0% (Baseline) Performance Difference Between Cards, P2/266 ATI xpert@play 19.96% Diamond Viper 330 25.57% Diamond Monster 3D 0% (Baseline) So what do you buy? As in that old classic boardgame, Clue, there's more than one solution to this mystery. Let's break it down a bit. If you're unable to upgrade your entire computer, you can still get noticeable results by adding a current generation 3D accelerator.

"3D Exposed 3D image quality of the Rage Pro is slightly better. However, RIVA cards are dropping in price, and the performance is remarkable in Direct3D. You'll notice that Voodoo Rush cards, such as the Intergraph Intense 3D, aren't in my mix. First, I'm not too happy about their 2D speed. Second, the 3D performance of the Rush can be up to 30 percent slower in games that simultaneously use alpha transparency and z-buffering (GL QUAKE comes to mind). And I've had endless problems setting up and configuring several different Voodoo Rush boards. Simply getting them to work correct ly, across a variety of computer systems, keeps me awake at night The bottom line is this: For the best performance on a Pentium system and the widest range of software support, you should probably consider first purchasing a card based on the 3Dfx Voodoo chipset. Then look into getting a fast 2D/3D card if your budget allows. Note, however, that if you are planning a system upgrade in the next three to six months, hold off on that 2D/3D card.

"3D Exposed Equipping Your Hot New PC API Support in Popular 3D Games Game Publisher Direct3D 3Dtx Glide OpenGL None Others Rendition Okay, so you're in the market for a new computer-or at least, you're considering a serious brain transplant by adding a new motherboard/CPU combination to your system. First, if you're just moving up to a Pentium MMX system to take advantage of plummeting CPU prices, follow our advice for an existing system: Get a 3Dfx-based add-on card. If you're also buying the primary 2D/3D card, consider a Rendition V2200 card (if you're getting a 200MHz or slower system). What I'd really recommend, though, is to get a Pentium Il system with an AGP graphics card. However, be aware that not all AGP cards are created equal (see the AGP sidebar). Some graphics cards can take full advantage of AGP's advanced features, whereas others simply use it as a somewhat faster PCI bus. This doesn't mean that an AGP card that doesn't store textures in AGP memory is a bad card—but it does mean you might want to get one with more memory on board. My picks include the ATI Rage Pro cards, the RIVA 128 cards, cards using the Intel 740, and the Rendition V2200 cards (but only if they're equipped with 8MB of RAM). If you do have to mix professional graphics work with your gaming, the Permedia 2 cards might work. Note, however, that most of these cards will work with Direct3D and OpenGL, but only 3Dfx cards will work with Glide games.

The company's Glide API has proven very popular in certain segments of the market, such as simulations and sports games. Because of 3Dfx's early technology lead and Microsoft's stumbles with Direct3D. many current 3D titles support only 3Dfx. Game developers didn't really have to rethink how they did their titles; they could just plug 3Dfx's Glide programming interface into their rendering engine. It gave them the ability to quickly port existing games. 3D patch coming midyear XX Rendition only: 3Dix patch in works Rendition PowerVR Rendition Mystique xxx Rendition xxxx On top of that, the original Voodoo Graphics chipset had a commanding technology lead over its competitors. The technology playing field is showing signs of leveling a bit now, but the upcoming Voodoo2 chipset will regain that performance edge. If you want full support across the gamut of 3D games—Direct3D OpenGL, and Glide-you need to get a 3Dfx card. The good news is that even if Glide eventually fades away as game programmers pick one of the standard APIs, you will still have a pretty fast card. All isn't rosy, though. Some systems don't have free PCI slots. Unless you're willing to deal with the headaches and performance penalties of Voodoo Rush, then you're out of luck for Glide titles. A more minor point is that a 3Dfx add-on card only supports full-screen 3D. This FRAME RATE APRIL 1998 CGW 89 "

"3D Exposed Web Resources There's a wealth of information, free utilities, and other niceties on the Net. Here's a list of the best ones. means if you're a FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 aficionado, you probably want a fast 2D/3D combination card. Wargamers should sit up and take notice, too, because it's very likely that 3D Wargame titles will want to do their 3D in a window-but that's just a guess on my part. To make things even more confusing, some games that have the 3Dfx logo on the box in fact support both Glide and Direct3D. DID's F22 ADF is one example. Other games with the 3Dfx logo use only Direct3D-but have only been tested with 3Dfx. So the safe bet for a hard-core gamer is to get a 3Dfx card to put alongside whatever other graphics card you have. And, yes, a 3Dfx card will coexist very nicely with an AGP graphics card. If you're picking up a hot new AGP rig with a 333Mhz Pentium II, you might want to budget for one of the soon-to-ship cards based on the 3Dfx Voodoo2 chipset. Rendition members.octonline.com/mattpetk/rendition resource/ News and information on Rendition-based accelerators. www.bjor3d.com A must-see Web site for Rendition owners. ATI Rage Pro www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/ Horizon/8276/ Good source of information on ATI's newest chip. 3Dfx resources www.voodooextreme.com This is a good source of news on 3Dfx titles, drivers, utilities, and other miscellaneous 3D information. www.planetquake.com/gldojo/ Though Zanshin focuses heavily on GL QUAKE, there's lots of useful information on 3Dfx cards and some pointers to recent drivers and patches. www.03dfx.allgames.com/ More of a news-oriented site; less useful than Voodoo Extreme www.3dfxmania.com/ Lots of pointers to game patches and other useful information Loyd's Picks S3 (No, Really) www.tbrowne.demon.co.uk/s3virge/ There are a lot of VIRGE cards out there, and it's nice to see a good source of information on the various members of the VIRGE family. Here's a quick rundown of the bottom line. Gamers looking to upgrade existing computers with 3D capability should first look into adding a 3Dfx card, such as the Canopus Pure3D, Diamond Monster 3D, or others. Pick one of the add-on cards, not a Voodoo Rush card if you can help it. Then, look into upgrading your primary card. Pick a card that scales well with your CPU speed. People buying new systems should try to budget for a fast AGP system--but don't forget to budget for 3Dfx as well, unless you're confident you won't be running titles which support only 3Dfx cards. This holds true for most game genres, including action games, sports games, and flight sims. Eventually, the confusion will die down as the next-generation games support one of the standard 3D programming methods, and perhaps we'll see a time when you'll need only one graphics card in your system, and adding more becomes a matter of choice rather than necessity. & RIVA 128 www.midtnweb.com/rivaextremel A great source of utilities and news on RIVA 128 www.rivazone.com Another good font of software and information on the RIVA 128. pages.prodigy.net/babblin/Main.html More good stuff on RIVA 128. Miscellaneous www.real3d.com/primer/contents. html Although Real3D is a manufac turer, this part of their site has a terrific description of 3D accelerator terms and technology, www.fastgraphics.com/ Here you can find FASTVID and a host of other interesting utilities. Lots of information on general graphics performance issues. New Cards on the Horizon New technologies are on the horizon that will push 3D performance even further. Here's the skinny on three new accelerator chipsets that you might want to consider if you're willing to wait a little while to make the jump. use of per-pixel MIPmapping. The 2D performance and VGA performance is still an open question, however. The 740 is an AGP-only part, but can support up to 8MB of local SGRAM. The 740 supports Direct3D and OpenGL: there is no proprietary API. It makes full use of advanced AGP features, including AGP textures and full support for AGP speed enhancements (2x sideband and address demultiplexing for you techheads). This also might be an interesting card as a primary card in an AGP system, but wait until you see the reviews before buying. Revved up RIVA Sometime this summer, we'll be seeing cards that use the RIVA 128 Turbo. The Turbo is an enhanced version of the original RIVA 128 used in the Diamond Viper, STB Velocity 128, and a host of other cards. As with the original card, the Turbo supports both Direct3D and OpenGL games. What's been enhanced? Speed, for one. The internals of the chip have been streamlined so that the 3D engine doesn't spend as much time sitting around waiting for things to happen. One key, much-requested enhancement is the increase in maximum local memory to 8MB. A RIVA Turbo card with 8MB of 100MHz SGRAM would make a very nice AGP primary card in a new Pentium II system. Voodoo Redux The best news about the upcoming 3Dfx Voodoo2 chipset is that all the current 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics titles are supposed to run on Voodoo2: 3Dfx learned its lesson after the confusion that resulted with the release of Voodoo Rush. Voodoo2 adds a full triangle setup engine, resolutions up to 1024x768, and the ability to link two cards together in SLI (scan line interleave) mode. 3Dfx is claiming that a single Voodoo2 card will double the performance of the original Voodoo Graphics. Other than the above, no new features have been added. But it's compatible, it's fast, and it should be on the \"A\" list of anyone with a free PCI slot. Although the chipset is capable of working in an AGP slot, it makes no use of AGP textures or other advanced AGP features. Since 3Dfx is suggesting that the PCI bus is not the bottleneck, then get a PCI version alongside a fast 2D/3D AGP part if you have an AGP system. The Sleeping Giant Wakes Nearly two years ago, Intel cut a deal with Lockheed Martin's Real3D division to bring its hardware acceleration technology to a consumer price point. The result is the Intel 740. The actual 3D performance will probably be about the same as the RIVA 128, but the image quality should be better, due to the APRIL 1998 CGW "

Unfortunately, all three have a problem; floating-point performance The integer performance in the alternatives from all three companies' makes them competitive with Intel, but they all lag at least somewhat on floating-point performance. To remedy that performance problem, AMD developed its own small, extended set of floating point instructions to speed up DirectX 6.0's software geometry accelerator. Initially, it looked as though Cyrix and Centaur would go their own ways in developing other instruction extensions, but they have instead decided to use AMDs. This is good news, in that it shouldn't muddy already murky waters as to whose game will run on whose 3D chip. The bad news is that it's still unclear as to whether these three CPU makers can agree on a common socket specification. Alreadly, because none can use Intel's Slot I, the motherboard market will become somewhat fragmented in 1998, and if the three cannot agree on a common non-Slot I socket, the fragmentation will be further compounded.

"LOYD CASE HARDWARE «Sometimes, you just have to nuke Windows.\" Continued from pg 99 wasn't happy with his tech support experience, but from what I could see the support folks did everything they could. 'Troubleshooting obscure and tricky problems is tough over the phone, and even more difficult via email, when you can't ask questions in realtime. At times, however, games just refuse to run. Sometimes it's the game's fault. I develop a twitch in my left eyebrow every time I think about trying to get HEAVY GEAR to run over a network Too many games are simply shipped before their time. But sometimes, you just have to nuke Windows. for all your applications Have the driver disks for all your hardware available, too. If you're feeling ambitious, you can set up a directory on a hard drive or Zip drive to contain all the drivers in their own separate folders. If you have the upgrade version of Windows 95, make sure you have the original setup disk 1 from your Windows 3.1 disk set, as Windows 95 will ask you for it during the install. Also, make sure you have all the necessary serial numbers handy. Step 2 Now that your stuff is all backed up, run SCANDISK with the «Full» option, so it performs a full surface scan of your drive. This way, if bad spots have developed on the drive, they will be marked as bad and won't be used later. Next, defrag your hard drive (we'll do this once more, after the reinstallation). If you're feeling particularly ambitious, you can even reformat your hard drive, but this is necessary only in dire circumstances. Step 3 The next thing to do is set up your system so that reloading Windows is easy. First, copy the contents of the \\windows\\command directory into a different directory (since I don't have MSDOS anymore, I copy all the files into Idos). Then copy HIMEM.SYS from the windows folder to the root folder. Next, if you don't already have it, create a JUST KILL IT All right, a number of you are cither stunned at this or cackling with glee. However, I don't mean permanently nuking Windows; there are too many good Windows-only games. I mean removing it and reinstalling it. Windows 95 deteriorates over time, as you set up and delete games and applications, download stuff over the Net, and install updates. At some point, the system gets sluggish and games that once ran splendiclly suddenly blow up without notice, Denny Atkin, our features editor, has experienced this on a number of occasions, and believes that reinstalling Windows every 6-12 months is a good idea. I concur, and here's how to do it. Step 1 Back up your system. I mean, back up everything. It may take a zillion floppies if you don't have a tape drive or removable hard-crive, but it will let you go back to a known state if you get into trouble. (Backing up to a second hard drive is acceptable.) Do a file-by-file backup; don't use one of those partition image\" tools. Next, make sure you have all of the installation CDs and floppies  GIPS Bulet mo Selom Awes encional 2 regar Drevo Deco  If you're a user of cards using the RIVA 128 chipset, do yourself a big favor and head over to the RIVA extreme Web site (www.midtnweb.com/riva extremel) and pick up a copy of the RIVA 128 Tweak utility. It installs as a tab in your display control panel. It's particularly handy for games that don't handle the RIVA's auto-MIPmap feature well. Just set the auto-MIPmap levels to zero. If you like to give yourself a moment to choose whether to boot into Windows or boot to the DOS prompt, just add the following commands to your MSDOS.SYS file: BootMenu=1 BootMenuDelay = 15 The Windows 95 boot menu will appear when you start your system and give you 15 seconds to make the choice. Note that MSDOS.SYS is normally a read-only file: you may have to change it to read/write by altering its Properties sheet with the Windows Explorer. Aliens Neser Les 59 C CGW APRIL 1998 "

"LOYD CASE CONFIG.SYS file that has the DOS real-mode driver for your CD-ROM drive. Then make sure that MSCDEX.EXE is loaded in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. There are some other things you'll want loaded as well. Here's an example of what the file should look like: HARDWARE CONFIG.SYS: DOS=high DOS=umb Device=C:\\himem.sys Device=c:\\cd atapi_cd.sys /d:mscd001 AUTOEXEC.BAT: C:\\dosimscdex.exe /d:mscd001 Step 5 Take a deep breath. Did you back up everything? Now, to ensure that your CDROM drive is working properly under DOS, put your Windows 95 CD in and type \"DIRD:\" (assuming D: is your CD-ROM drive). If you get a directory of the CD, you're ready to zap Windows. Type \"deltree c:\\windows\". (If your Windows directory is something else, substitute that directory name.) Your hard drive will churn for a while and then Windows will be gone. Savor that feeling for a moment. Now change to your CD's drive letter, and type setup\". Follow all the usual instructions. At some point, Windows will reboot the system. When it docs, press F8 at the \"starting Windows\" message and once again boot to the DOS prompt. Change the disk to dos and type: \"edit c:\\autoexec.bat\". You may find that Windows setup has commented out the mscdex line; if so, uncomment it, or you may not be able to find the CD drive when Windows asks you; this is silly and annoying, but necessary. Step 6 Finally, after a couple more reboots, you'll be back in a clean version of Windows. The hard work of installing drivers will begin. Note that users of newer motherboards may also have to restore their motherboard INF files (this is also known as the \"PUIX4 patch\" and can usually be found on a diskette that came with your motherboard or computer). Restoring the motherboard INF files will remove extraneous undefined devices in the Device Manager. After you've reinstalled all of your applications, rerun Windows 95s Disk Defragmenter. You'll probably notice that games that didn't run well suddenly run better and that many mysterious system crashes no longer occur. Now you (it's hoped) have a year of trouble-free gaming ahead of you. & Step 4 Now reboot. When you see the starting Windows 95\" message, press the F8 key. Select \"boot to the command prompt\" menu item. You'll now be at the DOS prompt. Now, change to the dos directory by typing\"cd \\dos\". IHUNDERS \"A DOUBLE MUST-HAVE.

"CROC: LEGEND OF THE GOBBOS  REVIEW **** DIFFICULTY LEVEL ERMEDIATE Super Reptile World ACTION Fox Interactive Scores With This Cute Crocodile by Mark Clarkson ince it's impossible to talk about CROC without comparisons to Nintendo's SUPER MARIO 64, I'll get that over with up front. Croc is very, very similar to that popular N64 game. As the adorable headliner in this third-person, 3D platform game, you'll run, jump, and smack baddies upside the head with your tail, all the while leaping from platform to platform, collecting crystals, and saving the fuzzy little Gobbos. A MULTIPLATFORM GAME Croc can run, jump, stomp (to open crates and plugged wells), climb walls bounce on mounds of pink Jell-O, slide on ice, swim underwater, dangle from balloons, and drive boats. There are keys and secret levels to find, locked doors to open, and even some engaging minigames to play, such as three-card Monty or whack-a-sheep But you'll spend most of your time Icaping between platforms. There are platforms that move back and forth, up and down, or around in circles; platforms that shatter or plunge downward after a few seconds; and platforms that move in conveyor belt-like streams. In the end, though, they're just platforms. Likewise, the enemies exhibit a certain \"sameness.\" There are penguins and snakes and bees and doggies, but the majority of the bad guys look like little plush devil toys from an iron claw machine. Some hop, some fly, some throw snowballs, and some shoot tridents at you, but they're all cut basically from the same cloth. in Croc. Smack a bad guy and he disappears in a shower of sparks. Don't fear; he's not really dead. In a few seconds, he'll pop right back again. \"Take a hit yourself and any crystals you've collected fall on the floor, you get about five scconds to collect CROCODILE BUNGIE Croc will leap, tail slap, and bounce his them again way around in this MARIO 64-like game of platform jumping and before they fade gem collecting away. If you're out of crystals, you lose a life and start over at the nearest set But be forewarned: This is a cute point. If you're out of lives, you must game. Croc is cute. The Cobbos are restart the entire level. way cute. Even the evil devils barring In true console-game fashion, CROC your way at every turn are pretty darned allows you to save your game only cute.

"C&C SOLE SURVIVOR REVIEW ***** DIFFICULTY LEVEL Connect & Conquer NOILOV Westwood's Online Action Game Isa Blast...When the Lag Doesn't Get You by Robert Coffey ith COMMAND & CONQUER: SOLE SURVIVOR, Westwood Studios has released an addictive little action titlc that captures some of the C&C flavor while delivering its own unique charms. O Lostouckefenses Scarlover LO FAUST2001 Soampil O , SOLE SUUNOR ALL TOGETHER NOW SOLE SURVIVOR'S cooperative games are its high point. In this football game, the orange team pulls together to escort the flag bearer to the goal. Peran sus! Lithua SHUT UP AND SHOOT After registering the game, you'll be taken to Westwood Online, where you can quickly and easily start a new game or join one in progress. Double-clicking on a channel shows who is playing, the maximum number of players, and, most importantly, how good your connection is. The last step is to select your unit from about two dozen possibilities, including infantry, armored vehicles, and even some dinosaurs. Domination comes through powerups acquired from the crates littering the sprawling game maps. These crates, which enhance amor, speed, weapon strength, range, and rate of fire, can tuma Minigunner into a Mammoth Tank-killer. To keep faster units from scooping up all the crates and squishing everyone else, the designers have wisely added the ion cannon. Think of it as a slap upside the head from God-the more crates you collect, the more likely your next crate will be a fatal energy blast from above. In SOLE SURVIVOR, greed is not good. You move your unit from a top-down perspective by simply pointing and clicking where you want to go. Targeting is a simple maller of clicking on your chosen victim. SOLE SURVIVOR has more of a learning ripple than a learning curve, and it lets you dive right into the fairly addictive action sional. The game's only real problem is a common one: lag times that effectively paint a target on your back. If Westwood Online's latency indicators were more reliable, this would be less of a hindrance, but allegedly good connections can turn out to be really, really bad -which leaves you really, really dead. But once you find a good connection, SOLE SURVIVOR is perfect for a quick burst of addictive online fun. GAMES PEOPLE (IN TANKS) PLAY At its most basic level, SOLE SURVIVOR is an exercise in dispensing, and avoiding, death. The core game is a free-for-all in which every man tries to rack up the most kills before time runs out. It's fun and tense, and the race for crates creates a sense of frenzy that would otherwise be missing in a game that doesn't exactly deliver speed. SOLE SURVIVOR really shines in its cooperative games. There's a capture-theflag option for up to four teams, but my favorite cooperative game is football. In football, two teams compete for one flag and carry it to end zones located at cxtremes on the map. Capture the flag games, which require more refined tactics, often degenerate into free-for-alls. Conversely, the football game generally rallies players together as they\"block\" and protect the \"runner.\" Its a hoot. Shooter fans might not like SOLE SURVIVOR's lack of real unit control, and some might find it a tad too one-dimenAPPEAL: Gamers looking for engaging, straightforward action. >PROS: Easy to learn; play is wellbalanced; cooperative games are more fun than traditional deathmatches. CONS: Bad lag times; Westwood's latency indicators not trustworthy; lack of more immediate unit controls.

During this period, horror exploded onto the scene in both fiction (with the publication of Frankenstein, Dracula, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) and real life (the notorious reign of Jack the Ripper).

As either character, you must pursue Crowley through various London locations and end his hideous experiments.

Of course, you'll also be dodging boulders, snakes, and rats, and trying not to fall into lava or toxic waste, or off the edge of a frozen cliff. With these complicated, devious level designs, Hasbro has actually managed to turn FROGCER into a puzzle game--and it's a blast. Single-player FROGGER is great, but the multiplayer game is fraught with problems. For some reason, the designers declined to include the wealth of cool levels for multiplay, and the few that are available get old pretty fast. Also, in hotseat play, when you use the keyboard to control your frog, the split-screen is reversed. This means that when you use the left side of the keyboard, you control the frog on the right splitscreen! Networked multiplayer games also have problems if one of your opponents is playing without a 3D card. The game seems to go to the lowest common denominator, which slows it to a crawl. Keep in mind that a 3D card is virtually a necessity for FROGGER. Without one, the game is almost unplayable, and it looks so bad you wouldn't want to play anyway. If you have a 3D-accelerated machine and are up for some hot single-player gaming, you'll love FROCCER. But if your rig is still 2D and you're a multiplayer maniac, don't bother.

When I finally got my whiz-bang Pentium last spring, DIABLO was the first game I bought, and it didn't take long for me to become hooked. Very hooked. I loved the gameplay, the music, the graphics, the neat items-in fact, I liked almost everything about it. So when the HELLFIRE expansion was announced, and I found out that it was being done by a third party-Synergistic Software instead of Blizzard, I was a little skeptical. Could another company emulate the quality of the original game? Happily, Synergistic not only did that, they put in some enhancements to DIABLO that make playing it even better. the mana pool. While not as powerful as mana potions, the new staff allows the mage to stay down in the dungeon longer.

As with its predecessor, RBII's strengths lie in its inmersive atmosphere and enormous scope, which span the entire course of history's first air war From the slick interface graphics and music to the wealth of background information on WWI and the aces who fought in it, the out-of-cockpit experience is brimming with enough period feel to put even jaded simmers in the mood for flying. In addition to a customizable instant-action dogfight option, 27 canned missions are included, plus a powerful (but buggy) mission builder to let you create your own. The heart of the game, however, is its dynamic campaign mode. To embark on a campaign, you must create a pilot record. You specify for which country you will fly (France, Britain, Germany, or America), your enlistment date, initial rank, and squadron affiliation. Because a campaign continues until the war ends or your pilot is incapacitated or killed, it will often require a substantial time commitment -sortie counts can easily run into the hundreds! Unfortunately, a recurring crash bug can make further progress impossible if it strikes, forcing you to restart the campaign. Missions vary from routine patrols to balloon busting to infantry support. Preflight bricfings list waypoints, INSTRUMENTAL Realism fanatics can opt for the bare altitudes, and for bones instrumentation real WWI pilots had to work with, mations to be but two modern dashboard layouts are also provided for used.

"RED BARON II  REVIEW Unfinished Business SIMULATIONSPACE ierra has apparently decided to complete Red Baron Il's development in stages-after putting it on store shelves. Current plans call for three major patches. The first, a beta version of which was available at ftp://ftp.dynamix.com/RedBaronll/ at press time, fixes most of the worst bugs (game crashes, self-resurrecting aces, blocked campaigns, flights circling endlessly over the starting aerodrome, and time compression not deactivating when enemies are near) and adds several welcome enhancements. For those who dislike virtual cockpit panning views, the set of fixed views has been expanded to offer total coverage akin to that found in Air WARRIOR and WARBIRDS, albeit with a clunkier interface. Screen shaking now presages stalls, warning you to back off before it is too late. Brightly colored tracer graphics make gunnery easier, though much more frequent gun jams will force you to fire in shorter bursts. The infernally accurate groundfire has not been toned down, but flight altitudes have been increased enough that you will be able to avoid the worst of it. You can also reduce its effectiveness manually by creating a new file called rb2sim.ini and populating it with the following (lines must be double-spaced to work): [Baron] bulletMassFactor= 180 groundGunnerBase=800 groundGunnerNoise=180 groundGunnerConvergence=160 The next patch will feature recalibrated flight-model parameters for far greater realism in aircraft behavior. The final patch, expected mid-year, adds support for 3D accelerator cards. Multiplayer fans will find they have their own set of patches. Although several head-to-head (but not cooperative) multiplayer options are available, they require a different downloadable patch just to work at all, and will need more fixes before they are stable. by its effective combination of fixed and auto-tracking padlock views.Accurate hit-detection and outstanding damagemodeling also contribute. Depending on where and how hard a plane is hit, it might suffer various degrees of control degradation, wing spar breaks, weakened or lost wing sections, or oil leaks that can potentially lead to raging engine fires. If your engine erupts in flames, you generally have two options: Burn to death or bail out without a parachute. Choose wisely. Graphically, the fully texture-mapped sim environment is attractively detailed and functional. However, without 3Dcard support it can't match the visual splendor of its 3D-accelerated competitors. Frame rate on a Pentium 166 system at moderate detail settings is adequately smooth, with occasional slowdowns. The clouds that appear in screenshots on the game box were yanked out for performance reasons, which is probably just as well. Making up for the less then stellar graphics, RBII boasts an impressive array of sound effects: Wing spars creak when about to give out; air-raid sirens blare from threatened aerodromes; and crashing aircraft snap, crackle, and crunch as they cartwheel to pieces across the rolling French countryside. WORK IN PROGRESS RED BARON II is a diamond in the rough. Underneath its bugs, slightly dated visuals, and minor idiosyncrasies, it still manages to capture the spirit of the original RED BARON. A noteworthy achievement as is, it has the potential to follow its progenitor as a true giant among flight sims, but only if Dynamix comes through with its promised flight model, multiplayer, and 3D-accelerated graphics patches & Although the planes are pleasant to fly Fortunately, these lapses detract little and each different type has a distinct from the sims exceptionally fun dog. and convincing feel, the flight model is fights; the main consequence is to give too forgiving to be truly realistic, even at you a slight edge over the computer the most authentic setting.

"PRO PILOT . REVIEW ***** Strictly Semi-Pro DIFFICULTY LEVEL PRO Pilot Took Off Before the Flight-Testing Was Completed SIMULATION/SPACE by John Nolan he marketing wizards at Sierra unabashedly boast that \"Sierra PRO PILOT is the most technically accurate, intellectually demanding and authentically true-to-life flight simulator available for the home PC.\" If only it were so! This long-awaited civilian flight sim had the benefit of starting with a fresh design, free to be all that it could be.\" Alas, the opportunity slipped away 20 20 10-10 BUS CROSS VERT SPD TIMIN BEZAKE COM IN THE DETAILS PRO Pior features incredibly detailed, legible instrument panels, and almost everything works with the click of a mouse. HEARTLESS The core of any flight simulation is the flight model; without a quality flight model it becomes just another a game. PRO PILOT' is proof that some producers either don't have a grip on the importance of an accurate flight model or don't feel its necessary to provide both simplified and detailed models. The Cessna 172 is a common civilian aircraft, one in which many pilots and potential PRO PILOT buyers have some experience. Fail to model this aircraft accurate ly and the credibility of the entire simulation is called into question. The Cessna 172 in Sierra's PRO PILOT is not particularly well-modeled. A brief \"familiarization flight\" consisting of take off, departure, slow flight, stalls, spins, steep turns, and a descent to approach and landing reveals quite a few shortcomings. There's no yaw when you put the power up for takeoff. Once airbome, if you turn without using rudder, the ball quickly centers without any pilot input. The pitch attitude in slow flight is almost identical to normal cruise, \"hands off\" stall recoveries with no altitude loss are routine, and the aircraft can't be put into a fully developed spin. On approach lowering the flaps doesn't seem to add any drag until you reach the full down position. These characteristics imply a casual approach to the flight model, indicating that the entire lift/weight/ thrust/drag relationship needs work before Sierra can rightly make its \"true a usable frame rate that may or may not to-life\" claim. provide the amount of detail that you personally require. Clearly, Sierra missed OUT OF THE PICTURE the flight when it decided to forgo 3D Another critical element is the graphic acceleration. It's incredible that this one environment.

"REVIEW PRO PILOT SIMULATION/SPACE flight characteristics are satisfactory for casual users. Graphics are about average, but it's the lack of 3D acceleration that really makes the biggest visual statement in PRO PILOT. It's not a positive comment; the current crop of inexpensive state-ofthe-art 3D accelerator cards make this a colossal oversight. On the bright side, PRO PILOT is a good cockpit procedures trainer, the complexity of the cockpit modeling and the checklist feature set new standards that competitors will be forced to match. A fairly complete set of airports across the U.S. and accurate terrain clevations mean that most American gamers will be able to practice flying from their local airports. Furthermore, the documentation is a cut above the competition in this category. The Flight Assignments section of the Flight Companion is especially noteworthy; this genre has needed something like it for quite some time. Overall, the simulation shows promise, but it appears this fledgling was kicked out of the nest a bit too soon. PATCHWORK QUILT Terrain is best viewed from a high altitude; at low altitude it just doesn't look very realistic, as this shot from 2,000 feet reveals. animation is very good, usually displaying interior cockpit control movements and corresponding exterior-view aircraft reactions while the instructor gives the briefing. These movies are useful for both the sim and for actual flying: its clear Sierra did its homework in this arca. Still, if you think you're going to leam everything you need to know about landings in two minutes, it's time for a reality check. The Air Trallic Control feature is another plus; it adds important realism to the simulation. Alas, there are glitches, such as when the controller keeps repeating the \"Climb to 7,000 feet\" instruction for several minutes after you've leveled off. It just doesn't respond to your actions as well as the ATC in FLICHT UNLIMITED II did, which lends a \"canned\" feel to the experience. Perhaps the best part of Pro PILOT is the Might Assignments section found in the Flight Companion handbook; finally there's some interesting flying to do in a civilian flight sim. These 20 cross-country trips are flight-planned and come with reasonably detailed written instructions on what to do and expect on the trip. The Air Traffic Control feature ties in with the flight plan, and you hear realistic instructions from the controllers. Of course, as with the rest of the program, there's evidence that the developers made last-minute changes. The book descriptions often don't match the con troller's instructions, another example of the lack of testing that went into this game. These \"missions are the future of this simulation; as inevitable revisions improve the flight model and graphics, this feature could move PRO PILOT to the head of the pack APPEAL: Civilian flight-sim fans and student pilots willing to work with a sim still under construction. PROS: Realistic, educational Flight Assignments; good ground lessons in movie format; excellent flight-companion handbook. >CONS: Flight model won't satisfy realism devotees; desperately needs 3D acceleration; graphics are just average; ATC system has sluggish, rigid AI. POSTFLIGHT DEBRIEFING This is not a true \"flight simulator\"; the flight model is just too far into the arcade category to meet those high standards. Now you know why Sierra has a flashing \"Beyond Real\" graphic on its PRO PILOT Web page; the flight model is so far beyond real that its unreal. Still, the Do It Right or Do It Over n a sad commentary on marketing department influence on game release dates, Sierra released a major patch for Pro Pilot (visit www.sierra.com) very soon after the game's release. This is a \"good news/bad news\" situation. It's great that the developers immediately went bug hunting, but it's inexcusable that they shipped this program with so many defects. The READ.ME file for the patch details 34 bugs that were stomped. Some of these problems were truly minor, such as getting the correct takeoff time in your logbook when taking off from nontower airports. But far too many of the problems were major, like correcting drag characteristics on all five aircraft and fixing the Baron so that it didn't run out of fuel in 20 minutes. The patch improves the flight model; the 172 demonstrates a torque effect on takeoff and the drag effect of the flaps is enhanced. While the flight model still needs work, at least Sierra admits it needed improvement. It's incredible that such problems are even present in a nonbeta release. As Cliff Shiers, the best navigator I ever flew with, used to say, \"It's always easier and usually cheaner to do it right the first time!\" CGW APRIL 1998 "

"REVIEW . JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER Cheats and Tricks SIMULATION/SPACE etween dogfights and multi-mission campaigns, take a break to try out these two hidden goodies in JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER:  Start a campaign and bail out, preferably over an airbase or nearby city, then guide your pilot's parachute to the ground. While most flight sims end the mission upon touchdown, JSF actually lets you walk anywhere, à la Doom, with pistol in hand. Granted, you can only shoot at planes and structures, but it's still a kick. It also gives you the opportunity to view the game's detailed graphics-trees, buildings, and the like-up close and personal.  The other trick requires a helping hand-or very long fingers-but is well worth it. In the Pilot Select HUEY RIDE The \"fly any plane\" cheat even lets you screen, hold down both Ctrl keys while selecting your take helicopters into combat. aircraft. You can now choose to fly any of the available aircraft in the game, including Soviet MiGs, B-2 bombers, and Bell helicopters. You won't see a cockpit display, but otherwise, each aircraft is fully functional. Switch to an external view to confirm your new craft. This undocumented feature is a great way to liven up dogfights or put a new twist on campaigns. pixelation a thing of the past (note that beautiful the game looked at 640x480 the frame rates here are much faster than resolution and 16-bit color.

FICKLE JOY One of the game's few problem areas is its fickle control configuration, which tends to lose joystick settings from one session to the next. Even when properly configured, the game sometimes fails to recognize certain button functions, such as the hat switch on my CH Combat Stick. Otherwise, joystick control is tight and responsive Although the JSF is a strike fighter, your wingmen seem interested only in air targets. So you might as well plan to bring along F-22s as wingmen and take on the responsibility of air-lo-mud combat alone. Exceptionally fast, user-friendly, and loaded with visual eye candy, JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER takes the lead in the next generation of mainstream air combat sims. If you've been daunted by steep hardware and skill requirements in the past, this sims for you. APPEAL: Beginneror intermediate-level combat pilots looking for an easy-to-fly plane and a game with replayability. PROS: A real speed demon, with or without 3D hardware; beautiful graphics; mission editor adds depth and replayability; realism and skill options galore. CONS: No multiplayer campaigns; control setup slightly flawed. RATEI CGW APRIL 1998 "

Bellevue, WA (800) 757-7707 www.sierra.com UNFINISHED BUSINESS The sad thing is, programming and design flaws that will undoubtedly frustrate many aspiring overlords totally negate this game's potential. In fact, the initial release of LORDS OF MAGIC is essentially a beta. The time required to load different screens and to process other players' moves is a major lest of patience, while the game itself crashed so frequently that I eventually resorted to backing up after every move. Morcover, LORDS has a nasty habit of confusing its bookkeeping, so that new units you buy are as likely to end up in the army of your enemy as in your own. Also, characters (including you) in LORDS OF MAGIC are much weaker than they ought to be. While it makes sense for you to be weak at the start of the game, characters on both sides remain ridiculously fragile throughout the contest. Many times another religion launched a sncak attack on my weakly held capital, while my main army was off somewhere else.

"LORDS OF MAGIC REVIEW Band-Aids Can't Cure Everything ORDS OF MAGIC is another in the seemingly infinite series of recent Sierra games that requires a patch to merely play the game. Version 1.2 allows play to move along considerably faster than the original, and now -the game only crashes about once every 10 tums or so. One of the least pleasant aspects of the patch is that it makes the game's design flaws all the more noticeable For instance to become the recognized lord of your people, you must free your religion's great temple from the forces of darkness. If you manage to free another religion's temple later in the game, the people of that religion will swear fealty to you as well-provided you aren't presently at war with them. As all of the other temples are weakly held, you can double and then triple the size of your empire simply by riding into the opposition's region, taking the temple in a single, easily won battle, and then moving on. All of the effort put into the various races and the fantasy background doesn't mean much when you can win in LORDS OF MAGIC by using such a simplistic strategy. In the final analysis, the patch helps-maybe raising the game to a 2of 2.5-star rating-and the dozens of fixes it contains are far too many to list here. As of press time, there were yet more patches on the way. Caveat Emptor.

Gun 127 WSVT AAMG 22.62mm PKT CMG Spee e see so many sequels because quite simply, a good thing is hard to leave behind. In this casc, Gary Grigsby and SSI have produced accurate and enjoyable simulalions of WWII armor action in STEEL PANTHERS and of post-1945 actions in STEEL PANTHERS II. The question is whether the latest entry in the series, STEEL PANTHERS III: BRIGADE COMMAND, really is an enhancement, or just one last kick at a cash cow? THE DUSTBIN OF HISTORY STEEL PANTHERS III has some nice touches (such as this informational screen), but they don't quite make up for the creaky game engine. (including ammunition amounts and types) and defensive capabilities, with troop quality and morale also playing large roles. Combat affects units' abilities when they are suppressed, pinned, or routed, and leaders may attempt to ame. liorate negative results through rallies. If you call in artillery or air support, it won't arrive instantly, and may result in \"friend ly fire\" losses, which are dealt with more realistically than in previous STEEL games. You attain victory by (typically) occupying objectives, achieving good kill ratios, or both Price: $44.99 System Requirements: 486/66, DOS 6.22 16MB RAM, 16MB hard-drive space, 1MB SVGA graphics card, mouse; supports Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards. 3D Support: None. Multiplayer Support: Email (2 players). Designers: Gary Grigsby, Keith Brors, and the SSI Special Projects Group Publisher: SSI (a Mindscape Company) Sunnyvale, CA (800) 601-7529 www.ssionline.com SEVEN DECADES OF WARFARE STEEL III tries hard to provide everything that made the first two games popular. The interface will be easily assimilated by STEEL veterans (though it's still not as elegant as PANZER GENERAL'S). STEEL III is certainly comprehensive, as it covers a wide range of conflicts, from 1939 to the near future. Every nation with scrious armed forces is represented with an adequate table of organization and equipment, and you can choose from more than 40 different scenarios and six campaigns covering all theaters of war. The campaigns offer chances for getting more troops, upgrading equipment, and improving troop and leader quality -provided you do well in the linked battles. If there aren't enough baltles to suit your fancy, you can create your own with STEEL. III's editor. You've seen these mechanics before: turn-based, with opportunity fire possible in the opponents turn. As you would expect from a modern tactical game, facing and line-of-sight are crucial to effeclive fire. Fog-of-War is used well, and it often causes blazing firefights when fire from one unit trips an ambush and hidden enemy units start a chain reaction brawl, then draws in other friendly units. As in other Grigsby games, units are extensively modeled for weapon systems reliance on artillery preparation and air reconnaissance. Command control-points are used to change a unit's stance (defend/advance) or objective, or to request indirect fire. Each leader has a number of points equivalent to his rank. Points can be gained each tum if the leader is in contact with his superior headquarters. Dependence on chains of command force you to refrain from break-neck charges. There is certainly enough going on in SIEEL. III to make it more than an addon. Still, one has to wonder why SSI is essentially using a 1995 DOS engine for the third installment to one of its flagship series. Die-hard aficionados of modern warfare will find plenty of realisin here. Others should be warned that STEEL III is not anywhere near the definitive wargaming statements made by STEEL 1or L. APPEAL: Primarily for hard-core 20th-century wargame fans. PROS: Solid tactical model; new scale; command control. CONS: Aging DOS engine and graphics. BUT IS IT DIFFERENT? STEEL III differs from its predecessors primarily in two areas: scale and command control. A hex is 200 yards, not 50, and units represent infantry companies (30—50 men) and vehicle platoons (2-4 vehicles) instead of platoons (10-25 men) and individual vehicles. Where one lucky shot could take out a Tiger in an earlier SIEEL game, a Tiger section in Streu. III requires prolonged pummeling. Infantry is now tougher. Armor takes the role of a sharp instrument for slashing advances, not a blunt instrument. Thus, to do well in STEEL III, you must employ rcal combined arms tactics-with a particular CGW APRIL 1998 "

"**** REVIEW. WORMS 2 DIFFICULTY LEVEL Set Phasers on CLASSICS & PUZZLES Don't Expect Too Much From This Simple Farce of Gun-Toting Action by Martin E. Cirulis Cream slice RTILLERY goes back to the ancient days of computer gaming, when ASCII characters doubled as graphics and programs were stored on audio tape. Basically, each player had a cannon to fire at opponents. After inputting the angle and power of your barrel, you would see the little asterisk that was your shell arc across the screen and either blow up your opponents gun or chew up the landscape. It wasn't DONKEY KONG, but it was fast, easy to program, and one of the few multiplayer games available. As times and technology have changed, ROGUE has become DIABLO, SPACEWAR has evolved into WING COMMANDER, and ARTILLERY has become...well... WORMS! More precisely, the new and improved WORMS 2, brought to you by the cfforts of MicroProse and Team 17. SEA YA! You'll have a wide range of weapons (from bazookas to air strikes to baseball bats) at your disposal to sink your enemy's worms. WORMS polish in the graphics and interface that may leave some players disappointed. If you want to get your money's worth, you had better love ARTILLERY and twisted humor an awful lot. Otherwise, this one could get awfully thin awfully fast. On the other hand, in a world where computer games get more complex and pretentious every day, WORMS 2 offers a fun trip back to a time when gaming could be enjoyed over a coffee break. Price: $36 System Requirements: Pentium 75, Windows 95, 16MB RAM, 2x CD-ROM drive, 1MB video card; supports SoundBlaster-compatible sound cards 3D Support: None. Multiplayer Support: Modem (2 players).

However, some players, especially fans of the other ARTILLERY descendent, SCORCHED EARTH, will be annoyed by the fact that terrain is immune to the effects of gravity Blow up a cliffs foundation and you'll still see portions of it suspended in midair. WORMS 2 does a good job of warding off repelition by offering dozens of new weapons and enough nutty terrain types. It also contains a set of user tools for fidcling with almost every aspect of the game. Using the crude-looking, but effective, editor, you can adjust every weapon's characteristics and availability. The same goes for the actual rules of any given battle. Even the sounds your worms make as they gloat or moan after an attack can be preselected. MEALWORM MAYHEM In case you missed this game's wacky predecessor, WORMS 2 is a cross between the mechanics of ARTILLERY and the humor of LEMMINGS. Instead of cold, heartless howitzcrs, you command a group of psychopathic worms with access to a truly bizarre and terrifying arsenal of weapons. In basic game terms, this means that your artillery piece now looks and sounds a whole lot cuter and can move around before shooting. While some of the weapon effects are funky and original (just try to restrain a snort as you lob a holy hand grenade or send a killer sheep to do is deadly business), there is no escaping the fact this is an ancient computer game tweaked to the nth degree. A nice twist, though, is that instead of commanding just a single cannon, you run an entire team of weapon-toting worms. The actual physics APPEAL: Gamers looking for fast, simple action and twisted humor. PROS: Very funny game that takes ARTILLERY as far as it can go; tons of gameplay options at the user's fingertips. CONS: Game's limited, basic mechanics could quickly lead to boredom; terrain is immune to gravity; graphics and interface lack polish. AT WHAT PRICE...AMUSEMENT?

Sierra's HOYLE CASINO features basically the same crop of computer personalities» as the rest of the Hoyle series. The usual Sierra polish extends this time around to include paintings and ancient Greek sculpture, which gives HOYLE HOYLE CASINO APPEAL: Electronic gamblers looking for a slick presentation. PROS: Slick graphics; highly configurable. CONS: Same annoying HOYLE computer opponents, only a fair gambling tutor. BEAT THE HOUSE 2 APPEAL: Those who want more authenticity in their computer gambling. PROS: Several authentic casino games; good gambling tutor. CONS: Bland graphics; not very configurable. CASINO the feel of being located in a second-rate art museum. Interplays BEAT THE HOUSE 2, on the other hand, emphasizes substance over style. At times, it pushes this approach a bit too far, as shown in the numbingly bland (if appropriate) cocktail piano sounds. Visually, BEAT THE HOUSE 2 lacks the crisp atmosphere of HOYLE CASINO but neither game adjusts to higher resolutions, so anything other than 640x480 means a less-than-fullscreen. Both packages include Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, Poker, and Slots. HOYLE tries to sweeten the deal by adding Hoyle l'riday Night Poker, but BEAT THE HOUSE 2 adds Video Poker, Mini Baccarat, and Poker Challenge, which fit more properly in the casino context. similar documentation, and a paperback book by Steward Wolpin on poker is a poor substitute, since most of the games it discusses can't be played in Hoyle. If you're interested in slick graphics and configuration, you could do worse than HOYLE CASINO, another solid entry in Sierra's Hoyle lineup. But BeAT THE House 2 supplies more authentic casino-style games and instruction for the serious player. In either case, it's hard to lose, since you avoid the potbellied, cigar-smoking, fiftyish crowd. Who says computer games don't raise the moral tone of life in general? & CASINO CARD COUNTING BEAT THE HOUSE 2 offers a coaching feature that lets you get a suggested next move in any game. Yet its game options are relatively slim, as opposed to Hoyle's, which are highly configurable.

For serious fans of both Shanghai and Mal-Jongg. SHANGHAI DYNASTY warrants further investigation. Be prepared, though, for a few surprises not all of them pleasant. DYNASTY includes Classic Shanghai, considerably, and this \"feature\" can't be toggled off. In general, multiplayer play of all the games is sluggish-the exact opposite of real Mah-Jonggor Shanghai. For those who merely want to wage their skills against the computer, SHANCHAI DYNASTY offers a nice collection of tile games. Those looking for competition from real-life opponents are advised to stick to the tabletop version. WW2 Shanghai for Kids (a terrific way for chil dren to learn the classic game while using their knowledge of mathematics and the alphabet), Pandamonium (you race against up to four players to match up tiles on a communal board), and Dynasty (you battle opponents on your own board). SHANGHAI DYNASTY also offers a very user-friendly version of Mah-Jongg. All the games offer different tile sets, layouts, and snazzy multimedia clips, and are certain to amuse singleplayer fans. When I challenged some of my pals to play over the Net, however, the game fell apart. The very nature of turn-based classic games like Mah-Jongg makes them perfect for chatting between turns, yet the developers included no chat feature during play! Worse, the \"pass» feature in multiplayer Mah-Jongg causes each player to confirm that they can't use each discarded tile, which slows down play Price: $39.95 System Requirements: P90, Win 95, 16MB RAM 40MB hard-drive space, 2x CD-ROM: supports Windows compatible sound cards. 3D Support: None.

Only when battle seemed imminent did commanders rescind these orders and re-deploy their troops off-road and into maneuver columns When the enemy came into view, the troops were again re-deployed, this time into battle formation, placing cach regiment line abreast of one another. Regiments were evenly spaced by several yards to allow their commanders casy access to the front ranks while permitting skirmishers an avenue in which to withdraw. Units move much faster by road than they do cross-country, even when units form up into maneuver columns.

Hood bolsters the resolve of the front-line troops with his superb command rating. in real-time wargaming, it's never an easy feat to keep one eye on the battlefield and the other perusing a multitude of units and their many individual attributes. Nevertheless, the prudent player will constantly evaluate the stature, disposition, and alignment of every formation under his command in order to maximize their collective combat effectiveness and achieve local superiority on the battlefield. Beyond various aural and graphical cues and animated indicators (entrenchment markers, fluttering regimental flags, rates of fire, states of readiness, and the like), you should continuously examine every unit's morale bar to determine each unit's current condition, combat experience, morale level, deployment, and general ability to follow orders. Five separate characteristics are graphically depicted, any of which may change each time the unit moves, shifts formation, or engages the enemy: 1. Experience Each eagle icon denotes a specific level of combat experience, ranging from «green» (inexperienced) men, to trained, veteran, and elite (a.k.a. \"crack\") troops. Note that green troops automatically start out with two icons, hence the extra eagle Only battle-hardened units should be charged with carrying out sensitive duties. 2. Support Linear tactics mandate that each unit be properly supported by other friendly units-positioned on either shoulder or just to the rear-to prevent flanking attacks and dangerous defilade fire. Try attaching, then reattaching, regiments in a brigade, and shuffle the regiments around, placing more reliable troops on the flanks. 3. Covered Terrain Obviously, units deployed in broken or obstructed terrain are more concealed than units deployed out in the open, and they enjoy some measure of protection from enemy fire--especially enemy artillery. Place your own artillery Stiglo atop unobstructed hills while infantry rings the forward slopes to protect the position. eadery Ridge 4. Entrenchment Units arrayed in open terrain are far more susceptible to enemy fire than units situated behind walls, fences, or trees. So, it troops remain out of range of enemy fire, they will, on their own, begin to entrench. Note that when entrenched units are ordered to wheel and face in a new direction, they will still retain their original entrenchment value. 5. Command Units deployed near a commander are less likely to bolt under intense and prolonged combat. Moreover, the presence of a gallant leader permits a regiment to charge an enemy position and, in most instances, hastens the return of routed, demoralized units. APRIL 1998 CGW "

While initial unit deployment and having a plan to achieve mission objectives are important strategic considerations, they cannot make up for poor tactics.

Avoid using the Move Fast command unless a vehicle is in an open area. In close terrain or towns, the Move command is better because vehicles tend to follow more logical paths and get stuck less often. Another key is to move vehicles in short hops of a few inches at a time. The more confined the terrain, the shorter the movement distance should be. Pay close attention to how and where the vehicle is moving, particularly in towns, where tanks tend to become stuck against buildings.

While an armored-piercing (AP) round from the German tank's 75mm gun could easily plerce the Sherman's armor, the HE round had no effect. The Sherman had an AP round loaded, which could penetrate the Panther's armor. Thus, the superior German tank was destroyed by the inferior Allied tank. Panther 62ms Tank vs. Tank Some players make the mistake of assuming that German tanks are superior to Allied tanks. While this was historically true, the distances at which battles are fought in this game combined with the terrain density of many maps reduce Cerman advantages in gunnery and armor protection. In this setting, even the lowly Stuart light tank poses a significant threat to the deadly Panther--if it uses its speed and mobility advantage to maneuver for a side or rear shot. Players using German armor should also note that turret rotation speed is taken into account. Because American-built tanks used variable-speed electric turret traverse, they could track moving targets better and bring their guns to bear more quickly, providing the advantage of firing the crucial first shot in a quick-draw engagement. Americanmade tanks also had gun stabilizers fitted, which helped them fire more accurately on the move. Another useful tactic is to deploy a tank in position with a good field of fire and give it a Defend command. Many times, an Al-controlled tank will spot and fire at targets of opportunity more quickly than you can respond. This is especially true on maps such as Son South, where tricky linc-of-sight comes into play: withstand and repulse an Allied armor assault. With the Allies, the situation is much different. They rely mainly on PIAT's and Bazookas to defeat German armor. These weapons have limited range (70 meters for the PIAT, 80 meters for the Bazooka) and are effective against Panzer Mark IV tanks and lighter armor. But against such opposition as Panthers and Tigers, only shots from the side, rear, or top stand a chance of causing damage Therefore, the best position for a PIAT or Bazooka team is in a multi-level building where it can fire down into the tank's thin top armor, virtually assuring a kill from any angle. Once spotted by the enemy, PIAT and Bazooka teams attract fire from small arms, tanks, and mortars. Even if it isn't eliminated, the team will acquire so much suppression that it will be lucky to hit anything To avoid suppressive fire, keep the anti-tank team stationary and hidden until it has a good shot. If a team must be moved to a better location, use the \"Sneak\" command to reduce its chances of being spotted and fired upon. The Al rushes armor support to spots where its infantry is in trouble. Knowing this, the best tactic is to set up an ambush in terrain that forces tanks to close within cffective Bazooka or PIAT range. By studying the terrain and anticipating the paths that cnemy tanks are most likely to follow, anti-tank teams can lie in wait for enemy vehicles. Be sure to provide infantry support to prevent anti-tank teams from being overrun by enemy infantry & Infantry vs. Tanks The Panzerfausts carried by individual German infantrymen and the availability of relatively inexpensive Panzerschreck anti-tank teams gives the Axis a potent tank-killing combination. With these anti-tank weapons alone, it's possible for the German infantry to Case Study Two: Anti-Tank Machine Guns German StuG III assault gun breaks through American lines at Schjindel, threatening to collapse the defensive line. The German vehicle halts near a three-level building In which a .30-caliber machine gun team is hiding. The Gls open fire and destroy the marauding enemy vehicle. What happened? Normally, expecting a machine gun team to take out a fully enclosed armored target such as a tank or assault gun is pointless. However, most machine gunsGerman and Allied alike-possess a limited degree of armor-penetrating capability that can be useful against lightly armored targets such as half-tracks. In this case, because the machine gun was firing from above at point-blank range, it was able to penetrate the vehicle's much thinner top armor. APRIL 1998 "

A few sims (LONGBOW 2 is one) let you play a larger role by managing an entire squadron. In such cases you have more to worry about than bringing your helicopter back in one piece. Now, you have to worry about every pilot achieving his assigned goals and accomplishing all of the required tasks as well as not running out of pilots, helicopters, or ammunition. It's a much bigger job, but for the strategists among us it's also a more fulfilling job Droid (001 Lesbow (1) wires (0) Dat (0) FARS 27t2   Soke Longbow (R) Stoker (0 Shadow (0) Longbow 0 21 FARA Berne (o) FAR Fight ATO 0003 Longbow (R) Dery (0) St (00) L ow (1) Heywood (0) FALU Tisht ATO 2005 Locow (R) Longbow (RO) Sweeper (0) MISSION CRITICAL Although the computer will generate missions for you, you'll do better if you use LONGBOW 2's excellent mission planner to manage your resources. Right Tool for the Job It may be an old cliché, but it could be the single most important lesson of all: Use the right tool for the right job. What does that mean exactly? First, it means matching the ammunition to the target type, which boils down to a matter of balance. On the one hand, make sure the ordnance A you're sending out is sufficient for the task at hand. Make sure it has ample firepower lo destroy the assigned targel. On the other hand, don't waste THE RIGHT TOOLS Mixing helicopter and armaexpensive (and ment types within a single flight offers maxipossibly hard to mum flexibility obtain) ordnance on inexpensive BORED 163 2 BORDO targets. Do you really want to fire several million dollars' worth of missiles at a truck that cost the \"People's Democratic Republic of Wherever\" a few thousand dollars to build? Depending on the trucks cargo, the answer may be yes, but more likely, it's no. Second, using the right tool also applies to the type of aircraft used and even the crew assigned (if the simulation identifies pilot skill levels, as does FALCON 3.0). Does the mission really require two AH-64Ds both carrying the Longbow radar and radar-guided Hellfires, or will a laser-equipped Apache serve equally well? Moreover, can a UH-60 or an OH-58 suffice? Using Blackhawks and Kiowas for \"light\" sorties frees your \"big guns» for the more demanding assignments. typically start boy assessing the firepower needed to neutralize the target (see the sidebar \"Mission Kill\"), then I estimate the enemy's Mix and Match do serious damage to a convoy a tank platoon, or even a hardened bunker.

Next, I look for an aircraft that can carry the necessary ordnance and survive the estimated return fire. Overall, these decisions are highly subjective and are based mostly on experience. Review the available intelligence, then listen to your gut. The more missions you plan, the more you'll learn Being an engineer, I've found simple mathematics helpful with mission planning. While you'll undoubtedly want to develop your own system, I often apply numerical values to individual weapons, based on range and firepower. I also assign point values to individual targets. This helps me assess priorities against my capabilities. In some cases, if one particular target greatly out-valles another I may even pull my forces and concentrate only on the high-value target (although I'm sure my superior officers would not be pleased). PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT Use the quick mission generator to practice mission planning, Timing Is Everything Once you've allocated your forces, you then must decide how to get them to the target and back. Timing is crucial, especially if you send multiple flights against a single target. Realworld Apache pilots have told me that they're expected to reach each waypoint within 30 seconds of the assigned time. Fortunately, LONGBOW 2's mission planning interface lets you manipulate the Time On Target (TOT), the time at which a given helicopter should reach its target. In the planning interface, right clicking on any waypoint displays statistics about that waypoint. \"Toward the bottom of the information box you'll see the time the helicopter is expected at that waypoint plus a \"loiter\" item. If you're having trouble coordinating the timing between flights, adjust the loiter values at various waypoints for the faster flights. To test your timing, use LONGBOW 2's \"rehearse\" feature. This walks through the mission at increased speed, displaying the positions of the various aircraft as time progresses. This substantially eases the task of coordinating multiple aircraft. A simple typo when entering an airspeed value can ruin even the best combat plan. By using the rehearse feature you can quickly identify and correct such errors. LONGBOW 2 has a very comprehensive mission-planning interface. It gives you a lot of options, but it also forces you to make some hard decisions. Since no real lives are at stake, don't be afraid to experiment. Always evaluate the results of each mission, especially missions that don't work. These guidelines will get you started, but, in the long run, there is no substitute for experience nyone remotely associated with aerial combat has undoubtedly heard the adage, \"A kill's a kill.\" In other words, it really doesn't matter how you did it, it just matters that whatever you did worked. As an extension of that concept, it's not always necessary to actually destroy the enemy target. Considering that the target has some objective of its own, simply preventing it from achieving that goal may be good enough. For example, a bomber forced to drop its payload and return to base before attacking friendly forces would be a mission kill. Although you didn't manage to shoot it down you did prevent it from shooting any of your allies. Obviously, it's better to actually destroy the bomber than to let it escape. Otherwise, it'll make another attempt against you tomorrow or the next day. Still, you kept your allies alive today. Perhaps tonight they'll capture the bomber's base! Conversely, you must guard against becoming a mission kill. En route to your target you'll likely encounter numerous other targets of opportunity. Destroying extra enemy targets is obviously a good thing-as long as you still accomplish your primary mission. It may be tempting to lob a few Hellfires at a particularly annoying SAM site, but before firing verify that you will still have enough ammo left to destroy the primary target. If the convoy carrying chemical weapons escapes while you're screwing around, you may survive the mission but you were ineffective. You just became a mission kill. THE LITTLE GUNS Don't assign two Longbows when an OH-58 Kiowa Warrior will suffice. APRIL 1998 CGW "

"STRATEGY & TIPS: QUAKE IN GAMER'S EDGE The Tool Box hile I'm not generally a fan of using specialized equipment for games, I encourage anyone who wants to maximize his or her mousing pleasure to follow the advice I got from Dennis \"Thresh\" Fong: Get 3M's Precision Mousing Surface (www.3M.com). No, it won't make you as good as the legendary Thresh, but it will vastly improve mouse tracking accuracy. It's a bit expensive for a \"mousepad, but it's simply the best I've tried. No more of that dreaded rodent stutter or skipping that will get you killed in the heat of battle. Unless you have an incredible set of speakers, you're better off with a pair of good headphones. The environmental noises provide so much useful information. In QUAKE II, you need to use your eyes and your ears. Don't be afraid to use macros and config files. Almost all good players personalize the mouse and keyboard configurations. It costs nothing, and can maximize your performance. LIGHT UP MY LIFE Most of the weapons will give away your position with noise and light. Surprise unsuspecting victims by tossing hand grenades. your opponents shoot back, you can still dic. If your opponent has the Quad Damage, you can still duke it out...just be careful to avoid getting hit, because it will hurt a lot more. switching, Fumbling for a better gun in the middle of a gunfight will likely get you fragged. This also means that you want to use a weapon with enough ammo to last through the fire-fight. If your favorite gun is low on ammo, seriously consider using another one that's fully loaded. For many players, the rocket launcher is the favorite weapon. Direct hits are quite deadly: and near misses still inflict splash damage. During melees, expert Death Matchers often do not aim directly at the victim. Instead, they aim at the enemys feet to guarantee that each shot hurts. Remember, if the rocket sails lwy completely, you've not only wasted a shot, but you've also given the target a shot at you. Another benefit to using explosives against others is that the blast spoils their ability to return fire. Cetting knocked around can sure mess up your aim and scramble your brains. Explosives are also quite handy for testing suspicious doors and corners for ambushes. If you face someone who likes to duck around a doorway or corner to turn the tables on pursuers, simply fire a rocket so that the blast flushes the trickster from the hiding spot. Onc of my first kills against the legendary Dennis \"Thresh\" Fong hiappened this way. Another important aspect of QUAKE II DeathMatches is the Quad Damage power-up. Quad Damage is an item that quadruples the damage your shots inflict. Too many players mistakenly equate the Quad Damage with Invulnerability, and act accordingly Although Quad Damage can make you more lethal, it does not offer extra protection. If Catching Air Rocket-jumping has evolved from a bizarre novelty to a «must-have» move in the accomplished DeathMatchers repertoire. The basic concept remains the same: Run forward, look down at your feet, jump, and then launch a rocket directly into the ground beneath you. Because this move will hurt you, be sure to load up on health and armor. QUAKE II adds new wrinkles: You can no longer change direction in mid-flight. Plus, being right or left-handed will affect your trajectory. I prefer to stick with center-handedness for truer flight. Variations of the rocket-jump include the grenade-jump (hopping onto a live grenade) and the barrel-jump (shooting the explosive barrel beneath you). Extreme variations include the grenade/rocket-jump (rocketjump in tandem with grenade jump) and barrel/rocket-jump (rocket-jump combined with barrel-jump). Quad I GOT THE BLUES Just because you have Quad Damage doesn't mean you are invulnerable. Don't get too cocky. APRIL 1998 CGW "


"STRATEGY & TIPS: QUAKE IT GAMER'S EDGE Playing With Their Minds SHOOTS AND LADDERS Instead of using the \"down\" or \"crouch\" key to descend a ladder, simply use \"mouselook\" to look down and then run down the ladder. Arguably the big daddy of all jumps is the BFG-jump, reportedly first perfected by id programmer John Cash. The BFGIOK packs a wallop. On the Outer Base (the very first QUAKE II level), a BFC-jump from the rocket launcher spot can fling you to the top of the builling, so you can get a better view as the drop ships fly by. Although a BIG-jump will hurl you much farther than a rocket-jump, it also takes a bigger bite out of your health. BFG-jumps typically inflict over 100 points of damage, so be sure to wear lots of armor. Then there is \"lava-skipping.\" According to designer Tim Willits, it's possible to use the more realistic plysics in QUAKE II to traverse lava. Although I lack the skill and luck required for lavaskipping, Willits says that you can hop atop grenade blasts to keep from sinking into lava. Again, you'll want plenty of health and armor to survive this antic. sychops. That's the official military mumbo-jumbo term for using all sorts of nasty tricks to outwit your adversaries. Many QUAKE tactics carry over well into QUAKE II. A classic new tactic is to scare a jittery opponent by using a chain-gun to hose them down in a tight corridor. Always cover your ass. If you must retreat, try to run backwards so you can keep your guns on your pursuer. Toss grenades to discourage pursuit. Think twice before picking up weapons or items that you don't need. A clever player will notice missing goodies, and may be able to track you as if you left a trail of bread crumbs. QUAKE II adds the ability to selectively drop items. This feature forms the basis for what Tim Willits calls the \"bait the sucker\" ambush. Most players have an uncontrollable pack-rat habit of collecting any weapon or item in sight. Willits will drop one of his less powerful weapons (or a big one that's out of ammo), and then hide in a vantage point with his crosshairs trained on the bait. As soon as someone attempts to scoop it up, Willits rewards the sucker with a railgun slug to the noggin. Indeed, QUAKE II adds new PsychOps possibilities to the DeathMatch cauldron. To the veteran warrior, noises reveal much information. Indeed, the hard-core insist on wearing headphones to better identify and pinpoint tell-tale noises. Slogging into and out of water alerts everyone within earshot as to exactly where you are and what you're doing. While running makes you harder to hit in a fire fight, running when there's no threat of attack is a bad idea. The din from your scurrying feet can give away your location and direction of travel. However, you can also use noise to fool others. When no one is in sight, jump once or twice. When others hear the grunting but can't get a fix on your position, they may be confused into thinking you're somewhere that requires jumping. Similarly, fake a ride on an elevator or lift. Simply step on to activate it, then quickly step off and hide somewhere to ambush the person who intended to ambush you. You can also draw someone into an ambush by feigning lack of ammo. Switch to the feeble blaster, and fire enough shots at the target to convince him that your better guns are out of ammo. As the victim comes in for the kill, switch to something with cloul and shoot. This tactic, of course, requires good timing, due to the delay in weapons switching. Parting Shots Don't fret if these pointers and tactics don't feel comfortable at this point. You will naturally incorporate many of them into your style of play as your skill and experience grow. In the end, there's only one real rule: Superior firepower may not bring happiness, but it sure helps! For more DeathMatch tips, see next month's strategy guide.

The initial strategy suggest is to spread out quickly and rush independent towns in the very beginning of the game. The powerful Vikings are perfect for this strategy WAR AND PEACE Build mines, factories, and markets to get your economy going, but also start training troops for early conquest. Attacking Early Early in the game, improve your town with the appropriate buildings (mine, factory, market), but also gear up your forces for war. Cet eight men into your fort as soon as possible. Once you have a group of eight men with 25 combat, go on the warpath. (As soon as the first ciglit soldiers sally forth from your fort, add eight more to train for future campaigns.) Pick a close, independent village and lead the charge against it with your king. This early in the game, independent villages have low populations and only a few, poorly trained men to fight against your conquering force. After this initial conquest, don't let up. Promote one or two soldiers to the rank of general. Have one stay at your newly-conquered town, and send the other with your battle-hardened troops to take another independent town. (Send your king back to your hometown for rest if he gets too badly injured.) Repeat this process and take a few more independent towns. You must establish a foundation for a large empire. This carly in the game, there should be little negative impact on your reputation, since it's low to begin with. there is an casier method. Keeping a town busy will make it more amenable to your rule. First, build a connected fort next to the town. This allows you to grant money, levy taxes, and draft villagers for work Promoting a same-nationality general after the town's loyalty is repaired will also increase loyalty. After the fort is built, give the people as many money grants as you can afford, in order to raise their loyalty above 50. The effects of grants are only temporary, 'lo permanently raise loyalty, you'll have to give the people things to buy and work to do. Build a market and have caravans begin delivering goods there for sale. A healthy stockpile of goods to buy does wonders to increase a towns loyalty.

Autosliding not only lets you maintain direction and speed, it also lets you keep your sights set on your target while going around it, rather than making you attack head-on. Thierry Nguyen TOMB RAIDER II aving a hard time getting past the beginning of 40 Fathoms? This is one of those puzzles that requires some fast thinking. We'll leave the rest of the level up to you, but here's how to get past the beginning: As soon as the level begins, turn around and swim to the bottom, until you see some debris on the floor.  Follow this trail of debris to the wrecked ship, and make sure to go for the open hold (where the anchor is near the back of the ship).  Go into the hold, and make your way to the surface to take a breather. Now take care of the shark that's been hounding you all this time and go explore the rest of the level. -Thierry Nguyen CGW APRIL 1998 "

Plus, when a building blows up, all infantry in that building go down with it. it's bad enough that Chimeras have poor armor. But, what's worse, Chimeras' guns are so bad that their shots will ping off even Ork armor-while the Chimeras die in the return fire. Leave them at home. If you want to survive, think defensively. Specifically, entrench whenever you can especially since it costs nothing to unentrench when you are ready to move out. Samuel Baker II Sports FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO '98 ven after you've installed the new patch (trust me, you need it!), there are wa number of \"features\" in FPS '98 that you can take advantage of, particularly when you're on defense. Oddly enough, with the newer ball physics, it's easier to knock a pass down at the line of scrimmage than in FPS FOOTBALL '97. Even a defensive lineman with poor speed can wreak havoc on your opponent's passing gameparticularly passes over the middle-provided that he has clecent Agility and good Endurance. When playing against a good roll-out quarterback, you can often get away with the Run Outside audible, especially on third-and-five or so. The computer opponent in FPS '98 is better at picking up Mad Dog and other linebacker blitzes, so use those only as a change of pace. But if you take the time to design your own safety blitzes in tandem with a fake LB Blitz, you'll rack up tons of sacks, and your cornerbacks will feast on more weak, hurried tosses. Terry Coleman COURTSIDE College BASKETBALL COURTSIDE COLLEGE BASKETBALL If your team doesn't look like a lock for the Final Four, there are a few tricks you can try in this old stat-based favorite from Lance Haffner: When setting up a game, always choose the \"coach and select shots\" option, with shooting percentages visible. This allows you to take shots outside of the normal offensive pattern-particularly helpful if you have a player who has trouble creating his own open shot, but who is adept at drawing fouls (think early Patrick Ewing at Georgetown). Once you get key opposing players in foul trouble, put your free throw specialists in and work the clock. While this strategy obviously works best with a lead, it can help keep a weaker team from being blown out early--especially when you are playing at home and have the crowd behind you (a feature thoughtfully integrated into the game's design). If you like to play at a fast pace, but your team has relatively low Fatigue ratings. don't despair. Play aggressively with your bench (Run & Jump Press works well against all but the best ballhandling teams), knowing that when one of your scrubs fouls out, other players will get a slight positive endurance boost to compensate Later versions of Courtside have an undocumented feature: Instead of hitting the #1 key to take a shot, try hitting the #14 key. If you are lucky, you'll be rewarded with a three-point attempt. Warning: this trey should be attempted only by really good shooters, or saved for when you're truly desperate. -Terry Coleman APRIL 1998 CGW "

"HALL OF FAME WELCOME TO THE COOPERSTOWN OF COMPUTER GAMES. Here you'll find, raised upon pedestals, the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. PANZER GENERAL (SSI, 1994) A truly fun wargame with an elegant interface. great campaigns, strong Al, good graphics, and impressive sound ALONE IN THE DARK (I-Motion, 1992) Lovecraftian horror gocs 3D, with shifting camera angles adding to the creepy atmosphere BATTLE CHESS (Interplay, 1988) The Franklin Mint of computer chess games with violent and funny animation disguising a solid chess engine. BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR (Dynamix, 1993) As rich and imaginative as Raymond Feist's world itself its 3D perspective was fresh, CHESSMASTER (Software Toolworks, 1986) The Cadillac of castling, this chess masterpiece gets better with each version, DUNGEON MASTER (FTL Software, 1987) Trend-setting graphics, digitized stereo, and great hack and slash from a decade ago. New Inductees! Command & Conquer Westwood Studios/Virgin, 1995 In the last two years, no gaming genre has risen to such huge prominence as real-time strategy games. Today, more and more companies are rec. ognizing that real-time games deliver the combination of intense action and quick-thinking strategy that millions of gamers crave. None of this--the commercial and critical success of the genre, the number of devotees, the innovative gameplay--would have been possible if it weren't for Westwood Studios and its million dollar success, COMMAND & CONQUER. While Dune Il established the genre and developed a loyal following, COMMAND & CONQUER cemented the dominance of real-time strategy games. It's success was no aberration. It delivered great gameplay, innovative features (such as unit groupings) that are still copied, and multiplayer mayhem. With two different sides and a good multimedia storyline, Westwood succeeded in crafting a compelling single player experience that was eminently replayable. Gamers built bases, harvested ore, drafted massive armies, and warred against computer and human opponents in fast-thinking, intense games of mental and mouse agility. In 1995, that experience was nearly exclusive to COMMAND & CONQUER. Today, we have a huge field of more advanced real-time strategy games from which to choose, and we have Westwood's COMMAND & CONQUER to thank for it RED BARON (Dynamix, 1990) wwi air combat with great graphics, incredible realism, and a versatile replay feature Sio MEIER'S CIVILIZATION (MicroProse, 1991) CGWS #1 tated game of all time; indescribably addictive world conquest exploration game Sio MEIER'S PIRATES (MicroProse, 1987) Combines pirate adventure, action, RPG, and strategy to make the most successfullybrid of all time SID MEIER'S RAILROAD TYCOON (MicroProse, 190) SimCity meets 1830 with robber barons for emphasis SIMCITY (Maxis, 1987) Urban planning with fascinating consequences and challenges; the first great software toy STARFLIGHT (EA, 1986) Depth, great characters, and a good sci fi storyline set early standards for RPGs. THE BARD'S TALE (EA, 1985) Pioneered three-point animation, 3D color mazes, and automapping THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND (LucasArts, 90) Comedy adventure that set new standards in writing quality and social sensitivity THEIR FINEST HOUR (LucasArts, 1989) Wwil sim with great campaigns and crew member options some current sims lack DAY OF THE TENTACLE (LucasArts, 1993) Offbeat sequel to Marc MANSION; the interactive equiv. alent of a classic Chuck Jones cartoon DOOM (id Software, 1993) Revolutionized PC action games and network gaming surpassed in technology but not gameplay EARL WEAVER BASEBALL (EA, 1986) Revolutionary physics based baseball game that pleased both action and statistics fans. EMPIRE (Interstel, 1978) wwil in space, this mainframe transplant brought elegan! mechanics, depth, and unending replayability to the PC. F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER (MicroProse, 1988) A \"thinking man's sim, with great missions, in which sneaking around is as fun as dogfighting FALCON 3.0 (Spectrum HoloByte, 1991) Tough, detailed jet sim with ambitious Al.graphics, and connectivity to match its realism. FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO (Dynamix, '93) Physics-based system, good Al, and unmatched career play make this the ultimate in pigskin play GETTYSBURG: THE TURNING POINT (SSI, 1986) First variable order of battle changed the look of all American Civil War games on the PC. GUNSHIP (MICROPROSE, 1989) Great character continuity, R&R for fatigued pilots, and even sick leave HARPOON (360 Pacific, 1989) In-depth modern naval battles in real-time, based on Cold War lears KAMPFGRUPPE (SSI, 1985) Armored warfare on WWII's Eastern Front offered engaging battles on multiple platforms King's Quest V (Sierra On-Line, 1990) Redefined the graphic adventure with non-text based parser and VGA graphics LEMMINGS (Psygnosis, 1991) The lovable cartoon Lilliputians were real-time hits on every platform LINKS 386 PRO (Access Software, 1992) Topped the leader board in graphics and realism. M-1 TANK PLATOON (MicroProse, 1989) Realistic sim that properly focused on armored forma tions rather than single vehicles: good mission designs. MechWarrior 2 AGENSION Activision, 1995 s was the case with COMMAND & CONQUER, SIEROWARRIOR 2 MECHWARRIOR 2 didn't create its genre, but you could say it legitimized it. MECHWARRIOR 2 established the idea of a giant robot simulation.\" From its serious treatment of Mech design and resource man agement to its complex and addictive battles, MECHWARRIOR 2 set a benchmark that still stands today. Never before had a robot sim demonstrated enough detail and perceived realism to make a believable, completely engaging gaming experience. MECHWARRIOR 2's incredible realism was one of the things that led CGW to splinter \"Space Simulations\" from Simulations as a separate genre unto itself. One of the game's pioneering elements was NetMech, which allowed Mech pilots to battle each other online at no charge. Even the designers had to be pleasantly surprised when scores of clans appeared online and began battling for their clan's honor. People even went so far as to go online and debate as to whether the performances of certain fictional weapons were accurate or not! In an industry known for shooting-star titles that become obsolete in months, it's amazing that MECHWARRIOR 2 hasn't had a contender come close to upsetting it in the two years since its release. Only time will tell how long MECHWARRIOR 2 will reign supreme in the fighting robot sim arena, but one thing is certain-all future robot sims will be judged against the tremendous technical and commercial achievements of this Hall of Fame classic. TIE FIGHTER (LucasArts, 1994) Most satisfying Star Wars space combat game to date lets you live on the dark side ULTIMA III (Origin Systems, 1983) Coherency and surprising subtlety emphasized role. playing, and set the tone for later ULTIMAS ULTIMA IV (Origin Systems, 1985) High concept RPG explored meaning of virtue and put the ROLE in role playing ULTIMA VI (Origin Systems, 1990) This RPG as morality play paved way for ULTIMA ONONE'S fealistic environs and objects. ULTIMA UNDERWORLD (Origin Systems, 1992) The first truly 3D RPG, and still the most convincing, its dungeon walls were nicely painted with texture mapped graphics WAR IN RUSSIA (SSI, 1984) More realistic than EASTERN FRONT, it captured the essence of the largest land campaign in History WASTELAND (Interplay, 1986) Derived from Mike Stackpole's Mercenaries, Spies, and Private Eyes, this is the definitive postapocalyptic RPG. WING COMMANDER (Origin Systems, 1990) A hot spaceflight engine, unfolding story path, and great characters WING COMMANDER II (Origin Systems, 1991) Darker story. grittier feel, sound card advances, and tougher Al made this a sequel of sequels WING COMMANDER III (Origin Systems, 1994) Surprisingly satisfying FMV space opera didn't lose the essence of the space combat game WIZARDAY (Sir-Tech Software, 1981) Defined the computer RPG with maze based viewpoint and atmospheric spell names. WOLFENSTEIN 3-D (id Software, 1992) Smooth scrolling action blastest cleverly updated the Original and put shareware back on the map. X-COM (MicroProse, 1994) Premier tactical squad-level engine combined with alien tech research and pop culture ZORK (Infocom, 1981) The progenitor of adventure games on the PC, its humor and challenging puzzles seem timeless MASTER OF MAGIC (MICROPROSE, 1994) The atmosphere and variety of MAG.C: THE GATHERIG with the sophistication of CIVILIZATION MASTER OF ORION (MicroProse, 1993) Remarkable diplomatic Al; deep and varied technology tree, aliens required radically different playing styles. MECH BRIGADE (SSI, 1985) Modern armored battles with improved KAMPEGGUPTE System and more realisi MIGHT & MAGIC (New World Computing, 1986) First-person, maze based RPG with huge environment and tough tactical combat M.U.L.E.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what chwor, What's the Deal With... The Death of FMV? Olt weak, and PHANTASMAGORIA 2 would still have been juvenile porno-horror tripe even if they had been using a networkable holographic imaging sys tem with a thumbs up from God. On the other hand, GABRIEL KNIGHTS 1 & 2 were equally brilliant, one in FMV and one in the traditional format. No, the real weakness of FMV runs deep into the current standard espite the emergency cardiac stimulation that will be provided to FMV by the shiny new DVD drives in our computers, I think it's pretty safe to say that we are nearing the last days of Full Motion Video as a viable gam ing medium. While this is hardly news, it's important to take a moment and reflect on why FMV failed. On the surface, it seemed like a nice extension of the whole adventure game concept. I mean, after all, wasn't the whole \"move your guy around the screen and click on hotspots\" motif just dying for real actors instead of sprites? Funny enough, the answer was \"no,\" but the reasons for that are a little more subtle than most designers are willing to admit. People tend to choose the worst of the form to justify the premise that the whole concept is a waste of money. Ol' Ken Williams had no trouble last year claiming that FMV was just not working out for Sierra. Of course this was something of a red herring, because what wasn't working for Sierra was the writing in its games, not the medium. Here's a news flash: There is one excellent horror writer under Ken's command at Sierra, and she doesn't share the same last name as Sierra's former CEO. PHANTASM AGORIA would still have been a little ( All FMV does is reduce your gaming rig to a very expensive and precise VCR. had no idea what \"Smash guy with painting of king\" meant; but the lack of freedom wasn't constantly pushed into your face, as it is with FMV. W hen adventure gaming went graphical, you knew in your heart of hearts that your options had been cut down a bit, because nobody had the time to animate all the dumb things you wanted to do. But the sheer thrill of actually seeing what everything looked like and of actually hearing the dialogue-more than made up for the lack of control, at least initially. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for FMV. While it is kind of cool to watch real people act when you click the mouse, it's just not enough to cover up how narrow your gaming universe has become. The problem is that we can't help but know that they haven't filmed the equivalent of three or four movies so we can stick our hero's arm in the toilet, just for the hell of it. Any sense of exploring a virtual world is replaced by simply casting about for a limited number of hotspots and seeing what two or three possibilities have actually been filmed. Video just cannot provide the freedom that coded graphics can (and do) provide And, in reality, all FMV does is reduce your gaming rig to a very expensive and precise VCR. I would think that we'll be seeing the evolution of full-3D simulated adventure environments (like those found in DARK EARTH and BLADE RUNNER) long after the bottom drops out of the blue screen market. Real fans of FMV shouldn't throw themselves on their swords quite yet, of course; some great titles will probably always be made, such as Tex MURPHY or the WING COMMANDER installments, not to mention excellent experiments like PSYCHIC DETECTIVE. The final nail in the coffin of FMV for me personally was watching a demo for Interplay's new Star Trek game, VULCAN FURY. Seeing those beautifully rendered graphic versions of Kirk, Spock, and the gang in their prime, jockeying around in that classic Enterprise, I thought, \"This is what I want! Not old guys with girdles (or even worse, newfangled, limp wristed Next Generation characters), but the o ld characters I knew and loved-just in new adventures.\" Time can't harm a good sprite. That's the real trouble with FMV: Reality often bites, and computer games can be so much more. Why hobble games with aging actors, expensive sets that still look shoddy. and not much more freedom than you can find with a VCR remote?! hope FMV will remain an interesting footnote in gaming, somewhat akin to all those funky things the French were doing with film in the late 1800s, which were interesting but just never caught on. I also hope that all that Hollywood money can start going into advanced graphics, better writing, and voice actors who can really act. we ca of adventure games, which is why these games lent themselves so well to video. It's all about freedom-and the lack thereof. Remember back in the prehistory of computer gaming? Back when CRYSTAL CAVERNS and ZORK were almost the only games in town? Now, as limited and basic as those games could be at times, they did strive to create the illusion that the player was in control.
