"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Mindscape and Philips are listing the basic memory requirements on their most recent products (SAVAGE WARRIORS at 580K basic memory and CHAOS CONTROL at 550K basic memory, respectively). QQP's ZIG-ZAG and PERFECT GENERAL II do not specifically list basic memory, but they do indicate that you will need 3 MB of extended memory to operate. Gamers also want the labels to indicate whether EMS or XMS is necessary. It is tremendously frustrating to be partially through the installation process and discover that this is a DOS/4GW game which cannot even install with EMS resident. Gamers would be ecstatic if they could count on this type of information, but most publishers simply do not provide it at the present time. Fortunately, even though we aren't seeing a lot of games which mention basic memory requirements or type of additional memory suggested, we are seeing a growing trend in labels which provide both minimum and recommended requirements for running their games. Most CGW readers know they'd better have the recommended listing if they want decent performance, but there are always those gamers who want to test both their and their machine's limits by challenging those minimum requirements. The new labels provide an easy-to-understand guideline for those of us who do not want to be hardware-challenged when we play a new game. Better news is that recent games from Domark, Interplay, Mindscape, and QQP all list the footprint for required hard drive space. If everyone provided this information, you'd rarely be frustrated to see, after getting most of the way through an installation, a message that there isn't enough room on your hard drive. Better days seem clearly on their way. Here's hoping that more people join the \"truth in labelingÂ» bandwagon.

PBEM was an improvement over U.S. \"Snail\" Mail PBM games where you would send in your moves on a postcard and wait anxiously for your moderate to adjudicate all those moves and get back to you. Most play-by-mail (PBM) games were lucky to handle one or two moves per month.

Today, Jim Dunnigan's 100 YEARS WAR allows multiplayer system. Eleven drivers were competing you to input moves every day and many networks alat Bristol Raceway with full damage on. low you to play strategy games live without having to batch process moves. The chat room fantasy games evolved into textbased role-playing systems like ISLAND OF KESMAI, GEMSTONE III and LEGENDS OF FUTURE PAST. This was a natural evolution from the \"Guess The Parser\" text adventures being published by many companies, but it was difficult to compete with the still graphics and later animated graphics which Sierra On-Line was beginning to put into their boxed games. Even today, some of these pure text games survive because on-line games offer a human element which stand-alone adventures cannot provide. Yet, gamers want it all good looks and personality. Today, that wish is beginning to come true. The graphics are better and the settings are richer. There are more services offering on-line games and, consequently, there are more gamers to encounter out there in the outlands of cyberspace. In the early days, no one would have dreamed of live action and simulation on-line. Today, no matter which type of game you prefer (action, adventure, role-playing, simulation, sports, strategy or wargame), something new is happening on-line for you. DOOM DESCENDING (ACTION) Action gamers will be able to expand their conquests of two classic confrontations into the on-line world. Through the new Dwango network (1-8002DWANGO), DOOMers and HERETIC players can go head-to-head against up to three of their virtual enemies (prices range for $3.90 for two hours through a month with no-limit at $32.50). Via Genie (1-800638-9636), action gamers will be able to participate in a multi-player version of DESCENT. A bit further into the future, STAR CRUISER, an action/strategy space game with simulation elements, should be available on the Multi-Player Game Network (MPGN). STAR CRUISER has been a long time in coming, since it has 36 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. SEPTEMBER 1995 "


"to overcome those infernal latency problems (the delays between typing a command and seeing its result on-screen) faced by so many on-line systems. If the developers aren't careful, the network's JUDGMENT PHOENIX, another space game for that service (1-800-GET-GAME), just may beat STAR CRUISER to beta. Air Warrior 1.18 vs. Confirmed kill Since the folks at Kesmai have taken the improved graphics of Domark's Confirmed kill to heart, we thought it would be interesting to compare the graphics from the upcoming Air Warrior version with the current graphics of Domark's network furball. EXPLOSIVE EFFECTS AIR WARRIOR's smoke effect looks quite impressive, but CONFIRMED KILL'S tracer bullets look great, too. CONTEXT, SUBTEXT AND GRAPHICS (ADVENTURE/ROLE-PLAYING) The majority of on-line adventure games are still text-based. In addition to Modus OPERANDI (see p. 58) and FEDERATION (see p. 48), Richard Bartles' MUDII, which stands for Multi-User Dungeon II, is one of the most prominent. It is currently the only text-based game on MPGN. The adventure is played via a popup VT100 emulator which is superimposed over a typical MPGN pub (meeting room). From there, you can type \"Guestify\" and take a quick guided tour of all the locations within the game: the cottage, the Admiral Bombow Inn, important treasures of the land, a galleon which has been shipwrecked, and some dwarven mines. The tour is useful for mapping and will allow you to progress more swiftly through the rest of the game. Other classic text-based games are getting a bit of graphic chrome: GEMSTONE III for AOL (1-800-827-3338) will feature a colorful wrapping and the IsLAND OF KESMAI on CompuServe (1-800-848-8990) and Delphi (1-800-695-4005) is about to become the REALMS OF KESWA with new graphics under construction, ROK will run under Windows in its new incarnation Meanwhile, start-up company Mpath (with veteran game designers Dani Berry (nÃ©e Dan Bunten) and Brian Moriarty as principals) has solved some of the latency issues associated with on-line gaming via the Internet. Moriarty is working on a multiplayer adventure that he promises will be different from anything we've ever seen. Coming from the designer of LOOM, the first game to use a musical command line, that is an exciting promise. On a different note, nearing readiness for beta test is Fujitsu's WORLDS AWAY, an object-oriented, graphically enhanced descendent of HABITAT, LucasArts' original experiment in graphically-based telecommunity (on the old QuantumLink network and still available in Japan). WORLDS AWAY is supposed to enter open beta test on CompuServe before this issue hits the stands, but we haven't seen anything but prototypes as of yet. LONG DISTANCE CLOSE-CALLS Even distant targets look good in both Air WARRIOR and CONFIRMED Kill. COCKPIT COMPARISON AIR WARRIOR is opting for the bit-mapped cockpit, while Domark's design is streamlined for speed. DOGFIGHT (SIMULATION) AIR WARRIOR from Kesmai (available on CRIS II, Delphi and Genie) has been the most successful multiplayer on-line simulation to date, but with the entrance of Domark's CONFIRMED KILL into their theater of air war, the competition is getting keen. The classic AIR WARRIOR game is upgrading its look, refining the cockpit graphics and adding off-line missions to enhance the value of the upcoming Version 1.18. Meanwhile, the challenger, CONFIRMED KILL (http://infobase.internex.net:80/domark/ck/ck.html) has raised the ante on their graphics since our sneak preview in CGW#130, (pp. 30-32). Sim buffs of a different kind will be thrilled with the soon-to-be unveiled NASCAR RACING network from Papyrus. Although pricing has yet not been determined, some lucky beta testers have been able to participate in multiplayer races.

GEnie's 100 YEARS War is a text-based game of historical conflict designed by Jim Dunnigan, and it is expected to support a new graphic look in the near future.

Thus far, company executives have refused to comment, but it seems reasonable to look upon the GEnie version of DESCENT as an experiment. Also, developer rumors indicate that Electronic Arts and their Origin subsidiary may have something in the wings.

Unfortunately, as you mine those six different types of ore necessary to increase your fortune, you can spend an extraordinary amount of time sitting like a mother hen on a mineral lode, with nothing better to do than spinning the turret and watching for enemies as you extract the various metals.

The longer players spend in the zone, the more likely they are to have this recharging metal and the more likely they will be able to defeat you. TOHIER Despite these problems, ARMORED ASSAULT is a game that has potential. Like a lot of online games, it will probably undergo constant design changes and improvements. It is important to remember that this game is still in early Beta testing so that the structure of the game is really in flux. The designers are extremely open to suggestions and comments that will lead to the improvement of the game. Sadly, though, at this point the game suffers from a distinct lack of action. The design forces players to either enter an inequitable conflict with a stronger player or spend a lot of dead time sitting on the mother lode. Until the game grows to the point where it can offer more strategy or action, it will hardly be worth one's time to download the required front end.

To get to the threatened metroplex, you have the option of traveling across the map of the United States or accepting specialized training and movudge Dredd would feel right at home in the dark future of MinION HUNTER. He would recognize the huge, domed metroplexes separated by radioactive badlands which house outlaws, mutants and monsters in Lester Smith's game, based on his Dark Conspiracy role-playing universe. MPGN'S MINION HUNTER is an on-line strategy game for up to five players versus four computer opponents. It is based on the boardgame published by Game Designers Workshop and set within the same dark universe. Smith's original vision for the universe was that evil aliens from alternate dimensions were using the advanced scientific inventions and vast mental powers at their disposal to create chaos and confusion on the earth. The fact that these powers vaguely resembled certain archetypal monsters of earth's supernatural mythos only served to heighten the fear and confusion, heightening their probability of controlling the entire world. Interested readers can follow this plot in a delightful way by reading Michael A. Stackpole's Fiddleback Trilogy (A Gathering Evil, Evil Ascending, and Evil Triumphant, published by GDW), but this isn't required in order to enjoy the game. All you need to know is that the background inspired Smith to create a game universe where cyberpunk meets UFO conspiracies, with vampires, werewolves, evil spirits and interdimensional travel thrown in. In the game, you assume the role of a minion hunter-a combination private eye, supernatural detective and mercenary. Your goal is to track down and foil enough alien plots that civilization can survive relatively intact. As a character, your four main attributes are: Empathy, Combat, Contacts and Stalking. These attributes will affect your probability for Success in combat or escaping from combat. As you succeed in training and foiling your enemies, these attributes improve much like they would in a role-playing game.

The main reason for playing a game on-line is to interact with the other characters. To facilitate this, TDT has an easy conversational interfaceâjust type what you want to say, and it is broadcast to those characters within the game who would be within hearing distance. Unfortunately, in a game which graphically pushes the technological envelope for on-line games, that very strength can be a nightmare. The pace of the game is somewhat chunky, at best, even though it is attractive enough to make such concerns secondary. Yet, the appearance of other characters on-screen, the very thing most on-line gamers want to see, causes the game to work so hard to update the screen that it bogs down gameplay tremendously. This is not a serious problem when only one or two additional characters are onscreen, but it gets infuriating when multiple characters appear and begin talking within your virtual hearing. Obviously, this is not a horrendous problem while the game is in beta, but it is bound to be something of a problem when more and more gamers find out what a fascinating new kind of fantasy universe has opened. Patient gamers with speedy modems will easily overlook this difficulty because of the newfound richness of the game's universe. HERE BE DRAGONS THE DRAGON'S TALE has a few technological dragons of its own to slay before the game is finished, but when they've already pushed those boundaries back as far as they have, that shouldn't keep CGW readers from downloading a copy of the front-end software from GEnie, Delphi or CRIS and checking it out for themselves.

You see, I've always wanted to be the on-screen Humphrey Bogart, mixing characters from The Maltese Falcon through Casablanca and on to The African Queen.

Discovered in the mid-15th Century by Columbus and his brother Bartholomew (who later \"Christianized\" the natives in a most un-PC fashion), the island went from Spanish through French and British rule (after Waterloo, of course).

"XL ACTION CONTROLLER THRUSTMASTER FALCON 3.0 and U.S. NAVY FIGHTERS. Heavy throw resistance makes fingertip control almost impossible, and handle design may tire the hand with constant forward motion, so if you're not a jet jockey the WingMAN family is not your holy grail. Curiously, the WINGMAN features a throttle but no hat switch, while the EXTREME has two extra buttons and a hat, but no throttle. There are no plans as of yet for a Wingman Complete. Price $39/$69. FLIGHTSTICK/FLIGHTSTICK PRO From those adventurous souls at Thrustmaster comes their solution for multiple button-lovers on the cheap, the XL ACTION CONTROLLER. Featuring four buttons, a viewing hat, and a thick black fully-contoured handle, this latest Thrustmaster release has a number of things going for it Geared to cover most gaming genres, the XLAC is just fine for action/adventure and sports games. Flight sim fans will like its viewing hat, but the lack of a throttle makes it less air-worthy. It is not programmable except when used in conjunction with the more costly Thrustmaster WEAPONS CONTROL SYSTEM, nor should it be at this price, but it does sport a large throw with four discernible corners (great for calibration and physical orientation when in the heat of battle). Heavy-handed joystick bashers and race simmers may want to check elsewhere as the XLAC is astonishingly lightweight for its size, meaning the back end pops up quite often under full push. Nor are its guidance characteristics particularly smooth, lending an unwanted sense of \"digitalness\" during analog-type games. Price $39.95. CH PRODUCTS The CH joysticks have the same configurations as the Wingman products, save for one important distinctionâthey both come with on-board rotary throttles. These babies are not particularly new nor are they independently programmable, but CH Products has just dropped the retail prices on both and thrown in some shareware DOOM with the FLIGHTSTICK, and HERETIC with the FLIGHTSTICK PRO. The FLIGHTSTICKS have a good feel and are built to last. The fact is that the FLIGHTSTICK line continues to shine as just about the best joystick design and feel in the business, and that much doesn't ever seem to change. Price $59.95/$89.95.

"FIREBIRD HAPPINESS IS A WARM GAMEPAD ADVANCED GRAVIS The wild and multi-faceted PHOENIX was analyzed in these very pages just six months ago, and now there's another bundle of joy in the Advanced Gravis programmable joystick family, the FIREBIRD. Essentially a C action gamers might have more buttons than their console-based counterparts, but that doesn't mean they have any better control. The Sega Genesis, SNES and 3D0 controllers (whose roots lie with the 8-bit Nintendo system) are The Standard for action games. And it makes sense have you ever tried to play a game like NBA LIVE '95 with a FLIGHTSTICK PRO? Fortunately, PC joystick manufacturers are starting to get a clue. This year, some sophisticated PC-based controllers have begun to surface. Here are a few of the best. The device is ideal for 360 degree games like DeSCENT where you can streak about in contortionistic splendor (go ahead-try and pull off a \"figure eight\" with your mouse). The SPACEBALL is also particularly devastating in games like Doom, where you can literally run around an opponent while simultaneously directing fire upon him/it. With the right hand triggering the SPACEBALL AVENGER's six mappable buttons, and left hand manipulating the SPACEBALL Powersensor (a touch-sensitive tennis ball-sized directional orb attached to the unit's left side), the SPACEBALL AVENGER permits combined and/or synchronous moves that are beyond the capability of traditional control devices. Operating software includes a product tutorial that's almost a game in itself, and a convenient game launcher that must be accessed in order for the SPACEBALL AVENGER to activate with desired configuration. If you can put up with the learning curve, are willing to lose a serial port, and won't tire of manipulating that darn ball (it can get fatiguing), the SPACEBALL AVENGER is an interesting option for serious first-person gamers. Price $179. Gravis' Gamepad has long been the standard arcade controller. With a comfortable grip and four functioning (though slightly inaccessible) buttons, this has long been old faithful\" for many an action gamer. This is still a great pad, particularly for left-handers who can turn the thing upside down, flip a switch and play it their way. $24.95 PROPEDAL CHOCKS/PEDALS STD has taken the Gravis' concept a step further with their PC PRO PAD 4. By compacting the size of the controller a bit (similar to the Sega Genesis controller), they've mad the PRO PAD a little more comfortable than most. Four buttons are includedâthe PRO PAD'S size makes them easily accessible and auto-fire capaOCH PRODUCTS Last year, CH Products moved into the world of foot-controlled peripherals with their PROPEDALS. There was only one small problemâthat fore-aft movement so necessary for rudder control just wouldn't go away for racing games. This year, with by far the simplest product in this review, CH has solved that problem with the CH CHOCKS, a pair of rubber stops that, when inserted into the pedal cutaway behind each pedal support, kills the slide and leaves only the pivot. The CH CHocks are standard equipment with all new PROPEDALS, while current PROPEDAL owners can get a free set by contacting CH Products. For those light on their feet and light in the pocketbook, CH Products has just released a related product, the CH PEDALS. Distinct from the PROPEDALS by virtue of no fore-aft capability, these babies are a solid choice for race simmers, and an option for flight enthusiasts who don't mind pivoting as opposed to sliding. Price $139.95 (Pro)/$79.95. scaled-down version of its breakthrough daddy, the Firebird shares the same look, and many of the same features as its next-of-kin. The base has had that nifty left hand throttle/rudder appendage amputated, but other than that, things have remained pretty much the same. With a total of eight buttons and two rotary dials on the base and another seven buttons on the stick, the FIREBIRD retains its ability to map out just about every keyboard command in even the most complex of applications. As a matter of fact, the FIREBIRD'S software program even allows multiple keystrokes to be defined as just one button press. Like all programmable peripherals, the Firebird connects to the computer's keyboard port, and the keyboard is then plugged into it, with no special support required from the application. Gravis supplies preset configurations for 42 popular games, and each of these may be customized through the wondrous Windows-type graphical interface, or new ones may be started from scratch. The stick itself sports adjustable tension, and although it feels way better under working conditions than Gravis' ANALOG, ANALOG PRO or PC PRO sticks, it still has a \"clunky\" motion that may or may not bother picky users.

"combines easy-to-program keyboard emulation (simply hold down the joystick button and hit the also bears a striking resemblance to the Thrustmaster FLCS. The F-15E TALON, part of a new line of F-15 Joysticks, has a hulking base and an oversized black handle that reaches a gargantuan gaming enhancements as the Suncom TALON, with some interesting differences. For starters, the unit is fully functional with any steering device, thus ensuring compatibility even with simple joysticks, while the quasi-graphical front-end software guarantees quick and easy programming, thus ensuring compatibility even with simple joystick reviewers. Furthermore, the throttle itself functions in a sliding rather than pivoting motion, a purely user-preference sort of thing, but it doesn't incorporate the detent positions of the Thrustmaster unit. Although this was a feature I sorely missed while trying to outfox a bogey, the unit is not due for release until September and some revisions are possible. The CH THROTTLE is littered with buttons across the length of its horizontal handle so all the digits can get a workout, and the right side \"head\" is identical in shape and configuration to the FLIGHTSTICK PRO. There's a total of six buttons in all, one hat switch and a single two-way appropriate key) and a SNES-like grip, even including the \"R\" and \"L\" buttons on top. At $29.99, this is THE joypad for the sophisticated action gamer-it's nice to be able to play a game like DESCENT solely from a controller. $29.99 10 inches into folks must be doing something right (can you say \"mass marketing\"?). With the feel and look of a 3/4scale Thrustmaster F-16 FLCS, the Quickshot Skymaster features four fire buttons (including one for the little pinky), a hat switch and a rotary throttle. The similarity to the FLCS does not extend to programmability, and unfortunately the Skymaster hat and throttle cannot be used in conjunction with each other. It's either hat, throttle, or neither, but never both, and an underside switch says so. Top-mounted Xand Y-axis trims, a soft plastic boot over the handle/base joint, and a slip guard on the handle complete the amenities. The Skymaster feels just great in the air, with just enough resistance to be very natural. Be forewarned that a smallish base means the backside may lift off one's desk under full acceleration in racing games, and the circular pivoting motion results in an almost indiscernible line between forward and sideways, but fairly light resistance will suit most other applications. Price $69.99. the stratosphere. The TALON is home to four buttons and a pair of hats (that may each control four separate functions, if so desired), and it combines innovative elements and sturdy construction to fashion a pilot's digital dream. Programmable? Why, yes it is, but in a totally different manner than to what we've become accustomed. The Talon allows one to program up to 48 individual keystrokes right into the stick while immersed in a given game, without the need of accompanying software drivers or program compatibility. In English, that means any game with keyboard functions may have up to four dozen of those functions keyed into the stick, while in that application. Internal joystick memory ensures that configurations will remain intact even after the computer is turned off, and, if that isn't enough, the TALON may be switched on the fly back to standard four button stick configuration. Under working conditions, the TALON proves to be a tension-filled beast, with heavy resistance and smooth action. The feel is most definitely pro pilot, and without a doubt its charm is enhanced by little perks-go ahead, switch your weapons toggler from pinky to \"Hat 1 Left Position\" without even leaving the game. Wow! Price. $129.95 switch. Macro programming is part of the package. Price $99.95. F-16 THROTTLE QUADRANT SYSTEM THRUSTMASTER THROTTLE From what surely must be considered the premier flight sim peripheral maker comes the F-16 TOS (Throttle Quadrant System) programmable throttle. Designed to work in concert with the Thrustmaster F-16 FLCS programmable joystick, the TQS has six distinct buttons, including two 2-way switches, one 4-way switch, a pair of dials, a mini-trackball, and a variable tension adjustment. All this stuff is within easy reach on the head of the throttle handle, and can be used to activate anything your heart desires (in a game, smart guy), including commands, actions and macros that simply won't fit onto the CH PRODUCTS If CH Products isn't setting new standards, then they certainly seem to go where the going's good. In this case, they're headed straight towards Thrustmaster-dominated throttle-land.

The IDC Armrest Brackets consist of a pair of heavy-duty formed rubber slabs that, with the aid of flexible metal ties, affix firmly to the upright arm support of the common desk chair. A thick, metal plate rests atop this setup to which a joystick or equivalent (they're a custom fit for the Thrustmaster FLCS and WCS) is attached with cloth straps. Two full units come in a set, one for each side of the chair, and that metal plate may be quickly adjusted to any user de fined angle. As armrest brackets go, these things will seemingly stay in place forever, and their smart design means peripherals are strapped on, not glued or permanently velcroed. In all honesty, it was kind of nice to recline or swivel in my chair, and have my control devices come along for the ride. 'For gamers who prefer desktop extension, the IDC FLIGHT CONSOLE BRACKET clamps like a vice to any tabletop or long-lipped desk (at least three inches worth is required), and suspends the keyboard and a pair of control devices up and over your lap in mid-air. The peripherals are supported in much the same manner as with the ARMREST BRACKETS, and the keyboard sits in between (I'm typing on it as I write this).

They have enough power (10 watts per side) in the satellites to get obnoxiously loud at close range before distortion arises. The subwoofer, on the other hand, although powerful enough at 25 watts, begins to distort above half volume. Fortunately, half volume New Desktop Speaker Systems With Subwoofers And Satellites Pack A Punch by Gordon Goble OCC 'm the first to admit it-I may not be humble, but I am a trend-setter. I knew \"The Simpsons\" were great while they were still a mere speck on the Tracy Ullman Show, that Nirvana was a pretty cool band before Cobain died, and that typical \"multimedia\" packaged speakers have never really cut the audio mustard. Nor has the power output of the standard, sound card ever been anything more than passable, and that's why I dropped a couple of hundred bucks on a pre-owned set of Noor-standing Advent speakers and a Technics stereo receiver a long time ago. My walls were shaking to CoMANCHE: MAXIMUM OVERKILL when it came out, are still bouncing to NASCAR RACING and NHL HOCKEY today, and I've got AM/FM capabilities to boot. Geez, I'm cool. The typical audio solution these days is a powered set of speakers, but the stuff you'll find in computer mega-warehouses and as part of prepackaged systems usually features weak speakers and weaker amplification. Surely the galactic explosions of TIE FIGHTER, the hell-bent-for-leather roar of FuL. THROTTLE, the latest Chili Peppers cut, and even the spoken word deserve a better fate. This article, then, is aimed specifically at those who want a little more audio bang from their computing environment.

The totally independent power and volume between subwoofer and satellites can be a real advantage when you want to tailor or completely kill an aspect of the sound. This is also a minor disadvantage, as extra wiring and one more electrical outlet is needed for operation. All controls are conveniently placed on the front of both component types, and even a light kick will activate the subwoofer, while an automatic on/off function that \"senses\" approaching sound makes things even easier.

With 18 watts for the satellites and another 18 for the subwoofer, this system can get quite loud. Dual 4\" drivers in the subwoofer unit means no shortage of sound, but they can't produce the the deep bass tones present in both previous systems. Satellites produce an even range of frequencies from light bottom end to screeching highs. Not much here in the way of distortion unless volume is really cranked, but once again, as in the HTP International's, interior vibrations in the subwoofer become annoyingly noticeable at 12 o'clock and higher on the volume dial. The innovative \"pop-up\" design of the satellites permits some flexible placement options. The satellites also have a very functional range of frontmounted controls, which enable convenient audio to be desired. The power switch is located on the rear of the subwoofer, which means that just turning it on is inconvenient. Also, it is impossible to increase volume on one component without affecting the other, as there are no independent volume controls between subwoofer and satellites.

On the subject of power, be aware that some manufacturers use different wattage rating systems. Some companies will use \"peak\" rather than \"continuous\" output, thereby enhancing their stated performance in the eyes of the uninitiated. This sort of quasi-deception is perfectly legal, and it's not unusual to find a system advertised as packing 50 watts being brought to its knees by a 15 watt unit. Equalize the rating, systems if possible (look for \"RMS\"-âa standardized continuous power rating system) and listen before buying. Practice safe computingâbuy shielded speakers. Like an audio condom, shielding inhibits the magnetic field surrounding the speaker magnet (via another reverse-polarity magnet and/or punched steel surrounding the speaker magnet), and thus prevents damage to the monitor and nearby diskettes. Don't be fooled by smart marketing. Just because something looks great with a high tech wrapping, it won't necessarily sound better. Also, don't let buzzwords influence your decision.

"ViewSonic ViewSonic days, the phrase \"multimedia\" on the package often translates to \"We sell these ineffective speakers for inflated prices because the consumer can be fooled into thinking they're something special.\" Try not to restrict yourself to a small space for speakersâthere is no substitute for the bigger sound delivered by a bigger speaker, and especially in the lower frequencies, dinky just won't do. Most of the units reviewed here are threepiece systemsâtwo satellites that supply the mid-to-high frequencies and one subwoofer that pumps out the bottom end. The subwoofer is usually three to five times the size of the satellites, and although that means a larger space requirement, said subwoofer can be plunked down on the floor virtually anywhere. Since lowend frequencies are omni-directional, you won't need to worry that it faces this way or that just remember that the closer it is to a corner or wall, the more \"boom\" you'll get out of it. quite impressive. Sounds are suddenly \"out of the box\" and truly dimensional in space-you can \"hear\" the path of moving objects such as rockets in a game. The sense of 3-D these speakers generate will really enhance any gamer's sense of immersion The Vivid 3-D speakers are not overly powerful, yet deep wooden cabinets and rear ports add admirable bottom end to what are quite small but pleasant-sounding drivers. The control panel does not include treble or bass adjustments, nor is there a balance control, but it is heavy on spatial tailoring. Certainly the most innovative sound here. Price: $199.95.

One 4 3/4\" X 1 3/5\" mid/high driver and one 2 3/5\" low end driver in each enclosure, producing a frequency response of 40-20,000 Hz.

Tall, \"slim tower\" design with mounting bracket so entire unit may be \"strapped\" to monitor. VIEWSONIC The Viewsonic's tonal qualities, like the other speakers discussed here, are much superior to that of basic department store fodder. Their small lowfrequency driver produces a surprising amount of bottom end, but the sound is nowhere near the threepiece units. This system is very quiet, which means that either the stated amplifier output of 14 watts RMS is generous or speakers are extremely inefficient (ie, they do not convert supplied MY WISH LIST 'If I had the ability to create the ultimate multimedia speaker system, based upon this sampling, here's what I'd do. I would combine the sound characteristics of the NuReality VIVID 3-D tabletop speakers with the punch of the Jazz J688AV, the control configuration of the Yamaha YST-SS1010, and the power of the HTP International MM3 subwoofer (without the vibrations), Mmm, yes, I can hear it now... 76 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD SEPTEMBER 1995 "

"WINDOWS 95 EXPLOSION WIN 95 EXD Are AL1111 GER Wihov Dead? WNIOS Windows 95 Is Trying To Prepare The Eulogy WIROVA WEROWE WAROVS hen gamers ask if DOS games are dead or not, they want to know the answer to two different questions. First, will their entire game library become a relic of the past like their 8-bit Atari, Apple and C-64 games; and second, if they can expect the computer game industry to continue to publish DOS games. To paraphrase Monty Python and the Holy Grail, DOS games are \"not quite dead yet.\" In this issue, we show you how to run DOS games under Windows 95. That should answer the first part of the question. Next, we sneak preview some of the games to be released under Windows 95. The previews should provide some clues for answering the second part of the quesNo matter how solid an operating system's technical capabilities may be and no matter how much marketing buzz there is about a potential gaming platform, the bottom line for gamers will always be \"How are the games?\" Gaming history demonstrates this. The Atari ST was superior to the market-dominating Apple Il and C-64, but it didn't win. The Commodore Amiga was years ahead of the CGA-equipped IBM clone in color, sound and interface. It should have become the ultimate game machine, but it didn't. The 3D0 had technical wizardry of which the Sega Genesis could never dream, yet the superior machine never surpassed the dinosaur in market share. Macintosh lovers would even argue that their machine is far superior to Windows-based computers, but Windows is dominant in the marketplace. Actually, Windows is dominant in all but one area-computer games. Now, Windows 95 bears promise of shattering that last bastion of resistance. Industry insiders can talk and write about all the wonderful ways Win 95 will help game designers (see this issue's \"Hex, Bugs and Rock 'n Roll\" for details), but what the gamer wants to know is: \"What's it gonna do for me?\" and \"How are the games?\" That's what we wanted to know, too. So we offer six Sneak Previews this month of Windows 95 games. And we will have a special Win 95 Games section in September, October and November in hopes that, from the August launch of Win 95 to the opening gun of the holiday buying season, we will provide gamers with enough information to make up their own minds.

Initially there was a problem with EMS memory, because the default Windows 95 environment that was set up had very little EMS configured. We added QEMM 7.5 to Window 95's CONFIG.SYS file. This proved to be the right answer for BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR. After adding QEMM, everything ran smoothly. There was no apparent frame rate hit, even with detail cranked up and the step size set to \"small.\" Both MIDI and digital audio sounded terrificno stutters or static. SIMULATION: NASCAR RACING We encountered our first real problems with NASCAR Racing from PAPYRUS DESIGN GROUP. We just couldn't get the native Windows 95 environment to have enough low DOS memory to run the game at least, according to an error message generated by NASCAR. So we created a custom MS-DOS environment-a \"Virtual boot disk,\" which the Windows 95 Property Sheet editor refers to as the \"MS-DOS mode\" (note that the Windows 95 docuimentation also refers to MS-DOS mode as \"Single Applications Mode\"). This did the trick and NASCAR ran great as an MS-DOS mode program. In SVGA mode with all graphics options turned on the frame rate got a little choppy.

Sitting on the tarmac about to launch into my first combat mission, watched the engine RPM slowly spool up to \"idle power,\" or roughly 60%. With the wheel brakes still engaged I lowered the flaps and increased throttle to full military power. As waited impatiently for several long seconds while the engines slowly crawled to 100% power, the increasing thrust began pushing the nose downward.

At 340 kilometers per hour (kph) I pulled the stick back into my lap and crawled into the sky, Quickly I raised the gear and flaps but remained in afterburner; a nearby A-50 Mainstay AWACS had reported a pair of aircraft launching at a nearby airstrip and heading south towards Russian airspace.

It's extremely easy to fixate on the white smoke trails and forget that the missile is a virtually invisible dot speeding toward you.

These little touches significantly increase the Â«suspension of disbelief\" and improve the overall realism of the experience. Other games designed to simulate Russian aircraft often utilize fully Anglicized symbology and artwork, thus degrading the authenticity of the experience. Although retaining an air-to-ground capability, the Su-27 is primarily an interceptor. Accordingly, the avionics suite focuses on air-to-air combat. Of the six avionics modes, four focus on air-to-air combat, one focuses on air-toground targeting, and the last one is used solely for navigational purposes. Pilots familiar with FALCON 3.0's HFR, FLEET DEFENDER, or F-15 STRIKE EAGLE III will have little problem using Su-27's radar system. Although implementation obviously varies, the basic concepts of range, azimuth, and elevation remain consistent.

Although it won't take long to adapt to, players a little familiar with the Russian language will probably learn the cockpit faster than those who aren't.

Su-27's avionics suite falls somewhere between WIRIO E 103 ments, my scan hit pay dirt: a pair of contacts still over 100km out. Reducing the range on my MFD I began developing our intercept geometry. At 65km my R-77 radar-guided missile locked onto the lead aircraft. The Mis-, sile Envelope Indicator on the HUD indicated the targeted aircraft was just outside the R77's effective flight envelope. Bringing my aircraft to the right, I watched the small square representing the target slide inside the circle representing the missile's effective envelope. The radar lock apparantly betrayed our presence to the two aircraft, because they immediately turned hard right and directly toward us. Glancing at the HUD, I saw the target was flying at a mere 1500 meters and 500kph. We had altitude and airspeed over our potential adversary. Suddenly the image of a MiG-21, which served as my Radar Warning Receiver, lit up, our adversaries had radar-locked my aircraft. Still suspecting WM2 UND CODE AO OG Witows95 COMRADES IN ARMS Su-27 includes a wide variety of airto-air and air-to-ground ordnance. Besides powered weapons leaving smoke trails, all ordnance follows realistic flight paths. Many missiles make rapid, ballistic climbs while the motor runs and then dives onto the target. It's not uncommon to watch air-to-air missiles \"snake\" toward their targets. Weapons seem to enact a realistic penalty on their targets; however, for debugging purposes this particular beta version grants the player three lives, making it difficult to determine exactly how the damage model works. The final version, obviously, will grant the player only one life. The campaign engine was not completed at the time of this writing, but is best described as \"FALCON 3.0 on steroids.\" The size of the combat arena seems comparable (and is primarily centered on Crimea). Unlike FALCON 3.0, the player will have much more choice about their level of command. SU-27 will offer four levels of play: 1) training missions; 2) single missions assigned by the computer; 3) Squadron-leader campaigns requiring DON'T FLY WITHOUT YOUR ROSETTA STONE At first glance, this complex Russian cockpit, replete with authentic Cyrillic labels, may look intimidating. But after a few hours of flying you should be able to figure out how to use the instruments. WILLOWS FALCON 3.0 and Digital Integration's TORNADO. The level of instrumentation compares to TORNADO, while the avionics complexity compares to FALCON 3.0's HER (Hi-Fidelity) radar mode. The cockpit follows standard Russian instrumentation designs, which will also take some getting used to. Whereas most Western attitude indicators show the horizon, Russian equivalents display the LOCKED, COCKED, AND READY TO ROCK! A US F-16 loaded, quite literally, for Bear.

The missile climbed until the white contrail disappeared at which point I knew the motor had burnt out and the missile was now diving at the target About the moment my R-77 struck its target, more warning lights went off in my cockpit, the targets had returned fire. We were now less than 20km apart and I switched my HUD from DVB mode (long-range intercept mode) to BVB mode (close-range air combat mode). I saw a white streak climbing toward me from the surviving opponent and began releasing countermeasures. After a quick break turn, I watched the missile streak harmlessly past me. We were now within visual range and could easily identify the aircraft passing over my right shoulder; the surviving adversary was indeed an F-16! The Falcon broke into a high-G turn while I lit the afterburners and went vertical. I was nearly 2,000 meters above the F-16 and nearly over the top when it pitched up into me. Anxious to take a shot I pulled hard on the stick despite having lost considerable airspeed in the climb. With little warning my Flanker broke into an inverted spin. Ispun rapidly and disorientingly toward the earth, pulling out of the spin at approximately 500 meters. Hastily searching the sky, I found the F-16 chasing my wingman in a series of vertical loops. Igniting the afterburners again I pulled up into the F-16 and joined the chase. The F-16, apparently low on energy, wallowed above me. Obtaining a lock, I fired an R-73 and watched the IR-guided missile snake toward the Falcon. The American jet shook with an explosion as I watched its pilot eject. fil WINTOWSOS NUTS AND VOLTS So, how much CPU horsepower does all of this require?

That cultural deficiency can easily be taken care of, however, with STAR TREK: KLINGON, due from Simon & Schuster Interactive this fall. \"To learn about Klingons, you have to get inside their skin,\" says Keith Halper, the title's producer. To that end, the program will immerse humans in the Klingon culture-everything from the language to Klingon history, sociology, rituals, religious beliefs and the inner angst of these formidable creatures. The CD-ROM uses voice-recognition to teach around 100 Klingon phrases, including \"tihingan Hol Dajatlh'a\"\" (Do you speak Klingon?) and \"Hlja\" (yes). According to Halper, learning the nuances of the language is necessary in order to understand the Klingons, and he adds that the guttural harshness of the language depicts the Klingons as action-oriented beings. As you move through the world of STAR TREK: KUNGON, you enjoy the first-person perspective of a Klingon named Pok.

For instance, in the Language Lab (one of four sections on the CD), you'll be asked to identify such Klingon delicacies as a bowl of gakh (serpent worms). You may click on the image to hear the correct pronunciation or identify it by saying \"gakh\" to the computer. But STAR TREK: KLINGON doesn't just teach you the language. It also contains two hours of full-motion video, most of which was shot on Star Trek sets using actors from the TV series, along with various training simulations such as the Right of Ascension (a Klingon's passage into adulthood). One simulation even tests your social etiquette. A klingon approaches you in a bar. You say \"nuk nech\" (\"What do you want?\" or \"Hello\") and the Klingon says that he wants to sit down. You may click on a chair, inviting the other Klingon to sit, click on the Klingon's forehead to indicate an aggressive action, or simply do nothing. The latter is a sign of rudeness in Klingon culture (and of course, all Trekkers know how the noble Klingons value their polite, genteel reputation). STAR TREK: KLINGON is packaged with the Klingon Cultural Handbook in paperback. And to round your adenoids into shape for those tough Klingon consonants, two audio tapes are included. Power Klingon seems more suited to the galactic businessman, while Conversational Klingon is better for travelers who simply need to know how to find the restroom and order fresh gakh when vacationing on Kinszha.

And, by the way, you have no weapons...yet. Welcome to Absolute Zero, a game in which your raw ingenuity, fighting skills and quick thinking just might not be enough to keep you alive.

"THE OUTSOEHAMMERHEAD HAMMERING IT IN 122 In at least one respect, aerobatic flying is similar to stand-up comedy: Timing is everything. Pulling off maneuvers in FLIGHT UNLIMITED doesn't require lightning-fast reflexes, just a good feel for your plane and lots of practice. rings is suspended in the air over the landscape, which you have to fly through as quickly as possible. Miss a ring and you're hit with a time penalty. Four categories of courses present different challenges. The Trick category is amazingly tough-the only way to hit all the hoops is to pull off some very tough aerobatic maneuvers. Turn on the \"Ghost Plane\" and a wireframe plane flies the path of the best run recorded on that course, providing an innovative visual cue as to how close you are to beating the best time.  FBO FLY Here's a diagram of the outside hammerhead maneuver. Let's walk through it step by step. \"-os Just before vertical motion ceases, kick in full left rudder to push the plane over on its left wing. Use opposite aileron to keep the plane's wings in the plane of the pivot. Watch your reference line and use aileron to keep your wingtip perpendicular to it. VIEW TO A THRILL The virtual cockpit in the Pitts Special scrolls almost as smoothly as moving your head around in the real thing. For a more mellow challenge, try soaring in the Grob sailplane. Start in the air or try a towed takeoff with the help of the ubiquitous Ghost Plane. Once you've reached altitude, try to maintain or even increase it with the help of thermals and orographic lift (air blown upward along ridge lines) Push the stick forward until the plane is flying straight up. You'll want to use an outside view, the virtual cockpit, or the three-panel view so you'll be able to stop on the vertical. Continue the pivot until the plane's nose is pointed straight down. Hold the plane in this attitude for a few counts. 6 tudat EYE CANDY Every few years a sim comes along that lets reviewers use the \"sets new standards for graphicsÂ» clichÃ©, and FLIGHT UNLIMITED is the 1995 entry in this club. This is the first sim to deliver terrain graphics that truly look like what you see out the windscreen of a real plane, instead of the Bizarro World polygons or pixel-explosion texture maps used by its predecessors. The six terrain areas in Vermont, Maine, Virginia, Arizona, Alaska, and France are only 12 square miles in area, but they're cleverly tiled to provide an endless canvas for your aerobatic displays. Supported resolutions range from 320x200 through 1024x768, and terrain and aircraft detail is adjustable. A Pentium 90 is pretty smooth at 640x480, and abFirst, find a reference line in the terrain off your wingtip-you'll use this to maintain heading so you can pull out on a heading opposite the one you entered the maneuver on. Dive for speed, roll inverted, and you're ready to start As you near the altitude at which you started the maneuver, begin to push out to inverted level flight, watching the reference line off your wing. Your goal is to exit the maneuver at the same speed and altitude you came in on. 192 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. SEPTEMBER 1995 "

"REVIEW Confucius Confused Mah Jongg Meets Multimedia In SHANGHAI: GREAT MOMENTS by Bob Proctor ELL, SHANGHAI FANS, OUR OLD FAVORITE HAS GONE MULTIMEDIA. THE QUESTION that needs answering is, Â«Did SHANGHAI: GREAT MOMENTS succumb to a temptation or take advantage of a wonderful opportunity?\" As with most make-overs, some changes are good, some aren't so good. It is certainly very appealing visually, provided you have a powerful enough computer. RELAKO 100 CRISOR MAN WHO NEVER PLAY SHANGHAI NOT UNDERSTAND UNIVERSE If you've never played SHANGHAI, it's a solitaire game played with Mah Jongg tiles instead of cards. You remove pairs of matching tiles and if you clear the board, you win. Connoisseurs of solitaire know that the best games are the ones that make you think by giving you choices; SHANGHAI does this by having four of each tile. Often, three of the same tile will be available, and then there are three ways to take off a pair. Planning ahead pays big dividends!

"ring actress Rosalind Chao of The Joy Luck Club; and some very good new layouts. This would be an excellent introduction to SHANGHAI for someone who has been missing out. For those of us already addicted, however, the flashy graphics pale after a while. I personally miss the layout editor (a big step backward) and yearn for better statistical support. Knowing how my winning percentage with Icebreaker compares with that for the Classical Dragon layout would really extend my enjoyment of the game. Maybe in Shanghai IV?

At the other end of the spectrum, if you like to play fast and want the tiles to pop out of existence as fast as you can click, you may like older versions of Shanghai more.

"neighboring tribes. The Champion's Tent is basically a local pub, a hang-out for heroes who are passing through. You may try to recruit these heroes, challenge them to a duel, ask them for information or learn magic from them, depending on character class and level of experience. Your champions come in three classes: warriors, druids and bards. The druids and bards are magic-users, and can work their spells to good effect both domestically and in war. All your champions have a number of attributes and skills which will determine their ability to perform various tasks, and they can carry weapons, jewelry or magical baubles that will increase their likelihood of success. A battle ax, for example, increases a champion's Arms rating, which means she does more damage in combat; whereas a brooch increases her Charm rating, making her more likely to prevail in negotiations, trade and recruitment of new champions.

Although there are a host of diplomatic options available to you, the process of making peace is long and arduous, and can be extremely frustrating. Regardless of how hard you work to build trade and good relations with your neighbors, they will cheerfully attack you and bring your efforts to naught if you leave your border with them too lightly defended. On the other hand, going to war and pummeling other tribes into submission is quick and unrealistically easy. It has no down side whatsoever. The design team definitely missed a call here; in order to balance the game between military and diplomatic tactics, they should have been careful to make war both more costly and more difficult. As it stands, not only is the game weighted heavily toward war, but war is weighted heavily toward the aggressor, who has nothing to lose and everything to gain by the assault. If you can muster seven champions and provide them with enough grain for their armies, you can attack and win almost anywhere.

"you. defender will not be permitted to field more than seven champions against you, regardless of how many he has in the province. In addition, his champions will not be permitted to field more than a hundred soldiers each, regardless of the fact that they are at home, defending their own country, in a province with two thousand of their friends and family. Also, the war in a province does not adversely affect its cultivated fields, herds, structures, population or natural resources. So, once you've taken over, you get the place undamaged and fresh as a daisy (too bad post-war Europe didn't come with this option). You can fight for three or four days with hundreds of men in the melee without ruining a single stalk of grain. And that's leaving out the druids and bards, who bring down every natural disaster you can imagine, from lightning and lava lo floods and hurricane winds, without breaking a single window or killing a single cow. The upshot of all this is that a lot of the complexity of this game can be ignored if you go on the warpath. For example, the Power and Culture values of the province from which you stage an attack make no difference in combat-they don't affect the number of soldiers you can enlist, or the availability of suppliesâwhich means that if you stay on the offensive, you don't really have to worry about building up the Burg or the Citadel. I never had any difficulty producing enough grain for my armies, so there wasn't much motivation to farm the land. It's unfortunate that more thought wasn't given to these matters, but what the hell. Even if the pay-off on diplomacy is slim, the combat system is quite intricate enough to hold a player's interest throughout the game. And even if you unite the tribes by conquest alone, you'll have plenty to do and a number of formidable challenges to face.

The graphics are artistic, if not photo-real; the sound effects are evocative; and the music is the usual deplorable synthetic rubbish. The interface is mouse-driven and easy to use, although it may take a while to get the hang of things, because the menus aren't laid out in the most intuitive fashion. Fortunately, the game is blessed with a useful, coherent instruction manual and a handy form of on-line help, which answer the majority of questions that come up. CELTIC TALES yields at least a hundred hours of play, and turns can be streamlined somewhat by setting backfield provinces on automatic with the Delegate command. It also supports multiple players, which should increase its replay value significantly. In short, CELTIC TALES is a better-than-average game, enjoyable, stimulating, and unique. The magic system is one of the best I've seen. The game will appeal strongly to both fans of Celtic mythology and to strategy gamers who can appreciate its fantasy and historical elements.

"L2 BUGSXR WIN 95 Exe XPLOSION. Hey, Wanna Play With My SDK? The Windows 95 Game SDK Will Mean Good Things To Gamers by Paul C. Schuytema or months you've read the hype surrounding Windows 95. I'm sure you've even enjoyed some of the Â«anti-hypeÂ» which has been percolating through the press for this long-overdue operating system. In my opinion, Windows 95, while not a revolutionary operating system, is a pretty amazing piece of evolutionary software. That it can deliver on many of its promises and still be transparently compatible with all our favorite Windows 3.1 and DOS applications (and games!) is quite an amazing feat. ith the Game SDK developers can now focus on writing the cool parts of their games, and leave all of that nasty, dirty input/output stuff to the operating system. graphical front-end (GUI), and for word processors, spreadsheets and page layout, it was light-years beyond DOS for ease of use. But were there any games? Sure, you could plunk away at SOLITAIRE, or try your hand at surviving the excitement of OUTPOST, but for the most part, the Windows game offerings were pretty lean and lame. The reason? Just ask any game developer. Developing for Windows 3.1 was an exercise in madness. Not only did Windows games have to deal with all the hardware trickery that DOS games did, they had to work within the constraints of Windows, which meant s-l-o-w graphics, and a whole bushel full of other operating system gobbledy-gook to keep it running happily within the GUI interface. For many developers, it just wasn't worth the trouble. Microsoft Windows 95 THE AMAZED SKEPTIC I popped the beta CD of \"Win95\" into one of my machines and held my breath as I clicked on the \"abandon all hope...\" button. It installed just fine, and so without so much as a glance at the on-line documentation or the READ.ME file, I opened a DOS window, installed HERETIC, created a shortcut on my desktop and doubleclicked. Pow, it was up and running, as fast as before, but this time I could \"control-escape\" right back into Windows 95 and an Excel spreadsheet. Not too shabby. But wait, there's more. Back in Windows, I popped a Black Sabbath CD into my drive. In a few seconds, Ozzy and Iommi were smoking through the rifls of \"The Wizard.Â» Cool. Then I clicked on the taskbar icon for HERETIC and instantly was back in that magical world, still playing at top speed, yet still listening to Black Sabbath (and damn loud, too). All that on a Microsoft Confidental WINDOWS 95 Game SDK featuring Direct Directed DirectPL MICROSOFT TO THE RESCUE? Now, Microsoft comes along and wants to do away with the old Windows 3.x and MS-DOS-on a global scale, mind you. You can imagine the collective groan which rose from the game development community. But through the efforts of a few Microsoft evangelists who actually play games, Windows 95 is poised to be THE game operating system of the coming years. We've already seen, above and in previous CGW issues, that Windows 95 can run DOS games just fine, with the added value of task switching (not for productivity, screw that, but so you won't get busted when you play WING 3 at work). Beyond that, Microsoft wants to take it disc 093 486/66 with 16 MB of RAM. Perhaps Microsoft is onto something here...

"UNDER THE HOOD you need the performance, check out the Plextor PLX-6H sixspeed CD-ROM drive. Otherwise, we suggest waiting for a little competition so the price will come down. Price: $549 (internal), $639. For more information, call (800) 475-3986. OMEX resulting data transfer rates were: at 100% CPU utilization, 874 kilobytes per second; at 60%, 573 Kilobytes per second What about real world use? The drive definitely loaded games faster. WING COMMANDER III missions that might take as much as several minutes with a double speed drive would take mere seconds with the Plextor. Other games showed similar behavior in load times. Is it worth it? That's unclear. The Plextor six-speed drive has a suggested retail price of $549-more than double that of some SCSI quad-speed drives. The Plextor PLX-6H is also a SCSI drive, so that needs to be factored into the cost equationâyou'll need a SCSI host adapter (or a SCSI equipped sound card). The drive also requires a caddy to hold the CDROM, something that's becoming increasingly a nuisance in this day of caddyless drives (unless you stand your computer case on its side). On top of that, loading the Plextor PLX-6H is a two-handed operation, since you have to manually hold the door open to pop the caddy in. One great feature, however, is a full set of controls on the front to play audio CDs. If you have applications that constantly load large files and APC POWER CENTER HANDLES CORDS AND POWER CONTROL We've all seen them: flat, square boxes that sit underneath monitors and have a plethora of switches. They usually have some surge protection built-in, and are used to turn on computers, monitors, printers, etc. The look may be best described as extreme utilitarian. Now from American Power Conversion (APC), a leader in uninterrupted power systems, comes the POWER MANAGER power center. Games Too Expensive? NOT ANYMORE!

Even the customizable buttons look cool and vaguely Â«Giger-ish.\" The top lifts up so you can wind extra cordage in it, a definite plus if you find yourself tangled up in computer peripheral cables like I sometimes do. Its even rated to support monitors that weigh up to 70 lbs--that's most 17-inch monitors. There are some other thoughtful touches, too. One of the connectors in the back is actually a mini-extension cord, for those annoying power \"brick\" adapters that come with some peripherals. Another useful feature is the power connection on the \"unswitched\" side-even when the main power switch is off, this connection still routes power to the plug. Perhaps you want your computer off, but you use your sound system for audio listening. Also, it's perfect to run a battery charger for you laptop-toting gamers. APC has even included a pass-through for a phone line, which adds surge suppression to your modem connection-nothing could be worse than protecting your computer, only to have your modem fried by a surge over the phone line. If you have several peripherals and a tangled web of cables (as most gamers do), the Power MANAGER may be worth checking out. Price: $134.99. For more information, call (800) 800-4APC. ............
