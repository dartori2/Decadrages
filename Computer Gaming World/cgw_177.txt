"Look Out! Ole Mac Is Back Will Apple Really Reach the Core with New Initiative? EDITORIAL CAMINO means that QUAKE III is being developed simultaneously on the PC and Macintosh. Only about 15K of Macspecific code is being used in the Mac version. Everything else is platform independent. Better yet, Carmack promises that the licensees of the QUAKE III engine will be able to build Mac versions free of additional charges. Of course, Apple has been known to destroy their potential in the game market before. There is a corporate hubris that goes back a long way with plenty of aphorisms games and the lighter Playstation games on the same platform. Still, there are challenges ahead for Apple. I can't see core gamers moving to the G3 and accepting a smaller list of available titles. The Playstation emulator adds to the When John Carmack says that Apple has finally gotten its act together, even the AntiMac has to listen. 've just returned from the should shake in their boots after best medicine show I've such a demonstration. Then, Jobs seen since the last time began to recount the virtues of visited Knott's Berry Farm. the new G3: the expandability up At Knott's Berry Farm, to 1GB of RAM and hard disk Disneyland's little-known storage up to 100GB; 1/0 ports for competitor \"behind the Ethernet, USB, and FireWire; the Orange Curtain\" of door that opens to let users have California's bastion of political full access to the guts of the conservatism, an actor plays the machine; the four expansion slots role of a con man selling some ungodly panacea for every ill known to man. He has rigged up some special effects to add credibility to his spiel, but it's pretty easy to see through the charade. At MacWorld (not to be confused with anyone's amusement park, since Macintosh enthusiasts take their machines seriously), it was difficult to separate the special effects from the test results. Steve Jobs can be a fast-talking showman whose patter may well be the equivalent of a W.C. Fields role. His keynote address at MacWorld, demonstrating the superiority of the new Power Mac G3 with ATI Rage 128 as standard (three 64-bit 33Mhz and one 32equipment, was such a show. He bit 66Mhz PCI slots) and the new, worked the crowd with an incredible mixture of polished showmanished with three stirring videoship and \"Gee, Shucks\" jeans-clad clips, even yours truly—the charm. He proved how the Mac AntiMac-felt ready to walk was still the champion in graphic down the aisle to repent as production applications. (What a though I were at a Pentecostal surprise!

Clearly, Wintel adding OpenGL to the Mac OS) to dredge up regularly to support the idea that games are frivolous and peripheral. Yet, they definitely seem to be moving the right direction right now by listening to developers about OpenGL and pinpointing the hottest titles for Macintosh versions expected to be superior to the PC games. The first round of announcements includes AGE OF EMPIRES, BATTLEZONE, FLY!, HERETIC II, IMPERIALISM II, MYTH II QUAKE III, QUEST FOR GLORY V, RAINBOW SIX, SIMCITY 3000, STARCRAFT, and TOMB RAIDER III. Plus, there is a larger number of announcements to be made in the wings. (FALCON 4.0 will be one of those.) Also, some Macintosh owners will be excited about the new software-based emulator for Sony Playstation games by a company called Connectix. Casual gamers should really enjoy the flexibility of being able to play the \"big\" PC title mix, but that's addressable simply by purchasing a Playstation. Further, most gamers are not going to be happy with what Carmack calls the \"silly one-button mouse.\" or the inability to expand the iMac beyond its aging 3D card, nearChiclet keyboard, and tinny built-in speakers. Finally, Apple will be challenged to get out some unique Macintosh games. Without something unique to the Mac, I can't see even early adopters making the switch. In spite of Steve Job's impressive medicine show, I'm not going to buy the impressive new Macintosh as my next gaming panacea. But unlike my stance on previous Macintoshes, I'm not going to tell my friends to avoid them like London during the plaque, either. Finally, the Mac looks like a viable platform again.

Don't retract your airbrakes when reach your target speed, however. Leaving them open will give you better response to throttle movements at slow speed. Once you reach 180 hen you've flown flight sims for a while, you start to get complacent. Except for a few times when I've been distracted by a phone call or surprise spousal shoulder rub, it's literally been years since I crashed an undamaged plane on landing. So imagine my dismay when I broke the landing gear off my F-16 on seven of my first eight landing attempts in FALCON 4.0. Luckily, I had a chance to talk to MicroProse's Gilman Louie before ! trashed my squadron's entire allotment of F-16s. He shared the landing technique he learned from F-16 pilot Pete Bonnani. After a few touch-and-gos practicing this technique, my only crashes have come when flying heavily damaged aircraft. So here's the official Gilman/Bonnani Landing Course, with a few tweaks by yours truly. too high. Real F-16s now limit the brake extension to 43 percent when the gear is down. The key to successful landings in FALCON 4.0 is learning to use the flight path marker on the HUD (heads-up display). If you're not familiar with how the marker works, read the description on pages 1-5 of the FALCON 4.0 manual, and fly training mission 1. Place the flight path marker on the black overrun area at the close end of the runway. Use the throttle to keep the marker on the overrun area and your speed around 180 knots. The marker should be about two to three degrees below the HUD's horizon line-more than that and you're too high on final approach. degree HUD marker lined up with the gun cross. If you've done everything right, you should hear the gentle squeak of the tires hitting the runway, rather than the all-toofamiliar screech of your fuselage scraping the ground. Once you've touched down, don't drop the nose. Instead, keep the 10-degree angle until the nose falls on its own. This bleeds quite a bit of speed through aerobraking. Once the nose falls, use the wheel brake key (K) to slow to a stop. You may want to activate the ACMI flight recorder while practicing. You'll be able to see your mistakes, relive your successes, and catch some impressive special effects visible in the external view that it would be suicidal to watch I broke the gear off my F-16 on seven of my first eight landing attempts. while on final approach. Think you're good now? Try Mission 11, Flameout Landings. Succeed there and then you'll have bragging rights. CGW Use the Flight Path Marker, Luke To practice landings, choose Mission 9 in the Tactical Engagement section. You'll enter the sim on an extended final approach. Contact the tower by pressing T and request an emergency landing, in order to get knots, drop your landing gear. Also, rather than just pressing B to open the brakes all the way, hold down Shift-B for a count of four to open them to about 60 percent of full extension. (The left cockpit view has a brake percentage indicator.) This will help keep you from scraping the brakes on the ground if you pull the nose up Landing with Flare Now watch the altitude tape on the right side of the HUD.

'm thinking of writing a self-help book for game industry execs entitled I'm Okay, You Need a Patch. If you're designing games and your products exhibit any of the signs below, you're a candidate. 1) Holiday releases. When buyers have to decide between four WW2 sims, FALCON 4.0, HALF-LIFE, MYTH 2, BROOD WAR, and a half-dozen other great releases, are sales really going to be much higher than a mid-year release? Kudos to EA and Firaxis for not rushing ALPHA CENTAURI, finished in late December, onto those crowded shelves. C'mon, folks, give us something to buy in April. 2) Developers supporting only the joystick at Controller ID 1. Hey kids, Windows has supported multiple controllers for a couple of years now. USB gives us the physical capability to attach multiple controllers, so you can, for instance, put flight controls on your joystick port and a couple of gamepads on your USB ports. Yet I've seen only one game (FALCON 4.0) so far that lets you choose between controllers. 3) Sierra Utilities. Designed to simplify patching for less technical users, this utility has numerous glitches, the worst of which is the ability to wipe our your games directory if you uninstall the unpatched HALF-LIFE after choosing not to place it into a \"Sierra\" subdirectory. Most annoying is Sierra's brash placement of the icon on the root of the Start menu. Hey Sierra, you're not special, and my Start menu isn't yours to play with. Put the Sierra Utilities under the Programs submenu like everyone else. After you fix them. 24 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. APRIL 1999 www.computer gaming.com "

"Emmapeeler Channeling the Avengers, Batman, and Doctor Who to Jump-start Adventure Gaming developing a title with a strong female lead? | his past weekend, I was having the time of my life (death?) playing Manny in the afterlife of GRIM FANDANGO. And it occurred to me that if today's technology-and a designer like Tim Schaefer-can make an enjoyable game from Mexican Day of the Dead folklore, it's high time that adventure games branch out from fairies, overly-hardboiled detectives, and improbably endowed women being bent over backwards by male cigarette ads. Here, then, are my picks for games to be brought over from other media. through time and space, righting wrongs with a variety of beautiful female companions at one's side? This sci-fi game would give an open-minded design team almost total freedom to come up with bizarre villains, although the infa mously destructive Daleks and the egomaniacal Cybermen (to whom Star Trek's Borg owe a huge debt) movie-miscast, sexless and boring—you'll thrill to the chance to play a game based on the droll, witty, and veddy British original TV series. Sure, nostalgia can be a trap, but if you were careful to set this in 1967—and to put superspy Emma Peel in that fabulous orange jumpsuit-you could have a stylish game that evokes the spirit of the original. After all, Patrick MacNee can still play the consummate English gentleman who rarely musses his Saville Row suits whilst dispatching the foe of the week. Diana Rigg could also probably be persuaded to take 4. Sandman Mystery Theatre Wesley Dodds is a wild mix of Sherlock Holmes, Lord Peter Whimsy, and the 1930s version of Batman-except that the Sandman, Dodds' alter-ego, doesn't walk around with his buttocks tensed all the time. He just wears a WWI gas mask and douses his enemies with noxious fumes. All of Wesley's money doesn't help him sleep any better-hence his nocturnal superhero hobby-his perky debutante girlfriend, Dian Belmont, suspects his secret identity, and the official police force considers him an annoying amateur and borderline criminal. It's a wonderful mix, Trust me: Lara Croft will be working for a temp agency after a polygonal Emma Peel hits. 1. The Dark Knight Returns The definitive noir Batman story as far away from the camp TV show as can be imagined, and definitely not for kids. A middle-aged Batman hasn't donned his cape in decades, Commissioner Gordon is retiring, street gangs rule the streets of Gotham City, and the homicidal Joker is proclaimed a victim of society. Finally, Batman snaps, rips his costume out of mothballs, and declares war on his criminal enemies in a manner to give even Quentin Tarentino pause. If you darkened GRIM FANDANGO's palate just a bit and added a variety of ultraviolent arcade elements, this game could easily make fans forget the recent Batmovie abominations. Frank Miller, whose screenwriting credits include Robocop 2, would surely be up to the task of adapting his own graphic novel to the PC screen. would certainly have to make an appearance. (Note to marketing folks: Given how talky the cult series was, you wouldn't need to plunk down millions for the rights to the latest 3D engine, either.) Larger than life and not to be taken totally seriously—a pretty good starting point for any game whosoever might have the guts and the capital to do this one right can expect serious Eurocurrency (and even a few U.S. dollars) to come their way. They just need to get on the move while the definitive Doctor, Tom Baker, is still around to do the lead voiceover. time from her stints on Broadway and PBS to once again lend her velvet pipes to the voice of Emma Peel, that multi-talented scientist, martial artist, detective and imcomparably enticing married woman. Trust me: Lara Croft will be working for a temp agency after a polygonal Emma Peel hits. With the number of fighting sequences typical of the TV show, we'd need a good action/adventure engine, like KING'S QUEST: MASK OF ETERNITY. Maybe Roberta Williams or Jane Jensen would be interested in since an adventure game is all about overcoming obstacles. Maybe Guy Davis, who did the marvelous period art for CANDMAN the comic series MISTERY would lend his pen? If THEATRE not, we'll just steal the art team who did the dream sequence for GABRIEL KNIGHT: SINS Tarantula OF THE FATHERS. It's far more likely that we'll be subjected to platform Scrollers based on Independence War XIV than any of the above, but can dream.... CGW Geri 2.

NoNoNo, not that sorry arcade fighting game! AVP!!! The WOLFENSTEIN clone! Oh, guess you didn't own an Atari Jaguar.

According to the specs on the ASUS motherboard it only supports up to 400MHZ CPUs! Why pair it with a 450MHZ CPU? And while I'm at it, where do you get the incredible prices?

To the extent that this misrepresented the fundamental nature of LOM-SE, I apologize. Imust correct him on one point, however, as I am familiar with the original version of LOM, having reviewed it for CGW. In any review, especially a short one, the reviewer must choose where to focus his or her analysis. In the case of LORDS OF MAGIC SPECIAL EDITION, I felt that the core game system was the appropriate place to focus my attention, in part because I did not feel that the game was strong enough to warrant paying for hours of additional gameplay. What good is an extra 50 to 100 hours of quests when most gamers won't play long enough to get through the initial game? Of what value is an expansion pack to a product so riddled with programming bugs and key design flaws that it was mostly unplayable? Thus, I stand by my original review: LOM-SE fixed many flaws in the original LOM. Sure, it added quests, just don't think they're worth paying for on their own ZD PUBLISHING REVIEW PATCH: LORDS OF MAGIC SE I am the General Manager of Impressions Software, developer of the LORDS OF MAGIC: SPECIAL EDITION. I was deeply disturbed by your review of the LORDS OF MAGIC SPECIAL EDITION entitled \"Abra-Ca-Blah-blah\" on page 240 of the February issue. Not only does this review fail to provide any in-depth information about the scope of this product, but it implies that it is ultimately nothing more than an attempt to get our fans to \"pay extra\" for something we should have given them in the first place. The SPECIAL EDITION was created to reward our fans. Its large scope, relative to standard expansion products, was to demonstrate that we care very deeply about delivering a quality gaming experience for the money. The Quest Pack contains five hand-crafted quests, each with its own story and characters, engaged in various interlocking adventures and subquests. To script each of the 200 or so encounters contained within, we had to develop our own quest editor. We estimate that these five quests provide somewhere between 50 and 100 hours of additional gameplay, of a sort not provided by the original product, nor part of its original concept. Despite this, your review mentions them only once as, \"a few extra scenarios\" (LOM isn't even a scenario-based game) and further questions our right to expect users to pay for them. This characterization is just inexcusable. The inaccuracy of this review leads me to believe that you either were not very familiar with the original game, or you did not take the time to play the SPECIAL EDITION thoroughly, nor President Mike Perlis Executive Vice Presidents Don Byrnes Chris Dobbrow Jack Dolce Al DiGuido Thomas McGrade Michael J.

CGW expects its reviewers to finish the game, but Tim Carter did not finish the quests in LOM-SE, and could not adequately comment on the additional hours of game. play. I regret the omission, and I have taken steps to reduce the chances of such an oversight in the future. As for the rating, the additional hours of gameplay were taken into account. So, while lamenting the sloppiness of the reviewer's methodology, we stand by the three-star rating. Even with all of the enhancements and new quests, we perceive LOM.

"READ.ME THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE COMPUTER GAMING WORLD Edited by ken_browna zd.com DRAKAN's Combination of Beautiful Warrior and Powerful Dragon Cast an Irresistible Spell ver since seeing DRAKAN at a Psygnosis press party late last year, I couldn't wait to see what it's like to go flying with Rynn by dragon-back. My wish came true just before press time when I received a playable beta of the game. After playing it for a few days, I'm very impressed. The game takes place in a series of beautiful and stunningly realistic outdoor environments. Each level is extremely large and spectacularly detailed, featuring mountain ranges; canyons; rivers and waterfalls; small villages; and extensive cavern systems. The game strives for total immersion and even the weather is very Rynn's character is beautifully modeled, and she looks like she could kick Lara Croft's ass. Beaubeasy the Aerial dogfighting gets up-close and personal in the narrow confines of the grotto. Using a third-person perspective, the game combines hand-tohand fighting using all sorts of weapons and spells with intense aerial dragon dogfights. You take on the role of Rynn, a beautiful warrior girl, on a quest to rescue her kidnapped brother from the evil Wartoks. Her companion, a fire-breathing dragon named Arokh, can talk, fly, and blast foes with four different kinds of lethal fire and gas. realistically modeled with excellent looking rain, wind, and snowfall effects. The lighting changes based on the time of day, and the water effects are quite impressive. The developers have taken great care in trying to breath life into this magical world. You might think DRAKAN bears strong similarities with TOMB RAIDER III, but gameplay is more along the lines of HERETIC II. Both HERETIC II and DRAKAN focus on fighting, whereas TR III is more puzzle-oriented. Most of the game involves intense combat with the kilted Wartoks and other fiendish creatures, however exploration is richly rewarded both in terms of finding treasure and the thrill of stumbling across cool hidden areas. There is an easy-to-use inventory system and plenty of useful items to collect. The transition from controlling Rynn on the ground to Arokh in the air is seamless. The game's list of impressive technological features includes colored lighting, high-res textures, and realistic skeletal character animation. The creatures' artificial intelligence looks promising. A Wartok might charge Rynn if she is on the ground but then run for cover if under fire. Wartoks investigate strange sounds and call for help if they see the player. According to Psygnosis, the game is about 80 percent complete and should be released sometime by May, 1999. KENNETH JOHNSON www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD APRIL 1999 "


"READ. ME UNREAL ARE Developments GT Interactive Polishing Two Games Using the UNREAL Engine Delivering what may well have been the snazziest graphics of the past year, the engine powering UNREAL was one of 1998's real technical standouts. Now GT Interactive is preparing to release two new. very dissimilar games using this engine. teleportation device that lets you easily reach high platforms as well as telefrag your enemies. While UT will support the standard deathmatch and capture-the-flag options, it's the Domination and Assault games that are most exciting. Domination tasks teams with controlling specific points on a map, accruing points the longer they hold them; the first team to reach a preset number of points wins. In Assault, teams must complete timed mission to destroy or defend targets to progress. Obviously, all of this will be available for play against other humans, not just bots. UNREAL TOURNAMENT While UNREAL's developer, EpicMegaGames, has been addressing that game's multiplayer shortcomings via patches, they are really embracing the multiplayer experience with UNREAL TOURNAMENT (UT), currently slated for an April release. While the game will sport blistering online action, UT will encourage gamers to hone their skills in the game's single player ladder tournaments. Gamers will battle increasingly deadly bots in four separate games, each with 8 to 10 levels. Gamers who rise to the top of each ladder will earn the title of UNREAL Grandmaster and be able to use a previously locked robot mesh as their online avatar. UT features several new weapons including a nuke, the impact hammer melee weapon, and (our favorite) the Redeemer-a missile launcher that lets you steer the warhead through doors and hallways to obliterate your target.

There are no conventional weapons-gamers must use angreal, which lets them cast up to 30 spells, including fireballs, enemy-seeking balls of energy, shields, and a shift plane that teleports you about five feet, perfect for avoiding seeking spells cast by opponents. Angreal are collected as gamers work to retrieve mystic seals held by their enemies. What should elevate WOT above the shooter mob is its unusual strategic game. Seals will be housed in citadels, each held by a player. You'll have to outfit your citadel with pits, spear traps, thick walls, portcullises, and vicious monsters to protect your seals while your away stealing seals yourself. Additionally, higher level sentries can be purchased and given orders to guard specific areas or to round up monsters from all over when intruders appear.

Dfx is preparing to raise the bar again. The 3D performance champion, following its acquisition of board-maker STB. is preparing to unleash Voodoo3 in four different offerings. We put the Voodoo3 3000 and 3500 versions to the test, and the results were mighty impressive. Voodoo3 outperformed both nVidia's RIVA TNT and ATI's Rage 128, the two current performance leaders. Voodoo3 will come in four fla vors, broken down by speed grade. For motherboard-down configurations, there'll be a 125MHz version, followed by two \"mainstream\" parts, the Voodoo3 2000 and 3000, whose speed grades will be 143 and 166MHz, respectively. Finally, the flagship part will be the Voodoo 3 3500, which will be clocked at 183MHz. On the 3500, 3Dfx may include additional control panels to allow tweakers to try and squeeze every last bit of performance out of the chip. We tested the Voodoo3 3000 (166MHz) against the two current champions, RIVA TNT and Rage 128, and the Voodoo3 beat both of them. Image quality looked very solid as well. And since Voodoo3's drivers were beta, its performance may see further improvement before cards start shipping. For those gamers pining for a 3D-only Voodoo3 card, there may be good news in the offing. According to one source at 3Dfx, a 3D-only board using Voodoo3's 3D core may be a future product.

Origin Quashes ULTIMA ONLINE Suit The lawsuit against EA and Origin over ULTIMA ONLINE has been withdrawn. The six gamers known as Ken Hinther et al. (represented by attorney George Schultz) dropped their case against EA in early January. As part of the settlement, EA agreed to donate $15,000 to the San Jose Tech Museum, but both parties have to pay for their own legal fees. The legal dispute began in March, 1998, when Schultz filed suit against EA and Origin for breach of contract, negligence, misrepresentation, and breach of warranty. He charged that EA and Origin should pay damages to UO users for releasing a game plagued by alleged technical problems, such as lag and server crashes, and deceptive packaging, such as a failure to mention monthly fees and adequate system requirements. Schultz told GameSpot news that he thought the gaming industry was better off as a result of his case. \"I never saw the subject of bugs in games treated more seriously,\" he said. \"Maybe next time it won't take a lawsuit to hear what (gamers) have to say about a game.\" Origin released a statement saying, \"We take extreme exception to Mr. Schultz's judgment that his actions have made the gaming industry better. He failed to certify this as a class action in part because his plaintiffs were not representative of the more than 100,000 paying ULTIMA ONLINE players.\" New Festival For Indie Developers The Gathering of Developers and Miller Freeman are teaming up to host what they hope will be this industry's version of the Sundance Film Festival.

The festival will recognize console, PC, Mac and online games equally, according to organizers. A $10,000 Grand Prize for the best independent game of the year will go to the winner. Awards will also be presented for Technical Excellence, Art, Audio, Game Design and Audience Choice. Miller Freeman says the . Independent Games Festival is designed to promote interactive Microsoft Buys FASA Microsoft acquired FASA Interactive Technologies from its parent company, Virtual World Entertainment Group, in early January. This gives Microsoft the \"exclusive and perpetual electronic rights\" to FASA's popular BattleTech property. Neither company released financial terms of the deal. FASA Interactive is currently developing MECHWARRIOR 3 for MicroProse and Hasbro Interactive. Microsoft Games manager Ed Fries indicated that FASA would finish the title for the two companies. However, future BattleTech titles will be published by Microsoft, such as MECHWARRIOR 4 (said to be in development now). 44 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. APRIL 1999 www.computergaming.com "

In one of the most embarrassing blunders in recent gaming history, Sierra Sports, following a mountain of complaints and bad publicity, issued a recall in January of FOOTBALL PRO 99, due to an insurmountable number of bugs in the supposedly \"finished\" game. The game was pulled from store shelves, and Sierra began offering a full refund to those who purchased the game on or before January 20, as well as a coupon for a free Sierra game valued at $29.99 or less. For a game that, in a former life, won CGW's Sports Game of the Year award three times in a row (1993-95) and is an inductee in the CGW Hall of Fame, it's been a long, hard fall. FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL, in its prime, was widely acknowledged as the deepest, most realistic football game ever. But the game has been flailing for at least two seasons now, with outdated graphics and a convoluted interface, among other problems. So Sierra mercy-killed the entire FRONT PAGE line, rechristened it Sierra Sports, and promised an all-new, state-ofthe-art football game for this year. After numerous delays, Sierra finally released the game at the close of 1998—and the result was an unmitigated disaster. \"What can I say? We dropped the ball,\" said Sean Gleason, Sierra Sports' marketing director. \"We built this product from the ground up over two years, and we let the impending end of the NFL season, and the desire to get it out over the holidays cloud our judgment. We made a mistake.\" Gleason said that he estimated that the recall would cost Sierra over $1 million, and that's in addition to all the previous investments in the game in terms of development and marketing—and that's also in addition to the $29.95 coupons they'll be doling out to frustrated consumers. In the meantime, the company is going to try to fix the game for a re-release this summer as FOOTBALL PRO 2000. The plan is not to add any \"new\" features, but just to get the ones that were supposed to work in the '99 version working. Those gamers who bought FOOTBALL PRO 99 and don't want to entirely bail on the product can sign up to be on the \"FOOTBALL PRO Home Team\" at www.sierrasports.com. Members will receive a $20 rebate towards FOOTBALL PRO 2000, a t-shirt, periodic beta patches, and access to a dedicated Web site where development issues can be discussed. Sierra's release of FOOTBALL PRO 99 typifies everything that is wrong with the attitude of game publishers these days, but the recall is a good step towards reparation. Let's hope that they've learned their lesson, and don't take to the playing field again until they have a real game on their hands. They're not likely to get the ball back a third time.

"YOUR BEST SOURCE FOR THE HOTTEST GAMES IN DEVELOPMENT Planescape: Torment AD&D As Only the Makers of FALLOUT and BALDUR'S GATE Can Do It LET GO MY LEGO Even more than in BALDUR'S GATE, PLANESCAPE: TORMENT gets away from the tiled Legobrick look of many isometric role-playing games. by Johnny L. Wilson f the characters in PLANESCAPE: TORMENT seem a little disturbing, it's because they are. Characters who dismember themselves and their enemies in order to improve their armor or obtain new weapons aren't exactly run-of-the-mill, even in role-playing games. If the landscape seems a little more colorful than the characters, that's because it is. The characters, though immortal, tend to bear the grayish tinges of their many deaths, while the 16-bit color landscape pushes the Bioware Infinity engine (used in BALDUR'S GATE) to new limits. As in BALDUR'S GATE, the engine features global lighting so that the cycles of dawn to dusk matter, but it also features special lighting effects for the 20-plus magical spells, spells that will mesmerize the gamer almost as much as their victims in the gameworld. Yet the biggest change in aesthetic is that the engine now accommodates huge animated structures and sprites such as you never saw in BALDUR'S GATE. If you thought that characterization and alignment made BALDUR'S GATE interesting, wait until you see what the folks at Interplay's Black Isle Studios have done with PLANESCAPE: TORMENT. Remember those nice touches like internecine rivalry between alignments in your party and characters who responded to situations based on their Charisma attribute? Remember the comic relief when chaotic characters would their shout battle cries in medieval trash talk? PLANESCAPE: TORMENT one-ups these awardwinning advances.

"thieves (at least, they are best suited to be great thieves) believe that life is out to get them. They make great point persons, however, due to their bonuses on saving rolls. As in BALDUR'S GATE, the design team has been careful to make sure that ROLE-playing is part of the consideration whenever you enter into party manage ment. Why, you might even find that someone in your party is a backstabbing traitor. Stranger things have happened. Most importantly, the difference in the way PLANESCAPE: TORMENT handles characterization is that you are constantly generating your character on the fly. In life after life and death after death, your amnesiac character is continuously defining his identity, his attributes, and his belief system. The game revolves around this discovery process and you'll curse every death because it will take away portions of your memory and force you to reinvent yourself. Like one of Michael Moorcock's eternal warriors, you'll find that wielding extreme power and venturing where mortals fear to tread is a mixed blessing and curse. Once you build your character's reputation, the gameworld will react to it whether you like it or not. In other words, PLANESCAPE: TORMENT doesn't suffer from lack of ambition. It embodies (and, at times, disembodies) ambition. party of up to five characters. These characters are not simply rehashes of the typical AD&D worlds. One such character is a talking-perhaps we should say insulting-skull. One might suggest that this talking skull is the equivalent of having the host of the YOU DON'T KNOW JACK game show as your constant companion. Sure, the skull is occasion ally useful, but he's definitely funny in an acerbic way. If you don't feel like a berk (the Planescape equivalent to \"Wilson\" in William Gibson's classic Neuromancer) whenever you do something wrong, he'll make you feel like the supreme addle-cove (another Planescape term for idiot). Further, PLANESCAPE transforms dwarves into centaur-like creatures called Bariaurs. They will be welcome additions to your party as both fierce fighters and congenial sojourners-as long as you don't serve meat or befriend any giants. Elf characters on the traditional AD&D Prime Material Plane are now Githzerai. Githzerai will go berserk when encountering mind flayers or Githyanki, their ancient, leathery-skinned, fanged enemies. Tieflings are the paranoid, loner obverse of the Prime Material Plane's Halflings. Instead of being sociable, these clever SNEAK PREVIEWS I Don't Believe It in spite of the brilliant use of characterization to motivate and stimulate, the true uniqueness of HEAD-LINER Your disembodied companion-like many of the richly scripted nonplayer characters in the game combines acerbic wit with a low threshold on his B.S. detector. PLANESCAPE: TORMENT is the fact that everything takes place on different planes within the multiverse. Most of the AD&D universe deals with the Prime Material Plane in intricate detail. Planescape defines the multiverse as an intricate series of rings. Sigil, the city on the edge of forever (may Harlan Ellison pardon my theft of his title as a handy descriptor), is a ring; the Outlands are rings, the Outer Planes form a ring; and the Elemental Planes make up a ring. The Great Road allows one to traverse all of the planes within the Outlands as though one were gently caressing the jewels on an expensive pinky ring. This structure guarantees that Planescape adventures (of which, we hope, PLANESCAPE: TORMENT is merely the first) range farther and consist of more variety than those adventures on the Prime Material Plane. Most significant, however, Planescape is made up of a wild variety of factions who serve, in original Planescape (the people and paper game) designer Zeb Cook's words, as \"philosophers ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL Not only are the player characters in PLANESCAPE: TORMENT larger than the ones in BALDUR'S GATE, but so are some of the monsters to be encountered. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Avid proponents of the Death Penalty, this faction believes that Justice cannot triumph without a swift and merciless prosecution of offenders. The Signers are the epitome of eclecticism and moral relativity; The Society of that \"Parting is all we know of heaven/And all we need of hell.\" in the case of PLANESCAPE: TORMENT, those lines might be changed to \"Dying is all we know of heaven,\" since this afterlife, this seeming limitless existence, offers both the heavenly redemption of most rare confluence in computer games: intellectual stimulation, visceral satisfaction, and aesthetic inspiration. But if the game disappoints, we just might have to capture the design team with a sticky, barbed Canoleth's tongue and SPELLBOUND In PLANESCAPE: TORMENT, the Black Isle Studios design team has accomplished even better spell effects with the BALDUR'S GATE lighting engine. with clubs.\" These factions all operate under specific belief systems and will expect your character to find his place within them, as well. The Athar believe that all of the powers or gods are cosmic Elmer Gantrys or Wizards of Oz. Looking behind the curtain proves that no one is there, or at least no one that you expected. The Believers of the Source are naïve extrapolations of the biblical precept that \"All things work together for good.\" They see all existence as one big preliminary examination; beings move from test to test in order to be tempered like steel. The Bleak Cabal sounds almost onomatopoeic when you consider that they represent nihilism in the extreme. The Doomguard serve as the angels of entropy within the Planescape universe. This faction isn't actively destructive. They serve as a passive sonar, waiting alertly for do-gooders who might get in the way of the natural entropic designs of the multiverse. The Dustmen sound like a clan based on T.S. Eliot's poem \"The Hollow Men.\" They believe that \"life's a joke,\" hence serving as Planescape's version of the existentialist movement, in the manner of a Jean-Paul Sartre, a Eugene lonesco, or a Samuel Beckett. Want to join a faction that believes in the ultimate manifest destiny? Join The Fated. Feel more comfortable with legalists that make the Pharisees of Judaism in the first century seem like laissezfaire moral relativists? You want The Fraternity of Order. Want to emulate the anomie and anarchy of the multiverse? Enlist in the libertarian ranks of The Free League. Want to actively create anarchy by overthrowing the corrupt (by definition, all) powers that be? Join The Revolutionary League. If you don't want to submit to the harmony of the multiverse, The Harmonium (pardon me if this faction resonates a little too closely to a militant version of the Christian Right) will force you to do so. The Mercykillers, on the the protagonist's self-discovery and the hell of trying to achieve that redemption. If all goes well, PLANESCAPE: TORMENT should attain that dismember their coding hands to use on a competitor's game. That's how vivid, dark, and fascinating PLANESCAPE: TORMENT threatens to be. CGW Sensation are the Epicures of Planescape and The Transcendent Order finds meaning in Action. As you would expect, The Xaositects believe that the multiverse is chaos and that there is no meaning whatsoever to it. The Outsiders are often called \"The Clueless\" because they have no ties, no belief system. In order for PLANESCAPE: TORMENT TO reach its full potential, the game engine will have to balance factions as carefully a s BALDUR'S GATE does alignment. Before we saw BALDUR'S GATE, we would have been skeptical, but we now eagerly await the next advance in computer roleplaying. PLANESCAPE: TORMENT has the potential to be the richest role-playing game ever placed on the computer. We hope it reaches that potential.

"Magic and Mayhem A Great Blend of RPG and Tactical Strategy Brings Sorcery to Life SNEAK PREVIEWS balloon and head off to parts unknown. The flying contraption soon finds its way into a vortex that sucks you in and deposits you upon a dark and mysterious world. The landing destroys your only way off the planet, leaving you with just one choice: by Jesse Hiatt ou are a young wizard, fresh from the Academy, on your way to your uncle's laboratory to begin your apprenticeship. When you arrive, your uncle is nowhere to be found, and by the looks of the lab, he must have left in a hurry. As you inspect the premises for clues to your uncle's disappearance, you find a map that details the route that he must have taken. You feel compelled to take the journey yourself in hopes that you can find him. You board his flying to journey forth and seek out your destiny. Thus begins the epic experience of MAGIC AND MAYHEM. OK, so we've heard similar setups before. Still, playing this game really does make you feel like a full-fledged wizard. It feels as if every possible aspect was tuned to achieve the best continuity and immersion possible. A lot of your time is spent developing your character, selecting spells, and referring to your invaluable compendium of information, the Grimoir (see sidebar). In many games, all of this activity would break the flow, but here you feel like a wizard checking his dog eared notes. The distribution of experience points and selection of spells are not at all superfluous. but a critical part of getting ready to enter a new level. fashion. What sets MAGIC AND MAYHEM apart from the typical Clone & Conquer is not only the excellent adventure/RPG elements, but also the depth of strategy in both the combat and noncombat portions of the game. For example, the typical RTS strategy of \"build huge hordes as fast as you can\" is thwarted by restricting the number of creatures your wizard can summon. This ensures that you can achieve victory only by using the appropriate forces at the appropriate time. You will find that the various creature attributes really do affect the behavior of the creatures you control. A unicorn, for example, is intelligent and powerful, but shy-exactly what you would expect from such a familiar mythic creature. The unicorn's hooves and single horn are its only weapons, The Mayhem Part Once you are properly prepared, it's on to the next area, where the exploring begins.

"Midtown Madness Room to Roam on the Mean Streets of Chicago OUT THT THE BUTTON TUTTI TUTTIT UIT DITT TI AN SS & SPA GA DA AR GA DA GA SNEAK_PREVIEWS by Jesse Hiatt f you think that the driving genre could use a shot in the arm-or more accurately, a visceral pileup on the side of the road—then MIDTOWN MADNESS is likely to have you breaking your trusty PC driving wheel out of mothballs. With 10 vehicles to choose from, including a city bus and the new Beetle, you are let loose on the mean streets of Chicago. SPARKS WILL FLY If you don't like the way I drive, get off the sidewalk! Virtual Sprawl What really sets this title apart is that, instead of giving you a typical driving-game track with regional landmarks thrown in (à la SAN FRANCISCO RUSH), here you get treated to a virtual city to roam, with block after block of fantastic-looking metropolitan sprawl with realistic traffic patterns. If you crave competition, the variety of racing modes let you set up various routes with periodic checkpoints through the city. If you tire of this, you can always stray from the main track, and sometimes find yourself a shortcut. My favorite, though, is Roam mode, which feels just like driving in a real dense urban environment. Don't want to wait at that red light? Gun your engine, take to the sidewalk (sending pedestrians running for cover), and speed through the intersec tion--causing the milk truck coming the other way to slam into a mailbox as you speed off, leaving a five-car pileup in your wake. This is definitely the best cure for road rage to come to the PC in years, perhaps ever. If you so desire, you can obey the traffic laws and the game will play like a city driving simulator. But if you've spent as much time driving in the city as I have, you'll revel in the chance to finally drive like a complete maniac. The city bus is a good choice for causing mayhem, as it can plow through a crowded intersection and keep on truckin'.

You can see really far down the street, with no artificial fogging or any polygonal pieces of terrain suddenly popping up on the edge of the screen. The designers have reduced overdraw by using a tool that eliminates the unused (unseen) portions of the city. The geometry has four levels of detail, thus reducing the polygon count and leaving room for all of the pedestrians, mailboxes, streetlights and parking meters that add so much realism to the city.

"SNEAK PREVIEWS PROP THAT CAMERA OVER MY SHOULDER If you like that close, tactical view of MYTH, then you'll want to use this view. THROUGH A SOLDIER'S EYES Don't like the path the Al chooses for your units? Then take control of the unit yourself. Machines Acclaim Plans to Spice up the 3D Real-time Arena With This Game by Thierry Nguyen hank MYTH for inspiring other real-time strategy games to go 3D. Though, most of the next 3D games either use a medieval setting, or a far-flung future with starships. MACHINES is one of those rare traditional realtime games that bring a few 3D twists into the genre. Like many other real-time games, this one focuses on establishing a base, building up your forces, and then wreaking havoc on the enemy. But the campaign does offer a few twists to that standard style of gameplay: In a few missions you have to steal technology from the other side; in another, a Blizzard-style installation mission, you have to direct a team to carry out an assault against a space station. Freedom Fighter As the title suggests, you'll mostly be in control of robotic machines. There are no living units around here: you build robots that make factories, which then make even more robots. The campaign system reminds me of TIE FIGHTER, where you select which planets you want to perform missions on, and if a mission seems too hard on one planet, you can jump to another to carry out a minicampaign and come back to the original planet later. Doom With a View The biggest twist to the game play is the 3D feel. You can play this game from not one, but three perspectives. The first is the normal, slightly slanted overhead; that is, it's the overhead view of COMMAND & CONQUER or TOTAL ANNIHILATION, but slanted slightly in order to take advantage of all three dimensions. Then, there is the slightly odd over-the-shoulder view, where you're on ground level along with your units. This viewpoint is more for the MYTH player, in that you can pan around the battlefield and get a closer look at your units in action; this view seems most useful for tactical battles but not for base construction. Then, there's the ever-present first-person-perspective.

"Septerra Core Monolith's Recent Acquisition Looks to Be a Console RPG Done Right SNEAK_PREVIEWS Corgan by Thierry Nguyen reating a role-playing game nowadays seems a lot like acting out a soap opera. Look at the development cycle for either RETURN TO KRONDOR or FALLOUT 2, for example: While the games were being developed, there were many behind-thescenes antics, such as important people coming and going, and even the rise and fall of entire companies. SEPTERRA CORE joins those ranks, as its development is even more storied. At one point everyone on staff was working on the game for free, before they split for a short period. Monolith saw an opportunity and took it, acquiring the game. Now the development team is back in gear. A HIVE OF SCUM AND... The environments range from this alienand robot-filled bar to weird airships and ornate palaces. Selina Not So Final a Fantasy Of course, one wonders why someone would go to the trouble of picking up a title with a shaky history. Well, look at FINAL FANTASY VII. As technically flawed as that title was, it opened the PC door for the console model of role. playing games-games in which story, rather than freedom of movement, was the focus of the game. RETURN TO KRONDOR followed this story-driven model, and SEPTERRA CORE hopes also to mine this emerging RPG motherlode. The game is set on a planet that consists of seven continents orbiting a computer core. Every 100 years, the continents line up in such a fashion that the computer core can be accessed and controlled. As Maya, a resident of the garbage-fill continent, you notice some ships descending from the continent above. The plot begins with Maya deciding to warn someone about the approaching ships. The use of the seven floating continents allows for a large variety of environments in which to travel. The lower you descend, the harsher the environment becomes, and the less sophisticated the technology. The game isn't restricted to the typical fantasy or sci-fi environs, and looks to do a nice job of mixing typical settings in order to create new ones. The graphics are very pleasing to the eye, both in backdrops and in effects such as shadows, rain, and very well done snow. Maya and two others (from a pool of eight).

"SNEAK PREVIEWS ANS 1967 100 @ 2000 Soldier of Fortune Raven Goes Realistic? And Where Are the Fairies? How do you follow up a really well done third-person fantasy shooter like HERETIC II? Raven looks to answer that question with SOLDIER OF FORTUNE, the company's new shooter based on the QUAKE II engine. One thing's for certain: This game is decidedly different from the standard fantasy fare that Raven has produced. SOLDIER OF FORTUNE has you playing a mercenary who is part of a worldwide merc network (shades of JAGGED ALLIANCE). Various missions with comparable salaries are offered, and they can be reviewed before committing yourself to them. Once you accept a particular mission, and depending on whether it's a solo or team mission, you can recruit some other mercenaries and purchase equipment for your team. Then you can create a rudimentary plan (lay out waypoints and so forth) for carrying out the mission, and, finally, just jump in and play. In a mission, the rest of your mercs will execute the plan you mapped out earlier, and you can assume direct control of one merc at a time; so you can jump from merc to merc and see to tasks such as planting explosives or personally assassinating a target. Raven is going for realism, both in the look of the game and in the damage model. The enemies are going to be motion-captured, and there will be about 20 individual parts on the body that can receive and reflect specific damage results. Of course, it remains to be seen whether certain U.S. senators will approve of such imagery as a soldier getting his face blown off in spectacular fashion. Finally, the game will have a toggle set for either realism or gameplay, so fans of both QUAKE and DELTA FORCE can enjoy the game. The game is slated for release \"sometime before Christmas\" this year, and we'll have a more detailed look at the title as it develops.

"EAT Kingpin Recruiting and Dialogue in a QUAKE-engine Game? S SNEAK PREVIEWS If there's an action development team known for \"theme\" games, it's Xatrix. REDNECK RAMPAGE, for example, was essentially the redneck version of DUKE NUKEM. So it seems only appropriate that Xatrix' Mlatest, KINGPIN, would offer a different personality than the QUAKE II engine on which it's based in this case, the team is moving away from rednecks and onto serious gang turf. But there's much more to this game than just a change of characters and scenery. Xatrix is aiming to implement features such as the recruiting gang members off the street, the buying and selling of items, and a working dialogue system. The focus of the game is sure to elicit controversy, since you are playing a gang leader and are trying to consolidate power in a rough part of town. Xatrix is also adding things like specific body damage, vehicular control, and team-based AI. As we went to press, Xatrix was KINGPIN finalizing the first out of seven GENRE: Action episodes. As soon as we get a RELEASE DATE: 03 '99 hands-on piece of the action, DEVELOPER: Xatrix Interactive our consigliere will be in touch.

Over 35 fancifully designed vehicles are fully customizable, with gamers allowed to purchase and adjust armor, engines, weaponry, and every imaginable facet of their vehicle. Money to buy these upgrades is earned by successfully completing the 25+ Platform Sensibility in a 3D Environment ccording to articles in the media about gaming violence, like the one that appeared recently in Reader's Digest, it's well-nigh impossible to find games that the whole family can play. Fortunately, Ubi Soft knows how to fill a niche in a hurry. The original RAYMAN was a solid side-scroller that seemed a bit too console-oriented for PC gamers. RAYMAN 2, however, takes the traditional platform style of its predecessor, but places all the action into a 3D world. And an extensive world it is, with a planned 48 levels stretched across 17 different environments. By going to 3D, the Rayman character's range of moves will increase to take advantage of both horizontal and vertical movement. While we'd never admit it on 60 Minutes, even jaded game reviewers might have trouble taking this promising little charmer off their hard drives. -Thierry Nguyen RAYMAN 2 efore you rip great handfuls of hair from your head and cry out \"Oh, God, no, not another car combat game!\" know this—INERTIA (a working title) is one of the most original entrants into the overworked killer vehicle genre that we've seen in some time. Eschewing the typical postapocalyptic roadways of some hideous future Earth, INERTIA throws the gamer into deep space as a mercenary hired to mine technology for one of five competing corporations. Of course, you'll have to fend off rival mercenaries as well as mechanical beasts all the while negotiating the dangerous tunnels, moving platforms, and more. An impressive physics-based engine drives the action, leading to vehicles that recoil when firing weapons, handle differently in response to weapon weight and placement, and can be buffeted by moving water. Gravity will be modeled as well, so players will have to deal with the odd gravitational storm as well as arenas missions as well as arena duels where players compete for generous cash prizes. You can expect a more in-depth look in a future issue of CGW as soon as we get our twitchy little hands on some working code. -Robert Coffey INERTIA GENRE: Action RELEASE DATE: Q2 '99 DEVELOPER: Ubi Soft PUBLISHER: Ubi Soft GENRE: Vehicular Shooter RELEASE DATE: Q3 '99 DEVELOPER: Pseudo Interactive PUBLISHER: Microsoft 86 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"special advertising section What makes JEFF GORDON Let's be honest building a great racing game that rises above the competition is not an easy task. We knew we had jumped into a cluttered category where mediocrity was the norm, but Jeff Gordon XS Racing had to be the best. We needed a game that appealed to both the demanding racing game fanatic, as well as the gamer just looking to have fun. That's when Real Sports was brought in. They demonstrated an amazing set of programming tools, experience and desire to build the game we wanted. Robin Antonick, President of Real Sports and father of six, even races cars on the weekends. accelerated games. However, different card chipsets may support graphics in varyir ways. For example, to give the effect that car is actually racing on the ground, and n hovering over the track, we implemented transparent shadow effect under the car give it the perspective of being close to t ground. Well, we quickly discovered that some 3D cards, transparent shadows we not supported the same across the 3 boards. The result: some shadows looke like shadows, and some shadows looked lil magic carpets under the cars not quite th look we were going for. But in the end, o experiments with 3D cards will ensure much overall compatiblity as possible. One of the biggest challenges we faced was to make a game that was accessible to everybody. To do so, we set out to make a game that would run smoothly on a P166 with 16 MB RAM without requiring the use of a 3D graphics accelerator. Of course, we also wanted to make it scream on a P450 with huge amounts of RAM and dual Voodoo 2 cards, as well as a variety of other graphics cards. by The game offers menu options that allow the user to adjust the level of detail on the tracks and cars. This was the first step in making the game compatible with as many machines as possible. Items such as environmental mapping (a technique that allows for lighting and the environment to reflect off of the car), clip distance (the distance at which the horizon begins to draw in), and polygons per car, all needed to be adjustable as well, on a per machine basis. The frame rate is exceptional on a wide selection of machines either with the use of a 3D card or without. The real test of developing a racing game speed. We can tell you that you're going 30 MPH, but does it really look and feel th way? The truth is: in videogames, lik movies, special effects play a major role adding to the experience. The special effe in racing games is frame rate. For you know, the track may be moving at 30 MPH and your car is standing still. But does matter as long as the player feels like they're zipping along at top speeds? However it's done, no matter what it takes to move a polygonal car with polygonal tires around a polygonal track in a rectangle monitor on top of your desk, we've been able to transform frame rate into an incredible sensation of speed. Other potential areas of conflict occured when trying to make the game compatible with 3D graphics accelerator cards. We made the decision early on to support Direct 3D, which will allow us to run on all 3D cards, not only 3Dfx (in glide mode) like many So, as we head into the final months before release, we've turned our development challenges into some awesome game features:  Extreme tracks that include everything from jumps and high-banked turns corkscrew loops and 300 MPH speeds.

"Serious competition. Doesn't it seem like every racing game out there lets you smash your opponents into the wall and they don't mind? Well, we didn't want that. If the term artificial intelligence wasn't so overused, then you can say ours is really awesome. But instead, let's just say watch out for the car that you just sent flying into the wall at 230 MPH-it will remember you. Intense graphics that, to put it bluntly, rock!!! The tracks are set in richly detailed, brightly colored environments that are soaked with some pretty impressive lighting effects.

This star chamber, our assemblage of jaded critics, busily debates the merits and potential demerits of the year's best games in each gaming genre, as well as the best game-related hardware, in order to determine the winners of the CGW Premier Awards. Finalists are gleaned from those games that have scored highest with our readers in the Top 100, appeared the most times in \"Playing Lately?\" polls, sold well in the marketplace, been well received by our regular contributors, and caused our editors' girlfriends and spouses to become jealous of a computer game. Next, the editors play as many of the finalists as possible. Primary consideration in determining the winners is based on the editorial panel's evaluation of a given game's advancement of the gaming experience; performance within game genre or hardware component standards; and quality of innovation, play balance, and aesthetic presentation. CGW bestows the Game of the Year award to that gaming experience which transcends genre boundaries and advances the entire state of the gaming art beyond other game considerations. And now, the winners.... ACHIEVEMENT OF EXCELLENCE www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. APRIL 1999 "

"THE BEST OF THE YEAR ***** Game of the Year ***** PREMIER AWARDS 19.9 HALF-LIFE or the foreseeable future, every shooter released will have to face one tough question: \"How does it compare to HALFLIFE?\" Transcending and revolutionizing the first-person shooter, HALF-LIFE ranks without question as a landmark game, a milestone that in time will prove significant in the nascent history of gaming. In retrospect, what HALF-LIFE accomplished seems so obvious it's a wonder no one did it before. It started with the story. Realizing the true potential of the first-person perspective, Valve made sure that every plot element happened to you. No distancing, third-person cut-scenes to shove the plot forward, in HALF-LIFE the characters around you spoke directly to you—and you could interact with them, getting them to help you, heal you, or join you. Beautifully paced, the developing story gripped you, engaged you emotionally, and kept you playing just so you could find out what would happen next. HALF-LIFE's handling of boss monsters was simply a stroke of genius. Discarding the traditional model of tossing one huge, never-before-seen ber-beast at you every few levels, this game 1001 HALF-LIFE ranks without question as a landmark game, a milestone that in time will prove significant in the nascent history of gaming. introduced most of its bosses early, right at the beginning of a sequence of levels. Forced to deal with the tentacled creature, Gonarch, or Gargantua, gamers grew truly to hate them. That kind of emotional investment elevated the killing of those bastards so much that destroying the damned \"Surface Tension\" Apache helicopter was gaming's best, most rewarding moment of the year. Brilliant level design enhanced the experience immensely. Rooms were rarely packed with enemies; instead, monsters were strategically placed and could appear anywhere at any time, creating a pervasive sense of unease. Remarkably, the real-world settings only heightened that feeling of dread as the otherworldly invaders turned it on its head. After being steeped in reality for the majority of the game, the alien dimension of the final levels proved even more disorienting. If CGW gave a Monster of the Year Award, it wouldn't go to HALF-LIFE's houndeyes, alien slaves, or headcrabs-it would go to the Marines. Incredibly brutal and wickedly smart, the top-notch Al of these grunts was so well designed and challenging that if the game had no other enemies it still would have rocked. Shimmering graphics, great puzzles, haunting 3D sound, and a multiplayer game that rivals QUAKE DeathMatching round out a very complete package. Rarely has there been a game as thrilling and enthralling as HALFLIFE. Rarely has a game been more deserving of being named Game of the Year. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

"THE BEST OF THE YEAR ***** Best Action ***** PREMIER AWARDS 199 BATTLEZONE VED NORTO SCOUT cence hile our Game of the Year, HALF-LIFE, most redefined the action niche, all our finalists brought something new to table. RAINBOW SIX deftly mixed strategic planning with nail-biting action as it brought the world of counterterrorist operations to life. HERETIC II proved that the QUAKE Il engine could work in a thirdperson game and that a spellcasting, shirtless elf could actually kick ass. Next to the revolutionary HALF-LIFE, THIEF: THE DARK PROJECT most shook up the shooter genre, replacing traditional run'n'-gun gameplay with a brainbusting, tense, first-person game that emphasized stealth and thinking over reflexes. But it was Activision's action/ strategy hybrid BATTLEZONE that really broke new ground. Taking place in an alternate past during which the Cold War was fought on distant planets, BATTLEZONE put gamers inside a missile-spitting hovertank and then let them harvest resources, build defenses, and (best of all) create hordes of other tanks to help battle those godless Commies. The graphics were dropdead gorgeous, the multiplayer game was a blast, and the game sported a beautifully designed interface that made commanding your forces an intuitive breeze, By excelling in every aspect of design gameplay, BATTLEZONE handily earned Action Game of the Year recognition By excelling in every aspect of design gameplay, BATTLEZONE handily earned Action Game of the Year.

"* Best RPG * BALDUR'S GATE he Advanced Dungeons & Dragons license could well have been named \"Most Abused License of All Time\" prior to this year. There really hasn't been an AD&D-licensed product that added to the gaming experience since the old SSI \"gold box\" games. Then along came BALDUR'S GATE. Interplay promised us that its developer, Bioware, would be faithful to the spirit of AD&D while providing an up-to-date, technologically advanced engine. We were, to say the least, skeptical. SIS : Ves L, COTOIL THE EYESI K ACHOK We've never seen character alignment and character attributes handled as well as they are in BALDUR'S GATE. We are skeptical no more. From character creation through character interaction and on to party management and combat, BALDUR'S GATE is an exceptional product. We've never seen character alignment and character attributes handled as well as they are in BG. Put characters of opposite alignments in the same party and you're asking for internecine warfare. Put a character with high charisma in the lead and you're likely to get optimal discounts from the local merchants and more information than you'd expect from nonplayer characters. Bioware must be commended for the detailed character sketches behind each character. The runner-up, New World Computing's MIGHT AND MAGIC VI, was a gigantic, addictive hack-'n-slash-and not much in the depth department. Still, for 80 hours or so, it was a definite hoot to play.

Multiplayer on Jane's Combat.net is a blast, with both dogfights and full missions available. However, the scripted feel of many of the Jane's missions gave EUROPEAN AIR WAR the edge.

It's not just the physics that make Infogrames' INDEPENDENCE WAR the best space sim this year, there's also great mission design behind it. Rather than the \"fly to a waypoint and kill everything there\" missions found in other games, INDEPENDENCE WAR gives you tasks such as neutralizing an antimatter bomb or using a remote-controlled freighter to destroy a space station. While the intership battles do sometimes become turn-and-shoot fights, there's often an element of naval warfare to them as well. And the software graphics engine the best we've ever seen—was bolstered by superb 3Dfx enhancement in the U.S. release. DESCENT: FREESPACE also proved to be an excellent game, featuring some of the best wingman Al to hit the genre, but it was too derivative of previous space sims. The more original INDEPENDENCE WAR, in light of its innovative design and great gameplay, clearly led the field and earned the award. INDEPENDENCE WAR na genre in which Hollywood-style glitz is all too often the focus, it took physics to make a standout title.

How else to explain that in one of the weakest years for strategy gaming in recent memory, the best real-time strategy game in memory-recent or otherwise-is released?

This game had everything and executed it ingeniously. Three truly unique races with three truly unique unit sets, creating a gameworld of seemingly endless strategic depth. A compelling story artfully told through cut-scenes, mission briefings, and the missions themselves.

We know this. We know that taking a turn at 120 miles an hour and crashing into a wall would probably kill you in real life. But you know what? We don't care. No driving game released in 1998 came close to matching the sheer visceral thrills of Electronic Arts' utterly addicting arcade driving game, in both its single and multiplayer forms. The game's Hot Pursuit mode, in which you can either play a cop or be pursued by one, was one of our favorite braindead guilty pleasures of the year. It didn't hurt that NFSIII featured gorgeous 3D graphics and the best implementation of force-feedback to date. No racing game in 1998 was more fun to play. And sometimes, you know, that's what it's all about. At the exact opposite end of the spectrum, ironically, we have our runner-up: Sierra Sports' GRAND PRIX LEGENDS. Arguably the most ambitious and realistic driving simulation to date modeling the thrills and difficulties of Grand Prix racing circa 1967—it is also perhaps the toughest to play. It's an awesome game for those who can handle it. In a less competitive year, Ubi Soft's excellent F1 RACING SIMULATION would have won hands down. The sequel, just released, may fare better in '99.

After all, almost anything that follows the award-winning 21 BATTLEGROUND series risks failing to meet high expectations. Now that THE OPERATIONAL ART OF WAR has brought us back again and again for endless campaigning, why we ever worried...we'll never know. Combining the best elements of a turn-based format with a number of clever subsystems, the game re-creates 20th-century warfare like no other.

BROOD WAR surpasses the original in terms of story, a feature that wasn't lacking in the first place. No other add-on released in 1998 so significantly perfected and enhanced the original game as much as BROOD WAR did. Some gamers might scoff at BROOD WAR adding \"only\" six all-new units, but those six units are an example of quality versus quantity, and they do much to tweak the game balance. The Zerg now have a defensive measure, the Terrans have medical support, the Protoss have powerful new spells, and all three races gain better air-to-air support Also, BROOD WAR adds three new tile sets (with their own unique critters) and a host of new multiplayer maps. Finally, BROOD WAR surpasses the original STARCRAFT in terms of story, a feature that wasn't lacking in the first place.

"THE BEST OF THE YEAR *** Best Hardware ** PREMIER AWARDS 19.9 AUREAL VORTEX 2 & DIAMOND MX300 OISTA PGI AUDIO ACCELERATAN he past year proved to be a very good one for PC gaming hardware. 3D graphics got prettier and faster. Force-feedback finally arrived on the scene in full, um, force. Memory and CPUs got cheap. And PC audio grew a third dimension. For this year's Hardware Product of the Year, we thought seriously about nVidia's venerable RIVA TNT, the first 2D/3D chipset to outgun a single Voodoo. But we've given awards to 3D graphics chipsets for the past several years; we decided it was time for a change So this year, the award goes to Aureal Semiconductor's Vortex 2 audio chipset and Diamond Multimedia's MonsterSound MX300. Aureal first brought convincing 3D audio to the PC market and helped move audio to the PCI bus two years ago with its Vortex chipset and DIAMOND its A3D API to make 3D audio programming easier for developers. The Vortex 2 chipset adds more rendering horsepower, as well as rendering features like occlusion and reflection Games like JEDI KNIGHT and, more recently, HALF-LIFE and THIEF: THE DARK PROJECT have shown what a difference good 3D audio can make in a game.

This graphics chip-maker entered the PC industry on a sour note four years ago with its ill-fated NV-1 multimedia processor, which aspired to be a Ginsu, cutting through all kinds of media, but wound up as table scraps. Undaunted by the setback, nVidia, then a privately funded company, knew it had one more shot at success in this brutally competitive market. So nVidia aimed squarely to accelerate Direct3D, and later OpenGL, and decided to forgo a proprietary API. The company scored. And it scored big with the RIVA 128, proving that a card that accelerated only standard APIs well could thrive. More recently nVidia unleashed the RIVA TNT, the first 2D/3D board to challenge the supremacy of the mighty Voodoo? With its latest, the TNT2. nVidia will remain a tough competitor throughout this year. NVIDIA www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. APRIL 1999 103 "

"Up to My Neck in You REDEMPTION's story (which hard-core fans will be thrilled to know was developed with White Wolf's direct input and was co-written by longtime Vampire writer Daniel Greenberg) begins in 12th Century Prague. You play the role of Christof Romauld, a holy knight employed by the Church, a vampire killer who, in the game's beginning, is \"embraced\" by a vampire, thus becoming the very thing he despises most. As he grapples with his spiritual anguish, he also finds himself caught up in an immense struggle between warring vampire clans. This forms the core concern of the game: Can Christof transcend his despair to help the forces of the \"good\" vampires, or will he just succumb to the beast within? And how does one be, good, when you're forced to live off the blood of humans? The game's levels are divided into four \"hubs\" and two acts. The first act is set in the Dark Ages and includes the Prague scenes, followed by a shift to Vienna. Nihilistic's designers and artists poured over reference books and history books to capture the look and feel of those cities, as well as to reference the religious and political events and attitudes of the era. Concept art of the architecture, done by the legendary Peter Chan (who worked on DAY OF THE TENTACLE, JEDI KNIGHT, GRIM FANDANGO—and, most recently, the Star Wars: Episode 7 film) revealed what Nihilistic is after here: historically faithful settings, but ones with a dark, macabre, almost organically alive quality. Buoyed by a dark, orchestral score, the game's first half will have a distinctly gothic feel. Halfway through the game, however, Christofand the player-are in for a seriously rude awakening. Christof falls into a vampiric torpor for about 800 years, and wakes up in modern-day London. This is the locale of the game's third hub, followed by the climax in New York City. Now, in addition to all your other problems—still raging on in the immortal world of the vampires--you have to learn how this new world works, and how you fit into it. In this modern world, you have to deal with punk-rock vampires and Mafiosi-style gangster Warsonore the COVER STORY sonuetade: Redemption.

"COVER STORY Heart of the Gaia, Werewolf: The Apocalypse—Heart of the Gaia DreamForge's Follow-up to SANITARIUM Is Another Fever-pitched Nightmare by Jeff Green aybe it's something in the water. Maybe it's those long months stuck out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by snow. Or maybe, at root, they're just a bunch of weirdos. Whatever the cause, the fact is that the folks at DreamForge Intertainment in Greensburg, Pennsylvania are tapping into some weird crevices of their minds to create some of the most memorally twisted computer games around right now. DreamForge's previous game was the brilliant, nightmarish SANITARIUM, which just tied with LucasArts' GRIM FANDANGO for CGW's Best Adventure Game of the Year award elsewhere in this issue. Now the team is hard at work on its next game, WEREWOLF: THE APOCALYPSE-HEART OF THE GATA. And after braving the freezing weather and spending some time with the team, I'm here to report that the fevered minds at DreamForge have another disturbing experience on their hands. Be very afraid. DON'T BE SCARED It's you, in Crinos form. This badass is 9-feet tall and not afraid to use those claws. He also regenerates health points. Nocturne  Vampire The Masquerade: Redlemption Werewolf: The Apocalypse ME, MYSELF, AND I In WEREWOLF, you'll constantly morph between three forms-a teenage boy, a wolf, and a 9foot tall wolfman. Night of the Long Knives Like VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE, WEREWOLF is based on the pen-and-paper role-playing game of the same name from White Wolf Publishing (see \"Doggie Style\" sidebar, page 125), and takes place in White Wolf's goth/punk horror universe known as the World Of Darkness a world, not unlike our own, except for the minor detail that the Apocalypse is at hand and monsters roam the earth. The horror is not just \"out there,\" though it's internal and personal, as you play a werewolf. As envisioned by White Wolf, werewolves are complicated, often tragic creatures not simply the snarling, hairy beasts of cheesy old horror movies. The RPG's mythology is actually so detailed and complex that it can't possibly be done justice here, but here is the cheat-sheet overview: the Garou, as the werewolves are called, are seen as ages-old protectors of the Earth, or Gaia, fighting against the creeping corruption of the world by the Wyrm, the physical and symbolic manifestation of evil. Once rulers over the earth and mankind (which is why they Genre: Action/RPG Publisher: ASC Games are hated and feared by humans), the Garou have dispersed and grown few in Developer: DreamForge Intertainment number over the centuries, while the Wyrm continues its evil march towards Release Date: 04.99 the Apocalypse. Stopping the Wyrm, and coming to grips with one's identity as www.ascgames.com a supernatural beast, is what WEREWOLF is all about. IZU COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. APRIL 1999 "


"In HEART OF THE GAIA, DreamForge plunges us into this nightmare world with its own particular tale of violent, psychological terror. It is the story of Ryan McCullough, a teenage boy who learns, as the game opens, that he is a werewolf. Over the course of five episodesset in London, Greece, the U.S., Mexico, and the \"Umbra\" (spirit world) -Ryan learns of his heritage, of his new powers as a werewolf, and of his key role in the war against the Wyrm. VaVeew a re. COVER STORY docal eaus e Dog Eat Dog In SANITARIUM, DreamForge crafted what was essentially an \"old school\" game, both gameplayand graphics-wise. In WEREWOLF, they make a quantum leap towards the cutting edge. The team has licensed the UNREAL engine, and is using it to create a take-no-prisoners action-RPG that, even in the early stage in which I viewed it, is brimming with creativity. While some levels maintain a relative sense of \"normalcy\" like the U.S. episode set at the headquarters of the Wyrm-infested Pentex Inc., by the time you get to the Umbra, all sense of reality has vanished, and you're exploring a world of pure, horrific imagination. WEREWOLF maintains UNREAL's graphic sophistication, but adds an off-kilter sense of unease throughout the 20 levels that is distinctly DreamForge's-\"Oz meets David Lynch,\" as Paul Warne, one of the game's level designers, aptly described it. Gone is UNREAL's gee-whiz prettiness, replaced instead with a darker, more surreal look steeped in dread and fear. Just as Valve made the QUAKE engine its own for HALF-LIFE, DreamForge is reshaping the UNREAL engine to suit its own twisted purposes. First, you will be able to switch dynamically between firstand third-person perspectives and you will need to use both as you make your way through the game's varied action and puzzle-oriented sequences. In third-person perspective, DreamForge is implementing a translucent camera effect for your character so that your view will never be blocked. The coolest bit of technology I saw, however, was the game's morphing effect. As a werewolf, you'll be able to morph onthe-fly between three different forms: Homid (human) Crinos (a 9-foot-tall half man/half wolf) and Lupus (wolf). The animated effect is awesome to behold in both firstand third-person perspectives, and the way the 100 100100 game feels and looks (the interface changes MORPH FACTOR Here's a morph in progress, as to reflect your current vou change into Crinos form. You can morph form) is far more varwhile standing still or on-the-fly. ied than in the standard action shooter. The levels have been designed to emphasize different Garou skills. Certain places and puzzles require you to assume specific forms, and each form has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For example, as a Crinos, EAT IT CASPER Firearms play a role in WEREWOLF, you are a badass but not as much as in standard first-person superbeast with shooters. That's a ghost with his hands up, pumped-up physical preparing to meet his maker-again. alaro Nocturne Vampire The Masquerades Reciemption, COMPUTER GAMING WORLD APRIL 1999 121 "

"Nocturne COVER_STORY Nocturne Take on the Children of the Night in This Grisly Shooter by Robert Coffey hen we first saw NOCTURNE, we thought, for one brief moment, it was just another third-person action/adventure game. That was before the zombie hordes. That was before the main character literally shot the head off one of the lindead, the severed noggin hitting the ground like a piata filled with chili. That was before the ghouls overwhelmed the hero, clubbing him with their own severer limbs before feasting on his guts. And that was right allout the time we knew we couldn't wait to play NOCTURNE. CEMETARY POLKA The Stranger deals with a pack of blood-dripping zombies in a chilly graveyard. Notice how some of the undead are wielding the blown-off limbs of their cohorts. Werewolf: The Apocalypse-Heart of the Gaia Vampire The Masquerade: Redemption Sin City Terminal Reality deserves kudos for not setting their game in the standard post-apocalyptic universe. Instead, NOCTURNE posits an alternative past, one where a paranormally aware Theodore Roosevelt, in an effort to counteract growing supernatural threats, created a special investigation bureau unofficially dubbed the Spook House. The game actually takes place some 40-50 years later, circa 1940, when the Spook House, staffed with mysterious agents and turncoat monsters, is operating in a new, worldwide jurisdiction under the watchful eye of the United Nations. Gamers will play as one of two characters: either the Shadow-like Stranger or female scientific genius Doc Holliday, though only the Stranger was available in the exclusive build I got to play. With his dark features, flowing trenchcoat, and a fedora pulled low to his eyes, the Stranger is a figure straight out of the pulp fiction that is part of the inspiration for NOCTURNE. There will be other Spook House agents available to players, just in the role of NPCs. Each of the NPCs has special expertise that the gamer will need to use in order to solve puzzles, kill monsters, and generally progress in the game. NPCs run the gamut, including a beautiful young Italian gunslinger named Gabriella; a former heavyweight boxer who's added extra punch to his fists courtesy of some wicked blades; a Cajun voodoo master who fires magic projectiles and can ethereally pass through obstacles; and a Romanian vampire hunter whose half-vampire heritage makes her particularly effective-if not especially fun to be around. Genre: Action Publisher: Gathering of Developers Developer: Terminal Reality Release Date: Q4 '99 www.godgames.com Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be The Spook House adversaries come directly from the world of classic horror, Snarling werewolves, misshapen vampires, vampire brides, mindless zombies, and entrail-munching ghouls are just some of the hideous creatures you'll bloodily 132 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD APRIL 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"COVER STORY dispatch. Absolutely grisly, these are not the campy, winking renditions of monsters we've seen in other games. For examples, the zombies look like something straight out of Night of the Living Dead, each shambling corpse in a different state of gooey putrescence. Slow and stupid, zombies attack in enormous packs, happy to just rip into you with their arms or to bludgeon you with the severed arm or head of a fallen comrade. NOCTURNE's emphasis on the ghastly is perhaps no more evident than when you die at the hands of ghouls. No pleasant \"Game Over\" screen hereyou're treated to the sight of the ghouls falling upon your body and feasting, making delightfully wet slurping sounds. Ideally, you'll be watching yourself kill the undead, not vice versa. Taking place from a third-person perspective, you'll stride through dank castles and desolate graveyards in your quest to rid the world of unnatural menaces. I found combat to be extremely gratifying, even though only a couple of weapons were included in the early build I played. Still, a well-placed shot could blow the head off a ghoul while unloading lead into their midsection could rip those horrors right in half. My favorite weapon was the crossbow, especially when I used the burning bolts. Doomed ghouls, crossbow bolts stuck in their neck and belly, fire spreading across their limbs, desperately tried to stop the onslaught before falling at my feet—that's true, killing satisfaction. In NOCTURNE, generally the best way is the goriest way. A typical situation might involve a monster guarding a key you need atop a platform with a giant swinging blade. You could waste some of your precious ammo trying to kill the beast, or you could just lure him into the blade so he's hacked to bits. Bribing him with dinner and a movie just isn't an option. Nocturne  Werewolf: The Apocalypse ----Heart of the Gaia  Vampire The Masquerade: Redemption THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS Things aren't always what they seem in NOCTURNE. Here an apparent mirror reflection turns out to be a shape-shifting horror mimicking our hero, Get It Hot Graphically, NOCTURNE is simply dazzling. The rendering engine uses a skeletal animation system for smooth, lifelike character movement, thus heightening the gamer's suspension of disbelief. The use of dynamic physics further means that characters look and move like real humans—no more TOMB RAIDER-esque 10-foot backflips from a dead standstill. An advanced real-time dithering technique lets the engine operate in High Color, outputting one billion colors instead of the 24 million of True Color. Volumetric fogging will allow characters to hide in fog banks rolling off a pier while volumetric lighting effects help create an appropriately creepy www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. APRIL 1999 133 "


"Light and Shadow ne of the most impressive aspects of the NOCTURNE rendering engine is its handling of light. Everything is lit with volumetric lighting, casting real shadows on the characters and environments in the game. By its very nature, volumetric lighting is interactive, not canned, mapped, or pre-scripted, and occurs in real time. You can really see this in the way NOCTURNE deals with light reflection and shadows. In the first screenshot, Gabriella stands in a dark room before a mirror. What little you see in the mirror is shrouded in darkness. In the second shot, light from Gabriella's flashlight bounces back to illuminate her. In the last shot, Gabriella moves the light to her left, falling into darkness herself while the reflected light reveals a doorway previously hidden in darkness. In the bottom two screenshots, notice how the shape of the shadows from the bookstand, the Stranger and even the dead ghoul on the ground has subtly shifted in response to the repositioning of the Stranger's lantern. COVER_STORY Werewolf: The Apocalypse-Heart of the Gaia Vampire The Masquerade: Redemption  NOCLurne atmosphere (see \"Light and Shadow\" sidebar). Indicative of NOCTURNE's staggering attention to detail is the way the long, flowing coats of the characters are handled. Where other companies would be content to bang out a nice little coat animation, Terminal Reality has gone to the trouble of folding a cloth modeling program into the game, allowing cloth objects to move independently in the game. This means coats flutter as they SWING TIME Now that the big, swinging blade is showering the room with trail a moving character, whip undead body parts, the Stranger will have a better chance to retrieve the above their head as they fall key on the platform. in a pit, or hug their calves as they step backward.

"IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE Pentium III-A Must Have? Pretty Impressive Test Results, but Game Support Needed Pentium III 3D WinBench 99 Results Table Transform 81.2 Pentium II Pentium III Percent Improved Transform & Lighting 36 70.9 22.9 by Dave Salvator s you read this, Pentium III (Katmai) chips are just beginning to ship. While it has a CPU core that's identical to the Pentium II, the Pentium III has a new feature, called Katmai New Instructions, that's being heavily touted as a must-have for gamers. And from our initial test results, it's likely there will be a Pentium III is in your future. Katmai New Instructions (KNI). which has been rechristened SSIMD—yet another brilliant marketing moniker from the folks who brought you \"Celeron\"—is designed to greatly accelerate matrix math operations, which are key to speeding up transform and lighting operations in a 3D pipeline. Transforms involve calculating polygon movements from frame to frame; geometric lighting involves rendering light sources and the objects they illuminate, rather than using light maps that require multitexturing. game performance, we used 3D WinBench's Transform and Transform & Lighting tests, which test the CPU portion of Direct3D's pipeline. While there wasn't much performance gain in the Transform test, SSIMD showed a whopping 71 percent gain over traditional floatingpoint code in the Transform & Lighting test. So, in a 3D game using Direct3D's T/L engine, SSIMD, like AMD's 3DNow!, can make lighting go much faster, although it doesn't seem to do much for transforms. We also looked at several SSIMD demos, including an upcoming title from Rage called DISPATCHED, which looked good and ran smoothly. At press time, the list of announced SSIMD titles included BATTTLEZONE 2 and HEAVY GEAR 2 by Activision, as well as Microsoft's FLIGHT SIM 2000. Some shipping titles, like DID'S WARGASM and EA's MADDEN '99 will be patched to take advantage of the new technology. Until a game is written to take advantage of SSIMD, it won't really go much faster than it does on current Pentium Ils. But given the impressive gains to be had by using SSIMD (and Intel's dominant market share), developers are likely to use SSIMD in titles for the '99 holiday season. Intel's only real competition this year will come from AMD's new K7 processor, which is due sometime in the latter half of the year. K7 will use AMD'S 3D Now! technology, which also can accelerate transforms and lighting Stay tuned for the 3DNow! KNI shootout here in CGW later this year.-Dave Salvator First Test Results We got our hands on a 500MHz Pentium III on an Intel SE440 motherboard, which uses Intel's 440BX chipset. We put 128MB of 100MHz SDRAM into this guy and took it for a spin. There are two ways to take advantage of SSIMD (SSIMD): either through Direct3D's T/L engine or by writing custom assembly code. SSIMD support will be included in DirectX 6.1, which should be available as you read this. To measure how using SSIMD via Direct3D might enhance 3D Iron Works-TNT, Part Deux As you read this, nVidia has begun shipping its TNT2 graphics accelerator. The biggest news about this part is that it shifts nVidia to 0.25-micron process technology, which shrinks the chip's size and allows it to run faster while putting out less heat. Thanks to this new production process, TNT will clock in at 125MHz, the original design goal of the RIVA TNT. Given that the TNT architecture works on two pixels per clock, this new clock speed will yield a peak fill rate of IRON WORKS 250Mpixels/sec, which will keep nVidia very competitive with ATI's new Rage 128-based cards. Sources inside nVidia suggest that even faster clock rates may be possible. Other highlights include support for a maximum of 32MB of onboard memory, digital flat-panel display support, and AGP 4x support (maximum data rate of 1GB/sec moving data from system memory to the 3D accelerator). -Loyd Case & Dave Salvator BD2 www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD APRIL 1999 "

"3D Babble On 3D Babble on HOOD Making Sense of 3D Testing Verbiage All current-generation graphics cards have onboard video memory, ranging from 2MB to 32MB (more for some very high-end cards). The majority of those cards have a single, unified memory architecture when handling 3D graphics, meaning that both the polygon data and the texture maps (bit-maps) share the card's memory. Voodoo and Voodoo2 are unique in the world of low-cost ack in 1946, W.K. Lessing (using the pseudonym Dolton Edwards) wrote a small masterpiece called Meihem in Ce Klasrum. This short story first appeared in the September 1946 Analog magazine and has been anthologized several times. Written in a satirical, \"modest proposal\" style, it laid out a series of steps that would take the English language to a fully phonetic spelling system. Since there are multiple ways to spell similar pronunciations, the resulting choices outlined in the text made for a hilarious send-up of modern language. I often think of that story when I write product reviews. The jargon we're forced to use in this business can make for some pretty dense reading. So I thought I'd take a deep breath before 1999 hits (it's December 31 as I write this) and talk a bit about some of the 3D jargon that we use when writing reviews. I promise I won't define bilinear filtering yet again. But since we spend a lot of time discussing graphics cards, some of you may be wondering exactly what a few of the terms mean. For the more technically savvy reader, consider this something of a refresher. drawings of an object or creature designed to produce animation. Let's say, for example, that you've got a series of pictures of a tiger with its body and legs in slightly different positions on successive pages. Flip through the pages, and you create the illusion that the tiger is running. Now consider your computer as a flip-book, with one \"page\" being the amount of video data needed to create one screen's worth of graphics. At any given time, the front buffer is that portion of memory holding the page that's currently being displayed. Simultaneously, a separate portion of video memory—the back buffer-is invisibly creating the next image to be displayed. Once the back buffer has a fully rendered image-the next page of game animation-it's \"flipped\" to the front. In reality, what happens itself. When struck by the electron beam, the phosphors light up and you see a pixel. The beam scans the screen one line at a time. The time it takes for the beam to paint all the way across the screen and all the way down to the bottom is the refresh rate. On a 640x480 display, a 75Hz refresh rate means that it takes 1/75 of a second for the electron beam to scan 480 lines down the screen, with each line made up of 640 pixels. This movement of the electron beam across and down the screen is called the vertical retrace. Now, finally, we get to v-sync. In order to get the best image quality, you ideally want each frame of animation to start at the beginning of the electron guns' beam cycle. If the graphics card is fast enough, it can create the back-buffer image just as the electron guns finish \"painting\" the LOYD CASE The jargon we're forced to use in this business can make for some dense reading. the 3D jargon that we use when ca accelerators because they feature a separate chunk of memory just for storing texture maps. The frame buffer is simply that area of video memory that's holding the data currently displayed by the graphics card. But wait, there's more. In your normal, 2D Windows display, the frame buffer changes any time the onscreen image changes. But that process is far too slow for 2D and 3D animation to run at the requisite 30 frames per second or more. Because of their higher graphics needs, games use a technique called page flipping to speed things up. If you've ever seen an animation flip-book, you already know what page flipping is. A flip-book is a small book with a series of is that a few bits change values and the memory that was once invisible is suddenly visible, and you see the next image. Meanwhile, the area of video memory that had been the front buffer now becomes the back buffer, and the accelerator begins to write graphics data for the next page to that chunk of memory. Using a front buffer and a single back buffer is a process called double buffering. Webster Can't Help You Now When I think of the jargon we've come to rely on in writing reviews of 3D accelerators, three terms in particular come to mind: V-sync, refresh rate and frame buffer. Three other terms related to these are back buffers, front buffers, and page flipping. Of the initial three, V-sync is probably the most difficult to understand, but to do so you need first to understand the other terms. front-buffer image on your screen. The back buffer then gets flipped—becoming the front buffer—just as the electron guns start their refresh cycle. In reality, performance can vary. If the back buffer isn't quite finished, the game will wait until it is finished—and the image you see for the next refresh cycle doesn't change. Then, when the electron guns start at the top corner again, the now-completed back buffer is flipped and becomes the visible image. This waiting for the electron gun to reach the starting point is called flip on v-sync, or vsync for short. The flip is waiting for the vertical retrace to start at the beginning in other words, the page flipping is synchronized to the vertical retrace—and that's Don't Get (Re)Fresh Now let's talk about refresh rate, which is the rate at which your monitor's three electron guns (red, blue, and green) paint the screen. Inside your monitor these guns send a beam of electrons to strike the phosphors on the screen 142 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD APRIL 1999 www.computergaming.com "


"where the term V-sync comes from. This creates a problem when measuring the performance of a graphics card. If a card barely misses the vertical retrace and has to wait another cycle on a regular basis, that means the graphics card is sitting there doing nothing. But when you measure performance, you want to measure the component actually doing something. In fact, you get odd harmonics of the refresh rate as your frame rate. For example, if the refresh rate is 60Hz, and you see that the game is reporting 30 frames per secondhalf the refresh rate—that's an immediate cue that the card is sitting idle much of the time. The trick for testing is to turn off v-sync, meaning that the back buffer is flipped to the front buffer as soon as it's filled with data, even if the electron guns haven't reached the end of the refresh cycle. This means that the image on your screen may not be fully painted when the next frame is flipped. The electron beam doesn't start over-it just paints the next pixel, which is from a new buffer. In the extreme, this can cause some really grotesque image quality problems, called tearing, but it is useful for measuring performance, because the card never sits idle. That, simply put, is why we turn off V-sync when doing 3D graphics card game testing. Turning off v-sync during gameplay is not a good idea, however, because of tearing. A good compromise is triple buffering. Triple Tech Tips On the Clock If you have an Intel Socket 7 motherboard with the 430VX chipset that uses SDRAM (they first shipped about two years ago), and you're looking to add memory to your system, you're going to need a slightly different type of SDRAM. When this new memory first started appearing in systems, the industry hadn't settled on a standard, but Intel went ahead and implemented what's called two-clock SDRAM on these early motherboards. Well, as Murphy's Law would have it, the industry went the other way and standardized on four-clock SDRAM, which is what you now find at your local computer store. The two memory types are, of course, incompatible. So, you may want to order this memory from an outfit that specializes in memory, such as Crucial Technology (www.crucial.com) or Kingston (www.kingston.com). buffering means using a second back buffer three buffers in all. It uses more memory, but now the game will run at full speed, up to the refresh rate. If you crank up the resolution, triple buffering becomes a good performance measure if the card can't match its frame rate to the refresh rate. in our 3D graphics card reviews and roundups. If it still has you scratching your head, don't feel too bad this is complex stuff by any measure. 3D graphics involves so many parts of your system that it's important to understand where the potential bottlenecks are and how to properly gauge performance. It may take a while to grasp, but at least you'll experience a little less, ah, meihem, the next time you read one of our hardware reviews.

But Pentium Ills will be shipping about the time you're reading this, and you should take a good look at them to decide if the price difference is worth the investment. The reasons to get Pentium Ill are pretty compelling. With its Katmai New Instructions (KNI), Pentium Ills will be able to make the front end of 3D graphics pipelines move along a good deal faster (upwards of 70 percent faster) than their predecessor, provided the game you're playing is Katmai-aware. A bit less compelling, but worth considering, is that Pentium III's top clock rate will debut at 500MHz. The Pentium III should drop into current 440BX motherboards, though you'll need a BIOS update. If Pentium III's initial price tag feels too steep for your blood, you might consider the much less expensive 400MHz Celeron-A, and wait until Pentium Ills make their way down the price curve. Given that Katmai-aware titles won't be out in any great number until the latter part of this year, Katmai's main benefit to gamers won't be greatly evident until then.-Dave Salvator GAME.

"ATI RAGE FURY REVIEW COMPUTER GAMING ATI's True Colors EDITORS\" EDITORS: CHOICE Rage Fury Is Ready to Churn Out 32-Bit Color HARDWARE Du by Loyd Case hile testing the ATI Rage Fury, I had to run it through our benchmarking suite quite a few times to make sure what I really saw was real. also pumped more games through it than usual, including some 2D games. While the drivers still need some fixes, my verdict on this card is wow! ATI bases the Rage Fury on its latest 3D accelerator, the Rage 128, which is the second 2D/3D accelerator to combine two rendering pipelines on a single chip (the first being the RIVA TNT). In addition to the twin pipelines, Rage 128 also has two on-chip caches, one for texture data and one for pixel data. Like the TNT, the Rage 128 has an 8-bit stencil buffer, but unlike the TNT, it has a full 32-bit Z-buffer. ATI has also used its interest in video (as in the television style) and has implemented algorithms that should accelerate the software decompression of MPEG 2 video, which is the compression scheme used by DVD video. One interesting feature is the use of bidirectional direct memory execution, meaning that AGP can be used for all graphics data, not just 3D texture information. The Fury ships with a staggering 32MB RAM. Only a year ago, most systems shipped with 32MB. Since ATI is using high-density SDRAM, there are only four memory chips on the board itself. The Fury also has TV-out. ATI will be shipping an Xpert 128, with 16MB of RAM and a Rage Magnum, which has 32MB but lacks TV out. Later down the road, ATI will be building an \"All-in-Wonder\"-style board with the Rage 128 chip. (pun intended). Interestingly. And They're Off... QUAKE II ran faster in 32-bit color Synthetic benchmarks came than in 16-bit color at 800x600. back quite impressive. The Rage INCOMING's performance dropped 128 easily outpaced the competioff only a few frames per second. tion in WinBench 99 and 3D OpenGL performance in 16-bit WinBench 99. Running 3D color seems to be the weakest link WinBench 99 at 32-bit color for the Rage 128. The good news yielded a score of 458-only a is that an OpenGL driver will ship few points behind the RIVA TNT with the card. 16-bit scores. Running tests in MOTORHEADThe picture isn't completely which allows you to set a wide rosy, however. In many ways, the variety of parameters, including Rage Fury is better positioned for setting up for 32-bit rendering and future games than today's titles. It using true-color textures (instead is, in fact, slower in 3D game per of 16-bit textures)-proved interformance at 16-bit color than the esting. When running in 16-bit RIVA TNT or even the Savage3D mode (with all other rendering though it does outpace 3Dfx's features cranked up), the Rage Banshee chip. When bumped up to Fury edged ahead of the TNT. 32-bit color, the picture changes Running in full 32-bit glory, the PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS card still pumped out nearly 25fps at 1280x1024. I also checked out FALCON 4.0, EUROPEAN AIR WAR and BALDUR'S GATE, a 2D game capable of 32-bit effects. Those titles, at least, seemed pretty solid. However, there were still a few glitches with the driver, like the MOTORHEAD AutoPlay menu crashing upon exiting the game. Overall, though, the drivers seemed fairly well behaved. The bottom line is that the Rage Fury is a solid performer with today's titles and is well positioned for tomorrow's true-color games. And at $199 for a whopping 32MB RAM, it's a great deal, too.

Diamond has the solution with Home Free, a wireless network. Home Free uses 2.4GHz spreadspectrum radio transmissions to network computers almost any where within a 150-foot range of each other. It's available in two versions: the Desktop Pac, with one ISA and one PCI network card; and the Combo Pac, with one ISA and one laptop PC Card. Single cards can also be purchased. Installation is a breeze, requiring no knowledge of networking, Network transmis. sions are encrypted, so you don't have to worry about a Home Freeusing neighbor snooping your files. Home Free transmission is rated at 1 Mbit/sec, one-tenth the speed of a typical wired Ethernet setup but three times faster than typical electric-socket or phone-line networks. Speed varies depending on the location of the computers and potential interference sources. In one location, a 2MB file copied in 33 seconds between a Home Freeequipped desktop and a laptop (about 500 Kbit/sec). A third machine, blocked from view of the first by a metal desk, took a whopping 2 minutes 50 seconds to copy the same file. Compare this to less than 4 seconds to copy the file over a 10-BaseT Ethernet network. You won't want to install large games, but Home Free is plenty fast for most gaming and Web browsing. The most important fac tor in gaming is ping time, and at 10-14 milliseconds, Home Free provided very smooth play in HALFLife and EUROPEAN AIR WAR. The included Internet sharing software works wonderfully with a cable modem, and it's not bad on a 56Kbps phone connection as long as APPEAL: Two-computer households where wiring is impractical. PROS: Easily installed; transparent Internet sharing: great for laptops. CONS: Sensitive to location; signal may cause speaker buzz. REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95/98, available expansion slot.

You'll need to make sure that all your machines are placed where they get a clear signal. That's not as big a deal when one PC is a laptop, and moving to the other side of the couch may clear things up. A bigger concern is that, while Home Free didn't interfere with cordless phones, its signal was strong enough to cause a quiet background static on my PC's speakers when they were turned up t o high volume. (Home Free did disrupt the signal on a Wavecom wireless video transmitter in my house.) If your home setup is conducive to a wired network, use that. But if cables aren't an option, Home Free provides good performance, and the wireless setup is especially well suited to laptop use. CGW photo: Michael Falconer REVIEW PLEXTOR ULTRAPLEX 40MAX Plextor's Good Vibes ULTRAPLEX 40 max by Loyd Case ne of the problems with high-speed CD-ROM drives has been vibration. Some CDs, particularly those with elaborate silkscreened labels, tend to COMPUTER GAMING WORLD ** ** wobble a bit. At high speeds (20% and above), the vibration can become severe enough to be annoying and cause misreads. Various manufacturers have tried to solve this problem, usually by detecting the vibration condition and slowing the drive down. Plextor, the specialist in high-performance CD-ROM drives, has a better solution. Using a twin, sliding ball bearing approach, the mechanism in the UltrapleX 40Max actually balances unbalanced CDs as they rotate. Think of it as dynamically adjustable tire weights that keep a tire balanced. Plextor also makes the 40Max available in either Wide or UltraWide SCSI formats. The Ultra-Wide drive is really nice if you have ultrawide SCSI drives, because you can minimize your cable connections. At first blush, performance isn't as good as some IDE CDROM drives. The drive generates a CD WinBench 99 score of 1330, whereas the Pioneer 7045 cranks out a score of 1450. But digging deeper, we discover the transfer rate of the Plextor is much higher. This showed in a full installation of BALDUR'S GATE, which takes 2.4GB of disk space and cranks through five CDs. The Plextor finished the install a full CD ahead of the IDE drive. The lower CD WinBench score was probably due to the weighting that CD WinBench gives to access time: The Plextor's average access time is 93ms, a bit slower than many current IDE drives. The utilities are the best part of this drive. Plextor Manager installs in your system tray and APPEAL: Moves data really fast. Quiet for a high speed drive PROS: Fast transfer rate; vibration-free CONS: Access time isn't among the best pricey in today's market REQUIREMENTS: PC with SCSI host adapter Price: $155 (street) Manufacturer: Plextor Santa Clara, CA (800) 475-3986 www.plextor.com allows you to set the spin-down time, change the speed of the CD, and perform digital audio extraction over the SCSI bus. There's also a Windows 9x driver installed that lets you manipulate Redbook (CD) audio data as if they were standard WAV filespretty cool stuff. The bottom line is that if you already have SCSI, then the 40Max is the drive to have. But if your system is IDE-based, you might consider some of the new 5x DVD drives that are coming out.

"REVIEW  AVB FBW-1 FORCE FEEDBACK RACING WHEEL Show of Force Foodbas HARDWARE by Dave Salvator know what you're thinking: \"Another force-feedback wheel?! Sheesh! Enough already!\" But this new wheel from AVB is a little different. No, really. For starters, it uses COMPUTER GAMING WORLD *** USB to connect to your PC, a first among force-feedback wheels. And unlike most other force-feedback wheels, it has a two-position shifter for gear changing. The FBW-1 greatly resembles Guillemot's Race Leader wheel, and it appears that both wheels are based on a reference design by Immersion, the company whose l-Force API first brought force-feedback to PC gaming. The two wheels have the same configuration and identical pedals and wall-wart power supply. But unlike Guillemot's offering, the FBW-1 feels solid and renders forces much more realistically. The wheel itself looks a bit like a flight yoke, although you won't get very far driving a plane with this thing, I went for a spin through NEED FOR SPEED III, one of the best force-feedback driving titles to APPEAL: Casual drivers looking for some force-feedback in their lives. PROS: Solid basic design; straightforward installation; good performance. CONS: Forces feel somewhat weak; no bundled editor, wall-wart power supply REQUIREMENTS: DOS 5.0 for sound card-only support; Pentium 166 or better with USB and Windows 98. Price: $149 Manufacturer: AVB Santa Fe Springs, CA (562) 903.7002 www.avbtech.com date, and the FBW-1 rendered most forces well, and the wheel felt good. The same can't be said about the unit's pedals, which are weakly sprung and don't allow for fast switching, something that's critical for braking. But get ting back to the wheel, most forces felt pretty good, although the wheel didn't render skids when my car began to slide. Its shifter worked well enough, though I found myself using the two thumb buttons for upshift/downshift. These buttons are well positioned for shifting, but sometimes wouldn't completely depress, making me miss a shift. Overall, the FBW-1 is an adequate performer, but there are better wheels to be had—such as Logitech's new Formula Force (which only costs $30 more than the FBW-1). With better pedals and a few button refinements, the FBW-1 would become a more serious contender. Until then, look before you leap. CGW photo: Michael Falconer REVIEW LOGITECH WINGMAN FORMULA FORCE Drive by W Wire by Loyd Case ith its bright red rubber grip, you can't mistake this wheel. Logitech's new Formula Force is another in the seemingly endless series of forceCOMPUTER GAMING WORLD **** feedback steering wheels we've seen over the past few months. Unlike the Microsoft SideWinder wheel, which uses gears in its mechanism and can feel a bit \"notchy\" as a result, the Formula Force uses wires and pulleys for its internal drive, making for a somewhat smoother feel than the SideWinder. Setup is pretty easy, though the clamping mechanism requires you to screw down a pair of clamps every time you mount the wheel. The wheel connects either via USB or a normal serial port; we used USB in our testing. Installing the drivers was straightforward, but the Logitech launcher software default setup was for... QUAKE II. Yep, just what we all want to do is \"drive\" the QUAKE guy around. Maybe the monsters will get out of our way when we honk the horn. APPEAL: Gamers in the market for a smooth-performing wheel. PROS: Very smooth control: good precision, too. CONS: Pedal motions seem coarse: setup software is arcane. REQUIREMENTS: USB port (Windows 98) or free serial port (Windows 95/98). Price: $179.95 (MSRP) Manufacturer: Logitech Fremont, CA (800) 231-7717 www.logitech.com After resetting the wheel to a \"blank\" configuration most Windows driving games allow you to customize the control setup anyway), we booted up NEED FOR SPEED III and SPEEDBUSTERS. At first, the forces seemed a bit weaker than with the Microsoft wheel. A trip to the game controller control panel allowed us to tweak the forces up to 150 percent(!). At those maximums, the effects came through strongly, but weren't overbearing. The rubber grip of the wheel proved quite comfortable, but the plastic foot pedals had very little resistance and were hard to use with any precision. The wheel itself seemed fairly precise, so the car went generally where we wanted. Like all other force-feedback wheels shipped, it will not work with most DOS games. All in all, if you want a forcefeedback wheel that's comfortable, well-mannered, and easy to set up, you can't go wrong with the Formula Force. CGW photo: Michael Falconer 152 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

In the first game, ABE'S ODDYSEE, Abe shut down Rupture Farms, a factory run by the evil and profit-hungry Glukkons, which not only used his fellow Mudokons as slaves but also used their body parts to make Glukkon food products. In ABE's EXODDUS, Abe is called on to shut down yet another evil Glukkon factory. This time, it's Soulstorm Brewery, which is stealing the bones from an ancient Mudokon burial ground to make Soulstorm brew. Abe's mission in EXODDUS is similar to his task in ODDYSEE: Bring down the Glukkon factory EMPLOYEES IN BREWERY EMPLOYEES THIS ZULAG ESCAPCES, WOMCASUALTIES WBT 26 TO GO Abe's overriding goal is to save as many Mudokons as he can by sending them on their way through magic portals.

"KILLEM ! NOT RHESTRA SODO ITO SPEAKINTO THE TV Listen to the Slig voice lock controls and repeat the sounds to open doors and deactivate lightning walls. This is one of many speech puzzles you'll encounter. Able Advice challenging puzzles involve figuring out how to maneuver batches of blind Mudokons through an array of dangerous traps and monsters to safety, especially since Abe has no means of directly engaging hostile creatures. One new ability Abe has acquired is the fart. Yes, he can now expel and detonate his flatulence with deadly results. In addition to speaking to his Mudokon compatriots, Abe can possess nearly all the game's major creatures, from lowly Slig grunts to enemy Glukkon rulers. Once Abe possesses an enemy, he can speak through his puppets to trick other enemy creatures, unlock doors, and activate equipment. This ability is built into numerous puzzles and is definitely not just a gimmick. Abe again faces off against Slig guards and their Glukkon masters. Other enemies he meets along the way are the doglike Slogs and Sloggies; the ravenous and sluglike Fleeches; the robotic Greeters; vicious Scrabs; and the small but deadly Paramites. In addition to the healthy Mudokons from the previous game, EXODDUS also features depressed, angry, sick, and blind Mudokons. These guys need special treatment, whether it's a kind embrace or a slap in the face, before they can be persuaded to jump through a portal. feature. The designers, Oddworld Inhabitants, have remedied this in EXODDUS by completely revising the save feature so you can save anywhere in the game. There is also a quick-save function that reloads the game at the last quicksave position after you die. However, I did find a problem with the new save function. Although you can save anytime you want, past a certain point, the load screen will stop displaying your most recent saved games. The game either should have alerted you when you ran out of display space or otherwise simply displayed all saved games properly. EXODDUS doesn't really suffer from any other problems, except for some extremely difficult levels and the inherent shortcoming of platform games: repetitive game. play. EXODDUS alleviates this problem to a sizeable degree with the speech and possession puzzles, but many times you'll still have to resort to the \"die and reload\" technique of gameplay. Sound in EXODDUS is top-notch, with dynamic music that changes depending on the action. If you get caught sneaking past a guard, the music suddenly picks up. The sound effects are also terrific and the voices for the speaking enemies have real personality. Abe's graphics are good and bad. The few cut-scenes are gorgeous and the prerendered 2D backgrounds are beautiful and full Sligs follow orders, so when disarming Slig voice locks, just copy the voice of the machine. If it laughs, you laugh. Follow it correctly, and the door, lighting bolt, or other obstacle will be lifted. If you're using a Glukkon voice lock though, remember that Glukkons don't \"follow\" anything. If they say \"do it,\" chances are good, whatever the task or obstacle, it will get done.  Disarming bombs is tough, 50 use not only the visual cue of the blinking light, but also the audio cue of the beep the bomb makes. Each beep coincides with the green light, and it's much easier to disarm the bomb by listening for the audio cue and tapping the bomb in tune with the beep, rather than trying to synchronize the blinking and your tap. . The floating metal orbs prevent Abe from chanting. Chant too often and the orbs will hurl lightning bolts at you that will eventually kill you. However, they can be destroyed with exploding farts and the bombs of flying sligs.  In many levels, you'll have to be able to go into a roll immediately, so practice running and hitting the roll button (X on the keyboard, or button 2 on the gamepad). Remember that with the run and roll (unlike the nor mal roll, in which you start from a standing position), once you clear the tunnel or low ceiling you are rolling through you pop back up into running position. Odd Occurrences The biggest shortcoming in ABE'S ODDYSEE was its limited save of style. However, the characters themselves are muddy and some times blocky. The characters' graphics just aren't of the same quality as their animations, which are very lifelike and fluid. Considering that it has been more than a year since ABE'S ODDYSEE, Abe and his supporting cast should look better in this game. Unfortunately, the engine appears to be the same one used in ODDYSEE, with little improvement. In most respects, ABE'S EXODDUS is a good game. However, it's more a continuation of ABE'S ODDYSEE than it is a full-fledged sequel. It has some innovative gameplay and a very stylized look, but nothing that fans of the original won't have already seen. I really enjoyed the personality of the game's various creatures, especially the Glukkons, as well as the game's overall art style. However, many times during the game, I saw EXODDUS for what it really is: a smart platformer, with all the pluses and minuses that genre implies. Those who appreciate twitch puzzles and the repetitive \"die-reload\" gameplay inherent in platformers will find an enjoyable game. Others lured by the promise of a live world and truly interactive characters had best wait for the next Oddworld adventure. CGW JUNGLE BOOGIE Abe's newest adventure takes him to several new locales, including the jungles of Necrum and the vaults where the bones of buried Mudokons lie.

"REVIEW  ROGUE SQUADRON ACTILO Your Roots Are Showing LucasArts' Arcade Shooter Hampered by N64 Legacy along your wings, or the light effects from your engines. Environmental details are also very cool: Dust clouds kick up when you skim a planet's surface and your blasters create ripples when fired into water. by Thierry Nguyen emember the first time you saw the destruction of the Death Star? LucasArts' ROGUE SQUADRON tries to capture that experience and the sheer thrill of flying an X-Wing and shooting up enemy TIEs. It does a decent job, but it's held back by limitations stemming from its console roots. HOODED FALCON While it's cool to fly the Millennium Falcon (if you did well enough on earlier missions), ships and structures seem to appear out of thin air on a clear day, due to the short fogging distance. Red-Five Reporting In Make no mistake, ROGUE SQUADRON is an action-arcade game. Even though you're flying some famous Rebel craft, this is exactly like SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE, not X-WING or TIE FIGHTER. The premise is that you're Luke Skywalker, and the Death Star has just been destroyed. Since it's a few years before the next movie, you form Rogue Squadron (with all the cool pilots in the Rebellion) and go off on various adventures which take up 16 game levels. SHADOWS vets will immediately recognize ROGUE SQUADRON's primarily third-person action (there is a first-person view, but it's not very effective). You're slung behind your ship of choice, flying around and constantly firing at enemy fighters. The objective-based missions ask you to do things like escort a rescue ship or destroy specific shield generators. Throughout the game, you'll gain medals, power-ups, and access to new technology and ships. You earn medals based on your performance, and you'll need to earn a gold medal on each mission to unlock secret craft or levels. This adds replay value, as you may need to use a newer ship to redo the old mission and get the commendation. The game requires a 3D card, and it shows. The textures for the individual ships are the most detailed in any Star Wars game, showing off details such as the rivets I Am...Your Father ROGUE SQUADRON is a fun little game, but its problems stem from its N64 heritage. The N64 is less powerful than a good PC, and its fogging distance is short. The PC version of ROGUE SQUADRON seems to have increased the distance, but it's still too short for me. Structures sometimes appear out of thin air. Also, the character sprites are not very detailed. Contrary to the usual LucasArts standards, the sounds also aren't very inspiring. Instead of the fully juiced laser blasts, we get tinny little bleeps that seem to be another N64 leftover. Even with high-fidelity, voice-overs sound as if they're coming through a phone. Finally, some gamers may be annoyed with \"lives.\" I don't mind not saving; I expect that in an arcade shooter. But to make the player have to start a level after crashing three times? I got a bit annoyed when I was stuck at one point, and I kept having to replay much of the level when my lives ran out. All in all, ROGUE SQUADRON is an enjoyable actionarcade game. Just be aware it is very much a child of the N64. CGW COMPUTER GAMIN WORLD ** *** R WARS HEY, YOU, GET OFFA MY CLOUD!

"REVIEW  CARMAGEDDON 2 ACTLON Main Street, USA Fill Your Tank With Fountains of Guts in CARMAGEDDON 2 . by Ken Brown CF BB C Vy 128820 CRED 47/977 MILLS 187) REPAIR COST: 460 ere's the perfect game with which to unleash your inner sadist. The sequel to the bloodsoaked racer with the heavy metal soundtrack offers even more mayhem to the mile. If you don't care for crude, violent, and socially unacceptable games, steer clear. But if you want to switch off reality and become a homicidal maniac for a while, get in. CARMAGEDDON 2 is entirely in 3D. Not only are the cars convincingly detailed, but now the pedestrians are as well. The 2D sprites of the first game have been replaced with 3D figures of a variety of different targets: people, dogs, sheep even wildlife. As you'd expect, they can be mutilated in a multitude of ways: dismemberment, pinwheeled through the air, decapitated, or Rough Running CARMAGEDDON 2 may be only a one-joke game, but it isn't bad. It's entertaining and it delivers as promised. But there were a few annoying problems, particularly with the controls, that detracted from the game. A gamepad doesn't offer fine enough control, and it was murder on my D-pad thumb. In addition, my car spun out much too frequently—even at slower speeds—from slight steering input. Another problem I had was with the automatic panning. After you crash or spin out, the viewing perspective changes to focus on the car, not forward view. It takes a few seconds for the view to then change back toward the front. I got used to it after a while, but the delay is an awkward annoyance. Finally, the game's linear mission structure means it's easy for someone to get stuck during one of the game's timed missions. The game RACE COMPLETED FIERY FINISH Why race when it's so much more satisfying to smash everything that moves? simply turned to mush. If you back over them (not that I would do such a horrible thing), fountains of blood spurt from their broken bod. ies, accompanied by appropriately disgusting squirting noises. To justify this deviant behavior, you earn points for nailing your the course and having the fastest speed or by taking out the other five lunatics racing against you. The default Eagle 3 makes a good battering ram, but those bonus points come in handy for buying more exotic vehicles. Not all the bonus points require Hit & Run COMPUTER GAMIN WORLD *** In the game of CARMAGEDDON 2, there are drivers and there are victims.

Extra points are awarded for pile driving pedestrians at high speed, hitting two or three at once, and killing with gusto and verve. You'll need all the points you can get, because you can repair your car anytime, but it's not free. You can also upgrade your vehicle's armor, power, and offensive capability, which you'll find necessary for advancement. The game's linear mission structure requires that you complete a timed mission after each group of races to win. You can win the races by following a human sacrifice. The game pro vides ample power-ups throughout every level. In addition to offering extra points, power-ups can change the look or properties of the pedestrians, or they can affect your car in wildly unpredictable ways. The pedestrians suddenly start dancing or turn into freaks, or your car might start zapping them with bolts of electricity. Other power-ups give you jumping ability or send your car careening over the landscape in \"pinball\" mode, bouncing off the hills to the accompaniment of pinball sounds. isn't all that hard, but when someone gets stuck it lessens the chance they'll continue to play.

Larka Il the multiplayer cooperative games I've played have had one failing-a lack of communication. I've always found that getting your brilliant strategy across (or even a call for help) to your friends was a hassle and took too long-until I played FIRETEAM. FIRETEAM is an online only game that can be played with 2-12 players comprising up to three teams that compete in four different types of games. Visually, gameplay is a combination of CRUSADER and DIABLO with a hint of The Running Man thrown in for atmosphere. \"So what?\" you say. \"What makes this action game so great?\" combo; Flags is a capture the flag game where kills don't get you any points, and Basetag is an exercise in the control of territory where your must protect your base while tagging the other team's base. The game features a great number of maps that include twisting warrens, gleaming galleries, and clear corridors. No matter what your tastes, you'll find a map to your liking. Game setup is painless using FIRETEAM's lobby system. Through a series of simple windows you choose your game type, map, and number of teams and players. I was impressed by the online support. There was always at least one technical support player per lobby on-hand to answer questions and give hints to new players.

CARNIVORES is not only a hunting game for nonhunters, but it's also a pretty convincing menagerie of everybody's favorite terrible lizards. The meat-eaters are fast, brutal, and aggressive, while the veggie-eating dinosaurs are cautious and timid. Furthermore, they live in beautiful and convincing environments. The prevailing wind blows clouds across the sun and dapples the landscape in light and shadow. Animals rustle through the leaves and Pterodactyls wheel overhead in slow lazy circles.

MEGAMAN is huge in Japan, so there's plenty of weird Japanese flavor. Bosses with names like Split Mushroom, Magma Dragoon, and Frost Walrus (I swear I saw them open for Soundgarden once); weird anime cut-scenes; and badly translated text might turn some people off, but they provide the goofy atmosphere needed to appreciate this game.

"UPRISING 2: LEAD AND DESTROY  REVIEW Mech Mine DNA ACTION This Cult Favorite Follow-up Is a Feast for the Senses by Scott A. May he history of 3DO is that of a company buoyed by innovation but nearly sunk by misfires and marketing blunders. Though the tendency is to focus on mistakes, 3DO has had its moments of brilliance, such as 1997's UPRISING, one of the first games to combine real-time strategy with intense first-person action. Though the title generated plenty of critical hyperbole, it was ignored by much of the gaming public. Hey, it happens all the time. But take heart faithful followers, because redemption is at hand, in the guise of UPRISING 2: LEAD AND DESTROY, an excellent follow-up to the original UPRISING. Produced by 3DO's in-house development team, Cyclone Studios, UPRISING 2 features a greatly enhanced graphics engine, more balanced gameplay, hidden missions. The game also features a broad range of competitive or cooperative multiplayer options, including low-lag Internet play on MPlayer and HEAT.net. Gameplay involves commanding a variety of land and air forces to drive the Trich from your home turf and far beyond all the way back to the devils' homeland, if you make it that far. You do your commanding from a Wraith hovertank, researching power-ups, weapons, and vehicle upgrades as you progress. Like any level-based game, the going gets extremely tough in the later stages, though this game is nowhere near as difficult as the original. Partial credit goes to UPRISING 2's straightforward controls, revamped HUD, and recon satellite interface.

"REVIEWS Subs, Sorcerers, and Scientists Three Action Games With Nothing in Common but This Page Number ACTION just go nuts at the slightest sign of trouble. Explosions are plentiful and impressive with lots of blowapart targets, eye-popping lighting effects and associated bubbles. Yet ABYSS isn't just a blastfest. Though the game's multiple controls make for a reflex workout and a brain drain once the action heats up, a stealthy, bottom-hugging tact with engines, sonar, and headlights off is often the best approach. And that does keep things interesting. The game manual is wanting for more information and controls are a pain to custom configure yet FATAL ABYSS is solid entertainment for the aqua-warriors among us. —Gordon Goble Madison Square Garden as a gun-toting soldier, camera-carry. ing reporter, pepper gas-wielding scientist, or little baby Godzilla. Each player type has a different set of capabilities: scientists stun and incapacitate; soldiers favor guns and lethal explosives; 'zillas bite and sport deadly, fishy breath; reporters can't attack at all, but can reconnoiter while avoiding damage, allowing others to monitor their camera feed. You'll find the usual ammo and health power-ups scattered loose the castle's crystals. The good glove casts a spell that turns them into rubber balls, thus saving them from being destroyed. Unfortunately the balls are scattered in different places. As the good glove, it's your job to find and return them to the Wizard without getting nailed by the evil glove and his minions. Graphically the game is pretty, with lots of primary colors and in some places the scenery reminded me of the old Road Runner cartoons. GLOVER has a look and feel that will probably be a hit with younger gamers. Gameplay centers on your ability to handle the magic balls. Maneuvering them can be very tricky at times but gets easier the more you play. Once you get used to him, Glover generally handles fairly well...considering that he's a glove. In-game help is available from a profoundly annoying floating hat called Mr. Tip. The game is worth checking out if you're really into platform games and you want something a bit different. It doesn't take itself seriously and provides an enjoyable platform romp.

"GLOBAL DOMINATION  REVIEW Arms Race GLOBAL DOMINATION's Missile-Firing Mayhem Is Fun, if Puzzling ACTILON SOUTHERN US by Jesse Hiatt aking a game that appeals to both hardcore strategy gamers and hard-core action gamers is like recording an album for both jazz fans and heavy metal fans: Some people enjoy both, just generally not at the same time. It's a difficult mix to get right with hard-core strategists generally suffering as a game's pace speeds up and hand-eye coordination becomes a bigger factor for success. With GLOBAL DOMINATION, Psygnosis has tried to make a genre-bending game, but has fallen short. The result is little more than a mildly addictive, fairly fun arcade game. BGEBER EAT IT, HUGH JASS In this scenario I created, my missiles are pounding Canada from the United States. Blow Up Stuff GLOBAL DOMINATION IS extremely fast paced and action packed. Obviously, a serious attempt has been made to give the game a strategic component, but I would guess that few people will be able to stop mouse-clicking long enough to use any of these features. GLOBAL DOMINATION looks most like a frenzied imple mentation of Reagan-era \"Star Wars\" concepts. The game takes place on a beautiful 3D globe, which you rotate by moving the mouse. War between nations in the futuristic setting consists of shooting dozens of missiles at each other. Attack missiles move slowly and do various types of damage (depending on their type); defensive missiles move much COMPUTER important to write a clear manual or to include a good tutorial, and herein lies GLOBAL DOMINATION'S biggest problem. The manual is downright terrible, making a simple game almost impossible to learn how to play. For instance, it refers to the \"operation center\" in the manual, but in the game it's called a \"factory.\" Your superior officers suggest that you're fresh from training in the first FMV. What training? What happened to the tutorial? After the long and arduous task of figuring out how to play, I was even more enraged when I finally figured out how simple it was. A well-written manual would have helped this game immeasurably. The other aspect worth noting is that the game is extremely challenging. Even in easy mode, progress through the scenarios takes superhuman feats of skill. GLOBAL DOMINATION's saving grace is the conflict editor. Using this full-featured scenario creator you can set up any scenario you want. You can take back the western United States for Mexico, play Iraq and launch missiles at Israel and Turkey, or, if you've had a bad day, you can follow the suggestion of the game's ads and take it out on Canada. Hard-core strategy gamers are not going to like this game. Its emphasis on frenzied mouseclicking is sure to leave them cold. But if you're interested in a unique game, and are willing to learn on your own without benefit of a helpful manual or tutorials, GLOBAL DOMINATION can be an exciting action gaming experience. CGW GAMING WORLD DOLOR faster, but only damage other missiles and airborne targets. There are also offensive and defensive naval and air units, as well as powerful satellites (which show up later in the game). By pressing the space bar with the cursor over a country, you enter Tactical View. This allows you to see the various resources of a country, and if you control it, alter various settings (this is the strategy part). You can't spend very much time at all in this mode, unfortunately, because while you are in this view, the battle is still going on, and you are a sitting duck. This view is invaluable however, for targeting your attacks: If you click on a specific resource, that target will be highlighted when you return to attack mode, which makes hitting it easier. GLOBAL DOMINATION deserves recognition for being one of the few unique games to be released in a long time. The gameplay is dissimilar to everything else out there, except for MISSILE COMMAND, but even this comparison doesn't hold up past a cursory look. APPEAL: Action gamers looking for a brand-new kind of gameplay and a whoppin' challenge. PROS: Refreshingly unique; action packed. CONS: Too difficult for all but the hardcore, terrible manual; conflicts with some hardware acceleration setups. DIFFICULTY: Advanced.

To see this in action, next time you take off, leave the gear extended and keep your speed below 300 knots. Now roll into a steep turn. Notice the slow roll rate? Okay, raise the gear and now roll the airplane. This decreased roll authority also occurs when your refueling door is open. This is exactly like real life. In what is called \"cruise gains\", the FLCS either limits your Angle of Attack (AOA) or the amount of G you can pull. Below approximately 380 knots in the game, the FLCS will give you maximum AOA. Above that speed, the FLCS becomes a G limiter. In the training missions, I can only get a maximum of 7.3 Gs, not the 9 Gs of the real airplane. Speaking of G limits, in some respects the game is tougher than real life. The blackout modeling is visually similar to the real thing.

"REVIEW  FALCON 4.0 Falcon 4.0 vs. the Real Thing (continued) lower G tolerance threshold than real fighter pilots do. Fortunately, gamers don't have to tense their bodies and grunt while straining against the G forces. (My wife really appreciates this.) The avionics are complicated on the highest realism setting. Even for a former F-16 pilot, this required an investment of time to learn how to \"play the piccolo\" again. Once I learn all the weapons employment stuff, I just might start using the simplified\" setting for avionics. This setting is closer to what I used in the Block 15 model F-16A (absent any NCTR functions). The Fault Warning system is extensive; all gamers should study pages 20-6 to 20-10 in the manual. One of the few errors I've noticed is a glitch in the Selective Jettison and Emergency Jettison features. Typically we could jettison everything but ECM pods and the missiles on the wingtips. In the game, you cannot jettison anything that is on the centerline station (STA 5)-not even the fuel tank. I toured the FALCON 4.0 world using an actual map I got while stationed in Korea. I'm pleased with what I saw. The location of airfields is superb, and the inclusion of highway landing strips is a welcomed surprise. This might seem like a small detail to gamers, but it impressed me. The gameworld does have a variety of topography, but it is not as mountainous as the real ROK. Sadly, the poorly printed game map is unusable for navigation, but the game manual is superb. In all, I like FALCON 4.0. Despite the glitches, which still need to be ironed out, MicroProse has done an excellent job of capturing the experience of piloting a real F-16. CGW THE REAL DEAL Captain Robey Price, 80th Tachtical Fighter Squadron. Kunsan AFB, Republic of Korea, in 1988. Robey Price considers himself a very lucky man. He flew RF-4s and F-16s for the Air Force, and he now flies MD-80s. As he says. \"Hey, it beats working for a living.\" Avionics are finely detailed, easily on par with products like Jane's F-15. The Threat Warning System (TWS) is particularly interesting featuring a wide variety of warning tones for each type of radar. If you listen to samples of each tone in the Tactical Reference section before takeoff (focusing on the likely threats in the next mission), you may be better able to ID enemy aircraft. (However, AWACS aircraft are usually there to help you make a positive identification.) Tactical Engagement mode provides a full-blown mission editor and single-mission play. Besides the 31 training missions shipped with the product, numerous Web sites are already posting user-built missions and minicampaigns. Graphics are quite impressive, but be forewarned-maximum performance requires maximum hardware. Aging 200MHz Pentiums provide an acceptable frame rate, but only if you turn down some of the settings. If you want to crank up FALCON 4.0's graphics features, you'll want the biggest and the best hardware, such as a 400MHz+ Pentium II with at least 128Mb of RAM and a good 3D card. FALCON 4.0 is an incredibly detailed simulation that in many ways exceeds training systems in military use. How real is it? Well, this writer often consults a realworld \"Dash 1\" manual for the F-16 when playing the game. If you really want to know what it's like to fly an F-16, then don't pass up FALCON 4.0—just be sure to check for patches. CGW which are quite serious. The initial version has a tendency to crash quite regularly, although the first patch (version 1.03) seems to have helped greatly. Unfortunately, the 1.03 patch inadvertently crippled the artificial intelligence, keeping many airborne and ground units from actually fighting. Radio calls often transpose call signs, making for some confusing radio conversa tions. The computer-controlled ATC often clears two planes for landing at the same time on the same runway, and Al pilots will often run into you while taxiing. The multiplayer mode also suffers problems. Depending on your viewpoint, these problems can range from simple annoyances to intolerable breakages. Most of the problems impact campaign mode, with substantially less impact on Tactical Engagement missions. Fortunately, MicroProse says that it is fully committed to the project and hard at work, and additional patches are expected by the time this article sees print. As with FALCON 3.0 (which was released in a practically unplayable form) before it, FALCON 4.0 looks to significantly raise the bar for the entire industry... once the bugs are flushed out.

"REVIEW  LUFTWAFFE COMMANDER Messy-Schmitt Good Feel of Flying Fails to Make Up for Dull, Scripted Missions stacked up against the competition. You do get real sense of flying while in the pilot's seat. by Loyd Case nly 4 percent of Luftwaffe fighter pilots who began World War Il made it to the end of the war. The rest were either killed, incapacitated, or captured. In LUFTWAFFE COMMANDER, you get to see if you have the stuff to be one of the 4 percent that made it. Unfortunately, the sim's briefings capture the sense of desperation as the war reaches its climax far better than the flying does. This sim does break ground in some areas. As a pilot in Germany's budding new air force, you have the chance to be a volunteer in the Condor Legion, the quasi-mercenary unit that acted as Franco's air force during the Spanish Civil War. (The game shies away from controversial issues, though: you don't fly in the bombing of Guernica, for example, a notorious example of the first mass bombing of a civilian center.)

I checked my six and discovered a B-17 div. ing on me. It made a number of swooping passes. At least the gunfire came from the right locations. The game makes up for the canned nature of missions by offering a \"Knight's Cross\" difficulty level. In this level, all the flight and combat parameters are set to maximum realism. And if you die, you die. There's no reflying a mission This is probably the best way to play the game from the outsetand avoid flying single missions if you want any sense of suspense. There's also a mission generator, but it creates relatively generic missions. It does allow you to fly other aircraft, such as the P-51 and Russian 1-16. You can't save missions, however. Combat is tough, but the main source of the difficulty is the viewing system. There are number of discrete views that don't overlap. Like real life, you can't see behind you in most planes. It's tough keeping your eye on the enemy. What finally worked best for me was to have the padlock view enabled in the virtual cockpit. The problem is that if you switch from the virtual cockpit (which you might do because none of the instruments are active in the virtua l cockpit), the padlock stays in force, but it uses the discrete views. This is very distracting, and this viewing system won't win any awards for flexibility. On a more positive note, realistic gunnery mode lives up to its name—you have to get \"up close and personal\" to score a kill. There's no pinging the target bubble from 1,000 feet. Atmosphere and Combat With a 4 percent survival rate from start to finish, you'd think things would get depressing for the Luftwaffe as the war progressed. While the missions don't capture this well, the briefings do a superb job of setting atmosphere. When your CO tells you that Russian soldiers shot one of your comrades in his cockpit when he crashlanded, you suddenly feel the urge to get your plane home no matter how difficult. The voice acting is mixed, but Eagle did use real Germans (speaking in English) to give the briefings, and the content sounds authentic. Flight Limited There was a lot I liked about this game, but in the end, I find it very difficult to recommend it. The canned missions, limited mission generator, and weird Al makes this one to avoid for most virtual flyers. On the other hand, if you do get the urge to fly the He-51 over Spain or escort Ju-87's on tank busting missions in Russia, then there's nothing else like it. The flying, at least, is fun. CGW Yes, it's true, Loyd Case actually does play games on all that cool hardware he gets to test. Lately he's been pretending EUROPEAN AIR WAR is a benchmark test.

BALDUR'S GATE Is a Very Ambitious Title That Gets Most Things Right Paldvale by Scorpia certain amount of hype precedes all games, the highly anticipated BALDUR'S GATE more than most.

"PB10 ADVENTURE for instance, cannot use such spells as Sleep, Confusion, Flame Arrow and Hold Person. That leaves Xan, who cannot cast such vital spells as Magic Missile, Web, Fireball, and Lightning Bolt. It is possible to finish the game without a mage, but it certainly increases the difficulty. It could be that I missed some one with reasonable abilities, since I talked to people only when nec essary. Not only because they for ever wanted to send us on dreary little quests, but also because the dialogue is often awful, along the lines of \"Well, if you were so stupid/weak as to be captured, you're not good enough for us, so get lost.\" Diplomacy, tact, and consideration obviously took low priority in the writer's mind. When we turn to the multiplayer side, things improve. A LAN hookup affords the best experience, with everyone in the same room but on different machines. This is the closest you can get to live gaming experience, with lots of chatter and jokes in between tactical discussions. those discussions are important, and they relieve much of the burdensome parts of combat. You work out general strategies before hand, having to then worry about maneuvering only your own character, instead of six. There is also greater flexibility in responding to different threats, backing off if severely injured (NPCs have no sense of self-preservation), and moving quickly to help someone in dire circumstances. There is no question that BALDUR was designed from the first with multiplayer in mind. While solo adventuring is not exactly an afterthought, its true function seems to be for you to become familiar with the game, then export a character (of about 2nd-4th level) for the multiplayer side, so that you and your friends can indulge in a communal critter crunch. character is the \"orphan with mysterious past\" marked for death by a sinister armored figure.

Another amazing \"feature\" is the inability of the party to camp out on long journeys.

"ADVENTURE quite cerebral. There are a few jumping puzzles, but I found only one of them to be annoying. They require decent timing skills, but nothing like what's needed in a game like TOMB RAIDER. Okay, so the plot and the puzzle design are familiar, but now we get to the biggest new twist: combat (which is gory and plentiful). As in DIABLO, fighting boils down simply to a point-and-click matter, with no defensive measures (besides your armor) and some hot-keys for potions. Gamers put off by this can set the combat on \"Easy\" to make enemies pretty much roll over. Combat does have a point, though, in that it (like questing/ puzzle-solving) gives you experience. Every critter you slay ups your experience meter, and with every level-increase comes more hit points, along with higher stats in armor class, melee weapon damage, and ranged weapon damage. These stats also increase whenever you pick up new weapons or armor. Each armor change affects Connor's appearance as well. He starts with a simple tunic and ends the game decked-out in mighty Sun Armor. enough to kill me. Sometimes, the camera even refused to move, which limited my viewing angle. Another problem that will annoy users is the load times. Whenever you travel between worlds, the game will unload the current world and copy the new world from the CD onto your hard drive.

Gremlins in the Woodwork The main problem with MASK lies in its control scheme, which is a combination of keyboard and mouse control. The mouse controls the camera and interaction; the keyboard controls your movement and jumping. I was able to remap the keys so that I could get a comfortable movement interface. What I didn't like was the controllable camera. You shift the camera around by holding down the right-button and then moving the mouse. That means the game never shifts camera angles for you.

"REVIEW  RETURN TO KRONDOR ADVENTURE Return to Vendor KRONDOR Makes Its Long-Awaited Return, But It's Not a Keeper by Petra Schlunk ynamix's BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, set in fantasy author Raymond Feist's world of Midkemia, was one of the great roleplaying games of all time. The game featured a world immense in scope, rich in story, and replete with many side quests. It also left many players hungering for a sequel. Now after years and years of delays, it's finally here and it's not nearly the game that it could have been. RETURN TO KRONDOR leaves the starting gate without a hitch. The game engine differs from that of its predecessor, which is not necessarily bad, and the storyline looks fine, promising some vague continuity with BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR, have. Fortunately, party reconstruction is not as frequent or drastic as in BETRAYAL.

One convenient travel feature exists in a few areas that lets you move between locations with an overhead map. A Swing and a Hit Fortunately, RETURN TO KRONDOR comes into its own in combat. The turn-based combat system provides an agreeable tension with fate die rolls. At the beginning of every combat round, a roll is made and the result offers an advantage, such as extra attacks, to one side or another for the upcoming round (akin to a paper role-playing game's roll for initiative). Otherwise combat is similar to that in most other grid-based, tactical combat systems. Combatants can move about the battlefield to protect friends or attack specific foes, although the lack of a provision to highlight the battlefield's grid makes it difficut to plan movement and attacks. There is no fleeing from combat for either side, you cannot even reload during a battle. However, individual characters will not die as long as someone in the party survives combat. Combat spells eventually become very powerful and should be your main concern as you allo cate skill points when mages go up in levels. Sadly, spellcasters can cast spells only if they are wielding no weapon (this small fact is well hidden in the manual).

"REVIEW  QUEST FOR GLORY V: DRAGON FIRE DVENTURE Glory Be? Sierra FX Delivers a Final Farewell for the Fans—But We Still Want More Dy9 Resh by Elliott Chin or some of you, HERO'S QUEST might be nothing more than a faint, fond memory. For many others. the name rings no bells and conjures no memories at all. If you are in the latter group, then you missed out on one of the true sleepers of the past decade. HERO'S QUEST was an adventure/RPG hybrid from Sierra OnLine that came out under its QUEST lineup, which included the KING'S QUEST and SPACE QUEST series. It differed from the other two series by virtue of its role-playing system and tactical combat, while still accommodating many adventure game-style mechanics, such as puzzles and character interaction. HERO'S QUEST became QUEST FOR GLORY, and the series went onto four titles, all following the adventures of the main Greetings. Forgive fri for being so solemn after your success. character, appropriately However, I murder of Kak s turts m oll This is out the first of the Ritos, and already has died named \"Hero.\" With the conclusion of QUEST FOR GLORY IV, Sierra decided to abandon the franchise, but vehement fan protest has brought the series back for one final game. While QUEST FOR GLORY V isn't likely to win over anyone new, it will serve as a fond farewell for all those longtime fans who want to guide Hero through one last Stamwa Maniac adventure. CLASS REUNION QUEST FOR GLORY V is Hero's final adventure, and all his old The King and I friends, including the liontaur Rakeesh, are here to say farewell.

"REVIEW  QUEST FOR GLORY V: DRAGON FIRE ADVENTURE you are caught in a battle at the end of the map, you and your target are barely large enough to click on. (This is exacerbated by the Shrink spell.) The interface makes the problem even worse. There's no distinguishing between \"hot\" items and useless ones a nightmare when you're trying to find a specific item or panel (like the crane operation panel on Science Island).The cursor should light up when you pass over items you can pick up, locations of interest, or enemies and characters. QUEST FOR GLORY V. I ran into a few, and people on the forums have complained about several others. Some bugs prevent the completion of certain side quests, while others will dump you out to the desktop. The promised multiplayer support is absent, as well, although a patch is supposed to enable it in the future. I really enjoyed the first 10 hours of QUEST FOR GLORY V, but as the game wore on, became more frustrated by the pacing of the game and the pixel-hunting. A better interface, a quest log that showed you what you had to do, and better handling of combat would have alleviated some of my concerns. The ending was a letdown. A HELLUVA TRIP Although the gameworld is actually pretty small, your quests will take you to several fantastic locations, including Hades. good. You are left to think up solutions on your own, and to find your own way of arriving at those solutions. Some quests are clever, but others will leave you wandering around the game. world, lost and frustrated. The middle game, especially, feels too much like an adventure game in which you have to poke and prod at every single pixel, looking for certain items. backgrounds look nice, but others are too grainy for you to discern smaller objects on the screen (a problem when hunting for small items). The humor and style of the previous QUEST games comes through wholly intact in this final chapter. QUEST FOR GLORY has always had a juvenile sense of humor with bad jokes and sexual innuendo. It's something that longtime fans have come to expect from the series, so I didn't mind it. However, were not a fan of the series, I don't know if I would appreciate the game's humor. Some of the voice-acting was good, but other voices were strained and annoying (Cerberus is especially terrible). The music was good, with some excellent tracks and event-specific music. Two of my biggest complaints about the game are the combat and the lack of a zoom feature. If She's Funny... and Funny-looking While the plot, dialogue, and character interaction is very good, the graphics just aren't up to par. There is no 3D acceleration for Hero (who is polygonal), which makes him look blocky close-up. Some of the prerendered Real Roleplaying I do like that the game plays differently depending on which character you choose. Each class has a few extra quests and abilities, WHERE'S MY TELEPHOTO?

But in the appreciably smaller world of PC bowling sims, Adrenalin Entertainment's BRUNSWICK CIRCUIT PRO BOWLING easily stands head and shoulders above anything that's come before it.

MYTHLAND JHE Medieval Battlefield oth MYTH and MYTH II are remarkable games because, unlike almost every other real-time strategy game, they come extremely close to reproducing the actual conditions of medieval battle. Any battle, by nature, is a changing dynamic, making good use of manpower and high ground imperative. The bowmen in both titles are very close to their actual medieval equivalents. The most famous archers are longbowmen, considered to have originated in Wales. The Welsh longbow was able to punch a hole through an oak door at a relatively long range. The continental equivalent, the crossbow, was even more powerful, but slow to use and shorter ranged. The berserks are similar to the Norse berserkers. The berserkers appeared during the Viking wars of the 9th and 10th centuries and were renowned and feared for their skill in combat. They fought in a rage wearing animal skins or nothing at all, and usually used axes or swords. The speed and ferocity of the berserks in MYTH mirror the frightening savagery of their real-life inspiration. While there are no real comparisons to be made to the Dwarven units, the new Dwarven Mortars actually have a medieval counterpart, albeit tenuous, in the form of cannons that appeared in the 14th century for siege warfare. The MYTH games miss the mark with the warriors, however. Infantry of the Middle Ages used polearms and axes: The sword was extremely expensive and was generally used only by the nobility before the 15th century. One element of the authentic medieval battlefield is missing entirely, and that is the knighthood. The knighthood usually began each battle with a \"heavy shock charge,\" using lances and horses to break up enemy formations. The infantry and archers would then take care of the rest. www.computergaming.com COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. APRIL 1999 "

It's no BROOD WAR, but it's not a total waste of money either. Thierry Nguyen Profitania Deluxe The third entry in Friedrich the Great's battles features the Prussian master in two of his bad years, 1758 and 1759. To say that Friedrich came away with a draw would be kind, as these campaigns marked the beginning of the dark days of the Seven Years' War. The three battles of Paltzig, Kunersdorf, and Zorndorf show not only why Friedrich had a rough time, but also how he was able to still maintain a viable army. The game still emphasizes command morale and unit cohesion. Russian numbers and fire doctrine set it apart from the Austrian battles of earlier DRAGOON battlepacks, and even veteran Prussian grenadiers look bad going against massed cannon and steady musketry. A simple yet accurate interface helps play, although the hex-byhex movement becomes tedious when troops are not in enemy range. The Al is solid on defense, giving the Prussian player all he can handle. An odd bug for General Demicoud at Zorndorf for WIN98 is the only major flaw. I look forward to BATTLEPACK 4: LEUTHEN. Jim Cobb pack would have. With homemade maps of variable quality available to gamers free on the Internet, the big draw for a commercial release would have to be its assumed quality testing. Thankfully, Stardock Systems did a nice job designing the new maps and scenarios in RETRIBUTION. The campaign story deals with the three races vying for control of an ancient X'El Nagan artifact. Here, the designers have linked the scenarios together, so you automatically progress through them instead of having to manually load each one. The scenarios themselves vary in quality but some genuine surprises were thrown in for good measure. Take, for instance, the scenario in which the two other races periodically fight each other, leaving you to pick off the survivors; or the one in which you use civilians to activate defensive mechanisms.

Decades before The Godfather made them classy, gangster films were already packing audiences into movie houses. So why hasn't there been a successful computer game about gangsters?

It's the death-by-athan the planning and analysis and so multilayered that it takes thousand-cuts school of game design, draining the fun out of playing the game by forcing the player to perform countless boring tasks. This is not to say that the game isn't any fun at all. I have never played a game that seemed more convincingly alive than this one, and it's fun just to watch the city as the people of New Temperance go about their simulated lives. The strategist in me also enjoyed the subtle ways in which decisions you make have unanticipated consequences. But the fun is certainly diminished by the game's interface, which stands as a barrier first to learning the game and then to playing it. (There is a tutorial, but it mainly intimidates new players by drowning them in information they have no chance of retaining.) was there really no way to make the game so detailed without making the controls unmanageably complex? If so, the smart move would have been to sacrifice some of the detail. As it is, think only the hardest of hardcore gamers (and reviewers, who have no choice) will stick with this game to the bloody end. Those who do will find it rewarding, but still painful to play—and, frankly, not rewarding enough to make up for the pain.

SETTLERS III Settling for Less STRATEGYZWAR It May Take a Village, Just Not the Ones You Build in SETTLERS III by Samuel Brown Baker II ETTLERS III is a SIMCITYish look at medieval times...with an added overlay of magic courtesy of patron deities.

You can be Roman, Asian, or Egyptian, with appropriate building architecture.

Furthermore, the questions refer to Party of Five and Beanie Babies instead of their 1970s counterparts.

"STRATEGY  CHEATS WALKTHROUGHS Half-Life How to Maximize Every Advantage—the Surgical Approach by Greg Fortune tend to work my way through the various defenses of HALFLIFE by meticulously picking apart the structure of the enemy defense. This allows me to penetrate each level with a minimum of risk. If you're in the mood for John Wayne \"cavalry charge\" kind of tactics, you'll want to look elsewhere.

The first indication you get that this isn't going to be your standard firefight is when the scientist gets dragged out of the control room by one of the tentacles. Don't bother trying to shoot them, they're rather safe from your puny arsenal. Exit the control room, make your way past the barnacle and up the stairs. Waiting on the platform, a Barney says, \"Be quiet, this thing hears us!\" That's your first major clue. Remember what you learned in the training course: There is a way that you can move quietly. Also, take notice of the stash of a certain type of weapon in the next room-more, in fact, than you're able to carry at one time. Fill up. Now, move out onto the platform. There are a couple ways out of the silo, all of them blocked. You should have the method of fixing that already in your hand. I suggest opening the way before trying to sneak through. There's one handy thing to keep in mind: If you crouch while you use a ladder, you will remain stealthy and have a much better chance of making it out alive. Use your grenades to distract the tentacles as you quietly work your way down the ladders and across the platforms. Make your way through the now open doorway on the bottom level, jump across the broken walkways, and cycle the door you find in the corridor. Head down the corridor ahead until you get to the platform. I wonder what that button does? If you have any trouble with the elevator, get to a ladder before you express to the ground floor Once at the bottom, head down the hall to the small platform. Turning on the generator takes a bit of work, but you can do it if you make your way up both ladders leading to the generator and avoid getting run over by See the Review the speeding platform. Make your way FEBRUARY ISSUE. 5 STARS back to the ladder and head back up to the loading dock. Those boxes in the loading area aren't just for show, at least not if you want to avoid getting shocked by the now-electrified puddle down the corridor ahead. Head back to the silo. Follow the red and blue pipes until you get to the fuel room. You didn't actually think it would be that easy, did you? Turn around and look for a ladder leading into a dark area. Now listen carefully for a moment. Once you're ready, head down the ladder, break the grate covering the hole, and head down the second ladder. At the pipe junction, hang a left and climb up the ladder. There's a zombie at the top. You can fix that. Break out and grab some more grenades in the room around the corner. Down the hall and past the door is the biggest fan you've ever seen. Hmmm, there must be a way to turn on that fan... Now that you've found the switch, be careful. Once you turn it on, it won't take long for those blades to reach full speed, and then you'll have no chance to make it back up that ladder. So now what? You still haven't gained entry to the fuel room! I'll also guarantee that the door isn't open just because you've turned on a fan. Boy. that's one big fan though... Still stuck? Try throwing a grenade at the fan. Where'd it go? Once you've reached the air vent, work your way to the fuel room. Now turn on the oxygen and fuel. Head up the ladder, out the door, and follow the pipes back to the silo. Stock up on grenades, work your way back up to the control room, and fire the rocket. Then get away from the broken window. It gets kind of hot in there, as the tentacle will surely confirm. Now go ahead and make as much noise as you want. 218 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. APRIL 1999 "

Before you head down the elevator that lies behind the grunt position hideout above the generator room, try setting some laser trip mines in strategic places, in case any grunts come back while you're down there.

This won't be too tricky if you've got a couple of grenades, particularly the AR5 grenades you should have picked up where the last rail ended. Don't bother going for the machine-gun emplacement because the bunker that overlooks it will take you out. I like to get off the train before it reaches the gate and take up a position at the entrance to this area opposite the vacant machine gun. From here, with a couple of grenades, you can decimate the grunts hiding behind the crates on the platform.

"HALF-LIFE Gonarch's Lar Crabby Enemies GAMER'S EDGE Headcrabs I like to take these out with two shots from the Glock. Sure you can use the crowbar, but who wants to crawl around on the floor with the crabs? pon entering Gonarch's Lair, the first thing you'll want to do is get to cover around the rock to the right of where Gonarch is approaching, Gonarch has a nasty kick attack, so the best place to be is some where Gonarch can't get. Beware being too much in view of this guy, because he'll launch a toxic chemical attack at you through the air. Nail Gonarch with heavy weapons (category 4 or 5) until he runs away. I prefer to use my store of hand grenades first, as they will be much less useful later on. Try to save your rockets and AR grenades for later. Once he's gone, check behind the rock by the two pointed towers to find a healing pool. Now follow Gonarch down his hole to the second area. Make sure to grab the battery and the ammo case Barnacles Easily killed, barnacles can be taken out with any of your small arms. In fact, if the barnacle isn't hanging from too great a height, I'll save some ammo, take a barnacle ride to the top, and give it a single kiss with my crowbar. Leeches Leeches are only a minor nuisance. Use your crowbar on them and dispatch them with ease. SPIDER AND THE FLY Chase Gonarch down into its lair before cornering and killing it once and for all. lying in the tunnel before you hit section two. Houndeyes Grab your crowbar, rush in, and pummel one. When you hear the telltale whine, run out of range of the blast. Then run in and take out another one. They're easy to kill, so save your ammo. If this seems a little much for you, a couple of rounds with the Glock or a close range shotgun blast will clear out any Houndeyes you meet. Alien Grunts These hulking aliens like to use the Hornet Gun, which allows them to hit you from around corners. These guys are pretty resistant to bullets, so use energy or explosive weapons against them for best results Alien Slaves These unarmored foes will fall easily to the Glock, the shotgun, the MP5, or just about anything else you throw at them. NOWOCOOO Zombies Zombies used to be your friends, but now they've changed their minds. Any small arms will work-as will the crowbar provided that you step away from the Zombies' one-two punch. As you enter the second area, you'll notice a mesh area in the center of the open space. Therein lies your best chance for survival. Below are a healing pool and another unfortunate colleague who has been good enough to leave you some ammo. Use your long jump to leap between the two areas and watch out for headcrabs. Gonarch should give you ample opportunity to fire on him from below with your rockets. If Gonarch runs where you can't see him, use the jump pad in one of the tunnels to pop up and let Gonarch see you. He'll move so you can hit him again. Whatever you do, don't let the pad bounce you out of the cave! If you fall and take damage while inside the cave with the pad, just jump over to the pool and heal yourself. Use the hornet gun to dispatch any little hoppers that end up below with you, and keep working on him. Once you've damaged Gonarch enough, he'll again run away to a deeper part of his lair. Now you can use the pad to jump out of your hiding place and pursue Gonarch further. Jump down to the ledge with the glowing crystals, face the wall, and back down into the hole behind you. This lets you start the third stage facing Gonarch. He'll jump down into a pit, and you will be compelled to follow. Fall through the mesh and collect the batteries and ammunition below. Take cover under a ledge and begin hitting Gonarch with everything you've got. When Gonarch takes a certain amount of damage, he'll fall through the mesh and drop down with you. When that happens, you're almost there. Don't worry about the crabs jumping on you, you can take them out when your first objec. tive is complete. When Gonarch dies, he leaves a gaping hole with a teleporter at the bottom and a healing pool on one side. Now you have the time to clean up the rest of the little crabs. Then, jump down the hole to finally escape Gonarch's Lair. Bullsquid These aliens are pretty random shots, which should give you plenty of time to deal with them. Just make sure you don't get close enough for them to bite you. Ichthyosaur The great white sharks of HALF-LIFE, these are best dealt with from the shore, or from the comfort of a protective cage. Underwater, use your crossbow for maximum effect. Flyers My weapon of choice against the flyers is the Hornet Gun, due to the fact that it doesn't run out of ammo and the rounds track their target. Lead them a little and you'll get 'em every time. All other weapons work on them as well, although the crowbar isn't recommended. Human Grunts They hunt in groups, tend to wait in strategic spots, use cover, and keep moving, so plan your attack.

"ED WWII Air Combat Primer Strategy and Tactics for WWII Rookie Pilots by Jeff Lackey hese are good times for the PC pilot with a yearning to fly the not-sofriendly skies of WWII Europe, due to sims like MicroProse's EUROPEAN AIR WAR, WWII FIGHTERS from EA/ Jane's, and Microsoft's COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR. However, if you're a novice to flight sims in general or perhaps a jet jock who hasn't recently flown a prop job, you may need a few pointers to help you get the most out of your new program.

"1999 \"Just keep pressing the (trigger) until you think you're going to collide...\" -Pete Townsend, RAF No. 85 Squadron, 9 victories No matter how skillful your flying, the bottom line is shooting down the enemy. These planes don't have long-range missiles that you can lock on, fire, and forget: They've got guns. When you're lining up your target, remember that you have to aim not where the enemy is, but where he's going to be when the bullets finally get there. The closer you are, the less lead you have to pull and thus the better your odds are of getting a kill Tommy McGuire, a USAAF ace with 38 victories, advised \"Go in close, and then when you think you're too close, go in closer.\" Erich Hartmann stated, \"Only when the windshield is filled up, then pull the trigger.\" If you're frustrated by an empty gun and an adversary who's flying away untouched, make it a point to get closer than you think is necessary before you pull the trigger. MERSEDIG DOWN ON THE DECK Twisting dogfights that stick close to the ground typically favor the better turning fighters over \"boom-and-zoom\" aircraft. \"I never cared much for the dogfight...90 percent of my attacks were surprise attacks.\" -Erich Hartmann, JG 52, 352 victories asic fighter maneuvers (BFM) are described in the various as he fell back. Interestingly enough, he was flying a Bf-109, a craft that sims' manuals and are beyond the space allotted here would be considered a \"Boom and Zoom\" fighter, and his enemy was fly(read Robert Shaw's Fighter Combat for everything you'll ing a \"turning\" fighter, a Spitfire. ever need to know about BFM), but as you study these, This illustrates a very important point: Effective energy management is understand that your goal is not to fly fancier aerobatics more important than the comparative specifications of individual aircraft. than your adversary-it's to shoot him down.

"WWII AIR COMBAT PRIMER \"...the curve into 70 (B-17) Fortresses lets all the sins of one's life pass before one's eyes.\" GAMERS EDGE -Hans Phillip, JG 1,206 victories famous cry of bomber crews as they sighted bandits at \"12 o'clock high!\" What if the bombers are escorted by fighters? If your sim supports wingman commands, send some of your squadron off to keep the escort busy. If this isn't an option, your best bet is to simply watch your rear and press on attacking the bombers. Remember your goal isn't to shoot down fighters, but rather to prevent the bombers from delivering their load. Also, shooting the bombers down after they've dropped their bombs is much less desirable than preventing them from destroying their target. If you can do enough damage to cause them to abort their mission and turn for home, then your job is done. If your role is to protect a flight of bombers, remember that your task is not TARGET FIXATION This Fw-190 was so focused on attacking the bomber that he forgot to shooting down enemy fighters! The most check his six, with predictable results. common mistake for a beginner on escort missions is to leave his charge to chase a ou've been scrambled to intercept an incoming B-17 fighter, only to find that the bomber formation is miles away, being picked bomber raid.

The next thing you always stay close to the formation you are protecting. know your plane is shredded by an angry fusillade of.50 caliber bullets pouring out of every Fortress in sight. As you parachute down you mumble, \"There must be a better way...\" This crippled bomber has fallen away from the pack, making him easy pickings. Don't feel stupid: The German fighters quickly learned the power of massed bombers. Latter variants of the B-17 carried 10.50 caliber machine guns; multiply this by 10 or more bombers in formation, focusing all of their firepower on an interceptor, and you quickly realize the challenge of knocking these behemoths out of the sky. Adolph Galland's famous JG 26 developed a tactic worth trying: Fly parallel (but out of gun range) to the bomber group, to establish their course. Then fly ahead and turn into them for a slightly high, diving, head-on attack. The combined closing speeds results in a minimum time for the bombers to fire at you. Fill your sights with the front of the bomber, fire, then zoom safely below the formation. Extend out of range, climb, turn and repeat. You probably won't immediately destroy the bombers-rarely were bombers shot down on the initial pass. Instead, you'll create cripples that will fall behind the pack, where they can be picked off, safe from ped the deadly combined formation fire. This was a SINUBA common tactic for the Luftwaffe, leading to the Alone Again, Naturally 224 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. APRIL 1999 "

TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS When escorting a bomber group, you must stay near the formation, resisting the temptation to chase enemy fighters. Reliving History While the game manuals provide some information on basic fighter maneuvering, plane specifications, and historical background, there are a huge number of books of interest to the WWII sim pilot. Not only will they provide ideas on tactics, but reading firsthand accounts of the pilots who flew and fought in World War II will also give you a better historical perspective and a richer flying experience.

"Baldur's Gate Getting That Party Underway GAMER by Scorpia ost of these tips apply more to solitaire play of BALDUR'S GATE than multiplay. How -ever, the suggestions on character creation can be of value regardless of how you play the game. Unless noted otherwise, \"thief\" includes bard, \"fighter\" includes paladin and ranger, and \"cleric\" includes Druid. the strength up to 17 or 18 for maximum benefit. Wisdom is important, primarily for clerics, and should be 18 for that class. In particular, it allows the cleric to memorize extra spells of each level, and we can all use the extra healing. Likewise, mages should come with 18 intelligence. Charisma is not as important in the game as reputation, so you can get by easily with only an average (10+) score in this stat. Have Some Class I don't recommend multiclassing in the solo version, there are far too many drawbacks involved. Advancement is slower, and the restrictions on armor and weapons make the character less efficient in either class. This is especially true when combining fighter with mage. You can't cast spells in armor of any kind, and a fighter without armor is a dead duck. Unless you plan on hanging out in the back ranks with no armor and a bow, this is a combination to avoid. Fighter with cleric is somewhat better, since you can wear the good armor, and still cast spells. Unfortunately, weapons are limited in this case to only what a cleric can wield, and that leaves out bows of all kinds. So this character can fight a little better than a regular cleric, but that's about all. In the same way, dual classing for human characters should be avoided. There is an overall experience cap of 89,000 in the game (as noted when you go to the dual class screen). That means you must switch classes fairly early on, thereby limiting your abilities in the original class, and even when the new class exceeds the old, you're stuck with the same drawbacks a multiclass character has. Definitely not a good thing. Generally, you are best off with a single-class character, although you can also try multiclassing later on when you're familiar with the Character Development Given that BALDUR'S experience cap keeps you from advanc. ing very far, you'll want to have the best possible character right off the bat. Single-classes will peak at level 7 (8 for thieves). multiclasses peak at either 6/6 or 6/7, depending on the mix. Everyone should have dexterity of 18, if possible. This is an immediate four-point improvement in armor class, and is especially valuable for characters limited to little or no armor, such as thieves and mages. Anything that makes you harder to hit is worth having. For any character with thieving abilities, 18 is again the dexterity to shoot for. For nonfighters, a constitution of 16 is sufficient; higher doesn't do much for you. Fighters should aim for a constitution of 17 or 18, to gain the extra hit-point bonus per level. The front lines can be pretty rugged in this game. As regards strength, fighters should have at least 18/51 or better, both for the plus to hit and the extra damage. A high strength (14 or more) is also handy for clerics, since they like fighters, can wear the heavy armor, such as plate mail. If you plan on having your cleric fight often, bring See the Review THIS ISSUE. 4 STARS game, and have a good idea of who will be in the party overtime. Regarding weapon proficiencies, fighters get a star every three levels; thieves and clerics every four levels, and mages every six levels. This includes multiclass, who get a star at the appropriate level for whichever class gives the most beneficial results; e.g., a fighter/ something combo gets a star every three levels, while a cleric/mage gets one every fourth level. Keep in mind that fighters combined with another class cannot go beyond two stars in any weapon type. Fighters do well by starting with two stars in Large Sword, one in Bow, and the fourth into whatever else you please. At levels 3 and 6, put the stars into Large Sword. The better weapons are always swords, so make the most of that by advancing in this specialty. Thieves should choose Small Sword and Bow. Since armor for this class is limited, it's better to stay back and use arrows whenever possible. Clerics take Missile Weapons and either Blunt or Spiked Weapons. Druids should take Missile Weapons and Small Sword. Taking Small Sword will allow the Druid to use that very nice Dagger of Venom for sale in Beregost (once you can afford it). Blunt weapons will limit the Druid to only Club or Quarterstaff, neither an especially great weapon. Mages should take missile weapons. This allows for using darts and slings, thus keeping the mage in the back, where such characters belong. \"Back\" is, however, a relative term. Monsters can attack from any angle; don't expect them to always be coming from the front. That's another reason everyone (not just your personal character!) should have the best armor possible. Non-magical weapons in this game, especially swords, break coran Luck be a lady. Jaboda Nature's servant wat KOODPI292670000 POINTED STAR It's just as important to have proper \"marching order\" in outdoor combat situations as it is inside dungeons or castles. Note how our magic user in the back rank is sufficiently shielded by the fighters up front, so that he has plenty of time to cast his spell.

"Who's in the Party? fairly often; all fighter types should carry at least two weapons on their belts at all times. Once a character acquires a magical weapon (+1 or better), you won't have to worry about that anymore. Until then, be prepared with backups. GAMER'S shouldn't be in a hurry to follow up on the story. For one thing, you probably won't be powerful enough to handle the opposition if you go too fast. So, take your time and explore the side areas. These start showing up on your world map when you exit a location to the east or West (sometimes north Imoen, your childhood pal, is with you almost from the start, and provides thief abilities. Bring up her skills in Lockpicking and Find Traps as she advances in level. Imoen A Side-questing We Will Go? Once you have a full party of six, be careful of which quests you accept (it's wise to save Jaheira and Khalid, at the Friendly Arms Inn, are also good to have for the long term. At the carnival east of Nashkell, you can buy a stone-to-flesh scroll for 500 gold and de petrify Branwen the cleric, Daheira another good addition to the Khalid party. Note that clerics and Druids have slightly different spells, so one of each in the group is a good thing. If your character is not a mage, you may want to pick up the spellcaster you rescue at the end of the Nashkell mines. Otherwise, it may be a very longtime before you find someone else who is a mage to join your group. Even if you are a mage yourself, having a second spellcaster won't hurt. Maqe Fairly late in the game, in the Cloakwood Forest, you'll meet Coran, a fighter/thief. He is the supreme Archer, and also excellent at Lockpicking. If you have a spot open, he's well worth taking on. PYROMANIA Fireball is a great attack spell, but its radius of effect is rather large. Take care you don't cast it too close to friends. Coran types of combat the general outdoor encounter and the set-piece. In general encounters, fighting begins when something hostile targets a party member. This is always mentioned in the text, so hit pause as soon as such messages appear. Scroll the map to see where the monsters are coming from, and how many there are. You may need to move some people around to get them out of before talking to people in this game!). Sometimes, the person with a job to be done wants to join the group, and then you must drop one of your own regulars to make room for him or her. Jaheira and Khalid are a pair, and dropping one means dropping both. Branwen doesn't take kindly to being \"cast off,\" either. The Nashkell mines mage is usually the best bet for temporary dropoff, but you'll be out his spellcasting ability for the duration. Then again, these \"joiner\" quests are not a part of the main storyline, so declining them won't prevent you from moving on with the game. There is plenty to do in the game, and going out on every little quest is not necessary. Speaking of which, the main line primarily follows the mines/bandits until you get into Baldur's Gate. Most everything else is extra, designed for experience and finding the occasional neat item or two. There is no rush here, and you or south, also, dependi ng where you are). You don't usually need anyone to tell you about them; most will just be there when you leave an area. Some people will ask you to find their missing/stolen items, such as the Boots of Stealth or the Belt of Piercing. By all means. find these things just don't return them. You need this stuff far more than they do, and the rewards for bringing them back are paltry at best. Remember, you're saving the world, and they're just sitting around doing nothing important.

"BALDURS GATE GAMER'S EDGE t's an than one enemy, usually a spellcaster or two, as well as tough fighters. You'll live longer if you take them out one at a time. The \"tiptoe\" technique is good for this. Basically, you just move very slowly so as the darkness rolls back on the map, only one enemy is revealed, then stop. If it's an ordinary fighter, let him come to you. If it's a mage, use missile weapons and spells as necessary. The important thing here is not to move farther along, uncovering more opponents before you're ready. One spellcaster and a couple of friends (sometimes, even just one magic-user) can easily trash your whole group. Keep an eye on the righthand portraits during combat. Your party members have no sense of self-preservation, and will fight to the death if you let them. Anyone severely injured should be moved away from the fighting and given some healing if you can manage it. While dead companions can be resurrected later, they drop everything they're carrying, which can make for problems. Also, anyone who dies from poison or fire is gone for good, and can't be raised from the dead; their portraits disappear from the list. Ouch! Finally, save often. You never know what may turn up in the next few steps. Bounty hunters after your scalp can show up anywhere, not just in town. A group of unusually powerful monsters may be sitting around in an area populated by weak ones. Anything can happen out there, much of it nasty. Walk with care and be prepared at all times. CGW HEROES CAST IN STONE In all D&D gamesBALDUR'S GATE is no exception statues are more than they seem, and it might be a good idea to cast Dispel Magic here.

Against just a couple of opponents, setting the whole party against one at a time can kill them off quickly. Against multiple monsters, advance the fighters to head the critters off and keep them occupied while other party members use missile weapons or spells. I usually have an auto-pause set for \"target gone,\" which is especially helpful during large fights. Normally, the NPC members (any character other than your own) automatically choose another target when their current one is gone, and you can just leave them to it. However, there are times when you may want to redirect attacks to a specific opponent, and auto-pause lets you do that with out having to hit the space bar all the time. The set piece is where you have one or more opponents waiting especially for you, and one of them has something to say before fighting starts. You can't sneak up on them, although if you're fast enough, you can hit pause and direct your spellcasters to start some magic going. After conversa tion ends, your people will continue with their spells. This is another good place to pause, so you can direct physical attacks against specific opponents. Spellcasters are the toughest opponents. Mage types invariably cast either Mirror Image or Invisibility before you can stop them. Physical attacks will eventually destroy the images (you have to get all of those before you can hit the mage). You can also try area effect spells, such as Fireball, or Dispel Magic to remove the images. Command may also work in this situation. Against invisible enemies, Purge Invisibility is the spell of choice. Silence, with its 15-foot effect radius, can prevent opponents from doing nasty things to your party. Web is another good spell, though it takes a little practice to use properly; webbed opponents of all kinds are helpless while trapped (this is much better than entangle, which only stops movement, not spells or physical attacks). Hold Person can also be effective against difficult opponents. Your people who are held, confused, charmed, and the like, can often be brought back to normal with Dispel Magic or Remove Paralysis. Be sure to have a few of those spells always memorized. Charm is especially nasty, as the victim will immediately start attacking someone in the party, and the party members will attack him or her in return. So, undo that effect as soon as possible, then pause the game and redirect everyone's attacks to the proper opponents; sometimes, it takes a while for the group to realize the person has been restored.

"HALL OF FAME WELCOME TO THE COOPERSTOWN OF COMPUTER GAMES. These are the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. Alone in the Dark (1-Motion, 1992) Hall of Fame-New Inductees The Bard's Tale (EA, 1985) Battle Chess (Interplay, 1988) e Betrayal at Krondor (Dynamix, 1993) Chessmaster (Software Toolworks, 1986) Tetris (Spectrum Holobyte, 1988) If there ever really was a communist plot to destroy American productivity, it was METRO the Soviet-developed Tetris. It was a simple little game in which you tried to line blocks up into rows as they ceaselessly fell from the sky. Success was rewarded only by the occasional change of a crudely drawn Russian-themed background and the ever-quickening pace of falling blocks. It was such a simple game with few rewards, yet somehow we never stopped playing it. The EGA version still sits on a number of hard drives in our offices. We bought Gameboys to play TETRIS on plane flights. We installed TETRIS on our laptops. We kept ancient Atari ST's running long past their prime as dedicated Tetris workstations. We revel in the fact that we look like we're working when we play Tetris on our PalmPilots in really boring meetings. The blocks keep coming, and someone has to put them in their places. We can't walk away. So TETRIS has been belatedly inducted into the Hall of Fame. Maybe, finally, those dreams we've all had of falling blocks from the sky will at last stop. Or at least they'll move on to the next level. Command & Conquer (Virgin/Westwood 1995) Day of the Tentacle (LucasArts, 1993) DOOM (id Software, 1993) Dungeon Master (FTL Software, 1987) Earl Weaver Baseball (EA, 1986) Empire (Interstel, 1978) F-19 Stealth Fighter (MicroProse, 1988) Falcon 3.0 (Spectrum HoloByte, 1991) Front Page Sports Football Pro (Dynamix, 1993) Quake (id Software, 1996) After QUAKE's revolutionary mouselook concept, first-person shooters would never be the same. Suddenly, the enemy could rain destruction down (or up) on you from any direction. This left gamers not only jumping out of their chairs as they played the game, but also had them creeping around corners in the real world long after their PCs had been shut down. The dreaded hiss of a Scrag had you instantly searching the skies in a desperate attempt to kill before being killed, and Shamblers made us quiver with fear. Still, QUAKE owes its status at the definitive action-game benchmark to its incredible DeathMatch play, which at the time offered the ultimate outlet for office-wide (and Internet-wide) aggression. We can think of few joys in life more satisfying than brutally turning fellow CGW Editor Dave Salvator into a pile of bloody chunks and reveling in his tortured cries of \"Nooooooooollllll\" and \"Camping Ho!\" QUAKE immersed us in fantastic killing fields like no game before it, and it still holds up after all these years.

"Planet of the Geeks Or, Yo, Pencil Neck—This Is Our World Now! i, my name is Jeff, and I am a geek. Chances are high that you too, now holding this magazine, are also a geek. Call it a hunch. Just to be sure, though, so I'm certain we're speaking the same language, please take a moment to answer True or False to the following statements: Chez Greenspeak, as long as you observe the rules: No speaking in Klingon, no yammering on about the new Star Wars movie, no loud public recitations of Monty Python routines. Also, I'll have to ask you to keep away from my daughter. II So now that we know where we stand, I would like to address gamers!\" And we wish to drive them away, to send them back to their world of Range Rovers and outdoor barbecues and Yanni CDs. But I wish to say, friends, that this is wrong. Just as Zera must kiss Taylor at the end of Planet of the Apes, we must embrace these people, as unpleasant as it might be. Why? Because we won. Because they are living in our world now. Because, in just two short decades, The Geek has been radically transformed from picked-upon social reject to admired prince of the new world order. And with such power comes responsibility. But it's all changed now. Suddenly, there are rock bands with Web sites and TV commercials for Pentium Il chips and junior high kids with home networks. We won, you see? And the more people converted to the cause, the more power we have. The more people play computer games, the more the world works the way we want it to. It's easy to laugh at people who play games we think are \"beneath\" us or scoff at those who don't have the same oh-soimportant gaming knowledge. But once we start playing with the politics of exclusion, well, then we're just as bad as the lummoxes who broke our glasses. Any game that gets someone behind a computer-thinking, analyzing—is a good thing. IN As someone who grew up in the fetid cultural dungheap of JEFF GREEN 1. I think that anyone who says that Kirk/Picard (take your pick) was the better Enterprise captain is an ill-informed moron and poseur with no understanding whatsoever of the qualities necessary to be a leader in interplanetary space travel and conflict management. 2. I know how to use the phrase \"RAM cache\" in a sentence. 3. I am afraid to read my comic books out of fear that I'll bend the pages and lower their value. 4. The toughest and most important decision I've made so far this year was deciding whether to be a halfling or halfelf in BALDUR'S GATE. 5. I have named one of my pets, children, or body parts \"Frodo.\" I have named one of my pets, children, or body parts «Frodo.\" the gallery. I would like to say the San Fernando Valley in the that of late, as I have wandered 1970s, I'm here to testify: The this great land of ours, I have Geek has not always had it so heard lots of grumbling and good. It was not hip to be naysaying from my fellow gam square-it was an invitation to ing geeks. And I must say, an ass-kicking. Studied sullenness friends, that it disturbs me. What was the order of the day. Brains I have heard is resistance, resent were not valued. The coolest guys ment, and repulsion toward the in the school were those glassyhordes of unwashed \"normal\" eyed mouth-breathers who people now flooding the gates of majored in wood shop and our Fortress of Dorkitude. played air guitar to \"Cat Scratch We see them buying copies of Fever.\" Displaying even the RIVEN and DEER HUNTER, and we slightest interest in something do not like what we see. We say like a computer was tantamount to one another: \"That is not a to showing up at school in \"T real game! These are not real Love Mommy\" underwear. So lighten up, Poindexter. Geeks have never had it so good. Let the Wal Mart crowd play their hunting games, and stop being a snob about it. With some encouragement from us, they'll come around to STARCRAFT, HALF-LIFE, and ALPHA CENTAURI. And when they do—then we kick their bumpkin asses. CGW I'd say answering True to any one of these puts you squarely on Team Geek. But don't worry. I'm not putting you through this process to make fun of you. On the contrary. Other people may laugh at you or kick sand in your face, but not me. You're always welcome here at What Jeff doesn't realize is that neither Kirk nor Picard could have handled Seven of Nine without ending up in a sexual harassment court-martial.
