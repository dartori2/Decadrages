"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD finger and cartographic sense. Even a weak horror game will generally immerse the player in its world—will make the player feel something about the events he participates in more than a comparably weak game in another genre. And a strong one can grab hold of a gamer and cling like a pitbull, creating an incomparably intense gaming experience. Before a game can do that, though, it has to have a good story. And for the last few years, storytelling in computer games has increasingly taken a back seat to gee-whiz technology. Games have come out by the cartload that look snazzy but make no sense, have slush pile-quality stories, and generally evoke little more from a gamer after the initial gut-level \"Wow!\" than a hearty, mouth-level yawn. It should be obvious to everyone in the industry that this can't go on forever. A person will only buy so many $59 disappointments before he throws up his hands in disgust. Publishers have to start offering gamers more than they have been, and not just more visual effects. It's time for the storytelling to catch up to the set design. As for gamers, horror offers them a taste of what the experience of playing a game can be like when you are wrapped up in an engrossing fiction rather than skimming the surface of an abstract or mechanical one. None of which the average gamer will think about when he or she sticks disk one of PHANTASMAGORIA into a CD-ROM drive, but no matter. Gamers will appreciate it when they experience it. And the publisher who offers that experience to him will discover what Stephen King knows but the rest of the publishing industry seems to have forgotten: that there's no quicker or easier way to pack the seats than with a good scare.

As amazing as this high-res, 256-color demonstration was, Rendition's Jay Eisenlohr explained that the final art will be 16-bit (65,000 colors), to allow bi-linear filtering of the texture maps (a process in which texture maps are smoothed to eliminate the blocky, pixelated look they have when close up). Rendition seems determined to work with top notch game companies, with a lineup of ported software from id Software (QUAKE), Papyrus (NASCAR), Looking Glass (FLIGHT UNLIMITED), Domark (Simis Software's TERRACIDE), and Microsoft. It is important to point out that the Verite will require a special version of the given game for the gamer to realize any benefits. Additionally, the Verite is expected to accelerate such Microsoft Game SDK APIs as DIRECT DRAW and DIRECT 3-D. According to sources at Rendition, Veritè-based products will also function as fast, 2-D Windows accelerators with respectable DOS VGA performance.

Not only does Stauf torment you with 13 logic puzzles and six Al games, but you're also sent on scavenger hunts, guided only by a mysterious hint as to which of the 250 selectable objects scattered about the mansion you're looking for. The puzzles and Al games here present a much higher level of challenge than the ones in 7TH Guest. As before, you're presented with a series of video vignettes as you solve each puzzle, which clue you into the mystery at hand. This time, however, the sequences are periodically tied together and shown as a whole. There's nearly three times as much video here as in 7TH GUEST, beautifully displayed in true-color SVGA at 30 frames per second. The hint book in the library has been replaced with a small pocket computer called the GameBook, so you no longer have to trek back to the library every time you get stuck. There is still quite a bit of wandering around as you seek treasure hunt A GOOD KNIGHT FOR good thing. It's often difficult to figure out what to HORROR do next, and there's a certain \"wandering around, Sierra On-Line's GABRIEL KNIGHT: SINS OF THE FAasking pointless questions\" aspect of GABRIEL THERS is, in my opinion, the best horror game ever KNIGHT which turns some people off. And there's almade. Extremely well-written, both as a game and ways that old bugaboo about mood and frustraas a work of fiction, GABRIEL KNIGHT is a solid offering. Its graphics are good, its sound and music are better than average, and—wonder of wonders!-its horror is brilliantly effective. Jane Jensen, the writer and designer of the game, is without doubt the most important factor in GABRIEL KNIGHT'S SUCcess. The dialog she has written is of literary quality. The plot is dynamite. It's SIX FEET OVER This above-ground cemetery in New elegantly paced and complex, unfolding Orleans is one place you'll have to hunt for clues in with into a crescendo of passion, dread GABRIEL KNIGHT: SINS OF THE FATHER. and grief.

Jensen's The action takes place over ten days and work here has set the high watermark for horror ranges over half the globe. Although most of the games to date. game is set in New Orleans, entire days are spent in Germany and Africa. Accordingly, the game FUTURE FRIGHTS gets additional points for the care and attention That brings us to the present and one final given to setting. There are a variety of locations in question: is there a title out there that embodies the French Quarter of New Orleans, all of which all of the aspects of a horror game? A culmination are interesting to explore, as well as a beautifully of the form?

There will never be a final word on the subject, There are numerous characters to talk to and of course there's always room for improvement, important conversations to be had with all of no matter what you do. But Sierra has certainly them. In fact, the conversations are the heart of put together many elements of the most successthe game. Sierra employed a cast of talented voice ful horror titles with their new release, Roberta actors, including Tim Curry in the title role, Michael Williams' PHANTASMAGORIA, reviewed elsewhere in Dorn as a powerful voodoo bocor, and the ubiquithis section.

A great variety of surgeries, tortures and mutilations were performed, by villains ranging from gypsies to insane old women to men with flesh-ripping hooks instead of hands, and every act, no matter how outrageous, was accomplished with the greatest realism, using theatrical props and effects specially developed for the Guignol.

He called his show the Phantasmagoria, and in it he simulated various acts of torture and murder, in a display designed to both titillate and terrify his audience. Now, over 100 years later, a young professional couple has bought the magician's estate-a beautiful mansion and grounds, all built in an isolated coastal region of New England—for a song. This is a cliché so familiar that it needs no explanation: Cool old house at low price equals big trouble. If you tried to use this premise in a movie nowadays, they'd string you up and gouge your eyes out Strangely enough, it still works here; a computer game is different from a film. A certain alchemical transformation takes place when a member of the audience becomes a player; the transition from passive to active role is a kind of philosopher's stone, magically making old cliché's new again.

"stant the machine is turned off, either. I'm not what anyone would call the nervous or squeamish type, but I had a strong physical reaction to this game. After a long session, the weight in the pit of my stomach took hours to dissipate. For a horror fan, that feeling is a good thing. It's a sensation always desired, but very seldom achieved, when you sit down to watch a fright flick or read a gory novel. It means that you are in the presence of greatness, that you have experienced a work of art. It's akin to one's reaction to a symphony, a powerful line of verse, or an extraordinary painting-a potent experience, one which cannot easily be put into words. PHANTASMAGORIA is excellent.

Very definitely, yes. Though PHANTASMAGORIA has a \"censorship\" option, which cuts down on the graphic physical violence by pixelating the worst of the scenes, parents and potential players should not be lulled into complacency. There is no way to reduce the emotional and supernatural impact of this game. Anyone who dislikes this variety of intense horror will not enjoy the experience, and it should be kept away from children and young adults at all costs. I wouldn't let anyone under the age of 16 open the box, much less play it. Other than that, I would say that PHANTASMAGORIA has a great deal to offer. It's a beautiful program, well worth playing for its look and feel alone. Although it's a bit short, yielding only 20 to 30 hours of play for an average gamer, it can provide richly textured entertainment even to those who can't really appreciate its value as horror. For horror fans, PHANTASMAGORIA is a signal event, one of the most powerful titles ever released in the genre, and easily the most singlemindedly horrific. Like The Theatre du Grand Guignol, it is neither refined nor original-only moving. But blood and thunder has its own appeal. THE EDITORS SPEAK PHANTASMAGORIA RATING** PROS High production values, good acting, writing and direction; effective horror sequences.

SCSI is better at multitasking than but the IDE standard still limited the drives to a IDE, which yields better performance than IDE in half-gigabyte. an environment like Win 95.

In a standard SCSI rig, up to 7 There aren't any fibre channel interfaces for PCs devices can be attached, including hard disks, yet, but by next year, this will change. we got the following message during the WING COMMANDER 3 installation: \"Your CDROM drive is reading CDs faster than is possible!\" Normally, this message appears if a disk cache is loaded, but clearly the designers at Origin didn't anticipate 8-speed CD drives (and to think WC3 shipped less than a year ago). The WING COMMANDER 3 installation routine reported a transfer rate of 1,236,219 bytes per second, just as you'd expect from an 8x drive (or perhaps \"double quad\" drive). WC3 loads in 12 seconds, tying the Plextor 6Plex (see below). There may be a couple of reasons for the identical scores of the Plextor 6x and the Diamond 8x. First, we may be running into overhead limitations; i.e., WING COMMANDER 3 itself has to do some work as it's loading into memory. We may also be seeing the limitations of the IDE interface vs. the SCSI interface of the Plextor drive. MPC WIZARD 3 reported only a 521 KB per second transfer rate at 60 percent CPU utilization, but we may be running up against the limits of the benchmark. The average access time is 221 milliseconds. Do you need an 8x drive? As more titles actually have software load off the CD, this can be beneficial. However, titles optimized for quad-speed drives are only now beginning to hit the shelves, so an 8x drive is really a future investment, but it's probably a good one. Price: $649.

"Yamaha sounds best, whether you play here... or here. On stage or on CD, Yamaha instruments set the standard for the best sound quality. Now the Yamaha WaveForce DB50XG puts all that sound on a daughter board that snaps right on to your existing WaveBlaster connector-equipped soundcard. It doesn't require any new software or messing with switches. The DB50XG instantly and dramatically improves the sound of your games, music and multimedia presentations. The DB50XC uses exclusive Yamaha Advanced Wave Memory (AWM\"*) technology so you're hearing actual sounds digitally stored onto 4MB of wave-ROM (that's four times the amount most other cards use). More wave-ROM means more variety and better sound quality. And these sounds are identical to the ones Yamaha puls in our highly acclaimed professional keyboards; the best sounds in the industry. It's not just the sounds, but the superior control of them that sets the DB50XG apart. The new XG format takes control far beyond General MIDI (GM). And with major game developers implementing XG, you won't want to be stuck with a card that doesn't keep up with the times. The DB50XC will play all of your favorite GM compatible software. And with its superior sounds, it will play them better than you've ever heard before. It's amazing what a simple upgrade can do. The Yamaha Waveforce DB50XG sounds so good, you'll YAMAHA need to check your CD-ROM drive to make sure you're not playing an audio CD.

"Glossary ADAPTEC 1542CP PLUG-AND-PLAY SCSI CARD SCSI Mast SCSI Master adapted If you're in the market for a new hard disk, and you've got the system to support it, take a look at your needs. Today, EIDE drives are very cost effective, although it's worth checking out SCSI solutions if you're piecing together a new Pentium rig. Whether EIDE or SCSI will win in the market in the long run is subject to debate, but we'd like to point out that Western Digital, one of the strongest proponents of IDE, has recently shipped a line of low-cost SCSI controllers. Whether you're looking for SCSI or IDE drives, here are a few things to look for: Access Time: average access time is a measure of how fast the magnetic head that reads data of the disk moves to different parts of the disk. Today's slowest drives have access times of 14 milliseconds, which would have been considered incredible a couple of years ago. Transfer Rate: measures how fast stuff can be moved off the hard disk and into your computer's memory. The current hot standard in IDE is called mode 4 PIO (PIO stands for programmed input/output). Mode 4 allows transfers of over 13 megabytes per second between the hard disk and computer memory. All the newest Pentium systems support mode 4. Rotational Speed: how fast the disk spins. We mentioned transfer rate; transfer rate is kind of a fiction, because most hard disks can't really transfer data that fast, except in very short bursts. It's a law of physics. The actual, sustained rate that a disk can deliver data is dependent on two factors: how fast the disk spins, and how much data is packed into a given space on a disk. The fastest IDE drives spin at 5400 RPM; the bleeding edge of SCSI drives spin at 7200 RPM. Number of Platters: the number of disk platters, all other things being equal, has an effect. The fewer the platters, the faster the drive. This is because the density of the information on the disk is very high. Remember that the disk is spinning at a fixed rate, so the more bits per millimeter, the faster the data rate. Buffer Size: in general, the bigger the buffer, the better. Most IDE drives have buffers of 64 or 128 KB; a few have 512 KB. Some of the 7200 RPM SCSI drives have a megabyte of cache on board. There are other, even more arcane, parameters for disk performance, but these are probably the most important ones. to attach a normal SCSI device, you need ADAPTEC 1542CP PLUG-AND-PLAY a special adapter, since the SCSI CARD 2940W/3940W use high density, 68 pin connectors.

"He Dimension IOMEGA ZIP DRIVE tridges are only $20, it's not a bad way to add hard drive space. Unlike the ZIP DRIVE, you can boot from the EZ135. If you want to have unlimited hard drive space in 135 megabyte chunks, then the EZ135 is a nice solution for adding more disk space, but it's not as good as the Zip drive as a portable data transfer solution. On top of that, it just doesn't feel as, well, cool. Price: Internal IDE, $199.95; external SCSI, $239.95. Call (800) 245-2278 for more information. Web: N/A that offer higher performance and more space and a price per megabyte that was unthinkable only a year ago. We've also taken a look at some creative, weird and cute solutions to the need for more space, not to mention better CD-ROM drives. Despite all this innovation, there's even cooler, new solutions waiting in the wings. Like all technologies, the pace of change is staggering The key is to evaluate your needs with an eye towards the future. It's probably better to spring for a slightly bigger, slightly faster drive now, so a future upgrade can be delayed a bit more. Hard disks and CD-ROM drives have finally reached performance points that will be good enough for the next year or two, anyway. At least, you won't have to upgrade until ACROSS THE RHINE II ships.

Brooks: One of the firm beliefs I have about being a writer is that when I tell a story, it shouldn't tell just one thing. It should have multiple observations that can be pulled out of it. Over and above the storyline itself, I try not to give anything away. I hate books that preach at you. CGW: In the preface to the latest version of The Sword of Shannara, you mention that you wrote the book because you loved those teen-aged adventures like Ivanhoe, The Black Arrow, and The Three Musketeers. Is that the age group for which you were shooting? Brooks: I think you are most intense in your reading habits when you're in your teenage years. Magic is \"real\" your hormones are raging, and you're more open. When I'm writing, I'm always writing to that group of people. I'm going into my second generation—parents who have turned their kids on to a book. You've got all these young readers and teachers who really want a good story with characters they can identify with. The impetus for the original story was that I wanted the main characters to be just like us-able to get through life and not looking for any trouble. They're not interested in the magic. They just have to deal with it. This demands of them that they take a second look at who they are and their attitudes, CGW: So, you deal with the idea of reality through the use of fantasy? Brooks: The good thing about fantasy is that you can do anything, but you have to do it in a logical reasonable way. It does allow us to look at this world CGW: That reminds me of a profound line in The Wishsong of Shannara. It goes something like \"evil cannot be contained because when it breaks out it, will be stronger and more vicious than before. Brooks: That's right. We could take Sarajevo as an example. We've regressed 50 years and we're back where we were in the Balkan days. CGW: I suppose we ought to get to the subject of computer games, though. Do you play computer games yourself? Brooks: I don't, but my 12-year-old son is a computer whiz and speaks a different language. I don't know if he knows what he's talking about or not, but I enjoy watching him some. CGW: What are his favorite games? Brooks: [Sio Meier's CIVILIZATION, THEME PARK, and SIM CITY CLASSIC. CGW: Since you don't play computer games, did you feel any anxiety about turning parts of your universe over to computer game designers? Brooks: Of course, it's something like the idea of doing a movie. There's always the question of who you would cast as what character and the reality that whoever is cast in that role is indelibly in people's minds from then on. There's also the matter of losing control, but when I talked to these folks (Corey and Lori Cole) and realized how much they cared about the books and the characters, I felt better. I like the idea that I will continue to write the books and others will work on projects which surround the timeline, characters and settings I've established. CGW: Speaking of which, what is the next book? Brooks: The next book is a prequel to the first trilogy. It deals with the forging of the sword. in a different sort of way. I can be talking about what I see happening in this world, but it doesn't come across as preachy. When you pick up the paper and read it in the morning, you're full of ideas. CGW: Well, judging from your books, you must feel that evil is fairly strong in the modern world, Brooks: I like the multicultural, multifaceted idea of projecting what is bad about the world. Evil manifests itself in so many different ways that you can never be sure that you're finished with it. This is a world where everything has gotten too big and too complicated. We're struggling to get a grip on it. We've got the nuclear threat as a side effect to the good which technology brings. Magic in the books and technology in the world have some real correlation. 130 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1995 "

"STRATEGY Rhyme Of The Ancient MechWarrior Revealing Tales Of A Star-Colonel's MECHWARRIOR 2 Tactics by Martin E. Cirulis \"Hunker down here, Sparky, Inner Sphere tactics that are worth listening to. And don't be turnin' your Clan nose up at any of 'em; ighteen standard years of training and discipline had brought him to this place, to this scorched tarmac. An angry Red Giant and I'll teach you some filled one-fifth of the sky, and its tiny blue companion star burned brightly on the horizon. Strange gravity pulled at him, while the dust, the unending dust, blew by him. The horizon, far too close a and narrow by the ancient Terran standard, still seemed impossibly huge-the llat dunes left nothing to hold up the sky, He longed for the perfect, walled world of the Generation ships where he was born. His mood improved little as he strode across the huge staging base. Everything they work and they'll keep was in motion. Raids against the crazed Falcon would begin soon, and the Wolves were restless; he was no exception. There had already been skirmishes along the border worlds, but tomorrow, for the first time in nearly 300 years, there would be all-out war amongst the clans. Tomorrow, a lifetime of training would be measured out in crashing steel and plasma fire. Tomorrow, he would be good enough-or dead. He didn't know which. The warning call from a transport snapped him out of his brooding long enough to step out of the monster's way. Squinting against the dust kicked up by the flatbed, he stared at the transport's cargo as it rumbled by, less than a meter away. He only caught a glimpse of the fallen Warhammer, but it was enough to catch the soot-blurred wolf insignia underyou alive. It's not like you get bonus points in Valhalla for dying with a high degree of difficulty.\" neath the shattered cockpit. He didn't catch the Sibko glyph, though, and could only wonder if he had already lost a friend before the war had even been declared. The young MechWarrior shook his head angrily and sprinted across the road-lines ahead. His destination, a scarred and dented Timberwolf, loomed over the prefab huts, but was itself dwarfed by the artificial mountain of the Mech Bay. Reclining against the ankle housing of this 75 ton metallic behemoth, reading a paperback instead of a complate, was the man he had come to see. This was the man who might be able to give him The Edge-or at least enough knowledge to see the War through to its end. \"Star-Colonel Hammerson, Sir!\" he barked, executing the rigid clan salute. The older man continued to read for a few seconds before turning the page and folding the corner over. He closed the book, his sigh lost in the roar of base operations, and slid down the foot of his Mech to tower over the junior oflicer. He returned the salute haphazardly. \"Something I can help you with, pup? I booked off today, you know.\" Confronted by the reality of this freeborn officer, the MechWarrior suddenly reconsidered his plan. The Star-Colonel was freakishly large for a Mech pilot; and the younger man wondered how he ever could fit into the cramped cockpit of a mech. He was far too old to be a combat officer-even 188 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD. NOVEMBER 1995 "

This is a significant accomplishment: each of the 30 players on the field moves remarkably smoothly, individually running, kicking, jumping, and writhing on the ground in pain. Even more amazing is the fact that the game runs flawlessly on a 66 MHz 486 system. Unfortunately, all is not exactly peachy keen on the graphical front. At times during the game (during kicks, in particular), the game switches to a high-resolution screen that just doesn't work right. On one system, the screen cut itself in half whenever the game jumped to highres. On another system, the screen flickered as if possessed. On two other machines, the game simply crashed. Suffice it to say that this display mode is out of whack. Thankfully, this can be disabled upon startup from the command line (just type \"GO-H» when you play).

Critics point to the severe injuries, even deaths, that occur in the amateur and pro ranks.

Worse, the critics hide behind the thin shield of the civilized world,\" forgetting the significance boxing has had in our society.

To millions of radio listeners half a century ago, a Dempsey or Tunney title defense was as eagerly anticipated as anything. Boxing is violent, yes; but it is also larger than life and full of excitement—a single punch can end a bout at any moment-attributes which fuel the sport's excitement as surely now as 50 years ago.

And the corner when a boxer is pinned on the the fighters have lots of character-some ropes, etc. One major beef: when each guys seem able to fight their way off the ropes, while others have trouble getting through a round without suffering a cut. The tension builds as you try to coax your fighter through another round, avoiding a technical knockout from too much punishment, or deciding that this is the round that you go for the big KO. TITLE FIGHT PRO BOXING is easily the best boxing game ever produced The research is excellent, the interface is far better than Trunzo's earlier game designs, and the pace of play is brisk, brief and quite enjoyable. The best thing about TiTLE FIGHT, though, is that the blend of ratings and color comments actually gives didn't hurt. Tyson becomes more frustrated as the round continues, and completely whiffs on a roundhouse blow. Seeing his chance, Ali lands a combination, followed by two quick, hard jabs and an uppercut. Tyson, who had derided Ali's punching power in pre-fight press conferences, is visibly shaken. Pinned to the ropes, and with his trainer screaming wildly, Tyson clinches and covers up to avoid further damage. A solid round for Ali. Round 3: An angry Tyson is browbeaten by Eddie Futch into keeping his cool. Instead of a dangerous all-out knockout attempt, he bides his time and ignores Ali's taunts. Ali continues to rack up points with his pinpoint jabs, but can't really hurt Tyson. With only 30 seconds left in the round, Tyson ducks under a punch and tags Ali with an exploding right to the jaw. The ropes sag with Ali's weight as he desperately tries to fend off the dangerous Tyson assault. But with victory seemingly within his grasp. Tyson is unable to knock Ali out and the round ends. Round 4: Tyson is pacing between rounds like a caged tiger, and Rudy Ortega has to motion him back to his corner. Ali thus gains a few more precious seconds of rest, and looks determined and reasonably fresh when the round begins. Tyson forces his way inside, but that only opens up his forehead for a crisp Ali combination. It seems that Ali actually gets stronger as the round progressles_even a hard left to the midsection doesn't slow him down. The round ends with both fighters warily eyeing the other, and is scored even. Round 5: Ali turns Tyson's own tactics against him and moves to Tyson's body, scoring with an uppercut. Both men deal out incredible punishment; then Ali regains his sanity and moves off, staying just out of Tyson's reach. Increasing fatigue from both fighters reduces the rest of the round to a clinching contest, and one ringside observer commented, \"Man, the way these two guys hug each other, you'd think they were long-lost brothers.\" Right In any case, despite all the carnage, another even round. Rounds 6-8: Sensing Tyson's frustration. All comments: \"Think you can outlast me? I'm going out on the town after I beat you.\" It seems that Ali is certainly ready for a date, so nimble is his dancing about the ring. Time and again Tyson lands a glancing blow or misses entirely, leaving himself open for Ali's precise counter-punching skills. It's apparent that Ali's strategy is to wear Tyson down and finish him off in the later rounds. The judges recognize that Muhammad is in control of the fight and reward him with two of the three rounds. Round 9: Ali predicted that Tyson would go down in the 9th, so Mike would like nothing better than to turn the tables on his adversary. He calmly tells his corner \"He's overconfident. This is the round.\" Turns out, he's almost right. A rare miss by Ali allows Tyson to squeeze a hammer of a left past Ali's defenses. Ali's head snaps back, sweat flying so far that it splashes people at ringside. But Tyson, like so many opponents, underestimates Ali's ability to take a punch. Splendid footwork and another miss by Tyson let Ali maneuver long enough to get off one good right hand which opens a cut over Tyson's left eye. While he keeps pounding away at Ali, Tyson's momentarily impaired vision prevents him once again, from landing the final killer shot. This fine round does move Tyson back into contention, however. ROunds 10-12: Ali stays outside, targeting Tyson's damaged eye. By the end of round 11, it has swelled shut despite the cut-man's best efforts. \"There wasn't no ice made that was gonna reduce that swelling.\" Futch states after the fights. Tyson is outscored in all three rounds (although one judge seems to be watching a different fight, as he rates two of the three rounds as even). Round 13: \"Iron Mike\" is utterly exhausted, and getting desperate. Ali mercilessly pummels him as Tyson misses right and left. But, as Ali moves to finish, Iron Mike lands a haymaker and Ali crumples to the mat Ortega takes the count to five, but Ali somehow gets up and regains his composure during the standing-eight count. But once again, with only 15 seconds left in the round, Tyson just can't put Ali away. Round 14: Any average fan knows by now that the fight is Ali's to win or lose, but the consummate pro has no desire to be robbed by the judges. Likewise, Tyson knows his only real chance is a knockout, and circles cautiously, trying to keep Ali away from his vulnerable left side. The crushing right scores only sporadically, however, as its target continues to skip to and fro. Ali's superior footwork--the envy of any ballet star-has reduced Tyson to a desperate man whose labored breathing seems almost audible to people in the stands. The crowd senses that the bout nears an end, and begins shouting Ali's name with every punch he lands. Finally, Tyson's hands drop ever so slightly and Ali summons his last reserves-12 consecutive punches land on Tyson's face, chest, stomach and chin. Tyson drops to the canvas: one...two...three...somehow he struggles up just before the count is over. Ali moves in again, and scores on five more punches. Rudy Ortega wraps his arms around livson to protect him from further damage. Ali wins by TKO! After the fight, Tyson holds an ice pack the size of Texas on his left eye and grumbled about his missed chances. Ali said that Tyson obviously needed a rest, and was welcome to join him at the Kentucky Derby for a mint julep-but only as his guest. You see, Ali and his manager had already worked out a cable deal for a $100 million fight against Rocky Marciano, with a certain 63-year-old grandfather waiting in the wings for the winner. 222 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD.

Current Bout: Refereed by Muhammad Ali vs Mike Tyson <generic <generic Cancel Eighters + Commen Officials hall Location Options Add Cornerman... Save as Default Delete Comerman Restore Defaults containing hundreds of current and retired boxers, from the most renowned heavyweight to the most inept welterweight. There are even \"Trial Horse\" boxing bums (guys like Peter McNeeley) to pad your fighter's record with, just like in real life. After picking a lighter, you choose in which of 45 different cities your bout will take place. Then you decide on a referee, keeping in mind that each man, whether current or a famous retired referee, varies in how strictly he calls fouls and how early he tends to stop fights. Optionally, you may also select a cornerman, who can increase your fighter's endurance and might just keep that nasty gash on your fighter's cheek under control long enough to avoid a TKO. Gameplay hinges on control ratings, which measure a fighter's ability. All fighters vary in their ability to fight against different styles. TriLE FIGHT breaks this down into sluggers (Tyson, Marciano), pure boxers (Ali, Holmes) and those fighters adept at either style (Joe Louis). The game even has special rules to cover southpaw fighters. At the beginning of each round, you dictate a strategy. Based on your fighter's historical style, these include: fighting inside (can really lower your opponent's endurance) or outside, fighting offensively Cornermen <generic) Eddy \"The Clot\" Aliano Al Artola Teddy Allas Georgie Benton Johnny Bos Pete Brodsky Tom Browner Danny Carbajal Ralph Citro Richard Conti Pepe Corea Alberto Davila Mickey Duff Angelo Dundee Time Period: Modern Modern Retired O Old Time Retired Select higher then choose a comercian for that highler Muhammad Ali Angelo Dundee Endurance 9 Reduce Cuts 9 Swelling 8 O Mike Tyson Eddy 'The Clot\" Aliano Endurance 0 Reduce Cuts 13 Swelling 8 STAUNCH THE BLEEDING The menus make prefight selections a breeze. When I go up against a class fighter, I want Eddy \"The Clot\" Aliano in my corner. (scores more points) and defensively (safer), covering up (self-preservation) and going for the knockout (all-out or controlled). Each of these strategies have inherent risks to go along with their benefits. One unique feature I really like is a rule that limits certain fighters' options: Ali, for example, may only go for a knockout twice during a bout. The points scored for each punch are automatically recorded while comments such as \"Did you see Ali's head snap back on that blow?\" scroll by. These text files are color-coded for each fighter, with some THE ULTIMATE BOUT Muhammad Ali vs. Mike Tyson Location: Las Vegas Referee: Rudy Ortega (Strict Fouls, Normal Fight Stoppage) Cornermen: Angelo Dundee (Ali) 9-9-8 (Endurance-CutsSwelling) Eddie Futch (Tyson) (10-7-8) lyson has the punching power, while Ali's defense and quickness are legendary. The cornermen are about the same, but Eddie Futch's calming influence on the fiery Tyson can't be minimized. Rudy Ortega is so in control of the bout that he seems nearly invisible in the ring, and the boxers respect his decisions. Amidst endless prattle from the ringside announcer, the boxers finally arrive. Ali removes his robe to show off his trunks: gold lame' with \"Ali\" embroidered in metallic silver. Tyson, as usual is dressed in black trunks with no socks, his body Muhammad's defensive skills are more than equal to the task, as the majority of the blows are caught by Ali's gloves. Finally, Tyson breaks through, landing a blow that elicits gasps from the crowd. Ali almost goes to one knee, but steadies himself just in time, Rudy Ortega looks at Ali closely, but when Ali goes into his famous shuffle, the referee backs off and lets the fighters continue. Ali is content to \"Rope-ADope,\" covering up for the rest of the round, and despite Tyson's best efforts, Mike can make no progress. Still, the round goes to Tyson. Round 2: Realizing that trying to match Tyson inside is madness, Ali wisely moves outside, where his height and reach allow him a slight advantage. Surprisingly, Ali misses a right cross, and Tyson lands a crushing hook to Ali's ribs. Ali simply shakes his head, smiles to the crowd and says \"It seemingly sculpted from the same stone Michelangelo used to carve Adonis. The two meet at ring center and stare into the depths of each other's soul, probing for any chink in the enemy armor.

While with the original concept, and in my opinion, it the conmakes CAESAR II more likely to stand the test of cept was time. (For a sneak preview of CAESAR II, check out last month's CGW.) * Once upon a time, there was a rumor about a computerized version of the hit boardgame, World in Flames. Well, it's more than a rumor now. Appearing at Origins in the Australian Design Group booth was Chris Marinacci, the lead programmer on the project. He sat beside a monitor showing off the latest work-in-progress version of the game, in Windows. He proudly told everyone who would listen that the computer version of WORLD IN FLAMES is being programmed in Delphi. \"It's a great development environment for Windows games. I hate to see people who don't know any better suffer with developing in C++.\" Interestingly, the map covers the entire planet, hex-by-hex. There are no more \"off map boxes\" to represent the US (or South America, or anywhere else, for that matter). The map has been completely redone for the computer version (using the boardgame's European map scale), and there are now new lands for the Axis to conquer. Talk about your German-Japanese handshake! (continued on page 254) THE DISORIENTATION FACTOR Often, flipping ends of the telescope between a strategic game and a tactical battle is disorienting. Take, for example, the lesson of Sid Meier's Civil War. As this game languishes on a back burner somewhere on Sid's hard drive, many are left to wonder whatever happened to such an anticipated title. Having pushed the pieces around a bit on it, I could see that there was both a patented Sid Meier \"cool\" strategic-level game covering by Alan Emrich NOVEMBER 1995  COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 253 "

The Thirty Years War was a dynastic and religious struggle for European hegemony in the first half of the seventeenth century, and the play of events is well suited to Warlords It's game engine. This scenario features 70 cities, 40 ruins, and is intended for 8 players. New army and city sets have also been custom designed for this scenario. Will also guarantees that you will go broke unless you sack and pillage. * Speaking of WARLORDS II, SSG'S WARLORDS II DELUXE should finally be reaching the states by the time you read this. This should put SSG's A-Team back on their long-anticipated Ardennes project that (hopefully) will be released in the fourth quarter of this year. One new deal rumored out of SSG is a collectable trading card game based on football («That's soccer' to you, Yank\"), designed by lan Trout, and featuring teams from Down Under. Chances are we won't be seeing much of that product here in the States, though. Too bad. * Late word from New World Computing cites SPACEWARD, Ho!

Presently, the release is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1995. * At SimTex, now owned by Spectrum HoloByte, those \"Masters of Magic\" (and ORIOn) have shifted their Master of Xenon (working title) game into beta mode and are hoping for a fourth quarter release through MicroProse this year. * The scenario list is in for Empire II: The Art of War, produced by White Wolf and published by New World Computing.

It includes ten new battles and, best of all, a complete editor so players can create both scenarios and campaigns. * Many rumors this month center around Avalon Hill. Many of these started soon after the 7/11/95 edition of The Baltimore Sun ran a story entitled Game Company for Sale. Needless to say, when the Origins convention kicked off in Philadelphia two days later, the exhibitor hall was abuzz with rumors and speculation. Bill Levay, Director of Software Development at Avalon Hill, comments: \"MonarchAvalon (the parent corporation of Avalon Hilll is not in debt, as reported in the Baltimore Sun newspaper. In fact, it has a cushion of $1.1M.\" So what's all this news that Avalon Hill is in distress? «That article was about Monarch-Avalon. The writer decided to frame the story from the angle that Monarch-Avalon is a game company [only]. Why? Because Avalon Hill is known internationally for its games.\" What has brought the company under fiscal scrutiny these days is a year old publication Monarch-Avalon launched called Girl's Life. This magazine, for pre-teen girls, is distributed en masse to grocery stores and newsCROSS the Eastern Theater he had to emphasize one scale over the of the war, as well as other; so, until he wins his internal civil an absorbing tactical war, this title is doomed to languish in module.

Insignificant though they might be, I was reluctant to sacrifice any piece. How could you do that and hope to win? Of course, I was only eight years old and had no idea of gambits or even basic opening play; I just knew that in my new Boys' Life magazine, Bobby Fischer's column said that P-K4 was the best move. Who was I to argue? And so my chess instruction began...

"SYSTEM GAME COACH OPTIONS HELA 100022 Expert Chess EXPERT SOFTWARE (305-448-2074) Expert Software makes a living out of taking classic parlor and card games, and transforming them into quick, fun affairs for Windows. If only EXPERT CHESS performed anywhere near to club-level, much less expert level, this could have been a good introductory chess program. Where BOBBY FISCHER made all the right decisions, EXPERT CHESS embodies all that is bad about \"budget software,\" cutting corners everywhere. While the sparse documentation can be somewhat forgiven because of the Windows help file included, the buggy software cannot. Two of the three copies CGW received for review had corrupted files, and even the one I got running crashed at the worst possible times (when I was winning, of course). The game looks terrible, sounds bad and takes forever to make pretty obvious moves. The opening library is limited, and the game doesn't work even as a teaching tool. There is a modicum of a challenge on the topmost level, but I was starting to gain weight from all the sandwiches I was eating waiting for the computer to move, so...sometimes, you get what you pay for.

I put the Al through its paces and found to my delight that it actually understood the difference between an open and closed game. If I left it room to maneuver, it would sometimes go for the kill, and would also patiently work for an endgame advantage. My main frustration was that (as with so many other programs) it takes far too long to move on the higher levels. So, you either get good but slow competition, or brisk but merely decent. The interface is familiar Windows 3.1, but I wish Capstone could straighten out their sound drivers. I had these annoying beeps-couldn't turn them off-going off every time either I or the AI moved, drowning out the MIDI music. Still, the weirdnesses can be forgiven, since GRANDMASTER CHESS supports not only modem, but network play as well. Moreover, the incredibly extensive database contains thousands of games from grandmasters and famous tournaments, with such gems as the best games of Harry Nelson Pillsbury and even a master game from the 1600s! If the opening libraries were as extensive as say, CHESSMASTER, this could have been my top pick. But the engine relies far too much on its canned openings, without nearly the variety of natural styles that CM4000/5000 have. Veteran players will find that if they can get GM CHESS \"out of book,\" they can win more often than not.

"THE TRANSITION GAME How To Move From Grand Strategy To A Brilliant Tactical Victory Step One: Reconnoiter The recon map screen available during unit selection is a good place to plan strategy. Here, it is easy to discern the proper avenues of attack from the maior terrain features depicted on the map. We will strike in the valley between the twin forests, with a balanced force that will remain intact long enough to take the victory point sites. Step Two: Operational Mobility Along the long North African coastline, we place our strike forces. If you make the mistake of placing too much armor far for ward, they will outrun your infantry. Make sure that mobile infantry is well-protected, as your column is vulnerable on Turn One. Don't let the enemy get between you and the coastline. Step Three: Coordinated Attack The three-point assault is tricky to pull off, but less so because of our solid preparation. Notice how the artillery are well within support range, mercilessly shelling the enemy while staying out of their tanks' more limited range. Infantry follow close behind and take up positions in the woods. Step Four: Mopping Up Rather than waste time bashing on the retreating forces in the south woods, we circle north to capture the cluster of 100-point cities. Any potential danger to our flank is covered by the infantry to our rear.

"WINDOWS 95 Willosos WINDOWS 98 WITOWS WILLOW& 9 VINOWS Willows95 WINDOWS 95: The Road Ahead WINDOWS OS WINDOWS indows 95 arrived in stores on August 24, and sold four million copies within the first three weeks. In that same time period, almost four million new PCs shipped with Win 95 installed. The tidal wave has arrived. As you've followed our Win 95 coverage, you've seen that the operating system has great potential to revolutionize gaming on the PC. Features such as AutoPlay CDs that start up automatically upon insertion, instant recognition of sound and video cards, the elimination of memory management issues, and system-wide game controller support promise to eliminate the biggest headaches of PC gaming. The upcoming Game SDK will allow developers to create Windows games with faster video than their DOS ancestors, better support for digitized sounds, and easily-configurable networked play. Despite all this promise, many gamers have found their initial experience with Win 95 to be one of discovery peppered with a fair amount of frustration. Converting your old MS-DOS or Win 3.1 system over to Win 95 often involves digging into configuration files, hunting for new hardware drivers, setting up icons to run all your old DOS games, and sometimes even a trip to the corner computer emporium for another 4MB of RAM or a bigger hard drive, Despite these difficulties, though, the quality and ease of setup of the initial wave of Win 95 titles indicates that the operating system will live up to its promises, and that 1996 will be a good year for gamers. Any initial difficulties are a hump that's worth getting over, because the road ahead offers a faster speed limit and a much smoother ride than the one we've traveled to get here.

Run the included batch file, and it will archive your original MW2SHELL.EXE and MW2.PRJ files, replacing them with new, patched versions that allow you to choose the Battlemaster as your Mech in the Trials of Grievance. (To use the Battlemaster in combat, you must also follow the instructions listed in the MECHWARRIOR 2 codes portion of this article. Although I was able to use the Battlemaster in combat without any trouble, you may want to be a bit on the careful side when using this unoflicial patch.

Before attempting to use any of these programs, you should back up your saved game files to a safe location. Nothing can make a difficult game worse faster than a corrupted game file. For more MECHWARRIOR 2 hints and tips, check out the strategy guide on page 188 in this issue. In MECHWARRIOR 2, you can use three undocumented units by following this procedure: 1. Select Trials of Grievance from the main menu. 2. Select the star configuration option (the five-pointed star) for the Mechs in your group. 3. In the configuration screen, erase your current call sign and replace it with the word ENZO. 4. Return to the Mech lab, and you'll be able to examine two new Mechs and a suit of combat armor worn by clan soldiers (the Tarantula, Battle Master and the Elemental combat armor). The Elemental and the Tarantula can both be used in combat. Using the BattleMaster in combat will cause a program error, but this problem can be remedied by using Louis C. Hendricks' Battle Master utility (BTTLMSTR.ZIP, described above) to patch the MW2 program files.
