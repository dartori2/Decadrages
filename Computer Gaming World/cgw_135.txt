"COMPUTER GAMING WORLD simply throw on video, animation, sound and a few hot spots for us to browse. Browsing, though, is the low end of interactivity. These designs seem merely to be created from the perspective of filling a CD rather than allowing the user/gamer to play. And let's face it, the power of computing is the power of play. Why are spreadsheets important? They give you a template to play with figures, data and \"What if?\"s. Why were word processors revolutionary? They let you move your words around and play with new structures and phrasing while keeping the old structure in memory—sort of verbal risk management. Why are databases powerful? They let you play around with the data, sorting and printing to fit your need or whim of the moment. The most powerful designs in any type of computing let you do something with the assembled data. (With apologies to Chris Crawford for paraphrasing his classic argument.) As both a gamer and someone who has watched computer game design for a long time, I'm not against using new technologies. I'm not against streaming video and I'm not against either 3-D graphics or 3-D sound design. I think they can all eventually enhance our gaming experiences. But right now I'm hearing a lot of frustration from gamers in the feedback to this magazine and online comments from people playing new games. And I hope that designers will listen to their audience and not forget what kinds of games they're designing and why people want to play them. People still want to go to new places, meet interesting characters and do things they couldn't necessarily do in «real» life. Why add unnecessary obstacles which may keep them from getting the full benefit for which they purchased the game? Using filler doesn't necessarily make the experience fuller.

CRUSADER is a strategic action game utilizing a refreshing 3/4 perspective, gorgeous Super VGA graphics and a underlying storyline in the WING COMMANDER III fashion (but, sans big name stars). For more information, check out our Sneak Preview on page 190. CYBERMAGE is another action hybrid that has people drooling. At first glance a spiced-up version of SYSTEM SHOCK, this game is anything but that. Using a brand new engine, Origin is going one step further in creating a fully functioning world. Getting away from the level-oriented approach, CYBERMAGE allows you free reign of a city where you can: hop into a assault hovercraft and strafe the city; fight battles alongside lifelike allies; enter city shops and perform many more destructive actions. Super VGA graphics, of course, will also be part of the package. CYBERMAGE and CRUSADER should both be available in time for the holiday season.

"The Faces of Creation The Inner Workings Of Game Design Are Complex And Highly Inter-related. The Designer Writes A Blueprint, Artists And Programmers Assemble The Game, And The Producer Makes Sure All The Gears Are In Sync. Find Out How Game Design Craftsmen Use The Tools Of Their Trade. by Paul C. Schuytema vertisement for some exciting game, only to find that it's going to be another six months before the game appears on store shelves. Just what's going on during that time? A game begins its life long before that first premature ad is placed. What goes into a game as it grows from an embryonic idea into a major hit—or a flash-in-the-pan? Who brings it to life, and how? Let's probe the life cycle of a computer game, from design to disk. great game's gestation can begin anywhere: as scrawls on a napkin, thoughts in a shower, an exciting novel, or from a carefully directed group discussion. However the initial idea is born, it is only that: an idea. As anyone who has ever thought of writing The Great American Novel knows, an idea and a finished project are light-years apart. You or I might come up with the perfect idea for our culture's seminal novel, but with out writing skills, research, massive amounts of time, effort, sweat and tears—and the watchful eye of a good editor—the book will never even have the opportunity to gather dust at our local Waldenbooks. The same holds true for computer games. The idea is the spark, and often that spark can carry the inertia needed to light the fire. But much hard work must follow if that great idea is going to develop into a great game. You've surely been frustrated to see a full-color adGAME DESIGNER DESIGNING WOMEN AND MEN Games often grow from very rough, basic ideas. One programmer may think, \"I want to make a 3-D game about blasting demons with a shotgun.\" Another may sit down with a team and say, \"Let's create as realistic a football simulation as we can,\" while yet another might suggest \"Wouldn't it be cool if we could really make the ultimate aerobatic flight simulator?\" Sometimes the marketing folks get involved. \"Well, we've released Lord's Quest Ten and we didn't quite hit it the OCTOBER 1995 . COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 39 "


"INSIDE GAME DESIGN dressed in a rumpled cream shirt, glasses, and wellworn suede dress shoes, he doesn't initially present the aura of a cutting-edge game designer. Spend a couple of minutes talking with him, though, and his voice becomes more animated, more authoritative. After five minutes, you learn that this man knows design, and knows it very well. SimTex, the company which sprouted out of his original MASTER OF Orion seedling, is as unimposing as level of perhaps four titles per year. Barcia and the SimTex team brainstorm ideas, and when they hit on one which feels right, Barcia will sit down and draw up a rough outline, an overview of the major concepts. Once SimTex decides on a project, Barcia tries to cloister himself away from the distractions which surround him and spend upwards of a month crafting an extremely thorough design document. This design plan is detailed to such a sufficient level that the proway we wanted--the players just weren't happy. What can we do better for LQ 11?\" Or there's the insidious \"We need a 3-D shooter, because that's where the market share is. We'll just work on the story later.\" All of these are variations on the initial ideas for past and future games. Yet, these kernels of creativity are so generic that they're nearly useless. Assume you were a programmer and I was to hand you the second idea on this list and say, \"Here's a killer idea. I want it in beta within nine months.\" Would you be ready to roll? Could you craft a richly textured and balanced simulation capable of captivating the imagination of tens of thousands of players? (If you could, fax me your resume and we'll start a company, right now.) Odds are, you'd be adrift in a world of possibilities, unsure as to which of myriad directions to take. On the other hand, what if I were to provide you with a comprehensive document, one which broke the game down into clearly defined and easily described programming tasks? Would your job become easier? Almost certainly. Now, consider the fact that today's games are almost entirely developed by teams of anywhere from a dozen members to the giant 100-person projects of companies like Origin, LucasArts and Sierra. This alone necessitates far more time spent in the preplanning stages of any project than the \"do-it-yourself\" in a spare bedroom games of the late '70s and early '80s. Also, since more than a few games now sport budgets of millions of dollars compared to the relatively few thousands involved in the early days, no one is willing to risk diving into a project and designing it on the fly. Naturally, it is the designer, or in some cases the design team, who is responsible for taking the initial idea and developing it into a sophisticated design document from which the programmers, artists, musicians and the rest of the development team can work. \"I THINK ABOUT THE END-USER ALL THE TIME WHEN I'M DESIGNING A GAME,\" SAYS SIMTEX CHIEF DESIGNER STEVE BARCIA. \"WE'RE NOT INTO FEATURISM; WE'RE JUST INTO GOOD GAMES. IS THE GAME REALLY FUN? IS IT ADDICTIVE? THE CURE FOR DESIGNER BLUES Steve Barcia, ia, BEING ADDICTIVE IS THE MOST president of SimTex and their chief designer, deeply believes in his obligation to his players IMPORTANT (INGREDIENT].\" to create a truly fun game. DESIGNER PROFILE STEVE BARCIA, SIMTEX SOFTWARE Steve Barcia, president and chief designer at SimTex, started with a small, tight team. Working with just his wife and a friend, he created the initial version of MASTER OF Orion. From that humble beginning, Barcia has since risen to become one of the most respected designers in the computer game industry. All of that in the space of just a few years. Barcia is unassuming. He shares with his wife an office so messy that he refused to allow me even a glimpse inside. His voice is soft and calculated, and Barcia. Located in a suite of offices above a very tasty gyro joint in Austin, Texas, the SimTex team works a schedule more akin to the rest of the white collar world than the mania usually associated with game creation. In fact, with so much of today's business shifting more and more into a \"push mode,\" SimTex seems like a welcome oasis of intellectual tranquillity. Not that the team doesn't work hard, they just seem to do so efficiently. Where an Origin team might crank zombie hours for months before the release of a product, the SimTex folks work along steadily at about 40 hours a week. The offices themselves feel rather organic, almost fly-by-night. Most of the staff work on large folding tables rather than traditional desks, with boxes stacked up everywhere. In the chaos, Barcia hunts on an abandoned desk in a dark room, searching for a newly opened box of business cards. He smiles as he pulls one out and presents it to me. \"We felt like a real company after we got these,\" he jokes. Barcia is very analytical in his design work. He just seems to be able to think, effortlessly, in game design terms. SimTex has a queue of several dozen projects, although the company's goal is to reach a production grammers can begin working on components almost immediately. While many development houses begin work on a project before the design work is wholly completed, Barcia believes in nailing down 99.5 percent of the design, from rules to unit strengths to interfaces, before a single line of code is ever written. \"I think about the end-user all the time when I'm designing a game,\" says Barcia. \"All the time. You have to. I do not adapt my games to compete with other games out there, because other people are already doing that. We're not into featurism; we're just into good games. For me, it's all game.

Being addictive is the most important (ingredient).\" With an education in electrical engineering, Barcia has the systematic skills to create a very functional design document. He learned computer science on his own, as a hobby, and his extensive programming skills give him an advantage over non-programming designers, as they allow him to easily gauge what can or can't be done in any design. \"Being a programmer,\" says Barcia, \"it's very easy for me to come up with an algorithm that models what I was talking about in the design.

"INSIDE GAME DESIGN STEVE'S GUIDE TO BECOMING A GOOD DESIGNER owadays, it seems as if everyone wants to jump on the computer game band wagon, to become part of an industry that seems glamorous, fun and exciting. While that may be true, it's also an industry fueled by unreal hours, mega amounts of hard work, and a whole lot of luck. Steve Barcia of SimTex offers these pointers for those of you who want to try your hand at game design: 1. Play a lot of games (it will instantly give you a lot of ideas). \"I've been told that 96% of all game ideas are not new,\" says Barcia. \"If this is true, then it's especially important for an aspiring designer to play a lot of games: computer games, board games, role-playing games, everything.\" Learn to decide what you like and don't like in a game. 3. Learn to listen to other people, learning what they like and don't like in a game. 4. Read about different rule systems and learn how rule systems work. 5. Form a hierarchy of rules. If an idea violates a rule, you just have to toss it out and keep working until you find one that works. 6. You must be humble. \"You have to deal with a lot of people,\" cautions Barcia. «If you're starting to get an attitude, then you'll run into problems.\" Railroads Rolle Barons pect.\" the effects of their actions, to know that what they do adrenaline flowing—the player needs to be 'locked' in a game actually affects what happens.

He then develops specific algorithmic rules to allow various attacks to work within his combat scheme. \"A lot of design is just defining your basis,\" reflected Barcia. \"It's pretty systematic. Also, there's a realistic limit to the amount of control and rules variations you can give the player. Beyond that limit, the player will feel that he will not be able to understand these concepts. \"Simple rules of thumb are necessary. Like in [MASTER OF] Orion, it's simple.

"INSIDE GAME DESIGN Barcia, \"it's a lot of hard work. It can be very frustrating at times. I don't think that I've had a day off, that wasn't somehow business-related, for about a year and a half. But I put in lots of hours and never notice it. It's not stressful.

It was something kind of magical or mystical.\" Finally, he had to strike out on his own with MASTER Of Orion. He made the leap, and it paid off. SimTex is one of the hottest small developers going, with publishers left and right knocking on their door for the honor of publishing their next title. \"Now, my parents still don't understand what's going on or what I'm doing,\" muses Barcia, \"but they know that I'm doing it well.\" \"BASICALLY, I GET PAID TO MAKE GAMES,\" SAYS INTERPLAY PRODUCER VINCE DENARDO. \"IN A NUTSHELL, THAT'S THE BEST DESCRIPTION OF MY JOB.

Of course, being a motivator is a key ingredient as well, since someone needs to whip the oarsmen when the release date is fast approaching and sleep is far more difficult to come by than instant coffee.

We have poorly or non-documented-at-all library code.\" Savage's first task at Origin was to learn how all of this basic code, as well as Origin's libraries of C++ routines, actually worked. He remembers pulling up the source for a simple input-output class. Reading through the variable declarations, everything seemed neat and polished, but once he SAVAGE COMMANDER delved into the meat Frank Savage got his of the code, it made start programming 3-D no sense whatsoever. terrain for STRIKE Luckily for Savage, he COMMANDER before taking was very adept at the Director of Programtracking down where ming slot on WING COMMANDER III. a previous programmer had made a particular function work properly in a prior game. Playing sleuth, he could then deduce how to use Origin's library routines. A lead programmer on a project, explains Savage, Every year, Savage made the trek from Chicago to Milwaukee for the annual GenCon game convention. In 1991, he met Origin's Warren Spector, hoping to find out more about the upcoming WING COMMANDER II. As it turned out, Spector was on a recruiting trip for STRIKE COMMANDER program mers and immediately spotted some serious potential in the young Frank Savage. Within two weeks, after only a phone interview, Savage was packing up his worldly possessions and heading off to Origin, never having seen the company or Austin, Texas, or having met anyone from Origin other than Spector. For STRIKE COMMANDER, Savage worked on the threedimensional terrain system and the fractal generation routines. All the while, he harbored fantasies about getting to work on the next of his beloved WING COMMANDER games. \"I didn't expect to be anything more than a regular programmer on WING COMMANDER III.\" says Savage. \"Just to be able to say that some part of this is me would have been enough, but when they actually gave me the director position, that was incredible. It's been really cool since then.\" sure that his or her team clearly understands what it is they are supposed to do at any given moment. \"The one thing a programmer does not want to be told is exactly what to do,\" says Savage. \"They want to know what they can't do more than what they can.\" At the beginning of a project such as Wing COMMANDER III, the lead programmer must assemble a programming staff and then take a running charge at all the low-level code which the game relies upon. WING COMMANDER III was one of the first games which Origin attempted in 32-bit flat protected mode, so the initial stages were as mundane as figuring out what brand of compiler was up to the task. After that, the team set about to transfer the low-level code from STRIKE COMMANDER into the new 32-bit code. Working through those problems enabled them to really judge the efficacy of their compiler and debugger. From that information, Savage was able to ballpark an estimate of development time, which he guessed at 18 months. The next step for Savage, as lead programmer, was to compile a milestone list. Milestones are specific components of a game which must be completed by a deadline. Otherwise, the game slips behind schedule. In Wing 3, the team hit all of the milestones early or ACECRETS SINE \"MAKING PEOPLE FORGET THAT THEY HATE THEIR JOB, OR DON'T REALLY LIKE WHERE THEY ARE IN LIFE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.\" FRANK SAVAGE ORIGIN LEAD PROGRAMMER CHARAC TERS MORE THAN JUST A 'CODE COOK According to Savage, a good game programmer has to be able to do everything that an operating system such as Windows does. A programmer has to be able to talk to DOS at the most basic input-output levels and to be able to talk to every single possible hardware combination that might appear on the customer's machine. Armed with this ability, the first step in any project is to write all of the basic low-level foundation code, such as joystick routines, sound routines and file manipulation routines. \"It becomes a nightmare,\" laments Savage, \"literally a nightmare, just to lay the groundwork. \"And we (at Origin) make it easier for programTAKE ME TO YOUR CODE Fluent in C, assembly language, low-level code and Loony Tunes voices, Frank Savage straddles the netherworld of zombie hours and computer game creation. is the individual who is charged with the not-so-trivial task of understanding how all of the other programmers' code works.

We flew to the spot on the planet where we were supposed to drop, fired it, the bomb tracked itself right to the target, hit the target and just went 'pffft. Nothing happened! I had been through that code, line by line, at least three times, to make sure that it was going to work, and nothing happened. It was 3:30 in the morning. Chris Roberts was sitting in my office, and I turned to him and said in my best little Loony Tunes Martian voice: 'There was supposed to be an earthshattering kaboom.\" Within a few hours, Savage had torn apart the code once again, and to his surprise, he discovered that there was a less-than symbol on one line of code where there should have been a greater-than, and that had kept the planet from going nova. \"A programmer's social life is controlled by the piece of code that he's trying to write at that particular moment,\" he muses. \"When I worked as a consultant in Chicago, I had shitloads of money, and I spent shitloads of money.

They were always saying to me that nothing is more disgusting than that, so I used to chew coffee beans, in an attempt to show them that there is, in fact, something more disgusting than chewing tobacco. It worked. \"When I came to Origin, I found that I could not drink enough coffee fast enough to keep running, so I would eat coffee beans as fast as I could. In fact I still can't play X-Wing without eating coffee beans. During a build of STRIKE COMMANDER on one machine, I'd sit at my other machine and play XWing and pop coffee beans.

SOME SAVAGE TUNES Il good workaholics develop some rituals to help then through their day, and for Frank Savage, popping in a CD and jamIming to some good tunes is essential to his mental well-being. What he listens to depends on his mood and what he's currently working on. For cerebral programming, such as writing a high-speed texture map routine, Savage favors the eclectic sounds of Enya (he recommends all three CDs) and Lorena McKennett. For down-in-the-trenches programming and debugging, his mood becomes more fierce, and so does his taste in music with titles such as the Conan the Barbarian or Batman: Mask of the Phantasm soundtracks. Believe it or not, Savage's most cutting-edge jams come when he attempts to wrestle with work's mundane tasks such as paperwork or project planning. For those tasks, he enjoys the gristly guitar riffs of Veruca Salt or Mekong. GAME ARTISTS PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG PIXEL Great gameplay is the foundation upon which all else is built, and it is through the blended efforts of the designers, programmers and producers that gameplay comes to be. Yet equally important is how we perceive that game. Computers provide the player with two types of information: aural and visual. Like so many aspects of our daily lives, it is the visual which governs much of our interpretation. That visual element, from the user interface to the highly-polished cut scenes after a successfully completed mission, are the responsibility of the game artists. Back in the early days of computer games, designer, programmer, and artist were often one and the same. As the industry has evolved, the quality of art needed to make games appealing to the general public necessitates a professional touch. Game artists come from a wide field of experience and backgrounds, from film to programming, from fine art to sculpture to industrial design. It is the task of the artist to create a vivid and exciting portrayal of the computer game. In that way, they serve as visual interpreters, taking the design foundation of the ART DEPARTMENT PROFILE LUCASARTS LucasArts seems to have a different vibe than many game companies out there. Perhaps it's the connection to its namesake, George Lucas himself, or perhaps it's the heritage of Lucas films which have come before. Whatever the influence, LucasArts, especially the art department, feels more like it belongs in Hollywood than in Silicon Gulch. Walking into the art building, you can't help but notice the giant bat wings up on the wall, looking like some leather homage to Icarus. Below that, a chrome and Holstein-hide couch seems more for show than comfort. A few feet farther on and you notice a large laser cannon that once adorned the barge of the infamous Jabba the Hut. The atmosphere is active, yet subdued, ruled more by conversation than loud muSIC. Collette Michaud, the art director for LucasArts, occupies a cramped office in the back of the building. Hiding behind her door is a banjo, a giant potted plant and a large bottle of vodka. Every other space in her office is jam-packed with the tools of an artist of the digital age. There's a drafting table for old-style 52 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD OCTOBER 1995 "

"INSIDE GAME DESIGN \"THE ARTISTS PLAY A VERY STRONG, UPFRONT ROLE IN THE DESIGN OF THE GAME [AT LUCASARTS], FLESHING OUT THE CHARACTERS AND THE LOOK OF THE GAMES.» —COLLETTE MICHAUD, LUCASARTS ART DIRECTOR board as almost a design bible. FuLL THROTTLE, for example, was fully realized, down to the last cut scene and puzzle, before any serious work began on creating actual game elements. Once the lead artist and a game's designer work through the storyboard, the background artist-often wunderkind Peter Chan-will step in and begin sketching the background art for a project. Once the initial pencil studies are done, they are scanned in and the various animators can begin working on their own while Chan completes and colorizes the background art. \"The art process is like a bell curve,\" suggests Michaud, \"and you try to keep as few people working on a project for as long as possible, because that's when the design problems are being worked out. Once you get past that point, you really ramp it up. But Peter Chan is usually on and off pretly fast, because he works so fast.\" When artist Peter Chan first came to LucasArts, he worked on MONKEY ISLAND, drawing and painting the backgrounds in traditional media. The images were then scanned into the computer to be used by the other LUCASART'S FINEST Peter Chan, regarded by the folks at LucasArts as something of a prodigy, works up some ideas for Full Throttle.

Every inch of vertical space is plastered with sketches for MORTIMER, LucasArts' first foray into the realm of children's games. Michaud is calm and in control-a rare trait in the hectic world of deadlines and impossible schedules. In fact, during our conversation, I never heard her misspeak, pause, or mutter any of the standard verbal punctuations such as \"um\" or \"you know.\" At LucasArts, gameplay and graphics are of equal importance, \"because that's what people see,\" explains Michaud, \"that's their first impression. The artist and designer come together at the very beginning of the project, and the artists play a very strong, upfront role in the design of the game, fleshing out the characters and the look of the games.\" \"My philosophy,\" she continues, \"has been that you hire in really great artists and then turn them loose to do what they're great at.\" At LucasArts, unlike many other companies, all of the artists work in the same area, whether or not they are working on the same game (instead of working in project teams with programmers and designers, as is Origin's approach). The theory is that the artists will TRA. IN CAN THEY SEE IN THE DARK?

They soon discovered, however, that scanning just wasn't grabbing the colors properly. Gradually, Chan moved to doing all of his final art directly on the computer. \"We don't really do colors any more on paper,\" explains Michaud, \"with the computer, we can really 54 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD OCTOBER 1995 "

"INSIDE GAME DESIGN things, make them ridiculously huge.\" That observation led Green to create fantastic 3-D environments such as a machine which carves out the inside of an entire planet, and a space station which looks like a giant C-clamp around a moon. Three-dimensional art is different than two-dimensional art in that the artist must create a model of an entire object, such as a motorcycle, and not just an image of it at a particular angle. For the huge objects in REBEL 2, Green relied on his experience to know when to add details to an object (if there was going to be a close-up of a particular area, for example) or to let the detail be vague and imply massive scale (such as the Super Star-Destroyer, a spaceship over 11 kilometers long). \"We're all aspiring to do the next great thing, to make the next leap,\" says Michaud. \"We're always looking around, not just in the game industry, but in film, animation, clay animation, anything. We're constantly challenging each other. But I am worried that our art jobs will become so compartmentalized that they become assembly-line jobs. After all, we're artists. We still like to get our hands dirty.\" EXY 1152 WAT IT Las con take advantage of the bright, luminescent colors.\" FULL THROTTLE was animated on computers, with the artists working with traditional color paint programs to draw the individual frames. Since the game runs in standard VGA resolution, having any of the characters move to the back of the scene causes them to become very small and pixelated. IL Stueryone When working with an image that small, it just doesn't make sense to draw a frame on paper and scan it in. Often, artists were working with individual pixels and anti-aliasing them (blending the colors of adjacent pixels to smooth out the edges (sar YALNIM of low-res graphics). The character of Ben the biker was the creation of lead artist Larry Ahern, who drew all of the original study sketches. The animators then worked GLASSE AWAY from these sketches to create an animated Ben. Often, an animator was given a background and an action and told to simply create the animation (with Ahern always hovering nearby, making sure that Ben remained true to form). In the early stages of the project, many of the artists spent hours watching the Western classic \"The Good, The Metrap Bad, and the Ugly\" to find just the right saunter for the lantern-jawed hero. With MORTIMER, LucasArts is shifting from VGA to Super VGA resolution. In addition to making the graphics more finely detailed, the animators are CLAMP, PLEASE Richard Green used this sketch to now able to work more traditionally, drawing indiwork out his ideas on an Empire docking station for vidual frames in pencil and then scanning them the 11 kilometer long Super Star Destroyer.

It can take us, for a few hours, far away from the routine of our daily lives. But a great game isn't just a passive escape—it's a very active, invigorating form of escapism which challenges, befuddles and excites us. To create such a beast requires the efforts of many talented individuals. Since players have grown to expect more and more from our games, we have placed the burden on the developers to continue to stretch the edges of the medium. The professions we've looked at are only some of the the many talented individuals needed to bring a game from gestation to fruition. Musicians must compose the music, others must create the sound effects we hear. Writers must compose stories and dialogue. As the game wraps up, quality assurance teams must evaluate the gameplay as well as the stability of the code, and finally, when the game nears completion, someone must tell the world about it, by placing ads in magazines and making sure that magazines like CGW can review it for you. The creation of a game is a long, winding, road that's earmarked with hills, valleys, and unexpected hazards. But when the effort comes togetherwhen all of the component parts meld to form a whole it is a truly exciting moment. After all, the play's the thing.

It's easy to get caught up in the hype of reverb, chorus and 3-D audio, but what's really important for gamers in the here-and-now are these: Sound Blaster-compatible digital audio and General MIDI compatible music. THE ARENA We installed and ran each sound card in a 486DX4 system running at 100 MHz. Our sound test consisted of music from the first episode of Doom, the first episode of HERETIC (two protected-mode games that have rich digital audio and compelling musical scores), and a suite of MIDI files. Additionally, each card was set up under Windows 3.11 and whenever possible, Windows 95. All daughter cards were plugged into the SOUND BLASTER 16 VALUE EDITION. For more information on sound cards not included in this survey (i.e., the Aztech WAVERIDER, Gravis ULTRASOUND Max, Orchid SOUND WAVE 32, Creative Labs AWE-32, Roland RAP-10, Turtle Beach Tropez, MONTEREY and RIO daughter-card), please check out our December 1994 issue. anconvos.

This last item is something you want to be particularly careful about. You can get a sound card with a hardware-compatible MPU-401 MIDI interface on it, which is great for hooking up your computer to an external synthesizer or even a wavetable daughter-card. However, if your sound card claims that it is also General MIDI compatible, you should, for sanity's sake, make sure it doesn't require a large Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program to run (i.e., 20-30K).

Remember, always shoot for the easiest card to configure. The best sound card in the world, won't do you much good if you can't use it with any games, or if it's a major hassle to configure it for every new game you buy. YAMAHA XG WAVEFORCE DB50XGDC This is the stand alone version of the Sound Canvas SCD-15 daughter card. It's one of the best sounding MIDI cards we tested. ROLAND SOUND CANVAS SCC-1. (213) 685-5141. Price: $399. ROLAND The XG WAVEFORCE is a surprising product. It can hold its own in a head-to-head battle with the Roland Sound Canvas daughter card, and since taste in timbres is subjective, you may actually prefer Yamaha's offering over Roland's. We found that bass instruments came on a bit too heavy and seemed to obscure subtler sounds. (In MIDI lingo. this is referred to as a difference in the velocity of the samples). As far as gaming is concerned however, this is one great product. MPU-401 DAUGHTER CARD CONNECTOR This MPU-401 MIDI interface card from Roland features a wavetable daughter card connector.

When we first surveyed graphics cards last year, the focus was DOS, DOS, DOS. And although DOS performance is still important, the emergence of Windows 95 has given forward-thinking gamers reason to consider Windows performance as well. Last year, there were a host of 32-bit accelerators on the market. This year, we only tested 64-bit accelerators. Last year, almost all PC games were DOS VGA; if they supported 256 colors, they were low resolution (320x200 pixels). 640x480 games, for the most part, used only 16 colors. This year, there are numerous SVGA games out-640x480 with 256 colors (there are even a few games with higher resolutions). Last year, there were many different super VGA chips ATI Corporation h64 Video 3200 ATI scored a minor coup by being the first video card supported by the early beta release of the Windows 95 Game SDK (Software Development Kit), which allows game programmers to develop for all graphics accelerators using standard programming methods. This means that games can run at high resolutions with lots of colors and great performance. All of the ATI cards we tested use the ATI Mach 64 accelerator. In addition to acEATOR SION 3307 9 "

"Ain't that suite Setup was simple and went without a hitch. Documentation was sparse, but complete. This adapter is a good bet for people who want a good Windows 95 accelerator but are on a budget. STEALTH 64 VIDEO 2200XL, 2100XL (STEALTH VIDEO) The Video 2200 uses the S3 Vision 868 multimedia accelerator, which features built-in digital video acceleration. The VIDEO 2200XL, like most S3based products, posted solid, if uninspiring DOS performance. Windows performance was good. The card also passed VBETest without any warnings or failures. Installation was simple and quick, and the software utilities supplied were similar to all of Diamond's offerings. The documentation was complete, although slightly terse. Let's take a look at the benchmarking suite we used to put these video cards through their paces: 3DBench: 3-D frame rate benchmark developed by Superscape. It only runs at 320X200 and is a little out of date, but it's still widely used. Vidspeed: This benchmark simply reads from and writes to the memory on the graphics card and measures the pixel throughput. We measured bytes per millisecond and raw 32-bit reads and writes per second. Cygspeed: Cygspeed is another frame rate benchmark, probably more accurate than 3D Bench, but somewhat more finicky about the hardware it runs on. PC Bench 9.0: This is the DOS video benchmark from Ziff-Davis Benchmark Operations. It is basically a measure of throughput of the video systems, but doesn't look at frames per second or other more game-oriented features. Winbench 95: This benchmark, another from Ziff-Davis Benchmark Operations, is the standard for measuring Windows graphics performance. Winbench ran on a \"clean» Windows 3.1 installation every time. VBETest: VBETest is not a benchmark, but a compatibility test. It measures how closely a card follows the VESA VBE standard. If the test on a card generates warnings, this usually does not indicate a compatibility problem. But a failure means that there may be problems with some SVGA games. VBETest comes with UNIVBE 5.1a. Microsoft Flight Simulator Benchmarks: This series of benchmarks makes use of a special FS5 driver, FC.FSO, which converts the normal transponder display on the control panel to a frame-rate number. The scenes are \"canned\" so the test results are consistent. STEALTH 64 VIDEO 3000 SERIES (3200, 3240XL, 3400XL) The STEALTH 64 VIDEO 3240XL and 3400XL are fullfeatured cards with 2 megabytes and 4 megabytes of VRAM, respectively. They both have connectors for Diamond's Motion Video Player, an MPEG hardware accelerator that also performs video capture.

The combination of low price point and above-par performance make for a very interesting card. 9FX MOTION 771 The 9FX MOTION 771 uses the Vision 968 chip from S3.

The other odd glitch was severe pixelization during the digital video introduction of MECHWARRIOR 2, although this didn't occur during WING COMMANDER 3's video cutscenes. The Windows utilities are very nicely done. Like the other Number Nine cards, the 771 is priced a bit lower than the competition.

The Windows benchmarks were sub-par as well. Additionally, we couldn't run FLIGHT SIMULATOR 5.0A using the VESA graphics driver, although the S3 driver worked. This was a little odd, as the card passed VBETest with only a few warnings. Overall, the FAHRENHEIT 64 is an undistinguished card. FAHRENHEIT PROVIDEO 64 The PROVIDEO 64 uses the S3 Vision 968 accelerator, which incorporates the ability to accelerate digital video functions. It also has a built-in VESA Advanced Feature Connector (usually shortened to VAFC), which was originally designed to replace the standard VGA feature connector and pass data signals (like those from an MPEG digital video accelerators) at a faster rate. Unfortunately, to date, there are few peripherals that support VAFC. DOS performance for the FAHRENHEIT PRO was on par with other 968 cards, except for its inability to run FLIGHT SIMULATOR 5.0a in Super VGA mode. Orchid has acknowledged the problem and is working on a fix. Another flaw is that the card is physically long, which made it a very tight fit on our Intel motherboard. Windows performance was slightly sub-par compared to other Vision 968-based boards. 72 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD OCTOBER 1995 "

"VideoLogic Corporation VideoLogic is a British company which has, in the past, focused on digital video editing products. This legacy shows in its new line of graphics accelerators. All offer the VESA Media Channel (VMC for short), which is specifically designed to move streams of multimedia data at high speeds. GRAFIXSTAR 300 The GRAFIXSTAR 300, based on the S3 Trio64 chipset, posted the highest combined DOS scores of any S3-based card. Windows benchmarks were solid, too. This card passed VBETest with only a few warnings. It is the only Trio64 card to offer optional digital video acceleration, through an MPEG add-on card that plugs into its VESA Media Channel.

The Diamond Stealth 64 VIDEO 3420XL and 3400XL are interesting cards because of their expansive capability and bundled software THE DOS HOT-ROD The Hercules STINGRAY 64 Video and the STEALTH 64 GRAPHICS 2001 both use the ARK2000PV chip, and scored the highest set of DOS scores.

GRAFIXSTAR 500 Using the vision868 chip, the GRAFIXSTAR 500 is another low-cost multimedia accelerator. It offered solid DOS and Windows performance and passed VBE Test with but a few warnings. Unfortunately FLIGHT SIMULATOR 5.0a displayed a vertically \"squashed\" image with a lot of flicker (this was a problem with all the VideoLogic boards). All the other SVGA games worked without any noticeable aberrations. This is a nice card at a very nice price. EDITORS' CHOICE(S) The three cards we liked the best are not based on S3 chips. The Hercules Stingray 64 Video and the Diamond Graphics 2001, which scored the highest set of DOS scores, both use the ARK2000PV chip. Windows benchmarks were also reasonable, and the cost difference between these cards and the least expensive cards on the market isn't that great. We also really liked the Matrox MILLENNIUM, whose combination of speedy DOS and Windows performance, when combined with digital video acceleration and 3-D acceleration make for a compelling solution. UNIVERSAL HELP FOR THE GRAPHICS IMPAIRED In the beginning, there was VGA, and game designers saw that it was good. Unfortunately, the problem with VGA was you could have lots of colors or higher resolution, but not both. So the graphics card makers added more capability to their products. But there wasn't any standard. Thus was born VESA, the VIDEO ELECTRONICS STANDARDS ASSOCIATION. The VESA standard for Super VGA is the predominant technology used by high-resolution games like Wing COMMANDER 3, PANZER GENERAL and most others. To achieve the standard, video, card makers embed in their hardware (or supply as software) a VESA driver. Unfortunately, as many gamers have discovered, VESA drivers can be a bit buggy, and sometimes don't work at all. Enter SciTech Software of Chico, California. They are currently shipping version 5.1a of UniVBE, the Universal VESA BIOS Emulator. SciTech has made a living out of dissecting graphics chipsets and boards and has developed a tight piece of software that only takes up 8 kilobytes of upper memory. UniVBE is a 32-bit, protected mode driver that delivers some significant benefits. First, it can patch underlying bugs in a video card's VESA dri-, ver, which means graphics cards with poor VESA implementations will still be able to run Super VGA games. Second, UniVBE eliminates the internal confusion created by DOS games. Most current DOS games use 32-bit DOS extenders. Unfortunately, most VESA drivers are 16-bit. This means that the processor-a 486 or Pentium typically has to switch from protected mode (32-bit mode) to real mode (16-bit mode) every time it accesses a new portion of video memory. This can have a measurable impact on performance in animation-intensive games. UniVBE presents a single, linear 32-bit address space, which alleviates the need for the processor changing gears. All in all, UniVBE is a useful addition for any gamer's toolbox You can download the current version of UniVBE for evaluation from the VESA forum on CompuServe (Go VESA), SciTech's FTP site (ftp.scitech.com) or the Computer Gaming World Web Site (http://www.zdnet.com/-gaming). The registered version of UniVBE 5.la is $28.00; another $10.00 gets you the manual and software on GRAFIXSTAR 700 This is the high end of the GRAFIXSTAR family, using the S3 Vision 968. Oddly, although still fairly good, this card's DOS performance was the slowest of the VideoLogic family. Windows performance was good and it passed VBETest with some warnings. Like the other VideoLogic cards, FLIGHT SIMULATOR ran in SVGA mode with a lot of flicker and a vertically squashed image. THE GRAFIXSTAR 700 is priced pretty much on par with the competition. MOST IMPROVED The entire video card industry falls into this category. We were extremely impressed with the overall improvement over last year's crop of graphics adapters. The gap in performance between the slowest cards and the fastest ones was much smaller than last year. Setup, documentation and feature sets have been improved for the most part as well. If you're careful, it's really difficult to go wrong. Reaching For The Cards (905) 882-2600 ATI Diamond (800) 4-MULTIMEDIA Hercules (800) 532-0600 DECISIONS, DECISIONS Choosing the best card for your needs is a difficult proposition made even more difficult by factors like price, the importance of DOS versus Windows performance, and what kind of system you're running at home. Here's are some CGW-endorsed recommendations, broken down into different interest levels: THE \"BUDGET GOURMET\" If you're extremely budget conscious, take a look at the Number Nine GRAPHICS 330 or the VideoLogic GRAFIXSTAR 300.

Enter The 21st Century Air Combat Arena With ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS From EA and Jane's by Denny Atkin ir combat is undergoing another revolution, one that promises to change strategy and tactics at least as much as did radar, the jet engine, and the air-to-air missile. This time, though, the revolution isn't based on a single advance, but on a combination of new technologies that include stealth design, computer-aided fly-bywire control systems, and advanced thrust vectoring that lets you literally spin in the air. The planes that take advantage of these new technologies won't be entering frontline service until the early 21st Century, but Electronic Arts is offering you a spot in the cockpit just after the holidays in ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS. 78 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD  OCTOBER 1995 "

THE PLANE TRUTH The Jane's tie-in helps ensure that the flight models are accurate and the campaigns are viable, but it really comes into play in the new aircraft database. Each of the flyable aircraft is featured, with a photo album, parts list, fuselage cutaway, and views of the cockpit, engine, and control surfaces. Along with the basic descriptions of each plane found in earlier sims in this series, you'll also find detailed design and production histories. The final product is also likely to feature video segments showing each plane in flight. Particularly useful is an explanation of the special maneuvers each plane is capable of. \"Since we're modeling Keeping these planes in the air is a familiar encourse it's a much more capable combat aircraft gine-ADVANCED TACTICAL FIGHTERS (ATF) is based on The Yak-141 is really more of an experimental airthe tried-and-true sim powerplant used in EA's U.S. craft-it doesn't carry enough of a payload to do Navy Fighters and MARINE FIGHTERS.

The Lockheed F-117A Night Hawk attack plane-better known somewhat improperly as the stealth fighter-is the only one you're likely to have flown before. Also there is its larger cousin, the Northrop B-2 Spirit, which performs a similar mission but carries a much larger load. The French Dassault Rafale rounds out the crop of 1990s planes. It's a fighter in the F-16 class, but with a reduced radar cross-section. Next up are a couple of \"what-if\" jets.

"WINDOWS 95 Witows95 Widows95 WILOW.96 Witows95 \" W OW 953 Why We Think WINDOWS 95 Is Important Winslow: 95 VRLOWS 95 e were originally WINDOWS 95 skeptics. We expected Microsoft's new operating system to be merely an enhancement for business users. We figured a few game developers would take advantage of the Win-G API (Applied Program Instruction), but we fully anticipated Win 95 to be a \"ho hum\" experience for gamers. Then, we heard about a \"Manhattan Project,\" some rumors about the Game SDK (Software Developers Kit). The APIs rumored to be built into Win 95 (Direct Draw, Direct Sound, Direct 3-D) sounded fabulous. Querying our sources at Microsoft, we knew something was up when each new e-mail response was carboned higher and higher up the corporate food chain. What we had heard was true, and then some! We also heard that some major players in the industry (EA/Origin, Mindscape/SSI and Maxis to be specific) were adjusting their entire development schedules to work exclusively on native Windows 95 products. Everywhere we turned, developers and publishers were singing Win 95's praises. That was the game as far as we were concerned. You can't stop  tidal wave, even if you are a modern Luddite. That's why you're reading so much about Win 95 in every computer publication and lots of general publications, as well. No matter what you feel about Microsoft as a company, their marketing practices in general, or the past versions of Windows, 1996 will be the year we all do Windows. So, do you want to hear about it from some guy on the net or do you want to hear about it from the magazine that told you about the EGA, VGA, SVGA, 8-bit sound, 16-bit sound, General MIDI, and wavetable revolutions? Do you want to hear about it from somebody else or the editorial staff who questioned 3DO; told you the Atari ST, C-64 and Amiga were dying; and, warned you about the Siliwood convergence? We hope you want to hear it from us, because we think the Windows 95 tidal wave is extremely exciting. Let's surf it together. Willows95 MINIOWS 98 OCTOBER 1995 COMPUTER GAMING WORLD 109 "

Not only do people bleed across floors and disintegrate in screaming agony, but at one point I accidentally blew up a barrel of chemicals beside a security trooper and he burst into flames, shrieking and stumbling around the screen for a couple of seconds before falling to the ground as a blatantly fried corpse. But those of us hardened by years in the arcades will probably lind it perversely amusing. The intuitive control scheme was more effective than I expected, actually. Using the keyboard (mouse and joystick control will be in the final version), I was casily able to move my tough little Crusader in a variety of ways. In addition to the obvious forward, backward, left and right movements, it's also possible to duck, tuck and roll. By the time CRUSADER ships, there should be plenty more 1= 15 T=100D SHOWDOWN Although there are plenty of enemies, you also have some friends around-quick trigger fingers don't always pay off in CRUSADER. THE EVOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTS AND MOTION MECHANICS ith the development of CRUSADER, it appears that Origin is firmly committed to the creation of complex and realistic presentation in its SF adventure/action games. From SYSTEM SHOCK to BIOFORGE TO CRUSADER We can see a coherent policy of refining computer games to accurately simulate the way real people move, instead of worrying solely about the way the game looks and feels. In SYSTEM SHOCK (itself an evolution of the work done in the two ULTIMA UNDERWORLD titles) we saw the first real attempt to introduce subtleties of human movement into the first-person perspective game. You could crouch, crawl and lean around obstacles. Also, the world was an interactive one, with numerous screens and devices that could be fiddled around with. BIOFORGE took human movement even further, giving us the most fluid animation for human movement yet seen, quantum leaping previous \"camera-angle perspective games. And the world was even more interactive, with players being able to think more in terms of what a real person would do in order to solve problems. CRUSADER, even though it will primarily be seen as an arcade game, still pushes further into creating valid SCIfi worlds by creating crystal clear artifacts and by taking into account such things as bullet ricochets. Needless to say, it has very realistic-looking body movement. With all the talk these days of frame rates, simulators and silly VR it might be wise to keep an eye on the subtler evolution going on. Origin has gone a long way towards making computer games the truly immersive experiences that we all want them to be. animations, including a office, and he'll brief you on your next sidestep move. mission.

The deal involved Spectrum paying SimTex's price largely in Spectrum common stock. It looks like SimTex and MicroProse will be wedded and producing games for a long time to come. * WARLORDS II DELUXE has been essentially completed by SSG, but some changes in the manufacturing process have delayed its release in the United States. That means that the gears will be shifting back toward their own Bulge game, THE LAST BLITZKRIEG. In typical SSG fashion, the strength of the artificial opponent continues to grow, as do the many player options. The latest rumor is that online play will be added prior to release. * Frank Hunter, who took us down THE ROAD FROM SUMTER TO APPOMATTOX, says that progress is being made on his Napoleonic epic. The scope of the project is being narrowed, and the new working title is THE ROAD From ULM To WATERLOO (covering the years of the French Empire, 1805 to 1815). Since we're still waiting for the classic Empires in Arms to be converted to the computer by Avalon Hill, Frank's game should be a welcome treat for fans of Old Boney. * At Arsenal Publishing, TacOps for Windows is \"coming soon.\" This modern tactical combat game is a must for aficionados of this subject. Arsenal is also busy working on PANZERS EAST, RUSSIAN FRONT (1941 to 1945). The map scale is five meters per pixel (half that of TACOPs) with highly accurate terrain maps over which to campaign. This one will be released for both Macintosh and Windows users. * Congratulations to the 1994 Origins Award-winning computer games. SIMCITY 2000 won in the category of Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1994, while Doom II took the Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game award. * Many people are wondering what Spectrum HoloByte was thinking when they issued a press release announcing that GEnie would be the online home of MAGIC: THE GATHERING. This MicroProse computer conversion of the smash hit collectable trading card game is a sizzling-hot property, so people are wondering how Spectrum could \"hide\" it on one of the smaller networks. It seems that Genie's good relationship with Simutronics, who are doing the online conversion of Magic, made for an easy initial deal with the online network. What people are failing to notice is that nowhere has this agreement been described as exclusive. Gamers can expect to be building decks and trading cards on networks other than GEnie, especially considering the fact that MicroProse has laid off all the DOS programmers who were originally working on the project and brought in hot-shot Windows programmers to rework the product.

"Yamaha sounds best, whether you play here... or here. AUTT On stage or on CD, Yamaha instruments set the standard for the best sound quality. Now the Yamaha Wave Force DB50XG puts all that sound on a daughter board that snaps right on to your existing Wave Blaster connector-equipped soundcard. It doesn't require any new software or messing with switches. The DB50XG instantly and dramatically improves the sound of your games, music and multimedia presentations. The DB50XC uses exclusive Yamaha Advanced Wave Memory (AWM) technology so you're hearing actual sounds digitally stored onto 4MB of wave-ROM (that's four times the amount most other cards use). More wave-ROM means more variety and better sound quality. And these sounds are identical to the ones Yamaha puts in our highly acclaimed professional keyboards; the best sounds in the industry. GENERAL It's not just the sounds, but the superior control of M D them that sets the DB50XG apart. The new XG format takes control far beyond General MIDI (GM). And with major game developers implementing XG, you won't want to be stuck with a card that doesn't keep up with the times. The DB50XG will play all of your favorite GM compatible software.

"a godsend. Speck is the obvious choice for this role, with a high mechanic skill (99), outstanding wisdom (86) and a meager salary ($365). In addition to repairing damaged equipment, you can use a mechanic like Speck to combine items to make new, more useful objects. For example, combining a chunk of steel with a Colt .45 will create a modified Colt .45 with longer range and greater damage potential. If you can't seem to open a door with a key, lockpick or crowbar, you can usually use guns and explosives to batter your way in. On flimsy wooden doors (like those found in most of the early sectors), a few shots from a .38 at close range should do the trick.
