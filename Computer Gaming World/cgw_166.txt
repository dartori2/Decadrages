European and U.S. GamesVive la Différence! place on the game interfaces that were never implemented when the software was shoved onto the shelves. Then along came compa. nies like Bullfrog, and our percep tions of European software began to change. I'd have to say that they are very different, now.\" She smiled a pleased smile, and couldn't believe I was being so candid. I was conversing with a European software executive at a cocktail party on the French Riviera, and the set ting must have loos ened me up. \"To be honest,\" I intoned as the self-appointed Ugly American, \"we used to have a term for European software when I first came into the industry. We called it 'Eurotrash.\" I'm not sure I could have made a worse impression if I'd interrupted the elegant soireé by dropping my hors d'oeuvre on her dress shoes But let's face it, I didn't become the \"jwilson slime\" in ULTIMA ONLINE by mincing words, did I? \"Don't worry,\" the former minister in me consoled her. \"We don't call it that anymore. \"There was a good reason for calling it that in the old days,\" I said, continuing my brief history lecture. \"At that time, much European soft ware was unfinished. The shelf life in European retailers was so short that the publishers merely threw spaghet: ti on the walls to see what would stick, and the games were so tough that few gamers really finished them, anyway. We referred to run, shoot, and die-a-lot games with no real endings. And there were lots of fea. tures that were advertised and in ( We used to have a term for European software. We called it 'Eurotrash: ware they wouldn't ordinarily consider, and perhaps they will help some designers cross over into more glob. al design qualities. They are, of course, generalizations. As such, there is sure to be some debate in coming months. There appears to be a cultural dichotomy between depth and real ism. Europeans like loads of depth in their games. They like to micromanage systems, resources, characters, and units. As a result, they are very comfortable with menu-intensive screens that may go several screens deep within a given interface. U.S. gamers want ease-of-use. We want to be able to control whatever we can, but we want to get to it quickly, make an adjustment, and get out. Gamers in the U.S. and Canada seem to like realism. We really care if the adjustment on a car doesn't provide performance according to an accurate physics model. We real ly care if the sports game can be ground action very quickly after that. Canal+, the French television channel, has just introduced ALAIN PROUST'S GRAND PRIX Racing. It looks nice, but doesn't seem to have the robust set-up options of a CART PRECISION RACING or GRAND PRIX LEGENDS. Gremlin is working on a hockey title for its new Fox Sports series of games. You can bet that the league play and editing functions will not be as robust as those in NHL '98, but you may well have better control of the players. Further, Europeans tend to be more eclectic in their acceptance of art forms. They love 3D graphics like those in Cryo's GADGET PAST AS FUTURE (based on Haruhiko Shono's art concepts), Infogramme's OUTCAST (first-person action in an alternate world), Gremlin's BLADE (a first-person medieval adventure), and RUSHDOWN (3D racing in kayaks, on snowboards, and on bicycles); but they also embrace cartoon-style graphics, such as those in Infogramme's upcoming JEST (an adventure in the DISCWORLD style) or comic art as in Psygnosis SHADOW MASTER. In short, we should be happy we live in a world where we can get different games from different cultures. One thing's for sure: We don't have the term \"Eurotrash\" to kick around anymore. found myself relieved that her eyes hadn't glazed over and begun that virtual cursor scanning for someone more interesting with whom to con verse. Then she asked a number of important questions. \"What are the differences between European and U.S. games? Why don't extremely good games, such as DUNGEON KEEPER, do better in the States?\" This column is a more considered version of the answers I gave her. Perhaps the insights will encourage some U.S.gamers to try some soft tic teams. European soccer games seldom contain all of the real players and teams, yet they seem to fare as well without them. We really care if all the features of a plane are in the product or not. European gamers would prefer to spend their time planning a fictitious mission and getting into hot air-to-air and air-toMAY 1998 CGW "

Phil Rustov via the Internet MINESWEEPER MANIAC I recently started playing the games included with Windows 95, MINESWEEPER in particular, and wondered if you guys ever play those games. If you do,could you tell me your high scores? Yeah, I know those games are not surrealistic adventures that will become a part of your world,\" but still, when I see my brother's time of 71 seconds in intermediate mode, I want to kick him in the nuts, Tsung-Yen Tsai via the Internet Tsung-Yen, go get a job so you can play real games, and leave your brother's nuts alone. Not another word from you, young man. Johnny Wilson responds: Thanks for watching out for me. The truth is, \"I'm slime and I'm proud!\" Having funny digs at industry people is a proud ULTIMA tradition. Pirt Snikwal, the pirate leader in ULTIMA V WARRIORS OF DESTINY, was a slam at Trip Hawkins, founder of EA and 3DO. Hawkins didn't get upset because he recognized that to be included in any ULTIMA, regardless of whether you are a good guy or a bad guy, is a real honor. Of course, I hope this doesn't mean that Lord British has rescinded my place in the Knights of Brittania. The plaque still adorns my wall and I still consider myself a loyal retainer of his lordship-even if my publication must bespeak troubles in the land TROLLING FOR CREDIT I was once (I'm ashamed to say) a subscriber of that «pseudo\" gaming magazine \"PC Lamer\" but now I've seen the light!!

"READ.ME The Latest News From the Computer Gaming World Edited by Charlotte Panther (CPanther@zd.com) Age of Empires I OPEN THE GATE AND SALLY FORTH: Here you can ge idea of the larger building size. The portcullis can dropped on your enemies' heads. New Ages Take You From Short-swords to Gunpowder onquering kings will soon be able to extend their empires into a whole new era. Design lord Bruce Shelley is leading Ensemble Studios into the Dark Ages and beyond for AGE OF EMPIRES II. Gamers will once again rule one of 12 cultures for a thousand years, this time from the fall of Rome through the Middle Ages. Microsoft has established the trade routes again, and the merchant ships are scheduled to sail this fall. Ensemble is using the same game engine for Age II, but the scale has changed. Buildings and trees are now much larger, providing a more realistic set ting for the units. Responding to user requests, Ensemble has created gates that can crush any unit. The overall map sizes have been increased: The largest map is 300 percent larger than before and will take eight minutes for a soldier to traverse. With its larger buildings, the game appears more immersive and realistic, but units can also be \"lost\" behind walls. Neither Shelley nor the overlords at Microsoft has yet devised a satisfactory means of dealing with this problem. The unit's status bar helps identify its presence, but unselected units are, as yet, invisible behind buildings and walls. Players will rule one of 12 (possibly 13) cultures, including the Teutonic, Japanese, Byzantine, Viking, Mongol, and Celt civilizations. As in the first game, each civilization will have unique attributes, buildings, and technologies, as well as a particular combat unit based on its historical counterpart. Rulers will guide their civilizations in four new ages: the Dark Age, the Feudal Age, the Castle Age, and the beginnings of the Gunpowder Age. Ensemble is endeavoring to broaden the game's victory conditions to allow victory through economic and diplomatic means. But of course, we play the game to crush our foes, so let's dispense with the economic crap and get to the combat changes. Players will be able to create military formations, and formation facing will become a factor. Age II will reportedly have better unit Al, and it will offer four unit Al settings: aggressive, reactive, defensive, and passive. In addition, you'll be able to tell a unit to guard, patrol, scout, or follow another unit. Unit production will be made easier with the advent of unit queues and waypoints. It's obvious from these changes that Microsoft and Ensemble are trying to implement ambitious design enhancements to what is widely acclaimed as an outstanding real-time strategy game. Whether they preserve the original game's seductive accessibility remains to be seen, but we'll be sure to keep you informed as the game develops. \"Genghis Khen\" Brown icrosoft recently unveiled nine other games in development as well as a force-feedback gamepad. We covered some of these games in our March issue (OUTWARS and URBAN ASSAULT in Read Me), but we'll describe more of them, plus the new controller-and provide more details and screenshots of AGE 11-on our Web site at www. computergaming.com.

"READ.ME Quake II Finally Does DeathMatch News T he main problem with Quake II was that it lacked the multiplayer support (DM levels and co-op play) that made QUAKE such a hit. Well, id has spent the past few months creating eight original DeathMatch levels and reintroducing co-op play for QUAKE II. These levels are available for free from id's Web site at www.idsoftware. com. You can get them via patch 3.12. All retail copies of QUAKE I will now also include the new DM levels and co-op play.--Elliott \"Gunboy\" Chin >> Alter months of speculation, Electronic Arts officially announced that it has signed a worldwide license for the inter. active entertainment rights SPORTS Oh My God!

But are you ready for a free-for-all gorefest between Gene Simmons of Kiss, Kenny from Southpark, and Astroboy? This dream matchup is now possi ble with some new Quake II skins, downloadable from PlanetQuake's 02Pmp (player models pack) Web site, at www.planetquake. com/q2pmpl. QUAKE Il skins are fully animated, user created character models that you can use in addition to the standard male and female charac lers. There are many models (of varying quality available on the Web, and the PlanelQuake site reviews many of them with star ratings, so you can sort the good from the bad before you download them. To use a skin download the zip file to your hard drive, then copy the unzipped character folder into your QUAKE Il player folder (for example, C:/Quake2/baseq2/players/Kenny). When you start Quake II, go to the Multiplayer Player Setup screen and toggle through the models until you find your new character skin. Note that all players must have the skin installed on their computers in order to see it. The skin will not affect your gameplay, but it defi nitely adds some spice to a DeathMatch.

"READ.ME Flying Nightmares 2 on Hold Team Reassigned to CONFIRMED KILL Midway, Kursk, and Britain. New battles (and appropriate aircraft) will be released every month or two. The first release will feature all human players, but the sim's modular design will allow Al aircraft to be added in future revisions. In other Eidos simulations news, the company has ended its relationship with developer Simis, so the TEAM APACHE helicopter sim is currently being shopped to other publishers. -Denny Atkin CONFIRMED KILL (above) is reaping rewards from FN2's death. Also in the Works at Eidos ... ust prior to press time, Eidos announced that it has indefinitely postponed FLYING NIGHTMARES 2, and that the members of the team have been reassigned to other products. According to Producer Brian Walker, the project was experiencing delays-primarily the result of a \"problem child\" program mer on the team. Walker's efforts to have this person replaced or to bring another person in to supplement him were vetoed by two Eidos executives. Eventually Walker was able to bring Gary Stottlemeyer (FALCON 3.0, RED BARON II) onto the team. After looking at the current state of the Al code, Stottlemeyer said he would need at least six months to set up a feature. complete executable, pushing the product to a probable Christmas 1998 release. Faced with this development, Walker says Eidos execs chose to suspend the product. In the meantime, Walker received a job offer from Origin/Jane's Combat Simulations and, given his recent experiences with executive roadblocks, decided to accept. Walker stresses that his decision to leave Eidos was not based on any lack of faith in FN2 or the team. In fact, FN2 may not be completely written off. According to Eidos spokesman Gary Keith, the project has been suspended-not killed-while the company evaluates how to complete it. The shelving of FLYING NIGHTMARES 2 did give a boost to another Eidos project, the WWII sim CONFIRMED KILL. The remaining members of the FN2 team are now working on CONFIRMED KILL, and the increased manpower should finally get that long-delayed project out the door. CONFIRMED KILL, slated to begin a closed beta test on TEN at the end of March, will feature Russian, European, Pacific, and African combat theaters. The initial release will let players stage online combat set in the battles of recent trip to Eidos revealed that the company has some other interesting products brewing. Its major title for Christmas 1998 will be OMAKRON, a 3D action/adventure game in which you find yourself battling demons out to collect souls. Should you be killed, your soul will inhabit the body nearest to you when you die. You'll thus be reincarnated into one of 15 characters, including old men, old women, and even cats and dogs. While the adventure. game-style dialogue choices help define your different paths through the game, there are certain missions you must complete to succeed. Also in the works is COMMANDOS, a real time multiplayer wargame, which unlike Eidos^ upcoming RTS game, DOMINION takes an approach that's completely opposite from the traditional \"harvest, build, and attack\" real-time model.

The results of Playing Lately indicate what games readers are blowing the most time on, as opposed to the reader's overall quality ranking in the Top 100. YTH was only the beginning of a trend in 3D strategy gaming. Hot on its heels will be WARGAMES, MGM Interactive's true 3D real-time strategy game. The game is based on the popular '80s movie that starred Matthew Broderick as a young hacker genius who takes on the misguided supercomputer WOPR. WARGAMES has 3D terrain and 3D units. It is set in the near future and assumes that the threat from WOPR has not been completely eliminated. In the film, WOPR took over the U.S. military's nuclear missiles and threatened to start WWIII before Broderick's character stopped it. In the game, WWIII has already begun, and NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) forces are now battling WOPR's robotic legions. You can play as either side, NORAD or WOPR, and each side has roughly analogous units (light infantry units, for example, versus light combat drones). As NORAD, you'll command modern armor and infantry, as WOPR, you'll command hovering drones, robots, and Mechlike walkers. By virtue of the 3D terrain, WARGAMES will take advantage of lineof-sight, elevation, and terrain effects. In addition, there will be various environments and climates, such as snowy alpine areas, that will affect and be affected by units (vehicles leave tracks in the snow, for example). The 3D graphics also allow the game to offer a fully rotatable camera, much like the one in MYTH. You can also zoom in and out, although there are only two levels of zoom at this stage of development. Although I wasn't able to see all the missions, or even test out the hackers for gathering money and intelligence from enemy computers, WARGAMES still looks promising. Its 3D isn't as sophisticated as MYTH's, but WARGAMES is still only in beta stage. It should be optimized as it gets closer to MGM Interactive's 02 1998 release date.

"READ.ME News Adventure Time Adventure Gaming Continues Its Renaissance With Three Grand New Titles CGW's very own editorin-chief, Johnny Wilson, was the sole U.S. representative on the first \"Games Jury\" at Europe's recent Milia D'Or awards. After much delibera tion, the team of internation. al judges-chaired by Peter Molyneux, founder of Bullfrog Games and LionHead Studios-honored the following titles with genre-based awards: FINAL FANTASY VII (Adventure/RPG), NHL HOCKEY '98 (Sports). QUAKE 1l (Online). G.POLICE (Action), F-22 AIR DOMINANCE FIGHTER (Sim), and DUNGEON KEEPER (Strategy). Molyneux, the creator of DUNGEON KEEPER, was asked to leave the room while the Strategy discussions took place. F-22 AIR DOMINANCE FIGHTER Won Game of the Year for bringing more depth, innovation, and technical excellence to its genre than did any other product. >> Hasbro Interactive has entered into an agree. ment with Smart Games, Inc. to license and publish its line of mind-bending brainteasers, including SMART GAMES CHALLENGE #1 and CHALLENGE #2, in addition to future titles under the Smart Games brand. In related news, Hasbro is leaming up with DreamWorks Interactive to develop a CDROM title based on DreamWorks' upcoming action-adventure movie Small Soldiers. Hasbro's game will allow kids to design and customize their own action figures based upon characters from the movie. Dream. Works Interactive is also developing an action strat egy game for kids based on the film. 'fter a long slump, adventure gaming has come back swinging, thanks to the recent release of a number of quality titles, including THE CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND, BLADE RUNNER, ZORK GRAND INQUISITOR, and Tex MURPHY. OVERSEER. Following on the heels of those high-profile titles are a few adventure games with much less hype that, nevertheless, may may Of Light and Darkness-The Prophecy be worth watching for. One very promising title is OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS-THE PROPHECY, an adventure game from Interplay's Tribal Dreams division, which is also developing the upcoming STAR TREK: SECRET OF VULCAN FURY (see this month's cover story). OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS is a surreal, 3D adventure centered on that always uplifting topic: the end of the world. Set in a fantasy world, with beautiful, original graphics, the game will be a time-based race to save humanity, with 10 possible endings ranging from apocalypse to paradise. This bizarre game left us scratching our heads when we first saw it a year ago, but a recent look showed it to be shaping up in grand fashion, with more focused and understandable gameplay. Look for it as a possible sleeper hit in 1998. Also due this year is RED JACK: REVENGE OF THE BRETHREN, the latest adventure game from CyberFlix, the folks behind Dust and TITANIC: ADVENTURE OUT OF TIME. The game mixes combat with traditional puzzle-solving, as you attempt to solve a series of brutal murders. And while it's a pirate story, it promises to be a much darker, Red Jack: Revenge of the Brethren more realistic tale than LucasArts' comic MONKEY ISLAND series. The game will feature completely 3D rendered characters, with a 360-degree panning camera and much more sophisticated character animation than that of TITANIC or Dust. The technology, coupled with Cyberflix's always strong storytelling skills, makes Red Jack an intriguing entry. Finally, we took a look at CYDONIA, a cool-looking science-fiction adventure developed by Aneiva and published by DreamCatcher Interactive. This four-CD game sends you crash. landing on Mars, where you must learn the lan guage and culture of an ancient Martian civiliza tion in order to escape. The most notable fea. ture is that the Martian landscapes in the game look completely realistic. And why not-they were based on data culled from NASA. Multiple endings, voice-acting by members of the Ashland (Oregon) Shakespeare Festival, and an unabashedly hard-core sci-fi bent make this the strongest-looking sci-fi adventure in years. Watch for it this spring. Jeff Green Cydonia CGW MAY 1998 "

"READ.ME PGL Wraps Up Its First Season CHAMPIO he inaugural season of the AMD Professional Gamers' League con cluded with a two-day tourna. ment in which those favored to win did not disappoint and many of those fortunate enough to watch realized that competitive gaming could actually be compelling. The top 16 gamers of the PGL (eight players each for QUAKE and RED ALERT) met at the GameWorks entertainment center in Seattle, where they battled in a head-to-head, double elimina tion tournament for more than $65,000 in cash and prizes. After the virtual dust had settled, Thresh (aka. Dennis Fong) walked away with the top QUAKE honors and DeepBlue (a.k.a. David Margo) claimed the RED ALERT title. While Thresh's triumph was no surprise to anyone who has witnessed his amazing Quake skills-he's the guy who won John Carmack's Ferrari last year at the Red Annihilation Tournament he did not survive the event with his undefeated record intact. On the second day, Thresh suffered his first professional loss to Reptile (a.k.a. Jim Dangcil). He then fought his way up through the loser's bracket to reach the championship match; there he beat Reptile twice before claiming first place. DeepBlue, on the other hand, swept easily through the RED ALERT tournament, defeating SoLjA (a.k.a. Cuong Tran) in the final match.

"Your Best Source for the Hottest Games in Development PREVIEWS Dead Man Walking LucasArts' GRIM FANDANGO Takes Adventure Gaming to a New Dimension by Jeff Green ow do you follow up one of the greatest adventure games of the past 10 years? That's the challenge facing LucasArts in the wake of CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND, last year's comic mas terpiece that walked away with every adventure gaming award from virtually every major gaming publication, including this one. Well, the answer is GRIM FANDANGO-a stun ning game now in development, which promises to take LucasArts adventures into a whole new dimension (the third), while still providing fans the trademark laughs and puzzle-solving thrills we've come to expect. At the helm of GRIM FANDANGO is veteran LucasArts developer Tim Schafer, whose previ ous works include the classic DAY OF THE TENTACLE and FULL THROTTLE. Those familiar with these titles, however, should drop all preconcep. tions and expectations. GRIM FANDANGO is going to look, feel, and play differently than any other adventure game you've ever experienced. You want one example? How about a cast of charac ters composed entirely of the dead. DARKER FORCES GRIM FANDANGO, as first reported back in our November 1997 issue, is a crime story that mixes elements of film noir with traditional Mexican folklore. The result is a game that is both darker and more surreal than any previous LucasArts effort. The game takes place in the Land of the Dead-the first stop, according to Mexican folk Tore, of a soul when a person dies. Upon arrival, each soul must embark on a four-year journey across the Land of the Dead before coming to its final resting place. Just how difficult this journey is depends on the kind of life one has lived. For Schafer, this presented an ideal set-up for an adventure game, in which the struggle to get out of the Land of the Dead might lead a soul to commit a dangerous, desperate act. The game's main character is Manny Calavera (\"calavera\" is Spanish for \"skull\"), a hapless skeleton in the Land of the Dead, who is stuck with the job of travel agent for the Department of Death. Every morning, Manny must don his Grim Reaper outfit (kept in a closet in his office), escort his newly deceased clients to the Land of the Dead, and set them on their four-year trek. Manny's job also requires him to sell, to those who qualify, a BEFORE AND AFTER The GRIM FANDANGO design team is storyboarding virtually the entire game. Al right we see artist Peter Chan's concept art. The completely rendered result is shown above. CGW MAY 1998 "


"Genre: Adventure  ETA: 03 1998 Developer: LucasArts Publisher: LucasArts B0 TIM'S DEAD GAME alking in to Tim Schafer's office at LucasArts, one can see just how much GRIM FANDANGO has taken over his life. Scattered all around his office along with a KISS Army painting, PaRappa the Rappa alarm clock, and Welcome Back Kotter lunch box-is a giant collection of Mexican Day of the Dead art, as well as the complete scripts of noir classics like Double Indemnity and the '70s noir homage Chinatown. We took a chunk of time out of Tim's busy schedule to ask him a few questions about GRIM FANDANGO. CGW: Where did the inspiration for the game come from? Schafer: I'd been interested in the Mexican Day of the Dead ever since I took a folklore class at Berkeley. It's a really interesting holiday: The dead come back to the land of the living for one day to celebrate with loved ones. A story set in the land of the dead seemed like perfect adventure-game material to me. DONT FEAR THE REAPER Meet Manny Calavera, travel agent for the Department of Death-known as the Grim Reaper to you. Don't be scared though, Manny has big problems of his own. CGW: Where did the title come from? Schafer: Well, that's what the Day of the Dead is. A bittersweet celebration of death as a part of life. A morbid, lively dance-a grim fandango. I originally called it \"Deeds of the Dead,\" which also played off the Double Indemnity and Glengarry Glen Ross connections, but LucasArts has a rule about putting the word \"dead\" or \"death\" in game titles. Around this office, people just call it \"Tim's Dead Game.\" more efficient way—such as by rental car, boat, or train-of getting across the Land. The only way Manny himself will ever move on to his eternal rest is if he meets a certain sales quota. The trouble is, his good leads have all dried up. so, in a nod to David Mamet's modern noir drama Glengarry Glen Ross, Manny decides to steal a lead. And this is where his problems begin. GRIM FANDANGO plays out as a four-act drama over the course of four years (paralleling the four-year journey of the soul). Manny's act leads him on a dangerous collision course with the game's bad guy, Hector LeMans, who wants the stolen lead back. Manny also interacts with femme fatale Mercedes Colomar and a large orange demon by the name of Glottis, who becomes Manny's pal and confidante. The four-year timetable gives Schafer the canvas on which to really develop the characters' relationships, with fortunes and friendships rising and falling as the story progresses. The deeper story can be visibly seen in the phone-book-size script in Schafer's LucasArts office in Marin County, Schafer estimates the script to be about 7,000 lines of dialogue, compared to the roughly 2,300 lines of dialogue for FULL THROTTLE. CGW: Are you worried that some people are going to feel that you're treading on, or making fun of, an ethnic heritage in this game? Schafer: I hope not. I feel that we're treating the subject respectfully. We're not making fun of it, and we're trying to be faithful to the culture. All of the voice acting for the game's major characters, including Manny, is being performed by Latino actors and actresses. CGW: What do you say to snobby computer gamers who worry about this game being influenced by Super Mario 64. Schafer: A lot of people who make adventure games don't look outside the genreand that can lead to a real stuffy attitude. I think there's something to learn from MARIO without the game becoming a platform game. CGW: Can we expect to see any cameos in GRIM FANDANGO, like Stan from MONKEY ISLAND, or Max? Schafer: Well, you definitely won't see Max, since we aren't allowed to do that anymore (due to licensing issues). But as for other cameos? What can I say? It's a LucasArts game... CGW: Where'd you get that PaRappa the Rappa alarm clock? Schafer: A friend brought it back from Japan. Cool, isn't it? LIVING DEAD The film noir and Mexican folklore influences drive more than just the plot. They serve as the basis behind GRIM FANDANGO's boldly original look, which combines prerendered 2D backgrounds with 3D polygonal characters. The ominous, brilliantly detailed background art, archi tecture, and lighting-designed by artist Peter Chan, also CGW: Yeah. Can we have it? Schafer: No. MAY 1998 CGW "

SUPER MANNY-O Along with film noir and Mexican folklore, however, there was one other big influence on Schafer in designing GRIM FANDANGO, one that had a drastic effect on how the game is played: SUPER MARIO 64 \"When I played SUPER MARIO on the N64,\" Schafer says, \"it really changed my perspective on how things could be done in an adventure game. A 2D adventure is kind of distancing-but in Mario, you are there, you are the character.\" Schafer's experience with MARIO led him to decide for the first time to scrap the venerable SCUMM engine (the driving force behind every LucasArts adventure game for years) and create, along with lead programmer Bret Mogilefsky and other members of the team, a brand-new game engine. Gone are the \"verb ring,\" the inventory box, and even the mouse cursor. In their place is an engine that LucasArts hopes will put you more in the game. As Mogilefsky explains, \"SCUMM was ideally suited to 2D animation, but when it came time to do a 3D game, we knew we had to break away from it.\" Thus, instead of pointing to the screen and clicking to where you want Manny to go, you will now be able to drive the character in continuous motion, using, if you wish, a gamepad or an analog joystick. Instead of running your cursor all over the screen to find \"hot spots\" with which to interact, Manny's head will turn conspicuously toward any active area he approaches onscreen. ARE YOU the lead conceptual designer on JEDI KNIGHT draws primarily on '40s and '50s American cinema. (GRIM FANDANGO is, by the way, the first 16-bit-color adventure game for LucasArts.) The wild character art and animation was inspired by Mexican Day of the Dead art-as well as by Tim Burton's stop-motion animation film The Nightmare Before Christmas. All of the game's characters are 3D models with primi tive masklike skulls for heads and the kind of cartoony, bent perspective found in Burton's film. The added twist is that all of the charac ters' facial movements-including talking-are accomplished by 2D animation superimposed over the skull heads. The resulting effect is both creepy and funny, and guarantees that, if nothing else, GRIM FANDANGO will be one of the coolest, weirdest-looking adventure games we've ever seen ENOUGH? key to perform a standard adventure gaming action-such as examining or picking up an item, or talking to another character.

"PREVIEWS X-COM: INTERCEPTOR Genre: Space Sim ETA: Q2 1998 Developer. MicroProse Publisher: MicroProse X-Commander All-New X-COM Takes the Bughunt to the Stars With Space-Sim Combat by Terry Coleman hen I first saw X-COM: APOCALYPSE (the third X-COM installment) at a trade show a few years back, I asked one of the game's design team why they were creating such a bleak futuristic setting for the popular sci-fi series. He replied, \"This is really the only direction we thought the series could go.\" And when I asked him why they wouldn't instead let us play the aliens this time, he responded, \"Why would anyone want to do that?\" Well, APOCALYPSE turned out to be a decent game, but for most gamers it fell well short of the original X-COM, and it left many of us wondering from where our next fix of little green men would come. I'm sorry to have to report that the newest game in the X-COM series still won't let me portray a Sectoid captain leading unspeakable horrors against milquetoast humans in some unpronounceable hamlet in Namibia or the Australian Outback. What X-COM: INTERCEPTOR does do, however, is take the familiar mix of evil aliens, sci-fi technology, and assorted pop culture, and move it from the strategy realm to that of space sims. SAY IT AIN'T SO, XPRBL! Before you start screaming like civilians at a Muton terror attack, try taking a morale check, and think for a minute. What could be more appropriate for a game based on sci-fi B-movies than to move into the delightfully overblown world of space opera? In X-COM: INTERCEPTOR, instead of having a static X-COM turn-based screen in front of you to intercept flying saucers, you can now actually fly around and shoot down the oversized Frisbees in realtime. Better yet, you aren't confined to the Earth's atmosphere. INTERCEPTOR takes place on the galactic frontier, as humankind tries to tap outlying mineral-rich worlds to rebuild civilization after the desolation of the Alien Wars (the first two X-COMS). As you'd expect, our crafty alien enemies THE BETTER TO SEE YOU WITH The cockpit view gives you plenty of flavor, such as dangling wires and an \"1 Brake for Sectoids\" sticker, but it's hard to pass on the gorgeous open view.

But what you give up in glitz you gain in flexibility, for the missions generate in similar fashion to those in the classic X-COM. You might fly escort duty for freighters, then turn around and defend your X-COM star base against an alien strike force, only to go asteroid hopping immediately thereafter. Each game the missions generate anew, making for a lot of extra quality game time. Unlike in a typical space sim, you rarely have enough fighters to go around, especially in the early going. So, you have to take chances with numbers of intercepting fighters, as you con. stantly wonder whether that alien blip on the scanner is really a concerted attack on Earth, or just a feint? In addition to keeping your too-few interceptors up and flying, you also have to develop pilots, who are rated for accuracy, flying ability, intelligence, stamina, aggressiveness, bravery, health, and even Psionics.

Simply racing around the cosmos blasting everything in sight won't stem the tide of alien aggressors-you have to research alien technology to emerge triumphant, just as in any other X-COM game. Alien tech runs the gamut from better missiles and a dizzying array of beam weapons to better sensors, armor, and base defenses. The only difference from earlier X-COMs is that you upload data to scientists on Earth, instead of having the lab coats underfoot. And in a page right out of Galactic Quartermaster Quarterly, you have a budget to worry about. Everything costs money, and all the good things in an X.COM Commander's life, like hotshot pilots and better hyperdrive engines, cost more If all you want to do is hop into a fighter and blast things, you can--but be warned, you're missing all the fun.

Once a character has performed an action, he or she can't act again until a certain amount of time passes, as indicated by a meter. Although the turn-taking resembles that of tradi tional RPGs, it all happens in real. time, so the enemy can attack while you're deciding, rather than wait for your turn to be complete.

"PREVIEWS FINAL FANTASY VII that with all of these polygons tossed around in battle, Square is antici pating a P166 as the minimum requirement. To make the game as pleasing to the ear as it is to the eye, Square has enlisted Yamaha to help convert the sounds and music. The PlayStation has its own MIDI chip, and Square didn't want its quality music to be diluted by the FM synthesis chips found in most sound cards. With that in mind, Square asked Yamaha to develop a software synthesizer so that those with Sound Blaster 16 cards will get wavetable-quality music. And those of you who purchased Yamaha cards with the XG instrument set (general MIDI with some extras thrown in) will be rewarded with a more in-depth musical score, as all those instruments will be used. As for the control scheme, Square is disregarding the mouse (which wouldn't really work) and opting for a base keyboard configuration with WHOLE NEW WORLD FINAL FANTASY VII's graphics were justly praised as an emphasis on gamepad support.

And FINAL FANTASY will influence the future The PC port of FINAL FANTASY VII is identical to the PlayStation version of this subgenre, because if it can't succeed on the PC, it's hard to in terms of plot (despite rumors on the Internet); the main differences lie imagine what console game can. Whether or not people can throw away in technical enhancements. The most obvious difference between the PC their old-school computer RPG training and embrace this completely port and the PlayStation game is the graphics acceleration. While there new style is something to be watched when will be a software-only version (which we haven't seen), Square is using FINAL FANTASY VII finally arrives Direct3D as the foundation for its graphics enhancements; the company is also talking to chipset makers (such as 3Dfx) about optimizing the engine for specific chips. We saw the game running Direct3D on a 3Dfx board, and the difference is significant. Imagine the original PlayStation graphics, but with a much crisper look and running at a blazingly high frame rate. That's the advantage of 3D acceleration. The characters are all drawn in high resolu. tion, the backgrounds are filtered to look less pixelated, and the battle scenes include effects like smoke and translucency. And when Square turned on the frame rate counter, we saw all these effects in the midst of battle at a blistering 60-70 frames per second, dipping lower only when enacting a complex summon spell on multiple creatures.

"PREVIEWS PANZER COMMANDER Genre: Simulation ETA: 02 1998 Developer: Ultimation Publisher: SSI SSI Steppes Out PANZER COMMANDER Is a Potential Breakthrough WWII Tank Sim by Patrick Miller you have no control over support vehicles, artillery barrages, or close air support. he success of MicroProse's M1 TANK PLATOON left many armor fans hoping that a WWII tank simulation would soon follow in the tracks of that classic game. Yet in the past nine years, publishers have focused on the M1 Abrams, ignoring the huge potential of simulating other armored vehicles and conflicts during and after World War II. With the scheduled release of PANZER COMMANDER in May, however, SSI will launch a blitzkrieg into this long-neglected area. Dave Bringhurst and Troy Herre of Ultimation developed the game engine that powers PANZER COMMANDER and have working with SSI for two years to prepare the final product. From what we've seen so far, it's been well worth the wait. armies. There are approximately 10 scenarios for each nationality, plus 6 historical campaigns, each of which has 24 to 33 linear scenarios. As the commander, you can opt to coordinate your platoon's activities during combat or take control of different stations in your tank. These include the driver, gunner, and hull machine gunner. The commander has buttoned and unbuttoned views, as well as an unbut. toned binocular zoom view. \"We aren't trying to do anything other than make a fun, reasonably realistic simulation,\" says Rick Martinez of SSI, PANZER COMMANDER'S producer. While the sim does strive to immerse you in WWII tank atmosphere, it occasionally sacrifices strict adherence to accuracy and real ism for gameplay For example, players will have the choice of firing either armor piercing (AP) or high-explo sive (HE) ammunition, even though most tanks carried a wider variety of rounds. During a campaign, it's assumed that tanks will have the best AP round available for the time period in which a battle takes place. As a lowly platoon commander TREADS TURNING HEADS Graphically, PANZER COMMANDER promises to be one of the best armored-warfare simulations yet. The game features real-time 3D rendering, texture mapping, directional lighting, fog effects, and support for many popular 3D accelerators. All vehicle types are highly detailed and can be easily recognized. There are winter, summer, and desert camouflage schemes. Some vehicles feature crew.painted artwork, such as Soviet political slogans. In PANZER COMMANDER, you'll be able to drive 14 German, 11 Russian, 10 British, and 5 American vehicles (see sidebar), the game also includes numerous support vehicles (which you can't drive). You won't see infantry moving around the battlefield. Mechanized infantry is represented by half-track mounted troops. In some missions, your tank platoon will be called upon to clear out infantry strongholds, such as machine gun nests, bunkers, and antitank  Weapons. INTO THE BREECH In this game, you portray a tank platoon commander in either the German, British Russian, or American SAY GOODNIGHT A Panther turns an American light tank into a blazing wreck with one shot from its 75mm gun. The level of detail here is typical of PANZER COMMANDER's excellent 3D graphics. 84 CGW MAY 1998 "


"PANZER COMMANDER PREVIEWS Armored Fighting Vehicles at Your Command ANZER COMMANDER provides 40 German, Russian, American, and British vehicles for players to command from the beginning of the war in 1939 to its end in 1945. Although each vehicle features distinctive external characteristics, there will be only one interior for each nationality. \"We spent a great deal of time crawling around inside of tanks and photographing them,\" says Martinez. \"You'd be amazed at how similar the interiors of tanks from the same nationality look.\" In addition, there are 20 nondrivable support vehicles, including trucks, armored cars, assault guns, tank destroyers, half tracks, and weapons carriers-every bit as detailed in appearance and performance as the tanks. Martinez hinted that SSI might give players the ability to hack game files to command support vehicles as well. in the course of a campaign. To extend the game's replay value, the developers plan to include a fullfeatured scenario editor to enable players to create battles from history or hypothetical engagements. \"You will have the same power to make scenarios as the SSI design team,\" Martinez says. Terrain can be sculpted to create hills and valleys of varying grades. RED MEAT This T-34 is about to meet its maker, because the game Players have the option of setting realistically models the difficulty that WWII tanks experienced when weather, victory conditions, unit types, attempting to fire on the move. and unit behavior.

"HARDWARE CGW SCOOP nVidia Aims High This Single 2D/3D Chip Could Outperform Two 3Dfx VoodooCards by Dave Salvator and Loyd Case hip manufacturer nVidia has revealed new technology that could deliver significant breakthroughs in 3D performance and compatibility. The company showed CGWhow its upcoming RIVA TNT chip may do in 1998 what its RIVA 128 did last year Reshape much of the landscape of PC graphics. The TNT is still in the prototype phase, and we weren't able to verify nVidias claims by testing production versions, but we thought we'd report what looks to be an important development in 3D graphics. Like the RIVA 128, the TNT is a 2D/3D chip designed as a single solution for gamers. The 128 featured very fast 2D and equally impressive 3D. Though marred by two image-quality issues both of which have, by and large, been corrected--the 128 has become the 2D/3D darling of the day, finding homes in systems from Dell, Micron, and Gateway, as well as onto boards from more makers than we have room to list. The 'INT is similar to the 128 in several respects. First, it uses the brute force approach to 3D graphics performance, using 5.5 million transistors, nearly as many as are found in a Pentium II (the 128 has about 3.3 million, similar to a Pentium.) And, like the 128, the TNT is specifically designed to accelerate Microsoft's Direct3D, though the 'INT is targeted toward the upcoming DirectX 6.0. The capabilities necessary for stellar D3D performance make for a potentially stunning OpenGL part as well. And since D3D and OpenGL are the two \"run on almost any chip\" APIs of choice, there shouldn't be any compatibility issues with the TNT. So how does it work? We'll take you through the chips design and explain what it means for games and gamers. and a pixel engine that handles all the per-pixel operations. Next, each pixel processor feeds an effects processor that handles the lighting, shading, and applying of textured pixels to polygons. Also feeding into the effects processor is an 8KB texture cache. These then feed a single, constant-velocity FIFO (FirstIn, First-Out) queue, which acts as a IRON WORKS buffer between the dual rendering engines and the frame buffer. At the back end, the TNTS 128-bit memory interface is asynchronous, so local memory-SCRAM most likely running at 200MHz--can be faster than the 'TNT's own clock rate, which is currently planned to be 100MHz. Other features include a 250MHz RAMDAC for high refresh rates at high resolutions, up to 16MB of local memory, and full ACP 2x functionality including AGP texturing. For an even more detailed map of the TNT's twin-engine design, you can follow along step-by-step with the lovely and talented diagram on the next page. IF ONE IS GOOD... Perhaps the TNT's most impressive feature isn't a feature at all, but rather the architecture itself. The TNT doesn't have just one rendering engine, it has two And it's this twin-engine design that may make the TNT the chip to beat in 1998, most likely outpacing Intel's new i740 and maybe even 3Dfxs venerable Voodoo-chipset. The TNT's aggressive design goals call for a fill rate of 200Mpixels/scc with the capacity to handle up to six million triangles per second. To give you an idea how fast this is the TNT's projected fill rate is faster than two Voodoo boards connected together using 3Dfx's SLI technology. How does the 'INT plan on delivering this lofty level of performance? The TNT needs a constant stream of data to feed it, so the TNTs architects have luned the prefetch queue to the point where there's very little dead time, provided the system is feeding data to the graphics pipeline. They call this perfect prefetch.\" The prefetcher is coupled to a single 4KB vertex cache, which feeds twin processors that incorporate both a full floating-point setup engine I CAN DO THAT As for features, TNT supports per-pixel MIP mapping (terns in red are defined in the «3D Tems\" sidebar on the next page) and now supports anisotropic filtering, a method for filtering textures along one axis. The TNT will likely use this anisotropic filtering to generate trilinear MIP mapping effects, which will make for more refined texture filtering and less blurriness. Operations are now all 32-bit, including 32-bit Z-buffer, in which operations are calculated with 24-bit precision and the last eight bits are used for stencil buffering, a feature supported in both Direct3D 6.0 and OpenCL. In fact, all rendering operations are now 32-bit. Say you're running a game that operates in 16-bit color, then the dithering from 32to 16-bit color would be the final operation. On the API front, the TNT fully supports DirectX 6.0, including bump mapping, multitexturing, and stencil buffering. The TNT will also arrive with an OpenCLICD, so any games written to that API should also find a happy home on TNT. What does all this lingua techna mean in English? There are two complete rendering engines on the chip that can work in parallel. The twin rendering engine has the potential to perform faster than a Voodoowith more features. Also, nVidia claims the TNT will handle multitexture operations DirectX 6.0's most prominent new feature that speeds lighting and other texture effects-in a single pass. CGW MAY 1998 "


"3D Architecture of the RIVA TNT 3D TERMS 30 DATA VIA PCI OR AGP BUS WIN-ENGINE DESIGN This diagram shows the data flow through the TNT'S 3D rendering processor 3D data from the system bus is anticipated by the \"prefetcher,\" which tries to keep the twin rendering engines working at peak efficiency. The prefetcher is coupled to a vertex cache, which stores positions of the comers of the polygons; the vertex cache feeds parallel processors that perform full floating-point calculations and per-pixel operations. Next, each pixel processor feeds an effects processor that handles the lighting, shading, and applying of textured pixels to polygons. Also feeding into the effects processor is an 8KB texture cache. These then feed a single, constant-velocity FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue, which acts as a buffer between the dual rendering engines and the frame buffer. At the back end, the TNT's 128-bit memory interface is asynchronous, so local memory can be faster than the TNT'S own clock rate, which is planned to be 100MHz. If the finished board meets nVidia's design spec, the TNT could have a fill rate of 200Mpixels/sec with the capacity to handle up to six million triangles per second. Dual Voodoos would, by comparison, have performance numbers of 180Mpixels/sec with a polygon throughput of three million triangles per second. Demand Driven Prefetcher Scatter Gather Virtual DMA Per-Pixel MIP Mapping: A distancebased technique for keeping texture maps from distorting. Rather than keeping a single copy of a texture map, the renderer keeps several. As you get closer to an object, the rendering engine swaps in a different, higher-resolution version of the texture map. As you move away, the renderer swaps a lower-resolution texture map onto the object. Vertex Cache (Patent Pending) Advanced Floating Point Setup & Pixel Processor Advanced Floating Point Setup & Pixel Processor Lighting & Special Effects Processor Lighting & Special Effects Processor Constant Velocity FIFO Texture Cache (Patent Pending) Frame Buffer Interface 128-bit Trilinear MIPMapping: A filtering technique by which the renderer takes one pixel, its four neighboring pixels, and the four neighboring pixels from the nearest MIP map, and takes the weighted average of those color values before drawing the pixel. MI Anisotropic Filtering: An advanced filtering method that produces less texture distortion when the texture is viewed from an angle. This is the next level of filtering beyond Trilinear Filtering. GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY What's the first thing a game developer does with any new piece of hardware? Simple, throw enough work at it to try to bring to its knees. Needless to say, developers should have a lot of fun trying to make the TNT sweat. The result? Cames with higher polygon counts, more textures, multitexturing effects, and, perhaps most notably, higher resolutions (how does QUAKE II at 1024x768 grab you?). The biggest thing the TNT has going for it is the Ginsu cffect: This single chip should cut through just about anything Direct3D, OpenCL, 2D, and digital video. Given that RIVA 128 chips have found homes in most of the top-tier system makers' boxes, not to mention a bevy of board makers, the 'INI already has a foot in the door. So if the INT can provide this unprecedented level of performance, it will also most likely ship millions of units over its lifetime. This is good news for Direct3D and OpenCL, because in the INT they will most likely have a powerhouse performer. Companies that have leveraged games onto their own chips by offering proprietary APIs 3Dfx's Clicle, PowerVR SGL, and Renditions RRodlinc-may begin to see more title developers writing to Direct3D first and to their APIs second (if at all). Of course, the 3D-chip house is still pretty crowded, and other chip makers, such as Renclition, 3Dfx, 3DLabs, ATI, Videologic/NEC, Matrox, and, yes, S3, all have new silicon in the works to keep themselves competitive. In bringing the TNT to market, the crew at nVidia has laid out for themselves a daunting task. To produce the TNT, they're changing manufacturing facilities and still need to get a fab line (where chips are produced up and running. But if they succeed, and other chip makers can't deliver at least comparable performance soon after the TNT begins shipping later this year, then nViclia may be 1998s big winner. Bump Mapping: Adds a raised, 3D tactile \"texture\" to a texture map Stencil Buffering: Used for special effects, including soft and hard shadows from multiple lightsources. MAY 1998 CGW "

Also, almost no DOS games will run on Window NT, so if you have favorite DOS titles, you at least want to be able to cual boot back to Windows 95. Until we have more definitive data comparing the two operating systems, gamers should hold off upgrading to Windows NT 5. We'll test the new OS here at CCWand give you a report when we have some solid results ere at CGW, we generally recommend external modems they're much easier to configure than internal modems and don't take up a slot. However, their perfor mance can be slower than an internal modem, especially if the modem is using its own internal compression. For gameplay, you normally want to turn off compression, but for Web access and file transfers, compression is a godsend, as it speeds things up a lot. However, the good ol' PC serial port in most currentgeneration PCs is limited to 115Kbits/sec (that's kilobits). Since the modem may be decompressing incoming compressed data on the fly, it often has to pause for the serial port to catch up. In fact, compressed files coming in at 28.8Kbits/sec can sometimes reach 500Kbits/sec after decompression. USB will certainly help solve the problem in the future, but meanwhile one possible answer is a faster serial port. Luckily for us, the serial-port wizards at Pacific Commware (www.turbocom.com) offer their Turbo Express 920, which can reach a sustained transfer rate of 920Kbits! sec. If you have an external 56K or ISDN modem, then you owe it to your self to check out the Turbo Express 920. On my own 3COM Impactin external ISDN modem, I've reached file-transfer throughput of more than 10KB/sec (kilobytes per second), compared with around 8.5KB/sec before the upgrade.

"CYBERSTIK REVIEW ***** Cyberstuff Catches Some Air HARDWARE of like a Mel Gibson with a Glock 10-then it's less tiring. The CyberStiks real market may lie with portable gaming Lugging a joystick along with a laptop is a real nuisance, but the CyberStik may be just the ticket. For everyday gaming, though, its distinctive shape may be its Achilles heel. The SUICNO by Loyd Case t's not too often that a new technological innovation impresses me simply because it works, but the CyberStik did. Here's a joystick without potentiometers. It senses the movement of the axes and communicates those changes to the game port. You can sort of hold it in the air, wave it around, and the game reacts. In fact, the only moving parts are the switches themselves. You can use the CyberStik as a quasistandard controller by attaching it to the weighted base that ships with the stick. The base serves only to anchor the stick; while there is a moving pivot point, it doesn't affect the joystick signal in any way. CyberStuff suggests using the base to calibrate the stick In its base mode, the CyberStik emulates the CH Flightstick Pro. Instead of a throttle slider, there's a forward/reverse switch on the top of the stick that increases or decreases the throttle response. There's also an LED on top of the stick that indicates whether you're in digital or analog mode. The stick worked very well with several driving games I tested. Flight sims worked okay, though it's certainly not the height of verisimilitude. I didn't have much luck with 3D shooter games, though it was hard not to overshoot the target in HEAVY GEAR or JEDI KNIGHT. The CyberStik does work with rudder pedals or an analog throttle, though why you'd do that is open to question. The real bummer with the CyberStik, though, is ils shape. There were sharp edges around the front of the stick (ostensibly finger indentations), but I found them fatiguing in extended gameplay. If you hold the stick with both hands--sort APPEAL: Gamers who like big gestures; gamers on the go with laptop computers. PROS: It works; in driving and flying games, control is easy. CONS: The grip gets tiring quickly; the novel ty wears off soon. RATED *** Price: $79 Vendor: CyberStuff Richmond, VA (804) 330-5970 www.cyberstuff.com ALTEC-LANSING ADA305 SPEAKERS. REVIEW ***** Don't Touch That Dial by Dave Salvator HARDWARE or gamers, it seems the Universal Serial Bus (USB) has so far, been one of those Codot-type technologies. You know, the one that's been hyped to death, but you're left waiting, and waiting and...well, you get the idea. There have been a few gaming devices shipped using USB, with quite a few more in the works. WellAltec Lansing has come up with an interesting use of USB, and in a prelty unlikely place: speakers. We've heard some pretty tall claims about USB speakers replacing the sound card as we know it, but don't throw away that SoundBlaster just yet. Altec's 305s don't use USB to send an actual signal; rather, they let you finely control the speakers imaging and volume settings, Installation was a bit vexing. The installation CD doesn't include an INF file for Windows 95 to read when the 305s arc detected as a new device. Instead, you must cancel out of the auto-detect sequence and in the speakers setup program. On reboot, Windows 95 discovered the 305s again and used the newly installed driver. Altec's USB-GUI software lets you select three imaging modes: Stereo, Dolby Pro Logic, and Dolly AC-3 (Dolby Digital). Apparently you need to have an AC-3 encoder in the system for AC-3 to be a selectable option. The 3055 satellites each have side-firing drivers to help create phantom\" speakers when you choose Pro Logic or AC-3 mode, and the USB-CUI software lets you tweak individual volume levels, including the side-firing drivers. Curiously absent are any controls for EQ (bass/treble), aside from a subwoofer volume facer. The 305s sound quite good, with very solid bass and clean midrange and highcnd imaging. The big downside is that anytime you tweak even the volume on the 305s, you toggle out of your game, and Altecs USB applet comes up to show you the volume change you're making. If you just have to put those USB ports to good use, the 305s will fill the bill and sound terrific, provided you don't need to make any volume changes midgame. But if you like smooth gameplay during volume tweaks, the 305s are not your optimal choice. USB APPEAL: Audiophiles hell-bent to get some use out of their USB ports. PROS: Solid overall audio quality; USB controls work well. >CONS: Any volume tweak during gameplay brings the game to a screeching halt.

"***** REVIEW OUTLAW 3D Jazz Hits a High Note HARDWARE API, which some game developers have supported. We also took a look at some beta OpenCL minidrivers capable of by Loyd Case f you're looking for a full-featured 2D/3D accelerator with widespread software support and good performance, you won't have to look much further than the Jazz Outlaw 3D. It won't win awards as the fastest 2D or 3D card out there, but it AMB does the job at a surprisingly low price. We took a look at a 4MB AGP version of the Outlaw 3D, which uses Renditions V2200 accelerator, the big brother of the chip used in Diamond's Stealth II. The V2200 is not a full AGP part; it doesn't take advantage of AGP textures, nor does it support 2x sideband address ing. In reality, an AGP V2200 card is a PCI part running at 66MHz. Given those constraints, our testing revealed the Outlaw to be a solid, but not outstanding Direct3D performer. However, it does support Rendition's RRedline 3D solid, posting a score of 104, barely shy of current RIVA numbers. Overall, the Outlaw 3D looks to be a solid, low-cost 3D accelerator that would be a great complement to a Voodoo2 board. Although it doesn't support full AGP functionality, that's probably not a serious factor for another 6-12 months. At a street price of under $140, its an appealing card for those on a budget who are looking for good performance and Rendition support. |  PAGE 106 AM AN INCLS.CO SHEREHEMUITION .

"** ** REVIEW  BATTLESPIRE DIFFICULTY LEVEL Battle Weary ADVENTUREZRPG The Follow-up to DAGGERFALL May Be Too Hard for Its Own Good by Scorpia ith MORROWIND (ELDER SCROLLS 3) at least a year away, and with gamers clamoring for something of a less-epic scope than titles such as DACCERFALI, Bethesda has initiated the \"Legend\" series: shorter games based in the world of Tamriel, allied to the main plots, but separate from them. BATTLESPIRE launches this new line. The game takes place in the days when Jagar Thar was still causing trouble (circa ARENA). The Battlespire is home and training ground for Battlemages. Just before you, a novice, come for a visit, it's invaded and taken over by a Daedra prince and his minions. With no way of getting out, you can only go on, hoping for the best while expecting the worst. Much in the way of interface, gameplay, and characters will be familiar to those who have played the previous games, but don't let that mislead you. BATILESPIRE was deliberately designed to be a very tough game, and part of its difficulty comes from the fairly severe limitations placed on your character. MORE POWER TO YA The game conceives the Battlespire as being anchored in place by these massive power cylinders. # template, regardless of whether you have a Redguard, High Elf, or anything else. Racial bonuses this time around are for skills only. Another change is that no skill can rise above its controlling stat. Long Blade, for instance, is based on strength. If the character has a strength of, say, 60, the Long Blade skill cannot go higher than that, however often you use your sword. The same is true for magic and for noncombat skills such as jumping and swimming The biggest change, though, is the \"build point\" system. You receive 4,700 points for your custom character. With this, you modify hit points, stats, and skill percentages; take advantages (if you want any); and purchase magic spells and starting equipment. There is no cost to choose skills, only to increment them. The one really good thing about this system is that no template-custom or precreated is written in stone. At any time, you can start over and tinker with the template, making whatever changes you want provided, of course, you have the necessary points. Any points unused when you're done are held over. NUMBER CRUNCHING You can choose from a wide range of precreated classes or make your own from scratch. Unlike in DAGGERFALL however, the custom template is saved this time, so it can be used again with other characters. The similarity ends there. In DACCERFALL, the template established class minimums for stats (strength, agility, and so on), which were then modified by character race and clice rolls. In BATTLESPIRE, the values you set for the stats are it; no modifications of any kind occur. If, for example, you set a strength of 55 for the class, that's what it will be for every character using the TOUGH LUCK The next shocker is a big one: no character levels. None. Your character improves only by using skills or enhancing them at the end of a dungeon level, at which time you receive a set number of build points. You do automatically get more hit points, based on your endurance rating. And life doesn't get easier once you're in the spire. There are no inns or places to sleep; there isn't even a command to rest. Healing and restoring spell points must depend on what you find around the spire (or your advantages, if you took regenerate health or spell points). There are no blacksmiths to repair equipment: When something wears out, it has to be replaced by found items. There are no guilds for training, no spellmaker, no itemmaker. You are entirely dependent on what you can scrounge up as you go through the dungeons. Spells in particular are limited. You have only a small selection to choose from at the start of the game, and you need to choose wisely. Spell scrolls are rare. Their appearance and type are totally randomized; the chances of a Price: $54.99 System Requirements: Pentium 133, DOS 5.0 or greater (Win 95-compatible in DOS mode), 16MB RAM 150MB hard drive space, 4x CD-ROM, SVGA graphics, mouse; supports most major sound cards. 3D Support: None.

"REVIEW  BATTLESPIRE ADVENTURE/RPG handy, this isn't a good method to rely on for combat magic. This would have worked better had you been able to associate magic items with special keys the way you can with spells. Speaking of combat, it's real-time, \"swing the mouse to THE FIERY DEPTHS BATTLESPIRE drags you along through swing your weapon\" encounters both fiery foreign and dully domestic, type fighting, much as in DAGGERFALL. For spell scroll actually showing up are very spellcasting, you can preassign up to low. I found only four myself, and two of eight hot keys (Fl-F8) and cast spells them duplicated spells I already had. instantly at any time merely by pressing What you take at the start, therefore, is the appropriate key. In fact, you can cusabout all you will have the entire time. tomize almost the entire keyboard, as the On the other hand, there is a game uses many shortcut keys. wealth -one might almost say a pletho Since BATTLESPIRE is in the hands of ra-of magic items. They can be any invaders, you naturally expect to meet thing: potions, weapons, armor, clothing, hostile critters, and there are quite a few gems. They may have spells on them of them. The interesting part is that you that you can cast, or they may enhance a can talk to many of them. Not always, skill when equipped. Some restore hit but a fair number are willing to chat points or mana. Most of the time, the before trying to rip you open. trick is to figure out what these things Sometimes, you can pick up a little actually do. They all come with obscure information this way. Once in a while, and lengthy names like \"Iron Crossbow you may manage to get an opponent to of Sanguine turn neutral. You might even be able to Swiftblade\" or talk it into fighting on your behalf. This \"Cem of the ability to converse with opponents is one Fawn's Cleaning.\" of the game's better features. unavoidable, in a small, compact game like this, there ought to be more variety I also wasn't too happy with the design philosophy itself. While I can appreciate the desire to provide a challenge, the actual execution of the design wasn't a lot of fun. The build points for each level are the same, whether you kill all, none, or some of the monsters. In one respect, then, what you do is almost but not quite irrelcvant to your progress. Basically, the game is set up to encourage-actually force you to deal with combat situations in nontraditional ways, to simply get through the levels by any means you can devise, including running away from opponents. Building up your character, unusually, is a minor part of the game. Graphically, the game is similar to DAGCERFALL Everything looks better at a distance; up close, blockiness is often apparent, even in the high-res mode. For all that, the graphics are pretty decent; just don't expect the state-of-the-art. ENDGAME BATTLESPIRE leaves me with very mixed feelings. It has a number of good features, but the artificial character limitations, plus the emphasis on the scavenger hunt aspect, make it very trying at times. While I don't mind new approaches to RPGs, this one wasn't done as well as it could have been. Still, the series shows promise. In the meantime, BATTLESPIRE IS best-suited for players who won't mind an exceptionally tough outing. Those who prefer more traditional fare may want to skip this one. Star ratings for Scorpia-reviewed games are by CCW staff. Scorpia disavows numerical ratings for games CALL TO ARMS Using spell items, especially in combat, is a laborious procedure. First you open your inventory (the game freezes at this point), then you scroll through the items list to find the item you want (if it isn't near the top). double-click on that, exit the inventory, and finally click on your target to cast the spell. While a little spell ability can come in HUNT THIS In addition to staying alive and scrounging goodies, you have to look for special items on cach level. This is one of the most irksome aspects of the game. The first five levels aren't much more than elaborate scavenger hunts. Level 5 was the worst. This is the Wild Hunt, on an island, and you're being actively pursued by unpleasant critters, some of which can't be killed. While evading them, you must come up with six keys, six pieces of armor, and a special weapon. I almost lost patience with BATTLESPIRE right there. I don't mind a little scarching, but when the major part of a game is built around \"find this, that, and the other,\" it becomes tedious and shows a lack of creativity. Surely the design team could have come up with something less repetitious. In a huge game like DAGCEREALL, repetition may be APPEAL: Hard-core RPGers and DAGGERFALL freaks who can handle a challenge. >PROS: Less sprawling than DAGGERFALL; some interesting combat features. CONS: Almost too hard; lack of traditional character development; weak mapping; too much scavenger hunting; lessthan-stellar graphics.

"AIR WARRIOR II  REVIEW ***** DIFFICULTY LEVEL Something more SIMULATION/SPACE This Supercharged Air WARRIOR Still Sports Some Used Parts by John Nolan about, which keeps frame rates up, so there are still huge expanses of green grass in this virtual world. It's now easier to \"feel\" your altitude and avoid dragging a wingtip. In the absence of an accelerated 3D card, a software renderer handles the job: The resulting graphics are adequate, but they're basically the same as the older versions. IR WARRIOR III is the latest release of the sim that began as the granddaddy of online flight simulations and later grew a solo component. Debuting in October 1987 as the first multiplayer online flight sim (at $5 plus an hour), it continually improved and added features. In December 1992, a box release of the game added limited offline practice, which was leisurely followed in January 1997 by AIR WARRIOR II, a version with interesting offline campaigns. This latest version expands the envelope with 3D graphics, better artificial intelligence, automated online multiplayer historical scenarios, and realtime voice capability: REALITY BITES Air WARRIOR III's flight model remains essentially unchanged from preeffects, stall buffeting, and firepower lethality, but it's more of a difficulty adjustment than a realism change. The two easiest ways to start an argument are to yell«If it ain't pork, it ain't even B-B-Q\" in a Texas eatery or to tell a bunch of flight-sim addicts, \"This is (or isn't the most realistic flight model ever programmed.\" Yet at Ace level, with your feet flat on the floor, you can add full power for takcoff, put your hands in your lap, and your P-51 will docilely roll straight down the runway and gently lift off. Do not try this at home in your real Mustang! This isn't the only anomaly in the \"full realism\" flight model, but remember that this model was created when the 286 chip was king and plysics modeling was a dream.

"***** REVIEW  ANDRETTI RACING SPORTS DIFFICULTY LEVEL Wheel Life More Arcade Game Than Simulation, ANDRETTI RACING Still Offers Some Fast-paced Thrills by Scott A. May hen in doubt, stradgraphic details to high, while maintaining blazing speed. Beyond 3D effects like haze, lens flares, and textured backdrops, however, you'll also see plenty of flat, 2D objects littering the scenery. what Electronic Arts does with ANDRETT RACING, which falls somewhere between the arcade thrills of NEED FOR SPEED and the simulated realism of CART PRECISION RACING. Driving the middle of this road can be twice as dangerous, but EA pulls it off. The game marks FAs second attempt to jump-start one of its minor PC sports franchises, buoyed by success on the PlayStation and Saturn. ANDREITI is noholds-barred, thrill-a-minute arcade racing, with only a smattering of simulated realism, thankfully administered where it really counts: vehicle handling and computer Al. Drivers can choose between Iwo disparate racing styles, NASCAR or Indy, which says a lot about the depth of the game's driving model. are modeled after officially licensed world-class speedways. The rest are fantasy tracks, designed by the Andretti clan (Mario and sons Jeff and Michael) to recreate track types based on real-world courses. Likewise, only a handful of the game's 30 drivers has any connection to real-life Indy or NASCAR drivers. Prerace vehicle setup is also a bit of a joke. Compared to the best racing sims available today, the garage in ANDREIIT RACING is the digital equivalent of Jiffy Lube: fast, cheap, and very basic. Setup options are limited to automatic/manual transmissions, hard/soft tires, gear ratios, front/rear wing angles, and initial fuel loads. To make matters worse, you must reset your setups before each session. On the upside,ANDRETTI RACING is a screamer when the tires finally hit the tarmac if you have the necessary hardware. The game supports a small variety of 3D-accelerated video cards, and you'll need one if your system qualifies at the minimum required P133. On my P233 MMX, first tested without 3D video, frame rates were exceptionally high, although graphic quality suffers. With a Monster 3D, I was able to crank up the Andretti RACING SPIN CONTROL As in many arcade-style racing games, your onscreen vehicle looks and feels as if it's floating slightly above the surface. Despite this, vehicle control is above average, thanks to the relaxed physics model. I tested the game using a CH Camestick 14, CH Racing Wheel (with pedals), SideWinder Force Feedback, and even my trusty old Gravis GamePad. All four performed well, though racing wheels or analog sticks are definitely preferred. final accolades go to the computer AL Computer-controlled drivers consist of the usual assemblage of clumpsmore road-kill than road-warrior -and a ragtag team of hotshots (more often than not, the Andrettis themselves) who manage to extend a challenge at every tum. As expected, the game's best moments come during head-to-head racing via modem, serial, or LAN multiplayer connections. ANDRETT RACING won't drive away more serious competition, and there's plenty available to blow it off the road. But it's not without merits, especially for arcade-oriented drivers looking for a quick fix with plenty of eye candy.

"***** REVIEW MAGIC THE GATHERING: DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS DIFFICULTY LEVEL Counterspell Please by Tahsin Shamma STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Player ANALINK, the much-anticipated multiplayer support included in the MAGIC upgrade, DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS, has finally arrived. Unfortunately, it's most likely going to give you a bad case of mana burn The worst problem with MANALINK is the interface. I've yet to see a less intuitive, more complicated interface for any multiplayer game. Basically, the multiplayer component is split into two windows: The first is the chat room accessed through TEN; the second connects you to players for duels. This may seem simple, but awkward buttons and an illogical messaging system make chatting and setting up duels a chore. The second problem with DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS is the unimpressive selection of new cards. While it is supposed to be an expansion pack with new cards from the Legends and Dark expansions, MicroProse neglected to mention that you don't even get a third of each set. Absent are the gold-bordered \"Legends\" cards that made those expansions worthwhile in the first place. DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS has one saving grace: It's the only program that lets you play Magic over the Internet in an automatically adjudicated environment. However, if you play Magic regularly and are comfortable using chat programs like mIRC, you'll probably love APPRENTICE 32 (available free at www.planeswalker.com). APPRENTICE won't help you figure out Banding, but it does provide one of the easiest interfaces for playing Magic over the Internet. As for DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS, it delivers on its promises that is, if you can get past the awkward interface and the lack of good Legends and Dark expansion cards. INTERRUPT THIS! MANALINK's interface leaves a little friendliness to be desired APPEAL: Gamers who play Magic: The Gathering only on the PC PROS: Some new cards; multiplayer support.

"**** REVIEW  STAR TREK: THE GAME SHOW DIFFICULTY LEVEL You Don't Know Trek by Charles Ardai CLASSICS & PUZZLES use a number key to select an answer, here answers are labeled with letters. This not only means that the buttons for the five choices are not next to each other on the keyboard, but also that a player might have to move his opponent's finger off his buzz-in button to answer. In the end, ST TGS has lots of Star Trek pictures. That's the best that can be said for it 200 POINTS OBSCURE ALIENS No, we don't know who this guy is, either-all the more reason to avoid this game. TAR TREK: THE GAME SHOW (ST:TGS) is an attempt to cash in on both You DON'T KNOW JACK and the obvious cachet of the Star Trek name. Like JACK, STTCS is a take-off on television game shows, complete with a self-absorbed host (John de Lancic as The Next Generations\"Q\"), several rounds of trivia questions, and (ST:TGS's only original contribution) a pretty female \"Q\" as co-liost. ST:TGS is crammed with stills and sound effects from all the Star Trek TV series and movies. The result is a sure-fire hit, no? No. What makes JACK so popular is how funny the host and the questions are. Here, the host is just boorish. John de Lancie tries his best to infuse life into a neither entertaining nor witty script. The questions are even worse: Instead of asking funny things about Star Trek or even asking straight questions in a funny way, the game takes the cullest possible approach to the most uninteresting questions imaginable. To make matters more painful, the answer options are read out loud in a slow monotone. Guess wrong and all you get is a generic barb from Q and a robotic reading of the correct answer. In addition, ST:TGS suffers from poor interface design. Whereas in JACK players use a letter key to buzz in, but APPEAL: Only for those obsessed with owning every Star Trek prop. »PROS: Star Trek sound effects, music, and photos; John de Lancie as \"Q.\" CONS: Even Trek fans will be bored and annoyed by Q's unfunny badgering.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS Warhammer 40,000 Taking Steps Toward a FINAL LIBERATION From the Orks by Samuel Baker II Surviving the WARHAMMER Blow ven though WARHAMMER 40,000: FINAL LIBERATION is a sciencefiction game, it does a good job of stressing combined arms. Making the most of all branches of your military is the key to ultimate victory, especially when facing Ork hordes. Orks in WARHAMMER live and die by speed and big guns, but even their best units, such as the Lifta Droppa or the Kannon Speedsta, have thin armor-a weakness that can be exploited by a crafty general. Since the Orks are faster, let them bring the battle to you, but don't be passive. When you are invading Ork-controlled territory, you have only one turn to be in position before much of the Ork horde is upon you. So, use all your movement points to advance that first turn as far as is practical toward your objectives. Afterward, creep forward and maintain good fields of fire. Remember, you can move any unit one square and still fire your full allotment of shots that tum. Infantry units are great for dealing with Ork bikers, and can double as cheap antiaircraft defense. Having a full company of two heavy-weapon and two regular-infantry platoons in your regiment will go far to keep Fighta-Bommerz and Ork bikers off your back. Deploy infantry on the front line, and dig in if possible. Then place heavy weapons just behind the infantry. That way your heavy weapons will start chewing up enemy bikers and infantry, softening them up for the infantry to finish off. When deploying troops, keep platoons together and don't let the squads become separated. thèm to retreat. Ignore infantry at your peril. Always use artillery to soften up known infantry targets, suspicious trees, and buildings. Your tanks rarely die from small arms fire, but infantry can suppress your tanks and force them to retreat. Because of the way morale L works, you can multiply the dam, age you do by shooting multiple types of targets. For example, killing one tank and one bike is better than killing two tanks of the same kind. This forces morale checks on the tank platoon and the bike platoon, giving you a chance to rout more Orks. When you have to move towards Ian objective, use bounding overwatch tactics. Keep half of your forces stationary and move the others only half of their movement. The following turn, move up the troops that stayed. put during the previous turn. Repeat this process until you have reached your objective. This ensures that threequarters of your potential shots are available for opportunity fire to greet intruding Orks. Sci-fi Tread-head Heaven A good rule of thumb for heavy weapons in WARHAMMER: If it's on treads, leave it alone unless you have a rear shot; if it's on wheels, fire at the flanks and rear. You should fire at an enemy tank's front armor only as a last resort, particularly if you have any other opportunity fire available. Following are some tips on which armor to buy, and which to avoid: Leman Russ and Predator: These are the best of the regular tanks: you should shoot for two platoons of these in your regiment. The Lemans are harder to kill, but have fewer weapons and are slower. Predators are faster and have more tankkilling guns. Tank bolters are nearly useless, so I don't recommend them. Chimeras: These are worse than having no tanks at all. Their guns will tempt you into using them and their lack of armor ensures that they will die. Sell them. The infantry will do better on foot. deplios Administrator andlor d onato Todo e Orebutto Melo Custrisin b ar OF kapitalized actor Deer roolice Bhasrettin materieurs die dal Ishihaiseloupon amharcoponth Defensa lapsi Arnar place Pourrolants Potre chemical actro Epic Function T r ansparandakatografica mothers only half of thei TOO DANGEROUS TO LIVE Whenever you see the enemy's Lifta Droppa or Kannon Speedsta, kill them on sightpreferably with long-range artillery.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: UPRISING GAMER'S EDGE Five Tips to Keep You Alive GOING NATIVE Make native facilities early targets on each planet. Getting the natives out of the way prevents them from joining forces with the Imperium. out native support-forces around any Imperium citadels before your real assault. Native forces don't regenerate, so it's good to get them out of the way early. Try not to position yourself between the Imperium and the natives you're attacking; a stray laser could draw the attention of the Imperium's combined forces. Likewise, use mole torpedoes or a combination of attention-drawing tanks and withering Wraith fire to take out the turrets protecting Imperium perimeters. If you're feeling lucky, and the terrain is cooperative, you can take out a heavy turret with skillful circle-strafing (a key tactic in all combat). your enemies will quickly replace any production facilities you destroy. Besides, once the citadel is down, the other buildings are that much easier to demolish. Ignore the temptation to use bombers on the citadel; they're easily shot down, even if you've taken out the SAMs. Instead, draw citadel fire with your Wraith and send in infantry. Save the bombers to quickly eliminate production buildings after the citadel goes down. If the Imperium drops a new citadel after you've destroyed the first one, forget everything else and blast away at it. New citadels are incredibly vulnerable as long as you see that energy ribbon swirling around them. If you ignore the citadel and let it power up fully, you'll basically have to start your attack all over again. Air cover is a must in any assault, and using a few of your tanks to tie up the enemy is a good move as well. Don't bother shooting enemy infantry unless you must, and especially don't waste limited resources such as missiles on them. Instead, just run them over. With practice, you can learn to steer your massive Wraith over those squishy little infantrymen while blasting guided missiles at Imperium AAVs. Once you can drop your own citadel, do it. If you wait to mop up residual forces, odds are the Imperium will drop its own citaclel. Once the citadel is called you can place turrets and SAMs. Plunk them down right in the heat of the action (you can reposition them later) and call in reinforcements to eliminate any Imperium stragglers. When the action dies down, repair your Wraith and scout previously inaccessible terrain for secreted native forces before moving on to the next massacre. Good luck and long live the Rebellion! Don't waste valuable space 1 with extra power plants. Keep one going at a time and monitor it. When the power is depleted, sell it and build a unit producer. Build a new plant at another base. Always save your game before purchasing upgrades and additional support units. This prevents you from getting locked into a strategy that might not suit the planet you're about to attack. Don't bother with KSATS (attack satellites). They're costly, they require two power buildings at the expense of more valuable troop facilities, and they're a waste against anything other than a citadel. The Imperium can use them since they can muster the necessary heavy troop support. If you can afford that kind of extra troop support, you don't need the KSATS. In later missions, target power plants after destroying a citadel. This will keep the Imperium from launching a crippling KSAT strike against the fledgling citadel you'll set up over its remains. Upgrade AAVs and infantry 3. early, then tanks, then bombers. You'll want some guided missiles around the fourth or fifth mission. You'll also want some building-destroying weapons as soon as you can afford them; save up for the devastating antimatter disk. Taking On the Man With native forces and perimeter defenses taken care of, its time to go after those Imperium citadels. You should focus your initial attack on the citadel itself, since DEFENSIVE MANEUVERS Wait for the early enemy attacks before placing your turrets and SAMS where they can be most effective.

We might be able to blame a miss on a guided tle about the physics of bomb trajectories. Let's first examine the weapon (like an air-to-air missile), but when it comes to iron bombs we should be admitting, \"I failed to properly aim the bomb.\" Pulup Iron bombing begins by aiming the aircraft precisely at the target, then releasing the weapon. Any changes in flight attitude or airspeed between aiming the aircraft and releasing the weapon will usually cause the weapon to miss. If you're having trouble hitting targets with iron bombs, it's time to reexamine your delivery technique. A Walk in the Park Let's take some specific examples from JSF. Things become exponentially more difficult when people start shooting back. Not surprisingly, the casicst approach toward the target usually makes you an easy target for enemy air defenses. Since we're starting with the basics and want to fly an easy approach, we consequently need to attack a DIRECT HIT Don't get so absorbed in admiring your handiwork that you follow your bombs straight into the target.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: JSF GAMER'S EDGE DEATH DOT The CCIP display shows where the bomb will hit the ground. lightly defended target. Since many sims lack adequate training features, sometimes the easiest way to train for bombing is simply to attack your own airfield. It's close, it's convenient, and it won't shoot back. As with most modern combat jets, JSF fcatures a Continuously Calculated Impact Point (CCIP) mode on the Heads-Up Display (HUD). The idea behind CCIP is simple: It shows where bombs released right now will land. Simply line up the plane with the target, keep it steady, wait for the CCIP marker (also known as the death dot\") to drag across the target, and release the weapon. The CCIP marker dynamically adjusts based on your flight attitude. We determined earlier that altitude, airspeed, and flight attitude affect the bombs impact point. With the CCIP marker on the HUD, we can see exactly how these attributes influence targeting For practice, any simple mission will do. I chose the first mission of the Afghanistan campaign simply to minimize any interference by enemy fighters. Load your aircraft with 1,000 pounds of GBU-32 bombs and take off. Once airbome, press the Backspace key to select the GBU-32. Climb to 3,000 fect. The CCIP indicator appears as a circle (indicating the bomb impact point) connected to the center of the HUD by a line. Leave the throttle in afterburner and let the aircraft continue to accelerate. Notice how the impact marker moves up the screen toward the center of the HUD as the aircraft accelerates. This indicates that, since the aircraft is moving faster, the bomb will be thrown farther ahead of the current position. Now, chop the throttle and slow the aircraft. The CCIP marker moves down the screen, indicating that the slower-moving bomb will not travel as far forward before impacting the ground. When the CCIP circle begins to disappear off the screen, take note of your airspeed. I'll probably be somewhere around 330 kuols. Climb to 15,000 feet and repeat the experiment. Notice now that the CCIP marker disappears below the HUD at a much faster speed, somewhere around 530 knots. PULL UP Diving causes the CCIP impact marker to move up the HUD. The big X warns you when it's time to pull up. A Kill's A Kill ilots have a saying: A kill's a kill. In other words, it doesn't matter what you did or how you did it, if you came home and the other guy didn't, you won. One of the strangest air-to-air kills of all time came during the 1991 Gulf War. On February 14, 1991 an F-15E belonging to the 335th TFSI4th TFW spotted a hovering Iraqi helicopter. The crew released a 2,000-pound laser-guided bomb, which hit and destroyed the helicopter, scoring the 40th air-to-air kill for Coalition forces. Recalling those trigonometry courses from high school, you'll remember that at a higher altitude the terrain viewed through the HUD is considerably farther away. Therefore, the bombs must travel at a higher speed in order to cover the greater distance to that point before impacting the ground. At very high altitude, you may not be able to fly fast enough for the CCIP marker to appear on the HUD; what do you do then? Push the aircraft into a dive. As you lower the nose, the CCIP marker will reappear. Armed with this basic information, you're ready to start dropping bombs. You now know how to manipulate the CCIP marker with your airspeed and altitude. From this point it's all a matter of practice, practice, and more practice. Then, when you think you're ready for combat, go back and practice some more. Dropping iron bombs may not seem as glorious as air-to-air duels against enemy pilots, but successful bombing attacks require an incredible amount of skill and precision flying. In the age of«multirole\" and \"strike\" fighters, combat pilots absolutely must develop their bombing skills. MAY 1998 CGW "

Strive to attack the lowest of a group first, from a position HOT UNDER THE COLLAR If oil pressure starts to drop, kill the engine immediately to prevent your aircraft from turning into a flying torch. below it or on the outside of its turn so it cannot fire on you. If you get far enough out of position for the gunner to take shots at you, nosing down or easing off your turn will have the double benefit of evading the tracers and quickly taking you back into his blind spot. Heavy bombers like the Gotha G.IV and Handley-Page 0/400 have much wider gun coverage, which makes them tough to bring clown. The only safe approach is to fire from beyond the range of their withering defensive fire. Obviously, this requires good marksmanship or a lot of ammo, but it beats returning to the aerodrome in a plane riddled with bullet holes or not returning at all. Returning home safely cach day, keeping the number of landings equal to the number of takcoffs: These are the foundations for success in the sim. The war-torn skies of RED BARON II offer such a target-rich environment that your roster of victories will almost surely mount steadily but only as long as you survive. Be careful up there! SLIP-SLIDING AWAY Heavy use of sideslipping (pushing the rudder one way and banking the other) can dump airspeed very quickly when coming in hot for landing. Balloon Busting Death From Above High above the machine-guns and barbed wire, enemy fighters present the greatest menace. Heeding these tips can markedly increase your survival chances. First, always attack from above if possible. Even after the battle is joined, try to stay above the bandits and swoop down only for brief firing passes before climbing back up to your perch. Second, do not get fixated on a single target for too long, or you can almost guarantee another will appear parked on your six; cycle constantly between all nearby enemies using the padlock view. If a bandit does manage to saddle up behind you, enter a hard diving turn-pulling up into a climb is like asking to be perforated. Try to aim for a target's wings whenever possible. By degrading its maneuverability in this way, you not only reduce its threat potential, you make it more vulnerable to further attacks. And if you're lucky, the damage may eventually cause it to crash on its own. espite their inherent dangers, balloon attack missions should be among the most straightforward. You just have to fly to the target area, dive down and blow up the balloon, then run like hell from the vicious return fire and defending fighters, right? In RED BARON II, it's not that simple. Spotting the balloon can be the hardest part. They're easy to see against a sky background, which is an argument for approaching at or below its altitude (around 3,500 feet). However, this puts you In range of the gasbag's formidable airdefense umbrella for much longer than does a diving attack. Diving also gives you a valuable speed boost on egress if any bandits have latched onto your tail. If you start your dive but can't find the target, try padlocking onto the location below it using the \"L\" key (padlock nearest landmark). Point directly at it, then trace your line of sight directly upward. Somewhere on that imaginary line lies the balloon. Although it's tempting to run for home as soon as you have popped the balloon, doing so will usually result in heavy casualties among your wingmen, who seem to enjoy attacking the ground targets below. If you wish to save them from their folly (though at great personal risk), knock out all nearby machine-gun emplacements as quickly as possible. This is easy if the guns are firing at your wingmen, but extraordinarily perilous when the bull's-eye is on you. Try to time your attacks to come between bursts in the latter case. Suppressing machine-guns may be nasty work, but consider the alternative: Having to explain to an angry CO why you always return from balloon busting missions by yourself. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE When landing in the proper nose-high attitude, judging your height above ground is often easier if you shift your view to one side. MAY 1998 CGW "

Maps of The Edge and The l'rag Pipe are included in these pages; the other six new maps can be found on our Web site (www.computergaming.com) and on next months CG-ROM. Choose Your Weapon As in Doom and QUAKE, the biggest gun is not always the best. Inflict maximum mayhem by choosing your weapon wisely before a battle the delay in swapping guns may mean your last gasp. Blaster: As we all know, it sucks. Shotguns: The shotguns deliver their lethal load of buckshot instantaneously. The super shotgun John Carmacks weapon of choice--sends twice the wallop, and is quite deadly point-blank. Also, shotguns are good Quad weapons because there is no danger of blow ing yourself up in a close firefight. Machine Gun: The machine gun punctures targets immediately as well. The machine gun's recoil will spoil the players aim in solo play, but not in DeathMatch. Chain Gun: Like a real-life CE M134 \"Vulcan» mini-gun, the chain gun requires time lo spool the barrels to speed. The chain gun-id artist Kevin Cloud's favorite toy -is fearsome in close quarters where the target has little opportunity to evade, but it consumes voracious amounts of ammo. When you know where your target is, start shooting before you see him, so that by the time you make contact, your gun is at full speed. Grenades: Whether tossed by hand or with a launcher, grenades are handy for discouraging pursult or checking around corners. Rocket Launcher: The rocket launcher remains an explosive favorite for many players, including id game designers Tim Willits, American McGee, and Paul Jacqueys. The key is to chip away at your opponents' health with blast damage: Shoot at their feet. Note that rockets are actually easy to dodge due to their relatively slow speed and visible trail. Hyper Blaster: Many think of the hyper blaster as the reincarnation of Doom's plasma rifle or QUAKE's super nail-gun. It shoots blasterlike bolts, but at a much higher cyclic rate. Like the chain gun, the hyper blaster needs time to spool up and spool down. Regardless, its firepower means hell at close to mid-range. Rail Gun: QUAKE II's rail gun hurls a slug, à la Eraser, at a tremendous velocity, ripping through enemies with ease. Despite its lethality, the long reload time makes the rail gun challenging to use in a melee, unless you have steely nerves and inhuman aim. If you must use it at short range, remember to wait! Barring point-blank shots from the super shotgun, you can withstand some fire and take the time to aim. Still, most mortals find the rail gun best for long range sniping.

ARENA OF DEATH This is the large open arena from The Edge, one of the levels in id's DeathMatch Pack. We've included a map of this level on page 220. Pull the trigger, and after a moment of charging up, a massive ball of green death is unleashed with violent recoil.

If your shot is properly timed, you'll gain line-of-sight the instant the BFG blasts the sucker into oblivion. The BFG's shafts of green light are also useful for tracking adversaries hidden from your view. Instant Rocket-Jumping Tactics Last month, we offered some tactics for ruling at DeathMatch. Here is somcthing we left out: the art of ladder kills. Once you get comfortable navigating ladders, try \"hanging\" partway up or down a ladder. Many players won't expect to find you there, and that moment of surprise will give you the drop on them. You can also use even the narrowest of ledges and lips to help you \"stick\" to walls. Again, this allows you to gain vantage points where others won't expect to find you. Some of our favorite spots include door frames and the far side of openings behind ladders. When chasing people on ladders, look up (or down, as the case may be) and run. This allows you to shoot at your target while climbing.

There's no resting time around; race has no effect on stats. Co in this game, anyway. The one drawback is only by skill adds when choosing a race. he spells you choose at the start of the game are likely to be almost the only ones you have. Spell scrolls are very rare; their chance of appearing as random items is low (about 10 percent), and there are no \"fixed\" spell scrolls at all. Further, you won't be able to choose any new spells as you go through the spire. The build points you receive between levels can be used only to Increase skills and stats. The only sure way to have the spells you want is to take them at the start when the character is created. Dispel Magic is almost indispensable. On level 2, the Spider Daedra casts Poison (a continuous damage spell). On levels 6 and 7, you will be up against Daedra Lords and Counts, who cast Continuous Damage spels, in multiples. Without Dispel Magic, you'll be going through healing potions and items quite rapidly, as these guys have a lot of mana. Cure Health is the basic healing spell, and everyone can benefit from having this one. Etherealize can get you through many nasty situations. While ethereal, you can run past monsters and take no damage from either blows or spells. This will be very handy on Level 7. Monster Summoning calls in a \"friend\" to help in desperate situations. It gives your opponents another target, and your summoned monster also fights for you. Teleport can get you out of bad situations (like drowning), and make some travel easier. Spell Reflection and Resistance are handy, and become more so on the YOU RANG? Casting the Monster Summoning spell will bring forth this guy, who will help you out in desperate times.

"TIPS! Strategy/Wargames CLOSE COMBAT 2 When playing the Allied side, using your paratroops to take bridges before the Germans can demolish them is crucial to early success in the campaign games. Here are a few tips toward that end: LORDS OF MAGIC There are eight religious in LORDS, each associated with a separate race: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Chaos, Order, Life, and Death. The trick is always to combine your race with others as quickly as possible. So, if you are the Life-worshipping elves, you really want to conquer the Dwarves, or ally yourself with them as soon SON BRIDGE If you've got only five seconds when you reach the Son Bridge, you've used too much time to take Son Town. You have to secure the town in the first assault and choose to wait only one hour. Otherwise the Germans at the Son Bridge will be prepared to blow it as soon as you show up. as you can. Even if you hold no dwarfish towns or temples, a good relationship with the Dwarfish leader will allow an Elven hero to trade for all the infantry she needs. Similarly, if you are a Fire worshiper, you will need the help of Order or Life missile troops, and you could well use some Dwarfish infantry to boot. The dwarves have great armor and high hitpoints, which means they can take a lot of damage while the rest of your army moves into position, fires missiles or magic spells, or just generally hangs around watching.

Take a reconnaissance team or two to the entrance. Use the Vickers machine gun and smoke to make sure you can take the entrance. Have all the other teams fire on any German team that opens up. Next, sncak your recon team down the bridge Use a rifle team to grab the approach from underneath. Your recon team won't make it to the rail bridge objective before the Germans can blow it, but with the first two objectives controlled, it will buy you an extra minute of time.

As in real estate, only three things really matter when picking a ball club: location, location, and location. So, even though you may be a dyed-in-the-wool Brewers fan, be wamed that the chances of building the Milwaukce club into a perennial contender are hampered by the city's small, fickle fan base. For the best results, select a large market team with loyal fans that have a high per-capita income. Such clubs will provide you with plenty of cash in the early years to begin building your dynasty. Some recommended teams that fit the winning profile include the Orioles, Braves, Dodgers, Yankees, Cubs, and Write Sox. At the other end of the cash spectrum, avoid the Reels, As, Royals. Pirates, Tigers, Mariners, and Brewers, umless you believe that poverty builds character. While on-fiekl success and intelligent marketing can gradually change fan loyalty, this may take a decade or more. Fieldinga winning team is a great way to increase profits, though. In MOGUI, a consistently last-place team will sell about 50 percent fewer tickets than a 500 ball club, while a perennial world champion will sell alsout 70 percent more than an average team.-Dennis McCauley TONY LARUSSA 3, TONY 4, AND OLD TIME BASEBALL QAMCOPO We at CGW have always liked Nick Keren's baseball utilities, and Nick's Web site has recently garnered a GameSpot HotSpot Award, along with a Tony LaRussa's Tournment of Champions des Ignation.

"MARTIN CIRULIS whatchwor, ME man? What's the Deal with... Brains vs. Beauty tank game that was worthy of the word sim, you went with M-1 TANK PLATOON and used your imagination with the giant polygons. If, instead, you needed a good looking battle field, you cracked open a Novalogic game and threw reality to the wind. And it's not just sims that created this little schism; strategy games their faith in an ugly game without even bothering to examine just how well it plays. At some point in the past, discounting the odd exception both good and bad, I think this whole \"Looks great/Less filling\" rule was true, simply due to how much effort it took to pull good graphics out of those older machines and cards. Let's face it, if you could make some thing look even vaguely realistic or interesting in VGA, you were either a genius or you just didn't have an awful lot of time left over to actually flesh out a game. o I'm sitting down at the ol' monster gaming rig the other day, booting up a copy of G POLICE, and while all those incredible graphics washed over me the only thing that came to mind was, \"Wow, a game that looks this great is really gonna suck.\" And while the game turned out to be not too bad, let's face it: We aren't exactly talkin' about the Macbeth of sci-fi sims here. But the real issue isn't G-POLICEreally-but, rather, why that thought came so easily to mind. What dark forces of computer gaming have conditioned me so thoroughly that my knee jerk reaction is \"Great graphics = Silly, crude gameplay.\" To be fair, part of it was due to the fact that I was playing a Psygnosis game. Psygnosis is a company that has proven time and again that it is the Farrah Fawcett of the industry. If the game had turned out to be deep and complex, I would have stuck my head out the window to see how many of the other Six Seals had been broken. Deeper than this, though, is that |--and probably most of you old. timers out there as well have been taught time and again that a game can have either Brains or Beauty, but not both. In the past, if you wanted a (6 Gamers must stop accepting that a game can either look real or be real, but not both. story from another cool figurine game. There's just no reason why we can't have a WWII tactical game that looks as good as TOTAL ANNIHILATION but runs the numbers as well as STEEL PANTHERS does All we have to do is stop falling for the old gag. Stop accepting that a game can either look real or be real, but not both. And in case you don't believe me, I suggest you take a gan. der at LONGBOW 2. Now there's a sim that shows that you can craft a nasty piece of reality and still have the time to paint a pretty picture A buddy of mine used to have the annoying habit of taking the wind out of your sails every time you were try. ing to show off your computer with a looker game such as MAGIC CARPET or WING COMMANDER. He would just nod appreciatively, scratch his great spherical head a bit, and say, \"Boy this sure will look great in a few years, huh?\" Well, recently he came to me and pronounced that \"a few years\" had finally arrived and I had to agree that computer games were finally starting to resemble those arcade fantasies that we used to have after a long day of BATTLEZONE OR STAR WARS. The future is now, and I just hope developers can leave behind the preconceptions of the past and realize that it is well within their power to give us beauty with our brains, and vice versa. BUT TIMES CHANGE Today, however, not only are the chips much more powerful, but the new graphic software gives program mers the ability to create and manip ulate incredibly realistic images in far less time. Yet, despite this, we gamers still let developers hand us that eitheror choice when it ain't necessarily so anymore. The technology has grown so much more powerful and efficient that we should no longer take for granted that having a battlefield of dozens of discrete, detailed, moving, 3D objects means there was no time to make G POLICE a deep game. Or that we have to accept the barren, empty worlds of HEAVY GEAR just because the game managed to incor: porate the weapons table and back embrace it wholeheartedly. Again, the dim days of computer gaming show how everything begins with a grain of truth. TIGERS ON THE PROWL looked like dogmeat, but what COMMAND AND CONQUER fan could claim that C&C was taking air temperature into account for calculating cannon range?
