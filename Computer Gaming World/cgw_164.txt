Indeed, there isn't anywhere near enough room on this page to list the travesties engendered by Advanced Dungeons & Dragons products (once SSI quit publishing the successful \"gold box\" series) Yet, licenses can be invaluable. When LucasArts quit licensing its hit film properties to third parties and starting producing games based on its own Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies, the compa ny became an industry leader almost overnight. Activision cruised harles Ardai once slammed a new offering from a now defunct publish. er by stating that it had more licenses to kill than James Bond. The com ment was appropriate. At that time, the prevailing wisdom in the industry was that anyone could sell any. thing if it had the right license. Many times, those licenses were totally wasted, as the familiar char acters from popular books, comics movies, or television were pasted atop unimaginative games as though they were paper dolls. Remember Capstone's HOME ALONE and HOMEY D. CLOWN? What about Acclaim's JUDGE DREDD? It was even worse than the movie. And who could forget the inimitable incompetence of Paragon's CAPTAIN AMERICA AND SPIDERMAN VERSUS DOCTOR DOOM? Fortunately, most of those publishers have learned their lessons. Another popular publisher ploy is to license a popular boardgame or role-playing game and convertit to the computer. Unfortunately, such projects often involve produc ers who care nothing about the existing property and are determined to put their \"vision\" on the computer game, even if it guts the spirit of the original product. Certainly, such was the case in Paragon's MEGATRAVELLER I, Mindscape's first Warhammer 40k offering (a game so terrible it was ( Licensing isn't a magic bullet to fix mediocre | properties. 72 almost 15 years ago. Yet, BLADE RUNNER is, at press time, proving to be one of the best sellers of the year. EA Sports proved that celebri ty licenses didn't have to be just a gimmick when it gained access to John Madden's old Oakland Raiders playbook for the original JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL. The compa. ny also received plenty of consulta tion with Earl Weaver for the original EARL WEAVER BASEBALL. If you want counterexamples, compare the limited success of Sierra's EARTHSIEGE series with the MECHWARRIOR 2 franchise, and don't forget the graveyard of unli censed sports games that tried to take on EA Sports. What then, makes licenses work? Brian Fargo, CEO of Interplay Productions, once lined out what I believe is the essential success formula. \"For me to license a property.\" stated the exec, \"it has to offer a rich enough universe that I would enjoy adven turing in it myself.\" Unfortunately for Fargo and Interplay, that state ment was made to illustrate why Fargo had just signed a licensing agreement to produce a game based on Kevin Costner's expen. sive flop, Waterworld. It is also unfortunate that interplay opted to merely jump on the realtime band wagon and take the rich universe behind Waterworld's background story just to use it in a \"Me, too!\" product. If the producer of the game had held to Fargo's vision and enabled gamers to really experience the unique world behind the movie, it might have succeededin spite of the brand liability in the film's title. Why do we, as gamers, want to experience games based on other properties? It is simply because we want to experience more of the universe and characters that we enjoyed in the original property. If the producers and designers of the games negate the atmosphere of the original products or put characters in situations that seem preposterous to us, they've done significant damage to our potential enjoy. ment of the game. However, if they stay consistent with the universe and give us an experience true to the feel of the original property, we will reward them with the praise that counts-continued purchasing over a full product line. Licensing is not a magic bullet to fix mediocre (or worse) proper ties, but it is an important tool in shaping the kinds of interactive worlds in which gamers will want to play. Licenses can be the differ ence between soulless products and soulful products, but they have to be respected. from bankruptcy to success with the MECHWARRIOR 2 series as its flagship. When FASA decided to take its property back, Activision wisely found a similar license in Dream Pod 9's HEAVY GEAR. The new series hasn't started out on quite as high a note as the MECHWARRIOR 2 franchise, but it has a rich game universe and tons of potential. Westwood Studios took a terrific risk when it licensed the title from a science-fiction film that came out MARCH 1998 CGW "

WING COMMANDER: CROTCHETY Did anyone else notice that the mothership in the WING COMMANDER: PROPHECY ad on the back cover of the December issue looks like a large pair of gray pants over a pair of purple shoes? And just what is that control tower supposed to be? Looks more like a fathership to me. Matt Slattery via the Internet Thanks for helping us see this ship in a whole new light Evidently. Origin desperately wants the game to have legs. DAY SUE 500 Packed Pages UGE Buyer's Guide PCB Power FORTUNE SMELLING As a longtime CGW subscriber, I felt the need to write when I read Martin Cirulis column about \"Fortune Telling\" (CGW#162, p. 372). In the article, Mr. Cirulis points to the \"sneak preview\" aspect of this and other game mags and ties this in with reviews. Essentially what he is saying is that we, as gamers, have made it nearly impossible to give a blockbuster game like STARCRAFT a fair review since we are so hungry for information and it has been previewed\" so many times already What I think he is ignoring is something he has long railed about: reviewer integrity. He states, \"The pressure on any critic is simply to rubber stamp all that has been said.\" Huh?! Forgive my ignorance here but why are favorable previews (of a product not completed) such a pressure to bias a review? No matter how many good previews a product has gotten, if the final working game stinks, shouldn't a reviewer say so? If STARCRAFT (for example) is a turkey, is Mr. Cirulis going to give it four or five stars just because the «previews\" have? That's how the article reads to me, as if he were trying to explain \"Sorry guys, I was a fair and honest reviewer until large sums of money became involved.\" Is he not, by saying and implying such things, proving the accusation that many gamers have held for a long time, that reviewers rate games based on the amount of money (in advertisements mainly) the magazine makes? It reads that way to me. I completely agree with him that we, the gaming public are far too hot for previews and generally for any news of a highly anticipated title and I do think your magazine (and the others) are giving us exactly what we want. However, when he puts the fault for the trend toward prerevicws on us, I take great offense. We are not in any way forcing the magazines to say anything about an upcoming title other than to simply show us a few screenshots and give us some basic data on what features the game will have. It is the publication and all those who comment on neat\" or \"cool\" soon-to-be-released titles that drive this trend toward prereviews. I, for onc, don't want or need someone to tell me how great a game is before it's in my hands. I read your previews with interest but I would never base my buying decision on an incomplete product. I think most gamers feel the same. The bottom line is that we simply don't trust the previews when it comes to buying decisions precisely because of the trend he talks about wherein previewers essentially \"review\" the game before it's done. Anyone remember OUTPOST? CGW and most of the other magazines gave this game top marks in their previews and yet the finished product was a dog (to say the least). What it sounds like to me is that Mr. Cirulis is trying to shift blame from his (and his professions) mistakes to the readers, which is reprehensible. My advice to both Mr. Cirulis and to the gaming publications in general is this: Clean up your previews!

I took a trip to see the folks at Microsoft recently and found the company's games division hard at work on several titles that are scheduled to ship in the coming months.

STARCRAFT wasn't ready to ship for the party, but that didn't stop Blizzard from showing its real-time game at the Wizards of the Coast entertainment center in Seattle. Although the single player component wasn't on display, Blizzard did demonstrate STARCRAFT's multiplayer combat on battle.net, with great results. Each alien race proved itself to be unique and full of surprises. While Blizzard had seemed optimistic about meeting its intended end-of-year 1997 release date, some minor tweaks in unit path-finding and Al were apparently needed. Blizzard admitted as much when, shortly after the party, it an. nounced that the release Dragoon date had been pushed to the end of January 1998.

Thierry Nguyen Near-Total Annihilation? GT Interactive/MicroProse Merger Falls Flat hile U.S.gamers have slim pickings on space sims that put you in anything big. ger than a fighter (only BATTLECRUISER 3000 and STARFLEET ACADEMY come to mind). gamers in Europe have the fortune to be playing WAR. This sleeper space sim places you in command of a 150meter corvette on the side of the Commonwealth, warring against the Independents, a faction of rebels that wants to establish its own government. The sim is being hailed for its extremely realistic flight model, which models mass, inertia, acceleration, and other physics concepts that are often glossed over in space sims. T-WAR was developed by Particle Systems, and distributed throughout Europe by Infogrames. Although negotiations were still in progress at press time, indications suggest that Activision will pick up the title for the U.S. release. Slated for first quarter '98, the U.S. version will include some extra features, namely multiplayer capability and 3Dfx-acceleration (although the game already looks phenomenal in software). Gamers in Europe are raving about I-WAR's complexity of gameplay, realistic flight model, and awesome graphics-it looks as if WING COMMANDER: PROPHECY may have veryone on Wall Street seems to have an opinion about the \"annulled marriage of MicroProse and GT Interactive. But when we cut through all the spin doctoring, CGW found that the merger broke off due to a fundamental difference: how each company writes off its research and development costs. MicroProse uses the more typical approach for game publishers. For example, when ULTIMATE Civ Il ships this summer, MicroProse will pay the developer, and write off those fees that quarter-taking the revenue \"hit\" immediately. In a similar situation, GT, on the other hand, will amortize the developer fees over a longer period of time. The GT approach can put a better bottom line on paper in the short run, but if, say, more than a single product's sales are below expectations, the company could feasibly show huge losses down the line. This is not the first time such accounting differences have been divisive among game publishers. Forbes magazine once wrote that Sierra was playing \"adventure games\" with its books for writing off debts using the entertainment industry method that GT uses. Sierra changed its accounting procedure several years ago. In the end, the two companies could not come to a compromise between the two methods, and a split ensued. In the long term, the non-merger may end up benefiting MicroProse more than GT. We'll know for sure once FALCON 4.0 ships. --Terry Coleman Short takes on games and hardware released just prior to press time.

"READ.ME READ.ME Talonsoft Signs Hallof-Famer Gary Grigsby 3198 5/98 But the Famed Designer Also Inks New SSI Deal ary Grigsby is one of the few game designers whose career spans the entire history of the industry. It's 3198 been a real adjustment for someone who witnessed the advent of CGA graphics to adjust to Windows 95 and Internet gaming, but the suc. cess of his recent designs, such as the STEEL PANTHERS series, shows that Grigsby still has a few surprises hidden away in the old hexgrid. In fact, Grigsby is very much in demand. Just after TalonSoft announced that Grigsby had signed a deal for BATTLE OF BRITAIN 1941 (scheduled for an August 1998 release)-a strate gic-level air game similar to Grigsby's venerable USAF on the Apple. CGW discovered that Grigsby has also been contract ed to do STEEL PANTHERS IV for SSI (to be released in 1999). Grisgby's co designer for both games will again be Keith Brors, with whom Gary has enjoyed success since STEEL PANTHERS (and who often doesn't get the respect that he deserves). That Grigsby and Brors are designing games for both TalonSoft and SSI is a sign that the competition between the two main wargame publishers is heating up. Of course, if these games are anywhere near the quality of CGWS 1995 Wargame of the Year, STEEL PANTHERS, OR CGW Hall-of-Famer KAMPFGRUPPE, it's gamers who stand to benefit the most.-Terry Coleman PIPEINE Aces: X-Fighters Sierra Fall 98 Air Warrior III Kesmaill-Magic 3/98 Asheron's Call Turbine Microsoft Summer 98 Baldur's Gate Interplay 4/98 Battle of Britain 1941 Talonsolt 8/98 Battlezone Activision Summer 98 Creatures II Mindscape 11/98 Daikatana lon Storm/Eidos Deep Six Virgin Spring 98 Descent Freespace Interplay Duke Nukem Forever Apogee/3D Realms 6198 Earthslege 3 Sierra 4198 Earthworm Jim 3 Interplay 6/98 European Air War MicroProse 5/98 Falcon 4.0 MicroProse 3/98 Fighter Duel 2 Ocean Spring 98 Final Fantasy VII Squaresoft 4/98 Freedom in the Galaxy Avalon Hill 10/98 Gualdalcanal Avalon Hill Summer 98 Guardians: Agents of Justice MicroProse 4/98 Half-Life Valve/Sierra 3/98 Hardball 6 Accolade 3/98 IF-A-18 Interactive Magic 4/98 IA-10 Warthog Interactive Magic Fall 98 Interstate '77 Activision 3/98 iPanzer 44 Interactive Magic Jagged Alliance Il Sit-Tech 4198 Jane's F-15 Jane's!

COLD JUST IN Discovery Channel Multimedia, (800) 780-6044 http://multimedia.discovery.com PC CD-ROM THIS COLD EVOLUTION When the booklet that comes with a game is both more enter taining and more educational than the product it supports, there's a problem. And the Discovery Channel's new strategy title, EVOLUTION, Sure has problems. Players must nudge their species up the evolutionary ladder while contending with rival species and a constantly changing (and frequently hostile) planet. It may sound good, but in practice it's a dull exercise in non-control and waiting, dominated by non-events. A thor oughly unfriendly interface does an incredible job of standing directly between the gamer and what little enjoyment there is to be had. EVOLUTION is extinct upon arrival. --Robert Coffey STREETS OF SIM CITY In this game, you drive around your own SimCity 2000 city in missions that require you to either eliminate the opposition or perform other tasks. This style of game has not only been done before (INTERSTATE '76), it's been done better. A few minutes of gameplay and you'll realize that this game is nelther as involving nor sophisticated as 1-76. -Tahsin Shamma Maxis, (800) 336-2947 www.maxis.com Win 95 CD-ROM CGW MARCH 1998 "

"CGW Presents Best & Worst of 1997 he announcement is punctuated with applause, cheers, and delighted screams. A spotlight swoops past preassigned seats to crown its target with a luminous corona. Music swells into a symphonic cliché that would make even Barry Manilow proud. The winner walks briskly to the podium with visions of thanking God, Mom, and investment bankers dancing in his or her head. That's how most people think of awards ceremonies, and frankly, it's a lot of hooey. Awards legitimate singular artistic efforts. At their best, they encourage one to try an overlooked product. At their worst, they heap extra hype on commercially successful products. As humans, though, we like awards and await our chance for recognition. We can't resist arguing the worthiness and unworthiness of other people's choices. Each year, the editors of Computer Gaming World present the BEST game in each gaming genre along with the ONE game that transcends its genre and opens up new worlds and experiences to gamers of other styles. This year, we're also presenting the WORST gaming experiences from 1997. And the best part is, you don't have to sit through long dance numbers and ill-prepared acceptance speeches to find out who won! And the winners are... "


"GAME OF THE YEAR Jedi Knight STAR WARS__ n a secret ballot vote, the CGW Editorial Staff voted almost unanimously (except for one GETTYSBURG fan) to give the 1998 Premier Award for Game of the Year to LucasArts' JEDI KNIGHT, designed by Justin Chin. This award is given to the game that transcends all genres, presents innovative design ideas, and offers a thoroughly rewarding gaming experience requirements that JEDI KNIGHT wholeheartedly fulfills. JEDI KNIGHT introduced a host of new design concepts into the first-person action genre, helping to elevate it above the other 3D shooters in the market. The two chief elements that set JEDI KNIGHT apart are its integrated plot and its character development. It was the first action game to tightly integrate the story into the gameplay, with cut-scenes that flowed straight into in-game action and multiple-objective-based levels that fit into the story. There have been other attempts to meld story and gameplay together in action games, but none ever approached Jedi's level. The character development in JEDI KNIGHT also vaulted it JEDI KNIGIAT BAK FOREDRUC ahead of the pack and beyond just the sights of action gamers. How many of us have wanted the chance to learn the Force or join the Dark Side? You can do both in JEDI, and you can do so on an immersive level that actually makes you care about your character's choices. It's a roleplaying convention that's done better here than in other role-playing games. Besides the plot and character development, Jedi offered a host of other features that cemented its place as 1997 Game of the Year. Take, for example, the amazing level design and clever puzzles, the hair-raising lightsaber duels with the Dark Jedi, the almost cinematic way in which the game set up those duels of good versus evil, and the immersion in the Star Wars universe. The graphics were good, multiplayer was fun, and the music (of course) was first-rate. While QUAKE II delivers a more visceral adrenaline rush, JEDI KNIGHT offers a much richer single-player experience. As did DIABLO the year before, Jedi rose above the crowd in appealing to gamers across all genres. The Force was definitely with LucasArts when they made JEDI KNIGHT, DARK FORCES II.

"CGW 1998 PREMIER AWARDS ACTION GAME OF THE YEAR Quake II ction games were in a pivotal evolutionary phase this year. There weren't as many quality titles to play, but what good games did exist were head-and-shoulders above last year's best. The action genre has never lacked for excellent multiplay, but solo action has suffered egregiously of late. This was the year to fix that nagging disability, and our nominees provided incredible solo experiences in addition to their great multiplay. Of these nominees, the award goes to QUAKE II. Why? Because this is an action award, and for pure adrenaline-pumping, visceral, instantly gratifying action, Quake II is the hands-down winner. No game gave us the rush that QUAKE II did. It even had a good singleplayer component, with unit-based levels, multilevel missions, and little extras (such as radio chatter) to deepen the immersion INTERSTATE '76 was more stylish and original, but it suffered a lack of good 3D support and an irritating save feature. If both of those problems had been addressed, you might be looking at a different awards ceremony. G-POLICE was the most beautiful of all these games, but its lack of multiplay hobbled its chances for an award. As for JEDI, we think it is a better overall game than QUAKE II, especially in its story-telling, drama, and immersion. That's why it, and not QUAKE II, is our Game of the Year. But when we asked OTHER ACTION FINALISTS: ourselves which action game delivered G-Police Psygnosis the purest rush for hard-core action Interstate '76 Activision gamers, we came back to Quake II. Jedi Knight LucasArts K IL ADVENTURE GAME OF THE YEAR Curse of Monkey Island OTHER ADVENTURE FINALISTS: Blade Runner Westwood The Last Express Red Orb Twinsen's Odyssey Activision Zork Grand Inquisitor Activision t turned out to be a surprisingly good year for adventure games. While everybody (including CGW) was busy bemoaning the sad state of the genre, by year's end, we had more nominees than we could have imagined. There is one adventure game, however, that clearly stood out as an unqualified triumph: LucasArts' THE CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND, the long-awaited third installment in the ongoing story of doofus pirate Guybrush Threepwood. Like all the great LucasArts adventures, THE CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND is an animated, 2D comic romp that combines challenging, inventory-based puzzle solving with unabashedly goofy cartoon humor. Simply everything is done right in this game: lush graphics, outstanding voice-acting, strong storyline, clever puzzles, and, best of all, a script with more big laughs in it than just about anything at the movies these days. It is easily, the most entertaining adventure in years, and is our hands-down winner. Our other nominees are also quite good. Westwood's BLADE RUNNER is a remarkable-looking, faithful adaptation of the classic sci-fi film.

The other role-playing games released this year-BETRAYAL IN ANTARA, LANDS OF LORE: GUARDIANS OF DESTINY, SHADOWS OVER RIVAeach had its moments, but each had huge problems as well, and certainly none came close to the vision, inspiration, and artistic accomplishment of FALLOUT. ell, this is an easy one. The Role-Playing Game of the Year is FALLOUT, Interplay's masterful postapocalyptic epic, which is so good that we didn't even bother to nominate any other games. And though it had no serious competition, it's safe to say that FALLOUT would have won this award no matter how many other nominees there were, because this is quite simply the best RPG to hit the PC in years. Dubbed the \"spiritual successor\" (as opposed to sequel) to the seminal RPG WASTELAND, FALLOUT places you 200 years in the future, where you must cope with a nightmarish post-holocaust world of radiation, giant scorpions, badass mutant zombies, and more. There's a lot to praise—the stylish, kitschy art design; the challenging quests; the intelligent dialogue-but what puts this game over is its deep commitment to character development, in which your decisions and actions seriously affect the outcome of the game. FALLOUT is an obvious labor of love from a team that really knows RPGs, and their enthusiasm permeates every TAC PLAY Sports GAMES OF THE YEAR Abcrosoft Baseball Mogul CART Racing zou hile the real world was full of boxers icrosoft continued to redeem its Precision biting ears and hoopsters choking name with gamers with CART coaches, the PC sports world was a PRECISION RACING, a high-octane, much saner place to be in 1997.

"CGW 1998 PREMIER AWARDS OTHER SIM FINALISTS: F-22 ADF Digital Image Design Flight Unlimited 2 Looking Glass Simulation GAME OF THE YEAR Longbow 2 or the second year in a row, Origin's Skunkworks team walks away with a Premier Award for a game based on the AH-64D Longbow. LONGBOW 2, the sequel to last year's winner, maintains all the elements that made LONGBOW Special, including authentic flight models, realistic instrumentation, and widely adjustable skill levels that make the game accessible to beginners and combat aviation fanatics alike. Building on that solid foundation, the team added a dynamic battlefield that ensures you'll never repeat the same mission twice. There's more action on the **2*13W ground and in the air, and the addition of two new helicopters to fly brings new tactics into play. The game looks great on most systems, and is absolutely dazzling on PCs with 3Dfx Voodoo graphics cards. On top of all that, cooperative and combative multiplayer modes let players share the duties of piloting the chopper and handling its weapons. Authentic, exciting, immersive, and graphically dazzling, this is a sim that transcends its genre. DID's F-22 AIR DOMINANCE FIGHTER, the follow-up to 1995 Premier Award-winner EF2000, featured dazzling graphics, great flight modeling, and immersive missions, which made this game not only authentic, but fun as well. Had it not omitted a mission editor, it might have edged out LONGBOW 2. FLIGHT UNLIMITED 2, the first aviation sim to truly capture the environment of real civilian LONGBOW2 flying, deserves a nod as well. Space Sim GAME OF THE YEAR ORIGIN Wing Commander Prophecy ace it: Only the most starry-eyed gamers could possibly consider this year a great one for space sims. 10TH PLANET never shipped, and STARFLEET ACADEMY should have shipped a year earlier. The Euro-hit I-WAR would surely be a contender, but it won't ship in the U.S. until late spring. So it was left to Origin/EA to not just salvage a tired genre, but reinvent it in the process. Not only would Wing COMMANDER PROPHECY have won Best Space Sim in any recent year, it was also one of the few serious contenders to JEDI KNIGHT as this year's overall Game of the Year. PROPHECY sports tremendous graphics that look great rendered merely via software. With 3Dfx support, you'll hardly believe your eyes, as the in-flight action looks better than the cut-scenes in most other games. PROPHECY is more than mere eye-candy. The gameplay, featuring a new, creepy alien race. is easily the most engrossing since WING 11-the missions were designed before the movie, and it shows. Even the full-motion video segments actually enhance, rather than detract from, the flow of the game, because what you see is dependent on how well you perform in the mission: PROPHECY has multiple levels of victory or defeat, another departure from previous WING COMMANDERS. Yes, PROPHECY pushes your hardware (nothing new for WING COMMANDER), but it's also as close to Babylon 5 as we're likely to get on a PC anytime soon. For the detractors upset about the removal of promised multiplayer options, well, we'll take a compelling story, good characters, and classic WING COMMANDER Wrist-Wracking action over the empty single-player experience of X-WING VS. TIE FIGHTER any day. MARCH 1998 "

"CGW 1998 PREMIER AWARDS  OF THE YEAR Myth This was a good year for real-time games, even despite the number of ugly COMMAND & CONDUER clones that hit the shelves. The good real-time games of the year were more sophisticated, better-looking, and more fun. Yet, while all the other nominees were evolutionary steps in gameplay with the same C&C look, one game that stood out for its originality was Bungie's MYTH. TOTAL ANNIHILATION did 3D terrain well, but Myth blew that out of the water with its undulating hills, exploding craters, and obtrusive tree tops-this was true 3D terrain that got in your face. Sure, AGE OF EMPIRES added more depth to your real-time building options, but Bungie went an entirely new route by including only tactical gameplay, there's no building, just fighting. And to make sure that the fighting was as sophisticated as possible, formations were added; when combined with terrain considerations, it made for a deeper tactical wargame than any other real-time strategy title. WARLORDS III had a good role-playing, fantasy feel, but it couldn't beat MYTH's originality or personality. Even DUNGEON KEEPER lost in that respect (its dated look didn't help either). But what sealed Myth's award was its single-player experience. Bungie created the best single-player strategy game of OTHER STRATEGY FINALISTS: the year. The carryover of heroes, the voice-overs and NPCs in Age of Empires Ensemble/Microsoft actual scenario play, and the great back-story all combined to Total Annihilation Cavedog/GT Interactive create an immersive single-player package that was the most Warlords III SSG/Red Orb BUITE compelling of all strategy games. Dungeon Keeper Bullfrog GAME OF THE YEAR GETTYSBURGI Sid Meier's Gettysburg t was a year of sequels like no other-because the majority of sequels were surprisingly good. For the first time since the advent of the original HARPOON, real-time wargames proved that they were here to stay, comprising exactly half of our finalists. ACHTUNG! SPITFIRE, a real-time/turn-based hybrid, was simply the OPTIONS JSTORY DIFFICULTY best BATTLE OF BRITAIN game ever. A BRIDGE TOO FAR improved in every way over Atomic's origiA PetTin C ... nal CLOSE COMBAT. NAPOLEON IN RUSSIA sent the BATTLEGROUND engine out in style, and PANZER GENERAL II is a clinic in how to properly develop a sequel. All of these fine games might have won the award in any other year. But 1997 marked the return to form of arguably the best designer ever. Sid Meier's GETTYSBURG might not be as painstakingly accurate as TalonSoft's BATTLEGROUND games, but it delivers a potent Civil War punch. Everything contributes to the period flavor, from the strains of martial music to the panoramic sweep of the formations as they move toward famous objectives such as Devil's Den. Not only do you see the battle unfold as Lee or Meade might have, you even find yourself listening for trumpet calls to give a clue concerning enemy maneuvers. The tutorials are among the best you'll find in any genre, and the random maps and multiplayer options ensure that this is one game that really will play until Johnny comes marching home.

"CGW 1998 PREMIER AWARDS Special Award: Outstanding Multiplay g Age of Empires t was a very good year for multiplayer games There was JEDI KNIGHT, INTERSTATE '76, HEROES II: PRICE OF LOYALTY, SCOURGE OF ARMAGON, and QUAKE II. But one game in particular burrowed deep in our brainstems, luring us back again and again. Almost every day at six o'clock, work ceases at CGW, and AGE OF EMPIRES begins. Few people can resist Age's outstanding combination of graphics, sound, and gameplay. There is enough variety in the different civilizations, maps, and victory conditions to ensure that no two multiplayer games are alike. But the heart of the game is its close-range melee combat, which is accessible and exciting for every kind of player. As a singleplayer game, Age is interesting, but as a multiplayer game it's outstanding. Special Award: Add-On Pack Special Awards Artistic Achievement F-'76 hile most computer games this shook the gaming world's collective year looked to the future or booty. Yeah, the action rocked, but all of distant past-or created a fanthe chrome, including the hilarious opentasy world of their own for their inspiraing credits and wonderfully cinematic cuttion, one game this year immersed us scenes, put i-'76 over the top. And that's instead in one of the most alien settings the way, uh-huh imaginable: the 1970s. uh-huh, we like it. Sier: 16 The idea behind INTERSTATE 76— an \"auto-combat simulation\" set in an alternate universe 1970s-was good enough, but the extent to which the game's designers realized their vision elevated it into the realm of the ultra-cool. With stateof-the-art 3D graphics; a Mad Maxian script infused with bravado and style; and a silky, bass-heavy funk soundtrack, INTERSTATE '76 2013 Quake Mission Pack No. 1: Scourge of Armagon this was a good year for expansion packs. We played some great games, and when we were done, companies like Rogue, Cyberlore, and Ritual came in and gave us some more. Of all the expansions to all the games, though, one stands out in our minds: Ritual's QUAKE MISSION PACK 1: SCOURGE OF ARMAGON. Simply put, this expansion, alone among all others, was actually much better than its original game. The levels were better in ARMAGON than in QUAKE, and the DeathMatch level was arguably the best we have ever seen. There were many other stellar expansion packs this year, including HEROES II: THE PRICE OF LOYALTY, RED ALERT. AFTERMATH, and Civ II: FANTASTIC WORLDS, but none succeeded in taking its original game to the next level quite as well as Ritual's SCOURGE OF ARMAGON. Special Awardl: Musical Achievement Outlaws n OUTLAWS, Clint Bajakian has composed the most atmospheric soundtrack possible.

Take SOLDIER Boyz-please. But ULTIMA ONLINE gets our booby prize for one reason: No game came into 1997 with greater hype, anticipation, and promise than this one, only to be so utterly disappointing. UO was cynically shoved onto the market, with a hefty price tag and a monthly connection fee, by publishers who were well aware that the game was not even remotely complete. Given the huge lag problems, bugs, and sheer unplayability, Origin owed it to gamers to first, acknowledge-publicly, immediately, that the game was a beta, and second, waive the monthly con nection fees indefinitely until the game was playable. We hope that ULTIMA ONLINE will one day prove to be great. But in 1997 it was foisted prematurely upon the gaming public, and for that it is CGW's Coaster of the Year y ounger a ACTION coaster PUZZLE Coaster SLLVISPAGE SILM Goaster MAGESLAYER (Raven): This top-down shooter was ill-conceived in design and an utter disaster in implementation CLUE (Hasbro Interactive): The company should have bought a clue before releasing this unplayable clunker.

"Real3D Enters the Fray In the previous edition of 3D Iron Works, Loyd Case gave you the first skinny on Intel's new i740 2D/3D graphics chip. This month, yet another vendor has IRON WORKS announced a board using this new chip. But this isn't just another vendor,\" it's Real3D, Lockheed Martin's real-time 3D graphics division-the architect of the i740's 3D graphics core. Real3D is working on its Starfighter board in two versions: an AGP version that will appear in off-the-shelf systems, and a PCI version that will be sold at retail. Of the two, the PCI part is actually more interesting, because of Real3D's implementation. Using a pro. prietary AGP-PCI interface, Real3D \"Tools\" the 1740 into thinking it's on the AGP bus. It does this by creating a local AGP bus on the board itself. The Starfighter is populated with a 4MB frame buffer, and texture memory ranges from 8MB to 16MB. To the i740, this local-texture memory looks like AGP memory, and can be accessed at AGP's 2x peak bandwidth of 528MB/sec. One concern I have is the fact that the i740's 2D core was developed by Chips & Technologies, which has done graphics chips for laptops, but doesn't have much of a track record in the desktop PC space. Pricing is still being worked out, but we've heard guestimates of around $249 for a board with a 4MB frame buffer and 8MB of texture memory. As soon as we get a Starfighter in-house, we'll put it through its paces and let you know how it fares. Stay tuned. Turning to the audio front, Shark Multimedia has just begun shipping its Predator 3D audio card, an ISA-based card based on Analog Devices' SoundMAX chipset, which supports Aureal Semiconductor's A3D 3D positional audio technology, and can accelerate up to six simultaneous audio streams.

Finally, I'll try to address a burning question that seems to be the most common email query I get these days: Which graphics card should I get?\" ast month, I talked about how to improve the performance of your graphics setup. But what exactly does improved performance mean? This month, I'll take a look at benchmarking, both synthetic and real-world. I'll also spend some time exploring 3D WinBench 98, Ziff-Davis' cool new Direct3D method that's easy to quantify. It sounds simple, but it proves complicated in practice. There are two types of benchmarks: synthetic benchmarks, which try to stress the system being tested in carefully controlled ways, and applications benchmarks, which try to measure how real-world applications behave on a system. Examples of synthetic benchmarks include Continued on pg 98 MEASURING PERFORMANCE Benchmarking is a tricky job.

"LOYD CASE HARDWARE >> Continued from pg 97 WinBench 98 and 3D WinBench 98. Examples of applications benchmarks include many of the games we use to test 3D performance, such as Fuicer SIMULATOR 98 and QUAKE. At first glance, you might think that applications benchmarks are the only way to go-but what do you mean when you say application? It gets really tricky with 3D graphics. Take the PowerVR chip from NEC, for example. That chip doesn't do particularly well in 3D WinBench. It also fares poorly in some across all the tests will probably get a high score. (I say \"probably,\" because if its egregiously hard to install or has other flaws, it may not get a high score.) When you're picking a card, though, you may have only one particular type of game in mind. A card that gets a score of 3 out of 5 may be better for your gaming needs because it may do one particular thing really well. Benchmark Operation Web site, www.zdbop.com. There's an online form you can fill out to order the CD. (You'll probably want to order the CD, since the program is a nearly 40MB download.) ZDBOP charges only a $5 shipping and handling fee, so it's well worth the money. 3D WINBENCH 98 This brings me to the latest version of 3D WinBench, the 98 version. First of A STICKY QUESTION The most common question I get via email these days is Which graphics card should I get?\" The second most common question is «Should I get a 2D3D combination card or add a 3Dfx card?\" THE FINAL FRONTIER Note how the Stations scene now looks a lot better. Space stations belong in space, after all. Direct3D games. In other D3D games, it's very solid, and in most games I've seen that directly use the hardware, it runs quite well and the image quality is good. I've seen other cards do quite well in some games and choke on others. At CG Labs, we use both types of benchmarks and try to gauge performance across a range of different types of games. A card that does pretty well TECH all, 3D WinBench 98 is much more comprehensive than the 97 version. For one thing, there are more than 40 quality tests (of which 25 are used during the actual 3D WinBench testing). No card currently on the market passes all 25 tests in that sense, 3D WinBench 98 is forward-looking The benchmark looks better, too. First, the 3D WinBench WinMark scenes look more like scenes from a game, and the camera movement is more like game movement. Second, the image-quality tests are laid out in a more useful manner. The image-quality tests offer many more options (41 in all) for checking out rendering. Of course, this means that 3D WinBench 98 takes longer to run, but it's easier to use overall and can really drill down and help us understand how some cards implement-or fail to implement-key Direct3D features. If you want to order a copy of 3D WinBench 98, go to the Ziff-Davis I'm always tempted to reply in a flip manner: «Read the reviews.\" But I understand that it's not a simple issue, especially when it comes down to your hardearned dollars. So my real answer is simple: It depends. Okay, so that sounds like a flip answer as well -but it's not. It really depends on your situation, your budget, your gaming needs, and your nongaming computer needs. Let's walk through a couple of examples and show you what I mean. First, consider a hard-core gamer on a budget. He's scraped and saved to put together a 166MHz or 200MHz. Pentium MMX system. The system has a graphics card, maybe even a mediocre 3D accelerator, but he wants to play GL QUAKE or just not have to worry about which 3D accelerated games he can play. The right answer, although not the cheapest, is a good 3Dfx card. If our hard-core game player gets a 3Dfx card, such as the Monster3D or Pure3D, he's set. He can f you've got a RIVA 128 card, and you want to run JEDI KNIGHT with the best performance, set the texture size to 4 from the default of 1.

TRATED  CLABS ***** REVIEW  TURTLE BEACH DAYTONA PCI Unsound Choice by Loyd Case nu apare aytonapel HARDWARE his year is probably the last one in which the aging ISA bus will be a factor in PCs. One of the last bastions of ISA hardware has been sound cards. Windows 95 and DirectSound are beginning to change that, and we're finally starting to see PCI sound cards. The 'Turtle Beach Daytona PCI is one such example. 'The 'Turtle Beach card uses the S3 Sonic Vibes PCI auclio-chip. The chip can handle the new DLS technology (downloadable sample store), which uses your system memory to store custom sounds that can be played back through the onboard wavetable synthesizer. The card comes with a 2MB wavetable that's loaded into main memory. During playback of several MIDI files with the Price: $99 (estimated Windows 95 System Monitor rumming, street) there is no significant CPU hit, Vendor: Turtle Beach 800-233-9377 The quality of the MIDI sounds is an www.tbeach.com | entirely different issue, however. Even with the maximum 2MB setting, the MIDI sounds somewhat tinny, and some of the percussioni sounds are simply terrible. Digital audio sounds pretty good, but this is a noisy card. Turn up your speakers when there's no sound being played back, and you could be standing near Niagara Falls. Setup is pretty casy, but the card did not like the fifth PCI slot in my system (that's often the case for bus-mastering PCI cards). Moving it to another slot fixed that problem. The setup program was confused about the system settings upon reboot, and offered an accurate walkthrough on how to fix the I/O addresses that had been set incorrectly. Windows 95 game audio sounds pretly good (except for the hiss), and DOS games that can be run from Windows 95 work quite well. However, neither DUKE NUKEM 3D nor DOS QUAKE ran properly from a Windows 95 DOS boot. Although the low cost makes up somewhat for the deficiencies, it's hard to recommend this card. For best compatibility, the AWE-64 value edition still wins, and it's much quieter to boot. As a PCI sound card, the Turtle Beach card doesn't come close to the more versatile Diamond Monster Sound. Give this one a pass. APPEAL: Loyal S3 users looking for a low-cost PCI sound card. PROS: Uses one of those free PCI slots; fairly easy setup. CONS: Lots of hiss; poor MIDI sound quality.

"PDPI LIGHTNING 4 . REVIEW ***** The Invisible Game Card HARDWARE by Loyd Case 've long lamented the fact that the creaky analog joystick port, developed in the era of the original IBM PC, is a CPU hog. Came ports on most systems today bchave in a virtually identical manner to the one you could get for the original IBM PC. Most game ports including those on ISAbased sound cards--can consume 10 to 15 percent of your CPU cycles because of the polling of the joystick input. On top of that, during the actual polling interval, interrupts are disabled-at least they are in Windows 95 — which further increases the latency of your net gaming experience. Almost everyone has been looking forward to the day that USB controllers will arrive in force. While we were waiting, Pacific Digital Peripherals has sneaked in with its Lightning 4 game card. The Lightning 4 is a true game geek's delight. It can support up to four full-featured joysticks or eight 2-axis, 2-button joysticks. It even comes with an extra bracket, so you can have four joystick ports. I connected a CH F-16 Combat Stick, Pro Throttle, and Pro Pedals and successfully flew FLIGHT SIMULATOR 98 and LONGBOW 2. More importantly, the Lightning has its own onboard processor to handle joystick polling, resulting in very low CPU utilization-less than 0.2 percent in most cases. The card comes with a DirectInput driver, the connector bracket, and a small demo utility that lets the device see eight joysticks in action (splitter cables are not provided). While the card supports digital devices, such as Logitech's Wingman Extreme Digital, it doesn't support the Side Winder Force Feedback Pro, which requires the extra MIDI pin. If you're using a standard stick, though, you should have no problems. If you're installing it into an existing setup, make sure you disable any existing game ports. The Lightning grabs I/O address 201, and you can't change it. So if you're looking to cke out that last bit of frame rate, take a look at your game card. Maybe it's time to add a little Lightning to your rig. APPEAL: Game players looking for the best game card available. PROS: Low CPU utilization; easy installation; four joystick ports.

"QUAKE II  REVIEW ACTION can crouch to duck your shot, though they stay crouched long enough to become catchers of your lead fastball. Two words: Aim lower. The monsters' Al routines are scripted, so they can't react dynamically to what you're doing, but there are some clever effects. For example, some preset events take place at certain Y-junctions: You might come in, go left, start partying with a couple of Stroggs, and suddenly realize that you're also taking fire from behind. The other pranksters were lurking on the other side of the Y-junction and have decided to join the fun. So, while individual Al isn't stellar, enemy placement and clustering can still keep you on your toes. The three difficulty levels-easy, medium, and hard-scale up the number of foes and the number of hit points needed to down your enemies, while reducing the amount of health scattered throughout the units. QII doesn't have a Nightmare difficulty level, but the Hard setting should keep you sufficiently overwhelmed The final showdown is with the Strogg commander, one bigassed boss whose arsenal includes a BFC and twin chain guns. Ouch. Without giving away too much, there's a very cool sequence during the Final Showdown that's reminiscent of Alicns. The final level also has a pretty cool secret that I'll leave you to discover GET BENT, GET DEAD Like the monsters, you can crouch, too. THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR While handy for hiding, it'll leave you a sitting, or crouching One thing that QUAKE did absolutely right was its multiplayduck in a firefight er gameplay. QII, therefore, faces a huge challenge to outdo its predecessor in this arena.

Monsters are more of the have them instantly activated. Among the Frags-R-Us crowd cyborg variant-part humanoid, part machine and have here at CGW, the opinions about power-up hoarding are higher polygon counts than QUAKE's ne'er-co-wells, so their mixed.

And when they do finalRather than glowing, a player with the quad turns blue, whereas ly give up the ghost, some, like the guards, have a last dying gessomeone with invulnerability turns bright red. Definitely a case ture: They either flail around on the ground before expiring or in which it's better to give than receive. Another cool addition is they sit up to try to fire one last shot before passing on. So, you that you get a countdown when a power-up is activated so you definitely have an incentive to reduce them to giblets. know when it's about to run out of gas. Most of the same power-ups are back in QII, except for the Curiously, co-op multiplayer is nowhere to be found in QII.

"REVIEW. G-POLICE NOTIV The End of Console Crud an extremely high fire rate and an annoying tendency to overlicat. Other ordinance includes a variety of short-, medium-, and long-range missiles; bombs; lasers; plasma launchers; and pulse paralyzers. The new weapons pack a wallop, but my favorites are definitely the starburst dispersion missiles, which launch in bursts of eight, and the 1000Kg bomb, which unleashes a shock wave unlike anything else you've ever seen. BARF BAG CITY Multiple camera views, such as this external overhead shot, convey the depth and detail of the game world in G-POLICE. EYE CANDY Here's the best part. G-POLICE features graphics that are arguably the most elaborate and fantastic to ever grace the computer screen. Although the game doesn't require a 3D-accelerated video card, its beauty can't be totally appreciated without one. Most missions take place in city domes, with myriad skyscrapers, each MIP-mapped with stunningly realistic textures, flashing lights, signs, and billboards. Like scenes from Blade Runner, these urban vistas are absolutely furious with activity, both on the ground and in the air. Other graphic goodies include spectacular explosions, transparencies, lightsource shading, and lens flares. If you don't have a beefy machine, you can toggle various graphics effects. Tested on a P233MMX with both 3D Blaster and Monster 3D cards installed, with all settings on ligh, the frame rate and control were absolutely liquid. The game is even smart enough to recognize multiple 2D/3D cards, allowing you to pick your preference before loading. Finally, this is one of the first games to support the new Pentium II with AGP technology. Blazing action, resplendent graphics, and an intelligent story linc-C-POLICE has it all. If you rate a game's enjoyment by its \"wow\" factor, put this one at the top of your list. LETHAL HARVEST Beyond the urban sprawl, G-POLICE missions also unfold in less hectic environs, such as this farmland biosphere. or years, computer players have thumbed their collective noses at games ported from consoles, and for good reason. Typical console ports have been shoddy, designed simply to squeeze more revenue out of popular videogame titles. How else can you explain the likes of MORTAL KOMBAT, TEN PIN ALLEY, or MADDEN FOOTBALL on the PC? Psygnosis has changed all that with G-POLICE, a PlayStation conversion so good that it does more than merely raise the stakes for other publishers: It sets a whole new standard of excellence. From here on out, PC gamers should expect nothing less than what Psygnosis has painstakingly achieved. Hell, we should demand it. Much credit goes to second-generation programmers who now fully comprehend the power and potential of 3D accelerators. Let's admit it, PC gamers have always been secretly jealous of their console counterparts. What console games lacked in depth, they more than made up for with a combination of fast action and killer visuals, thanks to dedicated graphic processors. At long last, the tide has turned, thanks to advances in PC hardware that have been long overdue. But the ultimate kudos should go to the new generation of console-to-PC conversion artists who finally take pride in their work. Programmers like the in-house crew at Psygnosis are beginning to deliver quality products far beyond previous expectations. So thanks, Psygnosis, for throwing down the gauntlet. G-POLICE proves how extraordinary console conversions can be. THE DOGS OF WAR Cameplay is comprised of some 35 missions, with fascinating FMV sequences interspersed to advance the story line, introduce new characters, and build upon the sinister plot. Missions are strictly linear, which means you must adequately complete one before heading to the next. Most missions have both primary and secondary goals. Failure to complete a goal requires that you start the mission again from scratch. Games can be saved between missions, but not in-flight, which makes some of the later, lengthier sorties frustratingly difficult to finish. Ona negative note, the first half of the game has some pretty repetitive missions. Persevere, however, its well worth it. The game defaults to first-person view, although multiple camera angles such as chase, fly-by, and overheadcan be accessed via hotkeys. There's plenty of heavy weaponry to assist and amuse you throughout the game. Your standard weapon is a nosemounted 30mm fixed cannon, featuring APPEAL: Advanced-level sci-fi blast masters. PROS: Knockout 3D-enhanced graphics and sound effects; large variety of missions and locations; genuinely interesting story line. CONS: Steep system require ments; no multiplayer options; missions eventually become repetitive. CGW MARCH 1998 "

There are four different modes of play: arcade (the original two arcade tracks), PC mode (extra mirror tracks), time trial (basic practice), and network (multiplay for eight). in the end, MANX was a bittersweet game experience.

Part of the problem is that the game only had two tracks. Unfortunately, Sega didn't add any 01:35:17 new tracks to this port. Since the game is based on the Isle of Man Trophy Race, there is really only one racing course in the game. Players can race a long and a short version of SU the main course, and the PC version adds reversed/mirrored versions of each track (so you can race them backwards), but that's it.

"***** REVIEW  3D ULTRA PINBALL: LOST CONTINENT PINBALLS ACTION DIFFICULTY LEVEL Pinball Lizard by Shane Mooney here finally seems to be a trend among developers to put more story into their action games. Sierra evidently decided that even a pinball game could use a good plot, and believe it or not, it works. 3D ULTRA PINBALL: LOST CON\"TINENT's opening animation shows a small plane crash-landing on a Lost Even on a Pentium 11/266, the ball would sometimes freeze momentarily. And, at times, the goal of each table was just too obscure. Plus, there's no printed manual, only measly online documentation. But all these minor annoyances are easily countered by the realistic pinball physics, immersive environments, and plot-driven play. & World brimming with thunder lizards. It's up to you to guide the plane's three passengers through the perils of the Lost Continent...by playing pinball. The 16 tables found throughout the island are multimedia extravaganzas bursting with glorious sound effects, impressive graphics, and surprisingly entertaining gameplay. On one table, you'll use a pinball to take down a carnivorous dinosaur, then navigate that same ball into a strategically placed cave to advance further through the steaming jungle. As you progress, more of the story (as well as additional supporting characters) is revealed. While most pinball games motivate you solely to beat the current high score, this one actually adds an adventure element to the mix. But, LOST CONTINENT is not without flaws. This game is going to tap your hardware pretty heavily. Price: $44.95 System Requirements: 486/DX66, Windows 95, 8MB RAM 3D Support: None. Multiplayer Support: Hotseat (2-4 players).

"MEN IN BLACK: THE GAME REVIEW ** * DIFFICULTY LEVEL Extraterrestrial Ennui SouthPeak Can't Cover Up MEN IN BLACK's Basic Flaws by Steve Poole PUZZLE ME THIS One of the game's few bright points is this challenging puzzle in the Amazon. lancing over the games based on movies released in the past few years, you might wonder why any game publisher even pursues the concept anymore. STAR TREK: GENERATIONS, THE LAWNMOWER MAN, BLOWN AWAY, JOHNNY MNEMONIC, CONGOall these and others served only to prove there's a lot more to making a great game than acquiring a hot movie license. In fact, Bethesdas SKYNET and LucasArts X-WING and DARK FORCES games were about the only movie-inspired offerings that delivered high-quality play. the flick) as they investigate mysteries in the Arctic, the Amazon, and the fictitious Frales Island. Complementing your standard MIB pistol are exotically named weapons, such as the \"Series 4 DeAtomizer\" and the \"Pulsar Arm Cannon.\" In some cases, though, you'll have to square off barchanded against evil aliens and humans. MIB does add a few traditional adventure-game elements to its run-andgun gameplay. Most puzzles are straightforward-use an inventory item on an object in the game world but a couple of missions require you to solve some slightly tricky logic puzzles, too. commands, no gamepad support, strained attempts to duplicate the film's humor, weary voice-acting, too few alien types, and a kludgy interface for exploration. Look past those problems and you'll find perhaps the biggest drawback of all: It's way too short. Set aside one or two sticking points, and you're looking at somewhere between one and three hours per mission for intermediate players. Duplicating the excitement and fun of a movie such as Men in Black in a computer game is a tough row to hoe, but that doesn't change the fact that MIB: THE GAME is at best, merely average. Given what gamers have to choose from, that's just not good enough. ANOTHER MOVIE, ANOTHER GAME Still, the appeal of leveraging boxoffice success to boost PC game sales is strong, especially when the movie is last summer's smash hit Men in Black. On the face of it, MIB seems like a pretty good choice if you're going to make a movie-based game-its bizarre aliens, high-tech weapons, and tongue-in-cheek plot are a nice springboard for an actionadventure game. Unfortunately, MIB: THE GAME suffers from a double whammy: Serious gamers will be dissatisfied with the lack of depth, and casual gamers lured by the movie tie-in will be left cold by the games average graphics and lethargic voice-acting. The engine takes its cue from games like ALONE IN THE DARK and BIOFORGE. From a third-person perspective, you control Agents J, K, or L (the Joncs, Smith, and Fiorentino characters from MUCH LESS THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS MIB has the core components of a good game, but for various reasons they simply don't add up to very much fun. Remember those fancy weapons? Well, you can carry only one on each mission. Not that it matters much, since each weapon looks drab and packs a nearly identical punch. Hand-to-hand combat can be needlessly difficult because of perspective problems, but then again, once you master the keys, outfighting your enemies becomes a breeze. MIB has numerous other shortcomings-nonconfigurable keyboard APPEAL: Gamers who are looking for a watered-down version of the movie with average action and puzzle-solving. PROS: A decent mix of action and puzzle-solving. CONS: Too few and undifferentiated weapons; uninspired voiceacting; drab aliens; cumbersome interface; too little and too shallow gameplay.

You can't die (except in one of the game's most memorable puzzles, in which dying is thic object) and you'll never enter a new section of the game without the minimum of what you need to complete it. The only part I could have done without is the ridiculous, arcade-style ship combat in the middle of the game. Mercifully, you can toggle it to a very simple setting. The second part of the combat dueling insults with the enemy ship captains is hilarious, but goes on a tad too long, ADVENTURE/RPG 125 prayed SEA CHANTEY HELL How to stop the pirates from singing? These guys are good, so you better find a word they can't rhyme. puzzles and conversations throughout MONKEY ISLAND, it seems odd, then, that the ending-the game's only real disappointment-should be so abrupt and perfunctory, as if the designers suddenly ran out of time, money, or inspiration. It's still funny-especially if you sit through the credits-yet after a terrific buildup, there's really no payoff. Still, the game is so great until then that there's no sense in denying it a perfect rating. Just as FALLOUT did recently for the reeling RPG genre, MONKEY ISLAND provides a case study in how to do things right, without reinventing the wheel. For those who have been turned off to the adventure game genre by the overabundance of portentous MYST clones or feeble FMV mysteries, THE CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND is the perfect tonic. Easily one of the best adventure games of the year, it joins LucasArts' hallowed pantheon of comic classics. Even those who've never played an adventure game might want to check it out. Computer gaming rarely gets more entertaining than this. WATCHOO TALKIN' BOUT? The highlight of this game, of course, is the dialogue. LucasArts writes funnier scripts than anyone else, including most of Hollywood these days, and CURSE OF MONKEY ISI AND catures humor LEMONHEAD, MEET TOFUHEAD Getting writing of the highest order. friendly with the natives on Blood Island means Whereas dialogue can often be a sticking a slab of wet tofu on your head. chore in adventure gamessomething to slog through to get adds more puzzles (or more steps to the the necessary clues--it's a complete joy same puzzles).

Likewise, the speaking cast handle their roles brilliantly, Fans of the film will remember the everpresent rain and fire that acted as a backdrop to the drama this feel has been duplicated for the game. Topping it all off is the powerful Vangelis score, which complements the game as strongly as it did the film. The real-time element adds an unusual degree of strategy to an adventure game. As in Broderbunds THE LAST EXPRESS, characters don't stand around forever in one place, so timing is often of critical value. This is particularly true of Lucy, who must be encountered at a certain point in the game in order to emerge successfully. You will frequently walk into life-or-death situations, and the only way to survive is through skin-of-yourteeth timing. The replicants in the game are more savage than those in the film and serve as deadly proof of how important it is to save your game often. They frequently appear out of nowhere and take McCoy's life without warning. It is this element of action and timingnot any puzzles-that makes BLADE RUNNER truly challenging.

For the Apache and the Kiowa Warrior, the alternate station is the copilot/gunners and copilot/observer's seat, respectively; Blackhawks have no equivalent, so you get to man the door guns instead. AH-64D LONGBOW APACHE The most capable helicopter gunship in the US inventory, the Apache is available with or without the Longbow radar system. by Robin G. Kim he sequel to CCWS 1996 flight sim of the year retains its predecessor's focus on gritty realism and teethclenching combat action. It also introduces enough enhancements and new gameplay options to impress LONGBOW players and satis fy even jaded sim veterans. LONGBOW 2 offers three helicopter models to fly. The star of the show is the NGBOW 2 CONTROL COMPLEX Control panels and avionics systems have been modeled precisely. The AH64D is by far the most complicated, with four MFDs (multifunction displays) and multiple radar modes, helmet-mounted display configurations, and electro-optical sensor displays. At the other end of the spectrum lies the UH-60L, with its broad array of analog instruments. The OH-58D's moderately complex layout revolves around its raison d'être: the ballshaped Mast-Mounted Sight above its main rotor, which allows it to see over terrain without being seen. Ironically, the MMS is practically useless because its image is confined to a tiny MFD. (The images from the Apaches nose-mounted sensor can be displayed full-screen, making target identification much easier.) This \"Mr. Magoo\" MMS largely undermines the Kiowa Warrior's utility unless you use the target ID cheat key Both flight-model and systems complexity can be toned down, but the learnUS Amy's premier helicopter gunship, the AH-64D Longbow Apache, available with or without the sophisticated Longbow fire-control radar. Backing up the Apache are the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, for reconnaissance and light attack duties, and the UH-60L Blackhawk, which specializes in troop insertions and extractions. Each handles differently, and the overall flight-model realism is excellent despite the lack of some esoteric rotary-wing aerodynamic effects.

LONGBOW 2 incorporates just such a system, replacing LONGBOW's branching scripted-mission sequences. Campaigns play out in roughly day-long tums. Each turn, the program creates a new set of missions for you, determines whether ground forces will attack or defend, and places reinforcements. A number of factors affect these decisions, including casualties from the previous turn, supply levels, troop movements, and the success or failure of your helicopters in their assigned missions. Occasionally. elaborate scripted missions are slipped in for added flavor. Overall, the campaign system succeeds admirably at producing missions that are logically linked to the progress of the war. Unfortunately, the turn-based structure has a negative effect on the missions. At the outset of every mission, all choppers on both sides move out simultaneously. As a result, deadly helicopter-vs.-helicopter clashes over the front lines CGW MARCH 1998 "

A patch is planned to fix these problems. ing curve remains relatively steep. To help you climb this curve, the sim includes a comprehensive spiralbound manual, an online encyclopedia, and hands-on training under the guidance of simulated instructor pilots. (Frame rate is slow during training, but it gets dramatically faster in actual play.) SIMULATION/SPACE UH-60L BLACKHAWK A high-performance infantry squad transport helicopter, the Blackhawk is used for troon insertions and extractions THE REAL DEAL LONGBOW 2 boasts perhaps the most visually and auditorily immersive combat environment of any flight sim. Spectacular graphical effects such as dynamic lighting, distance hazing, transparent smoke, and terrain filtering that eliminates pixelation (with or without a 3D card) are almost enough to make you forget that trees are still MIA. The virtual cockpit view which you can pan manually or lock onto a target-models head motions with astounding realism, providing a visceral feel ing of flight that is unmatched. Frame rate on a P166 is tolerable at the lowest detail settings, and the sim still looks pretty good. When you hook up a 3D card sporting a 3DFX Voodoo or Voodoo Rush chipset, the frame rate and image quality increase dramatically. Owners of non-Voodoo 3D accelerators are currently stuck with the slower, less attractive 2D mode. (A Direct3D patch is in the works to support other high-end 3D chipsets.) Sound effects and speech do just as much as graphics to draw you into the experience. During a typical mission, you might hear radio transmissions as other helo flights check in, status updates from HQ, or desperate calls for support from embattled units. Mission-specific call signs and a variety of voices help make it clear who is talking to whom. The chatter is not just atmospheric, you must often make snap decisions based on the information received. Ground troops to the south have spotted enemy armor moving toward their position. Do you put aside your assigned task to counter this unexpected offensive? Would you arrive in time to make a difference? In pushing the envelope of sights and sounds, some compatibility problems exist. Some FOUR PAIR BEATS TWO OF A KIND In the first LONGBOW, you had just one wingman to worry about. LONGBOW 2 gives you responsibility for up to four flights of two. Each aircraft is operated by one of 16 crews in your squad, all of whom get better with experience -if they survive. Play options include instant action, custom single missions, canned single missions, and two dynamic campaigns (the first three play just like campaign missions, but without the surrounding context). One campaign hypothesizes a conflict between UN and Iranian forces in the rugged terrain of Azerbaijan, while the other simulates US Army exercises at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin. Multiplayer functionality is seamlessly integrated into the game, allowing others to join in a single mission or campaign as wingmen, flight leaders, or as copilots sharing the same craft. The NTC scenario even allows head-tohead campaign action, mixing humans and AI crews on both sides. Connections are a snap to set up and work well except for some quirks in the pilot/copilot mode. LONGBOW 2 is a textbook example of how to make a successful sequel.

This predictable start can be exploited by rushing to the front and laying an ambush or by hiding out until the enemy helos have gone home, then running wild in the enemy's backfield. The missions are more realistic if you play them straight, but frequent air-to-air combat is unavoidable. APPEAL: Anyone interested in helicopter sims or realistic flight sims in general. PROS: Oozes realism; gorgeous graphics (especially with a Voodoo card); immersive environment; true dynamic campaigns; thorough multiplayer support; great long-term replayability.

Kim s the state of the art in realistic flight simulations advances, creating a competitive sim from scratch becomes increasingly expensive. Thus, it's no big surprise that F/A-18 KOREA is an evolution of its predecessor, F/A-18 HORNET 3.0.

Designer: Trey Smith Publisher: Graphic Simulations Corporation Dallas, TX (972) 386-7575 www.graphsim.com FAMILIAR TERRITORY The basic simulation engine in KOREA is almost identical to the patched version of HORNET 3.0, with a few minor improvements, so it inherits nearly all of that game's strengths and weaknesses. The amazingly complex avionics modeling of the original continues in KOREA With a dozen different radar modes and multiple weapons-delivery techniques, the simulated combat is satisfyingly deep. Excellent flight-model feel makes flying a joy, whether you're doglighting or sweating through a carrier landing at night. Plane performance is still inaccurate in some respects-especially when pushing the envelope-but only realisin fanatics will probably notice or care. KOREA includes 28 canned singleplayer missions set in a hypothetical second Korean War, 6 multiplayer missions flown over NAS Fallon in Nevada, and the same 6 training flights as its forerunner. All are well-designed, offering a good variety of air-to-air and air-toground action. Although missions are prescripted, randomized enemy placement provides some replay potential.

"**** REVIEW  F-22 AIR DOMINANCE FIGHTER DIFFICULTY LEVEL Euro Raptors SIMULATION/SPACE The Creators of EF2000 Tackle the Ubiquitous F-22 by Denny Atkin ollowing up its 1995 CCWPremier Award-winning EF-2000, Digital Image Design is back with a simulation of another high-tech fighter, the F-22 Raptor. As the fifth F-22 sim to come out in the past year, F-22 AIR DOMINANCE FIGHTER (ADF) has a lot to prove in a crowded market. But with its detailed simulation of the 1'-22's 21stcentury cockpit, a host of engaging missions, and a unique AWACS mode, it's a standout SAFE AT HOME Even if you suffer major systems damage, you may be able to slide to a safe belly landing. UNDER THE CANOPY EP2000 fans who lop into the cockpit of DID'S F-22 will find familiar territory. The high-tech, multifunction display-Isased cockpit has been updated to reflect the F-22's highly automated systems. The virtual cockpit, excellent view padlock, and full-screen MFD views are all tweaked versions of those in EF 2000. If you compare ADF's cockpit to Lockheed promotional literature and articles in Aviation Week, its evident that ils simulation of the real F-22's systems is more authentic than any other sim. Offensive, defensive, situational, and systems MFDs are thoroughly modeled, as are the F-22s radar, infrared search and track, and LANTIRN systems (The latter aren't fitted to the real pure-fighter F-22, but likely will be if the plane is used in air-to-ground role. To succeed at many missions, you'll need to learn how to set the EMCON (EMission CONditions), which control how stealthily the planes systems are operating While the systems modeling is topnotch, the flight model is missing a few bells and whistles. The real F-22 has automatic 2D thrust-vectoring (this points engine thrust up and down to allow you to pull the plane's nose to seemingly impossible angles), but ADF forces you to engage vectoring by holding down the 'Tilde key (-). This makes the plane's response more predictable, but I'd welcome an automatic mode in any updates. Also, the fly-by-wire systems in the F-22 actually change the aircraft's responsiveness to control input depending on your situation; for instance, it tames handling during landing. While NovaLogic's F-22 RAPTOR models this feature, it's absent in ADE. These are the only noticeable omissions in the aircraft modeling. Speed bleed in tums, performance changes at altitude, and the capabilities of various aircraft types all scem right on. Flight models are noticeably more detailed than those in EF2000. pid con Price: $49.95 System Requirements: Pentium 133, 16MB RAM, 70MB hard drive space, 2x CD-ROM, SVGA video card capable of 800x600x16-bit color. sound card, mouse 3D Support: 3Dix, Direct3D Multiplayer: Modem, direct cable, LAN (2-8 players).

"F-22 AIR DOMINANCE FIGHTER  REVIEW Total Air War DF doesn't have an EF2000-style dynamic campaign, but that shortcoming will be corrected this summer with the release of the TOTAL AIR WAR expansion pack. Digital Image Design has been working with U.S. air-campaign planners from Desert Storm and visiting various other air forces to ensure that the TAW campaign simulates actual battle doctrine with unprecedented accuracy. TAW's mission planner will let you alter dynamic campaign missions or create custom missions for the Simulator and Tour of Duty modules. You'll also be able to watch the missions play out from the overview screen, control allied forces from an AWACS station, or jump into the action in the cockpit of an F-22. SIMULATION/SPACE Simulator, single stand-alone missions, Tours of Duty, linked, scripted missions that form campaigns; and Multiplayer missions. The dynamic campaign found in EF2000 is AWOL (see the \"Total Air War\" sidebar for further details). Most of the Simulator missions focus on training. They cover not only basic flight, but also weapons tactics, using the F-22's stealth and proper utilization of wingmen. This is also where you'll find the AWACs missions. In the Tour of Duty section you'll find three campaigns. While EF2000 had a dynamic campaign that generated missions based on the outcome of previous combat, the missions here are prescripted. On the plus side, these carefully crafted missions are generally more interesting than the dynamic campaign missions in EF2000, which quickly grew repetitive. On the downside, once you've worked through the training missions and the 30 Tour of Duty missions, all you can do is repeat your experiences until the campaign discs become available. The missions themselves pose a number of interesting challenges, you'll need to use your smarts, not just brute force, to win many of them. Mission goals usually involve protecting or destroying a particular aircraft or ground target, then returning alive to your departure air base. This can be annoying, because while the AWACS will happily point you to a divert air base if your plane is heavily damaged, landing anywhere other than the preprogrammed base will result in mission failure. ADF includes nine multiplayers missions, with different weather conditions, battle locales, and aircraft armament. They range from guns-only deathmatches to multiple team missions in which the object is to defend your air base while taking out the enemys. Up to eight players can participate, but as of this writing there was no online server along the lines of F-22 RAPTOR's NovaWorld. SPLASH ONE Don't fly through the debris after you shoot down an enemy or you may suffer damage. Command and Control long with the F-22 missions, ADF includes a number of AWACS missions, which will give you a taste of the upcoming TAW expansion pack. Simulating a workstation in an E3 Airborne Warning And Control System, the AWACS missions let you specify air and ground targets for allied functions. You can play an entire mission in realtime strategy mode, specifying routes and directing planes to targets, or you can jump in and out of the cockpits of F-22s in the combat arena. CANDID CAMERA Ever have a mission end suddenly without ever seeing the guy who blew you to pieces? With ADFs Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) module, you can record and replay both singleand multiplayer missions. The replay doesn't use the games 3D engine, but rather a military-style wireframe display. Although its been visually spruced up, it looks very similar to the ACMI displays I saw at Tyndall AFB when I visited for my F-15 familiarization flight in 1994. The graphics and sound in ADF are top-notch. With the game supporting both 3Dfx Glide and Direct 3D (with enhanced texture support for AGP chips like the Intel 740), the graphics in general look superb. There is a bit of pixelation in city areas, and visible seams where some terrain tiles intersect, but these glitches are overshadowed by the lovely desert and rolling hill textures and the transparent fog and cloud effects. Frame rate was good on a P166 running in 2D mode, and silkySmooth on the same system running under Glide with a Pure 3D card. Sound is very good, with wonderful stereo effects. Along with a good manual and thorough online documentation, the package includes Allies and Adversaries, a wonderful book from the editors of World Air Power Journal, giving background on all the planes in the sim. Aviation buffs will love this reference, which could easily sell for $20 itself. ADF isn't without its quirks and omissions. You can't choose your plane's loadout before a mission, you occasionally see objects through hills, and the lack of a mission builder means play will evenitually grow repetitive. Still, this is one of the most addictive jet sims I've played in a long time, and by the time it starts to get stale, the Torah. Air WAR add-on should be around to rejuvenate it. DANAS APPEAL: Anyone who enjoys authentic modern jet-fighter simulations; EF2000 fans looking for a sim with a similar flavor. >PROS: Good flight modeling; engaging missions; detailed aircraft systems; innovative AWACS mode. »CONS: Canned missions combined with the lack of a mission editor limit replay value; thrust vectoring not handled authentically.

"REVIEW HEAVY GEAR SIMULATION/SPACE closing to point blank range and seeing (sort of the rock for what it was. I quickly moved on to the 3D modes, checking the 3Dfx mode first. Heavy CEAR looks considerably betler with a 3D card, but there were several really obvious problems. Thic textures just don't look quite right. Other problems aren't quite so subtle, such as the dust from your wheels as you roll across dry land. In an age where many 3D sims have wispy, semitranslucent smoke and clouds, the dust here appears in the form of big square black pixels rising from the ground, as does smoke from another damaged gear. To top things off, while the frame rate can be quite smooth when you're traversing terrain, the action gets jumpy and starts stuttering as soon as other Gears appear on the battlefield and start firing. The framerate problems make control difficult enough that I end up playing the game in low light (wire frame) mode, as the textures and visual effects aren't worth the hit to playability. My guess is that the designers didn't have time to optimize the graphic effects and performance, because I can't imagine anyone designing them that way intentionally Torna Tibro The inne Pastaraiso m e gent name WARE PIE NAAD2 U by 3Dfx.

There are a wealth of connection options, and the development team has admirably supported multiplayer campaigns instead of simpler deathmatch options. Unfortunately, the performance and graphics problems are compounded by the additional processing time needed to stay connected and in sync. (Activision's HEAVY GEAR FAQ on its Web site admits that the multiplayer features are still at the beta level.) While Internet play supports up to eight players, you'll be limited to four if any players are using modems rather than 11 lines. Most of the comments I've heard about multiplayer HEAVY GEAR have been negative, and my own experiences have been underwhelming as well.

The Al doesn't reject treaties out of hand. They will even take the initiative to ally with you or to open trade dialogue. STRATEGYZ WARGAMES SO HOW DEEP IS IT? Unlike many other real-time games, you don't create units. You start with one town and a population. People are your most valuable resource in this game, but you don't directly increase their numbers. Instead, you indirectly increase population by carefully managing your empire and building a robust standard of living. You can recruit common workers and soldiers or train specialists from your town's population. Specialists are important for the six aspects of empire management in the game: construction, leadership, mining, manufacturing, research, and espionage. With construction workers, you build mines to extract resources, factories to turn the raw materials into finished goods, markets to sell either raw or finished goods, forts to house and train troops, towers of science to research weapons, and war factories to build siege weapons. The factories, mines, and towers require workers to operate. If you build these buildings close to a village, then villagers will automatically move into the buildings to work. If you build the structures far from towns, then you need to settle a new village near your work sites. Economics is a little more complicated. As with the rest of the game, it relies on some serious interdependencies.

"REVIEW . SEVEN KINGDOMS STRATEGY / WARGAMES you see in ACE OF EMPIRES OR WARCRAFT II. Move your cursor over the barracks icon, and you'll see a line of text at the bottom information bar that says \"Barracks.\" That's all I ask for just a little one or two-word description of what I'm clicking on. The complexity of the game, combined with the cumbersome interface, also makes this game seem very tom 3*** OOO MEX) especially since you eventually will engage in combal. Although I've tried to capture SEVEN KINGDOMS as best I could in this review, I've only scratched the surface of the game. I haven't seen a game this complex in a long time. That's a good thing, especially when you consider that this is a real-time game. SEVEN KINGDOMS isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy deep strategy, I recommend you boot this game up yourself, and see just how much it has to offer. A unwieldy at times. While careful study of the manual and tutorial will minimize this feeling, some aspects of the game-such as the nuances of caravans that move from mine to factory to foreign market -can take several games to learn. I don't think difficulty is a bad thing for strategy games, but SEVEN KINGDOMS has a steeper learning curve than many 4x turnbased games. My other gripes with the game come during gameplay. Because units tend to bunch up when attacking, it's hard to select individual units from a mob. It also bothered me that there was no easy way to tell which ruler owned a certain village. Many times, I'd accept a trade treaty with a foreign ruler and then be unable to find his city. I could clearly see a city's name, but not its ruler (colors did help, but including ruler initials would have been better) I also would have liked the game more if there were greater unit variety. A cavalry unit would have added more tactical depth to SEVEN KINGDOMS, HOUS PAPPEAL: Strategy gamers looking for a deep, sophisticated realtime game. PROS: Excellent tutorial; lots of depth; plenty to do; cool fantasy and multicultural aspects. CONS: No campaign play; lack of a scenario editor; unintuitive interface; game is too short. 2011 DIFFERENT STROKES The fact that each nationality has its own look is a great touch.

"WARHAMMER EPIC 40,000: FINAL LIBERATION  REVIEW ***** DIFFICULTY LEVEL Living & Dying In 40K Time STRATEGYZWAR GAMES Finally, a Real Warhammer for the Computer Ork Boyz, you may have to step back for a moment, reassure yourself that you haven't purchased a rap opera of The Lord of the Rings, and then delve into WARHAMMERS online encyclopedia to sort things out by Tim Carter mid the avalanche of realtime clones that seem to have buried the tactical computer strategy game market, it's good to see a product that returns to where the genre begannamely, computerized versions of traditional games that are, by definition, turnbased. WARHAMMER EPIC 40,000: FINAL LIBERATION is the latest computer version of the classic tabletop miniatures game. As such, it enters the market with a lengthy background and history that newcomers may find somewhat intimidating. After all, if you're playing a WWII tactical game, the odds are that you already know what a Tiger tank is and you have some idea of how to use it against those pesky Shermans. But when you're first confronted with a horde of ORK BOYZ IN DA HOOD If you're a dyed-in-the-wool Warhammer fan, you'll be in heaven from the start. If you're new, don't despair; WARHAMMER 40K sports an easy-to-learn tactical interface. WARHAMMER is essentially a tactical wargame, in which you control platoons and squads à la STEEL PANTHERS, albeit in a futuristic sci-fi environment. While you can create random \"quick battles,\" the meat of the game lies in a sequential campaign of scenarios controlled through a strategic map. Between battles, you may decide where to attack next, or, at higher levels of difficulty. respond to enemy counterattacks. The interface for WARHAMMER 40K is highly derivative of earlier successful SSI games. The majority of your screen is taken up by a tactical map, while the right-hand side contains control buttons and a overview of the strategic map. Many of the commands and design clements are highly derivative of other tactical games, as WARHAMMER depends largely on its science-fiction universe for originality. This is by no means a bad thing: I found that the game's greatest strength was its simplicity, and the freedom this gave me to play around with the multitude of original units and unit combinations. As with all good tactical games, combined operations is a key to victory. Depending on the race you are playing, you will have to deal with radically different unit mixes that will greatly affect your strategy once the battle is joined.

Move OK-Sys OK AS UNSIGHTLY AS ORKISH MUGS Having said this, be warned that on a purely visual level, WARHAMMER 40K is perhaps the ugliest game I have seen in ages. I have always been an advocate of strong gameplay over flashy graphics and design, yet I can't lielp feeling that a better color palette and more crisp graphics in the tactical battle screen would have helped this game a lot. This is all the more surprising because once you enter the codex (WARHAMMER'S online reference guide), the background images are quite attractive.

"***** REVIEW EARTH 2140 DIFFICULTY LEVEL Yesterday's News STRATEGYZ WARGAMES Interplay Delivers Too Little, Too Late making buildings vulnerable to enemy occupation, for example. This means you have to consider garrisoning troops inside vital structures, as well as outside. Units in EARTH 2140 are also more inclined to roam than their counterparts in other games, and this is both good and bad. Since fire is an important combat effect, it's nice to see units smart enough to get away from spreading flames. (Though it might have been nice to see a movement Al smart enough to drive around an already burning square in a units path.) The downside is that even if you set your units to a purely defensive posture, they tend to wander about. You end up spending a lot of effort herding units back into the defensive positions you set for them. Another glitch is that your units will kindly move out of the way to let an enemy unit past. BEEN THERE, DONE THAT EARTH 2140 is a good-looking 1996 game, but today, it just seems to be a competent RED ALERT clone. by Martin E. Cirulis ou know you're in trouble with today's highexpectation consumers when the biggest brag on your box is \"Slunning 16-bit color graphics.\" The problem is even worse when your game is a COMMAND & CONQUER clone and you're trying to sell it on those crowded Christmas shelves. This is the unfortunate situation facing Interplay's EARTH 2140. And while it turns out there is more to this game than nice graphics, the ugly Price: $39.95 truth is that the real-time world passed System Requirements: this title by before it even got out of its Pentium 90, Windows 95 development cycle. or DOS 6.x, 16MB RAM, 30MB hard-drive space, 1 MB SVGA-graphics card, SAME AS IT EVER WAS 2x CD-ROM drive, mouse; The biggest hurdle EARTH 2140 faces supports most major is low to get gamers to want to play yet sound cards. another version of C&C-though to be 3D Support: None.

I suppose you could consider this slightly illogical setup a glimpse into anoncnvironmental futuro. From here is the same old build, mine, and demolish gameplay. There's the usual mix of open-ended base-building scenarios sprinkled with quest missions, as well as tuo campaigns with bare-bones stories. However, the scenarios and maps themselves are small and tedious, instead of wide-open and involving. If all of this seems novel to you, let me be the first to welcome you to our planet. The units themselves are varied and interesting, with the UCS concentrating on 'mech-type units and the ED sticking mainly to good old-fashioned tanks. The developers have also done some good things with the basic combat model, HISTORY LESSON There are interesting touches sprinkled throughout Earth 2140, but the sad truth is this: There just isn't cnough originality here to raise this title above mediocrity. The standards of real-time gaming set by such games as DARK REICN and TOTAL. ANNIHILATION have left a game like this behind. These days, you can get away with lacking 3D terrain or a construction kit --but not both. If EAR1112140 had been released before RED ALERT, it would have been revolutionary But today, it seems only like a well-done clone bound to be lost amid the horde of C&C copycats. APPEAL: New players who have yet to play C&C. PROS: Nice graphics; interesting units; adequate Al. »CONS: Nothing to raise it above the level of last year's C&C clones; weak scenarios and maps; some questionable pathfinding. OLD-SCHOOL PLAY Scenario design in EARTH 2140 seems tedious and too limited. CGW MARCH 1998 "

"* * REVIEW. POLITIKA DIFFICULTY LEVEL STRATEGYZ WARGAMES The Great Bland Menace Clancy's Strategy Debut Is Long on Boredom and Short on Gameplay SCRAP MROM Chane 067 ASSASSINATIONS DELORUS MERCER PLANT MELTDOWN POLITICAL CHALLENGE CILALIINGERE TINDERA by Martin E. Cirulis wo things are apparent after your first hour of playing POLITIKA. The first is that 'Tom Clancy is really into himself, and the second is that there are countless other boardgames more worthy of being ported to the PC. What we have here is a competent, yet uninspired, wargame that ranks somewhere between Risk and Axis and Allies in terms of complexity, but far below either when it comes to playability. The Man has won EVENKIA STRIK ATAR TOMEK OLD GUARD The gameplay in POLITIKA is bone-dry. The pacing is also excruciatingly slow, in singleand multiplayer games. Clancy's POLITIKA getting more money or stealing cards, which helps to spice things up. Special cvent cards--a crude simulation of random, realistic and sometimes tumultuous events-also keep things from being too straightforward. Unfortunately, in terms of gameplay, there's not a whole lot more here. For Diplomacy fans, this can be a fun game of wheeling and dealing over single victory points. Anyone else should avoid this coup. N21 G-TER THE TOM SHOW The first hurdle in this game is getting past the 4,732 uses of Tom Clancy's name, the paperback novel by the techno-thriller master himself, and the 15 minutes of fake news footage featuring Clancy muttering about Russian power-play politics following Boris Yeltsin's death. Should you survive this last ordeal, you find yourself facing a nice map of Russia divided into a bunch of provinces tagged with colored markers representing the influence of the cight factions struggling for control. You begin play by placing your two representatives (cute little Monopoly-style icons) on the board. These represent the focus of your political interest. The basic point of the game is to be the one with the most markers and money at the end of a preset number of turns.

"***** REVIEW. MADDEN NFL 98 SPORTS DIFFICULTY LEVEL Underachiever The Usual Action Thrills, But MADDEN Still Misses the Mark delays. Surprisingly, MADDEN 98 shipped two months ahead of schedule without a number of the expected new features. by Dennis McCauley testion: What do Rocket Ismail, Rick Mirer, and Heath Shuler have in common? Answer: They're all high draft choices, yet not onc has lived up to the hype that preceded his arrival on the NFL scene. While we're on the topic, feel free to add EA Sports' MADDEN NFL 98 to your list of pro football letdowns. Sure, it's a good game that's fun to play and is chock-full of cyc candy. But it's not the bulked-up MADDEN that garners had been drooling for Even before last summer's E3, sources at EA Sports hinted that traditionally arcade-oriented MADDEN would be encroaching onto the football sim turf normally dominated by Sierra's FRONT PAGE SPORTS: FOOTBALL PRO scrics. Anticipation ran accordingly high among hard-core sports gamers. The tip-off that there would ultimately be less to MADDEN than met the eye came, oddly enough, in the timing of the game's release. When a developer touts major enhancements to an existing system, veteran gamers have learned to expect delays sometimes significant BUTTON POUNDING One thing MADDEN isn't missing is satisfying arcade play. The action elements are quite challenging, especially at the All-Madden level. While the game supports only four-button controllers, there's enough happening on the field to keep even expert joystick jockeys furiously punching their game pads. It takes practice to be competitive at MADDEN 98. Punting is difficult to master, as is touch passing, which allows players to zing the ball past tight coverage, or loft the pigskin when they need to air it out. Although EA Sports has made a name for itself with eye-pleasing action games, MADDEN 98 is not an especially impressive graphic achievement. In fact, the players look very much like those in last year's version. Their animations, however, are more fluid. Players make diving tackles or high-step into the end zone with a realistic strut. Beginning with this year's Win 95 version, EA Sports has employed an animation leclinique they've dubbed \"V-Poly.\" The English translation is that the players are comprised of multiple sprites, rather than the large, attractive polygons found in other EA products, such as TRIPLE PLAY 98, NBA LIVE 98, and NHL 98. V-Poly works well enough, but it just doesn't compare to player graphics in the rest of the EA Sports line. One thing that is impressive about MADDEN'S graphics is the rendering of the stadiums. Finally, football fans have an opportunity to play in authentic venues While MADDEN shipped without 3D hardware support, a subsequent patch added 3Dfx support, as well as additional graphical enhancements, including on-screen player names. The camera angles in MADDEN 98 are rather limited, and feature only sideline, end zone, or blimp views, which can be set to dynamically track the action. This, however, causes no headaches in the game, since the three views function well. In the just-for-fun department, an authentic-looking Topps football card pops up when a player makes a big play or reaches a statistical milestone. a98 SPORTS Price: $49.95 System Requirements: Windows 95, Pentium 133, 75MB hard-drive space, 16MB RAM, 4x CD-ROM drive, High-color 1MB Direct Draw-compatible video card, DirectX 5.0compatible sound card, mouse.

The transition would be more newsworthy, however, if the utilities worked better. The General Manager feature, for example, allows trading, but only of a brain-damaged varicty in which your opponents offer a mirror image of the players you dangle as trade bait. Put your backup quarterback on the block, for example, and your opponents offer you theirs in return. It's pretty tough to improve your club trading this way. There's no free-agent pool, either, although the player ratings do list salaries. Am I smelling a salary cap feature in next year's version? Let's hope so!

"****REVIEW . FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO '98 SPORTS DIFFICULTY LEVEL Rebuilding Year Sierra's Storied Franchise Finally Falls From Its Lofty Perch by Terry Coleman ritics-come-lately would have you believe that the FRONT PAGE FOOTBALL line has been in steady decline since the publication of the original FOOTBALL PRO. This is pure, unmitigated crap. The series did hit its peak with FPS FOOTBALL PRO '95, but few gaming franchises have endured quite the roller-coaster ride of this one. Last year, FPS FOOTBALL PRO \"97 did a lot toward redeeming the franchise-once you installed the inevitable second or third patch. Problem is, Sierra seems to be in a down cycle with this year's version, and a patch alone may not be enough to rescue it. End-of-Year Stats New Feature Gains Yardage Penalized for Improved arcade play You can actually pass Still too difficult Radio commentary Sounds like radio S talls gameplay CAMS system Still-fluid camera work Defaults to TV view Career play Unique in sports games This is new?

Also, the interface has inexplicably changed for the worse. Sure, it's flashier but it's also more difficult to get around in, especially when you're playing in career mode over the course of several FRONTPCERTS FOOTBALL PRO ILLEGAL MOTION The big question has to be: Where's the 3D hardware support? After all, FPS FOOTBALL PRO '98 is a true physics-based sim, not a stat-freak affair. The game engine moves 22 simulated players around the screen in realtime, and employing some kind of seasons. It's hard to fathom why this latest edition which looks disturbingly similar to its DOS origins-requires so much hardware for so little return: FPS FOOTBALL PRO '97, for example, rums better on a P133 than FPS FOOTBALL Pro '98 runs on a P166 MMX. Wly? Despite the fact that the developers had another year to work out the problem, multiplay over LAN or Internet is still a frustrating series of lock-ups and crashes. The touted arcade mode is still far too arcane to pose any challenge to MADDEN 98. I could go on about other annoyances (and I did: see the accompanying chart), but suffice it to say that FPS FOOTBALL PRO '98 is best viewed as an expansion disk. Whether you should buy it depends on whether you want an arcade game, such as MADDEN, or a serious football sim--and if you believe that Sierra can finally fix the Internet multiplay problems. As for me, I've gone back to FPS FOOTBALL Pro '97— still the best pigskin simulation on the market.

"AMD RANKINGS UPDATE PGL PLAYER PROFILES When you establish the first pro sports league for computer gamers, you've gotta expect thousands of players to show up. So how do you separate the great gamers from the good? By running 'em all through a rigorous month-long qualifying round and evaluating their skillz every step of the way. Using the most sophisticated rankings database on the planet, courtesy of TEN\" the PGL took nearly 1,500 Season 1 entrants and found the top 256. This isn't one of those wimpy ranking systems that just calculates your skill-to-death\" rate. This is the \"two years in the making, two years of real-world usage\" ranking system that all the other gaming sites and services have been trying to duplicate. Based on the logic and methodology of the U.S. Chess Federation system, the PGL ranking engine screams. With every encounter in every match, the PGL ranking machine considers the relative skill level of each opponent, while re-calculating your rank in real-time. See your position in the standings updated instantaneously every time you exit a match. Leaf through the reams of background data to analyze your opponents' (or your own) strengths, weaknesses, preferred weapons, and other tendencies. Or, just gaze enviously at Reptile's and B2's immaculate stats and dream of the day... BJ2 Young Gun of the Strategy Set BJ2 (real name: Ben Helms) may be in his early teens, but that hasn't prevented him from rising to the \"pole position\" in the Red Alert division of the PGL's inaugural season. Although he's only been playing for nine months, BJ2 has risen through the Red Alert ranks on TEN, residing on the top 10 list for some time now. Being seeded #1 in the strategy category of the PGL's inaugural season is just his latest gaming accomplishment. And with four years to go before college rears its ugly head, BJ2 stands to enjoy his pro gamer status for some time to come. \"I'm not sure how my parents would react if I told them I was blowing off college to pursue a pro career as a computer gamer,\" he laughs. His father couldn't gripe too much, since he's the one who got BJ2 started in the online gaming space. \"My dad and I began playing Red Alert last winter from the CD.

In the meantime, B)2 has his hands full competing in the PGL. \"I personally prefer 3-on-3 games of Red Alert on TEN, 'cause they're more exciting, with the cooperation and coordination necessary to work as a team.

While he doesn't think of himself as the very best (yet), he prides himself on being extremely confident in his abilities and aggressive in his approach to the game. \"I know there are players out there who get more recognition, and are considered better than me.

"BOARD MEMBERS The PCL's governing board is a veritable \"who's who\" of electronic entertainment industry luminaries. Beginning with commissioner Nolan Bushnell, the board's illustrious members have each been responsible for some of the biggest hits that this business has ever seen. Here's a closer look at two influential PGL board members: $ 250,000 in cash and prizes! There's a whole lotta cash up for grabs in the PCL. How much cash exactly? Try $30,000+ in each three-month season, for a total of more than $120,000 for the first year. Here's how all the loot Over $20,000 in cash stacks up for a Year 1: BRETT SPERRY: President and CEO, Westwood Studios; President, Worldwide Publishing, Virgin Interactive Sperry co-founded Westwood Studios in 1985. His passion for business and his visionary leadership continues to keep the company at the top of the entertainment software industry year after year. Sperry remains actively involved in product development and has been a key architect and creative force behind several product lines including: The Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore fantasy games, The Kyrandia Adventures, and the Command & Conquer strategy line. \"The PGL is truly as important for the entertainment software industry as it is for the gamers themselves. The industry needs a 'platform' that will raise computer gaming to the level of other competitive sports, and attract a broad consumer market of both participants and spectators. I've been in the computer games business for a dozen years, and the PGL is the most exciting single concept I've encountered during that time.\" Brett Sperry PETER MOLYNEUX: Founder/Managing Director, LionHead Studios Peter Molyneux is one of the best-known names in the international world of computer games. He co-founded Bullfrog Productions in 1987 and single-handedly created a new genre of computer games (the \"god game\" with the release of Populous). Over the past ten years, Molyneux has been responsible for a string of immensely popular games including Powermonger, Theme Park, Magic Carpet and most recently Dungeon Keeper. Cumulative sales of his games are now approaching the ten million mark world-wide. Earlier this year Molyneux left Bullfrog Productions to form a new games development company, Lionhead Studios. '\"Great computer gamers are like great artists highly skilled in a particular craft, and truly a breed apart. The PGL concept is unique and appropriate: bring established and aspiring superstars together, and give them a place that will showcase and reward their talents.

"REVIEW  SODA OFF-ROAD RACING Roll Your Own SPORTS TOYOT BM TAILGATING IN THE DESERT A bumper cam view of the Goodyear Buggy irtually every racing game since Papyrus' INDY 500 has been haunted by one drawback: a limited num. her of tracks. Both wild arcade games and serious simulations tend to wear a bit thin after prolonged exposure to the same corners, the same straights, and the same track idiosyncrasies. Fortunately for those of us who believe you can never have enough of a good thing, Dr. SODA has come to the rescue with a track construction kit that's sure to cure. It's easy to use and offers up results on a par with the game's prepackaged circuits-better, if you spend enough time and effort. The SODA Track Designer is a stand-alone utility that starts you off with a simple oval track floating above a simple grid, as viewed through numerous free-floating cameras. By adjusting nodes on the road surface or on the grid, the track can take on whatever shape you can dream up with whatever elevation changes strike your fancy. Monster jumps? Banked hairpin turns? Figure 8 with a mud bog on one side and a giant chasm on the other? No problem. After you've set the basic layout, you'll want to add some objects. The program takes care of background scenery and cordons off your track area with walls and signs, but the rest is up to you. Now, you can't go and draw an enormous monument to say, Tammy Faye Baker and plunk it down in the middle of the infield, but enough objects are provided to keep most track architects satisfied, including puddles, foliage, grandstands, banners, barns, and silos. In the end, I'd managed to piece together a challenging and I dare say attractive course in just a couple of hours. The downside? Well, though you can drive your new hunk of landscape in solo made right away, for comput, erized competition you're going to have to devote several hours of your computer's time to SODA's \"Learn\" mode, which instills artificial intelligence into the program's cars (though some might argue that they don't get quite smart enough). Fortunately, this lengthy proce dure can be interrupted and picked up again later or run quite inconspicuously in the background while you spend your time on more constructive things like writing a game review. many free-floating 48.03 viewing perspectives you've selected.

"**** REVIEW  YOU DON'T KNOW JACK 3 DIFFICULTY LEVEL Pair of Jacks CLASSICS & PUZZLES Fewer Diamonds, More Clubs in the Latest Hand From Berkeley by Charles Ardai for about two years now; one could hardly blame them if they were getting a little tired of it. Was Shakespeare writing about JACK when he said. \"Play on...give me excess of it, that surfeiting, the appetite may sicken, and so die...Enough; no more; 'tis not so sweet now as it was before\"? Well, not really, but he might as well have been. What's there to tire of? Chceky innuendo, for one thing. Sexual double entendres need not be sophisticated, 15 Ithough both start with \"T\" and end with \"ier,\" any third-grader can tell you that \"ancier\" and \"fun nier\" aren't synonyms. This is why it's a little disappointing to see the very talented folks at Berkeley Systems assuming that making a game fancier automatically makes it funnier, as well The You DON'T KNOW JACK games (of which You DON'T KNOW JACK 3 and You Don't KNOW JACK TV are numbers five and sis) have never been very fancy, but they've always been incredibly, wickedly, naughtily, and uproariously funny. Now come the latest installments, and all of a sudden everythings fancier: 'The visuals are still almost all text, but now the text scrolls and spirals and flows and swooshes on and off the screen: now a right answer causes the playCr's numeral to be showered with dollar bills or celebrated with fireworks, while a wrong answer causes the number to be crushed under a falling anvil. But funnier it isn't. Indeed, the wil that has always been the hallmark of this sterling scrics suddenly seems somehow...strained. Can it be that after writing something around 50,000 smart-alecky trivia questions and silly gag answers, the writers are beginning to run out of ideas? As if the Jiggling weren't Enough (ACR) $3,000 If the producers of \"Charlie's Angels» had cast the show according to its ORIGINAL title, which of the following would you have expected to have seen? 1. cats going bra-less 2 dogs in bikinis 3.rabbits in halter tops 4. bears in tube tops NEW!

Multiplayer Support: Hotseat (1-3 players). Designer: Jellyvision Publisher: Berkeley Systems Berkeley, CA (510) 540-5535 www.berkeleysystems.com  I DON'T KNOW, JACK Another possibility is that the audience is simply becoming bored with JACK. I know that after watching Jeopardy every night for a week, I greet a new episode with somewhat less enthusiasm than I do when I've been away from my 'IV for a while. Computer gamers have been getting a steady diet of JACK $1,500 Y Charlotte $2,000 16000 sao pored FROM SPANDEX TO PLAYTEX Both games are risqué, but you'll find JACK 3 funnier than JACK TV. CGW MARCH 1998 "


"YOU DON'T KNOW JACK TV REVIEW ** ** You Don't Know (Union) Jack YOU DON'T KNOW JACK but they do need to be pulled off with a certain clegancc-otherwise, you're really dealing with single entendre, as in JACK 3's new \"Three Way\" questions, with their orgasmic background sounds (\"Oh, yes!\") and forced sex gags (\"Looks like we've reached our climax»). Crossout gags are also getting tiring: All the JACK games end with parody commercials, but where the first game had some brilliant satiric gems (two years later, I still chuckle over the \"Health food store boy doll\" jingle), JACK 3 and JACK TV club you over the head with ads for a \"urination pad for men,\" a 'IV special called When Dogs Sniff Crotches 2, and a food product called \"Splat: Spreadable Lips, Aruses, and Teats.\" Am I selecting the most extreme examples? Of course I am, and I don't want to be unfair. The average level of the humor is not quite as low as these examples might suggest, though JACK 3 comes off much better-and funnierin this regard than does JACK TV. Inglophiles, keep your eyes peeled for the UK version of You Don't Know Jack, a hilarious adaptation of Berkeley Systems' original game. Translated into the Queen's English for the benefit of our fair cousins across the pond, the questions cover every great British institution from Are You Being Served? to Absolutely Fabulous, with a healthy dose of Beatlemania thrown in. While a knowledge of both Cockney rhyming slang and British soap opera characters would certainly fare you well in this game, even un-Anglicized Yanks should be able to hold their own, as many of the questions are general knowledge. The main difference is that the smart-mouthed announcer, Jack Cake, and the rest of his cronies all have jolly old British accents. But the prudish be warned: Much of the language is even more risqué than in any of the American versions--you know what a bawdy lot those Brits are! --Charlotte Panther CLASSICS & PUZZLES overproduced, JACK IV has its moments, but if you're expecting another change of pace-such as with JACK Movies--you'll likely be disappointed. Maybe by the time JACK 4 rolls around, the writers will have some fresh ideas. We can only hope. You DON'T KNOW JACK 3 DIS OR DAT? Cameplay is the same as in previous installments. For the handful of you who have never played JACK, this means that a snide offscreen host reads multiplechoice questions out loud and one, two, or three players race to buzz in and select answers. Players win points for answering correctly and lose points for making mistakes. Play is divided into three rounds, including a finale (the \"Jack Attack\") in which you have to match pairs of clues that embody some special relationship. Periodically, unusual types of questions crop up, including «Dis or Dat\" questions, in which you have to indicate into which of two categories a series of clues falls (\"Dangerous gas or shampoo?\"); \"Impossible Questions,\" in which you have to guess at a piece of information you couldn't possibly know (\"How many dollars did Smokey and the Bandit gross by 1993?\"); and the everpopular \"Gibberish Questions,\" in which you have to translate a meaningless phrase into the familiar phrase with which it rhymes. Questions can be on any topic in JACK 3; in JACK TV, all the questions are about television shows, with a particular emphasis on cheesy genre shows and sitcoms of the 1970s. Your success at the latter will be greater if you know that the Bionic Woman was a tennis pro before she became bionic and that Archie Bunker once called Twinkies\"WASP soul food.\" But, as with Jack SPORTS (in which most of the questions could be enjoyed by people who were not sports fanatics), JACK 'TV is not particularly nasty or relentless in the minutiae it asks you to recall. JACK IV has a different host from JACK 3, and the change is anything but an improvement. His voice is more grating and his jokes are noticeably lame. (After a question about 'Trapper John's surgeon sidekick, Gonzo, the announcer quips«A Muppet doing surgery. Oh, man, I can see the malpractice suit from here.\" After a question about the eagle on Wonder Woman's costume, he wryly says: \"I stared at her chest plenty and I never noticed no eagle.\") To be fair, some of the animation sequences that introduce each question in JACK TV include very funny parodies of TV theme songs and catchphrases: a Herve Villechaize imitator shouting \"Thir-Teen! Thir-Tecn!\" à la Fantasy Island, for instance In a world that had never known JACK, both JACK 3 and JACK TV would probably be hailed as successes. Alas, we know (and we've played) better. JACK 3 is the more inspired of the two games, and is well worth the purchase despite being APPEAL: For those who enjoyed the first You Don't Know JACK.

ORK GRAND INQUISITOR is the latest revival in the ZORK series from Activision Once again, we visit the Great Underground Empire (or what's left of it), including nostalgic stops at Flood Control Dam #3 and the legendary White House. This isn't just a trip down memory lane, of course; there is also a nefarious plot to foil. The Inquisitor (of the title) is behind it all. His goal is to completely eradicate magic, while at the same time ensure that the population bows in total, mindnumbing obedience to his orders. He is, obviously, not a nice guy. While the game begins in Port Foozle, you quickly end up in the C.U.E., where most of the action takes place. It's here that you find the last bit DAM IT Harking back all the way to ZORK I, you'll have to figure out the controls to Flood Control Dam #3 as you make your way through ZORK GRAND INQUISITOR. turing. ZORK and mouis of magical power and use it, plus your wits, to stop the Inquisitor before his plans come to fruition. You must bring magic back into the world by retrieving three potent artifacts: the fabled Coconut of Quendor, the Cube of Foundation, and the Skull of Yoruck (not to be found in just any old hamlet). In other words, it's the usual hero's quest stuff. \"the HELL TO PAY You don't go this one alone; there are companions of sorts to help you along. One is the spirit of the last Dungeon Master, who currently resides in the famous brass lantern. Three other spirits trapped in totems (a form of punishment) also provide assistance, along with Antharia Jack, a grand TV hero. Over the course of the game, you pay a visit to Hades, meet a two-headed Cerberus (even Hell is downsizing these days), traipse through time tunnels, ride the CU.E. subway, spend some time in a dragon's mouth, and perform a daring jail break, among other feats. The mood here is definitely light, and while the underlying threat is, of course, serious, ZORK GRAND INQUISITOR is played for laughs. There are send-ups and takeoffs on standard adventure fare, and other things as well. If Antharia Jack seems somehow suspiciously familiar, that's deliberate. He may not have raided any arks or found any grails, but you probably know him. In tandem with the lumor, the puzzles are fairly easy to solve. Where the previous game, ZORK NEMESIS, had a lot of tough nuts to crack, ZCI's posers often have obvious answers.

"DENNIS MCCAULEY  SPORTS SportSpot Of Mice and MNF Sulvin rules Thanks to Some Mickey Mouse Decision-Making, OT Sports Is Dead pulled the plug on a promising company such as OT Sports? No way, I think. The game is great. It has the tie-in with the popular Gifford Dierdorf-Michaels prime-time NFL coverage. And gauging from the Net traffic, sales are way up from the game's lukewarm debut in 1996. Besides, we've been through this before with Usenet impostors claiming the inside scoop. Is this he news hit me like a Reggie White sack. There I am, enjoying MONDAY NICHT FOOTBALL 98 as much as any sports game I've played all year. Even after sending my review to CGWSports Editor Jeff Green for the monthly red pen therapy, can't seem to put MNF aside. I realize I'm hooked because I've even signed up with an Internet league, something I almost never find time for. In the league, I'm coaching the Eagles and loving it, despite weekly poundings by online opponents who take sadistic pleasure in my red-zone blues. And then one day I'm cruising the newsgroups, where I stumble across an anonymous message claiming that MNF 98 has been orphaned, and the staff pink-slipped. Could Disney, the original corporate cash cow, really have Despite a round of layoffs that left a skeleton crew in charge at OT Sports, General Manager Deborah Wahler remains upbeat. \"This was primarily a decision by Disney Interactive,\" Wahler says. \"They took a look at their business and decided their core competencies were not necessarily in sports. \"Without critical mass in this business it's very hard to compete,\" Wahler laments. \"EA owns the sports category. Strategically we were a very small busin ess entity — 30 people--and far removed from where Disney's resource base could help us. A lot of businesses reevaluate. I think Disney reevaluated.» Despite the sacking of OT Sports, Wahler gives assurances that Disney will continue to support MNF 98 and its college cousin, HEROES OF THE GRIDIRON, through their natural life cycle. She also confirmed that INDY RACING would be released as planned in time for the Christmas shopping season, where it will be going wheel-to-wheel with Microsoft's CART PRECISION RACING. the end of OT Sports as we know it? Unfortunately, yes. THE BLOODY TRUTH The next day, however, MNF designer Doug Whatley's wife posted a follow-up indicating that OT Sports was indeed bleeding out, but that the game would be supported through the end of the season. Say it ain't sol Appearing on the scene just as the LEGENDS 98 debacle was leaving sports gamers squealing like Ned Beatty in Deliverance, MNF 98 filled a major void in this year's football lineup. After all a good-looking NFL game with realistic strategy options, a dirt-simple play-calling interface, and smooth Intemet play is nothing to sneeze at. So what has Mickey been smoking lately? BARTEN BARELY BREATHING So, is this the end of OT Sports as we know it? Unfortunately, yes. \"As far as Disney is concerned it is the end of OT as an entity,\" Wahler confirms. \"There are some things that may happen for it to survive, but not under Disney ownership. If Disney decides to sell its assets then OT Sports may indeed live.\" (The assets Wahler refers to include the MNF 98 game engine, the INDY RACING engine, and related trademarks.) Meanwhile, at OT Sports' Hunt Valley, Maryland offices, a small, handpicked team-including MNF designer Doug Whatley and producer Russell FOUR AND OUT?

"JEFF GREEN GREENSPEAK Money for Nothing green speak The ramblings of a OGW madman. Blah blah blah blah blah bles blah blah Or, Why the PGL Heralds the End of the World The irst off, I must admit that I have watched beach volleyball on television. The reasons, I think, are obvious. I bring this up only because the Los Angeles Times, a fine metropolitan newspaper, saw fit in a recent article to compare niche sports like beach volleyball with the brand-new Professional Camers' League (PGL), a harebrained scheme by Total Entertainment Network (TEN) to tum gaming into some kind of «professional\" sport, complete with product endorsements and trading cards. The PGL already has its Michael Jordan in Dennis \"Thresh\" Fong, a 20-year-old who has garnered media attention, wona Ferrari, and now has an agent, all because he kicks butt in QUAKE. But I don't know. Sure, it sounds great, and I guess I'd take that Ferrari over my dented 1990 Nissan with the unidentifiable brown stain on the passenger seat. Still, I just can't help fccling that—with all due respect to the hardworking people putting it together—the PCL is one huge case of wishful thinking. Sort of like my fantasy of John Tesh spontaneously combusting feats of athletic prowess and watching a bunch of zombied-out, bug-eyed gamers frag each other to death. Who do they think would actually be interested in watching this stuff, buying PGL T-shirts. or (and this is truly pathetic) swapping PGL trading cards? I know it seems as if people will pay money for anything. Lots of people attend tractor pulls and the Ice Capades and professional bowling toumaments—and that's fine. You won't see me making any snobbish put-downs about the hayseeds and yokels who spend their money on that cultural backwash. I know it's also true that gamers tend to be easily suckered into spending lots of cash on really stupid, money-wasting stuff. But even those of us who own plastic Ferengi cars (hi Denny!) will attest to having some semblance of pride. And paying to watch other people play QUAKE is a line that we as a species cannot afford to cross now. But that doesn't mean you're going to get the same kind of break, no matter how big a badass you are. Chances are you'll just get carpal tunnel syndrome, a bad back, and a lifelong addiction to Taco Bell. And don't kid yourself into thinking that you're missing out on some sort of glamorous lifestyle, either. As someone who's on the inside, let me tell you, the gaming life is not all just good times, parties, and multiplayer naked DIABLO with Tia Carrere. Believe me, that gets old really fast, and Tia is insufferably whiny when she gaming life is not all just good times, parties, and multiplayer naked DIABLO with Tia Carrere. Believe me, that gets old really fast. cheesesta Finally and maybe this is just the dad in me speaking—it seems to me that even worse than the cultural implications is the nightmarish idea that some impressionable young gamer is going to look at this league and think that gaming could actually be a wise career choice. Look, kids, let me give it to you straight: If you're even remotely thinking about quitting school to be like Thresh\" and become a professional gamer,\" suggest you shine a flashlight in your car and see if any light comes out the other side. Because, to put it in terms you might understand, you're a few damage points shy of a frag. Yes, Thresh won a Ferrari. Yes, he did it by playing QUAKE. Yes, he has an agent alone in your apartment, your hairy gut flopping out of your macaroni-andcheese-stained Doom II T-shirt, shouting, \"I'm the King of QUAKE!\" while the repo guys haul away your furniture. And your girlfriend? Well, fragmaster, guess what: She just drove off in a Porsche 911 with her new boyfriend—the one with the education and the job and the bulging stock portfolio. Cet the picture? Good. The Professional Gamers' League is not for you. Get it out of your head. When you say PGL to me, let me retranslate it for you as follows: Please Get a Life. Now you kids get outta here and go do your homework. I'm busy playing QUAKE l here. Papas got a Ferrari to win. Now I'm not opposed to gaming tournaments. Nor am I opposed to making money from gaming. In fact, I hope that Ziff-Davis someday pays the CGW editors enough so that I, too, can say «make money\" from gaming But there's a huge difference between watching professional athletes perform What Jeff docsn't realize is that, beginning next month, CCW will be switching its focus to cover other forms of popular entertainment.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: LONGBOW 2 GAIVIER'S EDGE Three-Ring Circus elicopters can execute a variety of maneuvers, including flying backward and sideways. These aren't merely stunts designed to awe airshow crowds. Instead, such antics form a crucial part of helicopter warfare. If you can't fly sideways, you'll never be able to fully employ terrain masking. If you can't use terrain masking, you won't last long on the simulated battlefield. Sideways flight isn't that difficult. To practice, start any mission. Gently lift off into a hover. Using the pedals, yaw the aircraft until it faces a fixed structure (a building, a tent, or the like). Move toward that structure until you're only a few hundred feet away, then reenter a hover. To slip to the left, gently push the cyclic (that is, the stick) to the left. You'll probably have to add a little collective to prevent your helicopter from descending. The building will appear to slide to the right as you slip left. If you have some forward motion, side flight becomes a little more involved. If the helicopter starts turning, you have to compensate with the pedals. Suppose you're behind a hill. You want to slide left, unmask, shoot the targets, and then run for home. As you slide left, you want to keep the nose pointed toward the enemy so you can fire your weapons as quickly as possible. If the nose begins to bank around either direction, simply apply the opposite pedal. The nose will swing back to the original bearing. HIT THE BRAKES Since the simulated AH-64 doesn't bleed speed very well, be sure to pull the nose well above the horizon to decelerate. Unleashing Hellfire Upon Your Enemies Over Hill, Over Dale We all know that attack helicopters rely on terrain masking, the act of placing terrain features between you and the enemy. A cooperative hill, mountain, or even tree can keep you alive simply by blocking the enemy's view. In most cases, the enemy can't shoot what he can't see. Therefore, when transiting rough terrain, it would scem logical to use the geography to its fullest potential and fly along the bottom of the valleys. The canyon walls form a nearly impregnable barrier of defense, right? Not exactly Suppose you're flying over very rough terrain toward a particular target. The numerous hills and ridges provide several green and inviting valleys to choose from. If you're like me, it won't matter how good the initial reports are, whichever valley you choose will be overflowing with enemy forces. You'll come around some bend to find yourself deluged with shoulder-launched SAMs and AAA. If you're flying along the floor right down the center of the canyon and find yourself in this situation, you might as well be in the middle of a Kansas wheat field. You're stuck in absolutely the least protected spot within the valley. Real-world AH-64 pilots are taught to fly along the top of a ridge, just below the ridge line. A few feet of mountain blocks sight just as well as several hundred with an extra benefit: If the current valley becomes too hot, you simply apply some collective, kick in some pedal, and cruise over the ridge into the next valley. With a few tons of rock between you and the enemy, you can resume your course.

Capable of maneuvering at 13g's at supersonic speed, the missile has several launch modes which depend on the seeker type, the types of obstacles present, and the number of available designators. When using Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) to target weapons in an environment with multiple designators, the missile can be ripple-fired at multiple targets (each marked by a different laser designator) at onesecond intervals. In a single-designator environment, the missile may be rapid-fired at different targets about every eight seconds. Using Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) mode, the missile will either clear high (LOAL-H) or low (LOAL-L) obstacles while seeking the coded laser designation. After locking on, the missile dives and strikes the target. MARCH 1998 CGW "

Unfortunately, conquest of the world isn't often achieved without military conflict. This month's strategies focus on the nitty-gritty of combat-preparation and engagement --because we all know that it's always more satisfying to utterly destroy a foe than to beat him with a peaceful Wonder. The Basics Before engaging in combat, it's a good SO WHAT IF IT'S UNFAIR Beat on enemy villagers and houses first to destroy your opponent's idea to move your troops to one central capacity for waging war location and then divide them by type, such as cavalry, infantry, archers, and catapults.

To do that, all you need to the other player at this early juncture of the game. do is hit the number key for the infantry, target the elephants, and then quickly hit the number key corresponding to the archers. You could then pull them a safe distance away and attack the elephants. Grouping units prior to an offensive also allows you to better coordinate a combined-arms attack. You can group a small diversionary force to assail an enemy's walls, and then hit the number key to bring in the archers and, later, the catapults, all without having to move the screen from the targeted wall. Combined with the use of waypoints, The Power of Religion riests are wildcard units that can turn the tide of battle. The first rule in using priests is to use them en masse.

"GAMER'S EDGE STRATEGY & TIPS Myth How to Win at the Most Difficult Strat Game of the Year by Greg Fortune \"The skillful commander takes up a position in which he cannot be defeated and misses no opportunity to overcome his enemy. Thus, a victorious army always seeks battle after his plans indicate that victory is possible under them, whereas an army destined to defeat fights in the hope of winning but without any planning.\" -Sun Tzu, The Art of War f you want to be successful while playing MYTH, memorize this quote.

We'll use these pages to help beginning Menu playcrs who are having trouble making it through the levels and keeping more than one or two unils alive. We'll cover controls, tactics, and formations, and we'll walk you through the Crow's Bridge mission in order to demonstrate these principles in action.

"MYTH GAMER'S EDGE perspective on the action. If you find these view controls awkward, try remapping them to different keys. Whatever you do, make sure you can move and twist the view at will. Command & Conquer Dark Reign\" How do you keep all of these units under control in the middle of a battle? The answer lies in custom formations. The name is misleading, because these formations have nothing to do with how units are arranged on the battlefield. Custom formations, which I call groupings, have to do with assigning hotkeys to a group of units. Let's say that I want to divide my units into two groups, each composed of warriors, archers, and dwarves. I'll assign one hotkey to each tactical group and another to each type of unit in that group. Now I can select an entire group, tell it to move to a spot on the map, and quickly organize the units in that group by using the hotkeys and custom formations. If the enemy is closing in and I don't want the dwarves to bomb my own units, I can hit the hotkey for the dwarves and then hit the spacebar to tell them to stop. This is a lot more efficient than trying to click on the dwarves in the middle of a fight. Birds of a Feather Die Together There's one last thing I want to cover before we look at our Crow's Bridge example: grouping units. The best thing you can do with any of your units is to group it with another unit that complements its strengths and weaknesses. Archers should never be left alone with out some sort of escort, preferably warriors or berserks. Melce units benefit greatly by having archers around to weaken the enemy before they can close to fighting range There is one unit that gets the ugly stepchild award, and that's the dwarf. Dwarves are surly, loudmouthed, and very careless about where they throw their bombs. If you are going to group dwarves with other unit types, particularly those that like to suddenly run out into battle, you'd better keep the little buggers on a short leash.

"MARTIN CIRULIS what hwor, IME What's the Deals with... Netgaming Fantasies? enter the gamer's chat area. Now, part of this is. without a doubt, due to some really bad multiplayer code being put out by game companies, as \"Net capability\" is still a big, last-minute gim. mick thrown into games by nervous execs. But the rest of the problem is just the simple fact that regardless of what Bill Gates says, the Internet is still a rough place for software, and most of us are asking our proctologist to help us find our he dust is just beginning to settle on ULTIMA ONLINE, and regardless of what else can be said about Origin-a company that lived the good life off of two years of press releases and then handed an unfinished land over to the rabid Cyber-cast of The Lord of the Flies without even a \"Beware, evildoers, the Avatar is watching\" I think some very important lessons can be learned from the experience, about the clash between the average consumer's expectations of Netgaming, and about the harsh realities of actually trying to play a game over the nully hodgepodge of misanthropic technology known as the Net. After watching the ULTIMA affair unfold while the rest of the Netgaming industry teeters on the brink of bankruptcy. I have come to realize that the problem lies in the nature of the beast, as well as in the greedy hearts and overly optimistic minds of game providers. The whole thing is akin to Ford showing a con cept \"car of tomorrow\" in the '50s and all of us expecting to fly to work the next year. It just ain't happening. We've all been sold such a bill of goods about how cool and capable the Internet is that we expect it to work as smoothly as it does on TV. The ugly truth is that for the most part, the Net as it is today is just not capable of supporting the kind of smooth gaming experience the aver age consumer is looking for, and expecting. If you thought fooling around with your config files was tedious in the pre Win-95 days, just wait until you have to futz around for hours trying to figure out why your ultracool, new Net-capable game keeps crashing your system every time you ( Most of us are asking our proctologist to help us find our ISP.77 There are plenty of non-3D blastfest Netgames out there that are actually designed for the way the Net is now instead of how we would like it to be. Activision's NETSTORM may not offer the alternative lifestyle thrill of an Elf discussing the price of leather shoes with an Orc, but on the other hand, it works-and it brings out what the Net is good at-connectivity and continuity. It's a better use of your dollars to play a good game that works, than to sit around and gripe because your flight sim looks like a slide show. The bottom line is that, despite what any PR guy or overenthusiastic designer might tell you, Netgames are not a Plug-and-Play item yet, nor will they be until the basic technology stabilizes and we are all connected to fast, flat-rate servers through our fiber optic cable modems. You may have your 50 something modem and your free game server, but it's not doing you much good if your ISP is charging you by the minute to route your data through a 200 baud cheese grater in Pakistan. Sitting there screaming at your fellow strategy gamers to hurry up because your meter is running, or swearing at designers because you've discovered that \"action game\" translates to \"lag fest\" is just not going to do much good. Do your reading, figure out what your Net connections are actually capable of, and then decide if you want to pay somebody to partici. pate in what is still a grand experiment. Once you come at Netgames with your eyes wide open, then you can let the coolness that really exists overwhelm you, instead of moving from one disappointing experience to another, simply because all you've known is the hype. ISP. Hell, it's only been a couple of years since modems have been able to speak the same protocol, the 56KB standard exists only on paper right now, and yet we're complaining that we can't play graphically intense games with our buddies from Tibet without a patch or two. Anybody thinking seriously of spending server dollars on gaming should keep in mind two things: 1) That any Netgame (or Netgame service) more complex than Battleship should be considered, as should the Internet itself, a work in progress; and 2) You can't always get what you want, but sometimes you get what you need. In other words, be prepared to suffer through con stant patches, and be open-minded enough to give a simpler game a chance, despite the fact you came for the glamour.
