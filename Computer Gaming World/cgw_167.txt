"JOHNNY WILSON Production Panacea? How Completion Bonding May Reduce Product Slippage veryone complains about prod uct slip page, but some smart people who started out with the film industry are actually attempting to do something about it. If the concept of \"comple tion bonding\" catches hold, as it has in the film industry, it could poten tially be a \"win-win situation for developer and publisher alike. Better yet, it's potentially a \"win-win-win\" situation, where even those of us on the consumer side get included in the victory equation. Completion bonding is a standard practice in the film industry. It began when the studios decided that certain directors weren't worth risking a full production budget on because they were too difficult, eccentric, or perfectionist. First, insurance companies entered the picture by providing a Surety for the completion of filming or editing by a certain date. In this way. studios would get all or most of their production budget back if the unreliable producer or director didn't get the film in the can on time. Next, some of the completion-bond special ists realized that they could make even more attractive packages by packag. ing alternative funding for the produc tion budget along with the insurance for delivery date. Today, many motion pictures would not be produced if it were not for completion-bond fund. ing. You would also be hard-pressed to step onto the set of many film shoots without finding the representa for hitting the numbers and deliver reviews back to the developers, tive of the completion bond company ing the product on time. adding additional development time close at hand.

I wonder how many letters you will get from outraged gamers thinking they are about to get zapped once again by some vaporware product. However when I read your review of \"RED BARON II\" I realized the joke was on me. Sierra is releasing a BETA of a PATCH!!! What has this once fine company come to? Why hire quality assurance testers when there are millions of stupid suckers willing to pay to do the job? The other irony is that this is the first of several patches. I wish my company could ship its scrap also. Then we could crow that we had a 100-percent yield. Sierra should take a tip from the gaming public. Clean up your games or you will be wondering how you could fall so far so fast. Thomas Ingham via the Internet AND WHILE THEY'RE DOWN... In your April issue, Johnny Wilson wriles, \"One things for sure, we don't have the term Eurotrash' to kick around anymore.\" May I suggest \"Sierratrash\" as a suitable replacement? --Nevin Longardner via the Internet MORE LORDS Let me start by saying I love your magazine, and have just renewed my subscription. However, I have one major complaint. It is with regards to your review of the new Sierra game LORDS OF MAGIC. I noticed an ad for LOM] in three consecutive issues--one of those big fold-out jobs with three panels. It looked sharp. So, I waited for a review. The game hit the store shelves, and still no review, yet that month's mag had that gorgeous ad again, the real expensive one, nice thick stock, etc. I fig. ured I'd wait for the review to buy it, but when I picked up the next issue (now the game had been on the shelves for a good month and a half) there was still no review. Well, I bought it, and of course, it sucked...hard. Then, low and behold, at least two full months after the game shipped, there was the review! It said, basically, that the game sucked. Conspicuous by its absence though, was that pretty three-panel ad. In its place was a much cheesier one-pager. Now, I am not accusing you of anything here. But it certainly looks bad for a review of a muchtouted product to be so delayed, and then for it to be so horrible. I am not so stupid as to think advertising plays no part whatsoever in your reviews (or the timing thereof), but this one slapped me in the face, and I am a little disappointed. Michael Bucknam via the Internet LORDS OF MAGIC You listed the system requirements for LORDS OF MACIC as a PIOO (CGW#165). In another mag that my friend had it was a P75. In yet another mag it was a P133.

"LETTERS ZIFF-DAVIS INC Chairman and CEO Etic Hippeau Chief Financial Officer Timothy O'Brien (GUI) software just like the 305s. Your review knocks off three stars for the 305s because the interface pops up whenever the volume is adjusted, even in the middle of gameplay. If that's the case then they certainly deserve it, but I find that odd because the 495s don't have that problem. The pop-up feature is automatically disabled whenever a full-screen application (i.e., a game) is running. Are you sure you got that right? -Thomas).

Wangberg Senior Vice Presidents Rayna Brown (Human Resources) Daryl R. Otte (Planning and Development) Your insinuation rankles us a bit, but it's a fair question. Print publishing requires about three months from the time we get a game to the time you read our review. We could do it faster if we were distributed like a weekly, but that would cost far more than CCW makes, so that's not possible. This may be the Information Age. but most magazines get onto a shelf or into a mailbox because of truckers. Our editors weren't wise to Sierra's ad plan, because editorial and advertising are distinct operations at CCW. The sales department doesn't influence editorial coverage, and the editorial department doesn't rush or delay coverage to please an advertiser So why the coincidence? Advertisers have a budget, and they plan their expenditures carefully. Most games don't last on retail shelves longer than eight weeks. and consequently most marketing plans expire before that time.

Altec's USB-CUI software does have a control to enable/disable the pop-up menu. Once disabled, you're spared the drcaded pop-up during gameplay. We missed the disable switch because it was buried under several menu layers and cryptically named. Given that Altec has a provision to tum off this dubious feature (which should be disabled by default), we think it is appropriate to take the highly unusual step of revising the 305s\" rating to four stars. They do sound terrific and are attractively priced. Having the Dolby imaging modes (Pro-Logic, AC-3/Dolby Digital) may become more useful for gamers over time.

"The Latest News From the Computer Gaming World READ.ME SIMPLICITY Reigns Edited by Charlotte Panther (CPanther@zd.com) Maxis Rebuilds SimCITY 3000 on the Series' Solid Foundation ST f you're a SIM City fan, you're probably aware that a new version of the game-the first in four years-is under construction. The big news, however, is that Maxis has decided to keep the game's design closer to its original roots. When we saw SIMCITY 3000 at E3 last May, the design included 3D naviga tion. So, once you'd created your city, you would be able to walk around in it. When the design team began to implement gameplay, however, the 3D approach proved too restraining. To do the game in 3D, the designers would be forced to skimp on the level of detail that made previous SimCity games so magical. Maxis also worried that to truly appreciate the rich graphic detail in a 3D SIMCITY, you would need a really hot system-possibly one out of reach for the mainstream SIMCITY audience. Instead, SIMCITY 3000 will be a highly detailed 2D envi. ronment--four times the size of SIMCITY 2000-that will feature 3D-rendered buildings with four levels of zoom and a rotating view that will allow you to see all four sides of the cranes, smoke billowing from chimneys, and construction workers walking around. In suburban, residential areas, you'll see school buses, and nannies pushing baby strollers. T he game will offer different levels of complexity, and Al advisors will be there to provide hints. A news ticker will provide messages and inform you of meetings: and this time, you can have your advisors take care of the tedious duties. At higher levels, you'll find yourself dealing with petitioners, who help you with the more advanced aspects of city management. You'll interact with neighboring lowns via your petitioner if you don't want a landfill in your own town, for example, you can pay to have the garbage sent to another city. Sometimes your decisions will have a positive impact on your town-building a university may boost the population, for example. If, on the other hand, the government offers you a wad of cash to place a toxic-waste dump in your city, you can be the longterm effects won't be good.

I also noticed --for the first time in a science-fiction strategy game-units whose armor and facing made a real difference. The Al won't let you sneak up behind it, and you can sell, salvage, and strip various mechs to create the exact configuration you want. The combination of point-and-click and drag-and-dump interfaces works well, and the addition of realistic features such as collateral damage when mechs are in proximity of explosions and airstrikes is a great feature.

"READ.ME In the Works News Rage With the Machine TalonSoft Moves Into the Real-Time Arena mong strategy gamers, TalonSoft is known for creating hard-core turn-based wargames. However, the company is branching out to create some games that the gaming world's non-grognards will want to play. One of the first of these titles is a real-time strategy game called TRIBAL RAGE. No doubt you've seen the ads, the ones with the bikini-clad biker babe saying, \"Biker boobs my ass!\" Well, TalonSoft is obviously trying to inject some sort of personality into their game, and at a certain level, they succeed. If you're expecting a C&C clone, you'll be surprised. This game has a style all its own. TRIBAL RAGE's look is a cross between REDNECK RAMPAGE and Mad Max. You can play as one of several tribes, among them biker babes, dinosaur-riding amazons, and muscle car driving cyborgs. There isn't anything too farfetched in this game as far as weaponry goes; most of the weapons are variations on machine guns, flamethrowers, mines, and missiles. The vehicles are likewise mundane, with bikes, '50s-style sedans, and pickup trucks. The exceptions, of course, are the amazon's dinosaurs. If COMMAND & CONQUER's gameplay was consid: ered tactical, TRIBAL RAGE's is almost squadlike, by virtue of more direct unit-controls and smaller num. bers of troops. You can direct the fire of units with your cursor, just as in CONQUEST EARTH. Unlike in other real-time strategy games, TRIBAL RAGE's units do not have unlimited ammo. In fact, some units sometimes have only three or four shots of a certain weapon, necessitat ing frequent reloading. Units also have multiple weapons, and you have to choose which weapons a unit will use (the Al currently won't cycle through its weapons-it uses only the last weapon you selected for it). This means that there is more unit micromanagement in TRIBAL RAGE than in other real-time strategy games. Another thing I noticed in the TRIBAL RAGE alpha was that maps have power-ups, including first-aid kits and weapon caches. And while the graphics aren't state of the art, there are plenty of other things to catch your attention, such as the ability to design your own vehicles, warriors, and maps. TalonSoft plans to debut this title sometime in early May, so it should be out by the time you read this. Watch for our review in the coming months.-Elliott Chin >> Despite the fact that Disney Interactive decided to drop its OT Sports division last year, the developers of MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL and HEROES OF THE GRIDIRON are still alive and kicking. Doug Whatley, executive producer of the MNF series recently announced the formation of Break Away Games, a new company comprised of the core development teams from the former OT Sports group, including the key developers responsible for MNF, HOTG, and INDY RACING LEAGUE. Breakaway is currently in negotiation with several publishers and expects to announce more detailed plans shortly. Check out www.breakawaygames.com for more information. >> LucasArts has announced its second realtime strategy game, FORCE COMMANDER. This game is closer in scope to TOTAL ANNIHILATION and STARCRAFT. dealing more with ground combat on a tactical scale. Our guess is that you'll be able to command AT-ATS and squads of stormtroopers, along with other Star Wars mainstays. such as the lack of a reverse gear, nonfunctioning keyboard com mands, and an interface that adds needless difficulty. Nonetheless, this is the best tank simulation in nine years. Patrick C.

"READ.ME Mightier. and More Magical Five Years Later, New World Computing Roars Back With MIGHT AND MAGIC VI much better than those in DAGGERFALL OF LANDS OF much better than those in DAGGERFALL OG LANDS OF LORE II. In the game, you'll constantly need to use both turn-based and real-time action, and learning when to switch from one mode to the other will play a key part in combat strategy. For S trand OIATALOl10000 AGB The computer role-playing renaissance is kick. ing into high gear with the release of MIGHT AND MAGIC VI: THE MANDATE OF HEAVEN, the latest, long-awaited installment of New World Computing's acclaimed fantasy RPG series. The game, due out by the time you read this, still wasn't finished as we went to press, but we've been playing a late beta to let you know what to expect New World Computing has completely overhauled the game's engine, gameplay, and interface. If you played any of the previous M&M games, prepare yourself for some huge changes. The new game incorporates two new 3D graphic engines (for indoors and outdoors, respectively) that provide contin. uous, real-time first-person movement through the gameworld. It's a vast improvement over previous efforts, but, unfortunately, the game does not support 3D accelerator cards, and the often pixelated graphics do not approach the smooth elegance of games like QUAKE II. Still, they're certainly the best first person graphics in a role playing game to date of classes has been reduced from 10 to 6 (gone now are the Robber, Ninja, Barbarian, and Ranger), and human is the only race. Also, active party size has been cut from six to four. Don't mistake these cuts for a reduction in the game's complexity, though. A brand-new skill system more than makes up for the losses by giving your party members countless ways to develop. Entry into the game has been made more accessible to novices, but the depth is still there, as individual characters will actually have more variables than before. Also, New World Com puting has completely overhauled and beefed up the game's magic system. Many of the series' classic spells are the same, but now there are even more of them, and they've been divided into nine schools: Fire, Water, Air, Earth, S pirit, Mind, Body, Light, and Dark. But, amazingly, despite all the changes, the game still looks, feels, and plays like classic MIGHT AND Magic. With the same mix of high-fantasy questing, dungeon crawling, world exploration, and slightly dorky humor, MIGHT AND MAGIC VI is com pletely faithful to the spirit and feeling of the series. Look for a full review next month-assuming that the game actually ships. Jeff Green instance, there is no longer a \"Run\" button in turn-based mode so the only way to flee is to hit the toggle and physically run away. But this is not a DIABLO-like clickfest, either. You'll never make it past the game's first goblin camp without engaging in strategic turn-based combat. A number of changes have been made to charac. ter advancement and party formation.

"READ.ME In the Works Russian Roulette l-Magic Takes a Chance With Retro Gaming nteractive Magic's first foray into the action genre is a surreal adventure from an obscure group of developers in Russia. They've had little influence from the American world of gaming, and l-Magic wants to keep it that way. VANGERS, the group's debut title, is a top-down, vehicle-based action game. At first glance, the game may look like any other side-scrolling racing game, but it's definitely a cut above the ones you're used to. The first thing that strikes you is the game's organic look. All the vehicles, monsters, and weapons have strange alien names and look as if they were created from alien vegetation. The gameworld is also bizarre, filled with colorful environ ments and peculiar enemy cars. Yes, the vehicles may sound like weird animals in the setup screen, but in the game they look and drive like souped-up hot rods. 1-Magic points out that the world is interactive and completely flexible. You won't have missions as such, instead, you'll drive around until you see something that you want to pursue, then you'll hop into a portal and warp to a new world. Of course, with a variety of creatures and enemy vehicles in hot pursuit, reaching portals and uncovering new locales and items isn't as easy as it sounds. With VANGERS' retro gameplay and look, Interactive Magic is trying to make sure this game stands out. You can see for yourself when it ships in June. -Elliott Chin PIPELINE Abyss: Incident at Europa Sound Source 0398 Age of Empires II Microsoft 04 98 Agents of Justice MicroProse 03 '98 Apache vs. Havoc Empire 03 '98 Asheron's Call Microsoft Turbine 04 '98 Axis & Allies Hasbro 03 '98 Battle of Britain 1940 TalonSoft 03 '98 Birth of the Federation MicroProse Q3 '98 Blackstone Chronicles SSI/Legend Q4 '98 Centipede Hasbro 03 '98 Creatures Il Mindscape 0498 Descent Ill Interplay Q4 '98 Dalkatana Eidos/lon Storm Q3 '98 Duke Nukem Forever GT Int./3D Realmis 04 98 Earthworm Jim 3 Interplay Q2 '98 Extreme Warlare Red Orb 03 98 European Air War MicroProse Q4 '98 F-22 Total Air War DID 03 '98 Falcon 4.0 MicroProse Q3 '98 Fighter Duel 2 Ocean 03 98 Fighting Steel SSI Q3 '98 Flanker 2.0 SSI 03 '98 Freedom in the Galaxy Avalon Hill 03 '98 Galactic Mirage Virgin 03 198 Grand Prix Legends Papyrus 02 '98 Gualdalcanal Avalon Hill 03 98 IA-10 Warthog Interactive Magic Q3 '98 -War Ocean 02 98 Jagged Alliance Il Sir-Tech Q2 '98 Jane's F-15 EA/Jane's Q2 '98 Jeopardy Hasbro 03 98 King's Quest: Mask of Eternity Sierra 04 '98 Klingon Honor Guard MicroProse Q4 '98 Luftwaffe SSI 04 '98 Mastermind Hasbro 03 '98 Mech Commander MicroProse 23 '98 MechWarrior III MicroProse/FASA 01 99 NHL Power Play '98 Virgin 03 98 Pacific Tide Star Q2 '98 People's General SSI 03 198 Phantom Ace Virgin Q3 '98 Prey 3D Realms Apogee 01 99 Privateer 3 EA/Origin Q4 '98 Quest For Glory V Sierra 02 '98 Reach for the Stars II MicrosofUSSG 0 2 99 Requlem 3D0/Cyclone Studios 03 98 Return Fire 2 MGM 03 '98 Return to Krondor Sierra 04 98 Revolution GT Interactive/Fenris Wolf Q3 '98 Screamer 3 Virgin 03 98 Screamin' Demons Activision Q3 '98 Secret of Vulcan Fury Interplay 03 98 Sid Meler's Alpha Centauri EA/Firaxis Q3 '98 SimCity 3000 Maxis 02 98 Smart Games 3 Hasbro/Smart Games Q3 '98 Spitfire Microsoft 04 98 Squad Leader Avalon Hill/Big Time 04 '98 Star Control 4 Accolade 04 98 Slarship Troopers MicroProse 03 '98 Star Trek: First Contact MicroProse 03 '98 Stratego Hasbro 03 '98 Team Apache SSI Q3 '98 Tomorrow Never Dies MGM Q4 '98 Ullima Ascension EA Origin 04 98 Ultimate Civ Il MicroProse 03 98 Unreal Epic/GT Interactive 03 98 WarCraft Adventures Blizzard 03 '98 Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate SSI 03 98 Whistling Death Big Timel Avalon Hill 03 '98 The X-Files Game Fox Interactive 03 98 THIS JUST IN STAR WARS REBELLION At long last, the Star Wars Strategy game we've been waiting for has arrived. My first impression of this game was that it looks extremely complicated. The manual and poster, though, go a WARM long way toward trying to explain the game. You are the leader of either the Empire or the Rebel Alliance, and you must control all manufacturing, diplomacy, and military aspects under your command. This means going to each sector you control and specify: ing what gets built, which ships go where, and whom and where your troops fight. You'll also assign characters for special missions. This game requires a lot of micromanagement, and strategy buffs should have a grand time trying to juggle all the tasks of galactic command. Look for out for a full review next month. --Elliott Chin LucasArts, (800) 985-8227 www.lucasarts.com Windows 95 CD-ROM BPLTTIITID CGW JUNE 1998 "

"PREVIEWS THE X-FILES Your Best Source for the Hottest Games in Development I Want to Believe Call Agent Mulder! THE X-FILES Is One FMV Adventure We Just Might Like by Jeff Green ou don't exactly have to be one of the Lone Gunmen to be skeptical about THE X-Files computer game. Games based on popular TV or movie franchises are notori ously crappy, usually made by people who just want to cash in on the license and who have no real clue as to how to make a good game. And when the series is as brilliant and dynamic as The X-Files, there's even more reason to scoff. How could any game hope to capture the series' atmos. phere, suspense, and complexity-without sullying the name and disappointing longtime fans? But maybe, just maybe, somebody has gotten it right. THE X-FILES, due this summer from Fox Interactive and Hyperbole Studios, is an FMV adventure game that has so much going for it-including the direct involvement of many of the series' stars and creative team-that, for once, we're actually going to be surprised if it does suck. In addition, the game's creators talk a good game about making a good game, one with the kind of gameplay and plot that should appeal not just to fans of the TV show, but to hard-core adventure gamers as well. LITTLE GREEN MEN THE X-Files game, sprawled over seven CDs (for both PC and Mac), is nothing less than a brand new, full-on \"episode\" of the series, featuring all-original footage of Agents Mulder, Scully, Skinner, and other characters from the TV show, portrayed by the real actors, The new story is set in the time between seasons three and four. The time period when, in the series' uber-plot, the alien colonization plans were just beginning to unfold (as much as anything unfolds on this show), and Mulder's mysterious informant, X, was still alive (he's gunned down in the Season 4 opener). In the game's opening cut scene, we see Mulder and Scully in an old warehouse, where they are fired upon by a group of typically menacing-looking suit guys. The scene cuts abruptly to the familiar TV show credits and theme, and then the game begins. You play Agent Craig Willmore, a Seattle-based FBI agent who is assigned by Assistant Director Skinner to track down Mulder and Scully, who, he informs you, have been missing for four days after checking in to a local motel. Finding Mulder and Scully is only the beginning of the story, however-a story that, we are told, will work into the series' mythology storyline. Fox Interactive is understandably keeping a lid on the specific plot details for now. Series writer Frank Spotnitz conceived the storyline, and though he may not be as well known as Chris Carter, David Duchovny, or Gillian Anderson, he hap. pens to have written or cowritten a great many of the series' important \"mythology\" episodes. This means that anal-retentive X-Files watch: dogs need not panic that the game will breach the series' continuity. CGW JUNE 1998 "

(Try not to get worked up when Dana Scully starts talking to few surprise guests. Although Fox Interactive didn't want to con firm or deny it, the name William B. Davis-the actor who portrays the Cigarette-Smoking Man-is listed prominently in the game's opening credits, so you can draw your own conclusions there. Unfortunately, Krychek (a.k.a. \"Weasel Boy\") is apparently not in the game, depriving fans the chance to shoot that one armed bad boy dead once and for all. ITT STORY Why would Muider and Scully have called this location? ju HEY SCULLY, WANT TO INTERACT? The gameplay seems most reminiscent of Activision's great, underrated SPYCRAFT of a couple years back, with inventory based puzzles, branching interrogations, computer sleuthing, and even a couple of action sequences.

These details will go unnoticed by many, but they are there for the rabid fan who seeks them out. HISTORY TRUST NO ONE How THE X-Files ultimately plays out as an adventure game is still shrouded in mystery, but as another chapter in the series mythology, it's going to be just about impossible to ignore. The credibility lent to the project by the involvement of all the series' key players means that, along with the upcoming X-Files movie, we at least get more of the show to watch. And any game that lets us talk with Dana Scully while she's wearing nothing but a flimsy hospital gown is a game that we simply have no choice but to play. 'm with the Bureau. UM, MARRY ME?

"PREVIEWS WARGAMES Genre: Strategy. ETA: Q2 '98 Developer: Interactive Studios Ltd. Publisher: MGM Interactive A Modern Myth MGM Delivers a WOPR for Real-Time Strategy Fans by Tahsin Shamma MAR hen I first heard about WARGAMES, my first thought was that it was going to be some hokey adventure game based on the movie. I'm a big fan of the movie, and I was a little worried that this was just yet another attempt by a Hollywood company to milk a franchise for a mediocre game. Well, I'm happy to say that's not the case. WARGAMES is a real-time strategy game that delivers the 3D action of Myth, the technology of C&C, and an interesting twist on resource management. You might think that this would lead to a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none situation, but WARGAMES manages to keep the best of those games without diminishing the overall appeal. UHARLES THE FUTURE IS NOW The WOPR is given the more technologically advanced units throughout the game The game occurs 20 years after the movie. The WOPR (War Operations Plan Response) computer has deduced that humanity is the cause of all war and therefore must be destroyed. Despite the similarities to a certain James Cameron movie with a rampaging cyborg, WARGAMES stays close to the recogniz. able universe of modern-day weapons. While the human forces of NORAD are equipped with tanks and infantry, the WOPR forces are more technologically advanced, with combat walkers and droids. PLAY TIME Once the game starts with a familiar question-\"Shall we play a game?\"---you are given a choice between two campaigns: NORAD or WOPR. AS NORAD, you utilize an array of human, air, and armored units to stop the genocidal machinations of the WOPR. Through a series of 15 missions (there are 15 for the WOPR side as well), you'll be presented with RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES You may start humming Wagner as your helicopters cross the battlefield.

When I-WAR lands on U.S. shores this sum. mer, it will sport a number of changes from the original release. The most obvious is its new moniker, INDEPENDENCE WAR. (\"l-WAR\" was already trademarked in the U.S.) In addition, the game will feature Glide support for 3Dix Voodoo and Voodoo2 graphics cards, as well as a new arcade mode for less serious players. They paint their ships with garish graffiti designed to taunt their Commonwealth foes. All of this is set up in what has to be the magnum opus of all intro films-a full 14 min. utes of fully 3D rendered, full-motion video. The space battles rival anything you've seen on Babylon 5, and the 3D rendered actors don't look cheesy at all. This minimovie is entertain. ing, and about the only place it falls apart is in some of the \"drama queen\" voice acting. The story continues to unfold as you com plete missions. Multiple missions outcomes can affect how the storyline goes-there's even a hint that you may be forced to choose sides at one point. Missions are prescripted and must be completed in order. However, you can choose to replay any completed mission in an attempt to get a better score (most missions have bonuses available that you're bound to miss the first time through). In addition, a cheat code available at www.particle-systems.com will let you choose any mission at any time. Although the story is fairly linear, the missions are varied enough to keep it interesting. On one mission, you may be tasked with stop ping waves of fighters as they warp in at Lagrange Point. Further on, you may be tasked with destroying some asteroids before they collide with a moonbase, or escorting the Commonwealth's president on a foolhardy tour of the solar system.

"PREVIEWS AXIS & ALLIES A Little Change Will Do You Good What the designers aren't taking chances with, though, is the Al. There are five levels of computer opponents for each of the five great powers: Russia, Germany, Britain, Japan, and the U.S. (listed in the order that each moves in the game). The top-level opponents are already better than those in most of the recent strategy games we've seen, probably because Hasbro has some of the best Axis & Allies players in the country putting the Al through its paces. To keep the game accessible to those who haven't played the boardgame, the design includes both a tutorial mode and scads of Windows help files. Here is a list of the main changes from the paper game in Axis & ALLIES:  Submarines may not retreat after surviving, but may submerge in the same space,  You may build multiple AA, but only one in each space may fire at enemy aircraft When you ship units from one ally to another (say, British air units to Russia), all troops then belong to that recipient's nationality,  Battleships now require two hits to sink.  Scorched Earth lets you destroy your factories, denying them to the enemy.  You may officially play without tech development of Super Weapons. Japanese kamikazes have increased attack capability.  Polar ice blocks moves from west Canada to the Atlantic.  The Panama Canal may be either one or two sea zones.  You may prohibit the building of new industry. FULESHVARIATIONS 2rd Edition Rules Totalice Ong Panana Sza Zone Total Viatoria Sid Edition Rules Paraligap Units East-West Canada AS Advantage Scorched Cart No Weapon Development Strerge, IT'S THE SPITTING IMAGE For most computer games, saying that they look as good as a boardgame\" is scant praise. Here, it's a compliment. The vibrant colors are inviting to wide-eyed newbie and jaded veteran alike, and the smooth-scrolling map evokes memories of the effortlessly nav. igable interface of the first PANZER GENERAL The map also allows the designers to clear up some navigational questions from the boardgame. For instance, it now clearly takes two moves to get through the Panama Canal, and you can't get from Western Canada to the Atlantic Ocean in one move-all of which No Neri industry Never Occupation Astial Retreat USSR Eesticted Always Active AA GY The Battle Kamikaze UNIT EDIT TERRITORY EDIT RESET APPLY CECANGRE HELPS True to the Name s opposed to a lot of developers who often think engine first, gameplay second, the development team at Meyer-Glass has been very careful—even reverential-in regards to keeping Axis & Allies pure and unsullied. When Hasbro flew in Axis & Allies creator Larry Harris to meet with the group, one of the Meyer-Glass designers brought his faded, 12-year-old copy of the boardgame for Harris to auto graph. When the Hasbro folks offered to get the designer a newer copy, he reportedly said he'd keep his old game: it had history. We won't know for sure until the game ships, but I'd keep my eyes open: These are the kind of fanatics that design addictive games makes sense, given the game's global scale. There are several other small changes from the boardgame--most suggested by either the original designer, Larry Harris, or by veteran Axis & Allies players that comprise this \"third edition\" of the classic Axis & Allies rules. Anyone who has played the second edition rules (the ones currently in use), however, can simply tog. gle the newer changes off if they desire. In fact, the best thing about Axis & Allies is that it combines the best aspects of the boardgame with all of the things a computer does so well. Not only can you play the PC game exactly like its cardboard counterpart, you can also edit nearly everything, à la CIVILIZATION IL. Tired of having your German submarine trashed in the Baltic Sea at the beginning of every game? Just set it up off the coast of Brazil instead, and watch the British and U.S. players sweat. Games of Axis & Allies finish more quickly on the computer, of course, and you can save games in progress-as opposed to leaving your battleship as bait for your favorite feline admiral. Finally, Hasbro plans a full chat menu, since players actually have more time to chat in turn-based games. About the only problem I can see with Axis & ALLIES is that the player setting up the game is the server. Before you have DIABLO-style night mares, however, Hasbro assures us that it's a bit easier to discourage cheating in a non-dynamic strategy world than on, say, battle.net (and Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone has built-in protection as well). Basically, all players will agree to the rules set used before play begins, at which time the options are locked down, and not editable through the remainder of the game. All in all, Hasbro is well on its way to lighting a fire in the computer strategy/wargaming world, much as it did over a decade ago with boardgames. If the designers take the time to finish Axis & ALLIES, for Hasbro-and for those who buy the company's games-those recent computergame nightmares will seem a long time ago. CGW JUNE 1998 "

"WATCH YOUR BACK Get Ready for the Bloodiest Match of the Year as We Preview All the Hot New 3D Action Shooters Coming at You ast year at this time, we wrote of the revolution of 3D shooters. As we predicted, the crop of post-QUAKE games moved from run-andgun gameplay to more story-driven, action/adventure gaming. Of course, in the end, we all want to kill things, so the emphasis was, and still is, on awesome action. But realistic puzzles and interactive environments, as well as characters and enemies with personality, have arrived to revitalize this genre. However, the kind of creative boost this genre needed has apparently been harder to implement than we first thought, as less than half of the games we previewed last year have shipped QUAKE II, HEXEN II, JEDI KNIGHT, and TUROK are the only ones to make an appearance as of yet. In a sense, these games were the heralds of the 3D revolution. The rest of last year's pack, and some new entrants, are finally threatening to release, and with real-time 3D engines now standard, each game has to distinguish itself with story and innovative game design. To survive, these games are boasting deeper stories, intelligently crafted missions, and welldesigned levels, as well as interactive environments and realistic puzzles. JEDI KNIGHT showed that character growth is a plus, and QUAKE II reminded us that deathmatch and multiplay must never be neglected. And the lesson we learned from HEXEN I was that no matter how much depth you add, you have to give players focus. Round two of the 3D shooting wars passed quietly, with QUAKE II and JEDI emerging as the victors in a small field. This year, round three is finally set to arrive, behind schedule, but with an even bigger lineup of some spectacular 3D action games. We said it last year, but this time we mean it: Here come the killers! JUNE 1998 CGW "

What struck me most about HALF-LIFE was its cinematic feel. You don't just progress from level to level because a \"level complete\" screen tells you to wait for the next world to load. In HALF-LIFE, you feel like you are part of a living world, Adding to the cinematic feel of HALF-LIFE are the number of where events and little details conspire to tell a story. scripted events that appear to tell a story and create atmosphere.

Ain't life a bitch? SIN, Ritual Entertainment's entry into the 3D-shooter arena, reflects the growing trend in this genre to embrace story and eschew the simplistic \"level clearing\" gameplay of yore. for surprise attacks, the good news is—you can, too. In fact, the game will reward stealth, allowing you to eavesdrop on Sinclair's workers to pick up passcodes and plot pieces. Since our last preview (in our March 1998 issue), Ritual has thrown vehicles into the mix.

"QUAKE NI MISSION PACKS Id and Friends Breathe New Life Into QUAKE Il by Elliott Chin hile the world waits for TRINITY (it isn't coming out for some time, so id says, \"Stop asking\"), id is busy working on several QUAKE Il-related projects. The first is the QUAKE II MISSION PACK 1: THE RECKONING, being developed by Xatrix, the creators of REDNECK RAMPAGE. THE RECKONING site, but now you have to brave the Strogg planet's alien wilderness before entering the base. While you'll face various modified QUAKE | cyborgs (including hyperblaster-wielding guards and iron maidens with homing rockets), you'll also encounter a wild beast indigenous to the planet: the Gekk. The Gekk are vicious fiendlike creatures that attack in packs. The Gekk can spit acid, rake with their claws, and heal themselves. As if that weren't enough, their giblets ooze harmful acid, à la Aliens. The plan is to include three new weapons: the ion ripper, which fires a laser disc that ricochets off walls: the phalanx, which fires twin rockets; and the trap, a mine that sucks in enemies and spits out health-giving food cubes. The levels in this pack promise to be full of interactive environments and realistic puzzles. Some levels will also let you team up with NPC marines to duke it out, squad-style, against the Strogg baddies. Xatrix also says that the end level, and the end boss, will be refreshingly unconventional. In THE RECKONING. you play the marine whose pod collided with the QUAKE Il marine's pod. Having been knocked off course, you've landed just outside another Strogg base. Your mission is to neutralize this THE ROGUE PACK ld's second mission pack doesn't have an official name, but it's being developed by Rogue, the creators of QUAKE MISSION PACK 2: DISSOLUTION OF ETERNITY. There will be a single-player game (wherein you play a new marine on a mission to disable a Strogg gravity well), but the primary focus is on multiplay. The Rogue pack should include the multiplayer game Capture the Flag, and perhaps Rocket Arena and Tag, in addition to 20 new Death Match levels. The pack will also be chock-full of power-ups and weapons. The QUAKE Il disintegrator (which didn't quite make it into QUAKE I IS finally making its appearance in the Rogue Pack. Multiple shots of this weapon causes the target to fade into nothingness. There will also be a tesla bomb, which fixes to the ground and fires lightning bolts at any players who venture near it (great for preventing campers from getting near weapons). There will also be a laser weapon that drills a constant beam of searing energy at a target, much like QUAKE's lightning gun. There will also be hand-thrown proximity mines. Other weapons are still pending id's approval.

"UNREAL Epic Megagames Says It's Almost Done by Elliott Chin y now, everyone on the planet has heard of UNREAL, that original QUAKE Killer which was predicted to blow QUAKE out of the water with MMX-enhanced graphics. That was a year and a half ago, but as we approach the summer of 1998, UNREAL is finally nearing completion. UNREAL's story is a simple one: Your ship has been pulled into the \"Bermuda triangle\" of space. As a result, you've crash-landed on a strange planet's surface. The first level actually begins inside the damaged innards of your vessel. Once you manage to escape from the burning hulk, you find yourself on an alien world where a war is NO MORE ENGINE CHANGES! Many of UNREAL's delays have been due to changes to the engine as new technology was continually added to improve and update the engine. However, Epic now says the engine is feature complete. The engine uses both BSPs and portals for drawing the world. The portals are used for UNREAL'S skies, mirrors, reflective surfaces, and transporters. Among the other goodies in the engine are volumetric lighting, lens flare, and some great shimmering textures for water, fire, and lightning. There will also be a liberal sprinkling of scripted events, such as hearing a fight beyond a door, that will tell stories and set mood. Epic also promises that the engine responsible for the character animation will store some pleasant surprises, such as regional damage. As in HALF-LIFE and Sin, the monsters in UNREAL will react based on where you shoot them; a head shot, for example, will be HIT THE LIGHTS This shot shows a Skaari, a vicious combatant who will dodge bullets and especially lethal. You'll also be able to see a player's chase you through levels. This shot also shows UNREAL'S lighting effects. actual weapon in deathmatch, rather than a generic weapon-skin. raging between the warlike Skaarj and the peaceful Nall.

Of course, you'll battle plenty of hostile aliens on this world.

"BLINGON HONOR GUARD When the Going Gets Tough, the Klingons Call the Honor Guard by Denny Atkin and Elliott Chin tar Trek games haven't all been good. The half-baked \"action\" game GENERATIONS was one example of a license gone bad. But MicroProse's upcoming KLINGON HONOR GUARD, slated to ship late this year, could restore honor to the Star Trek franchise. HONOR GUARD is the other action game for which MicroProse has licensed the UNREAL engine (the first is FIRST CONTACT), but it could be the more popular of the two, because you get to play a bloodthirsty Klingon. As a member of the Klingon Honor Guard, you have to hunt down some traitors who have made an attempt on the Emperor's life. As you progress through the game, you'll uncover a conspiracy to take over the throne by some familiar Star Trek villains. Along the way, you'll encounter NPCs with whom you can fight or talk, including Kurn, Worf's brother (voiced by actor Tony Todd). The game will feature between 15 and 19 levels in a variety of environs. In addition to the Klingon High Council building on Q'onos, the Klingon homeworld, you'll also travel to the snowy penal colony on Rura Pente. You'll also find yourself on a variety of Klingon ships and a space station. There will be plenty of vicious Klingon melee weapons and destructive firepower to use, as COME GET SOME As a Klingon war well as many Klingons, aliens, rior, you'll get to kick traitorous ass. and monsters to fight. The GOING FOR A SWIM HONOR GUARD will use the latest Unreal engine, giving it sumptuous graphics like these. graphics, likewise, are very impressive, since the game uses the very latest UNREAL engine.

"DAIRATANA Slice and Dice Through Time in lon Storm's Upcoming Shooter by Robert Coffey s it still a shooter if the main weapon is a sword? Well, when it's a great big, two-handed, power-sucking, mystical, time-traveling badass of a blade, you betcha. Do not despair, action fans, DAIKATANA is no frilly-shirt fencing sim. EON FLUX The game's story is one of time-travel through four different time periods. You journey with two gun-toting NPCs to thwart a historyaltering madman. Of the game's four periods, the two shown the most during our lon Storm visit were the Greek and the medieval. The Greek levels will have (at least) a Medusa level, an Acropolis level, a Minotaur's maze, and a King Midas level. The name of each level refers to the boss characters you will face (while the Acropolis level will be the actual building), according to the Greek period's level designer John \"Dr. Sleep\" Anderson. Levels will play out more as missions with specific goals, and gamers will do more than just waste bad guys while searching for keys. And while DAIKATANA isn't embracing the branching structure of a WING COMMANDER-type game, you will have a few choices in missions—do you reach the castle by climbing up the mountain or by working your way up through the dungeons beneath it? John Romero, Ion Storm president, has plenty of plans for deathmatch, including bringing the experience system of the single-player game over to deathmatch. In order to prevent some players from dominating multiplayer contests with maxxed-out characters, Romero wants to reward higherlevel characters with little or no experience for offing weaker opponents. On the other hand, weaker characters who kill higher level ones will find themselves blessed with a bucketload of experience. Additionally, you might be able to set an experience point limit for deathmatches. Also, if players pick up power-ups, their appearance will change. For instance, superhealth might make a player bigger. DAIKATANA will support cooperative, Capture the Flag, and deathmatch play. While you can play only as Hiro in single-player mode, other characters will be available in multiplayer games, and lon Storm is toying with the idea of allowing you to play as some of the monsters as well. . We saw DAIKATANA at a critical juncture, when much of the game was in a disparate state due to the conversion to the QUAKE Il engine. In September we'll see just how well the game's ambitious pieces come together. WINTER WONDERLAND In DAIKATANA each time period, like this medieval one, will have its own set of architecture, weapons, and monsters. SIGHT-SEEING THROUGH TIME Like many other games, DAIKATANA will use the QUAKE Il engine. Judging from the levels we saw on our visit to lon Storm, graphically, the game will be sharp and beautifully detailed, with sweeping skies and lighting effects that create an appropriately gloomy gothic feel for the medieval levels. Much of the game will take place in expansive outdoor levels. Unfortunately, the game was running a bit sluggishly at the time of our visit, but that should be corrected before its release. Cinematics will play between episodes and between some levels to advance the story. CUTTING EDGE One of the more intriguing things about DAIKATANA is its inclusion of some limited role-playing elements. As you slash your way through time, you will accrue experience points to enhance both your skills (such as speed and jumping ability) as well as your sword's special properties. It's similar to the use of force powers in JEDI KNIGHT, but there is a difference. JEDI KNIGHT'S force powers had to be triggered to be used, almost as if they were inventory items. In DAIKATANA, the powers will always be in effect; you'll move more quickly through the levels, your jumps will always be bigger...you get the picture. How you allocate these powers lets you customize your character to your style of play and ensures that DAIKATANA will play differently for different gamers. Developer: Ion Storm  Publisher: Eidos Interactive Target Release Date: Q3 '98  Engine: QUAKE II Synopsis: Wielding a powerful magic sword called the Daikatana, you must embark on a quest with two teammates through four time periods to stop a history-altering villain.

"TRESPASSER Dinosaurs Come Alive in the Most Realistic World Ever Crafted for the Action Genre by Elliott Chin f all the games in this roundup, the one least deserving of the \"action\" title is Dreamworks' TRESPASSER...and that is an entirely good thing. TRESPASSER is a game with a totally physics-based world populated by living, thinking dinosaurs. You're an interloper voiced by actress Minnie Driver, who must escape the island home of these creatures. The reason why this isn't entirely an action game is because you'll often interact with the world in ways besides killing. There are many dinosaurs that look at you as food, but you won't be able to fight them head to head (in the interest of realism, your character will die from just a single raptor bite. Instead, you'll explore the island, getting past dozens of puzzles by manipulating the environment around you, all with the express goal of getting through a gauntlet of traps and killer dinos and off the island. THE WORLD COMES ALIVE having scripted animation wouldn't work for the dinosaurs, so Dreamworks moved beyond the traditional method of animating characters to something Seamus Blackley, lead designer, calls a \"musculature-skeletal movement system.\" Basically, as in skeletal animation, all characters are composed of bones. However, TRESPASSER's engine goes one step further and attaches muscles to move those bones, as well as skins on top of those bones that stretch according to muscle movement. This creates completely realistic, and mesmerizing, movement. The bodies of running dinosaurs will bounce according to how fast and on what terrain they are running, and skin around mouths and tails will stretch as they move. The bones will also respond to the physics of the world, so that if you hit a raptor's head, the head will snap back. Hit it harder and the head will recoil farther. Smash it hard enough and you'll actually see the rest of the dinosaur's body moving counter to the blow to maintain balance. While skeletal animation systems of games like UNREAL and Sin will be able to duplicate many of the effects of TRESPASSER's movement system, such as regional damage, none look like they'll be able to achieve such dynamic results. The Al of the dinosaurs is likewise realistic. All dinosaurs will be motivated by a combination of physical and emotional states, including hunger, anger, fear, curiosity, fatigue, and pain. Different dinosaurs will start out with different default settings (raptors will have more anger and less fear than a docile hadrosaur), but these states can and will be affected by the game world and you. For instance, if a hungry raptor comes chasing you, you could actually toss it a piece of meat, which would satisfy its hunger and cause it to ignore you. By giving these dinosaurs a ALLS range of feelings to act upon, Dreamworks is in essence populating their world with living creatures with their own needs, creatures who don't exist solely to kill or be killed by you. The physics of the world are unbelievable. Every object in the world is a 3D object that can be manipulated. Barrels can be pushed down hills, rocks can be thrown into ponds. Those rocks will sink to the bottom of the pond, while the barrels will float; and both will create different sized ripples in the lake. Basically, if you can see it, you can interact with it. And all objects will react based on the laws of physics. Doors will swing on hinges, and objects will tumble down mountains based on For a bigger scoop how hard you push on Dreantworks them and from TRESPASSER, point your what direction. browser to www. Because the gamespot.com/ world is so features/trespasser. physics-based, THE NEXT STEP After seeing TRESPASSER, I decided that what Dreamworks is creating isn't just a game, it's a world. A world that breathes and exists without you, one that you're privileged to be a part of. However, though realism is TRESPASSER's greatest strength, it is also its greatest weakness. The best technology in the world doesn't automatically create a wonderful game, and Blackley and Dreamworks know that. That's why they are devoting the time between now and the September ship-date to actually designing and testing the gameplay. The trick is to piece all the puzzles together, giving enough focus to the gameplay so that gamers don't get lost in the possibilities (that's where Minnie Driver's voiceover hints come in), and to balance the game so that the fun, and not the technolo gy, is the order of the day. I'm very eager to see whether the game lives up to the engine.

"VIGILANCE It's Spy Versus Spy in SegaSoft's Modern-Day 3D Shooter by Elliott Chin egaSoft's VIGILANCE stands out among this distinguished crowd of games by virtue of its modern day setting and its ability to let you play any and all of eight player characters, each with his or her own attributes. You are part of an antiterrorist group, progressing linearly through six zones of conflict. Each zone has its own missions and objectives, and the zones are like hubs, in that they are composed of several interlocking levels. Each zone will have its own mission and story, but as you play the game, you'll discover a conspiracy that links all the missions and ministories together. MISSION BRIEFINGS The mix of missions is quite diverse. You'll have to retrieve secret documents, conduct jail breaks, infiltrate and destroy military bases, and rescue and escort QUIET IN THE LIBRARY This sparsely populated level is preliminary, but it shows a library-one of many different dignitaries.

We feel engines. But none of those games have surpassed DUKE 3D's comit is very important for the average user to be able to experiment and bination of personality and interactivity. Duke not only walked the play with the code of the game with just a brain and a text editor. So walk, he could talk the talk, and he could perform plenty of the bottom line is that you will see a very dynamic environment in endearing actions, like relieving himself, busting urinals with his DNF with lots of things to \"do.\" boot, collapsing entire buildings, tipping strippers, and shrinking CGW: If DUKE NUKEM FOREVER were a movie, what do you think it alien monsters to squish them underfoot. would be rated?

People also love the sneaky weapons like the pipe bombs and trip bombs, so you can expect something similar. CGW: What do you expect the system requirements will be? Broussard: System requirements are hard to nail down this early, but the game will lean heavily on hardware acceleration. It'll probably run on a 2MB 3Dfx card, but as a poor man's base.

"PREY 3D Realms' First Hardware-only Game Looks Very Impressive by Ken Brown in 1996, CGW's contributing editor on game design, Paul Schuytema, and I marveled at a game called PREY, which was running at 3D Realms' offices just outside Dallas. We were there to see the nearly-finished DUKE NUKEM 3D, but PREY, even in its infancy, caught our eye. It promised many innovative features, such as a true 3D environment, dynamic lighting and shadows, and robust multiplayer options, including the ability for players to chat and exchange resources online. The game failed to materialize in time to \"blow QUAKE away,\" as 3D Realms president George Broussard predicted, but Broussard had no way of knowing that part of his team would defect to create a startup. And I had no way of knowing that Paul Schuytema would leave CGW and become the PREY project leader. Obviously, the game has gone through revolutionary changes since then, but perhaps the most BRAVE GUNNER Talon Brave surveys the city outside the immense Trocaran mothership. His body is composed of 1,000 polygons. This ship is gigantic in scale and has some design similarities to Larry Niven's Ringworld. It's not as large as the ringworld, but it's about four times the diameter of Earth. Each of the species gets a third of this ship, and this third contains not only interior space, but atmosphere-holding exterior areas rough ly equal to the surface area of Earth. In addition to the three species, there is also a fourth, rather mysterious group called the Keepers. They \"live between the cracks\" of the Trocara, and part of the adventure is to discover their role in the universe. CGW: What will the PREY engine be able to do that you can't do with the QUAKE Il engine? Schuytema: Our Portal Technology yields capabilities that just aren't present in the Qil engine. We deal with all of our geometry real-time, meaning that everything has the potential to be interactive-every wall, every floor, every polyhedron. Our portals can be dynamic, meaning that these \"rips in space\" can do just about anything you can imagine. Because we use portals to break our world into manageable chunks, our GSEs (game space engineers) can burn far more polygons on detail areas if they choose. There's also Preditor, our content-modeling tool—it allows our GSEs to create insane interactivity. The cool thing is, we're giving it away with the game. CGW: What will the system requirements be? What 3D APIs do you plan to support? Schuytema: We're not committing to specs yet, but PREY will be a very scalable game, able to run on a wide range of systems. If you've got a robust Pentium with a quality 3D accelerator, you'll run the game just fine. As for 3D APIs, we will do a native 3Dfx version, as well as an OpenGL version. We may directly support a few other cards, depending on what shakes out in the card market over the next few months, & FEMME FATALE Talon readies himself as a female warrior prepares to charge through a portal transmitter. exciting change is that Prey will be a 3D-only game, requiring a 3D graphics card to play. The company is betting that when Prey ships early next year, most serious action gamers will have a 3D card. The Prey team is working feverishly in preparation for this year's E3. But by relentlessly playing the \"CGW alumni\" card with Schuytema, he finally agreed to send some never-before-seen screenshots of the game and answer the following questions. CGW: What is the storyline in PREY? Schuytema: Talon Brave is the central character. He is a modernera Apache who lives on a small reservation in northeastern Arizona He has real depth, a real back-story, and real problems that he's facing. We're going to great lengths to research Native American culture, mythology, language, and traditions to make Talon believable. Talon is abducted and ends up on a Trocaran mothership. The Trocara are three diverse alien species who use the same mothership. thershin Developer: 3D Realms  Publisher: GT Interactive Target Release Date: 01 '99  Engine: PREY Synopsis: You play Talon Brave, a modern-era Apache from Arizona, who is abducted by aliens and has to fight his way back to Earth.

"ADVANCED LEVEL DESIGNING One of the Industry's Best Level Designers Reveals His Secrets by Richard \"Levelord\" Gray all nonessential and superfluous distractions from the study. The point for the level designer is to create the most impressive and coolest level with the fewest number of polygons. The underlying strategies, although different in motives, are exactly the same. Levels must be as simple as possible due to the constraints of technology, yet they must authentically convey an entire environment and impress the player. Only the absolute necessities can be used and even then, these absolutes must be managed with deft dexterity and prudent economy. ost of the advice we level designers have given to date has been at the high-school level. Now it's time for college. I don't want to come off as too intellectual, especially toward the fun-loving Q-munity, but much of what goes into a killer level is actually very sophisticated. When designing levels, often find myself referring to concepts I learned in engineering school and graduate-level art school. I'll try to introduce those principles in the following pages, but I can't spend enough time on such topics as Minimalism and optical illusions in this short article. Please get a book or two on those subjects, or do some surfing on the Net for these terms. Natural landscape is one of my favorite level settings. These settings have tons of irregular shapes and tend to be bigger and more open than the typical inside level. Unfortunately, both of these characteristics, irregularity and openness, are stymied by current 3D game engine technology. Current technology enforces great restrictions on the number of polygonal surfaces in any given view within a level, usually to the order of 500 to 700 in count. Current 3D game engines also have great favor toward things square and orthogonal (relating to or composed of right angles). Anyone who has spent more than a few hours trying to create a level knows that the current state-of-the-art limits the ability to create big, natural environments. I've found ways, however, of circumventing these constraints. Some finesse borrowed from the art world, as well as a handful of tricks from the world of weird science, make levels look bigger than they really are. A limited palette does not necessarily a limited artist make! THEBANA ISHORAL A prime example of a minimalistic approach can be found in the Japanese art of flower arranging called Ikebana. It is a very simplistic and natural form of flower arranging, in contrast to the almost overly decorative form in Western societies. Level designers, for the most part, tend to think like Westerners. Ikebana seeks to create a harmony of linear construction and rhythm instead of emphasizing the quantity of the flowers. Devoting their attention to the blossoms, students of Ikebana emphasize the linear aspects of the arrangement. That's the important concept: the arrangement, not the flowers themselves, is the main focus. Particularly relevant is Shoka Ikebana, in which only three flowers are displayed in a precise triangular shape. This same approach to brush placement, emphasizing the linear aspects of the display while effectively using the fewest surfaces, can turn cripplingly few polygons into a stunning and fulfilling landscape. An entire mountainside can be cast with only three correctly placed brushes. MINIMALISM: LESS IS MORE! HUMAN VISUAL SYSTEM Your eyes, the human visual system (HVS), are an enhanced twodimensional system. Although you think you see things in three Minimalism is one of the major movements in modern art. It is characterized by the utmost restriction in the use of color and form. Typically, a minimalist uses simple, repetitive geometrical shapes (sound familiar?) to represent the purest essence of the artwork. A cylinder may represent a tree, or a square may be a house. Although unintended, this is precisely the type of medium in which the level designer is immersed. The point for the art movement is to eliminate LOLLILINE AGITTIRTIMIT (LEFT) MOUNTAIN BY IKEBANA An entire mountainside can be cast with only three simple brushes. Its sense of majesty is enhanced by placing three varying sizes in a triangle such that the middle, more bulky brush stands slightly behind the smallest and largest in height on either side.

That seems simple to understand, but I want you to pause for a moment and fully realize that you know nothing of the third dimension from what you see! The third dimension is added later by the occipital cortex in the back of your brain. Everything you know about the third dimension is induced by some very sophisticated software in the occipital cortex. This software makes many assumptions and takes numerous shortcuts while recreating the third dimension. You can use some of these assumptions and shortcuts to enhance your level, especially its depth and expanse. depth to our levels, and it costs very little in terms of polygons. I often place objects and structures in my levels for no other reason than to stimulate this effect. Usually I do this in front of border areas so that the level appears to go off much farther than it really does. OPTICAL ILLUSIONS As I'm sure we've all seen, there are many optical illusions and their effects can be quite astounding. Most optical illusions are twists on the HVS process of rebuilding the third dimension. In particular, we want to focus on the optical illusions responsible for visual depth cues. It is most important that the player feels there's something beyond the immediately visible level. In the real world, the following depth cues influence our perception of space and reality: occlusion, perspective, atmospheric effects, shading, binocular disparity, motion parallax, interposition, convergence, and accommodation. Visual depth cues, such as perspective, shading, and even atmospheric effects, are already handled by current 3D engines. Other depth cues are binocular and require input differentials to two separate eyes. Binocular displacement, disparity, and accommodation therefore require special equipment (stereo-optic goggles, split screen, and the like) to reproduce their effect on a display. There are still a few monocular depth cues, though, that will work on the eyes as a single unit yet are very easy to employ in a level. We want to fool the player's brain into \"feeling\" that the level is larger and more expansive than it actually is. We want to cheat the system and stimulate the player to say things like \"behind,\" \"beyond,\" and \"in back of\" when viewing a level. MOTION PARALLAX Motion parallax is another very pow As a level designer at erful effect that will add great depth to Ritual Entertainment, and your levels. This effect is the apparent the creator of several DUKE displacement of an object in a view NUKEM 3D and SCOURGE OF relative to its proximity to the viewer.

The brain uses this to wax poetic about level difference in displacement to help design now and again. determine relative distances, and you can use it as well to make your levels appear deeper. Objects in foreground will subtly stimulate the player's motion parallax, and moving around will provide a steady stream of parallax differentials to reinforce the sense of depth. An example of this would be when you're riding in a car, looking out the side window, and noticing that the houses immediately in front of you are panning across your view at a much faster rate than the buildings off in the distance. Even slower still are the clouds in the farthest background. OCCLUSION When one part of an image is obstructed by something in the foreground, the obscured portion is occluded. One of the assumptions made by the HVS is that the \"something\" doing the occluding must be in front of the portion that is not seen. Forcing the player's brain to perform this process is an indirect but effective way to enhance the level's feel of dimension. We can use this assumption to add Level designing is definitely a cross between art and science. The limitations in level design are many, and they can be quite frustrating. It is only through finessing and trickery that these conditions can be overcome. Most people, I believe, don't realize how much science is actually involved and tend to think of level design as purely creative art. In fact, level designing is juxtaposed between these two seemingly disparate disciplines and understanding both can greatly help your levels. Remember that art describes \"why\" things are seen, and science describes \"how\" things are seen; knowledge of both will help you create very effective levels with the very limiting tools of the trade. A great level designer must think in the most simplistic of terms. Studying other forms of simplicity, such as Minimalism and Ikebana, can greatly help the designer to see with new eyes. When new eyes don't help any more, it's time to pull out the Black Bag of Science and use the tricks of the human visual system. & HUULLISEURATIE COGENE DEFT PERCEPTION (RIGHT) Although not immediately evident in this shot, the columns not only add cover from hostile fire, they also add depth to the view as the player moves about and occlusion and motion parallax stimulate the occipital cortex.

"Piecing Together the 3D Puzzle Understanding 3D What 3D Does for You In some ways, 3D in PC games isn't anything new. 3D game engines have been around for years, and some have even looked pretty good; all their rendering work was done on the CPU. But as 3D accelerators and game engines have matured, having a 3D accelerator has become more of a staple and much less of a luxury. Without 3D card support, many games run smoothly only on rigs with very fast processors, because displaying a three-dimensional world in the confines of your 2D monitor requires a tremendous number of mathematical calculations. Of the calculations needed to display 3D graphics, the most intensive is the final rendering that is, turning those mathematical calculations of space and time into a picture on your screen that changes 15 or more times per second. When you add those calculations to the math required for basic gameplay-artificial intelligence, tracking enemies, playing music, reading a joystick, etc.-you end up with a daunting set of tasks for even a fast CPU to handle. A good 3D accelerator card can take much of the burden of rendering the 3D game world off your processor. Its specialized hardware handles the tasks of placing objects on the screen, usually leaving your processor more time for its other tasks and resulting in smoother gameplay. Games that support 3D cards (adding a 3D accelerator won't do a thing for your old games that predate 3D hardware) will generally run much faster if you have such a card in your system. How much faster? Let's take QUAKE Il as an example. On a 200MHz MMX Pentium system with a decent 2D graphics card, you can get QUAKE II to run, at best, around 10-15 frames per second (fps) at 640x480 resolution. Now, if you add a graphics accelerator, that number can kick up to 25-30 fps or better at the same resolution. Running QUAKE Il in software, most of the graphics are handled on the CPU, and the 2D card is just a \"dumb frame buffer,\" meaning all it does is display the final image. Inside 3D APIs Okay, now you're sold on the idea of buying a 3D accelerator. Which one to buy? Here's where it gets difficult, because various games support a number of different, incompatible 3D standards, and you'll want to make sure to get a card that supports the standards used by games you like to play. The various 3D standards are based on different 3D APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), the software layer that programmers use to tell the 3D accelerator hardware what to draw. There are three prevalent APIs and a couple of other, somewhat common, ones. Many cards support more than one of these. The three most common APIs are Microsoft's Direct3D, OpenGL (originally developed by Silicon Graphics), and Glide, the proprietary API that exclusively supports hardware using 3Dfx graphics chips. Direct3D games were slow in coming early on, but we've seen a good number of top-shelf titles that were written entirely using DirectX.

Meanwhile, the NEC and Rendition were out beating the drum for their respective proprietary APIs. All of this has resulted in an enormous amount of confusion among the buying public. What does this mean to you? Until the market settles on one or two 3D APIs, you'll need to look at the games you want to play, consider which APIs they use for 3D, and then buy a 3D card based on this information. For a jump-start, check out the charts that detail which APIs are supported by popular games. LOOKING GOOD Without 3D acceleration, you don't get QUAKE-II's colored lighting, which adds greatly to the overall mood of the scenes. But with a 3D accelerator, you not only get the colored lighting, but larger resolutions with smooth frame rates, and filtered textures that don't get blocky. In software, QUAKE-II runs best at a resolution of 320x240, but with hardware acceleration, you can run at 640x480, 800x600, and in some cases even 1024x768, and still be in the 20-30 frames-per-second range, SOFTWARE SOFTWARE HARDWARE ACCELERATED To get an up-to-theminute idea of what the hottest graphics cards are when you read this article, check our Ultimate Game Machine page at www.gamespot.com.

"pietika together ind CPU Speed Matters System Performance Issues: The CPU Matters Some new graphics cards are hot performers in speedy Pentium Il rigs, but can't match last year's 3Dfx in your trusty Pentium 166. We took three graphics cards and tested them in the PCI slots of a P166MMX and a PII/266 to gauge their performance in each system. 3D WinBench 98: Pentium MMX/166 ATI xpert@play 204 Diamond Viper 330 240 Diamond Monster 3D 217 3D WinBench 98: Pentium 11/266 ATI xpert@play 451 Diamond Viper 330 Diamond Monster 3D 361 485 Designing and producing a graphics chip takes time. The record time to market for a new chip is probably nVidia's RIVA 128—the chip went from inception to production in around nine months. The chip designers have to use crystal balls and decide what kinds of systems the people using their cards will have. Bear in mind that most graphics cards and chips sold go into new systems sold by big PC manufacturers, not into boxes on store shelves. Naturally, a chip designed last year would want to target the AGP bus and the Intel Pentium II. Of course, the operating system would be either Windows 95 or Windows NT. There's an interesting side effect to this necessity. Owners of mid-range Pentium systems may find that the latest hot chip doesn't do so well on their rig. The RIVA 128 and ATI's new Rage Pro are good examples. Both do very well on Pentium II AGP systems. Pop a PCI version into a Pentium 100, and you'll wonder what all the fuss is about. Using 3D WinBench as our measure, the newer chips will run faster than a 3Dfx accelerator like the Monster 3D on a 266MHZ Pentium II. On the other hand, the RIVA will actually run 3D WinBench 98 slower than a 3Dfx card on a Pentium 120. The one exception to the rule seems to be the Rendition V2200 chip, which has a very even performance curve. Here's where it gets a little confusing: Creative's new 3Dfx Voodoopart outguns all the competition running 3D WinBench 98 on both a Pentium MMX 166 and a Pentium-Il 333, but in Direct3D games we tested, it was faster, but not dramatically so. For QUAKE Il and QUAKE-based games, Voodoo looks to be the choice, but be prepared to pony up. So, the graphics card you might choose for a new system would be different than the one you'd get to upgrade an existing PCIbased Pentium system. While the ATI All-in-Wonder Pro might beat out a Monster 3D in your new 300MHz AGP Pentium Il system, it will be a distant second in a Pentium 166 box.

For the most part, you buy a PCI graphics card, you plug it in, and it works. AGP is different, and more complicated. The AGP bus runs at 66MHz. It allows for storing 3D texture maps in main memory, called AGP texturing (also referred to occasionally as execute mode). Here, only the amount of texture needed is downloaded over the bus, not the entire texture. Then there's full AGP support, which includes 2x sideband addressing and address demultiplexing, which can double the amount of data that can be passed to the card, from 266MB per second (66MHz) to 528MB per second (133MHz). Part of the blame for AGP confusion lies with Intel, for not taking a stand on AGP features. Basically, any chip that can run on an AGP bus-whether it takes advantage of AGP features or not-can be called \"AGP compliant.\" So if you're in the market for an AGP card, choose carefully. Here are some guidelines. Also, check our handy chart at the end of this supplement for AGP feature support. There are several graphics chips that use the AGP bus as a sort of glorified PCI bus. They don't allow textures to be stored in main memory (AGP texturing) or take advantage of address demultiplexing or sideband support. We've labeled these AGP 1x only cards, but another term you might see is \"AGP lite.\" These aren't necessarily bad cards, but if you get one, make sure you get 8MB of RAM. Chips that are AGP 1X only include the Number Nine Ticket-to-Ride, Rendition V2100/2200 and Voodoo Then there are cards that add AGP texturing to AGP 1x speed. These still transfer data at 66MHz, but allow for off-card texture storage. These include the RIVA 128 and Permedia 2. Finally, there are cards that fully implement the AGP spec. The chips used in these cards include the Intel740 and ATI Rage Pro. -Loyd Case CGW 31 SUPPLEMENT JUNF 1998 "

If you do have to mix professional graphics work with your gaming, the Permedia 2 cards are worth considering.

FRAN HARDWARE ACCELERATED SOFTWARE The 3Dfx Factor If it seems like the 3Dfx Voodoo chipset is getting the lion's share of recommendations here, there's a logical explanation. The company's Glide API has proven very popular in certain segments of the market, such as simulations and sports games. Because of 3Dfx's early technology lead and Microsoft's initial stumbles with Direct3D, many current 3D titles support only 3Dfx. Game developers didn't have to rethink how they LILIPS Masterta did their titles much; they could just plug 3Dfx's Glide programming interface into their rendering engine. It gave them the ability to quickly port existing games. On top of that, the original Voodoo Graphics chipset had a commanding technology lead over their competitors. The technology playing field is showing signs of leveling a bit now, but with the Voodoo chipset, 3Dfx regains that performance edge. The bottom line is that if you want full support across the gamut of 3D gamesDirect3D, OpenGL and Glide—you need to get a 3Dfx card. The good news is that even if Glide eventually fades away as game programmers pick one of the standard APIs, then you still have a fast card. Wargamers should sit up and take notice, too, because it's very likely that 3D wargame titles will want to do their 3D in a window-but that's just a guess on my part. It's even more confusing. Some games that have the 3Dfx logo on the box-such as DID's F-22 ADF-in fact support both Glide and Direct3D. Other games with the 3Dfx logo use only Direct3D-but have been tested only with 3Dfx. So HARDWARE the safe bet for a hard-core gamer continues to be: ACCELERALER Get a 3Dfx card to put alongside whatever other graphics card you have. And, yes, a 3Dfx card will coexist very nicely with an AGP graphics card.

"Piecing Together the 3D Puzzle Top 10 Misconceptions about 3D Accelerators 1. A 3D accelerator will speed up all of my 3D games. Not necessarily. First, the game has to be written to take advantage of a 3D accelerator Second, some of the first-generation 3D \"accelerators\" actually ran slower than if the game had been run using the software renderer. games don't run any faster and look just the same. You probably didn't enable 3D acceleration in the game. Most games still default to software rendering, and you have to actually tell the game's setup or preferences boxes to turn on 3D acceleration. 2. The box says «3Dfx,\" but the game won't run in accelerated mode on my card! \"3Dfx\" refers to a company that makes the 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo Rush chipsets. While some games that have the 3Dfx label use Direct3D. many can run only on accelerators using one of the 3Dfx chipsets. 7. It seems if I want a Windows 3D card, then I have to get a combination 2D/3D card, and if I want to run DOS-based 3D, then an addon card would be sufficient. Is there an answer for me that will not compromise the power of my existing card? Most games don't run 3D in a Window—they run full screen. So you don't have to give up your hotrod 2D card, especially if you use it for high-end graphics. Just get an add-on accelerator, like a 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics card. 3. An AGP graphics card will run faster than a PCI graphics card. Again, not necessarily. Some AGP cards are really just glorified PCI cards. Unless the card supports some of the advanced AGP features (such as AGP textures), you'll see little benefit over a PCI card. 4. An AGP Voodoo2 will blow everything away. Maybe, maybe not. It probably won't run any faster than a PCI Voodoo2. 3Dfx has stated that the PCI bus is not a performance bottleneck. On top of that, the Voodoo2 is an \"AGP lite\" chip, meaning it doesn't support any advanced AGP features, just the 66MHZ bus. Finally, you'll lose the ability to add a pair of Voodoo2's in SLI mode-both have to be PCI cards. It's far better to get an advanced AGP 2D/3D card and a Voodoo-or maybe a pair of Voodoo's. 8. I play only strategy and adventure games, so I don't need a 3D card. Guess again. Some point-of-view adventure games have started adding 3D accelerator support. There are already two strategy games-MYTH and INCUBATION-that support 3D acceleration. We've bumped into several wargame designers at 3D graphics seminars, too. 5. I'd like to upgrade to AGP, but buying another graphics card will stretch my budget, since I'd have to throw away my PCI graphics card. 9. According to all the computer magazines, AGP is totally useless, and is no better than PCI. Most computer magazines focus on productivity\" applications, which are generally 2D-based. AGP won't help much with 2D work. AGP begins to come into its own only with games that have huge textures and understand AGP. Check out the AGP version of GPOLICE and contrast it with the normal version. No, you won't. Assuming your AGP motherboard has enough slots, your PCI graphics card will work just fine in it. Then you can sit back, wait for the dust to settle a bit, and pick the AGP card that's right for you. 6. 3D is useless. I bought one of the highly rated 3D cards, and my 3D 10. I can buy only a 3Dfx card because I want to play QUAKE and QUAKE II. I'm sure the boys at id would take exception to calling QUAKE Il a 3Dfx game. QUAKE II uses OpenGL for its 3D acceleration; 3Dfx happened to be the first one out with a \"mini-GL\" driver for GL QUAKE. There are indeed games that support only 3Dfx (and some pretty darned good ones at that), but there are also some very good Direct3D games. Also, OpenGL is a viable option now that Microsoft and SGI have kissed and made up. th "

"-Piecing Together the 3D Puzzle New 3D Cards Reviewed Guillemot International MaxiGraphics Gamer3D CAMERSD Creative Labs' 3D Blaster Voodoo I ithout a doubt, the most hotly anticipated chipset for 1998 has been 3Dfx's Voodoo 3Dfx's first new chipset in almost two years. It's a testimony to the first Voodoo's staying power in this rapidly evolving market. Voodooadds several rendering features, including trilinear per-pixel MIP-mapping, a more advanced and computationally intensive-technique to achieve better filtering. Also new for Voodoo is a full triangle setup engine, further off-loading rendering duties from the CPU. The version of Creative's 3D Blaster Voodoo we tested packs 12MB of memory onto a single board (4MB frame buffer, and 4MB for each of the texel processors) and comes in at a rather steep $299. A good price for a 12MB board, but it's still 3D-only, and it's still $300 simolians. For those truly intent on having THE fastest 3D on the block, you can strap two of these guys together using 3Dfx's SLI technology-and another $300—and have yourself one hell of a party. Looking at the 3D WinBench 98 numbers, this 3D Blaster is the hands-down best of the lot on both boxes, and at both resolutions. But 3D Blaster's numbers running Direct3D games don't make it the clear winner, and in several cases it was bested by original Voodoo parts. In some cases, the 3D Blaster was simply waiting for the CPU to give it more triangles, but in others, it became apparent that the Direct3D drivers are still in need of some tuning. For QUAKE Il on the baseline system, 3D Blaster turned in numbers similar to the Quantum 3D Obsidian, but on high-end rigs, nothing PCI BUS else even comes close. Voodoo2 has re-established 3Dfx's position as the \"on the bleeding edge\" of 3D perforThe fastest 3 Gameplay mance, and Creative's 3D Blaster will let you burn through QUAKE II with a vengeance. But in order to beat rival board-maker Diamond Multimedia to market, Creative opted to use 3Dfx's reference drivers, whose Direct3D performance is not all there yet, so while this performance will almost certainly head north, it's not quite what we expected. Still, it is Voodoo, and Direct3D performance is by no means IRATED **** shabby. So if you've just got to do Voodoo, then check this guy out. —DS Creative Labs' 3D Blaster Voodoo2 3D Blaster Voodoo2 PROS: King of the Quake II-accel$229 for 8MB, erator hill (for now), great API sup$299 for 12MB port Contact: Creative Labs CONS: Direct3D drivers still needwww.sound some tweaking: expensive: 3D-only. blaster.com uillemot International is the parent company of game-maker UbiSoft, which last year brought out the futuristic racing sim, POD. Gamer3D is Guillemot's second hardware offering, following Guillemot's MaxiSound sound card, which also shipped last year. Gamer3D is yet another 3Dfx Voodoo-based add-on 3D card that finds itself in something of a squeeze play. To one side, there's the Pure3D, which has another 2MB of texture memory and a TV-out, and to the other, there's the Magic3D, which is priced to move. So to find a niche for the Gamer3D Guillemot may have their work cut out for them. Looking at Gamer3D's numbers, they 20 azalea Arrakes were pretty much what we've come to expect from Voodoo-based boards, but were otherwise unremarkable. On 3D WinBench 98, Gamer3D's performance is even with the Magic3D on the baseline system, but falls behind on the high-end box, and trails the Pure3D on both test systems. Gamer3D fares better on the high-end P-11 333MHz system than on the P-166 MMX. On the baseline test system, Gamer3D's Direct3D game frame rates are mixed, with it faring well on TUROK, MSFS 98, and QUAKE II. On the high-end system, Gamer3D's frame-rates are, again, mixed. TUROK and JEDI ran well, but all other frame rates trailed. About three months ago, the Gamer3D might have been a pretty good bet. But with the arrival of Voodoo-, coupled with the arrival of lower-cost Voodoo-based boards, Gamer3D winds up something of a man without a country in this new market. If you're looking for killer performance, Voodoo2 is a superior performer, and Magic3D squarely beats it on price. —DS MaxiGraphics Gamer3D $179 (MSRP) Contact: Guillemot International www.guillemot.com RATED *** * BLASTER GLABS GLABS Guillemot International MaxiGraphics Gamer3D PROS: Solid 3D performer.

Thriller does have several things going for it: solid 3D, good 2D, and Rendition's R Redline Windows 95 3D API. But since we last reviewed the Thriller, Jazz Multimedia has brought their aggressively-priced Outlaw 3D to market, undercutting Thriller by about $40 for a 4MB card, and $70 on the 8MB version.

Looking at Direct3D frame rates, we saw a similar pattern, where the boards were comparable when running on our baseline test rig but the Thriller pulled ahead running on the high-end box. One exception was JEDI KNIGHT, where the two cards were evenly matched. Running Rendition's Open GL driver, Thriller again enjoyed a slight edge running QUAKE II. As for 2D performance, the two cards were comparable running Win Bench 98 on both test systems. Both cards, however, trail the RIVA 128-based STB Velocity 128 on TUROK and JEDI KNIGHT, though were comparable running the other Direct3D titles. The Thriller3D, though a bit pricier than the Outlaw3D, is probably worth the extra shekels for its better performance. As a 2D/3D card, it delivers solid (though not the fastest) 3D, and solid (and just about the fastest) 2D. If your system more resembles our baseline system, the Thriller is a good choice, but if you've got a higher-end box, you may want to consider STB's Velocity 128, depending on what kind of games RATED **** you'll be running on it. -DS Thriller 3D Hercules Thriller 3D $179 for 4MB, $249 for 8MB PROS: Solid 2D and 3D perfor Contact: Hercules Computer mance; great image quality Technology, (800) 532-0600 CONS: Not the fastest; more www.hercules.com expensive than the Outlaw3D. hin 8 MB SGRAM FFC S seu tare SAU uch of the confusion about which 3D card to buy arises out of the breakneck speed at which new chips seem to come out. The only constant, it sometimes seems, is a constant stream of new 3D silicon that continually changes the 3D landscape. As we put this story together, there were a number of new chips on the horizon that will further push the 3D envelope. Here are a few: Matrox, who surfed its PowerVRbased m3D board through last holiday season, is preparing its next part, a 2D/3D 128-bit accelerator called the MGA-G200. Aimed at accelerating the DirectX 5 version of Direct3D, the AGP 2X MGA-G200 will also support anti-aliasing, as well as bilinear and trilinear filtering. With a planned fill rate of about 100Mpixels/sec, it should be competitive with Rendition's V2200 and nVidia's RIVA 128 and RIVA 128 Zx. We saw a first-silicon MGA-G200 running, and image quality looked very good. VideoLogic/NEC are working on the PowerVR Next Generation (PVNG). internally code-named \"Highlander.\" Although this 2D/3D part still uses much of the somewhat unconventional PowerVR architecture, VideoLogic/ NEC have done a lot of work on their Direct3D driver to make PVNG easier to program, which, it's hoped, will alleviate some of the Direct3D teething pains their current-generation part has gone through. PVNG will be a fully compliant AGP 2x part, with a planned fill rate of around 120Mpixels/sec. Other highlights include super-sampling the entire 3D FOR THE POWER USER image up to 1600x1200, and then using a down-sampling filtering algorithm to provide a type of full-screen anti-aliasing that should improve overall image quality. Chromatic Research is readying their second generation MPact 2 accelerator, the followup to its MPact processor, which found a home in Gateway's Destination system for doing DVD MPEG-2 decoding. We put a reference board through its paces and found the performance to be quite impressive on our baseline system, though its numbers on our high-end system were not so encouraging. Of course, the drivers are very early, and those numbers will likely improve somewhat. There seems to be something of a Warhol effect with 3D accelerators: there's a new one every 15 minutes. But to stay on top of the latest developments, tune in each month to the 3D Iron Works at the front of the Hardware section. -Dave Salvator Here's an example of INCOMING running on PowerVR NG CGW 3D SUPPLEMENT JUNE 1998 "

A SCOTIKS PULARA ORA he Outlaw 3D uses Rendition's flagship V2200 3D processor. Using a RISC engine at its core, the V2200 delivers solid 3D performance, good 2D performance, and decent image quality. And the Outlaw delivers Rendition quality at a very aggressive price. We looked at both the PCI and AGP versions. The Outlaw is very basic no TV out, no bundled games--but you can find the 4MB card on the street for as low as $137. The Outlaw's performance trailed the more expensive Thriller 3D, which also uses the V2200 chip. Some of this may be attributed to the memory difference-the Outlaw had 4MB of RAM, whereas both the Thriller cards had 8MB. In fact, the difference in 3D Winbench numbers at 800x600 is probably the difference in memory. You can get the Outlaw with 8MB as well. The Outlaw, however, does use somewhat slower SGRAM. The Outlaw's image quality was quite good, as we've come to expect with Rendition cards. Surprisingly, the 2D Winbench numbers were also quite good-a testament to how far Rendition's chips have come since the V1000. All the games we ran looked pretty good.

The technique is called SLI, or scan line interleave. Guess what: it's been done. Quantum 3D has been shipping SLl-capable Voodoo boards for a number of months now. The reason for the Obsidian 100SB's existence may be waning now that Voodoois finally out, but it's an interesting exercise and may be a hint at what Quantum 3D may be doing with Voodoo. The Obsidian 100SB is two Voodoo boards that are linked by a PCI bridge chip on a single card, in SLI mode with a whopping 20MB of RAM (4MB of frame buffer and 4MB for each of the four texture units).

Some decry it for not being hugely better. Others say it will kill all the other chip companies. In fact, it's a fairly speedy chip that will define the baseline. And it's a good baseline. No maker of 3D chips in the future can afford to ship something less capable than the 740-and this is a good thing for all of us. The Starfighter AGP is an odd mix-in some ways very capable, but with odd limitations. Unlike most accelerator boards, it supports per-pixel MIP mapping. Most cards use per-polygon MIP mapping, which can result in odd texture sparkles as the level of detail changes «If you're moving to AGP, the Starfighter AGP is worth considering.\" Interestingly, although Real3D holds fundamental patents on trilinear MIP mapping, it nevertheless \"simulates\" trilinear filtering by dithering the near MIP maps rather than filtering them. It works, but the dithering artifacts are noticeable in 3D Winbench 98. The performance is pretty good. The 3D Winbench score is somewhat better than the RIVA 128, but this is mostly due to the support of additional quality features. In game testing, the Starfighter and the STB card were pretty close. The image quality in games seemed a bit better, though it was hard to judge. There seemed to be somewhat less texture sparkling in FLIGHT Real3D Starfighter AGP SIMULATOR 98. TUROK PROS: True AGP 2x support: perlooked very good. pixel MIP mapping; fast 3D. The QUAKE Il numCONS: Limited true color support: bers were less than simulated trilinear filtering. impressive, but all we had was a GL wrapper for Direct3D: Real3D will be shipping a full ICD for OpenGL that may be out by the time you read this. RATED *** One aside: The Intel 740 doesn't seem to support true color at better than 1024x768, limiting the card's usefulness for heavy Windows graphics users. Overall, the Starfighter is a balanced card with good 3D performance and excellent image quality, but with a few limitations. If you're moving to AGP it's definitely worth considering, but if you have one already don't throw away your current card just yet. -LC Starfighter AGP $189 (4MB), $249 (8MB) Contact: Real3D, (800) 393-7730 www.real3D.com There's a wealth of information, free utilities, and other niceties on the net.

"Piecing together the 3D Puzzle Skywell Technology Magic3D Compatibility 21 LORE DAN MARTS Logo PIERLO he Magic3D is pretty representative of many of the generic 3Dfx boards that are starting to appear. It's a pretty cheap board, but the performance isn't quite up to par. However, it does have 40ns EDO DRAM, for those of you hell-bent on overclocking. The Magic3D comes with a decent little manual, a driver CD, a pass-through cable, and not much else. The overall 3D performance trails the Gamer3D and Pure3D, making it one of the slower 3Dfx cards we've seen. This is a little odd, considering that the Gamer3D actually ships with older drivers. The Magic3D is generally available only mail order Voodoo Graphics or bundled into PCs from some local clone builders. 3D Graphics Accelerator It's somewhat difficult to find in the U.S., but For Interactive, Texture Mapped Video Games Skywell Technology has a support page along with worldwide distribution information.

Since STB Systems had just released their 1.32 drivers, they were elected. We also tested nVidia's beta OpenGL drivers on the card to get a feel for how well the RIVA would fare in the GL gaming world. As is becoming well known now, the RIVA 128 scales up with clock speed very well. On the 166MHZ Pentium MMX, it was pretty much even with the 3Dfx out any card with your own boards, on the 333 MHz Pentium II, it was one of the eyeballs.

"Piecing Together the 3D Puzzle au How We Tested 1 he focus of this supplement is 3D acceleration, so we spent most of our time immersed in 3D games, although we also put ZD's own 3D WinBench 98 through its paces. There are a lot of misconceptions about 3D WinBench 98. Early on, people assumed that a higher 3D WinBench score meant faster gameplay, but it ain't necessarily so. A card may get a higher score simply by supporting all the expected quality features in hardware, which doesn't always translate into faster games, because most current games don't use all the features used by the 3D WinBench. In that sense, 3D WinBench is a forward-looking benchmark. Though not reviewed here, we included performance numbers for Canopus' Pure 3D for the sake of comparison.

In a bid to differentiate themselves from all the other Voodoo2 boards on store shelves, they'll be shipping the first AGP Voodoo2 board. Dubbed the Obsidian2 S-12 ACP, it will be a 12MB board with an optional TV-out daughtercard. The board will be low profile, and should fit into even NLX-style cases. Suggested retail prices are $399 with TV-out and $349 without it.

Loyd Case and Dave Salvator pace Cadet, by science-fiction pioneer Robert Heinlein, is one of my favorite books. In the story, the powersthat-be inflict a series of tests on the wouldbe astronaut. One test involves operating a complex machine. But after reading and re-reading the instructions several times, it dawns on our hero that successful operation of this particular machine is impossible. When he confronts the instructor, he's just told to move on Confronting CPU choices this year, I feel like that astronaut wannabe. Every time I think I have finally made the right choice, another wrinkle pops up. So I thought I'd cover what will happen on the CPU front in the next few months and solicit opinions. That's right, it's audience participation time once again. First, let me say that this is about Intel compatible CPUs. The vast majority of shipping games these days nin on Windows 95, so I want to stay focused in that arena.

Really, they do. Certainly the company's microprocessor designs are ambitious. Its too bad its manufacturing isn't quite up to the challenge. Okay, I'll admit, I'm being hard on them. But there have been a number of reports about AMDs inability to get good yields on its chip manufacturing. If you want to play David against the Goliath of the industry, all of your cylinders have to be firing effectively. The Ko proved to be a less than optimal solution for serious 3D gaming or simulations. The floating-point unit proved to be somewhat slower than a Pentium classic, even though the integer performance approached Pentium II speeds. Recently, AMD has made a splash with the K6BD. It's an interesting chip: AMD has added 32-bit extensions to the MMX instruction set. These instructions specifically speed up 32-bit transforms (the mathematical functions that are required for 3D geometry and rendering). Since few programmers will want to take the effort to code to a particular CPU (and one with a relatively small market share, at that), AMD is cleverly writing a 3D HAL for Direct3D, similar to the MMX library that already QUANTUM3D HARDWARE PIPELINE Product E.T.A. nVidia RIVA 128 ZX Q2 '98 Matrox G200 Q2 '98 PowerVR NG Q3 '98 nVidia RIVA TNT Q4 '98 Cyrix Cayenne CPU Q2 '98 >>Continued on pg 166 JUNE 1998 CCW "

I've heard rumors that the company is increasing the integration of PC functionality that began with the interesting, but performance-impaired, MediaCX chip. The one other announcement Cyrix made recently is a product code-named Cayenne Cayenne is supposed to have a highly enhanced floating-point unit, something the 6x86MX sorely lacked, awards for floating point performance, but it is cheap. In fact, it's probably the lowest cost, Pentium-equivalent CPU out there. It's not a good fit for 3D gaming or sims, but is interesting because of its inherently low-cost design. What's more interesting are the products on IDT's road map. The C6+ may be shipping as you read this. It has an enhanced floating point unit. According to IDT, the C6+ is a little faster than a may be more support for these instructions in the future. Later this year, the C6+ will move the level 2 cache onto the chip itself. This will likely bring the price of complete systems down to a very low point. Imagine getting a 300MHz system with decent performance down to, oh, $600. It would have good performance, some (but limited) expandability and be a great second system for (CTECH TIPS Control Your Startup Programs Picking up one of the 3D WinBench 98 CDs is a good idea even if you never run a benchmark. There's a nifty program that's installed with the benchmark called Startup Manager. Startup Manager allows you to enable or disable programs that run every time you boot up your systemeven those pesky ones that are set to run automatically in the registry. It's amazing what stuff can be running on your system under Windows 95 without your knowledge. Benchmark CDs are only $5: you can order yours from www.zdbop.com Bulletproof Your Downloads One near-essential program to have if you do a lot of downloads is Bulletproof Software's Bulletproof FTP (BPFTP). Using FTP is a little trickier than clicking on a download link in your browser, but BPFTP is worth the short learning curve. BPFTP can handle partial downloads and will resume where it left off if interrupted. If you've ever been interrupted during a 30MB download you can see how useful this is. Couple it with Vector Development's DUNCE (Dial-up Networking Connection Enhancement), which reconnects automatically and launches up to four programs, and you'll never have to be frustrated by big downloads again. Note that these are shareware programs, so if you use them, make sure you pay the developers. Bulletproof is located at www.bpftp.com and DUNCE can be found at www.vecdev.com/dunce html.

"LOYD CASE HARDWARE HARDWARE multiplayer gaming. This may be the perfect add-on. may even be poorer than a P55C with Level 2 cache. THE BIG KAHUNA It's likely that most of us will still choose Intel this year. The alternatives are more compelling later in the year, though, so stay with me.) About the time you read this, Intel will have shipped the 440BX core-logic chipset. This chipset finally moves Slot I motherboards into the 100MHz system bus arena. That means we have Pentium IIs at 350-and 400MHz, with 450and 500Mhz chips on the horizon, Then there's Slot 2. Slot 2 is targeted towards servers and high-end workstations (read: high-priced, high-margin systems). The cache will run at the same spced as the CPU, as it was in the original Pentium Pro Slot 2 CPUs will have more cache (up to 2MB), but will be more expensive. In fact, there have been some published reports that indicate a 450MHz Slot 2 Pentium II with 2MB of cache could cost over $4,000 for the CPU alone! Slot 2 will also require a new chipset, the 450GX These processors may have a different name, as does the Celeron on the low end. \"Theres also been some discussion of future 32-bit enhancements to MMX, called the «Katmai instruction set,\" after the code name for a future Pentium II descendent. Not much is known at this time, except that delivery will probably trail K6 3D enhancements, but be some what more general purpose. Intel has announced Celeron as the company's low-end product. It's a lowcost CPU in a SEC cartridge like the standard Pentium II, but without the Level 2 cache. The Celeron is targeted for systems under $1,200. The real question is one of performance. With no Level 2 cache, the performance LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER Tall these plans reach fruition, Intel could finally have some serious competition. However, plans on paper don't always make it to reality. Both the K6 and 6x86MX looked great initially, but proved to be inferior to even classic Pentiums in game performance. The Kos floating point is still good enough as a margarine\" alternative to the Intel spread, but unless AMD delivers the volume, its difficult to see it really chewing into Intcls market share. IDTS C6+ looks very interesting, particularly in very low-cost systems. It's minimalist approach makes size reductions easier, and getting the equivalent of a 300MHz Pentium for less than $1,000 would make for much more pervasive personal computing. Only time--and shipping products-will tell **** REVIEW 3COM SPORTSTER V.90 FAXMODEM At Last, a Standard HARDWARE by Loyd Case he whole issue of 56K modems which standard would \"win\" in the marketplace has finally been settled. The ITU (International Telecommunications Union) has finalized a standard known as V90. 3Coms US Robotics division is first out of the block with a V.90 modem, but only by a couple of weeks. Now that there is a single 56K standard, you should contact your ISP about supporting 56K -especially if they've been sitting on the fence waiting for a standard. We looked at the external version of the Sportster V.90, which looks pretty much like all the Sportsters-a short, squat, retro-looking box with a rocker switch and indicator lights. Setup is very straightforward. Connect a serial cable (not supplicd) and your phone line, then boot up the computer. Windows 95 will detect the modem and ask for the driver. Pop in the backward compatibility with X2 is a nice bonus. Current users of US Robotics X2 modems can upgrade to the V90 standard directly from the 3Com Web site (www.3com.com). As the first of numerous V90 modems to hit your store shelves, the Sportster is a solid unit that should be a welcome addition to any Internet user who still needs lo connect via standard phone lines CD, and it will be found automatically. Since we only received one review unit, we couldn't put 1.90 itself to the test. However, we did connect to CompuServe using one of their X2 connections and to a local ISP using V34. The good news is that X2 compatibility is still built into the Sportster. Downloading a IMB file, we saw an average throughput of around 4.9KB/sec-about what you'd expect. The V34 connection didn't seem quite so robust: we couldn't manage better than 26.4kbps, possibly due to line noise. A brief run with Kali and GameSpy netted ping times between 70 and 110, a bit above average for 56K modems. Other than that, what you have is a pretty typical US Robotics modem. The connections seem pretty solid, which is a reliefearly V34 Sportsters frequently dropped connections and US Robotics had to introduce an expensive fix. The APPEAL: Users sitting on the fence, waiting for the standard. »PROS: V.90 modem that can connect at 56K to existing X2 users; easy setup.

"*** REVIEW  STRIKE FIGHTER THROTTLE Split Decision HARDWARE by Denny Atkin The Strike Fighter Throttle is definitely worth a look if you want a well-built, easily programmable controller and you only play a few sims regularly. But if you want to take advantage of the second throttle axis, you'll either have to forgo rudder control or wait for USB controllers to become available. the Suncom Strike Fighter Throttle is a much-needed companion for the companys Talon, Raptor, and Hawk F-15 joysticks, and its even worth a look if you have a competitors joystick. The throttle is a full-sized, heavygauge plastic device that looks almost as if it were pulled from the cockpit of an F/A-18. In addition to the buttons used for programming and mode-switching, it includes two four-position hats, a twoposition whcel, a pinky button, and four two-position switches. Each of these can be programmed with up to six characters. A lever lets you adjust the throttles tension, and you'll find both minimum power and afterburner détentes. Programming is simple: Select one of Price: $129.95 four available program \"slots\" and actiManufacturer: Suncom Milwaukee, WI vate program mode, then press the (414) 352-4002 switch you want to program and type the www.suncominc.com l characters you want to map to it. You can even program a switch from inside a game. While it's nice not to have to deal with a software utility to program the device, the inability to store settings on your computer means gamers who use the throttle for more than four games will be doing lots of manual reprogramming If you release a lock on the front center of the throttle quadrant, you access the device's most unique feature: splitthrottle support for controlling two engines independently. Unfortunately, due to the four-axis limitation of the PC joystick port, activating the second throttle means you won't be able to use rudder pedals. How many sim fans who want a throttle this serious aren't going to have rudder pedals? As you'd expect, the throttle works very well with Suncoms joysticks. Surprisingly, it also works perfectly with a ThrustMaster F-22 Pro stick or a CH Products F-16 Combat Stick. APPEAL: Owners of Suncom SFSseries joysticks; sim players looking for an easy-to-program throttle. PROS: Innovative split-throttle design; simple to program; very well built. CONS: No game support for second throttle axis yet; split throttle-mode won't work with rudders; can save only four game configurations. RAH *** ** REVIEW . DIAMOND MONSTERSOUND M80 Monst So Close DIAMOND M80 HARDWARE If MSO is going to be your only sound card, this is a pretty serious drawback. If you've already got a dedicated game card, then MSO would be an inexpensive way to add positional 3D audio to your system. But if you'll need to use its joystick port for your digital game controllers, look before you leap. by Dave Salvator D positional-audio hasn't yet become the gaming non-mostly because only a handful of titles are using this technology (it also doesn't help that Microsoft's DirectSound3D API is having some growing pains). But 3D positional-audios sun is rising. In its second generation of PCI sound card offerings, Diamond Multimedia has something to get things riled up, and the price is right. Their new Monster Sound M80 is a $99 PCI-based sound card that supports both DirectSound 3D as well as Aureal Semiconductor's A3D API (used by a larger number of games). But the news isn't all good. Setup is straightforward enough: plug the MSO into a free PCI slot, fire up your machine, and feed it a driver CD. One reboot later, M80 is up and running Overall sound quality for wave audio is clean, and in close listening-tests using headphones, MSOS line-out had almost no audible hash (hissing sound when idle). MSOs wavetable synthesizer is adequate, though not stellar. The good news here is that their interface is Wave Blaster-compatible, so if you have a Roland SCD-10, you can attach it, and it should work M80 supports up to eight 3D audio streams via ABD or DirectSound3D, and the effect is very impressive in two garden-variety multimedia speakers. Things were going quite smoothly until I tried attaching several different game controllers to M80s joystick port. ThrustMaster's Rage3D gamepad wasn't recognized, nor was Microsoft's SideWinder Force Feedback Pro, Diamond is aware of both problems, and should have a driver fix to allow Rage3D to work with M80.

"**** REVIEW  MADCATZ PANTHER XL HARDWARE And Carry a Big Stick Panther X Panther XL Is a Lean, Mean, Strafing Machine by Loyd Case the first thing you notice about Madcatz's new Panther XL is how bloody big this thing is--it has almost the same desk footprint as a small keyboard. The Panther XL is the direct descendent of FP Caming's Assassin controller, which we reviewed last year, and FP Gaming has now licenscd its Assassin technology to Madcatz. Since the Assassin needed a joystick for full operation, Madcatz has naturally mated a beefy ergonomic joy. stick with the trackball device from the Assassin into a single controller. Despite its size, the Panther works well either on a desktop or on your lap. The joystick is just a tad big for small hands, but feels very comfortable. In terms of ergonomics, the Sidewinder and Logitech sticks can only aspire to feeling this good. The overall precision of the joystick is right, too-just a little stiff, but not mushy. So as a joystick, it's pretty decent. But this is no more joystick On the left side of the base is a red trackball. The Price: $79 Manufacturer: Madcatz (800) 659-2287 www.madcatz.com THUNDERSEAT trackball adds 3D view functionalitysomething really handy in 3D shooters like QUAKE II. Your right hand operates the joystick, which handles forward movement and strafing; the trackball handles directionality. You can adjust the sensitivity of the ball so that a slight twitch will spin you 180 degrees or you can set it so you have to madly spin the ball to turn around. Spinning the ball left and right turns your view while rotating it forward and backward looks up and down. This two-handed operation takes some time to learn, but once you get the hang of it, it gets pretty intuitive. Circle-strafing-one of the moves I always have problems with when using a mouse/keyboard combo-is a piece of cake with the Panther XL. Another plus is that the programmable buttons on the Panthers basc are strategically placed for easy reach. As a flight stick, it works pretty well; you can even use the ball as a rudder pedal, though its natural use is to manage virtual cockpit views. There's even a separate throttle control. As a controller for 3D Action games, the Panther XL's only real peer may be the classic mouse/ keyboard combo, but if you take a little time to learn how to use the Panther, it may prove even more versatile than that classic setup www.thunderseat.net 1-800-8-Thunder Be practical APPEAL: 3D-action gamers looking for an alternative to the mouse. PROS: Solid joystick, good weight, programmable buttons, innovative trackball. »CONS: Too big; not the ideal stick for flight games. RATED **** ELABS ... or take a ride on the wild side!

"BATTLEZONE  REVIEW Battlezone Tips NOID) V Each campaign has a unique flavor as well. Mission parameters in the NSDF series often change focus, depending on the developments in the strong missionlinking plot. The CCA campaign suffers from a weaker story, but increases the challenge considerably with missions more focused on fighting than on building, While not as ground-breaking graphically as the original, BATILEZONE is still something special, with cool explosions, rockct vapor-trails, detailed texture maps on every unit, and the lightning-tom, acidic haze on Venus. Just make sure you have a 3D accelerator. Also, as visually rich as BATTLEZONE is, the rather wimpy sound comes as a disappointment. BATTLEZONE isn't perfect, but most of its shortcomings are little things, like AT YOUR FINGERTIPS With an overhead and a 3D map, remote cameras, and a remarkably effortless interface, BATTLEZONE keeps you informed while streamlining every facet of gameplay. other game, but BATILEZONE features such a seamless, intuitive interface that commanding never gets in the way of your enjoycnt. Everything is right on screen for you, and every unit is numbered and easy to lind. Very distinct unit voices respond to your commands and alert you to their actions, vastly simplitving management, Then assaulting fortified bases, try to draw out a few tanks before entering the base. This way, you'll thin out enemy defenses. When you start your assault, have support units draw fire from gun towers while you target power generators. Once the easily destroyed generators are down, the gun towers can't fire. After that, take out any constructors before they can rebuild the power sources. Lure enemies to your protected scrap fields. Your defensive turrets will help in the battle, and killing your enemies near your scrap source will keep your vulnerable scavengers from venturing away from your protection. Don't be afraid to pack up and move your base. Since all facilities are portable, go ahead and move them closer to scrap fields and conflict zones. You'll get faster production and you'll be closer to repair and reload facilities. You can still take the high ground even if an enemy is perched on a ledge above you. Charge up the hill and hit your jump-jets at the top. launching yourself in the air. Spin around and fire on the opponent beneath you, who probably won't be able to fire back Have your armory launch some repair and ammo power-ups near an enemy base before you begin your assault.

"* REVIEW  STAR TREK PINBALL DIFFICULTY LEVEL p To Boldly Blow... ACTION by Jeff Green TAR TREK PINBALL.-just the thought of it gets your Vulcan blood boiling, doesn't it? Ycah, me neither. But Interplay, apparently on a mission (I hope it's not a five-year one) to boldly milk a franchise as it has never been milked before, has wedded a pinball game to the Star Trek label. Maybe they're figuring that all five people who thought their WATERWORLD game was a good idea will buy this one, loo. In any event, what you get are three KIRK'S SILVER BALLS \"Experience the world of James T. Kirk.\" Uh huh. Somebody stop the fun. TIME:SHOCK, the current king of pinball simulations. But, honestly, whos going to buy this game for the pinball? Your $30 worth of entertainment is really supposed to come through the integration of Star Trckthemes, sights, and sounds.

The game gets docked another notch for the Nemesis table, a multiplayer-only table that, according to the box and manual, allows hotseat and network playexcept that interplay removed the network play before shipping the game, with no warning to gamers of the omission.

"INTERSTATE '76 ARSENAL  REVIEW **** All Funked Up DIFFICULTY LEVEL E NOTI)V F-'76 ARSENAL Revs Up a Great Action Game and Delivers Some New Thrills by Jeff Green NTERSTATE \"76 was one of the best action games of 1997. It was a stylish auto-combat simulation that won a CGWArtistic Achievement award for perfectly recreating the cheesy atmosphere of 70s TV cop shows. While a truc sequel is now in development, Activision, in the meantime, has taken the original back to the garage, tinkered around, and come up with something called INTERSTATE 76 ARSENAL.. What is this? Well, it's two games in one: a souped-up version of the original game along with a standalone expansion game with new single and multiplayer action. The result is a musthave for those who've never experienced the game, and a probably have for longtime fans looking for more.

While Activision didn't fix our biggest gripe with the original the inability to save in the middle of some of the longer missions they did come up with a compromise solution: difficulty levels to dumb down (or increase) the mayhem. It's an acceptable fix, but be forewared that even on the \"Wimp\" setting, lessskilled gamers are still going to repeat the harder missions over and over. ALL NEW EPISODES! for those who bought the original game, the bigger news is the long-awaited riro PACK, which adds all new single-and multiplayer missions, along with new weapons, vehicles, and multiplayer options.

"***** REVIEW SEARCH AND RESCUE DIFFICULTY LEVEL Sim Lite SIMULATION/SPACE A Fresh Approach That's, Alas, More Game Than Sim by Denny Atkin More on the Way ntense Entertainment has taken a unique approach to flight simulation--they've given us a game in which the goal is to save lives, rather than to take them. SEARCH AND RESCUE puts fliers in the cockpits of a varicty of liclicopters and sends them on missions to rescue crash survivors, transport accident victims, and locate lost ships. \"To pull off rescues, you'll need to make liberal use of the sims external views. Although there's a simple virtual cockpit, you generally can't see the target of your mission once you're actually in position to drop the rescue hoist. Some of the missions are fairly challenging, such as one where you must chase a rhino back into the boundaries of a national park. The actual\"search\" missions generally involve just flying around in a search pattern until you encounter the target and then dropping the rescue winch not very exciting, When you do complete a mission, a radio call announces \"mission accomplished, over and out\" or \"mission failed, Over and out.\" That's it. No stats, no briefing showing the amount of time you spent, nothing EARCH AND RESCUE's publishers seem to realize that the game is a bit simplistic for today's market. They include a coupon worth $20 toward SEARCH AND RESCUE 2, slated for release around the end of this year. Coast Guard Lt. Commander John Padukiewicz, an HH-65A Dolphin instructor pilot, is at the helm of the sequel. He says the new game will feature only a couple of helicopters, but they will be modeled in great detail, with realistic flight models. Also on tap are 3D-card support and more realistic missions. HERC DOWN You'll need to switch to an external view to rescue crash survivors. The game would have benefited from a view from the winch station. SEARCH SARE AND RESCUEHard-core sim fans take note, though. SEARCH AND RESCUE is very mucha game, not a serious simulation. It reminds me very much of the types of sims! played on my Amiga in the carly '90s, scripted missions, small game-works with distinct edges, and a wide variety of vehichicles that pretty much all fly the same. But, if you don't mind the games retro feel, there is some interesting stufflere. CHOPPER BLOCK There are a variety of helicopters here, and they do differ in maximum speed and carrying capacity, but the handling is very similar between choppers. Three difficulty levels are available, ranging from simple arcade-light to a complex model where you must use rudder pedals and a throttle (collective) to fly. The advanced model is challenging, but it can't compare to the realism of LONGBOW 2 or FLICHT to the realism of LONGBOW 2 or FLICHT Sim 98s helicopters. Graphics are fairly simple, with repeating textures. While the game supports just about any VESA resolution (800x600 was about as high as I could get while maintaining a playable frame rate), overall, the graphics have a very simple, retro-gaming appearance. Sounds are very basic. T here's definitely some entertainment value here, but SEARCH AND RESCUES overall feel is just too dated in a world full of dazzling 3D-accelerated games. Too simple for experienced sim fliers, it's primarily of interest to beginners or casual gamers just looking for a fresh approach to sims. Price: $39.95 System Requirements: Pentium 90, 16MB RAM, Windows 95 or NT 4.0, SVGA, 2X CD-ROM, sound card. 3D Support: None. Multiplayer Support: None. Developer: Interactivision A/S Publisher: Intense Entertainment Towson, MD (888) 240-6172 www.intense-games.com MAYDAY! SEARCH AND RESCUES missions revolve around rescuing people using a winch, dropping objects on a target (such as fire retardant on a forest fire), following an objective while a cameraman shoots footage, or stunt-flying missions. Theres a bit of humor here, as well as the occasional Easter egg-such as UFOs you encounter during a mission to rescue crash survivors in the Bermuda Triangle-but, for the most part, the missions are fairly similar. APPEAL: SIMCOPTER fans, beginning gamers. PROS: Unique, nonviolent take on simulations; wide variety of missions. CONS: Simplistic helicopter modeling; dated graphics and sound; missions have limited scope. IS MONICA ONBOARD? One mission lets you fly the president's chopper away from a terrorist threat. Old-time sim fans may find the instrument panel reminiscent of SUPER HUEY. CGW JUNE 1998 "

"***** REVIEW . FIFA ROAD TO WORLD CUP 98 DIFFICULTY LEVEL Big-Time Score Beautiful Graphics and Great Gameplay Combine to Make a Winner by Dave \"Kick Me\" Salvator 64:52 Brazil Ecuador o lot of Americans look at soccer and ask, \"What's the big deal?\" They complain about the lack of scoring, action, and all-out collisions. But for most of the rest of the world, soccer is a way of life. For them, it's basketball, football and baseball all rolled up into one. EA Sports has produced an impressive array of PC sports titles over the last several years, and FIFA ROAD TO WORLD CUP 98 is yet another proud member of that lineup. The combination of stellar graphics and fast, furious gameplay make FIFA 98 a blast for both singleand multiplayer games. When you start the game, you can jump into a quick \"friendly\" game, play an individual country's league, or plot out an entire FIFA season as you and your favorite national team battle your way toward the World Cup. As with its sibling title, NBA LIVE 98, FIFA 985 controls are more detailed, and require more time to master than last year's version. In fact, EA recommends a gamepad controller with 10 (yes, 10) but IN TRAFFIC Brazilian star Romario may be stopped by the double-team, but the defenders are also screening the keeper, which may cost Ecuador a goal. BUY2 GETI tons to really drive FIFA. The variety of controls becomes much more important as you crank up the difficulty level Visually, FIFA 98 is nothing short of stunning, even without 3D acceleration. Adding 3D acceleration cleans up all of the textures and makes the stadium FREE crowd look more convincing. For both day and night games, you'll see shadows from the players: one by day and four by night (to simulate overhead lights). Adding to the overall effect, EA has implemented Dolby Surround for crowd noise. FIFA regulars John Mottson and Andy Gray provide pithy play-by-play commentary, and considering that FIFA uses canned commentary snippets, their comments are well pieced together with no glaring pauses, and are, for the most part, context-relevant. SPORTS Price: $49.95 System Requirements: P100, 16MB RAM, 20MB hard-drive space, 4x CD-ROM drive. 3D Support: PowerVR, 3Dfx, Direct3D patch available. GETTIN' YOUR KICKS FIFA 98 comes at you with three difficulty levels: amateur, professional, and world-class. On the two higher levels, computer Al defense becomes much more intense with many more slide tackles and reach-ins, and keepers become very tough, making saves against all but the best off-angle shots or crossed headers, Because of the more aggressive defense, you'll need to be able to execute what are called skill moves: jukes, head-fakes, fancy ball-handling, and jumping (to avoid going down at the feet of a slide-tackler).

Whether you get the yellow card (two before ejection) or red card (immediate ejection), depends on how you tweak the referees' strictness, or you can leave it at its default random setting One thing is curiously missing You can come in hard to slide-tackle an opposing player and take him down (or viceversa), but there's none of the theatrics so often seen in FIFA matches in which the downed player clasps a shin or knee in hopes of drawing a more severe penalty for his attacker. FIFA's AI, when cranked up, is pretty sophisticated in setting up offensive plays, such as when it has a wing-man sprint down the sideline and kick a long cross to a second wing-man, who then centers to a third player for the shot-on-goal. On the amateur setting. Al defense keeps its distance, leaving gaps large enough to drive a truck through. Keepers also can be pulled out of position much more easily, though they're less aggressive about snatching the ball from a would-be scorer, both on breakaways and corner kicks. As you dial up the Al, the teams do seem to flatten somewhat-defenses become much more aggressive and keepers become much tougher. But when you do finally punch one in, FIFA 98 not only has immediate instant replay, but also has a stop-time, frame-byframe instant replay.

"FIFA ROAD TO WORLD CUP 98. REVIEW www.gtgames.com 49.80 Brazil 4 Uruguay SPORTS CHARGE! On the amateur setting, the keeper is less likely to charge an oncoming defender, whereas on higher skill settings, the keeper becomes more aggressive view the action from all angles. And because FIFA 98 uses a 3D polygonal engine, the effect is a little like being in a scene where time stands still for every one except you. Admittedly, FIFA 98 isn't the first game to do this (INTERNATIONAL SOCCER 64 on the N64 had it first), but FIFA 98 gets points for a good implementation tant keeper, dialing their skills up or down to taste. Nearly all EA games let every sports zealot live out his dream: to be in the line-up of his favorite team as the uberstar. But FIFA doesn't let you create a new player per se. Instead, you have to take an existing player (a benchwarmer), and recast/rename him in your own image. ARE YOU AT THE END OF 90 Despite a few minor lapses, FIFA 98 is the most compelling PC soccer title to date, with great graphics, addictive gameplay, and cool ambient crowd noise. If you're already a devout \"footballer,\" then pick up a copy and strap on your shin-guards. Or if you're just looking to see what the big deal is, then grab a copy and find out. ENOUGH? PLAYING THE CHESS BOARD If you also enjoy playing general manager, you can make adjustments to your favorite team or design a custom squad stacked with your favorite ringers. But you can also cdit individual players' aggressiveness (ranging from \"calm\" to «nutter\") and offensive bias. What's more, FIFA has not only included national teams of the world, but also has internal league teams for a number of countries, replete with rosters. You can pick whom your starters are going to be, as well as decide team formation, wherein you can tweak your three lines, and the individual players in them. A pleasant extra is a single button to reset team settings to default values if you feel you've over-edited and want to start again.

"Batter Up w albe PREVIEW Batter Up It's a Whole New Ballgame With the Arriving 3D Baseball Revolution by Terry Coleman ong before EA Sports aspired to Babe Ruth-like dominance, Trip Hawkins and EA shared a vision: to create the best baseball game possible given the existing technology. EARL WEAVER BASEBALL was a revelation in 1985. It used a physics-based model, yet still managed to rival statistical-based simulations in its accuracy. EARL WEAVER was equally fun to play in action or coach mode, and the Amiga version in particular was so far ahead of its time that it was years before the game's sound and graphics were surpassed on IBM or 16-bit consoles. The sad thing is, despite more than a decade of technical innovations, no one has come close to capturing the magic of EARL WEAVER. This year might finally be different, as PC baseball has discovered 3D in a big way. That means more up close and personal action, more realistically depicted grounders to the shortstop, and some truly visceral slides into third base. Despite the processor overhead associated with 3D, everything should work better than in other sports games, at least in theory: In baseball, you move a lot fewer simulated players around the field at one time than you do in a game like NBA LIVE. What's bringing this revolution about, finally, is that various 3D accelerator cards are in the hands of a critical mass of gamers. The philosophy among most of the major publishers seems to be that baseball games are mainstream enough to require 3D hardware. At the same time, marketers are always worried about leaving out any potential buyers, so some producers are hedging their bets by offering software solutions for those without 3D accelerationalways a tricky proposition. An equally tricky exercise, of course, is trying to separate the championship contenders from the pretenders. The following are our scouting reports, based on how each team looked during the PC baseball season's version of spring training. Keep in mind that while these games were in beta as of press time (and therefore, any given feature is subject to change), we've scoured the virtual locker rooms and peeked around the offices of prominent GMs to give you the latest additions and free-agent signings.

Fleerlin Fleer holder (HARDBALL 5 reportedly sold over a quarter-million titles on the PC). Despite the recent success of the STAR CONTROL and JACK NICKLAUS lines, it's fair to say that HARDBALL 6 will once again be Accolade's flagship for 1998. The design team took the extra year between HARDBALLS 5 and 6 to develop a new 3D engine, which has some of the best Direct 3D support we've seen.

For a game that prides itself on simulation to place so much emphasis on a home-run derby makes you wonder if either aspect will be fully developed. The lack of mouse support in a Windows 95 product is sort of strange, too. The graphics, while 3D, don't have quite the eye-candy quality of HARDBALL 6 or TRIPLE PLAY 99. The GM functions, at least for now, don't quite match up to those of HARDBALL 6 (though they are better than everything else). At press time, 3DO still hadn't committed to LAN or Internet play.

In these TRIPLE PLAY 99 views the main difference between software 3D rendering and 3Dfx (below) is the sharpness of background images 405 so detailed that you can actually recognize your favorite players. Though the game offers force-feedback support and 3D sound, it's probably going to take more than that for Microsoft to make much of a dent in an arcade market dominated by TRIPLE PLAY and HARDBALL. Target Release Date: Q2 '98 Style: Arcade Developer: WizBang! Software Publisher: Accolade/EA Prediction: It will be hard for this expansion team to win in its first year Interplay has been aggressive with its VR BASEBALL Iline since its inception. The first version, released late last year, was one of the first sports products to support 3D acceleration. With 3D graphics finding their way into all the competitor's bullpens this season, however, team owner Brian Fargo knew he needed some new blood to build a championship contender. So, he signed Diamond Mind Baseball to be the underlying statistical engine for VR Baseball 99. If you missed our review of Diamond Mind last year (available at http://cgw.gamespot. com/review/2da6.html), suffice it to say that any. one who really understands baseball will be surprised at how accurately the game engine simulates the nuances of America's pastime. Then there's the Sierra saga. FRONT PAGE SPORTS: BASEBALL has been a perennial underachiever, never coming within a whiff of the PC sports crown so long dominated by its FOOTBALL PRO cousins. Now, to coincide with their new \"Sierra Sports\" branding, the company is completely ditching the FPS name and arcade engine and starting from scratch in BASEBALL PRO 99. Arcade play will now feature full-3D polygonal players and 3D models of every Major League ballpark. The underlying Al is based on the FPS games, but is being enhanced to consider situational fielding and base-running logic. Sierra is also promising to beef up the game's multiplayer support, with head-to-head, modem, LAN, and Internet play-as well as the ability to download Major League stats into your game to keep the numbers up-to-date. It's definitely a rebuilding year for Sierra, but BASEBALL PRO 99 is definitely worth keeping an eye on-they just might surprise everyone come playoff time. -Terry Coleman and Jeff Green. Triple Play 99 When EA Sports goes for an inthe-park homer, they don't usually expect to be thrown out at the plate. But for all its dominance on consoles, the only year TRIPLE PLAY has held the PC crown was during HARDBALL'S sabbatical last year, and you have to think the designers are looking over their collective shoulder Why? Because they've added some minimal GM functions to the game, including career play with a strange kind of \"point system\" salary cap. Plus, the only way to play over the Internet is in manager mode for an arcade game? And, as always, baseball purists beware: Joe Schmoe can hit .500, with 60 home runs-provided your trigger finger stays fresh. If it's arcade action you came for, TRIPLE PLAY 99 looks better in every respect than in previous years. EA's Inverse Kinematics technology lets a batter's head move independently of his body when tracking a pitch over the plate, a nice touch. The fatigue and momentum models have been overhauled, and it's now your decision as to whether to leave your tiring star pitcher in for a complete game, or pull him for your ace closer. I still don't know why a game that tracks 1,300 stats per player can't be more realistic, but at least you can now toggle the arcade functions (such as adjusting the pitch after it's thrown). And if you can put your thoughts of baseball purity aside, the Home Run Derby is a lot of fun—EA certainly knows its audience.

"Baseball Mogul Alle BASEBALL MOGUL STRATEGY 1.Steinbrenner How to Craft Your Own Dream Team in BASEBALL MOGUL by Dennis McCauley ToName Ooolas hile most baseball sims stress arcade action or dugout decisions, Infinite Monkey's BASEBALL MOGUL elevates sports gamers to the owner's suite. Here, wouldbe George Steinbrenners make the highlevel choices that will either build a dynasty or lead their club into mediocrity-perhaps even bankruptcy. However, decoding the intricate relationships between ticket sales, roster moves, city population, and even the price that the beer man charges for a cold one can be as difficult as hitting a Curt Schilling fastball. Don't fret too much: there's no need to hold a fire sale for your ball club just yet. CGW, the gaming magazine that first recognized BASEBALL MOGUL as a brilliant diamond-in-the-rough, is back with strategies to help you transform your personal Bad News Bears into a digital redux of the '27 Yankees.   1 Don't Price Yourself out of the Market Having bought your way into baseball's ownership circle, it's time to make the hard business decisions that will determine the financial future of your team. While setting ticket and hot dog prices may seem less than glamorous, their effect on attendance will have a serious impact on your ability to sign important free agents or keep your own key players when their contracts expire. But how do you determine the optimal ticket price? The simple rule-of-thumb is to charge roughly .05 percent of per capita income. In the Big Apple, for example, with its per capita income of $27,000, this translates to charging $13.50 for admission. Charge more, and you'll lose fans to other sports entertainment options. Charge less, and you'll suffer unrealized ticket income. like Coneheads MogNam more Dennis the Menang Magd and consume Di suy Lovt mass quantiMogul ties of beer, hot dogs, and OK ice cream dur Cancel ing the games.

(What a gastronomic combination!) In higher-priced towns like New York, you can get away with a proportionate increase in concession prices, so jack those beer prices up to $3.00, and don't apologize for it. If you stray too much above the suggested prices, however, your fan loyalty will suffer a small hit, which, in turn, adversely affects both attendance and local TV revenue. Speaking of the boob tube, TV revenue represents another of those critical dollars-and-sense decisions that will put your managerial instincts to the test in MOGUL. With a complete TV blackout being counterproductive in terms of fan loyalty, your choice ultimately comes down to pay-per-view vs. free local coverage. Pay TV is the best long-term solution, particularly in larger markets, as it generates substantial income that can then be used to sign big-ticket free agents and upgrade your club's infrastructure. Whatever you do, pick one television strategy and stick with it, since there is a fan loyalty penalty every time you switch from free coverage to pay-per-view.

"NASCAR Grand Nationals STRATEGY AND TIPS NASCAR Grand 2 Nationals admits that there is no magic cheat key-but we will explore what it takes to get competitive with the lead pack. The rest is up to you. How to Negotiate Those Treacherous Ovals by Gordon Goble he dozen new Grand National Series (GNS) tracks from Papyrus for NASCAR RACING 2 nearly doubled the number of tracks included with the original title. And while it's true that no less than 10 of the 12 GNS tracks are ovals or derivatives thereof, anyone who's serious about racing will tell you that each is a completely unique driving experience. Just try taking a California setup to Hickory, and watch as Mr. Tire heads you straight for Mr. Wall in one big hurry. The purpose of this article is to help you run smooth, clean races on those challenging GNS ovals. Everything that follows presumes that: the opposition strength is pegged at 100 percent (substantially more challenging than the default 97 percent); realistic damage is on; the field is full; and race distances are set through at least one pit stop. You won't come away with a magical solution to all that hinders your quest for a championship-even Papyrus' GNS Primary Test Driver Tony Johns readily Racing School Most of the top GNS drivers spend as much time behind the wheel testing as racing. So it's in testing that you want to get the car going as fast as possible, at the same time piecing together a setup that's not too wild. After all, when you're racing for real, there's nothing worse than sliding all over the place in traffic. You also don't want to see those tires burning up halfway to a fuel stop, so getting the right setup is a tricky procedure, to say the least. In the cockpit, there's no shortage of data to monitor. Hit the \"S\" key to watch your speed at four critical junctures: the end of each straightaway and the apex of each turn. Remember that the speed you carry through the slowest point in the turns has a big effect on your speed all the way down (and at the end of) the following straightaway. And learn how over-steering is depicted vs. under-steering; if you aren't careful, you'll end up making adjustments the wrong way. Hit the \"F4\" key to keep an eye on your tire temperatures, and prepare to make adjustments should they not be equal across the inside, middle, and outside of each tire. I've never encountered a durable setup that didn't have perfectly balanced temps all the way around the course. And finally, check the oil pressure light at the end of each straightaway. If it regularly starts flashing three-quarters of the way down the straightaway, it's time to bump that top gear up until that lamp illuminates just before you turn in. GORDIE G?

Like most ovals, Texas is a rhythmical thing that rewards a smooth approach. With the tires nicely warmed and fuel load just dropping from the full mark, you should find the speedometer approaching 190mph nearing the end of the front straightaway.

"Wild World of Sports Alley 19 **kit Wild World of Sports Sports Games off the Beaten Base Path by Robert Coffey omewhere in the world of sports, there is a place without big TV-money and multimillionaire athletes, a place where there is nary a strategically placed Nike swoosh. It's a place where the seemingly ubiquitous baseball, basketball, football, and hockey are non-entities. And guess what? They make computer versions of these sports-although in some cases, they'd have been better off leaving well enough alone. Here are our picks of the best, the worst, and the simply unfathomable in the wild, wild world of acquired-taste computer sports games. Trophy Rivers **** Qierra's TROPHY RIVERS ends up providing a great deal of fun. Yeah, I know, you're not going to see a trout on When Animals breel Tree 123 Attack, but at least fish fight back. In TROPHY RIVERS, the fish fight back a lot. I was happily surprised at how engrossing the strugLogbook gles were between angler and fish, at times taking on satisfyingly epic proportions. The mouse-driven interface is easy to learn, yet doesn't shortchange challenge, with fly-casting becoming a delicate art at higher skill levels. In order to make sure that really big fish don't become \"the one that got away,\" you will have to make the right selections from a slew of rods, spinners, flies, and more. Owners of force-feedback joysticks are in for a special treat-with all that jerking and pulling you'll wonder if there's something other than a gameport at the end of your joystick. Gamers with reservations about killing even virtual fish, take heartthe game is strictly catch and release. To top it off, TROPHY RIVERS supports modem, network, and Internet play, letting you compete against friends in custom-designed tournaments. APPEAL: Fishing enthusiasts and newcomers alike. PROS: Plenty of challenge; great force-feedback support: lots of options. CONS: Must download a patch to get force-feedback owling, the Rodney Dangerfield of sports, gets no respect. With its inherent image problem, making a bowling game that's both engaging and true to the sport would seem difficult, at best. So it should come as no surprise that ALLEY 19 and TEN PIN ALLEY (see review next page) both live down to expectations, albeit in different ways. With its kitschy look and '50s-style music, ALLEY 19 is like one of those theme restaurants that specialize in neon novelty drinks, costumed waitresses, and 100 different ways to embarrass you on your birthday. But no matter how many unemployed actors sing the menu to you, the food still stinks; and ALLEY 19 is the same way. In spite of its relentless attitude, the gameplay just isn't there. You don't bowl as much as steer the ball, tracking out a path on the lane with your mouse. Sure, it's easy-too easy. You'll be rolling turkeys (three strikes in a row) by your second game. Unfortunately, you'll be treated to a chorus line of turkeys cum Rockettes for your efforts. What little charm it has, this game quickly loses. APPEAL: Gamers looking for a quick, unrealistic bowling fix PROS: Easy interface: decent music; network play; dancing bowlers. CONS: Too easy: relentless attitude reminiscent of Richard Simmons on a caffeine binge. Price: $39.95 .

TEN PIN lets you customize such details as your ball's weight, surface material, and appearance. The multiplayer options include leagues and tournaments-a must for serious bowling competition. Instead of aiming your mouse, TEN PIN ALLEY uses a bowling meter similar to the swing meters found in golf games. Three clicks set ball spin, power, and your release point. It's hard to bowl accurately, and the meter's insistence on imparting some degree of hook means you can't roll the ball straight. So any right-hander trying to pick up a spare by knocking down pins on the far right of the lane will be frustrated as he watches the ball curve away for a total miss. And, to make things worse, the character graphics are really jagged. For the only real fun in this game, instead of clicking for a release point, try watching your character fling his ball backwards over his head, APPEAL: Gamers looking for a slightly more serious bowling experience.

First off, there's just the one game-snooker-and while it's a fine game, it doesn't offer any variety in play. VIRTUAL SNOOKER's engine is a couple years old now, and its DOS-clunkiness really shows. Only a handful of aged graphics-cards are supported, forcing owners of more recent cards to go through a tedious trial-and-error hunt to find something compatible on the game's limited list. Failure forces you to use the 320x240 VGA default, resulting in the ultimate in blocky graphics-finesse shots are effectively eliminated by balls that look more like Lego stacks than spheres. The game's sound is barely adequate, and the instructional videos aren't particularly interesting, either. Unless you're a rabid snooker fan, pass this one by. APPEAL: Die-hard snooker fanatics.

"Wild World of Sports Cricket 97: Ashes Tour Edition *** Virtual Pool 2 ZSPORTS * Mielbeurt zich There's no more genteel la sport than cricket, 3.4 Overs and CRICKET 97: ASHES TOUR EDITION does a solid job of recreating that experience. The focus is on the timeless duel between bowler (pitcher) and batsman (hitter). There's no strike zone in cricket, so you'll swing away at everything, using a simple interface to choose from 18 types of swings. Bowlers aren't shortchanged in options either, with about as many pitches to choose from, including the dreaded leg cutter. Fielding is mostly automatic, with your only responsibility in throwing to the proper wicket. The unique ambience of this very civilized game is perfectly captured by the droll commentary of legendary player Richie Benaud and the hearty huzzahs that greet stellar plays. Cricket isn't too complicated. However, the game noticeably lacks any explanation of the rules, so you'll be left in the dark on terms like \"overs.\" Graphics are another drawback, with players jaggedly rendered-even in hi-res mode and it would have been nice to have more than just eight teams included with the game. Still, if you're interested in Cricket, this is a great introduction to the sport. APPEAL: Cricket fans and those intrigued by the sport. PROS: Good recreation of bowler/batsman confrontation; entertaining commentary, elegant controls; real cricket ambience.

GLECTRONIC If cricket is the European equivalent of baseball, then rugby is Euro-football. Fast, tough, and hard-hitting, rugby isn't a game for wimps. Unfortunately, trying to play INTERNATIONAL RUGBY LEAGUE (IRL) can be equally brutal. Supposedly a Windows 95 product, IRL wouldn't run on the three different Win95 systems I tried. Giving up, I ran it in DOS. While it was fairly smooth and looked okay—with small bitmapped players charging up and down the field, knocking the hell out of each other—the controls were mushy and very unresponsive. While IRL SINTE offers lots of different play modes, you can't adjust the difficulty. Throw in the bad controls, and you get a steep learning curve, a terribly lopsided score, and a wholly unsatisfying gaming experience. Americans will appreciate the manual's solid job in explaining rugby, but the game is unpleasant enough to chase even the most die-hard rugby fans away. APPEAL: Pool players of all levels. PROS: Beautiful to look at, a pleasure to play, instructional videos for basic play and trick shots are actually helpful; variety of games and play options. CONS: Finicky 3D-support and Pentium II optimization may cause crashes during setup. APPEAL: Only for obsessed rugby fans. PROS: The manual helps to explain rugby.

It doesn't get any more statistically realistic than this, if you can handle the lack of graphics. Diamond Mind Baseball Diamond Mind *** Sierra *** BASEBALL Front Page Sports Baseball '98 Grand Slam Baseball Virgin While better than the previous year's catastrophe, it has a long way to go as both action and simulation. Looks and feels like a bad console game, complete with weak stats, bad interface, and poor trade Al. Entertaining 3D action not quite as fresh or fun as last year's version, and you can forget any claims of stat accuracy An embarrassment for the once-proud franchise; dust off your old copy of TONY LARUSSA 3 instead. Triple Play 98 EA Sports *** Tony LaRussa 4 Maxis ** AN OT Sports ABC Monday Night Football 98 Front Page Sports Football '98 Heroes of the Gridiron Sierra FOOTBALL OT Sports A winner in its second season, with great graphics, solid action, and the best play-calling interface yet. Still the best football sim, but the weak multiplay and lack of 3D hardware support make for a rebuilding year Bland multimedia and questionable stats are overcome by good Al, fast action, and fine selection of all-time college gridiron greats. This failed attempt at cross-era pigskin action was the biggest disappointment of the 1997 PC sports year. Better than last year's team, but weak Al and poor GM functions keep this out of the playoffs again. Legends Football 98 Accolade Madden 98 EA Sports NBA Action 98 Sega NBA Live 98 BASKETBALL EA Sports Realistic enough, but its dull play-by-play and game-speed problems make it a pretender to NBA Live's crown.

TrueSwing is a nice alternative to the traditional swing meter, and it works well with the nice graphics and multiplayer options.

"REVIEW  ARMOR COMMAND The New Tank Wars STRATEGYZ WARGAMES he cross-genre wars are heating up, with action gamers looking for a little brains and real-time strategy types seeking a greater adrenaline rush. While ARMOR COMMAND tried to straddle this line, another title, UPRISING, a Christmas season sleeper from Cyclone Studios, got its version of the same concept onto shelves first. Due probably to its longer baking time, ARMOR COMMAND is a better-looking game that makes better use of cutting-edge 3D technology, specifically lightsourcing, to immerse gamers in the game world. UPRISING isn't exactly old news in the graphics department, but does suffer somewhat in comparison. On the other hand, the graphics in UPRISING are more interactive, so players can climb hills and use the terrain to their advantage. In ARMOR COMMAND, the terrain is little more than a pretty background Once you get past the visuals, though, the two games diverge sharply. ARMOR COMMAND delivers relatively deep, traditional real-time strategy with a new viewing angle-but UPRISING is a true hybrid that delivers on its promise, allowing players to drive a vehicle on the battlefield as well as to make the odd strategic decision. The emphasis is on the battlefield in UPRISING, SO there is a corresponding weakness in the strategic game that wargamers, especially the reflex-challenged, may not find very welcome. UPRISING still expects you to gather resources in real time and use them to build new units, but you had better be a skilled tank driver as well. Of course, this little competition between strategy tank games may be all but over with the arrival of the new heavyweight on the block, BATTLEZONE from Activision (see our review this issue). While leaning heavily on the action side of things, initial intelligence reports indicate BATTLEZONE may easily have what it takes to utterly dominate in this new cross-genre, and reduce both ARMOR COMMAND and UPRISING to also-rans. SIDE BY SIDE In this new action/real-time strategy hybrid, ARMOR COMMAND (pictured at top) is competing against the likes of UPRISING (pictured below) and BATTLEZONE. And after all this, ARMOR COMMAND managed to ship with a major bug that made the game unplayable. By the time you read this all shelf copies should be at least the bug-free 1.02 version, but if not, be prepared for a trip to patch land. After all is said and done, ARMOR COMMAND is a competent COMMAND & CONQUER clone with a good gimmick and quite a bit of gameplay for your dollar. It's just unfortunate that it looks like so much more on the box was concerned with extending that look simulator control over any of the vehicles. toward enhanced gameplay. Despite all the whole 3D aspect of this game has little this visual bounty, graphics really have impact on gameplay in any way. For one little to do with the actual gameplay. thing, while the terrain is very nicely renwas surprised when I discovered all this dered, it's strictly from the bad old days of 3D hoopla was mainly cosmetic. The ground sims, where vehicles could travel majority of the time in this game is spent only across perfectly flat surfaces; the in the traditional overhead map, mancu slightest hill stops your tanks dead.

Another annoyance is the fact that your chase camera rotates only horizontally; you can't shift the angle up or down in order to gather battlefield information-aircraft reconnaissance is actually more informative when using the top-down view. On top of this clisappointment, ARMOR COMMAND saddles you with a pointlessly goofy interface driven more by the keyboard than DEATH FROM ABOVE While the effects-such by the mouse. Since this is your basic real-time wargame, it is as fog, nighttime lighting, and snow-are new, beyond me why the traditional set the two sides (alien and human) aren't. Here are of click-'n drag controls weren't some mundane human air units. good enough for this game. APPEAL: Traditional real-time players who want a new look without too much distracting innovation. PROS: Excellent 3D graphics; some good real-time strategy gameplay with a competent computer player. CONS: 3D graphics turn out to be just a gimmick with no real impact on actual gameplay; interface is needlessly complex; initial release has a critical bug. CGW JUNE 1998 "

"SEMPER FI  REVIEW Aggressive Al? You Make the Call ne of the tests of a good wargame is how aggressive-and smart-the Al tries to be. The computer opponents in SEMPER Fi have more forces than you, but their units are usually of lower quality. Some of the battles seem almost like cakewalks when played from the Marine side. However, if you try playing the OPFOR, you may get your head handed to you. The Al is reasonably aggressive and clever about deploying its assets. SEMPER Fi has a nifty Al editor installed in the game directory. Think the Al is too focused on victory hexes? Turn down the emphasis on victory hexes and have the Al chase company commanders instead. Want the Al to push forward with close assaults against armor? Crank up its aggressiveness against hard targets. If you carefully play around with these parameters, you can almost create the game you're looking for-within limits. MAKE YOUR OWN HISTORY One minor disappointment is that the game is entirely hypothetical. There are no historical scenarios in the game, and all the weapons, vehicles, and off-board support are modern. Don't be fooled by scenario titles like Task Force Smith; all the scenarios and campaigns are modern hypothetical battles. After playing huge games like EAST FRONT, the relatively brief (but welldesigned) scenarios and campaigns are a refreshing departure. None of the battles I played were more than eight turns long. Despite the relatively few turns, the initiative phasc rounds not only made the combat very fluid, they also made the scenarios seem longer. Still, no single battle took more than a couple of hours. Two of the campaigns cover relatively familiar territory. There's a modern-day Korean War invasion, and a second Iraqi war. The third campaign, Pantelleria, is set on a small island in the Mediterranean, not far from Libya, and it's probably the easiest to play You'd think that the Iraqi campaign would be fairly easy, given what happened in the Gulf War, but these Iraqis are made of sterner stuff. All of the campaigns revolve around battles involving second-or third-rate military forces.

TACTICAL DEFEATS The game is mostly bug-free, although I ran into a couple of minor glitches. Several times, pressing the Quit button did nothing (which can be cured simply by pressing the reset button). Still, this occurred only three times in many hours of gameplay (and even then, the save-game function keeps you from losing the game you've been playing). On other occasions, clicking on a unit's weapons didn't activate them, and the wrong weapon fired The most frustrating problem was the user interface. This is partly due to the leader-oriented nature of the game, but selecting and deselecting were awkward operations that required constant double-checking. Casual clicking can lead to real disaster here, so take some care when selecting units. The right mouse button is usually the safe one. The campaigns and scenarios are relatively short, but they're good enough to leave you wanting more. The Al editor and scenario editor, however, combine to make a flexible \"Marine construction kit\" that greatly increases replay value. Unlike most turn-based games, SEMPER FI's initiative system makes for a good multiplayer game over LAN or modem. Despite the flaws, it's great to see a game come out on a different subject, with battles that can be easily played over a long lunch break. SPARTAN GRAPHICS Marines deserve a better graphic treatment than the one they get in SEMPER FI. the Corps against tougher foes, such as Russian paratroopers. Although none of the campaigns or individual battles is hislorical, they are all nicely balanced. Unlike in a game such as STEEL PANTHERS, there's no role-playing clement here: Units can't be renamed and units carried over in campaign battles are regenerated. For those of you inclined to create your own battles, there's a flexible and casy-to-use scenario editor. You can even alter initiative levels to simulate the effect of running up against elite forces. APPEAL: Wargamers looking for something different to play in short increments. PROS: Nicely simulates chain of command; initiative-based phases keep play fluid; cool Al editor. >CONS: Very dated with awkward interface; needs historical scenarios and a longer campaign; Iraqis too tough. TACTICAL VICTORY All in all, SEMPER Fl is an above-average little game that could only have benefited from higher production values. JUNE 1998 CGW "

Even scasoned travelers--time travelers, that is need to go somewhere really special once in a while. 'Those in the know come here, to the Presto Studios Travel Agency. If you don't believe me, check out this brochure for our new LEGACY OF TIME package: four days, three nights in three of the greatest cities that ever cxisted Atlantis, El Dorado, and Shangri La! See each just days before and just days after its fiery destruction. No mere rainforest tour can compare! Like all Presto tours, this package is all-inclusive: you get round-trip transportation and you don't have to worry about food or lodging Plus, exclusive to this tour, you also get unlimited use of a Chameleon Jumpsuit, perfect for interacting with the natives. (Using the jumpsuit, you can take on the appearance of anyone you see-perfect camouflage, and a blast at parties!) Travelers who have been mindwiped are advised to bring a functioning Al guide with them. If you don't have one, we advise you to pick one up from an abandoned jumpsuit before traveling too far. Some other tips might help you get the most from your tour, we've taken the liberty to outline a few. Bon voyage! get to get some local currency before your trip, don't worry. You can usually count on a fellow foreigner who appreciates dire straits to help you out. Among the sights to see are Atlantis majestic windmill, its memorable temple, and its salt-air dockyard. And don't miss the bazaar, where you can pick up a souvenir for the folks back home! Get some olive oil at the oil merchants and a pot in which to keep it at the potters. Should you be lucky enough to visit when the potter isn't around, you can even take a little of his clay and fire it yourself, for a onc-of-akind memento. If you have a little gold leaf, you can even make a darling medallion just like the temple guards! W hile in Atlantis, don't limit yourself to well-worn paths: Athletic travelers should feel free to do a little climbing and enjoy the view of the city from the heights of a docked ships masts. And if you see anything you like, help yourself: Whether it's a sailor's hooked spear or a beggar's bowl, it's a mark of an Atlantean's hospitality not to mind if you take something that belongs to him. The highlight of your trip will be your visit to the sacred temple ceremony at Atlantis holiest spot. You'll have to enter from an underground tunnel, so be sure to let the water drain first; the central well at the temple is the place to take care of this. And once you're inside, enjoy a closeup look at some fascinating alien technology. Normally we'd say \"Don't touch!\" but this time, go right ahead. One reminder: The courteous time traveler always leaves things as they were before he came. When you return to the surface, turn the Day One: Atlantis The crystal blue waters of Atlantis are beautiful, but remember that swimming is not allowed: 'To get around, you'll want to keep some pocket change on hand and ride the city's gondolas.

"STRATEGY & TIPS: JOURNEYMAN PROJECT 3 GAMER'S EDGE water back on at the well. And if you see something rising from the water, consider it your reward for good behavior. Day Four: Home Again much-deserved rest awaits you back at home, but first Customs has a little test for retuming travelers, a sort of IQ test involving the three pyramidal artifacts you've brought with you. Don't panic. It may seem like there's time pressure, but there isn't. Most travelers will do best to handle this one the old-fashioned way, with a pencil and a piece of paper. Number the elements of the symbol you have to construct (there are 9) and write down which elements are on every possible pyramid face (there are 27, counting all orientations). Then select the combination of three pyramid faces that contains an odd number of every element. It's as simple as that. And remember, the next time you're planning a trip, that it was Presto that left you saying, \"What an incredible journey!\" Day Two: El Dorado From oceans to jungles: On day two you're in steamy South America. Giant hot air balloons can take you from peak to peak, but before you go flying off, take a few minutes to look around and chat with the locals. A sleeping boy by the well can give you your first chameleon disguise. Another fabulous religious ceremony is in preparation just a balloon ride away at the main temple. Read the story of the ancient battles being celebrated (and pick up a little gold leaf while you're at it they call the place El Dorado for a reason). Don't miss the opportunity to talk to El Dorados shaman; a guard is posted to keep tourists away, but a simple garden knife should be enough to distract himif you use it to sever his balloons mooring lines. El Dorado is a city famed for its architecture: be sure to enjoy the view from above the temple in the shamans own balloon. You may want to sketch the patterns you see here. This is a once-in-a-lifetime sight, and you never know when you'll want to remember it. Back on the ground, wake the boy and get a talisman from him-no, he won't give it to a time traveler, but he will give it to someone who looks like his shaman--and use this talisman at the arrowhead pool to drain out all the water. For a chance to look around inside the temple, just unlock the doors (your balloon sketch should tell you which four carvings to press) and cool down the temple fires by retrieving the talisman and letting the pools water back in. And while you are on this part of your fabulous journey, if you see something you like, take it. A day after you leave, the whole city will be destroyed, and they won't miss one little artifact.... Day Three: Shangri Lan On day three, the air gets thin, so bundle up! Iligh up in the Ilimalayas is Buddhism's most private retreat. All the rich and famous end up here, so don't be surprised to see the mighty Genghis Khan lay down his sword for a bit of serene meditation. If you'd like, you can take his sword, but do it quickly when he's not looking-Genghis is no Atlantean! The best way to get around is through the cily's well-heated steam tunnels; use your spear to enter outside the green shrine and then consult the map from the greenhouse if you get lost. The temple is the central building you can visit, but save yourself some time and visit all the city's shrines first. In the tunnels below the greenhouse, use some of the water from Atlantis to heal the dry roots: up above, you can use the fruit of your labors to collect a holy bead from the garden shrine. (You can also collect the gardener's knife-who knows where it might come in handy?) Outside Genghis' tent, use his sword to collect a bead from the warrior shrine. Use the book of knowledge the Lama gives you (if you pose as Khan and show that you know your Noble Truths) to get a bead at the green shrine; and while you're talking to the Lama, you can get another bead from the prayer hall shrine if you present it with an alms bowl. The black shrine in the tunnels is not as solid as the rest: Shut the steam doors to direct some extra heat toward it and you'll get another bead as your reward. Finally, in the entryway to the main temple, play your mantra on the prayer wheels to get your last bead. (You may need a bit of oil to fix the squeaky wheel.) Once in the heart of the temple, place cach bead in a Buddhas hand to ascend to the heavens-a beautiful climax to an exhilarating trip! On your way out, be nice to the staff...and for some local color, chat with the pilgrim praying in the snow PAY YOUR RESPECTS You're on vacation, so you can afford to be magnanimous: Take time out from your whirlwind tour of mythic sites to visit not a friend, but an old enemy, who has a change of heart on his deathbed (and some important news for you).

It will take a while to get close, but if you rush things you'll find yourself overshooting the leader and starting over from scratch.

Enter F-22s«simulator\" mode and select the refueling training mission. The manual adequately describes the process of finding and approaching the tanker. Here, we'll look at the end game, from the last mile out until successfully hooking up. Begin by establishing a 75 knot closure rate and drive right up behind the tanker. Maintain the closure rate until you're about 0.5nm from KC-135 (as indicated on the HUD). Quickly pop the speed brake and slow to 50 knots closure. Retract the speed brake immediately Feel n the Terror Massively Multiplayer. Only ONLINE! STEP 3: Establish a stable position about 0.1nm behind the KC-135. It's Not You, It's Me When you start getting close, you'll probably notice that squashed bug start to move around a little. At some point he'll drift way above you. When you start a gentle climb toward him, he'll dive like a madman for the deck. Just as you think you've aligned your heading with his, you'll see him sideslip rapidly across your nose. \"What the heck is this idiot doing?\" you'll wonder. Odds are he's flying straight and level: In 99.99 percent of the time, it's not him veering wildly about the sky, it's you. It's not just a «simulation\" thing, either. That's how it happens to real world pilots learning formation flying. This takes us back to that important rule of thumb: make very small corrections. It may seem like you're not moving the joystick much, but you'll still be making massive overcorrections. If you find yourself above the lead, don't try to correct the altitude difference all at once. Lower the nose an almost imperceptible amount, and then throttle back slightly to keep from gaining speed. Level out and smoothly reapply power. Lather, rinse, and repeat until you reach the appropriate altitude. After each correction, the aircraft takes a few seconds to settle along the new flight path. Cive the aircraft time to stabilize before making further adjustments. Be slow, methodical, and patient. Slowly move in close and hold a 10-foot separation.

"GAMER'S EDGE Close Quarters in-flight refueling is certainly a risky endeavor. Having two aircraft-one of which is filled with highly volatile fuel-operate in such proximity is inherently risky. Further, there's always a risk of problems connecting or disconnecting to the receptacle. It's not unheard of for the booms used by the U.S Air Force (and featured in F-22 ADF) to do serious damage to the recipient fighter, even to the point of penetrating the cockpit. During connection, the flight dynamics of both refueler and recipient are altered. Tanker pilots report being able to tell when a receiving fighter has connected. The speed differential between the two aircraft is also critical. In some cases, the tanker is flying at max speed, yet the fighter is operating just barely above stall speed. Operating two aircraft at opposite ends of their flight envelopes at such close range is tricky business. Overall, the major advantages of refueling outweigh the risks, especially since practice, skill, and professionalism can substantially reduce the danger. Join the TOUR... Massively Multiplayer. Only ONLINE! UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL An F-117 takes on fuel from a KC-135. Flying in such close proximity is tricky. Jack Pucklaus after establishing 50 knots closure rate, and reduce throttle to 63 percent. Any higher throttle setting will cause the F22 to accelerate, making it hard to maintain a constant closure rate. Continue forward to 0.3nm, occasionally extending the speed brake. By the time you reach 0.3nm range, closure should be reduced to 30 knots. By now you'll be in the tanker's wake, so don't be surprised if you feel some buffeting. Align your fuselage with the KC-135s boom and slowly proceed forward. Again, occasionally extend the speed brake, reducing closure rate to 15 knots. Slowly drift forward to 0.1 nm range. At this point, I tend to reduce throttle to roughly 59 percent, bring the closure rate to zero, and stabilize in formation directly behind the KC-135. Make any altitude and heading corrections while maintaining position 0.1 nm behind the tanker. Now, for the final approach, slowly increase throttle to 63 percent. Keep closure rate under lOkts-preferably closer to 5kts. Fly forward to the boom, and then past the boom. You have to continue forward until the director ONLINE GOLF TOUR lights beneath the KC-135 become visiblc. It may be a little surprising how far forward you have to fly. Now, with a few gentle corrections the boom operator should masterfully guide the boom into your aircraft! More than likely, though, you won't connect and will fall out of position, forcing a new start. Don't be discouraged: Mastering aerial refueling takes a considerable amount of practice. Don't force your way in. Practice holding position 0.1 nm behind the tanker until you can stick to it like glue. If you can't hold formation at this position, you'll never steer it into a connection position, It may sound like boring, dull, repetitive work. In fact, it is dull, boring, repetitive work! Mastering the process, though, provides considerable flexibility in your combat operations as well as a more realistic flight experience. Further, it makes you part of an elite group: the relatively small number of simulation pilots who can successfully refuel. www.jacknickonlinetour.com GAMESTORM.

CRASH HOUSE If you stay overnight at the Crash House in Junktown, you can cam lots of experience by talking down someone in a hostage situation. THE MALTESE FALCON If you have special pharmaceutical needs. visit Vance in the Hub. The best way to get info about Vance is from Jacob, the arms dealcr. If you've missed that opportunity, talk to the shady looking guy, Lemmy, outside The Maltese Falcon. Then again, if you're looking for drugs because you're an addict, you can always try going cold turkey. RADSCORPIONS First, snag one radscorpion tail for the doctor in Shady Sands. Next, find the weak spot near the cave's entrance and use some dynamite to seal off the entrance. You can find dynamite in Vault 15. EXTRACTING DEATHCLAWS If you're having trouble getting rid of the deathclaws in the Boneyard, it's because you haven't killed their mommy Find the stairs in the northcast corner of the warehouse, take a deep breath (save your game now!), and head down to kill her. PULSE IN THE GLOW FARMING BY HYDROPONICS Where's the part that Miles wants for his hydroponics farm? Try looking in the deathclaw area just to the east of the main building It may or may not be on a body, depending on how long you've been looking. Petra Schlunk Take out the comatose sentry robots in the Glow on your way down, so you don't have to deal with them on your way out when they're alert. You'll still have to fight several wideawake robots, but pick up the Pulse Grenades on Level 4 and use them to demolish such remaining annoyances. Sports VIRTUAL POOL 2 se the tracking option during practice 5 w play to improve your shot angles, but don't play the game with it on. Instead, line up your shots first, then turn on the tracking option to see if you'll be accomplishing what you want. If you're close, keep it on to get an idea of how little you need to move to refine your aim. Eventually, you should try tweaking your aim without the tracking option and using it only to double-check your refinements. This way, the tracking feature becomes a tool, not a crutch.Getting just the right touch with the cue is vital to success in VIRTUAL POOL 2. If you're consistently hitting your shots too hard or too soft, adjust the mouse trackingspeed accordingly under preferences.

The Mbest way to get around this is to improve your skill at breakthroughs. After a successful initial attack, move cligible mechanized 2 B 92COB units next to an unattacked enemy during pursuit. Mechanized and air units that didn't attack in the first combat adjacent to the new target can be included in the second combat. Hence, you get two attacks for the price of one Air reconnaissance seems reasonable, but it leaves combat aircraft away from the fighting for a week. Instead, use your ground units for recon. Assign the \"No Zone of Control\" movement mode to a mechanized unit, thereby tripling its movement factors. Move the mech unit around until the S E message \"Enemy Zone of Control\" appears, then click\"Back\" and continue moving After all vectors have been explored, click \"Done\" without click ing\"Drop,\" with the result that as far as the game engine is concerned, the unit hasn't really moved yet. You can use \"Moves No Attack\" for similar benefits: a shorter range, but with the ability to move through zones of control. --Jim Cobb Hills Roads Maginot West Wall City m oving infantry across an open field under Renemy machine-gun fire is no picnic, but it's often a necessity to win a scenario. The key is to cover your sneaking grunts with a smoke screen you lay down with mortar fire. Eventually, your troops should be able to close to within grenade range of their objective. Patrick Miller Action Classics & Puzzles QUAKE 11 If you thought the secret chamber hidden beneath the final boss was id's only in-joke, you probably missed this hidden Easter egg. When you reach the Upper Palace, you'll soon find yourself in a room with a series of shafts; take the downward shaft. When you reach the lower level, there will be a series of entryways blocked off by forcefields, and you'll spend a good deal of your time on this level opening these passages. However, once all the passages are open, enter a room with a small pool of acid nearby. Take the plunge and swim quickly through the corridor underneath. The adjoining room has a DOOM logo on the wall and a picture of Carmack and his famous Testarossa on the other wall. If the photo looks somehow familiar to you, it should: it was taken by former CGW editor Chris Lombardi for our cover story on Doom II, way back in 1994. By the way, if you don't feel like shutting down all those forcefields manually, you can bring up the console interface view via the following method: Hit the key. Then type noclip to turn off clipping, which will allow you to walk through walls. -Jack Rodrigues and Thierry Nguyen SHANGHAI: DYNASTY cres a cheat for gamers who want to beat their highest speed in a round of SHANGHAI Tournament, or for those who simply want to check out each tile-set's cool multimedia animation without solving every layout. This cheat will work only in the Shanghai or Toumament modes of SHANGHAI DYNASTY, so don't try it during a game of Pandamonium or Dynasty. First, create a file in the game's directory named CHEATER (the contents of the file don't matter). Begin a new game of Shanghai or Tournament and hit CTRL-Y, then remove pairs by hitting the spacebar. Once you've activated this cheat, don't try to use your mouse to remove tiles manually, as this will throw everything off and may result in an odd number of tiles left at the end.

"HALL OF FAME WELCOME TO THE COOPERSTOWN OF COMPUTER GAMES. Here you'll find, raised upon pedestals, the games that broke the records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted trances for hours untold. ALONE IN THE DARK (1-Motion, 1992) Lovecraftian horror goes 3D, with shifting camera angles adding to the creepy atmosphere. LEMMINGS (Psygnosis, 1991) The lovable cartoon Lilliputians were hits on every platform BATTLE CHESS (Interplay, 1988) The Franklin Mint of computer chess games with violent and funny animation disguising a solid Chess engine. LINKS 386 PRO (Access Software, 1992) Topped the leader board in graphics and realism for its era. WARCRAFT BETRAYAL AT KRONDOR (Dynamix, 1993) As rich and imaginative as Raymond Feist's world itselt;its 3D perspective was fresh. M-1 TANK PLATOON (MicroProse, 1989) Realistic sim that properly focused on armored formations rather than single vehicles: good mission designs CHESSMASTER (Software Toolworks, 1986) The Cadillac of castling, this chess masterpiece gets better with each version. MASTER OF MAGIC (MicroProse, 1994) The atmosphere and variety of Magic: THE GATHERING with the sophistication of CIVILIZATION COMMAND & CONQUER (Virgin/Westwood Studios, 1995) Moved beyond Dune Il with innovative features and multiplayer play, almost single-handedly causing the current real-time strategy game explosion. MASTER OF ORION (MicroProse, 1993) Remarkable diplomatic Al; deep and varied technology tree, aliens required radically different playing styles New Inductee! WarCraft II Thether WARCRAFT II is better than COMMAND & CONQUER (a recent Hall of Fame inductee) is a matter of personal taste. Both games are largely responsible for the current real-time craze. While each owes its origins to DUNE II, WARCRAFT II carved out its own destiny, eschewing the military theme of C&C for a fantasy motif. Moreover, WARCRAFT II added new depth to the real-time model with a more sophisticated economic model. WARCRAFT II created a second school of realtime gaming, one that still included the quick-thinking tactical aspect of C&C but also added far-reaching strategy in the form of upgrades, spells, and tech. nology research. It's a more cerebral, resource management-heavy model that only AGE OF EMPIRES has managed to match. WARCRAFT II was noteworthy for its incredibly intuitive interface (remember the novelty of that smart rightclick command?), amazingly polished SVGA graphics, and its simple, yet robust, scenario editor More than anything, however, WARCRAFT II will always be remembered for its engaging personality. The designers added many delightful little details to make the world of Azeroth come alive. Each unit had its own quirky voice (or grunt), and the goblin alchemist's shop in the snow levels even sported Christmas lights. We could go on, but suffice to say that this game had it all: incredible gameplay, great graphics, fantastic multiplayer support; and unmatched personality. There can be no question that WARCRAFT II belongs with the very best in the CGW Hall of Fame MECH BRIGADE (SSI, 1985) Modern armored battles with improved KAMPFGRUPPE system and more realism. DAY OF THE TENTACLE (LucasArts, 1993) Offbeat sequel to MANAG MANSION the interactive equivalent of a classic Chuck Jones cartoon DOOM (id Software, 1993) Revolutionized PC action games and network gam ing: surpassed in technology but not gameplay MECHWARRIOR 11 (Activision, 1995) A serious treatment of Mech design and resource management, combined with complex and addictive baltles, legitimized \"giant robot simulations.\" DUNGEON MASTER (FTL Software, 1987) Trend-setting graphics, digitized stereo, and great hack-and-slash from a decade ago.

FRONT PAGE SPORTS FOOTBALL PRO (Dynamix, 1993) Physics based system, good Al, and unmatched career play make this the ultimate in pigskin play. WING COMMANDER II (Origin Systems, 1991) Darket story, grittiet feel, sound card advances, and tougher Al made this a sequel of sequels SID MEIER'S PIRATES (MicroProse, 1987) Combines pirate adventure, action, RPG, and strategy to make the most successful hybrid of all time. TIE FIGHTER (LucasArts, 1994) Most satisfying Star Wars space combat game to date lets you live on the dark side ULTIMA III (Origin Systems, 1983) Coherency and surprising subtlety emphasized role playing, and set the tone for later Ultimas ULTIMA IV (Origin Systems, 1985) High concept RPG explored meaning of virtue and put the role in tole playing GETTYSBURG: THE TURNING POINT (SSI, 1986) First variable order of battle changed the look of all American Civil War games on the PC. Sid MEIER'S RAILROAD TYCOON (MicroProse 1990) SM City meets 1830 with robber barons for emphasis, WING COMMANDER III (Origin Systems, 1994) Surprisingly satisfying FMV space opera didn't lose the essence of the space combat game GUNSHIP (MicroProse, 1989) Great character continuity, R&R for fatigued pilots and even sick leave; best chopper fare until Jane's LONGBOW.

THE BARD'S TALE (EA, 1985) Pioneered three point animation, 3D color mazes. and automapping. X-COM (MicroProse, 1994) Premier tactical squad level engine combined with alien tech research and pop culture for a sci-fi game nearly as addictive as Civ. KING'S QUEST V (Sierra On-Line, 1990) Redefined the graphic adventure with non-textbased parser and VGA graphics.
