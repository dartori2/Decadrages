"EXCLUSIVE! NINTENDO SUPER CD As you can see from this picture, the CD-ROM unit for the Super NES is one spanky looking piece of kit, stylishly designed to sit underneath your Super Nintendo. But what sort of punch will the wonder machine really pack? Rumours abound of the capabilities of the Famicom CD-ROM unit. The top secret tech specs have recently been sent to developers and the news is excellent. The machine will have all the benefits of a Philips CD ROM drive as well as a huge RAM cache (fast loading with no lag). Best of all is the inclusion of new graphics hardware. This definitely includes sprite scaling and rotation (at present the Fammy only does this with backgrounds), but most importantly a polygon chip. This means that the Fammy or SNES will be capable of smart flight Sims and 3D games. The audio capabilities are gobsmacking. The Fammy already uses CD quality samples but the CD means that speech and real instruments can now be incorporated. Pricing looks like a big plus too: when launched in America the machine is expected to sell for $199 that's about ! So now all you prospective Super NES owners know what the CD unit will look like and what it's capable of. Are your trousers still dry? What's wrong with you! SPECIAL REPORT CD SCOOP SHOCK CVG GRABS THE LOTI GEBED XCLUSIVE!! Just as CVG was going to bed (stained smoking trousers and Co-Op Yellow Label for us!) something incredible happened. Out of the blue dropped these amazing first pictures of all the greatest console goodies in the world including the first ever impression of the long awaited Super NES CD-ROM! Our spies in Japan say these represent the very first look at all the new machines, giving you a glimpse into the future of computer gaming across the world! You just don't get any hotter than this, so here are the CVG boys with the full lowdown on each machine as known at present! Remember, you can't get your hands on them yet and they won't be around for ages, but we're so hot we've decided to tell you about them anyway. Take it away lads... The lovely, sexy, Super CD Smart animation is one of CD ROM's advantages AJVC's all in one unit! EXCLUSIVE! JVC MEGA CD Sega developed the Mega CD in conjunction with JVC. As part of the deal, JVC are allowed to release a combined Mega CD/Megadrive unit. In a sleek plastic case, this is certainly more aesthetically attractive than the Sega setup. It will be totally compatible with both cartridge and Mega CD software and will hopefully come in at a low pricepoint, definitely under 300. Worth a look if you've got neither a Megadrive nor Mega CD and want to splash out on some seriously spanky kit! 016 "


"NEWS PHILIPS A The Philips CDI is looking good (if dull). EXCLUSIVE! PHILIPS CDI The Philips CDI is set to be the new standard for CD units. It has a lot in common with Commodore's CDTV, but is techni. cally far superior. There are no firm details on the machines full specifications as yet, but 16 Bit oversampling, live video and a host of extra editing features look very likely. The ma chine is aimed at home users for education, entertainment and reference purposes and a lot of people are backing this little filly as the future of home entertainment. Mmm. The initial CDs will include encyclopeadia, games and educational software so now yer know. EXCLUSIVE! SONY PLAYSTATION This looks like the sad lad of the pack. This hybrid of a Famicom and a nonstandard CD unit looks set to have the same awesome success that Sony's Betamax format had. Ace it ain't. It will be able to run Fammy carts, but not the CDs. Sony have pledged to support the new format, but from what we can gather that's about all. SONY The sad Sony Playstation may get left by the wayside. Sony's smart Data Discman! WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT, BRIAN.. So there you are the look of all the upcoming CD goodies revealed together with a fair few tech specs to boot. Can't say fairer than that, John! Which do you reckon is best and why? Drop us a line at: CD SURVEY, CVG, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. We'll print a selection of your best letters and award free software to the top of the lot. Get going! A Heavy Nova on the Mega CD. Heart of China on the PC CD ROM NA UN A Sol Feace on the Mega CD.

"REVIEW SUPER SWORDS 'N STUFF You're armed with a Ninja sword sharp as hell, very fast and perfect for those close encounters and if you don't like hand to hand fighting you can pick up a range of throwable weapons, mostly shuriken. Your jumping and climbing abilities are unrivaled and you can cling, spiderlike, to almost any surface. The baddies generally use weapons including knives, bombs and machine guns. So, it's special Ninja underpants time again as you use the ancient arts to save the Universe! ARCADE ANTICS The original arcade game was nothing like this. It had more in common with Double Dragon than with Shinobi. Called Shadow Warriors here in Britain, Ninja Gaiden failed completely to take the arcade world by storm. This version has more emphasis on platforms than fighting. The NES version was all but identical to this, right down to the smart intro screens. PC ENGINE  BY HUDSON SOFT ordy, lordy! It's Ninja Gaiden! This game has turned up in quite a few guises over the years. The arcade game was released over here as Shadow Warriors and the home computer versions were faithful to the coinop, but the NES version was totally different. This is a conversion of the NES game, but with souped-up graphics and groovier sound. The game has a long and fairly involved plot as you seek revenge for your murdered father and try to gain the affections of a saucy girlie. To do this you have to make your way across a hazard Infested Japan. Through cities and countryside you roam, but in every location you have to do just one thing...kick ass! Mc Gaiden's Just hanging around JUST WHAT IS A NINJA EXACTLY? Well I'm glad you asked, 'cos I just happen to know the answer. For a start they're not warriors, nor are they heroes. The Ninja were the lowest class in feudal Japan, ranking even lower than beggars. They were widely despised for their total lack of honour or self respect. Ninjistsu isn't really a martial art it's a combination including most importantly, Shinobijitsu, the art of stealth. So there you have it, the Ninja were a bunch of fairies with lovely black hats on! HOW HIGH CAN YOU TRY? The Ninja in this game, let's call him Kev for want of a better name, has some rather neat abilities. For one thing, he is great at climbing. He can use his special Ninja claws to cling to even the smoothest surface. Sadly though, Kev can't climb straight up and must use his awesome jumping powers to scale any heights. This means you can't go straight up a wall, but you can scale it if another wall is opposite. by leaping back and forth between walls. Dead handy. The PC Engine has a whole load of fabby platform related beat 'em ups but this is sufficiently different to merit a further look. Graphics are at first a little dull, but they improve rapidly as you progress through the game with each level becoming more colourful and detailed than the last. One niggling irritation is the special comedy scrolling. This is a truly abominable piece of programm ing as the foreground smoothly slides by, the background judders and shakes its way past. The music is remarkably unspectacular for the otherwise funky Engine, but the chopsocky tunes suit the game well enough. The clever climbing abilities of your Ninja sprite are ruined a bit by the iffy control method, but it's not too bad. There's no doubt that this is playable. It's great fun and very, very difficult. The frustration builds, but it only makes you want another go. The range of weapons available is enormous and the use of magic potions and recipes adds to the fun.

"REVIEW NES .99 BY KONAMI They're hard, they're happening and they're I right here for you to read all about 'em! They're the Turtles and the Battleloads and the greatest games mag ever scoops the universe once again to grab 'em both for a double Exclusive review spectacular! So if you're a canny console hero and want to know which amphibious superhero you ought to be playing with, this is the place to be. Take it away boys... A LITTLE PIZZA THE ACTION STMENTS ARCADEGAME The Turtles' favourite food is not as you'd expect, plankton or water lilies, but Pizza. Yup, stodgy, cheesey, smelly Pizza, Fortunately for the Turtles, if they eat slices that appear at various intervals, they regain lost energy. Sadly though, bits of Pizza are few and far between and there's fierce competition to get to them first. REST 2< KONAMI 1990 et your thinking gear around this one: first there's Turtles on the NES, then there's Turtles in the arcades. Then there's Turtles 2 in the arcades and now there's Turtles 2 on the NES, which is actually Turtles 1 in the arcades. Makes perfect sense really. This conversion of the Konami arcade machine is by Konami themselves, so they ought to know what they're doing. The game is a horizontally scrolling beat 'em up for one or two players which owes a lot of its style to Double Dragon and games of that ilk, but is actually a lot faster and more frantic than most of them. Take control of your favourite Turtle, be it Raphael, Michaelangelo, Donatello or Leonardo and prepare for some pizzapowered action! What a load of balls! Shredder watches as you kick ass! Admit it, NES owners you weren't exactly over the moon with the first Turtles game. This sequel though is thankfully a top notch rendition of the coin-op. Konami have successfully managed to cram almost every single feature of the massive arcade game into one tiny NES cart. The gameplay is dead simple and extremely satisfying walk along and knock seven shades out of an assortment of baddies. The coin-op graphics have been reproduced very faithfully It's hard to believe an NES can actually produce visuals of this quality and sound is cool as well, featuring all the arcade tunes and a selection of thumping sound effects. The game plays like a dream. In one player mode it's a treat-filled scrolling beat 'em up, but with a mate it's totally fab. This has to rate one of the most accurate arcade conversions on the NES so far and a pat on the back to Konami for a job well done. Hang on April! THE SAD, SAD SEQUEL FRANK O'CONNOR Appearing in the arcades as you read this is Turtles 2, Turtles In Time. This is a poor, sad, low quality sequel if ever there was one. Looking more like an ST game than a state of the art coin-op, it judders along like a shuffling old woman. The game sees you and your fellow Turtles travelling through the mists of time in, strangely enough, another beat 'em up. 024 "


"REVIEW liinilills. lllil Everyone's been holding their breath for aaaages for Turtles ll on the NES and now it's finally here! Unlike just about everybody else! wasn't the greatest fan of the Turtles coin-op. It was good for a few goes, but the excitement wore off quickly and there were other goodies to go for at Johnny Silver's Arcade Emporium. It has to be said that the NES conversion is excellent and I've been playing it a damn sight more than its arcade daddy! Graphics are big and bold, with fab main sprites of all four half-shell heroes doing what Turtles do best, and sound is pitched just right for the action. Initially Turtles Il is a treat and a half, but eventually its shine does wear a little thin and the repetitive gameplay becomes a bit of chore. Recommended if you're one of those people who's still pumping his change into the machine or you're completely nuts about the Turtles themselves, otherwise have a good look at Battletoads (reviewed over the page!) before deciding where to splash your cash. TIM BOONE A Is this baddie Be Bop or Rocksteady? TOOL UP YOUR TURTLES Everybody knows who the Turtles are, but here's a brief rundown for sad thickies who just crawled out of suspended animation and don't know anything about them. Raphael uses Sai, sort of blunted knives, while Donatello uses the Boa six foot staff. Michaelangelo is a top Nunchaku expert while Leonardo uses a devastating twin-sword technique to put paid to anyone who's giving him a bad day. So which turtle do you pick to kick some behind? All have similar skills, yet each uses a different weapon. The actual differences between characters are minimal, but you'll probably feel at ease with your fave. All you have to do is reach the end of each level and destroy the big boss lurking there. Your ultimate adversary should be the Shredder, but Krang is always lurking in the shadows. The Foot clan are armed and dangerous, but your skill and top reflexes are more than a match for them. Go for it. NES Alt's a flying Turtle! Leonardo does a runner!

"REVIEW NES .99 BY TRADEWEST ZIT, RASH AND PIMPLE There are only three Battletoads, presumably because they're a good bit harder than the Turtles. They are all possessed of smart martial arts skills. These can be further enhanced by picking up weapons dotted around the landscape, including bits of destroyed robots and even feathers. It's a bit harder than it sounds though, as the weapons are often difficult to use. Give 'em some stick! Afhat's lean, green and totally mean? What V y amphibious creature has mastered the martial arts and learned the secret skills of Ninjitsu? Nope, it isn't the Turtles, it's the Toads! These guys are even harder than the Turtles although admittedly not as handsome. Tradewest's invention already has its own cartoon series in the States and looks set to take the world by storm. The Toads are all named after teenage skin disor ders, their names are Rash, Zit and Pimple. It's dead obvious that they're a parody of the Turtles, but the emphasis is on comedy rather than action. The main villain of the piece is a lovely, yet strangely cruel lady, the Dark Queen. This rather saucy vixen has kidnapped Pimple and his girlfriend Angelica. It's up to you, as either Zit or Rash to go get them back before her Royal Darkness does away with Angelica and has her way with Pimple. The game is very similar in structure to the Turtles game, but there are as many differences as there are similarities. The basic Double Dragon style of play has been enhanced with the addition of a major platform element. There are also special levels, such as the speeder bike section where the gameplay alters radically. Check it out! Thwack 2 Take that, boyol VERTICAL MADNESS The second level is a real nightmare, where you have to descend a chasm, knocking out and avoiding baddies as you climb. Your rope isn't all that sturdy and the scissor beaked birds will try and cut your life short. This section requires skill, daring and a fair bit of luck. Even worse, if you continue you start from the top of the chasm again. Ooh! it's um, it's a long-legged chap! Here's a bunch of guys to rival the Turtles for sheer side-splitting comedy. The Battletoads aren't exactly original, but they are funny and they do make for a fun game. Rare, the company who designed the game have been responsible for some of the greatest NES titles ever and this is no exception. The gameplay borrows style and ideas from all over the place and it works a treat. The one player game is challenging and fun, but with two pals on the pads it's a laff riot. Graphically, Battletoads makes the NES do backflips. Packed full of colour, smooth scrolling and with some of the funniest animation ever. The music is good, right down to the funky drumbeat that plays when you pause the game. The presentation merits a special mention. There are absolutely tons of intro screens, all brilliantly drawn and animated. The story is funny, the characters are hilarious and the game itself is totally excellent. If you want a good alternative to the Turtles game, then this beats it by a mile. Probably the best beat 'em up available on the NES and certainly one of the best looking games for absolutely ages. Toadally awesome FRANK O'CONNOR 026 "


"REVIEW We first saw Battletoads months ago, when the Turtles phenomenon was still very much in evidence. Now that fad has passed, leaving room for Rash, Zitz and Pimple to move in and haven't they just! This is one fine NES game for which the player will have to use all his gamesplaying skills if he wants to get anywhere near the end! Battletoads is just so well put together, from the amusing and excellently presented still screens to the ingame sprites and backdrops. There is some really funny animation. For instance, when your Toad lays into a baddy his fists and feet swell to immense proportions to deliver the final, crushing blow a brilliant touch. Music and sound matches the graphical quality, with a host of fitting tunes and thumping spot effects. There's even a ditty when you pause the game! All these touches, coupled with the wickedly addictive gameplay that's had us glassy-eyed in front of the NES, makes this one cart that you'd be toadally off your skull to miss! PAUL RAND Cor, It's Toad World and no mistake! PLAN A mi ACT END OF LEVEL AWESOME-NESS CHASM SPEEDER BIKE BONANZA The Toads are very adept motorcyclists and they get the chance to prove this as they hurtle along on gravity defying mopeds during the game. This section calls for split-second timing as you avoid brick walls and leap over huge chasms. You can't slow down on these things, so you'd better have sharp reflexes if you want to avoid a grisly and instant death. The end-o-level bosses in Battletoads are excellent. You only get to see a little bit of it as it creeps onto the screen. The look of horror on the Toad's face as it takes a butchers is a sight to behold. You then see the action from the baddy's point of view, as he tries to off you with a laser cannon. You have to lob rocks at him, effectively towards the \"camera\".

They've got one baaaad reputation, and to be fair it's not entirely unjustified. After all, they do get up to rather a lot of mischief. But they love it and, hey, if it keeps them happy who's going to stop 'em? There is a downside, though. And for this particular scaly geezer It's that, no sooner has he completed one quest, he's summoned to swoop right into another. The sequel to the Dragon Spirit coin-op from Namco, Dragon Sabre puts you in the shoes or should that be talons of the mythical beast of the title, to do what comes naturally; fly through level after level, wiping out everything in your sights. And that's it, reallynice to see these dragon types have morals. FLAMING NORA! So you start the game with a piddling burst of flame which wouldn't toast a slice of Mother's Pride. Luckily, those silly enemies have left power-ups around the playing area for you to pick up and use. They're stored in eggs, which need to be bombed in order to get at the goodies inside, because they're on the ground and can't be hit by normal fire. PAUSE PAUSI PRUSE PAUSE CREATURE FEATURE The nasties come thick and fast in Dragon Sabre; the usual waves of flying beasties mingle with the more exotic, such as little phoenixes which turn at the base of the screen, grow to massive proportions then fire out an arc of bullets. Then there's the seemingly peace. ful plant-life don't go too close because they open up and turn into vegetarian vacuum-cleaners that suck you toward a barrage of enemy fire! I'm obviously a bit of a sad man, but I never thought that Dragon Spirit on the PC Engine was a particularly engrossing game. After all, there are hordes of shoot 'em ups doing the rounds on the machine, the brill Gradius and R-Type being just two, so it was always doomed to relative obscurity. Now here's the sequel and there's little, If any, difference between this and the original. In actual fact, the graphics don't look quite as good as those in Spirit, being slightly blockier. Sound is a bit of an annoyance too, although some of the tunes are quite listenable. As for the game itself, well. Been there, done that, read the book, ate the jelly mould figurine. Simple, up-the-screen blasting fodder at its most mind-numbing, with nothing to make Dragon Sabre stand out from the crowd. If you're a big fan of the original, or a lover of dragons, then you might like to give it a whirl. But I think I'll pass, thanks. PAUL RAND PAUSE 030 "

Some of the enemy waves have a flashing nasty at the backthis is the one carrying the power-up. Just shoot him and the item is released. The bonuses range from speedup to different weapons to an extra head or two to either double or ever triple your firepower! It's been a long time since Dragon Spirit appeared on the Engine and even longer since it appeared in the arcades. Dragon Sabre takes the same formula and tries hard to improve upon it. The game itself is a straightforward vertical scroller, with extra weapons, end of level baddies and all that business. The graphics are quite lovely and a definite Improvement over the original. What hasn't changed, is the gameplay. There really isn't much to seperate this game from the original. It's a good old laugh but people who already have Dragon Spirit will be most upset if they buy this. To all intents and purposes, it's exactly the same game. The same weapons, many of the same baddies and very similar bosses. None of this bodes well for the sequel. Good tunes, loud and impressive sound effects help, but it's just another shooter. If you're dying for something like this, better try Gunhed or even Raiden Trad. Both games are far superior to this very average blaster.

The big beasties in Dragon Sabre range from fairly simple to downright impossible.

"REVIEW SUPER NES BY SETA $45 STADT RECORD 1 Exhaust Heat! It's a very strange name for ra very strange game! Anyone who's played games like F1 Spirit and F1 Circus will know exactly what this is all about. The two games mentioned used an overhead view with multi-directional scrolling to portray the Formula one action. As you can see, F1 Exhaust Heat uses a 3D view, very similar to that used by F Zero. The gameplay is very simple. You race around a track, picked from a very large selection, qualifying initially and then racing against other drivers. These drivers all have different cars and driving styles so the competition can get quite fierce. Your car starts life as a sad shuffling effort, but win some prize money and you can upgrade the engine, tyres and chassis. Damage can be inflicted as you scream around the track, so pit stops are sometimes in order. You have to be careful how you use the pit stops, because you lose valuable time while making repairs. The object of the game is to reach the top of the world formula one ratings and win a massive golden trophy. You also get a smart girl and a big bottle of champagne. Hurrah! The other drivers in the game are all based on real life Formu la One heroes. To avoid legal bills, the names have been changed to protect the innocent. This means you have racers with names like Proteus (instead of Prost) and Manson (instead of Mansell). The drivers aren't accurate copies of the originals either, because Mansell never comes second. MULTIPLE TRACK ACTION One of the really great things about F1 Exhaust Heat, is the massive selection of tracks you can race on. There are sixteen in total, each based on famous tracks around the world. You have to play them in order of difficulty and for some weird reason, Britain is the easiest of the lot! There are very definite techniques for the tracks and memorising the bends and twists will take quite some time. or no EIGHT 2003: 3 m RANDPRIX We've been waiting for this game for quite a while. Early screen shots made it look like an accurate racing sim and true enough, there are a lot of accurate features. The gameplay though, is more arcadey than simulatorish and it works extremely well. Graphically, it looks spectacular, super smooth scaling and rotation adding to the realism. The sound is funky. There's a good bit of sampled speech, some excellent music and brilliant sound effects throughout. The huge selection of tracks makes for a varied and lasting challenge. It's a shame there isn't a two player mode because head to head frolics, be it on a split screen or on linked machines, would have been a top treat. The handling of the car takes a bit of getting used to. You can't throw it around bends, but you can't make it spin out of control either. Once you've had a few laps of this brilliant racer, you'll be totally hooked. SNES owners aren't spoiled for choice on the racing front, so this is the best bet until Top Racer comes out. A smart sim with great graphics and wonderful sound. FRANK O'CONNOR CUSTOM CAR CAPERS The car you start out with is mucho crappo, so you have to upgrade the engine and chassis bits. You do this by winning prize money and buying bits of kit before the next race. This kit includes awesome engines, terrific tyres and smart suspension. You can also fill an auxiliary tank with nitro, very handy for those emergencies at the finish line. It costs a fortune to buy the stuff, so choose carefully.

"DEPOULTY LEVEL 1 MODE SINGLE PLAYER See KEYBOARD REVIEW NEXT PECE ON SORO ON ON PC  BY SPECTRUM HOLOBYTE LOAD GAME BANG BANG THE MIGHTY FALL One of the main differences between the original Tetris and Super Tetris is the falling, bombs. Every time you complete a line, two bombs fall from the sky. These can be moved and rotated just like pieces. The difference is, that when they land, they de stroy any pieces they hit. If you manage to complete more than one line, you get more bombs. A Tetris (four lines) gives you eight bombs. These make clearing the screen much easier and much faster. If you're clever, you'll get bombs every sec. ond turn. Hurrah! NEW GAME QUIT Choose the options that suit you best. 180 PAUSE Tetris! The game that spawned a million imitators and started a whole new trend in puzzle gaming. Tetris is the game that made businesses grind to a halt and arguably made the Gameboy. The original Tetris ranks among the best selling computer games of all time and has become a classic and a standard by which others are judged. Alexey Pajitnov, the genius responsible for the creation of Tetris has come up with a sequel. Is it possible to improve upon the incredibly addictive, yet completely simplistic gameplay of the original? Alexey reckons it's possible. Super Tetris uses the same basic concept as the first game. You have in front of you a pit. Various jigsaw type shapes fall into this pit. By rotating and moving the pieces, you must fit them together to make complete horizontal lines. When a line is made, it flashes and then vanishes. The object of the game is to empty the current screen of pieces. It's a kind of kinetic, frenetic jigsaw puzzle and this sequel adds new features. The major addition is bombs. These appear every time you complete a line. If you complete more than one line in a single drop, you get more bombs. That's all there is to it. Drop the pieces, make the lines. 50 Those bombs could be very useful! PLAYING FOR TIME There are three main play styles in Super Tetris. You can play by yourself for as long as you like until the game becomes completely impossible. A one player game can also be played against the clock, in five, ten and fifteen minute periods. You can play two different double player games. These can be played competitively or cooperatively, it de. pends how nasty you're feeling. 2599 PEL PRUSE PAUSE So here it is. The world's most eagerly awaited video game sequel. Alexey Pajitnov took the world by storm when he designed Tetris and great things were expected of this. The game is dead similar to the first one. The same block dropping antics and the same addictive qualities. The thing is, it's much too similar to the first game. Graphically, it's come on in leaps and bounds. The intro screens and the in game art are all wonderful. The music is a bit annoying but at least there are a few new sound effects in there. The addition of bombs and bonus lines makes a subtle difference in the gameplay and introduces a nice rhythm of play. There are lots of options available and the simultaneous two player action is a real boon. Scoring is a little more complex and you can amass some massive scores by using bonus lines and hidden treats. The bottom line though, is that if you already have a copy of Tetris, you might as well forget about buying this. If you don't have a copy of Tetris then buy Super Tetris. It's excellent, but what a shame it's so similar to the first game. FRANK O'CONNOR AUh oh, this could spell disaster! PC It's looking very tight! WHAT A PICTURE In the Tetris pit, there's a picture. This starts off concealed by pieces. The more Pieces you clear, the more picture you'll be able to see. Obviously, when the whole picture is revealed, the screen is complete. One of the driving forces behind this game is the desire to see what picture comes next. Mind you, it's not all-consuming or anything GRAPHICS 84 SOUNDS PLAYABILITY 90 LASTABILITY OVERALL 89 "

Grab that wheel, step on the gas and drive like a maniac 'cos that's all you can do to survive the rough 'n' tumble world of off road racing! So what are the rules? There aren't any really! Just drive as fast as you can and beat the other guys past the finishing line, whatever it takes! Are you going to be the James Hunt of the stadium and be nice TOYOT MICKEY THOMPSON OFF-ROAD EKLE *150.000 350.000 and polite to everyone, or will you become the Dirt Destroyer wiping out all who cross your path? Decide quickly, because we're talking big bucks here and unless you're out to win and win big you might as well go and flog overpriced little bags of peanuts on the stand because that's about how much cash you'll be taking home... TOTOTA OFF ROAD A Can you make it through the pool ? YOU LITTLE TRUCKER! So, the flag comes down and the race begins. Whaddyado? Just stamp your foot to the floor, pump that gas and try to fly! If you can beat the other three to the first bend (an early nitro will help!) you'll open up a clear and commanding lead and be clear of all the sad shamblers behind leaving just the coarse and its pitfalls to contend with! There's one problem with this strategy the boyos you've just left behind have probably got tons of nitros up their sleeves, ready to burn you up on the final lap! The original Off-Road Racer coin-op was never the most advanced machine in the world, so it's not surprising that the programmers of this Super NES version have turned in a game which is very close to the original. The Super Sprint-style action has had everyone in the office queuing for \"just one more go\" for the past fortnight, and who can blame them? The two player option is a winner you feel a great sense of satisfaction watching the opposition fall from first place to sad last (eh, Tim?) after being spooned off the course by one of the computer trucks or someone with loads of blind luck (eh, Paul?) Strategy is all-important: it's very well buying squillions of nitros at the start, but one of the computer opponents always has more than you and you're never going to beat him until you've souped up that vehicle. The big problems, which stop the game from scraping a HITI, is the fact that the computer truck is just TOO advanced to beat for a long, long time leading to annoyance and frustration. All in all though, this is one essential Watch out for the hay bales of doom! Water ditch laffs... The sad yellow truck lags behind yet again. TRUCK IT... Super Off Road features a total of 16 different stadium tracks laid out in a whopping great 64 configurations! That means there's plenty of truck track action for budding big racers, and every layout of the track's going to be different. Alright, so some of them are exactly the same track upside down but you probably won't notice when you cart. PAUL RAND 038 play! "


"BAR REVIEW REVIEW A Ooh, there's a bit of a scrap going on! Oh dear oh dear oh dear... BIEBUT This is a great conversion of the old Leland coin-op and like most Tradewest titles is a pretty fab game in its own right BUT! It's as near as dammit arcade perfect and plays like a dream, yet the game has one very big drawback in two-player mode. Start beating your pal a few times and you'll make so much cash for bolt-on truck goodies that he can't possibly catch up no matter how hard he tries, and the Continues he's offered are a waste of space because he starts with the bog-standard truck! The best remedy is to reset the machine at each Continue to keep playability tuned to the max, but it's an unnecessary pain in the butt which proper playtesting should have eliminated. Graphics and sound are both supercool and somebody has gone to an awful lot of trouble to get the arcade feel of the game just right, but the \"can't catch up\" sydrome is a real playability downer and it's the one reason we have to mark Super Off Road as another of those potentially brilliant Super NES games which lets down its own tyres on the very last lap.

"REVIEW NEO GEO BY SNK  KICK The game we know as Football won't last much longer in its present state. In the near future, the game's authorities decide that something needs to be done to claw back flagging attendances and stem the rising tide of hooliganism which has returned after a short slumber. The solution? Soccer Brawl, a frantic, dangerous sport played with a nuclear-powered ball and a lot of guts and bravery. Violence is kept to the field, leaving the fans to enjoy the carnage and the players to fight their way to the top of the pile. Only the very best live to play another season will you be one of them?

Loads and loads of samples, with shouts of \"Goal!\", \"Overhead and such. There aren't many different moves, mind you. Jump, header, overhead kick and shooting and that's about it. But put them all together and get out on the pitch and the whole package comes alive! One player is enjoyable enough, but grab a pal and that ridiculous price tag doesn't seem TOO bad (well okay, it does, but you knew the price when you got the machine).

"REVIEW This is what we want -football with a bit of punch! Soccer Brawl is THE office fave this month, and some people have to be dragged screaming from the machine! Imagine a simplified version of seven-a-side soccer where you're encouraged to beat opposing players senseless and you've got some idea what this is all about! It's the type of game the Neo really goes to town on, and whilst the graphics are so-so and sound pretty good, the game itself grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go until you've proved yourself against everybody else or damn near died trying! Some of the effects are truly great watch in awe as your captain fires a super-shot at the keeper and the force of the blast pushes him three feet back into the goalmouth before he lobs it out with a roar! Take on the computer and you get a good game, but this is the ultimate in twoplayer action which will bring out the best (and worst) in everyone. OK, so it costs a bomb but the Neo is the Rolls Royce of consoles after all and this is one of the best games on it. Fab. TIM BOONE It's a throw in so prepare to fight!

"YOB'S OOOOO CONSOLE CONFUSION CENTRAL Dear YOB. For a while now, I've been thinking about buying a console. Thing is, they're a bit expensive. How many people can honestly say they can afford to pay 120 quid for a Neo Geo game? Even the console alone is 250 quid. It amazes me when I think about the money these software companies make. They bring out a machine and then replace it, leaving all the old machine's owners stranded. They say they will still support the old machine, but the software soon tails off. Also, why do you let people write in and threaten you? I think you should organise a vigilante squad to go round their house and kick their teeth in. DYLAN GODING, Norwich VOA YOB: You've got a bit of a point here, but not much of one. It's true that software companies will abandon developments for a machine if it becomes unprofitable, but who can blame them for that? What usually happens is that most of the softcos release their back catalogue on budget, which is generally what's happening in the 8-BIT computer market right now, and fans of the machines have a fine old time picking up some skill software for ridiculously low prices while everyone else moves on to more powerful machines. It's called progress, in case you didn't know, and if you don't understand that I won't bother to explain why I'm so hard 'cos everyone else knows it already. PHPHPHPHPHRRRRRRRT!

I read the CVG reviews and I was very impressed (apart from the price). For 250 quid I could buy a ton of Megadrive games, rather than upgrade a console that doesn't need upgrad ing. Everyone reckons that the Megadrive has arcade quality graphics and sound, so is there any real point getting the Mega CD? PAUL DAVIS, Croydon, Surrey Dear YOB, While reading issue 122 I browsed through Darren Van Gemert's letter. He makes a few points and I tend to agree with them. When Super Mario Bros first came out, it was one of the greatest video games ever. The sheer gameplay and originality made it stand out from the crowd. However, now that we have reached Mario 4 there has been little improvement in gameplay. It still uses the same basic ideas of Mario 1. True, it has awesome graphics, sound and depth, but it hasn't come that far from the first game in terms of ideas. I feel that in a couple of years the current range of platform games will look stale and dated. Nintendo can't go on pulling punters with Mario and they may have to invent or promote a different character. Gasp! Horror! The death of Mario?

Mr DAMIEN RICHARDS, Wythenshawe, Manchester YOB: Sounds like you need a bit of cash to buy some software. Have you considered selling your kids as testers in the plastic potty factory? Not only would this make you about fifty quid, it would mean you could play all the Megadrive games yourself and stop writing bumlick letters to me... YOB: At this point in time the Mega CD is about as useful as you are. All its games are pretty low quality and it's a bit of a damp fart. However, once the machine is officially released in the UK there should be tons of skill titles available and it'll probably be the bargain of the decade, but for now you're better of saving your cash and moving to somewhere less ridiculous.

That's like asking if a Porsche is better than a poo. 4. No, but it's brilliant on the Megadrivel 5. Probably not, but get one anyway. I'M A SAD (S)CRAPPER GIMME THE GOODIES, GO ON! Dear YOB Dear YOB, I am writing to you for justice to be done! Me and my mate were Please could you send me a talking nicely in the Dinner Hall and it broke into an argument. hundred quid, some games We were arguing over which was the best console out of the and a T-Shirt? NES and the Megadrive. I told him the Megadrive and I kept RYAN MCMULLAN, laughing at his cruddy Nintendo. Guess what? He punched me in Victoria, Australia the mouth. I smacked him back and it turned into a mass bundle. YOB: Why do seagulls fly It was great! We keep arguing, so could you tell me which is upside down over Austrabest? By the way, your mag is brill! lia? Because it isn't worth GREGG, crapping on. Kidlington, Oxford. They're both great machines, unless they're owned by a couple of brainless baboons who couldn't punch their way I'M THE SAD (C)RAPPER out of a paper bag. Of course I know which machine is best, but I'm not going to tell you. Why should I break up a Dear YOB, I am the RAPPAI So here's a bit of a rap to let you know what a perfectly good fight? kickin', dissin', illin', chillin geezer I am: HELP, MY HEAD'S EMPTY! I am a Rappa lain. Dear YOB Dear YOB. I ain't no pappa In the Feb 92 issue of CVG you mentioned Gamesmaster, the Channel 4 series, I must confess that I thought this programme was a bit crap. Three games, three tips and three game reviews. It's not much, is it? The challenges are good though, with some classic gaming skills being shown, but the whole thing is a bit shaky. A crap studio and a prat of a presenter make it all a bit uncertain. THOMAS ROGERS, South Wales YOB: Funny you should say that, 'cos.. I ain't no snob I'm not the YOB Who's going bald on top He wears a wig He's as thin as a twig He craps in his Y-Fronts He smells like a tramp His car's in a clamp So gimme a hundred quid If you're not too thick Put your hand In your wallet You tight old git. THE RAPPA, Hatfield, Herts GAMESMASTER'S THE GREATEST! V M.C.ORIGINAL Dear YOB. Helloooo! My friends and I have been watching Channel 4's excellent new games series, the Gamesmaster. We thought it was really fabulous. Best of all though, was the inclusion of those wonderful CVG boys. We all watched, enthralled as the lads appeared in full stereo and glorious colour. Aren't they handsome? Tim is totally gorgeous he has that earthy, manly quality that us girls find irresistible. He's the classic English gentleman and makes us go weak at the knees. As for Frank, now he is male beauty personified. His chiseled features and his low, commanding voice promise such passion and intrigue. Please, please send us an autographed photo of these dreamboats (or even their phone numbers). We'd die for these god-like hunks, so please Mr Yob, don't let us down. NATASHA ANGELCAKES, Lovelies Model Agency, Paris YOB: Here's a little rhyme composed one day You're a dumb-ass geek with nothing to say I've seen this a hundred times in the past You've got no brains and you write through your ass Your underpants stink and so does your rhyme I'd insult you some more but I ain't got the time. YOB: Eat your heart out, Patrick Moore. "

"SAINT SWORD No name to go with this one, but let's take a look at the cheat anyway and thank the anonymous tipster for his time and effort. They're codes for some of the game's levels and here they come: LEVEL 3-1 2ND QUEST: IOFUSM LEVEL 4-2 2ND QUEST: 02VNW5 LEVEL 5-1 2ND QUEST: Q2XWG2 LEVEL 6-1 2ND QUEST: RWEFAQ LEVEL 6-2 2ND QUEST: VYWMU7 LEVEL 7-1 2ND QUEST: Y3XKWJ AMIGA ALIEN BREED Alien destruction has never been easier, thanks to Josh Beck of London SW6 who's found that on deck two's Intex system, typing BEWARE ALIENS SPADGE HAS DROPPED ONE clears all the baddies. A classic and no mistake! SPIDERMAN Marvel's web-slinging wonder may be the tops when it comes to arachnoid fun and japery, but it would be handy if he could get to the fork-lift boss a bit quicker. Select Nightmare difficulty then enter the first-level warehouse. Go to the right, past the first thug and then past the dog. Jump onto the first crate and crawl to the right you'll go through the crate and appear in front of the big man himself! STREETS OF RAGE A fine example of the beat 'em up genre, but how do you get loads of free points? No problem! After defeating the boss on level three, use your special weapon before he hits the ground and you'll receive a bonus of 5000 points! BABY JO Not at all a rip-off of the Mario Bros style of game, this. Give them a shot they should come in handy, considering they're from the programmers themselves! LEVEL ONE: It's possible to jump onto the logs once they have finished rolling. Jump on the log in order to get to the cut tree trunk where the rattle is found. The first tree drops bonuses on you, but the second also drops weights and fridges which cause damage. After the first duck, kill the two worms and climb up the tree. Bonuses, arms and recharges can be found in the clouds. Fire at the tree over the mountain for extra bo nuses. Walk on top of the black cloud to the right of the giant tree to find some nice surprises. PAUSI LEVEL TWO: Jump over the second bonus box it's got a nasty inside! Above the chimney guardrd by the dwarves is a box containing a first aid kit. Fire on the cross to unblock the passage. In the mine above are an extra life to the left and a secret room to the right. In the big room full of lava that follows the wagon passage is a secret room, hidden half way up the wall on the right. 053 "

"LEVEL THREE: Flying ants and birds occasionally drop nappies. The mountain that blocks your passage contains two secret rooms. Climbing up a number of clouds after the picnic will lead you to a shortcut cloud. A super-nappy is needed to get to the cloud; it is in a secret room hidden in a cloud marked by a cross.

"Z THE SIMPSONS Instead of jumping on the phone box, use a coin in it. Bart will ring up Moe, making him very angry. When he comes out of the bar, spray him. Muchos gracias, Omar Haq from Manchester.

Press B and A to make him jump very high into the air after killing a koopa. Waggle your racoon tail to make a slow descent and land on the next Koopa. A slow landing gives time for more nasties to come out of the pipe.

To kill the big boss at the end of level three, walk right up to him and jump over him to the other side and shoot at his head. He can't turn round to attack you and you'll defeat him with ease!

Go down to earn a boomerang, shots and level boost! SOCCER BRAWL The CVG boys have been banging away on this one ever since it roared into the office, so here are a few ti plets to be getting on with. 1. Always choose either Japan or korea because they're the best teams. 2. Loose off a super shot from a few yards outside the penalty box exactly halfway up and it'll often go in. 3. Wait until the goalie's chucking the ball out and stand beside him. When he lobs it out, just header it back in it's tricky but it works! 4.

"| REVIEW PC  BY INTERPLAY/ELECTRONIC ARTS pace. The Final Frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. It's five year mission to seek out strange now worlds and new civilisations. To boldly go where no man has gone before.. STAR TREK 25 ANNIVERSARY VG. The Ultimate Games Mag. These are the boys with all the hottest stuff. Our neverending mission: to seek out fab new titles for cool Reviews. To boldly go where sad mags cack their pants... I CANNAE HOLD HER, CAPTAIN! Star Trek. Probably the most famous TV series ever, it's a phenomenon that just won't go away! A quarter of a century ago your mum and dad thought it was the tops and your gran and grandad thought it was pretty brillas well. 25 years on and it's still just as good as ever. Fabulous plots, great special elfects and the interplay be tween the characters all added up to the greatest slice of sci-fi you were likely to see on TV. If you're one of those lonely and left out types who don't know the original show, James T Kirk and his pals sailed the galaxy looking for good deed to do on behalf of mankind. In their travels they'd run across all sorts of weird and interesting types and even a few Klingons the deadly enemies of the Federation! Nowadays most of you will probably know Star Trek: The Next Generation which is a damn fine show and no mistake. But it just doesn't compare with the original all-round brilliance of the original, which was a right old laff and has never been beaten! This is it THE game Trekkies the world over have been waiting for! We've seen some sad Star Trek games in the past, but Interplay knock spots off the lot and turn in a title which truly does justice to the show. Right from the incredible opening sequence, complete with classic music, through to the quick moral at the end of each mission, Star Trek is fantastic. There's a fantastic sense of being there because you control everything that goes on, and you just have to complete every task the Federation sets because, well, you're the Captain after all! Graphics and sound are both fab, with all the characters looking incredibly authentic Kirk even sits the same silly way in his chair! Sound is a treat from start to finish, although a few more in-game spot effects wouldn't have gone amiss. Playability is where Star Trek scores highest, though. The game literally draws you into it and refuses to let go until you've completed every mission set and become a hero acros the galaxy. Well, it wouldn't do to let the side down. All in all, Star Trek is one of the strongest PC titles ever and you'd have to be as boring as Spock to miss it. THAT WOULD BE LOGICAL, JIM The game features a simple and novel control method which you'll quickly master in your travels about the galaxy. It's point and click with a difference, because you're controlling individuals on the flight deck and then on the planet. Sometimes people and things don't do quite what you expect, and sometimes they don't do anything at all! Well, what do you expect you are Captain James T Kirk of the Starship Enterprise and they're all aliens after all! EF TIM BOONE ADMIRAL 060 IDYLL.

"RTREKCIA Well beam me up and call me Spock! It's Star Trek on the PC. For about ten years now, there have been rumours and promises of mega Star Trek games. This is the first one to deliver. It takes all the best parts of the TV series formula and turns it into a top notch game. There are eight missions to complete and each one is like an episode of the series, complete with corny aliens and terrible scripts. It's all a good laugh though and the combination of arcade battle sequences and puzzle/adventure elements is top class. The graphics are in super mega VGA-o-Vision and look dreamy. The sprites are excellent, right down to the high heeled boots for the male characters. The music is a spot on rendition of the TV themes, with a smattering of groovy sound effects for good measure. It's time to suspend disbelief and boldly go where no man has gone before (at least, not on the PC). It's one of the most involving and entertaining games of its type and it's a top treat for Star Trek fans every where. YOU SHOUL HERE, KIR FRANK O'CONNOR TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS. I'M A DOCTOR, NOT A MECHANIC... Broadly speaking, Star Trek falls into two parts arcade and adventure. In the arcade sections you're inside the Enterprise, flying about and scrapping with all and sundry in glorious 3D technicolour. Come to a planet and the adventure section begins, in which you control Kirk and crew on their planetary ponderings and all-round dogoodiness. With stackloads of puzzles to solve and places to explore through eight very deep missions, you're guaranteed to be playing well into the night! TO BOLDLIGERE NOL MANCHAS GONE BEFORE BEAM ME UP, SCOTTY Photo Torpedo r Bridge Wurp Drive One of the most striking features of Star Trek is that it's so much like the original TV show! Obviously programmed by huge fans of the series, each mission is really like taking part in a complete episode! At the start of the game you're treated to the theme tune as The Enterprise whizzes about, and at the end of each mission the crew banter among themselves like they did on the telly! If that's not enough, there's even a moral to pick up from every tale. Now that's style! Photon Torpedoes Impulse Ingines PC GRAPHICS SOUNDS PLAYABILITY LASTABILITY OVERALL 93 92 Wery Drives "

Sponsorship is an ideal way of raising much-needed moolah and usually there's a string of companies queuing up to have their logos splattered on bits of wood at the sides of the pitch. Remember though, that each deal is made on a contract basis and you can't just break a contract should you get a better offer elsewhere. BATERIE THE MANAGER will he be There at the end of the season?

Keen Kennys and budding Brians can now experience life on the touchline in this, the latest offering from US Gold. Programmed by German softco Software 2000, The Manager puts you in that tracksuit and plonks you in the dugout, with instructions to take your team to the very pinnacle of the League.

A decade later and the things are still going strong! That said, there seems to be surprisingly few available for the Amiga which is why The Manager is such a welcome newcomer on the scene. The beauty of such games is that, if they're done right, you can slip away for hours at a time and find yourself lost in a world of wheeling and dealing and the trials and tribulations that the likes of Souness and Graham go through every day. There's no arcade action, no fancy graphics (although the replay animations are quite cute), just honest, simple addictiveness which hits the player from the very start. It's quite easy to get out of the humdrum Third Division from where you begin, which is a good thing as you're eased in rather than thrown in at the deep end. But after that you can soon find yourself swamped by a mass of decisions which need to be made if you're to survive in the job. A super slice of strategy for footy freaks everywhere.

Broken nose> lan'o in bli Stevie 's ore than happy the position. MAN ON! MAN ON! The most important aspect of any football manager's job is team selection which of your line-up of lads to send out of a Saturday afternoon. Choose eleven players from your squad, along with up to four substitutes just in case your well-laid plans go up in smoke halfway through the game and you need to make drastic changes to save the match and your neck! Football management isn't normally my cup of tea at all, but I gave this a chance and guess what...I fell in love. It's so gorgeous and lovely and sweet. I just want to hug and squeeze and fondle this game for the rest of my life. The inclusion of all the top European clubs and players, as well as the brilliant control method make this a joy to behold. The graphics are slick and professional considering past efforts at this style of game. Sound wise, it's a dead loss. Not much in the way of funky music and even less in the way of smart sound effects. The odd crowd noise is about the limit. Fortunately, the playability saves the day. There are about fifty squillion options available and you can customise both teams and kit to suit your taste. If you're Graeme Souness and it all seems too easy, then you can turn up the difficulty level too! Guiding your initially spacky team through the trials and tribulations might not sound like a laff riot, but it's deeply engrossing and eventually enjoyable. To put it plainly, It's the first time I've come even close to enjoying a footie management game.

To keep your players at the peak of their abilities, they need regular training. The training options screen lets you alter each aspect of the programme separately, from general fitness to accuracy of shooting. And, if you want to give your team that extra bit of oomph, you could book them into a swish training camp but the prices aren't what you could call reasonable! GO ON REF, BOOK'IM! When it comes to match day, it's the boys on the pitch who matter, but you can influence the final outcome a little. If things aren't going your way, try a substitution or two. If the scoreline is still looking quite disastrous, a quick change of tactics can sometimes work wonders. And, if all else fails, tell the players to work that little bit harder by adjusting the Struggle bar. HOODS on great, according to the graph. Come on you Reds!

The marketplace is awash with fresh, young talent and seasoned veterans, and it's up to you to decide who will be best for your side.

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE BY SEGA  BOUNCING BOX BONANZA There are tons of boxes dotted around the landscape. All of these contain something useful, usually point-giving gems. Sometimes the boxes contain a helmet which will aid your Kid chameleon-like abilities. Often, a clock will fall from a box, Chameleon this gives the player those vital extra seconds to complete a his special level. Be careful about jumping on boxes when you're a knight though, 'cos he usually falls straight through them to his Samurai disguise. doom. There's a bit of trouble at the local arcade! The latest machine has been causing a bit of a stir. Every now and then, the coin-op sucks people in and whisks them of to a computerised prison. Fortunately for the local children, a hero is in their midst. Kid Chameleon! Defender of truth and justice and top quality shape shifter! Kid Chameleon knows no fear and decides to beat the machine at its own game. He heads down to the arcade and into the heart of the video nightmare in a last ditch attempt to save the lost kids. The plot is straight out of Tron and the gameplay is straight out of Mario. You control a small cute sprite with impressive jumping abilities. Kid Chameleon is so named because of his special magical power. By head-butting a special magical block, Kid can transform from an ordinary boy into a superhuman warrior. Just as well, because the Videoland countryside is swarming with filthy alien space crustaceans. Each transformation brings a different ability, you could be a Samurai. a Knight of old or a plain old sprog. You have to decide which form is best for which level and only you can save the kids! BEAM ME UP SCOTTY On certain levels, you'll find teleport pads. These disc shaped platforms give you the chance to enter bonus levels. Gain points and powerups and warp out again. Not exactly secret levels but very useful for totting up those extra points! Kid CHAMELEON CHAMELEONIC ESCAPADES Har, har! Those baddies are no match for the kid, especially with smart Chameleon-like powers. Chameleon Kid can turn into tons of different heroes. The samurai has a sword he can bash the baddies with, while the Knight can climb walls. The Hockey Mask enables you to fling axes and the Rhino mask allows you to demolish walls while charging. The best of all though, is the super space suit. This endows the wearer with a smart laser beam that almost fills the screen. You're almost at the end of the level dude! Sega's latest release has a very unusual graphical style. It doesn't really look like a console game at all, more like a 16 bit computer title. The gameplay however, is not very unusual at all. You'd think that a company with Sega's clout and reputation would be able to turn out something better than a cack-handed Mario clone. This is so obviously ripped off, that Sega should be shuffling their feet in embarrassment. The only way to copy a game successfully, is to improve the original. This game doesn't come anywhere near it. The inclusion of the Chameleon power is a nice touch, but it's all been done before. The area you have to explore is huge, but the incentive to actually wander about is minimal. There's no atmosphere and no tension. You can simply wander about without very much happening at all. The baddies are simplistic and often far too easy to beat. The music is a bit scabby as well, all doom and gloom and not very fitting for the cutesy graphics. If you really want another platform game and this is the only one you haven't got, then by all means get this, otherwise try Sonic or Robocod first. FRANK O'CONNOR NOTHING LIKE MARIO AT ALL Oh yes it is. It's probably complete coincidence and entirely accidental, but Kid Chameleon is more than a bit similar to Super Mario Bros. It's got all the main elements. Running, jumping, hidden bonus blocks, the lot. The only original thing about Kid Chameleon is the plot. Oops, sorry, that's a rip off of Tron.

"REVIP LESTER SUPER NES BY ACCLAIM ETBA WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION PAUSE They're rad, they're bad and they're totally mad! It's the World Wrestling Federation and some of the craziest wrestlers of all time! Everyone remembers the sad, shambolic wrestling that used to be on telly on Saturday afternoon. It was a bit pathetic, with fat middle aged men throwing each other around wear. ing daft costumes. WWF is a whole new ball game. It's loud and proud and it has to be the sport of the decade! Massive wrestlers from all over North America compete to win the prized WWF belt, the ultimate status symbol. This SNES version lets you control all of your favourite WWF characters, including Hulk Hogan, the Undertaker, Sid Justice, Ted DeBiase and lots, lots more. The game takes the form of a beat 'em up, with the emphasis on throwing rather than punching and kicking. You can use the ring to your advantage too, bouncing off the ropes or climbing the corner posts. If the action inside the ring gets too intense, you can even climb over the ropes and carry on fighting in the lap of the audience! The fighters all have similar moves and there are all kinds of play options, including simultaneous two player head to head for bonus laffs. Ere, where did you go? BARICO A FEAST OF WRESTLERS! All you WWF fans are probably wondering who the available wrestlers are. The list is as follows: Hulk Hogan, The Undertaker, The Natural Disasters, Legion of Doom, Million Dollar Man, Jake the Snake, Sid Justice, and Randy Savage. One slight niggle is that they all have the same moves but it does make them all equally matched. Whaddya want, blood? That's my sister you're talking about.... How can you go wrong with a license as big as this? Acclaim have done an amazing job of bringing the thrills 'n' spills of WWF Wrestling to the small screen. This fabulous conversion has all the best wrestlers and all the best moves. The play options are superb you can have a straight one on one fight with a mate, match up your two favourite wrestlers or even go tag team for a full blown tournament. You can also mix and match, so you could have the Natural Disasters fighting each other! Graphics are excellent, with groovy digitised pictures of the WWF heroes and superb animation throughout you can really recognise the wrestlers from the sprites. Sound-wise, this is a treat, there are tons of guitar twanging intro screens and the sampled grunts and snorts as the wrestlers fight are totally brill. The control method is groovy, the SNES control pads being perfect for this kind of game. Best of all though, is the two player mode: fighting a mate is a laff riot which will cause no end of arguments when you throw your pal out of the ring and jump on his head from the corner post! A Do you know the hokey kokey? VI can see your house from up here... A What did you say? TAG TEAM TACTICS One of the best features of WWF is the wealth of play options. Go one-on-one or choose to fight in a tournament. It's the most involved of the bunch and it's called the Survivor series. Tag Team is another option and this is just head to head fighting with your choice of two wrestlers in a tag team match. All of these options are available for one or two players Hurrah! FRANK O'CONNOR 068 "


"par VIEW WOW! This has to rank as the best two-player wrestling game anywhere! It really is the business when it comes to one-on-one laffs and somehow the programmers have managed to capture the spirit of the actual sport and all its thrills 'n spills as well! Graphics are the tops: each wrestler is so lifelike you might think you were watching the telly, and it's a real treat to discover and perfect the moves at your disposal. In one-player mode the game can be a tad disappointing, but play against a mate and this cart takes off with such a vengeance it practically goes into orbit! Whack your pal in the gob, stun him with a good hold, finish him off with a decent body slam and chuckle with glee as he rolls around on the floor. Just like WWF itself, the action takes place inside and outside the ring and just like the sport you can never be sure you've actually won until the ref counts the other geezer out! This is what WWF fans the world over have been waiting for, and you'd have to be stark, staring mad to pass it by! go? EARTHQUE PAUSE TIM BOONE 5 SAD CVG WRESTLERS Who says I'm easily TIM BOONE: I like the Britannoyed? ish Bulldog 'cos he always goes over the top when he wins, even if he's not in the bloody game! FRANK O'CONNOR: The Undertaker's my main man because he has a smart outfit, clean fingernails and always changes his underwear. JON BILLINGTON: I like The Million Dollar man 'cos he's rich and he's crap. I'd like to be rich and I'm crap as well. ...much PAUL RAND: My fave is Sid more than SLAM BAM THANK YOU MAM! Justice because he's got horthis, I did it rible bright yellow hair, just Each wrestler has the same selection of moves. You can My Way... like mine. punch, kick, flying kick and throw through different combinations of direction and fire buttons. If you manage to floor an opponent, you can pin them for a count of three (if their energy is depleted). You can also jump on them from the corner SAERSTARS posts and stamp on them when they have fallen. Best of all though, is the straight-arm clothesline very hard to do but OF WRESTLING ICE CREAM BARS very impressive!

"ARCADE ACTION The storyline to this new first-person 3D perspective showpiece coin-op as detalled in Namco's glossy press information pack reads exactly like this: \"One day the Federation of Planets communication net works catched the transmission from out side of the galactic system saying \"Warning to the Federation of Planets System Surrender im mediately and be under our control! Other wise your system will surely be destroyed!!\". The enemy task force mechanized planet \"RED EYE\" was approaching our mother planet and just about to get us within range of \"WAVE CANNON\", and attack weapon of \"RED EYE\". The Federal Government asked the UGSF their help to neutralize \"RED EYE\". In order to attain the purpose, UGSE plans the strategy called \"STARBLADE\".\" What this ba sically means when you translate it into Eng. lish is that an enemy force is attacking Earth and you've got to stop them with your space ship! Now why couldn't they just say that to start with? REMAINING SHIELD Shields decreasing when you're under attack FLIGHT DISTANCE LASER GUN SIGHT TARGET DISTANCE STABBLADE KINKY SEAT! If you fancy tickling your fancy with a vibro-massage, take a seat in Starblade's cockpit and let the enemy blast you to bits. Every hit sustained makes the seat jolt and vibrate like crazy. Wheee! Vauva 070 "


"GET YER GUN The object of Starblade is to simply blast anything that gets in your way using the laser gun mounted in front of the screen. The actual spaceship is flown automatically and makes its own way through the game you've got to shoot down anything hostile before if launches missiles or fires laser bursts at your craft. A TRIO OF MISSIONS There are three levels to test your skills. First is the assault on Red Eye, which takes you through fleets of enemy spacecraft. Then it's a battle against the massive battleship IceBerg. Finally things get really tough as you take on the enemy command ship! PUSH START TO ABORT ABBL-DE 071 "


"ARCADE ACTION saapurba When it comes down to the basics, Starblade is simply an Operation Wolf game with knobs on. But those knobs are certainly big and shiny and give this jaded format a whole new lease of life. The graphics are absolutely outstanding. Couple them with the incredible quadraphonic sampled sound and vibrating cockpit and you really feel like you're participating in some kind of a blockbuster scifi movie! It's a truly exhilarating experience! My only gripe is that the game is exactly the same every time you play it, which reduces the lasting appeal somewhat and makes the game easy to complete if you're good at remembering where things are. If you'd been able to actually control where you go like Star Wars rather than just follow the same course each time you play and there'd been more random element in the gameplay, Starblade could well have been the greatest game ever written. As it stands it's a very enjoyable game that gets dull much quicker than you want it to. Perhaps Starblade II will provide the goods? JULIAN RIGNALL 0000000 white 39 D HEAD-UP DISPLAY The ship's head-up display shows some vital information. On the left is a circular shield indicator which shows the current shield strength. It's depleted every time a hit is sustained, and when it's completely diminished the next direct hit results in the ship being destroyed. On the right are two items of flight information. The upper readout shows the distance travelled while the lower one indicates how much further you have to go before you reach that particular mission's objective.

Dynamix new flight sim is set in the Pacific in the sec. ond world war as the battle for the skies rages between Japan and the USA. You can take either side as you soar over sea and land. There are tons of missions including bombing runs, air-sea combat and good old dogfighting. The game is a historical sequel to the spectacular Red Baron, but with improved graphics and much more detail. There are absolutely tons of missions and the area you have to cover is absolutely huge! The game supports all kinds of joystick and controller doobries and the usual stuff like outside views. Best of all is the speed and playability. Although the game is extremely accurate, the very nature of these crusty old fighters makes them a joy to fly. It's a barrel roll of laughs and looks set to be one of the best flight sims this year!

"Adidas Tamilu. V EW START GAME PASSORD THE MUSIC ROOT DAMS RESIDENCE urch, Gomez, Uncle Fester, Morticia, Wednesday, Pugsley, Granny and last but not least, Thingl. These are the main members of the Addams Family and they're all about to turn up in various 16 bit guises. The best and most important of which is the Super NES version. The game is being programmed in house by Ocean themselves and the results so far are quite startling. The version we saw was almost entirely complete and it looked excellent. You control Gomez as he wanders around the grounds of the Addams mansion. All the memebers of the Family have gone missing and Gomez quite understandably wants to get them back. Lurch is the only one left and he's too depressed to help, he just sits at his harpsichord and plays dreary tunes. It's a platform game of immense proportions and it borrows all the best ideas from Mario and Sonic. The reult is a fast, playable and stunning looking scroller with groovy music and smart FX. This game has more secret rooms than the Addams mansion and apparently covers more than a thousand screens of action. The Super NES version features tons of sprites (and doesn't slow down) while the Amiga version should be identical except for the parallax backgrounds. With a password system for continues and some of the smartest SNES graphics yet, this should be a real treat. Full review as soon as we get it!

Sensible Soccer (from Sensible Software) looks set to change all that. The boys at Sensible have been playing all the great soccer sims of our time and trying to work out the pros and cons of each. What they've arrived at, is the game with (they reckon) the best control method for any footie game ever. I've been up to visit the Sensible boys just to have a go and so far it's fab! The game has all the usual options and features, such as after touch, skill levels and most importantly, two player mode. The ball movement is perfect and uses a rather smart trapping technique. Graphically, it doesn't look much, but the animation is fluid and everything is bright and colourful. The game has a little way to go before it's finished, but this could be the game to challenge the Kick Off 2 crown. More news as we get it! VERSION DATE PRICE AMIGA TBA TBA 084 "

"PRE o ne of this year's biggest movies, Hook. This Spielberg spectacular didn't exactly take the American box office by storm, but it made a couple of quid nonetheless. Ocean's licensed game of the film is an icon driven adventure, not a million miles away from the style of Monkey Island. You play the part of Peter Pan as you search for your kidnapped children. Use the objects and people you find along the way to help you in your quest. As you can see, the graphics are gorgeous. The animation is looking slick but obvious comparisons will be made with Monkey Island. There are tons of problems and riddles to solve and hundreds of baddies to conquer. The final challenge will be a showdown with your arch enemy...Captain Hook! VERSION DATE PRICE AMIGA TBA .99 TITUS the FOX BE Titus are famous for bringing out dead weird games, but this is an exception to that rule. Titus the Fox is a scrolling platform game, involving secret rooms, cute sprites and pixel per fect jumping. Nothing even remotely odd about that. You play the part of Titus the Fox, a sort of animated version of the Titus logo. This particular fox is on a quest to find his girlfriend. Apparently, she's been kidnapped by some Sheik and is being held against her will in a harem. It's up to you to rescue her from the fiendish clutches of the baddies in a quest that will take you from Paris to Marakesh and with any luck, back to Paris again. The platform action is strangely similar to their last release, Blues Bros. but with the speed and control method tweaked and definitely improved. There are two game speeds to choose from, one typically French and far too fast to see what's going on, the other reasonable and indeed very playable. There are absolutely oodles of levels and they get bigger and harder (ooh, er) as you progress. You can pick up various objects (including some of the baddies) and use them as weapons and there are hidden rooms and secret levels galore. Check it out soon at a software parlour near you.

"PRE lap) he creators of some of the Amiga's most recent hits, in cluding heli-sim Thunderhawk and 3D role-gamer Heimdall, are shifting up a gear in production of what they hope to be as big a smash as their previous efforts. That shouldn't be a problem if the license is anything to go by the boys at Core have grabbed the rights to the Jaguar car name! Well, what do you expect the galaxy's greatest games mag to do about that? Simple, we strap on our seat belts and go take a look so here's PAUL RAND to tell you all about it!
