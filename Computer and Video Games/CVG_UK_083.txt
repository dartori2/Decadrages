"Triad Trio Industry giants Telecomsoft, Mirrorsoft a Psygnosis have signed a deal to co-operate in the development of the 16-bit market. Though they will still be competing for customers, they will be working together on joint-ventures to, erm, well, details are a bit vague at the moment, but you can be sure they'll be doing something. Why name it after the chinese mafia though? Very strange. Level 9 release the follow-up to Gnome Ranger in mid-October, hot on the heels of their illustrated adventure game Lancelot, based on the legand of King Arthur. Lancelot follows Time and Magik by being released with Mandarin, and promises to be a vast project closely following the definitive version of the tale as told by Sir Thomas Malory. Released at the start of September at .95 8-bit, .95 for 16-bit versions, it is said to be \"the best game to date from the specialist adventure house. Gnome I: Ingrid's Back, on the other hand, is slightly more based in the modern world, with horrible heroine Ingrid Bottomlow returning home, only to find unscrupulous yuppie property developers planning to steamroll the place.

THE BATTLE BLEMER Name of Company: Telecomsoft. Labels: Firebird, Rainbird, Silverbird. When Started: Firebird started 1984. Rainbird the first British 16-bit label set up a year or so later. Telecomsoft is an autonomous company, owned by British Telecom. Personnel: Paula Byrne Big Chief. Paul Hibbard Production and development publisher. Dobble Sillitoo Marketing manager. Contact: Customer services 01-379 5683. First game: Firebird's first releases were two ranges of budget, including Buggy Blast (by Paul Hibbard) and Demons of Topaz on Firebird Gold, and Booty and Headache of Firebird Silver. First Hit: Gyron, a maze strategy game with a huge ball In it, out in '85. Biggest ever hit: Probably Elite In 1985/6 \"t sold a squillion\", but Starglider may just have pipped it to the post. 10TIOUTOWN Forget the good movies, It's trash the kids want, and they don't come much trashier than the marvelously named Hell Comes to Frogtown, or the sword and sandal \"spectacular\" The Barbarians. Both feature old American pro-wrestling stars in the title roles, so you can guess how good the acting is. \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper plays post-apocalyptic hero Sam Hell, a man who has to cope with both giant frog-like mutants and mad Nurse Spangle who locks him in a steel chastity belt, and uses him to impregnate the last surviving fertile human woman. Life doesn't sound too bad when you're the only potent male left in America! Meanwhile, the Barbarian Brothers tag-team play hardboiled orphan twins in whose hands rests, surprise, surprise, the fate of the universe. With both out on video now, bad movies have never had it so good! Ones to watch out for: Starglider 2, Corruption, Vermintor, Whirligig, and others. Crities Choice:By general consent in the office, their best games have been Bubble Bobble, Ellte, Starglider 2, and Carrier Command. Julian Rignallis torn between Twinkle goes hiking \"by some Hungarian bloke\" and The Comet Game, produced to cash in on the recent return of Haley's Comet and featuring, amongst other delights\" a sub game where you had to stop the spaceship coffee supply getting mixed up with the, erm, contents of the toilet bowl.\" Eugene thinks the stick-man kung fu games Ninja was bad enough to overshadow all these however "

The bottom of the screen is split into two halves, representing each character's playing area. A ball of antimatter is shot into the playing area, and the characters attempt to catch it and shoot it at the blocks, which earns points. This sounds pretty straightforward but there are two catches. Firstly, the players are only allowed to catch the ball using their 'gravitation guns' long sticks. If the ball touches any other part of the character's body, he dissolves and points are given to the opposing player. Secondly, each character exerts a strange gravity force, which causes the ball to follow parabolic curves, making it very difficult to actually catch the ball.

"ys ATARI BLASTI The Software division of Atari Corporation has been very quiet over the last few years, with very little in the way of new releases for either their 8 or 16-bit machines. However, this month sees a break in that silence, with no less than ten new titles for ST. Some may sound familiar; The $14.99 The sequel to Asteroids (not others not-so-familiar.

It's a very straightforward combat game in which the player guides a tank across an enemy battlefield. Other tanks appear one at a time, its whereabouts shown on the radar at the top of the screen, and proceeds to track down the player; it's kill or be killed. As the game progresses, fast super tanks appear, along with homing missiles which zig-zag across the playing area in an attempt to crash into the tank. Although Battlezone is a very faithful conversion of the original, its plodding, rather repetitive gameplay looks primitive by today's standards. I can't see it A Battlezone coin-op classic for the ST. Asteroids Deluxe, was 658 never a big arcade hit. 650 Nevertheless, Atari has decided to give it a new lease of life, eight years since it first appeared.
