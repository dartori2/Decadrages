"Babus Just to add our four penn'orth to all this hands-across-the-water Channel-Tunnel-it'll soon-be-1992 talk, here's news of an Anglo-French software pact between the Brits al Palace Software and Gallic Games, Delphine. Under the agreement Palace, are going to be distributing Delphine's games outside France. The first of these is Bio Challenge, a six level, 16-bit arcade effort with extra weapons, end-of-level falsos and heaps of robots and monsters to knock about. The programmer is the man behind ST and Amiga Space Harrier, and he has included loads of spiffy programmer's tricks, such as super smooth parallax scrolling (even on the ST!) and more colours on the screen than you previously thought possible. Who could possibly ask for more? Not us, that's for sure. 300!! The 123 Pack is Silverbird's new budget compilation of three past cheapos which is retailing for only $2.99. The featured titles are BMX Kidz, Rock 'N' Wrestle and Ninja Master, none of which could set the world on fire individually, but represent reasonable value in this bundled form. Impoverished C64, Spectrum and Amstrad owners should certainly be getting their money's worth, we reckon. But then we're funny like that, aren't we doctor? ting by Numy AJUNTVL Wool Tout Now you know we're not proud folk at C&VG, but once in a while even we feel the urge to blow our own trumpets a bit. And so it is that we presenta photie of Messrs Rignall and Glancey in celebratory mode after beating Domark's crack Vindicators team to win the highly-prized Tengen Trophy. The contest was a close fought one, but our boys managed to pip Domark's Mark Strachan and Andy Blazdell, winning two out of three dual-player games on the tank-totalling coin-op. Certainly no quitters, the Domark lads are already drawing up their strategy for the rematch, which will be played soon on the next coin-op they're converting, APB. The only problem lies in finding an ABP machine, since butterfingered delivery men dropped Domark's own machine from the back of their wagon, smashing it to veritable smithereens, as our pic shows! Zo. You want to be a painteur, eh. Eet will not be easy. You will need an Amigeur, an 'ole one Megabyte of RAM, and ze very latest Deluxe Paint Ill softwarez from Electronic Arts. 'ot on the heels of Deluxe Paint I and II, Electronic Arts makes a quantum leap by endowing the third version of its powerful digital paint palette with full animation features. So now you can attempt to be Degas and Disney all rolled into one. For those not familiar with Deluxe Paint, it's about the most sophisticated paint package this side of a Quantel Paintbox--if you know what one of those is. You get a whole bundle of tools which allow you to ... well, paint... anything you like, and Deluxe Paint ill makes it seem easy, Paint with any shaped brush you like in any colour you like, loads of wild fill patterns and likewize crazy effects.

"1 SCORE:0012000 Gaming sibery Get Fresh mucus king, Gilbert the will be releasing it in April on alien, has at last been signed up Spectrum, C64, Amstrad, ST and for computer stardom. New boys, Amiga. Enigma Variations are doing the Gilbert-Escape from Drill, as programming and Again Again the game is called, takes the form of an arcade adventure in S01 which the jocular snot bag has to scour the environs of an alien provided when you complete city for five vital parts of the four simple sub-games.

Your only the definitive opinion, read the clues to the items' locations are review next issue. No, no, no, no, It's INSECTS in Space! Which, in case you're interested (and you'd better be, matay), is the latest hot-blooded blaster from Sensible Software. The lads who produced such 64 classics as Wizball, Parallax and Microprose Crazy Horse Compo Audiogenic, purveyor of that fine footy game, Emlyn Hughes International Soccer, was so unutterably happy when it received a C&VG Hit award that it felt a competition coming on. The top prize on offer is an expenses-paid trip to the FA Cup Final at Wembley, in the company of two other winners from CU and Sinclair User. The three lucky hombres will then have the chance to win an Amiga by predicting the score at the end of the match. 'Sorright, Innit? If you've lost your lucky horseshoes, don't despair, for there are also loads of runner-up prizes. Five second-prize winners will receive a signed copy of Emlyn Hughes' tome of whacky sporting anecdotes called \"My Great Britons\". The next ten names drawn out of the Ed's hat will nab an FA Cup programme signed by Crazy Horse himself, and a further 50 entrants get a nice big EHIS poster. So howdya like them apples? All you have to do to put yourself among the lucky 66 is tell us which home computer manufacturer sponsors Chelsea FC. Reckon you know? Put the anwer on the back of a postcard or sealed-down envelope and whizz it of to CRAZY HORSE UUWAAAGHI, C&VG, PRIORY COURT, 3032 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON, ECIR BAU. Make It quick, so that we can contact the winners well before the big match on May 20th. bers Soccer have had their latest game signed up for the Rack-It label, so not only should it be great, it's going to be cheap (.99 actually). As you would expect from a company which brands itself sensible\", the game design is completely loopy, but to quote co-programmer, Jovial Jops Hare,\"it's like Stargate, but with extra weapons. Also featured are angels who save downwardly-mobile \"babies of fun\" and all manner of creepy-crawlies to unleash your destructive powers upon. The C64 version is out in May, with 16-bit conversions due in July and, quite frankly, some of us at C&VG just can't wait "

KARUMMPHAAAAA! With the successful 8-bit conversions of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back under their belts, Vektor Grafix is out to strengthen its name in 3D games with an airborne combat simulator, provisionally titled Bomber. Unlike, say, Falcon, the emphasis in Bomber, is very heavily on using up lots and lots of missiles and bombs to make lots and lots of holes in enemy aircraft and ground targets, and the flight simulation aspect takes a bit of a back seat. Of course, everything's displayed in fast, filled vector graphics which we were able to sample in an aircraft display demo. Suffice it to say that it was well impressive and we're looking forward to seeing the finished product, which will be released soon on all major formats under the auspices of Activision.

Between our reviewing April's Game of the Month, Populous and Electronic Arts releasing it, one major improvement has been made.

Roadbound crime-busters will be excited to hear that Ocean also have the license to convert Taito's fab cop car chase simulator, Chase HQ. In fact programming is already well underway on that title, and we should have some screenshots to show you pretty soon. The ink is still wet on the final contract, which concerns horror merchant, Clive Barker's next film, Nightbreed. The film is based on Barker's novel, Cabal, and will feature more members of the undead than you can shake a crucifix at. Expect the game and the film around the end of the year.

The SPEC .99 CASS, player controls a runner as he C64/AMS .99 CASS, sprints up the vertically ST .99, AMIGA scrolling screen, leaping over .99 ITV's Run the Gauntlet is a brilliant TV programme it pits four teams from the USA, Great Britain, Holland and Australia against one another over a variety of gruelling events which feature motocross scramblers, quads, speedboats, jet skis, hovercraft, Argo ATVs and off-road buggies amongst others. With action like that, it's ideal subject matter for a computer game--and Ocean have capitalised with an official licence to produce a Run the Gauntlet program. The end result is a three-stage action sports simulation played over land and water. At the start of a game the player(s) choose a team. After that the first event begins on water. A random water vehicle is chosen speedboat, jet ski or hovercraft; each has its own handling and speed capabilities. The action is viewed from overhead, and the course scrolls as the craft move around. A map at the top right of the screen tells you where to go, and also gives a A All the fun of the TV programme. radar indication of where the opponents are. The objective is to complete three laps in the minimum possible time. The player partakes in three rounds of three races. The time for each of the three races is added together to produce a result for one round, and points are awarded depending on whether you come first, second or third. After three rounds, all points are displayed, and depending on whether you've done well enough, you go onto the next round-a land-based event which features the likes of buggies, eight-wheeled ATV's and bikes.

"Lorolonoworocoso UNLET obstacles, running over log bridges and through water. Run the Gauntlet is a simple, but enjoyable and addictive game which has a very competitive element in two or three-player mode. The random selection of courses and craft is another bonus, making the game unpredictable and increasing its lasting appeal. The different style of controls is a great idea, and coming from the rather sluggish and slow hovercraft to a speedy and manoeuvrable jet ski takes some getting used to mastering each craft is tricky, but perseverence reaps rewards. The graphics on both 8 and 16-bit versions are polished and highly detailed, Both the ST and Amiga versions are colourful, with excellent sprites and backdrops. Sound is also very good, with a variety of neat effects and ditties on 8-bit, and effective use of samples on the ST and Amiga to enhance the atmosphere of the game. Ocean have certainly done a great job bringing Run the Gauntlet to our screens, and any sports sim fan after an action-packed game should definitely look this up.

"Suuuuu vie RUNNING MANI GRANDSLAM SPEC .95 CASS, .95 DISK C64/AMS .95 CASS, .95 DISK, ST/AMIGA/ IMB .95 Running Man's introductory screens are some of the best I've seen on a computer. Digitised sequences from the film, sampled sounds and some stunning visual effects are used to give a superb movie-like opening sequence. However, from then on things go downhill alarmingly swiftly. Before I continue, I'd better tell you a bit about the film on which the game is based. It's set in the future and stars Arnie Schwarzenegger as a policeman who's framed for murdering innocent civilians. His punishment is to appear on a prime time telly program called, obviously enough, The Running Man. On this ultra-violent games show, contestants (or should that be victims) fight the show's five champions massive, meaty mateys who wield a variety of whacky weapons, including a razor-sharp ice hockey stick and two large chain stores. Of course, Arnie wins in the film. But this is a game, and with you at the controls anything can happen. The start sequence shows Arnie being blasted down to the game arena, and then the action begins. Running Man is basically a scrolling beat 'em up, and the objective is to beat the five champions to win the game. First of all, musclebound Arnold runs along the landscape jumping over obstacles and kicking any dogs that get in his way. If a dog manages to bite the hero, a chunk is knocked off his energy barif the bar is entirely depleted the game ends. Eventually the first opponent appears Sub Zero, who wields a hockey stick. The object here is to simply wear down his energy bar (which appears beneath Arnie's) by repeatedly kicking him to the ground-meanwhile Sub Zero's trying to do the same to you. If Arnie manages to beat Sub (which isn't too difficult), he runs to the end of the screen to finish the level. Between levels, up with very limited moves. The graphics are fairly good, but the parallax scrolling is juddery, and the actual playing screen is small. A major niggle is the skill setting the first two opponents are relatively easy, and then the difficulty is hoisted right up and the third one is very difficult to beat, resulting in frustration and annoyance. Considering the potential of the film licence, it's a shame Grand Slam hasn't made more of this. As it stands, it's a barely average beat'em up with a brilliant front end which just isn't enough to warrant the hefty  price tag. JULIAN RIGNALL $88858 72% a neat little sub-game is played to replenish lost energy. The idea is simply to match a pair of randomly generated circles of symbols. Succeed and lost energy is replaced failure results with no such addition. The game continues with another three opponents of increasing difficulty, before Arnie confronts the studio guards and the final baddie, Killion. If he manages to beat him, he leaps into a handy waiting shuttle and escapes! Like the film, I found Running Man a big disappointment especially after the marvellous opening sequence.

Holding down the left button activates the thrusters which shoot the sled across the ocean at a fair lick. The sled is equipped with a laser cannon which releases hot blobs of photons whenever the right button is pressed.

Fun, but due to the small number of options, a little short lived. Amstrad and C64 versions should be available as you read this, and funnily enough, so should The hype states, though not in so many words, you can be a rock star. This isn't strictly true. In Rock Star you, in fact, are the manager of a rock star. It's your job to take them from the bottom rung to a leading charting, groovy rock band like Def Leppard or Cinderella. The first thing you have to do when forming a band is to find the various members who will make up the band. You and your sidekick, Drop Dead Clive, are pictured sitting in front of a TV set, which flashes up pictures of famous personalities like Ted 'Newsagent' Nugent and Michael 'Wacky Jacko. It also tells you exactly how much it costs a week to keep them going. When you've chosen the right number of artistes (from a solo effort to a four piece, the choice is yours), you then choose a name that for you, sums up rock and roll in a short phrase, that brings out the entire essence of the band as well as being catchy and different. Like Def Leppard or Cinderella. To start with, you have three basic options. You can stick the group into a studio and force them to rehearse (from one to five days). You can shove them on the road for up to a week, doing anything from pubs to stadiums (budget allowing: of course, stadiums are expensive to book for one night, and you start with only ,000) with variable ticket prices. Or, you can go for a bit of publicity. Publicity can be either good or bad, but as Clive has a habit of pointing out, any publicity is good publicity. Unless, of course, a stunt goes disastrously wrong, and you're left with headlines like 'Rock Star Dies In Nuclear Holocaust'. Lose all your band members this way and it's game over. The same applies when you run out of money. The bank balance drops when you pay wages, buy equipment or book venues or rehearsal studios. It goes back up when you runa successful tour, or when your records are selling well. START WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW the Spectrum version.

Raising it all above the mundane is Tom Hanks as a medical student who, flunking his exams because he believes that laughter is really the best medicine. Meanwhile, housewife and mother Sally Field wants to break away from the drudgery of preparing dinner for her husband by becoming a star. They both perform at The Gas Station club.

Suddenly, the good fairy Genesta appears in the king's magic mirror, and bids Rosella to come to Tamir, where there is a charmed fruit that could save her father's life. Of course, it's not quite as simple as that, for in return, Genesta asks that Rosella retrieve her magic talisman from the evil Lolotte. Without it, her magic powers are rapidly fading, and she fears for her own life in the very near future. Thus Rosella sets out on these two quests from a deserted beach in Tamir, disguised as a peasant girl, and with just twenty four hours to achieve her two goals. First she must explore the land, which she finds to her delight is populated with Pan, seven dwarfs, Cupid, and a unicorn, as well as numerous birds. It is a truly beautiful world, with a sparkling stream running from the bottom of a waterfall, through meadows and forests, into the seas. But there is evil afoot, from the merciless Lolotte, resident of the mountain-top castle, and h.top castle, and from a troll, always on the lookout for a nourishing meal of human being. There is also a particularly nasty breed of trees in the forest ... Rosella's adventures take her into the house of the seven dwarves (even untidier than KC's! True! --Ed), inside a diamond mine, and into a trangely derelict and deserted house, in the middle of a the fisherman's wife so surly, approaches! And read the smoke rises from chimneys, when all Rosella wants is to be finest collection of tombstone and Rosella sways her hips as friendly? epitaphs you're likely to come she walks through it all.

Recently released is Amiga Space Quest 2, already around for some time on the other formats. Loosely a follow-on from SQ1, you have now been promoted to chief janitor aboard the space station Xenon 4 (shades of Planetfall!) After a somewhat cinematic opening. The game itself starts off with you sweeping the station decks clearing the space dust, I suppose? Soon, your wrist TV communicator starts to beep, and you are ordered to report for special duty. As you move towards the airlock door, Sierra's animation shows off a little, by allowing your character to walk on walls and ceilings (being in a zero gravity environment) cleverly changing the perspective view of him as he moves from plane to plane through right angles. Assigned the sickly task of cleaning up a space shuttle after a particularly rough trip, you make your way there, only to get mugged. You regain consciousness in the presence of the evil Sludge Vorhaul. Peeved at you thwarting his plans in SQ1 (you did, I take it?) he announces you are condemned to hard labour in the mines for the rest of your life, whilst he, Sludge, will conquer the earth by infesting it with thousands of genetically engineered door-to-door salesmen.

"The console scene is going ape at the moment. The PC Engine CD-ROM player was revealed last month and looks stunning. Now we've got the 16-bit Sega, the newest and hoftest addition to the console market. Julian Rignall puts it through its paces and finds himself more than impressed. MACI 16-BIT SE Sega are dominating the console market in Britain at the moment with the Master System, and their new 16-bit machine looks like it'll consolidate (no pun intended) its position when the unit is released later on this year. The machine appeared in Japan at the end of last year, and sold out instantly. Some may find this surprising when you consider that at the moment there are only three titles currently available Altered Beast, Thunderblade and Space Harrier II -but the new machine also accepts all old Sega Master systems titles (although you do need to buy a special adaptor). This is certainly an intelligent way of boosting the new Sega's library -especially as many of the 8-bit games are very good! Oh yes, while I'm on the subject of add-ons, Sega will be releasing a CD-ROM unit in Japan later on this year which should definitely be worth looking out for, especially when you consider what's already been done with the PC Engine CD-ROM!

"At the start of a game up to five players input their names, and a preview of the track is shown, so you can get some ideas of the hazards to come. Then the players take turns to buy extra equipment from a $5000 budget. There are plenty of extra things to buy-brakes, engines, and special weapons to blow the opposition off the rack. As the cars zoom down the multi directionally scrolling track, it's inevitable that the incompetent drivers get left MACHINES MOTOR ROADER PC ENGINE PES .05. 5-PLAYER ADAPTOR .00 This must be a firsta fiveplayer racing game! Yes indeedee, grab a PC Engine fiveplayer adaptor, slap in your joypads and you can take on another four drivers at the same time with hilarious results. It doesn't look stunning, with an overhead view of five blocky cars and a simple race track. But as seems to be the case with all PC Engine games, it plays very well and that's what's most important. behind If this happens and they touch the end of the screen, the car is warped forward to the middle of the screen. If this happens to you, your warp total decreases by one (usually you have 40 of these 'lives'), and when you've used up all the warps, the game ends. Points and cash are awarded at the finish of the race the better your finishing position, the more spondoolicks you get. And, of course, if you continue to do well, you can kit your car out with better equipment. In one-player mode, the game is still very enjoyable and addictive, with four competent computer opponents. Of course, multi-player is where the game really comes into its own — and you soon find out who your friends really are!! Speed fiends are recommended to take Moto Roader for a test drive.
