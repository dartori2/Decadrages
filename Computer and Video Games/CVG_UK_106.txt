"AM'N'CH Amstrad recently took a group of journalists to Paris to announce the launch of three new machines the GX4000 console (which takes ROM cards only and has 64k memory), the CPC 464 Plus (which features a built-in cassette deck and has 64k memory) and the CPC 6128 Plus (which has a 3-inch disk drive and 128k of memory). Julian Rignall was there... LOOKS GOOD SCORE The three new machines all feature the same internal architecture, which is GEAR based around the old Amstrad computer boards. But they've been brought up to date with the addition of a 2k custom chip which gives super-smooth hardware scrolling capabilities, hardware sprites (up to 16) and, most importantly, lets you display 32 colours on-screen at the same time from a palette of 4096 which is the same as an Amiga. SOUNDS GHASTLY Annoyingly, the sound is the same as the old Amstrad and Spectrum computers, but is now produced in stereo via a new sound driver chip. It's a crying shame that a better sound chip wasn't introduced, as this would have given the machines a real audio boost. As it stands, the sound chip is very limited, and the sort of noises it produces are tinny, harsh and grating. www "


"HIPS FREE GAME All machines come with a free ROM cartridge called Burnin' Rubber, a colourful WEC Le Mans style game that was developed by Ocean especially for the new Amstrads. The 464 Plus also has BASIC on the ROM cartridge, and the 6128 Plus also comes with CPM Burnin' Rubber is a Wec Le Mans type ROM cartridge that comes free with all machines. TLAPD.06. 5 SPEED SPEED 303 PLAY THE OLDIES A big bonus is that the 464 Plus and the 6128 Plus all run existing Amstrad software, giving them an immediate huge software library. New software is currently being developed by top software houses to make use of the ma. chines' new hardware, some of the more notable titles being Robocop II, Shadow Warriors, Operation Thunderbolt, Plotting. Special Criminal Investigation, Pang, Navy Seals. Toki and Battle Command. As well as Ocean, US Gold, Domark, Loriciels, and Titus are amongst many firms developing software for the new machines. All games will be released on ROM cartridge for the GX4000 console, as well as tape and disk formats. monitor, and the 6128 Plus is .00 with mono monitor and is a hefty .00 with colour monitor. Black and white monitors are fine if you want to use the machine for doing things other than playing games, but really you do need to buy a colour monitor for en joyable gaming and that puts them up with the cost of an ST or Amiga (admittedly without monitor, but the 16 bit machines do have TV modulators . is the monitor really that important?) The fact that they're able to run existing Amstrad software and take ROM cartridges as well as running their own software is good, and though the machines are pricey, they're easily the best 8 bit computers around, ca. pable in some cases of matching and even beating the specifications of the ST which can't be bad at all! The GX4000 is a different story. price-wise. It's a neat-looking and technically impressive console that has an awful lot of potential at the very low price of .00. The main criticism is that the joypads are pretty naff (finger cramp sets in very quickly), but at least the joystick sockets are standard, so you can plug in your favourite stick for long-term, ache-free gaming! Other than that, the GX4000 is a graphically superb console, is technically far better than the Nintendo and Sega Master System and has a very exciting line-up of games coming in the not-too-distant future. It's definitely well worth checking out if you're after a decent console for Christmas THE VERDICT The two new computers are exciting machines, with tremendous graphics capabilities but they are pricey. The 464 Plus is .00 with black and white monitor and .00 with colour 77777777777 AMSTRA A The GX4000 console is a neat looking machine shame about the control pads, though! "

Mirrorsoft's Managing Director, Peter Bilotta, was extremely enthusias. tic about the license, and stated that without doubt, this is set to be the license of 1990, and we intend to make it the most successful computer program in Europe this year.\" Strong words, perhaps, but considering the sheer magnitude of the Turtles, they could have a ring of truth to them. TMHT will be released on the Imageworks label for the Amiga, ST, C64, Amstrad, Spectrum and PC, but definite dates and prices have yet to be fixed. We'll let you know as soon as we do.

"ELITE GET THE GREMLINS Elite, having been quiet for some considerable time, are now leaping back into the spotlight by grabbing the license for Gremlins ll The New Batch. The film is again centered around Billy, Kate and that annoyingly cute Mogwai, as Clamp Plaza is overrun by rapidly reproducing Gremlins! The game is being written by Toposoft, the people responsible for US Gold's Pepsi Mad Mix Game. There's a heck of a lot of scope there, so let's hope that Elite's re-entry into the market is one to be cheered. Keep your eyes on the previews section over the coming months for further news.

The reason for all this fandango is to promote the fact that Imageworks are soon to begin work on the Back to the Future Ill computer game, which is due for release in spring. We'll bring you a report on the game as soon as it's ready At long last, Sega have announced the launch of the official UK Megadrive September is when it'll first appear in high street shops. It'll cost .99 and comes with a copy of Altered Beast. A range of 22 games will be released for the machine at the same time, ranging in price from .99 for old games like Space Harrier Il and Super Thunderblade to .99 for big games like Ghouls 'n' Ghosts and Revenge of Shinobi (also known as Super Shinobi). ACTIVISION GRAB IREM AND GET DIZZY Coming soon to your computer screens via the auspices of Activision are two super Irem shoot 'em ups, R. Type II and Dragon Breed. The former is the sequel to R-Type (obviously), one of the best blasters of all time, and the latter puts you on the back of a fire-breathing dragon as you battle unearthly forces. Also coming soon from Activision is Spindizzy II, the ST and Amiga versions of the stunning 8 bit classic from three years back-look for reviews in the next few issues. 16-BIT 13 "


"DEVIEW anarchyi A Game over, and your ship is just flaming wreckage. Dands up, who remembers Defender? Flying over horizontally scrolling landscapes, blasting aliens and protecting the humans? Ah, nostalgia's not what it used to be... Thing is, aliens aren't the problem, this time. It's anarchists. Disorder and chaos have taken over, and it's down to you to put a stop to all of this. Starting off with a small but effective laser, you've got to fly around and, yep, blast 'em out of the skies! The anarchists have taken many forms, such as Darters (which zip all over the screen). Bouncers, Clusters and Blisters. These all perform various nefarious tasks. and do their absolute utmost to do you in. Contact with an anarchist or missile results in depleting your energy shield. Once the shield is gone, that's your lot. By collecting pods and coins left behind by recentlydeceased troublemakers, you can build up a pretty formidable armoury, containing such delights as devastators (smart bombs), cannon outriders or 'nackem power', KA-BLAM!

UPDATE Start saving your quids, Amiga owners. July sees the release of your version of Anarchy, which will also retail at .99. IIIIIIIIII ST .99 Any game that attempts to be as addictive as Defender has to be damned good, and I'm happy to say that Anarchy definitely achieves that, and then some. The graphical frills start right from booting up, and then the sound chip kicks in with a great heavy thumping rock track (just the thing to get the adrenalin going). Once into the game, you see exactly how much work has gone into this product. The graphics are small, but unbelievably fast, with ultra-fast totally smooth parallax scrolling. After the first few plays, it may seem a bit over-difficult, but after a few more tries, you find it's that little bit easier to play, and that much more addictive. The sheer quantity of animated stuff on screen at once is simply astounding, and coupled with the amount of aliens, bullets and other stuff, it's enough to make the mouth water. To be totally frank this is Defender to the max. Miss this one, and regret it forever. ROBERT SWAN GRAPHICS 96% SOUND 92% VALUE 95% PLAYABILITY 97% OVERALL 96% 15 "


"Find out its limits. Look in the mirror. ATARI SM124 "


"ST SERIES Introducing the powerful new Atari 1040 STE. With such an awesome machine, we're convinced the only limits you'll come across are your own. Based on the incredibly successful 1040 STFM, the 1040 STE itself goes beyond the limits of its predecessor. The 'E', by the way, stands for 'Enhanced'. But once you've discovered its amazing array of features, you may consider 'Enhanced' to be the understatement of the decade. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the 1040 STE is its graphics. Its palette contains over 4000 colours (all right, 4096 to be exact). To ensure precise and realistic images, the STE features 'hardware scrolling', enabling smooth scrolling in any direction and split-screen effects. And, with the SM124 monitor, you'll get razor sharp black-out-of-white text that's as clear as the type on this page. To complete the picture, it is able to 'phase lock' its video output to an external video source, permitting direct linking to a Genlocking device. The 1040 won't just have your eyes swivelling in their sockets. Your eardrums will also take a pounding from the 8-bit PCM stereo sound. The new PCM (Pulse Coded Modulation) sound system's two chips allow the 1040 STE to replay high-quality sampled sounds, in stereo, without burdening the CPU. Or, for even more of an earblasting, just add a couple of RCA output jacks and power the sounds through your own stereo. Of course we mustn't forget memory. One megabyte of RAM comes as standard. If that's not enough, the 1040 STE provides four SIMM sockets. Simply plug in some SIMM (Single Inline Memory Module) boards and boost the RAM up to four megabytes. To help you handle all this technology, we've added even more: a Blitter chip, capable of shifting data at high speeds independent of the CPU, and a new version of TOS. The TOS 1.6 (operating system) has an enhanced file selector with drive-change buttons, improved desktop with file move, MS-DOS compatible disk formatting, and better application installation and auto-booting facilities. As you'd expect, there's a huge range of peripherals including hard disks, floppy disks, laser printers, colour monitors and even Megafile 44, Atari's unique 44-megabyte removable hard disk. As well as all this hardware, there are hundreds of software programmes for the 1040 STE we're even throwing in the ST-Series Productivity and Leisure bundles free. The Productivity bundle features a database, spreadsheet, word processor and business graphics package, and there's S.T.A.C., FirST BASIC, Hyperpaint and Prince in the Leisure bundle. If you're itching to get your hands on the controls, there are two 15-pin analogue controller ports (which accept paddles, lightguns and light-pens) and a 9 pin mouse port and joystick port. With adaptors, up to six people can use the 1040 at one time. Just in case it's too much for one person to handle. At .99 it certainly won't be too much for one person to afford. The ideal computer at the ideal price, you may think. We think so, too. But there remains only one potential problem: not whether you'll make impossible demands of the 1040, but whether the 1040 will make impossible demands of you.

If so, what were the results? 2) I've recently sent away for a game (Golden Axe) from an advert in your magazine (Key Software). If I don't receive the game, what can I do about it? 3) Which system do you think is the best the Nintendo Entertainment System or the Sega Master System? 4) In Australia, we don't have things like the Sega Megadrive. Is the Megadrive similar to the Sega Genesis? Thanks a lot for answering my questions Daniel Whyte, Elizabeth, S. Australia, Down Under PS Now that you've answered the questions, can tell you what I think of Dear Mr YOB (what the hell does it stand for?). I would like to congratulate Graham Edwards and pal on his witty, charming and somewhat sophisticated game design (the one about Vincent Skipper in issue 103).

However, each screen is almost like a puzzle, and you've got to work out when to jump, roll, grab the ropes, shoot or whatever. The gameplay is nicely balanced, so that you seem to get a couple of screens further with every game, and as a consequence you keep on coming back for more just to see what lies around the next corner. The graphics are truly outstanding Bret is brilliant In the way he strides manfully along, and some of the creatures are superb, particularly the panther, the huge elephant (what's that doing in South America? Escaped from a zoo ! suppose) and the incredible giant stone demon on level four, which is a real stunner (and pretty nasty, too just watch what it does to the sacrificial victim!).

But these aren't just ordinary blocks, mind you, because these all have little symbols on them. How exciting! The aim of the game is to destroy a pile of said blocks by hurling another block with a particular symbol against blocks of the same \"denomination\". Once this happens, the blocks disappear, and in return, you get the last block to be hit. If there's no block (what a load of blocks Ed) that can be returned, this counts as a miss.

As a great fan of all three movies, I had high hopes for Back to the Future II. But after playing the game, I feel disappointed. The intro sequence with the DeLorean blasting off into the sky is a nice idea, but poorly executed (the car jerks along like a slug with bunions). Once into the game, things don't really pick up. The hoverboarding levels are alright, but the logic puzzles just don't fit in. Why not use other parts of the film, like flying the DeLorean in 2015, or being chased through Biff's Treasure Palace in 1985? The graphics are rough but adequate, and the characters look somewhat like their movie counterparts (with the exception of Marty, who could be anybody). Sound is a ho-hum rendition of the theme tune, along with so-so spot effects (what, no samples?), but it's the playability that's lacking. The hoverboard levels start to drag after a while, and sorting out sliding block puzzles gets more and more tedious with each play.

"REVIEW IIIIIIIII DIDI 100 Tanks block the route to the projector. 02 OL 5300 -SFBsell IIIIIII ST .99 Well, what can I say? Another Graftgold release another title to add to the C+VG List Of All-Time Classics. Simulcra combines Battle Zone with Tron to produce a tremendous 3D shoot 'em up, the like and standard of which I've not seen in years. The graphics are absolutely superb glittering explosions, swooping bombers, menacing helicopters sinister-looking tanks, and even the occasional Tron-ship (watch out for the mini Solar Sailors!). The bright, glowing colours look really beautiful against the empty blackness, too, and the objects are light-source-coloured with shadows to make them look that little bit more wonderful. Even when the screen is packed with polygons, the game still zips along, and the speed with which the landscape shifts around the SRV is astounding. The pace of the game makes playing it a totally dextral experience, and all your joystick skills will be called upon when you blunder onto a platform surrounded by six laser towers which promptly train their sights on you and begin blasting your shields off.

It puts you in command of a platoon of soldiers lost behind VietCong lines after a helicopter crash. As top man, it's up to you to get the boys across extreme. ly hazardous country and back to HQ safe and sound while keeping their morale high. Enemy attacks are dealt with in nicely staged Op Wolfesque subgames, and when you run across a village you can either terrorize the inhabitants with automatic weapons or ask them nicely for information. Apart from these few high points there isn't a whole lot of excitement or tension to be had from this game, though. There are some beautiful scenery graphics, but by their third appearance you're counting the seconds until you get back to the game, but even that, for the most part, consists of watching a red marker track across a map.

A bar tells you how much energy you have sus tain more than four hits and you're a goner. ILLIFE H II At the end of each level there's a guardian who must be destroyed. Get rid of the second one and you're given full ESWAT armour, which is capable of sustaining more hits and can also utilise the power-up weaponry that lies scattered across the landscape. The following six levels are basically similar to the previous two, only the criminals are much tougher and use all manner of weap ons and robots to try and get you. Remember, be careful out there. Basically, ESWAT is Super Shinobi with all sorts of mega guns and hulking great suits of cyber-armour. But even though it's not very original, it's one hell of a game. The sprites and backdrops are excellent, with brilliant parallax scrolling scenery, and all manner of beautifully animated baddies to blow into oblivion. The music is also great, with a variety of racing rock tunes and some meaty effects enhancing the atmosphere no end. The difficulty level is nicely balanced to draw you into the game, and it doesn't take long to get to level four, but from there on things get pretty tough, and it takes quite some practice to crack the remaining four levels. And even if you get through the game, there are a further three difficulty levels to challenge you, adding extra lasting appeal. If you're after a slick and highly playable arcade game, ESWAT is the one to go for. JULIAN RIGNALL GRAPHICS 93% SOUND 92% VALUE 90% PLAYABILITY 95% PAUSE A Mind your back.

Don Doko Don is best described as Bubble Bobble with sledgehammers, and believe me, it's weird. Okay, there's nothing new or original about it, but right from the intro (with flying pigs!) DDD is playable to the max. Smashing the oh-so-cute monsters (or the other player!) over the head is comical enough, but picking them up and hurling them against a wall is great fun. The graphics are sweeter than a sack of saccharin, and really colourful to boot. Sound is all cutesy squeaks and pings, and the little ditty that plays in the background fits the bill per fectly. The end of level guardians (you can't exactly call them nasties, they're so cute) are weird in the extreme, such as multi-headed pumpkins and giant teddies!

"Whoops! Remember to slow down before the corners! IIIIIIIIIII SEGA .99 SECA SECA 2 2 SEGA SECA E Les Red surges ahead, but there's still a long way to the front of the pack! When I discovered that this wasn't a conversion of the Super Monaco GP arcade machine I must confess to being rather disappointed. However, after playing it a couple of times I soon realised that this is a very good racing game indeed in fact the best yet seen on the Sega! The cars are tricky to drive at first and seem to spin off at every corner, but once you find the suspension and aileron settings that suit your driving style it becomes a very skillful game of braking into a corner and powering out through the bend (making sure you don't hit any other cars in the process). The twoplayer mode is obviously where this game scores highest it's very competitive, especially when you're racing against an entire field of other cars. But even on your own the game is immense fun, since the computer driver is no dummy and provides an even more formidable opponent than your average human! Super Monaco GP is an excellent racing game with tremendous lasting appeal, and is an absolute must for your games collection.

Select automatic, 3, 5 or 7 speed gearbox, then adjust the suspension and front ailerons for maximum grip. During the game a split screen display is used to show both players' cars, and there's also a radar map of the entire course showing where both players are. As you overtake the opposition, a number appears above your car to reveal your current placing. Points are awarded at the end of the race to top-placed drivers the aim is simply to be the highest scorer at the end of the season. "

If you were expecting it to be a straight conversion of the Master System Ghostbusters, you'll be surprised to find that the Megadrive game is completely different, with much more action of the \"jump-and-blast\" variety. The graphics are really good (each 'buster looks like his movie counterpart) and the in-game music is nice, if a little inappropriate. The title music is a major let-down, though because, rather than put the 10-channel stereo to work and make a really funky version of the Ray Parker Jr soundtrack, it sounds all tinkly and flat. The game itself is a bit of a killer, too. Even on the easy level, It's blimmin' hard work just to trying to knock out the middle ghosts, so it's not the easiest game to get into!
