"CVG CES NEWS THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH HYE SA Practically everyone who's anyone exhibits at the summer Consumer Electronic Show in Chicago. It's the time and the place where all of the games publishers reveal early versions or news of their Christmas biggies and hardware manufacturers woo the games makers with hush hush previews of their new machines. This year's show was a roaring success and we'll be telling you what to watch out for in our massive 16 page spesh. or two reasons the show was a little smaller than usual this year. Firstly, pretty well all of the software houses claim that they'll be releasing fewer but better games over the next 18 months. Secondly, none of the public were admitted because the money men and women were busy tying up deals to publish software on the new machines. Sega seemed to feel that with this Christmas' release of Mega Drive 32-X it's got everything in the bag. Its stand was smaller than even some of the lesser software houses. But Nintendo, which has been a bit left out of the hardware war, went for maximium overkill with show-stopping demos of its new Ultra 64 machine (formerly tagged as Project Reality) and the truly wonderful and hitherto-unheard-of SNES game, Donkey Kong Country. 3D0 games were in abundance on Panasonic, Goldstar and Sanyo machines, with the quality of 3D0 software coming on in leaps and bounds. Also on the machine side, two new, more affordable CD-i units were announced in time for a Christmas release, and Atari's CD add-on for the Jaguar was unveiled, along with a brace of brand new Jag games. However, this time round there were fewer new big name coin op and film licences doing the rounds, with notable exceptions such as Mortal Kombat II, True Lies, Lion King, Flintstones and Shadow. God knows how many film licences Ocean has done. More than anyone, certainly. But even the Manchester lads will be doing far fewer of them in future. The standards set by the up-and-coming machines will mean that games will be bigger and more expensive to produce and will take so long to make that there's less chance than ever of anyone tying together the release dates of films and games. Overall this was a show of few shocks and spills which nonetheless had more than enough good, interesting games on offer. There was plenty of news about SNES releases, but a further drop in the number of new Mega Drive titles. PC CD-ROM seems to be the big winner now... ATELIT 6 "


"THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH CES NEWS CVG Nintendo 8-9, 11 & 12 First updates on Project Reality, VR32, plus BIG, BIG news on a BIG, BIG SNES game Mega Drive 32-X 14-15 Drool, as you see for the very first time screens from these soon-to-bereleased games for the 32-bit upgrade for the Mega Drive Sega 16-17 The cream of the crop of forthcoming games on Mega Drive, Mega-CD and Game Gear Acclaim 18 One of the most interesting and pubilicity-hungry software houses of the last two years releases a host of new games and development kit that will change the face of entertainment forever. Virgin 19 In terms of qulaity and innovation you'd be hard pushed to find a more dynamic publisher than Virgin Interactive Entertainment. What did it come up with at the show? 3DO 21 This time last year it was the talk of the town, this year the games for it are vastly superior... Jaguar 22 The new CD drive, an innovative modem-cum-telephone headset, plus a ton of new games for Atari's super console PC 24 Who wants to see the first shots of Doom Il? You do, of course, along with Cyberia, Colonization and Lands of Lore II The new machines 25 At last, a cut-price CD-i, a new 3DO machine and the latest on the fabulous but oh-so-secret Sony PlayStation "


"CVG CES NEWS NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS USA WHEN Last year it was 3DO. This time round, the event that had everyone talking was Nintendo's 64-bit venture. Formerly known as Project Reality, Nintendo unveiled the ultra 64 to the press... intendo played the waiting game as journalists wondered whether they'd be allowed to see the machine in action. But the number of invitations rose steadily through the show and we were bussed off to a hotel suite where Nintendo staff had been polishing up their best PR spin. After waiting in a courtesy room we were led into a curtained-off area about six yards long and four wide. A Nintendo rep spoke to us. He needn't have used the microphone that made him sound like Ronald Reagan it was comny, but his easy charm and hard sales techniques built up expectations even more. He shouldn't have bothered. When the curtains were pulled back and we were let loose on the machines the sheer power of the Ultra 64 games was enough to bowl us over. There were just two games on show: the Nintendo Williams beat-'em-up Killer Instinct, and Cruisin' USA, a race game from the same team. They both play well in these early versions and look fabulous, Killer in particular. This is a blood-splattered Mortal Kombat-style fighting game which features fully raytraced space that are a dream to control. Ultra 64 will appear in the arcades before moving into the home. Both of the games we saw were inside coin-op cabinets, but Nintendo insists that the home versions will be exactly the same. That point is key. Killer Instinct and Cruisin' USA are two notches above anything in the arcades but if they make it into the home intact they may well knock the spots off anything Nintendo's rivals put on offer. Meanwhile Acclaim announced that it is the first third party developer to sign up for the system. Its currently working on a game based around characters from the Voyager comic books the publishers of which Acclaim bought up earlier in the year during another massive spending spree. YR32 A top and we mean top source has revealed details of Nintendo's VR32 machine that finally puts paid to speculation. WILD N. KONG he new VR32 system from Nintendo, exclusively revealed in issue 151, will NOT be an upgrade for the SNES, but will be a portable machine with a built-in VR headset, according to a source close to the head of Nintendo Of America. We're told that at the moment it can only display in black-and-white, although that shouldn't detract from the genuinely new experience it offers, claims our source. Apparently Nintendo's research & development boys are doing further research before the company makes a final decision on whether or not to release the machine. \"It's so different from anything else that the public will either love it or drop it like a stone,\" claimed the source.

"S NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS CES NEWS CVG 13A Kong needs to employ the help of other jungle dwellers to help him in his quest. Nintendo practically stole the CES show with its imminent launch of a Donkey Kong game but it's like nothing you've ever seen before on SNES! Clockins in at 32 leg this is also the biggest SNES latformer of all me. Cor! ou'd have thought that Nintendo would have plenty to shout about at CES, with its new machine, Ultra 64, wowing everyone who saw it. The Big N did have a product worthy of the size of the stand but it's not their new games machine. It was a real cracker under wraps to all but a select few. The product in question was a new SNES game, Donkey Kong Country and CVG is the first magazine any. where to bring you screenshots of this show-stopper! No prizes for guessing it's a platform game (alright then, maybe a bag of sweets) but what's got those in the know enthusing about Donkey Kong Country is the graphic style, the programmers have abandoned conventional sprites, in favour of rendered computer images to give the characters an ultra-realistic look. Using a technique called Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM). programmers Rare Ltd formally Ultimate, of Knight Lore fame and later a big performer on the NES stage have come up with certainly one of the best-looking SNES games for a long, long time, rivalling even some of the things we've seen on more advanced systems! Donkey Kong joins forces with a new sidekick, Diddy Kong, in a journey across a variety of magical worlds chock-full of goodies and baddies. There's no firm release date for Donkey Kong Country in the UK as yet, although with a US launch in November it's a fair bet that the game will appear before Christmas on this side of The Pond. Nintendo reckons that this one will put Mario to sleep for the next five years. A number one Yuletide chart position for Nintendo, perchance? tendo Nintendo has excelled this game it's say the best looking SNES game ever. "

"NEW SNES GAMES HEADING YOUR WAY CES NEWS CVG SNES attack THE FLINTSTOI VA With Mortal Kombat II and Super Street Fighter about to burst on to the scene, it seems a strange time to launch a pretty standard beat-'em-up. For everybody the consoles market is supSon posed to be in decline; but that hasn't stopped a glut of new releases for the Super Nintendo. Big names rubbed shoulders with the lesser-known titles, but only you can decide what will do well and what won't... THE FLINTSTONES Out: Autumn '94 Licensed from the recordbreaking new Spielberg movie starring John Goodman and Rick Moranis, The Flintstones features really big sprites, and the characters look like their on-screen counterparts. Unoriginality reigns supreme, though. IMPOSSIBLE MISSION 2025 Out: Autumn '94 Doing the rounds on the Amiga at present, the SNES conversion of the upgraded C64 mega-hit should do well when it's released, especially considering it's got the original game included on the cart as well as this new remix! but this time the blocks come in a multitude of shapes and sizes! The Game Boy version's great, receiving 84% in issue 152: the SNES game should be just as much fun. JELLY BOY Out: Autumn '94 Designed and programmed by Mortal Kombat boys Probe, you control Jelly Boy, a young feller who's able to morph into all manner of objects, such as hammers and even a helicopter, with hilarious results. WCW SUPERBRAWL WRESTLING Out: Autumn 94 It may be the poor relation to WWF, but this game based on WCW looks mighty impressive. It remains to be seen how it'll stand up against its betterknown counterpart in the gameplay stakes, though. UNIRACERS Out: Autumn '94 Take the speed of Sonic The Hedgehog, slap it onto a SNES cart and swap the central character for a unicycle and you've got the basic gist of Uniracers. Frantic one or two player action across over 100 different tracks! DONKEY KONG COUNTRY Out: Winter '94 The biggest SNES game yet 32Megs, the cart needs s much memory as it can Set to hold all those incrediSie rendered graphics. S7million is being spent in he US on promoting this platform romp, so you can be sure it'll sell by the barTel-load come November. THE SHADOW Out: Winter '94 Ocean has crossed Street Fighting with puzzle sections in its conversion of the comic book and radio show. It looks good, but does the SNES really need another beat-'em-up? VORTEX Out: Winter '94 Super FX games are taking off in a big way, and this one from Electro Brain has a distinctly Battletech look about it. PAC-MAN 2: THE NEW ADVENTURES Out: Winter '94 Pac returns in a sequel to the brilliant, if slightly dated. Pac Land coin-op! There are more monsters, bigger levels and, hey, a warm nostalgic feeling too. STARFLEET ACADEMY Out: Autumn '94 Want to learn how to fly like Captain Kirk? You'll be able to soon, when Interplay releases its starship simulator on to the Super Nintendo TINSTAR Out: Autumn '94 Don't worry. Super Scope owners: Nintendo hasn't forgotten about you as is proved by the forthcoming release of TinStar, a seven-level blaster set in a futuristic Wild West where the cowboys are robots! WARIO'S WOODS Out: Autumn '94 Up until now the staple diet of the Game Boy owner, SNES fans can now join in Se Tetris-style puzzling fun th this game based Sound Mario's arch enemy. Lirik together like-shaped gojects to score points and dear the screen Simple but highly addictive. LORD OF THE RINGS Out: Winter '94 The Super NES plays host to some surprisingly good RPGS, and Interplay's conversion of the classic Tolkien adventure epic should hold its own nicely in such venerable company as Zelda. INDIANA JONES' GREATEST ADVENTURES Out: Autumn '94 The man in the hat is back! It looks quite similar to the Star Wars games on SNES, which shouldn't surprise you since it's been created by JVC, who released both Super Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, and are soon to show off Super Return Of The Jedi! REX RONIN: EXPERIMENTAL SURGEON Out: Autumn '94 From the people who brought you the truly desperate diabetes blaster, Captain Novolin, comes Rex Ronin: Experimental Surgeon. The title on its own is probably enough to steer you away from a likely purchasing error. POPEYE Out: Autumn '94 The spinach-munching sailor makes an appearance on SNES in a fairly run-of-the-mill platform game. CLAY FIGHTER II Out: Winter '94 More characters! More combos! More clay! Yes, the Clay Fighters are back, in yet more gripping Street Fighter-ish antics. SUPER PUNCH-OUT Out Autumn 94 An upgraded version of the popular boxing coin-op of a Se years back. Those with long memories will remember Frank Bruno's Boxing on Spectrum, which was very much based on this same. More characters and new moves feature this time around. ASP: AIR STRIKE PATROL Out: Winter '94 Have a guess what the programmers have been hooked on while creating this forced perspective action wargame? The reek of Desert Strike is almost nauseous! MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS Out: Winter '94 The surprise kids' TV hit becomes a videogame, during which you're bound to run into all manner of enemies in a platform-based setting. Hope it's better than the telly show. BLACKTHORNE Out: Winter 94 Nothing to do with cider, Blackthorne is a platformbased, rotoscoped slash-emup, a bit like Flashback but in bygone days. Great graphics and sounds abound. WOLVERINE: AN X-MEN TALE Out: Winter '94 Going solo for a while after a long stint with the X-Men. Wolverine stars in his own platform game! Look out for this one, probably on the Acclaim label. TETRIS 2 Out Autumn '94 The sequel to the most popular puzzler ever comes to SNES! More of the same, THE DEATH AND RETURN OF SUPERMAN Out: Autumn '94 There's never been a Superman game on SNES yet, and this one from the ULTIMATE FIGHTER Out: Winter '94 "


"CVG CES NEWS TOP TITLES FOR ALL NINTENDO CONSOLES SNES attack NES SA The 8-bit NES continues to hang on in there, despite Nintendo's best efforts to get you to upgrade. Again, there are some big titles on the way, although it's likely that this is the last time we'll see the NES at CES. STREET RACER Out: Autumn '94 This two-player racer from UBI Soft actually doesn't look that bad at all. The Mode-7 graphics work well, and there seems to be quite a challenge there. The split-screen option doesn't suffer from noticeable slowdown, either. Konami looks to have created a pretty accurate conversion of the 16-bit battler; let's hope that it plays more like the SNES game than its Sega forebear. Sun Corporation could be a good 'un, with big sprites and frantic gameplay. It looks a bit Final Fight-y, though. BEST OF THE BEST CHAMPIONSHIP KARATE Out: Autumn '94 It went down a storm on Amiga, SNES and PC Engine, and it's about to repeat the success on 8-bit Nintendo. Those sprites are awesomely animated, and the gameplay's pretty sharp, too. RESCUE RANGERS 2 Out: Winter '94 Capcom takes time off from its Street Fighting ways to produce the sequel to Rescue Rangers. That cute duo. Chip and Dale, make a welcome return in a platform which looks a lot like Super Mario Bros III. Hope it plays as good. CHAMPIONSHIP POOL Out: Autumn '94 It may not be Jimmy White's in all its 3D glory. but this top-down pool sim won high praise on SNES, and this is an almost spoton convert. WERSA SHIEN'S REVENGE Out: Winter '94 It's been a while since we've seen an Operation Wolf game on SNES. Apart from Lethal Enforcers. Mind you, this one does have some big, chunky sprites. Hurrah. THE BLUE MARLIN Out: Winter '94 Jack Charlton's Match Fishing take a hike! The NES brings you sea-fishing at its most exciting! Sit for ages! Wait for a fish! Catch it! The fun never ends... REN AND STIMPY: BUCKAROO$ Out: Autumn '94 Cat and dog duos don't come much stranger than these two, and they're about to strut their stuff on 8-bit. MICKEY'S ADVENTURE IN NUMBERLAND Out: Winter '94 It's a platform game! Guide Mickey through the many levels of Numberland, picking up, erm, numbers as you travel. Sounds a hoot and a half. THE JETSONS: INVASION OF THE PLANET PIRATES Out: Autumn '94 Join George Jetson and the rest of his future family in a 90s videogame representation of the popular, Hana Barbera 70s cartoon TURTLES TOURNAMENT FIGHTERS Out: Winter '94 WWF KING OF THE RING Out: Autumn 94 Owen Hart is the new King of the Ring see how you fare in Acclaim's NES adaptation of the 16-bit hit. SAMURAI SHODOWN Out: Winter '94 Why buy an expensive Neo Geo when you can soon get the best beat-'em-up for that machine on your SNES? DOUBLE DRAGON V: THE SHADOW Game Boy Nintendo concentrated more on the launch of the new Super Game Boy add on for SNES than announcing new titles for the handheld, but that didn't stop a clutch of third party softcos from airing their wares. insects could well be inter ested in this an interest ing title which has you messing around with cockroaches! Out: Winter '94 If you're not fed up to the back teeth of Double Dragon games by now, then here's one that should keep you happy for at least a few minutes. Look out for its release at around the same time as the Double Dragon movie. STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION Out: Autumn '94 Let's hope that this is a different version to the one currently doing the rounds on SNES. Because that game. quite frankly, isn't very good. SEAQUEST DSV Out: Autumn '94 Steven Spielberg's low-quality TV show becomes you guessed it a horizontally scrolling underwater shoot-'em-up. In a submanne, naturally. RIDDICK BOWE BOXING Out: Autumn 94 All the talk at 1985 the moment is of Lennox Lewis and Riddick Bowe climbing back into the ring together, so this boxing sim couldn't be timed better. SUPER GODZILLA Out: Autumn '94 What makes this beat-'emup stand out from the crowd is the huge sprites. They're a bit wiffy in the animation department though, and the action's hardly up to Street Fighter Il quality. FLINK Out: Autumn '94 Receiving a fair amount of attention on Mega Drive, Psygnosis latest platformer looks the part, but can it compete with the likes of Donkey Kong Country? MEGA MAN 5 Out: Autumn '94 Mega Man makes a wel come retum to the little Nintendo and if you get yourself a Super Game Boy you can enjoy his platform antics in colour! BLACK BASS LURE FISHING Out: Winter '94 We're not sure why these fishing sims are so popular in the States, but they obviously are because at least four appear every year! DAFFY DUCK Out: Autumn '94 Daffy becomes Duck Dodgers in the 23rd (and a half) Century on Game Boy! And owners of Super Game Boy can play in living colour, too! TIP OFF Out: Autumn '94 Originally appearing on Amiga, Ubi Soft has converted this not-bad basketball sim to the Game Boy MICKEY MANIA Out: Winter '94 Where would the SNES be without its Mickey Mouse games? It's been a while since MM's been seen on console. and this one could be the best of the bunch. BONK'S REVENGE Out: Winter '94 Better known as PC Kid II. the little, bald prehistoric one returns to Game Boy in a conversion of the top PC Engine game. YOGI BEAR Out: Autumn '94 Pickernick baskets and avoiding count less parkbased ene mies are what's on Yogi's mind in this jolly-looking platformer. CASINO! Out: Autumn '94 Everybody likes a bet, especially when they don't lose. And you can't lose with Interplay's compilation of casino games there's nowhere to stick the coins! STOP THAT ROACH! Out: Autumn '94 Lovers of puzzle games and horrid 12 "

"CVG CES NEWS TURBOCHARGED GAMING LOA SEGA strikes back With Nintendo currently stuck on the grid in the 32-Bit technology race, Sega claims that next year it will put its opposition on the shelf for good, and here's why... 327 ames, it's had a few. Mars, MD-32 and now Mega Drive 32X. The latest addition to the Sega range promises to revitalise the flagging Mega Drive market. With the Saturn conspicuously absent from Sega's stand it was left up to the firm's new wonder peripheral to draw the crowds. Everything about the 32-X had an air of being rushed. There wasn't a completed version of the machine on show, no finished games either. The packaging for it and the games are still at the mock-up stage and look more like Kodak film boxes than traditional Sega branded material. Even so, for something which was just a rumour a few months ago. Sega seems to have moved mountains to get it and the games up and running for a Christmas release. And there's one overriding fact it's going to be good. As you probably know, it plugs into the cartridge slot of the Mega Drive, but once it's in that's it, there's no need to take it out again. All existing Mega Drive games should run through it. Also, despite rumours to the contrary, the 32-X also works with the Mega-CD, with four CD releases planned in the first batch of games. The demo of Virtua Racing Deluxe on 32-X was running opposite Virtua Racing on Mega Drive. The 32-X version runs with twice as many polygons, tons more colours, a faster frame rate and added tracks and cars. With a provisional retail price of just  you can't argue with the power-to-price ratio. But should you wait for the Saturn? We'll have to see when the machine hits these shores in November Golf's Great 36 Holes CONTINUE? VES INO Shadow Of Atlantis Star Wars Arcade Sega Well, you can hardly go wrong with a golf game, so it looks as though Sega is on to a safe bet here. Realistic graphics are what's on offer, but even with 32-Bit power behind it, topping PGA Golf won't be easy. Sega With the coin-op's future in the balance, one thing's for sure in Virtua Star Wars' life that'll be converted to 32-X. Anything with Star Wars attached to it is a big seller these days, and from what we've seen this won't be an exception Sega Of all the initial 32-Bit games, this looks like being the most original. It's an aquatic adventure which makes full use of the machine's extended colour palette to produce some excellent rendered images. Fahrenheit 023 SFAHRENHEIT Sega Bringing the Mega-CD into play comes the 32-X's first Tru Video game. Basically it's an FMV adventure, but unlike previous games of that ilk on Mega-CD, the graphics will be almost video quality I atro Asco w orsport Jure hyperpoce S sodby to recete srders THE SATURN WILL FOLLOW EARLY NEXT YEAR WITH AN ESTIMATED RETAIL 14 THE MEGA DRIVE 32-X IS SCHEDULED FOR RELEASE THIS YEAR PRICE OF  "

Especially as Sega had a il colour Cinepak demo featuring the game's logo on show, RHAWI THE DOLPHIN Sega As far as we could tell all the Deluxe refers to in the title is that the game, will be almost arcade perfect, with a similar number of polygons on screen and the same ultra-fast speed. A few extra tracks wouldn't go amiss, though. Cyber Brawl Virtua Fighters Sega Although Sega's official 32-X press packs don't mention Virtua Fighters, it's hard to see them not converting it from this coin-op version especially with Virtua Racing on the way. Sega As if the likes of Mortal II and Virtua Fighters wasn't enough. Cyber Brawl gives you one-onone 3D combat action. This should be coming out in the first batch of 32-Bit games. Sega have yet to publish shots, though, which suggests that this game might not see the light of day until some time next year. We'll just have to wait and see what happens. Mortal Kombat Il NBA Tempo Deluxe Acclaim This will be a conversion of the latest version of the world's most successful coin-op. Again, it's hard to envisage it being any. thing less than arcade perfect. Acclaim This is one game which holds so much potential on 32-Bit. While the standard Mega Drive version promises to be good, you might as well be playing the coin-op when you play this. Sega Where would Sega be without cutesy games? Nowhere's the answer. So continuing in the tradition is Tempo, which introduces a completely new character to Sega's already vast range of marketable stars. Fingers crossed we'll also be seeing the likes of Toejam & Earl appearing on the 32-X Alien Trilogy Super Motocross Acclaim Although Acclaim is keeping pretty quiet on this, it looks as though this will be one of the first third party 32-X games to make use of the Mega-CD. We've seen it running on a development machine and can honestly say this is going to be a landmark title. We've never seen anything quite like it before. Sega Putting the 32-X's scaling hardware to use will be this dirt track bike race game. There aren't many details yet, but it will be one of the first releases. Chances are Sega will push the boat out with this, especially when you look at how well titles such as Super Hang-on have worked for them in the past. 199 100 2009 32-bit Doom CPU: 2 Hitachi 32-Bit Sega Alt. so you're probably sick of hearing us harp on about how great this game is. but IT IS.

"CVG CES NEWS ACCLAIM HITS THE WINDY CITY 13A ACCL AIM BIG GAMES. BIG CLAIMS mortal kombat II Money bags Acclaim has the year's biggest names tied up... due SNES, Game Boy, Game Gear You can check out the Mega Drive version in Our Work In Progress on page 40 here, however, you can delight at the first shots of the SNES Game Boy and Game Gear ver sions of the game that's sure to be number one for ages when it appears. As we said earler, the battle begins. ever the sort of company to miss out on the really BIG licences, Acclaim was more than happy to show off what could well be the biggest box-office hit of the year True Lies. Starring Amold Schwarzenegger, True Lies involves Amie taking on nuclear terrorists around the world, getting into all manner of shooting people-related scrapes while his family and friends believe he's got an ordinary, 9-to-5 job! Sounds a bit of a cracker, and the game is due for release in October across all formats. But what's even more exciting, certainly for those of you looking to upgrade to one of the new range of CD machines appearing between now and Christmas, is a new graphics programming system devised by Acclaim's US-based research and development arm, which allows the creation of FMV-quality sprites that are, in actual fact, entirely computer generated! What this means for the gamer is that, whereas full-motion video graphics are impossible to take control of with a joystick, this new system allows 100% interaction. Characters are created by first building a wire-frame model of a character, then texture-mapping computer scanned features over the top of this digital skeleton to give a totally realistic-looking character which you can control instead of just watch. The first example we've seen of this new technology in action is a demo called Duel, which shows a human character and a massive alien battling it out across a rendered 3D landscape. You can judge the quality of the graphics for yourself by taking a look at the screenshots on this page, but stills really do not convey the quality of the animation: we are talking MOVIE QUALITY, 24 frames-per-second movement, with a full range of moves for both characters the alien character even mutates into an even bigger beast! The scope for this system is huge; Duel, for example, paves the way for a brand new breed of beat-'em-up. And because features such as skin, hair and facial structure are texture mapped on to the skeleton, there's no need to draw a massive amount of different bodies, which cuts down on memory usage. Indeed, as you can see from the shots, alien battlers can be tumed into ice hockey players with ease. We ve had a sneak preview of this system in use in a game that's actually being released on Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in May, it's a huge movie licence and, if everything goes according to plan, it'll be the best game ever seen! Details are hush-hush at present, but rest assured, CVG will bring you the full SP on this fantastic new breakthrough and the first games to use it very soon indeed. Stay tuned this is going to change the face of videogaming as we know it! Not an actual game, but a demonstration of the capa bilities of Acclaim's new graphics programming system, devised by the firm's US-based R&D department. ATG (Advanced Technologies Group). Using digital actors, the game creator can now produce FMV-quality char acters which are fully interactive. Look out for news on a couple of new movie licences which exploit this incredible system soon. stargate SNES, Mega Drive Stargate is being tipped as one of the big movies to see over the next few months. The plot revolves around time travel and aliens having cre ated the pyramids and such like, and the game is predominantly left-to-night scrolling with 3D flying sections built in for good measure. true lies SNES, Mega Drive Here's the first ever shot of True Lies.

"BORN AGAIN CONSOLES CES NEWS CVG R MACHNEYE Plenty of new machines were unveiled at the CES, but, sadly, there were no surprises. Console yourself with six new consoles instead... REVEALED! Four new CD-i's! hilips really pushed the CD-i boat out at CES, unveiling no less than three new versions of the machine. From Magnavox comes the CD1450 and 550 consoles. These forsake the video look of the existing machines for something which resembles a PC Engine Duo. The 450 will sell in America for $299 (), while the 550, which has a built-in Digital Video Cartridge costs $499 (). Philips plans to launch its own versions of the machines in the UK before Chrismas, although import taxes may affect the prices. Meanwhile Goldstar, which is more used to producing low-cost videos and TVs, has also unveiled two machines. The cheaper machine is aimed at Joe Public as a games and general entertainment system, while the second, more expensive, CD-i will be a portable system possibly aimed at businesses. Not to be out done, Philips announced the launch of two more systems. One is the long expected hi-fi midi system with built-in CD-i, with the other being a TV and CD-i all-in-one unit. More 3DO! Sony keep schtumm e might still be waiting for the first official 3DOs to arrive in this country (Panasonic reckons it could have its version out as early as September), Goldstar has jumped on the bandwagon with yet another variation on the console Its version will come with built-in FMV capabilities to run video CDs something which the other machines lack. However, this will make it the most expensive one of the lot, so whether it will be a hit or not remains to be seen. Playstation V. GoldStar GS ccording to Jeffrey Fox, Director of Communications for Sony USA, the number of people who've seen the new 32-bit Sony PlayStation running games and who haven't been impressed can be written on a matchbox, Opinions on any new machine become more divided as time goes by but that hasn't stopped certain soit ware bosses from claiming that they'd seen stuff on the PlayStation to make you weep with joy. Sony isn't showing anything to the public yet. They claim that if too much interest is generated too soon software publishers will be pressurised into releasing early dud games. For the latest gossip on the PlayStation turn to page 28 of news. Goldstar is set to launch its own 3DO. Will it be (like the screenshot) Out of This World? The PlayStation is waiting in the wings. 25 "

"ED'S COMMENT CVG FUTURE'S S BRIGHT... The battle begins, Mortal gets into Kombat mode in our comprehensive preview on pages 40-42 he Summer Consumer Electronics Show has finished in Chicago (as you may have gathered from the 16-page CES special preceeding this page), and if there were any thoughts of this industry sinking under a pile of unoriginality, then they can be cautiously dispelled. For, despite a sprinkling of platformers and beat-'em-ups, there was a goodly amount of new and exciting software and machines on show at CES. It seems software producers are getting the message that the public will not get what it's given; mind you, looking at some of the sales figures of the past six months can also lead me to believe that they've had matchsticks wedged under their eyelids and been forced to look. Sure, unoriginality continues, but you have to give the games biz its due: having been gifted with the greatest leap in technology yet seen, it's trying to come up with something new. Most impressive is a new development system that puts players in a supposed FMV environment that's computer generated, allowing for almost movie-like graphic realism, as well as freedom of movement and interactivity anywhere in the game The beat-'em-up every world. I've seen the first game to use this new system, it's a Mega Drive and SNES huge movie licence and it's gone a long, long way to restoring owner is waiting for. Worth my confidence in this genre. the cash? Pages 58-59. The thing is, you're going to have to spend more on the new technology than the  you're used to spending on consoles. The LEEB point is, which type of person are you going to be one who goes 'too expensive' or the other, who reaches for the future of gaming, knowing tomorrow's games are going to deliver? I know which side of the fence I'm sitting on especially when I know that this 'future' is closer than most people think. Happy gaming. RAND OUR REVIEWS POLICY Here at CVG we're independent of any hardware manufacturer, so we'll let you know whether a game is available on other formats, whether there are better examples of the game on that system, and most importantly whether it's any good. Unlike other magazines which base their scores on the views of one person, our ratings are arrived at after lengthy discussion bet-ween the CVG team about each title's good or bad points, with the overall score being a separate mark based on the quality of the game NOT an average of the other marks. For the sake of those who want to refer to back issues, if we recommend an alternative game we'll keep its original score, but obviously times change and what may have been a great game a couple of years ago, now may be a bit passe. However in the past five years alone we've reviewed around 1,000 games, so you can be sure that our recommendations come with an accumulated wealth of gameplaying experience. WHERE'S ME SATURN SOCCER PIC? If a game scores more than 90% we'll award it a sought-after CVG HIT! Cock up? What cock up?

"CVG NEWS FIRST PLAYSTATION TITLES ANNOUNCED NEWS NEO-GEO CD IT'S PLAYTIME! \"EXPOSED Recently revealed at the Tokyo Fair was the the new Neo-Geo CD system from SNK. Now fully CD-based the latest system isn't compatible with existing carts, but has an enhanced spec thanks to a new RISC chip which allegedly positions it on par with the likes of Sega's Saturn. Apparently the launch went down so well that Sega held an emergency meeting afterwards to discuss this new threat. Sporting a newly designed arcade joystick, the Neo-Geo CD should make it to our shores soon, with a price tag of -350. As for existing Neo-Geo owners, there's no need to worry as SNK has no plans to discontinue its cartridge-based platform which may even receive a further price cut. ore and more news is emerging on Sony's new 32-bit PlayStation. After CVG exclusively revealed first pictures of the machine last month, we can now confirm that there are over 80 titles currently in progress from worldwide signings of over 160 third-party developers. Big name games which will be making an appearance include arcade smashes such as Super Street Fighter II from Capcom, Ridge Racer and Cybersled from Namco, Raiden 1 and 2 and the coin-op version of Parodius from Konami. As far as non coin-op games are concerned ORA-194, which is a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up, and Zero Device, which is a robotic beat-'em-up, seem to be the titles causing the greatest excitement in Japan. Rumours are now starting to circulate as to what games will be bundled with the machine. Sony isn't dropping any clues as yet, but a couple of developers working on the machine have told us that there's likely to be three to four games bundled with the system, of which Raiden 2 is highly likely to be one of them. There's also a nice little story doing the rounds about Psygnos wanting to put Lemmings on the PlayStation, but Sony has apparently said 'no'Judging by the developers' list there certainly seems to be a bias towards shoot-'em-ups on the Sony console, but don't let that put you off. Although we were disappointed to find out that the PlayStation only uses a double-speed CD drive (like 3DO and CD32) its 32-bit RISC chip and custom graphics chips are believed to offer a staggering combined speed of 500mips (millions of instructions a second), which leaves everything around at the moment standing. There's also a facility to link up two machines for modem-type multi-play. So there you have it. Here is a machine which seems to offer programmers the power to do what they like. So isn't it about time we saw some revolutionary games rather than just evolutionary ones? Sonic 3 solved THE Titan Books has released the official Sonic 3 players' guide, featuring over 4,000 screen shots, solutions and tips from the cre. OFFICIAL ators of Sonic. Every zone in the game is GUIDE mapped and all bonus stages and secret rooms are revealed. At .99 it's perhaps a bit steep, but it's well put together with 97 tip-packed pages. SCGA If you're wondering why the joystick plug is so thick, it's because the slot above the joystick fits a RAM card for saving games etc. A Featuring a 32-bit-RISC chip, the Sony PlayStation measures 25 by 20cm and will include S-VHS and RGB output sockets. 4,000 28 ONE OF THE FIRST THIRD-PARTY RELEASES TO APPEAR FOR THE SONY PLAYSTATION WILL BE ALIEN TRILOGY FROM ACCLAIM, WHICH IS ALSO BEING PRODUCED FOR THE NEW SEGA MACHINES "


"11000 IN DOUBLE DRAGON DRAMA NEWS CVG SATURN AIMS TO BLOW PLANET EARTH DOUBLE DRAGON MOVIE FOR XMAS Take a look at the first on-set shots from the Double Dragon movie due out on November 4. An $8million marketing spend for the movie will no doubt focus heavily on the Double Dragon V game scheduled for an August release on SNES, MD and Jaguar. Predictably the movie is about rival gangs and the battle of the Double Dragon Duo as they try to prevent a magical medallion from falling into the wrong hands. Could it be worse than the Super Mario Bros movie? Surely not. Watch this space punters. he most anticipated item on show at this year's Tokyo Fair has to have been the Sega Saturn. However, punters still didn't get a chance to actually play any games on the system and had to make do with another of those Sega video walls. A more complete version of Virtua Fighters was on display, featuring sprites with most of their facial features and body texture added, but they still lacked the res olution of the coin-op worrying. Word has it that Fighters on the Saturn will also incorporate extra moves not found on the coin-op to make it more playable, since the coin-op hasn't been as popular as it was hoped it would be, apparently Elsewhere on the Sega stand was a first look at a Saturn joystick, looking surprisingly large. We could not actually find out if this will be the bundled Saturn stick, but our guess is that it'll be sold as a luxury extra. A Unknown actors and actresses abound in Double Dragon, although there is a big name in there Robert Patrick, who played the T1000 in Terminator 2. One of the Lee brothers, from the new movie Double Dragon, opening in November. Dragon's moving on up The release date for VIE's Dragon has now been put back to October, following the decision to add an amazing 15 extra moves to the game and include blood in the American version. We gave Dragon on SNES 84% in issue 152, and these extra enhancements could well tip the beat'em-up into 90% territory. Well done, VIE, for responding positively to criticism. Super! FX from NEC NEC, creator of the popular Japanese 8-bit console the PC Engine, has also entered the 32-bit race with a new system provisionally titled 'FX'. The machine contains most of the circuitry from the PC Engine Duo, but enhanced to run fullscreen animation at 30 frames per second. The FX also uses JPEG rather than MPEG for video compression, which should mean sharper pictures too. NEC predicts a November launch, but no details on price have been announced as yet. 29 "

Up to four players can adopt a league team, then get to grips with tactics, finances, sponsorship deals and slapping down stroppy French players. Unlike other managerial games which tend to consist of plenty of text screens and almost no graphics, On The Ball packs a weighty 45 minutes of visual action, including free kicks, penalties, goals galore and faked injuries.

It's based on the hugely successful Spiderman: Max Carnage comic and will feature all the key characters from the story, including Captain America and Shriek. The game's at quite an advanced stage now, and the large graphics seem to have captured the feel of the comic, right down to the 'pows' and other assorted comic book sound effects which appear when a villain is slapped around. Best of all you can play the part of Venom as well as Spidey, which is great as his outfit is much better than web-head's. A Get back to real gameplaying with Super Stardust a really hot title.

We've seen the game up and running and it really is something else. The graphics are amongst some of the best we've ever seen on the Amiga, with hi-res 256 colour sprites, parallax scrolling and amazing backgrounds. It still sticks to the original gameplay though, with Asteroids-style levels punctuated with awesomely fast tunnel stages.

The game uses an enhanced version of the TFX 3D engine to create some amazing visual effects. The game's basically a futuristic flight sim, but instead of merely whizzing past objects and blasting them, you get to fly inside them negotiating cramped tunnels while fending off other craft. The action is backed up by a host of animated cut scenes which serve to update the storyline. Providing nothing goes drastically wrong, this could well be the number one CD-ROM game at Christmas.

"CVG FEATURE FROM BIG-SCREEN BLOCKBUSTER.. The film licensing game took off in a big way with Activision's release of Ghostbusters way back in those 8-bit days of 1984. It caused a sensation, despite carrying one of the heftiest price tags around at that time an enormous .99! Games based on films have been raking it in for softcos for a decade, but are these licences really up to scratch? Paul Rand delves into the cash-crazy world of the film tie-in... atman. Rambo. The Terminator. What have they got in common? They've all made the jump from the big screen to the small games screen. The movie game business is one of the biggest money-spinners in the market but is it reaching the end of its life? WE NEED A HERO The gamesplaying public were hooked, though for the first time you could become a movie hero and fight the bad guys, just like the real actors did on-screen. That was the idea, anyway. What you actually got on your monitor, though, was a pretty unappealing time, riding around a map screen to a variety of similar-looking locations and trapping ghosts using a laser-style weapon. The graphics were shoddy, the music offensive and the gameplay limited, to say the least. But the game went down a storm, creating in its wake a new market for software companies eager to cash in on the computer boom. Ten years on from then and little seems to have changed in the film licensing market. The technology has improved beyond all recognition you can actually understand what people are saying these days but the basic nature of movie-licensed product remains annoyingly consistent. THE MOVIE 26 "


"..TO SMALL-SCREEN MONEYSPINNER FEATURE CVG D1:0132:15 MOVIES COME TO LIFE With the arrival of new videogame systems, software developers are now able to incorporate a variety of new techniques into the production of film licences. Some companies, such as Virgin with its forthcoming Demolition Man game, are digitising real actors in this case, Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes on green-screen chromakey backgrounds. The developer then simply swaps the green-screen background for a conventionally-drawn back. drop and hey presto Sly 'n' Wes come to life on your machine. On the other hand, take a look at SCI's Lawnmower Man. The firm took advantage of the movie's virtual reality storyline and stuck the whole game in a computer-generated VR environment, allowing the use of some incredible graphics thanks to the storage capacity of compact disc, as well as the ultra-powerful processors of today's sophisticated games systems. ter make sure that the film they're staking their wedge in is going to be a sure-fire success. And if the movie does turn out to be a flop, you're in it deep; imagine, for instance, the faces down at Sony HQ when they a) read the reviews of Arnie flop Last Action Hero then b) saw the finished version of the game. Considering that the budget for an original game isn't subject to the demands of the huge cost of film licences. paid up-front in order to fund cartridge production, companies had bet. ROBO, BRUCE AND ARNIE There have been some very good examples of film-based games -anyone who's owned an Amiga for a couple of years will remember just how good Ocean's conversion of the (just released) Robocop 3 movie was. One of 3D specialist DID's first products, Robocop 3 had you immersed in a polygon-based three-dimensional extravaganza. In most instances, however, you get a basic platform engine with a couple of barely recognis. able sprites running around, which the software company purports to be either Arnie, Willis or others of their ilk. But no matter how rough and ready these titles are, many of them sell by the bucketload. Why is this? Alison Fennah of Acclaim, publisher of True Lies (the licence of Arnie's latest film) is adamant that it's an aid to shifting quality product. Â«If a game is good to start with, the awareness it has indeed ever, the case. because it has been But hey, if there's money released as a movie to be made... brings it to the forefront, garners a higher profile, LAME LICENCES allows it to benefit from With blockbuster film additional marketing and rights running to upwards contributes to its suc of ,000,000, it's little cess.\" wonder that only the big Simon Alty, Marketing boys can Manager of afford to Ocean, a firm with \"Original proddabble in strong links to the uct does not what can be movie licensing get the intense a very lucra world, is under no time con tive area of illusions as to the straints put the market. success of this upon it that a Sure, the type of product. movie licence smaller \"The whole stratedoes\" softcos can gy behind securSimon Alty play in a ing a movie Marketing Manager smaller way licence is to purby buying chase predeterup the mined consumer rights to TV perception.

Nice one, Sony. sive corner of the games market? Simon Alty is adamant; \"From Ocean's point of view movie licences will grow less and less in the medium term. Games on the new formats demand a development cycle much longer than before, and this lessens any impact of simultaneous game and film release unless we get involved in a movie project at script.\" Alty adds though, Movie licences have helped bring Ocean tremendous success over the years. They provide maximum press coverage and cross over into all media. They have accounted, however, for only 10-15% of our product releases and I would make an educated guess that this carries across to all game releases over the past 10 years. So original product reigns supreme it just doesn't get the front page of the specialist press as often!\" Fennah, on the other hand, is more bullish; \"Movies will continue to provide exciting themes for videogames.

When Electronic Arts came in a couple of weeks back, though, with the latest in a hockey series that stretches back nearly five years, there wasn't exactly a rush to see it. Why? Primarily because the last two versions changed very little from the definitive NHL '92. This time round, though, the news is much better. EA has listened to the criticism and has radically overhauled the game engine. The most noticeable difference is in the graphics which now have a lower viewpoint and larger player sprites. Add to this the ability to play a full season, a player trading option, a create-player option and new player moves and EA could well have pro. grammed a hockey game to rival the brilliance of the original. Look out for the review in a couple of issues' time. In NHL Hockey scoring has never been the easiest of things until you're a pro and with improved artificial intelligence expect it to require even more talent. The new lower viewpoint and larger player sprites make for more realistic player movements, but thankfully the great gameplay will be untouched. Players can get injured, but not from fighting. The fight option from the original EA Hockey is still missing. A two-on-two practice mode will let you try out all the new moves without the stress of a real game. One of the new player moves will entail the defenders div. ing down to stop an opposition team's slapshot going any. where near the goal. ALTERNATIVE TRADE PLAYER GAME BOY Speedball 11 CHICAGO POSITION RATING POSITION BOT Nintendo/24.99 The nearest to hockey that you can get on the Game Boy. Speedball is a futuresDETROIT port game, ie it's very violent, and this is an excellent conversion of what was originally a big hit on the 16-bits. ISSUE 135: 86% RATI It has to be said that the graphics were starting to look a little dated, after remaining much the same in the previous four games, so finally they've been given a Nineties gloss. Players can now be bought and sold on the transfer market. Teams can also be created from scratch so you could, for instance, have a team made up of CVG staff. (Saddo.)

The thrills, the spills, Klinsmann's dives perfection. And England didn't do too badly either, although why they changed their name to Ireland I'll never know.' GARY Gaz isn't what you'd call mad on our national game, preferring to watch a couple of overpaid characterless types knock a ball over a net for an hour-and-a-half. But there must have been something in the month-long festival of footer that caught the eye of the Lord? The electric carts were a good laugh', comments Gary. It just goes to show how lazy these so-called 'professional footballers are, if they can't be bothered to walk off the pitch. What a miserable sod, eh readers? Roll up! Roll up! It's all the fun of the fair in Bullfrog's most eagerlyawaited game yet! t's summer again, and no doubt many of you are looking forward to a well-deserved break from school/college/work/the dole queue and a couple of weeks away on your hols. If that's the case, then it's a fair guess that many of you will be visiting one of the many theme parks around the world, such as Disney Land, Disney World and, erm, EuroDisney. Of course, if you can't be had with all those blokes dressing up as Mickey and Pluto, there's a host of others to choose from. And, if you're family is too tight to take you away with them, then you could always while away the time with Theme Park, the latest from Syndicate and Populous creator Pete Molyneux and his Bullfrog team. The aim of the game is to build your own funfair, including in it everything you'd expect to find in a real one. And while this may sound a very difficult task, actually building the thing is a cinch. It's making it and keeping it profitable that's the swine. DENIZ Deniz's favourite bit of the World Cup is the same every time it's on. I always have a good laugh when the winners actually receive the Cup.' Pray, tell us why. 'It's just the obviously pretend took of joy they have on their faces when they receive it. I mean, it looks nice and everything, but it's a bit small and the players don't get a big, fat cheque like other sportsmen do. And anyway, you'd think Germany would be sick of walking up those steps by now, wouldn't you. AIK You'd think that, with all the drama, controversy and goals displayed during World Cup USA '94. footy fanatic Rik would have been on his seat for the entire month, able to spout forth his feelings on the game we all know and love.

Ha. 23 JUL MAAK Mark's a big fan of triumph over adversity. He is an Arsenal supporter, after all. So the dramatic first-round game between Italy and Norway really caught the miniature Gooner's attention. I didn't particularly want Italy to win, but those Norwegians were appalling, even when they had a three-man advantage.' It's just a pity that the Norway goal was disallowed the way it trickled through the goalie's hands would have reminded Mark of 70s North Bank hero Bob Wilson. On a good day, The most impressive attraction of the lot is the roller-coaster. It costs a fortune to put up and run, but if it's a good 'un the punters will flock like sheep in pasture. JULIE Typical woman, Julie. 'When it's finished' was her response when we asked her what she likes best about the World Cup. Frankly. that's not good enough, if only because we have to write the same amount of copy for hers as everyone elses to make it balance out. I mean, what about the things that all girls like about football, such as the big hunky guys showing their muscly legs off in those skimpy shorts? Wait a minute... this bit fits properly now. There, finished. ROKAS A FAIR DAY'S WORK Could you be up there with the big fairgrounds of this world? Follow these simple rules and you should be coining it in within months! PETAEA 'Yeah, the footy's been marvellous, hasn't it!' enthused 'Trea. 'It's quite difficult to get to see the games, but when I do they're a treat. I mean, did you see that one the other day when the forward dribbled the ball nearly forty yards around at least five defenders, then picked the ball up and chucked it to his team-mate, who lobbed it into the net to win 2/13 to 1/9? Ripper!' When we told her we wanted to hear her thoughts on the World Cup and not stupid, crap Aussie Rules Football, she shut up.

"CVG REVIEW SPACED-OUT DUDES GAME GEAR SHOOT.'EM-UP EUNCONFIRMED OUT JULY INES AND MASTER SYSTEM ALSO AVAILABLE INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED DROP ZONE Another blast from the past, this time a convert of the brilliant C64 Defender clone... his game was out 10 years ago on the Commodore 64. Back in the days when graphics really didn't matter too much because the 'gameplay' was what was so phenomenal about the product. Most of you have no doubt played the classic Defender in one form or another, and Drop Zone is an addition to that list. It's a lightning-fast left-and-right scrolling blaster in which your task is to save men from invading aliens and drop them off at the nearest moonbase. A radar at the bottom of the screen plays a tactical part in planning rescue attempts and apart from air-bound aliens there are ground dangers like erupting volcanoes to keep clear of. The appeal of Drop Zone is the way in which the action can switch suddenly from you being in control to everything being out of control: you know something is going to happen, but you never seem to be ready for it. Clever stuff. You can complete a level by rescuing the pods and blasting all the baddies on screen. You get shown the bonuses that you've accrued at the end of game. You should do better than this, since only 100 bonus points is a bit poor! VERDICT ATTACK HAVE COMPLETES BONUS x 211 GAME GEAR Drop Zone has managed to retain the playability which made it such a popular blaster on the Commodore 64. Sure, it's good fun to play, but the problem with playing high-speed games on a small screen is that you have very little time to react to floating bullets, especially when they're just a pixel big! As a result Drop Zone is a difficult game. By design it is also very repetitive, yet it's the sort of low-tech blast-fest that will probably do well on Gear. DENIZ AHMET 1770 OUTO Like Micro Machines, Drop Zone has the facility for two players to play on the same machine. The problem with this game is that the bullets are only a pixel big and they are very difficult to spot on the Game Gear's small screen.

"CVG REVIEW THE NEW CHALLENGERS ISNES AND MEGA DRIVE BEAT-'EM-UP .99 OUT ON IMPORT NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE PC AND 3DO VERSIONS PLANNED SUPER It has arrived. The biggest release of the year. But just how many times does Capcom expect you to pay for the same great game? t took two years for Capcom to develop the Super Street Fighter II coin-op. Recently the comSNES pany churned out the newer Turbo version and naturally TEOSTETO everyone was expecting that to end up on the new cart. Unfortunately, it hasn't; so what's new on these carts is little more than the four new characters. Of course, Street Fighter gurus will find the new combos and strategies that accompany the new challengers ample reason to buy this version. But weary of criticism, Capcom has added two new modes of play to Super, and these are Time Challenge, which gives you the chance to see how quickly you can slaughter an opponent, and Tournament Battle which is a sort of musical chairs with up to eight characters winners fighting winners and losers pitched against losers. Super Street Fighter II shouldn't be considered as a new game because it's really just an upgrade. It's just that it happens to be an upgrade to an awesome game. A Cammy's Cannon Drill is a great way to catch opponents by surprise. Best used as a follow up move in a combo. MEGA DRIVE ISNES Out of the new characters Cammy is probably the strongest thanks to her great special moves like this back breaking throw.

"CVG REVIEW THE NEW CHALLENGERS MEGA DRIVE FKD Zany is AWAWISAN VW SNES VERDICT Although Super Street Fighter II is excellent, we reckon it's only worth buying if you haven't got the original since it's far too expensive, and you tend to only play the original characters anyway. MEGA DRIVE ISNES A Dee Jay's Double Dredd kick produces devastating double hits knocking opponents to the ground. SNES Annoyed that Capcom hasn't converted the TURBO version of SSFII? Me too.  or more for four new characters isn't worth it. I mean do you ever see people playing as the new characters in the arcades? Rarely, because everyone knows Ken is still the best. Still, SSFI is an exceptional conversion and let's not forget that part of the high cost is because this is the biggest SNES game ever at 32 megs.

I SNES MEGA DRIVE The Special Champion Edition on Mega Drive sold poorly compared to the SNES. This means there's probably plenty of MD owners who haven't got a copy. If that's you then this is essential as the graphics and playability are almost identical to the arcade. Despite SSF Il's excellence it's hard to recommend, primarily for its price but also because I've a feeling that we'll see a Turbo version sooner or later.

Yes, the World Cup, tallied with the fact there are more formats than ever means there's a plethora of footy games. Even PC owners are suddenly spoilt for choice, and in the case of Empire Soccer it's actually appeared on the PC before any other planned formats. The problem though, is that every game seems to be emulating a previous release in terms of features offered, and softcos are making brasher claims on the box to the effect of 'more of this' and 'more of that'. So, when you actually get to play these games as often as us you can pick out the problems immediately usually. Empire Soccer was a strange one though, first we hated it, then we liked it, but the more we played it the less we liked it. So just what did we think of it? Read that final verdict...

"MARIO ON THE MEGA DRIVE? REVI CVG MEGA DRIVE RACING GAME .4.99 OUT NOW MARIO ANDRETTI RACING ENO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE ENO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Racing legend Mario Andretti runs out of petrol as he crawls into the Mega Drive garage... BAYSHORE INTERNATIONAL RACEWRY earing in mind that Mario Andretti's Racing is from EA, have you noticed something familiar about the graphic engine? In case not let me tell you that it looks mighty similar to the Road Rash one that's since turned up in Road Rash 2 and more recently Skitchin'. They say first impressions count and I have to say I was disappointed to see this game engine crop up yet again, but maybe this game has some redeeming features? Well, quite neatly there's more than one game on offer here with Indy car, Stock and Sprint (slow buggies on a muddy track) racing all catered for. There's a training feature seen in games like Nigel Mansell where Andretti himself guides you round the track, plenty of different views, including a two-player split screen option and the ability to use slipstreams and more realistic breaking than we've seen in any other race game. Amazingly enough Mario  Andretti racing is a 16 meg racing game. Plenty of memory must have been used up on these grainy pitstop sequences because the in-game graphics are very weak.

The graphics are some of the worst I've ever seen on Mega Drive and I reckon they'd even feel embarassed on Master System. Sound couldn't be much worse either. And gameplay sucks, with no feeling of speed, control or the sensation of driving a real car. Looks like another case of all the money being spent on the licence instead of the gameplay. RIK SKEWS Like the Nigel Mansell game, Mario Andretti's Racing features a tutorial from the man himself.

ETECTED hen you sit down to play this you can't help but think that if only Sega had got its act together and produced games of this quality early on in the Mega-CD's life, things would be very different now. Instead they've had to rely on thirdparty developers such as Core to deliver the goods aeons too late. Battlecorps is based on an improved version of the one that powered Core's other Mega-CD hit, Thunderhawk. This time, though, you're at the controls of flippin' massive Battletech-style robot death machines tramping through various post holocausttype landscapes. No puzzles, no brainwork. Just you, 200 tons of extreme hardness and plenty of things to kill. Bliss. Even better news about this game is that rumour has it Core is producing a version for the Mega-32, which will really be something special. VERDICT SHIELD You play one of three 'Gun-jocks'. Yes, it sounds crap, but you don't play games like this for the story, you play them to kill things. MEGA -CD Core has once more proved itself as the top Mega-CD developer. I know it sounds like I'm crawling but I don't care because this is great. Technically and from a gameplay point of view. Different tactics can be applied, or you can just wade in and stamp on everything. The control system is over complicated, which severely messes you up if you panic. But aside from that I don't see a better Mega-CD release on the horizon. MARK PATTERSON A Battlecorps lacks one essential ingredient, people to squash. It's not fair, really, you've got this massive robot and nothing too squishey to stamp on. BIDNECH SC UN SHOE Until you get used to the controls Battlecorps is not an easy game to play.

Surprise surprise, the speed of the ball is determined by a frantic buttonhammering session. o it seems we're not rubbish at cricket after all. Mind you, that's easy to say when we're playing sad sides like New Zealand. But even so, you can't knock Graham Gooch's terrific doublecentury in the First Test, only the second time he's achieved such a feat. And you can't knock Audiogenic either, for dusting down its Goochie licence, giving it a coat of paint and shoving it out on PC.

And as for the aim of the game? Stripping away the gobbledigook like Silly MidOff (what does that mean?), you've got to score loads of runs with your bat, then try to bowl the other side out before they amass a better score than you.

A You start the game with no items and a rather modest mace as your weapon. From here you have to rely on your skill and cunning, well, your jumping ability to survive. Not satisfied with being on virtually every machine, Sensi gets too greedy... he appearence of this game begs one important question if you've got the cartridge version, is this worth buying? Like many CD conversions this is nothing more than a repackaged version of the original with a few new sound effects. Being fair to the programmers, there wasn't much they could add to such an excellent game. This raises another question. Why bother producing this when So, should Sensi novices pick up a cart, or come up to date with CD? Scoot to the verdict to find out. lippin' hell, this is the computer game equivalent of digging out an old pair of DM's and finding three year-old dog dump festering in the soles. It's as equally unexpected and unwelcome. The original Mega Drive cartridge version of the game wasn't a total disaster, although it came pretty close. Somehow, though, they've made the CD version even worse. Included now is a full load of CD speech, which is badly acted and, horror, you can't interrupt it. This means before you kill a key character you're forced to listen to their monologue first. On top of that, the text still comes up on screen, so you can read it before the Mega-CD's even had a chance to access the relevant sound file. You're left with no option other than to switch it off. Doh! The graphics may be puny, but the gameplay is headand-shoulders over almost every other footy game. A Almost no one in the game is pleased to see you. They demonstrate this by hitting you with whatever objects come to hand. GOAL! VERDICT VERDICT The Mega-CD version retains the Mega Drive's playability except when the game pauses to access the CD. MEGA-CD The key issue here is not what's made the game so bad, but that this was a tragic game in the first place. If it was a car it'd have three wheels and fluffy dice. There are some well worked puzzles, but that doesn't justify this game's existence; the combination of adventure and action isn't balanced and the result is tedious. MARK PATTERSON MEGA-CD Apart from new sound effects, Sensi CD offers nothing new. In fact, it's worse than the cart the game freezes momentarily when you score a goal as it loads in the appropriate sample, and saving out custom teams takes up precious space on the Mega-CD's battery. Sensible's a great game, but you're better off with the cartridge version. MARK PATTERSON Customisation of teams is limited by the amount of free space on the MegaCD's battery RAM chip.

It can only mean one thing PIZZA! Yep, Litil Divil is your pizza delivery boy, and although he doesn't ride a crumbly old moped, he'd be better off if he did because by the time he reaches this pizza it'll probably be cold. In the pits of hell, Mutt the Divil is sent to collect pizza, a task so perilous that he's likely to visit the toilet a couple of times before he gets to eat. A Labyrinth of traps and secret rooms looms before him, dropping Mutt into the sort of 'reaction' puzzles made famous by the Dragon's Lair games. But that's only part of this game; for the large part it's about collecting goodies and discovering their uses elsewhere. Systematic adventure is what you get here (A + B = C sort of stuff) and to help it along there is loads of devilish humour. A There are lots of stages which involve finding the correct movement path across risky platforms; unfortunately it's the same paths each time you play. VERDICT A One of the more frustrating bits in the game. Having collected the key you have to guess where platforms will appear and jump across to the door. PC-CD ROM On the one hand Litil Divil is a large, challenging game, blending a few styles of gameplay with funny graphics; but on the other it never seems to evolve into anything that you haven't seen in the first half-hour of play. The tunnel sections don't give you enough reaction time and rely on you having a good memory. As for the puzzles, they hold no lasting challenge once you've sussed the correct combinations. Few addictive qualities in gameplay, but it will make you laugh. DENIZ AHMET A This dragon will need to be taught not to make so much noise when he sleeps.

This is actually the third Ranma game taken from the nutty cartoon series and features the most diverse and unlikely cast of superheroes yet assembled in a fisticuff type of game. In case you know zilch about the cartoon, Ranma is the main character who turns into a girl whenever he gets wet, and whose dad is actually a fat Panda bear. Ranma tends to battle with cheerleader-type girls with silly names like Shampoo, and when there is a bloke to bash they tend to suddenly turn into a pig or some other animal. We'd say problems like that are good enough reasons to start a fight and that's all this game is about really. Each character has at least two special moves, which are actually too effective when used in the corner. Victory is almost guaranteed on easier levels. VERDICT O gobe.. SNES The biggest thing this game has going for it is the graphics the animation and detail is amazing. and there are plenty of special moves, as well as a load of opponents. Is it any good though? Well it's not bad, but the special moves tend to be far too effective, tempting you not to bother with anything else, and there's no combination moves either. I completed the game on my first go, using Ranma's special moves to trap opponents in the corner the oldest trick in the book! DENIZ AHMET A Holding the 'L' button starts a bizarre animation on your character. If you can avoid getting hit while this is happening your sprite will temporarily become much stronger when the energy bar flashes. Opponents do this too. A This is the boss-type character which appears after the other Ranma characters have been defeated. He's not very hard at all.

"CVG REVIEW .DRINK IT IN THE KONGO DONKEY SUPER GAME BOY PLATFORM UNCONFIRMED INO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Nothing like a splash of colour to brighten up an old Game (Boy). Take a trip down Memory Platform... DANKST LONG intendo's Super Game Boy adaptor for the SNES certainly scores novelty points wise: slot it in your SNES and you can plug in any Game Boy game to play on your TV. But it doesn't end there; by some miracle you can actually add colour to your GB games. Big deal eh? Well, actually it is because there are now specific colour GB titles appearing which work normally on a standard Game Boy but when played through the adaptor appear in glorious colour with sampled speech too. Donkey Kong '94 is the first of these games and features Mario out to save his girl from the giant gorilla. Each rescue attempt presents numerous levels of Mario-style platform action and the boss stages take inspiration from the Donkey Kong coinop. And if simplicity breeds addiction then this game dribbles with the stuff. By pushing down and jumping Mario does a handstand. Jump again and he does a super high jump. Also, as shown here, the handstand move enables Mario to avoid bullets. On later stages there's a lot of complex work to be done; you have to pull levers back and forth to change the direction of lifts which in turn activates new platforms. ACA VERDICT SCUDUD-200 x DO A In the jungle there's a lot of climbing to be done on the vines and on the tails of strolling apes. The quickest way to climb is by hanging between two vines. On the platforms you have to find the key and take it to the door. Problem is you can't climb while holding the key, so you have to throw it, climb down and pick it back up before it disappears. SUPER GAME BOY When I heard about the Super Game Boy adaptor It seemed a stupid idea, but if Donkey Kong is indicative of the games we can expect then I'm impressed. This game merges Mario's platform games with the nostalgia of Donkey Kong, resulting in awesome playability. The platform puzzles you face are well thought out and are clever and challenging. There's plenty of variation in gameplay, with stacks of levels too, Donkey Kong '94 is the best Game Boy game ever.

"REVIEWS CVG So crammed pack full of games, features, reviews and the like is CVG that there just isn't the space to tell you about every new game this month in full; so here's some super short reviews of games coming to your system this month... GRAPHICS SOUND PLAYABILITY OVERALL BENEFACTOR AMIGA :Not exactly the height of sophistication. The main sprite is awful and the backgrouds look rather dated. Average is being a little bit kind when applied to the blandness inherent in the sonics here. Takes a little while to get into, but once you do you'll have great fun. A nice mix of arcade and strategy. Frustrating, but if you like a bit of joystick frippery to go with your puzzling this should suit you. U RULLE RATING:81% BUMP 'N' BURN AMIGA Detailed sprites and smooth scrolling. The backdrops could be better. Different sounds for every character in the game add pleny of variety to the accompanying aural assault. Instinctive and responsive controls plus plenty of depth as well as the various power-ups and original courses. Much like Super Mario Kart, which is no bad thing. One for the less serious racing fans. RATING:85% CLIFFHANGER AMIGA Completely crap. Tiny iffy sprites a C64 would be ashamed of and terrible animation. Cover your ears! Verrily the sound of this game doth scrape the lugs like one of them cheese graters. Blimey, not only is the control method utterly useless, but the game design is stupendously flawed. If you released this as a PD title you would immediately lose any credibility whatsoever. RATING:16% SUPER SHORTS NAUGHTY ONES CD32 A pleasant looking game. In fact, it looks more like a SNES game than anything. Naughty Ones has what ranks as the absolutely worst soundtrack you wil ever suffer. Believe us. Smooth moving, with an impressive number of levels. The controls spoil the fluidity of the gameplay. Good fun if you can get used to the joypad controls but you'll find that hard going. RATING:72% SIERRA SOCCER AMIGA The players move fluidly, and some nice cut screens add to the atmosphere. A bit on the average side. This is, after all, a footie game, a genre not generally famed for ace sound. Fast paced and rather Sensi-like in its entirety. Very easy to get into indeed... Playable and most enjoyable. It is, however, rather on the easy side for single players. RATING:58% Fonians 1:0 Ron Ireland U 15 KUUD U Detailed, colourful, well-animated and exactly the same as the regular Amiga version. Jolly, bouncy tunes, plenty of good effects and sounds identical to the regular Amiga version, once again. A wide range of puzzles and a lot of good new ideas. However, the control system is rather finnicky. Worth a look if you want a challenging puzzle platformer, but has frustrating controls. RATING:83% CD32 SWITCHQUIZ SUPER PUTTY AMIGA SWITCHQUIZ Very very basic indeed. Just a number of boxes containg a little text. Rather short on colour, too. If you thought football games were bad for sound, you've obviously never played a trivia game in your life. Good enough selection of questions, although some of them are rather on the impossible side. Great for passing some time with a couple of mates, but not a majorly exciting product. RATING:68% SETTLERS Probably the best going among the God-games. A high level of detail abounds all over the shop. Not bad, not bad. Not particularly incredible either, by any means, but not all that bad. PC There's absolutely loads to do, it takes a while to get into the swing of things, but once you do you'll be engrossed.

And talking of Philips, the peeps behind the CD-i have just released a new PC tennis sim. Now we won't insult you by telling you what you have to do here this is just tennis after all but we can't resist quoting a line from the game's manual which reads: 'The object of the game is to get the ball over the net..' Really? Anyway, this is actually a serious attempt at simulating the sport, providing you with digitised graphics, international courts, training options and all the standard playing surfaces of grass, clay and cement. While it supports two players it doesn't offer doubles, but the whole point of it being on CD is that you get genuine commentary from over 1,000 phrases giving you tips while you play. So is it any good? Let's see... A There are two options for training available. You can challenge the ball machine shown here, or practice serving. VERDICT INFOGRAM NESSERAMES PC-CD ROM This is a decent tennis game for the PC; you've got all the moves available for strategic play, but the combination of joystick and keyboard to use them is too awkward to be comfortable. In one player mode it's very sensible in that it always gives you control of the nearest player when you change sides, but in two player matches the opponent has a hard time returning shots. All in all it's a very believable tennis game, but a somewhat poor use of CD-ROM. DENIZ AHMET TENNIS OPEN Unlike other games you can't dive for the ball if you think you're about to miss it. So it's not all that realistic after all. You only get four players to select from in this tennis game. Clicking on the faces plays an FMV sequence of them in action with commentary. 88 GRAPHICS 83 SOUND PLAYABILITY 74 VALUE 69 You can select to play on clay, grass or cement surfaces.

"CVG REVIEW BALLS TO YOU ISNES SPORTS .99 CVGSMASH TENNIS OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Skip the strawberries and cream and head for the beach for a smasher of a game of tennis... mash Tennis has been available for a while on import under the name of Super Family Tennis. As its import name suggests, this game is best appreciated with more than one player and multitap support makes sure of that. The first thing you'll notice about the game is the diversity of the playing courts. They range from beachside to clifftop, and they're full of intricate graphical touches which complement the cheerfulness of the cutesie graphics; for instance as the sun comes out, nearby trees gradually cast shadows over the court. Additionally, on some courts you can scroll the screen far enough to see people playing on adjacent patches, or even hit passing animals with the ball. As for the gameplay, well it does the job, delivering an accurate representation of the sport, even with a limited range of moves. Normally you select which court to play on and stick to it. If you select the Whistle stop option however, you get to do a tour of all the courts. VERDICT Each court has funny animated scenes around the edges. The Shrine court shown here has the best touches; the ball can drop into little pools, you can scare sleeping crows who flap across the screen, and if you blast the ball into the temple small creatures scurry out in fear. SNES Smash Tennis is a fine game. The cute approach sets it apart, as does the illusion of a large play area; though there aren't enough different shots to cover the whole court, unless you're playing it as a multitap game which is the better option. What's so good, though, is the way opponents respond to your improving skills, giving the game heaps of lastability. The control system is responsive enough to ensure that if you miss a shot it's your fault. DENIZ AHMET This is the only indoor court in the game. We thought we'd print it because the sound effects are very good with lots of echo and reverb. If you think you're about to miss a shot it's worth tapping the hit button a couple of times, which makes you dive for the ball. Serving takes a bit of getting used to, like all tennis games.

Tott'nam are a load of...! Considering Audiogenic had to shell out for the licence, the Wembley connection is really sparse. You'd at least expect a '66 World Cup option. o, really, it's true, this is a licence of a stadium. I don't have much truck with Wembley stadium itself, especially having missed the start of the England Denmark game earlier in the year after spending 20 minutes on the stairs, thanks to the crap stewards herding everyone towards the same seats. Apart from the logo, the only thing this game has in common with Wembley is football. In this case, though, it's without the drama. When you cast your mind back to Charlie Nicholas smashing two goals past Liverpool for Arsenal in a cup final, or Andy Linighan and his broken nose giving us a winner against Wednesday, then play this, something, somewhere, has gone very wrong. 1-0 To The Arsenal! As is the norm with most modern footy games, the defending team for a wall for free kicks, which you invariably kick the ball over. RPEE COLA SCI WEMBLEYI VERDICT ECD32/AMIGA 1200 I love football me. I can't even begin to calculate the amount of money I've shelled out to watch Arsenal FC. So when I get a game like this which costs almost as much as two tickets for the North Bank, I can't help but think that the people who programmed it haven't been to that many games. It's unrealistic lacks speed, effective controls, polish and fun. Take your money, buy a ball and go for a knockabout in the park with your mates instead. MARK PATTERSON 3 WARRIBE And we hate Tott'nam! A clever picture-in-picture system shows you close-ups of the action, although you don't always have time to pay it any attention. Goonaaahs!

"CVG REVIEW RIGHT IN THE GUTS! BODY BLOWS AGA A1200 BEAT-'EM-UP .99 OUT NOW AMIGA VERSION ALSO AVAILABLE INO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED The champion of Amiga beat-'em-ups gets a facelift from those programmers extraordinaire, Team 17... ntil Body Blows came along there were few decent beat-'em-ups on Amiga. And on CD32 it was a similar situation until Ultimate Body Blows arrived. Meanwhile, the A1200 had Body Blows Galactic, a fine game although it was criticised for being too slow. So what exactly can AGA Body Blows offer that's not been seen in one of the previous Team 17 products? For a start the price. AGA Body Blows is only .99 and just .99 if you send your original disks back to Team 17. As a game it slots in somewhere between the original Body Blows and Ultimate Body Blows. All the original characters are present apart from Max and the turbo and tournament options from Ultimate have been included. VERDICT Like Ultimate Body Blows on CD32 there's now a tag and tournament option to play.  SELECT  PLASERS A1200 AGA Body Blows is what a beat-'em-up should look, sound and play like. Although the graphics are not as good as Elfmania's, at everything else it excels. It plays like a beat-'em-up with loads of moves which are easy to pull off. And bone crunching sound FX only add to the realism. It's also tremendous fun, especially when you play with bizarre characters like Loray. Previously said Ultimate Body Blows was the best Amiga beat'em-up. Now this one is. RIK SKEWS ETTU NIH A There's plenty of special moves on offer with Loray having more than his fair share of the good ones. 23 Mmm, smell those graphics, or something. They're good, but not in the same league as Elfmania's. A mercy option has been included and this lets you choose whether you hit people or not when they've been knocked down. GRAPHICS 90 SOUND 87 PLAYABILITY 88 VALUE 94 OVERALL ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE Streetfighter II Special Capcom/.99 Yawn! What more can we say? Probably the best beat'em-up ever thanks to brilliant control, moves and that classic gameplay. ISSUE 144: 94% Speed rush! If you already thought Body Blows Galactic crawled, you won't believe how slow it seems after playing AGA Body Blows on the fastest turbo option. Yitu is one of the best characters to pick if you're a beginner, he's just so fast. Just pray you don't come up against him until you've had some practice! A As always in Team 17 games the music is good, but it's not a patch on the soundtracks and FX in Ultimate Body Blows. 88 GAME BY TEAM 17 CONTACT TEAM 17 (0924 201846) FOR MORE INFORMATION 26 "

"CVG REVIEW A BLAST FROM THE PAST IA1200 SHOOT-'EM-UP .99 OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE CD32 VERSION PLANNED BANSHEE It's time to don your goggles and Biggles leather jacket, because Core's latest game has landed! round the mid Eighties you couldn't move in your local arcade for vertically scrolling shoot-'em-ups based on creaky World War II fighter planes: 1942, 1943, Tiger Shark to name but three. The format was done to death, both in the arcades and on home machines and eventually the general public decided it was all a bit passe. As you may have noticed there's something of a retro games revival at the moment with people snapping up Tiger Shark PCB's for example. What better time, then for Core to fly into the market with its own interpretation of the genre, complete with four huge main levels and two equally large sub-levels? And as this is AGA-only expect fast and simultaneous two-player action, 256 colour graphics and realistic sound FX as well as classic gameplay. Level three starts with you flying above arctic waste. Shoot the igloos to make them explode! VERDICT SHIELD A Some of the 'dodgy' scenes may not make it into the boxed game. These include being able to shoot prams, polar bears and graves as shown here. CDON LOOP 3 A1200 Core has taken a classic arcade shoot-'em-up and given it a Nineties sheen. If I was a cynical old hack I'd say Banshee offers nothing new, but I'm not and the game plays so well I just don't care. There might only be four levels, but they're huge and the two player option is a gas, Solastability shouldn't be a problem. The only criticism is it's on four disks, but as it stands Banshee is the best shoot-'em-up on Amiga since Project X. RIK SKEWS The first boss you will encounter in this game is not one, but two huge planes. Don't get cocky. though, this is just the mid-level boss. Wait till you see the endof-level mutha. A Check out those lovely 256 colour backgrounds. That's the benefit of being able to develop on A1200 and CD32 first. Be sure to pick up the power-ups so that you can get rid of those end-oflevel gits You get a limited amount of rolls. Use these to get out of a dangerous situation. You might end up killing yourself though, since the rolls are activated by the spacebar and it's a bit difficult trying to press it and play the game! ASHIELD 85 GRAPHICS 86 SOUND PLAYABILITY 87 VALUE ALTERNATIVE 84 000000 OVERALL LIUES Two-player option ahoy! Just like the arcade classic, Banshee can be flown by two players simultaneously. There's no fighting over power-ups though, you each get given your own. SNES R-Type 3 Irem/.99 One of the classic shoot'em-ups of all time, this third incarnation on SNES IS arguably the best yet.

OUT NOW ON CD OUT NOW ON CARTRIDGE You've been umming and ahh-ing over that new cart; now's the time to spend your cash, and here's the ones to choose... ANOTHER WORLD / 3DO / INTERPLAY PRICE: .99 We reckon this is the best 3D0 game we've seen so far. Interplay has stuck to the original structure of the other versions, but added new backdrops. If you've played this on any other format, you'll be disappointed, but otherwise this is a disc you should have. Issue 152: 90% SUPER METROID / SNES / NINTENDO PRICE: .99 Out officially on the 22 July, complete with a free 72-page players' guide which you don't get with the import game. It's  cheaper, too. Issue 152: 91% FIRST OF MY EASY BUIKER SHOT. JUST HIT THE BALL OUT OF THE SAND NICK FALDO'S CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF / CD32 / GRANDSLAM PRICE: .99 Taking the crown for the best CD32 golf game because it's the only one, it's just as well that this is actually quite good. As you'd expect from being on CD, the game features loads of digitised graphics and sound effects, which add massively to the gameplay. Great stuff. Issue 151: 80% STREETS OF RAGE 3 / MEGA DRIVE / SEGA PRICE: .99 SOR 3 has taken the series to exploding point. Another would be the ultimate in overkill. As it is though, this is the best. Issue 152: 82% ZOOL 2 / CD32 / GREMLIN PRICE: $29.99 Even CD is no refuge from Gremlin's ninja ant, Zool. His latest appearance brings his unique brand of platform gaming to CD32. This version features a recorded soundtrack as well as the obligatory FMV intro. It's an essential purchase for platform game fans. Issue 152: 85% SAM & MAX HIT THE ROAD / PC CD-ROM / LUCASARTS PRICE: .99 The floppy disk version of this game is one of the finest adventures to surface in recent months, and now we've got the CD version which is even better. The game itself is exactly the same, but it now features recorded speech which adds so much to the game it makes it the essential CD adventure purchase. Issue 152: 84% DRAGON / SNES / VIRGIN PRICE: .99 A good battler, based on the movie a fact that's rammed home with plenty of cut scenes. Still, it's fast, playable and if you have a multi-tap, you can play three players at once. Issue 152: 84% SEIRD CREEPY BUBBLE AND SQUEAK / CD32 / AUDIOGENIC PRICE: .99 Here's a nice change; a game that's not a port, but actually developed solely for CD32. Admittedly it is a platform game, and not a mould-breaking one at that, but it still represents excellent action in 256-colours. And it's cheaper that your average CD32 game. Issue 151: 84% PETE SAMPRAS TENNIS / MEGA DRIVE / CODEMASTERS PRICE: .99 The cart comes with two joypad sockets built in, so up to four people can compete at once in what is a rather decent spot of oncourt action. Issue 151: 84% AVOID And here's the one that should stay on the shelves... Keep away! Keep away! Keep away! ULTRAMAN / 3DO / BANDAI PRICE: .00 This game has almost all the right ingredients for success flashy sound and visuals, quality presentation and loads of FMV. What it doesn't feature is a great amount of playability, which scuppers it completely. Impressive to look at, but not worth the money. Issue 152: 42% PACMAN / NES / NINTENDO PRICE: .99 A perfect conversion of an amazingly old game. Which is a shame since it's only playable for about five minutes. Your money would be better spent on something more 1990s than 1890s. Issue 152: 46% 99 "


"CVG REVIEW MUSCLE IN ON THE ACTION SNES WRESTLING GAME .00 + OUT ON IMPORT FM MARTY AND COIN.OP VERSIONS ALSO AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED MUSCLE BOMBER 24-Meg heavyweight action comes to the SNES courtesy of Capcom's fourplayer coin-op... he best move in wrestling has to be the \"whoopie cushion' where you leap and sit on someone's head Pooo! We couldn't find that move in this game but there are stacks of others to get to grips with, and a veritable number of grips, slams, grapples and falls come from a formidable 10 characters who you are required to defeat. You yourself can be one of eight of these 'actors' for one-onone action, or just slot in multitap for a four-up tag. team razzmatazz. While Muscle Bomber only makes use of three of the SNES buttons, a combination of repeated tapping, and simultaneous pressing of two but tons, launches characters into an aggressive special move. But, as your opponents get more aggressive the better you start to play; there's none of that onemove cheesy stuff which lets you always win on some lesser games. Tapping the punch button repeatedly usually starts off a dramatic combination move. Just what is that camera man filming looks a bit rude to us. After bouncing your opponent of the ringside why not stick your arm out and take them down! There are many ways to bring an opponent down. You determine the moves performed as you grab the victim. The big chaps tend to be better at close-range attack. This bear hug looks particularly painful. No, he's not trying on a new hat, just smashing this bloke's head in There's some fancy leg work going on here. This chap does his best to disorientate the baddie. Your opponent is likely to escape from this fall because he has a lot of energy left.

"MUSCLE IN ON THE ACTION REVIEW CVG SECOND OPINION The best thing about this game is the variety of moves available, and the way in which you can string together some very good combination attacks. The opponents have a very good level of intelligence coded into them too which means that you have to learn genuine skills to defeat them. The best way to enjoy this however, is in 4-up mode where there's no slowdown and you can work as a team. just like the real (or should that be unreal') sport. It's a toughie that's for sure. GARY LORD You always fight in the same ring unfortunately, but you can leap out and hit opponents with chairs and stuff if you want. VERDICT A You don't get any extra points for knocking him out. Unfortunately. SNES Unlike the WWF games this game acts as more of a wrestling sim, with the characters each having distinctive characteristics, a separate mastery of moves (like Streetfighter) and a control system which isn't just about tapping keys and hoping for the best. You can actually do combos here, finishing off opponents with a special move. Naturally. this game excels with four players and without slowdown too it is dangerously addictive.

"CVG REVIEW HAUZEL  HEN 13DO ADVENTURE -70 OUT ON IMPORT NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Who's in the Hauz? Well it's Dr Hauzer, the 3DO's latest hero trapped in a computerised Amityville... DR HAUZER here was much scratching of chins when we first saw the ad for this game, which is pretty understandable when you think that this is the most blatant bit of plagiarism we've seen in a long time. Basically, all programmers seem to have done is parked themselves in front of a PC, played Alone In The Dark for a couple of hours, and decided it would make a rather decent 3D0 game. They were almost right. Alone In The Dark would make an extremely good 3D0 game done properly, that is. What the programmers have actually created, however, is a rather miserable copy of that game. It uses the same style of polygon graphics, with the addition of a few bits of texture mapping, the same camera angles and the same kind of puzzles. They've also added a new element slowness. Hauzer is incredibly sluggish. Avoiding the axes is tricky when you're controlling a character who only seems to respond to the joypad when he feels like it. VERDICT In true Indiana Jonesstyle Hauzer sprints away from a rolling, erm, thing. Really, you'd have thought that the programmers could at least draw circles. 3DO Been there, seen it, played it, beat it, and not playing it tomorrow. This is Alone In The Dark all over again without the speed or gameplay. Hauzer is ridiculously slow, which slaughters the gameplay. The firstperson perspective mode is unusable and even when there's nothing moving the game isn't that good to look at. There aren't enough problems to make it an adventure and there's not enough action to make it an arcade game. MARK PATTERSON A If Indiana Jones was born in this country he'd be born in this country, this is the kind of sad hero he'd be. Hmm, a fiendish trap. The room rapidly fills with water threatening to drown Hauzer oh no! Well, it would be quite fiendish if you couldn't just open the door and walk out.

"CVG REVIEW PLEASE FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS ISNES RACING ETBA OUT AUTUMN NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED After looking both ways before crossing, CVG steps out to find Nintendo's new Super FX game anything but middle-of-the-road... magine yourself sitting in a radio-controlled car with a small child at the controls. The child makes the car crash, spin, leap and roll-over because it's fun. Now picture yourself sitting down to play Stunt Race FX: you select the Speed Trax option and pull off on the first of 15 courses. Suddenly, a car hits you from behind forcing you to go faster, you see another car but you don't drive safely by, instead opting to bash into it, spin off on the adjacent corner, roll-over and carry on. Why? Well because it's fun and you can, just like the child with his toy. So, you hopefully get an image of the freedom, excitement, curiosity and risk elements which form the appeal of this game. Sure it's about reflexes and winning, but it's more to do with having the most wacky race possible. With its obligatory split-screen mode plus an additional five courses of Monster Truck-type stunts you may, like us, have suddenly realised that Stunt Race FX may be the illegitimate sequel that was never promised to Mario Kart junkies. STUNT RACE EX The 4WD truck has no problem getting through water, but with the smaller cars you'll need to use you the booster. You have a limited supply of turbo (booster) so ensure you pick up these blue gems to top up your power. 13: 12 WACKY RACES Join me for a ride, maximum overdrive.' There are a total of five vehicles to master in this game, across 24 different tracks. Here's our guide to their pros and cons. 4WD is ideal for beginners and essential on the Stunt courses. He doesn't skid around a lot and offers good grip on different surfaces. He's fast at acceleration but rather slow at turning. Coupe is a good allrounder, and his benefits are tight steering and high speed. His boost supply also lasts longer than the other vehicles. Select this if high-speed and stability is your thing. F-Type is for those who've mastered the controls. His acceleration is slow but his top speed is the greatest. This car has a weak body, so you'll need to balance him out during jumps and avoid frequent crashes.  2WD is only available on Free Trax until you clear the Master Class tracks. He's fast and is tricky to control. If you lose control it's hard to recover without wasting valuable time. Good for setting speed records. The Trailer is only available in the bonus game. The viewing perspective is different in the bonus game so controlling him can get very confusing. Go slowly. GAME BY NINTENDO CONTACT NINTENDO (0703 618382) FOR INFORMATION 84 "

The graphics are cartoonish and they also don't build up in blocks on the horizon. There's stacks of variety in gameplay and it shifts like a proper race game with challenging opponents. Stunt Race FX is the most creative racing game to date. DENZATVET SNES games have generally been poor this year with only NBA JAM standing out. And now Stunt Race FX. Graphically and sonically this trounces Virtua Racing and in one player mode it matches it for speed. It's also a damn sight more fun to play. Sadly the two-player mode is a little disappointing since it's quite slow and has a small game window.

"CVG REVIEW BARGAIN BASEMENT CHEAPOS PDGAMES Bargain hunters will be pleased to hear that you don't have to spend wads of cash for some decent games... DEMOPLAY 108 2069 712 ARCHER MACLEAN'S POOL PC/AMIGA / HIT SQUAD PRICE: .99 The only criticism anyone had of Jimmy White's Snooker was that snooker is, well, not exactly a fast game. Paying attention to this, programmer Archer Maclean adapted it and produced Archer's Pool, which is as close as you can get to the real thing without getting skinned for all your money. 91% Cheap doesn't have to mean nasty, just check out the latest PD releases... HOCUS POCUS / PC From Apogee, the creators of Halloween Harry, comes another arcade-type PD disk. Hocus Pocus uses the same 256-colour engine, although it's not quite up to Halloween's standards thanks to a couple of annoying gameplay faults. Still, this is a solid platformer which makes a decent change from more heavyweight full price releases. 73% TEST DRIVE III PC / HIT SQUAD PRICE: .99 Accolade finally came up trumps with the third game in the Test Drive series at a price. While the gameplay's better, this version features fewer cars and tracks than the previous two. Still, it's fast and very realistic, so give it a, erm, test drive. 81% ROB'S GAMES / AMIGA 17-Bit / Disk 3039 Who is Rob? Do we care? Not really when we get a disk this good. It features five games, the best being Thrust, Dynamite an excellent Bomberman clone and Scorched Tanks, a battle tanks rip-off. Altogether this is one of the best games packs we've seen this year. 93% KINGS QUEST 3 AMIGA / KIXX XL PRICE: .99 OK, so this game's old and it looks it, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Honest. It looks crap but this is actually a decent adventure, packed with puzzles, well structured and punctuated with bouts of groan-worthy jokes. Hey, if you like it there's another three after it (but not out on budget yet). 77% ASTROFIRE / PC While Amiga owners rant on about Stardust, PC owners can now get their hands on a shareware game which is more than a tad similar. Basically Astrofire uses the same Asteroids-style format combined with 256-colour graphics. It lacks Stardust's 3D section, but it's very playable all the same. 83% ROAD RASH AMIGA / HIT SQUAD PRICE: .99 EA's Amiga conversion of its Mega Drive hit remained faithful to the original, although it never really had the same level of gameplay. Still, if you don't have access to a Mega Drive, this is a decent enough substitute. 78% EPIC PINBALL / PC If you've come across our review of Pinball Fantasies you'll no doubt realise it has more than a couple of faults. This game, however, is actually slightly better, and it's only a couple of quid. 89% BIK 400 24 OK. So it may be going cheap, but even if this was the last piece of software on Earth (or any other planet) we'd still say 'Don't bother'. Even for sweet FA, some games just aren't worth bothering with... LEISURE SUIT LARRY 3 KIXX XL PRICE: .99 This game appeared around the same time as Kings Quest 3, but it doesn't even begin to approach being as good as it. Like KQ3 it's a graphic adventure, although 'adventure' is used in the loosest sense of the word.

"IT'S QUITE GOOD, MAN! REVIEW CVG GAME BOY MEGAMAN HPLATFORM .99 OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE ANO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED Long before the days of Streetfighter, Mega Man was Capcom's flagship character; is it time for retirement or what? ega Man's big in the videogame world, but a lot of gamers haven't heard of him because he's spent an awful lot of his life leaping and blasting around on the 8bit machines. Now he's back in his third Game Boy game, battling against the evil Doctor Wily. To give Dr Wily a good slapping Mega Man will have to battle his way past eight of his previous enemies, like Skull Man and Gemini Man. Once this lot have been dispensed with it's time for the ultimate confrontation with old Wily himself. Of course there's all the usual power-ups to help you on your journey, but be warned, the levels are gargantuan and there's a distinct lack of extra lives to pick up Don't be deceived. Although the levels start off very easy, it's not long before they become mindnumbingly difficult. VERDICT Get under narrow sections by having a good old slide. Watch out for carpet burns though! You can always rely on Mega Man games to have decent backgrounds and guess what? Mega Man doesn't disappoint. GAME BOY Mega Man 3 is characteristically unoriginal and tough. In some cases being a dab hand with the joypad doesn't matter since there's a host of traps that are impossible to avoid. Also, there are no restart points on each level, which is one of my pet hates. Still, graphics and sound are good and if you're sick of easy platformers this is one for you. Just keep an ambient album nearby to reduce those stress levels! | RIK SKEWS PRESS A BUTTON GRAPHICS 80 SOUND 86 PLAYABILITY 78 I VALUE 76 OVERALL ALTERNATIVE SNES Megaman X Capcom/ Megaman X plays along similar lines to Megaman 3 but it's a better game thanks to it being easy and having restart points.

"CVG REVIEW CHARLIE DON'T SURF CD32 SIMULATION I.99 OUT NOW AMIGA AND PC VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED GUNSHIP 2000 The Americans have got it wrong concentrating on stealth technology what they need are some loud scary 'copters like these. It's a macho thing... Getting the helicopter off the ground is a hell of a lot easier than, say, getting a VW Beetle started on a cold day. Simply push up on the joypad and hit the yellow button to power-up. From then on your only worry is crashing into a mountain or taking a missile up the jacksy. ebels, insurgents, 'freedom fighters'. Scum more like. Planting their bombs, kidnapping honest journos, growing beards and living in forests who needs them? Not MicroProse at any rate; the latest incarnation of their classic flight sim Gunship puts you right in the middle of them from the safe position of behind the controls of a large, well-armed assault helicopter. As you wipe out opposing forces you rise in rank, which lets you pilot even larger 'copters on even more dangerous missions. The objectives don't change, though. It's still applying the American method for dealing with people you don't like which mainly involves bombarding them with missiles. But who cares when it's as fun as this. Like most modern flight sims, the action can be viewed from almost every position. The different views look good, but serve no purpose. Quelle surprise! The game has an FMV intro! We've never seen one of those before. SURPRISE! YOU'RE DEAD! Sitting behind you in the cockpit is your invisible co-pilot who controls the counter measures and never seems to be around when it's time to get the beers in. So what does it take to be an ace helicopter pilot? Not much, really. Take a look at a typical mission. 1. When you've been given your mission you can back out like a coward or take it like a man without blubbing. 2. Now you know what you're up against you can select the right 'copter for the job, along with a battery of missiles, of course. 3. Once you're airborne check the map to find out where your primary target is. This time it's an armoured platoon you're after. If the game isn't fast enough, there are options to reduce the detail level of the graphics, which speeds things up considerably. THE O PTRER ET RIE 90 GAME BY MICROPROSE (0666 504326).  ORIGINAL GUNSHIP PROGRAMMED BY SID MEIER, WHO ALSO WROTE THE STUPENDOUS RAILROAD TYCOON AND THE GROUNDBREAKING CIVILISATION "


"CHARLIE DON'T SURF REVIEW CVG SECOND OPINION With titles like Gunship 2000 the CD32 is really starting to show its prowess. Everything about this game reeks of quality. From the beautiful packaging to the gorgeous rendered intro, from the 256-colour graphics, fantastic CD sound and music, to the faster and smoother update. Even the many keyboard controls have been expertly implemented on to the CD32 joypad. With a wealth of missions and top notch control, Gunship 2000 is up there with TFX as the best flight sim around. RIK SKEWS Gunship's most incredible feature is the neat way its programmers have crammed all the controls on to the joypad and a few menus. It's actually easier to play now than it was in its original floppy form. I VERDICT A When all else fails you can fall back on your trusty cannon. It's only effective at short range, but it comes with a hefty 1,200 rounds of ammunition so you can afford a few misses. CD32 Sorry, but I've got to get nostalgic here. Gunship was one of my fave C64 games, so I'm biased. Gunship 2000 has loads to see and kill, different 'copters to fly, excellent weapons and plenty of missions. The programmers have done an admirable job of cramming a keyboard's worth of commands on to a joypad without making it too complicated. My only criticism is the graphics are too simple. Still, this is one of the best CD32 discs available. MARK PATTERSON 4. Now's the time for you to do some real damage. You've caught the enemy napping, so punish them by unloading a salvo of Hellfire missiles. 5. That showed them. It's time to go home and collect the medal and world peace is restored until the next time you take to the skies. GRAPHICS 78 SOUND 84 PLAYABILITY 93 I VALUE 92 It's compulsory to attend mission briefings, although you never hear anything new. The missions invariably involve shooting things, so there's not much point in paying attention. OVERALL KILLING MACHINE 91 THE HELICOPTER WAS INVENTED BY IGOR SIKORSKY AND MADE ITS MAIDEN FLIGHT IN 1939. THE GERMANS NEVER DEVELOPED A HELICOPTER DURING WWII, SO THAT BIT WITH ONE IN WHERE EAGLES DARE IS TOTALLY WRONG 91 "


"CVG REVIEW DEJA VU ON CD32! CD32 SPORTS SIMULATION .99 OUT NOW ISNES AND AMIGA VERSIONS AVAILABLE CD-I VERSION COMING SOON STRIKER The latest, but unfortunately not the greatest, footy game limps on to CD32... icking! Just as World Cup fever's about to strike, along comes Striker on CD32. It's the second football game to come out on this format, but can it match or surpass Sensible Soccer's CD32 dominance? Well, that would be hard, but let's see what Striker has to offer. For a start there's 64 international teams to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. They can be selected to play either a one or two-player game or enter a cup competition. Other options include different formations, game length, pitch surface, strength of wind and so on. One other point to note is that the playfield is vertically scrolling, not the best of ideas perhaps, but it's not as unplayable as the similar Super Soccer on SNES. VERDICT Choose your team! There are 64 to pick, ranging from Germany to the tragic Qatar. Oh, and England obviously not the World Cup then. 1 ALBANIR RLGERIR 13] RNGDER RRGENTINA 5 RUETAIE E BELGIUM 2 BOLIVIA FRIENDLY 1 7 RECHS 33 HERE 18 DET EL LIBERA 19 ECUADOR ES LUHERE OF 20 EGYPT 21 EL SALVRODR 3 7 HELT 2 ENDLA 2B NEHILE 23 ELRAD 35 HOROGO 34 TELANCE 60 HIGERIR ES GERAIS MIRELAND 26 EREECE 2 HEURER E TUATEMALA 28 HOLLA LL PARTS 25 HURGHAS 165 PERU ED ICELAND LE PILHAD 31 ITALY JAPAK LE GATHE 49 OF IRELAND 50 RONARIA 52 SAUDI ARABI: 52 500TLAND S2 STORER Sk 562 95 SHEER 56 SHITZERL 910 57 TRIWIDT DEACO SE TURE SSURE 50 S.R. 52 URUGUAY 52 VENEZUELA 52 HALES 5 YUGOSLAVIA BULUFFON A Goooooaaal!

"REVIEWS CVG We're here to make sure you don't buy some crap old game just 'cos the box and screenshots look cool. Oh no, if game's a turkey we'll tell you; likewise if it's a real high flyer we'll say so... GRAPHICS SOUND PLAYABILITY OVERALL Droolmongous! Stunning first-person perspective graphics they look lovely. Scroling's a bit jerky though. Not going to break any records for brilliance, but the sound does the trick perfectly well. More depth than you would possibly ever believe, but the crap controls take the edge off it. Must have taken years to develop, but dodgy programming spoils some of the splendidness. RATING:82% REQUIEM PC EYE OF THE DETROIT PC ROBINSON'S STORM PC Wow! Lots of pictures of cars! And factories! And spreadsheets! Phewee! Well, not bad for a strategy game, but then strategy games are hardly famous for world-beating sounds. Engrossing and original, this is a strategy game with plenty of new ideas to keep things interesting Very playable indeed, and it takes plenty of brainpower to get to the top. RATING:84% Not bad if you've got a decent sound card (as usual, in fact). Plenty of ray-tracing if you like that sort of thing, and some spectacular useage of polygons. Well, it's an Elite-esque spcae combat/trading simulation you probably get the idea. A completely redundant piece of sotware which has been done better a million times before. VE RATING:43% SUPER SHORTS If you've played Wolfenstein you will know what to expect since they use the same game engine. A sparse use of sound is obviously meant to convey an eerie atmosphere. Or perhaps they just couldn't be bothered. Probably the latter. It's... it's... it's just like Wolfenstein! And Blake Stone! And that other one they did with the same engine! Perhaps it's time our friends at Gametek ought to think of some new ideas. RATING:51% PC WORLD CUP CORRIDOR 7 CHALLENGE Completely useless, as you might expect from a football management sim. Well, there's acouple of interest blips here, but nothing for anyone to get excited about. Limited number of options, and generally limited all round. No in-game interaction either. Premier Challenge would be a better bet if you're after a tactical footy management game. RATING:43% HORDE PC CD-ROM Cor blimey! There's a load of that there FMV here! And some rather nice intermissons, too. If it's sampled speech you're after and you've got a card that'll support it it's sampled speech you'll get. Nothing you won't have played before really, but extremely well done and with plenty of fresh challenges. Impressive visuals and a good, solid challenge, but no marks for originality. RATING:84% Solid graphics make it easy to judge distances and shots. Loads of digitised effects enhance the atmosphere no end. | JACK NICK LAUS: SIGNATURE EDI. TION PC-CD Loads of courses, a course designer and a big challenge. Maybe not detailed enough for the real enthusiast, though For the incredible bargain price of 20 Sovs, this is most worth a look. RATING:85% KICK OFF 3 AMIGA Sprites look pretty rough compared to some of the other footy sims doing the rounds. Surprise surprise! Not much to speak of, and what's there is pretty crap, anyway. Far too complicated to control, even with two fire buttons. And the ball goes right through the players at times. It was a star on SNES the Amiga version, on the other hand, is what you'd call 'poor'. RATING:58% 93 "

O UTNOW ON FLOPPIES ON HANDHELDS Tee The Game Gear's short of releases at the mo, but Game Boy owners have nothing to worry about... JAMES POND 3: OPERATION STARFISH / A1200 / MILLENNIUM PRICE: .99 After the disaster that was the Aquatic Games, James Pond returns to familiar platform territory.

Issue 152: 83% WARIOLAND / GAME BOY / NINTENDO PRICE: .99 The third Marioland game on PD 728 Game Boy doesn't star Mario.

Issue 152: 87% COOL SPOT / PC / VIRGIN PRICE: .99 With platform games so few and far between on PC, it's great to see a big company such as Virgin Interactive produce a game of this quality. It's almost identical to the console versions and goes a long way to prove that the PC shouldn't be overlooked when it comes to this kind of game. Issue 152: 85% MICRO MACHINES / GAME GEAR / CODEMASTERS PRICE: .99 It's cheap, it's fun and it's two-player on one Game Gear.

It's a heavy duty futuristic empire building game, with more depth than the Atlantic. Not something you can just pick up and play, but it's well worth persevering with. Issue 151: 86% WORLD CUP STRIKER / GAME BOY / ELITE PRICE: .99 This is a top-notch Game Boy footy game where you can actually see the ball and the action isn't destroyed by the screen blurring. Issue 151: 87% ARCADE POOL / AMIGA / TEAM 17 PRICE: .99 Archer Maclean may have created the definitive pool game, but this still deserves recognition. For  you get the best top-down view pool game ever created. There are several variations on the traditional game including US eight ball and speed pool. Excellent stuff. Issue 152: 83% F1 / PC / DOMARK PRICE: .99 With the likes of IndyCar around, you'd probably think there isn't enough room for another PC race game. F1 proves that wrong. Visually it doesn't look like much, with simple vectors and almost no graphical detail. However, this is faster than anything else out there, which makes it well worth picking up. Issue 151: 85% COOL SPOT / GAME BOY / VIRGIN PRICE: .99 Virgin has come up trumps with another fine conversion of its hit platformer. It's exactly the same as its fullcolour brothers, right down to the layout of the levels. A spot-tacular release Issue 152: 88% AVOID Duff, dreadful, dire, dirgesome, despicable. Steer well clear... AVO And here's the little black cloud... LIITTO SPIRITUAL WARFARE / ALIVE SOFTWARE PRICE: .99 This is a God game with a difference. Instead of being God, you're actually worshipping him in a Christian platform game where you're out to put the world to rights. That's not a bad thing, but the game is. One of the worst games we've encountered in some time. Issue 152: 10% MS PACMAN / GAME BOY / NINTENDO PRICE: .99 All right, so Pacman's a classic.

"NICE LEGS SHAME ABOUT THE FACE Zooz REVIEW CVG PC ZOOL 2 PLATFORM .99 OUT NOW AMIGA, CD32 AND A1200 ALSO AVAILABLE PC CD-ROM VERSION PLANNED The last of the Zool 2 conversions has arrived. Who ever said Zool was a man's game must have forgotten about Zooz his girlie. Sticking to the wall is one main way of getting around. Just watch out for dangers in your path. I DON PLAYER ONE CHOOSE ool is a bit like the Rowntree's Fruit Pastel Challenge (the one where you have to put one in your mouth and not chew it), only on this occasion you'd have to look surprised if this wasn't a review for yet another format of this infectious platformer. Zool 2 is still managing to cover what has been done before very well. If rushing around collecting tokens is your idea of an uplifting pastime then Zool 2 is doing a good job. It's a purist platform game, one in which reflexes are given priority, and by that we mean it's fast. An intense overload of colour and parallax in fact, but yet oddly uneventful in what it requires from you. Perhaps that's the reasoning behind the appearance of Zooz to give variety, and perhaps the new look chubby Zool is an indication of the result of eating those Chuppa Chups sweets which Zool games promote so heavily. You'll just have to play the six huge levels and see. Secret rooms aplenty in Zool 2. You usually find them at dead-ends. VERDICT PC 006195 HI 10000 The main difference between Zool 1 and Zool 2 is that you can select to play as either a bloke (ie Zool) or a gal (Zooz Zool's girlfriend). Zool has new moves in this version and the girl's got a whip and can burst up through blocks. HI, 10000 Zool 2 goes to show you just how well the PC can handle arcade platformers; utilising the machine's speed, smoothness and hard disk loading of stages. But I just think the whole Zool concept has had its day. The addition of Zooz doesn't really add anything new to the game; and if you're going to convert a game to different formats you should try and take advantage of that system's potential. Zool 2 is still the same Amiga game. DENIZ AHMET These jumping beams are your continue points. You need to collect 99% of tokens on a zone to complete it. SC VUDUZO C 004200 HI 100 You can't get away from Chuppa Chups in this game. You could try those blocks on the left, but they'll probably disappear beneath you.

Who knows, but here's a chance to see how good you are... hen I were a lad I remember schmoozing, down to my local arcade and encountering Pinbot. I was young, it had flashing lights and a half-naked gal on the front and appealed to my young, inquisitive mind. Ten pence later and for the first time I'd seen the attraction in pinball games. Computer pinball games, however, are a completely different matter. What Pinball Dreams 2 offers you in the way of table-top action is two flippers, four scenes and few extras. While the simplicity formula has worked for some real-life machines, when you've shelled out a wad for a computer version, you've got a right to expect a bit more for your cash. Even if you don't have a sound card, you still get the benefit of excellent digitised music and effects through the PC's internal speaker VERDICT EDE The four tables all look radically different, but sadly they all play the same, so there's a lack of variety. boonnr 2000 ARCEPC1000 EDOR The control system, as you'd expect, is very basic. The left and right shift keys control the flippers while space tilts the table. It's not good for the keyboard since you're tempted to smack the keys really hard for more power which just leaves them knackered. SCORE PC In the history of computer games there have been two decent pinball sims Devil Crash and Pinball Fantasy. That number isn't going to change with the arrival of Pinball Dreams 2. Technically there isn't anything to fault: the scrolling's smooth and the ball movement's convincing. What lets it down is the lack of features; the tables aren't big enough and you only get one set of flippers and the only extras are ramps.

"THE ROAD TO NOWHERE REVIEW CVG MEGA DRIVE OUTRUNNERS RACING GAME .99 OUT ON IMPORT NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED The sequel to that classic arcade game Outrun rears its not-so-pretty head on the Mega Drive at last... LOCALIFORNIRE MD VARI ega has virtually defined the way arcade racing games should be with a string of brilliant machines like Outrun, Powerdrift, Rad Racer, Virtua Racing and most recently, and most excellently, Daytona USA. Somewhere in the middle of that lot though came Outrunners, a mediocre sequel of sorts to Outrun. The game itself was much the same as its forerunner. Essentially you've got to race through a number of stages making the checkpoint at each one. Every so often the road splits, allowing you to decide which way to go with one route tending to be easier than the other. Despite the choice though, the routes tend to be similar. And that's about all there is to say about it, except there's a two-player option and the game's crap!

It harks back to when all racing games made you do was move left and right and avoid a corner occasionally.

"CVG REVIEW METAL IN THE AREA SNES STRATEGY .99 OUT NOW INO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED METAL MARINES The SNES may be over-endowed with killer robot games, but this one offers something a little bit different to the rest... uzzah! A strategy game on the SNES! And it's a good one. Metal Marines draws elements from such diverse titles as Rampart, Dune and Battleships to create a game which is completely unique on this system. It's set in the future, with you in charge of a hi-tech army of battle robots (Battletech, perchance?), out to nuke the asses off evil overlords. The Rampart bit has you furiously building up your defences before the enemy strikes. For the Dune element you're trying to make enough money to increase the size of your army. As for Battleships, you've got no idea where your enemy is, so the only way to pin them down is by scoring hits with random shots. Together this makes for a game which demands plenty of tactics, occasional bouts of patience, and in return gives you a highly addictive cart with one of the easiest-touse interfaces of any strategy game. VERDICT If the enemy land, there are only two forms of defence open to you your marines or automatic gun turrets. You'll be stuffed if you've neither of these. SNES Apart from Sim City, the SNES is v. short of decent strategy games. Metal Marines goes some way to redressing the balance, though. It's easy to play, full of action and presents a real challenge. However good this game is, though, it lacks one vital element a two-player mode. It's great for a while, but the endless succession of computer opponents just isn't the same as having another human to grind into the dirt. Even as a oneplayer game though, this is still a top bit of action. MARK PATTERSON A A few missiles in the right place will disrupt your enemy's defences, allowing you to unload a platoon of marines in the area. The hardest part about waging a war is paying for it. Every unit you build costs money, which slowly accumulates as the game progresses. Defence is as important as offence, so it's essential to create a wall of anti-aircraft missiles and radar to take out any enemy attacks. GRAPHICS 81 SOUND 88 PLAYABILITY 90 VALUE 80 OVERALL ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE PowerMonger Electronic Arts/.99 Bullfrog's classic medieval, Populous-style wargame is still a corker two years after its release. It's harder than Metal Marines, though. ISSUE 135: 90% 86 A When you launch an attack you get a short animated sequence of your missile or plane flying into enemy territory. It's nice for the first few times but after that it's really dull. GAME BY NAMCO CONTACT MINDSCAPE (0444 246333) FOR MORE INFORMATION CART SIZE 12M-BIT 100 "


"REVIEWS CVG What? You mean you haven't had enough game reviews to last you until CVG hits the shelves next month? Just as well we've slipped this extra little page in just for you then (oh and all you other readers, too). GRAPHICS SOUND PLAYABILITY OVERALL EYE OF THE BEHOLDER SNES The main graphics window is a little small, but the sprites and 3D effects are good. Atmospheric background music, but the effects are pretty limp. Could do better. Almost arcade-esque in the speed and action content of the game, but with plenty of puzzles thrown in. An excellent, fast-paced RPG which knocks the spots off any other firstperson effort RATING:90% SOS SNES Original and impressive use of Mode 7 techniques, but the sprite animation is appalling. The tunes and effects add a lot of atmosphere to the disaster movie events. Very challenging, and very different from the competition but there are no enemies at all. Packs a decent difficulty level, and is most original, but regrettably not exciting at all. RATING:70% 5622 An incredible amount of time has been spent on this animation and there's a wealth of colours. Spot-on conversion of the movie tunes, with extra added ace animal noises Well designed levels and plenty to do, but can be a little floaty at times. No prizes in the originality stakes, but a top award for its excellent implementation. RATING:85% SIHOHS H3 dns BOXING LEGJUNGLE BOOK ENDS OF THE NINTENDO RING NINTENDO 2:08 Vexas Hilton Impresive sprites when still, awkward when in motion. A nice enough bit of music and some pleasant crowd effects, but nothing to get you all juiced up. Could have been a contender for certain, but spoilt by over-ambition. It's good fun, but the giant sprites make it a little difficult to tell what's going on half the time. RATING:72% Modest and bijou would be a way of describing the visuals. A bit of a curate's egg, some good bits and some rather crap ones. ULTIMA THE FALSE PROPHET SNES If you're into RPGs, this is quite engrossing once you manage to get into it. Won't turn anyone on to the genre, but this is decent enough for fans of RPGs. RATING:81% HULK MD The Hulk sprite is great, but all the enemies and backgrounds lack detail and imagination. Fuzzy and hissy throughout, this is sound from about three years ago. Probably wouldn't be so bad, but the combat is utterly tedious, which ruins everything. If the Hulk could kill opponents without too much trouble, this could have been good. RATING:52% ULTIMATE SOCCER MASTER SYSTEM Absolutely pitiful. It's hard to focus on them for long because the scrolling is so bad. You really would not believe just how incredibly bad the sound is on this game. No, you wouldn't, honest. Put it this way this is the sort of game where the ball sometimes scrolls off the screen, and you can still kick it Oh please, turn it off! Take it away! This game is scary! Do not ever go near it! RATING:12% KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND SNES Loads of clour, but the actual graphics are nothing you won't have seen before. Muffled is certainly the word you'd use to describe the sound for this game. It's pretty entertaining for a while, but completely lacking in any original ideas whatsoever. Not a terrible game, but there's nothing to set this apart from the millions of similar games.

"CVG REVIEW YOU'RE NOT FROM THESE RCADE UF-OZ ARCADE SHOOT-'EM-UP VARIES OUT NOW NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE MEGA DRIVE AND MEGA-CD VERSIONS PLANNED Yee haw! Lethal Enforcers goes back to the American Wild West for a rootin' tootin' sequel... ethal Enforcers wasn't one for the politically correct. The idea was simply to er... shoot everyone. But as they were criminals it was probably all right. Apart from the violence, the most memorable feature were the guns stuck to the front of the machine, especially the pink one! And luckily for Lethal Enforcers 2 the guns are back, only now they've been stretched to six-shooters since this time the blasting action takes place in 1879, right in the thick of cowboy and Indian territory. Five different levels have to be blasted through, which range from a train robbery to an abandoned mine. Don't worry about the odds though, there's plenty of power-ups to collect on the journey, including Gattling guns and even a cannon! So will you make it to US Marshall or simply remain a member of the posse? GUN FIGHTERSLETHAL ENFORCERS 2 ---STAGE SELECT PRESS START You can choose to play any stage at the start of the game, but bear in mind that the game gets progressively more difficult, so if you're new to the game then you'd be better off picking the first stage. THE BANK ROBBERY THE STAGE THE SALODE LOS LECHOWDOWE As Beavis and Butthead would say: 'Heh heh, heh, heh heh!'

"PARTS ARE YOU, STRANGER? REVIEW CVG ist INDIAN WARPATH! This guy is the last baddy in the game and he's a right git! A Those stray bullets don't go to waste. Instead they pep. per the background and generally mess the place up! RELOAD! PRESS Shooting at some people or background objects can result in one of six different different power-ups such as the shotgun shown here. Some are limited while others last until you die. They're collected by simply being shot. First of all he appears and charges himself up. Bolts of energy fly at you and turn into energy destroying skeletons if you don't destroy them quickly... Not for the squeamish; Gun Fighters features blood and gore galore. Characters can also be wounded as well as killed outright. PRI VERDICT ...Skeletons also rise from the ground. This guy means business! MACHINE Gun Fighters is a more complete game, with superior guardians to those in Lethal Enforcers. More precise shooting is needed to kill, otherwise you just wound your opponents. There are some amazing digitised backgrounds and the difficulty curve is well set. The guns are too large though, and it's easy to knock the cabinet when reloading. There's not much variety either, but seeing as it's an arcade game, that's not really a major problem. RIK SKEWS BOSS DRUMMING! There's a whole heap of nasty bosses to contend with before you face the final showdown. Here's a look at some of them... Should you manage to kill him he turns back into a spirit. Until next time, perhaps... A Those guns are back, but they are of course sixshooters since this is a Western-based game. Shame they couldn't have changed the colour of the pink one though! GRAPHICS 85 SOUND 88 PLAYABILITY 82 VALUE 80 OVERALL This boss fires his cannon at you, so you've got to find time to shoot his shells as well as him. A major irritant is this old guy. He leaps about all over the train and is very difficult to pin down. A Watch out for the rolling barrels from this boss. On the whole he's quite easy to beat though. Don't worry, this is the two-player mode! Even so you've each got to out. draw three of these suited nasties. 82 MANY OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE GAME ARE DIGITISED REPRESENTATIONS OF SOME OF THE KONAMI AMERICA STAFF. THAT GOES FOR THE SAMPLED VOICES TOO I03 "


"CVG ARCADES THE LATEST MACHINES RCADE S: OLITIONSMINE SAPDV With a foot in the door and a notepad in his hand, Rik Skews checks out what's hot in coin-op city... CUF-OZ 2-036 w ww.ms STARRING: JAMAL_MASHBURIN The graphics are still as brilliantly digitised as ever. Couple this with great sampled sound and killer gameplay and you've got an arcade superstar. NBA JAM GETS A NEW COAT OF PAINT Boomshakalaka! By the time you read this a new version of last year's best arcade game should be in your good old arcade emporium. That's right, NBA JAM is back in a new Tournament Edition. The original game is still here in all its glory, but there are some excellent new enhancements available to the player including the ability to select from five characters instead of the original two. This allows you to substitute at half-time and sort out the wheat from the chaff in each of the NBA East and West teams. There's also more power-ups, secret moves and many new statistics. All this makes NBA JAM more playable than ever. SULISTITUTIONS With five players in PRESS TURBO TO SWAP each team, half-time is a good opportunity PRESS SHOOT TO SELECT to make substitutions and get rid of a player who's having a bad match or who's been injured. VISIT: WILLIAMS DEMOLISH THE PINBALL OPPOSITION Also on its way from Williams is a pinball version of Demolition Man, based on the highly explosive and enjoyable movie of the same name starring old rubber muscles him. There's plenty of self, Sly Stallone. We reckon novel features in the game like these twin that even non-pinball fans will gun grips used to conget a lot out of this game trol both the cyro-claw since it's sporting some and flippers. excellent new features not seen in pinball games before. For a start there are two side mounted triggers to control the flippers and the cryo-claw (you'll recognise it from the film). And there's a miniature car crash built in! No, we don't know exactly how this is going to work in something like pinball, but hey, we're open minded. Look out for a full San Angeles burns in one review in a forthcoming of Demolition Man's excelissue. Let's hope we lent Dot-Mation scenes. don't have to go all the way to San Angeles to test it out though! MOLEWAT 42:5= If you've seen the film, you will probably recognise this as the cryoclaw where Stallone is cryogenically frozen. In the game it's controlled by the gun handle grips. Another industry first is the miniature car crash feature that's been built into the game. He's on fire! Like the original NBA JAM, the Tournament Edition features this move where your player becomes almost unbeatable if he scores three consecutive dunks. 104 THERE WERE ONLY 15 SECRETS IN THE ORIGINAL NBA JAM. THE TOURNAMENT EDITION IS RUMOURED TO HAVE OVER 70 INCLUDING AN OPTION TO SELECT A SUPERSTAR TEAM "

"CERTAINLY NO NINNY YOB'S MAILBAG CVG wwwmma { HOLD T, Gauk Roger! mum HELP ME DO A BANK JOBBIE Dear YOB, Please could you print a picture of me trying to rob a bank and making a balls up? Thanks. ANTHONY GAUKROGER Halifax knows anything about consoles is fully aware that the Neo is the console to have for this type of game. However, this expensive machine is in serious danger of being completely written off by the next generation of consoles and all the planned bolt-ons under the sun won't save it. You've rambled on about the SNES (you're wrong, by the way Dragon Ball Z 2 is crap) and PC, but not to mention the threat hanging over the heads of all your machines: the 32 and 64-bit machines. Right now Sony's PS-X is looming large on the horizon, and the Jaguar is starting to pick m up some sort of installed base. Granted, the 3D0 has yet to make its mark, but with Mars and Saturn waiting in the wings from Sega and Nintendo's two machines (VR32 and Project Reality) in the offing, the future's looking bleak for every machine you describe. Instead of banging off smug letters about all the kit you've got, why not make some sort of intelligent statement about the future of hardware. What do the rest of you think? Write in and I might even dole out some cash to the best letter of the lot. YOB: Let this be a lesson to you kids. You might have a sawn-off shotgun, balaclava mask, striped T-shirt and a bag marked SWAG, but if you are unfortunate enough to come from Halifax and are blessed with a surname which sounds like the mating call of an ostrich on heat, you can forget a life of crime.

"THEY TELL IT LIKE IT IS OPINIONS CVG BIG EDS SUMMER IS NOT USUALLY HOT IN THE GAMES MARKET, BUT THE EDITORS OF SOME OF BRITAIN'S BEST GAMES MAGS TELL YOU WHAT'S BEEN MAKING THEIR TEMPERATURES SOAR... STEVE MERRETT, EDITOR MEAN MACHINES SEGA CHRISTINA ERSKINE, EDITOR PC REVIEW With both Mortal II and Super SF debuting on Mega Drive this month, I reckon I could have anyone right now. Both are stunning conversions, but I have to say that MKII stuffs Capcom's World Warriors this time round. The problem with MK was it wasn't instinctive to play, but such problems are long gone and the 12 characters are now very controllable, and the moves a doddle to pull off. A vintage Mega Drive month, topped up by a quick blast against the evil Empire in a game of Rebel Assault. If there's a bandwagon going around, you can guarantee that computer games will leap on it. So this month we've had the World Cup, and so we've got new footy games, updated footy games and we've got old footy games that frankly should have been left in peace. Out of the 50-odd footy games on all formats coming out this summer, nine of them are World Cup-specific PC titles. IT makes you want to weep for the good old days when the PC used to stand aloof from all this sort of thing. TIM BOONE. EDITOR NINTENDO MAGAZINE SYSTEM PAUL RAND, EDITOR OF CVG It's been a long time coming but the wait has been worth it. No I'm not referring to Super Street Fighter II, I'm talking about Stunt Race FX Nintendo's amazing new Super FX title (see page 84). It's powerful, extremely playable and honestly the most exciting game to surface this year. CES proved Nintendo is still the most powerful video-game company in existence, with Donkey Kong Country for the Super NES displaying impossible visuals and sounds. Also Ultra 64 previously Project Reality is fully operational and looking totally scary. Arcades as we know them look set to die when this machine is released late next year. I hate to sound biased, but, for the moment at least, Nintendo definitely rules! You'd think that I'd be going cock-a-hoop over Super Street Fighter II this month but nay. It's the awesome Stunt Race FX that has got me glued to the videogame screen this month, with its top graphics and speedy gameplay. It's actually quite refreshing to see a SNES game that isn't a platformer or a beat-'em-up, and even better when it's taking advantage of new technology. Speaking of which, I can't wait to see Mega Drive 32 in all its glory with games such as Virtua Star Wars and Acclaim's batch of fab graphic extravaganzas on the way, the future of gaming really does look very rosy indeed. SIMON'THE HERO' BYRON, EDITOR OF THE ONE The arrival of Summer usually heralds a dry season for games â€” but not so on the Amiga thankfully! Renegade's Ruff 'n' Tumble is the hottest of the lot, combining old-fashioned playability with excellent graphics and sound. It may not be the most original game ever, but it does what it does brilliantly. And most importantly, it's fun. And much the same could be said for Ocean's Kid Vicious. OK, so it's a platformer, but it's doing things with a 1 Mb Amiga 500 you would not believe and it's a right laugh to boot. And we thought platform games were passÃ©, well think again. THE ONE FOR AMIGA GAMES, PC REVIEW, NINTENDO MAGAZINE SYSTEM AND MEAN MACHINES SEGA ARE ALL BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE SAME COMPANY THAT BRINGS YOU COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, AND THAT'S EMAP IMAGES 112 "


"CVG Q&A HELP! HELP! You can 'get by with a little help from your friends', but what helps you get by and get on with your favourite games, or sort out that important hardware dilemma you were poring over, is the CVG Help! team. Let them take you through it... IS IT REALLY MAGIC The wide screen mode facility on the Sony PlayStation will enable those who have said TVs to make the most of their big screens. You will not need a wide screen TV to use the console though. This new Philips model (28W632A) is the cheapest at ,000! IMPORTS ON SNES Reel Magic I'm very interested in movies on CD and currently own a 486 PC. I'm looking to buy a ReelMagic card so that I can watch movies by using my PC. A friend, though, has suggested going for a Philips CD-i instead, which costs about the same amount of cash. Save my sanity please, which one should I go for?. Tom Green, Manchester I've a SNES and I've noticed most of my games are in letterbox format. I also hear the new consoles, like the Sony PlayStation, will have a wide-screen mode. Is this the same thing, and will I need a wide-screen TV? Kien Cook, Wales Seeing as you already have a PC it may be a good idea to upgrade your current sytem rather than buying a totally new one, ie the CD-I. But what are the advantages of a Sigma Design ReelMagic card over a CD-i? Well, if you already have a sound card you can pick up A ReelMagic Lite card for around  (plus VAT), whereas a CD-i with FMV is going to set you back about . Deniz reckons you get better quality with a CD-i, but our pals on PC Review have no complaints about the ReelMagic's FMV. The main drawback with Sigma's card seems to be that it will only run Philips CD-i movies if you have a certain kind of CD-ROM drive, so check the small print. Philips is a big company though, and it is putting a lot of money behind getting plenty of game and film titles on to the market, whereas Sigma hasn't quite got the same muscle, but there are over 20 new releases planned over the next three months, with GameTek planning a further 30. If your SNES games are showing in letterbox format that's because you're have NTSC import games. It is possible to convert to PAL if you have the correct adaptor, then you end up slowing down the game. As for the PlayStation, yes it will have a wide-screen mode, and so might Sega's Saturn. You will not need a wide-screen TV, but if you do have a wide-screen it'll mean you get a full screen without having to distort the original image.

"Q&A CVG PC OR NOT PC? THE BLOKE AT DIXONS SAID If you've a Mega Drive II then you'll have to use the headphone socket on your television. THE WRITE LINE I've just bought a new design Mega Drives, but I can't find the headphone socket. How on earth am ! supposed to connect up to my hi-fi? Dixons told me it's not possible. Kenny Peters, Lancs. I have owned an Amiga 500 for the past six years now, and I suddenly feel that I have had my head stuck in the sand and that far better games systems have passed me by. Now I want to get a PC, but I don't know exactly where to start. I like ultra-fast simulations, though, I don't want to waste money on a top end PC which I'm only going to use to play games on. Also, what are the advantages of getting a CD-ROM drive as well? I've got around ,500 and I am desperate for advice. Mr P O'Brian, Basingstoke. If you're a flight sim fan (and there's none better than TFX on PC CD-ROM, pictured here) then you'll be wanting to get yourself a decent PC You've certainly made the right deciwith a CD-ROM drive. sion going for a PC if you're a simu lation fan. The problem is that if you want speed you have to pay for it. With ,500 you should be looking towards an Intel 486DX2 50 or 66Mhz (don't get fooled into buying a slower 486SX). This should have Local Bus sockets (VESA) and be fitted with a Local Bus graphics board (not IDE). Next, make sure you get a multi-sync monitor (so that you can use high resolution modes). Ensure you get a hard disk with no less than 180Mb and try for 8 rather than 4 Megs of RAM. Ask b and try for 8 rather than 4 Megs of RAM. Ask about the controller board inside, make sure it has at least a 256k cache and supports multiple hard disks. If you're going for a sound board too, get a 16-bit one instead of an 8-bit (although most support both). As for CD-ROM drives, the main advantage is storage space. A CD can hold around 650Mb of data which means bigger more lavish games. TFX (flight simulation) from OCEAN also happens to be one of the best CD games around. If you do go for CD-ROM make sure it is double-speed (300k plus transfer rate) and that it has an access time under 250ms. Prices range from  . Good luck! The chap at Dixons obviously doesn't know what he's talking about. All you need to do is connect your Mega Drive to your TV then use your TV headphone socket or other output. But the best way is to get a special lead which splits the SCART signal into video and audio. They cost around .99.

"CVG CHARTS ALL THE CHARTS CHART ATTACK WITH KEY: = Non Mover * = New Entry = Move up = Move down 3RD 728 KNOW HMVKNOW GAME Football games dominate the charts this month, with US Gold's official world cup licence taking them straight into the all-formats top-spot. Otherwise it's a pretty mixed bag this month with no software house claiming overall control of the top 20. WARIOLAND GAME BOY Nintendo Mario may be out of the frame, but Wario's still top-10 fodder. His debut game is one of the biggest selling handhelds carts of the year. ALL FORMATS TOP 20 6 SENSIBLE SOCCER INTERNATIONAL AMIGA/PC Mindscape With its full complement of international squads, the Sensi bug has bitten again with the arrival of the World Cup WORLD CUP USA '94 MEGA DRIVEI SNES/ GAME GEAR US Gold It's World Cup time and football game's are selling by the truck load, and it's the official licence that takes the top spot. 2 WORLD CUP STRIKER SNES Elite And they say there are too many beat-'em-ups. World Cup Striker gives up the top slot and dives down the Top 10. FIFA SOCCER MEGA DRIVE/SNES EA/Ocean Holding up well in the face of renewed competition, Fifa seen all off all but one challenger in its dash for the number one slot. 8 SIM CITY 2000 PC/MAC Maxis Despite struggling to keep in the Top 10, Sim City 2000 will soon be bolstered in the all-formats chart by an A1200 version. KICK OFF 3 PC/AMIGA Anco It may have stormed the charts at number three, but Kick Off 3 isn't the best of the trio. Don't rush to part with your money. VIRTUA RACING MEGA DRIVE Sega Virtua's hefty price tag hasn't prevented MD race freaks from picking it up, as it clocks in as the highest format-specific game. ARCADE POOL AMIGA Team-17 This budget game lets you take to the tables in true Fast Eddie style, and you don't get George C Scott breaking your thumbs either. PIT START SPEED 126 "


"ON ALL THE FORMATS CHARTS CVG 10 DOOM PC ID 16 PAC ATTACK SNES Nintendo We didn't like this, but someone out there obviously does. Pac Attack just isn't worth the money al12021, 1951 It's one of our all time favourites and it's still holding up the Top 10 which goes to show how hard (as in tough) it is. HEALTHAT CANNON FODDER AMIGA/PC Virgin As Sensi International scores a direct hit on the charts, the Sensible boys warfare sim takes a drop. 17 MAN UTD PREMIER CHAMPS AMIGA Krisalis OK, so it's more than a little like Sensi, but who cares when you've got a game this good? 12 18 NBA JAM SNES/MEGA DRIVE/GAME GEAR Acclaim It's had quite a phenomenal run, but it finally looks like Acclaim's mega basketball sim has its days numbered. ELFMANIA AMIGA Renegade Those beat-'em-up starved Amiga owners are obviously flipping over Renegade's stylish combat game. 13 SONIC 3 MEGA DRIVE Sega You can't keep a good hedgehog down. Unless you splat it with your XR3i. 14 STAR TREK: JUDGEMENT RITES PC/PC CD-ROM Interplay They're mouldy, they're old, but there's no stopping the original cast in their PC CD-ROM voice over spectacular. SKIDMARKS AMIGA Acid If you can stop laughing at the 'humorous' title, you'll find out that this is a rather topper race game. 20 15 ROCK 'N' ROLL RACING SNES Ocean Even its arsenal of 70s heavy metal tracks isn't enough to prevent Rock 'n' Roll Racing going into reverse this month. MS PACMAN GAME BOY Nintendo There's no fooling us you know, we're well aware this is just Pacman with a bow in his head, and this game isn't really worth the asking price. Money for old rope and no mistake. 127 "
