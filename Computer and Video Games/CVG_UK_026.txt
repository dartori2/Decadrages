If you want to get from 'A' to 'B around here you have to go via C. This is largely due to the area's ice making machine going beserk and trying to compete with Mother Nature.

I could live with this if it was the only problem since I'm beginning to enjoy this bizarre ice hockey Unfortunately this is the least of my worries The other penguins around here have been eating plankton for so long they're starting to radiate from all the trace elements they've been consuming and I think it's affected their brains as these possessed pengis seem to hate any of their brothers who doesn't look like them and I am not about to stay here and argue with them anyway, whoever heard of a penguin having a conversation...

"marchÃ© ) 26 ...a spectacular range of software BLASTERMIND SPECTRUM 48k .50 At first glance this might seem to be just another version of a very popular game. How wrong can you be!!! True, the start is simple enough. The Spectrum picks a code of numbers or colours with a selection of levels of difficulty and invites you to do the same. You then take it in turns to guess each others code from the clue supplied after each guess. An extremely well written, fast and very clearly displayed game, with almost inevitable defeat. This was exactly as intended but unfortunately something went wrong. During the programming strange uncomplimentary messages began to appear on the screen. At first they were so few they were not taken too seriously, but soon they could no longer be ignored. Somehow the Spectrum had been given a personality â€” a rather devious, supercilious dislikeable, hateful, horrible mind. * Side B contains a version of the game compatible with the excellent Currah Speech unit even worse!!

The harrier takes-off from an aircraft-carrier and flys over seaborne defenses to attack enemy installations on a nearby island. The harrier may fly faster, slower, higher or lower, and has bombs and cannon fire with which to protect itself and make its own attack. If it flies too high it is detected by enemy jet-fighters (which it may counter-attack) SO it needs to hug the mountainous terrain which also varies with every new game. But the island is heavily defended by antiaircraft rockets and tanks, which again the harrier may counter-attack or try to fly through. A tally is kept of fuel, speed, altitude, ammunition, plus player score and high score. Finally the harrier must make its bomb-run over the enemy base before returning past more hostile shipping to its own carrier Pure machine code with super cartoon graphics. You are in control of a diver who must swim down through jellyfish, sharks, barracuda and a host of other under-sea nasties to locate the entrance of a submarine cave. He must then follow its twisting and branching passages which change with every new game. to locate the magical giant oysters with their fabulous treasure of enormous pearls Many of the passages lead to dead-ends, while some are filled with horrible underwater monsters. Each dive has to be timed carefully so that there is enough oxygen left for the return journey, which is further frustrated by the diver's boat shifting anchor and threatening to decapitate him with its propellor.

"THE GAMES PLAYERS MICRO Our motto at Computer & Video Games has always been to advise our readers and save them money by pointing them in the direction of quality and value for money. This Christmas, we present 11 full machine reviews for you to scrutinise, offering advice and more importantly, helping to put your inquisitive minds at rest and make the right decision. Our reviews, compiled by Richard Frankel, cover the popular machines as well as some of the latest contenders to the home market, which we feel will be successful in the near future. We make an assessment on the famous Atari 400 and 800 as well as revealing Atari's new baby the 600XL. In addition we look at the VIC-20 and CBM-64, the Acorn Electron and BBC, Japan's latest contribution, the Sord M5, and the increasingly popular Oric-1. "

Many high quality, low cost, games exist for the BBC, and you'll find lots of games listings in magazines like C&VG. It's also an ideal machine to start learning on â€” and it expands with you as you learn. It's advanced enough to cope with the experienced programmer. If you can afford one go for it! MILIW BASIC/GRAPHICS/SOUND The Basic used by the Electron is almost identical to that on the BBC machine. It is slightly slower than the BBC, but still one of the fastest for its price. A vast majority of BBC programs run on the Electron requiring little or no detail changes. The Basic used is \"Structured\" which still excludes the Structured loop WHILE ... DO. Upper and lower case characters are available and hold different values. They are distinguishable in variable names so variables may use reserved words as long as they are in lower case e.g. 10 print=1435456. Integer variables have absolute accuracy with a maximum size of 2, 147,483,647. Like the BBC, string variables may be a maximum of 255 characters long. The EVAL statement allows the user to input a numerical function e.g. 10*5/sqr(56), which will be EVALuated by the computer for use within the program if necessary. Built into the system is an elapsed-time clock which has an assigned variable called TIME. It may be cleared or preset to any value and it is incremented every 100 of a second. This feature is particularly useful for games playing where it may be necessary to time the player for input or reaction. Variables may be defined as 'locall within a procedure or function. Procedures may be defined from outside the program and can easily be called to from inside the main body of the program. For direct memory manipulation, peek and poke are not used.

"19 COMMODORE 64 III PERIPHERALS AVAILABLE A dedicated cassette recorder is supplied with the computer. It is the standard Commodore version with fixed volume and tone controls for trouble free loading. The cassette is a reliable data transfer source, and will load programs first time! A disc drive is available from Commodore but few commercial programs have been produced on disc. It will set you back about . The games port is compatible with Ataritype joysticks, and there's plenty of those on the market to choose from! Other peripheral devices available from Commodore are three types of printer and a colour monitor. Neither Light Pen nor Graphics Tablet seem to have been planned by either Commodore or any electronics independents, and I doubt if any will. For those considering a Commodore Vic-20, it may be worth your while (if you can stretch your budget) to look at the Commodore-64. The CBM-64 was initially a replacement for the Vic-20. It's far superior with powerful graphics, sound and memory. The CBM-64 originally retailed at  but now, due to competition from Atari, the price has dropped to around , although it is possible to find one for below . The machine contains a hefty 64k of RAM leaving about 32k to the user. This should be enough to accommodate the most sophisticated and lengthy of games. The machine has such a large memory as it was primarily built for business purposes but it obviously suits advanced games too! 20k of ROM is also included which is used for the powerful graphics, sound and Basic that the machine uses. CONCLUSION This machine is ideal for children or beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of programming. The price has dropped to a very reasonable price around  â€” with the cassette player and programming aids thrown in thanks to tough competition from the Spectrum. You may like to add the superexpander to your Vic for about  without this it has very little to offer the more advanced games player/writer. The machine's graphic text and expansion limitations will discourage the serious games programmer. On the plus side there is still a lot of games software around for the now rather elderly Vic-20.

The screen display is 40 characters by 25 (upper or lower case) as opposed to the Vic's 22 x 33 character display. This will cause problems if trying to run a Vic program on the CBM-64, as for example, references to locations in the revised Video Interface Circuit will differ. The hi-resolution graphics offer 320 x 200 resolution with a choice of 16 colours for drawing, background, border and coloured text. One particular graphical feature which is extremely useful is the ability to create and manipulate sprites. This is a feature that any serious games writer will need, whether writing in Basic or Assembly language. You may draw an object say an alien on a 21 X 24 block grid. Each individual block may be a different colour if necessary. When the object is complete you can store the sprite in memory by a series of poke statements, and recall the sprite to any part of the screen, and move it around if necessary. Up to eight sprites can be stored at any one time. The Video Interface Circuitry allows sprites to move over each other. One sprite may be given a higher priority so that the others may appear to pass behind it. A sprite collision indicator may be called from the program. This would be necessary in fast action games for missile hit or explosion target for example. Sprites may also be given high or low priority when passing in front of or behind text. Sixty-one graphical symbols are also available which may be used in the 40 X 25 text character mode. The CBM-64's sound capabilities are 56 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

For starters its calculations are integer only with a range of -32767 to 32767. If a decimal is used in a calculation, the result will be \"syntax error\"! Also, exceeding the integer range limit during the steps of a calculation, i.e. 10 PRINT (100 * 1000/1000) will give you an overflow error, even though the final result of the calculation is in range. Keywords may be entered by one key press via the function key, although this is thankfully, optional. Both upper and lower case characters are available but hold the same values, so LIST and list would be acceptable, also LET A = B would be the same as LET A = b and so on. Variable names may be up to a maximum of 16 characters long which is quite adequate. LET statements are optional as with the variable reference in NEXT. When inputing lines, the computer will put a space between the line number and first character but will not separate Keywords. If you do not put a space after a Keyword, it will result in a syntax error. This procedure is extremely annoying and will prove frustrating especially to newcomers in the programming field.

"ATA400/800 Due to massive price decreases Atari computers are becoming more affordable to a wider range of micro users. When the Atari 400/800 was launched, the 800 retailed at around  and the 400 for around . The only main differences were the keyboards and the amount of memory supplied. If the 400 is brought up to 800 memory specifications it will be fully compatible. Many dealers selling the machines will add the extra memory to the 400 and sell it as a fully expanded machine, although Atari do not officially recommend it. Although Atari describes both machines as all purpose micros they are built in many aspects as games machines and little business or scientific application programs exist. Also it is worth noting that on buying an Atari for programming purposes neither machine comes with Basic, this can be purchased for around  as a plug in cartridge. Atari say that they expect to include the Basic cartridge plus a couple of manuals in with the price this Christmas. characters are available as well as the ability to create user defined graphics. Colour is one area where the Atari excels. There are 16 colours altogether each with a luminosity of 1 to 16 giving a potential of 256 colours in total. Some amazing graphics have been created using this technique and the result is almost a life-like graphical representation The SETCOLOR statement is useful though takes time to get used to, as there is a separate COLOR command as well, ie COLOR 1. SETCOLOR uses three parameters background colour, border and drawing colour SETCOLOUR BA, BO, D. It is also possible by one command) to change all pixels on the screen of one particular colour to a different colour. Atari sound will be familiar if you've ever walked into an arcade! Four voices, 15 sound variations, 255 pitch variations and 16 sound levels are used. It is possible to create almost any type of sound varying from the mellow harmonies of Chopin to the rocket blast whirl of an extra-terrestrial space ship on the rampage! Sound is output through the television speaker It is hard to criticise Atari sound but it lacks a duration parameter. This is resolved by the laborious use of nested loops. 1K 2K 4K 8K HARDWARE PROCESSOR BASED: 6502 RAM ATARI 800: 48K standard RAM ATARI 400: 16K ROM: 10K POWER SUPPLY: external R.F.

String variables of up to 100 characters are allowed with a maximum of 128 variable names. The 800 comes with 48k of RAM and 10k of ROM. The memory is divided up into blocks of 16k-plug in cartridges. The 400 may also be expanded from the originally specified 16k to 48k and 10k of ROM. Now we come to the bit you've all been waiting for graphics! Atari graphics are excellent, giving the games programmer great potential for fast, colourful action games (providing they are in machine code!) Inside the Atari the graphics chips have 12 different modes altogether but the manual does not explain this fully. These modes vary in resolution together with the number of colours available. The maximum resolution is a 320 X 192 line display although using only one colour. To get the full use of 16 colours one must use the 80 X 192 resolution. Other combinations of colours and resolution can be found in the rest of the modes. Graphics functions are fairly powerful too. To draw a line first you must specify the starting position â€” ie PLOT x, y then you may draw to another point on the screen-ie DRAWTO x2, y2. From there on you can continue to use the draw statement to draw to following coordinates. One powerful feature is the ability to shade specified areas on the screen which saves a lot of tiresome calculation. You have the option of using full screen of mixed graphics and text. A full set of graphics KEYBOARD AND CURSOR CONTROL The Atari 800 full travel keyboard has a nice feel though it is not perfect. I found the blip-noise-as a key is touched irritating to the point of distraction. There are 61 keys in all including option, start and select keys. Four keys are used to move the cursor up, down, left and right and these are used inconjunction with the control key. Delete/backspace is on one key while insert is separate. Either upper or lower case characters are available. As well as graphics characters which are accessible via the control or escape keys. The Atari 400 keyboard incorporates all the keys on the 800 model but instead is only touch sensitive similar to that of the ZX81. I found that I had to press quite hard to get a contact. There is however a shallow rim around each key to help your finger select it! If your price bracket falls inline with the 400 ATARIBOR "


"but you dislike the keyboard, you will be pleased to know you can replace it with a full travel one, for about . THEORIC-1 PERIPHERALS AVAILABLE Both cassette and disc drive are available for both micros. The cassette has a special interface, similar to that of the Commodore so whether you already own a cassette or not you will have to fork out an extra  for an official one! Actually the Atari's cassette is quite special. It has a stereo head for twin channel output. One channel is used for the data and the other for the voice or music. Atari says that a new cassette will be available in the near future for around . It incorporates four tracks, two channels, auto playback facility and digital audio signal. Atari make a 5 inch disc drive which retails for around . This plugs into the side of the computer and the cassette may then be pluged into the disc drive! Among the other products planned for the near future are a graphics tablet, C/PM, track ball, light pen colour and letter quality printers. CONCLUSION Now that the price of both the 400/800 have dropped they are both well worth considering. The 400 will perform just as well as an 800 when fully expanded. The machines are heavily backed by a range of high quality games software although this is often pretty expensive compared to other machines. At around  for the 800 and  for the 400 we reckon these machines are worth taking a look at. HARDWARE PROCESSOR: 6502 RAM: 16k or 48k ROM: 16k-operating system and Basic interpreter.

Unfortunately the Oric-1 falls far short of the Spectrum. The Oric-1 was introduced as the first computer under  with hi-resolution graphics, colour and sound. Although this may sound attractive, the main problem was that the Oric's potentially good features were badly implemented. The manual is badly documented and the ROM is full of bugs! However we have secret plans of a new ROM which will hopefully iron out all the defects but as yet there is no date for release. The Oric with 16k retails for around , and the 48k version for around -more expensive than the Spectrum.

"TEXAS The text display is 39 x 27 characters with either lower or upper case characters. In TEXT mode it is possible to extend the user RAM by about 7k. I found it impossible to get an adequate screen display, despite trying two televisions. There is an R.G.B. socket at the back to supply a colour monitor, but that means spending at least another ! Apparently, later production models had improved R.F. output modulators. The graphics are fairly fast though are difficult to use. Three modes are provided; LORES O, LORES 1 and HIRES. In the LORES modes, text, graphics characters and blocks can be PLOTed on the 39 X 27 grid. SCRN (X,Y) returns the ASCII value at position X,Y. In HIRES mode you may draw lines from previous plotted points, draw circles, change the way lines are drawn with the PATTERN command or fill in an area of specified number of rows. The hi-resolution is a 240 across by 200 points down with four lines of text at the bottom. For some reason graphical modes improved the reception. In addition user definable graphics are available. There is a maximum of eight colours. PAPER is used to set the background colour and INK will set the foreground colour. INK and PAPER may also be used in TEXT mode for coloured characters and background. Sound is about the only area on the Oric that is good, well not fantastic! There are 6 octaves, 15 volumes, noise and pure tone channels, frequency and six preset envelope shapes. There are 4 preset sound effects which are executed by one word each. These are SHOOT, EXPLODE, PING and ZAP! That should be enough to keep anyone occupied! some commercially produced programs were a little easier to load. The loading and saving procedures are CLOAD 'filename\" and Csave 'filename\", respectively, where the filename may be up to 17 characters in length. The loading and searching messages are printed at the top of the screen above the text window. Micro disc drives are expected sometime early next year, and these will be Hitachi 3\" size. The expected price is around . Already available is a four colour printer/ plotter. It prints either 40 or 80 columns a line at a speed of 12 CPS. It has its own power supply and plugs straight into the Oric. It retails for around . FORTH is available in cassette form which will cost you around . Extended Basic and Pascal are being planned.

But there is a limited amount of software backing it up so far. The machine is aimed at beginners but the manual is badly written, superficial in details and badly in need of an immediate revamp! The keyboard is suitable only for one finger typists. It will be interesting to see what the new extended Basic is like in terms of improving the Orie's capabilities. As mentioned Oric have produced a new ROM which they say has cleared up most of the machine's irritating features. There is growing speculation that the Oric with this new ROM will be produced in a new case and a completely new name! Oric have not said if the ROM will be sold separately to allow existing owners to update their machines. KEYBOARD/CURSOR CONTROL EDITING There are 57 keys most with auto repeat planted on a Spectrum-style keyboard. The keys need a fair bit of pressure to activate them compared to the rather frictionless feel on the Spectrum. Each key produces a click when depressed, which may be turned on or off by CONTROL \"F\". The keys are a very narrow shape which frequently causes you to miss them. Fast typing is totally out of the question! The space bar is sensibly placed in the normal position. The keyboard is mounted in an ugly case, though it is robust and sturdy. Oric's cursor control is so bad it shouldn't be allowed! The procedure is to move the cursor up to the space before the beginning of the line, then press CONTROL \"A\" to enter the desired part of the line, changing text as necessary or deleting text with the DEL key. There is no facility to insert text or scroll part of the line to close a gap. On the good side TRON and TROFF are used to activate trace on or off.

"mm SINCLAPECTRUM There's no doubt that the Sinclair Spectrum is a winner. Sinclair's basic aims have always been to provide comprehensive and powerful systems at a fraction of the price of their competitors. One other breakthrough that the Spectrum and its predecessors has achieved is highly integrated circuitry, which drastically reduces the number of chips needed without sacrificing computer power. And it's the top games playing machine of the moment. The graphics are a pleasure to use! The resolution is quite adequate for the power and cost of the machine, giving a 176 X 256 pixel display. PLOT x,y will plot a single pixel, and POINT will report if a particular pixel is set or not. The DRAW statement may have up to three parameters: and a, where x,y are the finishing coordinates and \"a\" determines the positive or negative drift of the line. Before DRAW is executive, PLOT must specify the starting co-ordinate, otherwise it will be assumed as 0,0. For example, if you want to draw an arc, say a quarter of a circle starting at position 100, 100, the procedure would be PLOT xl,yl: DRAW X2,62, PI*0.5, where slyl and x2,y2 are the starting and finishing coordinates, respectively. x2y2 also determines the size of the arc (PI$0.5 is taken as 0.5$ radians). DRAW xy, where no third argument is implied with draw a straight line. CIRCLE inevitably draws circles! Its syntax is CIRCLE X,6,r, where x.y represent the centre's location, and r is the radius.

Variable names can't contain characters *** and \"-\", although quotation marks can be included with the format A$ = \"Hello\" \"Uncle\" \"Sinclair\" MIDS,LEFT$ and RIGHT$ are not used. Instead a general string slicing procedure is applied with the expression A$ (f to 1), where f and I represent the first and last character numbers of the slice. Error detection is immediate on attempting to input a line, resulting in an error cursor showing the appropriate position. This should be especially helpful to the novice programmer as it will cut down error correction on program execution. A comprehensive set of functions exists, including the usual comparisons and mathematical operations which are all easy to use. The text display holds only 32 characters by 24 lines making the potential for word processing extremely limited. However, software is available to give 64 characters per line. If desired, text may be inverted to produce a white on black effect, as well as being individually coloured. On the good side, the reception on the whole is clear and distortionfree.

The snag is that each colour block contains the normal eight by eight pixel formation, and can an eight by eight block grid, with a maximum of 21 user definitions. Each BIN statement takes care of one line on the grid, so eight consecutive statements are required. It is then simply a matter of poking the character into the memory The Spectrum has eight different colours altogether. PAPER is used to colour the background, INK (logical names, aren't they?) is used to colour foreground and BORDER to colour the screen border. All of these may use one of eight available colours. IF FLASH is set, characters will flash between their respective and inverse colours. Characters may also be set to normal or BRIGHT levels. It is also possible to interact these commands with PRINT statements e.g. PRINT PAPER 6; \"on blue\", which will only VW "


"NICK AND DAVE CHIPS WITH SOME ENTERPRISE! All notes above middle \"c\" are positive, and notes below are negative. Incrementing or decrementing the pitch will result in a semitone raise or drop, respectively. There is no facility to create envelope shapes unless contain only one colour. Therefore when you change the colour on a pixel, all different colours within that eight by eight grid block change to the colour you're using. This of course means that you cannot have two different coloured adjacent pixels unless they lie either side of a block boundary. Despite this, some interesting effects have been created with multi-coloured lines!! Sound generation techniques are very basic. BEEP is used to create a note. Duration and pitch values may be whole or fractional. machine code subroutines are applied. The tiny built in speaker produces a distorted feeble tone, which quiet folks will regard as a blessing. There's not much more to say about sound generation except that it is rather weak compared to other micros in the same price range such as the Vic-20 or Oric-1 PERIPHERALS AVAILABLE Cassette input is via two 3.5mm jacks, though there is no remote facility for computer control. As data is being loaded into the computer the screen displays a series of moving horizontal lines within the border. One of the most important add-ons this year for the Spectrum is the microdrives. These can hold up to 100K bytes per mini-floppy tape, with a transfer rate of 16k per second. Up to eight microdrives can be connected to a Spectrum, giving you 800K accessible storage. The best part is that they're only  each (compare that to the price of an average 5\" drive!). A Sinclair thermal printer is also available. These retail for around  and print at 50 CPS with 32 CPL. One command will produce an exact copy of what's on the screen, to the printer! \"Interface II\" allows you to connect two joysticks plus ROM program cartridges that simply plug in. Another powerful add-on for the Spectrum is the Micronet-800 modem. This will allow you to download software straight into the Spectrum via the telephone lines, and also give you access to Prestel's . million pages! KEYBOARD/CURSOR CONTROL AND EDITING FACILITIES The keyboard is awful! There are 40 rubber keys altogether with auto-repeat, fixed to a membrane keyboard. The feel is totally frictionless, resembling calculator buttons rather than keys. All reserved words are entered by \"one key entry\". This means that all statements, functions, commands, procedures and most characters are labelled â€” on or by the appropriate key â€” in different colours, depending on their function. Some keys have 6 functions! Even the eight colours are labelled (in their respective colours) along the top! This type of keyword input was introduced on Sinclair's first computer, the ZX80 and has been followed through n consecutive machines ever since. I found myself scanning the keyboard, scrutinising each key and all its labels each time I wanted to enter a keyword! Despite this, many seasoned Spectrum users tell me that after a while you can memorise where all the keywords are and the respective shift keys for obtaining them and get quite quick at typing them in. Program line editing is straightforward. There are four keys used to move the cursor up, down, left and right. Each time you enter a line, it is automatically displayed at the top of the screen in its correct line position. A separate editing cursor points to the most recent line typed-in and this may be moved with the direction keys to point to any other line. Once the cursor is positioned on the desired line for editing, one must press the EDIT key â€” which will display that line separately near the bottom of the screen â€” then move the cursor to the desired position. DELETE will delete characters to the left of the cursor. ENTER may be pressed and the line will take its place in the listing at the top. CONCLUSION What can you say about the Spectrum? For a micro priced at under  with 16k and under  with 48k, with hi-res colour graphics and sound it offers unbeatable value for money. The machine is backed up by the largest amount of games software available for any current machine and the vast majority of it is of a high quality and modestly priced. However, the keyboard is not so hot and the Spectrum's sound capabilities are limited. Its slow Basic is nof suitable for the programmer who wants to create more intricate games without using machine code. Having said that the Spectrum offers a wide scope for machine code applications. Finally, it's the micro that every other manufacturer wishes they had produced! Well, just who are Nick and Dave? Chips, that's who â€” or rather, what. Nick handles graphics and Dave the sound in the much publicised Elan Enterprise micro officially launched in October. But now for the bad news. You won't be able to buy one until next April. Elan will be attemping to persuade you not to buy another computer before their new micro comes on the market with a  million television advertising campaign. The Elan will sell at around  and will have a basic 64k memory, a Qwerty style keyboard and a novel addition of a built-in joystick for playing games or manipulating text. Elan Enterprise marketing manager Mike Shirley says that the company will be making 150,000 computers a year and is aiming for a 10 per cent share of the British micro market. He added that Elan wanted to produce a machine better than the BBC and sell it at half the price. If you want to you can join the Elan users club even before you've laid a finger on the keyboard of one of these mysterious machines. The club promises newsletters and special offers for potential Elan users. As for the rest of us, we'll just have to wait until the Spring before we can find out just what Nick and Dave can do.

"16G13/4?!AVOS By Garry Marshall MAKE THE MOST OF SPRITELY TEXAS! Sprite graphics are becoming available on more and more personal computers, including the Texas Instruments T199/ 4a, the Commodore 64, the Sord M5 and the Atari computers. A newcomer to sprite graphics may wonder what all the fuss is about, and can have difficulty in finding out exactly what a sprite is. The manual for Texas Instruments Extended Basic, for example, says only that \"sprites are graphics that can be displayed and moved on the screen\". This isn't very helpful. I'll try to explain what sprites are so, armed with this knowledge, you will be able to make full use of them. A sprite has much in common with a graphics character in that it has its own shape, colours, and can be displayed on Although it has other properties than NOW, READ ALL ABOUT IT! these, a sprite usually exceeds an ordinary graphics character even in these aspects. The first way that it does this is in its positioning on the display screen. Whereas a graphics character can be placed only in character positions, a sprite can be placed at any dot position. That is to say, its top left corner can be positioned at any dot on the screen, Because of this a sprite can move smoothly over the screen, while a graphics character inevitably jerks from position to position when it is moved. Secondly, a sprite can be much larger than a graphics character so that its shape can be designed in much more detail. On the T199/4a, for example, a sprite can be the same size as four graphics characters, and on the Commodore 64, where characters have an 8X8 dot matrix, sprites occupy a grid of 24 x 21 dots. What makes sprite graphics really exciting and different from ordinary graphics, however, is that a sprite can be given a speed and a direction in which to move with a single instruction Once this instruction is issued, the sprite is automatically kept in motion in the specified direction and at the given speed without the need for any further action on the part of the programmer. WHEN SPRITES MEET Books on video games for micros are the graphics are also impressive, now very common. Usually they consist and enhance without fail the games in of program listings for a particular which they appear. They are written for machine, and they may or may not the Apple II and lle computers, but can include reasonable explanations of readily be adapted to any other compuhow the programs work. ter with a similar graphics capability.

In fact, the games are a that can now be produced in the wide decided improvement on what is usual range of areas where computer ly found in the books of Basic listings. graphics is used. This is invaluable in programming a wide range of games. As well a this, with sprite graphics a three-dimensional effect can be achieved with some ease because a sprite can be assigned a level of importance. When two sprites meet each other the more important one passes over the other so that it can always be seen on the screen while the less important one is obscured. So, in a game where a spaceship is flying past a planet, if the sprite for the spaceship is more important than that for the planet, the spaceship will appear to pass in front of the planet whenever they meet. Sprite graphics systems provide the means for manipulating sprites in many ways. To give just one example, they can usually detect automatically when two sprites meet each other. On the T199/4a this is done with the CALL COINC sub-program and on the Commodore 64 by examining memory location 53278, although when using Simon's Basic on the 64 a DETECT command is provided for this purpose. Next issue I'll be bringing you more information about the graphic capabilities of your computer. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 77 "

"ADVENTURES, be 389 BY KEITH CAMPBELL CHRISTMAS CRACKER! \"What are you thinking of doing for the Christmas issue?\" asked Tim, our production editor, always eager to tick off unfilled pages. I nearly choked on my coffee. With the August heat making me sticky with perspiration, nothing could have been further from my mind than Christmas. But words have to be written long before the magazine reaches the newsstands, so I shut my eyes and thought of Queen just finishing and the obligatory Christmas circus about to Circuses! Ghost stories! Eureka! My start. Christmas review!! I so startled the office that Linda pasted a title upside down, and Clare stopped dead in the middle of a Rebecca Corwell letter. Your car out of petrol miles from anywhere, empty can in hand, you cross the fields in the gathering dusk. Suddenly you come across an unnerving site -a big-top complete with all the usual trappings a generator, maintenance wagon and animals. En tering the tent you find the ring, where all is deserted. But wait! Is that a clown running off into the shadows? What to do now? To pass the time, here's a chance to become a circus artiste. Tame the cats, try your skill on the trapeze, and maybe walk a tightrope! I found I made a rather nasty mess on the canvas when shot from the cannon, but my tightrope walking is coming on a treat! I no longer get killed when I fall off! What's the point of it all? To discover that, you will have to play Circus for quite some time, and to reach your goal, even longer! Circus is one of Brian Howarth's Mysterious Adventures, and did, on occasions, send a cold shiver down my snow. The heat pouring in through the window became a blazing log fire, and the pub lunch settled in me like Turkey and Christmas Pud. I pictured the telly, the the MADNESS MINOTAURS AND A PHILOSOPHER Help is at hand for David and Jean Symonds, thanks to two players of Madness and Minotaurs. Mushrooms do come into the game later, but for now simply find the small lamp on the first level and type \"LAMP ON\". You can then descend! \"I can understand their agony,\" writes Robert Moss of Basildon. \"The criminal thing is that one single command will change everything.\" W. Pooley of Liverpool also sent in this tip, and in return requests help in Jerusalem Adventure. Any offers on how to get through the Golden Gate? Some pleas I receive are quite difficult to satisfy. But I try my best so here goes! Attention Mrs Oxley of St Andrews, Fife. I hear that you have taken over your son's Espionage Island. Shame on you! Take it from me, it's no use staying up till 2 a.m. trying to kill the native woman. Play the game, or rather, stop playing the game, and let David have a go! Here's another difficult one. Simon Marsh from New Malden says some very flattering things about the Adventure feature, suggesting that I take over the whole magazine! He offers some criticism though \"I notice your pages are coming under attack from Spectrum owners. Please don't let them take over, like they have in XXXXXXX Computing XXXXXX,\" he implores, \"e.g. NO HOBBIT PROBLEMS!!!\" Over 100 pages with no mention of Hobbit, Simon? Impossible! It's the most popular game in the world isn't it? Can anyone get cheese in Philosopher's Quest? Or find David Somekh of Wanstead a shaggy dog after giving a woman a less shaggy one? Come to think of it, has anyone completed Philosopher's Quest yet? Denis Field of St Albans can't escape the Castle of Riddles courtyard. Directions N, E, and Wall lead him to very short-lived excursions. Is it the same for you too? Dark Crystal is a game seldom mentioned in despatches, so any offer of help for David Johnston and Gareth Dart of Gwent would be much appreciated. Special hints are printed upside down but there are other clues hidden, as usual, within the reviews and chit-chat. Those who know the answers will no doubt recognise these. If you are searching for help about a game mentioned here, study my words carefully even the headlines may help! Help is also at hand for me, now. Your letters are starting to pile up too high too fast. I like to ensure each of you gets a reply, so I turned the tables on my most prolific correspondent, and persuaded him to give me a hand. Welcome to Simon Clarke, whose name you may have seen a few times in the Helpline section. I gain the double advantage of having less replies to write, and no more problems from Simon to worry about! So if you are stuck, or can help \"unstick\" an Adventurer in distress, write to me at Keith Campbell's Adventure Helpline, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5JB. I shall continue to receive and read all your letters, but will pass some of them over to Simon to answer. A Happy Christmas to Adventurers everywhere.

Paul Smith of Cheam, fell into a dead faint after offering to become a life subscriber to C&VG and the complete solution to Adventure B, just to find out how to open the gate.

Circus is available for a wide range of systems, including 48k Spectrum, BBC (A or B), TRS-80, Colour Genie, Atari 400/800, 64, Dragon 32, 16k ZX81 and Lynx. The suppliers vary from micro to micro, so would-be purchasers should scan the adverts. And now I must get back to start that generator time to turn on the Christmas tree lights! similar standard. But this had little to do with the Adventure that I, as Dan, was about to play. I played the Dragon version, and thought the game started off in a rather mundane way, with a small puzzle to solve before getting access to the tomb proper. The display was split rigidly into location description (top left), displayed inventory (top right), and conversation (bottom four rows). It looked rather stodgy, the response was slow, and I nearly didn't bother to continue playing. A case of first impressions being misleading, because it soon became apparent that the response to locationchanging commands was very prompt, abbreviations N.S.E, and w making moving around quite a slick procedure. The response time varied considerably depending on the command, and averaged-out, was quite acceptable. Lack of cursor (my pet hate!) was partially compensated for by an obliging 'beep' when the computer was ready for more input. Having entered the ornate doors leading down, I set about exploring the crypt. Here was a large area for exploration. The network was easy to get around and interesting to tour. You could visit an Aquarium (permanently?), tour a gal lery of murals, play a juke-box (got the coin?) and listen to Franklin and the All Stars, treat-yourself to a steam-bath and much much more. Very entertaining stuff but all the time you might wonder what the objective is, until and unless you have visited the right place. Once visited, the search is on in earnest, for you know what you need but not how to get it all! \"The best Adventure I have seen for ages!\" commented Neil, my 15-year-old son. I was inclined to agree with him! Definitely an acceptable Christmas present for any friendly Dragon. The game is written in Basic and unfortunately the BREAK key is not disabled. I say \"unfortunatley\", because if you accidentally hit BREAK the fixed display will be spoiled. To recover, simply type GOTO 350, and then drop an item you are carrying to relist your inventory. Don't list the program or believe me, your fun will be spoiled! The cassette comes complete with an 18 page 'case file' which includes pictures of many of the text-described locations. Franklin's Tomb is from Salamander Software of Brighton, and available for Dragon 32, 48k Oric, and BBC 'B' micros at .95 from a number of supphers. A sequel is promised I can't wait! DAN DIAMOND PRIVATE EYE Whoever Faint-hearted Franklin is, he made certain he would be comfortable in his after-life. That is quite evident to anyone venturing into his tomb, an experience available to Dragon, Oric, and BBC owners.

"Once upon a time if you wanted to write a good game then you needed to be a good programmer. But not any more. Programs are appearing which allow you to create games without knowing anything about the computer. Robert Schifreen tested the two latest offerings. GAMES without If you've always fancied yourself as a designer of video games but don't think you are skilled enough to program your own games, then this new software innovation might interest you. Called The Games Designer, this program allows you to design your own video games â€” even if you know nothing at all about programming! The games are all in machine code and, says the maker, will be as good, if not better than most of the commercial software currently available for the machine. If all this sounds too good to be true, then you should realise that there are some limitations to the system. Firstly, you cannot design your own unique game from scratch. You are only allowed variations on the theme of Invaders, Asteroids, Scramble and Berserk. Once the tape has loaded, you are presented with a menu of options. At this point, there are 8 separate games stored in the system and you can select any one of them. The games are not stand-alone programs but are banks of data which need the actual designer program to run. A game can be saved and loaded once written. You can either alter one of the 8 demo games supplied, or create your own. The only limitation here is that it can only be one of the 4 main types mentioned above. The first option in the menu is to play a game. This plays the current game and uses the cursor keys for movement. The zero key is used to fire. To change the current game to another of the eight, you choose option two. Taking option 3 puts you in to the sprite editor. Sprites are 12 pixels square as opposed to the normal 8 available in Basic. These are the characters which will appear in your game including all the aliens, ships, missiles and the like. If you want animation, like a space invader which constantly blinks, you can define two different sprites and the program will constantly flick between the two during play.. The menu option which has the most dramatic effect on a game is the configuration section. Selecting this option takes you to yet another menu which allows various characteristics of the game to be set. Most important is the game format which is a number between 1 and 4 corresponding to the four types of game. Adding 4 to any of these values makes the game joystick compatible. You can also set the background and foreground colours here. There is also a special effects section which does wonderful things like scattering random stars over the playing area. You can also specify whether aliens appear singly or in groups. You can provide a shield for the laser base if you wish. Next come the sound effects. Entering this option lets you alter the sounds by means of 4 sliding controls displayed on the screen. There is a reasonable simulation of a definable envelope command here, and the sounds available are quite good. There are 4 different options, with different noises producable for missile sound, bomb sound and explosions of ship and alien. The attack wave command allows control of movement on the screen. Here you can set up your attack waves, and specify which sprites will be used to form them. The actual movement is controlled by another menu option. There are a number of different movement paths which you can define and then link them to each other creating long chains. Whilst setting up the attack waves, you are also given control over such matters as how many points will be awarded for destroying certain aliens and also the maximum number of aliens in an attack wave. Once you have created your masterpiece you can save it to cassette. The system used differs from The Quill in that the cassette is not a self contained game. It is simply a data file which needs to be loaded along with the designer itself. Although this package is sold as a games designer, there is a limit to the originality of the games which can be produced. You are always limited to variations on a theme, although it should be said that these variations can be quite divorced from the original However, you can produce smooth, fast machine code games with little. effort and you get 8 demo games as well. Games Designer comes from Quicksilva at .95 and runs on a 48k Spectrum If you've ever tried your hand at writing an Adventure program then you'll know just how long and complicated a job it can be. But that's been made a lot easier with The Quill, a program for the Spectrum which allows you to design your own adventure games. You can now put all your effort into creating the scenes and pitfalls, and leave The Quill to do the programming for you. The best way to test such a program is to use it to create a simple Adventure, so that's what I did. Firstly I designed the game by drawing a map showing all the locations and how they were connected. There were just four locations in my example, although in reality you aren't limited to any size. The program itself takes around 8k, so the database for the game can be massive if you have the time to design it. Once you have your map designed, you then have to tell the interpreter about the locations. You type in the text which is associated with that particular location. The entire program is menu driven. There's a main menu with around 20 options such as alter vocabulary, select movement table etc., and you can alter any part of your game at will. Within each of these choices there's a small sub-menu with 2 or 3 choices. Once you have defined the locations you have to tell the program how they are interconnected. For each location, you need to specify all possible routes from it, and the number of the location which taking that route will lead you to. No adventure is complete without a number of objects like keys, torches and jewels. You can have up to 255 objects in your Adventure and you define them in the same way as the locations. For each object number you type in the appropriate text. Once you've specified your objects you can place them at their starting positions in the game. Again you use the location numbers to specify positions. There are also a few special object illustration: Caron Creed mah COROBO KOOBS "


"numbers, for example 254, which implies that the object is currently being carried by the Adventurer. The most important part of an Adventure is the range of words which the computer can understand. The program may not understand TURN ON THE LIGHT, but may be totally familiar with a command to LIGHT LAMP. The heart of the Adventure is called the event table. It is this which links the actions which the program takes, to the commands which the player types in. All the normal commands associated with Adventures are available, like Inventory, Describe and Quit. A player can also save the current game to tape and continue his quest at a later date. This is distinct from saving the completed adventure to tape which can be done not by the player but by the person creating the game with The Quill. Because certain actions are dependent on other conditions being satisfied, The Quill provides a number of flags which the program can set. For exam ple, if a player picks up a key the program may set flag five to a value of one. Then, if the player tries to open the door the program will look at the value of flag five to see if the player has the key. If he or she does, then the door will be opened. If not, then the Adventure will say something like \"you cannot open the door without the key\". Additional commands also exist such as BEEP, which enables you to add limited sound effects to the game. No doubt most people getting killed by a dragon will do so to the accompaniment of the Death March. At any time you can test your Adventure and alter any part of it. Using The Quill lets a computer user create a playable Adventure game. It will take quite some time to produce a good game, and a clear map is essential. Nevertheless, you do not need to know anything about programming. In fact, using The Quill will teach a novice something about writing programs as he works through the simple language which the Adventure interpreter understands. This software is very professionally produced. It comes with a 52 page manual which takes you step by step through the creation of a simple Adventure. Obviously if someone creates an Adventure he will wish to save it. You can do this with The Quill and it will save both the Adventure and a short Basic loader program. This means that the tape produced will auto-run and appear no different from a w commercially produced program. Gilsoft, creators of The Quill, are quite happy to let people sell their creations to others. They do not demand royalties as Softek do on their compiler. There is simply a message in the manual saying that \"if you intend to sell an Adventure written with The Quill we would be grateful if you could mention somewhere in it that it was written with The Quill\". Now that's the way to handle such matters, isn't it. The Quill is made by Gilsoft which is * based in Barry, South Glamorgan. You can buy a copy from selected computer outlets or direct from Gilsoft by mail or phone 0446 736369. If you're an adventure fan then you'll find it worth every penny of the .95 price tag. Melbourne House have a similar pro gram on offer for Spectrum owners. It's called the high resolution user friendly real time games designer, or HURG for short! Unfortunately there's only one copy of the program in the world at the moment, and that's in Australia. However, Computer and Video Games has discovered information about the program and it sounds very similar to the Quicksilva offering. Again it is driven by a series of question and answer routines. It has the facility for creating various graphics characters and these can be animated. You can also speed up the game or make the aliens more vicious. Any game can be saved on cassette, but you will still need the games desig ner loaded as the control program The Hurg comes with three demo games as opposed to Quicksilva's eight. There is also a monthly competition which Melbourne House will be running for the next few months to find the best game created with the Hurg. All the finalists will then be judged to produce a grand winner, with a prize of ,000. The Hurg should be available from you local W. H. Smith soon, and it also costs .95. With the introduction of these programs, it now seems possible that games written with such systems will be offered for sale on cassette. As for the quality of this software we shall have to wait and see. As for the question of copyright, I think that an interesting situation could develop. ) when oooh NO could develop strapon (B Gamang ang will SV "

"The unbeatable TI Home Computer. It's all the computers your family will ever need. Buying a home computer is something you have to get right first time. It's too late when you've got one to find it won't take plug-in software. Or can't be programmed without an expensive accessory The TI Home Computer is a real computer system The TI Home Computer has got the memory power you might expect from more expensive computers, built in. At its heart is a powerful TMS 9900 16-BIT Microprocessor: Most other home computers have only an 8-BIT. And you can expand the memory from 16K of RAM up to 52K The total memory capacity is 114K Bytes. A wide range of software for everyone Another feature that makes the TI system so powerful, yet so easy to use is Solid State Software.

But there's an expanded range of optional languages like Extended BASIC, TI Logo, USCD-Pascal, TI FORTHand Assembler. With these you can fully expand your programming skills. A wide range of peripherals Most computers lose a lot of memory when you add peripherals. The TI Home Computer is different. Every peripheral comes with its own built-in programs to keep the loss of memory to a minimum. The convenient Peripheral Expansion System houses up to eight peripherals. Additional hardware cards simply plugin. You can even add a complete Floppy Disk Memory System. The peripherals include memory expansion, RS232 Interface, P-Code card and more. There's also a sophisticated matrix printer and Solid State Speech synthesizer which you can use with your own TI BASIC programs. A lot more for no more The TI Home Computer gives you so much more without costing more. At today's price it's exceptional value. Take your family round to try one. If you never try it you'll never know what you're missing. It even has what professionals look for in a home computer CPU: TMS 9900 16-BIT, plus 256-byte Scratchpad RAM. Memory: Total 114K bytes; 26K bytes ROM internal; up to 36K ROM cartridges external: 16K built-in RAM expandable to 52K bytes. Keyboard:48 Key QWERTY, alphalock, function key auto repeat.

"MICRODRIVE COMPATIBLE ABF PROGRAMMABLE JOYSTICK ME INTERFACE Spectrum or ZX81 ONLY 32.95 +pp for AGE ABOUT OUR INTERFACE The AGF Programmable Joystick Interface is a unique design offering the use of any Atari compatible joystick with absolutely all software, whether it is cassette or ROM cartridge, with the Sinclair Spectrum or ZX81. The hardware programmable interface requires no additional software and accurately replicates the keys of the computer in a manner which is responsive to absolutely ALL key reading methods, both BASIC and Machine Code. The interface does not interfere with key operation and can therefore be used simul taneously with the keyboard. There is no need to remove the interface once fitted as the rear extension connector will accommodate further expansion, i.e printers or RAM packs etc. This important feature avoids excessive wear to the expansion port. The key replication principle pioneered by AGF means that your own programs can use eight directional joystick movement by utilising simple key reading BASIC. Two joystick sockets are provided which share the same keys, for use with the majority of two player games. Several interfaces may be used on the same computer for multiple joystick applications. The interface is programmed by a two digit code, which is looked up on a programming chart supplied, for each direction and firing button. The two numbers are then selected on a pair of leads which are clipped onto appropriately numbered strips on the interface. Once configured this can be marked on a Quick Reference Programming Card for storing with the game. As the programming is not power dependent the interface retains the last configuration made and can be immediately used when next switched on. FROM: MR/MRS/MISS ADDRESS PACKAGE CONTENTS SUPPLIED  Programmable Interface Module as illustrated, complete with clip-on program ming leads. Self adhesive programming chart detailing how to define which key is simulated by UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. and FIRE This can be fixed on to the case of your computer or if preferred the protective backing can be left on. The chart is made of a very durable reverse printed plastic and is extremely easy to read. One pack of ten Quick Reference Programming Cards for at-a-glance setting to your games requirements. The card allows you to mark the configuration in an easy to read fashion with space to record the software title and company name. Video Graffiti demonstration program which is written totally in BASIC to illus trate how all eight directions and fire can be read. This is also a useful high resolution drawing program. 12 months guarantee and full written instructions.

"Z This is a version of the classic arcade game turned on its side! The player attempts to knock out as many multi-coloured bricks from a wall on the opposite side of the screen. The author reckons his version of Breakout is easier to play as you get more time to position the bat in time to hit the oncoming ball. This version also includes a Hall of Fame feature which can hold up to five top scores. This is displayed at the end of each game. The last competitor's score is also displayed so you know just what to beat when you are playing against friends. When the game starts each player gets five balls â€” these are lost if they get behind the players' bat. The numbers below the row of bricks correspond to the score value of each brick. Each time all the bricks are knocked out the wall rebuilds itself and you get another crack at it increasing your score. The program is divided into three main parts. One to set up the screen, another to play the game and the third to update the Hall of Fame. Part one sets up all the functions needed. FN a(x): is used when doing fancy scoring, le 006, 056 etc. FN b(x): returns 1 if x is even. Used to see which part of a brick was hit. FN c/x); returns 1 if x is odd. Part one also sets up the Hall of Fame and calls subroutine to set up the user defined graphics. Part two allows you to move your bat and moves the ball according to the x-y directions in xm and ym. The variable xm changes when the ball hits the top or bottom of the screen and ym changes when the ball hits a brick, your bat, or the vertical wall on the right. Part three tells the player if he or she is in the Hall of Fame and if so, asks the player for a name and stores it along with the score. It also asks if the player wants another game and if so jumps back to line 40 Naisci;SC: PRINT FT bx, bg, PAPE R & INK 6 FSC168=INT (sc/168) THEN PRINT AT 6x + (FNBbxon AT ox, oy; PAPER 5; INK 6. 5: BEEP.01, b: NEXT : NEXT 225..PRINT AT OX,oy; PAPER 6; IN G AT OXoy, PAPER 6, IN LET ballball+1 Last SC 20 IF ball (6 THEN GO TO 140 @25 DIM as (25) LET aS=\"Game Over PAPER 4: INK Press a FOR a=1 TO LEN a $ 50 PRINT AT 20,2+aias tas: BEEP 05, FN bla) *10: NEXT a IF INKEYS THEN GO TO 106 BORDER 2: PAPER 2 PAPER 4: INK INK 7: C FOR a = DIM TO 5 STEP 1 PRINT AT 10-a, a +2as a $ (10 + (( -a) *2)) NEXT a FOR_a=6 TO 13: PRINT AT a,7 NEXT a PRINT AT 2, 13; \"HALL\" PRINT @ PRINT 3.14; \"OF\" AT GO TO . 11; 12 FAME FOR a = 1 TO 5 NEXT a @ PRINT AT a +5,8; \"200\"; $(a) 1190 FOR a = 1 TO 5: PRINT AT a +5 11-FN a ( ha);ha): NEXT a L DOZVIH oo UOMON 0 + . 0000000000 Bosco 0 Yedewechseeweeeee..HHHHH + 1 20100HUMOM 6 HOUM08.0 H UCUN CICLOQOOGON 000 000 OL CUCU CU CU CU CUVIO 0 0000 00003: How cu un 0 9090901&mou9090900000000190 99000 AT 118 LET Lastase 1958 POKE 23658815c=hta);\"yo 1209 GOSUB 1178 21 FOR a = 1 TO 5 1220 IF Scch (a) THEN GO TO 140 20 SEK23656.8: PRINT AT 13:0 have \"AND (schiaia: \"st\" AND a31\" (a=1); \"nd\" AND (a=23; \"id\" AND your name is GO TO 2000 AND (a > 3): INPUT \"Ente I NEXT a: PRINT AT 12.8; \"Hard 2000 FOR b=5 To a +1 STEP-1 20 LET LET h (b) =h (b-1)  NEx $(b) =h $ ( 248 LET -1) @s@ GOSUB 1170 12) =S: LET 00 PRINT PAPER 2; AT $12.)=x$ FOR BRL 7: 20111 25 PLAY AGAT PRES ; AT & LEK EFE GAME @ IF X$=\"9\" THEN BORDER 7: @ IF X$=\"P\" THEN BORDER 5: PA INK @ CLS : GO TO 9999 INK : OVER : CLS:GO U +UDU 0 m0.01% + on M AW QO010: : UL MOTO Ea :1.

"WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN BUYING A VIDEO GAME SYSTEM. There are low and high power consoles. There are low and high power cartridges. You can play a high power cartridge on a low power console but the game play is limited by the power of the console. CBS. ColecoVision is a 32K ROM/17K RAM system more powerful than many home computers. CBS. ColecoVision cartridges are high powered, most like Donkey Kong are 16K, Zaxxon is 24K. So with our system, using our cartridges, you get better graphic definition, better colour and sound, faster play, more moving objects to challenge your skills and more moving or changing screens to make life more difficult And isn't that what you want from a video game system?

"Lunar Res Can you save the peaceful people of the planet Noxa from the nasty Trammers? You are the pilot of a space rescue craft and have been given the job of saving the poor Noxanians from their enemies. You provide a shuttle service between the friendly starbase and Tanding pads on the planets stoce where the population await to board your craft. The evil Trammers have created a minefield in the planets' atmosphere so getting in and out is difficult to say the least! Once the landing pads have been used twice they disintegrate making your life even harder! Full instructions are included in the program. Happy landings! Machine Code addresses 15200 -screen scroll to the left routine. Locations 1536 and 1537 contain the with and low bytes for start address for video RAM. 1676d-moves the shuttle automatically up or down without searching the joystick position 1630 this moves the shuttle in the corresponding position direcion of the joystick Locations 208d and 209d have the current address for the player.sed indirectly in machine code. 1687this hyte determines upward or downward movement. A 230d in this location causes downward movement. A 198d causes upward movement de decimal). Note: Lines 500-530 are a fairly fast method of checking for collisions with the player missile graphics rather than using the slower IF statement All the routines for sensing joystick positions, moving the screen left and the movement of player missile graphics are carried out in machine code to evsure a fast game.

But now the cursing Q*Bert has been cleaned up for the BBC B by enterprising author Andrew Brown. Just like the arcade game of the same name you have to help Q Bert change the colour of a pyramid built out of cubes. He does this by leaping from cube to cube using his amazing jumping powers. However, there are hazards which plague Q Bert like a giant beach ball which bounces around after him and in latex screens there's Coily the snake to contend with. Also the ball speeds up as you get better at the game and conquer more pyramids. You get three lives and to start with and an extra life after every sicth screen. You won't get past the third screen without a lot of practice. So if you want that extra life to come a bit sooner why not change the 5 in line 460 to a smaller value. The initial speed of the ball is set in line 610 (variable SP). Make it smaller (in units of 50) to make it go faster. RUNS ON A BBC B IN 7K BY ANDREW BROWN Variables XX,YY:Q*Berts coordinates.

"SiNCIE SPECIB ZX Spectrum PLANE TOIDS ZX Interface 2 ZX Spectrum PLANETOIDS Inside.. New Interface 2 and ROM cartridges! New Software! "


"TAKING NEW SOFTWARE IN NEW DIRECTIONS SOFTWARE UPDATE The latest cassette software for ZX Computers 01111 You'll see that this issue of Sinclair Special devotes considerable space to software.Why, when we've so much to say about hardware and peripherals? Simply because at Sinclair we believe in supporting first-class hardware with first-class software. This month sees the start of a new commitment to education in our catalogue, both for adults and children In the field of micro theory, we've programs like Beyond BASIC and Make-a-Chip, which take you from the creation of simple ZX assembler subsets to simulated circuit design projects. There's Musicmaster, to teach you music terminology, note values and composition And if you're keen to beat your Spectrum at chess (which can be hard), you'll certainly want to try Chess Tutor 1, the first program in a complete chess masterclass 9111111 Chess Tutor 1 For 48K RAM Spectrum. .95. Chess Tutor is a new way of learning all about chess-using your ZX Spectrum. It starts from the beginning by teaching you about the chess pieces and the way they move-including castling, en passant, promotion, check, checkmate, stalemate and perpetual check Then it teaches you the basic tactics -pins, forks, double attacks and skewers. There are over 120 exercises and over 200 questions for you to answer-with demonstrations and hints from your ZX Spectrum when you want them. You can choose which parts of the course you want and even experienced players may be surprised at what they can learn from Chess Tutor Musicmaster For 48K RAM Spectrum. .95. Musicmaster turns your ZX Spectrum into a musical instrument which will not only play tunes, but will also demonstrate key signatures, durations of notes, and scales. You can write your own tunes-in any keyplay them over and over again, save them on tape, modify them. You can either write your music on a stave or place a simple overlay on your Spectrum for a 17-note keyboard. Coming soon... In the pipeline are many new releases some of which break completely new ground. LOGO and micro-PROLOG for instance. They're fifth generation languages which will take you and your Spectrum closer than ever before to the creation and application of artificial intelligence. A formal agreement between Sinclair and Macmillan Education has been announced, the first results of which will be published this autumn. These consist of five programs in a complete early reading course plus the first four of a series of programs based on Macmillan's top selling Science Horizons Scheme. All programs are designed for use in schools or the home. And with Blackboard software, we're publishing six more home education programs for primary school children. Covering alphabet, spelling and punctuation, each of these programs is a true gem, unlike any other education software, and fascinating to run. Even for adults! I believe that these new titles represent a major advance in educational software for the home Make-a-Chip For 48K RAM Spectrum. .95. Make-a-Chip teaches you the basic elements of circuit design, shows you how they fit together, and then lets you design and test your own circuits When you have designed a circuit, you can give it inputs and outputs and your ZX Spectrum will check it for you. Then it will run it, or tell you what's wrong so that you can modify it. Make-a-Chip is a fascinating way of finding out how computer logic works. New ROM software too! You may well have heard news of ZX Interface 2 and ROM cartridge programs. You'll find full details of the Interface and its software on the facing page (and there's an order form on the back page too!). These offer an instant games playing facility at unbeatable prices, and expand the possibilities of using your Spectrum in yet another direction 1111 2222 3333 4444 5555 6666 7777 888 1111 2222 3 aas 4444 5555 6666 7777 8888 1111 2222 3333 4444 5555 6666 7777 8888 FOUR Widths and TUO heights Print Utilities For 16K and 48K RAM Spectrum. .95. Increase the printing and display facilities of your ZX Spectrum with the Print Utilities program. Print Utilities enables you to enhance your programs by generating characters of eight different sizes which you can place anywhere on your screen. Alisen Maguire Beyond BASIC For 48K RAM-Spectrum. .95. Takes the agony out of assembler. Takes the mystery out of machine code. Beyond BASIC gives you a deeper insight into the workings of your ZX Spectrum. It explains what happens inside your micro when you run a program, and it teaches you simple Z80 machine code programming. A major feature of Beyond BASIC is that it enables you to write your own Z80 assembler programs then you can actually see on your screen how they affect the ZX Spectrum memory and registers.

But as you approach the mother-ship alarm bells shock you out of your relaxed mood. Turning on your scanners you see the mother-ship hovering on the edge of a Black Hole! The galactic winds whipped up by the Black Hole make it impossible for you to contact the mother-ship and tell them that you want to dock your craft. Then you discover another hazard. Your braking jets have malfunctioned. So you are going to have to attempt the docking manoeuvre without any help from the ship.

You are in command of a field gun hidden behind some trees. You must judge the speed and distance of the approaching convoy and fire at it aiming to cause as much destruction as possible. But it's not as easy as it sounds. You have to take into account the speed and distance of the approaching convoy. And there is a tricky wind blowing which could throw all your calculations out by a mile â€” literally!

"Write to Program Extra at Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London ECIR SEJ. Please mark your letters \"Program Extra\". Remember we'll pay  for any tips or short programs we print. very fast animation. This method of animation is difficult to use, you'll need to study the Q*Bert listing and the BBC manual to grasp it but I can assure you it's worth the effort. One thing the author said he would change if he had the chance is the keyboard scanning routine. Instead of using INKEY$(0) Andrew would change to INKEY-(required number) this would give the game improved keyboard response. Why not try it out when you type in the listing? his issue sees the start of a brand new feature devoted to helping you get more out of the games listings in Computer and Video Games. Program Extra is going to bring you the inside story on what makes the games in C&VG that little bit better than the rest and hopefully help you write great games programs of your own. The aim of Program Extra is to show the innovative and original ideas our programmers have used to create their stunning arcade style games. We don't want Program Extra to be a one sided affair, so we're offering  for any tips or short programs that you think might put that extra added ingredient into your fellow readers' programs. The first game to come under the scrutiny of our Program Extra supremo, Seamus St John, is Andrew Brown's excellent version of the arcade hit Q*Bert for the BBC model B computer. VIII he author of our Sharp program, Cyborg, is an old hand at writing games. Craig Shorland has already had several of his earlier efforts published. Craig reckons that the best way to write a program is to get as far away from your computer as possible! Old fashioned pen and paper are what he turns to when he begins to develop a new game. Drawing up a flow chart a kind of shopping list and computer map rolled into one is an invaluable aid when writing concise, uncluttered programs. Flow charts also give you a permanent record of what you plan to do once you forget or go a little off track. Craig says that anyone can write a good game program. All you need to do is take a little time and care to plan the program in advance. PROGRAM EXTRA ou might have imagined that Q*Bert took Andrew many weeks to perfect, but nothing could be further from the truth. The game took only two days to complete. One of the main problems that Andrew had to overcome was being able to move Q*Bert across the pyramid without actually rubbing it out. He solved this by employing the VDUS command, which appears to allow you to have to have objects in the foreground and the background. In this particular case the character Q*Bert is in the foreground bouncing across the surface of the pyramid in the background. The VDUS command also lets you create multi coloured shapes by superimposing defined characters on top of each other. Andrew got the idea for the game while playing Q*Bert in a local arcade. That evening he went home and designed the pyramid in what he called an \"exercise in programming\", and by the end of the next day the game was finished. en next month's issue Computer and Video Games will be printing a game for the Spectrum which we think rates as one of the best we've ever published. Mark White's Demolition is easily up to the standards of most commercial software. Program Extra will hopefully reveal a few of Mark's secrets! And remember Computer and Video Games is always on the lookout for new and original games. From next issue we'll be paying  to the designer of the program we decide is C&VG's Game of the Month. Each Game of the Month will get special treatment â€” including an interview with the designer in Program Extra. So get programming! 111111 Dudding BBC programmers can hat about wraps it up for this learn a lot from Andrew's game. He uses month. Except to say that if you have a very structured style of writing and his any difficulty understanding how any of program includes quite a few \"magic\" C&VGs listings work, or would like to tricks. know how to use parts of the programs One of these is clever use of the in your own games then please don't GCOL statement to produce smooth and 11 hesitate to write in.

"AT LAST, A HOME COMPUTER THAT IMPROVES WITH AGE. M5 CCL.COME COMPUTER BDO DANE OWERGEHEN ESP Z BONUS It's surprising how many firsttime relationships with a home computer go sour with age. You buy an attractive, discounted little machine so that you and the children can learn about computers Instead, you learn about its limitations: the dull graphics. The plugs that fall out. The cheap power supply: The unalterable \"beginners\" language. The stiff, fragile keys. No provision for future developments. If only you looked around a bit in the beginning... \"Qualin costs a little more, but it's usually worth paying for\" (Personal Computer NewsCGLM5 Review, June 83) The CGL M5 is designed and built by Sord, one of Japan's leading computer specialists with three main ideas in mind. First, to be easy and fun to learn and operate. Second, to be rugged enough to last through hours and hours of operation And third, to form the basis of a powerful, versatile home computer system that wont need replacing until you're ready for a dedicated business system.

"Write to me at Bug Hunter, Computer and Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ. Or 'phone me on 01-278 3881. Remember that all programs printed in the magazine are worth  to the authors. If the creators of last month's Apple program and also Atari's Missile Attack could contact me I'd like to hear from you! SOUND ADVICE Hints for the Atari still flood in thick and fast. This one comes from Adam Davis of York. He says that typing POKE 54018,52 will enable you to start the cassette recorder just by pressing play. This saves you having to type CLOAD. You can then access the heads easily for cleaning, or play music through your TV speaker. (The light program, perhaps?) VIC BEEPS Chris Bond of Selby, North Yorkshire, sent me this Vic tip which should run on any model. It will sound a beep whenever a key is pressed, similar to the Atari keyboard. This saves you having to look up to check whether the key has been registered. Once you have typed in the program and run it, you can type NEW but the beeps will continue. 10 FOR T= 0 TO 65:READ N: POKE 828+T,N: NEXT T 20 SYS 828: REM this turns on the beeps. 30 DATA 120, 169,3,141, 21, 3, 169, 73, 141, 20,3, 88, 96, 165, 197,201, 64, 208, 3, 76, 191 40 DATA 234, 120, 169,92, 141,20,3, 88, 76, 191, 234, 169, 13, 141, 14, 144, 166, 87, 232 50 DATA 169,208, 141, 12, 144, 224, 16,208, 12, 162, 0, 142, 12, 144, 120, 169, 73 60 DATA 141, 20, 3, 88, 134, 87, 76, 191,234 be interested to know why that Substrike program which which you copied from June's issue for your T199/4a didn't work. In line 1010, replace A=DIX with A=A+DIX and you should be able to move correctly. 40 FOR X=0 to 29: READ B: POKE 256+X, B: NEXT and then use SYS 256 for LOAD. BBC CHEATS BBC tips have been quite scarce in Bug Hunter, so let's remedy that with this offering from Hardy Dore of Queens Park, Bedford. Here's a way of cheating on Planetoids. If you're legal, decent, honest and truthful then don't read on. If you're not press BREAK, type PAGE=&3COO (return) and LOAD \"Plantl\" (return). When the program has loaded, enter line 150 ?&276B=&99 and then RUN. You now have 99 lives! BUGGED 'PHONE I often get telephone calls on the Bug Hunter 'phone (01-278 3881) saying \"I've checked this program through a dozen times and it still won't work.\" I inform the caller that many readers have had this game working that in most cases I've actually played it myself before it was printed but I still cannot convince the caller of his or her error. So you may be interested to read this letter from a reader in Essex \"I recently wrote to you regarding a possible bug in the Ladder Maze program. I have now found that it was my typing that was at fault. I had typed a full stop instead of a comma at line 960. Many apologies for this. Although I had checked my listing several times I had overlooked the error every time.\" See, it's not always our fault! But even so, I'll still try to help you if you call me during office hours. ZX CHEATS TOO! For ZX81 owners, if you were envious of this month's cheating exercise for the BBC, here's one just for you. It comes courtesy of D. Howie of Bedford-who tells me a way of breaking into auto-run cassettes. As to why anyone should want to stop a game from auto-running I cannot think, but here it is anyway! Simply type FAST, (N/L) and then RAND USR 836 (N/L). This is similar to LOAD. Start the tape playing and all should go smoothly. Once loaded, you can list or run the program (so he says). SUBSTRIKE â€” TEXAS It may be going back a bit, but you may ORIC-BARREL The Oric program from November's issue, Toll out the Barrel, was printed in capitals, which made a few characters look rather odd. Line 500 is confusing. It should say ... B=B-40. MANIC PHONES Many thanks to Andrew Latham for the detailed description of how to get past the telephones in Manic Miner. I'll let you know if I manage it. C&VG YEAR BOOK The Computer and Video Games Yearbook for 1984 is now on sale, but unfortunately it has not escaped the infiltration of Mal and his team. The Atari versions of Pirates and Polyps and Interstellar Intrigue both seem to be causing you lucky readers who have already got their hands on a copy some problems. If you drop us a line, enclosing an SAE, we'll put you right. The same goes for the Spectrum version of Pirates and Polyps. Please mark your envelope with the name of the program which you are interested in HORACE AND THE BUGLETS? There seems to be even more buglets creeping into professional software. Af ter Jetpac and Arcadia, here's one from Horace and the Spiders again for the Spectrum. James Mortleman writes from South Woodford, London, that if you walk backwards on the first sheet after clearing just a few of the obstacles, you will find yourself on screen 2. Useful, eh? VIC TIPS Remember that Vic tip from last time about SYS 256 being equivalent to LOAD? I know it isn't, but P. O'Connell from Whickham has sent me this routine which will allow SYS 256 to act as LOAD. 10 DATA 169, 1, 162, 1, 160, 255, 32, 186, 255 20 DATA 169, 0, 162, 255, 160, 255, 32, 189, 255 30 DATA 169, 0, 162, 255, 160, 255, 32, 213, 255, 76, 31, 19 Well, that's it for another month. Don't forget that you can always talk to me about your computer problems on 01278 3881. I've just had one of those posh answering machines fitted to the bug phone so if you are suddenly struck by a bug in the middle of the night or at the weekend you can leave me a message. You may also find that the machine is on during the day if I'm tied up with the dreaded Seventh Empire someone has to type all your moves into the computer! but leave me a message and I'll call you back. PINBALL â€” SHARP A minor bug crept into November's Pinball program for the Sharp. After the second quote marks on line 766, add a colon and then GOTO 780.

MacNiell, Fort William with 341 points; Peter Foord, Avon with 339 points and Mrs Margo McDonagh, Ireland with 338 points.

They used the letters of one hand to make several different words in the same go. MICRONET CONTEST CHl-N-O-W-1-X.).N H-I-N-O-W-I-X--N : High Adventure will be coming to the pages of Computer & Video Games next issue when we proudly present the C&VG Book of Adventure. It will be packed with reviews, features and competitions a must for experienced Adventurers and those of you thinking about taking a break from space shoot outs. The whole thing is being masterminded by C&VG's Adventure supremo Keith Campbell, and he'll be writing about the history of Adventure, reviewing games, presenting a big helping of your letters, and answering your Adventure problems. We've also managed to collar the man who has written some of the best Adventures of all timeScott Adams. He'll be revealing a few secrets and talking about his now famous series of Adventures. There will be features on writing Adventures, mapping to solve them and the play-by-mail games that keep the Post Office busy! The Book of Adventure will also include a look at the recent video-game Adventure boom plus much more. Can you afford to miss it? Demand is bound to be high for this issue of C&VGso place your order now! Meanwhile â€” within the pages of Computer & Video Games the magazine, something is stirring. All the regular features will be there plus the second in our new Program Extra series. In conjunction with our Book of Adventure we'll be starting off a special Adventure listing series for the Sharp M280k by Frank Rodney. On the games front we've uncovered an original and very addictive game for the Spectrum called Demolition. Our reviewers say it's the best game they've seen for a long time with great graphics and an even better playability rating! For Atari owners we'll be presenting a little number called Crash Landing -watch out for the flying wreckage! And, yes, Vic-20 owners, Turnip Turmoil will actually appear in our January issue. We just couldn't get them dug up in time for this issue! Meanwhile, Texas owners will be watching the skies for Paratroopers, our offering for the TI, and those of you with a Sharp could suddenly become birdwatchers if you like our listing for your machine, called Eagle. These creatures definitely don't have bird-brains! Moving on to the Dragon there will be a nifty little listing for this particular micro called Road Runner. Beep! beep! We also hope to add the ZX81, Atom â€” and, of course, the BBC B to our list for next issue. Phew! Moving on to competitions yes, we'll find room for them too we hope to be able to put up those three Coleco ADAM family computer systems on offer. Unfortunately they just couldn't make it across the Atlantic in time for this issue. Plus whatever we dream up in time to go into the issue SO don't forget to rush out to your newsagents on December 16th and grab a copy of C&VG with free Book of Adventure. You know it makes sense!

"ONLY .95 Known by some as 'getting knotted' You won't find a game for the 48K Spectrum quite like this anywhere else! Imagine yourself in a capsule hurtling through a void while leaving a trail behind you. The only manoeuvres possible are up, down, forward, left and right. How long can you survive without crashing into your own trail? As the trails build up so your reactions will need to sharpen up. To make the game that little bit more interesting we've added the complication of up to four rogue chasers that attempt to block your path. The challenge is not only to avoid the chasers and score points but to try and work out a playing strategy you won't find this easy!
