We had loads of readers phoning up saying that after hours of listening to game music with the pitch shift option going from high to low, they still couldn't get the secret game. Fools. (This one got many people at Sega particularly excited!) A slightly more subtle one this, a machine enabling any Saturn or PlayStation game to be played in link-up or split-screen mode. The Japanese advert included with the piece was made up by us, as the stupid text shows. The photo of Tom and Ed playing link-up Sega Rally was fake too, but the most obvious clue was the name at the end of the piece. Mr. Yu Bin Haad indeed!

"GH FIVE computer video games RATINGS EDITOR PAUL DAVIES Hours of intense gameplay can really ruin your eyes, you knowas our beloved Editor recently discovered. Hence the specs, recently acquired for 20p from the local market. Problem is, rather than correct Paul's failing eyesight, they appear to have unsettling effects on his personality transforming this fun-loving type into a Vicious Psycho Masher! Look at that face! Would you change channels on this man's telly without asking? Paul's favourite games Fighting Vipers, Panzer Dragoon Zwei, Resident Evil. Vampire Hunter. Super Mario RPG, Romancing Sa.Ga t's time to say good-bye to percentage ratings! This decision has been long overdue, and is so much for the better for everyone. However we appreciate that somu of you may feel a little uneasy about this revelation, so here's your bullet-point explanation as to 'why': Ever since games have been receiving scores in excess of 95%, the standard below which you the customer feels safest buying a game has been raised to an impossible degree. Why consider a 92% contender when there's a 97% alternative out there? This situation is totally unrealistic. Worse than that it's unfair to respectable developers and the people missing out on enjoying their games. Retailers are loath to consider any game which scores beneath 90% unless it carries a major license (ie FIFA) and will therefore fly off the shelf regardless. The number of times CVG has been approached to raise review scores to help games succeed is now too many. CVG is not a charity for lacklustre games, and we're not con artists. For the record: nobody here ever gave in. DEP EDITOR TOM GUISE We tried the dreaded goggles on our half-wit Dep Ed. Surprisingly they appeared to do him the world of good! Somehow stumbling into lamp posts, and tripping into the bus lane whilst out walking suits him just dandy. The girls love it. Strange that merely sporting discreet eyewear can have such a positive effect on a selfprofessed desperate soul. His gamesplaying skills have also increased by 9.769%. Amazing. Tom's favourite games Panzer Dragoon Zwei, Terra Nova, Street Fighter Zero. Doom (Ed's levels). Fighting Vipers. Dirt Dash We want you to take notice of the about the game. Typically meaning that games, not just the review scores! 75% and below is ignored, with 90-92% We're aware that many 'casual' readers raising an eyebrow, and \"okay you take one look at a given percentage forced me\" 94%+ stirring the blood and assume they have a good idea enough to warrant a read. In a multi-format magazine one system's it gets pretty pathetic when the difference games are bound to be compared to simiof a couple of percent causes an uproar. lar titles on another. A classic example Like suddenly one machine is better than being Tekken versus Virtua Fighter. While another because its game scored 93% this is quite a healthy situation where it while a competitor's' equivalent scored encourages developers to try harder, slightly more or less. Oh, please! ART EDITOR TOM COX Immediately after we placed the lids on Mr C's noz, Captain Crayon assumed the air of a nervous salesman and declared his Springtime Desktop Sale \"Now Open\" in a less-beavenue, nasal, cockerney drawl. There were quite a few offers for Tom's collection of ancient (and frankly worthless) console mags too. From Ed, who is rather sad like that. Anyway, the current offer still stands at .37 and half an orange. Tom's favourite games Wipeout, Need for Speed The quality of a game is not set subtle, but the difference is there in stone, but percentage ratings nonetheless. And when you get two would have us believe this is so. It's a games scoring 90%, which is better? case of, \"This game now wears a READ THE BLOODY REVIEW!!! badge that says 78%\", as opposed to, Percentages are far from perfect some \"We have no problem recommending magazines have even taken to revising \"Game X' to you at this time, for the their scores on a monthly basis just to reasons mentioned above.\" It's kind of accommodate the system's limitations. o you see, of the many factors that all we feel that our new system is simply have contributed to confusion, and the most honest and trustworthy around. casting a cloud over what is potenit's also the most direct, and easy to tially one of the most vibrant forms of digest. Therefore it's the most helpful. And entertainments in the world, percentagesso, here's the breakdown: have been among the most guilty. Above STAFF WRITER ED LOMAS Dear Mrs Lomas, We didn't mean it. We were only playing at the time you know how it is? Well, anyway Ed's not feeling too well now. So we've sent him home with a few games to play, because he always used to like that sort of thing. At least he did when he was here, of course we don't want to impose our standards on people such as yourself. Erm... the spectacles? Yes. Well they belong to Paul. Blame him. Ed's favourite games Panzer Dragoon Zwei, Street Fighter Zero, Quake Deathmatches, Ultimate MK3. VF2 WHAT IT ALL MEAN VE Makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end! Whenever the High Five is lit, you know this game is essential. DESIGNER JAIME SMITH Jaime was wearing this expression BEFORE we placed the glasses on him. Why? Well, if you've been keeping up to date with the magazine you'd know that this guy is totally nuts about Street Fighter Alpha. And now there's the follow up, just been installed on test in London. Wild Phil Dawsons couldn't keep him away! Of course Jaime forgot the fashion extras he was sporting, but they only amplified the detail!!! Jaime's playlist Street Fighter Alpha 2. Cutie O. Rainbow Islands EXTRA. Ultimate MK3. Street Fighter Alpha, Killer Instinct 2 Outstanding quality. Only minor limitations prevent this game from being an all-round 'must have'. Among the best money can buy for your machine. 4-VERY GOOD 00003 3-GOOD 00060 2-PRETTY BAD These games may not be innovative, or fall into everybody's notion of ideal. They are either well produced examples of common concepts, or slightly flawed workings of originality. But they are definitely worth looking at. EDITORIAL There's something fundamentally wrong with the mechanics, or the presentation lets the game down (ie it's in a foreign language). Could still keep some people happy, but we can't wholeheartedly recommend it. SKIVVY PHIL DAWSON \"THOSE ARE MY GLASSES! THOSE ARE MY GLASSES! GIVE 'EM BACK!\" Tsch! Phil has spent the entire month Ablagging himself free games and music CDs. Now he's after Paul's 20p bargain glasses. Fat chance! Especially since he now owes the suffering Tom Guise a new carpet, new sink, and new bedclothes after an especially lively night out on the yoghurt drink. Yeah! So he can wipe that stoopid grin off naaagh! Phil's favourite games Worms. Resident Evil, Street Fighter Alpha, Need for Speed, Destruction Derby 7-VERY POOR 00000 An all-round loser: We're depressed by it. The company responsible are embarrassed by it. And you could really get by a lot better without it. "

"computer games [NINTENDO 64: JUNE!] HEX01 XAS NINTENDO\" In the latest of our popular monthly updates on the Nintendo 64's release, we can tell you now that the machine's release date is set for June 23rd in Japan, with the American release stacked to follow on September 30th, and Europe in late fall. Launch games are Mario 64, Pilotwings 64, and a Chesstype game from Japanese software house SETA. This gives you two months of cold sweaty excitement to prepare for the console release of the decade perhaps. Word from an extremely reliable source says that importers in Hong Kong, who were preparing to spend big money on shipping quantities of the machine out of Japan, have given up waiting for the machine! They have been given no word that Nintendo intend releasing N64 in June at all, and are actually expecting it as late as December! First we hear one story, then we hear another.

With a capacity for 3000 visitors, who enter the complex by 'rocket escalator', the whole place is designed to look just like the Chemical Plant Zone from Sonic 2. It's set to have six main interactive rides and all the latest coin-ops, spanning its six sub-zones the Sports Arena, Flight Deck, Race Track, The Carnival, Sega kids and Combat Zone.

Basically a rehash of Japan's February By far the most impressive game, er, demo using what were undoubtedly moves planned for AOU show, minus a few key Japanese of the show in fact, the most astonishing the real game.

Skipping to the end, the biggest question was motion-captured as she performed Aois for those of us who didnt brave the everyone asks is: How much of a jump over VF 2 moves. Her stage is a pristine, snow-covered Makuhari Messe for AOU, it was worth the is it, relative to the extraordinary jump of VF 2 glade with a sparkling, icy river rushing in the trip just to see the following two things: over VF 1?

That VF 3 is a polygon game is visibly apparent no longer; the smoothness of the animation in this sequence (and, in fact, the entire demo) destroyed my verbal communication skills for at least five minutes.

"computer video games NEWS (By Midway) Before skipping to the end and realizing oooh, Slasher Quan was NOT amused by this game, first please consider the following inalienable truth: there has not yet been a real 3D fighting game. Yes, VF, Tekken, etc. are presented and displayed in 3D, but the actual fighting always takes place in 2D you have no way to act in 3D. Previously, some fighting games offered the occasional 3D move, such as Toshinden's 3D roll, but one avoidance move does not constitute true, full-blown 3D interaction. And thus, War Gods' 3D aspect is its singular, most compelling innovation/gimmick (which one it is will only be determined by the quality of its execution, which is difficult to say). Midway seems alltoo aware of this as the 3D button is a giant, backlit green button four times the size of the other buttons (reminds me of Track & Field or a redemption game). The button configuration is simple: identical to Mortal Kombat 3, except the Run button has been replaced by the 3D button. The 3D button can be thought of almost as a Shift key on a keyboard hold it down, and you can perform a whole new set of 3D actions based on commands you would use to perform 2D actions. While 2D blocking and PAGA KAUKI 30 ACME ARCADE SHOW REPORT looks uncomfortably similar to the soldiers in Stargate, CY-5, who all-too-blatantly wears a Kano type mask, Warhead, whose goggles need to go away, and Tak, a stone man who is just plain idiotic-looking. I dont want to say there isnt a chance these characters won't grow on us, but I'd be hard pressed to think of a game (maybe Bloodstorm) whose characters made a worse first impression. Based on an upgraded version of the Cruisn U.S.A hardware, War Gods pumps some powerful 3D tex ture-mapped polygons. Midway has concocted a bunch of flimsy terms to describe War Gods' alleged technical innovations, such as Digital Skin Processing (DSP), which in real terms means that the disjointedness of characters such as those in VF 2 is not visible in War Gods. This is a nice feature, but I would have preferred interesting characters with drawn/rendered textures and disjointed dodging are the same as other games, an example of bodies to stupid characters with digitized textures 3D dodging could involve holding the 3D button, Up and smooth bodies. Overall, the technical quality o or Down, and Block at the same time which would the graphics is quite high, despite the unattractive cause you to flip into or out of the background. A 2D characters.

Good 2D fighting games have awkward view shifts. layers of moves, counter moves, and counter counter War Gods' gameplay is very, very much rooted in moves; War Gods' goal is to have these layers of Mortal Kombat, at least on the surface. Many of moves both in 2D AND 3D. the techniques use the same taps as MK, and you In concept, the designers have some damn good even have the same Uppercut, Roundhouse Kick, ideas and the 3D fighting has a lot of potential. and Sweep moves activated the same way. However, my initial reaction (and the reaction of Combos can be initiated with air juggles or ground, quite literally every showgoer I asked) was that the button-chain hits yup, just like MK. But add in the poor character designs in 3D gameplay and the fight changes dramatically. War Gods would Plans call for the traditional slew of Midway probably irreparasecrets, codes, and Fatalities (here called bly damage the Sacrifices). War Gods is a game whose depth of games chances gameplay and gorefactor/codefactor could save it; for success. The III hold out hope.

The game is totally Sonic in every aspect, right down to the backgrounds Green Hill Zone, etc. Astute fans have pointed out that this game was probably derived from the Fighting Vipers engine, and a good indicator of that is there are ring boundaries just like FV (no ring-outs). With 3D backgrounds, cool warping effects, and gameplay that should (and this was obviously Sega's goal) suck in the younger crowd as well as the older VF players, I'd say Sonic The Fighters was well worth the effort. However, this in no way excuses the believe wholeheartedly: this game rules.

SEGA The rivalry between Sega and Namco, if not ever in any way acknowledged by either party, is obvious. For Namco's Ridge Racer, there was Sega's Daytona. For Sega's Virtua Fighter, there was Namco's Tekken. Now, another of what I like to (sometimes somewhat inaccurately) dub answer games is here: Sega's Virtual On, to counter Namco's Cyber Sled. Like Cyber Sled, Virtual On is an arena battle game for 1-2 players (linked) where you command a craft in a 3D arena, blasting each other with various projectiles while trying to outmaneuver each other. Virtual On has its own personality and unique gameplay elements. Most importantly, the character designs totally kicks ass. There are 8 Cyber Troopers to choose from, each with three different attacks which range from hand-to-hand types such as laser swords, to rapid-fire projectiles such as napalm, to high-impact weaponry such as mines and bombs. Normally I dont get into cyber-mechs, but these characters are sleek and very appealing. The game control is dual joystick (like Cyber Sled or even the classic Assault), with the addition of two buttons for attacks (press simultaneously for the third attack), a turbo button, and the ability to jump! Thats right, you can leap onto obstacles, jump and hover in the air, and fight while airborne. While this was an element not present in Cyber Sled (and it adds tons to the gameplay), conversely some of Cyber Sleds' finer qualities should have found a home in Virtual On. For instance, some of Sled's more complex joystick manoeuvres can't be done in Vo, and collectable items which affect radar, shields, etc. are not available. In any case, Virtual On is yet another new landmark in Model 2 graphics, featuring a variety of highly-detailed, sloping, texture-mapped surfaces such as futuristic cities and construction sites. There are many astonishing effects such as the transparent motion blur of the laser swords and the heart-stopping instant replays. Virtual On is game that must be seen and should be played, especially in the competitive two-player mode. ACME ARCADE SHOW REPORT MATER SELECT 1024-1 P  SONIC THE FIGHTERS SMEN overeen123(!

"computer video games * NEWS DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: SHADOW OVER MYSTARA 02  (By Capcom) Capcom's original D&D definitely didn't get the attention it deserved. I am still to this day enthralled by the brilliance Capcom displayed by merging most of the relevant rules of the RPG with a fantastic gameplay engine and emerging with a game that appealed to video gamers and role-players alike. The follow-up scenario to the original Tower of Doom uses the same 2D engine and a few of the same character graphics, but adds tons of new art, animation, and gameplay. There are two new character classes, thief and magic-user, and each acts as they do in the real RPG. The thief can pick locks, and the MU has the widest array of spells and is easily the most devastating character (though weak in handto-hand combat). The new campaign is much longer with many forks in the road for high replayability, and is based on actual modules created by TSR. New gameplay techniques include more Street Fighter style joystick motion moves and extended combos (even air juggles). It's a total shame this four-player simultaneous masterpiece may never be released on home systems, the original D&D was just cancelled on PlayStation...ooh, hurts like the family pet just died. Special Air Assault Force (By Sega) One of Sega's best of the show and a clear improvement over the Virtua Cop games, Gunblade NY, in my opinion, sucks more graphic juice out of the Model 2 hardware than any previous Sega game to date. This two-player gun game features a helicopter environment, where the players operate two massive, mounted, recoilable machine guns which are supposedly aboard a constantlyairborne, swooping, diving chopper. SRIER 19XX SPEED TRANSA H  PUERT LUIT om In this amazing first-person gunner, you play as the SAAF (Special Air Assault Force) on a mission to save New York City from hardcore armoured android soldiers. You choose from two missions: save the United Nations building or salvage whats left of the entire island of Manhattan. Levels include Times Square where you pulverize terrorists, Mid Town where the firefight moves to Rockefeller Center, the UN Building, and the big boss level of the Disguised Aircraft Carrier where you swoop right by the Statue of Liberty! (By Capcom) The latest in Capcom's long-running series of WW II Shooters blasts forward to the future with a gorgeous display of CPS II pushed-to-its-limit graphics. You get three crafts to choose from and a slew of powerups in explosion-laden, futuristic shooting action. The two-button gameplay now features the ability to charge your shots, but where did the traditional barrel roll go? The graphics are easily Raiden Il-caliber and the game even squeezes some new effects out of CPS II that I didnt think possible, such as scaling. 1 TOKYO WARS NBA Hangtime ACME ARCADE SHOW REPORT Your view is out of the helicopter as it flies effortlessly through the Big Apple. You'll need to take out tons of goons, cars, and other enemy craft. The way the camera zooms in and out and rotates at dizzying speeds with absolutely no break-up visible just purely shocked me surely I thought this speed was not possible based on the Virtua Cop graphic routines. The nonstop action causes so many massive, gut-wrenching explosions that you often lose track of your gun sites! Gunblade could be the definitive gun game when it is released. (By Namco) For it's next generation of the Cyber Sled archetype, Namco has completely broken the mold with a new gameplay concept and control interface. Tokyo Wars was a universal favorite of the show, and matched (if not surpassed) Sega's acclaimed Virtual On texture for texture, polygon for polygon. In the game, you're in the cockpit of a heavily-armed, futuristic tank controlled by a steering wheel, plus forward and reverse pedals. Your mission is to drive through the battlefield and take out all the enemy team's tanks, and in the link-up mode the other player can either co-operate or go head-tohead! The gameplay is superb, the wheel very responsive, and there can be dozens (literally) of tanks duelling it out without a hint of slowdown or breakup. Great job Namco! (By Midway) Designed by Midway's Mark Turmell and crew (the original creators of NBA Jam), NBA Hangtime is the real, and quite worthy, successor to NBA Jam TE. My biggest complaint must be stated up front: it was done on the same hardware as old Jam. Why oh why? The good news is all the graphics are new, the digitization is even cleaner, and the game has a ton of new features. The biggest is the ability to create your own character (costs one credit, and can be saved to the internal memory of the arcade game). You can customize your jamster with a unique uniform, facial portrait, stats distribution, and special abilities/privileges such as extra dunking power. New gameplay manoeuvres such as alley oops, hooks, spins, and lay-ups have also been added. Future editions of Hangtime will undoubtedly be produced on new, more powerful hardware with more colors per sprite, which is what I had hoped for this installment. But, I am more than content to hang with this version until the true next generation of Jam arrives. WAVE SHARK (By Konami) Owing at least some of its existence to Namcos Alpine Racer, Wave Shark is a tremendously fun waterjet racing game. Standing up, you ride a virtual jet watercraft and race against the computer. If you love Alpine Racer, this is a simulation not to be missed! (Just imagine a link version....) RIIN AND GUIN 2 (By Konami) Konami's top 3D basketball gun is back, loaded with new techniques such as alley oops, double clutches, fakes, fade-aways, and of course much smoother polygon graphics. But, still no NBA license (fake teams). THE PATH OF THE WARRIOR: ART OF FIGHTING 3 AVENGERS IN GALACTIC STORM (By SNK) The first NeoGeo game to feature computer-rendered graphics, Art of Fighting 3 is just a sad game. I personally liked (if almost loved) AOF 2 and while certain characters such as King were a bit borderline, was a total fan of characters like John, Takuma, and Mr. Big. Well, get ready for the worst news: other than Ryo and Robert. ALL of AOF 3's characters are new, and the character designs are generally really, really stupid. (AOF 3 places second in the worst character designs of the show contest only to War Gods.) For instance, couldn't contain my boredom when I saw Wang, a Chang Koehan-type lardo with a backpack, not to mention the requisite, unthrowable Big Bear/Earthquake arche type character, Wyler. (By Data East) A distinct improvement over previous Data East efforts such as Fighter's History, Avengers offers eight selectable Marvel Comics favorites (led by Captain America himself), plus four support characters who you can call on for assistance with a spe. cial move. The SGI-rendered characters are actually in Killer Instinct's league, but the backgrounds are totally flat and lack the 3D details of kl 2. The four-button action is standard SF, with fireballs, button-link combos, and limited juggling. Not bad, but not great either. SKULL (By Data East) Skull Fang is a gem of a vertical Raiden ish shooter with four planes to choose from and tons of action. The game has three buttons, including the barrel roll that should have been in 19XX1 The gameplay offers two unique control modes as well...one of the best 2D shooters in recent memory. SAAF GUN DE NEWS Setting aside the disappointing character cast, it takes patience to find bright spots among the chrome of AOF 3. I desperately hope this is an aspect of the incomplete version, but in AOF 3 the punch button occasionally activates KICKS, and vice versa. This was not due to a glitch in the button wiring but a very variety of attack frames I am praying more will be added in the final. The gameplay features new techniques such as hitting the enemy while theyre down and a much greater variety of juggling moves, and I have to say the intro and win screens are impressive in all their rendered glory. As a long-time NeoGeo fan I will hope for a significantly Improved final version, but in any case am saddened SNK's character designs have slipped to this level (especially in light of the brilliance displayed in KOF 95). JACKIE CHAN IN FISTS OF FIRE L.SE (By Kanoco) JCIFOF (I love abbreviations) is an extremely unclean (think Street Fighter: The Movie) digitized 2D fighting game starring Jackie Chan. Just in case youre unsure who the star is, Chan plays THREE of the ten selectable fighters, but with different garb and moves in each case. I always pull for Jackie Chan, but this fourbutton grain-laden fighter seems a waste of a good license. SLASHER QUAN 888 "

Look, this letters page needs to be more exciting. So from now on, you can write to specific members of the team. Just ask any of us what you want, and we'll be happy to reply. Also, we want a good name for this section, but we can't think of one. So send in some suggestions. We'll use the best one and give a prize to the sender. What's more, every time a better name comes in, we'll change it to that. So come up with something clever like, erm, Computer and Video Grams. But not that. Write to: Mailbag, Transmuter and Video Recorders, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London, EC1R 3AU. And try and be interesting, eh? Not like the stinking sack of tripe we've got this month. HELLO FROM GERMANY! ALLO FROM BELGIUM WHAT A TRAGIC MORON! Dear CVG, In issue #163 you mention that Alien Trilogy will appear on the Saturn, yet one of my friends' PSX mags says it will only appear on PlayStation and PC CD-ROM. Can you please tell me if it will appear on Saturn, and if it does will it be worth buying as I already own Alien Versus Predator on the Jaguar? And is it true that 95% of PlayStation games will appear on the Saturn I learned about this from Sega Saturn magazine. Also, please can you send me some information on how to become a reviewer as I am extremely interested. Plus I enjoy writing. Thanks for your time. Colin McKay, Germany. Dear CVG, I am confused to hear that the Ultra 64's retail price is due to be set around ... This is half the price of the Saturn when it was first launched in the UK, and still  cheaper than a PlayStation even though the Ultra 64 is more powerful than those two put together! Alright, so CDs can store a catrillion times more information than a cartridge, and they can play music and fill CDs with a special adaptor.But when you buy a games machine, all you want to do is play games. Do you agree? Also you said in a reply to a letter from Michael Landon in issue 172 that Virtua Fighter 2 is better than Tekken 2! I don't suppose you watch Games Master on Channel 4 do you? Well, anyway, they had a feature on Tekken 2 recently and it looked bloody amazing! It had this bloke who had a lion's head who done a five throw combo in under eight seconds! Now! am very confused. Luke Nardoni (very confused reader), Swindon TOM: Alien Trilogy will appear on Saturn. I don't know if it'll be worth buying, but if you're judging it against Alien Vs Predator on Jaguar, then yes, because that was old cobblers. It's possible that almost all PlayStation's games will eventually make it to Saturn, but you can't put much value in that. Namco may well convert Ridge Racer to Saturn, but even if it came out tomorrow it would be a year and half later than on PS, and still might not be much good. Rarely do games specifically designed for one console, turn out as good on another. Look at Toshinden and Wipeout. If you want a machine's best games, your best bet is to get that machine. And no, I can't send you any info on being a reviewer. Enjoying writing helps though. Hi CVG, I'll cut the crap and get straight to the point: 1. About UMKIII if Sheeva's got the Scorpion Animality, what's Scorpion's Animality? Is he going to transform himself into a drug-crazedblood-thirsty-kamikaze squirrel or what? Could you also tell me how to use his new axe? 2. When will UMKIII be available on the Super NES? 3. A while ago (it seems like ages) there was a preview about Star Fox 2. Since then we've heard nothing more about it. So what's happening? 4. When is the arcade version of the Sonic fighting game scheduled for Belgium? 5. I wonder if it would be possible to put more information about games? Hey, don't kill me now! But it would be interesting to know how many programmers have worked on a game, for how long, and what Nintendo, Sega, Sony or anyone else has invested in it. What do you guys think? And while you're at it, could you print an article on which direction to go if you are interested in a job related to computer and video games? 6. Is there going to be a good Dragon Ball Z game on Nintendo 64? Also are there any plans for 'Ultra' Metroid? 7. I really feel sympathy for you guys, having to answer some really dumb letters like the one from Michael Landon last month. Did he drink some of his mum's nail polish or what? Saturn inferior to PlayStation? I don't know. Like Darren Bagley said, it's the fun that counts. That was the beauty of the older games. To get back to what Michael Landon said, if you can tell a good machine by looking at the amount of beat 'em ups...erhh... he probably pushed the nail polish in a place where the sun doesn't shine too much! But hey, it's great to hear that ki is scheduled for the PlayStation when do we get to see Mario on there too??? If by any chance I would be honoured to be printed, for the record I didn't bribe anyone! So long. \"Weird Al\"...Erghh... Luc Van Caeyzeele, Belgium TOM: Yes, you are confused. Don't come near us. we don't want to breathe in any stupidity. EASILY HORRIFIED! GREETINGS FROM BARCELONA! Dear CVG, I have been a Nintendo addict since I was 8 years of age, and I bought every single console Nintendo has issued up to the present day. I must admit that the games available are far too expensive, and have found myself having to rent games for the weekend. This also has its disadvantages, especially when there are only a few good ones displayed on the shelves, and when games are as expensive to hire as they are to buy from bigger stores! So, I would like to know whether you know if purchasing Super NES and NES games will be such a difficult task in the future? One more thing: Do you think that Toshinden will appear on the Super NES? Dani Franc, Barcelona. Dear CVG, Recently I bought an issue of NMS, and to my horror they stated that Nintendo 64 would be released on September the 30th in the UK at the earliest. I am really annoyed about this as ! had just saved up enough money to buy one. What's the matter with Nintendo? I bet they knew that Europe would never get it by April. I'm sure there are many other eager gamers just as disappointed as myself who may seriously consider buying a PlayStation instead. Here's a few questions that I'm sure you will answer for me. 1. Is it true that the Saturn will be getting an M2-like update.. Y11611 ED: 1. No. Scorpion turns into a drug-crazedblood-thirsty-kamikaze monkey. Of course. 2. It won't, as far as we know. TOM: 3. Star Fox 2 was scrapped and the project was moved onto Nintendo 64. 4. Belgium eh? Goodness knows. When they can fit Belgian groat coin slots on the front. 5. More information on games, eh? Gee thanks for that tip, you oaf. 6. Metroid, probably yes. 7. Glad you sympathise, yours is one of the dumbest letters I've ever read. TOM: Does anyone from Britain read our mag? Anyway, yes I guess it will be more difficult purchasing NES and Super NES games in future. Especially NES games considering the machine was discontinued about a year ago. And I doubt there'll be any new Super NES titles in 3000AD. What do want Toshinden for, it's monkey piddle. 2. Will the PlayStation get a 64-bit update too? 3. I've seen Killer Instinct 2, and it looks really smart. Will the Ultra 64 version be in full 3D? 4. I've got Hexen and I think it's brill. Will the Ultra get a version of it?

I saw VF and Daytona on the Saturn, and Tekken plus Ridge Racer on the Sony machine. My impressions were the same as most peoples the Sony looked the most impressive. But as time went on coming up to official launch dates, I thought that Sega are without doubt the masters of arcade machines. And I thought that the Saturn is capable of more than what's on offer. So I opted for a Saturn, which for me has proved the right choice. My main point is this: For the last five months or so, people I know or shop staff are telling me that I should have bought a Sony. I think too many people look at the graphics and judge a game on that. There have been many games on the PlayStation that have ace graphics Toshinden, Twisted Metal, Lone Soldier (was that game actually playtested?). Most of the Saturn games that looked promising have turned out to be excellent VF2, Sega Rally, Guardian Heroes, etc. In my opinion, whatever machine you own you're in for a treat.. Both have excellent games and look like having more. I think everybody should just select the machine that suits you and stop slagging the other machine off. I hope my points are valid. I know not everyone will agree with the games I have used as examples. Anyway, what's wrong with a bit of healthy competition! Mike, South Wales HE SOUNDS ALMOST TIMID... EASILY AMAZED! Dear CVG, What I want to know is when will N64 be released over here?! Leon Garraway, Tooting TOM: Thanks for telling us what you want to know, Leon. Dear CVG, Last month I read your Doom review for the 3DO, and was amazed you gave it just 60%. I understand and agree to a point with your complaints. But even so, 60% is very harsh and I'm glad I bought your magazine after I bought the game. In my opinion you have made the mistake of comparing 3D0 Doom to PlayStation Doom, and although not as good it's still a good game. If the 3D0 version was the only version you had played (as in my case, and probably most 3DO owners) then you would not be able to compare and would give it a higher grade. Maybe 85%? Why are 3DO versions not as good as PC or PS versions, as in Doom and Alone in the Dark 2? Is it the machine or the programmers? Finally, could you please name five good 3D0 titles? I already own Need For Speed, Slam 'n' Jam, Doom, and World Cup Golf (which is crap). Neil Jackson, Pontefract A DECENT LETTER, IN COMPARISION! Dear CVG, I have a Japanese Saturn and was wondering why in some games there is part of the left side of the screen missing. Is there any way of preventing this, apart from buying a UK model? Lastly, what kind of conversion could the Saturn make of Fighting Vipers and Manx TT, if VF2 only uses 66% of the Saturn's capabilities? Jaimie Conneely, Northants TOM: I'm glad you got that out of your system, Mike. But next time could you just flush the resulting fodder away without showing us. Ta. GET BACK IN YOUR BED, GRANDPA! ED: Okay, so I've played lots of versions of Doom, and I did compare the 3DO version to the others slightly, but the fact still remains that it's atrocious the game runs so slowly that it's pretty much impossible to play, and the dreadful graphics make it impossible to see what's happening. If you're happy with it, fine, but there's no doubt that it's a really slack version of what could easily have been the 3DO's best game. If you want proof of this, try Space Hulk or Killing Time both of which are far better than Doom. It's not your machine that's crap it's the programmers. TOM: The problem you're having with your screen is quite common. It's just the way your TV reads the Japanese Saturn's signal. Some TVs are better than others at lining up the screen. There's not much you can do, short of buying a monitor that allows you to line-up the display yourself. Fighting Vipers may well be an impressive conversion, Manx TT is yet to be confirmed for Saturn. NEXT MONTH... Some good letters for a change, or we'll change this to a gardening section, no doubt called In The Growbag. BETTER OUT THAN IN! 99 Dear CVG, I consider myself an aging games player now, as going back far enough to own a crappy database console in my early teens, and progressing through VIC 20, Spectrum, C64, Amiga 600 & 1200, Mega Drive & CD, Super NES, Game Gear, Lynx, Neo Geo, 3D, and then ending with a Saturn which I no longer have. So you could say that at some stage I have owned just about every decent game system that has ever been released (excluding PC and PlayStation). My reason for writing is this: Why are Sony allowing the rights for Wipeout and Destruction Derby to be used for the Saturn? Surely this is shooting themselves in the foot, as probably the two titles the PlayStation currently has which swayed me toward the machine will now be available on a machine (Saturn) which now has some great titles Sega Rally, Virtua Cop, Virtua Fighter 2 plus the best of Sony's releases. This seems a strange move as I am now looking at rebuying a Saturn whereas before I was going for PlayStation. I would also just like to say that I think these are exciting times for the computer games industry, with great new consoles arriving and being developed all the time. But I hope they can develop more titles with gameplay to match WINS:00 MEILEENA WINS:07 PEPTIILE LE Dear CVG, I am writing this let ter because I feel that I must get this out if my system. As everybody else did, I waited with baited breath to see what Sega and Sony's machines were going to be like. The first time I actually saw them running was in the 19 "


"omputer video james 35% RPG RPG BY SQUARE CO LTD  JAPANESE VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 32MB CART COMPLETE TM SUPER NINTENDO. JULY RELEASE 1 PLAYER RELEASED BY SUPERDD PER NINTENDO MARIS RPG SUPEROD No need to hype this game at all. It is the Super Mario RPG, developed by Squaresoft for Nintendo. Yes, your SNES is still the coolest.  O O O O O O ince CVG isn't about promoting one machine, we can happily talk about everybody's games on whichever format they appear. Better than that, when a system regarded as being past its sell-by date supports a game superior to more advanced competition, we can say so. So here's how it is: Super Mario RPG is the single most impressive piece of software we have for you this month. While it may not possess the majesty of Panzer Dragoon Zwei, still nothing rivals the wholesome brilliance of this game. Here's what we know, from playing the Japanese version. Squaresoft's Awesome Super Mario RPG on SNES! A WHOLE NEW MARIO WORLD! THE MAP This combination of Super Mario World and a Square RPG is likely to surprise fans of both types of game. While the questing adheres to typical RPG routines in general, the hero party's antics within that structure are very different to what you might expect. On the other hand, players expecting Mario to have the same kind of freedom Link enjoys in the Zelda series, with Super Powers as his aid, shouldn't feel so cocky either. Before going into depth, here's basically how it goes: U LONG DISTANCE TRAVEL Covering ground when trading items with far off places is achieved by means of a classic Super Mario IV style World Map. The whole collection of islands can be viewed from afar to get an idea of scale (it's big!), or focused on individually. In doing so the many locations available are seen highlighted by spots. MARIO ROMP Players control Mario at all times, no matter how many friends he has travelling with him. Touring the Mushroom Kingdom its towns, villages, and the outlands involves Mario practising his trademark platform skills. In minor situations, familiar enemies pose exactly the same problems as in any other Mario game only in 3D! FIGHT ACTION U 1 ULTIMATE GOAL Whenever Mario engages in serious combat, the gameplay switches to a fixed battle-field scenario. Mario, and whoever he has with him, stand with their backs to the audience while the enemy squares off on the oppo site side. Exchanges between the two are taken in turns unless our heroes get lucky! In Secret of Mana players seek the Mana seeds. In Super Mario World it is Yoshi's eggs that are the prize. The goal in Super Mario RPG is to recover seven magical stars which have been taken hostage by an evil force. One so great that even spoil-sport Bowser is forced to team up with Mario against it! 20 "

"omputer video James UNDER REFURBISHMENT \"So that's what it looks like!\" Fans of the Super Mario universe, and all it contains are sure to go mental as the Mushroom Kindgom is revealed in CG rendered glory. Discovering how traditional Mario mechanics work within the new prespective is an even greater joy. Though it's tough putting the combined amazement factors across in words and static pictures (the animation is classic too) here goes: TM PER NINTENDO MARIK Look at the magnificent detail Square's artists have worked into the new Mario World! Players get to see all the famous locations in a way we could never have been thought possible a couple of years ago. Entering Mushroom City for the first time is a genuine thrill for true fans: Chatting to the locals; meeting with the King in his throne room; staying in hotels. Cool! And that's just the beginning... Jump. That's the first ability Mario makes use of to get himself off the hook his clothes hook! After switching off the light in his house and stealing 35 winks, he jumps out of bed and back into action. To save his progress Mario hops onto a Save Block. The locals in Mushroom City refuse to believe that he is the great Mario unless he jumps to prove it. Jumping solves most of Mario's problems. #EA> oh!   HELLO! JUMP! ! + TI! Squaresoft's Awesome Super Mario RPG on SNES! Mario is usually happier running about the place, unless the area is riddled with danger underfoot. Speed is gained in the same way as Super Mario World by pressing the Y button. Certain ledges require a run up before jumping to reach. An entire episode near the start of the game involves Mario giving chase, plus being fast on his feet while invincible earns bonus points. Checking for clues is done by pressing the 'Command' button (A); whether it's conversation with people, or examining impor tant objects. This is a key addition to mario's usual reportoire, allowing him to obtain useful items and learn helpful information. The Command Button is every bit as valuable to Mario as his ability to jump in this RPG. This is something completely new. 70+! D ute. <3 572.   ! 5 vagas 8.GED 22 "


"compute videc game SQUARING UP FOR BATTLE For a new RPG to gain respect it requires a worthy battle system. The one Square have developed for Super Mario RPG is quite simple, compared to their Final Fantasy series. At least, it doesn't depend on the same strategic values. It does, however, involve techniques that have never been used before. Ones that encourage players to take greater control over the outcome of every single confrontation. SUPER NINTEN FEEL NO PAIN! Timing also helps when defending against blows, again using the attack button. Just as the enemy is about to land its offensive, tap the button and chances are they'll do no damage or even miss completely! This possibility certainly encourages players to pay attention to the enemy's moves. Halving a killer assault often makes all the difference. MARIO RP DOUBLE ATTACKI  up on any given technique. As much as twice the damage of a normal attack is caused by tapping the button Just as the move is about to connect. For example: Mario uses a right hook to punch his foes in the early stages. But time the second tap just right, and Mario uppercuts with his left too! 13 7151  LEVEL UPI Squaresort 5 Awesome super mar10 Nu on JNEJ! CASH BONUS! After winning a battle, all the heroes involved receive experience points. These are used to develop their abilities in the traditional RPG manner. Once a character has gained enough experience they are advanced a Level meaning they become stronger and, in some cases, acquire new special powers. Mario doesn't receive his Fireball until Level Three, for example, In addition to experience points, victory usually rewards the heroes with coins. The bigger enemies especially drop plenty of cash when destroyed. Coins are then used to buy assistance in whichever form during the exploration or 'Field' sections. Occasionally fighters receive a small power-up freeble at the end of a fight too. Strength restoring mushrooms are the most common. FLOWER POWER! MAGICE 070DN02980 For increased tension, Square includ the Bonus Flower an icon which appears at random once an enemy is defeated. BFs empower the lucky hero with one of five helpful power ups: 'HP Max! restores health. \"Once Again!' grants another strike. 'Attack Up!' strengthens offense, while 'Defense Up! does the same for pro tection. Best of all is 'Lucky!', where players get to double or quits their experience points or coin count in a Spot the Dinosaur Egg bonus round. SIMPLE CONTROL! Each coloured button is assigned a different job: A is to attack, which may involve the use of a tool. B is to defend, or try to run away! Y summons a character's list of special attacks, and X delves into the inventory for a useful Item most often a health tonic of some sort. 291 32 LUCKY No RPG would be complete without awesome spell casting, and the magic in SMRPG is truly spectacular. It's weird too. While the blazing fire which fills the screen wouldn't look out of place in any other adventure, Mario being turned into a scarecrow perhaps would. Mallow's Lightning attack is cool, while Mario's Super Jump is just plain crazy!!! ATTACK "

It's up to Mario to help bring the thief to justice. Once on the team, Mallow puts his stormy powers to good use. Later on he learns how to read an enemy's mind to find out how strong they are.

Chino is brave, and is all <???> 171 but ready to  tackle Kominpa  alone until Mario arrives to assist. The wooden-head usues his arms as missiles, and shoots a powerful beam of magic from his wand. POWER DRESSING BUY A SNES YOU FOOL Items which improve a character's chances of survival are either obtained from shops, or handed over as rewards. Shopping is an integral part of any RPG, as is ensuring that your part is properly equipped. Bought items include special garments that dispel some magic, or increase attack power. While rewards are slightly more spectacular such as Mario's Turtle Shell which is used to kick at the enemy, or Flower Capsules that boost magic power. That's the best advice we can offer here. Of the great games due later this year, SMRPG on SNES is a definite 'must have'. If you're a games player and still don't own a 16-bit Nintendo, it's time to SORT IT OUT! In Japan there's a Money Off token printed on the packaging, so players can save about  on a Super NES. Maybe the same will happen here? More on this game with the most next month. 25 "

On Model 2 and by AM2. Chilling! Make no mistake, he's back! And not just in another Megadrive platformer. Although maybe that as well. First though, he's heading down the arcades in a fighting mood. OM FIGHTERS THE FIGHTERS The blue hedgehog is back SONIC onic the Hedgehog. Hero to millions, once upon a time. This is the sprite that sold video games to the masses, and turned a nerdy hobby into a multi-million pound worldwide craze. He was fast, he was cool, he was blue. Everyone loved him! The sound of rings being collected was instantly recognisable to anyone under the age of twenty. This hedgehog almost achieved immortality within public consciousness. But then something went wrong. New wonders. Incredible 3D graphics, arcade perfect conversions, the next generation of video gaming in your home. Sprites just weren't cool anymore. Sonic vanished and nobody missed him. In fact, people actually confessed to disliking him. And so we played our Ridge Racers and our Virtua Fighters and we loved 'em better than ever. Or so we thought. How quickly we'd forgotten the vital ingredient. Why don't the latest game machines have the same universal appeal as the simple 16-bit consoles? Because they lack character(s)! None has a champion with the charisma of Sonic the Hedgehog. And now he's back to remind us of what we've been missing. Make no mistake, this year Sonic is going to turn video games on their head just like he first did five years ago. Not just with one game. Not with two. But with THREE Sonic titles! Games are about to live again. And people are going to go mad for it! STOP PRESS!!! FIRST EVER PICTURES A BEAT 'EM UP? TITUL DAT AIN'T NOT SONIK. THE HEDGEHOG FIGHTING GAME FROM Of all the people to revive Sonic's career, who'd have thought it'd be AM2? Those purveyors of all things Virtua. But when you think about, serious as their games might initially seem, they all have a streak of madness to them. And it was from that madness that Sonic Fighters was born! As we reported in our exclusive February news piece, the game is a result of the tinkering of an AM2 programmer, who put Sonic into the Fighting Vipers code. Sega's R&D supremo, Yu Suzuki, saw the results and loved it. So he took the idea to Sonic's creator, Naka, for approval. With Sonic's Dad's enthusiastic consent, development of the game went ahead! Not in-game shots. These 3D rendered models are what the game is based around. Gives you a good idea of it all though, eh? The news of this game was a genuine last minute scoop that drove us to put stickers on the cover of issue 171. We thought it was THAT hot a story! OMING SOON The Sonic Fighting game as we first called it. And as we first saw it. Cool as it looked then, the game looks far better now! At this time, the game still used the Fighting Vipers code. GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG "


"computer video games ANIMAL CONTROL! As you'd expect from a game sprung from Fighting Vipers, Sonic Fighters uses the customary three-button VF control system one for block, one for punch and one for kick. However, the block is said to be different from that of AM2's previous beat 'em ups, being described more as a 'barrier'. We don't know exactly what this means, speculating that it could flash up a shield similar to the double-jump shield of Sonic 3. It is, however, promised to uniquely alter the gameplay. ARCADEO The blue In translating the characters from their familiar 2D sprite forms into 3D polygon fighters, it was essential to keep. Strong facial features and cool poses make these 3D fighters more lively than any Tekken or VF characters. AMY PLAYER SELECI The blue hedgehog is back SONS Ang COMING FIGHTERS HGANLIG SONIC K SONIC SONIC 1 It's the game! it's the game! Soon, we can play it! THE PLOT! Perhaps the biggest question over the feasibility of a Sonic beat 'em up is why are Sonic and his chums fighting each other? Well, here's the plot to the game. That vile scientist, Doctor Robotnik, is on another world domination bender, so once again he's constructing the dreaded Death Egg outside the orbit of Moebius. The problem is, only one woodland creature can fit in the spaceship Tails has built. So Sonic and seven animals battle it out to decide who gets in the capsule. Makes sense. 27 O O O O O OOO "

TAILS PHOWER THE UNTERS THE INTER ARCADE HE FIGHTERS AMY ROSE SONIC THE HEDGEHOG KNUCKLES THE ECHIDNA When it was revealed that Sonic was going to star in his own fighting game, speculation began over who the other characters would be. AM2 wanted a line-up that would provide variety. A speedy character, a strong one etc, but with an overall balance of skills. Whether they've managed this, remains to be seen. Nonetheless, this is the final fighting selection... unless there's a secret fighter too! SONG LUND TAILS SONIC KNUCKLES AMY Of course. And his superspin plays a multifarious part in his attack repetoire. Sonic's trusty chum, complete with helicopter tail flying powers. Useful for breaking out of a throw.

ROUND FIGHTERS 12 The blue hedgehog is back SONIC A Originally, Sonic's creator was concerned as to how the characters woud be able to fight with such big heads and small arms. The answer is... crazily! Thanks to the totally unrealistic scenario, all-manner of over-the-top moves have been included in the game. Whilst it might have a control system similar to VF, expect a game considerably more insane! Familiar backdrops from the MegaDrive games make up some of the backdrops. Look, it's the Carnival Night Zone from Sonic 3! PGGTH It's a bit unfair that Knuckles is fighting Tails. After all, he did build the space rocket. LOMING SOON What the fighters' second player colours will be is a mystery. AM2 had to consult Sonic Team to make sure they didn't destroy the characters' images. 28 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO "

BENDY FIGHTERS CINTTED Whilst the characters may have the same superdeformed look as those in the ST-V (Saturn-based coin-op) Virtua Fighter Kids, this game uses far more powerful hardware namely Model 2B. This makes for a more versatile look, with the fighters actually morphing throughout the game. For instance, when a character is hit in the face, it stretches like putty. And when Amy hits someone with her hammer, they splat! Sonic also folds up to perform his spin. Impressive stuff. CNJIS The blue hedgehog is back SONLC Ang FIGHTERS Check it out! Each character's onorgy bar is a tubo packed with gold rings. And overytime they get hit, they release a load of those rings, Just like in the Sonic MegaDrive games. Brilliant oh? Unfortunately though, you can't collect the rings back. A shame, but then If you could, the game would go on forover. A SATURN SONIC LOOK OUT FOR NEWS ON SONIC 4 â€” SOONI It's on every Saturn owner's Most Wanted list and it is being developed for Saturn! We're not talking about a conversion of the coin-op (although that is on the cards), we're talking about a proper Sonic game. Nothing much is known about it, save that Naka has put together his Sonic team for the project, and that it will be 3D in some form. Whether that means it will play the same as previous Sonics, but with 3D scenery (similar to Clockwork Knight), or whether it will have a full 3D playfield, remains to be seen. However, Japanese jouranlists who have seen the game in action claim it rivals even Mario 64 in looks'. Now that would be something. It's Mario vs Sonic all over again, just how it should be! That's right. There Is a Sonic 4 coming out. And what's more, it's coming to the MegaDrive! At least that's what Sega's release schedule for the year says. This may seem like a bizarre decision, but consider this over 500, 000 were sold in the UK alone last year. That's TWICE the total number of UK Saturns and PlayStations sold so far! Plus, there could be another reason for this move. We're just speculating here, but could a backwards-compatability convertor be planned for the Saturn? With retro-games proving so popular right now, access to the MegaDrive's superb back-catalogue would be very appealing. And what an excellent package this would make, eh?

Following on from last month's Gremlin feature, CVG has updated info on the additions made to Gremlin's Actua Soccer to turn it into Euro '96 Soccer, for release on Saturn and PC. ............................................ STADIUM ROCK romlin aro trying to replicato as much of the good stuff in Actua possible, as the game's massivo chart success testifies to the quality of chart success'testifies to the quality of the original. The last fow wooks have seen some intenso work, with programmers from other projects drafted in to help meet the deadline dictated by the start of the tournament itself. The work itself has been two-fold: on pitch action, and the presentational aspects of the Euro '96 competition. The basis of the gameplay is all Actua with a few tweaks. Noticeably, the Artificial Intelligence of the keepers is Improvod, with the help of tips from England goalio Chris Woods. Now tricks and an improved range of animations (all motion-captured) have also been added due to the extra time in development. Gremlin have made an impressive attempt to create an authentic tournament setting by rendering the six stadiums being used for the Euro '96 competition. To accurately represent the interiors of each ground, a former architect spent months photographing the buildings and pitches, taking measurements and rendering computer models. The reward for this attention to detail is a genuine sense of being there' when playing on the hallowed turf of Wembley, Anfield and St. James Park. RUSSIA 0-1 ZAMBIA VETRIC CAMERA The hottest soccer event of the year! 13:431 WORD PERFECT V.2 In the quest for the perfect commentary. Gremlin's sound engineer has substantially augmented the range of commentary from star turn, Barry Davies. The way the game sources commentary is pret, ty ingenious. At moments of dead ball' the CPU scans the disc, grabbing commentary samples from 40 groups, each relating to a situation passing, shooting, ball out of play etc. With new sets loaded frequently, there's less chance of repetitive comments. However, it was decided to ask Barry back to double the amount of comments for each group for Euro '96. Looks like that player's wee stain has bleached the grass. GOAL SCORED BY8 E. LOHATA 08:00 Euro '96 has real names. Look, Ed's scored a goal using one of thoso funny names we put on his reviews. TEAM SET UP SCOTLAND PLAY PUSSIA OO ZAMBIA QUESTION OF SPORT 04-1-5 A GAME OF TWO MACHINES! PUTE SUIS Bringing the essence of competition into the game has been more than a matter of using the team and player names. We've watched the programmers stuffing the game with facts and trivia that should prove useful on any pub machine. Call up any national team to see its historical record, plus overviews of all the participating players and locations used for the tournaments. Saturn and PC soccer fans, prepare to give yourselves a big pat on the back, as Euro '96 looks set to better the mighty Actua! How it compares to Psygnosis Power Soccer could concern those in the PC stands however. The final whistle is blown next month. 32 "

Way back in 1983, Williams blew away the cobwebs gathering around the countless Space Invaders and Galaxian clones littering the nation's arcades with a game that dropped the player on to a planet under attack where mutated aliens were kidnapping humans to add them to their forces. Yes, Defender was a true classic, and its mixture of fast shooting action, weird aliens, and hyperspace button won it instant acclaim. use their Williams their kid connections to take us e aclassic, back to the halcyon days X to play 2025 3203 LADDER Classic Williams Arcade Games on PS 150 150 BRITER 200 BONBER POD SBARNER 150 LOOK, MA, I'M ON TELLY... Now, some thirteen years after its initial release, GT have unleashed an arcade perfect conversion of Defender for the PlayStation and the Eugene Jarvis classic is joined by its sequel, and perfect copies of Joust, Robotron, Bubbles, and Sinistar. Most of the sextet will be familiar to aging arcadegoers, but for the whippersnappers amongst you the likes of Joust (where the player rides an Ostrich around a single-screen play area attempting to bump off similarly-mounted CPU players) and Sinistar (bomb-collection followed by a chase from one of the first ever end-of-level bosses) were to shape the path of today's games. Arcade Classics has been suitably updated to warrant its PlayStation release. A rendered intro sees the player drawn towards a space station bearing the Williams logo. Once inside, the D-pad is used to select which of the six games to play, and on selection the game is revealed in its entirety even down to the intro screens and clumsy logos. Alternatively, players may wallow in a bit of FMV nostalgia, as the aging programmers of the included classics detail how their games came into being. =menu WILLAME LUNCHROOM.

It's like a time-portal to another dimension. Well, it's some fancy graphics tagged onto a load of old games. But that loveable old clown, Dave Kelsall, loves 'em. Perhaps a cooler choice than the two Namco compilations, Williams Arcade Classics is still let down by a couple of inclusions. While Defender, Sinistar and Robotron are as playable as ever, and Joust rates as one of the most playable games ever Defender II and Bubbles are looking tired and repetitive by comparison. Defender Il is particularly weak as it adds little to the first game and is thus rendundant. Still, we're greatly looking forward to this one. Hopefully the finished bundle should be with us in time for review next month. Joust! Robotron. Sinister! Bubbles! 34 "

Now scheduled for a July release date, Resident Evil is now 100% complete which allows us to explain some of the finer details. Everything is awesome. : STOMACH CONTENT BOX OF TRICKS Horror comes to your PlayStation from Capcom ecently released in Japan, where it is known as Bio Hazard, Resident Evil has already proved its worth: Full marks from the weekly magazine Famicom Tsushin, and massive coverage across the board. The last version we had was incomplete, though it highlighted the undisputable quality of graphics, and superb sounds. With the finished version in our grasp we have finally experienced the intense gameplay. And we've been screaming ever since! Sadly there's still no news of a Saturn conversion, but everybody ought to take time looking over these pages. With so many key items in use at one time throughout RE, it helps that there are storage boxes found in key locations. Characters may only carry so much at a time, so the skill is to decide which are the most important at any one While the intellectual content has obviously increased, this hasn't time. As this isn't your average stopped Capcom from heating up the action.

Seems the only way to make sure they don't come back is to remove their heads! The undead Dobermans perform new tricks too, shaking their victims about by the neck like rag dolls. CLIP CLIP COMBAT KNIFE POA Exchange any item for one in the box. All-new zombie antics include spewing green slime all over their prey. It's probably acidic bile or something worse. While you're being chewed by one ghoul, his mate who you just shot in the guts decides he hasn't had enough yet! Make a certain decision in the art gallery, and these ravens take flight and give chase. One shotgun blast kills three at once. NOOSANNO You cannot imagine how convincing the animation is on these rotted hounds. Especially when they are knocked for six. Only way to be sure is to make such a mess of these fiends that they absolutely cannot function. Gets messy though. "

It's real, and it's absolutely incredible! ast month's late and slightly excited news piece simply revealed that an early test version of Quake was available. This month we cover more of the features currently available, and tell you just how good this game's going to be. Firstly, those who know nothing about it should be told that it's a bit like Doom, only greatly improved run around a 3D level with guns, shooting people and solving puzzles. Oh. The incredible follow-up to Doom! MULTI-PLAYER MASSACRE! | The other players can be turned into Boba Fett. ...or the Terminator! Get these patches now! The deathmatch test maps are currently compatible with both serial cable and network cards, allowing up to eight players at a time! We've tested the game in both modes and it's fantastic. Eight player games can be played as an all-for-one free-for-all: or with any number of teams four pairs, for example. One of the best ways to play is with two teams of four, as tactics become important as players have to look out for their team mates. On either side of this walkway Jump into it and you'll see that there's brown sludge. It's not just you can swim around. All of the a floor texture, however. graphics go wavy down here. The levels look totally solid! This stone effect is very convincing. In fact, we reckon it's real stone! It's just incredible isn't it! Real stone! TUOMING SOON There's a passageway down there which leads to the outside of the building. WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE LIKE? There's no doubt about it. Quake is going to be far more than another Doom game it's already far more than Doom. The movement of the player is more realistic than any other 3D game, and everything about it shows the years of work that's gone into it. The whole social thing of networking PCs and exchanging levels and other patches is starting up already, and there's no doubt that this is going to top charts the world over. Get ready. 0 "


"computer Video: games MONSTER MASH DEMON Though this is a deathmatch test version, there are sections of code which include enemies. Quake fans have already managed to create patch files which replace items with monsters, among other things, and here are a few enemies to look forward to. At the moment, the enemy intelligence isn't at all finished, so characters have rather strange attack patterns. There are also patches which change characters into Boba Fett or the Terminator; or add sounds from Samurai Shodown, for example, and this is a good indication of how it will be possible to customise the finished version of Quake. ROM WIZARD Crikey! Look how awesome he is! Aaaaah! FAT THING It doesn't look like a wizard, but it casts spells at you. The demon throws himself at you! We don't know his name but he sure is fat! The incredible follow-up to Doom! KNIGHT OGRE There are only small pieces of light shining through into this dark dungeon, but they make it look fantastic! This room has got some amazing-looking stairs which climb right up into the rafters. From the top looking down, you can get a real feeling of vertigo. WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR? The file you require is \"QTEST1.ZIP\". Inspect \"ftp.cdrom.com\" and look for 'idgames' to get the levels and some patches, for example. COMING SOON () NEXT MONTH START QUAKING! Next month we'll have the shareware PC version of Quake, with all the monsters and items in place. You can count on us to give you the best coverage of what is bound to become a legend in the world of video games. Phwoar! "

DARK sk anyone what the best MegaDrive RPG is and without a moment's thought they'd reply, Â«Shining Force!\". However, ask them what the best Megadrive RPG excluding Shining Force is, and after a moment's thought they'd reply, Â«Why that'd be Landstalker.\" Which is exactly the answer we're looking for, because it brings us neatly to Dark Saviour the Saturn sequel to Landstalker. Which, incidently, is also the work of the creator of Shining Force. ................................... .............................. REAL 3D POLYGON BACKDROPS! N SPIN THE VIEW TO HELP YOU! Saturn sequels to Landstalker and Thor Isometrics, my boy! That's the key to Dark Saviour. The forced 3D perspective that was the trademark of Landstalker is once again a main feature of this Saturn sequel. However, unlike with the Megadrive classic, this game doesn't use flat backdrops cleverly drawn to look like 3D. All the scenery in Dark Saviour is made up of textured polygons to create a genuine 3D environment. Why use polygons to create isometric scenery? Cos the Saturn can, that's why! But there's also another reason. One irritating symptom of the unusual perspective (and Landstalker suffered from it) is that it's so flinkin' hard to work out where everything is. Thanks to its genuine 3D scenery though, the view in Dark Saviour can be panned around to some degree, allowing you to get a better angle on the more tricky manoeuvres. You can even zoom right back to view the whole room you're in! All the foreground objects and people are sprites, so the game retains a cartoony RPG look. It might look very similar to Landstalker, but you have to see the scenery moving to appreciate the depth of the 3D. 1 Now there's a big 3D object for you. A whole ship! The plot to Dark Saviour opens with the hero looking after a caged monster during an ocean crossing. However, the monster escapes and sets the ship on fire, forcing you to find a way off before it sinks. This first ship level is the only part of the game we've explored, however it's a good demonstration of Dark Saviour's 3D environments. Go up on deck and you can look right down the length of the ship! 46 "

Then again they might say Â«Story Of Thor\", which wouldn't be an altogether bad choice, because it was a mightily impressive action-based adventure game. And now the Saturn is getting the sequel to what is possibly the third best MegaDrive game. Or the fourth. AN RPG WITH FIGHTING FLAVOUR! XO MegaDrive Thor broke from the RPG mould somewhat by putting a lot more emphasise on the fighting. In fact, the combat had more than a little of the Streets Of Rage flavour with its punching, kicking, somersault slashing action. The sequel promises more of the same hard-hitting gameplay, as you roam the land, beating, up every human and creatyre in sight. And occasionally talking to them. Saturn sequels to Landstalker ana inor MUSIC FROM MAESTRO YUZO KOSHIRO! M Yuzo Koshiro. What ever happened to him? The man behind the awesome tunes to the Streets Of Rage series, MegaDrive Shinobis and Story Of Thor? Well, he's back doing the sounds for Legend Of Thor. Part of the reason Story Of Thor had such a Streets Of Rage feel, was because Koshiro used many of the same sounds in both games. Legend Of Thor promises all-new sound effects MI together with some majestic CD tunes to accompany the action. Although from the early version of the game we've played, the music was perhaps too majestic. You feel you should be battling six-armed goddesses when you're just casually wandering through the village. A QUEST FOR ELEMENTAL POWERS! T The plot to Legend Of Thor is still something of a mystery. But as with its Megadrive predecessor, the aim is once again to search for elemental spirits (water, fire and so on) who aid you throughout the quest. With the Saturn's power behind it, some of the graphical effects of these spirits could be potentially stunning, however at the moment the game's graphics seem remarkably ordinary. MegaDrivey even.

MA s rurst rignting Game on Saturn PDD TIME SEJAY DUA When SNK set out to convert King of Fighters, they wanted to do so with all the graphics from the arcade version included. Unfortunately, with more fighters and backdrops than Capcom's SF Alpha they realised that they couldn't fit the whole game into the Saturn's 2.5 megabyte memory. To remedy this SNK include a plug-in cartridge which holds all of the game's backdrops and some of its sounds. This two megabyte \"Dual-ROM System\" ups the price considerably, but the feeling is SNK fans are willing to pay extra for a superior quality conversion. However costly, the Saturn's cartridge port being used to extend the Saturn's power is a cool prospect. 200U Henry MR BRIS sur un POW Below the bridge there lies the wreckage of a helicopter.

All thanks to the team's skill with Dolby Surround sound. 39 RACE ISSUE Je take for granted that great films are best appreciated in a cinema, with full surround sound to immerse you in the experience. That vehicles heading toward us continue to be heard once they're out of sight, and trail off somewhere behind. That before witnessing some horrible creature which the mad staring eyes of its victim are staring into, we can hear it breathing over our shoulders! Odd then that we don't demand the same kind of experience from our games. But there are those who would want to change all that. And developers Bizarre Creations, now working for COULTHARD Psygnosis, are making all the difference to their awesome F1 game 27.726 17.0 as a result. CVG paid a visit to hear what all the noise was about. ...................................................................... ALESI 40.488 HER A TOTALLY BIZARRE EXPERIENCE AIDE A ADE 39 Playstation FT & Dolby AIDE After satisfying the most immediate questions regarding F1 last month, it is essential that we now stress the sonic values of the game. Psygnosis' own Wipeout wouldn't be so cool without the atmospheric sound effects and superb music. Likewise Bizarre Creations are working hard to ensure their authentic visuals are balanced with true-to-life sounds and the correct type of music. The tuneful side of things is being handled by Psygnosis, while the sound effects along with the entire game design is all Bizarre Creations' territory. BARRICHELL 1:27.3 SCHUMACHER HILM 1:50.684 BERGER 14.8 RED HOT RIFFS FROM GUITAR GODS ODSED Cm ACIA SSIS ET Come summer, F1 fans will be rocking out to the sounds of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani, thanks to a deal made between Psygnosis and Relativity Records. Part of the reason being that the US isn't so hot on Formula One, so the licensed tracks will add to the appeal. Producer Mike Clarke met up with Joe Satriani at a gig in Manchester last December, where they discussed the choice of tracks. Turned out Joe was happy with Mike's choices Summer Song, from the album The Extremist, and Back to Shalla-Bal, from Flying in a Blue Dream. And though Steve Vai hasn't been directly consulted about the use of Juice from Alien Love Secrets, used in this context the track sounds so cool we doubt he'll complain!

"compute vider game LOCAL HERO A further twelve smokin' tunes feature the handiwork of Liverpudlian guitarist, and long-time Psygnosis associate, Stewart Ellis. Though it may seem far fetched, this guy's soloing powers are almost a match for the mighty Stateside duo. Almost. Amazing that Stewart is still working in a Liverpool Guitar Shop (Curly Music), considering his talent. Anyhow, Mike was keen to mix his cuts was real as possible\". The end result being that Stewart's stuff comes across as live and raw not soft and over produced as is usually the temptation. Why guitars? \"It's just the thing that you associate with formula one\", says Mike. \"Anyway we did the dance thing with Wipeout. To do that again would have been a bit predictable.\" Playstati ALL THE WORLD'S A SOUND STAGE INTO THE MIX Every sound you here in F1 is mixed into Dolby Surround, and Q Sound. The latter is included to benefit players who don't have the luxury of a Dolby system yet. Q Sound is clever-expanding the stereo 'image' to give the impression of a 270Â° wall, using a technique called 'Image File Planning'. Capcom and Sega use it for their coin-ops but that's another feature in itself. The full 360Â° feels-like-you're-there experience is only achievable using Dolby Surround. It's state-of-the-art, and that's one of the main reasons Psygnosis want a part of it. From a music point of view, Mike explained that mixing to Dolby proved quite tricky at first. But in the end could compare the translation to sending a signal through a reverb pedal. Just another effect. For the bigger picture, you need to understand what Bizarre have been up to. When even the sound of a Formula One engine is copyright protected, too right Bizarre wanted to make the best use of this expensive license. Research Manager Sarah is confident that the team's 3D game engine is among the best around. Plus they have benefited from access to Telemetry data of cars in the F1 league (30 sensors detailing every movement). But to convey the full impact of F1, Bizarre are practically turning your game area into an F1 circuit with 100% authentic sounds. The guy who's coding everything into Dolby is Jonathan. According to him, Â«the first thing that hits you is the incredible noise!\" (on his first visit to Silverstone). As a group of us watched, Jonathan demonstrated the Sound Stage he has created to imitate real life through the PlayStation using Dolby Surround. From a stationary position cars are heard whizzing by in front and back, to the sides, and all points in between. Jonathan's cool set-up also takes into account the distance of cars the volume and calculates the Doppler effect on each one. The Doppler effect is what you hear when a vehicle zooms past, and the pitch of the engine changes from high to low as it approaches then disappears. Admittedly this is one of the key things you notice when watching F1 transmissions on TV. As Jonathan pointed out, \"having it flat sounded so unnatural\". In pursuit of perfection, Jonathan has even recreated the noise level inside of a driver's helmet for that full immersive experience. Outside of the car there's road noise and of course the sound of crashing into a barrier is required to be painfully accurate. Bizarre are planning another trip to Silverstone, where they are securing a DAT recorder around a driver's chest to sample still more in-car effects. Incredible.

"omputer ideo james THE BIG D-EAL ayStation O In January this year, the CVG games room was outfitted with a full Dolby Surround Sound set up. The difference this has made when evaluating the latest games is unimaginable unless you're among those who're already running games through Dolby Surround at home. After all, there are some 17 million Dolby Surround decoders in use worldwide! When games that have sound encoded in Dolby are played through the Dolby system (Wing Commander III, and FIFA Soccer on 3DO and PlayStation among many others) it makes the world of difference. Surround sound turbo boosts the experience, providing you with the full effect that the programmers intended. Many games that are not Dolby encoded are enhanced too, filling the room with sound as opposed to just having it in front of you. Street Fighter Alpha is awesome, as is Wipeout and especially Panzer Dragoon Zwei. But this kind of luxury is expensive, right? Well hardly at all, considering the results. PANIS 38.0 SPENT SOUSA COUL THARD 31:29.750 SCHUMACHER 1:24.3 anndatans A81000 NOOHans DO DOLBY SURROUND Playstation F1 & Dolby DOLBY IN A NUTSHELL Surround Dolby Surround produces sound from the left, right, centre and rear. Though you have two rear speakers, they only use one signal. When it all comes together listeners are convinced that the sound they hear is happening all around as opposed to comparatively flat stereo. While most of the attention is focused on the central image (the telly!) the surround channel provides what Dolby describe as 'spatial information' atmosphere and other special effects. Cool. BUT PREFERABLY IN YOUR ROOM! GMTE Before considering a speaker set-up, your essential piece of kit to begin with is a Dolby Surround decoder. This is used in conjunction with a stereo amplifier. In fact you could even replace your current amp with one that has a decoder already built in. Currently the best kind of decoder you can buy uses something called Dolby Pro Logic, which provides better separation between the four channels especially if you intend to make use of a centre 'voice' speaker. A phone call to a popular discount Hi-Fi specialist revealed that their range of Pro Logic stereo amps started from as little as . Yes, it's that 62 "


"comput vide game POUNDS FOR POUNDS DSSIC PlayStati Okay, we're not about to pretend that quality, Dolby approved, surround systems are cheap. But they are not outrageous either, and by no means hard to come by. If you are in a position to spend roughly  on equipment at this time, or in the near future, we recommend that you seriously take the idea into consideration. Besides most people would argue that playing video games is not a prime reason for splashing out on such a luxury the majority of films recorded onto VHS for sell-through theses days are Dolby encoded, and many Satellite TV, even some terrestrial broadcasts, are in surround too. Could be that you're the youngest in the family with the paper round, or the oldest and the 'bread winner' whose pocket is going to feel the difference. But, you know, quality home entertainment equipment maintains its worth for many years. Dolby Surround may not be something your particular tribe has considered before now, but we can tell you the difference is phenomenal. Playing games, enjoying a film, or even just watching telly seems like a whole new experience. Almost as distinct as comparing a 14\" Black and White portable to your first 25\" Colour TV. More appropriately pitching mono against stereo sound. And with companies like Psygnosis now presenting the excitement of F1 into a real time video game environment, you have to ask yourself \"is now the time to make this kind of move?\" If you're serious about your home entertainment, we certainly think so!

But they're wrong! Panzer Dragoon Zwei is better! 176996 oopt. AMZER DRAGON ver the past couple of months we've gone a bit 2D game crazy. Street Fighter Alpha is currently the most popular game in our office, Guardian Heroes is one of the coolest Saturn games we've seen in a long time and even a vintage title like Darius has warmed our gaming hearts more than the production line 3D offerings that have been churned out of late. However, it takes something exceptional like Panzer Dragoon Zwei to remind us why we all went 3D nutty in the first place. Seeing this game in action is as amazing as it was first seeing Virtua Fighter on the Saturn two and a half years ago. 3D games are awesome and Panzer Dragoon Zwei is into-the-screen proof! Horizontally-scrolling, Horishmontally-scrolling. RETURN OF THE DRAGON! We've been expecting big things from Panzer 2. Groundbreaking as the first game was, it was way too linear an experience to make it a true classic. But for the sequel Team Andromeda promised much, much more. Multiple routes, a growing dragon and graphics that far exceed those of the original. And true to their word, they've delivered the goods. REVIEW ROLL THE CAMERA! 1 Aw, what a cute little fellow. 4 But this guy's got a secret. The original Panzer Dragoon had a famously brilliant Silicon Graphics intro that pushed the game from being just an amazing 3D shoot 'em up to something more akin to a movie-like epic! In equal portions Panzer Dragoon Zwei brings with it all the thrills of a blockbuster sequel! A new hero, a new dragon and a new plot, but look closely, because IT IS tied to the first game!

"compute game vided TEMPER! TEMPERI Homing laser! NOW WITH ENHANCED RADAR! Since the days of Defender, smart bombs have always been part of the shoot 'em up formula. Panzer Zwei has its own unique equivalent Beserker Mode. When unleashed, masses of yellow beams erupt from the dragon as it targets and attacks everything in sight! A beserker bar at the bottom of the screen indicates how long the attack lasts, and is charged up by normal attacks. Excellent for well-timed assaults on the horrendous end-bosses! The 360 nature of Panzer Dragoon's field of vision required a radar to match. Zwei however, has a more advanced scanner. It still shows any surrounding enemies as small blips and also indicates which direction you're facing. PLUS its quadrants now flash yellow to warn of enemies entering the area. AND you can now tell whether an enemy is above or below, thanks to some nifty arrow indicators. Aroooga! Good for precision hits on multiple enemies. But not rapid enough! Rapid shot!

Although this was probably just a by-product of the 'Virtua' view craze than a practical feature, since nobody ever made use of it. Panzer 2 doesn't have this feature, but it's not really missed. Instead, you can pan the view around a far wider area! Muchos better! 8 A Evil fat folk make dread plans. 13 Woah! Extreme close up! 10 Suddenly, a huge explosion!

REVIEW The look of this scene differs depending on your dragon's growth Between levels there are intermission scenes that further Zwei's epic plot. Surprisingly, these are created from the in-game graphics instead of being Silicon Graphics generated. There's a simple reason for this. Your dragon changes throughout the game. So rather than making a multitude of FMV scenes with different dragons, the game just puts the correct one into the intermission in real-time! The results are simply awesome! phout 1 It'd be easy to believe this is an impressive FMV scene. an impre At the end of the level your points get totalled up. The harder the path (route 3 being the hardest) the more points you get. On top of this, you get awarded technical points for your performance, and clear points for defeating the boss in a certain time. The more points you get, the greater your dragon becomes.

From there on, it's a battle against the Empire flying squad or a battle through a enemy fortress. As Admiral Ackbar would say wipe out enemy fighters, gurgle. BOSSIT EPISODE THREE The first game had a forest level, but this time you get to go under the canopy of the trees! Incredible graphics abound, as enemy ships weave in and out of the trees and a full 3D forest roof stretches out overhead! * Not something you'd like to find in your sandwich. Unless you're Admiral Ackbar. BOSS! EPISODE FIVE A strange dreamy level, with snow-like spores floating around. The tranquil surroundings though, belie a nightmare level filled with bug swarms and a monsterous flying/ swimming 'thing' that doesn't pull its punches (lasers, bolts and bombs actually). 1 The programmers of this game clearly enjoy too much seafood. BOSS! EPISODE SIX That's the whole flinkin' ship right next to you! The big ship you've been tracking throughout the game, and it's like a Super Star Destroyer. After flying through its tunnel innards, you burst out to face some strange fins. Take a look around though and you realise, the whole craft is right next to you! A trench run over the surface of the ship, kicks off this incredible level. GRAVITON BALLS?!?  FIVE WAY SHOT + MULTI LASER! DAZZLING WEAPONARY! All-new rapid shots, extra laser enhancements, ludicrously powerful beserker attacks. Mix and match for the deadliest arsenal! TORNADO | BESERKER! OUCH!! HEAVY HOMING LASER! 70 "

We ve so far found six, but we reckon there are up to ten in there! HATCHLING SATURI WINDRIDER BRIGADEWING When the first Panzer Dragoon arrived on Saturn it gave the first real demonstration of what the machine is capable of. Even now, it still looks incredible! Some people may think Panzer 2 is just more of the same, and it is with knobs on. The game is awesome! Team Andromeda have used AM2's Graphics Library to give the game a truly solid look. It's technically leagues above the original. But the pace of the game is what really boosts the appeal. Much more over-the-top levels, the want for the ultimate dragon, filling up your Pandora's Box and... the sheer intrigue of it all. This has to be THE most discussed game in the office lately, as we try to fathom how the game relates to Panzer 1. An amazing experience that leaves you feeling you've been dragged through a top action movie. Essential Saturn fodder and a total classic! Tom GUISE ARMONITE 1 This moth-like dragon seems somewhat familiar to us. Hmm. SKYDART f The most incredible dragon we've found! Seen that nosecone before though. COMMENT PLAY... THE BOX GAME!

What's more, every time you play again. you add new options to the box. Come, come, look inside. Though Panzer 2 isn't particularly hard to finish, it's one of a few games which you'll want to complete over and over. The number of hidden routes, cheats, bonuses and dragons (including an enemy boss and the pup dragon from the intro!) mean that the game has to be perfected with lots of play. As an experience, it can't be beaten. In fact, after a long session, it feels like you've just watched an incredible action movie! And one of the most action-packed action movies ever! The graphics look infinitely better than the first Panzer, and the music is timed to fit with the action perfectly, adding to the movie feeling. This is another Saturn game which MUST be owned! ED LOMAS LIFE EXIT THE ROLLING MODE! THREE-WAY SHOT! COMMENT SOUND TEST Sick-inducing 360 spinning fun, as seen in the first game. Now enjoy it again in this action-packed sequel! Why bother with this. when you can select all the tunes from the Saturn's front-end? The truth is you can't, because they aren't CD tracks! All of Zwei's bril liant tunes are actually generated by the Satum's powerful Yamaha sound chip. The reason for this is even more impressive instead of playing music off the CD during game time, the Saturn actually streams off game code! Panzer Dragoon Zwei is the first Saturn (or PlayStation) game to do this! The ritual this month has been for groups of people to crowd into the games room for a communal fix of Panzer 2. Why? Because Zwei is much more than just another Saturn release, it's a significant 32-bit event. From start to finish the experience is totally intoxicating. Nobody who has witnessed the final boss in all its glory has walked away unaffected. i was worried that this 32-bit generation would never re-capture the wonder of the all-time classics, but Zwei has completely restored my faith. These six pages ought to be enough to convince anyone that this is no ordinary game, but until you experience it for yourself it's impossible to appreciate the inner beauty.

Origin call upon Luke Skywalker to star in its most ambitious project to date, but even the powers of a Jedi Knight can only just lift Wing Commander III above mediocrity. WING COMMANDER Hollywoodbine commander is acting and es hree million dollars may be small fry to the Hollywood Big Boys, but Origin's hefty budget for the third Wing Commander instalment ensures that it offers better than unconvincing acting and equally transparent gameplay. Mark Hamill and Malcolm McDowell star. Huge mechanical puppets bring the catlike Kilrathi to life, all adding up to make Wing Commander III: The Heart of the Tiger a cinematic treat. Hell, even the plot is compelling if a little cliched. ASHORT WHILE PREVIOUS As the new pilot assigned to TCS Victory, Colonel Christopher Blair, much of the game is spent patrolling the Terran space borders in search of Kilrathi presence. This happens within minutes of leaving the \"Victory\" hangar bay. and so the eternal battle for galactic domination continues. Blair and a handful of wingmen fight small skirmishes, run escort missions and, providing all goes well, eventually push the Kilrathi back to their alien home world Kilrah. Otherwise it looks like the human race is cat food... Blair is joined by the wingman of his choice on each mission, from a selection of seven. Each reacts differently to Kilrathi attack, so choose wisely. The Kilrathi aren't all that convincing, are they. The giant-sized cats look more like Muppet outcasts than fierce alien warriors. SPOLU FOR CHO Colonel Blair's progress is shown in the full-motion video clips that link the space battles. Initially Blair is greeted with scepticism and so must prove himself both in the cockpit as well as a commander on board the TCS Victory. To win the trust of his crew mates Blair must make the right decisions throughout his career. Poor choices affect the combat performance of his wingmen, while high morale increases the pilots' will to fight against Kilrathi invaders. Play along with him... LOADOUT SELECTION EXC ALIBUR HAROP GINT: ! LOADED: a/s This gu's a loan. During conversations with other crew mates, Blair must make the right decision other wise morale aboard the Victory deteriorates. FRIEND OR FOE YPE MISSILE TAEVAL: HIGH TE BRU proceed previous next The full-motion video in Wing Commander III is excellent, with digitised actors set against smart computer-generated backdrops.  There is a choice of five ships to pilot on each mis'sion, from the cool Excalibur prototype fighter to the heavy torpedo bomber: the Longbow. I'd love to fly that ship... In addition to the cockpit view, there's a chase plane camera and the option to look at any object from any angle. Not so useful, but it looks cool. O Sweet-talking Rachel plays a vital part in the game, as she's the only crew member who can authorise Blair to fly the prototype Excalibur fighter. 72 "


"comput videi game VR WALL FILM DOGFIGHTING THE CATSU Wing Commander III stars some famous names from Hollywood. Here's a few of the faces you might recognise. The objectives of the 20-odd missions vary from simple all-out attacks, to tougher bombing runs in which the Terrans must engage the huge Kilrathi Capital ships. Piloting the ship is relatively straightforward, but use of the radio transmitter or toggling between enemy targets requires pressing various buttons simultaneously. This isn't so easy to do in the heat of a battle! TILL NEVER JOIN YOU! PlayStation RPSS 029 JUSSINS 20 TACHTEN GUN IFF MISSILE 3 COLONEL CHRISTOPHER BLAIR Blair is played by none other than Mark Hamill AKA Luke Skywalker from the Stars Wars trilogy. DROOGS. ADMIRAL TOLWYN Taking a break from being Mr Bad Guy, Malcolm McDowell is the stern-faced Admiral of the Terran fleet. Direct hits on Kilrathi craft are registered as the ship's shield flares up. A few more of those and the scum will explode in a ball of flame. As well as engaging small Kilrathi fighters, Blair must also take on the hefty transport ships. Lasers are pretty useless, so switch to missiles instead. HELLO? MCFLY ima D29 123 MANIAC Instantly recognisable as Biff from the Back to the Future trilogy, Tom Wilson is the hotshot pilot on board the TCS Victory. IFF MISSILE INDY! PALADIN Although Paladin doesn't feature in the game itself, John Rhys-Davies pops up during Wing Commander III's intro sequence. To gain clearance Ufor landing on Victory, you need to hold down various button combinations. This exercise is harder than touching down itself! RACHEL BRING ME FRESH BRAINS Chances are you don't recognise Ginger Lynn Allen, but she's starred in porn 'classics' like Bondage: A Love Story. So we're told. Although the cockpit layout of Blair's space ship is a little confusing at first, the meaning of all different dials and gauges soon becomes apparent. HOBBES Hobbes is the Kilrathi outcast who defected to the Terran Confederates. Best known for his lead role in the Kitty Kat adverts. IF I ONLY HAD THE NERVE! COMMENT With its slick cinematic visuals and aboveaverage acting, it's all too clear where the $3 million budget was spent. Wing Commander III is undoubtedly one of the best looking interactive movies with clear FMV clips, impressive cutscenes and fastmoving space combat scenes. BUT the gameplay has been overlooked. Aboard the Victory, player interaction is kept to the bare minimum, with occasional decisions affecting the morale of the crew rather than altering the course of the game directly. While the combat sections are a little more involving, the awkward control system and jerky scrolling makes them a little unplayable at times. That said, there's enough variation to ensure interest is maintained, and the compelling storyline which is riddled with plot twists throughout makes WC III considerably more enjoyable than most other interactive movies. ALEX SIMMONS Jumping to... Activate NEWS TERMINAL The TCS Victory is a huge ship, but there's only a couple of places to visit: Relax with some friendly chit-chat in the bar, or get stressed out on the bridge. The introduction sequence to Wing Commander III is excellent, detailing the Kilrathi assault on the Terran confederates. Eek! Some of the combat missions take place in the middle of asteroid fields, so watch out for massive space Blair takes one too many boulders that Kilrathi laser blasts and winds come tumbling up leaving the Victory in a steel coftowards you! fin. Better luck next time, fly boy. RATING INGU Once a PC classic, but the gameplay doesn't translate so well onto PlayStation. Even so WCIII is original and excellently produced. 73 "


"omputer rideo james SPACE ADV. BY ORIGIN  AVAILABLE APRIL  NO VERSIONS PLANNED  PLAYSTATION, PC CD-ROM PREQUELS AVAILABLE  STORAGE 6 CD  PUBLISHED BY ELECTRONIC ARTS NO : 01753 549 442 .99 (UK) 1 PLAYER ROM E8 Origin finally gets the balance right between extravagant cinematic cutscenes and absorbing gameplay with its most interactive movie to date. OWING ANDÃ‰R Ihe lights dim, the curtains drift apart and the screen flickers to life. A vast spaceship slowly glides across a sea of star-speckled darkness, the hum of its engines grumbling under the idle chit-chat of its crew. Suddenly a swarm of cloaked fighters shift into view, showering the helpless transporter in a hail of laser bolts. Within seconds the hull is ruptured and the vessel disappears in a blinding flash of light. It sounds remarkably like the opening scene of the latest Star Wars film, which is hardly surprising as Wing Commander IV has more in common with George Lucas' epic trilogy than Luke Skywalker. Following on from the commercially successful Wing Commander III, WC IV is by far Origin and Electronic Arts' most ambitious project to date. With a budget reputedly nearing $10 million, Chris Roberts returns to the director's chair to create what is arguably one the most gripping games of late. Better still, it's the first game that rightly deserves its label of an interactive movie. O SMALL SCREEN CINEMA OOT It's easy to see where Wing Commander IV s $10 million budget was spent, as the full motion video sequences are nothing short of breathtaking. The game was shot on 35mm film (rather than grainy video) using real life sets, giving Wing Commander IV a tremendous cinematic quality. Better still, player interaction during these sequences has been drastically enhanced, with Blair have greater control over his future by making more life-changing decisions at key points in the game. Mark Hamill and the other starring actors also give admirable performances, the high level of acting fleshing out the classic science fiction script. And, at long last, the Kilrathi have been dumped in favour of a more believable enemy. Thank god. Argh! Exploding in a ball of flame your wingman disappears off the shortrange radar, leaving you to battle the enemy pirates alone. MET Malcolm McDowell returns as the tough Admiral Tolwyn. Mess with this guy and you're out of the flying corps, Colonel. The impressive FMV sequences are matched by the rendered cutscenes that feature throughout. The cinematic special effects are breath-taking.. 74 "


"comput vided game O SYSTEM ALERT! To run Wing Commander IV you do need a beast of a PC. Forget anything with 486 printed on the processor, this is undoubtedly a Pentium recommended title that will push your machine to the limit. Admittedly Wing Commander IV runs on a 66MHz DX2, SVGA graphics are a definite no-go and so the benefits of higher resolution are lost. For the best results, Origin recommend a P75, stacked with 16 Megs of RAM and a nifty quad-speed drive. Oh, you'll also need at least a 16-bit soundcard to take full advantages of the game's Dolby Surround Sound. Phew... ROM Mark Hamill returns as Colonel Christopher Blair, but this time the one-time Jedi Knight and all-round good guy has a nasty evil streak. Don't mess... The full-motion video in Wing commander IV may be MPEG quality, but you'll need a monster PC to get it up and running. Like Wing Commander 3, WC IV's story is split into paths that arrive at different endings. Here Colonel Blair must choose whether to fight the knife-wielding thug or back down from his threats. .SPACED OUT Like the video sequences, the space dogfights have been greatly improved, not only in appearance but also in their variety. Play on a Pentium and the benefits of SVGA become clear. The intricately detailed spacecraft and well-defined cockpits views being more attractive and also more functional than the graphics of Wing Commander Ill. The frame-rate is surprisingly good, although when the larger ships appear, jerk-o-vision kicks in. Worse are the planetbased missions set over texture-mapped landscapes. They look staggering, but scrolling still judders even on a P133! That said, space combat is hugely enjoyable, although not as satisfying as X-Wing or TIE Fighter, both of which run comfortably on lower-end 486s. Unfortunately neither of them have WC IV's brilliant cutscenes, but then you could always buy the Star Wars movies. | COMMENT LENTODIILA Brilliant stuff. Wing Commander IV is the closest thing to the interactive movie yet, with breath-taking full-motion video sequences and some of the coolest special effects ever seen in a computer game. The acting is convincing, the plot is well structured and gripping and player interaction has been increased, giving gamers more control over Colonel Blair progress. But enough of WC IV's staggering presentation, it's the actual meat of the game that counts and thankfully its been well fed with prime gameplay. The space combat sections have been honed to perfection and are much more enjoyable to play, rivalling TIE Fighter for sheer enjoyment. The graphics have been tidied up too, the detailed SVGA ships and defined cockpit views giving the game a much-welcomed visual edge. But this level of quality comes at a cost, and to experience Wing Commander IV to the full you really do need a monster PCwe're talking a Pentium 90 minimum, but ideally a P133 before the textured landscapes glide smoothly rather scroll jerkily. If you're lucky enough to own a machine of this calibre then fine, otherwise playing Wing Commander IV is like watching a chess match in slow motion tedious and drawn-out. \"ALEX SIMMONS There are loads of internal and external camera angles to play around with all off which benefit considerably from WC IV's high-resolution graphics. The HUD and other in-cockpit dials are a lot clearer in SVGA, and amazingly the game runs fairly smoothly even on a P90. Until you fly in close to the big ships, that is... REVIEW RATING RATING Okay, Wing Commander IV may not be as interactive as some games, but where else can you find cutscenes as gorgeous as this? Unparalleled graphics, a superb script and finely-honed gameplay make this the most polished interactive experience on the PC. G 75 "

Once again with motion-captured realism, fancy shots, and commentary from a well-known TV celeb but can Adidas Power Soccer outrun FIFA and Actua? adidas adidas 'Socce n a classic example of anything you can do, I can do better' Psygnosis have stuck two fingers up at FIFA and Actua Soccer's commentary and motion-capture, and thrown both elements into a game they hope will kick the pair off the park. Developed by a French team, Adidas Power Soccer mixes elements of past football outings with several new ideas. As such, with the benefit of hindsight Gremlin, EA and Konami cannot enjoy, Adidas Power Soccer contains motion-capture throughout, incorporates special shots and moves, and enough international sides to keep Premier League fans happy. The game is viewed from a default side-on view, with the camera panning in and out intelligently and smoothly. With the four facia buttons effecting passes, lobs, and shots when pressed independently, an intelligent shot system also allows the user to pull off spontaneous volleys, bicycle kicks and diving headers by pressing two buttons at the same time â€” with the style of move determined by the height and proximity of the ball to the selected player. So, once again it is time to lace up your boots Adidas ones this time and warm up with a team Psygnosis confidently think can run Actua Soccer and FIFA '96 off the pitch. O MODUS OPERANDUS TIME 01:11 APS offers a choice of two play styles. Simulation mode offers a bare bones football game, which adheres to all the usual rules, and the most basic of passes and shots. However, the options screen also plays host to an arcade mode, and selecting this jazzes up the proceedings enormously. Using US Gold's Fever Pitch as its basis, the aforementioned button combinations replace the bicycle kicks and diving headers for aptly-named power shots and miraculous ball control skills all of which are accentuated with flames and sparkly effects to differentiate them from the norm. Using the X and O buttons, for example, unleashes a shot which burns its way across the screen, while pressing the square and circle together sends the players running across the screen at a pace more akin to 'The Benny Hill Show' than the Premier League.

"compute video games o LEAGUE ME ALONE Coon o I LIKE TO MOVE IT (MOVE IT) Power Soccer plays host to a number of national sides, with the pick of the Premier, French and German leagues on offer. As such, in the available tournaments, cup games or friendlies, it's possible for the likes of West Ham to rub shoulders with Bayern Munich, while Norwich battle it out with Paris St. Germaine. Due to license restrictions, Psygnosis are unable to use players' names (and in certain cases, team names London Highbury, anyone?), so Andy Cole has been replaced by a badly-spelt variant, but we haven't had a chance to see how they've spelt David Seaman's surname. One of the funniest things about watching Actua Soccer in action was the way the players stopped after their animation cycle had finished. Dennis Bergkamp, for example, would be winging his way towards the Brazilian goal before letting loose with a long pass â€” but as soon as the pass was made, his arms would fall to his side and he'd stop in his tracks as if his strings had been cut! In APS, the developers have maintained the motion-captured anima. tions throughout. Even if a player isn't on the ball, they hop about in the background ready to receive it, while recently-fouled players hobble away from the free kick area. This attention to detail even extends to the goalkeepers, who react extremely realistically going as far as sticking a leg out in the hope of blocking a shot if they can't get a hand to it.

Forget all past attempts at motion-capture, the movements in APS are without comparison, with players turning beautifully before launching into a number of easy to effect volleys, headers or tackles. Similarly, while the action isn't as fast as that of Actua, it hangs together as a better game, making for a tighter passing game rather than dull end-to-end runs. With icing on the cake in the form of Brian Moore's commentary, an intelligent camera system, and two play modes, Adidas Power Soccer is quite simply the new footy king. And long may it reign. STEVE MERRETT 01:48 TIME 01:38 REVIEW RATING The best soccer sim you can buy for the PC or Play Station. Though Euro 96 might sway the opinion again on PC. Funny old game! Oo!

Put the car in neutral and rev the engine up, then slam it into first gear and spin around t's the 3DO's best driving game by far, and it's also mighty fine on the PC. Now it's coming out on the PlayStation and it looks better than ever, but can it possibly do well against all of the PS's other incredible driving games? Well, The Need for Speed boasts that it's got one of the most realistic driving game engines, as well as featuring full 3D renditions of lots of expensive cars. And the crashes... BREAK IT! BREAK IT! COMMENT The best things about The Need for Speed are the spectacular crashes. In fact, it's far more fun to drive very fast and cause massive pile-ups than it is to race seriously. Once you've caused a crash, call your friends over to watch the replay and give you a rating depending on the number of cars involved and the speed of the crash. Bonus points are gained for involving police cars. The office record is seven cars, including a copper. P . PEED FEPLAY I remember the 3DO version of this when it first appeared, and how amazing it looked. Obviously, the PlayStation version has got no chance of causing such a storm, seeing as the graphics are only slightly enhanced from the original, but it's still just as much fun. The frame rate is only slightly higher than before, but it's fast enough to give an excellent impression of speed. Though the regular playing modes aren't going to last anyone forever, there's always going to be some fun to be had from driving expensive cars at ridiculous speeds, and then crashing head-on into innocent drivers! The cars apparently handle just like the real things, meaning that they take some getting used to as they don't feel like any other driving game. One problem is that it's not possible to turn the view around when you turn the car around the \"camera\" always points the same way down the track. The main downside is that it doesn't really feel like a racing game it's a casual drive around until you crash. Anyhow, though it's not one of the best games around, it's great fun especially with a bunch of friends and fast car freaks definitely won't be disappointed with it. And the music's rockin'! 6D LOMAS E= 1 HONEST EDDIE'S QUALITY AUTOMOBILES There are 10 regular cars to choose from, and they are all supposed to be totally accurate in their handling. As well as being able to drive the cars, players can watch film of each of them driving about very fast, as well as reading pages and pages of statistics. Fans of the cars will adore this SRRE MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT An added bonus is that it's possible to choose the time of day at which you want to race. Choose from Morning, Midday or Evening, though there are variations on each of these available by playing on the three stage courses, as it gets further though the day as the race goes on.

In fact, it was considered by many to be as near to perfection as possible, and lots of people still think that to be true. It was also thought that Wipeout would always stay a PlayStation-only game, seeing as Psygnosis are so closely linked with Sony, but it's really here. On Saturn. 05. 00:00.0 POSITION 33 OO.Sua OO . 3nozom O-OST. OO:04 *THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE As much as Saturn Wipeout should be taken as a game on its own, it's still a conversion of the PS original. Also, there aren't just differences in the graphics parts of the game play slightly differently, too. Other than these things don't worry.

It's more like flying a plane. on the Saturn, the missiles look weird because the smoke is made up of speckled white rings. 82 "


"computer video games SEVEN COURSE MEAL J BOOMBASTIC! There are six main courses on which to compete in Wipeout, as well as the special bonus track, Firestar. The regular racing class is \"Venom\", but the \"Rapier\" mode can be accessed once the championship has been won. This doesn't just make the game harder it makes it faster, as well as changing the appearance of the track by altering the time of day and adding some other lighting effects. POSITION One of the coolest things about PlayStation Wipeout was the music. The Saturn version's got all of the brill music which was done in-house (Cold Storage), but the Chemical Brothers, Orbital and Leftfield tracks have been replaced. One of the new tracks is good and it blends into the game well, but the other two are a bit poop.

SILVERSTREAM SILVERSTREAM I bought my PlayStation on the day of release just for Wipeout, and I think it's still one of the best games going. The biggest problem for the Saturn version is that it's going to be compared to the PlayStation game so much, and that's where it's going to lose out. Everything is worse than it was, most noticeably the useless handling of the ship it really is a rough conversion of an excellent game. The actual racing's very fast faster than the PS version, though the jerky frame rate makes it tricky to see what's going on. Also, the handling's changed but the courses haven't, ruining the perfect difficulty curve. For example, when flying in the Feisar (Sharpest steer ing) on the Silverstream course, it's not possible to get around the course without hitting the edge, therefore it's VERY FRUSTRATING! However, there are lots of people who haven't played Wipeout before and they'll think that this is great. But those hoping for the PS game on their Saturn will be disappointed. Sorry, but it's true.

Watch out though, one of them could be a traitor! I've been waiting for a good 3D robot battle game to come out ever since the impressive-for-the-time Battlecorp on Mega-CD. Krazy Ivan certainly wasn't it, and just when an excellent offering in the form of Gun Griffon on the Saturn arrives, I get totally distracted by Terra Nova. It's excellent! The programmers have obviously always wanted to roam around in high-power battle armour, because they've included everything you could possibly want n a real robot warsuit. Masses of deadly weaponary on the arms, excellent hydraulic jumping power, drones, multiple cameras and running power. And it's not complex to control at all. I'm not a big fan of PC sims' that use a million keys fortunately Terra Nova is extremely simple and obvious to pilot. What's more, ordering your troops around getting them to clear the area, repair your suit, head for targets is excellent. You can even do it on the fly, and you need to, because the missions really are warzone madness!

Anti-gravity hi-speed laser death in Descent 2! CENT I escent has become a classic PC game. It was placed alongside Doom as the greatest 3D shoot 'em up available, and many people feel that it's THE best available. Now that Quake is on the way with a similarly 3D game engine, Descent 2 is released. Is it enough to keep it near the top of the heap? Just don't forget your sick sacks. TONKIE THE HELPFUL ROBO PAL! LESCENTE One of the more major enhancements to Descent 2 is the new GuideBot. He's contained in a cage somewhere in each of the regular levels, and when released will search out any items you request. For example, if you're desperate for a shield power-up, bring up his list of commands and send him off in search of one. He can also find enemy robots, hostages, the exit, the reactor anything! INTRIGUING NEW ITEMS Some of the new items and weapons available to Descent 2 pilots are really clever. The Energy-to-Shield Convertor, ENERGY TO SHIELD for example, which transfers any energy in excess of 100 to the ship's shield unit. As well as this there are headlights, afterburners (a bit like having a \"run\" button), a new Super Laser (up to level 6), a Gauss Cannon (powerful Vulcan Cannon), Omega Cannon (mega powerful), Phoenix Cannon (bouncing shots), Helix Cannon (mega Spreadfire). There are also loads more missiles and bombs, giving pilots a better chance against the all-new enemies. JARRI LITTLE DROID LOST Det er MEILE \"AFTERBURNER HEADLIGHT Markers can be dropped anywhere is a level, and a line of text describing the area can be left with each one.

The total-3D game engine is still one of the most impressive around, and the feeling of complete immersion into the game is fantastic. Descent 2 is very easy for players of the original to get into, seeing as the control and style of the game is identical, but the new features become apparent straight away. The GuideBot is an excellent idea, although it's not that useful at the start of the game, unlike the incredible new super weapons! Though it's not a particularly bad thing, the game is pretty much identical to Descent, and with the number of homemade levels available for the original on the internet, Descent 2 doesn't seem quite so worthwhile. The new features make up for this, however, with lots of things which weren't possible in the first game. The multi-player mode of Descent was one of the best parts of the game, and a load of enhancements to this area make Descent 2 worthwhile for network players. The original's got a massive following and Descent 2 will appeal to all of them instantly, but some people may want a bit more from a sequel. I don't it's brilliant. 8 A$ Get the top score and enter a quote!! Wow!! CREVIEW ...which makes the level all dark, like. Brill! RATING While it's not a massive change from the original.

Also, the game's presented by Steve Davis so there's lots of interesting film of him playing snooker, as well as lots of tips on how to play the game. The biggest problem with Virtual Snooker is that it's totally identical to Virtual Pool even down to the one annoying fault with that game: When the cue ball is on the cushion, players can still put backspin on the ball by hitting though the cushion.

The best part of Duke Nukem is that the first versions were put on the internet and players were asked to suggest ways in which it could be improved, and the results show! Plenty of extra features, like a view from behind the player, mouse aiming and loads of excellent multi-player modes mean that it's an excellent game for Doom fans who want something other than Quake. The high resolution graphics are a lot more advanced than Doom's, but without being so advanced that they need an extra-powerful PC to run them at a sensible speed there aren't the floors-above-floors which slow games down a lot. Since the very early version (which was reviewed by some people), the shotgun has been completly redesigned, as we said it would, and now looks like a rock-hard death gun rather than a grey banana.

The courts are all reflective, like the PlayStation's Total NBA, and the actual sports hall looks better than that game but the downside is the characters. They are all sprites, making them look slightly out of place on the 3D court, and they're not particularly detailed either. The game plays fairly well, using a concise three-button control system, though the players don't do quite as much as they should.

Instead of the Iguana, Atari gets High Voltage, who seem to have attended the same music college as Miracle Design (Atari Karts) ie bad. Plus the graphics are little better than 16-bit. While the gameplay escapes largely unscathed, it's none too smooth either. Despite the promises made on the back of the box, this is not arcade-quality. For that you should look to the PlayStation.

Alone 2, originally released in 1993, is more action-based than the first adventure. Central character Ed Canby is immediately confronted by a bunch of bogeymen, armed to the teeth with murderous intent. While Ed is busy taking care of those-equipping himself with guns discovered as he patrols a spooky mansion (sound familiar) there is the mystery of Jack the Pirate to solve. Conundrums are intriguing, the plot is involving, but the gameplay is showing its age. Ed moves slow, and is clumsy to control. The applied textures are scruffy-looking, and the music is quite dreadful in places. Some players may find the storyline worth the trouble, but three years down the line, AITD2 struggles.

Madness when you consider they have the greatest 3D beat 'em up in the form of VF2. Toshinden was an interesting title when it was first released on PS at the end of 1994, due to its impressive textured 3D. But when we reviewed the Saturn version on import a few months back, it was clearly put in its place. Even if the graphics on Saturn version matched those of the PS (which they don't) it still has poor gameplay. This was really drummed home to us when we got to grips with Toshinden 2, which suffered from the same laborious limited feel. We weren't honest when we gave Toshinden S 76%, especially considering the alternatives available. So lets redress the balance: Toshinden S isn't awful, it's just no good.

That's the first thing anyone will think when they play this game. The graphics and style of are almost identical, and they come out pretty even with one another in terms of game play. All of the characters and enemies are excellently animated, and they're all made from rendered 3D models, meaning that they look very realistic. The sound effects are worth mentioning, as they add lots to the already brilliant atmosphere. Some of the puzzles are a bit obscure, but, like Flashback and Prince of Persia, they can all be overcome with a bit of thought. The control of the main character is excellent, and after only a few minutes of play, it's possible to make him do just about anything without thinking about it. The game is very big and there's always something happening, unlike many other games like this. This is an excellent buy.

We haven't given a complete walk through guide, nor have we featured each level, as most of the game itself is pretty self-explanatory. STORY o MEGADRIVE CHEATS Before we begin, here are a few cheats for the MEGA DRIVE version that you may be interested in If you don't want to play the game all the way through normally. PRESS START Tips STORY LEVEL SKIP On the title screen type ABRACADABRA, you should hear a 'YEE HAAR!' sound telling you that the cheat has been activated. Start the game, If you wish to skip the level press START and A. INVINCIBILITY To activate the Invincibility cheat, collect seven stars on the second stage and then Jump Into the toy box and press down for 10 seconds. 96 "


"computer Video games  LEVEL TIPS... LEVEL ONE: RED ALERT o LEVEL THREE: THE CLAW 095 040 PRIVE To gather the last of the stars, wait for the crane to pull the bucket up, jump on to the the bucket and then jump up to grab the final set of stars. To stop Sid from grabbing Buzz, you must use your pull string to hit the toy aliens at the claw. The best way of doing this is to throw two aliens up,then hit them again whilst jumping. By doing this you will hit them higher in the air, giving you more chance of hitting the claw. The first time Sid grabs Buzz with the claw, stay to the right of the claw and hit the toys left. After this stay to the left of the claw and hit the toys right. SUPER NINTENDO O LEVEL ONE: WOODY'S NIGHTMARE To easiest way to defeat Buzz in your nightmare is to dispose of the rotating globes around Buzz using Woody's pull-string. Then stand on one of the blocks and wait for him to appear, avoiding his laser then hit him repeatedly with the pull-string. REE LEVEL TWO: 2nd ENCOUNTER WITH A BUZZ To capture Buzz using the tyre, first hit it using the pull-string, then hit it again to launch it into the air. Keep on moving the tyre towards Buzz and eventually you'll capture him. Be careful once you do catch him because he'll fly around the screen trying to hit you. The best way of avoiding him is to keep running under him. STORY TOY  LEVEL FIVE: LIGHT MY FIRE LEVEL THREE: INSIDE THE CLAW MACHINE At this point in the level, you have the opportunity to collect a hidden life. To do this you must travel past the Continue flag, and jump left inside the wall. Move upwards to the platform above to find a hidden life.  LEVEL THREE: INSIDE THE CLAW FIND THE ALIENS On this level you must find your alien friends and deposit them in the holding bin. The first four aliens are easy to find and the holding bin is easily accessible. The rest of the aliens are through a door in another chamber. We've included a grab of the door so you know what you're looking for. Place your buddy in the holding bin. Svoreno TIPS This is what the second chamber looks like. From here, move forwards and take the first right. You will find a door, and behind this is a hidden drop off point, use this to deposit the remaining aliens. This stage is pretty straightforward, but the level requires good driving skills if you wish to make it to the last level. \"Once you start moving you'll encounter an island in front of you, take the right hand side as this is the easiest route to manoeuvre round. To reach the goal, follow the stars as best you can, as these lead you away from trouble. 1 A door, WOW! what a caption. 97 "

ON LEVEL apcom has once again proven without a shadow of a doubt that it is the king of fighting games. While VF3 is the class of 3D fighting game graphics, Street Fighter Alpha 2 is (as every new SF game ends up being) the new definitive benchmark in 2D fighting game graphics and all-around fighting gameplay. I am ecstatic that Capcom took the time and care to revise original Alpha (which, while great, could have benefited from at least better backgrounds), into the multi-faceted, gleaming crown jewel that is Alpha 2. What is most amazing about Alpha 2 is that it is not a simple upgrade. Many Capcom follow-ups tend to feature slight reworking of the graphics, balancing, and a limited number of new characters. Take for instance Night Warriors. Well, Street Fighter Alpha 2 easily stands as the most thorough revision Capcom has ever done of an existing game engine, offering in nearly all departments more new than in any previous follow-up game.

"PLAYER England NA SV First off, a massive total of 18 characters now grace Alpha 2's select screen. All 13 of the original Alpha fighters are present (no codes required for Dan, Akuma, or Bison). The five new charac ters are: Sakura, Rolento, Gen, Dhalsim, and Zangief...lets examine them in detail: NEXT BIRO SAKURA GEN SAKURA MANTIS CRANE My personal favorite of the whole crew is Sakura, a teenaged schoolgirl who seems to have the outfit and body type of a character from the Japanese 'Sailor Moon' anime series. However, almost wonder if Ryu jumped in an enchanted lake (Ranma Inside joke), because Sakura's face and hair are a female equivalent of Ryu. In fact, Sakura admires Ryu so much she hopes someday to train with him. But for now, bored with school gymnastics, she has entered the Street Fighter tournament using some techniques modeled after Ryu's. She has a running Dragon Punch, three varieties of fireballs, and a unique, acrobatic style of Hurricane Kick. Her Supers include a super fireball, a super running Dragon Punch, and an awesome slide-kick attack (the first Super in all of Street Fighter to hit low a huge advantage). She is extraordinarily cute and an instant crowd hit! GEN Gen is an elderly Chinese master, back from Street Fighter I, who uses TWO unique fighting styles. That's right, you can swap between them in midfight, and each one features its own basic attack, special move, and Super Combo animations! In Mantis mode he has a ground rolling attack, an offthe-wall-leap, and a Super rising air throw. In Crane mode he uses a Honda-like hundred hand whack, a rising kick (a sort of leg uppercut), and two Supers: a dashing, slicing punch, and the incredibly unique Hand of Death which, if it connects, causes a timer to appear over the opponents head. If the enemy cant retallate with a solid blow before the timer runs out, they get dizzy! AITAN STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 2 EXCLUSIVE ACME REPORT! SAKURA ROLENTO DHALSIM ZANGIEF ROLENTO DHALSIM AND ZANGIEF ROBO Next up is Rolento, the little-seen boss of Level 4 from Final Fight (the one that was cut from the SNES version). Better jog your memory, Rolento is quite the bad-ass, a nimble character with devastating moves...while one might initially compare his speed to Vega, he plays with a style all his own. He can fly off the wall, roll ultra-fast, throw knives in the air, and swing his baton In a three-strike sequence, somewhat reminiscent of Fei Longs Rekka Ken. His Supers include a defensive grenade toss where he drops multiple grenades as he rolls away (they juggle you in the alr!), and an amazing chain grab which requires the help of his knife-wielding, grinning buds who hang onto the rafters of his stage. His win/lose poses are hilarious, and he either blows up the opponent or demolishes himself with his patented grenades! Finally, lets turn to Zangief and Dhalsim. Returning from SSF Il Turbo, these characters are largely unchanged...a few new moves, animations, etc, but generally they're the same as they were in SSF Il Turbo. Both of their new Supers are rising air throws similar to Rose's Super air throw (strange, huh?). Other additions include Dhalsim's ability to teleport while in the air, Dhalsim's new standing Short, a new Uppercut motion for Zangief's Banishing Punch, and some range adjustments on Zangief's SPD. One point is that if you thought Zangief's Final Atomic Buster was devastating in SSF Il Turbo, get ready for some truly obscene damage at Level 3.... Personally I would have preferred either all-new, or other SFI/Final Fight characters Instead of bringing back Zangief and Dhalsim, but fans who missed these warriors in original Alpha will be quite pleased. 101 "


"Computer video James 2258 ADON VINI REVISIONS TO EXISTING CHARACTERS TIME The next obvious question after new characters would have to be adjustments to old characters. And there are quite a few. Here's a rundown of the new moves/balance alterations (and please keep in mind this is based on the preliminary version so certain items could change for the final): Ryu has a fake Fireball; Ken has a fake Hurricane Kick; Chun-Li's Fireball is now a motion instead of a charge and (at least in the test version) her low Forward has been sped up to become a lethal weapon of epic proportions; Charlie has less recovery time after his Sonic Boom (maybe halfway inbetween old Alpha and the no-recovery time of classic Guile), which enables him to more effectively keep out oppo nents with Sonic Boom/crouching Fierce patterns; Guy has a new dashing Elbow punch and, despite the removal of most chain combos (which severely curtails his style from old Alpha), retains his Bushin Hell Chain Fist combo; Birdie has a flaming animation to his Bull Head and a new triple-slam grab to complement his old Murderer Chain; Sodom (of course) lost his cheap, unblockable Roundhouse but has gained an easier motion for his Butsumetsu Buster and MUCH greater range for the Omega Slam; Rose picks up a dashing shawl attack; Adon's special attacks now feature much easier, more intuitive motions increasing his effectiveness greatly); Sagat gains insanely improved foot speed and two-in-ones he desperately needed (such as low Forward and standing Roundhouse); Bison has quicker reaction time off a Knee Press, Akuma's air fireballs are angled to more effectively counter sliding opponents, and last (and least?), loser of the year Dan has gained the most new stuff, including a ton of new animations for basic attacks, and a new knee animation for the first hit of his Flurry Kick! EL STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 2 EXCLUSIVE ACME REPORT! Sodom demos his sliding Alpha counter with style. Chain combos no longer form the basis of Guy's tactics.

"2300 3000186 DHALSIM compute vides games DARLSTA ZANGIEF D HALSIM BIZANGIEF GEN SAKURA CUSTOM BACKDROPS FOR ALL CHARAS Ryu is back in Japan, fighting on a snow bank in front of his dojo. Ken's stage (which everyone universally acknowledges as the coolest stage of all time in any video game) is a birthday party for at-the-time girlfriend Eliza, with lots of Capcom characters hanging around the punch bowl, hot tub, etc. (See how many you can name!) Chun-Li's backdrop is a China street, where hordes of bicyclists whiz by. (Remember the individual bikers from Chun's old SF II stage? They must have all gotten together for a race!) Charlie's stage features an awesome fighter plane which hovers on the power of its jet engines, with cool neon signs flashing in the backdrop (Megaman freaks, look for the Dr. Wily insignia). Guy's Metro City street collects all the coolest Final Fight characters, such as Cody, Andore, Jessica, and my favourite MISURA 42 rento SAKURA ROLENTO with Sodom's face painted on the side. Birdie's stage is very reminiscent of the Final Fight toilet area, with punks plastered to the urinals while they watch the fight (those who are weak at the stomach might want to avert their eyes when the stall doors open, it's not a pretty picture). Rose's level is a picturesque waterfront scene in Italy. Adon's level is straight from Street Fighter I, a line-scrolling marshy Thailand swamp. Sagat's, of course, features the traditional statue, but from yet another perspective. Bison's level takes place in front of his flying fortress straight from the Japanese SF anime move. Akuma's level is one of the coolest, a subterranean cave shrine packed with Akuma statues. Dan's stage takes place in a Hong Kong street market, with Fei Long looking on in the background. Sakura's stage is (in my and many other anime fans' opinions) a shocking replica of Ranma's home. and the cutest thing is a little kid playing Famicom in the background. Rolento's level is an update of his Final Fight stage and features a scrolling, open air elevator in a con struction site with Metro City's skyline zooming by in the background. Gen's stage is straight from SF I, a darkened, rain-splattered city street in China. Zangief's level, of course, is a remake of his SF Il Russian factory. And Dhalsim's stage is an outdoor Indian preserve with his trademark elephants carousing in the backdrop. All, repeat, ALL the backgrounds are new. Its hard to justify the fact that, except for minor reworking of objects no and colours, many of the bgs in original Alpha were shared by G two or more charac ters (inexcusably Sagat, Dan, and Adon all had the same bg). Not only that, but the backgrounds were generally bereft of the personality that characterized the bgs from the original SF II games. Well, Alpha 2 comes through in spades with a unique bg for each fighter, and each one is intertwined with the personality/backstory of each character. Eighteen bgs is a lot to discuss, but I know you SF mental cases must know about them all, so BEHOLD!!!

Sodom's stage is a big truck OTTO KURA SODOM SODOM SAKURA Brrr LEVEL SUPER GOriBU FINISI 11000pls The personality of the backgrounds is found not just in the scenery, but in the incredibly minute details and character animations. For instance, many levels have cheering sections, or characters who are animated in reaction to the fight. In India, a lady claps every time Dhalsim connects, and hides her eyes whenever Dhalsim suffers a hit.

GEN GUY he passes by, and return to an 'atease' position while communicating on their radios when Bison leaves their vicinity. Another crucially important aspect of all the backgrounds is the return of the parallax, or multiscrolling feature (three to five layers of graphics in every background), as well as line-scrolling (responsible for the warping effect that turned so many heads in original SF II). Both of these essential 2D graphic effects are now utilized to the max. There are even effects that I didnt think possible from Capcom's aging CPS II hardware, such as a gorgeous, line-scrolling lens flare (i.e. the blazing light distortion one would see when a sun beam directly strikes a broadcast camera) in Bison's stage.

On top of new backgrounds and new characters, Alpha 2 offers yet another astonishing new feature: the Custom Combo. Upon activa tion, players can string together nearly ANY combination of regular, special, and super moves to create their own combo! Custom Combos offer a momentary win dow of invincibility similar to the traditional Super Combos, and can also be used to suck the enemy in if they are vulnerable. One truly amazing aspect is that Custom animation frames are not necessarily the same as the corresponding normal attack frame, which means in a few cases there are NEW FRAMES for you to discover as you experiment with Customs! Added to Supers and Alpha Counters, Customs add another dimension to the strategy of how and when to best use the Super meter. SMASH ME TIME 47809 WWOP OOFFL HIHING! STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 2 EXCLUSIVE ACME REPORT! KICK!! GENERAL GAMEPLAY CHECK NL2U DM Solid SAKURA ZANGIEF SUZANGJEF SODOH Taking a look at the rest of Alpha 2's gameplay picture, there are quite a few other changes. In a shocking decision, Capcom has elected to remove the vast majority of old Alpha's Chain Combos (where you could two-in-one normal attacks into other normal attacks, such as Ryu/Ken's low Short, low Forward, low Roundhouse chain). Now only a select few characters such as Gen possess a large arsenal of chains. Most expert players seem pleased by this decision, as it adds more skill to combos and seems to have eliminated Ken's roll trap. Another big change is that each character now has two Alpha Counters (one with punch and one with kick). Also, players can now roll forwards or backwards (six rolls in total one for each of the buttons). Pretty little Sakura beats the crap out of the towering Russian wrestler. Interesting situation here, as Sodom misses his chance and... So does Zanglefill 35100 IATA 69300 us 49900 A RINGING IN YOUR EARS OHAUSI ADON On the subject of sound, the old tunes are the same albeit with a few different instruments. The new characters music is not just up to the superior standard of old Alpha's music, it totally shatters it. Sakura's level qualifies for the Top 5 stage songs of all time. In a move that totally blew me away, Capcom chose to re-record nearly all the voices only a few characters such as Ryu retain their original samples. While nitpickers (myself included) might point out that a few samples here and there took a turn for the worse in coolness (such as Chun-Li's Kikosho), I am more than happy with the voice samples as a whole. Zangief's rousing Final Atomic Buster is at least as cool as Bisons old Psycho Crushaa. Why worry about Adon's Super Combo when you can just vanish out of harm's way! 104 "


"JUDU BEYOND THE ULTIMATE Comput vide gane DAN There are plenty of other little refinements throughout Alpha 2. Look for many random new animation frames, such as Rose's gorgeous new win pose where she slips behind a giant tarot card and emerges clad in her Alpha's World dress tarot deck in hand! (She is a fortune teller, you know.) Remember the win icons such as P, V, S, etc? Well, there are now PERSONALIZED win icons to indicate a victory by Custom Combo, such as a bracelet for Chun-Li and a grenade for Rolento. The new intro is unquestionably the greatest hand-drawn cinematic sequence of all time, depicting all the characters (some separately, some in a group collage).

However, Alpha 2 appears in good position to make its claim as the best Street Fighter, and best fighting game in general, ever. Alpha 2 should be out by the time this issue hits the stands.

Number seven for PlayStation isn't due until December this year, so details are scarce. However the news is so big, already a number of questions are being raised. While we attempt to answer most of them, gaze upon this awesome game which promises to play better than it looks.

We have never seen anything like it! be viewed from any distance at any angle. First of all, the question is raised whether Square have abandoned Nintendo altogether. Why make the move? In an interview with Japanese magazine The PlayStation, President of Square LA Mr Hironobu Sakaguchi gave this reply: \"It is the volume of data needed to portray this information which is an indispensable element. We need as much data as possible to achieve our aims. There is at present a variety of hardware for CD-ROM, from the personal computer up, out of which we were looking for the one which will give us conditions for creating the games we want. Our conclusion is that the PlayStation is the right machine\". So this really is a matter of storage. In the case of Nintendo 64 its initial cartridge-based system is too limiting for Square's product. Hopefully the advent of the Bulky Drive, to which Enix have already commited as developers, will attract Square to that format. Basically you could say that Square are keeping their options open. According to Mr Sakaguchi, Â«We (Square) have been looking constantly at the hardware of all companies, not just the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. But we have concluded that at the moment there is nothing else but the PS. However this won't continue forever, and we may use others if our plans fit their characteristics.\" The Pyramid is thought to be a dungeon, and the hero 'Cloud' is preparing to cross the bridge and brave its depths. Check out the mist effect. Believe it or not, this scene is lifted from the game proper. It's not a CG representation you control that character. This is FFVII!

Take time out to marvel at the impossible majesty of this creature, in a 'mere' game! SQUARE-SHAPED FUTURE After Treasure Hunter G is released for the Super Famicom (SNES) in Japan this April, Square will no longer publish games on the 16-bit Nintendo. From now on the company is looking to create versions of their classic SNES releases for Windows '95 on PC CD-ROM in the US, while continuing their most popular sagas on PlayStation: Romancing Sa.Ga, Legend of the Sacred Sword (Secret of Mana), and, of course, Final Fantasy. In turn these PS titles are being considered for conversion to Windows '97.

"mputer ideo ames CLASSIC IN THE MAKING Producer: Mr Sakaguchi Director: Mr Kitase Sound: Mr Uematsu Image Artist: Mr Tenno Character Artist: Mr Nomura The list of names printed above are merely the tip of the iceberg. There are more than 100 people working on the FFVII project, some of which have been brought in from other areas of the entertaiment business. People such as Paul Ashdown, from England, who once worked for LucasArts special effects company ILM is now at Square LA. So too is another Hollywood CG artist Ron Sabatino. Likwise the R&D in Japan has their top artists on the job. We understand that the work load is divided quite evenly between the two offices the LA and Japan with updated versions of the game being wired halfway around the globe at regular intervals. Heart rending scenes such as this Bahamut attack are pure Hollywood. This set piece looks impressive here tiny on the page. Imagine it on your telly! SIGGRAPH '95 uo.zezskejd uo zwynos wolf Ady weana Characters and animations from Final Fantasy VII were first shown at the SIGGRAPH show in August 1995. At the time it was believed that these were demos for Nintendo 64, a conclusion drawn from the fact that these were Silicon Graphics images. The rest seemed accademic. Of course everybody got it wrong, but the stunning sequences displayed are now all being translated onto PlayStation. In fact it was through experience with the SGI workstations, and realising how much data was involved to get results, that Square made the move toward CD-ROM development as opposed to Mask ROM (cartridge) 1549 RON 192 150 1955 1930 1939 WIRED The wire-framing technique used in Final Fantasy VII is reported to be very different from those used in most polygon-based games. Examples shown here illustrate how characters are constructed from wire-frame, through to detailed CG images, then finally quantized for PlayStation display. The loss of fidelity is extremely slight, which is amazing! REAL TIME FANTASY DISTANCE TUNTU GHIVECO As we briefly explained last month, all Battle scenes and Field (exploration) scenes are generated real time. This allows for seemless transition between sequences where a character walks from the street and into a building, or as enemies confront the party for a battle. As shown elsewhere in this feature, real time also enables players to view scenes from any distance or angle. This has never before been experienced in an RPG.

"compute vider game PlayStation Ki SON AERITH BARRET While there are no shots of this girl character in action, we expect Aerith is likely to twirl that staff of hers like a cheerleader's baton. You can bet that pony tail of hers helps accentuate her spinning movements as she attacks too. It's most peoples' guess that she is a magic user, due to her high MP values but as with Cloud Square haven't specified anything. Significant because of the firearm he has attached to his body. The Gattling Gun is a major departure from the usual FF style which majors on sword and sorcery, or high technology as opposed to bullets. Barret looks much older than the boy and girl characters, leading us to believe that he is a mercenary assigned to help in the mission. Chances are he's nobody's friend to begin with. Introducing the central character, Cloud, who features most in the many screenshots provided by Square. He weilds a sword the size of his body. and balances himself accordingly to support it. This gives him a cool 'ready stance in battle. Square have not released any details of his background, or why he is undertaking this quest.

Cloud's determined face is seen through the flare. Check out his cool stance, as he shifts his weight. With each successive Final Fantasy game there are innovations made on battle strategy. While most of what we know on FFVII is speculation, and it's unsure how many characters can join the battle, already there are clues to the system. As expected battles are staged separately from field exploration, but the differences are more subtle than that: There's an all-new 'Limit' gauge, which could be similar to the one which affects attack strength in Secret of Mana. In addition, beneath each character's name is a 'Dual' gauge. Could be this relates to a character's status their strength and skill. Finally the Active Battle gauge is planned to return, governing the recovery speed of each character after making an attack. That's fighting on the fly, friends the most exciting way to go! CALL OF THE WILD The mighty dragon, or 'Bahamut', seen here is on your side!

WHITES OF THEIR EYES The first major visual difference to battles is that scenes are represented in real time 3D, allowing it to be viewed from any angle. Previous FF battles have always been viewed from the side in 2D. At the moment Square haven't specified whether these angles are predetermined or user controlled.

"computer WHEN I GROW UP video games PlayStation Character development how their strength and skill improves is crucial to any RPG. Throughout the FF series, the method of advancement has alternated between gaining experience in battle, and changing professions. In the first case characters enhance their skills by assigning experience points to magical stones, which then bestow magic powers on the heroes. Profession-oriented development, on the other hand, requires players to switch rolls in order to learn new techniques. This is a system shared by the most recent Dragon Quest instalment. If the FF trend is anything to go by, we can expect the latter system. 250161113EMBRE ! #allinn Tit ! ] 250 171.2 I.Lvt 1540, 2500 120 150 1468/1930 270 310 2590 3540 000 000 MUCH MORE FOR LESS We have until Christmas to wait for the Japanese release of Final Fantasy VII, where the game will retail for  ().

In fact it's more like blatant, unabashed, self-publicity in the case of WARP Japanese developers of the game D, recently published through Acclaim on Saturn and PlayStation. As you may know, D is originally a 3D0 title. So M2 is the logical next step for WARP to step out on, and they're doing it in style as this demo of D2first aired on a Cover CD for 3DO Magazine in Japan ably demonstrates.

"computer video games TSD are tipped by the likes of The Big Breakfast and Live & Kicking to be the group to look out for in 1996. GUA They're a sort of Bananarama meets East 17Funky dance music with plenty of fresh-face enthusiasum. They created a buzz in the UK after the Smash Hits Tour and P J & Duncan's Christmas Cracker Tour, and their second single, Baby I Love You, was released on 18th March. We sent Kate Russell along to find out if they're just pop personalities... or are they really PLUGGED IN? Bonnie, Cossi and Claire grew up together dreaming of a career in music. Last year thier dreams came true when they were snapped up by promotors AVEX and were thrust into the limelite over night. ON Girls Who Sing Songs and Play Video Games So how did you come up with the name TSD? Cossi: \"Well, to be honest we couldn't decide on a name. Like all good friends we always argue, so in the end we just picked 3 letters out of a scrabble bag... TSD. I suppose we were lucky they didn't come out BUMI\" How do you keep in shape? \"Chocolate. Lots of it.\" says Claire as she polishes off a fairy cake, \"Oh, and dragging our suitcases up flights of stairs Cossi's afraid of lifts!\" (Cossi throws an empty Refresher packet at Claire!) TSD play a lot of games and know what they're talking about... don't they? Bonnie: 1 normally get what my mates say is good. But there's not so much choice for the Gameboy now is there? Claire: Oh don't ask me! What about violence in games? Do you think it's too much? Cossi: Oh god, there's one game out at the moment thats really gory. I think there's a preview in this CVG. (rifles through the mag] That's it! Resident Evil. I think that's a bit too much. Claire: Lets have a look. Yuck, that looks really realistic. I don't think I'd like that. Bonnie: The fighting games out now have tried to be too clever. They have lots of blood and gore and special effects. I much prefer games like Street Fighter. They're simpler, but loads more fun. BONNIE CLAIRE V COSSI V Do you think games are good value for money? Cossi: If I really like a game and play it loads I don't mind paying forty quid for it. Claire: How much? You're kidding. That's outrageous! Cossi: Yeah. I think there should be more rental shops like Blockbuster so you can try them out first. Bonnie: It's a lot of money for kids to spend. Especially if they might not like the game. It's OK if you've got a job, but most of the people who play these games are still in school aren't they? Cossi: I think the 'in games' have become a fashion thing now as well. If your friends have it you've got to get it too. It's a lot of pressure to be cool. And that can't be easy if you don't have much money. Are you into computer games? Claire: I'm not. I'm useless. I did try a friends Game Boy once. I think it was Super Mario... but I couldn't get past the first thingy. Bonnie: I like arcade games, like Alpine Racer. It's really realistic and you get a buzz out of zooming down the slopes. I like shooting games too. But I don't really get the chance to play them that much. I do play my Game Boy a lot when we're on tour. It really helps to pass the time on long coach journeys. Tetris is really addictive. Cossi: I love games! I got into them because my nephews had a Mega Drive. They're only 6 and 9 but I used to go round there all the time and nick their games. Then last year I bought a Play Station. It worked out really well because my nephews got a Saturn so we swap all the time. My favourite games are Wipeout, Demolition Derby (sic) and Rayman. But I've just finished Rayman and it's boring now so I'll have to get another one. I might try out Theme Park. It looks quite good. What makes you choose a game? Cossi: I read a lot of magazines, like CVG. I like reading the reviews because the people who write them play a lot of games. There's a knock at the door, my time is up. As I leave the building clutching my copy of Baby I Love You, one thought occurs to me: How comforting to know that the future of our Pop industry lies in the hands of such well balanced people...

So when you send anything into CVG (Letters, art, tips, anything), we want your Top 3 Most Wanted List too, in chosen order. Fail to do this and we won't pay any attention to your mail. SO DO IT! Oh, and by Most Wanted we mean what you want to see released', not 'what you want for your birthday' or anything. Fools. Contents Page Things certainly seem rosy for Sega in Japan at the moment. VF3 is causing disbelief at its incredible new hardware, the new white Saturn is flying off the shelves, and Panzer Dragoon Zwel has proved more popular than Biohazard on Playstation. In the UK though, the picture is a little less clear. Last month, Sega Europe went on record claiming that Saturn had overtaken PlayStation in weekly sales, based on recent Gallup figures that showed Saturn just behind PS, with unsurveyed stores yet to be taken into account. Sony have responded by challenging Sega to an independent sales audit, to prove once and for all that PlayStation is ahead of Saturn in cumulative sales. Indeed, with the new  triple game bundle available from Dixons, PS sales have been seen to double in recent weeks. So, the Saturn vs Playstation argument has left the playground and taken to the streets. Can there really be a winner to this argument? Personally, we can't wait for the Ultra 64.

This is David Kelsall's newly formed lunchtime retro computer club and it aims to bring you the hottest gossip from C&VG ten years ago. Demember IMAGINE-THE NAME OF THE \\GAME they had some classic titles including PING PONG, a nifty little conversion of the KONAMI original. Another C&VG Hit and a great (maybe the only?) computer game of table tennis. OOOH! Just a quickie, remember when Starfox was coming out on the SNES and they changed the name to Southern Belle. Sequel Starwing. Well Evening Star coming soon! its cos Ariolasoft had already done a similar type of game called Starfox for the C64. orget SEGA RALLY or RIDGE RACER! What you want is SOUTHERN BELLE: KING ARTHER Class 4-6-0 locomotive simulator. Your task is to take the passenger train from Victoria to Brighton, playing the roles of both driver and fireman. Cope with coal and water, keep an eye on the signals, and arrive at the stations on time. Worth checking out for the novelty value alone, athough Tony Crowthers L OCO or SUICIDE EXPRESS are a lot more fun if hardcore train action is what your after. COLLECTORS CORNER C&VG MAY 1986 SPECTRUM: BATMAN, TURBO ESPRIT C64: THRUST CONSOLE: Release of the NES means that classic carts will definitely be uncovered during the coming months. ARCADE: SPELUNKER by Irem marked maybe the first time an original computer game had been converted to arcade. The game was basically a sort of PETER PAC RAT or LODERUNNER clone but made a change from the scrolling beat 'em ups that were hogging the arcades at the time. ne to add to your cassette-based collection from this month has got to be BOMB JACK by ELITE software (of kokatoni Wilf, Dukes of Hazard fame) on the C64 and spectrum. The basic idea of the game is to help BOMB JACK collect a load of bombs at the same time as avoiding the nasties. Jack can run, jump and fly around the screen, and if he follows a particular sequence bonus points can be earned. Er... and that's it really except that it was a C&VG HIT! and had previously coined it in at the arcades. You should be able to pick up either version for about .50 at selected Computer Caverns. Tony Crowther had his first game rejected by C&VG! Luckily he wasn't that put off otherwise the likes of POTTY PIDGEON would never have surfaced. The brilliant BOMB JACK. Seek it out!

"mputer ideo ames JAGO 0 KILLER INSTINCT 2 y popular demand CVG brings you the best Killer Instinct 2 guide around. We have got our grubby little hands on all of the finishing moves, combo breakers and special moves. Help has come from the people at Rare with this guide, the man in the north known as Graham Duffy, and our agent around town Danny Boutros. SUPER MOVE BARS The most noticeable addition to K12 is the introduction of a super move bar. As the player takes hits, performs special moves, and so on, this bar fills up. Once this happens each player has the ability to perform super special moves. All fighters have roughly six super attacks to their name. COMBO BREAKING DE ARCADE GUIDE SPECIALS Wind Kick DF, D, DB+any K No longer will you need to know the power of attack that your adversary is performing to break it. Kl2 simplifies the art of combo breaking by using this simple method: Punches break kicks, and kicks break punches. This means that if your opponent is starting to unleash a combo using the various kick buttons, you can break it quite easily by pressing punch after the combo breaker sequence. Laser Blade DF, D, DB+3 Slide DB, D, DF+any k Endokuken DF, D, DB+ any P Tiger Fury F, D, DF+ any p ADDITIONAL LINKERS SUPER MOVE As you may remember in the first KI, linkers were the most important feature in performing combos, but sadly each player had only one linker to extend their combos. Now each character in KI2 have multiple-linkers, which means that the total amount of combos available to each player exceeds five-figure numbers! Super Endokuken [4] D, DB, B, DB, D. DF, F+3 Super Windkick [3] DF, D, DB, B, F+5 Super Ninja Slide [3] DB, D, DF, F, B+6 Super Tiger Thrash [3] D DB, B, DB, D. DF, F+3 (All moves are assuming the player is facing right) HCB=Half Circle Back HCT=Half Circle Toward F=Forward B=Back D=Down U=Up 1=Quick Punch 2=Medium Punch 3=Fierce Punch 4=Quick Kick 5=Medium Kick 6=Fierce Kick THE NUMBER BESIDE EACH SUPER MOVE, INDICATES THE AMOUNT OF BLOCKS USED IN THE SUPER BAR. COMBO BREAKER F. D, DF+Any P/K FREEPLAY FATALITY Dragon Summon D, DB, B.
