The controller is one of the largest you'll ever see. Instead of the usual joypad, it has a very responsive solid metal joystick and an array of five fire buttons. Obviously, it's designed for tabletops rather than knees. The final technical innovation is the facility to save your position in games on a smartcard, a 2 Meg credit cardsized widget which you get with the console. It just slots into the front of the machine, and no matter what game you're playing, you can stop the action and instantly log your progress so you can return to the same spot again and again. The card is also to be implemented on SNK's new line of coin-ops, so when you run out of ten SOUNDING OUT Like the Megadrive, this console features a stereo headphones socket which lets you fully appreciate its stunning sound features.

All three games feature superb graphics, incredible music and absolutely tons of speech, particularly Baselutely tons of sne ball Pro which simply has to be heard to be believed!

"OI! WHO'RE YOU CALLING LOVE? the annual tournament at Wimbledon will be rearing its ugly head, and if you happen to be down Marble Arch way on the 30th June, Ubi Soft will have something going on to whet your whistle, so to speak. They're running a Pro Tennis Tour competition in the Virgin store at 527-531 Oxford Street in which 64 competitors will battle it out to win some fab prizes, including tennis rackets and copies of the game. If you want to take part in this breathtaking event, get down to said Virgin store by the 20th of June and put your name down. Be quick about it though, 'cos there's not a lotta time left! No sooner will the World Cup have finished (crikey, aren't there a lot of World Cup references this ish!) than GOING FOR GOAL! Everybody's jumping on the World Cup bandwagon! Joystick makers Dynamics have released the Competition Pro Goal World Cup series of sticks the same strong, durable stick as before, but now sporting the colours of a host of World Cup countries. There are ten different ones in all; just think, not only can you replay the 1990 England versus Italy final (well, that's what we're hoping!) on your favourite footy game, but you can also use the same coloured sticks, too! MISSION CONTROL All you flight sim buffs will no doubt be ecstatic to hear that not only are Mirrorsoft bringing out a second Falcon mission disk with new intercept missions and weaponry, but Activision are bringing out an extra disk for the acclaimed Fighter Bomber providing 16 more missions. Both will be out for ST. Amiga and PC in the summer. THUNDERSTRUCK Mindscape have snapped up the license to the latest Tom Cruise movie, Days of Thunder which, according to their Phil Harrison, is \"a very good film\". It's based on the devil-may-care exploits of a handsome stock car driver played by Mr Cruise, a feat of casting which prompted Phil to describe the film as \"Top Gun on the ground\". Argonaut (of Starglider and Afterburner fame) are putting together the game, which should be a 3D road racer with lots of crash'n'burn action. The movie will be on general release from July 4th (\"Born On The 4th Of July\", as it were) and the game is due on C64, ST and Amiga on September 1st, with other versions following in October.

"TETRIS II They said it could be done. \"Nay, nay, nay\", they nayed. But it's happening. The follow-up to the best game ever is almost here, and it promises to be even better than the original! That canny Commie, Alexei \"Sayle\" Pajitnov is working on the home versions of the sequel to Tetris. It's called Welltris, and it's set in a well. Again, the object is to create lines from falling blocks, only this time the lines can be either horizontal or vertical. There'll be variable difficulty levels, loads of weird and wonderfully-shaped blocks and, with a bit of luck, the same maddeningly addictive gameplay which the original \"block\" buster contains. Now let's hope someone picks up the license for Hatris, the latest, terrifically playable installment in the arcade Tetris saga, which, in case you haven't seen it, is Tetris with hats! WORLD CUP WINNERS (AND LOSERS) DID YOU KNOW..? Why is Dave Beasant looking so pleased, despite being overlooked for a place in the England World Cup squad? Because he's just got his everSO-safe hands on the new Commodore 64 World Cup bundle in which nestles everyone's fave 8 bit machine, as well as Beach Volley, Basket Master, Pro Tennis Tour, Run The Gauntlet and the so-new-even-we-haven't seen-ityet Adidas Championship Football. But Dave isn't sore see, he's even letting lucky World Cup participator Tony Dorigo have a go, to see if he can do as well against the computer as he did when he helped give crappy old Cagliari that 6-0 drubbing a few weeks back! PROMOVE Here's a vaguely interesting fact. Jason Kingsley, a graphic artist currently employed by US Gold, has not only created some of the snazzy piccies which you see on a wealth of games, but he was also involved in production of the images seen in the video for Adamski's number one hit, Killer. Using software, written by his brother Chris for the Amiga and ST. Jason, whose past successes include the graphics for Trivial Pursuit, Better Dead Than Alien and Hunt For Red October, was able to create those brilliant effects seen pulsating away behind the dancers on the promo. Let's hope that his current project, called Murder, is as spectacular, eh? PC KID ONE CAREFUL OWNER You know how it is. Buy a cart for your PC Engine, play it to death, then put it away to gather dust because you've finished it. Not any more! Console Quest, the mail order console sales people, have come up with a scheme whereby, if you want to buy a new Engine game, send your old one as part exchange and you'll get a tenner off the cost of the new cart!

"Find out its limits. Look in the mirror. NATARI 1040STE ATARI SM124 "


"ST SERIES Introducing the powerful new Atari 1040 STE. With such an awesome machine, we're convinced the only limits you'll come across are your own. Based on the incredibly successful 1040 STEM, the 1040 STE itself goes beyond the limits of its predecessor. The 'E', by the way, stands for 'Enhanced'. But once you've discovered its amazing array of features, you may consider 'Enhanced' to be the understatement of the decade. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the 1040 STE is its graphics. Its palette contains over 4000 colours (all right, 4096 to be exact). To ensure precise and realistic images, the STE features 'hardware scrolling', enabling smooth scrolling in any direction and split-screen effects. And, with the SMI24 monitor, you'll get razor sharp black-out-of-white text that's as clear as the type on this page. To complete the picture, it is able to 'phase lock' its video output to an external video source, permitting direct linking to a Genlocking device. The 1040 won't just have your eyes swivelling in their sockets. Your eardrums will also take a pounding from the 8-bit PCM stereo sound. The new PCM (Pulse Coded Modulation) sound system's two chips allow the 1040 STE to replay high-quality sampled sounds, in stereo, without burdening the CPU. Or, for even more of an earblasting, just add a couple of RCA output jacks and power the sounds through your own stereo. Of course we mustn't forget memory. One megabyte of RAM comes as standard. If that's not enough, the 1040 STE provides four SIMM sockets. Simply plug in some SIMM (Single Inline Memory Module) boards and boost the RAM up to four megabytes. To help you handle all this technology, we've added even more: a Blitter chip, capable of shifting data at high speeds independent of the CPU, and a new version of TOS. The TOS 1.6 (operating system) has an enhanced file selector with drive-change buttons, improved desktop with file move, MS-DOS compatible disk formatting, and better application installation and auto-booting facilities. As you'd expect, there's a huge range of peripherals including hard disks, floppy disks, laser printers, colour monitors and even Megafile 44, Atari's unique 44-megabyte removable hard disk. As well as all this hardware, there are hundreds of software programmes for the 1040 STE we're even throwing in the ST-Series Productivity and Leisure bundles free. The Productivity bundle features a database, spreadsheet, word processor and business graphics package, and there's S.T.A.C., FirST BASIC, Hyperpaint and Prince in the Leisure bundle. If you're itching to get your hands on the controls, there are two 15-pin analogue controller ports (which accept paddles, lightguns and light pens) and a 9 pin mouse port and joystick port. With adaptors, up to six people can use the 1040 at one time. Just in case it's too much for one person to handle. At .99 it certainly won't be too much for one person to afford. The ideal computer at the ideal price, you may think. We think so, too. But there remains only one potential problem: not whether you'll make impossible demands of the 1040, but whether the 1040 will make impossible demands of you. Please send me further details of the 1040 STE and other Atari products. NAME: ADDRESS: ------POSTCODE Please send to Atari Corp (UK) Ltd. Atari House, Railway Terrace, Slough, Berkshire. SL2 5BZ.

It's hoped that either publishers Konami will produce, or allow a British software house to produce ST, Spectrum and Amstrad versions. We'll keep you posted. half-shell untold amounts of trouble. In an attempt to catch the Turtles with their shells down, they ve gone and kidnapped ace reporter April O'Neill from the TV studio where she works, and are hustling her around the city. So, after a brief talking-to from Master Splinter, the four go off in search for their friend. But even Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles don't have it easy all the time, especially in a city the size of New York. Se wers, streets and buildings form a complex maze for the Turtles to negotiate and wherever they go, it's a sure bet that there'll be a Foot Clan posse waiting just around the corner The player controls the Turtles one character at a time through the city, which is displayed both in birds-eye view 3D when patrolling the city, and in a traditional hori000000 700 zontally scrolling format when in the sewers or a building. If a Turtle's energy is completely depleted, he is captured by the Foot Clan, leaving the others to continue their task. Energy is revitalised by picking up slices of the Turtles' favourite food pizza which can be found throughout the city, along with extra weapons which the Foot Clan have absent-mindedly dropped. IIIIIIIIIII AMIGA .99 If you've been expecting a straight conversion of the fabulous four-player coinop. you may be disappointed to find out that Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles is, in fact, taken from the Nintendo console game. That disappointment soon fades away though, when you discover that this game is a lot more involved than its arcade counterpart, requiring not only lightningfast beat 'em up skills, but a fair smattering of forward planning and mapping, too. Each Turtle has his own particular strengths and weaknesses, and if you choose the wrong dude for the job, it's quite likely that your character will get beaten. This can be frustrating in the early stages, but given time it becomes second nature as you begin to learn each Turtle's characteristics. Surprisingly, the game differs very little from the Nintendo version graphically; slightly blocky but generally well-drawn, sprites and backdrops. Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles could have been the worst game in the world and still would have sold like hot pizzas luckily, it's not the case. Instead it's a challenging, addictive arcade adventure which fans of the Turtles (and who isn't?) should be more than happy with.

"Never get in front of SODOM when he's armed with swords. Move above or below him, grab him and either knee kick or head butt to stun him. Try and grab him as soon as he stands. If he charges, kick him down and grab him. When DAMND appears, drain his energy with knee kicks or head butts. While Damnd is sitting on the wall, attack the smaller thugs, but be prepared to dodge him when he does his flying kicks. Fight EDI.E with the same tactics as Sodom, but use punches instead of grab attacks. Finish with a throw and use the spare seconds to reposition yourself. Try and stay close when he draws his gun he only shoots when he's far away. Finish him off with knee kicks. Avoid using grab attacks against ROLENTO.

When he throws grenades, dodge them and use grab attacks. The boss CROSSBOW. He fires his weapon if you walk in front of him, so keep moving and use sneak attacks. It's tricky to grab him, so stick to punches and kicks. Throwing enemies at him puts him off balance. Cody and Guy can deflect crossbow bolts fired horizontally, not diagonally. Stay at the bottom of the screen and when ABIGAIL runs on, use your grab attacks twice. After that he grabs you, so avoid getting too close. When he charges you must punch in his direction. 31 "

An Amstrad and Spectrum version are appearing at the end of June which will have an extra event, Sumo Wrestling, but no joystick editor. Mysteriously, there are no plans for a C64 version at the moment. .99 Martial arts games are many and various on all machines, but there aren't many that put three different beat 'em ups in one package, and that's where Oriental Games' real strength lies. No-one could claim the three games are stunning beat 'em ups, but they're well up to scratch and could more than likely hold their own as individual products. The graphics throughout are very good and the essential sampled squawks of pain are effective. The computer is a challenging opponent in all three disciplines and at all three skill levels, but playing against a friend is more fun, especially if you've surreptitiously used the joystick editor to put together a devastating \"secret weapon\" move. Even if you don't fancy yourself as the next Bruce Lee, this value-formoney package is the perfect way to let off steam after a hard day at the office (classroom, bicycle shop, whatever).

Wonder no more: Railroad Tycoon has arrived on Platform 1. You're cast as an ambitious entrepreneur with a budget of one million dollars. Your only aim in life is to in vest it wisely in the railroad and make a wad of cash. To do so you'll have to use your trains and their specialist carriages to take resources like oil, coal and petrol to the right factories, and transport mail and passengers from town to town. There are four different territories to choose from England, East America, West America and Europe and in all of them you deal with rival railroad entrepreneurs. Pulldown menus allow you to organise your finances, pay a visit to the stockbroker, operate signals, build trains, compete with your rivals and create the most profitable routes. You can even build factories or put up restaurants and post offices at your local stations, if you want to make a bit of extra cash. A financial report is drawn up at the end of each year. If your investors (they're the guys who put up the dosh in the first place) are pleased, you're allowed to carry on. If not, it's back to playing with your train set. es 58 BY MICROPROSE 38 "

TIIIIIIIIII) PC .99 With its sheer complexity, vast array of options and immense scope for hours and hours of play, Railroad Tycoon is one of the classiest simulations you're ever likely to see a bit like Sim City with loads of extras thrown in. Once you've got the hang of them, the maps and menus are easy to use, building is incredibly easy and the whole package is distinguished by masses of authentic detail: you can lay double or single track, be your own signalman, or dabble in the stock market with bonds and shares. All the maps are geographically accurate so you can build a network of factories round your home town and watch the population escalate. Better still, the resource map is different every time you play so no two games can ever be the same even if you lay your track in exactly the same place. With that much scope for unique design and development it will be months before you run out of puff. Graphically, Tycoon may not be much to look at (though there are some very good animated building sequences) but what it lacks in glamour it certainly makes up for in gameplay, and if you've got a sound board, the effects are something special!

Projectyle features eight such teams, each with their own pitch these range from the ridiculously fast (owned by the Manic Mooses) to the slow, crazy, spotted surface used by the Eldritch Cats. Each pitch is divided up into five areas: there's a central zone with no goalmouths, three defence zones and a 'frantic zone where there are three goalmouths and everyone has an equal chance of scoring. The objective, obviously, is to score as many goals as possible within the three-set time limit. But here's the novel twist: unlike most sports, Projectyle features three teams competing for the ball (the projectyle') at the same time. The team scoring most receives 8 points, the second team 4. and the third gets zilch. A Prepare for kick off Projectyle's presentation Is probably the most polIshed you'll find in any future sport. Apart from the full league and cup system (with up to eight human players taking part and a save/load facility), there's a host of redefinable player parameters and the ability to train and deploy team members in any position, All eight pitch designs are brilliant, from a silly jelly pitch to a bubbling chocolate and lava pitchthey're colourful, imaginative and feature smooth 4-way parallax scrolling. In-game presentation features include an optional action replay sequence and a practice mode (you can switch off computer intelligence). As if than wasn't enough, there's also a leading scorers table! The gameplay itself is fast and furious a bit like air hockey played on five pitches instead of one. You might think at first that it's all mindless rushing around after the projectyle, but it only takes a few games to appreciate the strategic elements. This is a beautifully designed, colourful and extremely fast future sport one that's going to take some beating.

IIIIIIIIII AMIGA .99 These icon-driven 3D adventures have become more and more popular of late, and the standard has been going up as well. While BSS Jane Seymour is similar to Pandora's Xenomorph in subject matter, it's a more compact game, which basically means that, though the playfield is smaller, you don't have to do as much wandering about to find some action. The denizens of the ship are nicely designed and animated, but unfortunately most of them look cuddly and cartoony, instead of being menacing and realistic as Dungeon Master's did. That's the only niggle worth mentioning though, and on the whole, BSS is an excellent adventure. There are a ton of options for handling objects, programming robots, etc, etc, but the icon system copes with them all admirably, making the game very easy to get into. Playing through 20 packed levels is going to be a real burning-the-midnight-oil job, so if you've a few weeks to spare and a coffee machine next to your computer this is a definite must-buy.

When in need of a little assistance, you can call on Dynak, the Defenders' computer, to beam down another member of the team. Each member of the team has specific abilities, essential to the mission's success (for example, Phantom can kick down heavy oak doors). Even the team mascot, Zuffy, has a use although he sometimes makes mistakes and arouses the attention of huge guardian robots, including Ming's enormous metallic arachnid, Octon!

VIIIIIIIIII AMIGA .95 When I first heard that there was to be a game based on what has to be my favourite cartoon series of this year, I expected it to be a poorlyexecuted shooter, relying on only the license for sales. Now it's here and, yes it's a shoot 'em up, but, to my surprise, quite a good one. Okay, so it's not outstanding, and I suppose the license does go some way to adding interest, but Defenders of The Earth has a lot of good points. The opening title tune, for instance, is extremely close to its TV counterpart, and the sampled speech of Flash, inviting you to join in the mission, adds atmosphere. The game itself is very difficult, especially when you've only got the rubbishy pistol which you begin with more weapons are available later), but practice reaps its own rewards and you'll find yourself getting deeper Into Ming's domain with every attempt.

"EVIEW IIIIIIII UPDATE An Amiga version is due for simultaneous release, with a PC version to follow eventually. An 8-bit Prophecy is a possibility, but only once the game has been released on consoles in America. SCORE 3575 LEVEL 01 A AIEEEE! Brian plummets down a well PROPHECY 1 Stock up on magic weapons at Mrs Borg's Arsenal EXIT BY WIRED Drian was a happy-goDlucky sort of Viking child living in a typical Viking village. When his master said \"Go and get some herbs from the forest' he did it with a whistle in his throat and a smile on his face. Little did he know that, whilst he was away watching bunny rabbits gambol and frolic, his whole village was razed to the ground by a wandering whirlwind. His family and friends were all whipped off to Valhalla where Loki (Mr Bad Guy) was feeding them prison food. In tears, he saw a vision of Odin, who reassured him that all was not lost. An oracle prophesied that Brian would rescue his chums and give that terrible trickster, Loki, a good biffing First, though, he's got to rid the land of all evil. There are shops and secret passages and hidden gems to help him, but the one thing Brian's relying on most is you. ST .99 There are only a couple of things wrong with Prophecy 1: the main character's movement is a tad too slow and there's a bit too much disk-swapping. It plays like a hybrid of Wonderboy and Super Mario Bros without quite achieving the playability of either. Despite these drawbacks, it's a very enjoyable game the graphics are colourful with some great cutesy touches and the sound is jolly enough. There's plenty of variety in the gameplay to keep you hooked: it's very much an old-style arcade adventure, with the emphasis squarely on fun. The difficulty level is about right, too the first stage is a pretty simple affair with some annoying enemies; but after that things get really toughand there's a handy password system to fend off boredom. The best part, though, is that you can play the same level again and again and still discover secrets you missed the last time. With that kind of hidden depth and plenty of lands to tackle, it'll be a long time before you get bored.

Take one marine corps hero, blow him to bits on the surface of Titan and post him first class to a mad German scientist. That's exactly what happened to J Kowolski in the 22nd century: a mass of metal and skin, he was reassembled as the RemoTe Offworld Xenoprobe, Mark 1 ROTOX 1. Of course, no one chucks a thing like that at the general public: he has to be tested first. This involves plonking our tin chum on the Solar Exploration Company's training complex beyond the orbit of Neptune, where the landscape and all its occupants rotate around him at high speed. If he survives ten terrains, each with nine sectors jam packed with aliens and deadly machines, he'll serve a useful role in society. If not, he'll end his life as a hundred sardine cans. This is a very unusual combination of tricky platform action and furious blasting which you don't really take to at first. The initial level feels quite easy (apart from some vicious spinning platforms), and the aliens tend to gang rather than behave intelligently. Get to the second level and it all changes! The aliens become a tad nastier and some of the platform traps are really devious from then on, you've just got to beat the next stage... The new Rotoscape system plays like the arcade game, Assault. but well-designed (though sometimes garish), spinning terrains transform an average blaster into a very challenging one.

There you are, sitting watch10:56 ing the telly, and some Lord from another dimension summons you to his kingdom to defeat another enemy race. Sheesh.

Thankfully you aren't alone in your questwith you are three friends from previous journeys to Lord British's country and, being the Avatar (the embodiment of all that is wholesome and good), you also have access to a range of spells.

A bolt of lightning opens the gate to Britannia VIIIIIIIIIII PC .99 It's hardly surprising considering the time it's taken to arrive, but Ultima 6 is the biggest, most involved game in the series. The quest may not seem at first to be too difficult but soon the adventure develops to such an extent that, if you haven't got amazing powers of concentration, you'll become lost in the various sub-quests. As ever, the game is displayed using a bird's-eye view which works extremely well on a colour system but there is so much detail on the screen that playing on a Hercules machine quickly causes severe eye strain. The control system is extremely simple to operate, with only ten main icons and a cursor to control your entire destiny, and with the amount of fighting needed to vanquish the hordes of creatures inhabiting Britannia, you'll be more than pleased to learn that it only takes a couple of keypresses to unleash a blow to the enemy. If you haven't got a reasonably fast, colour PC with a hard drive, forget it Ultima VI takes up around 4 megabytes of disk space so you spend a lot of time swapping disks. But if you've got a decent system and enjoy large, demanding RPGs, this is one which I'd recommend you pick up without delay.

"FIVE-ASIDE FOOTBALL 00000 ESCAPE FROM SINGE'S CASTLE SILVERBIRD Just for a change, here's a football game that doesn't feature all the World Cup teams or give astrological profiles of the Cameroon First XI. This is just good, old, played-in-sports-centres-bybalding-overweight-businessmen Five-A-Side. Well, calling it \"good\" is perhaps a bit of an overstatement, this being one of the weakest of the current crowd of soccer sims. The Spectrum version starts off with some crisp sampled speech, but from there it's all downhill. The game is slowsville, the viewed-from-above players look like they're bent in the middle as they run around, and tackling the opposing team can sometimes get them very confused, causing them to run backwards and forwards on the spot. Yuk. ENCORE This Encore rerelease puts you in the chain mail of Dirk the Daring, on a quest to enter the castle of the despotic Lizard King and \"do him over, good and proper-like\". This means fighting his way through eight separate parts of the castle, each one being a different subgame. Some sections are puzzles, others are more action-oriented, but, as in the laser-disc coin-op, all of them require you to learn a sequence of moves IIIIIIIIIIII before they let you pass.

To do that he has to wander through the halls, leap around platforms and pick up magic bits to dump in a cauldron.

"HEAD OVER SPIDERTRONIC SMASH 16 cared of spiders? Spare a thought for the poor, eight-legged beasties, please. This particular one is on a mission to link together the fabric of the universe, by placing coloured tiles over the holes in space, and if that weren't hard enough, he's being hassled by a load of coloured balls! Dotted around the playing area are anti-grav lifts which allow little old Incey to travel between the different floors and, once you've filled the gaps, it's onto the next, more hazardous stage. What looks at first to be a pretty dull puzzle game is, in fact, an addictive romp with charming graphics and soothing sound. The gameplay isn't exactly fast and frenetic, but it's still demanding enough to make you want to cry when one of the balls crashes into your last spider just as you're about to slot in the final colour. Great value. HIT SQUAD The nasty baddy Blacktooth has captured Mr Head and Mr Heels and enslaved them in his solar system which consists of five planets. You have to liberate each planet before taking on the head guy and beating his ass into the ground. Only snag is, Head and Heels have been split up and, as Head is only good at jumping and heels is pretty hot off the mark when it comes to covering ground, you're going to have to get the pair together again before things can really happen.

"EVIEW IIIIIIIIZ BY MILLENNIUM THUNDER The map. The crosses are the generators you should be aiming for POUND The armchair sportsman of the future won't be tuning in to jet-powered football or particle tennis. In 2238 the only competition worth televising is the Megacorp Industries Ground Defence Games. Entrants get a choice of five ships to fly in the contest, each of which has different speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability statistics. However, after each round the referees award outstanding pilots enhancements to upgrade their ships' flight perfor. mance. The games consist of 50 rounds, played in five different 3D arenas. The object of the game is to use your ship's armament to defend a set of ground installations from robot attack ships which are being released from generators. The attack ships try to deactivate your installations by landing on top of them and draining them of energy, whereupon they turn into homicidal heat-seeking mutants. Blast all the enemy drones and their generators before you lose all your installations and you progress to the next round. There are six types of deadly drone ships, each with their own offensive characteristics. They include Saboteurs (which head straight for your installations and try to deactivate them), Bombers (which, not surprisingly, lay bombs) and Lungers (which explode into clouds of shrapnel when shot). If you're lucky, though, a dead drone will leave behind a pick-up pod, to equip your ship with boosted shield or weapon power, up to three spinning defence pods, a set of turbo boosters or double shots. ir There's a trophy to be won in every arena.

"EVIEW WITZ UPDATE ERSTRIKEM C+VG ST and Amiga versions of Thunderstrike will be out and about by the end of June, both priced .99. Watch out for the Update next issue. Meet the pilot VII1111111111 PC .99 This is one game I've been looking forward to for a while, and the wait has been well worth it. It's basically a pretty simple game-like a 3D version of Defender but it's very, very playable and the speedy vector graphics make playing it an exhilarating experience. Initially, viewing the action from a terrain-hugging remote \"camera\" makes it quite difficult to gauge where pods and ships are meant to be, but everything falls into place after only a few minutes of experimental Swooping about and blasting. Control is by mouse or keyboard, and both are fine, though the heavy-handed among you might find it even easier if you turn the mouse sensitivity down a notch or two. The feeling of zooming over hill and dale is marvellous and if you're lucky enough to have a VGA card plugged in the scenery is spectacularly colourful, as you can see from the screenshots. In EGA mode the colours are less subtle, of course, but this doesn't affect the gameplay at all, and for once, here's a game you don't need a superfast machine to play. Thunderstrike looks perfectly respectable even on an 8 Mhz PC. PAUL GLANCEY GRAPHICS 90% SOUND 80% VALUE 87% PLAYABILITY 89% OVERALL 90% VIIIIIIIIIIII Collect a shield pod before it's too late! "


"REVIEW 11111111III C+VG F1969 .99 The same engrossing gameplay as the ST, and a graphics mode to suit every PC. Not as hot a sim as LHX, but an excellent package nonetheless. OVERALL 89% BY MICROPROSE MINNIE UPDATE With a bit of luck, Amiga F-19 should be out next month, priced .99. And it's already available on Spectrum and C64, under the title of Project Stealth Fighter. Once the Sidewinders are locked on the MiG there's no escape! tealth technology is now available, what with the B2 Bomber and F117-A Fighters. The latter is the subject of this latest simulation from Microprose only when they were designing the game, the plane was top-secret, and had a working title of F19. This oddly-shaped little plane is just the job for sneaking into places where it isn't wanted, blowing up a few enemy bases and cruising away, leaving the opposition perplexed as to where you came from and, indeed, where you went. After selecting your mission and difficulty level, all that's left to do is take off, complete the assigned task and return home. If you're successful you'll receive a slap on the back and if you were really good. a medal or promotion. Failure. however, brings jeers and derision from your colleagues in the bar that's if you make it back to base at all! NIG FULCS HISSILE LOCK TIIIIIIIIII ST .99 F-19 Stealth Fighter is quite different from the vast majority of flight combat sims which we've seen over the past few months. Whereas the others send you on an out-and-out killing spree. this one is much more strategy orientated, which some people may find a little off-putting. That said, when you're participating in a conventional war in Eastern Europe and the full force of the Warsaw Pact is breathing down your jet exhausts, the action can hardly be called \"leisurely\". The overall playing area is vast: if you thought that Falcon was big at a few hundred square miles, you'll be flabbergasted at F-19's half-million, split across the four highly detailed combat zones, riddled with SAM sites, enemy tanks, aircraft and so on. An impressive sim, made even better value by the usual stack of bumph found inside Microprose's packages, F-19 Stealth Fighter offers an informative and exciting look at the USAF's sneakiest piece of kit.

"PELO $3555 162606 Ahat's wrong with arcade manufacturers these days? They seem to have completely run out of ideas, with very few original games rolling off the production lines. Lightning Fighters (and most other games reviewed recently) is a case in point. Take control of your death-dealin' flying machine and cut a swathe up the vertically scrolling screen with a variety of mega weapons. Fun? Yeah, it is for a couple of goes but because the game features nothing new, it gets tedious pretty quickly. Blasting fanatics might squeeze a bit of entertainDAN ment out of this, but really you might as well play Flying Shark, Twin Heli, Gemini Wing, Sonic Boom, 1941, 1942, 1943, Scramble Spirits...

"COWABU There's no stopping them Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles are set to take Britain by storm! C+VG's resident Turtle-maniac Julian Rignall recently visited America to bring you this advanced report on all things in a half-shell. He also saw the Turtle film and was more than impressed... READ THE COMICS When Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman first doodled a Ninja Turtle on a Macdonalds napkin several years ago, little did they know that a phenomenon had just been born. They developed the drawing into a full-blown cartoon strip and, using a loan from an uncle and an unexpected tax rebate, they launched their own comic. Now, the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles (or Ninja Turtles as they're known in America the weedy old BBC replaced the hardsounding \"Ninja\" with \"Hero\") are some of the most well-known cartoon characters in the world. ELEAN GREERING ON THE SCREEN In the US there are two types of Turtles comics one is based on the TV cartoon series, while the other is a more adult strip based on the original Eastman and Laird concept. A new series of books and comics based on the film have also recently appeared, but unlike the former two they are pres. ently unavailable in the UK. (EENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURIZES WATCH THE TV CHTMANNO LRIRE TEENAGE MUTANT NINI THE MOVIE What about Turtles TV? Well, a new series of the popular cartoon show is currently being screened on American networks (watch for it soon on BBC). The first series is now available on a collection of four videos (buy a burger at any Burger King in the US and you can buy them for a mere .75 each! Cool!) COLLECT THE TOYS The sheer amount of Turtles merchandising in the USA is incredible. For starters there's a brilliant range of large (highly detailed 18 inch) and small (4 inch) Turtles figures, featuring all the favourite heroes and villains and that means all four Turtles, as well as Splinter, April, Casey (he's in the film). Yusagi Yojimbo, Shredder, Bebop. Rocksteady, Big Mouser, Foot Soldiers and Mecaturtle to name but a few. There's also a range of cuddly toys, mini figures, metal collectibles, badges, posters, furniture, bed-Spreads, wallpaper... 94 "

American software house Ultra Games has produced a TMNT game on Ninlendo, Amiga, C64 and PC. At present only the Nintendo version is widely available the others can only be bought through specialist software shops (check the black and white ads in C+VG for more details. And always phone first to make sure the dealer has the game in stock). As yet, no British software house has the rights to produce a European version of the game maybe we'll just have to make do with the American game? Most coin-op fans will surely have played the excellent TMNT machine that appeared in arcades recently. It's a great game and surprisingly the computer rights are still up for grabs.

"W C+VG Leonge, ide 1 the tant NINTENDO .95 The Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles have certainly cowabunga'd their way into this issue with a venge. ance, what with the computer game and the Nintendo cart. Although the two are essentially the same, the console version works much better than the others, simply due to the fact that it was designed as a console game. The graphics are great, a bit on the blocky side at times but with lots of colour and some nice additions such as the opening title sequence which shows the turtles being transformed into their mutant alter-ego's. The game itself is very, very tough we've been playing for quite a while now and still haven't scratched the surface. However, this high level of difficulty isn't at all frustrating, in fact it only adds to the overall brilliance of the product. Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles really is a super cartridge, and what's more, it's now being given away free with the console itself!

"C+VG WIIIIIIII MITEM SHOP IIIIIIIIIIII MEGADRIVE .99 DJ Boy (or DJ Kid as it's known in British arcades  Why Sega changed the name for this Megadrive release is a complete mystery) has been eagerly awaited in this office for some weeks. And now we've got it, I can say with hand on heart that the wait has been most definitely worth it. The main character is a nimble little chap who's certainly very flighty on his eightwheeled transport. Which is just as well because if he wasn't he'd be immediately flattened by the hordes of bully-boys, army yobbos and other adversaries which stand between him and his woman. It's a fairly difficult game, not that much easier than the coin op in fact. Starting with only four energy units (which can be increased at the end-level shops if you collect enough cash along the way) and no continues It's a pretty hard slog to get to the very end. With its ever-alert baddies, weird end of level guardians (which include a multi-petticoated Carribean lady and a couple of exploding clowns!) and on-road hazards such as oil slicks, gaps in the path and traffic cones, DJ Boy is not a game you'll tire of easily.

"PC ENGINE TU N ITA nos have long pince been C +V G Ahile basketball, baseV ball, volleyball and tennis have all long since been converted to the PC Engine, football fans have been sadly neglected. Until now... In Formation Soccer, up to four people can (using a joypad tap) play friendly matches or World Cup tournaHents. Choose a country, then select your team forma'n and automatic or manual goalkeeper (the autokeeper follows the ball, but you have MACHINES FORMATION SOCCER BY HUMAN to hit the button to make him jump for it) Whatever your team, the players are always an energetic bunch, legging it up and down the scrolling pitch, chesting and trapping the ball, slide tackling, scissorskicking and heading in spectacular Maradonna style. The player nearest the ball is usually under joypad control, but you can select a new one by pressing the RUN button. The two fire buttons control kick strength (pass or bootup-the-field), as well as strength of throw-ins. No aspect of the game has been ignored and as well as throw-ins, Formation Soccer can cope with free kicks, penalties, corners and goal kicks. Mucho gracias, Spectresoft of Covent Garden for the loan of the Formation Soccer cartridge. IIIIIIIIII PC ENGINE .99 I remember the day Bill Shankley said to me, \"Son, a console football simulation is a game of two halves, and at the end of the day it's the programmer who gives 110% that does brilliant. How right you were, Bill, and if you were alive today I'm sure you'd agree with me when I say that Formation Soccer is the best console soccer game any. where. The combination of fast gameplay and very realistic graphics (it may be coincidence, but the England goalkeeper even looks a bit like Peter Shilton) are instantly attractive, and the flexibility of the control method makes it very easy to set up moves and passing plays. Beginners might be put off by the daunting abilities of the computer team (which is always Japan, not surprisingly), making them a difficult bunch to beat. If you have the facilities to play against someone else, though, the action is nothing short of terrific really fast, action-packed, endto-end stuff which you may find is even more addictive than watching the real thing during World Cup season!

Now's your chance to find out in Final Fight, a conversion of Tailo's boxing coin-op. Of course, if you're any good at the game, you'll be giving as good as you get in this toe-to-toe slugging contest of violence. Three minutes is all you get against an opponent three minutes in which to knock him down three times to win outright, or to outscore him by the time the bell rings by landing more hits than he.

At first the speed of the action is off-putting, with the opponent letting rip with a flurry of blows which quickly floor your boxer. However, it's surprisingly easy to get into action, and become very proficient at landing a variety of deadly jabs, blows and uppercuts on your opponent's head and body. In fact, it's this ease of mastering the game that is Final Blow's downfall. The first four boxers can be beaten within a sitting, and it doesn't take long to knock them all out second time round, making lasting appeal limited. Fans of the arcade game will certainly enjoy this conversion, but if you're a competent games player, you might find that you don't really get your money's worth out of this one.
