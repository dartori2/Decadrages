"C+VG MAY Software REVIENSO EMPIRE GALAXY MAP ALIEN SYS 37% SYSTENS VISITED 1% Machine: Spectrum/C64/ Amstrad Supplier: Firebird Price: .95 If you're a space pilot with a taste for Empire building then why not apply to the nice young lady at your nearest Firebird space station. She's got excitment and adventure in store for all you able-bodied, space age strategy freaks. It would be all too easy to describe Empire as a sort of poor man's Elite. There are lots of similarities between the two. Ace Elite players might find Empire a bit simplistic. But for the rest of us mere mortals it's a good training ground for those wanting to enter the Elite. When you start the game you are in the middle of the solar system Agatlu. You have only the basic ship, with hardly any special features. The display shows you in the middle of a circular playing area. You may rotate everything anti-clockwise and move forwards. The top two thirds of the instrumentation area is empty for the moment. It fills up as you get more extras and add-ons for your ship. In the bottom left and right hand corners you see four columns. These give you an indication of the condition of your ship. They are identified by the letters in white on blue at the top of the columns. 'E' shows you ship's energy: 'T' the ship's temperature; 'R' how 'HOT' in radioactive terms your ship is and 'S' shows the state of your shields. Next to the columns are two circular direction pointers. These point to different things in the current solar system. To fly your ship to the object, rotate until the arrow points straight up and fly forwards. At the bottom of the circular screen there is a blue rectangular panel. This is your ship's computer. All messages in the game will appear on this screen. Above the computer screen is a digit counter which shows the total elapsed time since you started playing the game. You can transport cargo around the system in pods. To carry a pod, you must extend your cargo ropes' behind your ship. You manoeuvre your ship so the pod is to the side of the cargo rope, and the pod will be picked up. When you start the game you only have two lengths of cargo rope, allowing you to carry a maximum of two pods at a time. Further length of ropes can be found in special extra pods. As the game continues, you will be offered a Viper class ship for your use. This allows you to carry many more pods without cargo ropes. Two pod trays will open up on both sides of the display. Starbases comprise of two spheres, to dock with a starbase all you have to do is fly in between them, and turn so that you are facing towards the centre of one of them. The last function available on the standard ship is the galaxy map, this can be used by pressing the G key. To the left of the map there are details about the system that the pointer is pointing at. To get ore, minerals or people for the starbases, you have to land on planets. To land on a planet you have to fly round them until you find a 'warp hole'. If you fly into this warp hole your computer will change your ship's controls and plot an orbit for you to follow if you wish to land on the planet. When flying over the planet surface the direction pointer on the left of the screen is used to guide you to the next pod to be found, or the exit hole. To travel from one system to another, you must fly of the edge of your current system All systems have some aliens. point pickup a pod. When this happens direction pointer two is activated, and should be used to track down the alien. If the alien is shot then the pod will be dropped. If a pod is shot at any time then it will automatically hyperspace to some other point in the system, Some systems are controlled by aliens, these systems will be overrun with very fast aliens.

There's even a sneaky part where the stairways are invisible. And falling off the edge of the stair of platform takes you right back to the beginning of the game.

"C+VG MAY Software REVIEWS 12 PING PONG nye. HIGY.SSARE CPU POTES YOU Machine: Amstrad Supplier: Imagine Price: .95 When the editor challenges you to a game of Ping Pong there's only one thing you can dolose gracefully. Of course he gets to use the joystick and I have to make do with the keyboard. I didn't stand a chance. But after a few games the Ed loses interest and bounds off to challenge someone else to Inter-Galactic Ludo.. Now for some real fun. PingPong is a nifty little conversion of the Konami original. It's simple in concept but great fun to play. You get a three dimensional view of the ping pong table with the two players shown as two dismembered hands floating in the air. The hands look odd but you soon get used to that. Playing against the computer is difficult there are five skill levels to choose from-but it's easier than playing against another player. How two people are expected to compete on equal terms when you have to use a joystick and keyboard is beyond me. Apart from that Ping Pong is an excellent simulation of table tennis. Instead of scoring 21 points to win as in the real game, it's the first one to reach 11 by two clear points who takes the honours. In a two player match it's the first to win the best out of three games. In case you managed to return a ball, here are a few hints and tips on the various shots you can make. Smash: This is a superfast shot used to return \"floaters\". Floaters will make a distinctive sound. Drive: A fast shot normally used to return the ball. Cut: A slow shot which can be used to interfere with your opponent's timing. Forehand or Backhand: Switching back and forth from backhand to forehand is effective when your opponent tries to catch you on your undefended side or when you want to force your opponent to move right or left. The only annoying thing about this game is the noise the crowd makes after a point is won. It begins to grate after a while. Graphics C+VG Sound Value HIT!

I had seen a video which takes you right through the game from beginning to end. It looked very impressive. When I actually came to play the game I couldn't seem to get anywhere at all. It's a shame because the game looked quite interesting later on. The scenario is as follows: A Tyrant named Alana dominates the galaxy. Her power comes from a crystal which is a key to the Mindlord computer which runs everything. She wears this gem around her neck on a Pentite necklace which can only be cut by a Proton lance, powered by Zyron Your control a spectral looking character strangely reminiscent of the ghostly creatures in Pacman around more than 60 screens, charging after pyramids while being chased by the slime.

And a very workmanlike conversion the Spectrum version is too. The mainly monochrome graphics are effective. But the game, which is basically a fast moving shoot'em up, lacks decent sound to complete the package. The basic theme of the game is this. You are the pilot of a super-fighter Skyfox. Your job is to defend your bases from enemy attack. Skyfox is a well presented game-but eventually becomes a bit boring after the umpteenth wave of tanks.

"Front View It's about eighteen months now, since Elite mania swept through the homes of BBC micro owners. This colossal game is still doing well in the charts, constantly hitting the top as it becomes available on more micros. Elite owes something of its origin to the role-playing game called Traveller. As owner of your own ship, you must travel the spaceways, trading wisely in order to build funds, and thus buy better equipment for your pride and joy. Beset by pirates, fearless aliensand police if you've been trading illegally-you must battle your way through the spaceways, from one star-port to another, gaining in stature, until the final few find their place amongst the ELITE. The game is a mixture of simulation-you fly through three-dimensional space and dock with orbitting space stations-arcade action and intellectual trading as you strive for higher profits. This is all brought together in a fascinating adventure scenario, made life-like by the highly detailed Space Traders Flight Training Manual, the novelette Dark Star, based around the game, and your own imagination... you begin the game docked space and free space cargo at the space station near picked up by the fuel scoops) will the planet Lave, with a increase your credit total ship, three homing missiles, quicker seven light years of fuel, and 100 credits to your name.

"edavas when you can no longer use the Jump Drive and you're just waiting for the Space Station to appear. The Spectrum and Amstrad versions, although fairly accurate conversions, suffer from looking too much like games, rather than the original space flight simulator. Of these, the Amstrad comes out best, with colour screens, graphically filled planets, and so on. Finally, the Spectrum implementation is still a great game, but doesn't have the true \"feel\" of the others. It does, however, have the advantage of having far more ways to cheat than in all the other versions put together! then you can be certain they ARE pirates. Fighting Pirate craft isn't that difficult -but they do tend to gang up on you. So remember to prepare an escape route and try and blast the pirate craft at a distance. If they are all bunched up there's the possibility that you can get two or more with one shot. Why not sit outside a space station-fire at it and take on some Vipers! Ignore Thargons, go for the motherships and collect Thargons with your fuel scoops for Alien Items. Every last little one of them. 400, or more, credits. Now go to the Equip Ship screen, and buy some Pulse Lasers, specifying 'O'for forward view. A message will appear informing you \"Lasers present\", and you will be returned to the Status screen, over 200 credits richer. Keep this up until you can afford to fully equip your ship, then save the game-and GO GET'EM! If you want to miss out on all the fun, then having Watford's ROM Manager chip installed when the game is loaded will start you at Elite status, It's possible to start as Elite on the Spectrum version, too, assuming you make it through the Lenslock protection! When the game has loaded, go immediately to the load/save game screen, by answering 'Y'to the 'Load Commander\" message. Save the game, then exit, and you'll be Elite, with a vast credit rating, and all the trimmings, including most equipment, horrendous quantities of cargo, and a Fugitive Legal Status. Just carry on playing from here. LISTING IX OPENOUT CE ceva 20 M eset tied CA 30 PEMIO OPENOUT titele 10 on IR TOBA CONCLUSION This is by no means everything you need to know about Elite. If you've got anything to add to our player's guide why not write to IDEAS CENTRAL with your hints and tips. Melissa is waiting eagerly for them! ELITE BUILDER Another product of interest to Spectrum Elite players is the Elite Builder. This handy little product will allow you to create saved game positions for a Cobra Mk.IV. Yes, your new ship can span the galaxy in a single jump, start with special Beam lasers, or Military Lasers all round, carry phenomenal amounts of cargo, which can be specified before you start, and much more. Costing .99, the Elite Builder is available from: A.C.S.Software, P.O.Box 608, Blackheath, London SE3 7ER Finally remember, it's not the winning, but the way you play the game which counts. Don't be shy and reserved, but go for the bad guys (and the good guys, if you want the kill points), and never run--but die fighting, Ifa multi-player Elite ever becomes available, then watch out, because we'll really sort out the men from the boys!

THE DIFFERENCE If you're in the fortunate position of being able to play more than one version of Elite, then you may like to know what differences you're likely to find. The Commodore 64 version is highly recommended. Though the graphics aren't quite up to the BBC version, there are the added attractions of some colour, the Blue Danube waltz plays on the Docking Computers and, of course, those furry breeders. Next in line comes the original BBC version which still has the smoothest graphics, and best screen layout. For instance, it's still the only one which allows you to watch your radar whilst looking at text screens. Doing this greatly speeds up the play of the game ZAPPING Whatever you do, don't mistake a Viper ship for an asteroid. The consequences could be disasterous -and you do want to reach Elite status -don't you?! So the first rule of space combat is make sure you know what you're blasting at. You can tell what's coming your way to a certain extent by effective use of your on-screen erective use of your on-screen scanner. Certain craft/objects appear at certain points on your scanner. For example, Pirate craft will more than likely appear top left on your scanner.

"1.D.E.AS CENTRAL RAMBO CBM64 Alan Maudlin of Peterborough tells us how to complete Rambo. First of all collect the machinegun which is found at the Temple (although not essential, it will give you 3,000 points) and make your way to the P.O.W.camp. Make your way to the top left where you will find Banks tied to a cross, use the knife to cut him free. Using exploding arrows progress north through the jungle until you come across a stone or rock and then travel north-east and you will find the helicopter. Once in the helicopter, waste no time at all as your energy decreases rapidly. Fly south and slightly to the east until you see the heliport. Using the knife move down to the bottom left of the P.O.W.camp where you will find a bamboo cage. Make contact with the bottom of the cage still using the knife. This will release the prisoners. Use the rocket launcher, which you should have picked up in the helicopter to make your way back to the chopper.Fly north until you reach the forest/jungle. Here you must send the enemy helicopter spinning off. Once you have taken care of this, fly north again until you reach the village where you will have to dispose of the enemy. Fly slightly to the right and then north once more and you should find the heliport, make contact with it and that's it. All you have to do now is repeat the whole process. A few general hints. Use silent weapons whenever possible. More explosive weapons will attract attention. Staying outside the camp and going in at the top left hand (NERVE CENTRE OF IDEAS CORP) Welcome to IDEAS CENTRAL.

"C+VG COMPETITION COMPETITION T THE WAY 1 OF THE TIGER ENDURANCE FORCE Our story begins on the magical world of Orb where, set in the Endless sea, lies the mystical Island of Tranquil Dreams. Many years have passed since the time when, as an infant, you first saw its golden shores and emerald rice fields. A servant had brought you, braving the distant leagues of the ponderous ocean from lands to which you have never returned. She laid you, an orphan, at the steps of the Temple of the Rock, praying that the monks would care for you. Monks had lived on the island for centuries, dedicated to the worship of their god, Kwon, he who speaks the Holy Word of Power, Supreme Master of Unarmed Combat. They live only to help others resist the evil that infests the world. Seeing that you were alone and needed care, the monks took you in and you became an acolyte at the Temple of the Rock. Nothing was made of the strange birthmark, shaped like a crown which you carry on your thigh, though you remember that old servant insisted that it was of mystical importance. Whenever you have asked about this the monks have bade you meditate and be patient. This, then, is the world of The Way of the Tiger, Gremlin Graphics' exciting new martial arts game, based on the series of fighting fantasy books published by Hodder and Stoughton. And now it's your chance to enter this exotic and exciting world with this mysteriously Oriental Computer+Video Games competition. What we want you to do is design a poster for The Way of the Tiger. It doesn't matter if you're no good at art. We're just looking for an exciting and originalidea. And the first prize will be a professional artist's copy of the winning design. The next 20 runners-up will receive a copy of The Way of Tiger, which is available for the Spectrum, Amstrad, MSX and Commodore 64. Remember the winning entry will be judged on the idea, originalit and content, rather than the actual quality of the artwork. Send your entry to The Way of the Tiger Competition, Computer Video Games, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London ECIR 3AU.

Her interest was rekindled by adventures. Kerovnia is in the midst of an election whose main issue is about whether or not to restore alcoholic consumption. As you can imagine, there's been a general gloom in the land during this prohibition. Anita mentions one of the slightly offbeat situations that can occur. \"There's this Princess that you can save from a, of course, ivory tower. The trouble is that after the initial thank you very much' she becomes a bloody nuisance.\" The Pawn is the result of 2% years of intensive work. It scans everything typed in, not just parts of words or key verbs or phrases. Anita reveals that the parser actually possesses a Dr. Jeckel/Mr Hyde personality. \"What we have actually developed,\" she says, \"is an advanced operating system. We hope to further develop this user interface for front-end computer use, and see Pawn as a good way to generate the interest, and the capital necessary.\" Regardless of the intent, Pawn stands out as an excellent example of the blending of mind and machine. Infocom's line of text games. \"I saw them doing great things with the parser),\" she said, \"and I said to myself, I can do that. In fact, I can do better.\" But it wasn't that easy getting started. Being a woman in a heavily male-dominated field has had its ups and downs. \"There's a tendency for the British computer community not to take women seriously, since there're so few of us right now. \"That's why I'm so happy with my company. \"Pawn is set in the mythical and magical world of Kerovnia.

MAILBAG  Thank you for your review of Secret of St Bride's in your November issue. The reason I have taken so long to respond is that, living out here in the wild West of Ireland, such civilised luxuries as C+VGare few and far between Only on a recent excursion to the great Metropolis did I manage to avail myself of a copy. You said that the map is so illogical that it is almost impossible to draw. I do not think this is true. You refer to north exists apparently going south. This does happen, but only on stairways, and the reason for this is that it is precisely what happens in real life. Staircases almost always turn back on themselves for the simple reason that they usually lead from one passage to another which runs parallel to it. Another important point that you make concerns the USE function. You state that in order to get the key from the door using the newspaper, one must use the words USE NEWSPAPER followed by UNDER DOOR etc. and that this makes the input requirements obscure. I realise that reviewers do not always receive the full documentation but I lay stress on this point because a great deal of thought has been given by St. Bride's to making the game as friendly as possible. Priscilla Langridge, St. Bride's, School, Co. Donegal. Negotiations are currently under way for a licence to produce adventure games based on the works of celebrated sci-fi author, Isaac Asimov. The software house involved seems confident that negotiations will succeed. So confident in fact, that the first Asimov adventure is at present in development.  Regular writer to the Helpline, Guy Wilkinson, sent a postcard from Sri Lanka, where he was on a Christmas cricket tour with his school team. Jokingly, he remarked that on his travels he hadn't seem anything of Arthur C. Clark, famous science fiction author, whose novel Rendezvous With Rama was adapted as an adventure during 1985. A few weeks later, this letter arrived: Believe it or not I did actually get around to meeting Arthur C. He is a friend of one of the people who arranged things in Sri Lanka for us. We went around to his house in the pouring Colombo rain, entered his hall, climbed the stairs and were greeted by the man himself. After answering various questions he showed us his satellite TV (we saw a Russian circus!) and some of his hundreds of videos The only visible evidence of computers I saw was a word processor which he was using to write to his neighbour, the American Consulate, whose bonfires were obstructing AC's view of Halley's Comet! He does use computers a lot, though, and is finally getting down to learn a language. Guy Wilkinson, Stanstead, Essex. Keith's reply: Hmmm... staircases eh? Point taken. But I seem to remember I had a preproduction copy of the game, without an inlay. "

"C+VG ADVENTURE EXCLUSIVE_REBEL PLANET Z dventure International UK has ceased trading. Why? \"Because we have decided to concentrate on what we are best at,\" says Mike Woodroffe, \"writing and converting games rather than diversifying our efforts with the publishing and marketing operations.\" It is barely a year since AI UK released their first home-grown game to stand alongside titles from the US. Mike had hoped for a faster flow of Questprobes, which he geared up to convert to UK format machines. \"We simply weren't getting enough adventures to keep us going,\" explained Mike. Last year International UK started producing their own games. Mike Woodroffe in collaboration with Brian Howarth and artist Teoman Irmak, came up with a number of titles that were to prove very popular indeed. Using the proven formula of instant graphics held in memory, combined with a sound plot, and written on the system developed by Brian for the conversions, Gremlins was International UK's runaway success of 1985, outselling all other AI UK titles, and coming second only to Level 9's Red Moon in the C+VGGolden Joystick Awards. AI UK went on to produce the highly successful Robin of Sherwood, and the first of a Fighting Fantasy series, Seas of Blood. With the Adventure International contract terminated Mike's operation will rest on Adventure Soft Ltd. As well as publishing Questprobes, US Gold will publish future Adventure Soft games, leaving Mike, assisted by his wife and business partner Tricia, to look after mail-order and customer support. That doesn't mean Mike has lost his interest in Questprobe, nor the original Scott Adams series. Adventure Soft will carry out all the conversions. The games will come from the same stable. If the label is changing, so is the team producing the games. Brian Howarth has left to take up a job in business software. His Mysterious Adventures will continue to be available through Adventure Soft. Mike has added Roger Taylor to the team. After converting Questprobe 3, using his own adventure system designed to handle an input of up to four significant words. Roger went to work on a completely new system, and this accepts sentences as complex as those of Infocom games. To complement the new adventure system, Mike has commissioned a new graphics system, and recruited another artist, Stefan Ufnowski, whose first project has been Rebel Planet, second game in the Fighting Fantasy series. With all these changes, how does the adventure player get hold of the games or hintsheets, if he can't find them in the local shop? All the existing Mysterious Adventures, including new Commodore 16 versions, plus Seas of Blood, and the original Scott Adams series, may be obtained by mail order from Adventure Soft UK Ltd., PO Box 786, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands B75 7SL. Conversion to new micros will continue, and they will also be available by mail order. Supplier: US Gold/Adventure Soft Machine: Spectrum 48k, Commodore 64, Amstrad, BBC and Electron, (text only: Price: .95 (Spectrum, C64, Amstrad) .95 (BBC/Electron) The mighty Arcadian Empire is tightening its grip on the galaxy, and leaders of the secret earth organisation SAROS prepare you for a daring mission to strike at the heart of the invaders to destroy the QUEEN computer that controls and organises the Arcadian troops. Travelling as a merchant, you must seek out earth spies who have sent on ahead to discover the nine binary digits that will let you into the building housing the computer. Standing on the command deck of the Caydia-your ship-you follow a pre-programmed flight path to the planets Tropos, Halmurus, and Arcadion. As you near Tropos, the Caydia computer reports an unidentified craft following your flight coordinates. You try evasive action, and in doing so intercepta message from the craft: UHILOLEK IKA GRAZDXZ. A sinister alien tongue or a secret coded message? Meanwhile, you make a quick tour of the ship, to equip yourself for your visit to Tropos. Should you take the space scooter for landborne transport? Chance would be a fine thing but never mind, your repair droid has that situation well in hand! Well, perhaps on the next planet... The faint smell of domestadroid reaches your nostrils as you explore the passenger cabins. Obviously the hydrobeds have recently been serviced. Eventually, armed with rations, a weapon, and a few other essentials (or perhaps they are completely useless?) the Caydia lands and, after wrestling with the airlock controls, you disembark. Passing through customs at Tropos can be a tricky business Leaving the spaceport itself can be even more damaging but as you wont have time to sample the night life perhaps you will persuade the natives to let you through. Now to seek out your contact, and start in earnest on the trail of the binary code you need for the grand finale. Is he in Cos-Mop, the not-so-friendly galactic store (motto: You buys it, you keeps it). or perhaps the local hotel? The game is full of humour, and there are plenty of strange gadgets to learn to use, such as the Phonic Fork, or Zelta Blanket... Let me warn you now-Stefan Ufnowski has not only produced 219 IHRE "


"With the long-awaited The Fantastic Four adventure surprisingly coming from US/Gold and not from Adventure International the name so closely associated with the Questprobe series-fans will no doubt be wondering what's up on the adventure scene.

The system now used by Adventure Soft is in two parts, each running on a different computer. The program and text part of the business is handled by Roger Taylor's utility, which runs on a BBC micro, other versions being created with a cross-compiler. Processing much more complex sentences than seen before in an Al game, the parser will, for example, handle \"it\" as in \"get the apple and eat it\". No longer will the text format on the screen show discrete entries for location, exits and objects present. All the text will flow together, and this is achieved by using what Mike calls \"flannels\"! Using an example from Rebel Planet to demonstrate the technique, the text started: \"You are in a...\". As far as the program is concerned, the word YOU was the entire location description, and all that followed was a number of \"flannels\" text phrases describing the current state of the location, which are moved into and out of the location as required by the state of the game. The graphics are created on an Apricot, using an icon driven graphics creator utility, specified by Mike, and programmed by an associate of his. First, the artist designs a graphics character as the building blocks for his pictures. These are then saved to disk, but can be called back for display and alteration, using a mouse to select the picture name from the list of screens already created. The system provides for animation to a degree rarely seen in graphic adventures. No longer will you get minor and continous \"flashing\" movements from small characters, but sequentially displayed whole frames, like in a movie. The two separate parts are brought together in the finished game, but now, the graphics are held in memory, allowing them to be displayed instantly, rather than have to be drawn and filled by the program-the slow process that has given graphics in adventures a bad name amongst enthusiasts. When the two parts are combined, a typical game will have 100 pictures in 22k of RAM, leaving adequate space, even on a 48k Spectrum, for a meaty adventure, especially when it is bome in mind that Roger can squeeze A UW 070 OF IS Origues The first game to show off the new system, will be Rebel Planet, second in the Fighting Fantasy series of adventures. Stefan Ufnowski, brought in originally to create the graphics, showed Mike a Quilled adventure he had written for his own amusement, and offered to write the Rebel Planet plot. Mike was impressed, and Stefan ended up producing the whole game. Following hard on its heels will be Temple of Terror, written by Mike Woodroffe and drawn by Teoman Irmak. Some of Temple's graphics have already been created, including the animation. Mike took me for a ride on the back of an eagle, whose wing span filled the entire width of the screen, and by the end of the journey, I had begun to feel quite air sick! Another new feature in the game will be a real time chase. \"It won't be any good just sitting there wondering what to do next,\" says Mike, \"If the player doesn't react as he would in real life, it will be too late to do anything!\" \"Infocom plus graphics, on cassette,\"is Mike's claim. Certainly the parser is comparable; all that is needed now is machines with more memory. 26k can accomodate a complex and entertaining adventure, but to be fair, with far less detailed text than is the hallmark of Infocom games. But Adventure Soft are heading that way, and when 128k machines have reached the mass market, Mike and his team will be ideally placed to produce some stunning adventures for them. "

Sigma Press Price: .95 \"A new way to generate adventure games\" this book claims. It is essentially the description of an adventure creator utility, plus a full listing for a BBC micro (which must have at least one disk drive) A large section of the book is taken up with a listing of the Adventure Description Language (ADL) which is also available on a no-frills disk for the fainthearted. The utility was developed at Gronigen University in the Netherlands, on a PDP11, and, it is claimed, can be converted for adventure. other micros with reasonable ease. Unfortunately, the book starts off However, there is more to the on the wrong foot, with a flawed book than just a listing. The logic history of adventure games, which behind an adventure program is gives the first clue that it is the work investigated, and translated into of computer academics, rather terms of the ADL which consists of than that of proven adventure four parts: a map of locations, authors. location descriptions, dictionary of Scott Adams is credited with words and word descriptions. pioneering the micro-adventure The method of operation of the scene (true), but by implementing ADL is explained in great detail the Colossal Cave adventure on a from a highly theoretical point of 16k TRS-80 (false). view, in the style of a formal text With an explanation of why book.

The hardware plugs into the micro's expansion port (where it also gets its power) and enables a series of tiny motors attached by wires to put the robots through their paces.

Initially for the C64, Jet will appear later in ST and Amiga versions. The Amiga demo, by the way, is awesome.  Star Raiders 2 will be out soon. It's a fast action game containing elements from the original 1980 version, along with parts from the not-released Last Starfighter.

One of the great things about going to the movies is the way the sound wraps around you. Jets flying overhead, or an energy bolt blasting across the screen. These exciting audio effects seem to disappear when you view the film at home on your video cassette recorder. But I just saw an amazing device, called the SSI-720, which actually reaches in and yanks out this special sound quality and restores it to you. President David Tausik explained to me that there is a Dolby \"surround channel\"track heard in movie theatres. A device decodes this sound we role of the captain of the starship Enterprise. As in the Star Trek 2 film, there are a number of difficult scenarios that you must conquer in order to pass the test. This is a text game with a twist.

The Amusement Trades Exhibition International, held in London displayed the new pinball machines, writes TIM SHARP. The general concensus of expert members of the Pinball Owners Association was that Premier's Rock was the best of the bunch. I liked Williams' Comet as well. Rock is the best thing yet from Premier, as good as some of the early 80's machines from predecessor Gottlieb. The most interesting thing about it is the sound Tots of rock music keeping the beat going all through the game. In fact, hitting targets or rollovers, creates new sounds which seem to be fitted in with the beat of the music playing at the time, making the rock sound heard unique to your particular game. Williams' Comet is a machine which I liked as I'm interested in its theme of amusement park rides. It's the first pinball in which it is possible to score one million points in one shot-though it can only be done on the third ball and needs a lot of setting up. The sounds on Comet include screaming passengers and rolling wheel sounds, motorcycle engines rev at the cycle jump, ducks quack at the shooting gallery, train whistles blow and voices call out at you to try the various rides. Altogether a very enjoyable game to play with three ramps (corkscrew, roller coaster and cycle jump) and several other types of fairground \"rides\" to tempt you. There was a pin from Game Plan called Cyclopes and, again some P.O.A. members liked this multi-ball machine. Bally had yet another in their long line of pool theme pinballs with Eight Ball Champ. I didn't even bother playing it can't they come up with something From Italy came Pool Champion and Black Belt, both from Zaccaria. The Black Belt should appeal to the martial arts fans. There was a really excellent video pinball the best I've seen, with four different levels like four different machines.

"collectis Golden Tony Kavanagh necks up the Armen and certificate A Style From far and wide they travelled, eager with anticipation. The crème de la crème of Britain's computer games industry was makingsits annual pilgrimage to London for the Computer+Video Games Golden Joystick Awards for 1985. Anybody who is anybody in the games world was there for what has become the most presitigious awards ceremony in the industry. And C+VG really pushed the boat out-literally. We hired a plush Thames riverboat for an afternoon of cruising up and down the river, enjoying champagne, wine and a slap up meal. Not only that, Jools Holland, Famed presenter of The Tube, television's premiere rock show, was there to present the awards with C+VG's Editor, Tim Metcalfe, resplendent in bright red suede shoes. The Golden Joystick awards are extra special because you, the readers, vote for them. What you say counts. For the past two years, Ultimate walked off with the two top awards, thatof Game of The Year and Software House of The Year. But Melbourne House has broken that dominance by taking both awards. The Way of The Exploding fist was just unbeatable in 1985. The full results are printed elsewhere on this page but the other Golden Joysticks went to Activision for Little Computer People as Best Original Game of 1985; Level 9's Red Moon was the Best Adventure Game; PSS Captured The Best Strategy game award with Theatre Europe; Elite's Commando came top for The Best Arcade-Style Game; Steven Crow was voted Top Programmer for his work on Wizard's Lair and Starquake for Bubblebus. There was only one real disappointment about the Golden Joystick Awards. And that was because we could not invite all C+VG's readers along for the day. But you weren't foregotten. In their acceptance speeches all the software houses said a big thanks to you for taking the time and trouble to vote. Now we're looking forward to the 1986C+VG Golden Joystick Awards, which will be held at the beginning of next year. WINNER Paulo Byrne GEOFTHE O iw gold ticks Margarelvustin colleiter word "

I think the editor made him up to satisfy his warped and twisted sense of humour. I know he has a warped and twisted sense of humour because I read C+VG each month. Please tell me.

I sent away for a modem from Modem House on the 14th October 1985. After waiting two months the modem had still not arrived. I phoned them many times, but I got the same excuse: 'We are waiting on the new Mustang cartridge'. I got a bit fed up of waiting so I cancelled it. Everything went fine they said, and the cheque would be sent straight after the New Year. I am still waiting on the cheque to arrive. I phone them every week but I always get the same excuse. Two weeks ago they said it had been posted, but the mailbag containing the cheque had been lost. I phoned later in the week and they said it hadn't been posted.

Is it possible in the future, you could have a feature on spin off games from TV and films. So many games from these days originate from one of these mediums. Also, can you let us know if any games based on other sci-fi films will be coming out in the future as these are my favourite. Seth Bishop The Wirral Otiss says: No. Why should we? What? The Editor's nodding. I presume that means he agrees with you, Seth.  Why don't you get rid of the listings in C+VG. They are so BORING! And half the games you print don't work.

When we agreed to run the offer, we also thought the games would be out fairly soon. Sorry and all that. Big Red is even at this moment waiting outside the System 3 office block swinging a very large bit of twisted metal. I think it once was a lamp standard. Anyway you know what will happen if they don't come up with the goods soon...  Don't think I'm complaining but why on earth do you still print program listings each month? Do people really sit down and spend hours typing them in? And what is the end result? With the best will in the world the game is never stunning. Why not use the space for more features, reviews, competitions etc. John Dockley, Ware. Otiss says: We dropped the listings this kissue, Robin, and gave the space over to our Elite guide. But what do the rest of you think. Are listings outdated? Or are they a source of cheap software? Let us known what YOU think. I think there is an ulterior motive here. If the listings go what happens to the Bughunters? Unemployed robots, that's what. I think your competitions are really ace!! No other magazine encourages young artists like myself to exercise their talents in drawing. In the future could we have a competition to design a record sleeve or even a video box!
