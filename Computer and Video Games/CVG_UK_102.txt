"BASEBALL STARS BRAVE NEW WORLD The hottest, and possibly the most powerful console yet is just about to hit the streets! Coin-op giant SNK (the folks who brought you the gun-toting hits Ikari Warriors and Guerrilla War, to name but two) are ready to launch the Neo Geo (New World) and that's just what it is! The console's slimline, black casing hides a collection of 16 and 8 bit processors, together with a stack of cusplayed at home. What's more, the Neo tom sound and graphic handling chips, Geo games cartridges are capable of which work together to produce some storing staggering amounts of data, up of the most awesome games to be to wait for it FORTY megabytes!

The game is due out \"soon\", but it you want to know a bit more about the subject, either get yourself down to the video shop and pick up a copy of the film Zulu (starring Stanley Baker and Michael Caine in his first celluloid excursion) or be the first to send in the title of the second film in the Zulu series and you could win a copy of the VHS video to keep for always.

"Just think of the games you'd be able NO STRINGS ATTACHED Just think of the games you'd be able to play with a cart that size!!! But don't get too excited yet, because the cost of this equipment is a tad higher than yer usual console gear. For the console itself, we're talking a tenner off three hundred quid. And if you think that's expensive, what about the software, which comes in at a weighty  not that much cheaper than a PC Engine! SNK are optimistic, however, and predict first year sales Infra-red joysticks are nothing new (there was an absolute stack of them launched years ago none of them worked particularly well though) but this latest attempt from Spectravideo could be a winner. The Spectravideo IR Infra-red Joystick comes in two parts the pistolshaped stick itself and the infra-red receiver, which you plug into the back of your computer. This box picks up the infra-red signals sent by the stick when you move it and translates them into the signals the computer expects. It works up to a distance of 30 feet, which is handy if you have very good eyesight and a very long living room. The joystick is compatible with most computers equipped with an Atari style D-plug and it will be in the shops by the end of April, costing .95. virgatlartie NEO-GEO figures of 300,000 for the machines and 1.2 million for carts. The Neo Geo is being launched in Japan this month, and no doubt one or two mail order firms will have their hands on a couple of machines by mid-Spring, so start saving your pennies or get searching for a leprechaun. SEGA MASTERS NOPIX No. 2 Why are these people smiling? Well, the four in the front are the finalists of Sega's nationwide search for the top Master System games players. On March 9th, the fortunate foursome were shipped down to Gatwick Airport for a final playoff aboard a Virgin Atlantic 747. After heated bouts of World Grand Prix, California Games and RType, Paul Fawson (on the left) emerged the victor. Still, no-one went away empty handed, as all four were then flown over to New York for four days of sightseeing and stuff (there are a lot of fours in this news story aren't there?) And the four folks in the back row? Well, they're all Sega employees who are obviously smiling because they got a four-day freebie in New York (jammy bleeders). publicise their collaboration on the production of Castle Master (reviewed on page 86 of this very issue!). We're considering making the Inane Promopix slot a regular feature, so, publicityseeking softcos, get snapping! A-MIGA-DRIVE LATEST We've had an unbelievable amount of letters and phone calls over the past month about the fantastic new A-Migadrive converter, so we decided that it's time to come clean...ha ha, FOOLED YOUI Didn't you check the date on the cover? In case you're wondering, here's how you can build an A-Migadrive of your own, so mums and Sega executives, leave the room now. Take a Japanese-to-UK Nintendo cartridge converter, and place the two plastic bits on top of each other to make it look bulky and realistic. Then rip the label off a handy Megadrive cartridge (you may need an adult to help) and balance it in the Nintendo converter. Run a Centronics printer cable between the converter and the underside of the Amiga, then photograph the whole thing with the Japanese instructions on the Megadrive cartridge facing the camera (always assume that the majority of your audience can't read Japanese). Then, hey presto a breakthrough in technology! Or not, as the case may be. But what about that screenshot showing the converted TV Sports Basketball? First, we expanded the screen using the little knob at the back of our 1084 monitor, then fiddled about with our dodgy SCART lead so that the colour changed. And there you have it; one enormous stitch-up on your part, and one gigantic giggle for us lot nice idea though, isn't it! "

Loads of times, we bet. Well, this new compilation lets you (sort of) do just that. Acco lade's All Time Favourites includes Test Drive (reasonable race-around-amountain-in-the-fast-car of-your-choice simulator). Hardball (nifty baseball simulator), Mini-Putt (jolly seaside pastime simulator) and Apollo 18 (excellent moonshot simulator). It's out now on PC and C64 disk for .99 and .99 respectively. COMPILATIONSVILLE III Also new on the compilation scene is Electronic Zoo's Top 20 Solid Gold pack, which comprises 20 old C64 games for .99. The games are (deep breath): Top Fuel Challenge (dire drag-racer game), Richard Petty's Talledega (mediocre driving game). Motor Mania (another mediocre driving game), Time Tunnel (tragic arcade adventure), High Noon (jolly cowboy shoot-out), Aztec Challenge (very strange, but playable multi-level platform/action/puzzle game), Forbidden Forest (atmospheric 3D shoot 'em up). Delta Man (we've never heard of this one), Slinky (mildly enjoyable Q*Bert game), Caverns of Khafka (odd platform quest), Mediator (never heard of that one either), Fearless Fred (nor this one), Spite and Malice (nor even this one), Legend of Knucker Hole (unusual platform affair), Psycastria (a very poor Uridium clone), Beyond Forbidden Forest (much-enhanced sequel to Forbidden Forest), Chernobyl (intriguing power station simulator), Professor IQ (another one we've never heard of). Grand Master Chess (passable) and Potty Pigeon (wacky arcade adventure from Tony Crowther). The gems just about make up for the duds, which, for 75p each, aren't such bad value for money at all.

If your poor old bod is getting you down why not ditch it, stick your mind into electronic storage and let a holographic body keep up appearances? I'll tell you why not.

When a bit of running around or jumping is essential to the quest, you can switch the hologram into the form of either Metalisis (an agile woman with a mean kick), or Hammerfist (a meaty bloke with a laser-firing jackhammer-hand). The Master's complex is made up of 128 screens, all packed with his technicians and robots programmed for defence. These villains constantly assail our heroes, draining their energy while they bash up security consoles to open the way to the next room Hammerfist The first thing that strikes 003476 you about Hammerfist is the very complex control system which requires a variety of joystick movements accompanied by double and even triple fire button presses(1). Initially, it all seems a bit too much, but persevere for a ten minutes or so and you soon get into the swing of things. Once you get stuck into the gameplay Hammerfist becomes very enjoyable.

"REVIEW C+VG ZYRASTY BY US GOLD The scene is mid 16th cen. tury Japan. Two powerful dynasties, the evil Kai clan and the good Han family, are locked in a tremendous power struggle. War has been raging for weeks and things are looking grim for the Han dynasty. Desperate measures have to be taken... Enter the player as one of four key Han fighters either Lui Bei, Kuan Yu, Shang Fei or Shao Yun. What you've got to do is get on your horse and ride a suicide mission straight at the Kai army, break through their ranks then kill all their generals. This involves hacking and slashing your way through horizontally scrolling landscapes packed with foot soldiers, avoiding their swords and arrows to keep your energy bar healthy, confronting the general at the end of each level and wearing down his energy bar with repeated sword or lance strikes before he does the same to you. As you travel further into the game the generals become tougher and tougher, and there are also war machines to destroy, rock falls to dodge, and energy-sapping fireballs to ride around. This mission is a tough one but if you succeed and kill all the generals, the Kai army will be in complete confusion, allowing the Han forces to easily sweep to victory. Failure, though, means an end to your dynasty. A Shang Fei gets down to some brandishing with his Snake Halberd "


"EVIEW WALANG PE. 028/016 TICS: KELIDE A Shang Fei shows no mercy with his pointy stick. .99 I liked this game a lot in the arcades, and I'm pleased to see that this conversion retains the coin-op's great playability and presentation. At the start of the game, where you pick the member of the Han family you want to play, there are some beautifully drawn static screens. In the game itself the tiny soldier sprites are really nicely drawn and animated, and the main horse sprite is excellent. The action is pretty tough, and at first it seems like there are just too many foot soldiers and archers to cope with and the generals certainly take a lot of beating! However, practice makes perfect, and after a while you're soon sweeping through the ranks scattering soldiers like ninepins which is great fun! Dynasty Wars is a slick, graphically brilliant and very playable game which offers an unusual twist on the beat 'em up theme. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's well worth checking out JULIAN RIGNALL GRAPHICS 91% SOUND 83% VALUE 80% PLAYABILITY 87% OVERALL 85% UPDATE We've seen early demos of the Spectrum and C64 versions, and both are looking good, particularly the Spectrum, which has some marvellous monochrome graphics.

"EVIEW TIIMIIIII UPDATE An Amiga version is in the pipeline, and as usual it should feature better graphics and sound. No other versions are planned. A Wake the sleeping troll and you'll be sorry! Thor's no fan of rolling stones. BY FIREBIRD FIRE & BRIMSTONE .99 At first glance the platform shoot 'em up action and terrific graphics make this look like a terrific Ghouls 'n' Ghosts clone. If only programmer Steve Bak had left it at that, but instead he's added puzzle elements which make the gameplay very frustrating. There are hidden deathtraps everywhere and they act so quickly that you get no time to escape disaster. That would be frustrating enough, but the randomness of the potions can also work against you. For instance, by the fifth screen on level one you should have picked up three potions, but if the game hasn't made one of them a bridge potion, you might as well reset and start again because there's no way to continue beyond that screen! If you create a bridge you can continue to screen six, but if you die there, the game sends you back to screen five which is now impassible again because the bridge has disappeared! There's an awful lot to Fire and Brimstone and the game looks superb, but you'd have to be endowed with superhuman gamesplaying powers and a lot of luck to fully appreciate its merits.

INNEKTUBI THRASH ACBO Some multi-event sports simulations are just a collection of superficial games with the emphasis on quantity, not quality. Not Ski or Die! As well as being fun to play, all five events have plenty of depth and are all challenging and enjoyable games in their own right. My particular favourites are the brilliant Toobin'inspired innertube thrash (which is great fun in twoplayer mode it's impossible not to scream and shout at your opponent, especially if he or she punctures your toob) and the marvellous Operation Wolf-style snowball blast. None of the events are easy to master, and there's loads of scope to constantly improve your scores (and get them on the auto-save record table)! The graphics are brilliant, with superb attention to detail just watch what happens when you blast a snowballer in the face at close range, for example. Ski or Die is by far the best sports game available on the PC, and the best thing of all is that you don't need a top-of-the-range PC to appreciate it!

Career around Aintree in the quest for success over one, five or ten seasons; place bets on the favourites and buy new stable stock with your winnings. The race presentation features a combination of overhead and side-on views. Overhead is more detailed, showing all the other horses in the race, but side-on allows you to time the jumps perfectly. Riding a horse and whipping it around a race course is no task for the fainthearted. Jump too soon or too late and your season ends in failure. Thrash the beast too hard and its legs give way, but let it off lightly and you won't see the leaders for dust. A 66-1! If only you'd put your money on Pirate Son! BY ELITE UPDATE The Spectrum version has been around for about four years (!), but no other versions are planned. IIIIIIIIII AMIGA .99 Creating a game based on horse racing is an ambitious idea, and Elite have carried it off very well. Every aspect from betting through buying horses to winning a race has been brilliantly executed, including a neat control and display system, and some of the best sampled speech I've ever heard on the Amiga. The betting sequences are a good idea, too the form book doesn't guarantee the winner, so plonking half your initial capital on the race favourite could leave you with a ,000-shaped hole in your pocket. There are only a couple of drawbacks: the long-term monotony of racing and the cumbersome postrace results sequence each element of speech is loaded in separately, and it takes too long before you're racing again. A practice ride option would have helped to get you into the swing of competition, and would have provided an initial way round the program's occasional slowness. Apart from that, the animation of the horses is realistic and the sound effects appropriately sparse. It's really a question of horses for courses: if you like a bet on the nags, take a look.

"EVIEW MMTIMIZ UPDATE An Amiga version of Jumping Jackson is scheduled for release at the same time as the ST version, at about the end of April. It's reputed to have even more sampled music, and the same enjoyable gameplay as the version reviewed here. umping Jack Son is a fat little blob descended from the legendary Jumping Jack Flash, whose quest in life is to cut put the grooviness back into a world full of dull classical music. The only thing that will free the spirit of rock 'n' roll is Elvis' first single, which is hidden somewhere amongst a psychedelic maze of platforms, and Jack's musical lineage makes him the blob for the job. To pass between the 16 different mazes, Jack has to collect hidden records then put them all on turntables to complete a tune. To reveal the discs he has to pass over groups of tiles which change colour as he steps on them. A record appears when Jack BY INFOGRAMES 010CO IIIIIIIIIII A Both records on the turntables time for escape! Screen shot from Alari ST venion. JACK SON Another level complete, but beware the trumpet! KZEE has turned a group of four tiles the same colour, then when it's placed on the turntable of the corresponding col our, another part of the tune plays. It would be simple if that was all there was to it, but while Jack's doing this he's being chased by a gang of musical baddies in the shape of trumpets, drums and other classical instruments which can be dodged or blocked by dropping one of your three cassettes. You can also pick up bonus items like hamburgers, bottles of Coke, musical notes and jukeboxes which allow Jackson to carry more than one record at a time. .99 Jumping Jack Son is a great game, with very jolly graphics (especially the fat, bouncy hero), great sampled tunes and sound effects, and a very addictive game underneath. It starts off very easy, with just a couple of turntables to fill and no enemies to avoid, but after just a couple of levels things really start to move. The baddies are a bit thick, hopping around almost willy-nilly, totally unconcerned with where you may be. But there's no room for carelessness when there are more than one of them on the screen, or if you're down a tile-wide path, you've run out of cassettes and there's a deadly trumpet bouncing your way. As well as the 16 normal levels there are a couple of bonus stages in there too, which are frustrating to begin with, but after a while they serve as a worthwhile break from the main game. All in all, what we have here is a jolly arcade puzzle game which should go down well with anybody. 300 The first Challenge level-tricky!

VIIIIII AMIGA .99 Games set in the Wild Mid-West are a rarity these days, but, as far as gameplay goes, Colorado is pretty familiar stuff. This walk-chop-and-collect malarkey has been entertaining 16 bit owners since 1986 when Psygnosis brought out Barbarian, and it doesn't seem to have progressed a whole lot since. Wander around dozens of screens, beat up some understandably hostile Indians and think up tenuous links between objects and adverse circumstances. Colorado is rather slow-paced, so if you aren't heavily into this type of game, all the trekking between screens will become tiresome after a while. Luckily, the paddling-down-the-river subgame is rather more action-packed and I'm ashamed to admit that my happiest moments with this game were spent splatting people in the mush with my paddle. The graphics are pretty but samey, and the characters' are stiffly animated, making them occasionally look robotic. Sound doesn't play a major part in the gameplay, and the Amiga's sound circuitry busies itself with rendering an insipid tune, and muffled speech samples. If games like this really are your bag, Colorado could be worth tracking down, but more lively players should look elsewhere for their fun.

For instance, I was fouled in the opposition's penalty area, but was I awarded the penalty? Was I hell. Don't get me wrong, I'm not about to slag Player Manager into the ground, but after many months of playing Kick Off and enjoying it immensely, I expected much better things from the follow-up.

OVERALL 90% 1111111111111 TIIIIIIIII AMIGA .99 Xenomorph is an almost instantly appealing game, due partly to its Dungeon Master look. The feeling of solitude is total (not even your usually friendly computer will speak to you!) until your first contact with the allen attackers and that turns out to be something of a shock! The aliens and the scenery are nicely drawn and, while the animation is jerky, it isn't a hindrance to the overall atmosphere. There is a lot to do in Xenomorph, and it's imperative that you plan ahead to stay alive, and it's probably wise to make a map. I'm writing this review after a four hour session of blundering around during which I collected most of the chips, though now I haven't got enough strength to last longer than another half-hour. The game's addictive qualities ensure that I'll return time and time again until that lonely little janitor escapes to sweep floors in more hospitable parts of the cosmos!

Progression isn't linear: there's usually more than one way to solve a puzzle, and if you just want to wander around the castle admiring the scenery, you can. It's also the first Freescape game to be developed primarily for 16bit, so there's an animated Intro sequence, a 20% larger screen, much more object detail (rather than simple polygons) and the addition of an action hand. There's so much to do it will take ages to finish even with minimum points.

"OEVIEWPO WWIIIII IIIIIIII PC .99 \"Laura, dear. Please excuse me. I'm going to go freshen up in the bathroom. Why don't you explore the estate a bit?\" A Hmm, Lillian's acting rather suspiciously... COLONEL'S BEQUEST The latest from the Sierra stable, while sticking to the same basic style, turns out to be very different from the King's Quest series, and is a much more challenging and enjoyable game. The programmers have opted for a Miss Marple-esque \"who's-gonna-do-it\" murder enquiry, and it works exceedingly well. The graphic style, which many a reviewer has moaned about over the years, is, I think, extremely impressive, with animated rooms as well as characters and the display adapts itself to a colour or monochrome system to make the onscreen action easier to follow. Jam-packed into four 3.5\" disks, Colonel's Bequest is an immense game, but if you're playing on a sub-10MHz machine it can be irritatingly sluggish. But the game is loaded with so many features and surprises that a slow update is something which you'll be prepared to put up with. Black humour plays a considerable part in Colonel's Bequest, and you'll find yourself chuckling heartily when the loose chandelier falls on top of you, or if you're caught in the shower by the Norman Bates-type knife maniac! All in all, if you aren't put off by the slow pace of the game then this superb murder mystery is a must. PAUL RAND  RAH :: . OOOO .. . SEAT BY SIERRA olonel Henri Dijon is at death's door.

The graphics and sound are great, with plenty of colourful backgrounds and excellent sprites, but when it actually comes down to playing the events themselves, there's really not much to them. Caber toss, log rolling and barrel jumping are all very simple indeed, and require hardly any skill to master. The only event that comes anywhere near the quality of the ones in California Games is bull riding, which is great fun and tough too!

So, the cartridge also carries a heavily soupedup version of the game with prettier graphics, extra weapons, but fundamentally the same gameplay (which! hope I can assume you'll be familiar with).

Mind you this really is a perfect conversion, right from the sound effects down to the invaders fiddling with the lettering on the attract screen and the colours on the game screen simulating the coloured strips of transparent plastic. Nostalgia value aside, the straight conversion isn't worth much as a game, but the updated version is, surprisingly, quite addictive. This fact is probably down to the pretty graphics (the spacescape backdrops are superb) and the gameplay which is livened up no end by those weirdo weapons.

The player sprites really are something else, perfectly formed and superbly animated, and they rush around that court as if there were no tomorrow! And then there's the full-screen animation views, which are unbelievable! There's almost half a dozen of them, and as well as adding even more to the look of the game, having to actually interact on these screens gives them a real purpose. A wealth of options on the front-end lets the player fine tune the game to meet his particular skills, and there's a host of charming little touches throughout, such as the dancing girls at half-time and the cheerleaders who burst onto the scene when someone scores.

Tiki escaped by a whisker, and made it his business to go off in search of his imprisoned pals before they end up in horrible, cramped cages But the task isn't as easy as he first imagined.

PARANOIA 59100 BY NAXAT It's all very well setting out in I your fighter craft to blast away at all and sundry, but you're not going to get very far if your spaceship's a bit poo. Such is the state of your vessel in this game, but at the moment you're riled enough not to care about trivialities like certain fiery death. You've heard that the boss of this planet has been spreading nasty rumours about your parentage and, paranoid fool that you are, you've decided to get your own back. This does however, put you into a sticky situation, because he happens to be the ruler of fourteen galacPC ENGINE .90 Producing a shoot 'em up which is tough enough to sult hardened blasters and yet still playable is always difficult, but Naxat have come very close to achieving this with Paranola. Right from the beginning the bullets fly around the screen, keeping you right on your toes. But instead of the game becoming an unplayable drag, it's addictive enough to keep you coming back for more. It's not a fantastic looker, although the sprites and backdrops are more than adequately drawn and coloured, and there's some good, meaty tunes to keep you bopping through the levels. There are visually more exciting Engine shoot 'em ups available, but I would imagine that, because of its mix of difficulty and addictiveness, Paranoia could still be an oftplayed game long after others have been completed and stowed in a cupboard.

The action is fast and furious maybe a bit too easy on the lower levels but later on (around level 14) things really start getting tough, with some tricky situations to guide Robo Kid through. The only annoying thing is that when you lose certain weapons on higher levels, it's incredibly difficult to carry on, but if you ignore that, Atomic Robo Kid is an extremely slick and polished blaster that should go down a bomb with any PC Engine shoot 'em up fan.
