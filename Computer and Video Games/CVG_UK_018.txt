"BEEB GETS THE GAMING BUG This here's my newsagentes Computer gaming is making its first impression on television this month in a Saturday morning programme which is taking over the Saturday Super Store slot. Get Set (for Summer) will be featuring computer games throughout its 16 week series which runs up until the school summer holidays. The programme aims to give practical ideas on new hobbies, sports and other activities to try out or take up during the summer holiday. And series producer Tony Harrison is a home computer owner keen to demonstrate the new world which a microcomputer can open up The first programme in the series goes out on April 2nd and features not only home computers but also TV games centres and arcade machines. And the series is also unique in having a microcomputer-controlled system of \"cue-ing\" programme presenters Mark Curry and newcomer Deborah Appleby. This system runs on a BBC Microcomputer and was written by the producer's son Daniel The presenters will be able to look up during the programme to check on how much time is left on any particular interview or demonstration. Events during the programme can be reshuffled on the screen to change the order of programme features or fit in new items. Computer & Video Games will be helping out during the series and the slot on Saturday April 16th will be of particular interest to all computer games programmers. As home computing comes of age throughout Britain it MONTE is ironic to think that 1983 may go down as the Year of the Home Video Game. Our Video Screens section has already been full of the rich promise of new games and new machines which should be with us before 1983 ends. The Colecovision launch should (lawsuits permitting) provide the industry with some much-needed Me 'n my newsagent are real close. His name's Bill or Fred or something... Anyway we got an arrangement. Every month, you know what he does? He looks out my copy of Computer & Video Games and keeps it, just for me. So none of the other punks on the street can get hold of my copy. And that's important to me. Mebbe it's important to you too. So go n' see your newsagent with that coupon below all filled out. If he's like Harry here, you're gonna like him. To my newsagent: Please deliver/ reserve me a copy of Computer and Video Games every month. Price 75p. Name ... Address compatibility when it adds the Atari and Intellivision expansion modules. Intellivision's manufacturers, Mattel, are opening up the software market by bringing out their top games in Atari format, on the M Network series. In our May issue, Eugene Lacey takes a look at the new way to cut the cost of home video gaming by renting the cartridges rather than paying around  plus to find out you've tired of the game after the first couple of days. Several companies have sprung up offering cartridges for hire and the latest move is for public libraries to open up a software section too. Arcade games players will have another chance to enter our Best Arcade Player Championship and we'll be printing up some scores to aim at on different machines in our record breakers section. But although the records give some idea of what is possible, remember that they still have to reproduce those scores and get them signed by the arcade owner in the next three months. Mad Max is the most interesting listing we've had for some time. Our reviewer rates it as the best driving game he has ever come across on the Sharp and the course certainly looks to include some fascinating features. So rev up and get ready to drive off into the future with Mad Max in May. Add a new dimension to gobbling games with the Ghost's Revenge by Gareth Jones. This is a novel two-player extravaganza for the Dragon 32 which could spell the end of Pacmen as we know them! One player tries to munch his way out of trouble. the other takes control of the ghostly pursuers. Then there's Tank Battle for the BBC B and an arcade-style attraction called Grow-Worm wriggling its way out of the Atari 400/800. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 5 "

Dear Sir, I have calculated my score to be just outside the Top 10 Seventh Empire commanders you published last issue and I'm kicking myself for not following Mr Tactico's example and Plundering rather than Cargo-ing. My two Cargo moves were both robbed of profit by greedy pirates and I wonder if there's any profit to be had in ever travelling by Gateway except on a Plunder mission. Is this a valid flaw in Seventh Empire? Please comment. Still, I can congratulate myself on some good trading and I am enjoying a marvellous sense of anticipation awaiting next month's results. D. Andrews, Knightsfield, Welwyn Garden City.

"IMPERIAL LOSERS. COMMANDING please let us know THOSE STICKS Craig Heath,\" 32) Dear Sir If, in the Seventh Empire, a person making negative profit ends his turn on the same star as an Imperial Ship, will he lose twice as much or half as much? And how do I control an Imperial Ship? Stephen Loughran, Agamemnon Road, London, NW6 Editor's reply: He loses twice as much. Stephen, which means that Imperial Ships can be used to inflict hard times on rivals, as well as boosting your own profits. It makes these ships a double-edged weapon. A ship can be controlled by putting all your ships into stars belonging to one empire and gambling that you will be the richest player to have tried to wrest control of that empire's ship.

"COMPETITION COMPETITION COMPETIT CALLING ALL ARCADE CHAMPIONS OK so your name features all over the high score charts in the local arcade. Well this form could take you into the big league with a crack at the Best Arcade Player title for 1983. Simply cut it out and take it along to the local pub or arcade where your favourite machine lurks, put on the best score you can and ask the arcade manager or pub owner to witness the score on this form. We'll need the name of the game, your score, where you achieved it and a date — plus your name and address of course. But don't put all your eggs in one basket. If there's another machine you fancy your chances on, use the next category to fill in your best score on that too. And there's a place for a third machine too. Your chances of reaching the final may increase with the number of different games you enter on. Should you produce a bad score, just try again. You may also find the leaflets on display in your local arcade. If you notch up a good score after forgetting to bring the leaflet out, ask the arcade manager whether he's got some you could use. The entries must be back with us by June 13th and should be sent to: Best Arcade Player, Computer & Video Games, Durrant House, 8 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5JB. Have you ever been beyond the Scramble maze? Or seen the treasures of Tutankahmun? Perhaps you're a regular destroyer of the Zaxxon robot or a veteran of the fourth Donkey Kong screen. If you're one of those intrepid few, for whom the arcade denizens hold no terror, then you should put your talents on show at our Best Arcade Player finals. The championships start right here at the bottom of this page with a form to fill in your top score achieved on three machines. These forms will be appearing in Computer & Video Games for the next two months and by June we should have some idea of who are the best arcade players around. Taitel Electronics, who have brought many of the current arcade favourites into the UK are helping us to organise a grand finals day with a top personality who also enjoys tackling electronic adversaries. Then we will invite all the top scorers on the most popular machines — which will be judged purely on your response along to show us what they can do and the best of these will be crowned the Best Arcade Player. A table-top arcade game is the prize for the winner and all the finalists will get an expenses-paid trip down to London to take part and probably see some of the latest arcade games around too. Last year the finalists were joined by the national press and Steve Davis, the top snooker star who also proved himself a dab hand at arcade games by taking on our champ Peter Edmonds at the game of Qix and beating him.

Bally's American team of top pinball designers are currently working out whether Alcatraz is likely to escape from their workshops. Alcatraz is the brainchild of Andrew Muir of Grove Road, Norwich, who won the Bally Pinball design competition we featured in our September issue. Andrew put the emphasis on skill with a barrier of drop targets which have to be knocked down to begin your escape path in an upper playfield. Players are also given the chance to spell out \"A-L-C-A-T-R-A-Z\" in the lower playfield. His game also featured a captured ball and trying to get a ball through a moving hole. The Bally judges were particularly impressed with the care and pinball knowledge Andrew displayed in his design. Bally's US marketing vice-president Tom Nieman, was so impressed with the high standard of the entry he split the competition into two and awarded a second prize in the video game category to Ian Boffin of Lych Way, Woking, for his Jaws game. Dave Adams of Bally UK entertained both winners at his Wembley HQ last month and presented lan with his Intellivision games centre and Andrew with a super Vector pintable to set up in his home in Norwich An additional bonus for Andrew came in the shape of The Pinball Owners' Association granting him free membership. And it turns out that our winner will be member number 1,000! Runners-up in the Pinball design class: Alexander Martin of Hamilton Crescent, Brentwood and David Payne, of Seaton Gardens, Ruislip. In the video games design class Ian Farrelly of Quarry Road, Portishead came second and third equal were Peter King, of Church Lane, Walthamstow and Ian Rainford of Peel Hall, Wythenshawe. Free subscriptions to C&VG are on their way to this lucky few. An anonymous fleet transmission was intercepted this month from the 15 players still wrapped up in the C&VG special Starweb game. Obviously a Berserker, keen not to give away his identity. Still we published it as it serves as a timely reflection on the poverty which still exists in points terms in some sectors of the galaxy. Since I started my struggle for galactic domination it has got ever more complicated. No longer is there an abundance of undiscovered worlds, easily captured or destroyed by my rampaging fleets. Not every planet is hard won by diplomacy or battle. As a Bergerker, I'm inclined to blow up planets, decimate populations and fill the universe with my robotic hordes. How ever, I've done very little of this concentrating upon creating an empire. Now that further expansion is difficult, I can just kill all my people and gain points quickly Doing this, I don't need any outside interference so I have tried to stay at peace with everyone. I am trading with a merchant and an artifact collector and so far, have met only two hostile players. One of these, an apostle, refuses to answer any of my messages while an extremely insolent space pirate has recently captured one of my fleets. Unless he returns it, I will start a holy war, hoping my many allies will join in to destroy him. Still the main problem is my unbelievably low galactic takeover rating. Just creeping over 100 points while other people have a thousand. RED, WHITE AND BLUE POSER Could you help Farmer Nure with his blooming problem from our March issue? If you worked out the plant's next bloom then you may find a Hungarian Ring Puzzle, destined to cause you further sleepless nights, on its way to you. If not, this is the way to work out the plant's next blossom. Each petal has \"neighbours\" with which it shares an edge line in our drawing. For any petal, if an even number of neighbours also have its own colour then it keeps that colour in the next generation (yes, O is even!). If an odd number of neighbours have its colour then it changes in the next generation in the sequence Blue to Red to White to Blue... TION COMPETITION COMPETITION CO "

"Artificial Intelligence research is closely linked to chess programming in trying to help computers think like we do. Researchers at Edinburgh University have subjected the King and Rook against King and Knight ending to detailed analysis to try and come up with a database giving the result and best move in every legal position. Grandmasters usually believe the ending to be a draw but it is so complicated to play that in practice this is seldom the case. lost in two ply with Black to move. Working backwards a further step shows that figure 5 (with White to move) is a win for White in three ply, since White can choose to play R-ONZ giving figure 3. Continuing in this way (with a few embellishments) eventually produced the desired list of all won positions, together with the depth of the longest winning variation and the best move for the side to move. What makes the algorithm almost unworkable in practice is the huge number of possible positions even with only four pieces on the board Fortunately, the number can be greatly reduced making use of symmetry. For example, figure 6 is the same as figure 5 symmetrically, if the latter is imagined reflected about a vertical line between the two middle files of the board. Working at Bell Laboratories, Ken Thompson (the inventor of BELLE) has produced a database giving the necessary information for the 651,492 of these positions which are wins with White to move. Thompson has also produced a table showing the number of won positions for White (to move) where it takes 1, 2, 3 ... moves to give checkmate (or safely take the Knight. There are 378,518 essentially different mates in one, allowing for symmetry, 95,450 mates in two and so on down to the deepest wins of all: two positions where White moves in 27 moves (53 ply). For the record, these two positions are: a) WK on QR6, WR on KR3, BK on QBL, BN on QN5, and b) WK on 08, WR on KR8, BK on QNI, BN on KN4. By using Thompson's database, it is .bcdefgh abcdefgh King and Rook versus King and Knight endings (KRKN) would seem to be impossible task for the programmer trying to give his computer the best option every time. At first sight, generating such a database is a hopeless task. Assuming that each player has an average of 10 moves in every position, there would be over 10 to the power 50 different variations to consider (up to the end of the game) before deciding on the best move in some positions. However, the amount of computation involved can be hugely reduced by a well-established trick. This involves generating all the positions which are won for White (the side with the Rook) by working backwards from terminal wins checkmates. All positions not generated by this process are drawn, except for a few positions where the Knight gives checkmate for Black! As an example, figure 1 shows Black to move, checkmated or, in the jargon, lost at depth zero. Incidentally, it is helpful fiction to consider positions where White has just taken Black's Knight without leaving the Rook en prise or giving stalemate as \"checkmates\". Any position from which White to move can legally play figure 1 must be a win in one move (i.e. at depth one). Figure 2 is such a position with White to move, since White can now choose to play R-QR2 mate. Generating all checkmate positions (Black to move) is reasonable straightforward. Retracting every (legal) White move from each of those gives all win at one ply positions (White to move). There are between two and three million of these altogether, including figure 2. Now consider reversing every possible last Black move in figure 2. Supposing Black last played his Knight from KN5 to KN3, then the previous position was figure 3. Checking every legal Black move from this position reveals that each one plays to a lost in one ply position (such as figure 2 or figure 4). Hence, figure 3 can be classified as abcdefgh Hence, figure 6 must also be a win for White in three ply It turns out that it is only necessary to consider positions with the Black King on one of a set of 10 squares, such as QR1, QNI, QB1, Q1, QN2, QB2, Q2, QB3, Q3, Q4. Moreover, there are only 462 legal King configurations with the Black King restricted to this triangle of squares (deleting cases where the two Kings are adjacent or on top of one another). This allows the number of positions it is necessary to consider to be reduced to 462 x 64 x 64 = 1,892,352 with each side to move, many of which are illegal because of the position of the Rook or Knight. All other positions are equivalent to these by symmetry. This is still a large number of course but manageable with a large computer. possible to find the best move in every winnable KRKN position a remarkable achievement, yet profoundly dissatisfying. The problem is solved but in a form which no human could possibly remember or understand. The natural question to ask is whether the content of this huge database could be simplified down to a relatively few rules of play of the kind usually found in textbooks: If it could, the resulting rules would have the merits of high precision (rather than the general advice, such as \"try to separate the King and Knight\" given in books) and guaranteed reliability Recent research has concentrated on synthesising just such rules, in a form which human chess players find is meaningful. I will return to this topic in a future article. BY MAX BRAMER "

English ships are shown on the right of the screen as inverse W, X, Y, and Z. The Spaniards are represented by inverse A, B, C and D. The border around the playing area is marked out by x's which represent rocks and the graphic + represents wrecks. If you hit the border or a wreck then your ship will sink. When a ship is hit by gunfire it gets a damage rating. Any ship sustaining a damage factor of more than seven can only move one space at a time ment of ships can input prompts are disusing key '9'.

"You are a pilot on a life or death mission. Can you bomb a clear pathway through the city of skyscrapers wide enough for your aircraft to land? The silhouette of a skyscraper city is drawn on the screen, and at the top is a plane, which traverses from left to right, its altitude reducing on each traverse. If it hits a skyscraper the game ends. Bombs may be dropped by pressing the space bar. If a bomb hits a building it reduces it in height by one story The plane may be raised one line on the screen five times only, by pressing the 'UP' arrow A variable difficulty level is provided in the speed of the plane, which may be 1-5. At speed 1 (fast) each hit scores five points, and at speed 5 (slow) each hit scores one point, etc. A high-score feature is available, and retains the current highest score whilst the machine is switched on and the game loaded, provided it is not re-RUN.

First, be aware that the Dragon screen is 32 characters wide and 16 high. Print positions start at 0 (top left) and end at 511 (bottom right). Video memory starts at decimal RAM address of 1024.

"8 BY BRIAN JAIKENS RUNS ON A VIC-20 IN 3.5K . LOGGER Illustrations: Terry Rogers Squaaaaaarrrkk! There goes that pesky bird, flying off with my axe agin! Ah tell you, I ain't goin' to stand for it much longer. That feathered varmit keeps on swoopin' down on me and stealing my axe. How can a lumberjack work without his axe? He can't that's the answer! But don't worry I'll get even with that bird if it's the last thing I do... You take the part of this pestered lumberjack and help get his axe back from the feathered fiend. To do this you have to guide your man through a maze of logs and ladders. You climb up the ladders and leap over the logs on your way to catch the bird. The game is similar to that arcade game with the crazy gorilla as you've probably guessed Control keys are: 'D' to climb; 'Z' and 'C' left and right; space bar to jump. The game is split into two parts. The first lists the instructions and makes the characters. The second is the game and needs the 3K expander. Brian the author reckons that the game has enough memory to enable Vic owners with moderate programming skills to work out their own screens of platforms and ladders once they get bored with the existing one. So pick up your axe and head for the trees and keeping an eye out for that pesky bird. 64 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"GRAPHICS By Garry Marshall ESSENTIALS OF VIDEO GAMES To be able to reproduce the move. ments of three-dimensional objects in a realistic fashion is essential to the success of many video games. There are two essential parts to any program for doing this. They are, first, the production of a perspective view of the object and, second, the application of the rules for movement. A solid object with straight edges can be described by giving points on its surface and the ways in which they are to be joined to form the edges of the object. Once an object is described in this way, a perpective view of it can be drawn by applying the perspective transformation to each point that is used in the description and then joining the transformed points The current position can be given in terms of the initial position by any set of equations with this form as long as when T=0 the equations become: XC = X YC = Y ZC = Z The form of a program for producing movement of three-dimensional objects can now be given. If the object itself is described by a number of groups of four items of data, X, Y, Z and I, in which X, Y and Z give the co-ordinates of a point and I indicates whether the point is joined to the previous one by an edge. The indicator, I, takes the value 1 if there is an edge and is 0 if there is not. The form of the program is: Once three-dimensional shapes can be created and put into movement, the ways in which they can be used in video games are almost endless. Imagine a three-dimensional Pacman gobbling up everything around him. In a video game, this is nothing more than a shape that is showing a simple pattern of movements In the same way, three-dimensional Space Invaders can be created that can distort themselves so as to avoid missiles fired at them in ways other than moving bodily in one direction or another. There is no reason why the shapes that are created should be confined to artificial ones such as those of a Pacman or a Space Invader. Given the high resolutions that are available with most microcomputers, there is no reason why realistic threedimensional human figures, for example, should not be created and made to move. These could be superior to the figures that are seen in basketball and football video games at present. A good deal of data is needed for the creation of such an image. However, once the data is assembled and stored the bulk of the work is done. The data can be placed in data statements, but it is much simpler to share it between other programs if it is stored in a file. When it red in this wany number of progral to create and manipulate the sa us spreading the work needed initially to create the file. Fig 1: Here a cube is distorted using the rules given. 10 FOR T=0 TO 20 FOR K=1 TON 30 READ X,Y,Z,I 40 XC=X + T*Y 50 YC=Y 60 ZC-Z 70 XT=XC/(1 + ZC/D) 80 YT=YC/(1 + ZC/D) 90 IF I=1 THEN DRAW XT,YT 100 IF I 0 THEN MOVE XT,YT 110 NEXT K 120 RESTORE 130 NEXT T Fig 2: The program in the same way as the actual points are joined. The rules for the movement of the points on the object can be expressed by giving the position of the point at any time, T, in terms of its initial position at T=0. If the co-ordinates of the initial position are denoted by (X, Y, Z and those of the current position by (XC, YC, ZC) then the rules for movement can be written, for example, as: XC = X + T*Y YC = Y ZC = Z 72 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES For each group of data items: Read X, Y, Z and I Apply movement rules to give XC, YC, ZC Find transformed point corresponding to (XC, YC,ZC) If I=1 then draw a line to this point If I=0 then move to this point A program based on this scheme which deals with an object described by N groups of data which is viewed from a distance D is shown in Fig 2. The results that can be produced with this program when N and D are initialised and data are added are illustrated in Fig 1.

"MACHINE CODE YET MORE INSTRUCTIONS We have already looked at conditional jump instructions, and now we turn to another set of instructions, which are often used in conjunction with these called comparison instructions. These comparison instructions subtract an operand from a register specified in the instruction. Only the flags are affected, the sign, zero, carry and overflow flags being changed according to the result of the subtraction. On the 280 the comparison instructions all work with the accumulator. The opcode mnemonic is CP, and the CMPB, CMPD, CMPS, CMPU, CMPX, CMPY, for compare with A, B, D, S, U, X Y registers. The operand must be of the same length as the register specified in the mnemonic, so CMPA and CMPB take an 8-bit operand and the others take a 16-bit operand. These compare instructions are available in immediate, extended, and other addressing modes. For example, we may have: CMPA data: Compare A with the 8-bit data provided in the instruction CMPX data: Compare X with the 16-bit data provided in the instruction CMPB address: Compare B with 8-bit contents of address CMPS address: Compare S with 16-bit contents of address and address+1 11110101 and the twos complement is 11110110. If you perform the same process starting with 11110110 you will get 00001010 and if you add 00001010 and 11110110 you will get 00000000 (and a carry of 1), so it does make sense to regard the twos complement of a number as its negative. The easiest way to perform a subtraction in binary (for people, if not for microprocessors) is to add the twos complement of the number to be subtracted. For example, to calculate 0000 100000000111 (decimal 8 7) we first calculate the twos complement of 00000111, which is 11111001, and then calculate 0000 1000+ 11111001, which gives 00000001 (and a carry of 1). The 6502 actually uses this method of subtraction internally, so the program fragments SEC LDA 8 SBC 7 and LDA 8 CMP 7 would leave l in the carry flag. sal Z addressing modes we can use with this mnemonic include: CP data: Compare the accumulator with the 8-bit data provided in the instruction. CP register: Compare the accumulator with one of the registers A, B, C, D, E, H, TRUE AND FALSE FLAGS L. CP (HL): Compare the accumulator with the contents of the memory location whose address is in the register pair HL. The 6502 and 6809 allow comparison with other registers as well as with the accumulator. On the 6502 we have the mnemonics CMP for compare with accumulator, CPX for compare with X register, and CPY for compare with Y register. The addressing modes we can use with these mnemonics include: CMP data: Compare the accumulator with the 8 bit data provided in the instruction. CMP address: Compare the accumulator with the 8-bit contents of the 16-bit or 8-bit Zero Page address. Similarly we have CPX data, CPX address, CPY data, and CPY address, The 6809 has the mnemonics CMPA The effect of a comparison instruction on the zero flag is quite straightforward: the zero flag will become 1 (meaning true) if the numbers being compared are the same, and 0 (meaning false) if the numbers are different. The effect on the other flags is more complicated, and to understand what happens we have to look at the details of twos complement arithmetic. You will remember that the 280, 6502 and 6809 treat binary numbers with a l in the leftmost position (bit 7 of an 8-bit number or bit 15 of a 16-bit number, starting the count from bit 0 on the right) as being negative. We can negate a number by first calculating the ones complement (by changing Os to ls and ls to Os) and then adding I to get the twos complement. For example, if we start with the binary number 00001010 (equal to decimal 10) the ones complement is PERFORMING SUBTRACTION The 280 and 6809, however, perform direct subtraction with borrow, giving a carry which is the opposite of the carry resulting from the twos complement and addition method. Thus the fragments 280 LD A,8 SUB 7 and LD A,8 CP 7 6809 LDA 8 SUBA 7 and LDA 8 CMPA 7 would leave 0 in the carry flag. Subtraction of binary numbers using borrows (corresponding to the way we perform subtraction of decimal numbers) is complicated because of the difficulty of keeping track of the borrows, which may extend over several places. It is much easier to perform a twos complement and addition, and if you are using a 280 or 6809 remember to complement the resulting carry. After an addition, subtraction, or comparison instruction, the sign flag will be the same as the leftmost bit of the result (bit 7 in an 8-bit operation, bit BY TED BALL 74 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"MACHINE CODE 15 in a 16 bit operation), O meaning positive and I meaning negative. Thus, in the preceding example (8-7) the sign flag would become 0, while 7-8 would leave 1 in the sign flag. Our microprocessors use a fixed number of bits in their calculations, but the results may require more bits than are available. Similarly, a 16-bit operation will give an overflow of 1 if the result is more than +22767 or less than -32768, and an overflow of 0 otherwise. The value of the overflow flag can be calculated from the carries from bits 6 and 7 in an 8-bit operation, or bits 14 and 15 in a 16-bit operation. The overflow will be 1 if the two carries are different and 0 if the two carries are the same. We can now return to the use of the comparison and conditional jump instructions. In Basic the simplest conditional jumps have the form IF condition THEN GOTO line number, where condition is one of the relations M=N, M<>N, M<N, M>N, M<=N, M>=N. CARRYING THE FLAG The carry flag is used to record the carry from the leftmost bit, and this is all we need in unsigned binary arithmetic (where we regard the 8-bits as representing numbers from 0 to 255 decimal). However, in signed binary arithmetic the sign and carry flags are not enough to tell us whether or not the result has the correct sign. Consider the calculation of decimal 70+80 in signed binary: 70 01000110 + 80 +01010000 TRANSLATING LANGUAGE SIMPLE TESTS FOR RELATIONS Now that we know how to work out what the flags will be for the various cases = = =, we can translate these IF ... THEN ... statements into assembly language (but needing several lines to replace the single line of Basic) There is no difficulty in testing for = and : 150 (0)10010110 = -106 decimal Adding two positive numbers has given a negative answer, because the carry from bit 6 has gone into the sign bit. We get a similar result from (-70)+ (-80) -70 10111010 +-80 +10110000 280 : Code to handle case LD AM CP N JR Z,SAME Code to handle<>case SAME ... : Code to handle = case -150 (1)01101010 = +106 decimal In this case adding two negative numbers have given a positive answer. The same kind of thing can happen with subtraction, for example 70-80 (should be 150), and 80-(-70) (should be +150) -70 10111010 +twos complement of 80 +10110000 LD A.M CP JR NZ, DIFF The 6809 has an extensive set of conditional branch instructions, allowing us to make simple tests for all of the relations =,<>, < >,< ,>= We have BEQ for =, BNE for <>, BLO or BCS for unsigned <, BLT for signed<, BHI for unsigned >, BGT for signed>, BLS for unsigned <=, BLE for signed <=, BHS or BCC for unsigned >=, BGE for signed >=. With the more restricted conditional branches or jumps on the 6502 and 280 some relations are difficult to test, but they can all be worked out if you understand the principles of binary arithmetic. For example, consider the problem of testing for signed<. If M N we will get M N O (sign flag 1) when there is no overflow (overflow flag 0), and M-N>O (sign flag 0) when there is overflow (overflow flag 1). For this test we will therefore need to do something like: ; Code to handle = case DIFF Code to handle<>case 6502 (1101101010 =+106 decimal LDA M  N BEQ SAME ...: Code to handle <>case 80 01010000 +twos complement of 70 01000110 SAME... : Code to handle = case (0)10010110 = -106 decimal LDAM  N BNE DIFF 6502 : Code to handle = case LDAM  N BVC L1 BPL LESS DIFF Code to handle case NOTLESS 6809 LDA M CMPAN BEQ SAME BPL NOTLESS LESS Code to handle<>case 280 THE WRONG INDICATIONS The overflow flag is used to indicate when the result of a signed binary calculation has the wrong sign because 8 or 16-bits is not enough to record the correct signed binary answer.

"cutsu LOGIC CHIPS, PHASE CLOCKS One of the main problems associated with some of the newer microprocessors is that they seldom have a phase 2 clock. This is really of no problem to kit builders as it is a simple inversion of phase 1. It is quite possible that you will have in your system, either a line which is phase 2 or a spare gate on a logic chip. It would be easy to suppose that this was a hex inverter but I will not assume that here. In figure 1 I have indicated the way in which two popular logic chips can be used as an inverter. If you are unfortunate enough not to have a spare gate on any of your logic chips I would recommend using a two-input nand gate, say a 7400 or similar, as this is one of the most useful chips available. SMALL SYSTEMS For those with small systems it will come as a surprise that it will be easier for you to install this timer. Of course, the chip must be accessed using the address lines. If you already have 64k bytes of memory installed the question becomes, where do you put the timer? There is no simple answer to this. The easiest way of course is to remove a lk-byte of memory somewhere. That used to be an easy job, but since the coming of 16k-by-1 and 64k-by-1 chips this is not so. I would therefore risk dual addressing of memory and timer at the same time. The problem comes, of course, when you come to read information from the timer. Fortunately, these days systems are built with several user ports available. Some of these will already be used by PIA's, ACIA's and other system-defined I/O's. (If you do not already use the PIA, if you have one, try the onboard clock facility.) There is no real problem in connecting up the address lines. Find out in hex notation where the port lies, or better in binary, and tie CSI to this line. CSO will be the line below. For example, say the port is at 8010 hex, or 1 followed by 15 zeros in binary. Therefore you would put CS1 to line 15 and CSO to line 14. This ties in with what I said last month, that to address the chip CSO must be at zero and CS1 must be at one. The register select lines could then go on any of the first ten address lines. If, for example they were put on lines 0-2 the addresses in hex would be from 8010 to 8017 or in decimal 32,784 to 32,791. Now, with the data, address and clock lines connected you are almost ready to start timing. It is not necessary at this point to connect either the IRQ or reset line. The only necessary one left is the read/write line, again, this interfaces directly with the microprocessor. Once this is done you must decide on the frequency of your timer clocks. The most convenient method of deriving a lower frequency that I have found is to use a divider chip. The CMOS 4040 is quite useful, allowing up to 12 different frequencies to be selected. Unfortunately, this is a binary counter and therefore divides in powers of 2 Hence, for a IMHz input you can get outputs of 500kHz, 250kHz, 125kHz, 62.5kHz, 32.15kHz, etc. There are a large number of decimal dividers on the market which are as handy as they usually divide by multiples or powers of ten. Unfortunately, these are not yet as common as the 7400 or 4000 series chips. You are now ready to load into the timer and to set it in motion, (if such a word can be applied to time). You will, by now, have access to eight internal registers. I will refer to them as RO-R7. Each timer remember there are three — has its own control register, data latch, and buffer register. The first, the control register lets you decide in which mode that particular timer is in. Unfortunately there is not enough room here to explain all the modes suffice to say that there is a lot of supplied information with the chip when you buy it. LOTS OF EIGHT To load 16-bits into the counter two lots of eight must be entered separately. For example, to load into timer 1 write the 8 most significant bits into R2 and then the least significant bits to R3. This second instruction puts both the MSB and the LSB into the 16-bit counter at the same time. Depending on the state of the control register the timer will either initialise or await an external trigger. It is most important that the control registers are loaded with the correct bytes or else the timers will not work. Now, with this timer quite a few more programs are possible than you might have imagined. Not only can it be programmed as a tone burst generator for fault finding on such things as cassette recorders, but also can be used as a tone generator for synthesising music. As there are three timer many more contrived sounds may be produced. The module has been designed to drive two TTL loads so you may not even need to amplify the output for playing through a normal pair of headphones.

Symbol Output A LITTLE ON DIGITAL LOGIC Some of you may have come across truth tables for logic gates or you may have played about with some small chips at some time or another. In the figure below I have shown a few of the symbols which are used to represent the gates have mentioned. There is not enough room here to cover the whole subject of digital logic so I will not try. All that I will show is a small section relevant to the project. Above I have mentioned an inverter, a nand gate and a ripple counter, the 4040. The 4040 is too complex to mention here. The other two I will describe to you. The Inverter or NOT Gate. This is a one input, one output gate, of which a number are built into a single chip. It takes a logic level and inverts it. If a logic one appears on the input logic zero appears at the output and vice versa. This can be shown in the form of a truth table. The AND Gate. To describe a NAND gate we must first consider the AND gate. The simplest AND gate has two inputs but only one output. As you can see, for the output to be a one both inputs must be at logic one. Any other condition and the output is a logic zero. The NAND Gate Imagine an AND gate followed immediately by an inverter. This is the NAND gate. Whatever appears at the output of the AND gate is inverted as is shown in the diagram How to use a NAND gate as an inverter. By taking one input of the NAND gate to the 5 volt rail so as to make it a logic one you will see that the output follows that of the NOT gate. We therefore have a NOT gate from a NAND gate, and this is why the NAND gate is so useful. The OR Gate. This is a logic gate in the same form as the AND. It usually comes in a chip package along with others of its kind. In this instance the only case when a zero is present at the output is when both the inputs are zero. If one OR the other input is a one then the output is a one, as shown in the truth table. The NOR Gate. This is an OR gate followed by an inverter or NOT gate. Whatever is on the output of the OR gate is immediately inverted for the output of the NOR gate. This is again shown in the tables. How to use a NOR gate as an inverter. Looking at the truth table for a NOR gate we can see that by taking one of the inputs to logic zero the output will be an inversion of the other input. This is also a handy gate to have around and perhaps just as good as the NAND. Input AB 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 OR gate. Symbol Output Input AB 0 0 0 1 10 1 1 NOR gate.

"GDVENTUR dub A SC CINDERELLA AND THE BEANSTALK Every now and again in an Adventure something dramatic must happen or it wouldn't be an Adventure! This may be the appearance of a cryptic clue to heighten the excitement and add to the atmosphere, or the transformation in some way of an object or location. A verb routine cannot usually achieve this end, as some of these events will be unique. For example, the transformation of mice and pumpkin into Cinderella's coach and horses will be carried out magically by the fairy godmother as soon as all necessary conditions have been met This involves the mice, pumpkin, godmother and player all being in Cinderella's house at the same time. Similarly, if there is a secret exit from the drawing room of a house via a moving bookcase, you might wish to draw attention to it occasionally by giving the clue \"There's a draught coming from under the bookcase\". With a clue like that, you can make the mechanism for opening the exit quite complex, as the player will be fairly certain it is worth persevering. Recapping on our method of screen display, we settled for setting variable Q1$ for the computer's reply to the move, return to the start of the main game loop (Block 3 we called it) at line 100. This block checks for special conditions before the screen is cleared and redisplayed. It is these special conditions we have now got to insert. Let's tackle the clue first. We are at the top of the beanstalk we grew so painstakingly a few months ago, and wish to display \"FEE-FI-FO-FUM\" whilst in this location. The \"GO\" or moving verb routine cannot be used, since then the message would only appear on entry to the location. If we spend some time there it will not re-appear. Letting the top of beanstalk be location five (i.e. LN%=5 when there) then we can insert line 110 110 IF LN%=5 THEN LET 02$=\"FEEFI-FO-FUM\" Now when the computer has worked out the response to the latest command, it will automatically set 02$ to the reI sat with eager anticipation as Philosopher's Quest loaded into the BBC Model B micro in front of me. The Acornsoft logo appeared across the screen in four colours, broken by the title of the game, whilst the blocks loaded before my eyes in hex. When the game started I was treated to silent scrolling text in black and white. OK, so an Adventure doesn't require colour or sound, but it seemed a shame not to take some advantage of the Beeb's facilities -the machine wasn't being used to the full. Having got that off my chest, what of the Adventure itself? It starts off in a shop that has peculiar qualities. Nothing has to be paid for, but you can only leave with two items. If the four objects lying around, keys, in my experience, were a must. So that left a choice between an aqualung, steel rod, and cup of tea that couldn't be drunk (said so in the rules). I opted for the rod, and set off, only to find myself in pitch darkness. Now newcomers to Adventures might be thrown off balance by having had no chance to acquire a lamp. Not so those of us who have traversed the ancient pyramids, been stuck in quicksand bogs, mauled by bears, and gone insane trying to escape from the Asylum. \"XXXX XXXX\", I boldly typed, and I was duly rewarded! Thereafter proceeded to explore the labyrinth, which has many puzzles to solve. Unfortunately, in attempting to solve them I was frequently thwarted by being turned into a lettuce, ceasing to exist, and various other nasty things. However, restarting was not too difficult since it was only necessary to reload the database part of the program a task taking about a minute. Thus, eventually I got an Albatross (no wafers!), some ripe cheese, and many quired message if the current location is set at five. The display lines will now look like this: 190 PRINT \"YOU TOLD ME TO\": R1$: IF LENO1$)>0 THEN PRINT Q1$ : IF LEN(Q2$)>0 THEN PRINT Q2$ Thus 02$ will only get printed if set. Remember that these variables must be nulled (ie LET Q1$=\"\") after display. times wore out the seat of my trousers on the slides, I've heard of but not come across the automatic solicitor, nor recovered from ceasing to exist. I am told it is possible to do this, and the key is philosophical Those people I know who are into the game just give me a distant smile when I ask how near they are to completing it. Presumably their minds are miles away. philosophising! Good points cunning and complex plot. Bad point-poor response time, up to about five seconds when the machine does any serious thinking. Scott Adams' first adventure was my introduction to Adventure gaming, and although it fired my imagination, little did I realise it was going to make Adventure a major part of my life! The original version was written in Basic for the TRS-80 and Pet, and later translated into machine code, available for the TRS-80, Apple and Sorceror. Like all Scott's Adventures, it has recently been released for the Vic-20 and Atari computers. This may explain why! am currently receiving a flurry of pleading letters from readers who are desperately stuck a whole new generation of Adventurers! It is probably the original adventure as far as micros go. I regard it as a classic, and still relive the thrill I first experienced whenever I bring it up on the screen. The major problem in this game seems to be how to get past the thin bear. If you've got that far you're capable of completing the journey! What do bears to to people? OK reverse roles, and then (disappointingly) rephrase it! To those currently playing Adventureland don't give up. It IS soluble. If you are struggling, get together with others in the same position Adventures are fun when played in company. A further refinement is possible to cause the message to occur at random, keeping the player guessing whether or not the giant is about to attack, rather than risking him deciding that the message is automatic. 110 IF LN%=5 AND RND(3)=2 THEN LET Q2$=\"FEE-FI-FO-FUM\" This will bring the message up about one turn in three. Next we will see how to carry out transformations that take the game into a new phase. BY KEITH CAMPBELL COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 83 "


"WARPATH Bigscreen will help you to map out a wargame which goes beyond the borders of your screen. Part four of Ron Potkin's wild west game Direction 1 2 Odd Row -24 24 Even Row -23 25 3 48 48 4 5 6 23 25 48 24 -24 48 Take another look at IBOARD and BIGSCREEN. Hex are awkward to deal with and you can see the problem from the following extracts from the arrays. This diagram shows two small parts of BIGSCREEN showing a piece on an odd row X264X and a piece on an even row X396. The six surrounding hex are shown in brackets. BIGSCREEN ODD (8) (132) (140) x264x (388) (520) 528 16 272 EVEN URING the past three articles, I have described a number of important arrays: BIGSCREEN, IBOARD and PTABLE. After studying last month's explanation, I think that you will now understand the basic module and be able to see how the arrays fit together. They are very large, totalling almost 6000 bytes which is a big slice out of a 16K memory. The largest of these is BIGSCREEN which requires 4000 and although this might appear wasteful, it provides considerable flexibility and is easy to operate. It enables me to draw any map feature and save it permanently in memory so that, during the course of the game, the program is able to recall any portion of the map and display it in the WINDOW. This method is only viable with low resolution graphics; high resolution would require a BIGSCREEN of not 4000 but 20000 or more! In this case, the alternative is to write a machine language routine which reads the contents of IBOARD, selects the appropriate feature from a character set and prints it on the screen. I am going to concentrate on a single routine. The Basic listing is quite short but is an integral part. It is clear from the rules that the program must check a hex and its neighbours at every move. The hex that a player wishes to move to must be checked first. This can be done in Basic, but checking the six surrounding hex is slow and this is carried out in machine code. This routine is called SEARCH and is held in X$(4). . *396x (272) (520) (264) X396x 512 (528) 644 (652) Now compare these with the equivalent positions on IBOARD: ODD EVEN 0 (1) 2 24 (25) 26 (24) (25) 26 48 (49) (50) 48 x49x 50 72x73x 74 (72) (73) 74 96 (97) (98) 96 (97) 98 120 (121) 122 Let's assume the man on x49x is to be moved in direction 1. What hex number do I test? It must be 25 which is 24 less than 49, but what if the man is on x73x? Then direction I gives 50 which is 23 less. You can see that the offsets for the two are different and depend on whether the row is even or odd i.e.: Now perhaps you will forgive me for sneaking in Line 1180! This table is in a 2 by 6 array (variable RF) and also in memory starting at RW (location 32606). RF is used in Line 500 when testing whether the new hex is empty. Take a look at this line. Can you see how NB, the new hex position is calculated? The routine also returns NX, the contents of the hex and V2, its location in memory. RW is used by SEARCH. This is the same thing, but we do it six times. We first POKE 6 into S9 and BL is passed to the USR routine. The route will not return until it finds a non-vacant hex, when it returns the contents. These are checked and then, if necessary, X$(4) is recalled. When it has completed the search, it returns with S9 equal to 255. The interesting feature is the use of S9. The routine is really equivalent to FOR S96 to 1 STEP-1, but I cannot put this into the USR routine because each time it was entered S9 would be set equal to 6. The answer is to set 59 to 6 in Basic and let the machine code decrement it. This is in the listing below which is annotated so that with the above explanation, I think you will find it understandable. The Basic listing this month includes the lines necessary to load the machine code for X$(4). Once this is done, we will be able to start on the MOVE routine. Up to now, everything I have described can be used in any wargame even hexagonal chess but from now on we will concentrate on the details of Warpath and get the game underway. 84 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"The pieces move in the following manner:, Each piece will flicker in turn with the number of moves available. To move a piece, type a number from 1 to 6. You can remember the directions by visualising a six-hour clock. To move northeast Press 1 To move southeast Press 2 To move south Press 3 and so on. You may continue moving in this manner until all moves are expended, but if you move next to an opponent, the piece (unless it is a Tomahawk) will flicker with \"xXx\" and you must stop. Neither player may enter a hex containing another piece, a boulder or any wall of the garrison.

Then there was President Carter's abortive attempt to rescue the hostages with a commando style raid with choppers flying in low across the desert. Some of the features of that attempted rescue have been incorporated in this latest game for the Vic 20, called Choplifter. Choplifter is already a best selling game in the U.S., where versions for the Apple and Atari have been on sale for several months. It is not only the game's obvious associations with the hostage affair that have caused the game to be such a big hit in the U.S. It is by any standards a most playable game. You pilot a helicopter on a mission to desert and they will shoot down the hostages rather than let you get away with them. There are also enemy jet fighters and deadly satellites which home in on you at great speed. The chopper is controlled with the joystick and can be made to bank, dive, hover, and scroll backwards and forwards. You can bomb as well as shoot. The bombs can be directed to a certain extent by making the chopper bank in the direction you want the bombs to fall. By practising you can catch out those annoying tanks by guiding a bomb onto them instead of being a flying \"sitting duck\"!

When you have picked up your maximum load of sixteen men, or as many as you can get away with, fly them back to the U.S. base and set off on another rescue mission. But there are obstacles to your rescue attempt. Tanks appear to blast your helicopter once it lands. The best tactic is to take off and bomb the tank before returning for the frantic hostages. Some of the hostages are imprisoned in camps so you will have to bomb these open in order to get at them. We found an easier way to free the imprisoned hostages is to land the chopper on top of the prison and then take off again. 9 The happy hostages soon come hopping out! Your task is again made more difficult by those enemy tanks which are patrolling the The movement of the rotor-blades has also been well done with convincing sound effects. And when you get blasted by a tank or passing jet there's a horrible metallic crashing sound. Four readouts keep a check on the number of hostages on board, the number safely brought back to base, and the number killed. The high score is also recorded. As might be expected the graphics on this version are not quite up to the standard of the Apple and Atari versions though they are none the less impressive, and the game is every bit as playable as the other versions. Very addictive and definitely one of the best games now on sale for the Vic.

Bats fly towards you flapping their wings, toads that bounce up and down as they approach, and sinister looking rats which charge at you, snouts to the ground and wagging their tails. There are also ugly black spiders that swing along the roof of the tunnel spinning their webs as they approach. 48K Spectrum owners have an extra treat at the very end of the tunnel, if they manage to get that far. A silver underground train hurtles out of the dark recesses. The underground train is a masterpiece of programming. You can see the lights twinkling as it approaches. When it becomes larger you can even see the passengers in their seats and hear the rush of wind as the train passes. My chief criticism of 3D Tunnel is that the games playability does not measure up to the high standards set with the graphics. Although the sensation of depth is adequately created with an infinite number of concentric squares it is too difficult to manoeuvre. Try as I might I could not get the bats in my sights. This is slightly compensated by the large choice of game options which enables you to jump to the next sequence but even after two hours of play I could TRS80 — VIDEO GENIE SOFTWARE LIBRARY 25 Super programmes machine code arcade games, simulations, competitive games, adventures dungeons & dragons, puzzles and ball games, blusa few education and Business programmes including Breakout Star Wars, Amazing 3D Mares Gambling Machine Corridors of Doom & Trap It Al 25 on one C48 cassette, sent by return post for only .95 inclusive, or send sa e for full details SPARTAN SOFTWARE (Dept.

Running on the 48K model only, the graphics are truly impressive. As with arcade Scramble it is not really your score that is of the utmost importance but how far you can get into the Scramble system. Penetrator challenges you to fly through four levels of progressive difficulty The first of these is gently undulating terrain with only the ground-to-air missiles to worry about. Soon after this you fly into a tunnel and you will have to move up and down with great precision. The most difficult stage of the game is the maze with its sharp vertical drops and walls that appear suddenly in front of you. Further still, and you come across bouncing missiles which fall down from the ceiling as if suspended on springs. Your ship has five flight controls. Up. down, thrust, forward and brakes which PENETRATOR have the effect of slowing down the scrolling terrain to enable you to drop down or rise up to avoid flying into an obstacle. Playability of Penetrator is greatly improved by a comprehensive list of game options. One or two players can play and you can choose the type of landscape you wish to negotiate with the terrain editor\". The game stores your current high score and also enables the five top scores of the session to be entered. Despite this, my overall impression was of a most enjoyable and addictive game. Definitely in the top five Spectrum games. Penetrator is produced by Melbourne House software and is available from W. H. Smith at .95. Getting started Value Playability VIC 20!!

Atari do and they've released a cartridge for the 400 and 800 full of them! This is a most impressive copy of the arcade original. I could see no major differences between the computer game and the arcade version. The Galaxians attack in random forma tion, sometimes peeling off from the uniform columns one by one, or attacking in waves of three. As in the arcade game the yellow commander ships scream in from behind the blue drone ships and are the key to high scores. If you can pick these off you can score up to eight hundred bonus points. To repel the Galaxians you have only three ships but you can earn a bonus ship by notching up 5,000 points. From then on you must fire accurately and quickly The game gets progressively difficult. The more sheets of Galaxians you blast out of the skies the quicker and heavier their firepower. Screen instructions report on your current score, the high score, skill level, and a red flag system records the number of screens wiped clean. Galaxians is a tried and successfully tested arcade game. I could not fight off the tiniest twinge of boredom, however, as I blasted the umpteenth alien. Surely a company like Atari who were big enough to market Pacman when everyone else was blasting aliens doesn't need to revert back to blasting aliens in 1983? hope not anyway. I'm getting slightly tired of being a space ace! Still, a good home conversion of a classic arcade game and, if you can afford it, a nice one to have in the collection.

An impressive simulation of movement is created as the aliens scroll past your stationary ship, which is armed with impressive flight controls. Long and short range scanners tell you the positions in the galaxy of the various aliens, You also have shields to protect you from alien torpedoes. Your mission is to protect a planet from invading enemy spaceships. When your mission is completed the Starship Commanders will give you their comments on how they think you have performed and your worthiness for the next mission. These comments are not always very complimentary. The best I managed was \"satisfactory\" and on more than one occasion the Commanders told me they were \"furious\", \"displeased\", and \"disappointed\". A careful eye on your energy banks is the key to promotion in the Starfleet as this will ensure a successful mission. Each starship has four energy banks which are constantly recharging. You can score points by ramming the aliens but they are worth more if you shoot them. As you work your way up through the ships and missions the challenges get more difficult as the aliens become faster and more accurate with their torpedoes. The game can be played using the keyboard or joysticks and is available from Acornsoft of Cambridge at .95 for the BBC Model B. Getting started  Value  Playability 90 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "

"BACK ISSUES THE EVOLUTION OF COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES (PART 1) Most computer historians agree that the first known remains of Computer & Video Games date from November 1981. It was then that this magazine first emerged (a little unsteadily) into the primeval twilight of the early days of Sinclair Man. Then huge computer dinosaurs roamed the Earth, thrusting keen young programmers into their wall-to-wall maws and the magazine looked a little out-of-place surviving on a diet of strange new features and listing material washed up from across the Atlantic. Naturalists are only now beginning to draw conclusions about the close association between the Computer & Video Games story and a little yellow gobbling creature's own evolutionary niche... Let us take a closer look at some of the noteworthy steps in the evolution of both:November 1981 The stripling emerges into twilight with Tarot on the Tandy, Musical Hangman on the Sharp MZ-80K, Trench on the Atari, Nibblers on the Pet and Super Nim on the Apple. Keith Campbell kicked off his popular Adventure series, Garry Marshall kicked off graphics with a space invader. There were Pacman arcade tips and Max Bramer looked at the first chess machine, Von Kempelen's Turk. December 1981 Growing up fast with Potshot on the Vic-20, Breakout on the Atom, 'Round the Horn' on the Tandy, Mini Golf on the Atari and Pet owners could tackle Rubik's Cube with more confidence. Keith Mott went trouble-shooting on the ZX81 in Kit Korner and Screaming Foul-up fell in love with Terry Wogan. January 1982 A new year begins with Ted Ball on the trail of the Bugs in his Practical Programming column. Speed Race for the Texas, Treasure Hunt was a popular Apple adventure much converted by owners of other machines, three 1K wonders for the ZX81 and Changing Hearts for Atari owners. We also saw a seamier side to gaming with a feature on Softporn Adventure! February 1982 Science Fiction author David Langford brought a new look to space games with Space Blockade. Dr Livingstone set up a quest for Sharp owners and Grand Prix gave Tandy owners a racetrack to try out. David Annal POKEd some sounds out of the quieter micros and Arcade Action announced two Pacman lookalikes. March 1982 Robin Bradbeer reported from Las Vegas on a country going video crazy how right he was. ZX81 owners got to grips with Reversi (Othello), there was Startrek III.4 for the Tandy and Octodraw had the Atari moving in eight directions at once. April 1982 Spring came with Tim Metcalfe's feature on pinball, a revitalised sector of the arcades fighting back against Space Invaders. Engineer helped Atari owners rebuild the Golden Gate Bridge, Poker for the ZX81 and Ron Potkin's classic Tandy wargame Kriegspiel. Plus Pacman hit the home Video Screens at last. May 1982 Computer Moderated Games were investigated by Terry Pratt (the first thoughts on Seventh Empire were voiced about here). Minotaur took the Vic-20 down into a maze and tried to lose it, Pacman arrived in a C&VG listing on a Pet, Minopoly for up to five Sharp businessmen, Meteorstorm took Apple owners by surprise and Earthport II won Tandy fans. June 1982 The World Cup was upon us and we reIt also included issue 1 of our BBC Micro publication, Owl. July 1982 Do the arcades have anything to offer the fairer sex? America was wooing women with Ms Pacman and we featured this first lady of the arcades in July. Imhotep took the Apple owners back to ancient Egypt, Moon Shuttle sent the Vic into space and Z-Xtra gave 16 pages over to Sinclair fans August 1982 Haunted House gave Atoms a shudder, Space Hopper made Tandy's jump to it and Rocks made Vic owners roll over and beg for more. Imagic launched a range of cartridges for the Atari VCS. Hardcore was given over to a game-player's guide to the Atari and Sue Garden gave us all a giggle with a computer widow's tale. September 1982 Tron: out of the arcades came Walt Disney's graphically stirring film about being trapped in a computer game. We featured it first. Pacman appeared on the Vic-20, there was Star Wars on the Atom and Colditz Adventure on the Tandy. Issue two of Owl gave BBC owners Speed Trial and X marks the Spot. October 1982 C&VG saw out its first 12 issues with Space Watch on the Spectrum, asking you to befriend the aliens before it's too late! Sharp Defender, Galaxian Colony II on the Apple and the controversial Wild Strawberries on the Atari added to the action. And Pacman appeared in the Bugs cartoon! ten for the Sharp but without a PEEK or POKE and since converted to many a micro. Vic-20 owners were set afloat on a river torrent in Speedboat, there was Trolls Gold on the Apple and Dog Star Adventure on the Tandy.

"ALL THE FUN OF THE AIR How do you fancy getting away from it all with a trip in our hot air balloon? Sounds tempting doesn't it. But it takes skill and fast reactions to avoid all the hazards. Are you up to it? Could you manoeuvre the balloon over the tree tops and mountain peaks, while still keeping an eye on your ballast and your fuel because when it starts to run low you'll have to descend and not being distracted by people throwing stones at you land carefully on the fuel pods. You'll be lucky to rise back up again. But look out!! Watch that kite doesn't become entangled with you and don't worry about that noise its only the aeroplanes that come diving and swooping at you. You'll need to rise higher to avoid the turbulance from the windmill blades but as you do you're likely to run into storm clouds and bolts of lightening. Also the higher you climb in the W stratosphere the more difficult the balloon becomes to handle. By now you'll start to panic! and wonder how on earth you're going to make it, but then again that's all the fun of the air. Post Coupon now to Pulsar Software, 15 Moorfields, Liverpool L2 2BQ.
