"NEWS potential like proper arcade laser disk machines! And the amazing early demo we were shown more than proved the point! Not only will the machine be able to handle music CDs, it'll also do the business with graphics CD packages so it looks like the sky's the limit for all-round action stations! Early indications are that the machine will cost between  and  price when it's officially released. The CD can hold up to 550 megabytes of information, which means you could have Strider, one of the largest Megadrive games, recorded 680 times on one CD. Wow! The first games to appear on the Mega CD will take full advantSPECIAL REPORT age of this extra memory, featuring tons of levels and zillions of graphics.  # MEGADRIVE CD ROM: THE FACTS REVEALED! u ot! Hot! Hot! As the world waits for the imminent Megadrive CD-ROM, here's some hotter-than-hot exclusive news on Sega's amazing bolt-on box of tricks. CVG has been treated to a brief sneaky peak at Sega's wonder machine, and our gobs were well and truly smacked at what it's capable of! For start the CD-ROM features a completely new processor (which runs at 12mhz nearly twice as fast as an Amiga), extra sound chips, and special custom graphics chips which give sprite and background scaling as standard. NON TELVE H 2 16-BIT MEGR-CD 2012 3 These work in conjunction with the Megadrive when both machines are connected together, and the end result is truly astonishing, resulting in utterly jaw-dropping 3D games (like Super Famicom F-Zero and PIlotwings), proper orchestral sound and real-live action Japanese game designers Game Arts are releasing two titles to coincide with the launch of the machine. Both are RPGs, the first, Lunar The Silver Star is a standard wander around and collect the stuff game, while the second, with an untranslatable Japanese title, is a more strategic wargame thingy, with Samurai warriors and feuding clans as a background. Some lucky so-and-sos will probably be able to get their hands on one through grey import in the not-too-distant future, but we guarantee they'll cost the Earth 'cos these machines will be very thin on the ground! More news the very second we get it, but for now take it from us that the Megadrive CD ROM looks set to give the Famicom a very hard time indeed. Start saving that cash you're gonna want this!

"NEWS VIRTUAL ROBOTIC RAMPAGE LORD CORE SYSTEM 51STER LORONG COMPLETE ATTIOSPHERE SRIPLE SEN LEUEL HTTEGEN LEUE Industries, the guys who pioneered the use of virtual reV Vality as a base for arcade machines, are about to unveil what could be the best blaster of all time. The game, called Walker features up to four machines linked together for multi-player antics. You control a massive robot and \"drive\" it around a vast cityscape. Also inhabiting the city are your fellow players and a number of rather vicious alien drones. The object of the game is to destroy all your friends and evade enemy fire. Couldn't be simpler, but the use of the VR system brings a whole new dimension to the shoot em up theme. You simply don the helmet and start playing. Those of you who've tried Virtual Reality will know how confusing and exciting it is and those who haven't should start searching the arcades for a Walker machine. The tension generated by the 3D environment is amazing, and we reckon this game is going to be huge. Another virtual delight is a game called Nightmare, this too is a fast moving shoot em up and it's a cross between Tron and High Noon. Excellent stuff, it looks as if VR is set to take off in a big way! More news on these very pages soon! MORE YANKEE YARDAGE tealing the thunder from Joe Montana 2 is the long awaited sequel to Electronic Arts' John Madden's Football. Imaginatively titled John Madden's Football 2, it's basically a much revamped version of the first game. There are a few major differences, like more teams, more and different plays and enhanced graphics. The viewpoint is the familiar 3D used in the first game, but the whole thing is a lot faster and smoother than the original. When it comes out late this year, JM2 will cost about forty quid. Initial impressions are excellent and it looks well worth that extra tenner. Existing Madden's owners will be foaming at the mouth in anticipation of this game. Watch this space for the full-lowdown on the John Madden-Joe Montana head-to-head! MAS forma entre BH . F NEC'S DARING DUO NEC, the people who brought you the PC Engine, have just launched a sort of sequel. The PC Engine Duo as it's called, is a PC Engine with the CD ROM built in. Big deal, you might say, but NEC have tarted it up and stuck in a few extra goodies for good measure. These include a faster CD drive, bigger memory and none of the loading lag of the old machine. The sleek grey unit is much more attractive and is doing a roaring trade in Japan, where impatient punters are snapping it up instead of waiting for the Megadrive CD ROM. But what about the old PC Engine owners? Well, NEC have released the Super System Card Version 3 which means you can use the existing CD Rom with the new software. The latest batch includes two excellent versions of very big games, namely Populous and Prince of Persia, and the latter looks like the best version yet. Hurrah! . MEGADRIVE GOES TALKY American Footie fans will go nuts for the latest offering from Sega. Joe Montana's Football 2 is ready to set new standards in Megadrive presentation. \"Wait a minute\", we hear you cry. Joe Montana 1 was a bit poo, wasn't it?\" You'd be right, but JM2 is a whole lot better. It plays completely differently to its predecessor, with a more arcadey feel to it. The biggest difference though, is in the speech. A sampled, crystal clear commentary is spoken all the way through the game, with calls for touchdown, sacking and general comment on the score and the way the match is being played! It really is jaw dropping stuff and has to be heard to be believed. Check out the full review in next month's issuel 012 "

Fantastic Four's Doo Human Torch is here to save the day! 2 SCORE god PAUS TIME  LIFE 08 SCORE 550 TIME 182 DON'T BE A MERCS BERK LIFE Whilst most games of this genre see your character continually running around, shooting everything in sight. Mercs gives you something extra the ability to jump into an unmanned vehicle and drive around, shooting everything in sight! Some of the jolly transportation dotted about the levels include tanks, boats and jeeps, all with well 'ard mounted weaponry. And on level three, there are a couple of gun emplacements bolted to the ground which, after killing the operators, you can use yourself to send the surrounding enemy to that great battlefield in the sky! Uos MAKE YOUR MERC SMIRK Extra lives are for cats, not Mercs. Our hard hero is given an energy bar which can be topped up by shooting the crates containing food and first-aid kits and collecting the contents. Also, some of the cases contain life enhancers which increase the size of the energy bar. giving you more slaughter power! A flaming good time with the bikers. Mercs in the arcades was a hard and fast affair which would be difficult to convert to home machines. Sega have risen to the challenge and met it head-on, producing a cartridge which is almost identical to the original in every way. Everything is here: all the levels, all the baddies and all the fun, excitement and adrenalinpumping action so abundant in the coin-slot version. There are loads of weapons to pick up . my personal favourite must be the flame-thrower which jets forth a huge stream of fire, incinerating everything in its path. Sprites and backdrops are of a high quality, although they seem to have been through a hot wash, having shrunk slightly during their transition to Megadrive. Sound is ace: a mixture of musical treats and effective spot sounds bring the game alive. One word of warning don't under any circumstances (even if you're a blaster biff!) play Mercs on Easy level. Take on either Normal or, better still, Hard difficulty which mimics the arcade setting giving the player a good value shoot 'em up which Megadrive owners should snap up.

"REVIEW MERCS You'll need more than that to save you from this big chopper! Mr Fairy Merc hides behind the scenery to escape the big boss. Bazookatastic! Hard man Merc takes out the Harrier. Strap on your best blasting booties and prepare for some hot stomping action in the best blast I've seen on the Megadrive in quite awhile! Quite simply, Mercs is a magnificent conversion of a pretty spanky coin-op, with the unbelievable bonus of two different games stuffed onto one cart! Great graphics and sound all add to that arcade feel, but it's the gameplay stakes where Mercs really comes into its own. Hard enough to keep you coming back for more, you'll be constantly amazed by the sheer variety of the levels and features packed into this stunning game. Controlling your Merc is a joy as he stomps around the scrolling playfield packed full of bad guys to blow away at the touch of a trigger, and those end of level bosses blow everything else out of the water! If you're a fan of romping shoot 'em up action and you've only got spondulicks for one cartridge, make sure this is it. Mercs is mega the best blast I've seen in ages.

"way w it your Cram ten vo en volumes nch radius $ into a two-in Imagine a compact disc that not only gives great quality sound. It also plays books, photographs, graphics and the written word. CDTV is like nothing you've experienced before. And it's everything you could want for entertainment, education and excitement. Il Picture, for instance, a child asking the question, \"Who was Martin Luther King?\" Easy. You just turn on the TV, put in a political history CD and not only can you read everything about King's life, you'll also see his face, hear the crowds and feel the emotion in his voice as he tells you his dream. But that's only one way of looking at it. With CDTV in your sitting room, suddenly your TV isn't just for watching. It's a mine of information. A book that talks back. The world's best teacher. A CD quality home karaoke. Or a most talented games player. II And if you're happy changing channels on your TV remote, you could work CDTV in seconds. Just select your choice of title from the 150 available BuM and you're away. Take music. Of course, you can play your audio CDs. But by pressing the buttons on your remote, you could also play drums with Hendrix. No experience required. Or remix any of your CDs to create your own versions. If your tastes are more classical, listen to Beethoven's music while you see a picture of the composer and read about his life's works. That's multimedia in its truest sense. \"Switch off the TV while you're doing your homework!\" That phrase could soon all but disappear. Because what better way to swot up on Shakespeare than by acting in a play and speaking the part of, say, Romeo with CDTV as your prompt. For sheer entertainment, there's nothing to touch CDTV. With Trivial Pursuits, you're not just answering questions on a card. You can ask, for example, \"Who is the person singing this song?\" II Whatever your interest, whatever your age, CDTV is a totally new way of looking at every subject under the sun.

"REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY IMAGEWORKS/VIVID IMAGE amurai. The ancient warrior class of feudal Japan, Honour, loy alty and integrity were the guiding principles of their life. Oh, mind you, they did like a spot of mindless violence too. When the word Samurai is mentioned, immediate images of sword wielding armour wearing, horse riding lunatics spring to mind. Quite right too. cos Samurai are right tasty geezers when it comes to a rumble. The Samurai in this story is a young trainee, learning his craft from Japan's greatest sword master. Unfortunately, this sword master has annoyed the local demon. In a fit of rage, he murders the sword master and tries to bump off the apprentice too. Calling on all his powers of Zen prayer, he calls up an ancient wizard. The wiz casts the demon into a time vortex, accidentally sending our hero with him. Into the future they go and the scene is set for a hacking, slashing, chopping. lopping gorefest. The game takes the form of a horizontally scrolling platform slash em up. It borrows heavily from other titles in the genre, including the likes of Strider, Legend of Kage and Shadow Dancer. The object of the game is to make your way to the skyscraper where the demon is hiding out and kill the suckerl Sounds easy, huh? Fraid not. First Samurai is huge. Tons of big levels and big baddies to defeat, as well as a fair old sprinkling of hidden objects. 10200 50 Yahoo! A brilliant game that doesn't rely on big names or arcade licensing to make it stand out. First Samurai starts of great and just gets better and better. It looks at first like a bog standard platform beat em up, but appearances can be deceiving. There is just so much to do! There are absolutely squillions of moves to learn and weapons to collect. The use of magic to solve problems adds just a hint of strategy and adventure, but enough to lift this game above the thronging masses. The graphics are excellent. Superb backdrops and detailed sprites, all animated with style and grace. Watch that groovy \"speed blur\" as the Samurai swings his chopper! I've never seen speed blur quite like it! Apart from the obvious graphical treats, there's the brilliant sampled sounds. Screams, tunes, explosions. All sampled and all superb. Best of all is the huge scale of the game, there are masses of levels, each of which is a labyrinthine maze, packed full of problems and foul denizens. If kicking ninja ass is your cup of tea, then you better get yourself a steaming mug of First Samurai and pronto. Possibly the best game on the Amiga this year and definitely the best of its kind. Cor, yummee! FRANK THE WONDERFUL WIZ To aid you in your quest of doom, a wizard can be called upon in times of danger. This wiz is the same incompetent old gitter who sent you to the future in the first place, so his help is a bit suspect if you ask me. Still, you occasionally come across insurmountable problems and he can sort em' out. For example, on the first level there's a volcano which is impassable. Calling up the wiz causes a rainstorm which soothes the raging fire. to enlist the help of said wiz, you have to collect bells. When rung. up he pops and if he can help he will, if not he gives you the bell back. Easy! 028 O'CONNOR "


"REVIEW PS 25 THE MAGIC POT Dotted amongst the scenery on each level, you will find big round pots. These pots are restart points, but at a cost. You have a sword icon at the bottom right hand side of the screen. This represents your martial spirit, or \"Ki\". If you crouch beside a point, this spirit level (ho, ho) will decrease. This means you have to decide whether starting a little further on is worth losing energy for. Sometimes you can make it to the next pot, but so tough are the baddies, that you'd have to be a superhero to do a pod 029 "


"REVIEW FIRST SAMURAI MARTIAL SPIRIT Killing the enemy is not only satisfying and fun, it's also very profitable. At the bottom of the screen is an sword. The length of the sword determines your martial spirit level. This endows you with several useful features, one of which is the use of your sword. If you let the sword length diminish (by colliding with baddies), then the sword flies away and the samurai gets a bit upset. The other ability you can lose, is the power to throw weapons. These are useful for bumping off otherwise innaccessable baddies. Killing the evil critters releases a spark of energy, this is absorbed by our sword-swinging hero and bumps up his spirit level. Hurrah! Strike a light! If it isn't one of the best platform beat em ups ever! Vivid Image have really gone to town on this one. It's been in development for more than a year and it looks like all that effort has paid off. The game is amazing on several counts. For a start, it's gobsmackingly huge and it keeps most of the levels in memory at the same time. This means that there's no annoying multi-load between levels. The graphics are fab, the sound is awesome and the range of moves available is vast. He can pick up weapons and hidden bonuses everywhere, giving the game the same kind of appeal you've come to expect from the Mario Bros. series. This game is a completely neato achievement and must rank as one of the best Amiga titles for ages. The game is at times, very difficult, but a save game option means you don't have to do it all in one sitting. The graphics get better and better as you progress through the game and just wait till you see the final showdown with the demon king. Top notch stuff this and there's no excuse for leaving this one off your Christmas shopping list. PAUL RAND SAUCY SAMURAI FACTS! Did you know...that the Samurai class of feudal Japan were perfectly within their rights to lop the heads off peasants who accidentally touched their sword? The Samurai believed that this kind of instant justice bred fear and respect in the general public. It worked too, because the Samurai stayed in charge for over three hundred years. Ironically, it was us geezers from old Blighty what put paid to their reign. The Japanese needed to trade and what not and eventually Western influence took over. Men started wearing suits and smoking pipes. The glorious tradition of the Samurai was diluted and may eventually dissappear. Aaah.

He's Sonic the Hedgehog, he's Sega's superhero and now he's on the Master System! Sonic's a small spiky star with a mission: to free all his furry friends from the clutches of the evil Dr Robotnik, who's captured all of Sonic's pals, brainwashed the poor critters and encased them in biomechanoid armour. To free his friends, Sonic must race through four zones each consisting of three scrolling zones. On his travels he'll find all sorts of hazards and puzzles, not to mention Eggman's forces out in force to thwart our hero. Luckily Sonic can fight back by curling himself into a ball and leaping into any enemy, skewering them on his spikes. If that's not enough, he can turn himself into a whirling rodent of doom to put paid to the bad guys at a stroke by literally going Supersonic! 1:00 MEGA ON THE MASTER! OK, the first thing you need to know is that Sonic on the Master System is a completely different game than the Megadrive version! This is by no means a straight conversion from the System's big brother: the layout of all the levels has been radically changed, the bonus screen is completely different and the whole thing is blooming brill! This is big news for Master System owners everywhere: it means you have your own Sonic game which even your Mega drive-owning mates can't play unless they invest in a Power Base Converter to play one of the hottest games around! MAGIC RING MALARKEY! By collecting the magic rings which lie scattered around the land, Sonic can earn bonus points and a bit of protection into the bargain. Contact with an enemy is neutralised by the rings, but on collision with a baddie he'll lose all the rings he's just picked up! If Sonic has no rings left and collides with something 'orrible, that's one life less in your quest for success! But here's the good news: if Sonic can collect more than 50 rings he'll be transported to the bizarre bonus level for all sorts of fabby fun 'n' japes just the way you like it! 0:32 * * * TTTTTTTTTT 034 "

SPARKLE: Encases Sonic in a glittering magic shield, which allows him to race through nasties without getting a scratch! Careful, though, as this is only temporary! SHIELD: Similar to before, but this surrounds Sonic with a large protective sphere. which vanishes upon contact with anything lethal! MAGIC SHOES: Makes Sonic even faster than ever (however difficult that may be!). Only temporary, but helps our spiky star reach parts of the level that other hedgehogs cannot reach... SONIC: Gives Sonic an extra life! wereld BONUSES! BRILL BOUNCY More good news for Master System Sonic fans the bonus screen is different from the Megadrive version! Instead of the swirly-spinny collect the rings spectacular, our Sonic goes bouncing bonkers to grab as many rings as he can! It's a laugh and a half as our spiky blue superstar leaps and bounces about the screen and you'll only see it on the Megarive's little brother. Hurrah! oo 00 00 00 0:39 Roo 00 00 They said it couldn't be done, but Sonic's arrived on the Master System and he looks just as good as he did in Megadrive form! With the benefit of a few tweaks, the Sega programmers have produced a Sonic game that looks superb, U has the smoothest, fastest scrolling ever seen on this machine and is packed full of new features, including new screen layouts, brilliant bonus screens and more hidden items and bonuses than you can shake a spine at. My only gripe is that the game's too easy. It's also a fault of the Megadrive version, but it would have been nice to have a bit more challenge! Still, there's plenty to do in the game, and you constantly go back to it to see whether you missed anything and whether you can improve your score! Ask Santa to bring you a copy...

"REVIEW   « LOIx3 x1 MAP MAKING MERRIMENT! Sonic on the Master System even manages to add a few improvements to the Megadrive original which is saying something! For example, at the start of each level a huge picture of the land pops up on the screen so's you always know exactly where you are and which level your on and have a good old gander at all the thrills still to come! YAHOO! Just when you were getting fed up with your Megadrive-owning mates getting all the good stuff, along comes Sonic on the Master System with a new style game you won't find anywhere else! This is what Master fans the world over have been waiting for, and what a debut this is for everyone's favourite Sega superstar! Sonic peits around the smooth-scrolling screen at a fair old lick and there's loads to explore throughout this feast of gorgeous sprites, beautifully detailed and colourful backdrops. Sound is a fair enough rendition of those Sonic tunes, but it's in the playability stakes that Sonic really grabs a gold. Even though there aren't that many enemies around and they're fairly easily dusted, the urge to explore will keep you coming back again and again until you've finally beaten the game. Grab Sonic a bit quick and watch your mates' jaws drop, even if they have got Megadrives. I quarantee they'll queue up for a go and your head will blow up like a balloon 'cos this is brill. TIM EBESHILL OH NO, IT'S DOCTOR DOOM! At the end of each zone, our sky-blue spiky-top is confronted by the evil doctor himself, intent on turning Sonic into hedgehog ple.

"REVIEW 5252 AMIGA ANICA .99 225802 0 BY GREMLIN asten that seatbelt and rip up the tarmac in the sequel to Gremlin's exhilarating racer Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge! This time round the Esprit has a new racing partner: the less powerful, but better handling Lotus Elan with a spanky top speed of some 140mph! There are stacks of new courses to contend with, each with their own particular conditions and hazards. There's also a change in overall objective, too. Race across eight distinct levels, each containing a number of checkpoints which you need to reach before the timer runs out. Keep an eye out too for turbo boosts left by the roadside giving your Elan a serious kick up the exhaust. Meanwhile, watch for obstacles such as water, oil, fallen trees and, of course, the horde of other racers trying to beat you home! CHAL Ralny weather just the job for some great wheelspins STAR 15 » » 2 FOG ME, IT'S DRIVING RAIN! A feature of Lotus Turbo Challenge il which wasn't included in the original is weather conditions. Fog, rain and snow each play a part in making your job that much tougher. There's even a night-time stage, complete with long tunnels full of echoes! It's hands up time. I was that man who wasn't all that excited by the first Lotus Turbo Challenge game 1 felt that all the pretty graphics in the world still couldn't compensate for the fact that the gameplay was pretty shallow. While Lotus Turbo Challenge 11 suffers to some degree from the same allment, the change in playing styles adds a lot to the overall playability. Gremlin have actually improved upon the already brilliant road effect used in the original, making it even smoother and faster, with scores of roadside objects flowing past without so much of a hint of jerk or bounce. There's a real sense of urgency about the game, due mainly to the tightness of the time limits between each checkpoint. Hit one object too many and you'll conk out about an inch before crossing the line very frustratIng, but just the spur required to make you press that fire button and start all over again! The multi-player option is obviously the one which brings Lotus Il to life there's nothing more satisfying than battling against real people . and if you games of this type then here's the one to go for. PAUL RAND » De "


"IREVIEW 5252 Checkpoint with only lour seconds to spare RBQ CHECK CK LLEN BS FUN AND FOUR-PLAY You'll doubtless remember the split-screen, two player option available in Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge. Well, the sequel has gone one better! As well as this entertaining feature, there's also the possibility to link two machines together allowing an incredible four players to take to the roads together! Holy Moley! Unlike Sad Rand I was bowled over by the first Lotus game until very recently I was still loading it up for an occasional burn. Now there's no need 'cos Lotus Il is here and it's even better! Basically, Gremlin have listened to all the feedback from the first game, improved the sequel wherever possible and thrown in tons of extra options for good measure. Now you can race through snow, rain or fog a particularly brilliant effect the like of which I haven't seen on an Amiga before. With so much to see and do and so many ways to improve your game, you'll probably stay glued to the telly until there's a power cut. Graphically excellent, there's a true sensation of speed as you weave your way through the other cars, avoiding all the hazards and desperately trying to clock the best time possible. In two player mode the game really comes into its own With two computers linked up to four players can take part and here the game becomes a hoot and a half.

TALL TALES OF A TOTAL TWERP mon Dear Yobbo, Here's a tale of what happened to me the other day as I was going to get my monthly copy of CVG. I was walking down my front door steps when I tripped over a stone and broke my nose. Nevertheless I continued walking until I came to a one-way road on which a car passes once every five years, so without checking I crossed over. Suddenly an old age pensioner in a threewheeled car came and ran me over, breaking my left arm! I carried on walking until five big bullies jumped out at me and beat me up, spraining my ankle, but I limped on until I reached my newsagent. There I tripped over a milk crate and ended up hav. ing to pay for the lot. Then I managed to say \"Please can I have my copy of CVG\", after which I was carried home by a nice old lady and got into bed to read it. Joe Auden Lascajeres, France.

By the way, no one can party like me, so don't even think about it... IT'S EASY ON THE PC! Dear Yob, Answer this letter if you can and please use your brain this time! I've got an Olivetti 386\\S and would like your help with the following problems. 1. Which computer or console has the ability to produce arcadelike games? 2. Would the 386 be able to do Pitfighter exactly like the arcades? Right, enough of that. If home games get really good, people won't go to the arcades anymore because they can just sit and wait for the game to come out on their home computer or con sole! Jonathan Marshall, SOME Donemana, Co Tyrone.SPAIN -> YOB: Are you a bit daft or wot, Jon? The CVG crew have been telling you for ages that the Megadrive and Super Famicom can give you almost arcade perfect action with sound and graphics to match. If you've got a 386 PC compatible with VGA graphics and 16+ Mhz speed with superhuge memory then you can run arcade style games on it. but I'd suggest getting some brains first. NOT TAKING THE MICKY Dear Yob, I always see adverts in your magazine for games that can be bought in England. Is there anywhere in Ireland where you can get Gameboy software like WWF, Batman, Robocop and Bill and Ted's Adventure? Adrian Sipple, Limerick, Ireland. YOB: Since most of the titles you list are only available on grey import, you might as well stick to buying mail order with a reputable firm. This probably means you'll have to get an international money order, but if you can't be bothered with all that blarney then I suggest you get your dad to buy the stuff with his credit card, give him the appropri. ate cash and wait for those great games to roll in! But before you part with your hard-earned, make sure you check out GO! (free with CVG) for the lowdown on what's hot and what's not. YOB: Let me convey my most sincere and humble apologies for my ill-tempered, bad attitude in the Mailbag over the past few months. It really is quite unforgivable and uncalled for. Luckily I've seen the error of my ways, so I've decided to answer your computer games questions in a civilised and polite manner. Now then, what were your questions? Well blow me down, you don't seem to have any which is probably because you're both about as much use as a fart in a spacesuit. Sorry boys, but you'll just have to do better than that. The whole idea behind Yob's Mailbag is that you send in funny and informative letters for me to answer. But if you insist on submitting scribbled drivel, there's not a lot I can do about it, is there? AMERICAN DREAM Dear Yob. I have recently spent nine weeks in the land of people with silly accents, who carry expensive cameras, clog up London every summer and describe everything as \"neat\".

"REVIEW MEGADRIVE .99 BY SEGA PAUSE ruesome old Death Adder may be no more, thanks to your antics in Golden Axe, but that doesn't stop his minions from finding a new leader to gather behind. The evil monster eventually chosen is one bad mother called Dark Guld, a creature so vile and horrible you'd probably drop your chips if you met him in the queue at the kebab shop. You'd wet yourself, unless you happen to be one of the three warriors who vanquished Death Adder in the first Golden Axe quest. They're recalled for duty, kitted out with their favourite weapons and Ax Battler the Barbarian has even had hair extensions! Off they trot through the kingdom, onward to Dark Guld's fortress, slashing multi-coloured baddies as they go. That's the way to do it! GO SELECE PLAYER THE CHOICE IS YOURS Like the original Golden Axe on the Megadrive, one or two players can choose from any of the three characters for a spot of baddy-bashing fun and japery. There's also a Duel option, where players can hone their weapon-weilding skills by going up against each enemy in turn in a oneon-one fight to the death! CREDITS 3 SD   Because the original Golden Axe was such a close conversion on the Megadrive, I was really looking forward to seeing the se quel. And I must say that, although Golden Axe Il is a good-looking, playable beat 'em up, I was somewhat disappointed to find that it's almost exactly the same as the first game in every way. Most of the baddies that appeared in Golden Axe return for another kicking, except this time round they're a different colour-pink, mostly. Even the level layouts give the player a distinct feeling of deja vu, with all the humps, bridges and so on seeming to be in the same place as before. Golden Axe II isn't a bad game. If you haven't got the first one this is definitely worth the purchase but there isn't enough variety here to keep Golden Axe owners interested in the long-term. PAUL Scene mer 048 RAND "


"DIREVIEW IN = : ACTION FOR HARD MEN! Just to make the game a little more challenging the number of levels rises the greater the difficulty setting. Old women who play on Easy must battle their way through five stages, while those toughies who select either Normal or Hard difficulty can tackle an extra level! Golden Axe was one of the best slash 'em ups ever, and office excitement reached fever pitch as we slapped the sequel into the Megadrive. Hang on, have we got the right cartridge? Isn't this the original? It might as well have been, 'cos Golden Axe Il offers very little indeed above what we've seen before. Make no mistake it's a fab game in its own right, but we were all expecting improvements and additions which just aren't there. Quite simply this is more of the same to the same standards of its predecessor, which were admittedly very high. It's fair to say the graphics have been tweaked, the backgrounds look great and sound is cool but it's just not a significant advance over the original. If you're a brand new Megadrive owner and are looking for good thump'n' slash laffs then I'd recommend you get this cart, but if you've already got Golden Axe don't bother. Why pay extra cash for something you've already got? TIM BOONE "

"REVIEW MASTER SYSTEM .99 BY US GOLD It came from nowhere to cause a revelation in the computer I gamesplaying world. Its addictive qualities knew no bounds; an unusual yet instinctive control method made the game stand out from the crowd. It became one of the all-time best sellers and spawned a series of sequels and data disks as long as your arm. Its name? Kick Off, of course. We've grabbed every console version of the game for the definitive CVG lowdown on the whole blooming lot! And if you look through GO! (free with this issue) you'll find Exclusive reviews of the Gameboy and Game Gear versions as well! CVG's soccer superstars pull on their booties and put console Kick Off to the test... Many scoffed, guflawed and generally chortled at the thought of a Master System version of Kick Oft; how on earth could an 8-bit console come anywhere near to recreating the finest sport game on the all-powerful Amiga? Commodore's machine is fast, has great dollops of colour and can handle reams of complex code, whilst Sega's little 'un...is none of the above. US Gold are producing the game, as opposed to original publish ers Anco the boys down Dartford way don't have a Master System license with the conversion job being handled by Tiertex, whose previous work includes the Sega version of Indy III. It's taken a long time for Kick Off to make it to the Master System, but here it is at last is it any good or what, Brian? SELECT TACT 3279089DE If I didn't know already, would have found it hard to believe that this version of Kick Off is running on a supposedly inferior Master System. This is absolutely terrific! Everything is in there the free-flowing ball allowing realistic dribbling; aftertouch, giving the player the power to score some amazing goals; graphics almost identical to the Amiga version! And although the speed is down slightly on the original, it's the perfect pace for joypad play. Sound is seriously lacking . then again, Kick Off on computer isn't exactly renowned for its sonic treats and, anyway, Kick Off fans don't play the game for the pretty piccies and tinkly tunes, they play for some smart, frenzied football joviality. And Super Kick Off on the Master System has it. Lots of it. Put simply, this is the best cartridge on the Master System and if you don't steam down to the shops, cash in hand, shouting \"Mr Storekeep, please vend me one of your finest Super Kick Off software packages forthwith\", you really should scrap your Sega and take up burial-mound inspecting, or something equally sad.

"IREVIEW The red team's number eleven floats the ball in from the opposition corner.

But if you're looking for it under that well-known title, you won't find it anywhere. That's because its called Pro Soccer on the Fammy, the apparent reason for this name-change being there's a zip manufacturer in Japan with the unlikely name of Kick Off! Considering the power of Nintendo's raging beast, the game should have been a doddle to convert. Everything is in there; trapping, passing, fouls, free kicks, penalties, the whole kit and caboodle. Except for one important aspect playability Control of the ball is too difficult; it's almost impossible to keep possession for any amount of time and, should you eventually find yourself in front of goal, the unfriendly joypad system ensures your shot flies off anywhere but toward the back of the net.

As you can see from these extensive screenshots, programmers Enigma Variations (who also produced Kick Off on the Gameboy see your free copy of GO! for the full review!) have cap tured the look of the Amiga game perfectly, with player sprites strik ingly similar to those on Commodore's 16-bit powerhouse. All the features of the original are crammed in there too, from corners and free kicks to throw-ins and penalties. In fact, Imagineer have gone one better and included some of the options from the Final Whistle data disk! So you lucky NES lot can laugh at your chums who don't have offside rules, as that is just one of the extras available! What we want to know, though, is whether the gameplay can match the aesthetics.

We've had so much Megadrive stuff in this month we hardly know where to stuff it all! So welcome to the CVG Megadrive review special, where the CVG boys take the lid off three hot new carts and give you the lowdown on the lot. Take it away, lads... ood Grief, it's the Gomolans! Just when you thought you were . safe from those liquer-swilling aliens of doom, here they come again to threaten life. the universe and everything And boy do these suckers mean business, which is why you'll need a pretty swish space ship and loads ol sexy weapons to take them on. Lucky we've got a few tricks up our sleeves, eh? So suit up with your best blasting booties and prepare to dish out some big-time destruction. Well, what else are you gonna do when the future of mankind is at stake? Run home to watch Neigh bours? SPACE BATTLE GOMOLA PAUSE GRAB THOSE GAMOLLAS Gomola's two player mode is where the laffs really begin, and you can tackle the enemy in two ways. You can either have two ships on screen, or one player control ling the ship and the other the sight. This second option is very original, a tad tricky and very weird! WHACKY WEAPONS WAHAY! The novel feature of Space Battle Gomola is the way your weapons work. There are the standard pick 'em ups and extra weapons, but Gomola has a bit of a twist. Holding one button releases a target which can be controlled independently soaring off and shooting otherwise innaccessable bits of the screen. Of course in the meantime your spaceship could be in deep trouble, so you need to keep your wits about you for maximum devastation of those alien scumbags all of which are named after different liquers! This element of strategic gameplay turns Gomola into something a little special. The plot is the usual nonsense about space critters and dark emperors, but ignore that and check this one out. PAUSE Yowzer! A top notch and very original variation on the shooty theme, Gomola is one smart cart. The control method is initially hard to get to grips with, but once mastered it opens up a whole new world of bizarre, horrifying and inexplicable alien blasting fun. The alien attack patterns are really challenging and some of the later sections are tough to negotiate. This kind of supertough challenge is exactly what the genre needs. The graphics don't look much initially, but as you progress so do the quality of the backgrounds. Some of the later levels are a visual treat. Musically, the game is a bit lacking, but the raucous sound FX more than make up for it. The two player mode is a laugh and a half you can thank your pal if he saves your ass, or kick it hard if he gets you killed! The options screen gives you massive potential for customising gameplay, which adds to the overall grooviness of this spanky cart.

"MODE Jippety jeepers! Not content with roaming his North Eastern haunts, doing Elvis Impressions In basement bars and stuffing most of the CVG crew at Kick Off 2, PAUL RAND is back for another batch of cheeky cheats and jolly japes with the hottest tips this side of Brigette Nielsen. Don't you want to be part of the hottest cheats section in the world? Send everything you have from tips on games to hints for stopping flowers wilting to: JUMPY JABOOLAS, IT'S PAUL'S CHUCK IN THE BUCKET CHEAT MODE COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. There's a chucklesome hundred smackers worth of software for the best tip or map, and a bag full of diced carrots if your cheat's been ripped off. You have been warned... WYOJ nu the egg, put the egg back down and use the pickaxe to break through the rubble, now collect the carpet. Go up and drop the bean in the manure and return to the castle, dropping the door-knocker at the door. Pick up the bucket and and go back to the base of the volcano, fill the bucket in the water and drop it on the manure. Are you still here? Good: did you know that F117A is coming on the Super Famicom? Nobody else does! Anyway, back to the cheat: Climb up the beanstalk that sprouts and jump across the clouds. Go to the cloud castle, drop the rug on the spears and jump up, then walk right, jump left, dodge the spikes and jump up right, fall right then walk over to Daisy's cage and press fire. When she comes down, go over to her and press fire once again. And that, folks, is that! Phew! FANTASY WORLD DIZZY What with Wales being so crap at rugby, the taffs need a bit of cheering up so let's hope this solution to Code masters' jolly egg-straveganza from Gareth Williams, Newport, Gwent does the job. Remember, for infinite lives type in IMMORTAL on the high scores screen. First, give the apple to the troll, now pick up the bread and throw the water into the fire. Collect the heavy boulder. Now give the bread to the rat, hop-skip across the crocodile pit and pick up the boulder on the other side. Cross back over and drop the boulders on the staircase. Go up to the switch and press fire, jump up and then jump right and don't bother with Denzill Jump onto the table and walk left as far as you can with out falling off, then jump left, jump right and walk right, jump to collect the key. Jump back and up into the attic, collect the bone and proceed to the portcullis at the bottom of the castle, walk through it and jump into the Amorog's den Quickly walk right and pick up the boulder, then drop the bone. Jump out of the pit then walk back and pick up another boulder, jump over the Amorog, walk left, drop the rocks in the water and go back to collect the other one. At this stage the water will rise so cross over to the other side and collect the potion from dozy. Travel back to the crocodile pit, jump over it and walk over to the dragon now get close to it and drop the potion quickly go past the dragon to pick up the sack. Go to the bottom of the treehouse and pick up the cow, then climb up to Grand Dizzy to get a pickaxe and a crowbar. Go right and collect the door knocker and proceed right to the base of the volcano to collect the third key. Now go to the well and use the crowbar. You will fall into a strange new world! Get on top of the barrel and jump onto the church roof, go inside the church and get the final key. Go into the market square and give the shopkeeper the cow. He will give you a bean, then go back through the well and go to the lift house. Put the keys down by the boxes and when a message comes up four times go down to the dragon and pick up NAVY SEALS It's all action when Leigh Jackson is about. Leigh lives in Beverley, North Humberside and is an avid Amiga basher. Here are his tips on Ocean's low-quality shoot 'em up to prove it. When asked to enter your name in the high score table, type PSBOYS. Start the game, press H and hit ESCAPE to move onto the next level. 069 "

KID ICARUS Old Gazza Clare is back, with a cheat for this the game Frank O'Connor reckons is \"a right good laff.\" By putting in this code you will be invincible: ICARUS FIGHTS, MEDUSA ANGELS. Corky! SUPER MARIO BROS 2 Phew! More soopa stuff from the warped mind of Gary Clare. Here's some warp zones for the prequel to the utterly megadocious Super Mario Bros 3! There is a warp zone on level 1-3. Get a red potion bottle and drop it on the white and red patterned pot instead of going inside it. After you've dropped the potion bottle on it enter and you will be transported to level 4-1. There is another warp zone on level 4-2, the method is the same and the pot is hidden under a section of pathway on a little island which is all by itself. The red potion is on top of a three level island. This transports you to level 6-1. Before you go to this warp zone at the beginning of level 4-2 you can pick up an extra power up by going left instead of right, jumping to a small whale. You will find a clump of grass, under which there is a small potion. Drop this and you'll get your power up. There's another warp zone on level 5-3.

"REVIEW 921) FAMICOM BY EPIC/SONY RECORDS .99 Door Jerry Boy. Once, he was a lovable cute little boy, now by some horrible trick of fate he has been transformed into a small lump of blue jelly. Now this would suggest two things. One, that this is not a thing that usually happens to small children and two, that somewhere along the line Jelly Boy somehow got translated as Jerry Boy. The game itself was one of the first titles to be developed by Sony for the Playstation, Their Famicom compatible CD Rom machine. Jerry Boy has to try and regain his human shape as well as saving his girlie from the clotches of an evil wizard and the amorous intentions of the local bully. To do this, he must ooze his blob-like figure through a lortuous series of platform and nasty-filled levels. Along the way he will encounter various seemingly insurmountable problems. Fortunately, Jerty Boy has a couple of jelly like japes up his quivering sleeve. He can leap tremendous distances and scale walls like...well, like a small lump of blue jelly. As far as firepower goes, Jerry Boy is evidence of why the US Air Force don't use jelly in tactical strike situations, Jerry Boy is crap. He can't fight for toffee. He can howeverleap onto the backs of bad guys and knock them over He can also use his jellified proboscis to bop the nasties from below. Sego now young Jelly-me-lad and seek out your destiny, being a small lump of blue jelly is no life for a young boy. POUSE 1-B START PAUSE JOVIAL JELLY JAPES Jerry Boy has a few neato tricks when it comes to bashing baddies. He can pick up balls which can then be hurled at the critters, or leap onto their heads and squash them. Perhaps the funniest weapon at his disposal is his stretchy nose. As he leaps. he can push out his nose at high speed and bop any nasties above him. This talent comes in useful for defeating end of level baddies. Ho, ho! It's a jelly's life for me. Never before have the trials and tribulations of being a jelly been portrayed with so much realism and detail. Jerry Boy looks initially like the sad little cousin of the Mario Bros. Once you start playing though, you begin to realise that there's a lot more to Jerry Boy than meets the eye. Learning to control the wobbly little critter is half the fun. He accelerates, climbs, bulges and bounces his way to glory, but getting used to the control method is a little tricky. Once mastered though, a whole new world of jellified pranks opens itself up. Like the Mario series, there are lots of hidden rooms and secret levels to dis. cover and lots of platform related puzzles to solve. The music that plays throughout is brilliant. It starts off with a slightly twee tune, reminiscent of children's TV, but soon changes, including spooky haunting tracks and almost orchestral fanfares and themes. The graphics are simple, but really well designed, with smart sprites and lovely backgrounds. All in all, Jerry Boy is the single best simulation of being a small piece of blue jelly that I have ever seen. FRANK 3510 USNE THANKS... ...to Advanced Coole E tertainment (07138 048 for the review carlige. O'CONNOR "


"REVIEW PS OOO OBBO POUSE PAUSE THE SADDEST STORY EVER... The saddest thing you're ever likely to hear is the grim tale of Jerry Boy's origin. An evil Wizard wants to steal children, but Jerry Boy stands in his way. The love he has for his girlfriend is dis tasteful to the wiz, so he enlists the help of the school bully, who fancies Jerry's girl. The wiz then kidnaps Jerry's babe and in order to stop Jerry coming to rescue her, he turns poor Jerry Boy into a small lump of blue jelly. During the game, Jerry meets his friends and parents, but none of them recognise him. It fair brings a tear to your eye so it does. At one point, he spots his parents in their car and just as he reaches them, they tear off, leaving only a cloud of dust. The only one who recognises him is his little dog. Boo hoo, sob sob. Jerry Boy is a game which eve ryone in the office has been raving about since it arrived and for the life of me I just can't figure out why. I for one find the concept of controlling a small piece of jelly ridiculous, but that's not the reason for my indifference. Sure, it looks pretty, but then again doesn't everything on the Famicom? I certainly wouldn't say that the artist has gone to town over creation of the graphics they begin to look very samey after only a short while. But it's the gameplay which has my mind wandering whenever I sit down to play Jerry Boy, as it just isn't exciting enough. Shuffle along, jump onto the heads of baddies, and that's just about it for me. I've no doubt that this type of game is of great appeal to a load of folk, but I like my action a little more hectic, ta very much.

After forming a planet and selecting a tribe, the real work of building your backward race into a hi-tech bunch of guys capable of clever things like, um, blowing up your beloved world. Things would be quite simple, were it not for the other civilisations on the planet, doing their own thing which usually means trying to spoil your plans by going and kicking in your personal civilisation. Employ the subtle art of diplomacy to keep the other sides at bay, or form armies to crush them with if they get a bit out of hand. Think you can do the biz? Just remember it's a whole planet we're talking about... UPDATE Railroad Tycoon was converted across 16-bit, so you can expect Civilisation to turn up on your Amiga or ST sooner rather than later.

"REVIEW AMIGA .99 BY DOMARK THE omark's Rugby The World Cup is played from a Kick-Off style bird's-eye view, complete with radar in the top-left hand portion of the screen. One or two players can choose their favourite teams, replay memorable matches from the World Cup in a single match or play the entire tournament. After selecting the length of time for each hall, the action begins. All of the features of the real game are Simulated, scrummages, line-outs and drop kicks to name but a few. At the end of time, the team with the most points wins through to the next game, with the loser having to suffer the shame and agony of defeat. RUGBY WORLD CUP PICK UP A PLETHORA OF POINTS Unlike soccer, where scoring a goal means one point and back to the kick-off, rugby gives you a number of opportunities to lift your total above that of the opposition. There's the try, worth four points and scored when you touch down the ball in the opposition's in-goal area. Achieve this and you can go for another two points with a \"conversion\" kicking the ball between the other team's goalposts. A penalty is awarded should the other side disobey the rules of the game a successful penalty is worth three points; as is a drop-goal, which can be attempted at any time and, again, must be put between the opposition posts. AMICA GRAPHICS 76 SOUNDS 70 PLAYABILITY 75 LASTABILITY 69 OVERALL 72 Domark have gone for the Kick Off fanatics with their Rugby World Cup game. The overhead view, radar and general style of play are reminiscent of that classic footy thrash, apart from the obvious differences between rugger and soccer. It's all quite fast and the programmers certainly know their sport, it's just that the game doesn't grab the player enough for him to stay and scrum-down for too long. There seem to be a few errors in Rugby The World Cup too. For instance, I kicked the ball over the line, expecting a line-out, yet was greeted by a scrummage! On the subject of scrums, they require a Daley Thompson Decathlon-style waggle to win and, after a few goes, this can play hell on your arm. There aren't too many rugby sims on computer; unfortunately, this one is destined to be forgotten quite rapidly, due to its unremarkable gameplay. PAUL RAND 090 "


"IREVIEWS AMIGA .99 BY AUDIOGENIC V orld Class Rugby from Audiogenic is a more strategic affair V V than the Domark game. It's also viewed in 3D, in a similar style to John Madden's Football on the Megadrive. Again, all the s of the game of Rugby Union have been implemented; there's a fifteen-man team to grapple with, as well as the opportunity to score points-a-plenty if you're good enough. Unlike Rugby World Cup from Domark, sel-pieces such as lineouts are played by selecting a pre-arranged move from a choice of eight, after which the boys do their stuff according to your selection. The 3D can be switched to a two-dimensional view if you can't quite grasp the idea of depth WORLD CLASS RUGBY P ESTEVE PHILLIAMS While Domark's Rugby is an arcade-style, grab 'n' run game, World Class Rugby from Audiogenic leans to the strategy side, with preplanned set-pieces and the like. The 3D graphic style owes much to John Madden's Football on the Megadrive, although things run quite a bit slower. The speed is increased by switching to two-dimensional mode, but it really doesn't matter that the pace isn't blistering, so long as the game is accurate and playable and it is. If you don't understand the rules of rugger, you'll probably be somewhat confused at the start; why, for instance, can you only pass backwards? The great thing about World Class Rugby, though, is that It's so easy to pick up as you play. The most realistic simulation of this most English of pastimes, World Class Rugby is a game which will appeal to many, not just fans of the sport. PAUL RAND WHERE DID RUGBY COME FROM? Like many sports (apart from silly ones like Sumo wrestling and American Football). Rugby was invented by the English. The story goes that, in 1823, a pupil of Rugby School called William Webb Ellis, whilst playing a game of football, picked up the ball and ran with it. From that day, the game of Rugby was born.

"FAME I'M GOING TO LIVE FOREVER.. PEARING IN THE A TOLKING TO KING JOHN TALKING   Here's Luke Murray, 11, with Colin Baker at the Derngate Centre in Northampton. Just in case you don't know who our Col is, the sign behind him reveals all. Who? You wannabe famous ? You got it! We had a great response to our recent compo asking you to send in piccies of yourselves with various celebs. Some of them we've never heard of, most of them we know and a few are even more famous than Paul Rand! So huge was our \"flip me, I'll get a hernia\" mailbag that we've decided to extend the closing date for the compo until, well, whenever we decide we've had enough celebrelated japery or when CVG post heroes Rob 'n' George get fed up with hauling it all up the stairs! So the good news for all you celeb spotters out there is to keep sending in those pictures. Remember, we're looking for genuine photos of you with a celeb the funnier the better and there's  worth of software to the celebrity spotter we reckon is best of the bunch! So grab those piccies, include a hilarious letter about the celeb, don't forget to add your own name and address and wang the whole lot off to: I WANNABE FAMOUS 2, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1R 3AU. Unfortunately we can't return your photos, so make sure you don't mind losing the piccy before sending it off! In the meantime here are a few who have already made it through to the shortlist for a prize. They've already won fame and fortune by appearing in the greatest games mag in the universe! Incredible but true! CVG fan and all-round hero John Charlton bumped into Bugs Bunny at Bournemouth! \"He's very fluffy,\" sez John, from Barnwood, Glos, who denies he was mistaken for a carrot... Robin Theakston, 10, was obviously so bowled over at meeting Children's TV star Andi Peters he immediately sprouted a pair of rabbit's ears up top! Oh dear, you're out for the count. Bradford boyo Richard Burrows thought he'd catch the CVG boys napping with his fake-a-roony piccy of himself and Frank Bruno. Honestly, the things some people will do for a bit o' free software...

"REVIEW | REVIEW FAMICOM .99 BY CAPCOM Natty boxers, eh? very now and then, there comes a game which will not only shift thousands of copies of the title itsell, but also help sell the host machine. On the NES it was Super Mario Bros. On the Mega drive, it was Sonic The Hedgehog. Now, finally, the Famicom has a game that will stop the traffic and finally silence the moaning Mega drive owners who claim the Fammy is crap. Super Ghouls n' Ghosts has finally arrived. It's been due for months now, but the final product looks pretty special. You take the role of Sir Arthur, a knight with severe girl trouble. Fact is, every time he looks like gely ting to grips with some babe, along comes an evil demon, stealing the girl and whisking her away to some dark and gloomy castle. Sir Arthur has had this happen twice before and he's a bit sick of it. So he straps on his special combat armour and heads out into the night, lo do battle with hordes of ghosis n goblins and things that go, bump in the night. Armed initially with a throwing lance, he has to make his way across the vast and dangerous reaches of the evil, kingdom. Along the way, he'll discover all manner of traps, mon sters and nasty tricks. If he's to survive, he'll need strength, cour age and a string of garlic. 3763 Yikes! It's time to go back to the scary world of Ghouls'n'Ghosts! Those of you expecting a conversion of the original arcade game will be in for a bit of a shock. Super Ghouls'n'Ghosts takes the theme, beefs up the graphics, porks up the sound and changes the game completely. The work that has gone into this game is quite staggering. From the intro onwards you will sit, limp-jawed with amazement and utter strange gurgling noises. Meals will be forgotten, school missed, jobs lost, the nation itself will grind to a halt as the country is gripped by the feverish intensity of this game. Ok, so that's a slight exaggeration, but Super G+G is a top bit of console entertainment. The graphics are truly fab, the range of weapons available is vast and the power up armour adds just a hint of strategy. The only niggle as far as I'm concerned, is the incredible difficulty. Even on beginner level, Sir Arthur's quest is quite unfeasibly hard, easy level is next up and the use of the word easy is an obvious and terrible lie. Best of all though is the fabberoony music. It's kind of like a Hollywood B Movie, but with a better orchestra. Get yo butt down to Mr. Spanky's Famicom Emporium right now and buy yourself a copy of this dreamy game. FRANK A It's no good stabbing the wall! 096 O'CONNOR "


"DREV CHESTY SURPRISES As in the previous games, the latest in the G+G series features the crazed magician. In this game, he hides in a chest and appears when you shoot it. The location of the wizard varies, so shooting chests can be a gamble. In this game he's very cruel, if his bolt of magic strikes you, you turn into one of four things, a small baby, a seal a girl or even a wasp. When transformed, you become very weak and vulnerable and it takes a while for the effect to wear off. A This guy needs a dentist and fast! There's a nice, new suit of armour in that chest and dosh in the bag. TEHOSTELE ooo noooooooan pa POWER TO YOUR GHOULIES There are a whole load of weapons to choose from, seven in all, plus a mystery weapon none of us have found yet. Each of these weapons has its own special features. Some are fast, some are powerful, some curve in a gentle arc and others are almost entirely useless. You have to be careful when deciding what weapon to use for each level and if your luck's anything like ours, the weapon probably won't turn up. Collectinga suit of green armour powers up the weapon by one stage, giving that extra bit of force when needed. Collecting a golden suit of armour gives you something even better though. It endows the wearer with magical abilities, including a rather groovy smart bomb. Sadly though, these are few and far between 097 "


"H REVIEW SUPER GHOULS AND GHOSTS AND GHOSTS Did you spill his pini? Flamineckla bla orange baddy! THE SNEAKY BIT AT THE END Just when you think you've completed Super G+G. you'll find out something very horrible indeed. Well, you will if you can read Japanese anyway. The very last baddie flees after the last battle and your girlie says something in Japanese. In case you complete it, C+VG will now provide a rough translation. The girl basically tells you that the last baddie isn't dead and you need to find a special weapon to defeat him. This means you have to go right back to the start and try again, looking out for the mystery weapon the whole time. Sneaky or what? HWAM No Ever felt cold, lonesome and left out? Me too, 'cos I just don't think Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts is the best thing since takeaway vindaloo! Luckily I'm not completely alone: the man Rand agrees with me, but everybody else in the CVGMean Machines office thinks we're both off our rockers! Sure, the graphics are fantastic and the sound is unbelievable but that's true of most Famicom games. It's the gameplay I simply don't get along with it's old hat and, to be honest, almost boring! We've all seen this particular sideways scrolling jump and avoid or lose your pants scenario time and time again, ever since Ghosts 'n' Goblins turned up in the arcades, spawning generations of computer and console clones. I didn't like it the first time round and my opinion hasn't changed now. For me, Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts is a tired theme dressed up with the fabulous graphics and sound of a superb machine. In my view this will probably be a dream come true if you're an ardent G and G fan, otherwise it's best to be a tad cautious before shelling out the dosh. TIM BOONE V. A bird you wouldn't want to pull... THANKS... ...to Advanced Console Entertainment (071 383 0480) for the loan of the Super Ghouls and Ghosts review cartridge so soon after its release in Japan.

"REVIEW MASTER SYSTEM .99 BY TECMAGIC SHADE esson one in Fantasy Land: don't get on the wrong side of Maletoth. He's the big man around these parts, but he's not a man at all. He's the Beast Lord, a seething mass of evil and master to all manner of slavering monsters. Was it therefore wise to call him farty pants? I think not. Quick as a flash, you're transformed into a beast and dumped in the forest. Naturally, life as an ugly creature isn't a bed of roses ask Frank O'Connor so without pause for breath, you're off in search of a cure. Unfortunately, the only way to transform yourself back to human form is to give old Maletoth a bloody good punch on the bottom. It's not the simplest of cures, and a right pain in the butt, but it's the only answer to your problem so get out there and find him. But watch out Maletoth's wise to your plot and has sent out his very fiercest henchmen to stop you! Aargh! It's a Beastie! It's the Keeper of the Orb! Whilst Shadow Of The Beast on the Master System couldn't hope to achieve the sort of graphic quality managed by the original Amiga version, Tecmagik have nevertheless created an extremely good-looking piece of software. There's parallax scrolling something not seen every day on the 8 bit Sega and a detailed main character who runs, jumps, kicks and punches. You can even see his chest expand as he breathes! Colour could have been used to better effect in places, but that's no great handicap. What is most frustrating is the poor control setup which forces the player to push diagonally. up to jump and we all know how inaccurate the Master System Joypad is! Too many times you'll find yourself jumping when you're trying to attack something and vice versa. Mind you, if you can overcome this difficulty, then Shadow Of The Beast emerges as a perfectly respectable and tough slice of arcade adventure action. PAUL RAND 100 SIX SAVAGE SHADOW STAGES! There's a lot to find and fight in Shadow of the Beast, and a lot of legwork to be done. Six stages make up the land, each guarded by one of Maletoth's fierce end-level monsters. From the Mountains And Forests, make your way to The Underground Ca verns. From there, negotiate the Magic Well then enter the most dangerous areas: Subterranean World, The Graveyard and the ultimate challenge The Beast Lord's Castle! Lucky you're one A Climb down and quickly! tough hombre, eh? "


"K IREVIEW THE haway from the bad monster! Converting Shadow Of The Beast to the Master System is a task and a half. So you have to take your hat off to Tecmagic for giving it a go and coming up with a game which, for the Master System, is visually pretty stunning. Looking very beast-like, our hero sprints impressively across the parallax scrolling background, putting paid to all manner of beasties as only he can. The trouble really starts as you wrestle with the joypad. Initially you'll find it impossible to avoid yourself jumping at just the wrong moment because you accidentally pushed up and everyone knows how easy that is to do! This can be incredibly frustrating at times, and requires a serious amount of practice to play properly. Nevertheless, there's enough here to keep you coming back for more and eventually overcome the awkward control method but I'd recommend giving Beast a once over before deciding whether it's right for you. TIM BOONE HISTORY OF THE BEAST As you probably know, Shadow Of The Beast is a conversion of the Amiga game of the same name, which originally appeared on the Psygnosis label. The most graphically stunning game of its time, Beast was a smash hit even though the gameplay was a bit on the ropey side. For their version (dubbed the Master Mix '92). Tecmagic have tidied up the playability and added a feature not present in Amiga Beast the ability to store objects for use later on in the quest. Pick up that book! UPDATE Shadow Of The Beast is a whisper away from its Megadrive debut. It's also been available on a variety of computer formats for yonks!

"ARCADE ACTION TERMINATOR 2 JUDGMENT DAY TOT! HOT! HOT! The spankiest movie of the moment makes it into the arcades, and CVG is there to give you the full lowdown. Here's Kyle Reese lookalike JAZZA RIGNALL to spill the beans on the movie coin-op. Hasta la vista, baby... f you haven't seen Terminator 2 yet, you're either completely stupid or under 15! The film is astonishing, combining state-of-the art effects and a relentless storyline to create one of the most in tensive, action packed movies ever seen. Ideal fodder for a videogame! Midway are the guys who nabbed the licence, and what they ve, come up with is an Operation Wolf-style game, complete with two Endo Battle Rifles (modelled on the ones in the film) mounted on the front. And guess what you do with those. Yep. blast every bad. die in sight and there are tons of 'em. 1.000.SOOS Las 2.000.00 DIGITISED DELIGHTS Using state-of-the-art digital techniques, Midway have incorpor ated actual film footage and speech into the game. The result is spectacular, with completely recognisable sprites and locations, realistic animation and some awesome effects making this a vis ual and aural spectacular! PLOT TWEAKS A-PLENTY! The game loosely follows the plot of the film, with one or two players joining forces with John Connor, leader of the human re sistance. The object is to first annihilate the machines of Skynel in a battlezone identical to the one at the beginning of T2, then infiltrate Skynet headquarters and finally gain control of the time field generator so that the players can be sent back in time to the present day. Once that is achieved, the players must pro tect Sarah and young John Connor, destroy the Cyberdyne, Labs and finally confront the T-1000 and blow it away 104 "


"TERMINATOR 2 BY MIDWAY MIDWAY. TMAN TERMINATOR 2 JUDGMENT DAY Carola MIDWAY On the one hand I was completely blown away by the incredible graphics and stunning sound, but on the other I was very disappointed to find that all the programmers could do with one of the biggest film tieIns of all time and some of the most amazing arcade graphics technology yet seen was to come up with yet another Operation Wolf style game. The game is challenging (those T-800s and the Endoskeletons take a real hammering, and things get unbelievably hectic later on) but apart from the knockout visuals there's simply nothing new on offer. No amount of (to quote Midway's press release about the game) \"cutting edge advancements in digitised technology, state-of-the-art multi-planar scrolling and holographic-like flashes that float between the screen and the player for innovative realism and neverbefore-achieved depth and dimensionality\" can disguise the fact that this is a four-year-old game format that has been seen and done to death. Once I'd played it a couple of times, the novelty began to wear off and soon I was looking for something a bit more original and interesting to play. Terminator 2 is well worth a couple of credits just to see the graphics, but don't expect it to keep you entertained for long.

"PRE VIEW TECMAGIK Football fever is set to hit Europe next year, when the continent's top International sides come together for the European Championships. And, to celebrate the exploits of the likes of Lineker, Gullit, Klinsmann and Co, TecMagik have signed up the Sega Master System rights to UEFA '92. CVG ball-boy PAUL RAND shares with you hls pre-match vlews and assesses the game's chances of hitting Division One in the Sega sports league. urope's finest soccer stars get together in May next year for a feast of footballing fun. And, like the World Cup two years before it, the European Championship is a prime licensing target for the software industry. This time around it's TecMagik, publishers of Populous and Pacmania on the Master System, who are the lucky people to grab the rights to produce a Sega version of UEFA '92. But there's just one snag: guess which top fooly game has just been released for the 8-bit console? You guessed it Super Kick Off, converted from the Amiga and, unfortunately for TecMagik, it's absolutely brill. So can the West Midland wonders score in the face of such stiff opposition? Although still in an embryonic stage, the bare bones suggest that TecMagik are gunning for Kick Off's title of best soccer game; control of the ball is similar to Anco's smash-hit, as is the top-down view of the pitch. FABULOUS FOOTY FEATURES Once completed, UEFA '92 will contain such mind-boggling features as omni-directional scrolling pitches, a variety of different stadia, intelligent players and even a referee who'll be breathing down your neck whenever you make a dodgy tackle! Other lovely extras which the programmers are hoping to cram in include a training mode, where beginners can go to hone their skills, a choice of 34 European teams and a unique approach to set-piece play! IT'S NOT OVER 'TIL IT'S OVER TecMagik are insisting that UEFA '92 is not going to be a flash-in-the-pan cart. The hope is that, long after the Championship is over, their game will still be selling by the bucketload. That's not to say that they won't be milking the license for everything it's worth; Bernie, the UEFA '92 mascot created by Disney, will feature heavily in the advertising campaign, and you can be sure that this cute little bunny becomes a household name months before the big kick-off. We'll be covering the progress of UEFA '92 from start to finish; watch this space for further info! VERSION SEGA DATE MAY PRICE  34.99 120 "

"PRE VIEW HEIMDALL CORE orget all those ludicrous stories of humans evolving from fish and stuff like that, when everyone knows that the Gods were behind mankind's existence. Take the Viking race, for example. They were created by a bunch of immortals shacked up in Valhalla and Asgard. In the beginning, the Gods thought highly of the Norsemen, visiting them frequently. However, as is often the case, they grew tired of their playthings and reverted to more deity-like fun and frolics, like eating ambrosia. However, one of the Gods, Frey, foresaw that the Vikings would one day be required to come to the assistance of their creators and so he wrote down contingency plans for that time. It was hundreds of years later when the Age Of Ragnarok began. The evil Gods turned on their peace-loving neighbours, stealing three of their weapons and scattering them throughout the Viking worlds. Odin, not best pleased that he had lost his own sword, took a look at Frey's plan and sent Thor to deliver a child to one of the mortals who, when fully-grown, would be able to retrieve the missing weapons. His name? Heimdall. VIKING VARIETY Heimdall is split into two parts an arcade section and the main RPG game. Three tests of skill must be accomplished in order to improve your character's attributes and also to view a higher number of possible comrades for the quest; five Vikings can be selecting from a maximum of thirty. These tests consist of arcade-style games axe-throwing, pig-chasing and longboat-fighting and, as you can see from the screenshots, they're all graphically superb. Not surprising, when you consider that all Heimdall's graphics have been created by an ex-employee of Sullivan Bluth, designers of the Dragon's Lair coin-op and a couple of animated feature films! This high quality of presentation has been carried over into the roleplaying part of the game, to give the player an exquisite-looking, isometric 3D search 'n' bash. So long as Core can ensure that gameplay can match the presentation and an early look at the game suggests they can then Heimdall could be something extra special!

"THE BRAINIES TITUS OK, so what on Earth are the brainies? Well, for a start they're not from this planet. For another thing, they're trouble. Brainies come in four colours, with big feet, cute hands and huge oh-so-lovely eyes. Trouble is they're greedy little so-andsos and now you have to get rid of the little critters before they cause big trouble. More trouble: they only move in certain ways and have level after level to negotiate before you can lead the brainless Brainies happily to the their doom. It all sounds unbelievably Lemmingsish to us, but maybe that's not such a bad thing especially when Titus say there are enough original twists in the Brainies to keep you coming back for more. Further details as soon as... ROBOCOD ELECTRONIC ARTS Vahoo! Megadrive maniacs can rest easy, 'cos one of the best platform games around will be touching down on your console in the not-too-distant future! For those sad thickies who don't know, Robocod is the fol low up to the spiffingly good James Pond and this time round it's got knobs on. You control our hero through screen after screen of multicoloured action, meeting up with some of the cutest critters you'll find outside The Muppets. We reviewed 16-bit Robocod last ish and gave Millenium's fab platform romp-a-rama a stonking great 93 per cent! For sheer playability we reckon it's the tops, with tons to do and acres and acres of screen to explore. But how does it fare on the Megadrive? Well, the CVG boys have already been treated to a sneak preview, and we reckon it's looking just as cool as the computer versions. So keep those peelers superglued to the coolest mag in the world for more news as and when it happens. QOH cu.

"THE CHAOS ENGINE PRE RENEGADE VIEW Lot or wot? Here's an early look at the next blast from the Bitmap Bros, the heroes behind Speedball, Gods, Magic Pockets and all that other great stuff. The Chaos Engine is the name of the game, and it's going to be the Bitmaps first ever romp 'n' shoot ground-based blast hurrah! At first glance the game looks a bit like Mercs to the max, but has a whole host of features which could put it head and shoulders above other games of the type. Basically, Chaos Engine gives you the chance to develop and personalise your menand blow away a fair few alien scumbags all at the same time! Definitely looking a bit swish, Chaos Engine should be a biggie when it hits Amiga, ST and PC early next year.
