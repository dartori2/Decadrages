"UM NEWS KONIX HERE The long-awaited addition to the swelling consoles market has just about arrived. From October, the Konix Multisystem, which could possibly be the best home games machine yet, will be in stores across the nation priced at just over . Paul had a Glancey at the machine... INCREDIBLE SPEC On paper at least, the Konix wipes the floor with every other console, and some of its features even put the wind up powerful 16 bit home computers such as the Amiga and ST. Check out the specifications box below and you'll see that for the price, it's technical specification is outstanding. State of the art custom circuitry put the Multisystem's graphics and sound capabilities beyond even the Amiga. Like the Amiga, the Konix has a Blitter chip which can shift large graphics around the screen at speed, but unlike the Amiga, the Konix hardware can mix sprites and vector graphics with equal ease making it even more flexible from the programmers' point of view. The machine is equally well catered for sonically. The audio hardware provides high quality 25 channel stereo sonics on a par with Yamaha's DX-7 synth! Of course you can listen to the Konix through the TV, or, even better, you can plug headphones or a stereo amplifier straight into the jack socket on the back of the machine. SHAKE, RATTLE AND ROLL What puts the Konix Multisystem even further ahead of the field are its vast range of control options. A microswitched Konix Navigator joystick comes with the package, but even more exciting is the innovative analogue steering controller which can adapt itself to suit three different game types. For burnin' up the highway on a motorbike, the controller can become a pair of handlebars, but twist the ends of the handlebars up and you have a yoke, perfect for flight simulation or Afterburner-style games. You can also clip a plastic steering wheel over the yoke plug in the supplied foot pedals and you have the ultimate driving experiencel For even more realism, the controller has solenoids inside it, giving it the ability to shake in your hands should you drive over rough ground or nose-dive into a runway. However you configure the controller, two independent fire buttons always fall easily under your thumbs and on the right of the console, there's an analogue lever which can double up as a throttle or a gear shift, or indeed anything else Konix programmers can dream up. NOT THE COMFY CHAIR Other hardware add-ons on the horizon include a light gun with recoil action and rapid fire machine gun mode, which will sell for around , and the much heralded Space Harrierstyle hydraulic chair. This luxury item will cost just over , but should be the most fun piece of hardware ever devised for a home system. There are even plans for a plug-in exercise bike for fitnessconscious gamers to ride into the sun-set. Who says computer games are bad for your health? "


"I NEWS Star Ray Logotron's superb Defender variant. AT LAST 23456 Jeff Minter's Attack of the Mutant Camels. THE GAMES With such amazing hardware, many software producers have expressed interest in producing software for the Multisystem. Last month we told you about Llamasoft's superb Attack of the Mutant Camels, and Hammerfist from Visual Image, but Konix are hoping to launch at least 20 titles alongside the machine when it is released. Here we have pictures of Last Ninja ll from System 3 and Star Ray from Logotron two conversions, both of which easily match their home computer counterparts in quality At the moment there's no news of any arcade conversions for the machine strange really, considering its specifications it sounds an ideal machine to convert coin-ops to. Konix software will come on pirateproof 3.5\" 880K disks which just slot GHETER into the built-in drive, as well as cartridge, and will cost between  and . If the Multisystem gets the software support it deserves, it has the potential to be a real world beater. Keep watching the mag we'll be keeping you posted... System 3's Last Ninja 2.

Batman is armed with a baterang and batrope which he can fire at the roof and hoist BE005640 himself up to the next screen, or use to swing across gaps in the 150000 factory floor. He can even fire it and you have one minute to work out which of the ten are deadly through a process of elimination, rather like the old board game, Mastermind. Sort out the poison, and it's time to fly the Batwing. Gotham City carnival is in progress, but little do the onlookers know that the Joker has filled the balloons attached to the floats with nerve gas. Batman knows though, and has to fly the Batwing down the scrolling main street and cut the balloon strings so that the balloons fly harmlessly away. Miss balloons, or run into them and energy is lost. The final confrontation takes place in the Cathedral, which is a similar platform-type game to level one. Again the map is vast, and tracking down the Joker takes time, as well as a little cartography. I'm not going to tell you what you have to do at the end, cos that'll ruin the film if you haven't already seen it. To be honest, Ocean could have produced a mediocre Bat"

It's wise to spread out the black flasks and healing potions. IMPORTANT OBJECTS The Golden Sceptre The Red Arrow The Silver Orb If you present The Red Arrow to King Theoden Rohan at his palace, Edoras will mobilise the Ridden of the Mark. If you present the Silver Orb to Thrandril at his palace, the elves will mobilize. If you present the Golden Scepire to Denethor, Minas Tirth will also mobilise. To present them with these objects, you have to be on the animated level. Click on the person who has the object and click on the provisions icon.

Minas Tirith is the major stronghold and the enemy just keep on pouring in, so it's good to have a lot of troops there. There are also a lot of forces scattered around, so send these forces to help out at other strongholds before the Dark Lord's armies take them.

How about building a power station and connecting all the zones to it, so the lights come on? Obvious.

The Spectrum conversion contains all the elements of the original coin-op, and there's plenty of action for blasting fans to get their teeth into. The ST version boasts similar graphics and playability to the arcade original, and although the action is tough, it's highly addictive and is recommended to shoot 'em up fans. SCORE 538 FURSA LIVES EXTRA LIVES JULIAN RIGNALL omark's latest Tengen conversion offers a new twist on the vertically scrolling shoot 'em up theme. Instead of flying a space ship against the massed army of some exotic alien nation, you take control of a huge blue dragon on a mission to rescue a Princess who has been captured by a big, evil monster. This requires you to fly through eight levels of action and lay waste to anything that gets in your way The landscapes are varied, and range from volcanic ranges through snowscapes to deep valleys. Each one is packed with hordes of flying creatures and mutant foliage which spit fireballs at your dragon. The dragon can defend itself by gobbing fire bolts at anything in the air and blue firebombs earthwards to burn things on the ground. And there are plenty of targets to torch! To help prolong your dragon life, there are also power-up icons to collect. These are released when an egg is firebombed, and the icon inside can give an extra head (up to three). shrink your dragon (makes you a lot harder to hit), give extra shot power, full flame or homing missiles, a temporary shield. earthquake power (destroys all ground objects), extra points or extra lives. A neat collection, really. At the end of each level is (surprise, surprise) a giant guardian who must be destroyed. These range from dinosaurs to maniacal flowers, and put up a UPDATE Amiga, C64 and Amstrad versions will be available soon.

There you are, coming out of Tesco's with your carrier bag full of mixed vegetables, when ZAMM! you're suddenly zooming through a tunnel of light, going baaaack through time. \"Panic not, humanling, for ye are the chosen one.\" croons an eerie god-like voice. \"Only ye can defeat the evil deity, Dameron, who is making our lives a misery in ancient times. And if we, the benevolent gods, are not around to keep the human race going in the past. ye and thy race won't even exist in the future, let me tell ye.\" A Dodge the Chimera's fireballs! A A squad of skeletons from the Specum BY SYSTEM 3 PBB 74 when you meet the megabeast which requires some special tactic to kill. Anyone familiar with ancient mythology or even Ray Harryhausen movies will know how to deal with them, but they usually require a certain object from earlier on in the game. For instance, killing the manyheaded Hydra has to be done Perseus-style, by somehow hacking off the Gorgon's head and using it to turn the Hydra to stone. There's magic in the air! 827 Hai-YA! A skellie gets it in the neck. With a strange \"woo-eeee000\" sound echoing in your ears, you appear in a scrolling cave of rocky platforms. A quick jog and jump is all it takes to find that this cave isn't just any old scrolling cave full of rocky platforms. Sword-wielding skeletons patrol the ledges, and from roosts in the roof, fiendish harpies swoop down, talons bared. Your only defence is your fists, your feet and your cat-like agility, but if you're lucky, thumped monsters leave handy weapons behind for you to collect. Carrying a sword replaces your array of punches and kicks with leaping lunges and savage slashes. Other weapons such as tridents and magic fireballs can be thrown with devastating effects. After dealing death to the Chimera guarding the cave exit, you run outside, straight into a crowd of angry Greeks bearing a striking resemblance to the cast of Jason and the Argonauts. Watch out for the Siren, who lures you towards her then turns into a whopper serpent and gobbles you up. One judicious jab and she disappears. leaving behind a useful amulet At this point I should mention that Myth is nine parts platform beat'em up, and one part adventure.

For example, at the end of the first level you're faced by a walrus-like fish thing which can only be described as a walrus-like fish thing. It spews out big lumps of caviar but nothing much else, and is a little too easy to get rid of. If all this sounds familiar, it is.

"SOUSO BUDGED BY DIE ALIEN SLIME! SMS WERS Mastertronic A fter such a promising title, it was a bit of a disappointment to find that this is actually the slowest Alien Syndrome clone in the known world. In fact that's probably doing Alien Syndrome a disservice, because at least there's more to that game than wandering through an unchanging scrolling maze, shooting dots at blobby aliens. The weapons at your disposal fire really slowly and even the C64 most powerful lasers are little Nice music, but the bland more effective than the initial dot gun.

"EVIEW IIIIIIII JOOOOOOOOD RAINB WARRI TOP ACID RAIN CREW) or TIME 08:S SCORE 30C Dodge the rozzers to stop GREENPEACE BOSH THE EAST Tessel All Mu BY MICROPROSE Vou can't have failed to notice that Britain has recently gone green ozone-friendly hairsprays, lead-free petrol, more votes for the Green Party, even previously ecologically-unsound people joining Greenpeace. Microprose probably come under the latter category, because Rainbow Warrior (\"the Greenpeace game\") is definitely a departure from their range of American Commie-killing battle sims. Microprose hope that they can bring eco-awareness to the masses who would normally switch off at the sight of another Norwegian in an anorak spraying baby harp seals with green paint. The game is split into seven different subgames, each of which deals with a real Greenpeace campaign. Six of the seven can be selected from the opening screen, but you have to finish all of these before you can play the culminating game. In Ocean Dumping, you control a team of eco-commandoes who have to board a ship dumping waste into the sea. Starting in a dinghy your team has to climb on deck, then each stop a crane which is dropping barrels into the ocean. The crew of the ship aren't willing to help out, though, so you have to avoid the hose trained on your dinghy. dodge barrels, and the crew members who throw you overboard if they catch you. Save the Whales is a sort of Breakout game, which puts you in control of a killer whale swimming about under a screen full of bricks. The objective is to completely uncover a picture of whales by blowing bubbles at the bricks to destroy them. Different icons drift across the Bubbles busting bricks is what saves whales. screen, and if you bubble a good one (such as a Greenpeace dinghy) that icon will clear all the blocks it passes over. Hitting, say, a whale steak will cause it to restore blocks until it goes off screen. It's so easy to inadvertently hit the wrong object and suddenly rebuild a load of blocks that this game becomes quite frustrating. The Acid Rain Campaign puts your team of activists at the foot of four chimneys which are spewing sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere. Periodically, a dinghy sails past carrying a banner bearing one of the letters in the words \"STOP ACID RAIN\". You have to collect all the banners and drape them across the top of the chimneys, while dodging a patrolling policeman, a large truck and a spanner-throwing worker.

ROLE CALL Infocom's Journey is a role playing game that initially plays as if it has few difficult puzzles. But it gets harder the further you get. \"Journey is a game of great atmosphere and great text,\" writes Lior Meiry of Haifa in Israel. But Lior is completely lost in the maze that lies just in front of Astrix's tower. \"How do you find your way through?\" asks Lior, \"Is Webba's map useful, or perhaps there is an alternative way to reach Astrix?\" Here's some help from Michael Howes who was stuck in Dungeonmaster a few months ago. \"My bet is that Michael is stuck at the beginning of Level 6, in which case rock is not rock when it is a gem,\" writes John Yeates. John goes on to advise Michael that the door at the bottom of the stairs is almost certainly the one with the star shaped lock, leading to Firestaff, in which case he needs the RA key. Recognise the name? If you've read C+VG for a number of years, you'll remember that John was once renowned in these pages as \"the loony Pimaniac from Jersey\". But John is not as stupid as he used to make out he is just about to start his second year studying Computer Science at Sussex University. \"Does anybody out there know where all the secret rooms are?\" he asks. \"There are loads of things like Speedbow and the special swords, but I can't find all of them.\" PLAYED BUT NOT FORGOTTEN Recently released Deja Vu II Lost In Las Vegas, takes you Krzy V AN DE "


"NTURE BITE THIS through the further adventures of private eye Ace Harding. Waking up in a Las Vegas hotel bathroom with a chronic hangover, you vaguely remember being abducted from Chicago by two of Tony Malone's thugs. It seems he thinks you owe him over $100,000, a sum unaccounted for by Joey Siegel, the racketeer of whose murder you were acquitted in Deja Vu I. You'd better get that dough to Malone in one week, or it's \"or else\" for you. The seven dollars in your pocket won't go far if you're planning a visit to the hotel's casino to get you out of trouble. Still, who knows, there may be ways and means of making it go a bit further... Deja Vu II is the latest of Mindscape's icon-driven adventures. Almost the only words you have to type from the keyboard are ones you actually want to say to a character. Effectively the game is played entirely by mouse, dragging items from window to window to take or drop them, clicking on exits to open or pass through them, or selecting a verb from the word list provided and then clicking on an object to complete the command. There's plenty of animation, particularly at the station. For example you'll see the whole venture fans supplied with train move away from the good quality low-priced titles platform.

"PC ENGINE MACHINES effective when monsters are very close. Fortunately, littering the landscape are stone idols which yield magical weapons and abilities, such as multi-Way fireballs and super leaps when Yaksa runs into them. The effectiveness of each weapon depends on Yaksa's power level, shown as a bar which shrinks as he runs into hostile fire. At the end of each stage, there's a boss monster, for which Yaksa needs all the extra firepower he can muster. At the end of level one, he has to fight a lire-spitting dragon for a good couple of minutes and that's if he's got four-way fireballs! If he's only carrying his sword, forget it. Level two's main monster RUN AWAAAY!! pace Harrier\" is the first thought that crosses your mind when you press the START button on Yaksa. Running over a stripy landscape, blasting monsters that zoom at you from the horizon all familiar stuff. Or so I thought... The star of this show is the eponymous Yaksa, a Japanese Hippy swordsman with the widest pair of bell-bottoms in the province. He can run and leap into, and even out of the screen as he takes on the encroaching hordes of Napalm Ninjas, disembodied Samurai heads, skeletons with sabres, fireballs and winged demons. The sword is a pretty inadequate weapon because it's only A Meet the fire-gobbing demons. is a comparatively easy tentacled blob, but after leaping along level three's mid-air causeway. you have to take on a pair of giant crabs which are even tougher than the dragon! The monsters, both large and small are nicely drawn, but the way they're animated is not so good. Most don't have more than a couple of frames of animation, and only the Yaksa sprite moves around the screen with any semblance of smoothness. To keep the speed of the game up, everything else jerks around the screen so badly that it is difficult to work out where the hell anything is meant to be in time for you to shoot it. Ruining the visual impression (not to mention the gameplay) even further is the very ropey 3D display system, which gives apparently stationary objects like the idols a life of their own. Jumping from platform to platform in level three is a nightmare, because you're often unsure where the next platform is supposed to be! Yaksa has a few redeeming features, such as the level password system and the short-lived soundtracks. But with the odds so heavily stacked against it, not even these can save Yaksa from the kind of mediocrity we don't usually associate with PC Engine games.

"REVIEW IIIIIIIIIIIII IRON LORD UBISOFT = 18 Probably the most frequently previewed game in history, this seems to have been crossing the Channel since the year dot, but no, honestly, it's here at last, for sure. It's a medieval adventurey, arcadey, strategy-y sort of game, in which you, a brave and noble king, come home from a crusade to find your mean uncle has usurped your throne and pinched your cash! The cheek of the fellah! Your job is to find and raise an army then jolly well give him what for! In between cajoling information out of strangers in taverns, you get to take part in some smart arcade sequences, such as an archery contest and an unusual 3D sword fight which gives you a \"through the visor\" view of your opponent as he hacks your limbs off. We've played a not-quite-finished version and reckon Iron Lord has probably been worth the wait. Look out F-29 RETALIenemy jets as they move ATOR downstairs.
