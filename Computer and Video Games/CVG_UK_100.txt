"QUICKSHOT JOY EGOLBYUYULDU S GOL The big boys just get bigger, it seems. Spectravideo, former UK agent for the Quickshot joysticks, have taken two of their previous rivals under their wing, by agreeing to handle the sales and marketing of the Quickjoy label and buying up the rights to the entire Konix range. The Quickjoy acquisition will see the current number of products rise throughout the year to fifteen, while the Konix deal is viewed by some as a way of injecting new cash into the delayed Multisystem project. KATARI Lype L STUNNING LYNX TABLETOP DELIGHTS VIDEO DRIVIN' At the end of January, Atari announced the date of the official UK launch of the hand-held Lynx console at the Earls Court Toy Fair. Expect to see the Lynx in High Street shops from this May, priced at .99, with software coming in at .99 per cartridge. The package will include California Games, a cable to connect two machines together for multiple player games, and a mains adaptor. The Lynx got a further shot in the arm with the announcement that Atari's coin-op arm, Tengen, has already begun developing Lynx versions of Hard Drivin'. STUN Runner and Cyberball. And if you think that's exciting. Tengen have also said that they'll even be making improvements over the original arcade games, wherever possible. Makes yer mouth positively water, don't it! Almost too late to include in this issue. what should arrive at the eleventh hour but these tabletop Out Run and Afterburner machines, made by Grandstand. They're both very big (Afterburner stands at over 10 inches high!) and each impressive pack contains a sheet of stickers to attach to the case. Once you've pressed the start button though, all admiration shifts from the machine itself and diverts to the game. LCD screens portray the respective driving and flying coin-op action as accurately as possible! The games are expensive at upwards of forty quid apiece, but they're both addictive (Afterburner being far and away the best of the two) and will keep younger members of the family quiet for some time. Just like the arcade? Not quite. You may have seen this gadget in your mum's catalogue it's called the Video Driver, and it's an attempt by Sega to break into the fledgling interactive VCR-gaming market Shaped like a car dashboard, with steering wheel and a little plastic car attached to the front, the player drives along a vehicleinfested road which is stored on cassette. The idea is to dodge the other cars on the road you start with 100 points and your score decreases if you \"hit\" another driver or the side of the road. Although the cassette is only around 7-8 minutes long, and response time is a little sluggish, the game is fun for a while, especially so for the younger gamer, and certainly paves the way for more complex interactive games in the future. The Video Driver pack costs between  and  (depending on where you buy it) including the California Chase tape. and two other cassettes. Grand Prix Racing and Police Chase are also available at around a tenner. HANDHELD SEGA!

IIIIII AMIGA .99 Every aspect of Dragon's Breath has been superbly designed, from general points like the difficulty level (the computer opponents make formidable challengers) down to little things such as the different faces of traders who come to sell items. However, the most rewarding aspect is undoubtedly the spell-casting. This system draws you right to the heart of alchemy and spell creation it's so good that if you're not happy with one spell you can create another yourself (as long as you're aware of the side effects). Once you've mastered the art (and you have to, to win), you can explore all the other subtieties, such as raising and training dragons, occupying villages, searching for talisman fragments: there are so many actions you can perform that no game is ever completely the same. On top of this the graphics are excellent and the stereo sound effects and music superb! Dragon's Breath has to be one of the most original games for some time, and if you like your action heavily dosed with strategy, go for it. The only criticism I have is there are too few arcade-style sequences: a couple more would have made it a classic.

"THE There are two celebrations this month the 100th issue of C+VG, and US Gold's 5th birthday! And in way of celebra tion, we've both got together to bring you this massive mega comp! On the front of the issue, you must have noticed by now, is your own personal Megacomp Number. This month and next month we re printing winning numbers inside the issue. If your Megacomp Number matches one of those inside the mag. you're a winner! The catch is that the numbers are in code! To get the real winning number you've got to crack the code by using the special code cracking formula. It's pretty easy, so just read on and follow the instructions. HOW TO CRACK THE CODE irst of all grab a pencil and some paper and a calculator if you don't think your brain can cope with some simple addi tion sums. Now, write the following numbers across the top of the paper drawing a line down the page between each one: 1 248 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 Now you've got your Code Cracker! To convert the code num. ber to a proper number, enter the code number underneath it, putting one number in each column like the example below. Then all you've got to do is add together the numbers that have a 1 underneath them and the proper number is revealed! Now you can see whether it matches your personal Megacomp Number. Still confused? Well, let's take an example. We're using the first T-shirt number: You put the code in like this... 1 2/481632 64 128 25651210242048 4096|819216384 32768 | 65536/131072 Now add up those numbers with 1 under them, so that's 2+16+128+2048+16384+131072 And that equals... er... 149650.

During the game your character begins to feel hungry, with the level of hunger represented by a \"starvometer\" bar.

"EVIEW WMIZ MANHUNTER ME BY ACTIVISION ierra's Manhunter series is quite different from any other Sierra adventures. The storylines are bizarre, the mode of play is bizarre, and Manhunter San Francisco, the second in the series, is no less bizarre than its forerunner. The alien Orbs that terrorised New York have now spread to San Francisco. Humans must wear hooded robes, and may not speak to one another on pain of death, Certain individuals, equipped with a tracking device from the Orbs, have been selected as Manhunters, people who track down those who have acted illegally according to the Orbs' laws. After fleeing New York in an alien ship, you crash land in San Francisco. Stealing a dead Manhunter's tracker. you set off on his original trail. The tracker follows the subject to a bank, a warehouse, a ferry building, and finally to a fountain, where the trail goes cold. Dead end, it seems. But there's other people involved, and these, too, must be tracked... Playing the game involves no text input at all. Everything is controlled by cursor keys, joystick, or mouse and options accessed from pulldown menus. In the midst of all this are embedded a number of quite tricky arcade sequences, which add to the unusual nature of the game. Uh oh... This looks like trouble. VIIIIIIIII ST The future of San Francisco urban squalor at it's dismalest. LOYAL SERUANT OF THE OORBALLIANCE O Peter Grown .99 Whilst adventure players are not usually averse to a spot of arcading from time to time, I doubt that they like the two formats mixed and that's the trouble with Manhunter II. Progress through the story is too often brought to a grinding halt, frustrating the main objective of what is primarily an adventure game. If you enjoyed Manhunter I, or you enjoy an adventure that's a bit arcadey whilst not being an arcade adventure, you should enjoy Manhunter San FranciSCO. Personally, I prefer the more orthodox Sierra adventures. KEITH CAMPBELL Press ENTER> to put the ID Card in your robe A This card should get you in anywhere. UPDATE Manhunter San Francisco is also out on the PC and Amiga and is, to all intents and purposes, identical on all formats. So the same criticisms should apply check 'em out if you liked the original. GRAPHICS 61% SOUND 49% VALUE 60% PLAYABILITY 64% OVERALL 61% "

Playing the last surviving member of a team of space commandos, you must battle through an alien-infested colony, destroying anything that gets in your way. And there's plenty getting in your way, with a massive variety of revolting, slimy aliens popping up from all angles.

"NINTENDO MACHINES HA There are an awful lot of basketball games coming out on consoles lately, and here's one for the Nintendo. A conversion of Konami's Basket Master coin-op, one or two players compete against the machine or each other respectively across the four American cities of New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. Each match is played through four quarters, using normal basketball rules to slam-dunk the opposition out of the league and push your team a notch closer toward the championships. As well as three skill levels, there is also the option to vary the length of each tournament between 20, 40, 80 and 120 minutes. A chatty referee blurts out the odd phrase every now and again, and there's even a spot of light entertainment at halftime, when those lurvely, allAmerican cheerleaders come on and do what all-American cheerleaders do best-look bimboesque and wave fluffy balls around. BY KONAMI MIIIIIIII NINTENDO .99 Double Dribble is a really rather good conversion of the coin-op, with a lot of sensible front-end options allowing you to alter the gameplay to suit your ability. Once you've got past the jolly screen showing spectators pouring into the stadium, the real task of beating the opposition begins, and what fun it is, too. Player sprites are smashing, much more lifelike than the squat, cartoony figures seen on a lot of similar games recently, and the ball travels most favourably. Unfortunately, there isn't a shadow underneath the ball, and to begin with, placing your man correctly is a hit-and-miss affair, but with practice it isn't too difficult. Sound is a bit of a letdown; the speech is fine as are the, albeit short, tunes, but effects are practically non-existent. Two-player mode is recommended to get the most out of Double Dribble, but if you have no brothers, sisters or friends, one-player can have loads of fun playing this more than pleasing basketball sim.

Difference of opinion between me and the rest of the folks on this one. I don't like it; the rest of them do. It certainly looks very jolly, even though there's little variation from level to level. And it's very difficult too: perhaps that's why I couldn't get worked up and come out in a hot flush about Robo Warrior what some people would call a challenge I would term a frustratingly hard game. The \"challenge\" overcame me at a very early stage, and I quickly found myself getting rather bored with blowing up maze walls and ending up being destroyed by my own bombs. Perhaps the best advice I can give is have a go of Robo Warrior before you dig deep into your wallet it may grab you by the necessities and not let go: then again. it might squeeze just a bit too tightly.

I IIIIIIIII PC ENGINE .90 After finding Megadrive Super Shinobi to be a drastically revised version of the coin-op, I expected the Engine's \"Ordinary\" Shinobi to be a pixel-perfect copy. I was surprised to find that the conversion bore a couple of differences which might disappoint fans of the original, the inexplic. able lack of the 3D \"Shuriken the Ninjas\" end-of-level bonus game being one. However, the gameplay doesn't really miss them, so players new to the game should find it an enjoyable and challenging test of reactions. Strangely enough, though, I think that in spite of its cast of Ninja types, beat 'em up fans might be a tad disappointed with Shinobi because the dependence on shurikens for killing the enemy makes the game play more like a Rolling Thunder-style shoot 'em up than a chopsocky fighting game.
