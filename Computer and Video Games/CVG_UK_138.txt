This month, as described on pages 26-27 in the CVG Celebrity Challenge, Paul was completely stuffed at Mohammed Ali Boxing by none other than the current WBC Super Middle Weight World Champion, Nigel Benn. Although Paul put himself up for the fight ahead of Steve Keen because 'He's only got a black belt in Judo and I'm a hard Northern git who knows the game inside out', Rand still managed to loose because he chose the crappiest player to 'Give the World Champion a bit of a chance!'. After his defeat, CVG's Deputy Editor was ever the sportsman and told Nigel, \"You wait until I tell my mate Chris Eubank\".

"MEET THE CVG CREW: GARTH ANGLIN IS GETTING THERE Paul Anglin was an arresting sight this month when he forgot his monthly travelcard. Mr. Dozy, whose early morning commuting ritual does not at any point include waking up, managed to get all of the thirty miles into work before he was rudely awakened to the fact that he'd forgotten his monthly  ticket! Undaunted, Captain Honesty went back to find the Station Manager to explain his predicament. The Fat Controller listened, nodded dutifully and smiled as Paul's sad tale of woe unfolded and then reassuringly laid a hand on his shoulder the miserable git then slapped a heaving  fine on him! Paul Anglin faces up to his heinous crime.. This month's seen poor Garth working until the wee hours on the new look CVG. He hasn't even had time to shave and looks a little like Grizzly Adams; but he'll be back to normal next issue (although he's threatening to turn his beard into a goatee!). GAMES OF THE MONTH: X WING (PC) FLASHBACK (MD) PAUL Mr. Rand has cheered up considerably in the last few weeks. He's currently being nice to everyone (even Paul Anglin!), spending less time in the pub (gasp!), and has even asked Steve Keen if he can borrow some of his rock music! We think he's found a girlfriend, but Anglin reckons that's impossible! GAMES OF THE MONTH: X WING (PC) FLASHBACK (MD) STEVE KEEN IN LIBERTY SHOCK JON Jon's well pleased this month. A big car magazine is about to relocate next to his house. This means they'll be parking Ferraris and the like outside his door, making all the girlies that go by forget that he actually owns a sad VW and believe that, in fact, he's quite a good catch after all! GAME OF THE MONTH: X WING (PC) Steve Keen and his friend had a bit of a run-in at a local French restaurant last week when they were refused their late night nosh-up because they were \"improperly dressed.\" Steve was mortified as he'd wom his least grungey 'heavy metal bikers from hell' T shirt and he decided that it must've been his rock babe partner's leggings that caused offense. Unfortunately the dressed to-slaughter-duo had to resolve themselves to going back to Steve's flat to practice some late-night kicking and punching at Streetfighter 2! Steve Keen is 24, unmarried and has no children (unsurprisingly enough!) but he did beat her using E. Honda and came first at Mario Kart! GARY COCCOQCC The new kid on the block is formerly The One Deputy Editor and a veritable expert on Amiga games. He's kept a very small profile at most computer games shows, unless you saw him sideways on, waddling around the Games Master Live show in Birmingham? GAMES OF THE MONTH: FLASHBACK (MD) BRAWL BROTHERS (SNES) CCCCCCCC JENNY Jenny's another down in the dumpster crew member. She's recently been ripped off by one of those unscrupulous holiday companies, who phoned her up and said she'd won a cruise. She lost a ton of cash and the company wouldn't give it back until our bighearted, former 19 stone, Managing Editor wrote them a letter and they paid up sharpish! Wouldn't you?! GAME OF THE MONTH: CYBORG JUSTICE (MD) STEVE Steve's as well known as Princess Diana at a photographers' convention for his literary turn of phase. His copy's got more twists and turns than a Cow's digestive system. What comes out the other end however, is high pressure, heavily processed and near steaming! His spooling's crap though. GAMES OF THE MONTH: FLASHBACK (MD NIGHT TRAP (Mega CD) Steve Keen shows that he's got his finger on the pulse! BEWARE OF THE HAIR: ANGLIN Paul's a Canvey Island lad. He springs out the door at six o'clock to catch the last boat home. However, one night he missed the last ferry. After nearly two hours on the shore in pitch darkness, his old granny appeared through the darkness in a canoe to pick him up! Thanks to her the marooned monkey still made it home in time for Cagney and Lacey! GAME OF THE MONTH: AIR ZONK (PC Engine GT) Never one to take advice from strangers, Garth was approached by a travelling salesman at Leather Lane Market, who claimed to have an instant cure for the bedraggled editors' split ends! For those of you who don't know, split ends are the scourge of anyone who wants to grow dreamy long girlie hair, so the old hippy jumped at the chance, buying five bottles on the spot! Rushing home to his Nunhead based babe lair, Garth dampened down his mop and smothered half a bottle of the stinky goo straight onto his bonce! He should have been more cautious. The label clearly states \"Use in moderation!'. Apparently a single drop of the liquid can re-hair every single Harry Krishna that's ever lived and still have enough left over to re-carpet the Yul Brinner Fan Club! You can check out what happened to Garth in this picture! So be warned; don't mess with your mop or you could end up a fop! SUURI CARE STEVE Our Managing Editor's a bit of a culture vulture, but that's not to say he doesn't enjoy a bit of tack on the side. All month he's been going on about his forthcoming culture trip to Spain for sun, sand, sea, opera, Sangria and poetry! So where's he off to? 'Benidorm, of course,' he unashamedly replies, there's more English culture there than in my street any day! GAME OF THE MONTH: ROAD AVENGER (MCD) "


"TEWSN ow it's official! Mega CD on sale... STARFOX dumped but don't put your fingers in the light socket yet... Nipponese console costs lotsa wonga... Street Fighter comic and Lemmings record! MEGA CD LAUNCHES! O SEGA O 071 727 8070 MIEZA Well, here it is the Mega CD in all its in-a-boxand-now-completely-official glory. Sorry about the dark piccy, though. Sega took it, not us. f all's gone well, Sega's super-hyped Mega CD system should finally be officially available in the shops along with a lorryload of games to ensure that new owners just can't get bored in a hurry. 70,000 Mega CDs were shipped into stores around Britain on April 2nd, which makes the UK the first country in Europe to get the system. The Mega CD, which bolts onto the bottom of any Megadrive, costs .99 and comes packaged with three discs. The first double-disc pack includes the shoot'em-ups Sol-Feace and Cobra Command, while the third CD is a compilation of five existing Megadrive favourites Columns, Super Monaco GP, Streets of Rage, Golden Axe and Revenge of Shinobi. QUICK NOTES Core Design's Jaguar XJ220. How good will it be on Mega CD? O HOT NEWS on Street Fighter 3! Yes, it's definitely happening, but only two of SFll's characters, Ryu and Sagat, will survive into the third installment. That means there'll be no less than 14 all-new characters, including Chun-Li's younger sister and a new overall baddy called Shadow-Lu, who was Bison's teacher, apparently. Characters will all have FIVE special moves each, and look out for Sagat's new Helicopter Kick, which he's been practising on. More info soon... By down ravines and blow talogs up in the notterbly lavable nelicopros \"sim cobra Command. Strange robot beat'em-up antics in Black Hole Assault. MORE GAMES are being lined up for the launch of the super-wonderful 3DO system later this year the latest news to reach us is that Interplay will be producing a version of its ever-popular Battle Chess for the revolutionary multimedia machine. It's being written as we speak right here in the UK by Krisalis, one of the only British companies to have a 3DO development kit... SKY TV is cock-a-hoop about the instant success of its new daily Games World show. Apparently the show, within two weeks of its launch, has already achieved Sky One's highest ever weekday ratings mind you, if all it has to contend with is the likes of Family Ties and TJ Hooker, we're not surprised. Only Sunday's flagship The Simpsons pulls in more viewers, and we can see why... Can the Mega CD's capabilities make Prince of Persia even better? \"Every month I'll be serving up a top-hole selection of trivial titbits from the totally bonkers world of computer and video gamIing with which you can I astound and confound Iyour chums unless | they read CVG as well, I (and let's face it they I probably do, so that's i that one up the spout). Never mind, let us press on.\" AFTER THE AMAZING chart success of Alien Breed: Special Edition 92, Team 17 is to remix another of its Amiga classics for budget re-release. This time it's Project-X that gets the treatment -and we're told that it will be made easier for all those who complained about it being too tough, and should be out before Summer at a very reasonable .99... Wolfchild from Core average on 16-bit computers, but promising more on Mega CD. CODEMASTERS has picked up official approval from Sega for its Megadrive-publishing antics, which means that the first game, Micro Machines (already a big hit on NES) will be out for the MD soon...

"FM TOWNS CONSOLE! | NO FOX PLEASE WE'RE BRITISH STREET FIGHTER II THE COMIC STREET FIGHER NINTENDO U.K. ENTERTAINMENT 0329 822 565 Starfox is never to be released in Britain... the incredible FM Towns will soon be available to anyone with  in their pocket! The new FM Towns Marty CD console from Fujitsu packs technology from the towering PC-lookalike into a box no bigger than a Megadrive! It takes CDs and floppies, has a 32-bit 386 processor (meaning it's excellent for both console and PC-style games) AND plugs into any normal TV! On sale in Japan, it's bound to trickle through to the UK on grey import later this year, though it might never be officially released in this country. \"It's spritetastic,\" reckons a technical expert. \"The only thing in the same league is the 3DO.\" on't run off to slash your wrists just yet. Yes, the brilliant Super FX chip shoot'em-up IS coming out, it's just that Nintendo has decided to change the name to the less cutesy and slightly harder Starwing. So when you rush down to the software emporium to buy the 96%rated classic, you know what to ask for. Okay? (Oh, and to find out more about the year's hottest SNES game, flick to page 107 for our topnotch feature). treet Fighter II has already topped the coin-op and console worlds, there's a live-action movie in production and now the official comic book has arrived!

The project was scrapped when the film turned out to be a stinker performing poorly at the box-office... emming-mania is set to continue when a single, based around the Lemmings 2 music, is released on May 10. The band responsible includes the producers of The KLF's chart-toppers! \"This is not a crap record like that horrible Tetris thing or the putrid Super Mario record,\" Psygnosis claims. Lemmings soon to be on your turntable HEW! In case you didn't know, that was us sounding totally amazed by the amount of old full-price games being re-released on budget every month. Unfortunately, we're far too busy reviewing new games to rate them all, and you probably remember them from the first time round anyway. So, we're content to simply let you know which titles will be returning to your local software shop at a more pocket-friendly price each month, and leave the rest up to you.

"INTENDO owners used to have it all to themselves, but now US Gold is levelling the score by bringing Star Wars to Sega formats but Megadrive owners face an agonising wait... STAR WARS GOES SEGA! The biggest news for Sega fans this month is that the Nintendo versions of Star Wars are coming to their machines but if you're a Megadrive owner, you'll have to wait and see if you get to join in the fun. US Gold is producing Star Wars for the Master System here in the UK, while LucasArts in the USA is converting Super Star Wars from the SNES for the Mega CD. But what about the Megadrive version? Well, there's a nasty rumour going round that there may not be one at all, but don't panic just yet, because so far, it's only a rumour. US Gold has given the job of bringing Star Wars to the Master System to Tiertex (the team behind Strider), who Graphics that are almost as sexy as Han Solo's turbo nutter, race proven Millennium Falcon GTi, would certainly be possible on a Mega CD version of Star Wars...

SONIC gets his own comic, and KEVIN KEEGAN is the latest star to lend his name to a football game... ELECTRONIC MODELLING MORE COMICS REVELLO 081 207 1213 0 SUPER NES CHART new joint venture between Sega and 2000AD publisher Fleetway, means Sonic fans will have their own comic next month! The bi-monthly mag, Sonic, will run regular stories starring Sega game heroes Shinobi, f you're a model-making fan, you'll be overjoyed to hear that getting your fingers stuck together and stinking of polystyrene glue are a thing of the past! Well, maybe not, but model giants Revell have got a new product that makes it easier. Motor Stars is the first in a line of titles for Amiga and PC CD-ROM systems that gives modellers assembly tips using graphics and animation; it's like a cross between a Blue Peter \"here's one we made earlier\" demonstration and a driving game with four tracks! Choose between a Bugatti EB110, Porsche 911 Slant Nose, BMW Nazca M12 and the Lambourghini LP500S — and then modify the car for weather and road conditions. They've even included a live-action video sequence featuring a gorgeous, pouting and rather tasty looking bit of crumpet for the lucky race winner! Motor Stars is due out early this Autumn, and in the meantime Revell has plans for two more \"games\", one featuring American street cars and the other based around high-tech combat aircraft. 1. SUPER MARIO KART (Nintendo) 2. ANOTHER WORLD (Interplay) 3. PRINCE OF PERSIA (Broderbund) 4. AXELAY (Konami) 5. SUPER GHOULS'N' GHOSTS (Capcom) 6. PILOTWINGS (Nintendo) 7.

SHIELDS 8 = LEADER TEAM LUKE = N You can expect to see Star Wars out on Master System before Summer, but the fate of the Megadrive version still hangs in the balance... PERCENT COMPLETE 055 DO are basically converting the platform action and shoot'em-up frolics from the NES version lock, stock and barrel. From what we've seen so far, it promises to be a very faithful conversion, which is hardly surprising as the Master System can do just about anything the NES can. There's no news yet of a Game Gear version, but if the Master System is being done, it's a good bet the GG is too. So what's all this about no Megadrive version, then? Have US Gold gone potty or what? Unfortunately we weren't able to tell if the company is in fact mad and should be committed to the loony bin, because the 16-bit situation is all upside down and back to front at the moment. The rumour we're hearing, however, is that LucasArts, who HAVE been developing a Megadrive version which is now almost finished, may have decided to axe the project and transfer all the work done on it onto the Mega CD, which is better equipped to do the stunning graphic effects found in the SNES original. This is all totally unconfirmed at the moment, but we'll be bringing you more definite news next month. One thing's for sure US Gold would have to be totally out of their trees and out dancing with the pixies and fairies to not publish a Megadrive version. DEL LLLLLLL -L!!! -les bonbon Two when IT'S KONSOLE KEEGAN!

Basically, Player Manager is like Kick Off with all the normal managerial bits included within it. The original Player Manager is definitely getting on a bit especially on Amiga where it seems as though it's been around for longer than Bobby Charlton, (it's actually knocking on for two years old now), but we're promised that the new version, which will be out on all the big formats, is promised to be infinitely better. That's despite Kevin Keegan's name being linked to it, we imagine. PLACE YOUR BETS! With both the Premier League and FA Cup tournaments drawing to a close (and, incidentally, at a time when there seem to be more football games on the market than ever before), we thought we'd find out how much the creators of the top soccer games know about the real thing by asking them to predict | this season's champions. Ho, what larks! \"I think Man Utd will win the League, unfortunately, because I'm an Evertonian, but they're the stronger side. Villa will fade away, and I don't think Norwich have the stamina.

"NEWS A RNIE kicks ass on Mega CD... STAR TREK gets signed up for another eight years... SONIC rubs shoulders with Alain Prost, and CHRIS EVANS skips breakfast to play Sleepwalker and it's all for charity! TERMINATOR ON MEGA CD! From what we've seen so far, Mega CD Terminator could be the most faithful conversion of the film to date. The ravaged killing fields of 2029 look the absolute BUSINESS on Mega CDmuch better than the Megadrive original, anyway. The Mega CD's top technology allows for plenty of smart graphical effects, not to mention filmquality music. KNOW HMV-KNOW GAMES re you sick of The Terminator yet? We certainly hope not, because it's about to be released on yet another home format the Mega CD! The Super NES conversion of the classic movie is reviewed this month, but we're reliably informed that the new MCD version, currently being programmed by Virgin Games in the USA, is the best of the lot! It's a ten-level shoot'em up extravaganza with stunning character animation produced using the same liveaction Rotoscoping techniques employed by Delphine Software in this month's HIT!, Flashback. The game also has a mindblowing cinematic soundtrack taken direct from the film well, if any machine can deliver the goods in the sound department, it's the Mega CD. The Terminator has a June release date penned in for the US. A UK launch date hasn't been set, but you should be able to get it on import in the Summer. And of course, we'll bring you the full review first! NES Arnie lookalikes abound in Mega CD Terminator! DOMINIK IN CELEBRITY SHOCKER! orgeous, pouting Gamesmaster host Dominik Diamond has been rubbing shoulders with Chris Evans, the gorgeous pouting host of The Big Breakfast! They joined forces to promote Ocean's Comic Relief Sleepwalker game, hence the false noses (yes, they actually are false). Both celebs have their own shows on Channel 4, so we're sure their meeting didn't pass without one of them making a snidey comment about who has the most viewers. In fact, Dominik just about wins, with 3.2 million fans next to TBB's 1.7m but then Chris' show is on really early in the morning AND he's on every day, so it probably works out about the same. Anyway, we think Chris is the best out of the two, so there. Mind you, we've never had a top night out with Chris, and Dom always sees his round. 1. DIZZY (Codemasters) 2. GAUNTLET (Mindscape) 3.

"IT'S A LICENSE JIM BUT NOT AS WE KNOW IT QUICK NOTES O INTERPLAY 0865 390 029 THE GOOD NEWS FOR X-MEN fans this month is that Marvel Comics has given its approval to Sega's in-development conversion of the top-rated comic book. It's due out before the summer... Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the USS looks quizzical (as usual) after realising that he's going to be boldly going for another eight years WORD REACHES US that a UK software house has bought the game rights to Dragon, this summer's big movie all about the life of kung fu star Bruce Lee, and is currently producing the game for the SNES. Lots of top secret business prevents us from revealing more at this stage, but we're already licking our lips at the prospect of an official Bruce Lee beat' em up These are the voyages of the Starship Interplay, her eight-year mission, to seek out new Star Trek games and publish them. To boldly go where no software house has gone before...

They've already had a big hit with Star Trek: The 25th Anniversary on the PC, which is soon to be followed by an Amiga version. Following that, two more adventures are planned, along with a serie of action-based games to appear on floppy formats. Console fans needn't feel left out, as there's also a Super NES game in production for release next year.

Ladieeees and Gentlemen, Mr Nigel Benn.. Roll up, fight fans have we got a treat in store for you or what! Forget Witherspoon vs Tyson! Pass over Holmes vs Leonard! And you can even cast the momentous Holyfield vs Bowe epic from your minds! CVG has gone for the biggest fighting challenge since Gary Whitta refused to give up his seat for burly Barry Bruiser, the local extremely hard person. That's right, our very own demon deputy, Paul 'The Light Fantastic' Rand, nearly jumped out of his Sid The Sexist boxer shorts at the chance of trading blows with the one and only Dark Destroyer, Nigel Benn. Call him foolish, call him as thick as a bowl of Mrs Miggins' special cement porridge, but don't call our lad Rand chicken, 'cos this boy is as tough as six-inch nails! Don't believe us? Then gather round, pick up your popcorn and take your ringside seats at the all-new CVG Celebrity Challenge! NAME: PAUL RAND AGE: 21 (Going on 48! Paul Anglin), HEIGHT: 6'1\" WEIGHT: 12 st 12lbs REACH: Unobtainable due to the fact that Paul's arms are permanently at 45 degree angles to his mouth! PRE-MATCH TRAINING: A daily diet of Doner kebabs, followed by a strict intake of half-a-dozen bottles of Newcastle Brown Ale. Paul had several early nights this year, and got plenty of rest by being under the duvet by 2.30 am. Paul doesn't believe in physical exercise, although last week he did bend over in the City Pride hostelry to pick up a two pence piece which he needed to buy a packet of pork scratchings! PREVIOUS FIGHT EXPERIENCE: A 35 second scrap with Billy 'No Balls' Murphy behind the bike sheds at primary school. Rand proudly states that he can handle himself against any four-year olds that you care to mention. MATCH PREDICTION: I'll be damn lucky to get out with all my very personal belongings in one piece!

MATCH PREDICTION: T'll duck, I'll weave, but above all I'll knock him on his ass! BOXER CHARACTER: Muhammad Ali 26 "


"We couldn't ask our Rand to physically go toe-to-toe with Mr Benn, or Sir as we now call him,Well we could, but we wanted him back in one piece! So it was down to the lads at Virgin, who acted as promoters for this epic scrap, which took place on their excellent Megadrive sim, Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing. Nigel's become a bit of a games addict and didn't quite realise what he was getting himself into. He recently went into a shop and scooped up all the games he fancied and was nearly flattened by the sales girl at the checkout when she asked him for 500 quid!!!! SECONDS AWAY To his credit, Paul was battling away like a beaver on steroids, but he just couldn't make any mark on the armour-plated Ali. By now, Bruno was sporting a beautiful shiner as Ali dropped down low for some punishing body shots. Seriously down on energy, it was only a question of time before Bruno was felled again. Nigel was obviously new to the game as he couldn't understand how Paul kept managing to get up, but by hammering away on the buttons, Mutha! Did you bring the spare undies?! get up he did! IT'S FIGHT NIGHT THE WEIGH-IN! The two brawlers chose their main men, Nigel jumping straight in first and picking the number one fighter, Muhammad Ali, leaving Paul at an immediate disadvantage. However, rather sportingly, if not egotistically, Paul didn't opt for the second seed character, Tommy Don't get too close, if you know what's good Hammer, but went instead to for the sad, out of condition and seriously flawed Franko Bruno. Paul obviously thought that Nigel, although awesome in the ring, wouldn't stand a thimble's chance against a strawberry blond CVG North-Eastern monster with seven years worth of gamesplaying experience like himself! What a sad and misguided get he really is! YOU'RE OUT It was make-or-break for Paul. Cracking Ali in the mush, Bruno was actually beginning to make a mark on the invincible Ali, but Nigel's incredible stats saved him once more and in the end all Paul Victory for Benn and Rand refuses to face did was tire himself the fact that he's been rolled! out. Weak on his feet, the last thing Paul needed was a blinding hook-uppercut combination from Benn, but that's exactly what the Destroyer dished out and Bruno hit the canvas like a lead coffin thrown from a 30 storey building! Tough luck Paul, but the boy done very well considering his character's ultra-sad stats. 'Now, let me be Ali,' requested the ever optimistic Rand. 'Er, I've suddenly come over all tired, replied Benn 'ls that the time? See yah!' SECONDS OUT ROUND ONE! Paul stormed out of his corner and jabbed ferociously at his target in an attempt to whittle away Ali's superior stamina and energy bars. Nigel's experience immediately came to the foreplaying it cool, he refused to get suckered in by Randy's tactics. Instead, Benn hung back until Bruno's energy bar was way down low and then leapt in with a thumping hook-jab combination, catching Paul completely by surprise and sending him flying onto the canvas! Shaken Rand leap to his feet though, and managed to hang on until the Let the games begin! end-of-round bell. YOU THINK YOU COULD DO BETTER? Now's your chance to prove it!

"QUESTION op of the morning to you all! So what do you think of the new-look issue then? Great, isn't it? Well, new-look all-singing and ass-kicking or not, Question Corner is certainly doing the business this month. You've sent me a hernia's worth of gaming problems, and it seems as though everyone out there is playing nothing but RPGs, especially Monkey Island 1 and 2. How about some games with a little more life in them? I mean come on, give me something half decent to play on Wednesday mornings will you? How do you expect me to be happy and jolly, when all I get to do is play boring RPGs. When your consciences start getting the better of you send all your problems to: HONEST ANGLIN'S QUESTION CORNER, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON. ECIR 3AU. Exactly how do I beat King Arthur on Quackshot the Megadrive version? Patrick Giggs, Newmarket. l'll say this only once; I have tried and tried and tried. but I cannot get past level 13 of Humans. It's a right *?@*I$ to be honest, and I need help before I go mad! Steven Wright, Witham, Essex. King Arthur, eh? Simple: Turn left and shoot a plunger at the wall. Stand on this and wait a while before shooting a second. Stand on the second one, turn right then duck and shoot at Arthur. Keep shooting even as he throws his sword at you. When the sword is coming your way, keep shooting the plungers and one will land in his face. Then, dodge the blocks falling from the ceiling, run to the far right and repeat the process eleven times. And he's dead! I've had about nine million letters about level 13 this month. Now you can just settle down and indulge in the complete solution to Humans level 13: Pass the spear backwards and forwards across the chasm to bring the four humans across. Stack one human to get to the platform at the foot of the ladder. Climb the ladder and pick up the spear on the platform guarded by the dinosaur. You'll have to time it very carefully to avoid the dinosaur.  Throw the spear to kill the Dinosaur then vault across the bridge using the spear, leaving the bridge intact. This acts as a safety net when dropping the torch from the upper platform. Whoever crossed the bridge must now throw the spear up onto the upper platform. It is critical when doing this that you place your human on top of the rise at the end of the bridge. Now make your human lean back as far as possible, (see manual under \"throwing the spear\") and using full power, throw the spear on to the higher platform. Now select the lonely Human at the top right of the level and guide him down the ladder to collect the spear. Holding the spear he should climb back up the ladder and vault across to the platform where the torch is lying. Drop the torch off the right hand side of the platform so that it lands on or near the bridge below. The human who has just dropped the torch should now vault back to the platform at the top of the ladder. Move the human who threw the spear, to pick up the torch then burn the bush at the end of the platform to clear the way. Now drop the torch fast! Next, build stacks of humans just to the left of the bridge, so that the Human on the upper level can climb down. The Human that has just descended down the stack, who is holding the spear, should now vault across the gap above the hut. Throw the spear back to the tribe waiting on the other side, repeating the process in order to get all the other members of your party across. All the humans should now climb the ladder and form a stack on the upper platform, enabling the last man to climb up and discover the wheel just walk the Human past the wheel and hit Return. Simple, eh? And also very effective! O Ports TEMPER GA 00015500 I'm having rather large problems with Mickey and Donald on Megadrive. I cannot beat the final magician. I'm playing two-player mode using both characters. Please help me out. Emma Anderson, Hearne Bay, Kent. For an end-of-game baddy this guy's a real pussy. Quickly jump onto the moving platforms, and fire several times at his head. Then go to the right-hand corner. The ghosts can't get you. Occasionally jump out and shoot his head, but be careful of the liquid. ( In Ninja Spirit I've hit a bit of a snag. I'm stuck on that bit on the last level where you have to fall down the massive hole. What's the safe route through. Do you know? Gary Badger, Sussex. 30 "

Just follow the map and there shouldn't be any problems. you to control the bosses, but NOT perform their special moves. It causes a lot of corruption of the graphics too and you only have a limited control over the bosses. ENESSIONALS KOL BUE I am having real trouble on Monkey Island. At the beginning of part two, I don't know what to start doing. Could you please help me? Gareth Mackie, Aberdeen, Scotland. C This isn't the most specific question in the world, is it? Well, I'll take you through a little of part two anyway. On the ship you discover that your crew has decided to mutiny. In the cabin, pick up the feather pen, the ink, and open the drawer. Look in the drawer to get the captain's log. Read it if you like. Now walk out on the deck and climb the rope ladder. In the crow's nest, pick up the Jolly Roger and climb back to the deck. Now climb down the hatch and down the other hatch. Pick up the rope, open the keg to get some gun powder and open the chest and get the wine. Now climb back up to the second floor and climb DOWN the ladder to the kitchen, and I'll leave the rest to you. JAL in with the local constabulary, sir, On Monkey Island 1, I'm racking my brain (yes I have got a brain) trying to work out how to get the oars which are in the crack to the south of Monkey Island. I can get the first rope and see the second hanging from the corpse, but try as I might, I just can't seem to reach it. Please, please help. Robbie Stern, Thorpe Bay, Essex. CUYERUSH No problem, just listen up. Pick up the rope from the dead man and go to the jungle. Now go to the crack and use one rope on the steady branch. Climb down it and use the other on the stump. Climb down again and pick up the oars. There you go! I cannot get past the moving wall at the beginning of mission four on Double Dragon. Please tell me how to do it, or how to get infinite lives. Andrew Oliphant, Ferryhill, Co Durham. HOLD YOUR HORSES! I'VE GOT SERIOUS PROBLEMS! Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this game extremely old and not played any more? Oh well, there's no set way to get past it anyway. The best way to do it is to just jump past it as quickly as possible, and try to remember exactly where the wall moves. On Actraiser for the SNES, I've got to the part where there are seven heads and each head's eyes light up  and take you to all the different bosses that you have killed.

"TREVIEW MEGADRIVE by US GOLD .00 OUT: April. Thanks to US Gold (021 625 3388) for the review cart Get on that bike and ride. Now that's what I call a Hot Rod. Charge your shield to keep alive Charge the cart to get ahead. Be smacked in the gob by the most astounding Megadrive game ever... Hands on experience. nother World blew our minds and now Delphine's steamrollered over our toes with this. Messing around in the laboratory, apprentice secret agent, Conrad Hart, discovers that some of the country's key political figures and top nobs aren't really human after all, but evil aliens in disguise! Their cover blown, the extraterrestrials kidnap Conrad and whisk him away to a top security planet, erase his memory and throw away the key! Calling on all of his skills Conrad escapes in a heated laser battle into the hostile planet's jungle. Find Hart's memory, get back to earth and expose the alien scum! Simple! Take my forged I.D. --Sucker! WARN Hey it's ol' goggle eyes. Sneaky, sneaky. mm 34 "


"DISNEY, EAT YOUR HEART OUT! A FEW DOLLARS MORE EEEEE Reinforce the elastic around your drawers 'cos Flashback's animation is sexier than finding Claudia Schaefer at the foot of your four poster! Delphine have packed in hundreds of frames of sprite animation running at, 24 frames per second, the same s most cartoons. Conrad's dynamic moves even thrust Prince Of Persia into the shade. In a bid to heap on the features and surpass the incredible effects of Another World, Delphine has doubled the amount of cinematic-styled animation sequences to an astonishing 75 These keep the film-like stories going The main objective's to leave this stinking planet alive. No way is it going to be easy. Things start off calmly enough as you find your way through the jungle, but, as soon as you hit a populated town, you won't know who to trust. Now you're the alien and the only way out is to earn money for a ticket back to Earth. With no dosh and no work permit, Conrad Hart's in deep trouble. Everyone in the three worlds and six levels puts you into a different predicament. Finding a forger for your 'green card', acting as a bodyguard for VIP scientists, and hunting down Shades of Total Recall methinks. Walk, run and roll Jump up, hop right. forwards and huge leap. Inventory. Turn, face and use item. Force field. Draw and conceal gun. Whilst gun is drawn, use joypad to edge slowly forwards, backwards and roll ready for attack. Walk, run and roll left. Crouch. To fire, hold down. For running, hopping forwards, leaping and operating lifts. Hold down to hang from ledges. THE JOY'S IN THE PAD! Delphine's fantabulous, interactive movies, Flashback is just like popping down to the local Odeon-and, just like in any good, movie, you'll find zooms, full close-ups, pans, and many other atmospheric touches. MUSIC TO YOUR EARS! malfunctioning killer droids for a few dollars are just a few of the occupations you'll embark upon after a visit to the local Job Centre. What a guy will do for a few dollars more. To get around town you'll have to place yourself at the mercy of the underground system. Don't miss your stop or you'll have to go right round the system to get back to the right place. Still, it's better than British Rail! Typical secret agent stance. Right between the eyes. VERDICT Delphine has always put great emphasis on the importance of music and sound effects — and Flashback's no exception. The brilliant music score was composed in the company's own studios and all the sound effects, guns blasting, ricochets, lift swishing etc. are extremely high-quality digitisations. Atmosphere. is built up in all the right places: as our lad creeps around the levels, the pitch of the score changes to match the onscreen action. It's totally amazing: whenever you get locked in a laser/pistol battle with the jet pack riding cops, the sounds of their propulsion units and the different types of gun fire zipping around the speakers blows your mind! Hit Groove Factor 10; it doesn't get much better than this! Prince of Persia blew your Jockys off? Another World wowed you with originality? Prepare yourself for the cack of your life! Flashback will leave you a foaming, animation junkie! Conrad clings onto ledges with his finger tips, splatters into walls, staggers off cliffs and has more life in his tiny, pixelled fingers than a ferret on caffeine! No screen shots can do the game justice, you've gotta see this baby MOVE. And move it will, straight out of the shops before the boxes can touch the shelves. If this cart isn't game of the year we're in for some incredible releases before Christmas. STEVE KEEN Whoops! Maybe not. LLLLLLL "


"VERDICT Steve's already banged on about Flashback's stunning graphical qualities, but this game's about more than just impressive visuals. It's one of the most polished and involving games I've ever seen, crossing Prince of Persia-style clifthanging gameplay with a truly cinematic atmosphere. Forget about CDs THIS is what 'playing the film' is all about! My only quibble is that it might not take that long to complete, but I guarantee you'll have so much fun while it lasts, you'll have got your money's worth even if you clock it in a week! BAR PAUL ANGLIN Never had that problem before, honest! SAD FOLK START HERE James Bond never looked like this! GIT Cretins ahoy! I guarantee that this jump'll give you sad lot a heap of trouble. If you can't do it with my help first time you're not worth the sweat on a baboon's posing pouch! Stand at the edge of the screen, hold 'A', push right, quickly release and push up. ROTO WHAT? Rotoscoping, that's the word. It's the process used in Flashback to make the movement of the sprites so convincing. It's previously been put to good effect only in megabuck major movies. Anyone who's seen the brilliant Lord Of The Rings will know what it's all about. Delphine's 12 meg giant features the most advanced and detailed Rotoscoping ever seen on any home format. But how's it done? Well, first you grab yourself a particularly dexterous actor and film him. The footage is then digitised and drawn over/retouched to produce an extremely fluid set of scrummy sprite animations. It sound easy, but it actually takes weeks to put together just a few well chosen seconds. The plot unfolds. NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER GARTH Nice, you think you know someone Even though you'll be used to the controls by now, things just keep getting hotter. You've only got 90 secs to replace the reactor's card, so don't hang about — run, run, run! Don't bother avoiding the green goo, run through it. Place the card on the right. ON THE SPOT EFFECTS AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! PAUL On the final level get past this morphing monster and pick up the Atomic Charge without losing a life! Small hint: take your gun out of its holster and crouch down to roll away from the pest. Don't hang about, otherwise the dude will waste your bones Speed is of the essence. Don't forget that when you've got the gun you can't run! It's tempting to focus everyone's attention onto the awesome sprites just like those in Prince Of Persia, but there's much, much more in this game. For a start the backdrops are astounding, with weird, warped and twisted foliage and beautifully-drawn locations to complement all the secret agent's adventures. However, the real wowser are the incredible spot effects that breath the ultimate breath of life into the game. There are dripping vines, gun flashes, recoiling weapons, smoke, discharged shells, explosions, dust clouds, Hart's jacket blowing in the wind and even the sound of splintered concrete when a shot misses and ricochets off into the background. Even the characters Conrad passes on his missions, who don't actually have anything to do with the story, walk around and fidget in their own way. HELP US IF YOU CAN! Over the next two months we'll be collecting hints 'n' tips on Flashback, so if you've any advice send it to \"I've don't suffer from Flashbacks, maan!\", CVG, EMAP Images, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU. If your tips are up to it, we'll be printing them in a forthcoming issue. 36 "


"GADGETS 'R' US MEGADRIVE Many players will get off on just running around and putting Conrad through the mill, getting into blaster fight after blaster fight. But once you settle down to the task at hand, you'll find that there's more to the game than meets the eye. The secret agent can interact and talk to over 15 different characters, such as the barman, policemen and underworld figures. They'll point our man in the right direction to collect all-manner of useful items. Hart will have to master the use of various 007 toys such as the anti-gravity belt, the holo-cube that keeps you up-todate with events, and a force field projection unit that throws up a temporary wall of plasma in front of you to deflect explosions and laser blasts. PROS: The best animation ever seen on a computer game anywhere. Indepth gameplay with the right mixture of action and adventure. CONS: Quite easy to complete, even with the difficulty settings. Alone in limbo. CREATURE COMFORT Excellent. Completely stunning movement and detail to match. ON THE OTHER HAND ANOTHER WORLD Delphine's first cinematic adventure on the Megadrive scored brilliantly for its fab animation sequences, action footage and originality. It's not as detailed though, although the sprites are bigger, and it's easily completed. Another World's a must! INNOS Great, atmospheric music and synchronised digitised effects. REVIEWED: CVG No 134 GAMEPLAY Delphine's new classic is enthralling and addictive to the last. D VALUE Flashback is so fab it doesn't matter when you finish it! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES There are some pretty hostile beasts on the planet. The harder the option setting the more variety of aliens you'll be up against. All the living creatures are built for easy play, but whack things up to 'hard and you'll have to face all manner of laser-firing droids and robots! GUARD These guys are cannon fodder. Simple to kill, but if you miss they can dish out some rough justice with their heavy laser rifles. COP The police take at least three shots to kill and have the added advantage of being able to levitate with jet packs. They're pretty good sharpshooters too, and they tend to attack you in groups. GUARD 2 The same as the first guard, but this guy has a force field for protection. CY-B021 Simulated replicants. Droids that have gone wrong. They take a fair few shots to wipe out and can de-materialise in front of your eyes and rush up behind you to spread your brains all over the carpet! BIO-MORPHS Genetically engineered creatures who can morph their bodies into all kinds of shapes and slide around the walls and ceilings. They are particularly good at avoiding shots and trying to scooch up close, zapping your bones with a plasma bolt from their hands. Purple rain, purple rain. ...  Om ONWA VERDICT MISS IK HIT Flashback is graphically almost perfect game and sets the standard for graphics and animation. Hopefully it'll be a tremendous hit with gamesplayers too and kick some software producers' ass into giving people games that really show just what the Megadrive can do. It's beatifully presented, with cut in scenes for special events that add to the overall atmosphere, and beautiful design touches like being able to skip through them if you're eager to get on with game. The puzzle element is great too with several missions cropping up in order for you to progress. GARTH SUMPTER 37 "

Terminated destroy the man to victory over lohn Crikey! Ice-cube central! Obviously, there's no heating in Rebel Command. The most powerful killing machines ever, Cyberdyne Systems' T-800 and T-1000 Terminator units, failed in their missions to travel back in time and destroy the man who would eventually lead the Resistance forces to victory over the Skynet Defence System. That man, Colonel John Connor, has, in the year 2029, come into possession of a powerful battle-suit, built by Skynet as a forerun ner to the Terminator. You are the hero selected to slip into the Advanced Cybernetic Exoskeleton and take on the Terminators on equal terms. It's one man against everything that Skynet can throw at you but you must succeed. The fate of the planet rests in your hands. PC (1 MB It's EXPANDED ing that MEMORY et REQUIRED) Don't even try talking your way out of this one-he's not the sort to converse. HEAVY WEAPONS You've toasted one Terminator! They're tough nuts to crack, these T-800s and Hunter Killers, and you're not going to defeat them with a hard stare. Which is why, nice chaps that they are, Special Operations have made available to you their most up-to-the-minute weaponry. The ACE Battle Armour has six hardpoints to which can be attached the kit you will require to complete your assigned missions. Follow the instructions given to you by High Command; it will assist greatly in correct selection from the following equipment: PHASED PLASMA RIFLE Imola The futuristic weapon made famous in the original HOPNEGA Terminator movie (who remembers Arnie's request to, buy a 'Phased Plasma Rifle in a 40-watt range in the PRAETORLARMIINNON 1984 gun shop?). Hitting the fire button unleashes a FINDESITE OF BIGIT bolt of plasma which causes considerable damage, THERMAL LOU Blindingly accurate from close range, it loses effectiveness when firing at targets further away. TOMAHAWK FUSION GRENADE LAUNCHER Recent advances in controlled nuclear detonation have resulted in the creation of Tomahawk, an updated version of the 20th Century grenade launcher COMBATTINETURIU Not only is it more accurate than its forefather, the Tomahawk, due to its atomic capability, is also far more devastating. Only the most heavily-armoured foe will be able to withstand a direct hit from a Tomahawk. Your quarters. And quite frankly, I'd rather sleep with the HKs. Mind you, looks like a good game of Terminator on the telly... AINK ROLLER CON AUTODOC Although the ACE Battle Armour gives the wearer an equal standing on the battlefield, it is still possible to be seriously injured while inside. The Autodoc has been created to counteract the enemy's damage inflicting capabilities.

"MISSION IN ACTION VERDICT Terminator 2029, as it's not the killing spree many of us expected. Instead, it's more akin to the Dungeon Master style of play, most notably in the flick-screen way you move around the playing world. But I enjoyed the game; it's massive, with over twenty thousand different locations, and some of the graphics are par ticularly impressive. Nineteen missions are there to be undertaken, and I had enough of a problem getting off the first one! There could have been more to the game, but generally, Terminator 2029 is a good spin-off. PROS: Encased in your ACE Battle Armour, you're ready (although not entirely willing) to step into the nightmare which is Los Angeles in the year 2029. LA is a desolate place, laid to waste after the devastating nuclear holocaust in 1997; charred skeletons and rubble replace what used to be a sprawling metropolis. To aid Rebel Command in its fight against Skynet, you must complete a variety of missions given to you by John Connor and his team. In the mission briefing room, you will be furnished with a blow-by-blow account of the task you are about to undertake, containing vital information such as primary and secondary objectives, most useful weapons and likely enemies which you will encounter. Following that, it's into the armoury to kit yourself out with the very latest equipment which Rebel Command has to offer, before being shoved out of the door and into the unknown! Excellent graphics, and a massive game with plenty of missions. CONS: The role-playing nature of Terminator 2029 might put people off. PAUL RAND This is the happy scene when you get your ass blown off. GRAPHI Enemy characters are brilliant and backdrops are also impressive. UNNOS SEINE Good tunes and meaty sound effects fit the atmosphere. VERDICT There's little I can add to Paul's comment apart from the fact that this really strikes me as a high-tech Dungeon and Dragon's like adventure with bags of shooting in it. Control is a little unmweidly at times but the computer HUD display has nice touches like the naming of targets. It's also really progressive, with the strategy element fairly low in earlier missions which leaves it wide open for people who just want a quick blast. Graphics are nothing special but are dark and moody and James Cameron-like. An OK game for all PCers. GAMEPLAY Initially disappointing, but ultimately engrossing There's loads and loads in it. A very big game for your money. GARTH SUMPTER KILL AND DON'T BE KILLED STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES O-NWAGO TIITITITIT Looks impressive, that ground-based HK. Don't hang around though, otherwise you'll get your head kicked in.. It's no good setting off war-ravaged LA without first having at least some idea of what you're letting yourself in for, after all, this is the year 2029, there are Terminators lurking around practically every corner and, unless you're fully prepared, you'll be blasted to smithereens faster than you can say 'Ayah! Ayah! Get off me head!' So it would be recommended to try your hand in the purposebuilt training arena before heading out into the real killing zone. The training missions are an accurate recreation of actual battle situations, except if you die, you don't your progress is logged and you live to fight another mission. It's strongly recommended that you become well-versed in all aspects of Terminator trashing in training before you attempt the real thing the ACE Battle Armour is too precious to lose. ON THE OTHER HAND MISS OK! HIT THE TERMINATOR US Gold and Bethesda's original Terminator licence was a right good 3D laugh, and was the first EVER Terminator game to appear on any home computer. This original, blast-'emto-hell Terminator remains a challenging title that would keep you amused for some time. 84 REVIEWED: CVG No 120 39 "


"REVIEWI SUPER NES by MINDSCAPE .99 OUT: May. Contact Mindscape on (0444 246333) for information. KNOW YOUR ENEMY Keep an eye out for petrol bombs they hurt! Reaching Skynet's HQ is no easy task thanks to the mechanical monstrosities spewed out by the villainous computer network. Here's a rundown... Who's that at the window? Why, it's a gun-toting thug. With a bald head. T-800 TERMINATOR The basic model produced by Skynet, armed with a rifle and programmed to patrol and kill. One shot from your rifle should blast away the main chassis, with the surviving head and torso section exploding a few seconds later. FUTURE WARS The game kicks off in war-torn Los Angeles of 2029. Take on an army of T-800s and Hunter Killers and reach Skynet's HQ to access the Time Displacement Machine, and zoom back to 1984, where a T800 is trying to wipe out the mother of unbom John Connor who will, in the future, lead the Resistance to victory over Skynet. THE TERMINATOR T-800 TERMINATOR (DISGUISED) When the standard T800 is covered in human flesh (an infiltration unit), they become slightly tougher to kill. These replicant machines also attack in more sophisticated ways, firing while crouched and diagonally from raised platforms. These flying trashcans come in two varieties the first fires sporadically down at you from its high vantage point while the other drops deadly wormy things (see below). A few wellaimed upward shots will see them off. OF COURSE IT'S A CLASSIC FILM, BUT WHAT'S THE Terminators attack even after they've LATEST GAME LIKE? been blown in half! ou'd think there's little good to be said about a nuclear war, but at least James Cameron's bleak vision of the future has provided us with two top films and a host of decent software. The Terminator movies make such ideal game material that it was always a sure fire bet that there would be a whole host of video game tie-ins. Sega Terminator fans have generally been done proud, with versions of the first movie on all formats, as well as a convert of the recent T2 coin-op on Megadrive. Nintendo owners, however, have been short-changed as far as versions on their systems go. ThankMindscape then, for stepping onto the scene with a SNES version_Put your foot down and get shifted sharpish Arnie's right behind you! of the original classic. These reptilian rascals look harmless enough, but race towards you if you get too close, detonating at your feet and causing big damage. They're two low to the ground to shoot, so lob a hand grenade at them instead. 40 "


"VERDICT SUPER NES intendo unicom Don't be fooled none of these boys are human. Is this game HARD or what? The gameplay is fine, but there are niggles that make it so frustrating. The restart checkpoints are so far apart, on the first level you can progress for twenty minutes and still get sent right back to the start when you die! Needless to say, we caught only brief glimpses of the Terminator himself and, though the game may well have some very good stuff on later levels, what's the point if you've got next-to no chance of ever getting there? We all want challenging games, but this is ridiculous! PAR PROS: Captures the atmosphere of the film fairly well. More driving hilarity through the streets of LA! GARY WHITTA CONS: Basically, it's just too difficult. Q000000 HARD DRIVING! GRAPHICS Dodgy sprites and bland backdrops give a decidedly 8-bit feel Make it through the urban warzone and shoot down the combat helicopter at the end and it's forward to a perilous 3D driving section, with you and Sarah Connor racing through the streets. It's up to you to steer the car safely through the oncoming traffic AND take potshots at Arnie by firing through the left, right and rear windows. If you can stay alive, you'll escape to the police station, location of the movie's best scene and yet more Arnie-related carnage! 69 59 Fair in-game FX, but the music sounds nothing like the film. The last level-but an iron bar against a T-800 Terminator? I don't think so. THE FINAL BATTLE With all the driving shenanigans finally put paid to, it's off to the factory where Arnie and Reese have a showdown. To make matters worse, on this final level you haven't even got a gun anymore; all you have is an iron bar, which is put to best use by clanging it round the Terminator's steel bonce. You haven't got a hope of killing him like this he's HARD, remember but what you can do is stall him long enough for Sarah to build a bomb, shove it into his ribcage and blow him away for good. GAMEPLAY It's a lot of fun, if you've got the patience of a saint. Loadsacarnage! COPS AND ROBOTS If you're persistent enough, it could keep you going for months. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 22ELELLELENETE Come the fourth level, you and Sarah Connor have been nicked and placed in separate cells in an LA cop shop. Naturally, the presence of thirty heavily-armed cops isn't going to put the T-800 off so, as the Terminator takes the station by force, you escape from your cell and set about finding Sarah before he does. But since your gun has no ammo to start with, you have to resort to fisticuffs with the cops and other escaped prisoners until you can find some which you'll definitely need when you bump into Arnie himself. Searching behind every door in the station is the only sure way of finding Sarah before the big T and, once you've done that, it's on to yet more driving fun, this time with Arnie chasing on a bike. NOW TURN TO PAGE 92 FOR THE NES EXCLUSIVE! 10 Don't be a hero get down that stepladder! ONWUOCO VERDICT Reese takes on a Hunter Killer! MISS OK! HIT Yeah, sure, Terminator's hard, but that's the point, isn't it? After all, what kind of respect would you hold for an armour-plated killing machine if it wasn't? The Terminator's filmlike intros are ace, but where's the traditional music? Although there's not much gameplay, the way your machine gun fire rips through the cyborgs to reveal their metallic insides is brilliant. What a shame more such effects weren't introduced. Terminator's hard, but fine, its major problem being that it can never match the brilliance of the film. Oh no! A ground-based HK to take out! STEVE KEEN 41 "

"VERDICT SUPER NES View your nedals On PC, Wing Commander received the kind of attention Star Wing is attracting now. On the right still frame and it looks awesome, however, when playing it's a different story. All your time is spent chasing small ships in the distance and then hammering off shots before they screech past your sights. There are tons of controls to watch out for too great if the main ones were assigned to the pad's six buttons, but they're not, and you're left floundering with a series of complicated ballroom steps in the heat of combat. With a redefinable pad it could have been so different. PROS: Great detail on the fighters.Fastpaced music.Good intro screens and a large variety of ships and weapons. CONS: Hard to access the controls. Too many button combinations for the simplest of things. STEVE KEEN a gathered here to pay tribute to ong of our own, 200 LT. CUG. Try telling us death has no sting. FIGHT THE FIGHT GRAPHICS Brilliant bitmapped detail on the ships and excellent explosions. Descencio Ben The alliance have four attack craft to choose from, the Kilrathi have the same. You can recognise them by sight but your on-board computer should give you plenty of warning. TERRAN FIGHTERS HORNET: Slimline, light excellent for tight manoeuvres and turns. SCIMITAR: A mediumrange, averagespeed, allround-combat vessel. RAPTOR: Heavily-armed and slightlysluggish fighter. TRDESB SOUND Nice use of music that reacts to gameplay. For now your're on autopilot, but soon there'll be no turning back! GET WITH THE PROGRAM! Limited, due to the awkwardness of controls. RAPIER: An extremely fast and ably.kitted-out, attack ship. Fly training mission What a motley crew of misfits Won't last forever. One for rainy days only. If you want a quick, practise blast, simply strap yourself into the simulation cockpit in the officers club. However, to really get into the game you'll have to enter the mission mode. Every battle is proceeded by a briefing where you'll find out where you've got to go, what you've got to do and who yah gonna kill! The five types of flight missions include guarding a base or hyper space jump point, protect cargo and civilian vessels, seek out enemy squadrons and engage and strike at enemy bases in hit and run operations. Here your Wingman, Spirit, really comes into play as she has to hold off the Kilrathi fighters whilst you aim and release the bigger missiles at the base targets. MISSILE ALERT! The different star federations have more weapons stocked up in their back yard than Saddam 'Sad Man' Hussein! Here's a few to watch out for, especially if they're locked onto your butt!! DUMB-FIRE MISSILES: Keep right until the end; you have to get in close KILRATHI FIGHTERS TAL to stand any chance of a hit. HEAT SEEKER : Locks onto ship's rear engines. However, if your enemy shakes the rocket it will re-lock on the nearest hot spot and that includes you! GUMPH! IMAGE RECOGNITION MISSILE :Keep your target in view for several seconds before release. The missile then memorises the type of ship and will chase it until it hits its target or runs out of fuel. FRIEND OR FOE : The most intelligent rocket of the lot. It identifies a signal broadcast by all Terran ships and wipes out the nearest vessel that isn't broadcasting! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 SALTHI: Small Nippy, but not very well-armed. ONWAGO 11111111111 VERDICT KRANT: Built for dogfighting, an awesome adversary MISS OK! HIT DRALTHI: Great manoeuvrability make this boy tough to hit and very dangerous. As much as I hated Wing Commander on the PC, I can't deny that it makes a damn fine console game. It looks good, sounds good and is the sort of game that the SNES has been screaming out for for ages! Okay, so it's not a patch on the all-conquering Starwing (but then again, what is?), but it's much better than the fragic Warpspeed and shows that the SNES can do impressive-looking 3D even without the aid of a special chip! I'm not sure how long it'll hold its appeal, but you're guaranteed plenty of fun for as long as it does. GRATHA: A long-range, heavilyarmoured battle ship Easily outrun. GARY WHITTA 43 "

Walk up to a nasty and you'll grab hold of him now, you can choose to either punch or kick him, hurl him onto the ground or against a wall or, if you can manSurprise! Surprise! age to also grab hold of another baddy at the same time, you can smack their heads together for mega-damage infliction! Our man Wayne clouts the clown while the drab bird looks on. BATMAN BOOM BANG-ABANG If you want to get ahead, get a testtube! Because Bruce Wayne is megarich and also rather clever, he's managed to come up with this natty mixture which, when hurled to the ground, explodes! This is the best fashion accessory any nocturnal sub six-foot superhero should have to ward off any night prowlers. At the start of the game, three test-tubes full of this explosive material are in your possession, and more can be found throughout the levels by turning over litter bins and the like. RETURNS BAT ICONS TEST TUBE: Receive an extra test-tube full of explosive liquid! WHITE LOGO: Get your hands on one hundred lovely points. RED LOGO: Get awarded with one thousand points! SMALL HEART: Increases the power in your energy bar by a small amount. BIG HEART: Refills your energy bar right up to the top! VERDICT y day, he's mildmannered millionaire, Bruce Wayne. He leads a quiet life, doing deals, drinking champers and generally having a good time. Then night falls and, while most would be tucked up with a steaming cup of Horlicks, our Brucey's down in his underground cave, slipping into his natty winged costume and getting ready to deal out death and destruction to Gotham City's foes as the infamous Batman! In this, the game of the sequel to the original blockbusting movie starring Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader, Catwoman and The Penguin have come to town, and it's up to Batman to get rid of them, using any means at his disposal usually a good fist in the mouth. Eeeh, it's a bat's life. 44 Batman Returns looks the bizz. Sprites are very good, especially the Batman and Catwoman characters, and music is suitably dark and moody. When you start to play, you realise that Batman Returns is undeniably modelled on the Final Fight genre; in fact, this isn't a kick in the pods away from Konami's own Turtles conversion on SNES! There's nothing new here and the fairly monotonous gameplay is fine for only a short time. It's too easy, as well. Not a total loss, but there are better examples of this type of game. PAUL RAND "


"Ooyah! Sad Batman gets chinned off a lass. VERDICT SUPER NES Dintendo >> PREVENCI This isn't the platform game that most previous conversions of this movie have been. Konami has come up with what could have been a really frantic beat 'em up unfortunately, it's just too easy! Yes, that old problem rears it's all-too familiar ugly head again. On normal setting you can expect to finish Batman Returns inside of a day and for  that's really not what you want. The higher setting provides a little more challenge a couple of days more, anyway. Another potentially brilliant game wrecked by a lack of playtesting. PROS: Graphically and sonically impressive, and an easy game to get into with lots of different attacking moves to try out. CONS: You've seen it all before, not least in Konami's own Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! PAUL ANGLIN Here's what happens when you hurl test-tubes filled with inflammable material around! The Bat Rope in action. THE APPLIANCE OF SCIENCE SOIHVUS E Well-drawn sprites and moody backdrops. Batman isn't like your ordinary superhero. As a matter of fact, he isn't a superhero at all. He has no special powers as such; his abilities come from scientific research, rather than other planets or radioactive creepy-crawlies. While Batman's suit has wings attached, he can't fly they do, however, allow him to sail through the air for a short time and land on enemies' heads. He also has his handy Batarang which, if you can't guess, is a kind of boomerang shaped like a bat, which our hero uses to toss at opponents. And, if he's in a sticky situation and needs to high-tail it quickly, Batman can always rely on his Bat Rope simply attach it to a building and swing away from danger! Atmospheric tunes that sound like the original movie tracks. GAMEPLAY Gets dull and monotonous after a short time. Far, far too expensive for what you get. SEND IN THE CLOWNS STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES ONWOO Kick-tastic action with Batman and a cunningly dressed clown! ON THE OTHER HAND Those of you who have seen the Batman Returns film may well recognise some of the baddies from there in this game. There are fat clowns, thin clowns, blokes on stilts hurling flaming torches at you, and skull-headed madmen on motorbikes who attempt to knock you over. As well as these, there's also a load of end-level nasties to contend with, including a rock-hard geezer who smacks seven shades out of you if your timing isn't spot-on. Even the wily Catwoman, complete with rather nasty whip, is there to make Batman feel as though he's on a sticky wicket! It's not all left-to-right beat 'em up action, either; make it through to level five and you're given the chance to drive the Batmobile in a second-person perspective 3D thrash through Gotham, taking out biking bower-boys as you rip up the roads! hu MISS OK! HIT TURTLES IN TIME : .99 Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles IV Turtles In Time is in a similar vein to Batman Returns, in as much as it's left-to-right scrolling beat 'em up jollies. Actually, it's not very jolly because the game is just far too easy to complete. ISSUE 130 SEPT '92 45 "

"REVIEW by TRADEWEST .99 MEGADRIVE OUT: Now. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the cartridge. RATTILATOADS PROS: It's funny, it's fun to play and it goes on for ages! CONS: There's lots of it, but it's all a little too easy. Don't let the crows bite through your rope! A HIT ON JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER FORMAT, THE TURTLE-BASHERS ARE AT LAST ON MEGADRIVE! hew, Battletoads, eh? Originally dreamed up to jump on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bandwagon when the Heroes in a Half Shell were at their peak, the trio of lean, green intergalactic warriors Zitz, Rash and Pimple have proved to be even more successful! They've certainly got more staying power, having been converted to just about every format imaginable since their debut on the NES, and now they're settling down nicely on the Megadrive. The story and gameplay remain the same evil Dark Queen has swiped the lovely (and quite fit) Princess Angelica and Pimple, the chief Battletoad (and one of the other two, providing you've got a pal to take up the controls) must get her back. GRAPHICS Not bad, but not exactly eye-bogglingly good, either. so Entertaining ingame FX and some top tunes to boot. Stick the boot in on that rat thing! TWO CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME Good variety of styles, and not a duff level among them. As you'd expect, Battletoads is a game best enjoyed in simultaneous two-player mode, so drag a mate round to your place to squeeze the most fun out of it. Even if you're playing on your jack though, you're guaranteed a good time thanks to the game's offbeat sense of humour look out for the giant Doc Marten boots the toads magically grow when they kick their enemies off screen!! Not bad, but a top boy might clock this in a couple of weeks. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT 10 2 Battling the baddies is a damned sight easier if you smack 'em with an iron bar! COCO TOADS IN THE HOLE I've got three words for anybody who doesn't like Battletoads You Sad Man. I think the Battletoads are tops, and not without good reason. This version is slightly easier than the NES original and, though the graphics aren't that stunning, there's enough gameplay to keep you happy until the cows come home! It's the clever mix of different styles (platform, beat em up and racing) coupled with a great sense of humour that make Megadrive Battletoads a winner, so why not hop along to your local games shop and get it? I am! ONWALI IIIIIIIIIII MIT MISS OKHIT GARY WHITTA The toadys' quest is split into several sub-games. The action starts on the surface of the Dark Queen's planet, with a Golden Axe-style beat 'em-up against Queenie's minions. Get through that and it's onto a vertically-scrolling battle as Pimple abseils down to the centre of the planet, followed by more left-to-right beat 'em-up action and then a high-speed obstacle course raced across on turbopowered jetbikes. From then on things get tougher still, with a maze-like platform-style stage to negotiate and yet more racing, this time on space-age skateboards. Pimple takes on the boxing sewer rats. 47 "


"REVIEW AMIGA by TEAM 17 .99 OUT: Now. Contact Team 17 on 0924 291867 THE CONTESTANTS Choose which one you want to beand then take on the rest! Say, don't some of these look a little familiar...? BLOWS JUNIOR (UK) An ex-boxing champion, Junior now prefers to forget about any toffeenosed rules and beat someone to a bloody pulp on the illegal fighting circuit. Punching power is, of course, well impressive look out for his Special Blows! HE'S A BIT LIKE: GUILE THIS IS A GAME THAT KICKS ASS OUT OF THE REST... KOSSAK (RUSSIA) A Russian powerhouse of incredible strength, he was created by genetic experiments. He's slow, but his great power can shake the entire screen. HE'S A BIT LIKE: ZANGEIF DAN (USA) One of the good characters, he's an ex-gang leader with karate skills to put most black belts to shame. Look out for his electrifying special moves. HE'S A BIT LIKE: RYU treet Fighter Il conquers the beat'em-up world on Super NES at least. On the Amiga the battle still rages to decide who's the roughest, toughest fightin'n'fumpin' game of them all. As CVG proclaimed two months ago, the Amiga version of SFU leaves lots to be desired but arcade kings Team 17 are hoping to fulfil them with this. With Alien Breed, Project-X and Assassin behind them, they're now out to topple Chun-Li, Ryu and chums from the top of the beat'em-up pile with this unashamed copy which sees Ten of the world's toughest fighters clash in a bid to emerge as the World's Hardest Man. NIK (USA) The brother of Dan, Nik has exactly the same fighting style and special attacks as his twin. HE'S A BIT LIKE: KEN MARIA (SPAIN) Body Blows' only female character, this Spanish onion (eh? Ed) is not to be taken lightly, although, she may seem harmless to start with. Fast as lightning, she's weak and finished off easily but first you have to find an opening...SHE'S A BIT LIKE: CHUN-LI. MIKE (USA) At the end of the day, this company MD gets rid of the stress by being extremely violent. He is fairly strong in all areas but is easy meat for some of the tougher characters until they see his Whirlwind move! HE'S A BIT LIKE: Erm... LORAY (THAILAND) Another martial arts expert whose knowledge and training is shrouded in mystery, Loray's skills are a force to be reckoned with. His special moves are very mystifying,... HE'S A BIT LIKE: DHALSIM (again) NINJA (JAPAN Mysterious and utterly inscrutable, Ninja comes armed with a razor-edged sword used with incredible speed and accuracy. Beware he can turn himself invisible at will! A BIT LIKE: DHALSIM. YIT-U (CHINA) His Super Fast Punch is so quick he blurs during use. Lightning reflexes are needed to keep up with him, but if he lets his guard down, a few good moves will easily defeat him. A BIT LIKE: BLANKA (Aka the fast attack). VERDICT DUG (USA) The fattest fighter in the game, Dug was chucked out of the pro wrestling circuit for being too violent. His moves are very powerful, but his great weight slows him down, particularly in the air. HE'S A BIT LIKE: EHONDA BLANKA LEVEL 24 There's really nothing for me that'll beat Streetfighter II on the SNES but if you've got an Amiga then this is the beat 'em up to beat. It's fast and the graphics are bright and colourful but, as with any fighting game, the real proof of the pudding is in the beating. And the control method used is just so sweet as to be the icing on the cake for anyone who likes to have a bash at something new. With easy to learn controls, the game is more one of fast reactions than trying to remember all the various moves. A triumph for Amigas! GARTH SUMPTER \"24th floor, gentleman's fashions, sports goods...\" 48 "


"VERDICT AMIGA Brothers are always fighting... You've never seen a beat 'em-up done quite as well as this! Team 17 has shown what the Amiga is truly capable of, with a game that could hold its own against the Super NES version of SFII! Faster, harder and more entertaining than any other fighting game on the Amiga (save maybe IK+), Body Blows is about as good as it's ever going to get and then some! With so many_fighters, options and, above all, a superb and easy-to-learn control mode, Body Blows is an absolute must for any Amiga-owning fighting fans! PROS: Super-fast fighting action that looks good, feels good and makes you sweat! CONS: Could unleash your violent tendencies and wind you up in borstal. Otherwise fine. GARY WHITTA Speed versus shadow only one can win. NICE TO MEET YOU! Remember how in Street Fighter II, you could fight two versions of the same character against each other if you knew the correct cheat mode? Well, Body Blows lets you do the same thing, except you don't need a cheat! Simply select the same character twice when setting up the next match and away you go! Unfortunately, it can be difficult telling the two fighters apart in matches like these. If you want to match two equallyskilled fighters without the confusion, select Dan and Nik, who are identical in all but appearance. GRAPH Lovely sprites, fluid animation and varied backdrops add up to a visual feast. Yit-u's speed is too much even for a Ninja. CHOOSE AND PERISH SOUND You can't go wrong with this many top tunes and sampled FX. Each fighter has their own fighting style (over 20 moves each) and an armoury of special attacks. All moves are easy to master and are skillfully squeezed onto a onebutton joystick. Adding to the action is the choice to fight in various locations, a big-city office block, a shaolin temple, on top of a construction site crane and a Russian laboratory. If you think that this is starting to sound almost impossibly like Street Fighter II, then you're not wrong. 1d What can we say? It's one of the most playable beat'em-ups on any machine! Dan's secret move is a devastating electrical bolt If you've got a pal to play with, the two-player game could last forever! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES AND NOW THE BORING BIT Don't fear, Amiga-fans you needn't worry about a disk-swapping nightmare! Body Blows comes on only three disks and boring swapping is kept to a minimum, with changes only normally required if you want to load in a new fighter or location. Other impressive bits include super-smoothing animation on the fighters (much smoother than Amiga SFII) and a playing area that scrolls not just left and right, but also up and down to follow the player when he leaps in the air for a flying attack! It's an excellent achievement, considering the amount of top graphics and sampled speech (which, by the way, is excellent) that have been squashed into those three little blue disks. So let's here it for the Team 17 Top Boys! Hip hip hooray! The only question now is, can they get any better with their next two offerings the platform extravaganza Superfrog and racing epic Overdrive? Find out next month... Dug's power punch gets the better of Nik. O-Nwaua iun ON THE OTHER HAND MISS OK HIT Watch out for Dug's awesome bellyflop! STREET FIGHTER II US Gold's Amiga version fails sadly to measure up to the standards set by the coin-op/SNES versions. Amiga SFII is no tragedy, but in the face of competition such as this, you'd be a few jam butties short of a picnic not to prefer Body Blows. 90 REVIEWED: CVG No 136 The scene's set for the Nik vs Dug match-up.

"I by HUDSON SOFT .99 Disk supplied by ACE Consoles (071 439 1185) TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE PC ENGINE Jadoh is one of the most powerful super-villains of all time. So it's fair to assume that he's got some of the toughest bodyguards this side of Detroit! Luckily for Tony he's not alone.and his pal, Hawk, has decided to join the fight with him Tony, and his buddy have very different builds and fighting styles. Tony's skills come solely from his incredible speed and agility, whereas Hawk is more of a human power house! Hawk Prefers to slam his opponents into the pavement, rather than simply peppering them with light jabs. Both fighters have their strengths and weaknesses and it's up to you which one to choose for the adventure ahead! @DET PROS: Superb music that really kicks some serious ass! Shame about the effects! CONS: The lacklustre gameplay has nothing special to offer and is dull, dull, dull GRAPHICS The distinct lack of colour does the graphics no favours at all. (Top) Great flying elbow from Hawk. (Right) Pretty Boy? More like Fat boy! (Above) Mr Lee goes down but Miss Chan is still standing. SOUND Excellent. Some of the most wicked, thumping tracks I've ever heard on a console. REST OF WOLF GAMEPLAY Only three moves! No difference between the two heroes! Play soon becomes dull. It won't take long before you get very very bored with this. 2 WELL, THE SOUND IS CERTAINLY SOME OF THE BEST WE'VE EVER HEARD... loody typical! You finally manage to blag a day off, after weeks of hard slog, and what should happen? Your woman decides to spend the day holed up in some madman's hideout. This guy's lair is more heavily guarded than Prince's wardrobe, with some of the toughest boys in the business standing guard. There's no time to relax with your feet up! The lads jolly trip out will have to wait! You've got to go and risk life and limb to save the dizzy old bird! Women eh? Mind you, she's not ugly! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES ONWOO VERDICT MISS UKUHT Look at the height on that. WHO'S BAD? The mighty Jadoh Boss will do everything to protect his empire. The fat git has left a nice end-oflevel baddy in each sector for you, so even when you've kicked his evil minions' asses, you've still got the big lads to deal with, and boy, are they big! First of all, you're up against the somersaulting duo of Mr Lee and Miss Chan. Taking their place on the second level is Shauna, a hot girlie clad in tight leather (phwoarr). Then things take a turn for the worse. Fuji and Quin both take centre stage in an attempt to block progress to your lovely lady and Jadoh. Think you're up to it? There's only one way to find out. 50 Well this is a new concept, all sound and no gameplay! Crest Of Wolf is let down really badly in every department. The sprites are nice enough, even if they are a blatant rip off of Streets Of Rage 2 but the lack of different colours used makes a hell of a difference to the look. Everything is viewed in a slightly different shade of red or blue! Unfortunately the gameplay fairs no better. Not only is it really easy, but it's really crap too! There're only about three moves so boredom sets in horribly quickly. Good it is NOT!! PAUL ANGLIN "

"REVIEW MEGA CO2 by SEGA_ _-84050 MEGA CD by SEGA -50 OUT: TBA. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the review cart. SOUNDS GOOD Road Avenger has an incredible new feature. This technique is known as Binaural sound. This means that the sound has been recorded using a number of strategically placed microphones. Because the effects have been recorded in sequence, they sound really realistic. If a car screeches past you on the right, sound will come only from the right speaker adding to the quality of the game. It's best appreciated by using a pair of headphones or separate speakers. ROAD AVENGER Another excellent cut scene. Now how did he get through that window without breaking it? WE THOUGHT THE GRAPHICS WOULD BE GOOD BUT NOT THIS GOOD... artin Riggs, Magnum, Poncharella and DI Burnside, they're all a bunch of old women real crime busters work for STOP (Special Task Operation Police). Cars have become so advanced nowadays, that this special Police department has been set up to deal with high-speed criminals. Unfortunately, car-related crime has moved on a little since the days of driving in bus lanes and parking on the pavement. The carjackers, as they're known, have taken to running people off the road and wrecking shops, or anything else that stands in the way of their evil, twisted plans. So far, they've evaded capture but the Road Avenger has yet to join the fun! May I see your driver's license please? Mayhem as you roar through the city centre. is yet to Ve eva way of VERDICT Damn! Reverse and first gear are so easily mixed up. Hmm. I'm not entirely sure about this. On the one hand, the gameplay is extremely limited and won't exactly stretch the very sinews of your imagination, but once you get into the later levels, the action can get really frantic you have to concentrate wholly on what you're doing, and the action can even get quite fun. Despite this occasional smattering of gameplay, there's really not a huge amount in Road Avenger to warrant a  price tag, and even less considering you need to buy a Mega CD to play it on! STEVE KEEN Do make sure your brakes work first. 52 "


"VERDICT MEGA CD You'd better slow down quick! Blimey! What excellent Manga-style graphics and animation shame about the game though! As excellent as Road Avenger is to look at and listen to there's just no way I can put my seal of approval to a game that is little more than a car version of Dragon's Lair! The only thing that goes any way to saving the game is the difficulty setting. This actually makes a huge difference when cranked up to hard. Probably not worth the asking price, but definitely worth checking out. PROS: Excellent manga-style graphics and cut scenes! Superb sound effects. CONS: Very limited gameplay. See ya, wouldn't like to be ya. PAUL ANGLIN SAD FOLK START HERE GIT GRAPHICS Some of the best cartoon-style graphics yet seen on any machine. Oh deary me! If you're still struggling on this bit after an hour, then you really are some kind of saddy. Maybe you should just go back to using your Mega CD to play your Bee Gees' albums, you'll probably get more results! But, seriously, if you are stuck on this level, then just sit a little closer to the screen and pay more attention to to the icons NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER Pah! Who needs David Hasselhoff? Binaural sound makes an excellent debut with stunning sound effects. STEVE Nice one, you've made it to the Freeway. Now you're starting to get somewhere with that car You'd better pay attention though, 'cos this is where things get a little tough. One handy little tip, a turn in one direction is likely to be proceeded by its opposite. Keep your thumb over both buttons, and you'll comer more smoothly. AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! Quick, hang a right--that bike's coming straight for you! LOOPDES Gameplay's not a fair question to ask of this type of game because there isn't any! 10vd Hang on, we reviewed Sewer Shark last issue. Finishing after three hours of solid play really isn't really worth fifty odd quid. Excellent, you're in the city. There's traffic everywhere here and there's bugger all margin for error. There'll be so much occurring on screen, that to stay alive you'll have to force yourself to ignore the animation and concentrate on watching out for the arrows. MEGA GRAPHICS STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES LITT Impressive huh? R.A. leaves death and carnage behind. No-one will get out of there alive. With recent advances in graphics technology, it's familiar these days for any CD game to have a megasmart intro, and Road Avenger certainly has that. Anyone familiar with the magazine, published by Anime UK (and those of you who aren't : get it sorted now) or anyone interested in Manga art in general, will be more than impressed with this. The intro is a masterpiece of Manga animation on the Mega CD, accompanied by an admittedly sad but nonetheless impressive, thumping track, to give you the feeling that this car means business. If you're not blown away by the intro, then you'll certainly be picking yourself up from the floor when you get further into the game and experience first hand some of the graphical excellence that inhabits the entire game! ON THE OTHER HAND OK! COBRA COMMAND Cobra Command (aka Thunderstorm FX) is a helicopter death blast that utilises the same graphical features as Road Avenger and so resembles its sequel with similarly uninvolving gameplay. Worth a look if you don't fancy what's on offer here. E 10000C 50100000 REVIEWED: CVG No 132 53 "

IT'S A CLASSY PRODUCT ALRIGHT BUT WHAT PRICE QUALITY? ull on those studded leather gloves and squeeze into oversized leotards once more. Here's yet another arcade beat 'em up on the SNES. There are big brawls and hard guys-a-plenty in this massive scrapfest, spread over the sprawling ghettos of a giant metropolis. The Brawl Brothers, Hack and Slash, run their own self-defence gym; but the duo aren't as good at looking after their students as they are at duffing up people three of their best have been kidnapped to be cloned by the psychopathic butcher, Dieter! So don't dawdle; if you want to save the day, get brawling! Two player frolics abound. Doncha feel sorry for the enemy? RASH CRAS SLASH Looks just like M. Bison, but isn't as cool! His special move is the Fire Punch, which lets loose a huge ball of flaming plasma at the enemy. WENDY Kazan goes straight to the heart of the problem, ninja-style! AS HARD AS YOU WANNA BE One of the best features of Brawl Brothers is being able to make it as easy or as difficult as you like. The option screen allows you to change the number of lives per game, the amount of continues and the real pussies can even control the number of thugs that rush onto the screen at once! Tum the Double Hit switch on and your man can attack or steal from his partner in a two-player game. Another novel feature is Angry Mode. Turn this on before a game and, when your player comes under heavy attack, he'll tum bright red, super strong and, just for a few seconds, invincible. With her incredibly agile moves she's more like a cross between a ballet dancer and an aerobics instructor than a hardened street fighter! However, she's incredible in a grapple! And she can dish out the awesome, flashing Somersault Kick. 54 "


"ROUTE TO SUCCESS AIR TERMINAL SYM  MINT Keeping high is one of the best winning tactics. SOMETHING FOR THE MEEK AND... BAYSIDE Begin on the streets of the city and trash Dieter's thugs before moving on to Bayside Bridge. Dodge machine gun fire and jump into the storm drains as the bridge collapses. JUNGLE Avoid the land mines by throwing assailants onto them. Fight your way through the undergrowth until you find your way to Dieter's training complex. AIR FORTRESS Clamber aboard Dieter's huge flying battleship, fight your way across the wing to the entry hatch and then do battle with Dieter himself. COMMAND CENTRE Head across the rooftops and jump from building to building. Don't get lost in the maze of elevators and corridors and avoid the electrified floor panels. Apart from traditional, knuckle-cracking antics, the lads can pick-up a huge variety of weapons thoughtfully scattered around the levels. Sledge hammers, spiked balls, shotguns, knives, rocks, dumbbells and bombs can be snatched up and battered over opponent's skulls or thrown. Even the familiar steel pipe is included for nostalgia's sake! die-hard combat veterans will need help sooner or latter so you can add to the list, chicken legs, first aid kits, pancakes (), chocolate, juice and cheese that'll boost varying amounts of energy. As versatile as a Kenwood mixer! HEY BUDDY! BREAKI If in-game features are what you crave, Brawl Brothers has got 'em. You choose two characters from the five fighting furies at the beginning one as your main player and another as back-up. The other three are taken by Dieter and cloned. At the end of each stage you'll have to fight one of these mutated versions of your buddy and, if you win, he'll be set free and available for selection later on. If you lose all your lives you get the option to change to the back-up character or to your rescued mates and then continue. Thanks. pal. You got here in the nick of line. Lei's go kick sode buti. There's always a pile of bodies around Lord J. It's one thing to go against armed men, but it takes bravery or poor sight to try a helicopter?! VERDICT Let loose the POWER! ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE Accessibility is the name of the game. Jaleco's cart lets you play solo, join forces with a friend for simultaneous two player grappling, or even go at it in one-on-one combat with your partner. During the game, you can stick with one character through thick and thin or take turns with all five: the choice is yours! A second human can jump right in on the action at any time by pressing start on the second joypad. You don't have to reset the machine and lose your hard fought for place in the game. How much do looks count? There's no doubt that, in terms of presenta tion, Brawl Brothers is arcade quality in the presentation stakes. Jaleco's huge, detailed sprites won't disappoint you, especially when they're called into action. Some of the detail is fab, such as the water, which splashes around your heels when you're battling through the sewage-drenched storm drains. However, the fact that you've only got a handful of enemies can prove really limiting. You've got five characters to fight but it's only their single, special move that gives character to each. It's fun to play and smacks of being a quality product; but for around 50 quid you really should be getting a little more gameplay for your money. STEVE KEEN They were once mates, but now they're victims of the clone war! 55 "


"SUPER NES APER Famicom ntendo BRAWL BROTHERS BROTHERLEY LOVE If you've really got your wits about you, you'll be able to pick up the bad guys and throw them onto the landmines — So you don't shread your own tootsies! Or, you can just beat the crap out of the bozos and hope that they fall over backwards onto the bombs. Either way, you'll be saving your own skin. Jungle warfare in the sweaty swamps.

GRAPHICS Big sprite, great backdrops loadsa detail. 29 TO CONTROL D Throw object Throw object SOUND Nothing special just your normal biff baff boff!

STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 102 Garth's dream! Wendy comes over all aerial! VERDICT ONWAO Mmm, nice outfit. There are a lot of things about this game that I really like: the neat animation, the amount of control that you can wield over the gameplay via the options (I like being mad and invincible), the old Batman-like CRASHes and BANG sound bubbles, the fact that you get the chance to take on more than one opponent, plus the absolute must of any beat ''em up game these days, the chance to go up against another human player. This adds tons to the game's appeal. All these neat touches should add up to a humdinger of a game, but it's the few things left out that spoil things. For me, the poor variety of moves available from the numerous combinations of a SNES joypad, take the edge off an otherwise excellent game. MISS OK! IT GARTH SUMPTER 56 "

"by NAXAT SOFT .99 Thanks to ZAP! for the cartridge (0532 590077) SUPER NES REVIEN 5, NONAT SOT I, JATI CRUSH YOU DEVIL! Jaki Crush is the company's latest pinball game and is the sequel to the Megadrive Devil Crush, converted from the PC Engine original of just over a year ago. The game keeps most of the tried and tested bits; the screen scrolls to keep track of the ball as it careers around the table, and several bonus levels are there for those who know how to access them. PROS: If you're a SNES-owning pinball fan, this is the only thing in town for you. CONS: Even with its large amount of bonus screens, there's a noticeable lack of variety. GRAPHICS Sprites are pretty and there are some stunning bonus screens. Bonus screens varied yet similar. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE FIRST EVER SNES PINBALL GAME! ver since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball. From Birmingham to Clacton, I think I've Iseen them all, but you won't see anything like this in arcades or amusement halls because this latest game from Naxat, ain't got no balls at all! Well, not silver metal ones at least! ANNOS The similarity to Devil Crash shows in the old-fashioned music and effects. Mr Peacock bonus stage! VERDICT AMEPLAY R 100REA It's simple and straightforward just like the real thing. There haven't been that many pinball games over the years and for good reason. Ever since Macadam Bumper hit the shores from France, I've been very wary of them all. Until Devil Crash on PC Engine, that is. Since then, Naxat has converted the original to almost every format! But this latest sequel is the first to make it onto the SNES and is rather uninspired. Bonus screens are accessed in a similar manner and the whole game has the feel of the original game under another name. Whilst fast and nicely animated with legions of monsters trolling around all over the table, the game is just a little dull, and the monotonous music and diabolic theme of the game make this a game that is for pinball wizards only... BALLS Use just three balls per game to smash around the table using the left/right flippers, plus the occasional little nudge to keep the ball in play just as you would on any normal table. But where video game pinball scores, the Crush series in particular, is by having lots of sprites moving onto the table and pottering around. Hit particular examples to get an increased bonus, a multiplier, a raised ramp, or to help keep the ball in play or start off a multi-ball play, Long term play will only appeal to pinball fans, Elton John or Roger Daltrey. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES GARTH SUMPTER JUST HOW DO YOU GET IT UP? O-NW ACIt's really easy to get to the top of the table in Jaki Crush and grab the big points. Here's the way to do it... MISS OK! HIT Blast the pilgrims that circle the temple out of the way, shoot through the gap and remember to keep the right button pressed to pass the upper flipper. Get the ball and trap it on this flipper. Shoot it across to the flipper on the right and trap it there. 61 "


"REVIEW MEGADRIVE by TAKARA .99| OUT: This month. Cartridge supplied by Sega on 071 727 8070 ZAMEM MEGADRIVE , PAKARA 20:22 FATAL THREE OF THE BEST You can't get away from he. Your end is near. Ha ha !! Inane banter to put the WWF to shame from Richard Meyer. FUS He is doing well but he can't use that meird Kung-Fu in the next hatch. Geese Howard offers his pearls of wisdom after each match. TEATERÉ Fatal Fury's trio of revengemotivated heroes may have squeaky-clean images, but they're as tough as anybody on Geese's side. Terry and Andy are both Karate kings and as such have similar fighting styles, although their special moves are unique Terry has moves like the Power Wave, Slam Attack and horriblesounding Knuckle Burn in his arsenal, while Andy's little tricks include the Dragon Bullet, Shotgun Kick and that old favourite, the Flying Punch. Joe Higashi is a whole different kettle of sushi, having been trained in the little-known art of Mu-e-tai and dispensing special moves like the Slash Kick and Machinegun Punch to anyone who gets too big for their boots. In the two-player game, any character can be pitched against itself, with its \"double\" set against a different COTOU re d background. That way, both players indulge in contests with equal odds. STREETFIGHTER II FACES STIFF OPPOSITION... outh Town's a nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live there. No, forget it it's not even a nice place to visit. In fact it's the seediest hellhole of corruption, violence and villainy in Videogamesland. And it's all the fault of Geese, Howard, the evil king of the city who rules with an iron first. The cad. One thing Geese didn't count on, though, when he murdered a young martial arts expert all those years ago, was that the fighter's two sons would come back for revenge once they were old enough. That time is now, and with the brothers SUBWOXY Terry and Andy Bogard teaming up with fellow chop-socky expert Joe Higashi, they're about to enter South Town's King of Fighters tournament, organised by Geese, to take down the main man. Only the most brutal army of headcases ever assembled stands in their way... It's best not to tackle Richard Meyer in the air, but it hasn't put Terry off. ROUND The once-aged Tung Fu Rue transforms when the going gets tough. EURMEE Is Andy any match for the gigantic Raiden? ON THE OTHER HAND SUBURY OSHOP! BREAKFAST DINER INT STREETS OF RAGE 1/2 The original and the recent sequel are among the best Sega beat'em-ups. But neither compare too well to Fatal Fury they're both fighting games but styles are very different. In two-player mode you beat each other up providing the long-term laffs. Duck King puts the boot init's too late for Terry to block. REVIEWED: CVG No 135 62 "


"VERDICT MEGADRIVE Joe Higashi shows off his kickboxing skills to Andy Bogard. While Megadrive owners have plenty to shout about in the progressive beat'em-up stakes with the excellent Streets of Rage games, they've always been given a bit of kicking in the one-on-one Streetfighter genre. Fatal Fury goes some way to levelling the score, with fighting action to rival Capcom's classic in many areas (namely speed, impact and variety) and plenty of original fighters and special moves. Those games-bible thumping purists will undoubtedly prefer Streetfighter II, but I'd go for this one if torn between the two it's the progressive theme, funky music and endless options that makes it for me. Worth giving a try — it should fill the gap nicely before Sfil or the much-hyped Mortal Kombat arrives. 1 PAOPAO CAFE The Paopao Cafe is the favourite haunt of Richard Myer, a gigantic karate master who excels in the air with a variety of flying moves, including one where he uses his legs like helicopter rotor blades! This bears no resemblance to Chun-Li's Spinning Bird Kick, of course. PROS: Special moves and a funky soundtrack make a potential Streetfighter-beater on Sega. CONS: Too easy for hardened beat'em-up vets, thus shortterm appeal. Japanese text. GARY WHITTA 2 THE WEST SUBWAY Try to catch a train down here and you're bound to bump into Duck King -a punk with baggy MC Hammer-style trousers and a nice line in attacks. He just flies at you like a human cannonball and has a similar effect. GRAPHICS Well-defined, animated and varied sprites, but garish colour schemes are off-putting. NICE PRESENTATION! Fatal Fury has an advantage over Street Fighter II in its smart presentation, Not only do you get loads of options you can change match rules and joy pad controls to your heart's content but it also raises a laugh or three with its unintentionally-funny graphic sequences between matches. After a fight, the winner says something hopelessly sad like, \"Now you know why Karate is so frightening!\", while in the King of Fighters game, Geese himself pops up, immaculately dressed in his designer business suit, after each player victory to offer some corny comment on your progress. 3 SOUND BEACH Michael Max hangs out around the sand dunes and luscious babes, where a rigorous workout regime has made him one of Fatal Fury's toughest customers. As he's an excellent boxer, all his most dangerous moves are punches. ONNOS Thumping good soundtrack throughout, and the odd bit of speech. SOUTH CITY A NICE PLACE TO LIVE A lightning tour through some of South City's more interesting locations and the baddies you'll find there... BIKING OF FIGHTERSE GAMEPLAY Who could ask for more? Highimpact fumpin' action at its best. One of Terry's secret moves the Shield of Force hits Raiden with full power. PAO PAO CAFE PAO PAO CAFE THE WEST SUBUAY HOWARD AREHA One-player mode won't last long, but it's tops if you've got a pal. Over at Geese Howard's house, Duck King is polished off by Tung Fu Rue. GEESE BUILDING STRATEGY SKILL SUBWAY DREAM AMUSEMENT PARK SOUND BEACH ACTION REFLEXES 8 9 Lanky Richard Meyer uses his 'copter-legs against our Terry, ONWA00 IIIIIIIIIII VERDICT 4 DREAM AMUSEMENT PARK Home of Raiden, an absolutely HUGE fairground attraction you've got to be perfect to beat him! Geddit? Seriously though, folks, watch out for his mysterious Killer Fog. MISS OK HIT I've never really been a fan of Fatal Fury, either on Neo Geo or in the arcade. In my eyes it just didn't cut it when it came to gameplay, Although this version stands head and shoulders above the SNES incarnation, I still can't give it any more than a slight pat on the back and a gold star for it's efforts. There's just a distinct lack of depth to the gameplay, which, despite the nice graphics and smart sound, just doesn't make it a worthy purchase. Best wait for Streetfighter II really. 5 HOWARD ARENA In this deserted stadium resides Tung Fu Rue, a doddery old king fu crumbly who's got more than a few tricks up his sleeve as soon as he takes a few knocks, he transforms into a musclebound hulk with incredible strength and meaness to boot!

BLUE ENTRY DAS Possible Captured 11 L Captured a Dan HALI Possible Captured 20 L an Ten The deathslide of doom. Is that one of the Ghostbusters, or what? SURVEILLANCE SET-UP NIGE BLUE :55 KITCHE Possible Captured 5 L ien 1) CURRENT VIEW SCREEN:Where all the action takes place. 2) ACCESS CODE: It operates the traps. Incorrect code? Then the traps are inoperable, matey! 3) TRAP SENSOR: Shows activity in the room. When the sensor | hits red you can trap the Vampire. 4) HIDDEN CAMERA VIEWS: There are the eight different camera, views inside the house. 5) CURRENT ROOM VIEW:Shows which room you are currently in. 6) COUNTERS: The counters show you how many Orgues have entered the house and how many have been captured. 7) SURVEILLANCE TIME: This shows you how much of the mission time has elapsed. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN ull-motion, interactive video has been the aim of each and every producer of CD ROM games, but no-one has managed to get even close to it yet. Night Trap is the latest, and quite possibly the greatest, effort. You're cast as a member of the SCAT (Sega Control Attack Team) force. There is a house full of people mainly smart girlies — who are being attacked by vampire-type beings, known only as Orgues. Your mission is to protect them at all costs. Your undercover agent in the house goes by the name of Kelli Medd although it's really Kimberly from Different Strokes and she'll be trying to keep you up-to-date with all the latest goings on in the house. There are eight different surveillance cameras dotted around the house, to help you keep a watchful eye Don't screw up, or all those top girlies will be gone forever. . . The Vampires are a difficult bunch to catch. Not only do you have to nab them in the right place, but you also have to find them at the right time and only spring the Vampire trap when the sensor hits the red mark. On entering a room your sensor will flash, indicating activity in the room however, not all activity indicates the presence of Orgues, a little bit of activity doesn't necessarily mean that there's an Orgue around: people also set the sensor going crazy So you have to watch what's going on. The sensor will only stay in the red for a couple of seconds, and if you miss your chance you won't be able to trap the Vampire but will have to try and locate him in a different room and catch him there. "


"WATCH IT, GIRLS! VERDICT MEGA CD The Orgues enter the house. The main selling point of Night Trap is obviously the huge amount of full-motion video included (Sega claim it's over an hour-and-a-half, but we've yet to see). But the obvious worry is whether or not there will be any gameplay in there. Is there? Hard to say really. I mean, Night Trap is definitely a good laugh; there's always something going on in the house, and it's all good fun to watch there's even a supposed girlie in the shower scene included but we've yet to find out just where it is. But, to be honest, there really isn't a massive amount of game here. It's just a case of writing down the times and places and going through them, which really isn't much fun. Consider thoroughly before you part with forty odd quid. The women leg it upstairs. PROS: The full motion video footage is totally absorbing. A really novel idea that's quite fun. CONS: No real depth of gameplay. No password system to let you continue from the second disc. The bedroom girls, quick! PAUL ANGLIN Listen closely I will say this only once.. YOO HOO! I'LL MAKE YOU FAMOUS RAPHIPS Pretty smart video footage, but looks very pixellated in places. \"Coming; ready or not!\" Some good little incidental tunes let down by rather crackly sounds. Trap these two. ONNOS No expense has been spared getting the feel of motion video. Instead of chucking anyone in the game, Sega has got a load of dead 'famous people and given them starring roles well one of them anyway! The only face that you'll recog. nise instantly in Night Trap is that of Dana Plato of Different Strokes fame! You know, the one that plays or rather DID play Kimberly. The others seem to be unknowns from the world of acting, but there are one or two faces in there that I'm sure I've seen before. The only thing that isn't quite up to scratch are the Vampires themselves they have to be THE cheapest monsters in Cinematic history. They're just people in black suits wobbling around a lot: what a laugh! The girlies re-group. GAMEPLAY OK. There's very little to actually do, but it's all good fun. 18% The Orgues are back. Provided you don't get bored, it's going to be a while before you finish this. Things have taken a turn for the worse. The lay is a good hiding place... STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 8 There's nothing like sharing a shower. The sensor's not high enough yet, just wait... ...But there's more downstairs. VERDICT OOLONTO IIIIIIIIIII THAT'LL DO NICELY ITT MISS OK! HIT The trapping devices are very complex. So nobody else can gain control of the system, the house-owners, the Martin family, have set a series of special access codes, which must be used to facilitate the use of the traps. Each code is represented by a colour which always starts off as blue, and changes at set times and specified locations. Use the wrong code and traps are inoperable. All of the motion video takes place in real time, meaning that the action occurs whether or not you're at an actual spot. If you don't know when and where the code changes, you could end up in some serious trouble! Nightrap opens the doors for the future when instead of having film licenses and writing a game that just uses the name, you'll actually have the film on your console for you to control the actions of the characters!! Unfortunately, what you see here is the first attempt and whilst it's no Spielberg epic, it is entertaining in parts with more than a little humour used for some of the more bizzare traps. But at the end of the day, this type of film action game reminds me of Space Ace and Dragon's Lair. Both of them had trouser-moistening graphics of incredible quality, but the gameplay was just a question of hitting the button at the right time. The Mega CD has extended this limitation, but as yet, not quite far enough. GARTH SUMPTER "


"PORALEM REVIEW BY DATA EAST 290. MEGADRIVE MEGADRIVE by DATA EAST .99 OUT Now. Thanks to Data East for the cartridge. USHIA PROS: You could always use the box to prop up your wonky table Hope you don't suffer from vertigo, pal. STREETFIGHTER II? Fed up with people asking you what the controls are? Now you don't have to! Captain America And The Avengers features a training mode, in which you are pitted against one of your fellow Avengers in a one-on-one battle, Streetfighter Il style. As well as being a damned good laugh, this means that you get the chance to hone your skills before mixing it with the real tough lads. CONS: Everything about this game is completely sad. 'Ave some of that! Badly drawn sprites hover around the screen. CAPTAIN AMERICA Terrible music, backed up by tragic spot effects. AND THE AVENGERS There's a fiver to anyone who finds any gameplay whatsoever. Crap and boring, with nothing to drag it from the bottom of the barrel. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 THERE'S THE GOOD NEWS AND THERE'S THE BAD NEWS... HURRAHL EQUAL kay, I have some news for you, good and bad. The bad news is that the notorious super-villain, Captain America originally hit the Red Skull, has stolen the most powerful, mindcomic book scene in the early controlling device ever designed. The good news is 1950s, and was created to be the that Captain America is on the case! With the this pow American mascot for antierful and mysterious weapon, Red Skull's plans to Communism. Everybody has their fave Communists; here's ours: control the world may come to fruition. Captain Randy: Fidel Castro's top boy 'cos America and his band of Avengers have been called he gets all the best cigars for nowt upon to dispatch the evil minions of Red Skull and what a spawny get! restore peace to the planet, in the name of truth, jusGary: My fave is Pol Pot, 'cos he has a name with the word Pot in it. tice and...whatever the other one is.

"AMIGA by ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 OUT May. Contact Electonic Arts on 0753 546672 TREVLEKANGALY LECTRONICAMISETAS DESERT STRIKE LONI Armour! NOW PAY ATTENTION. Seeing as the desert is such a big place and it's all covered in sand, it can be difficult to tell one part of it from another, so you'll need to use your map to find your way around. Your helicopter is displayed as a red cross on the map, and everything else shows up as well. All the different Campaign objectives are displayed on the map in the order you must complete them. Also on the map are the pick-ups you need for the mission, such as fuel and ammunition. Pick-ups will only show on the map if they are visible, so if something is hidden in a building it won't be displayed. It'll take five full campaigns to win the war; you start by simply knocking out the communication dishes so you can safely locate the secret agent, who's so secret that noone knows where he is! Time is running out get to it! Get the drift? You'd better get out of there fast! slavingay and he mi The madman plots his his mischief. VERDICT SUPER-SLICK AND ADDICTIVE THE GULF WAR BREAKS OUT ONTO THE AMIGA. There's nothing like a war to get software programmers slaving over their special programming machines day and night. And that rather brief episode of slaughter in the Middle East certainly gave EA a solid platform for one of their best shooters yet. Some Middle East dictator has taken over a large section of the desert and begun to develop all sorts of things, ranging from SCUD missile launchers tochemical weapons factories. Not only that, he has also gone and taken hostage a load of your pals from the Air Force and is using them as a human shield. You've had enough; the time has come to kick his ass. And you're so hard, you're gonna do it all on your own! 74 Amiga owners have definitely got something to scream about this month the graphics on their version of Desert Strike are better than those on the SNES or Megadrive! Sadly though, this hasn't been achieved without some compromise. The main problem with Desert Strike is that the game just does not move fast enough for my liking. The whole essence of the game is controlling a super-slick, ultra-quick, death-dealin' chopper, and a lot of the exhiliarating feeling is lost when the controls become sluggish. Cycling through the weapons can also get a bit frantic. Although, having said all that, Desert Strike is still worth looking at if you're a fan of the Megadrive version. Just don't expect it to be particularly nippy! PAUL ANGLIN "

CONS: The chopper doesn't shift around the screen quite as quickly as it should do. SCORE 326386 STATUS MAP MISSION Counters: Keep track of everything from fuel level to how many MIAs you are carrying. Status: Shows how far through your current campaign you are. Mission: This shows all the objectives which you are required to meet in your current campaign MIA is one of the grimmest things about a war. It means that a particular soldier is Missing In Action. Very probably he's dead, but the government don't yet want to confirm it. However, the MIAs in Desert Strike are alive and kicking and will give you an unending amount of help. The lads are dressed in khaki uniforms, if you manage to pick one up and drop him off at the landing zone, you will be awarded extra armour points! It's well worth flying around and collecting a load of soldiers at the beginning of a mission so that, as soon as your armour gets critically low, you can top it up immediately. BRAPHICS Brilliantly drawn, clear sprites with some excellent detail. This shows what you're currently viewing on the map screen. This is your Frigate. You may only retum here once you have completed your mission Some pretty impressive tunes and some great spot effects. LITTER LOUTS Litter is getting ridiculous these days. I mean, dropping the odd sweet wrapper when you're in town is one thing, but lobbing ammunition crates and fuel drums around the desert is another thing entirely. But, as they say, \"one man's loss is anothe's gain,\" and that's certainly the case in Desert Strike. The ammunition crates and fuel drums strewn around the landscape are priceless to your progress. When you get into the later levels, you will notice that pick-ups do not appear on the map. On these levels it's worth flying around, blowing up all the buildings so as to uncover as many items as possible for later use. Involving and addictive gameplay, marred by a sluggish control method. We have lift-off. Quick, hit the pipeline to stop the oil spill. Armour! Weeks of blasting ahead of you and plenty more even after completion. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Great mushroom clouds! VERDICT LLLLLLLLLLLL ONWA Take out the power station to reveal the hidden armour. Hellfires Armed The Megadrive version of Desert Strike was an excellent product and so well received by reviewers and punters alike that it quickly became a hit. The Amiga version of this ace Gulf War blaster is now here and stirke me with a Hellfire missile if isn't stacked to the rotor blades with the same great detail and graphics! It's all there and amazingly contained on just three disks but the price of this excellence is that it needs a full iMb to run, so grab that upgrade now! Unfortunately, the amount of detail that's been squeezed in has had a bit of rearguard action on the speed of the game, but thankfully playability isn't affected. Amiga Desert Strike is a must if you don't own the Sega machine. MISS OK HIT You'll need a lot of fire power to take that out GARTH SUMPTER 75 "

WING UIT THIS GAME IS THE CLOSEST THING YOU\"LL EVER GET TO A REAL STAR WARS DOG FIGHT ed by the utterly evil Emperor Palpatine and his right-hand man, ex-Jedi Knight turned traitor, Lord Darth Vader, the Empire controls most of space. All that stands between Palpatine and total domination of the star systems is the Rebellion, a ramshackle band of heroes, intent on bringing the Emperor's vicious reign to an end. Scattered throughout the galaxy, the Pilot Assignment Rebels have lost more battles than they have won, but now the tide is slowly beginning to turn. The Rebels' numbers are Flight Group 1 of 3 increasing day by day, Pilot Roster and their starfighter technology has reached new levels of sophistication. Now is the time for them Page 1 of 1 to go on the offensive. 76 Just one of the many bitmapped animation sequences. use this feature you'll find yourself too busy attempting to stave off the attacks of TIE-Fighters, Imperial Star Destroyers and the like but press 'C' during the game and you'll activate the in-flight camera, which not only records everything in real-time, but also lets you watch the action from any of the spacecraft involved in that mission, from any angle that Like all modern flight simulators, X you choose! Wing doesn't confine you to the inside of your craft; hitting F3 on your keyboard gives you an outside-the-cockpit view, and pressing any of the buttons on the numeric keypad alters the angle from which you look at the ship.

"ON A WING AND A PRAYER Rebel forces have three types of starfighter at their disposal, each designed to perform a different function. X-WING Created by Incom, the design team which defected to the Rebels from the Imperium, the X-Wing has become the most widely used craft in the field. An excellent all-rounder, the X-Wing combines superior targeting systems with powerful weaponry and Engines (4) Inicom 4.4 fusial thrust hyperspace capability. Roted ot 200 KTU The medical ship escorted by an X-Wing. IT'S A-MAZE-ING! This long-range fighter-bomber is normally seen travelling alongside XWings on a mission, more so than ever now that the Imperium has perfected its new TIE Interceptor. Although slow and sluggish to control, the Y-Wing is one of the more formidable attack craft available, due to its wide array of weapons and powerful shields. Laser Connons 22 Taim & Bax X5 single fire or tire-liked Too many potentially good star-pilots have become yet another statistic, simply because they were too eager to get out there and do their bit for the Rebellion without first getting to know how their ship works. That's why Rebel Command constructed 'The Maze'. In this simple training exercise, the player must guide his fighter around a spiralling maze, flying through the specially constructed gates. There's a time limit in operation, and to complete the training exercise all the gates have to have been negotiated before the seconds run out. Not only that, but there are also small detonation devices located close to some of the gates shoot at these to improve your aim. At the end of the day, you'd be wise to complete The Maze; if you don't, you could find yourself just another sitting target. A-WING The latest in the Rebel Alliance's array of nippy, powerful attack craft, the AWing fighter is one of the fastest starfighters available rumoured to be capable of out-running even the Empire's TIE Interceptors! There are drawbacks, however, weaponry is not the most powerful ever, and there are unconfirmed reports of A-Wings suddenly losing power for no reason, sometimes when in the middle of an Imperial attack! Laser Commons (2) Eorstel RGS (single fire or fire-linked THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK The Rebels aren't the only fellers clogging up the spaceways if they were, there would be little need for a rebellion in the first place. Emperor Palpatine's Imperial forces have turned out in force to 'greet' the goodies in a vast array of different fighters, bombers, freighters and starcruisers. Being the hardest blokes in the cosmos, the Empire isn't made of chocolate when it comes to dishing out the firepower; most of their craft are heavily armed and Imperial pilots are pretty good shots. Here are the adversaries you're most likely to tangle with: 1/8: CAHHA 1 TIE STARFIGHTER The primary attack craft of the Empire, the TIE Starfighter is fast, manoeuvrable and loaded with firepower. While not as powerful as Rebel ships, TIE Starfighter pilots fight in far greater numbers and aren't averse to the odd kamikaze run now and again. DIS: 0.07 HULL DHC DO 100 1308 11:55 One more blast and that TIE Bomber is history. VERDICT TIE INTERCEPTOR Based on plans devised by Darth Vader for his own customised TIE Starfighter, the Interceptor is a faster, more powerful and better-armed version of the original. Arguments continue as to which is the nippiest ship: the Interceptor or new Rebel AWing? I was expecting X-Wing to fall short of the hype and, for a while, thought I'd been proved right it seemed too easy and devoid of enemies. Then I stumbled across the option that allowed me to change my Tour Of Duty and found the screen jam-packed with baddies! X-Wing is easy to learn yet unbelievably hard to master. It looks and sounds great, too; even better when you run it on a more powerful PC. X-Wing does slow down a little on a bog-standard 386, but that's forgivable because the game itself is a dream! un TIE BOMBER Slow and cumbersome, the TIE Bomber is a nonetheless formidable foe, especially when flying defence missions. Heavily armed, the Bomber is usually escorted into battle by a squadron of TIE Fighters, which keep Alliance craft busy while the Bomber pinpoints its target and launches its deadly arsenal PAUL RAND "


"SAD FOLK START HERE \"Sort yourself out if you're stuck here like a lonely bit of plop! This is one tough cookie to crack when you start out, and you'll get nowhere fast if you don't bother to train. So forget about tussling with the Empire for a while and get yourself straight over to The Maze for flight training a bit sharpish!\" NOW, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER run Each si pare ne WING GARTH PROS: This is the closest you'll get to Star Wars dogfighting short of inventing a time machine and sending yourself a thousand years into the past! CONS: If your PC is a bog-standard machine, you could feel a little cheated. \"You've sorted out your flying and shooting skills now it's time to tackle a Tour Of Duty. The first A New Ally is ideal for all young pilots, as it starts out fairly easy and gets tougher as you go. Choose invincibility mode if you still feel a little shaky.\" DOGSTAR FIGHTING AT LAST, YOU'RE WELL' ARD! GRAPHICS Excellent, but big craft cause slowdown on lowend machines. Hurrah! Direct hit on that troublesome TIE Bomber. \"Hey, I won! Turn off those infinite weapons and shove yourself slapbang into the thick of the third Tour Of Duty!

Well worked-out learning curve and loads of missions. Yes you can, and the view from behind confirms it. The camera mode lets you view your finest moments, like this attack on an Empire freighter. Why use laser cannon, when a torpedo will do? A long-lasting challenge is guaranteed with this one. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 Yeah! Right on the thruster! Way to go! A view from the cockpit here, as torpedoes are switched off and lasers are used to finish the job. Unfortunately, Rand forgot to pull away, and smashed into the freighter. The sad man. Close-up of the X-Wing instrument panel, betterthan an GTi any day! ONWAOOOO IIIIIIIIII VERDICT HIT The force is strong in this one! X-Wing is out of this world as a game and a joy to behold, if you've got the hardware to run it. It's one of the most progressive flight sim shooties I've ever come across and even battle-hardened space pilots will find themselves going back to flight school as they change missions and craft as they make their tour of duty. Controls are excellent, although the keyboard commands will take some time to become familiar with.but it's well worth the wait.

"TREVEWI by PSYGNOSIS .99 OUT: Now. Contact Psygnosis on 051 709 5755 TALES OF THE TALISMEN IAL The main thing is to collect as many pieces of the Talisman as possible. There are three different types to collect: Gold, Silver and Bronze. The award depends upon how many Lemmings are saved on each level. If just a few Lemmings are still alive, then a Bronze piece is awarded. If you save almost all of the tribe, then a Gold piece is given; Silver falls between the two. All three awards are pieces of the main Talisman though. PROS: A brilliant puzzle game which is everything that a good game should be: something of rare quality. CONS: None, other than it's likely to keep you up all night glued to the screen! I think that Stomper's going to come unstuck in a minute. The rodents are back — with a vengeance... GRAPHICS Nothing special, just nicely drawn backdrops and outrageously cute Lemmings. Some pretty dodgy tunes are just about rescued by good samples. he Lemmings have returned! Since the last time we saw them, the Lemmings have set up a number of different tribes, and are living happily and peacefully. That was until the secret of the Talisman was revealed. The Talisman tells of great destruction coming to the Lemmings' homeland. They must evacuate now! But who will guide them to safety? The same person that obliged last time of course you! GAMEPLAY Hellishly addictive, supremely enjoyable and bloody hard! Man Boots Select a skills to practice Nou choose your trike. Sreco Hedieval Corpionfolar Months of rescuing Lemmingss assured — as you get to grips with the new game. 2 STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 10 I don't know what he's trying to achieve with that bazooka. Use the cannon to propel the Lemmings to the other side. 1111 ONWA000 VERDICT Ummu TRIBAL TRIBULATIONS  MISS OK HIT Psygnosis had its work cut out in trying to follow up on one of the most successful puzzle game of all time. Luckily though, Psygnosis have gone and done themselves proud once again. Lemmings 2 combines all the features of the brilliant prequel and adds even more depth to the addictive and challenging gameplay, Mastering all the different skills of the new Lemmings will take you ages, but the game play is just so enjoyable, that you're guaranteed to keep trying until you rescue the lot. Excellent stuff! Things have certainly changed for the Lemmings. There are now 12 different tribes of them, living in harmony on Lemming Island. The various tribes all have different backgrounds, which range from Space Lemmings, to the Highland Lemmings. Between them, they have a total of 60 new attributes. Space Lemmings use backpacks and lasers, Sports Lemmings pole vault over walls, and so on. Mastering the different characteristics will take ages, so there's plenty of game there. PAUL ANGLIN "


"LREVIEW by THE SALES CURVE .99 QUT Now. Thanks to Data East for the cartridge. SUPER NES SUPER Famicom Nintendo COB BCR ANOTHER VERTICALLY-SCROLLING SHOOT'EM UP ON SUPER NES? WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THIS ONE? -> PAYTACTE Racin'cross the desert! PROS: One of the fastest, busiest and most action-packed blasters we've seen SE 88 ood question, even if I do say so myself. The fact is, almost everything about Super SWIV has been seen and done before. Just when we thought we'd seen the last of the 'fly-up-the-screenand-blow-everything-up' genre once and for all, along comes another one, this time converted from the Amiga chart-topper of a couple of years back. Though it's still viewed as the best of its kind on Amiga, SNES owners understandably expect a bit more from a shoot' em up these days does this conversion deliver the goods? Or is it just crud? HERPA CONS: No continues The big guns are deadly. So shoot them. Lovely and clean. Better than the Amiga originals. GRAPHICS SUPER SWIV Nice title screen music, but the rest is average. GAME What can we say? Nobody does it better. D-D-D-D-DEJA VU! What's Super SWIV got that the others haven't? Well, a level of carnage that surpasses just about everything else in its killing field. Forget about the naff storyline about aliens stealing military technology from around the world all we're interested in here is KILLING THINGS and Super SWIV does it with a supreme amount of excellence. As you'd expect, the object is to blast your way toward, the big bad guardian at the end of each stage, polish him off and progress to the next level. So far so predictable. And it doesn't stray much from this path, either, so the action had better be good. You might get bored before you finish. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Knock out the camouflage guns fast! IT'S VERY HARD VERDICT Okay okay, we've seen it all before, but Super SWIV deserves credit for having a go anyway and coming out better than most other games in the genre. It's super-smooth, well-polished, looks lovely and the difficulty level, though seemingly totally unforgivable at first, is set just right. The dual-vehicle option makes Super SWIV an absolute must to anybody who fancies a top-notch blast, particularly if you have a mate to join in the fun. Amiga SWIV was tops; on SNES, this is one of the more impressive blasts doing the rounds of late check it out! It certainly is. Super SWIV is packed to the gunnels with rock-hard baddies and, although the landscape is chock-full of power-ups, shields and other bonuses, you'll have to be as hard as nails if you're even going to get past the first level. The lack of a continue option doesn't help, but there are plenty of extra lives available to those who know where to look during play.. 00 TITILITIET TI MISS OK HIT GARY WHITTA Uh-oh: big, end-level nasty coming up! 82 "

"REVIEW by ACTIVISION .00 SNES RUPER Famicom intendo Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500445) for the review cartridge. PROS: Excellent atmosphere created by brilliant graphics and great sound. erras is a bit peeved at the systematlic slaughter of all his living relatives, courtesy of the Dark Wing Lance. So, for ten years he's honed Mechwarrior skills. The Mechs are hulking great fifty-foot exoskeletons used to blow hell out of anything that crosses their shadow. Herras, however, has a different use in mind for the Mechs to wipe out the Dark Wing Lance! CONS: The action becomes too repetitive, as well as too easy. HOT HEAFans TATUSIUE We woli A pleasant pastoral scene is one of the many scenarios. Impressive use of 3D creates the world of mech combat. PI Tag TIPSETISESHOP TIREOGRZEDTRENURUL HERE BATTLETECH INNOS Brilliant music with some well 'ard explosions all over the shop. VERHOODIES MONEY MATTERS THE MECH THAT JACK BUILT GAMEPLAY Brilliant to start with, but flaws become apparent later on. No matter how hard your Mechwarrior may be, you will eventually get a bit of a kicking, courtesy of the evil minions. Luckily though, there is a Mech spare part shop just It won't be too long before this gets shelved. As you need as much money as possible to finance your fight against the Dark Wing Lance, you'll have to take as many contracts as you can get. If you go to the GHQ icon, you will see a range of contracts all varying in difficulty and, of course, amount of pay. Cash for each contract is negotiable; if you're not being offered enough, go to the money screen and haggle with the company that's made the offer. Usually they will pay you a fee just above the original offer. However, not all companies will increase their offer the tight gets! The city's clear of Mechs, so go home and put your feet up! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES MISSION COMPLETE 10 Things are getting a bit tricky now.. around the corner. However, fixed bits do not come cheap. You can find yourself in a bit of a rut if you get seriously damaged early in the game you need money to perform emergency repairs on your suit, but have to execute a contract before you can earn the cash! It's a vicious circle but that's business! 8 FTUUR VERDICT O-NW MISS OK! HIT No-one knew what to expect from Battletech. The screenshots looked great, but the 3D perspective looked way too ambitious. Whereas the graphics have been pulled off, the gameplay falls too short. It's brilliant fun at first and the action really draws you in until you realise how repetitive it gets. All the scenarios are too similar and it's too easy to get bored. If you purchase short range homing missiles you can run around blasting the cack out of everything and finish it in no time. Something of a wasted potential, methinks. THE HEAT IS ON! The different missions require you to travel to different parts of the solar system and, like all good galaxies, each planet has a different climate, so you'll have to take the heat, as it were. The engines, thrusters and weapons that you can equip yourself with all generate heat. So, to stop the suit from overheating on hotter planets, you'll need to install heat sinks, to help regulate the temperature of the suit. But, all things said and done, you don't really need to bother with engines and the like anyway! 73 PAUL ANGLIN 85 "


"REVIEW by TAITO .00 SUPER NES OUT: May. Thanks to Console Plus (0532 500 445) for the cart. SUPER Famicom Mindende SMACKERAMA! Blue fireballs of Doom! Sonic dishes out a good kicking! Sonic (no relation to the blue hedgehog!) sets about his enemies with a vast array of spectacular moves. By walking up to the thugs he can jab away to his heart's content, but get in close, pushing the joypad towards a ruffian and he'll be dispatched in one of seven ways. Reduce villains to rubble with lightning-fast punches and fireball uppercuts, pick up slackers and hurl them towards their mates, knocking them bandy, or cut them down to size with the spinning whirlwind tornado punch Muhammad Alistyle! Sonic also has two extra special moves; the first is a spinning drill attack which throws his arms out like flails, felling all in his path, and the awesome 100 Mega Ton punch which clears the whole screen! PROS: Original and highly entertaining moves. Great sound and visual effects. CONS: Not a lot of variety. More use should have been made of the other joypad buttons. Dish it out and take no prisoners. WEIRD BUT WONDERFUL Prepare yourselves for some weird and wonderful sound effects. Plenty of smacks, cracks, thumps and bashes are thrown in, as well as a liberal smattering of manic Japanese digitised speech! Sonic and his buddies are all brilliantly drawn and, even though the locations don't differ that much, there's enough variety in moves and enemies to keep you glued for quite a while. The shot says it all! SIIHd99 Big, bold sprites and cool backdrops are a treat for the eyeballs. Sonic Blast, man! UNNOS Zany tunes and impressive spot effects. Crazy Jap speech, too! SONIC BLAST MAN Initially brilliant, but inevitably becoming tiresome. CAM LOSE CONTROL! After a week, you'll only dig it out when your mates come round. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES You control the direction in which you throw enemies, but the actual attacking move is chosen almost by pure chance shame. Most of the action takes place in the streets, but there are three bonus levels which have you hammering the pad's buttons to punch various big baddies into submission. DOES THIS COIN-OP SMASH PACK A PUNCH ON SNES? hose off-the-wall Japanese are only famous for three things; electronics, cheap cars and sushi! But now you can add another item to that list; keraaazy cartoon and film characters. Sonic Blast Man is the latest mental Jappy japester to be turned into a console game and, although you've seen his face before in the arcades, our lad Sonic is about to explode onto your Super Nintendo! VERDICT 6,80 ONWA MISS OK! HIT Want a beat 'em up that'll give you a good chuckle and fuel your desire for bone busting action? Then you could do worse than take a look at Sonic Blast Man! Moves-a-plenty and lovely big sprites make this game a treat, but the title ultimately falls flat on its face by becoming so boring. After you've got used to the comical hero's various moves there's little left here to appreciate. The punching game is a nice addition, but hardly the same as smacking the coin-op's big cushion. Worth trying though, and maybe buying! Crab attack shatter shell! 79 STEVE KEEN He's big and she's tough, but are they strong enough? 86 "

"MEGADRIVE by SEGA .00 OUT: April. Contact Sega (071 727 8070) for information. Two-on-one and still holding his own. Flat on his bum and one to go. READY YOURSELF FOR A ROBOTIC RAMPAGE IN THE 23RD CENTURY! uring a leisurely cruise through space, the last thing you want to encounter is an asteroid belt. But that's just what's happened in Cyborg Justice and life's just about to take a further turn for the worse. Battered to bits, your craft crashes on a planet entirely populated by robots which kill yourself and your crew. The metal inhabitants manage to save your brain and implant it, Robocop-style, into one of their own labour droids. But, while trying to erase your memory, some part of your mind rebels and causes the robotic side of your body to malfunction. Now Unit 127 is out for revenge against its captors you've got some serious killing to do! JOYPAD JAPERY Cyborg Justice has more joypad combinations and moves than a triple jointed Russian gymnast! Here are the basics and let's hope that Sega don't make any cutbacks when it comes to explaining them in the manual! A Punch with special arm, hit twice to activate special weapons. B Throw cyborg/item. Drop cyborg/item and defend, hit twice to activate special leg transformation and manoeuvres. D Moves cyborg left, right into and out of the screen. Holding down C + Up jumps, Down crouches. E-Note: There are about 20 combinations of buttons and joypad for all kinds of attacking moves. WIDE OPEN SPACES Look out nasty coming! DOWN TO BASICS Although you'll be far more interested in destroying things, you can try your hand at tailoring the game to suit your needs. Lives, difficulty and controls can all be altered and, when the action's over, you will be awarded points for Technical Advancements, Brutality and Fair Play. Our advice is to whack the game up to Hard level almost straight away and dive headfirst in at the deep end! FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT There's not a lot to look at on each level and the planet seems to be more desolate than Rugby train station. However the Megadrive is constantly working overtime to produce a snazzy three-dimensional effect -not only can you trudge left and right but you can walk into and out of the screen as well! The sprites actually get smaller the further into the screen you go and bigger as you come forward. This effect has only really been seen before in Pitfighter, but here it's infinitely smoother and more slick! So Cyborg Justice looks good, but what about the sound? Well, you'll be more than pleased to note that there are over forty excellent sound effects to accompany the killing. The only drawback is the atrocious music that nearly drove everyone in the CVG office back to work as it polluted the speakers! You don't have to be Dr Frankenstein to build your own monster! Just dive into the selection screen for a sneaky peek at what the multitude of different spare parts can do. There are three sections to every robot arms, body and legs and you can choose from a huge bank of torsos and limbs, all with their own advantages and powers, to construct your own personal killing machine. You can apparently make up to 200 different monsters and take them into the Arcade and Duel sections for a scrap-tastic time! When two hard Auts meet, head on! "


"KWIK FIT FITTERS! Body slams ahoy! Move up the screen, out of the way. (Above) Anyone for a Whopper? VERDICT STEVE Here's my top boy in the robot arena: It's going to take a long time to get into, but once you're there it's definitely worth it. I haven't played anything this satisfying since SF2! The adrenalin really gets pumping as you leave piles of scrap metal in your wake! In simultaneous two-player mode the screen can really get cluttered, making it murder on the eyes, and the Duel mode's a little simplistic and not much of a challenge, but it's original and, above all, fun, especially the fab robotic animations. These guys are 23rd Century top boys check 'em out! It's up to you to pick up the pieces. 1 SAW HAND: Double press A to unsheath the deadly buzz saw and watch your opponent's parts fly off! 2 QUASIMODO BODY: Being a bit of a Quasi myself, this has to be the body for me! 3 TANK LEGS: By quickly pressing C twice ,your terminator transforms into a tiny powerful tank. Max damage potential! STEVE KEEN (Below) We might have our hands full here. Whoever gets in first should win the bout. NICE WORK FATTY! Don't fancy wearing yourself out by walking through the levels, eh? Well, flick on the Duel option and you and a mate can smash each other to rubble in endless head-tohead scuffles. Don't worry if you're a bit of a loner, because there are limitless amounts of computer assassins to take on, too. There are no less than four skill levels to tackle and it won't take you long to realise that Easy and Normal aren't worth the sweat off of a mosquito's wedding tackle! However, pump up to Hard and Brutal for some great competition and wet your plastic pants with fear as the huge sprites rip you limb from limb! ANGLIN My vote goes to this terrific combo! OLAN CRUSHER HAND: Dead handy for scrapping. It also doubles as an egg whisk and Mother's Day present! BIG BOOSTER: Because I need all the help I can get! 6 SOMERSAULT LEGS: Double press C and you'll spin all over the place, wiping out oodles of your enemy's energy! THINGS FIRST Going down for the last time. Ok, you've landed on the planet's surface what are you gonna do now? The simple answer to that is FIGHT! After constructing a suitably armed, bodied and legged robot it's time to put it to the test, Arcade mode is the scrolling section of the game. Walk through level after level of marauding mechanoids, blasting them or literally pulling them to bits to get to the other side. All the levels are divided into three rounds and at the end of a level you'll have to combat the 'Super Bott,' a humon gous teflon-plated mother, kitted out with all kinds of lasers, flame. throwers and more moves than Gary Kasparov! The only things missing are the parallel bars "


"Now it's time for some payback. MEGADRIVE CYBORG JUSTICE W I W PROSA Fantastic animation and huge amount of moves. Tons of detail and nice small (HINSA touches. Some of the weapons and moves take frustratingly too long to pull off. WORLDS APART Five worlds and fifteen levels, that's what's ahead of you in Arcade mode. But it's not just the other mechanical wonders you've got to keep an eye out for, oh no! Once you've beaten up the robots on-screen there's no time to stand back and survey your handy work, because you're likely to get a rocket up your bum! Homing missiles track you down in-between the action, shooting onto the screen from either side at regular intervals. You can use these to your advan tage by standing in front of your next opponent, jumping over the shot and sending it flaming into the villain's belly! To make things even more interesting there are chasms to jump, paralysing spots, whirling blades, spikes and knives that shred your diodes! SPOILT FOR CHOICE Don't just stick to our choices, there are copious amounts of add-ons to try out. Try these on for size: GRAPHICS Just for the enormous amount of excellent anima. tion alone! FIRE SPRAY The quickest to LASER HAND A short, sharp power up, this sends out a bolt of powerful light that long jet of flames. destroys all it touches. LAUNCH HAND Comical, but effective. Throws your own armoured hand at the enemy. Don't worry, it comes back! Perfect sound effects for the action. Music's SUICIDAL! Flame grilled or medium rare? INSECT BODY: Doesn't NORMAL: The bog stanFROG BODY: One of the dard basher! Great for stranger torsos. Ever wanted quick jabs, hooks and allto look like an amphibian? round smashing! Now's your chance! but it's all that's separating you from death, so don't knock it! AVTdW9 Loaded with alternative gameplay and original moves. Keep at it and you'll soon have an extra hand! Long-lasting appeal and tons of mechanoid combinations. Get that buzz-saw buzzin'! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Take 'em in and spit 'em out! WHAT'S YOURS IS MINE! VERDICT ONWOO LILLLLLLU SOK HIT The first thing to hit you when you power up Cyborg Justice is the incredible animation of the robots. They move so fluidly you'd swear they were real. The only discrepancy is the rather flat look of the backdrops, but who cares when the fight action is this good? What puts Cyborg Justice head and shoulders above everything else of its kind is the humour; you show me another beat 'em up that lets you tear your opponents' limbs off and use them as weapons! An excellent title that breaths life into a weary genre. One thing's for sure, Cyborg Justice is packed full of juicy animation. There are so many moves it's amazing how they all fit into the joypad! Mash your opponents' faces in with upper-cuts, body slams, flying kicks, laser bolts and loads of others. You can even wrap your body around them and drain their energy or pounce up onto their shoulders and rip parts off em! As every hit lands, bits fly off in all directions and, if you can manage to tear off a robot part, you can keep it to chuck at the next unfortunate! PAUL ANGLIN 90 "

"by MINDSCAPE .99 NES OUT: May. Contact Mindscape (0444 246333) for information. PROS: The action is fairly challenging and, erm, that's about it. Reese gets to grips with a tinfoil T-800! CONS: Poor graphics and sound and bland gameplay. THE TERMINATOR Weak sprites (the T-800s look like they're made out of tinfoil) and backdrops. The music sounds like a shaving foam advert, and the effects are, frankly, poo. GAMEPLAY Not bad, but there are plenty of frustrating jumps and other irritating bits. It's okay if you can be bothered to stick with it. Unfortunately noone here could. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 1064 FIGHT THE MOST SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY EVER ... ON SOME OF THE MOST OLD-FASHIONED! he film's been around for nine years, and the NES is almost as old, so why's it taken so long for one of the world's most popular films to arrive on one of the world's most popular formats? And more importantly, has it been worth the wait? Become crack commando Kyle Reese and take on the Terminators in an all-out fight to save the future! Seen a better Terminator game than this? ONWARDS The first thing of note is that although the game comes from Mindscape who did the SNES version, it's not really very much like its big brother' at all. Okay, so they're both platformy shooty type things, but there the simi larity ends. While SNES Terminator has got a bit of sophistication (albeit not much about it, the NES version is a primitive leap-and-shoot-and-not much-else affair that plays (and even looks a bit) like Mario with guns. Whether you're in 2029, fighting through the Skynet HQ, or back in 1984, shooting it out with Arnie on the streets of LA, the action' is much the Mind you don't fall down that hole same jump on the platforms, collect energy and bombs and shoot things until...

Unfortunately, The Terminator isn't a summary. Well tough luck because decent game. You really have seen ALL this I've got a word count to fill in the done before, and when you consider that it's year 2029, civilisation has been not a very faithful licence (why has the music been changed to an up-tempo jingle, and wiped out by a nuclear war blah blah, and now the few remaining why does Reese wear a Challenge Anneka humans battle for survival against tracksuit?), all you've got left is a boring platan invincible army of machines etc form game. Not totally worthless, but you've etc. As rebel hero Reese, you've probably got two or three games almost got to go back in time to 1984 to identical to this in your collection already. intercept the Terminator and... oh, you know all this already what's the game like, then?

This is his story... ONWOOC IIIIIIIII MITTTTTTT TUNTUITIUIT Controlling either Baloo or his pretty sidekick, Kit, Talespin is a massive arcade/adventure which takes the characters across a series of jungle and swamp-based stages with the ultimate aim being to reach and take part in an important air race and hopefully, scoop the grand prize. As is often the case, though, big is not always best, and at best Talespin is a very average game. There's certainly plenty to see and avoid, but there's nothing particularly exhilarating here to prompt further play. In all, there are eight different stages to explore, with a further six flying sections awaiting Baloo \"Turn left at the next junction Mr Baloo\". or Kit's exploration. Although all the old faves, such as Shere Kahn make cameo appearances throughout, even these aren't enough to keep you hooked.

Well, after a promising start with big, bold graphics and attractive enough sprites, Harley's Humongous Adventure is revealed as a rather tedious affair which rarely sets the pulse racing with non-stop frenetic excitement. Granted, Hi-tech have attempted to liven things up with the addition of different modes of transportbubbles and a jet-pack, for instance — but dodgy sprite detection and dull playability kill any lasting interest off far too early.

After skipping past the usual squillion options and team selection routines, Basketball reveals its court from what appears to be a dull side-ways on viewpoint. However, no sooner is the ball thrown in the air for a tipoff, then the pitch starts rotating all over the shop as the screen follows the player in possession. In addition to this stunning graphics, World League Basketball plays a pretty mean game, too. All the rules and features of the sport are there, including travelling and fouls, and these make for what is quite simply the most breath-taking sports game I have seen in ages.

Whilst Pugsley follows in Gomez's footsteps of leaping around the sprawling mansion, it's hard not to be impressed as he bounces on such weird things as toy ducks and arty farty disasters.

BATTLE MODE BATTLE MODE BA 15083 SPEGIL GUP REGE Koopa DOINS THE GOLD. GREET REC32 or most of you, Battle Mode'll be a bit of a laugh: it's a cruel and complicated sport. Here's a few pointers on how to smash your rivals into oblivion. OI! GIZZA LOOK One of the sneakiest features is looking at your opponent's screen. This means you can always detect his whereabouts, even if he's invisible. It'll make it more of a doddle to ram a shell into the back of his cart. THE GREAT ESCAPE If your opponent has a red shell, don't fear: all is not lost. At the very least try and avoid him by sticking close to the walls and goading him into firing them when you're cornering. If you are close enough to a corner, use a minijump to get around and out of his sights. You may be able to avoid it but you'll have to be quick if you don't want to be splattered. CAUGHT IN A TRAP A good way to send your opponent up the creek is to set up traps for him. Do this by firing a green shell into a confined area. The shell will bounce about like nobody's business, making a mess of the track. Make sure that you get out of there very quickly, though! 102 "

"FEATURE HELLAR AIDALLIANT THIS MAN HAS CHANCED THE FACE OF SUPER NES GAMING FOREVER Argonaut Software's Jez San looking suitably intense in his oftice in London March 1993. \"You haven seen a vrac tion of what the Super FX chip is capable of yet,\" he claims, and reckons Argonaut's next two SFX games will show more of what it can do. How did Super FX come about? We remember hearing rumours about a new superchip for the SNES at CVG quite a while ago... That's right. It nearly leaked out a while ago because it's hard to keep a big secret. What basically happened was, a few years ago when we had just started to work for Nintendo and signed up to do quite a few 3D games, we suggested to them the idea of doing a graphics accelerator chip. We've the Super FX chip in a great scrolling, always wanted to move into the hardware side of things, and were thinking about doing one on Amiga and NES, but then Nintendo steered us more towards What's the idea behind the the Super NES, because the Super FX? machine was just coming out. The chip took a year to get working, Well, the Super NES was and another year to get into prodesigned to play the type of games that Nintendo have duction, and that's where we are now. We were going to do 3D previously done and become games for Nintendo whether they famous for. It's built to do used the chip or not, \"Everyone will be using really well. It's got platform games but the fact is that lots of colours, the chip ended up quite good, so now great scrolling, all the games we're multiple playfields, A year or so.\" doing for them are great sound, good using Super FX. joypads... everything about it is built to do Mario type games, and it does them excellently. But that's just about all it can do, unfortunately. When Nintendo were designing the machine, they never thought about doing 3D polygon games, and by the time the really big 3D coin-ops like Starblade and Winning Run started to appear, the Super NES was already available. So, by adding extra power in the cartridge to do those functions, we now have the opportunity to produce the next generation of games for the existing hardware, rather than having to wait for the next system to appear. ...and it's all thanks to Super FX, the revolutionary microchip his company invented that makes the Super Nintendo perform the kind of mind-blowing graphical miracles that SNES gamers could previously only dream of. But what's the REAL story behind this piece of silicon wizardry? What can it do? And just how does it manage to be THAT sexy and hard? After being bowled over by the amazing Starwing last month, the first ever Super FX game currently setting the gaming world alight, CVG super-sleuth Gary Whitta tracked down Jez San and the Argonauts to find out the secrets of the black magic box... When you're writing games that revolutionise the world of console gamIng, constantly dealing with the Japanese and Americans and generally being a top man, it's not very easy to k ur desk tidy. 107 "


"game, or a regular Mode 7 game doesn't need it. You don't want to put an unnecessary cost on the cartridge by including a chip it doesn't need, so only games that require polygons or sprite rotation Did it take a lot of persuador texture mapping will want to use ing to get Nintendo to do a 3D it. I foresee a time when maybe game as a major product? 50% of all Super NES games use the chip, I don't think but that's the best they needed case scenario. door to much more persuading for them to do 3D games, because they know for the Super NES. 3D that that 3D is the future, and that it's a masWere there any sive market they've problems, working so closely with a big company like Nintendo? indeed, and it can also do things like rotate and scale sprites, texture-map sprite graphics onto 3D shapes... it can do all those kinds of things very quickly. And because it has a bitmap in the cartridge, it's removed all the limitations of the Super NES, which was previously a character-based machine. You see, in scrolling games, everything is made up of characters, or tiles, but 3D games need a bitmap system, which the Super NES doesn't have. So basically, Super FX opens the door to much more sophisticated graphics. 3D is just the beginning. \"Super FX opens the sophisticated graphics is just the beginning!» Meet the Starwing team from left to right, Carl Graham, Jez San, Pete Warnes and Krister Wombell, who all played an important part in the project. Fellow team members Dylan Cuthbert, Giles Goddard, Rick Clucas and Ben Cheese unfortunately couldn't join us round the Argonaut Pool table because they're in Japan working on the next Super FX game. So you're now producing the first Super FX games as well? Nintendo never do games unless they can appeal to most of the market. Although we in Europe can appreciate polygon-based games, the majority of Japanese gamesplayers don't really understand 3D at all. Nintendo wanted a game that everybody would enjoy, while we wanted to do the sort of game that we prefer, something like Starglider. So Starwing was kind of a compromise between a 3D game and a more traditional shoot' em up, and now we've done that introductory game to show everybody how wonderful 3D games are, we can do more sophisticated stuff like driving games and flight simulations. This Tron-like end-of-level baddy is a real killer, and only possible with Super FX by the way, look out for a full CVG player's guide soon! Yes, we're kick-starting the market with the first few games. After the market understands Super FX and sees what it can do, all the other developers will be using it. never been able to tap before and it steals territory from the PC games scene! But it was a risk for them to do it as such a massive project with so many people on it and the new hardware. Surely though, the Super NES doesn't need any help with things like sprite rotation and scaling, which it already does really well? Will the Super FX chip become a standard feature in all SNES games? So what does the Super FX chip actually DO, then? Er... no, because most games don't need it only games that need high technology graphics. A regular platform The SNES can only rotate a single screen. You can't have more than one object rotating at a time with the existing machine, but with Super FX you can have a hundred sprites, all rotating independently and all at different sizes and scales! No current console can do sprite rotation like this. The Mega CD does, but that's an expensive add-on. Basically, it's a power enhancer for the machine. It's a fast RISC microprocessor, which means that it can run programs very efficiently. It can do the maths behind 3D polygon graphics VERY quickly These destructible towers were taken from Starglider, Argonaut's most famous game. Look out for other Starglider references as you play! ANA 108 "


"This is where Starwing was programmed hard to believe, isn't it? of them. But it does take a long time to do it took us two years to produce the Super FX, and even if people want to do simpler chips, they'll take at least a year to develop, and that's a long time. We can enhance our own Super FX chip, too the chip that's inside Starwing is not the end of the line, we could do a lot more. It's just a question of how much time and money you want to spend. scrolling they'd rather use the standard in-built effects than try to come up with new ones. With the Super FX chip, because it's programmable, you can invent your own effects. Sure, it's harder to program than the average CPU, but good programmers can now create totally new effects that have never been seen before! I think it'll open up a massive new \"You haven't variety of games. seen a fraction of what the Super FX is Do you think other companies will try to produce their own custom chips, to keep up with the Super FX? What other technological developments do you see coming up? capable of yet!\" the Formula One and driving games on the Super NES use Mode 7 and so they all look the same-if they used the Super FX they could all be different, with unique scenery such as buildings, trees and the like. How much of a difference will the Super FX chip make to the future of Super NES games? What kind of games will we be seeing? We've heard rumours that Sega realise they are missing out on the Super FX and that they're designing their own one. Whether it comes out this year or next, I don't know, but it's bound to happen. Now that we've proved that it's possible to improve games by adding custom chips, I'm sure you'll be seeing a lot more The 32-bit CD machines, such as the 3DO which we already know about are now on the horizon, but there are other systems in the pipeline from the likes of Atari and Sony, along with Nintendo's own 32-bit adaptor. It'll be a very interesting time, and it'll be extremely interesting to see which manufacturers come out of the closet, as it were. I think you'll see some very unexpected people manufacturing 32-bit systems in the very near future.

"ANDAIRE RAN  Art Ed Jon always reads through all the letters and then gets Stuart Harrison to draw the pics for some of the sadder letters. We've included Jon's original instructions for the pics this month 'cos we think they're even sadder than some of the letters! HOMEWORK, SCHMOMEWORK! I just can't believe what a bunch of acne-ravaged nohopers you shower really are. Apart from the obvious problem of you all failing your GCSEs in English, you've also got the problem of having all the imagination of retarded dog turd. Which nicely brings me to a particularly sad individual who I've singled out this month. Yes, it's you, Shane Foxley! You sent me a picture of a dog called George with one eye and green spots. The chances of anyone ever meeting this sad and loathsome creature are nearly as low as any of you ever getting the better of me. So next time you're thinking of writing a letter to me, make sure it's got at least one sentence worth reading in it. And don't think you'll get your letter printed by starting with something lame like, 'Dear Yob, you're a load of crap' or ending with something lamer than Shane's dopey dog, like 'Please print this letter or my hamster_will kill you'. Give me something interesting to read next month or there'll be trouble. Send your rubbish to: MY LETTER ISN'T A LOAD OF COBBLERS, YOB'S MAILBAG, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE LONDON, EC1R 3AU. Dear YOB, At Christmas I asked my parents to buy me a Megadrive but instead they bought me a C64. They said they bought me this so I could do my homework on it but they never bought me a printer to print work. So they said 'It plays games, doesn't it?' Yes, but they usually don't load or if they do it takes ages. How am I supposed to persuade them to buy me a Megadrive? Help! NATHAN STREFFORD WORCESTER YOB: Could I just take this opportunity to tell any stupid parents out there that any of them that fall for a sales pitch that says you can do your homework on a C64 don't deserve kids and should have their reproductive organs removed. The best thing SOME KID PLAYINGA GAME WHILE HIS MUM +DAD FUME IN THE BACKGROUN? about parents like this is HG CAN BE WEARING ONE OF THOSE that if you own a couple, STUPID HATS THAT LOOK LIKE THIS. then you could also convince them that Super Star Wars on SNES is a useful revision aid for physics! 110 "

I got very upset and read BANGOR your February edition and laughed N IRELAND my bottom off.

In answer back to smashing my Spectrum up. to your questions: Hang on, I've got four questions 1) Yes. to ask. 2) No. 1) Have you got any money?

I would like to come over to that semidetached cardboard box you call home and blow it to bits. Here are some questions. 1. Where do you plug a keyboard in on the Super Nintendo? 2. Why haven't you got a brain? 3. Which is better, the X-Wing or Mario Kart? 4. Is the Atari Lynx better than the Game Boy? M DENNY LIVERPOOL YOB: If I'm such a worthless piece of plop why bother asking me questions? 1. In the secret keyboard slot. 2. Why haven't I got a brain? Why haven't I got a brain? I'm not the one asking where you plug a keyboard in on the Super Nintendo. 3. Well, seeing as the Encom T-65 X-Wing is a one-man space fighter which doesn't really exist except in the Star Wars movies and Mario Kart is a video game for the Super Nintendo, it's hard for me to answer that one. Have you got any other ridiculous comparisons you'd like me to make? Like 'Which is better, YOB, you worthless piece of plop, a Philips Softone 60W lightbulb or a Ford Fiesta 1.1L (A reg)?' See, it doesn't work, and I think we all now know who the worthless piece of plop is around here. 4. I'd say it was the new Ford Fiesta 1.1L. SKALLY WITH KEVIN KEEL PEEM TRYING TO MAKE W THA CONSOLES SGALLA 413 HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BUSINESS THE OBVIOUS WAY Dear YOB, After reading yet another crap review of Pit-Fighter I cannot stay silent any longer. Too many software companies produce a crap game and sell it by its license. Joe Public will probably see the game and anyone who hasn't seen a review will think, 'I liked the film/arcade game so I'll buy it.' They'll have wasted  on a total piece of crap. Software companies will make a lot of money this way because the gamesplaying public who read computer magazines (which is a large chunk) will see it got a good review and so buy it. This way they'll sell more copies and so make even more money. A prime example of this is Microprose. Practically every game they make is in the high 80s or 90s and so they sell a lot of copies and make loads of money. So come on software companies if you want to make more money make better games. STUART JACKSON (JACKSON) ST LEONARDS ON SEA YOB: It must have taken you ages to work out that priceless strategy for business success. I hope all you software companies are taking notice of Mr Jackson (Jackson)'s words of wisdom; produce good games and you'll sell more. Personally I think we have a potential Nobel Prize winner here.

It is an unwritten law of my society that no intelligent life-form throughout the expanding multiverse can match your wit and wisdom so I'm not even going to try. All ask is that your YOBness might spare a few precious seconds of your time and listen to my pathetic grovellings. 1) Do you (personally) think that the Mario campaign has gone too far? 2) What does the future hold for Mario and his pals? 3) What is your monthly salary? 4) (The number four is a holy number among the people and therefore no question is worthy of its designation) 5) When is your autobiography coming out in paperback? Yours plutonically, ANDREW MCPHEE AUSTRALIA YOB: And people wonder why I insult Australians. Dear YOB, I have recently purchased a copy of Indy Jones and the Fate of Atlantis on the Amiga. I know that the PC version is a graphic adventure and I know that Indy Jones and the Last Crusade is a point 'n' click. Could I ask you if Indy Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is a point 'n' click or a beat 'em up that you could play with an ordinary joystick? BARRY FORSTER SUNDERLAND PIC OF TYPICAL AUSTRALIAN REALY. STEREOTYPED BUT TRUE.

I mean can't you at least look at the pictures on the packaging.

In the Feb 1993 edition of your brilliant Mailbag there is a picture of Sadie. Can you blow the photo up and turn it into a poster. Please, please, PLEASE! NEIL PRICE, BARHAM, KENT YOB: You're a sick man, Price. It sounds like you need something else blown up. YOB: What is it with you lot and your sad fixation with Sadie? You're sick, the lot of you! Get out there and find a nice girl of your own to snog. Psychologists have a word for people like you and, unfortunately for you, so do the police. 1) The price of consoles can vary from place to place in the USA. Expect to have to pay about $200 for a GT, and when you get back over here you'll have to buy imported American games. Japanese ones won't work. 2) Yeah, it's probably his secret, invisible friend who lives at the bottom of his wardrobe next to the shoes. Mr Booties that's who it'll be. 3) It'd cost your sanity. And It sounds like you're already viciously overdrawn on that account. 4) Because it's not on the Super Nintendo. 5) It'd be cheaper to buy a SNES Streetfighter pack. Dear YOB, Because you are the best and most incredible person in the whole of the universe (YE-E-S? YOB) I decided to write to you with my problems. 1) I am going to America in August and I will probably buy a hand-held because they are much cheaper over there. How much will a PC Engine GT cost over there, how much are the games and will it be compatible with games bought in the UK. 2) Is there a colour Game Boy out in America ? Because my friend said that a friend of his had one. 3) If so how much will it cost? 4) Why is Streetfighter Il so slow on the Amiga? 5) Is there any way I can speed up the game by getting a faster processor chip or something?

"YOU LYING GET! OFF THE RAILS Dear YOB, I am a proud owner of a Neo Geo, SNES, NES, Megadrive, Master System, PC and an Amiga. So can you please send me  for a television, because me and my family can't afford one. BARRY SOONS THE BUNGALOW LEVEL CROSSING MINETY KIT PINNED TO THE FRONT OF A FEEL Dear YOB, My dad works and owns a computer and electric shop. He has recently been studying the insides of the SNES and the Megadrive and, after a month's long work he has made a converter for both machines so that they can play each other's games. For example, I've been playing Street Fighter II on the Megadrive (the bad thing is that the joypad does not feature every single move) and Sonic on my SNES. My dad is flogging it to everyone for just .99. Ignorant and stupid as you are you will not believe a single word I am saying, but put it this way, my dad is working on other converters and soon I will have more consoles than you could ever dream of owning. MICHAEL SAUNDERS LONDON. I WON'T SHOW MY ADDRESS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. YOB: The most obvious reason being that you're a lying get and If your dad finds out you've been telling people that he makes impossible console converter units he'll tie you up in a bag with a block of concrete and throw you in the canal. And If he'd like some help, ask him to drop me a line. YOB: Never mind that. Can you tell me what it's like living in a bungalow on a level crossing? Doesn't it get annoying when speeding freight trains come through your bedroom wall in the middle of the night and you wake up the next morning a mile up the track? YOB VS ROBERT KENDALL THE INSULT MERCHANT Dear YOB, You think you're so hard but I bet you you couldn't have Robert Kendall (you don't know him, but that doesn't matter!) A SCHWARZENEGGER AUSTRIA YOB: You're not the real Arnold Schwarzenegger, are you? (CHEESET FOOTBALLS, BABY!

If you do not print this letter then me and the lads, Steven 'The King' Rintoul and Paul The Macho Man' Topping will come round and beat the hell out of you. Get the picture, Dozy? So will you just answer this one question? There have been rumours going about my school that Sega are going bankrupt because they have been making too many adverts and releasing too many games at the one time so the price of their games will have to go down so that more people will buy them. Could you tell me if this is true please? And if you don't then, like I said before, you'll die. D SMITH, LAND OF THE DUDES YOB: And to think, I used to rely on my industry connections to let me know what was going on in the world of computer and video games. All the time I should have been calling you and your mates in the 'Land of the Dudes'! Because, hey, If anyone would be the first to know about the financial situation of a giant multi-national corporation it'd be the kids at your school. Doh! I really must be dozy. MAYBE A PIC OF ARNIE BLOWING A HOLE IN THE 519  OF THIS KIDS HEAD, NO BLOID MIND, BUT MAYBE AN EAR! P SMITH OF SATURN Dear YOB, I think CVG is the best mag in the galaxy. I come from Saturn and I'm an alien and I eat toilet roll. I think you're a sad case and personally I'd like to give you a thick ear, but that's enough of that. Please answer these questions, Yob mate. 1) Which is best, Mario Kart or F-Zero? 2) Will Mario World V be coming out on the SNES? 3) Will you send me ? PAUL SMITH PERTH YOB: So that's Perth on Saturn, is it? Not Perth in Perthshire, Scotland, like it says at the top of your letter? You see what I have to put up with? Readers with the intelligence of your average custard slice. 1) Mario Kart. 2) Something along those lines, yes. 3) Maybe I'll send you a used toilet roll to suck on. YO YOB! Hiya! Just thought I'd write in to you to say you are the biggest dorkas ever. That was a joke. Ha! Ha! Ha! (ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS YOB). Actually, you are dead nice, I think your page is totally dudoid and I always read it first in CVG. What I wanted to say was that I think my Game Boy is the business and I think you'll agree it's miles better than silly Megadrives and Super Nintendos. Everyone at school is always talking about this really weird game called Streetfighter 2 or something, but I think that sounds a bit dweebish. I mean, as if you'd go out and fight streets! That was a joke. Ha! Ha! (GOOD GRIEF YOB) The Game Boy and Amiga are the best computers around but Amigas have the best graphics and games. The advert for the Amiga 600 has an ace storyline and some brilliant computer graphics, but the teenager is a bit queer! (YOU CAN NEVER TELL JUST BY LOOKING YOB) Just how I like them! Only joking. Ha! Ha! Ha! (I GIVE UP YOB). Some of my best friends like Jonny and Pez beat me up because they think I know nothing about computers but I'll show them! Their consoles must be rubbish because they only have 16 bits my Amiga must have loads! Anyway, it's been nice talking to you. With love. DAVID ROWLEY TODMORDEN, YORKS YOB: I dunno, there's crazy people with guns in America, famine and drought in Africa, poverty and human depravity in Eastern Europe and then there's this sort of thing going on every day in Todmorden.

"RCADE ACTION Pick a player, then get out and take on the terrors! The time way, way into the future; the 26th Century to be precise. In a strangely familiar Jurassic Parktype way, dinosaurs have been genetically brought back to life. They now roam the planet, living in parallel with humans. However, their curiosity value has rocketed and, with the new-found interest there emerged hundreds of poachers who began to hunt the monsters down and slaughter them. Having been made extinct before, the giants are in no hurry to do an encore and go on a rampage across the world in a bid to save their hides. To get to the bottom of the problem and stop the poachers, four brave dudes pile into a Cadillac and burn across the plains for an adventure that has sparked just a touch more than the normal amount of Capcom interest. No Cadillacs here. Or dinosaurs, for that matter. Just sound beatings! nosaur Cla mul WORLD CLASS Cadillacs And Dinosaurs is huge in the States with a cartoon series pending, a weekly comic book, play-figures and even 3D books! The chances of Capcom doing a console conversion are pretty high, so keep your eyes peeled on a system near you. Our money's on a SNES cart, but what with Capcom's recent dealings with Sega, anything could happen! 116 "


"BIG IS BEST Not the softest bird in the world, we think you'll agree! SNES AAALNE Capcom's latest coin-op is huge, offering a choice of four different characters to choose from and simultaneous three player mayhem. First up is the gentle (NOT!) giant, Mess O'Bradovich. The strongest character, once he gets angry it takes more than a bucket of water to cool him off. His flying lariat move sends poachers sprawling. Jack Tenrec is the 'Greenie' leader of the group. A hot-blooded guy who loves nature, his dashing sliding attack is his forte. The third crew member is Mustapha Cairo. A skilled engineer, his strengths lie in his panther-like reflexes and incredible speed. Lastly, the queen of Babelonia, Hannah Dundee. Very acrobatic, our Hannah can jump higher than a tree and has mastered an awesome triangular jump attack to rip into her enemies! PICK ME UPS! Race through the levels and collect as many of the bonuses as possible. Get kitted out with M-16 assault riffles, hand grenades, dynamite and knives and turn your character into a power house. You're bound to get knocked about a bit, so replace energy by tucking into roast beef and egg salads and wash it all down with coffee! Amass as much treasure as possible to continue funding your mission. If you find the secret points hidden throughout the worlds you'll boost your score with a selection of gold, fossils and jewellry. But above all, keep moving! Crikey! A Cadillac! Not a crap one either, is it! PAD-TASTIC, MATE! CAPCOM 30p per PLAY Capcom has caught onto the success of its joystick combination style of control, used in Streetfighter 2, and has stuck some great moves into the new machine. All the characters have a 'special' which is called a SureKilling Technique, unleashed by pulling down and pushing up on the joystick and hitting the fire button. Each character can run across the screen with the dash and combine that with attacking moves, as well as some terrific combinations performed by overlapping two characters on the screen and attacking. There are loads more hidden ones too just what you'd expect from the combination kings! GRAPHICS ANNOS VERDICT CORO GAMEPLAY VALUE Cadillacs And Dinosaurs is a blast! The screen manages to keep up with the action and it's always clear what's going on. There are driving sections where you all pile into the Caddy and take a spin across the desert, battle through swamps against the evil poachers and crack skulls in scores of different locations with the Megacrush. There's loads of moves but, as with the most addictive games, you'll have to discover them for yourself but that's half the fun. Give over a few credits to Capcom's latest and you might just get hooked! 89 PAUL ANGLIN 117 "


"MEGADRIVE The heavily-armed hovercraft is capable of knocking out this large suspension bridge. by ELECTRONIC ARTS Around .00 PREVIEW \"Without doubt, Jungle Strike is shaping up to be one of the biggest games of 1993 LATE JUNE RELEASE Stage of Development 75% Completed During night missions, explosions brighten up the entire screen! JUNGLE STRIKE just among the tropical rainforest, but also over rivers and oceans and even the snowy arctic wastes! The main change, however, has been in the vehicle department. The trusty AH-64A Apache from the first game has been replaced by the even more advanced Comanche, and this time round the player can also choose to control a Special Forces motorbike, an assault hovercraft and even a radar-invisible Stealth fighter! The different vehicles must be used at various stages in the nine progressive campaigns, which now include night missions and more varied objectives, like capturing enemy commanders. In all there are 45 different missions! Without doubt, Jungle Strike is shaping up to be one of the biggest games of 1993 it's EA's first ever 16 Megabit cart, and the company is confidently predicting that it will outsell the original on its first day in the shops! Naturally, the company is being very protective, which is why you won't see any quotes from the programming team here or anywhere else they won't be talking to the press until the game's release. A bit like Ryan Giggs, but different. Sort of. Whatever, we don't mind admitting that we agree with EA when they say it's going to be one of the year's top titles; from what we've seen so far, it's hard not to! Keep an eye out for the review soon, and if I were you, I'd start saving my pennies up... The sequel to one of the most controversial console games ever, EA's Saddam-busting Desert Strike, is almost ready to be cleared for takeoff and if it lives up to all the pre-flight hype, we're guaranteed a hot, hot Summer, whatever the weather. CVG hot spot Gary Whitta seeks it out... I loved Desert Strike. Let's face it, it's not that often that you find a console game that's completely devoid of mushroom princesses and fairy kingdoms, where instead you can kick seven shades of shinola out of Saddam Hussein (or at least his lookalike) and his army of moustachioed goons, is it? Perhaps that's why, over a year later, it's still one of Electronic Arts' biggest ever Megadrive sellers and why EA, quite sensibly, is about to follow up on the original's chart-topping success with a game which they promise will be even MORE chaotic and action-packed! From the screenshots here, you'll see that Jungle Strike doesn't look that different from the original at first glance the same isometric perspective, plenty of helicopters, etc etc. But in fact, a multitude of new gameplay features are rumbling quietly below the surface. For a start, while Desert Strike was set entirely among the sand dunes, Jungle Strike's title is a little deceptive in this game you'll fight not 118 "


"The arctic campaigns are tough because the snow camouflages your targets. This time it really is 'snow' joke! Oh dear. 'In all there are 45 different missions! Collect those ammo boxes! It's nice to know some things haven't changed. WHAT'S THE BEEF? Jungle Strike follows on directly from where Desert Strike's controversial storyline left off. Though the insane General Kilbaba was wiped out by the player at the end of the first game, the sequel sees his son returning to take up the challenge, bent on revenge and joining forces with an evil South American drug baron (who also happens to be the controller of the world's largest private army). The two crackpots are plotting to build a nuclear weapon that will destroy not only the White House but the whole of Washington DC! And guess who's the only man capable of stopping them? Yep, got it in one. Hovercraft or helicopter? The choice is yours! 'Guess who's the only man capable of stopping them?' This is what you've sworn to protect the White House, Washington DC. PAST FORM 'ELLO JON, GOT A NEW MOTOR? So why do you need all these different modes of transport in Jungle Strike, then? In my day, all we had to sort out baddies with was a trusty old Apache gunship and nobody complained! Actually, the US Department of Defence has been forced to provide you with all this state-of-the-art equipment because this latest mission is so damn hard! The General's son and his drug-dealer mate have fortified their stronghold with the latest in anti-helicopter defence systems, SO the only way to sneak past defences and complete certain missions may be in a quieter vehicle, like the almost-silent hovercraft. Also, since some missions take place at night, you'll have to learn to master all the vehicles in near-zero visibility! You won't be surprised to hear that the team behind the original Desert Strike has returned to produce this sequel, led by designer Mike Posehn. Unfortunately, Mike and the rest of the team have had their mouths stuffed full of cotton wool until the game's finished to keep the project as secret as possible, but for the record, Mike's credits include not only the top Desert Strike, but also the rather excellent Skate or Die and a number of other hits for EA. The point is, Mike's pedigree is good enough to win Crufts with, so there's little doubt that Jungle Strike will be a winner. Bingo! The enemy's underground snow compound is revealed! WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? GRAPHICS As you can see, Jungle Strike is already looking pretty polished, with its smart sprites and backdrops. However, appearances can be deceptive, and there's still a lot of work to be done before the game's Summer release. ONNOS Jungle Strike's distinctive theme music and sound effects are once again being produced by exGeordie and now EA's in-house musician, Rob Hubbard. It's usually the last thing to be added, once everything else is in place. WAO 1Svd Aquatic antics as your hovercraft encounters an enemy speedboat. GAMEPLAY Most of the gameplay is now in place, but the Jungle Strike team will be changing and tweaking elements of it right up until the last minute. Oh, and the motorbike isn't working yet and still has to be added, so that remains a bit of a mystery. 119 "

"WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO WIN! These prizes are far too good for us to give them away to just anybody who can answer a few questions so what we want you to do is get a video camera and re-enact a famous scene or scenes from the Star Wars trilogy on film! Feel free to re-write the script and change whatever you like. In fact we don't care what you do it can be serious or funny — but it has to be good. What we want is some damn good entertainment, so be creative! The video that we're most impressed by will net the trip to the USA, and the next best ones will win the masks. Elsewhere on the page we've given you nine suggestions for famous scenes you might want to do. But it doesn't have to be one of our ideas, and you can do as many as you like you can even make an entire movie! AND THE NOMINATIONS ARE... Here are CVG' suggestions for the scenes we reckon will make the best videos. (In fact we picked them because we think these are the scenes in which you can make the biggest fools of yourselves). Remember, you don't have to take our advice and can film a scene of your own choosing instead, but our ideas are best, so there. FROM \"STAR WARS\" 1. The Cantina fight at the start of the film. 2. The Light Sabre fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader. 3. The X-Wing Death Star battle at the end. FROM \"THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\" 1. The scene where Yoda gives Luke his Jedi training. 2. The scene where Han Solo is frozen in carbonite. 3. The Luke vs Darth Vader fight. CWG'S VIDEO TIPS We're not going to settle for just any old rubbish on these videos, so here are a few top tips:  WE WANT to see lots of different Star Wars characters, so enlist your family and friends and dress them up in costume.  EXTRA points will be awarded for Star Wars music, American accents and special effects.  LOCATIONS are important, so if you can't get into Pinewood Studios, improvise in and around your house. Perhaps your dad's shed looks a bit like the Death Star, or maybe your back garden is a ringer for the forest moon of Endor. FROM \"RETURN OF THE JEDI\" 1. Any of the Jabba the Hutt scenes. 2. The Sarlaac Pit Monster fight. 3. The Speeder Bike chase on Endor. -When you've \"wrapped\" (top Hollywood expression there) on your movie, send the finished tape to IF YOU STRIKE ME DOWNT SHALL BECOME MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE, CVG, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON ECIR 3AU. The closing date is the 31st of May 1993, and we'll be printing stills from the best entries we receive in a future issue. All that remains for us is to wish all you budding Lucases good luck, and may The Force be with you. Always. If you're one of the runners-up in our fantastic compo, you too could look like this! (well, almost). Can you come up with better special effects than THIS? Of course you can't but we don't care. Just do your best and you could be in the movie capital of the world before you know it!

The CVG crew illustrate expertly just how good YOU could look if you win one of the limited-edition Star Wars masks except that Garth seems to have forgotten to put his on. Now you know what they mean by the dark side of the force. THE RULES There aren't any restrictions on what You can have on your video your scene(s) can be as long as you like, but iney can't be less than a minute, otherwise it's hardly worth our while all sitting down to watch it. We can only return your tapes if you enclose a stamped addressed envelope. Employees of US Gold and EMAP Images are not allowed to enter, and neither is George Lucas, because he's too good and can go to the ranch any time he likes anyway George Lucas went out into the desert to film the Tatooine scenes for Star Wars, but you could just as easily do it down at the beach! Or in a toddler's sandbox! Or even the cat's litter tray! (Stop giving them ideas -Ed). You'd think special effects like this would be impossi ble to reproduce on a shoestring budget, but you can get FX just as convincing with a bag of flour and a red torch. And some stormtrooper costumes, of course. And a Death Star set. And... (oh, shut up Ed). 121 "


"SUPER NES 'The game is based around the original Dropzone idea, but it's been souped up considerably.' As you play, the settings for the later levels scroll past in the background. Here we can see one of Jupiter's moons and, in the bottom corner, the planet itself. by EUROCOM Price TBA PREVIEW AUTUMN RELEASE Stage of Development 50% Completed The laser you start off with is fairly weedy, but you'll be able to pick up extra powers like homing missiles, autofire systems and smokescreens. SUPER DROPZONE 'If all goes well Super Dropzone should be completing the Nintendo trilogy by this Autumn. DROP AND ROLL ne of THE all-time classic shoot 'em ups is on its way to the Super NES, courtesy of Archer Maclean and a crack team of converters. Gary Whitta travelled to sunny Derby to find out how an arcade legend is being dragged into the Nineties. You lot don't know you're bom. Here at CVG, we're old enough to remember the good old days. Did you know that the combined age of our editorial team is a HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN?! Yes, the good old days, when games cost no more than a tenner, playability was much more important than graphics or sound (mainly because graphics and sound were so crap back then) and the local bobby wasn't afraid to give you a good clip round the year. Ah, things ain't what they used to be. One of the very BEST things about the good old days was Dropzone, an action-packed reworking of the classic coin-op Defender created in 1985 by then unknown programmer Archer MacLean for the 8-bit Atari and C64, which went on to become one of the best arcade games in history. It's been in the cupboard for years since, but recently the game has come back big-time on NES, Game Boy and now a version which is claiming to be the best of the lot, on the SNES. Now a bit of a programming pop star (he owns a fleet of flash sports cars and lives in a country mansion need we say more?), Archer is too busy with the new console versions of Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker to do all the work on Super Dropzone himself, so he's teamed up with veteran development team Eurocom. All the programming, graphics and sound is being handled by the Derby-based gang, while Archer is providing the main game design and original code as well as supervising the whole project. But whereas the NES and Game 122 "


"PAST FORM Archer MacLean's history is well known to most gamers, having written some of the toppest titles ever, including Dropzone (of course), International Karate, IK+, Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker and Archer MacLean's Pool. Eurocom is one of the longest-established development teams around, having worked on all kinds of projects over the years including Elite on NES. Graphic artist Pete Lyons has drawn more sprites for more video games than you've had hot dinners, so the whole project is in very safe hands. BOOM! One thing that hasn't changed (much) is the player death sequence, where the little rocket man explodes into a million pixels. WO 1Svd THE KILLER B'S The gameplay may be rooted in the Seventies, but Super Dropzone has plenty of up-to-date new additions, like sampled speech, extra weapons, end-of-level, bosses, Mode 7 intro sequences and plenty of colourful space-age backdrops, which artist Pete Lyon has tried to make look like the classic sci-fi art of the 1950s. Most of the Super NES's graphical features are being put to use, including a misting effect to create gas clouds and multi-layer parallax for the background planets. Pete has also had to design a whole new set of enemies to add to those few that have been brought over from the original. «There are so many shoot'em ups on Super Nintendo, it's getting really stale,\" says Eurocom boss Hugh Binns. \"All that happens is you get more sprites and bigger bosses, but the gameplay doesn't really change. This is really something different.\" Bags of new alien enemies have been designed for the new game, including deadly shuttle craft like this one. Keep well away from the lava lake, too. Boy versions (which Eurocom also produced) have just been carbon copies of the original 8-bit smash hit, Archer reckons that this new version will be every bit as Super as the title suggests. \"It's a hell of a lot bigger than the first game,\" he says. \"Yes, the game is based around the original Dropzone idea, but it's been souped up considerably.\" So, while the basic Defender-style gameplay remains the same, Super Dropzone now has a more modem feel to it, taking place around the four moons of Jupiter (starting on 10, which was the setting for the original game) and then, finally, on the surface of the Red Planet itself in an apocalyptic multi-scrolling showdown. Super Dropzone is being written by Archer and Eurocom 'on spec' that's to say it hasn't been commissioned by a publisher. Instead, they're developing it off their own backs and hoping to sell the title once it's complete. A number of software houses are already rumoured to be interested, so if all goes well Super Dropzone should be completing the Nintendo trilogy by this Autumn. From what we've seen, this is one game the world and his wife is going to want to get their hands on this Summer... WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? GRAPHICS Pete Lyon has already created the backgrounds, and is now creating the armies of aliens the player will confront. He also has to create the impressive Mode 7 intro sequences working from Archer's original storyboards. SOUND Though the original Dropzone never had any music, Super Dropzone will have a hot rockin' soundtrack but not during the game, because Archer doesn't like in-game music. Also expect plenty of speech to warn you of incoming aliens Here we've caught the game in what looks like a brief moment of rest. You'll not be surprised to hear that the player was utterly killed about a second after this photo was taken. GAMEPLAY Always the toughest bit to get absolutely right, this is the area on which most work still has to be done. Most of the main programming is com plete, but intelligence for the aliens and countless other factors still need work. 123 "

Of course the controls have been simplified and there's a slightly more arcadey feel, but most of the original sim's features are still here, including seven different scenarios and a feature seen for the first time on this SNES version the option to have TWO players piloting the same aircraft in a team mode, working together on flying, navigating and manning the aircraft's SNES MICROPROSE.

In case you Having already made a bit of a name for itself on Amiga and ST last year (it was second only to Sensible in the Summer SOCcer stampede), Rage Software's Striker is now warming up on the SNES'S touchline for release at the end of the Summer. From the screenshots here you'd be forgiven for thinking that you're looking at Super Soccer (currently the one big football game on SNES), as Striker uses almost exactly the same 3D 'behind the goal' display system. The action in Striker is much faster and more fluid, however, and there's a lot more to it, too. Basically, it's the same game that was such a hit with 16-bit computer owners a year ago, but with a number of improvements based around the console's superior hardware. Mode 7 has been used to render the authentic-looking pitch, and now there's an impressive indoor arena too, where you can rebound the ball off the echoing walls. Other than that, just about everything you'd expect is here changeable tactics, dozens of teams from around the world with adjustable strips and player names and three toumaments (World Knockout, World League and Super Cup), to tackle. Striker is due out via Elite sometime in August not long before the SNES version of Sensible Soccer is expected to hit the streets, so come this Autumn we could be looking at a whole new video soccer battle.

Since defecting from Anco, the man who created Kick Off and Kick Off 2 has been beavering away on Goal (which is actually Kick Off 3 in all but name) for Virgin. Arguments still rage among Amiga owners about whether Kick Off 2 is a classic or just complete crap, but Goal might be the game to silence the critics once and for all. Fans of Kick Off should be pleased at least, since Dino has retained and improved the same clever control system, while adding a number of new features aimed at toppling Sensisoccer from the top of the footballing pile. Not only have the graphics been radically enhanced, but you can now play from a variety of different views, including a Sensisoccer-style perspective. It's not been implemented yet, but there's also a feature to rotate the pitch through 90 degrees and play horizontally rather than vertically.
