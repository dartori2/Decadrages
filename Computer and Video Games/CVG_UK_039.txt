"LEGEND OF THE KNUCKER HOLE English Software's new game is based on a real legend. The Knucker Hole actually exists in a place called Lyminster in Sussex. The legend has it that a dragon lived in the hole and nipped out from time to time to ravage the countryside.

C&VG/ENGLISH SOFTWARE KNUCKER HOLE COMPETITION If you remember Jet Boot Jack's first game, from English Software, written first for the Atari but now going down a storm on the Commodore 64, BBC and Electron too, then you'll know that you can expect plenty of action in the sequel, The Legend of the Knucker Hole. It's a big game with multiplescreen play. There are both horizontal and vertical maze-like screens or \"zones\" full of traps, hazards, dead ends, elevators and we musn't forget the Kangarats! Legend of the Knucker Hole has so many features that we could spend a page describing them but it's much more fun discovering them for yourself. The player can also decide which \"zones\" of the game he or she wishes to play — but this is recommended only when you've really got into the game! You can even extend the Kangarat Kavern into a 16-screen game within a game should you so wish. There's a high score table too and a really nice \"reward sequence\" if you manage to finish off the Dragon and rescue all the Bells.

So why mention it again. \"Well, take another look at that photo. Are you quite sure that's a Spectrum? Actually, someone's written the game for the Commodore 64. It's almost exactly the same as the Spectrum version, though Jetman has a little more colour. The aliens are still there and, although they have more colour than on the Spectrum, they do move a little more jerkily. The idea is to build your space rocket and explore the different planets. Then, collect enough fuel to fill the ship and take off for your next mission. So where did we get it? And who wrote it? Well that would be telling, wouldn't it.

"e com ** ne of my greatest pleasures as a child was in getting mail. I used to spend hours clipping box-top coupons in the expectation of receiving thrilling items like secret rings, funny money and comics. So here I am, all grown up, sorting through my mail when my eyes light upon a small manilla envelope. I savour the wonder of what's inside. I tear it open to find...a rubber dagger?! There's nothing else in the envelope. A tag is attached to the blade and says \"Joke and Dagger\". The words sound familiar. I give up and turn back to the more mundane world of letters and bills. Next week, Monday morning, another manilla envelope. It doesn't feel like a dagger though. Well of course not what's inside is a pair of dark glasses and a fake beard.

"64 SYNTH The Commodore 64 has been praised many times for its graphics, ease of use and cheap price. But one of its more remarkable features, the sound generator, has received very little press. Fortunately, Matthew Harding has written a synthesiser program for C&VG which exploits the 64's sound capabilties to their full and, we think, stands up well against most professional music packages. Some of the features that are contained in the synthesiser include up to three separate voices playing simultaneously, a five octave range and the ability to define your own \"envelopes\" to produce sound like a guitar or a piano and create complex drum beats. Getting to grips with 64-Synth will take some time, but do perservere it'll be worth it. Do remember to tune in your TV set properly and turn the volume up.

"Herbie Briggs has just destroyed the myth that all floppy discs are created equal. floppy stiffer. Stronger. And your data safer. To resist bulging, warping, puckering, or opening up. MEMOREX SOLID-SEAM BONDING: Every inch of every scam is sealed shut. Tight as a drum. They seem equal. Until you look at the seams. That's where equality ends. Most companies seal their discs with a spot here, a spot there. Leaving most of each seam not sealed at all. Sooner or later, the seams might do what comes naturally: they bulge. Warp. Pucker. Open up. Pens, pencils, fingernails-even a fouryear-old's, like Herbie-can catch and snag in those wide open spaces. That's sloppy. And dangerous. Because if you put a sloppy floppy into your disc drive, it can jam your drive. Ruin your drive head. Lose your data. So much for their seams. Ours are different. THE SLOPPY FLOPPY: Sealed with a spot here, a spot there. Leaving unscaled seams everywhere. To resist all the things that can jam your drive, ruin your drive head, or lose your data. Which proves that a Memorex floppy disc isn't equal to all the others. It's better. Solid-Seam Bonding is just one example of the extra care that goes into every Memorex floppy disc. Be it 8\" 5'4\" or the new 312\" Extra care that lets us guarantee every Memorex disc to be 100% error-free. The next time you're buying a floppy disc-or a few hundred of them-just remember this: It's always better to be safe than sloppy.

First, the machine code routine at address 63000 which scrolls one line of the display to the right or left. This is used in the program to move the conveyor belts. Because of this routine, the game should be saved before it is run as an error in the data (lines 8020, 8030) could cause the program to crash. Second, the graphics in Post Mania are not done in the standard way instead the character set is redefined and the computer is then told to use the alternative set by poking the system variable \"CHARS' at address 23607-23608. This means that all the characters in the print lines in the listing should be typed in normally. Line O should be ignored in the listing as the computer will not accept it.

"Hunchback BY CARL BALL Quasimodo, the legendary Hunchback of Notre Dame Cathedral, is up to his old tricks of creating havoc for the cathedral guards in an attempt to rescue his sweetheart, the beautiful Esmerelda, who has been kidnapped by the evil Cardinal. The Hunchback must complete three challenging stages before he can rescue the fair Esmerelda. In the first level, you must help Quasimodo run along the outer wall of Notre Dame, jumping over the parapets and dodging arrows fired by the guards. In the second level, the cathedral guard assault the poor hunchback with spears and in the final screen you must help him jump over the soldiers guarding Esmerelda's prison cell.

"STAINLESS STEEL RAT Before you attempt to play Stainless Steel Rat (Saves The World), you should read the book. I say that with out hesitation for, although being fairly well-read in science fiction, I had not sampled the works of Harry Harrison. My first attempt at the game drew a zero all round, so much so that I felt there had to be more here or otherwise why the game? So I read the book which I thoroughly enjoyed it is amongst the most readable of science fiction and I found I could not put it down until finished. I then sat down to have another crack at the game, being now familiar with the world of Jim di Griz. This time I was much more in sympathy with the game but I'm afraid I still ended up none the wiser, despite continual perseverance. MISJESEN Stainless Steel Rat is for the The game has a very large Commodore 64 from Mosaic Publishvocabulary and contains most of the ing and programmed by Shards. It is words that I wanted to use.

I can't wait to delve into the rest of it! Yes, it's a multiple choice game. For example, when you encounter a Nazi patrol and the interpreter asks you how you got to the area, you answer: J'ai pris: 1. un vieil autobus. 2. un autobus vieux. 3. une autobus vieille. 4. une vieille autobus. You are clearly being tested, rather than playing an Adventure by typing in plain language commands in French. The program tests vocabulary, grammar and knowledge of France, but I am not qualified to comment on its educational value, so I won't. I do feel qualified to comment on its quality as an Adventure and without hesitation I would say zero. That is not to dismiss it as a program, though, for I found it quite fun, especially when I got one question right. French on the Run is from Silversoft, for the BBC B on disc, priced .95 Personal Rating (as an Adventure): REVIEWS The opening sequences nicely simulate the frantic opening of the story you must act quickly or all is lost! In fact, I would say that almost certainly you will have to restart after a very short while when you first start to play. The problems then begin to appear. Your pace is held back by the method of text display of the location descriptions. This unfolds letter by letter at a pre-ordained reading speed, followed by timed messages (if any) before the prompt appears. The time delay for any command that doesn't change the location is a yawn. In particular, I for inventory causes a timed item-byitem list to be displayed, when just a quick glance at a list is all that is needed. In Rat which can go wrong for the Adventurer many a time, this is a tedious business indeed. It's not the graphics that slow down the action they are good and instantaneous. The other problem is that, although now familiar with the book and with my objective in mind, I can go plenty of places but not where I want! I discovered early on that it's no good trying to make a two-dimensional map another method is needed to map time. My inability to move around at will all boiled down to inadequate knowledge of time-helix operation. I can't operate one, at least, not very efficiently. Keith Campbell 94 "

"NEW MICRO GUIDE PART 2 Sound Text Resolution Graphics Resolution 1 1 JUGGLING WITH THE JARGON 1 Sound effects during games can only be as good as the machine is capable of producing Some micros have more than one voice which means that they can make more than one sound at the same time. This is just like the difference between a trumpet and a piano. The number of different notes which can be made is often measured in octaves. One octave is eight notes. Resolution means splitting something into its separate parts. Text resolution is how many letters of numbers you can get on one line on the screen. Some micros have different screen modes which means that you can have a choice of 20, 40, 64 or 80 characters per line. The higher the resolution, the more characters and the smaller they are which makes them harder to read unless you have a good monitor or an exceptional TV. But word processing programs will need at least 80 characters to give a realistic display You hear a lot about hi-res at the moment. This is short for high resolution graphics and refers to the number of dots over which you can have individual control On some micros the graphics resolution is 672 x 512 which means that there is a total of 344064 dots on the screen whch go to make up the display. The higher the resolution, the better the graphics you can produce. But the machine needs somewhere to store all those dots so that it knows which are set to black and which are set to white. This will take up various amounts of the micro's memory Your computer needs somewhere to store your program as you type it in. You've probably noticed that, if you turn off the computer, the program you were typing in will have disappeared when you turn the machine back on. This is because your program is held in RAM. This stands for Random Access Memory and it's where all the program and its variables are stored. Each time you add a new line to the program, you are changing the contents of the RAM so it needs to be able to cope with this constant changing. When you turn on a micro, you get a message on the screen and you are now ready to program in Basic. But surely that message can't be held in RAM otherwise it would be lost each time you turn off the machine? And how does the computer know how to run the Basic language for you to write your programs? There's obviously another type of memory which stays the same even if you turn off your computer. This is called ROM and stands for Read Only Memory. This means that you can read it (see what's inside) but you can't write to it (alter it). Its contents are fixed into a chip when the computer is built and they cannot be altered. Expanding your micro means adding disc drives, printers, modems, extra memory and the like. Some computers will have sockets which you can plug a disc drive or printer straight into. Some will need expensive interfaces to convert the computer so that it can cope with the new device. This is the language in which most home micros are programmed. You'll get a manual with your machine which explains a little about the features of that particular version of Basic. You can also program in machine code which, although harder to write, will produce programs with a more professional appearance. All that Christmas money still burning a hole in your pocket? Has that micro that you were promised still not arrived? This month, we present part two of our guide to the best new micros of 1984. Last time we mentioned the QL, Amstrad, MSX and Enterprise. Now, here's everything you need to know about Commodore's two new machines. And, in case you missed it, we've reprinted our guide on how to interpret those technical descriptions from the brochure. Memory Expansion Basic COMMODORE 16 Commodore launched the 16 at the same time as the Plus 4. Learning their lessons from the way that the Vic was sold during the last few months of its life, Commodore is selling the 16 as a starter pack which is aimed at someone buying their first micro. For .99 you get the computer, a Commodore soap-shaped cassette recorder, an introduction to programming in Basic and four free programs. Good value for money if ever I saw it. And you wonder why they've stopped making the Vic? The 16 has, not surprisingly, 16k of RAM. From the outside, it looks like a 64 or a Vic, as it uses the same case. The inside is different, though. It uses a new version of Commodore Basic with over 75 commands. Like the Plus 4, there's a choice of 121 colours and standard text display is 25 lines of 40 characters. Output connectors include connection for a standard monitor. Also, there's a link for 22 joysticks, ROM cartridges and a cassette interface is also included. A serial port is provided, but note that Commodore's idea of a serial port doesn't mean that it's a normal RS232. So don't think that a modem will plug straight in. Sound is provided, with two voices. A connection on the back of the machine allows you to take out the sound and play it through your hi fi. The Commodore 16, aimed at first time buyers. 110 "

In fact, it was written by Paul Jay who has written a few games for C&VG in his time. Also included in the package deal is Starter Chess which will teach you to play the game even if you can't tell a Knight from a Bishop. Punchy is an arcade game based on Punch & Judy. You have to guide the Policeman across a stage to rescue Judy while avoiding such things as custard pies and rotten tomatoes. Last of the free gifts is XZA which is a 140-screen shoot up. COMMODORE PLUS 4 Launched as a direct competitor to the QL, the Commodore Plus 4 is one of the newest micros. For .99 you get a machine with 64k of RAM. 4k of this is used by the machine, though, so the largest Basic program that it can hold is 60k, which The Commodore Plus 4, a direct competitor to the QL? should be more than enough. There are four built-in programs which are stored in ROM and are called at the touch of a button. These handle word processing, graphs, data filing and a spreadsheet. The This is the hardest question of all four programs are held together in a The first thing you must ask yourself if you're after a micro is 32k ROM which means that, at an whether you're sure you want one.

On further exploration, he finds evidence of a lost civilisation far superior to our own, which used automatons to dig deep into the Earth's core to supply the essential raw materials for their advanced industry. After centuries of peace and prosperity, the civilisation was torn apart by war, and lapsed into a long dark age, abandoning their industry and machines. Nobody, however, thought to tell the mine robots to stop working and through countless acons they had steadily accumulated a huge stockpile of valuable metals and minerals, and Miner Willy realises that he now has the Opportunity to make his fortune by finding the underground store. In order to move to the next chamber, you must collect all the flashing keys in the room while avoiding nasties like Poisonous Pansies and Spiders and Slime and worst of all, Manic Mining Robots. When you have all the keys, you can enter the portal which will now be flashing. The game ends when you have been 'got' or fallen heavily three times.

At first he only has to jump rocks and holes. Then he must jump and duck, almost simultaneously, to avoid the logs and low hanging tree limbs in the Petrified Forest. The only way Thor can get across the river is to hop on the turtles' backs. These turtles sometimes get tired and submerge at the wrong moment, much to Thor's dismay! To add to Thor's difficulties, his arch-enemy Fat Broad is waiting on the other side to ambush him.

Timing is crucial, too. If Thor's balance is off or he is too slow he will crash into the ravine or the face of the cliff.
