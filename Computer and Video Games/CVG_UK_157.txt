Meanwhile, Policenauts on the 3DO beat You sometimes have to wait upon greatness and as these screens from a forthcoming PlayStation beat-'em-up shows, the waiting is worthwhile.... here in the UK, games Virtua Fighter 2 launch date publishers queue up to The Sony PlayStation is all set to hit the big time in Japan and the games for it are looking some kind of wonderful. This as-yet-unnamed beat-'em-up (pictured here) has been produced to go head-to-head against Virtua Fighter on Sega's Saturn machine, which, like the PlayStation will be going on sale in Tokyo at the end of November. Provisionally entitled 'Fighting Chronicles', the version here is in its infancy and only half of the characters have been installed. However the objects are reputedly moving at a fair old lick something like 30 frames a second; plus the texture mapping and light sourcing looks superb, as used to show off the stick-waving men of war. And in the meantime, Computer and Video Games was recently treated to an off-limits preview of Ridge Racer on PlayStation. Everyone who's seen it Computer and Video Games staff, and envious writers from our sister single-format mags were bowled over by the demo. We can't wait until Sony releases it on console here! New Theme Park and Syndicate sign up with Sony.... New machines hit town... "


"NEWS CVG connected REBEL ASSAULT FOR 3DO TATION Prepare to blast off into 32bit space with the latest Star Wars epic.... Computer and Video Games can confirm that Rebel Assault, LucasArts' movie-esque action game based upon the Star Wars films, will soon be making its way on to 3DO. Although a UK distributor has yet to be confirmed, two British firms are said to be in the frame. 3DO Owners should look forward to a bit of Imperial Storm Troop bashing next year. DOOM ON ULTRA 64 With action moving at 30 frames a second, you could say we're impressed.... It's Doom, but not gloom everywhere. With the 32x and Jaguar versions of Doom now coming out of the conversion works, Nintendo of America plans to bring a bloody great spanner to the proceedings by developing its own incarnation for its 64-bit console. The new Doom game is scheduled for introduction when the Nintendo Ultra 64 home system is launched next year. The conversion will be handled jointly by Nintendo of America, original Doom team id Software and coin-op manufacturers Williams Entertainment, the company behind the two first Ultra 64 coin-op games, Killer Instinct and Cruisin' USA. Nintendo claims that Doom on 164 will contain the usual barrage of enhancements new levels, new characters, better graphics etc. The shading and the shad. ows here could make even die-hard cynics weep with joy.

"CVG NEWS Connected BRIDGE TO Inu A/APTAINI OOO We like Kirk, we like Spock, we like Chief Engineer Scotty McScott, but whatever happened to Miss Uhuru and her booties? Kirk, Spock and Bones, the galaxy's most confirmed and wrinkled bachelors will no longer be warping around the universe like a futuristic set of the three old boys from Last of the summer wine. And the rumours are that Kirk will guest and then gulp! die in the forthcoming first of the Next Generation movies. No matter Star Trek's to Interplay what Star Wars is to LucasArts -ie a bit of a pot of gold. So it's no surprise to discover that the company is to put out a 32-bit version of the game on 300. It's more likely to be like the Monkey Island-ish Star Trek 25th Anniversary game, previously released on Amiga and PC than the new puzzle-cum-shoot-'em-up, Star Trek Academy to be released on SNES but more details as we get them. Let's hope the game lives long and prospers... THE PARK CYBER GAMES Domark has secured the rights to publish two games by Bullfrog Productions on Mega CD. Theme Park and Syndicate are slated for release in the Spring of '95 and should feature much of the glossy intro sequences found on the PC CD-ROM versions. Meanwhile, Bullfrog is working on the followup to Syndicate and a new game which has the working title of Dungeon Keeper. Sales Curve Interactive the first UK games company to publish on CD-only-is converting Cyberclash, its snazzylooking Lawnmowerman sequel on to Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation. Also from SCI on PC CD-ROM, PlayStation and Saturn is Death Machine, in which you get to rub out men in pin stripes with an awesome death machine. Final Cyberfact keep an eye out for Cyberclash, which'll be released on 3DO and published by newsters BMG. "


"NEWS CVG connected PRIM RAGES ON QUICK NOTE FROM KONAMI Watch out cos the dinos are at your door. Time Warner is unleashing home versions of Primal Rage, the new coin-op featuring dinosaurs kicking the primordial crap out of eachother. The conversions will be for CD32, 32x, Jaguar, PC CDROM, Ultra 64 and 3DO, with the first versions in the shops before Easter next year. And if you think the creatures shown are looking a little gaudy that's because the game is based upon a new evolutionary theory consolidating the link between T Rex and company to parrots, robins and birds today of all descriptions. Just you let you know that Konami will be doing new versions of some of its bigger name games, plus a sequel or two next year. There'll be Animaniacs on Game Boy, another Turtles game on SNES and Mega Drive, a sequel to Animaniacs on SNES and Mega Drive, and a follow-up to the rather fab International Superstar Soccer. SADHON CONDOR Message Ends SAVRON AZZAR CORRECTION In last month's issue we incorrectly stated that Rise of the Robots is being published by Konami. In fact Time Warner is handling the PC CD-ROM, PC, Game Gear and all the Amiga versions, while Acclaim is to publish the game for SNES, Mega Drive, and possibly Mega CD. Details of the CD-i and 3D0 versions to follow. 300 & SATURN LATEST — NEW MODELS PLANNED SHAATURN In a bid to fight off impending competition from Sony's PlayStation machine, Sega has licensed its technology to audiovisual hardware giants JVC. Details of the deal are scant but it seems likely to mirror the deal that the 3DO company has struck with Panasonic, Goldstar and Sanyo. And we can confirm that before Easter next year the Goldstar version of 3DO will be on sale in the UK. Confused? You shouldn't be. JVC already produces its own Mega Drive clone in Japan and HiFi manufacturers are increasingly eyeing the games market with envy. Meanwhile, rumours are circulating in the American games press about a combined 32X and Mega Drive to be launched for those who don't own the original machine. More news on this as we get it. "

"NEWS CVG connected POLICING THE FUTURE MERRY CHRISTMAS ... BANG Konami's first game for the 3DO will be an adaptation of Policenauts, shown here on PC. A sequel to Snatcher, previewed this issue on page 26, Policenauts has a typical norty, Jap-style plot involving copscum-astronauts, bent coppers, a brain dead professor and drugs and sex. Meanwhile Konami has announced further forays into next generation gaming. Castlevania will be released on 32x, International Super Star Soccer, soon to be on SNES, will wind its way on to PlayStation, as will Crazy Cross. Crazy Cross is a two-player Tetris-style game in which balls descend in groups of two or three. The aim is to get four balls in a row, and you can rotate rows to help you. The game is a conversion of a new Konami coin-op which is currently on test in Germany. Between two and five characters will pop up during the course of the game, a couple of which will be familiar to anyone who's played Pop 'n' Twinbee. SOON SILICON GRAPHIC GO MICKEY Lots of people, it would appear, like Lemmings very much. If you're one of these and you're already finished with Lemmings 2, or couldn't afford it in the first place, doubtless this item should be of interest to you. Psygnosis, the power behind the rodents, have announced the imminent release of Christmas Lemming 94, a top-notch stocking filler featuring 32 all-new levels along with another 32 previously seen on the Christmas Lemmings '93 package. Available in late November for .99 of PC (floppy and CD) and Apple Mac and for a mere .99 on Amiga this will in all likelihood score a Crimbo hit for the Liverpool scally-type geezers. MicroProse has recently announced its release schedule for the season. First up is Transport Tycoon, pseudosequel to Railroad Tycoon, which this time places you in command of all rail, road, air and sea networks across the globe in your quest for commercial gain. Perhaps MicroProse could try circulating free copies to the directors of British Rail and London Transport. Anyway, MicroProse also has a highly interesting title going by the name of Pizza Tycoon, which gives the player control over everything from the biggest empirebuilding deal to the pizza on sale in various outlets. Is anyone else getting fed up with Silicon Graphics popping up everywhere where the words 'cutting' and 'edge' are mentioned in conjunction with one another? This time the plucky programmers are on their way out to Disney World courtesy of a new star attraction at the Epcot Centre known as The Aladdin Experience. Marking Disney's entrance into the world of VR, The Aladdin Experience promises to \"convince users they are flying through the scenery\" as they have so eloquently put it. Naturally everyone is getting pretty excited about it, and we'd like to point out that a visit to Disney World is still cheaper than a real flying carpet. VIRTUA FIGHTER 2 UNVEILING SHOCKER If you weren't there, you've missed it already. Hamleys in London consolidated their reputation as top Sega coin-op people with a one week preview of the Virtua Fighter 2 arcade machine this month. If you didn't make it down, the graphics are just as good as you could possibly have been led to believe and the machine is certainly worth a whole ruck of plays when it returns to the venue very soon. Don't be too disappointed, though, as Hamleys still have the just-as-new and almost-as-exciting Virtua Cop in residence, so you can always content yourself by wasting a few polygon perps on the streets of Virtua City. Nice one, toy shop blokes. "

"CVG PREVIEW WORK IN PROGRESS JAGUAR Strategy Sensible Software Unconfirmed Out Unconfirmed IPC, Amiga, Super Nes and Mega Drive versions available No other versions planned STIE JAGUAR War. What is it good for? Well, we think it's actually pretty good for video games, to be perfectly honest... Take advantage of the enemy's defenceless status, incurred by their excursion into the briny, by shooting them to death. You can use any item of scenery you so desire as cover from enemy fire. A They might be tiny, but those are definitely dismembered corpses lying around. t's amazing what you can do with 64bit technology, isn't it? You can take a game which has always garnered plaudits for excellent playability but been oft criticised for poor visuals, pull off a one billion meg conversion job and come up with... a playable game with crap graphics. Blimmin' incredible. Anyway, not to worry, for despite everything being a bit titchy, this is Cannon Fodder from the lovely Sensible Software, and, unless we're very much mistaken, it should be a hearty laugh for all concerned. Cannon Fodder, in case you're a bit slow and hadn't realised, is a warfare title which mixes strategy and joypad-bashing. It first appeared on Amiga and has since been converted to most major formats, with a sequel due on PC soon. Your job is to guide a small strike team of varying numbers through a series of missions set in a variety of terrains, and each with its own objectives. You have to use all your skill and cunning to achieve these objectives through use of machine guns and grenades, along with extra little props which crop up during your travels. It's up to you how you use your forces, but should you split the group, troops off-screen are still vulnerable. Of course, this means you get to spend a lot of time juggling various attacking positions and trying not to let your favourite soldiers cop one. Cannon Fodder has been comparably top smart on every format it's touched, but the Jag has a somewhat bigger reputation to live up to than these other machines. Will Cannon Fodder make the grade? Only we at CVG can tell you. Honest. A Part of this mission involves destroying the innocent bridge pictured here. War truly is hell. Finding a place to shoot where you can't be shot is all part of the fun. It's all go here. It's essential to plan raids like this lest you lose all your men in a crossfire. The only way off this peninsula is by wading through the waters a dangerous activity. Wading through light blue water is safe, but swimming in deep blue pools means your men can't return fire.

This game follows the exploits of a breed of fearless mechanised warriors who use their giant robot suits to fight against the enemies of wit and sarcasm everywhere... The Irony Soldiers. SOLDIER ctually, we're joshing. Tron Soldier is actually about blowing as much as possible out of as much as possible with your 20-storey war robot and accompanying megawatt firepower. Not the most diplomatic of strategies, but hey this is THE FUTURE, right? And in THE FUTURE a mech's gotta do what a mech's gotta do. And if that means crushing legions of tanks underfoot, then so be it you douchebags got that? Anyway, if you're some kind of pinko peacenik subversive you'll be happy to hear that it's not all mass destruction and random slaughter. No, your mission is to protect the innocent civilians hiding out in every It's inadvisable to use cruise missiles against diddy and manoeuvrable targets such as helicopters. They're too unwieldy to be of much use. CRUTSE MISSILE war-torn conurbation a bit like in Desert Storm, except without killing any of them. Well, that's the idea anyway, but we all know how hard it is to stop yourself from blowing up a couple of huge residential tower blocks when you've got the chance. You've got to indulge yourself once in a while; you know, a couple of biccies with your tea of an evening, splash out on a new pair of pants once in a while, cause the unnecessary demise of a couple of thousand law-abiding citizens on a whim, that sort of thing. Of course there's always a big audience for this kind of behaviour, and it's doubtless that Iron Soldier will appeal to a lot of Jag owners. The real test for this title, however, will be how many units of hardware Atari can shift off the back of it. Perhaps you, as a reader, would care to wait for our forthcoming review in which we spill the beans on the final quality of the product, which should act as a fair indication as to its future success. Thank you. (Continued overleaf.) ASSAULT RIFL SELEET RAMOR Launch a cruise missile and this is what happens you have to pilot the warhead to its intended target. Be warned though, they're pretty hard to steer and it's all too easy to accidentally take out a building. A Arm your robot on this screen here.

"CVG PREVIEW SOLDIER SIMULATION'S WHAT YOU NEED As you may have guessed by now, Iron Soldier features an almost unprecedented level of destruction. Not of the gore-spattered Doom/Mortal Kombat type, but more to do with wrecking huge amounts of machinery and brickwork. However, there's a lot more to the game than that, and unless you're prepared to spend a bit of time working out how to pilot your war machine you'll never have the chance to knock over next door's dustbin, let alone send their entire family up in flames. This is a job for your large robot feet. As well as helping you walk (as these things do with bipeds), they're also quite useful for crushing any ground-based threats, which is enormously satisfying. You might be forgiven for thinking this is your robot reflection, such is the similarity between it and your own mech. Don't try admiring yourself though, because it's actually an enemy warsuit and you'll just get blown up. Ooh, a bit of threat assessment is needed here. Do you go for the tank or the ground-based missiles? Or do you just use your rocket launcher to blow them both to bits? In keeping with most games these days Iron Soldier enables the player to carve away with a giant chainsaw. It's not quite the same without the splatter, though. If you're a bit of a Prince Charles and have a problem with carbuncular bungalows, you'll relish the opportunity to destroy many such dwellings.

"CVG PREVIEW WORK. INPROGRESS Mega-CD Role Playing Game Konami Unconfirmed Out November No other versions available No other versions planned Heaven knows what Rocket Knight's mum's going to say when she finds out he hangs out in places like this. What the Mega-CD needs now is a bit of maturity, and what better way for Sega's CD machine to come of age than a bit of RPGing, sex and violence... ne of the reasons the Mega-CD enjoys so much more success in Japan than over here in Europe is that Japanese players enjoy a wealth of speech-laden graphic RPGs, unfortunately no-one ever bothers to translate them into English. Fortunately for us though, those considerate Konami types are soon to release a rather nifty-looking number known as Snatcher in glorious stereo English. So bad luck if you're Norwegian. In more ways than one. As if all this wasn't enough to get you mildly interested, Snatcher is a dead cert for an 18 plus rating, which means, obviously, that's it's full of gore, violence and pervy women. If you don't believe us, take a butchers (ho ho) at our screenshots which depict some of the milder scenes. Now try showing them to your parents and see what kind of reaction you get this works especially well if you are over 30). Of course, there's more to a good game than gore, unless you count Doom, and Konami is promising in-depth detective-type gameplay to accompany the brutality, along with Justifier-compatible shoot-out scenes for those of you who bought one of the lovely pink ownbrand light phasers. Personally, we reckon this is certainly a title to look forward to, and we can hardly wait to get our hands on a finished copy. Mind you, we're getting one in two weeks, so it's Ooh, that gotta hurt! It's a man with his head twisted completely off. Wahey! Down boy! Yes, it's an utterly gratuitous pic of a pervy woman which is bound to boost sales of Snatcher tenfold.

Yes, there's no escaping trains these days, and now you can be the driver of your very own fully-armed space locomotive t's quite ironic really, but Loadstar is actually an anagram of 'a old star'. Ironic because this latest CD title features the talents of Ned Beatty who is indeed 'a old star'. And quite portly. Before you say anything (or it might be after, we can't do much about it from here) this is indeed the same Ned Beatty famous for his roles in the Superman movie and... Loadstar, amongst other undoubted classics we can't quite place at the moment. Ne', as we like to call him, plays a friend of Tully Bodine, maverick train driver. There's doa SRVS Fe an illega shipment of camels on the moon, and only Tully can smuggle them off with his incredible handling of public transport. Personally, we would have liked it better if we could control Ne' himself. It would be almost as good as playing Star Warsy Mark Hamill in Wing Commander 3. Anyway, Loadstar is the brainchild of one Ron Cobb, something of a movie bigshot with concept credits for Alien, Aliens, the Abyss and True Lies (obviously he gets along quite well with James Cameron). The idea is that you use your space cursor interface to control all the systems aboard your vessel. Pressing one button fires your main weapons, pressing another activates your energy scoop which absorbs enemy fire and a third button honks your space horn good for warning dawdling drivers in front of you of your imminent arrival up their behind. This cursor also allows you to steer, simply by shifting the pointer over to the correct lane at the right time to change over. Loadstar is just undergoing bugtesting as we write (and there are some pretty hefty bugs in the pre-production copy) so we're reserving our judgement for the moment. However, if you'd like to find out what we think of it there'll be a full review next issue.

What's more he thinks it mightn't be all bad if games were dearer! CVG: How did you and Rocket Science meet? Ron: It came into exis tence through the demented mind of Peter Barrett (ex-Apple, author of Cinepak), who wanted to evolve the concept of putting people into games. However the actual idea for the Loadstar project goes back to an earlier meeting with Peter. It's based on a screenplay I'd written at the time when I was working on Alien.\" CVG: How's the team work? Ron: \"Each member has been assigned their own dream game to produce. Everybody's trying to see what games can really become. CVG... How are you going to avoid doing boring games that are great to watch but crap to play? Ron: \"I know what you mean, there's always that danger and generally games may oscillate that way you pretty well sit and look at the artwork in Myst. Yeah things may oscillate between two extremes film and games that are really simple but all play. We're toying with the idea that the passive viewing of video links isn't that productive, unless they're extremely watchable. And we're not convinced that interactive UD storytelling with 500 different plots is the answer either.\" CVG: You spend mega bucks making games. Doesn't all this Hollywoodmeets-Zelda stuff mean expensive software? Ron: Well making games is a bargain compared to making movies. $1 million is still a high budget for a game, although we do have things planned that will be costing $5million. There may well be a Roman senator thing everything's got to get bigger and gorier... Yes, 1 guess so. It will happen as people get used to increased standards of production. CVG: So if you could make the game of your dreams, what would it be? Ron: I love the idea of doing something funny yet worthwhile, you know with really lurid settings about how we mess up the planet, and with some out-of-it stuff thrown in as well... like how to divert an asteroid that's on a collision course with the Earth. I had a name for this game.

Hebereke's Popoon /SNES A rework of the Tetris game engine, which is highly addictive, oh and don't believe a word Rad says. Here at CVG we don't give high scores away lightly. A game has to be rather special before it scores over 90% and a CVG Hit. Even rarer though is a CVG Gold (awarded to games that have pushed back the boundaries of gaming) but don't expect to see more than a few of these a year as it takes a score of over 96% to earn one.

"REVIEW CVG Amiga Shoot-'em-up Black Legend .99 Out Now Amiga version available ICD32 version planned Flying through a warzone by the skin of your teeth? All in a day's work for Black Legend's Croatian team. To begin with every thing is nice and calm, and you have time to admire the scenery what there is of it but soon things get hectic beyond belief. SUUS CREETINGS FROM BEVOORRTS SEED BUG REPORTS TRELOCK LELE 10 SDUU attle simulations are generally a humdrum anar as far as the masses go. OK, so they might be the biggest kick in the world for your average wargamer, who gets off on ordering units around, but there generally isn't much in the way of action. You can go too far the other way too, when you have too much action, but nothing in the way of strategy. Only one game has ever really got it right, and that's Carrier Command, and this is really Croteam's attempt at a similar theme. Although far less tactics heavy than VERDICT the Rainbird classic, this is them trying to bring a war situation into as many homes as possi A1200 ble, by coming up with a 3D shoot em up that This is a turn up for the has all the action of Guardian, but still requires books, and no mistake. a fair chunk of brainpower. Embryo is slick and smooth, and extremely playable right from the off. I have to admit, I was a little put off to begin with by its basic flight simulator approach, but once you've got to grips with the Thunderhawk mouse controls, you've got one majoy piece of action. Tons of weapons, and even more things to kill with them, this is one mean blaster, and one that you'll be happy to spend hours with.

"CVG REVIEW SUPER NES Platform THQ .99 Out November No other versions planned Mega Drive, Game Gear and Super NES versions available Quick, hide the powdered toast here comes THQ with another of their fabled Ren & Stimpy titles... ove 'em or hate 'em, Ren & Stimpy have introduced a whole new wave of catchphrases to the cartoon world. You can hardly walk down the street these days without hearing some deluded funster shout \"You il idiot', 'You filthy swine' or even 'I say old boy, how about a glass of port, what?' Except perhaps that last one, unless you're walking by the Groucho Club or something. But neither Ren nor Stimpy said that anyway, so let's just forget it eh? Anyway, if you're a fan of the series you may remember the pair's previous Super NES outing, also from THQ, which was fairly warmly upon its release, despite its conventional platform origins. There's no such sense of tradition with this latest title though, which is programmed by Sculptured Software (whose previous credits include Mortal Kombat and Super Star Wars). This here game takes in everything from haunted houses to space travel in levels based on real-life episodes of the cartoon, as well as cramming in a huge array of genuinely funny sight gags to enhance the atmosphere. There's a lot more to the game than you'd reckon, with play veering from almost beat-'em-up territory through platform all the way leftfield to Mode 7 flying levels. Variety isn't the only thing Time Warp has in its favour though you'd be advised to bring a second player along as things are tough right from the very beginning. ren & Stimp in the time warp You must stop Muddy Mudskipper destroying the past with his time machine. Hit the little scaly blighter lots to achieve this objective. VERDICT True to the cartoon in every way, Time Warp allows the player to inflict all sorts of harm upon their hapless cohort. A Ren uses the rubber nipple power-up to scale the walls in search of bonuses. ALTERNATIVE AMIGA Fire and Ice Renegade/.99 If Ren & Stimpy aren't your cup of tea, try this rather more traditional dose of cartoon platform foolery, which is not bad at all. But could have been better. SNES Time Warp captures the spirit and humour of the Ren & Stimpy cartoons perfectly, which should please fans no end. It also showcases an astonishing variety of game styles and a huge level of challenge, which should please gamesplayers. If you're not a fan of the series you won't really get the most from Ren & Stimpy, but you'll still find an enjoyable, tough and original product. If you are a Ren & Stimpy devotee, this is more fun than a barrel of monkeys.

"CVG REVIEW PC CD-ROM Adventure Psygnosis Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned The dead rising from their graves, a medieval setting... it could be Wales, but then it could be somewhere far worse... A The game begins innocently enough... you've run out of water and wander into the village to replenish your supplies. K, so to some people there might not be much worse than Wales and her hordes of nervous sheep and close-harmony choirs, but that's hardly the stuff that 18 ratings are made of. Ecstatica, however, is. It's the storyline that had the casting vote in deciding what certificate the game received, after all, there's only so much that characters constructed of elipses can do to each other, unless you have a particularly inventive, and sick, imagination. Ecstatica is the result of five years' work from developer Andrew Spencer, who originally started programming it on the Commodore PET. Fortunately, small advances in technology, notably sound, colour and the CD-ROM drive, have helped Andrew deliver what is, quite possibly, one of the PC games of the year. As the game begins, you are journeying on horseback through Northern Europe in the year 928. After days in the saddle, you stop to replenish your supplies in a quiet village. But, the village is deserted, the inhabitants have been stabbed, slashed, hung and spiked and the streets are crawling with Werewolves, Minotaurs, huge spiders and axe-wielding Gremlins. It's up to you, the elipsoid hero, to venture into the town and to unravel the horrible secrets that lie within. With its multiple camera views and distinctive elipsoid graphics, Ecstatica is similar to the classic Alone in the Dark. It's an amazing-looking game, featuring an eerie soundtrack and some excellent digitised speech — these screenshots can never hope to do it justice. Dare you journey into the realm of Ecstatica..? Like Alone in the Dark, Ecstatica uses a mix of static, rendered backgrounds and polygonal graphics. The main difference, of course, is the unique solid look. ecstatica A Ecstatica is very politically correct and so you can choose to play either a slightly feminine looking bloke or a butch, swordwielding woman. ALike Alone in the Dark, Ecstatica has a number of rudimentary puzzles that must be solved. For example, if you collect these three ingredients you can turn yourself into a weasel... There's a huge variety of creepy monsters in Ecstatica including small dragons, huge arachnids and skeletons. A If you can convince the suspicious monk (a bible might help) you can seek refuge inside the monastery. GAME BY PSYGNOSIS. CONTACT PSYGNOSIS (051-709 5755) FOR INFORMATION. 46 "


"REVIEW CVG OPENING MOVES... If you though the woman skewered to the table was bad, check out the poor priest. They've hung him and slashed him in the chest... Your character is controlled using the numeric keypad on the keyboard. It's a bit more complicated than Alone in the Dark, but much more flexible. In the early stages of the game you'll be brutally and sav. agely attacked by a werewolf. Unfortunately, you can only stun it, so it's a major thorn in your side throughout the game. Not all the inhabitants of the village have been killed, and the survivors may provide useful information. Some, however, like this priest, are so scared, they won't talk to you at all. Not even if you're wearing your I'm the hero' badge. VERDICT A With so many nasty creatures wandering the streets, a suit of armour might come in handy. But, did I hear a rumour that there's a troll with a tin-opener...? Once you've been caught by the werewolf, he strings you up by your feet and uses you as a punchbag. Didn't Luke Skywalker go through this in the Empire Strikes Back? SECOND OPINION When I saw an early version of this at the CES show in July, I wondered how the hell they'd manage to get any game in Ecstatica. How I was wrong. This is superb. It looks good, plays well, and it's one ultra-intriguing, helluva game. It's definitely not one for people who don't like the colour red, or who have nightmarish flashbacks about being whisked away for devil worship but it's a toss up between this and Theme Park for PC game of the year. STEVE JAMES PC CD-ROM If you liked Alone in the Dark, you'll go gaga over Ecstatica. Although the control system is fiddly, once you've played the game for half-an-hour, you'll soon be running around, manipulating objects and bashing monsters with ease. The attention to detail is sublime, the graphics superb and the speech remarkable. If I have a criticism, it's the playing area is too small. Apart from that Ecstatica is mean, moody and very atmospheric a must buy.

"CVG REVIEW JAGUAR Racing Atari Unconfirmed Out November No other versions available No other versions planned It might sound like a golf game, but this is actually another Jag car racing game. And that's the Jag console by the way, before you get confused... Hey kids! Can you tell what's going on in this pic. ture? The car is officially snagged on a bit of scenery, that's what. # 42.4 lub Drive is best described as a 3D Micro Machines. You take control of a tiny toy car which you race around gigantic racing environments. The hazards that you come up against range from toilets (which flush when you hit them), to floating cats with no legs (an animated kitty being a bit too much to ask of beleagured polygon technology). Of course, the good thing about polygons is they let you see things from any angle you like, and Club Drive follows the fledgling tradition of allowing the player access to a couple of these. The first-person perspective is probably the best, the behind-the-car camera often misleading you about your angle of projection and the backwards-pointing bonnet cam is all but useless, the scale of the car rendering it impossible to see what's in behind you as well as what's in front. Still what Club Drive lacks in useful views it makes up for in game style options. There are three modes of play; against computer; a timed icon pickup course; but the most enjoyable option is the two-player only tag mode. The object of the game is to crash into the other car, thus making them 'it'. The first person to stay 'it' for a whole minute loses. Actually, 'enjoyable' isn't the word for tag mode, or either of the other two for that matter. 'Bad' is closer to the truth. The trouble is there's no feeling of inertia or traction, so you can't judge your cornering at all. Any game which needs an arrow indicator to tell you which direction you're travelling in is treading on treacherous ground. The other trouble with Club Drive is it's easy to get hopelessly snagged on certain bits of scenery and be thrown over on to your roof by still others. Pootling around in an aver age household should have been a lo more fun. A bit of a shame, sorry. club Some ramps lead to elevated track and others are there to throw you around all over the shop... -$5. This is the start of the race mode. It's quite easy to get confused with the finishing line because there's nothing to show you where you it is. A The little unidentifiable thing in the middle of the strip at the bottom of the screen is your map, which shows your location and that of any other cars or powerballs. The arrow thing next to it indicates which direction you're facing in, because otherwise you wouldn't know. GAME BY ATARI CONTACT ATARI (0753 5333440) FOR INFORMATION 48 "

TAG NUTS VERDICT A This is but one small aspect of the myriad of options pre. sented to you before you start playing Club Drive. They're probably more fun than the main game. 0:00:43.4 13. This is the two-player tag game. It's quite good fun for about ten minutes, but once you realise it's impossible to escape from one another, except by dint of weird scenery difficulties, it loses its appeal. What it really needs is larger, more open playing grounds with less confused (and confusing) layouts. And before you even think about it, don't bother trying to drive up any of the ramps, it's nigh on impossible at any sort of speed. JAGUAR You've got to feel sorry for Atari at the moment. This month two polygon racers have hit the 64-bit console, and whilst they both look spectacular in still screenshots they're marred by Jerky update and vacuous gameplay. Club Drive Isn't as bad as it could have been, but I was really expecting a lot more than this. Skip this one and keep saving for Alien Versus Predator or the forthcoming Iron Soldier (which is previewed on page 23).

The play environments appeared original and well designed, and the sheer variety of game options seemed to scream 'supreme lastability' in our ours ears. Sadly, though, the finished product has turned out to be a pretty insipid effort which handles in a crock-worthy fashion. Full marks for effort, but this isn't worth the dough. There's also a great shortage of pies in this, and I like pies. Bad luck Atari. MARK PATTERSON A This Rewind option allows you to play back your most heinous disasters.

"REVIEW CVG MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVEISNES Platform Activision Unconfirmed Out December No other versions avallable No other versions planned Yo, in the area, there's a rumble in the jungle and no mistaking... Run out of magic marbles? Swish away with your flailing and indistinct weapon that looks a bit like a neckerchief. VERDICT oes anyone remember the classic TV series Tales of the Gold Monkey? If not, it's unlikely you'll also remember the original Pitfall, which was out before you were born, young thing. Anyway, these two have more in common than the length of their teeth. The former is from Glen A Larson, the man also responsible for the A-Team, and followed the adventures of some bloke with a seaplane looking for treasure in the jungle. The latter has no connections with Mr T whatsoever, unfortunately, but was a groundbreaking title which spawned the platform genre, and certainly that part of it occupied by the new sequel, the staggeringly titled Pitfall 2, which involves searching for hidden treasure in the jungle. But without the sea-plane bit. Not that that's an entirely bad thing. Anyway, if sprawling platform adventures, with no sea-planes, are your idea of fun, this should excite you greatly. There's nothing particularly new on offer in this sequel, some ideas are even lifted from the first Pitfall title, but Pitfall 2 is executed with great panache. Activision is particularly proud of the animation of the main character, who runs, crawls, swings, slides and performs a variety of other heroic exertions with unprecedented smoothness. This affects a lot more than just the game's frontend as you have to use all these skills and abilities to negotiate each trap-infested stage, collecting priceless artifacts along the way. And, as is usually the rule for this sort of game, that's all there is to it. So which side of the thin line marked 'Simple Crap' does this product fall? SNES Sliding down vines? No problem for our Mayan Adventurer! SNES The Super NES is the perfect console for this type of game. The backgrounds are rich and colourful and the animation of the main sprite is more than worthy of some admiration. The controls are instinctive and as such it's a piece of cake to get the most out of your extremely versatile character. If you think you're up for the challenge Pitfall 2 is bigger and harder than the entire Boo-Yaa TRIBE this is a highly recommended purchase. RADION AUTOMATIC VERDICT SNES 92 MEGA DRIVE Pitfall 2 is certainly a very good title, but the Mega Drive is currently buried under a landslide of brilliant platform games, and you do have to wonder if there's any room for another. If you're not already a Dynamite Headdy/Earthworm Jim/Sonic & Knuckles owner, then this Pitfall sequel is definitely well worth some investigation. Those readers who aren't platform-fixated gamers, however, may already have had their fill of the genre recently.

"CVG REVIEW SNES Platform Nintendo .99 Out November No other versions available No other versions planned CVG It hasn't been his decade, but fresh from his Game Boy reincarnation comes Nintendo's oldest new star... If you look closely at Kong you'll see its not actually shading according to the background light source. This is the only thing that gives away the fact that it's not really a proper SNES graphic. Career from barrel to barrel at hyperspeed while picking collecting energygiving bananas... Kong and Diddy in deap sea diving excursion s the superbly animated intro to Donkey Kong Country tells us, the old and young apes are actually divided between old-style bleepy game music and drum-bashing jungle romp-a-thons respectively. What primates like to listen to, however, is probably the least interesting thing about this game. Donkey Kong Country is brought to you by Rare, a company with a long and glorious history of innovative and playable games. Rare's latest effort is this tale of two apes, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, which adopts a surprisingly conventional approach, being a side-view platformer. However, Rare has added their twist with the graphics, which are quite exceptional. All the sprites and backgrounds were digitised using a Silicon Graphics workstation and then ported over to the Super NES, so you're actually looking at 32-BIT visuals instead of anything the Super NES would be capable of on its own. Basically, this is just about as good as a platform game can look. DKC contains everything you'd expect from your favourite titles. Loads of bonus rooms, pseudo-puzzle elements, hidden screens, minecart levels and suchlike. And there's even a twoplayer mode. Actually, there are two two-player modes, depending on your feelings towards your playing partner. If you get along, you should try the cooperative mode, which sees you each controlling a character and helping each other along the way. If you can't stand the get then the competitive mode will be more to your liking. This mode is only any use if you're dead good at the game and your friend is a hopeless sad case you wish to humiliate. That, basically, is it. Don't be misled, though it's like saying Mario 4 is just some fat bloke jumping about. There's no doubting that Donkey Kong Country is a superb game which is bound to sell in the thousands and keep hordes of gamers going for yonks before they complete the game and find its secrets. donkey kone. country A Donkey Kong is just another platformer and the World Cup is just a football match.

"REVIEW CVG FROG KONG It's tough being an ape, walking around on your knuckles all day long. Showing its more compassionate side, Rare has placed some alternative modes of transport in the game to save a bit of wear and tear on your paws. Large crates are secreted in certain areas of the game which contain giant animals all too eager to aid you on your quest. Each of these has its own special ability and protects you from harm so long as you're riding (although they scarper after taking one hit and you have to chase and remount them). The three most interesting creatures are the high-jumping frog, baddie-horning rhino and sharkdeterring swordfish. There's also an ostrich, who's not pictured because he's got funny legs. 53 The shark-deterring swordfish is your main ally in the underwater level... A Rare, the team behind DKC, is producing Killer Instinct, the first game for the Ultra 64... MORE FUN THAN A BARREL OF MONKEYS Sonic has bumpers, Mario has magic blocks, and Donkey Kong has barrels. Yes, a platform character is nothing without his or her) environmental props, and DKC has them in abundance. These barrels are capable of propelling your monkey over short distances. Marked ones do this automatically, and plain ones require the player to initiate the launch sequence. This is pretty straightforward, but once the barrels start moving around and you're forced to shoot yourself from one to another at high speeds things get somewhat trickier. This reptile critter may look nasty but is eminently disposable just bounce off the tyre and onto its head. 5 3 "


"CVG REVIEW HITS FROM THE KONG At certain points during the game you're introduced to various other inhabitants of your domain. Some of these just lecture you, such as Cranky the Kong from the original Donkey Kong coin-op, now a wizened pensioner. Others, though, are useful contacts who can do something for you. Funky Kong is probably the one of these you'll get to know best, as his Jumbo Barrel is capable of propelling you form his pad to any saved position you wish to visit, whether to pick up more bonuses or just re-play favourite sections of the game. The game isn't really set in the Congo. It's set in the Kongo with a K. Eeerily, there's a town in Cheshire called Congleton, which is probably where all the characters live in real life. The aim of the mine section is simple: jump the gaps in the broken track... Collect as many bananas as possible. A hundred of these soft fruit treats are sufficient fuel to add an extra life to your total. SECOND OPINION A Mr hoppy frog is one of the helpers you can enlist by dissing the larger crates. You really do stop, stare and gawp when playing sections of this game. Donkey Kong Country is a major achievement in terms of 16-bit graphics. And although it might not seem so at first, there's enough variety to keep you going. However this is a game that's been produced with the mass market in mind and, on that score, it was never meant to be overtly taxing. Die-hard game fans may find the playing unoriginal but there's no denying its beauty.... STEVE JAMES The music for the under. water sections of the game is filmic and truly beautiful. VERDICT SNES This is a phenomenal-looking game, and no mistak. ing. However strip away the clever graphics and what you've got is a very regular platform game. It's a good one, yes, but you can't help thinking Rare could perhaps have come up with something a bit different. Anyway, that's about the only fault you can pin on DKC, because it's ace. You really really ought to think very hard indeed about buying it if you have even the slightest interest in games. RAD AUTOMATIC Donkey is better at killing things with his bulk, Diddy is faster and a more proficient jumper. 92 GRAPHICS 97 SOUND PLAYABILITY 93 VALUE 89 OVERALL ALTERNATIVE SUPER NES Super Mario 4 Nintendo/free It comes free with the machine, so you'll already have it, but this is the only title which gives DKC a real run for its money.

"CVG REVIEW LA1200 Shoot-'em-up Binary Asylum .99 Out Now No other versions available No other versions planned CVG Landing from new boys Binary Asylum is an Amiga blast which casts the player as a hard-nosed mercenary pilot from the 21st century... A Graphically Zeewolf could benefit from some texture mapping and higher scrolling speed. y all accounts the future on Earth looks like being more grim than a four-day old bacon sarnie from a motorway caff'. In Zeewolf it's global warming that's become the main problem, and although car fumes and CFCs are part of the cause the main one is the giant and pollution happy Ecliptico corporation. The good guy is Zenith Research, a smaller corporation that has cracked the secret of more eco-friendly fusion power. The thing is Ecliptico has nicked the plans, but don't worry, there's still hope for green meadows and fluffy bunnies as Zenith has also been working on Zeewolf, a top-spec attack helicopter. As a highly payed mercenary you take the part of the pilot of a Zeewolf prototype through multiple missions until Ecliptico is beaten. Like Desert Strike on Amiga, missions tend to be broken up into stages. For instance one level requires ground weapons to be taken out before a damaged aircraft is escorted back to base. The player must then return and rescue a crippled aircraft by towing it along Thrust style. Zeewolf draws inspiration from a host of classic games including Desert Strike, Thrust, Powerdrome, Thunderhawk, Stardust, Sub-Terrania, but it's probably closest to Elite creator David Braben's forgotten classic Virus and can best be described as a tactical shoot-'em-up. A After completing a mission simply find the base ship and land on it. Descend carefully though, it's easy to drop off the side.

A1200 I hated Zeewolf at first because the controls were a pig, once mastered though and the game is more akin to your fave smoked-bacon buttie; the joystick can be dispensed with in favour of precision mouse control. There's an awful lot to do here and the difficulty curve is perfectly set for long term gameplay.

The look of the game is highly stylised and replete with cool graphical touches, like being able to skiff the top of the water, and the sound and FX are equally superlative.

Unlike Virtua Racing you're free to adopt any viewpoint of your choosing before you actually hit the road, so you can begin the race all prepared. You might think that Checkered Flag is just another Virtua Racing clone, and you'd be right. Because it is. TRA SPEED GEAR 1 POSITION 2/6 One of the main advantages of the closer views is the impressive graphical scenes such as this. sn't America incredible? A nation forged in the spirit of democracy by a handful of settlers from all countries. Centuries later it's arguably the greatest power on the planet, and has contributed such wonders as the Remington shaver and TV docudrama to world culture, yet they still can't spell. Look, if you're American and you're read ing this, it's chequered. With a Q. And whilst we're about it, there's no F in sulphur either. And try putting the U in 'color', fools. Ooh, it makes me so mad... Anyway, chequered Flag is Atari's first foray into the wacky world of polygon racers. You, as a prospective player, are put into the not-exactly spacious seat of a grand prix driver currently entered, uncannily, into a GP.If you're not too hot on competitive sports, the idea of the game is to complete a set number of laps of each course faster than any of the other drivers on the track. Obviously your opponents would quite like to stop you doing this, and use a barrage of dirty tricks to cut you off or cause you to crash tricks which you yourself are also wel come to employ. Despite this, the bigest challenge you face has nowt to do with irate wheelsmiths and more to do with the courses you face, and even your own car. Learning to handle your motor, and which one of the six different views suits you best in which circumstances. And this is before you even bother with manual gears. checkered OPTIONS SPEED 155 MPH GEAR 4 POSITION 2/6 00:21:7 HERTHERS RRFOL CHECKERED FLAGI 388EAS AUBE This options screen allows you to customise your car before each race, right down to the paint colour.

"REVIEW CVG DON'T FORGET YOUR SOU'WESTER SPEED 57 MPH GEAR 1 POSITION 2/6 00-06:5 Weather eh? Can't live with it, can't live without it, that's the climate of the world. This very same climate is faithfully reproduced in Checkered Flag (except it doesn't look all sunny at the start of a race and then starts chucking it down when you've set out in a Tshirt with no umbrella, like what happens in real life), which features an array of meteorological conditions and also allows you to equip your car to cope with them. Sunny tracks are fine, although you'll find your travel sweets melt if you leave them on the dashboard, and require no twiddling. Rain is pretty easy to deal with by the simple addition of wet=road tyres which allow you to keep a firm grip around corners. The most potentially hazardous act of God is probably viewobscuring fog, which limits visibility to quite disgrace. ful proportions. Keep an eye on your speedo and mind that child in the event of mist. There'll be a number of race games out on new machines and this on Jag is the first. A As you can doubtless see, the fog is graduated for a more realistic effect.  ATARLCORP. SECOND OPINION flag I wholeheartedly agree with Rad on this one. Checkered Flag had the potential to be a cracking title, but there are just too many things preventing it. The cornering is highly slack and not at all realistic your vehicle doesn't even handle like you'd imagine a pretend race car to. Yes, it is fairly accomplished technically, but if Sega can knock out a game almost as impressive as this on a machine with a quarter of the power that's really no excuse. MARK PATTERSON SPEED 105 MPH GEAR 3 VERDICT POSITION 2/6 00:50:4 00:18:2 ALTERNATIVE 32X Virtua Racing Deluxe Sega/Unconfirmed Waiting in the wings to claim the best racer ever crown is this superlative effort from Sega. This is what the next generation consoles are capable of. ISSUE 157: 93% JAGUAR Checkered Flag is extremely reminiscent of Sega's classic Virtua Racing, with a couple of notable exceptions. For starters, there's no twoplayer option, a major oversight when you think that was probably the Mega Drive VR's big selling point. The other big differ. ence is in the handling of the car, which turns very sluggishly. Fair enough, programmers still have to get the hang of the machine, but the Jaguar is capable of much more. RAD AUTOMATIC ACheckered Flag has all the hallmarks of an excellent game that refused to drive out of the pits. * Attention to detail, that's the ticket. Get a load of that lovely shower of sparks. GRAPHICS 80 SOUND 82 PLAYABILITY 74 I VALUE 71 OVERALL Another tussle takes place for a few vital seconds of time. Although they're not vital because the game's quite easy.

"CVG REVIEW LA1200 Platform Virgin .99 Out Now Mega Drive, SNES, NES and Master System versions available No other versions planned A whole new world or just another run-of-the-mill platformer? We take the latest Disney Amiga licence from Virgin for a magic carpet ride... LOSE This end-of-level bonus game is basically a fruit machine sim; keep playing for jewels and lives until Jafar appears. s the console owning public get their claws into Virgin's latest Disney licence The Lion King, at long last here's the floppy version of Aladdin, one of last year's most successful console tie-ins, also from Disney and Virgin. This Amiga version is A1200 only and it's obvious why after just a cursory glance at the gorgeous screenshots scattered about the page. An A500 version is unlikely since it would be extensively scaled down but a CD32 version could materialise if the machine's sales pick up. This version is based on the Mega Drive original, for those unfamiliar with the game this means Aladdin gets a razor sharp sword to dispense baddies with instead of the poncey apples featured in the SNES version. The game plot sticks closely to the film and sees the player take on the evil Jafar over a number of platform-based levels. The apples from the SNES version are present but when collected simply boost the player's score. Other items to watch out for include jewels, which can be used to buy wishes or extra lives in the shop, and the end-of-level fruit machine. Here the player can take a gamble to win Aladdin yet more lives or jewels. It's switch around time because in this level you play as Abu the Monkey. aladdin VERDICT A Here Aladdin jumps on the camel's head who in turn spits something yucky out which kills the guard. A1200 This is an impressive conversion which retains the original version's charm. The main sprite is the best yet on Amiga. Thing is, the average gameplay has been ported too. There's not a lot of variety and the levels are fairly easy. Maybe I'm being a little hard, though, since it's certainly a polished production and better than the majority of platformers out there.

"REVIEW CVG IPC CD-ROM Arcade Psygnosis .99 Out Now No other versions available Mega CD and CD32 versions planned Psygnosis drags you into space with its fast-paced 3D shoot-'em up, Novastorm, but is it a brilliant game or just a Rebel Assault-style cash in? We decide... novastorm 0002500 t was horrible. As mankind slept on his journey towards the stars, the machines he'd constructed to make life easier evolved, grew and eventually became intelligent. Finally, as man settled around a new star, the machines rebelled against their creators, tired of their menial, tiresome existence and desperate for some individual meaning and purpose... Yes, it's your typical 'machines become sentient and start a war against mankind'-type scenario. Like the Terminator movies, the humans are massively outnumbered and outgunned, but in the greatest traditions of sci-fi heroism, one lone pilot, in a state-of-the-art Scavenger 4 fighter craft, is going to attempt to penetrate the mechanoid defences and save mankind from total extinction. No, there's no prizes for guessing who the pilot is. Novastorm is a 3D shoot-'em up and like Rebel Assault, your starfighter travels along a preset path, leaving you to manoeuvre around the screen blasting anything that looks vaguely alien. As you can see, the pre-rendered backgrounds look absolutely gorgeous, and together with the pounding soundtrack and the finger-straining action, Novastorm is without doubt one of the best shoot'em ups on the PC. A The intro sequence is a mixture of impressive Silicon Graphics-rendered animation and this military bloke, who narrates the story of mankind's downfall. VERDICT One unique feature is the fact that if you travel too close to the edge of the screen, you'll hit the ground and deplete your shields. A The Scavenger 4 craft screams across a volcanic landscape. Your shield is represented by the bar topleft, while your power-ups are indicated below. Bote A1200 I loved Stardust on the Amiga, so I guess I'm a little biased right from the outset. My only problem with it was that it was a little slow to play at times. This new AGA version is everything I could have asked for, though. It looks absolutely incredible, with the most realistic looking rolling boulders ever seen, and the game is just fiendishly addictive. If I have one complaint, it's that it's a smidgen too hard for the average player, but that just keeps you at it! GARY LORD R12 THE GUARDIANS... A Like the games R-Type and Project X, if you collect these spinning tokens you can access various powerups, including double shots, drones and wingmen. OR 93 GRAPHICS 91 SOUND PLAYABILITY 90 VALUE 85 OVERALL 1. At the end of a level you encounter a big, endof-level guy. The best way to get rid of him is to shoot the satellite's exposed midriff. 2. The second guardian is a horribly beweaponed gunnery post. The small display on the right of the screen shows just how much energy the current target has. 3. Bad guy number three is a toughie. You've got to dodge the ship and shoot the big, dinosaur behind it. Fail, and the creature will crush you in its jaws. ALTERNATIVE MEGA-CD Rebel Assault Lucasarts/.99 The FMV is grainy and not up to the PC's standard, but if you're a sucker for a Star Wars licence (and who isn't?) then this fly'em and shoot-'em-up isn't bad at all.

"REVIEW CVG MEGA DRIVE Platform Konami .99 Out Now No other versions available ISNES version planned Cartoons have come a fair way since Betty Boo, and with the helping hands of Spielberg behind it, perhaps Animaniacs is a little too clever for its own good... FEEDER TIE A LA MODE low. Hang em Suid animaniacs ET STUDIO SELECT ne of the nice things about Animaniacs the cartoon is its ability to wake you up on a Saturday morning when you've got no recollection of the previous night, and your eyes are gummed together. You don't even need to go through the pain of looking at the screen, just so long as you can pick up the obscure references which are aimed squarely at twentysomethings you can enjoy it. Obviously this is something which couldn't be translated to the game, no matter how late you were up on Friday. But with one version at least Konami has managed to come up with a winning game. Konami has succeeded in capturing much of the spirit of the cartoon, even if it lacks the humour, However, there's decently playable game in Animaniacs, thanks to a balanced mix of action and puzzle solving. Of course, it also rips-off well-known movies, such as Jurassic Park, to provide fodder for most of the levels. You can dive straight into one of four levels at the start of the game, which is useful if a stage proves too difficult. VERDICT A Beer, in a cartoon? Wicked. This is what we want. And while you're at it a packet of scratchings too, bartender. I MEGA DRIVE It's not even worth bothering to argue the case for the Mega Drive version being better than the SNES it's simply light years ahead. The balance between puzzle solving and action is spot on. Although the problems aren't taxing, they help lift Animaniacs out of the realm of average platform games. The graphics are well animated, but exceedingly small. But on the whole this is a very well presented and exceedingly playable platformer. MARK PATTERSON 0552 WARNER'S WACKY WORLD A Balance on the pink and blue hippos' heads to reach the platform. It's tricky, but the only way through this nasty situation.... What sets the Mega Drive version of Animaniacs apart from its SNES cousin is the novel way it combines puz. zle solving with traditional platform action. Here are a few of the hazards you'll encounter. He's fat, got a bad temper and was probably kicked out of the army.

In this case you need to get this dog out of the way. You can either hit him with a rubber ball, bash its skull in with a hammer or snog it. 3. A lot of the Animaniacs enemies are ripped straight out of big name movies, and obviously aren't happy with it. CONTACT KONAMI (0895 853000) FOR INFORMATION 65 "

"REVIEW CVG MEGA DRIVE/MEGA-CD Shooting Konami Mega Drive .99/Mega-CD .99 Out December Super NES version avallable No other versions planned Here our hero has availed himself of a gattling gun, which is most useful for shooting people into lots of little tiny bits. \"Hey, you lookin' at me? You lookin' at me?\" \"Actually, no, I was looking at the ridiculous pink plastic light gun you're brandishing, old chap.\" Yes, first-person shoot 'em ups are back for the Winter season. A The six-shooter chamber at the bottom of the screen shows how many rounds remain in your gun. Shoot off screen (or press the C button on your joypad) to reload. Sexual equality arrived a couple of hundred years earlier for Wild West villains, and as such you're forced to shoot a number of women. letha here is a Country & Western 'great' called Coward of the County which contains the chorus \"Promise me son/Not to do the things I done/Just walk away from trouble if you can/It don't mean you're weak If you just turn the other cheek/Son, you don't have to fight to be a man. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is a Country & Western ditty, direct descendant of rootin', and to all intents and purposes, tootin' cowboys'roundthe-fireside singalongs, and yet it's about a big soft jessie who won't even indulge in a playful spot of face-beating with his pardners. There's only one thing to do with his sort, if you ask us. Shoot them. Shoot them all. And, by an almighty coincidence, here comes a game which allows you to do just that. Well, not quite, but if you've a twisted enough imagination you could always pretend the massed ranks of armed robbers and such like encountered in this Old Western environ are in fact fully paid-up members of the Scaredy Society, although we would by no means advocate such behaviour. Lethal Enforcers 2, like its predecessor, is a pretty simple game. Digitised opponents appear from behind the scenery, lob a challenge or insult your way and commence firing them irons. In the meantime you (and a friend if you so wish) use your joypad-controlled cursor or Konami own-brand Justifier light gun (sold separately) to pop their be-spurred clogs. However, with you representing the law and all, you also have to watch out for innocent civilians and allies who also sometimes appear. Needless to say, filling them full of holes does not look good on your record and loses you vital energy. And friends, if they've got any sense. enforcers 2 CREDIT 2P_000000 PRESS START VERDICT 20 ESSACREDIT PREES Step OBAGONC A Some boys named Sioux show their colours, although their sampled speech is undeniably Texan, strangely enough.

"CVG REVIEW SNES Shoot-'em-up Psygnosis .99 Out November No other versions available No other versions planned Nostalgia ain't what it used to be, well Archer Maclean doesn't seem to agree as he gets Psygnosis to release a 'Super' version of one of his classics... ou know there's nothing worse than going to the cinema and sitting next to some bloke who's read the book prior to the film and keeps telling his girlfriend that the movie isn't as good as the book', continually. Well, whilst playing Super Drop Zone I've had a whole horde of peeps trudging past making similar remarks along the lines of 'l remember this on the C64'. And for those of you who weren't here's what it's all about... Alien attack waves are thwarting your attempts to rescue your men at the designated drop zone, you scroll horizontally (Defender style) and at the bottom of the screen is a scaled-down version of the level so that you can see where your men, incoming aliens, power-ups attack craft and end-of-level guardians are, and is a vital tool in your gameplaying plan. Super o Crop axy Zone B2995 The digitised voice overs are atmospheric and they warn you of 'incoming MFis' (the red blob), well that's what it sounds like anyway. This gives you time to activate your shield or to get in position so that you can blow the MFI into as many pieces as their furniture comes in. A No, I'm afraid Scotty's not beaming you up, but that would be an easy way out though, wouldn't it? 3652 Place your firepower just right and don't forget to pick up those bonus coins.

"REVIEW CVG ACCESS ALL ZONES Just to set the scene Archer has included a wee FMV intro for your delectation. WHO'S BOSS? Harking back to the days when end-of-level bosses were end-oflevel bosses, here's a few of them for your edification... ACK HAVE 81 COMPLE BONUS X 108 In combat, and indeed Drop Zone, it's not about what weapon you have, it's how you use it. SPEE21 The levels are samey, with a token effort like snow to make a difference. VERDICT This game is all about high scores, and to get them you're going to have to get plenty of bonuses and avoid getting got by those reet evil end of levellers. SECOND OPINION Dropzone is one of my all-time fave games and it's good to see that Archer has stuck to the original format. The few additions are welcome bar one. On the C64 Dropezone cost .99, and now you're being asked to fork out  more? It's a tough decision for a game which doesn't offer the same kind of variety as the likes of Starwing. Get it if you love it, but you could buy the original, complete with machine second hand for the same price. MARK PATTERSON ALTERNATIVE A1200 Super Stardust Team 17/.99 Another classic game given a Nineties shine it, and believe us this looks absolutely incredible with some great FX to boot. One of the best SEU's for the Amiga. ISSUE 156: 89% SNES Here we have a game which was loved by all when it first came out thanks to its addictive and enjoyable brand of fast and frenetic gameplay. But has it been enhanced enough to justify a Nineties re-release? Well, there's a lot of new feature, but despite them you can't help thinking 'Is this enough?' Games have moved on, even shoot-'emups. You will enjoy Super Drop Zone, but there aren't enough features to make it a 'must have'.

Chances are that if you'd bought a new SNES game then you were playing the rather divine Zombies Ate My Neighbours, and were embroiled in the exploits of Zeke and Julie as they tried to aid their neighbours' predicament. Well one year on and it's time for the sequel Ghoul Patrol. Once again you control Zeke or Julie (or both in two-player mode) as they try and fight through maze after maze of scenery desperately in search of the few citizens who have not yet been zombified. Unlike the original Zombies game, Zeke and Julie can now skid into opponents as a form of attack, and SOS message bubbles have been included which float into the screen providing the player with a rough idea of where the next person to rescue is located. Power-ups are abundant from go-faster shoes to some heavy artillery, but in the main, a selection of keys need to be found to access new parts of the screen. Advance further, and it's the combination of bigger mazes together with the quest for keys that makes the going tough. The boss takes some beating so it's actually worth losing a life to get a fully loaded bazooka for the job. As you progress you'll find items of the scenery being more useful. As shown here, you can bounce around on the sofas avoiding the nasties. D 001 GAME BY LUCASARTS CONTACT VIRGIN (081-960 2255) FOR MORE INFORMATION CART SIZE: 8 MEGS 20 "

You can carry as many power-ups as you can find in this game. Each weapon has limited ammunition, but you don't collect more ammo just the whole new weapon.

ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRI Zombies Konami/.99 It's the game on which Ghoul Patrol is based. Zombies is identical in gameplay but more fun because the levels are more compact and busy. The bazooka is a great weapon but uses up ammo fast. Best used for blasting over walls. VICTIMS ISSUE 144: 88% Our WERE VERDICT You can't always identify an opponent: these plants rest docile until you pass near them, at which point they give chase! With the cannon you can kill efficiently at close range, but it has a limited reach. SECOND OPINION Zombies was one of those games that I became more and more attached to the more and more I played it. I don't see that happening with Ghoul Patrol though, since it seems to be more of the same, but with a couple of major faults these being the rather sprawling and empty levels. On the plus side it's a fun game when played with a friend, and the audiovisuals retain the B-movie kitsch of the orignal. If you're a complete Zombie head this is worth having but if you don't own the original I'd buy that first. RIK SKEWS SNES Remember the ancient Gauntlet coin-op? It was a crackingly good mazebased shoot-'em-up, and Zombies and Ghoul Patrol are both based on that game engine. The main difference between the latter two though is that Ghoul Patrol has more weapons and a sliding leg sweep manoeuvre. Like the first game in the series GP creates a humorously sick sick atmosphere, but it is not significantly different to Zombies to warrant a second purchase. DENIZ AHMET Using the homing cannon you can afford to run and shoot instead of fighting on the spot. GRAPHICS 81 SOUND 78 PLAYABILITY 82 VALUE 84 OVERALL patrol This is probably your best weapon.

"CVG REVIEW CD32 Sports Team 17 .99 Out Now Amiga version available No other versions planned TAKE A DIVE INTO POOL Heavy drinkers why waste your time going to the pub to play pool when you can snuggle up with a six pack and Team 17's latest? If you don't have much of a social life you'll probably be glad to hear that Arcade Pool features a trick shot option. Simply set up the balls as you want them, remove any surplus orbs and take your shot. A great way to numb your poor associates. POE Player one ere at CVG, we like a game of pool. Give us a couple of glasses of weak lemonade and that's it We all reckon we're expert hustlers and start foolishly challenging hard-looking strangers. However, our long nights of being severely beaten up look set to end thanks to those plucky homeboys at Team 17, who have been and gone and programmed this here home pool title, with real-live digitised pub soundtracks. Arcade Pool, as the title suggests, eschews the majority of simulation aspects in favour of a fast-paced hit-and-run style of play. Taking a shot is as simple as positioning a cursor designating your chosen point of impact and hitting the shot button. The only concession to any sort of trickery is a tracer showing the approximate path of the cue ball postshot. This may sound a little disappointing for die-hard moustache-wearing pool players, but take heart, for the Team has considerately thought to include just about every version of the rules going, from good old Tommy UK eight-ball to good old Yankee US eight-ball. You can also set up a number of trick shots if you're one of those ridiculous bores who gets a kick out of that kind of rubbish. Just think, you'll be able to show all your friends and everything. Hooray. Steue Heley Trainspotting pool aficionados will love this it's an American-stylee blue baize table, available at the touch of a button for saddos. FOUL e Should you mess up, this handy foul message details exactly what you did wrong. As if you didn't know. A What these pictures can't convey is the amazing noninteractive, not-at-all-game related pub noises in the background. Shame. VERDICT arcade The dotted line receding from the ball path shows the angle the cue ball should roll off after impact. CD32 The trouble with pool games is that while the sport itself is a good waste of 50p, there isn't enough to it to justify a computer conversion. This version may have a million different rules set-ups, but at the end of the day there isn't an enormous strategy element, and all the actual skill required to take a shot has been totally removed. As a result you're left with a sparse and unexciting piece of software. Not even one for pool aficionados.

The problem with Gens Lost having such a convoluted story though, is that it is not presented in such a way as to evoke your interest the intro consists of still screens and wads of on-screen text. Punters are getting fussy these days, and they expect flash intros to get them in the mood. What of the game, though? Well the basis of the gameplay is exploratory you search through intricate and huge platform levels, where the emphasis is on cunning and guile rather than fast and frenetic Sonic-style dashing about. To aid the quest there are, littered around the levels, various accoutrements: keys, shields, invisibility suits that enable Monobe (that's you that is), the chosen one, to cross each of the six different sectors of the country and eventually save the day (and the night of course). And yes, it does look, more than a bit like Flashback now, doesn't it. The levels do get more varied and colourful, but it's basically the same gameplay style all the way through. VERDICT MEGA DRIVE At first look, Generations Lost will remind you of Flashback, and certainly the game is not a million miles away from it. Like the latter, Time Warner's latest release is a taxing affair, but unfortunately it's also downright frustrating. This is because the main sprite is often awkard to control and one slight deviation from the chosen path and it's game over. The light sabre is an ingenious device but that Is about the only ingenuity used in creating this game. GARY LORD Dotted around the levels are various weapons and tools that will aid your plight.

"CVG REVIEW 3DO Crystal Dynamics .99 Out Now Mega Drive and PC versions available No other versions planned star Your first encounter with alien life will probably be with the ilwrath. These spi. der-like creatures are normally dangerous, but to break you in gently, their invisibility cloak is disabled in the early stages. Don't judge a book by its cover, or a 3DO game by its graphics... + Tinkafe f we judged things solely by the way they looked, we'd probably be playing frisbee with the Star Control CD instead of shoving it in our 3DO. But having played the original Star Control several years ago, and squandering weeks on the Mega Drive version, we were duly prepared. Star Control 2's gameplay is a curious mix of strategy, role playing and shoot-'em-up, with graphics you'd hardly call state-of-the-art. But it plays amazingly well. The biggest draw, as with the first game, is the two-player head-to-head shoot'em-up mode. Each person selects ten ships from the 30-odd in the game and basically has to trounce their mate. What makes it fun is that each ship is completely unique, with its own weapons, looks and handling capabilities. Backing up the two-player mode is a superbly plotted adventure game which introduces you to the inhabitants of our particularly spindly arm of the galaxies, then lets you kill them with all the neat ships you've press-ganged into service. That, raiding planets, puzzle solving and being able to hold a decent, persuasive conversation without pointing guns or drenching the recipient in spit are other essential skills. It's deep, but not so taxing that you end up drowning in brainwork without getting your quota of alien elimination in between. A The autopilot takes over on long journeys, letting you put your feet up on the wheel and chomp on a taco. Tuig A Just because a ship's small, doesn't mean it's useless.

"REVIEW cvo control 2 Starbases are like intergalactic Shell shops providing fuel, food, fluffy dice and thermonuclear weaponry. OUTFIT STARS SHIPYARD DEPART STARBASE SC2's weak point, quite clearly, Is its in-game graphics. Navigating between planets, for example, gives you a potentially lethal mid-Eighties flash-back. VERDICT FEB 22 2155 3DO Star Control 2 is a game you play for the wrong reasons. The RPG element, which the programmers spent the most time and effort on, is overshadowed by the two-player fight-tothe-death section. It was the strongest element on other formats, and is the best thing about this version. For friend deficient gamers, though, the RPG game is massive and v. playable. But for us shallow and aggressive types, you can't beat a bit of head-to-head blasting. MARK PATTERSON A good chunk of the game involves exploring planets for minerals, alien artifacts and the aliens themselves. These were the bad guys in the first Star Control game, but now they've been overtaken by a new, even deadlier race. A The first mission takes you to Earth's moon. You build yourself up to take on the might of an allen fleet, only to find they've wandered off, leaving you all on your lonesome. SECOND OPINION GRAPHICS 61 SOUND 79 PLAYABILITY 83 VALUE 80 As much as I like this game, why didn't Crystal Dynamics make better use of the 3DO's capabilities? It's loaded with CD sound, which is fair enough, and the zoom feature is used well, but that's about it. Some of the graphics are totally unforgivable by today's standards. However, the gameplay makes up for many of the shortcomings, although the adventure section does tend to leave you a little lost, so you end up taking the easy way out by tuming to the help section in the back which defeats the object of playing the game to some extent. Still, it's really fun to play and that two-player mode is just fantastic. STEVE JAMES OVERALL ORZ NEMESIS All the looks of a jammed nutcracker, and about the power of one too.

GAME BOY he Lemmings are back on Super NES, Mega Drive and Game Boy with more levels, lemmings and ways to kick the bucket! Just in case you've been in a cupboard with a bag on your bonce for the past decade the aim of the game is to prevent the scatty creatures plunging to their doom by getting them to perform certain tasks in a puzzle environment until they reach safety at the end of each level. Lemmings 2: The Tribes features 12 tribes of lemmings, and each tribe owns a piece of talisman which must be reunited to fend off some impending disaster. The game has 120 levels and there are now more than 50 lemming skills of six types — ground moving, building, shooting (whoopee look at that bazooka go!), wind skills, movement and miscellaneous. Some are similar to the first game but many like jetpack lemming are all new. The flying lemmings are fab and can be directed with the new fan icon. Some skills are permanent and some can be changed and there are also combination lemmings. For example, a stone thrower lemming will lob a rock much further if he used to be a runner lemming. Another big difference is that rather than having to rescue a certain number, you can move on to the next level having saved just a single lemm'. However, for this you'd only receive a bronze medal and the game isn't truly finished until you collect gold medals from every level.

VERDICT SECOND OPINION The other main game view. Quite difficult to get used to. Like the perspective used In Kick Off 3. I think Rik is allowing his devotion to Sensi cloud his thinking. True, the SNES version is a bit lame, but the Mega Drive title is the best game of its kind. It takes a lot of getting used to the controls, but once you know what you're doing it's possible to pull off a limitless array of moves and employ genuine real-life tactics. Everyone probably has their soccer title by now, but if you haven't, Dino Dini's Soccer is the one footie game you should go for. RAD SNES This version wasn't programmed by Dino, and you can tell. I don't know what kind of Input he had in SNES Soccer, but I'm sure he can't be entirely happy with the results. It's not that it's a bad game, it's just that it lacks the pace, fluid gameplay and the precise control system of the other version. Mega Drive Dino notwithstanding this version is still not a happy bunny as far as footy games go. Not a disaster, but certainly not up to Premiership standards.

"REVIEW CUG MEGA DRIVE Platform Virgin unconfirmed Out Now SNES, Game Boy, Game Gear, NES and Master System versions soon to be released No other versions planned It's already one of the most successful films of all time. So is the latest 24-Meg Virgin/Disney blockbuster the undisputed king of the jungle? ew companies can claim to have Disney's track record. Just about everything it touches tends to turn into a squillion dollar business. Its most recent game licences have been handled by Virgin, with the platformers Aladdin and The Jungle Book proving that it is possible to marry a great licence with engrossing gameplay. the lion king The Lion King uses a similar platform engine to the above and casts the player as feline hero Simba, first as a cute youngster and later as he returns from the wilderness as a fully fledged lion. Coding duties here have been handled by Virgin stalwarts Westwood Studios, best known for Dune 2 and Young Merlin. Ten levels must be crossed in the game as Simba battles to regain his kingdom against the evil Scar. As usual in platformers, baddies are dispensed by a simple jump on their heads, but the claw slashing skill Simba acquires after turning into an adult can also be used. The brilliant between-thelevel animations taken from the movie also feature some of the best ever speech I've heard on Mega Drive. VERDICT BONUS BITZ Bonus levels are featured throughout the game. They add to the variety as the player controls film characters other than Simba. Bonus levels are featured throughout the game and these include Pumba, a muir cat, and Timon the warthog. Even level two is tough: here the monkeys have to be roared at in the right order so they will throw Samba further into the level. MEGA DRIVE Considering the pedigree of Virgin's previous Disney licences I was surprised to find Lion King disappointing. There's no doubting the quality of the animation, but the backgrounds feature a rather gaudy palette. The major problem is the gameplay though, which is far too difficult thanks to a ropey collision detection. A shame really, because I can see something similar to the excellent Mickey Mania lurking under the surface frustration. Stick with The Jungle Book. RIK SKEWS A The Lion King is tough and the Elephant graveyard is one of the more difficult levels. The animation is brilliant, particularly on Simba. Here he's trying to climb back onto the platform Prince of Persia style. GRAPHICS 85 SOUND PLAYABILITY 80 VALUE 81 ALTERNATIVE SNES Earthworm Jim Virgin/.99 Unbelievable graphics from Dave Perry and Shiny Entertainment coupled with humour and plenty of original touches.

"CVG REVIEW AMIGA Arcade Soccer Black Legend .99 Out Now No other versions available CD32 version planned CUTESY CRAZY Croteam have spent most of their time thinking up fun things for players to do, or so it seems. Could Black Legend's new Croatian arm have come up with the ultimate in arcade soccer games? 1. If you seriously injure a player, and the stretchers have to be brought on. These two guys will exam. ine the twitching player, shake their heads, then throw him on to the table. 2. If you disagree with the ref, you have the chance to argue with him, but the chances are nine times out of ten you'll lose. OK, that's a bit of a lie. Actually it's ten times out of ten. 3. It started in the US of A, and now they do it here. Whenever a goal is scored, the players will perform a little dance, or slap hands, or do backflips, or just do what comes to mind! or far too long, Sensible Soccer has ruled the roost when it comes to Amiga soccer games. Taking a trend started by Sensible years ago with MicroProse Soccer, which was then refined by Dino Dini and his Kick Off series, Sensi came out with a football game so smooth and playable, that everyone assumed it just couldn't be beaten. There was no way you could make the scrolling any smoother, the players any smaller, the animation any more convincing or the game any more enjoyable to play. Or could you? Croteam, as they are called, seem to think you can. They've examined Sensible Soccer very carefully, trying to work out what it is exactly that makes the game as playable as it is. Then they've taken that formula, and added a whole bunch of stuff that just hasn't been seen before. It all sounds like a flawless plan, but the proof of the pudding, as always, is in the playing of the game. Lory TES VERDICT A Sliding tackles are all well and good, but they are a very bad idea in the middle of the penalty box. Whenever a sliding tackle is badly performed, the medic is brought on to look the player over, and what a cute guy he is. AMIGA Many people will compare this with Sensible, but get past the initial level, however, and you start noticing a lot of differences. This game has a lot more character, with loads of cute little animations, and the sound is a real improvement. The extra moves are a lot of fun, but hard to master; be prepared to put quite in a few hours in practice mode. On the bottom line, this is different enough to Sensi, although whether you think it's any better is a matter of taste. TONY DILLON GRAPHICS 88 SOUND 84 PLAYABILITY 91 VALUE The ref almost never misses a trick, and dishes out yellow cards at the first sign of trouble. NEW MOVES A In this game, it's never too wet to go out and play, as this extremely muddy pitch shows. Football Glory features a whole host of new moves and tactics. Feast your eyes on these... COMING SOON 90 OVERALL CD32 Black Legend This should be more or less the same as the A1200 version, which is no bad thing, with all the same cute animations and smooth gameplay, although the audio should be even better. Stay tuned. EXPECTED RELEASE: JANUARY '95 1. The sliding tackles are just as lethal as ever, but these ones gouge huge pieces of turf from the ground. 2. The keeper can now leave the box to run for the ball, but can't pick it up, obvious. ly. Unfortunately, he can also be fouled and sent off! 3. If you have a sliding tackle unleashed at you, then a quick wiggle with the joystick allows you to jump over the attacker! 88 GAME BY CROTEAM BLACK LEGEND CONTACT (0438 840003) FOR INFORMATION BB "

Dirty songs and communal bath also not included... SPORTS AWA SCRUM AND GET IT Every time a foul is committed, the ref orders a scrum. This involves the majority of the players on the pitch locking shoulders and pushing together to create what appears to be a 20-legged insect! Into this, the ball is thrown, and the aim is to somehow hook it out to an awaiting flanker. However, the scrum can also be used to gain distance towards your opponent's line by using good old brute force to push them across it! hile footballers are associated with dodgy perms, night club exploits, and ending their careers by buying a pub, Rugby is a somewhat forgotten sport and only famed for hairy blokes singing rude songs in the team bath. Yet, every Saturday shortly before the Vidiprinter churns out yet another Everton defeat millions of armchair athletes watch 30 beefy blokes kick seven barrels out of each other in the pursuit of an oval ball. rugby world cui And so Rugby has been deemed popular enough to warrant an EA conversion to add to its evergrowing EA Sports label. Rugby World Cup could best be described as FIFA with an oddshaped ball, as the same isometric display is used to view the field. However, before Rugby is dismissed as a quickly-produced cash-in, note that it features every rule of the real thing, and better animation than its soccer forbearer. All the scrums, back passes, and conversions of the sport have been included, with the large sprites bundling in for scraps, tackles, line-ins and more scraps like a bunch of mini Carlings. Via combinations of the Mega Drive's three-pad buttons, the players can be made to pass, drop kick and fend off tackles as they bustle forwards for a try. Whenever the ball is out of the player's possession, the controls adapt to effect diving tackles and bone-crunching interceptions. GAME BY EA CONTACT EA (0753 549442) FOR INFORMATION 90 "


"REVIEW CVG :13 The computer intelligently places your team in an offensive passing line when the ball breaks for a run for goal. As anyone who has played the game knows, Rugby's a bit of a rough 'n' tumble sport and people are prone to getting hurt. Thankfully, the game sports a full subs bench. A try! Five points are awarded for each try as is the admiration of your team mates. RTS LIWA Pou Zatona SECOND OPINION Line-ins are called whenever the ball goes out of play. The player then guides the throw back to his team mates providing they can outjump the opposition. EA has gone to town on the game's animation, and the players jump and swerve to receive the ball, making Will Carling and his team look like a bunch of bloated no-hopers. As can be expected from an EA Sports game, Rugby World Cup includes a series of leagues from all around the world (but not the four nations for some reason), with all the greatest teams and international sides on offer, and each with differing skill levels. Quite simply, EA has excelled with Rugby. It is everything a sports sim should be and manages to capture the feel of the sport while retaining gameplay that hooks from the start. GARY LORD VERDICT CONVERSION CORNER, When the ball is finally bundled across the opponent's line for a try, five points are added to your score. However, a further three can also be added following a successful conversion Kick which basically involves punting the ball through the top half of your opponent's H-shaped goal. And this is how it works... 1. Set the angle of your kick. 2. Press the B button to increase the strength of your kick. However, as you do so, notice the accuracy marker to the left of the bar is reduced at a similar rate. MEGA DRIVE EA has produced a sports game more playable than FIFA! Unbelievable as this may seem, it isn't until you're fending off tackles and pulling off incredible passing runs that you realise just how instinctive and realistic this is. Graphically, the game is top-notch with more sprites on screen than thought possible, whilst the sound is enhanced by realistic grunts and groans as the players pile into each other. One of the best sports game on Mega Drive. MARK PATTERSON 3. Press B again to set the strength and press it again when it is in the centre of the accuracy bar for a hard, straight shot. 4. Now just wait to see if the ball sails through the H or whether your team mates will drown you in the postmatch bath... Such is the game's supreme control over the teams that a player in pos. session of the ball can be brought crashing simply by hooking his leg with a welltimed grab of the ankle! 1:54 GRAPHICS 92 SOUND 89 PLAYABILITY 93 I VALUE 90 The player under control is shown via a rather conspicuous pink disc beneath his feet.

"CVG REVIEW PC Arcade/Sim Bullfrog .99 Out Now PC-CD Rom version available No other versions planned CVG After the sheer addictiveness of Theme Park, Bullfrog has come up with what, quite possibly, is the PC game of the year. So grab your rug and prepare yourself for a roller-coaster ride, Arabian style... Your main weapon is the Fireball spell, weak compared to things like Meteor and Lightning but it makes short work of these Killer Bees. Mana comes in golden balls. To retrieve it, cast a possession spell on them which allows your hot-air balloon to suck them up like a vacuum cleaner. With all the spells at your disposal, you become practically invincible. There's Lightning, Invisibility, Speed-up, Teleport and many more. All of them can be selected from the map screen, or pre-programmed on the number keys 1-10. et on a mystical planet, ravaged by a brutal war, Magic Carpet is probably the most stunning PC game you'll see this year. Bullfrog's latest masterpiece allows you to hop on to an aerodynamic rug and fly over a rolling 3D landscape packed with hills, cliffs, deep canyons and huge, fire-spitting volcanoes. The idea is to restore the natural energy balance of 50 individual realms. This is achieved by destroying monsters, castles and other carpet-flyers and collecting the magical energy or 'Mana' they contain. This Mana takes the form of small golden balls and once you've destroyed, say a skeleton, you simply cast a possession spell on the Mana ball and wait for it to be picked up by your magical hot air balloon. Yes, that's right, a hot-air balloon. This handy contraption operates from your castle and relieves you of the mundane task of collecting all the Mana yourself. Mana is also important because it's the power that fuels your spells, which range from the bog-standard fireball and possession spells right up to the apocalyptic, earth-shattering power of Earth-quake, Meteor and Volcano spells. These are collected in each realm and, although you start off very weak, as you progress you have access to greater and greater fire-power. Of course, Magic Carpet isn't easy. Far from it. There are a host of monsters to contend with including Bees, Dragons and even the mythical kraken. And if these weren't bad enough, there are also other players to contend with, who on the later realms are attempting to collect the Mana for their own evil ends. It's simple to play, but fiendishly difficult to get any good at. I CAN SHOW YOU THE WORLD The superb intro tells how the world was ripped asunder by battling wizards and how you, a wizard's apprentice, must restore the world to its natural balance. When starting a level It's important to have a castle to store all the Mana your balloon collects. The more Mana you collect the bigger your fortress can be. As well as playing Magic Carpet in nor mal mode, if you grab a pair of those cheap 3D glasses and tap the F10 key, you can also play in full stereoscopic 3D. 92 GAME BY BULLFROG CONTACT ELECTRONIC ARTS (0753 549442) MAGIC CARPET IS ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES TO HAVE PENTIUM RECOMMENDED' ON THE BOX "


"REVIEW CVG Each creature contains Mana. The bigger they are (like these Kraken), the more Mana they hold. Sometimes, you just want to get on your carpet and go... And then some flippin' flapin' monster gets right in your slipstream... One of the most destructive spells is the Volcano, a very handy incantation whether you want to destroy a castle, waste a skeleton army or just have a little pyrotechnic fun. Luckily you have the right amount of Mana to make him into monster pie. SECOND OPINION The 50 realms in Magic Carpet contain a variety of dangerous creatures. The skeletons are easy to kill but these Gorillas chuck huge boulders at you and are more tricky. At last, a CD game that takes full advantage of the power of the PC and CD-ROM. Magic Carpet is a superb game. The attention to detail is amazing and while Bullfrog has chosen to leave out the chase-view where you could see your magic carpet from behind, with the multi-player options, 3D mode and the huge amount of gameplay stuffed into the game, this has turned out to be a true PC 'epic'. If you're looking for a candidate for CD game of the year, Magic Carpet is most definitely it. STEVE JAMES VERDICT carpet PC Magic Carpet is a stunning game and almost faultless. The 3D engine is amazingly detailed and smooth and although the gameplay can get repetitive, the huge variety of monsters and spells will keep you hooked for aeons. Best of all, there's a multi-player option which lets you battle your friends Doom-style. Imagine chucking meteors at your mates or creating a volcano in their path... If you've a CD-ROM drive and a fast machine, Magic Carpet is a must buy. DEAN EVANS GRAPHICS 95 SOUND 94 PLAYABILITY 96 VALUE 95 To gain Mana shoot the monsters until they explode and give up their Mana ball. When you run out of monsters, shoot the civilians. Then castles, then tents, etc. As you get more powerful you can pick up new spells. The Earthquake spell cuts spectacular canyons across the landscape and destroys everything in its path. When you've destroyed all the monsters, levelled all the buildings and collected all the Mana, the realm's restored and you move on to the next challenge. After every level you get a short cut-scene and things get tougher. More and bigger monsters and even computer-controlled rug-flyers who want all your Mana.

"CVG REVIEW SNES/GAME BOY I Virgin ISNES.99/GB.99 Out November No other versions available No other versions planned Virgin and Probe get involved with a Macauley Culkin film tie-in involving lots of spooks, books and pretty platforms... Now if books were this mouch fun wen was i Smalle then maybe I wasn't be so bad at spelling and riting. merica seems to have had a litany of precocious child movie stars, Shirley Temple, Drew Barrymore and the subject of this latest movie-game tie-inMacauley Culkin. And, yes, apart from them all being highly eligible adoption candidates (ie they're loaded), they are all incredibly P.A.I.N.F.U.L. But seeing as the now teenster has been cast as the central character in the new movie, The Pagemaster, then the main sprite does not look dissimilar to Master Culkin. The film itself is about a neurotic boy taking refuge from a storm in a library, and who then goes on a magical trip with the characters Adventure, Fantasy and Horror. The game is set around similar themes to the film, ie the obstacles are poltergeist-style books that chase after you; ghosts, rolling pumpkins, and giant bookcases you have to negotiate your way across. The levels are not always linear, so the route out does not always seem obvious, and when you go back to previously completed levels, you always seem to find unchartered territory. Each scene has an abundance of stylish backgrounds and Mode 7 scrolling, but at the end of the day, chapter, page or whatever it's just another couple of platformers to add to the glut of titles out there. mnade GAME BOY ster SNES Watch the bottom of the screen and then make up your mind which way to jump. It's like bungee jumping only safer. Much. GAME BOY Just so that you don't have to start (as Julie Andrews said) at the very beginning, there are restart points. If you're the proud owner of a Super Game Boy you get these totally fab bor. ders to distract you from the game. MACAULEY'S MAZE A spritlier sprite you will not find than the Macauley clone that you control in Pagemaster.

SNES Pagemaster is a highly polished SNES platformer, with all the requisite Mode 7 spooky-house effects that the licence for the PageMaster film no doubt requires. Graphically the look is cutesey and Tim Burton-ish; the difficulty level is pitched about right, although some levels are sods to get through.

Issue 156: 90% GAME BOY It borrows much from its 16 bit cousin, but sometimes this is irritating: flying objects can be difficult to distinguish, and a bugger to avoid or kill. In both games there are bonuses to speed you on your way, but much of the game's appeal is the lush graphics on the SNES which can't be repeated here. The varied levels make up for this with Tetris-stylee vertical scrollers being the most fun. The Bame Boy version's not a bad game, but it's not brill' either.

It still hasn't quite got enough sparkle within it to make it really shine through. And it's ridiculously priced for what it is. The Game Boy version is actually quite bland, with annoying sprite control and a lack of variety in the levels.

The look and feel of the game is similar to Bubba 'n' Stix, although it's pure action, lacking the puzzle element of Core Design's classic. The humour's certainly up to scratch though, but can the gameplay match it? A Levels often have sub-zones featured within them. They're accessed via the main level and optional but they're worth checking out as they feature plenty of bonuses. VERDICT U. Queas A Dig through all the rubbish as most of it contains a bonus. START Pass MEGA DRIVE OK, the main gag here is about bogies and snot, but Interplay has laboured the joke well and the sound FX are as equally amusing. Thankfully the gameplay is equally as good with perfect control and a finely balanced difficulty curve. There's an awful lot of variety and plenty of hidden rooms too, so lastability is assured. Like Earthworm Jim, there's nothing really new here, but everything hangs together so well as a package that I'd definitely recommend it. RIK SKEWS The graphics are really in your face, but it's the the animation which really catches, ney hits, you in the eye. ALTERNATIVE AMIGA Bubba 'n' Stix Company/.99 More puzzle orientated than Boogerman, but otherwise it plays in a similar fashion and sports equally pleasant graphics.

"CVG REVIEW MEGA-CD Shoot-'em-up Core Design .99 Out Now Mega 32 version planned No other versions available Core Design presents yet another ace MegaCD shoot-'em-up. You'd never have guessed it from them, would you eh? CVG HITI ou might think you've got a bit of a dodgy name. Perhaps it's Tarquin, or Jocasta. But spare a thought for the potentially peace-loving aliens whom fate short-sightedly dubbed the Myrkoids. Ridiculed throughout the universe for their soppy nomenclature, the Myrkoids had no choice but to resort to mass genocide in an effort to quell the galactic mickey-taking. And now you, as the equally foolishly monikered Bryk Hammelt, have to stop them. The turbocopter is the hardest of the craft to get the hang of controlling, but probably the most enjoyable to pilot once you know what you're doing. soulstaro Onu Luckily, Bryk is an almost-immortal Cryo-Commando (it says here), with a wide range of ace hardware at his disposal, which allows him to combat the nefarious Myrksters in space, over planet surfaces and even in their subterranean bases. The third-person rear perspective doesn't change no matter what vehicle you're ensconced in, but the playstyle veers from a Galaxy Force-esque shoot 'em up to free-roaming Battlecorps-stylee combat walker levels, via some rather natty turbocopter sections reminiscent of Thunderhawk. The objectives of each mission vary quite widely, but one thing they have in common is the large number of evil enemies you're required to annihilate. In fact, let's not beat around the bush, this is a mega-death-akimbo shoot 'em up. There's a satisfying array of weapons on offer to do the job with and a wide range of enemies, each with their own attack strategies, to do in. Only one spazzily-titled force can survive. WIRE-FRAME BRIEFS All the enemies you encounter in the game have their own attack strategies, which you would do well to learn. Before each mission you're greeted with this rather pretty computer briefing. The wire frame graphics show you what you're supposed to do while a computer voice describes your objectives. It pays to listen to what's being said until you've played the game a few times or you'll completely lose the plot. If you're in real trouble, you can always call on your mothership to drop a big smart bomb on your foes although there's a limit to the number of times you can do this. Turbocopter may look like a handheld rechargeable vacuum cleaner, but it is in fact a deadly war machine. GAME BY CORE DESIGN CONTACT CORE DESIGN (0332 297797) FOR INFORMATION 100 "


"REVIEW CVG AN INTRO WITH SOUL The combat walker is a little slow-moving, but these rocket boosters allow you to speed around for a limited time, and also avoid groundbased hazards. The game begins with this lovely FMV digitised intro, with a voice-over explaining the plot in full. They also say \"Myrkoids\" a lot, which is quite funny, strangely. THE DECISION... IS YOURS This ace scene has you chasing a rather cool excavator through a long tunnel. VERDICT A One of the missions you face entails penetrating this dastardly looking space station-effect Death Star-type thing, using all three of your mechanised transformations. There's lots of death and violence, which we like. The three combat craft vary in how easy they are to use. The space fighter is a piece of cake to handle, while the turbocopter and robot walker require the player to keep a handle on gun angles, altitude and other such bothersome considerations. Fortunately it's possible to rope another player in to handle gunning duties while you steer the vehicle (or, indeed, vice versa). MEGA-CD While the turbocopter and combat walker may bring Core's previous efforts Thunderhawk and Battle. corps to mind, SoulStar is more destruction-based than its predecessors, and it builds on Core's rep' for groundbreaking and innovative Mega-CD titles. My only criticism is the space fighter sections are a little wobbly compared to the strategic shooting action of the other two available craft. Still, Mega-CD owners should have this down as their next purchase. RAD AUTOMATIC COMING SOON GRAPHICS 95 SOUND 96 PLAYABILITY 92 VALUE 90 16 OVERALL MEGA DRIVE 32X Soulstar Core/Unconfirmed Already underway is the spanking-looking 32-BIT version of this very game which Core hope will establish them in the next generation scene. EXPECTED RELEASE: EARLY '95 Whilst your sub-light strike craft is used primarily in space, it's also useful for strafing ground units as you approach planetary installations. 91 101 "


"CVG REVIEW CD-i Shoot-'em-up Philips .99 Out Now 3DO version available No other versions planned mad dog mCcreen «We don' need no steenkin' badges just one of those eenfra-red light guns, senr blondie...\" hile Mad Dog McCree had a pretty horrid time on 3D0, it seems like the producers CapDisc and Philips have waved their cure-all wand over the CD-i version to produce an almost perfect rendition of the coin-op original. I say almost perfect because, despite their best efforts, there's still a slight lag between shooting some characters and them actually dying. However, this doesn't really affect the gameplay, and there's the added advantage that the game uses the digital video cartridge and comes complete with a decent, responsive lightgun. Two points to remember first it helps if your telly's 21 inches or bigger, since some of the smaller targets are almost impossible to hit on anything smaller, and you need to be about 10 feet away from the screen. If you can manage that little lot, you'll probably find yourself enjoying one of the most fun, and mindless CD-i games around. Just pick-up the gun, calibrated and bring your very own brand of law enforcement to the Old West. BAD ACTING SCHOOL Here are a few of the highly trained professional thespians you encounter in the game. Each one is trained to the peak of their acting prowess, which is about as high as a molehill which has subsequently then been flattened by a steamroller driven by an overweight elephant. In Dr Martin's VERDICT Look at the old man. See him bleed. Grab his bus pass and pension book before he comes round. They went to RADA you know. Yes, the horses are in fact the best actors in the game. CD-i Mad Dog is such good fun. The acting's bad, the sets flimsy, the stuntmen are over-cautious it's just like one of those Wild West shows they have at theme parks. Here though, you get to rampage through the town shooting everybody. The price is the key point when it comes to buying the game, however. If you've got money to burn, it's well worth it. But it is almost double the price of a normal CD-i title. All I can say is I liked it, but can you afford it? MARK PATTERSON A Test your accuracy on the shooting range by blasting inoffensive beer bottles. If this guy's calibrated his gun as badly as me, he'll probably shoot himself in the back of the head. \"No Mr Undertaker, honest, it was only a flesh wound. I feel so much better now.\" BANKA GRAPHICS 90 SOUND 91 PLAYABILITY 88 VALUE 65 OTHER VERSIONS OVERALL Lame graphics compared to the CD-I's, and the weapon control is appalling every time a shot is fired there's a dreadful pause while the CD chugs away.

"CVG REVIEW A1200 Graphic adventure Empire .99 Out Now PC, CD-ROM also available CD32 version planned EBERTSOPERT This 'adult' game has been at the eye of a storm of controversy over its diet of sex and violence but how much advice on what's good for you can you swallow? Things are never what they seem, and even a sofa can hold hidden treasures. HOFSIDONLOUIS o what's so good about oodles of juicy violence and lashings (well a little slap, actually) of bonking spied from a pervy bird's eye view? Plenty, that's what! Scenes where gunshot-ridden victims drag their giblets across the floor are anything but polite, but gratuitous violence aside, 18 certificate Dreamweb is something of a steaming, occasionally, er dreamy, graphic adventure. Set in the future in a world gone wrong, the Dreamweb is the power which keeps the city on the proverbial straight and narrow. However, the darker side is gaining strength and has entered the warm bodies of seven people (No, we haven't got to the sex yet Ed.). The keepers of the Dreamweb get together and elect you Ryan to pursue the seven unfortunates and to pick them off one by one before the Dreamweb succumbs to evil. Starting off with no money, weapons or info, you must work out from the many items and people around just exactly what you need to eradicate the sods. Everything in the game is crafted with loving amounts of detail and lots of humour. Characters like the wino outside Sparky's bar, who just grunts when you try to talk to him, bring back fond memories of games gone by, like the Monkey Island series. Enjoy. Dreamweb features a very intuitive point and click interface. All you have to do is drag the mouse across to an item and either use it immediately or dump it in your inventory. A The city of the future is a nasty place to be. Everywhere you look, people are either lying drunk or lying dead! VERDICT dreamweb A1200 Dreamweb is brain-teasing graphic adventure at its best. Its point-and-click Interface makes it easy to get into, and with the game comes Ryan's diary, which contains some very important tips. The graphics are moody and atmospheric and add to the sinister plot of the game. One minor niggle is that the game screen only takes up one eighth of the overall screen. Luckily, there is a zoom option so don't let that deter you from an otherwise engaging game. LISA COLLINS A Outside your buddy Louis' flat you get your best trainers nicked. What a bummer. A Most games these days use the LucasArts side-on viewpoint, but Dreamweb favours a more traditional 'Top down' view on the world. TOO HOT TO HANDLE There's splattering and there's a smattering. A smattering of sex and some frighteningly realistic violence, which is why the game gets its grown-up certificate. OK, some may find it disturbing planning, plotting and carrying out executions. As for the luurve scenes, however, well they're more funny than shocking because the sprites are so tiny you can hardly see what sex they are let alone who's in what position. And as Dreamweb is an overhead-view game you only have a bird's eye view of all the gyrations. COMING SOON 75 The main reason Dreamweb has received an 18 certificate is the because of the sex and violence. GRAPHICS 85 SOUND PLAYABILITY 90 VALUE 86 OVERALL CD32 Dream Web Empire The speech will be rather special allegedly, thanks to a script by programming team Neil Dodwell and Dave Drew, and a cast of professional luvvies and voice-over men.

"CVG REVIEW SUPER NES Puzzle Sunsoft .99 Out December No other versions available No other versions planned Gee, I wande red into this strange world again.. Destined to be mispronounced for eternity is this latest extremely Japanese port-over puzzler... heberekers pop LOOS n case you hadn't noticed, games companies have realised that a cleverly marketed character can really sell a game which may, in any other light, be a bit on the arse side. However, blazing a trail through the dole queues of Pinkys, Puggsys, Bubsys and Flinks is the divine form of genuine superstar-inwaiting Hebereke, a kind of small flightless bird thing. This is the first of a series of Hebereke games Sunsoft plans to release here, and while at first glance it might not look like anything new it really does bode well for future titles in the plucky young fowl's range. Aided and abetted by his equally quirky friends, Hebereke has added his own twist to the much-explored Tetris clone territory. Popoons (round things with goggly eyes) each one of four different colours, fall in pairs from the top of the screen. You, have to rack them up in straight line of three, whereupon they disappear, and PoroPoros make their debut. These are little icons bearing the head of your character which are deposited in the opponent's play area every time you complete a line, and vice versa. The more lines you complete with each Popoon drop the more PoroPoros you manufacture. The only way to get rid of these is to match them up with a Popoon of the correct colour, depending on the character responsible for their presence. This may sound a bit too close to Puyo Puyo for comfort, but the two-player mode, detailed elsewhere, makes Popooning very much different to previous games of this kind. In the Story Mode you're treated to these wonderful conversations between characters at the beginning and end of every level. Ha, ha, ha, ha! (A loud laugh). THE MOON'S A POPOON 0000920 ACRESC-0001 1511 50X056 The two-player game features a major new element not seen in the singleplayer story mode that of special attacks. If you're skillful enough to drop three or four lines at a time, then your character performs one of their signature moves, which range from dropping a screen-clearing 16-ton weight on your accumulated Popoons which freezes the opposing screen solid, necessitating a reciprocal special attack to clear the new icy Popoons It's another of the wacky special attacks which make the game the fun-filled feast it truly is. Praise be! oloCADEL ICIDE BO000 00 000,00 SC_000072541 0 0009671R TU Hà 16 The level meters in the centre of the screen denote the game speed. The higher the level, the better you're doing.

Here's the choice of characters, each of whom has their own range of attacks. And a cute little nose. Or beak. 16|| CEO TOOTOJO se are 15 This special manoeuvre freezes the target's screen, meaning the Popoons and PoroPoros you're waiting for mount up to potentially lethal levels until things get moving again. DUISANTSOL oan SUNOST Doubtless you'll spend much time on this screen trying to decipher the mountains of strange sampled speech. VERDICT SC00000107. SCORRER UNE Svona Some of the characters warn you of an impending attack. Beware of Hebereke's stretchy neck especially, which signals the use of his devastating Cut-Throat Attack. SUPER NES I can take or leave most of the Tetris clones we've seen since the release of the original, and I reckon the one-player mode is fairly tame, but with two human players going head-to-head Hebereke is fantastic. The special attacks places a whole new spin on things, even if it does take a while to work out how you're supposed to do anything. Almost impossibly fast on speed levels above fifty, this is a real test of skill and strategy so long as you've got a worthy opponent on hand at all times. RAD AUTOMATIC ALTERNATIVE MEGA DRIVE/GAME BOY Puyo Puyo Sega/Banpresto One of the best puzzle games ever to come on a cartridge. Very similar to Hebereki's, but we feel the SNES game just has the edge in playability. NOT PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED As you can see, sometimes it's harder than you'd think to fit three Popoons into a straight line with enemy PoroPoros constantly plummeting on to your screen. SECOND OPINION GRAPHICS 83 SOUND 92 PLAYABILITY 93 VALUE 86 OVERALL I normally despise this sort of game, I mean I've played Tetris to death, why should I want to see it any more? But after having sat down to trounce Rad at a few rounds of Hebereki's I'm prepared to make an exception. The game really comes into its own when you've survived a few rounds and the speed rate is pushed right up. Not too fast to play, but it's pulse battering fun all the way. Top stuff. 91 MARK PATTERSON 109 "

"REVIEW CVG PC Shoot-'em-up Gametek .99 Out Now Floppy version available No other versions planned 2932 HIDE N'SHRIEH TITANIUM OCE Would-be Travis Bickles should be cocking their hoops over Gametek's psychotic new PC release... SOD A The top-right box shows your armour rating not bad in this case. PUNISHER here's a lot more to worry about than a midnight trip south of the river with this latest homage to the cab driver's art. OK, dealing with nine year-old crack dealers may be an occupational hazard to today's for-hire drivers, but the chauffeurs of tomorrow face a constant assualt of guns, bombs, mines, molotov cocktails and ramming, barging enemy taxis, along with abusive fares who wee on the back seat. Luckily, in true post-apocalyptic stylee, you are tooled up with a couple of hoodmounted machine guns, with optional chain guns once you've earned the cash. Obviously, with taxi driving being a hazardous occupation, fares have risen somewhat. and the average pick-up is worth around four or five hundred dollars, providing you can deliver your passenger within a strict time limit. This chronological constraint means there's little time for social niceties. If someone's fool enough to try crossing the road it's best to run them over (save your ammo for other motors), which also treats you to a splash of blood and gore over your windshield. Besides, there's every possibility they're going to have a pop at you anyway. If there's one particular hoodlum getting your goat, switch to left or right window view and let rip with your Uzi in a Virtual Drive-By scenario. Quarantine is for people who are bored of Doom (or Doom 2) or fancy playing the game in hover cars. There's plenty of violence and MDE N'S RIER destruction, along with some naughty words and strange encounters with potential customers. However, don't expect anything like the level of strategy Doom's capable of this is screeching tyres and blazing gatts all the way. A kill the tank! Kill it! Kill it you fool! 20 VERDICT PC A This is just one of the many highpowered weapons available to you shold you wish to destroy people. Quarantine might be an incredible pain to actually get working, but once you manage to get the thing running It's actually quite good fun. Picking up and dropping off the passengers gives you a few shortterm goals, and riding around killing people in your cab is, of course, highly enjoyable. However, there isn't much substance to it, and it lacks any real long-term appeal. If virtual killing's your thing you'd be better off with Doom 2: Hell on Earth. RAD AUTOMATIC NITRO You, as the player, have two choices here either to run every. one over or just shoot them. Ah, the glory of the open road! Nothing to worry about but a wide open space of tarmac.

"CUG REVIEW SNES Platform/Shoot-'em-up .99 Out November No other versions avallable No other versions planned JVC CVG In a galaxy quite near, about-half an hour ago, a journalist wheels out all the old Star Wars clichés, and wonders whether he'll be able to vanquish the evil Lord Vader and save the universe in time for EastEnders? HITI super return of the ONCE UPON A BLOCKBUSTER Super Jedi follows the story of the film fairly closely and is broken down into three main missions, each comprising several stages. THE BEGINNING The first objective is to rescue Han and this starts with a nice bit of Mode 7 as you navigate a landspeeder across the chasms of Tatooine. This is followed by a bit of proton and whiprelated death-dealing outside and within Jabba's hut where Han is being held in cryogenic suspension. Or summink. THE MIDDLE The next mission sees our hearty crew facing an early bath on the brim of the Rancor pit before taking to speed bikes for a bit of argy-bargy in the Mode 7 forests of Endor. Thence it's to the trees with the cute-but-deadly Wicket, before a bit of Shield Generator destroying SCORE n all probability you won't finish this game in time for EastEnders, and even if you do you're going to want to play through it again. You see Super Return Of The Jedi offers much more than the previous two games in the Star Wars series. Not so much in terms of variety the game is still a mix of shooty platform sections intercut with shooty Mode 7 sections. No, Super Jedi offers players an increased number of ways to accomplish themselves thanks to the larger number of selectable characters and, in turn, more, bigger power-ups and interesting ways to deal out a stellar spanking to the assortment of intergalactic scum. Super Return of the Jedi generally gives the player three choices of character before starting a level and highlights the character most appropriate in each case. Although in certain examples only one character is selectable. Luke, for instance, will be your only choice when it comes to that final showdown with the Emperor. But hey! Otherwise you're free to shove the game's advice and pick who you want. It's your game and your funeral. Probably. THE END The finale starts with the Falcon struggling against swarms of TIES on the Death Star. Next Han, Chewie or Leia must knock out the shield generator and Luke must conclude some unfinished business with Vader and the Emperor before the final mad scramble to destroy the Death Star.

"REVIEW CVG FIVE GO MAD IN SPACE There is now a choice of five faces from the movie: Luke Skywalker, Chewie, Han Solo, Wicket the Ewok and Princess Leia. LUKE SKYWALKER Luke has now mastered the ways of the Force and is able to send his Lightsabre out, boomerangstyle, in search of its prey as well as freeze oncoming baddies, reflect enemy fire and render himself invisible. Eating Dirt Jedi-style part one: Stand in close proximity to an Empire Laser Cannon and kiss your ass goodbye. HAN SOLO Han only becomes selectable once he's been rescued and is a more down to earth than Luke as he uses a simple blaster to great effect and is also a bit tasty with the odd bomb and Thermal Detonator or two. CHEWBACCA Chewie is much the same but adds a furr-ious Fireball Spin to his repertoire. A \"Hey little teddy bear, y'wanna lift? Sweets? I got some nice puppies...\" WWW . WICKET THE EWOK Wicket is, well, a bit crap really, but comes into his own on his home planet, the forest-covered Endor, where his arrows make ad-hoc stepladders to climb the giant trees. The thing about Ewoks is that they look cute, even when they're mercilessly slaughtering defenceless creatures. VERDICT PRINCESS LEIA Last and, believe me, by no means least is Leia, tonight sporting three lavish outfits. In her Boush outfit she is able to summon a damaging energy beam and do a tidy bit of damage with a staff, whilst in her Rebel uniform she acquires the services of a laser blaster. But it is, woof woof, when she dons her bikini in the palace of Jabba and gets busy with her whip, arrooh, that she most impresses. Generally speaking it's not a good idea to hook up with these birds, they only want you for one thing lunch! SNES Super Jedi is similar to its predecessors, but the extra characters and varying abilities add new depth, whilst the increased size and complexity of most levels adds a lot more fun. The music is as awesome as ever play it on big, bassy speakers. The only fly in this cosmic ointment is it's too easy to complete thanks to the password system. However, if you limit your continues and crank it up to Jedi level, Super Return Of The Jedi is the best in the series. Until Ultra Star Wars, that is...

Boasting a running time up to seven times longer than other batteries they're great for power suckers like the Game Gear. Other benefits include their 30% lighter weight and the fact they contain no environment harming mercury or cadmium. Downside is price. At .99 for two, they're not cheap but if you can afford it we reckon they're amongst the best around.

A power pack is also included. We've also become rather attached to the Power Pack Plus (.99) and Power Grip Plus (.99), available for the Game Boy and Game Gear respectively. Plugging into the battery compartments the Game Boy product offers 10 hours play, the Game Gear 2.5. Excellent for saving on batteries and of more interest to us, avoiding the hassle of trying to find an empty power point in this building! MORE LMP GOODIES Following on from LMP's excellent Mega Drive and SNES joypads featured in last month's Extras, the Hertfordshire-based firm have kindly supplied us with more goodies from their extensive catalogue.

"CVG Q&A HELP! WHAT CONSOLE DO I WANT? So you're all at sea and feeling afloat in an ocean of new machines? Which one's the best? Well, throw away those baby inflatable life rings, and would the next man overboard please meet the captains of our help section... I want to move in to the world consoles so I'm considering buying a CD32, Jaguar, 32X or something else. What do you recommend? Also, what overall mark would you give Cybermorph on the TO Jaguar today? Paul Georgenson, North Wales. KEYBOARD AND PRIMAL JAG? I've just purchased a Jaguar and would like to know if there'll be a keyboard attachment. And will the Atari Primal Rage coin-op be converted to the Jaguar? Also, can you get a SCART connection for a UK Jaguar? David Fisher, Belfast When Atari first announced the Jaguar, we were also told that a Jaguar 2 console would be developed as well as a computer that would use the Jaguar's circuits. No more news on these as yet, but there's no reason why a keyboard couldn't be designed for the current Jag console. Time Warner will be releasing Primal Rage on Jaguar, while a SCART and audio lead for the Jaguar will cost around . This provides a sharper picture but doesn't speed up or remove borders off the games that's not possible with a UK machine. Technically, the CD32 is a fine machine, but many developers fail to explore the potential it offers. With the superior Saturn, PlayStation and Ultra64 consoles wait. ing in the wings the chances of the CD32 competing equally are very unlikely. With the Jaguar there's plenty of potential, but Atari is being cautious about its market. ing and is now looking to develop a stronger selection of titles over a much greater period of time than expected. Certainly the PlayStation seems to be a big favourite at this time, and the software for it is looking impressive. Evidently, the 3DO, PlayStation, Saturn and Ultra 64 will be the consoles to get if you want to play accurate coinop conversions depending on what you can afford. Sega's 32X is also likely to take the coin-op route, but technically this system isn't equipped to offer the best performance. So, if you want a machine this side of Christmas, go for a Sony PlayStation on import. Alternatively, Nintendo's Ultra 64 is likely to be the dream machine it promises by the close of 1995. Oh yes, Cybermorph. We gave this 79% in our January issue, but today it's probably worth around 60% even as a freebie. The graphics are still good but it severely lacks long term gameplay.

"Q&A CVG PC POSERS Is there a vast difference between a 486SX and a 486DX PC? Secondly, will the new Sony Mini Disc format be used for computers or consoles? Keith Munro, Edinburgh. SNES TO MAC CONVERSION I'm about to make a drastic move from my SNES to a Macintosh computer and I need some help. 1) What's the difference between the Apple CD300 and the Power CD drives? 2) What's the difference between the 68LC040 and a 68040 processor and can I upgrade from a 68040? 3)What's the difference between a Quadra 660AV and a Quadra 650AV? 4) Will Quadras and Centris Macs get cheaper? 5) From what you've told me which Mac should I buy? Christian Vondermeule, Belgium 1)The Apple CD 3001 is an external CD-ROM drive which unlike its predecessors does not require a caddy and is the fastest drive Apple makes. The Power CD is a single speed drive, but it's portable, and can be used as a CD Walkman. It also has a facility to plug straight into the telly to be used as a Kodak CD viewer (although the 300i can be used for Kodak CDs, it can't be plugged into the TV). 2) The difference is that the 68LC040 processor does not have a maths-coprocessor. This won't make much difference unless you do lots of spreadsheet work or 3D rendering. For upgrading there are two options: A Logic board upgrade which is expensive or Math-coprocessor software. This is slow, but cheap (-40) and probably your best option. 3) There is no such Mac as the 650AV. There was a Quadra 650. which was discontinued. The 660AV is based on the Quadra/Centris 610, but with the bonus of DSP processors for graphics applications. 4) Yes. 5) If you want a fast, inexpensive machine, then look at the new Macintosh 630. It's got a 300 CD-ROM drive built-in, a big hard disk, upgradability and the option of a TV tuner to impress your mates with. Plus a remote control for the CD and TV, 16-bit stereo and video input and output sockets. Impressive eh? The main difference between an SX and DX PC is price, so always check what you're getting for your money. An SX CPU doesn't have a built-in maths co-processor like a DX one so it's essentially a lot slower. A 33mhz THE HELP! LINE 486SX system isn't that much faster than a 386DX!

"CVG Q&A HELP! 3DO ADD-ON FULL MOTION ANSWERS I'm thinking of purchasing a Panasonic 3D0 and have a few queries: I'm trying to convince my other half that we need a new console and could do with some questions answered. 1) Which of the new systems comes with FMV built-in? 2) Are FMV movies playable on any supporting machines? 3) How do the new CD machines save games? 4) Do the new consoles have monitor and hi-fi outputs? Clive Marner, Nottingham 1. Will the cartridge add-on for the 3D0 have the same specification as the Bulldog? 2. Is the 3D0 capable of producing games like Daytona USA? 3. Will the 3DO have a VR helmet? 4. What about a keyboard and printer? L. Weston, Leicestershire PHILIPS 1. Yes. 2. Yes, although the graphics wouldn't be quite as sharp on a standard 3DO. It remains to be seen what the Bulldog is capable of, but judging by its spec Daytona USA shouldn't prove a problem. 3. Possibly 4. Again, it's a possibility but there's no news as yet. 1) None of the new consoles come with built-in FMV. As FMV only tends to be used for movies currently the add-on is sold separately to keep the main unit price low. The CDi-450 however, is bundled with a Digital Video board but it costs quite a bit. 2) Philips is responsible for CDV films. The early movies will only run on CD-i machines, but all the recent titles are generic. 3) All the CD consoles save to DRAM, but this only permits a few saves which isn't much use. The most elegant is the PlayStation which uses a slot-in card above the joystick port. Apart from being able to save many games these cards can be used to add extra levels to existing ones too. 4) All the new consoles we've seen have Land R audio outputs because obviously you can play audio CDs on them. Although the new console's visual outputs vary, there's always a suitable lead for connection to a monitor. Don't worry.

"CVG NEO GEO SPECIAL TEKNO NEO-GEO CD SPECIAL Warning: Neo Geo Area For years now the Neo Geo's been the most powerful games system you could have in your home. Finally it's affordable and it's over here... New kid in town It's not often we're taken by surprise but this was really a bolt out of the blue. Of course we'd been wanting to get our hands on a Neo Geo CD, but we never expected to get a call from a company saying that 'Yes, it is coming out, yes, so are the games, and yes, we'll bring one along for you to play with'. It transpired that the distribution deal was struck a fortnight before the machine came in to us and, amazingly, it would be on the shelves by November 1, along with 14 games. So it's out there now, lurking on the shelves and getting ready for the Christmas rush. Arcade games If you're not familiar with the Neo Geo, well then you probably don't get down to the arcades much. For several years now, the Neo Geo has been a favourite of arcade owners all over the country. Not just because it's a fantastic machine, but because it's a cheap, interchangeable system. The cartridge-based home version, which was launched three years ago boasted all the same specs and software, although because of the enormous size of the cartridges (some are in excess of 200M-bits) the games retailed for up to . So, it's not as if there were many people out there who could afford a regular supply of software. Basically the new console is just like the Neo Geo An arcade-quality machine for less than ! 122 "


"NEO GEO SPECIAL CVG cd access In a perfect world the Neo Geo CD would have a quad-speed CD drive, but then again, it would probably cost about a grand. Still, what's a little loading time when you're just about to play some top coin-op title?

Now that you can own the original for less than the cartridge conversion, this has to be top of the list for new Neo Geo CD owners. Once you've got the game, it's well worth splashing out on an extra joypad because, as good as it is, you can't beat a head-to-head Shodown with a mate. It was the only game to rival Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat in the arcades, but unlike those it never got the quality of conversion it deserved on home machines. It's very much in the SNK'S unique style of beat-'emup, with hugely over-thetop sound effects and preposterous moves. One thing's for sure and that's Samurai Shodown owes much more to Japanese B-movies than it does to other beat-'em-ups which is one of the reasons why it was so popular. The gratuitously violent special moves are also noteworthy since your average player can produce most of them, but the real match winners are purely the domain of the pros So you're guaranteed a period of .99 Out Now 106M-bits Alpha Mission2 .99 Out Now 47M-bits Vertically scrolling shoot'em-ups have all but vanished off the face of the planet this year that's not the case on Neo Geo, though. Alpha Mission 2 doesn't exactly do much to further the genre, especially since it features more clichés than your average day time soap. One thing it definitely is, though, is tough. So tough, in fact, that even in the two-player mode isn't any easier and that's without fighting over who should get the next power-up. What doesn't help is the number of bosses you encounter. The programmers obviously thought this was a good idea at the time, but it often serves to make the gameplay disjointed and even tougher. However, there are plenty of you lot out there in Punterville who reckon themselves to be a bit good at shoot-'em-ups. And it's exactly those people who should take advantage of a game like this to see just how clever they really are. he original Japanese version of the game described itself with phrases like ...the power and presence of full memory action' and 'boil your blood with the sensation of reallife play.' In fact, the games nothing like as outlandish as the claims, and is, in fact, the best footy title for the Neo Geo. Most of the game is played like a conventional football sim until you take a long shot, at which point the view changes to an excellent 3D scene where you've got to steer the ball past the *keeper, or spoon it over while you're marvelling at the graphics. The only thing we don't like about the game is the Japanese ads for it, which features the flags of such footballing giants as China, Australia and Canada, but makes absolutely no mention of the lads from over here.

"TEKNO NEO GEO CD CVG NUS 7 Kg RYO Art Of Fighting Unconfirmed Out December 178M-bits No, really there is an art to fighting other than kicking the other fella in the knackers and running away. In fact, the programmers got it down to such a fine art that we reckon Art Of Fighting 2 puts Street Fighter 2 in the shade. It's not just that there are more moves, better special attacks and the gameplay is better paced. Or that the graphics are more imaginative and the sound is sonically astounding, or that SNK has managed to push beat-'em-ups further ahead with this one game while Capcom is still telling us that Street Fighter 2 Turbo Extra Dooper Splendo edition is, like, pretty cool, you know? Basically, if there's one reason why you should buy a Neo Geo CD, you're looking at it. Art Of Fighting 2 has got the lot. It's not just another beat-'em-up. STEEL NINA 50 Last Resort ule .99 Out Now 45M-Bits There's nothing like taking someone else's idea and blatantly ripping it off. Well, there are a lot of things like it. A lot of gasmes do it. But that didn't deter Last Resort's programmers who obviously saw R-Type, liked the look of it, then beetled off back to their work stations to create their own, and rather sexy version of it. Perhaps they called it Last Resort because after attempting to throw ideas together their last resort was a trip down to the amusements to feed other people's machines full of Yen. However, credit where credit's due, they've done a blinder of a job on this blaster. Last Resort is a horizontally scrolling shoot'em-up loaded with special weapons, bosses, nearendless attack waves and, believe it or not, some original ideas to keep you Neo Geoers happy. 122 "

Well play 16-Bit Virtua then try this, you won't believe your eyes... S1 Game on I'll admit to have been standing tall among the sceptics in the face of 32-X, but now I've actually sat down to rattle through the games, I'm a changed man. And of all the ones I've seen, this is, to my shallow mind at least, the best of the bunch. Virtua Racing, as many of you have probably discovered, is the best driving game to hit the arcades in recent years. Sure, Daytona and Ridge Racer are graphic cally amazing, but they can't compare to Virtua for sheer up playability. After spending plenty of evenings ramming each other off the track in the arcades we were more than a bit disappointed with Sega's ambitious Mega Drive conversion, which scored 79% in our May issue, but this, thank Sonic, is much better. 282x bit-mapped backdrops add immeasurably to Virtua's look.

Right cheap For a machine which costs about a 100th of the price of the Virtua Racing coin-op, you can't help but be amazed by the power the 32-X brings to this game.

The single-player is like an enhanced ver. sion of the coin-op, with superb tracks and two new cars which add to the gameplay. It's a totally different prospect to the Mega Drive version, and It's nice to see Sega abstain from reproducing the original, but with a few hundred extra polygons.

The force goes on Of all the films released, George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy has influenced more video games than any other. Now Sega is set to take Star Wars into the next generation with its conversion of the recently-released Virtua Star Wars coin-op. These screenshots really don't do the game any justice. The filled polygons move incredibly smoothly and those of you that thought the Megadrive version of Virtua Racing was smoothness personified, are going to be blown away. On approaching the Death Star it's hard not to be impressed as the polygon monstrosity fills the screen, but by far the most impressive section of the game is when you enter the heart of the Super Star Destroyer and the Death Star. The screen tilts and sways in smooth pixel-perfect detail and, unlike past polygon-based games, you have full control over the ship and there's none of the limiting play area seen in, limiting play area seen in, say, Silpheed. Luke's epic flight into the heart of the Death Star. Nothing original I'm sure you'll agree, however, whereas past Star Wars games involve avoiding masses of vectordrawn space craft, Sega's game makes the most of the 32X's fast processing speed by recreating the many ships and battles using filled polygons — loads of them! The Empire's evil reign is spreading across the galaxy, and only one person can stop them you. Prepare to make that difference... 10000 8000 165 Evil empire Starting with preliminary dogfights with swarms of TIE Fighters, later stages involve engaging a massive Star Destroyer before recreating Leaving the safety of the Rebel base and heading for the first TIE attack.

The result is a fast-paced, visually impressive tribute to a classic film which also manages to cram some fast blasting gameplay into the mix. Oh, and did I mention the brilliant John Williams score which sounds like it's being played directly off a CD? I could go on for hours... MARK PATTERSON A torpedo locks on to a rogue TIE. Under attack from a massive Star Destroyer. Frankly, Sega couldn't have chosen a better game to launch the 32X. The Virtua Star Wars coin-op was all presentation and no content, but by adding an enhanced 32X version, Sega has given users the best of both worlds. In terms of appearance, this conversion is jerkler than the coin-op, but the differences are minimal and will be forgotten in the heat of battle I defy you not to be impressed as you battle your way towards the reactor core in the Super Star Destroyer!

You don't get the stick this time round, although it's still loud and, frankly, rather impressive. Even though it isn't fully finished, the version of Afterburner we've been playing is coin-op perfect, right down to the speech, rolls and Outrun car of the original. Which begs the question has this been ported straight from the coin-op? We reckon it was, which isn't a bad thing. And if that's the case let's hope Sega does more coin-op perfect conversions.

Nostalgia or a convenient conversion? Space Harrier The true to the coin-op. There's the little bloke in the red bomber jacket still charging along, and over, a chess-board landscape blasting dragons, alien bugs and Easter Island stone heads with his portable hoover. It's not what you'd call breaking any new ground on the gaming front, in fact it's quite the reverse once you've seen shoot-'em-ups like Star Wars Arcade. However, Sega is hoping, in part, to cash in on the sheer nostalgia value of the title which, on the face of it, has attained genuine classic status. If you've got a hankering for a bit of Harriering you'll be able to try it out for yourself when the game's released in January on Mega Drive 32X. In the meantime watch out for the review in the near future. As the senior partner in Sega's retro trip. Space Harrier seems to have been around forever. That's not to take away the fact that the original game was really a very playable shoot-'em-up, and is an extremely novel title for the time. But its reputation has been somewhat tarnished over the years by some very rough home versions along the way. This is completely the opposite to those conversion calamities you'll be glad to hear being, like Afterburner, 32X handles the sprite scaling of the 3D graphics perfectly. It ought to as it's more powerful than the original coin-op. A Colliding with the levitating rocks and high-energy mulberry bushes is fatal.

Probably. OK, so maybe there aren't any hippies involved in the game, otherwise it would probably be entitled 'Cosmic can't we come to, like, a rational resolution through reasonable verbal discourse. Man'.

The graphics are the largest we've seen in a beat-'em-up with smooth animation and plenty of smart moves including fatalities. It also uses Neo Geo-style camera zooming to close in on the action when the characters close in to one another. Out of the next batch of 32X software releases, this looks like being the biggest.

Despite having to make a few small compromises in the form of a border around the screen and a few less levels, Sega has managed to produce a lightning-fast version of Doom for the Mega Drive 32X. It sticks closely to the PC original, with familiar level maps and all those secret rooms you need to discover if you want to get the best weapons early. The most positive sign has to be that none of the violence has been sacrificed. It's just as Doom bloody as it ever was. So you can run amok with a chainsaw until you run out of petrol. There's no namby pamby, censored version of Doom for the 32X. Blood, guns and chain saws ahoy! 141 "

"REVIEWS THE supershorts... I don't know there you are wait. ing for a game review for ages, and then what happens; eight come along at once... GRAPHIC I SOUND I TINY TOONS WACKY SPORTS OVERALL SNES KONAMI .99 Technical jerk-off with little real playability. Absolutely great. Konami has obviously put a lot of effort into making Wacky Sports look as impressive as possible. Another fine piece of workmanship here. Captures all the atmosphere of the cartoons, if you're into that sort of thing. PLAYABILITY Bit of a stumbling block here; it's very boring. So-called wacky'sports games are ten a penny these days, and are still crap. 63 SOUND OVERALL BRIAN LARA'S IGRAPHIC CRICKET Not all that bad, PC AUDIOGENIC although the anima.99 tion leaves something to be desired Tedious cricket game slightly at times, at least redeemed by two-player mode. everything's clear. You'll regret spending all that money on your sound card when you get a load of these sonics. PLAYABILITY Not bad at first, but some incredibly dull patches means you'll lose interest quickly, even if you're a big cricket fan. 42 I OVERALL INDIANA JONES' GREATEST ADVENTURES SNES JVC .99 GRAPHIC Excellent, loads of detail and great animation. However, it's nothing which hasn't been seen before in the genre. SOUND Very impressive when played through surround speakers, although once again it doesn't break any new ground. PLAYABILITY Obviously cast in the Castlevania vein this is an excellent platformer which packs a great challenge but few surprises. It might be another platform game, but it's not at all bad. 82 GRAPHIC SOUND MAN UTD PREM CHAMPS PC KRISALIS .99 Engaging and surprisingly original footie title. Let's be honest, we're all friends here, they're crap. Diddy little sad men and some patches of green. The thing with footie games is they rarely have anything worth writing about when it comes to sound. This is no exception. PLAYABILITY TOVERALL Heavy and very fluid tactical element, but it's a bit too hard to score for most tastes. Worth a look, though. MEGA TURRICAN GRAPHIC MD SONY UNCONFIRMED Tough and playable platform blaster. Great backgrounds and fantastic use of colour, but the main sprite looks stiff and out of place. SOUND The sound effects are superb and enhance the atmosphere no end. The music, however, is pretty weedy. PLAYABILITY TOVERALL Certainly unoriginal, and not up to Probotector standards, but this is still a highly playable title. OVERALL I SONIC IN TRIPLE TROUBLE GAME GEAR SEGA UNCONFIRMED GRAPHIC Standard Planet Mobius fare. Nice animation and some creative backgrounds and bosses. SOUND Alright, nothing special but nothing terrible not neither. Average would be the closest definition we could use. PLAYABILITY Quite good fun but too easy you'll complete it on your first or second go, which wrecks the value somewhat. Sonic over-easy is the best way to describe this. In a diner. 60 FRITZ CHESS GRAPHIC OVERALL PC PLAYTIME .99 It's a serious chess game. As such it eschews visual finery for a very clear and straight forward presentation. SOUND Ditto here. When was the last time you played a game of chess accompanied by an action movie soundtrack, eh? PLAYABILITY This is the game which thrashed both Short and Kasparov. If you have the tiniest or hugest interest in chess, this is a must. DDD What a computer chess game should be. SUPER ICE KEY SNES SUNSOFT .99 Ice hockey gets the console treatment again. GRAPHIC Well drawn and certainly well animated sprites, but a bit too much bluey-whiteness to be truly appealing. SOUND No real atmosphere. A bit like at a real-life ice hockey game, thinking about it. / should know, I've been, unfortunately. PLAYABILITY TOVERALL Good controls and decent enough game mechanics, but there's no real excitement in the air. 21 143 "
