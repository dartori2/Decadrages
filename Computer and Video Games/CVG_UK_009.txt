"ADDING TO THE ZX 81 ANNOYING Dear Sir, I am another lover of your front cover pictures, especially April's Medusa pinball machine. The main reason, however, for writing to you is to ask you about the compatibility of two add-ons for the ZX81. Supposing someone who wanted two add-ons in my case these are the DK'tronics graphics ROM and the Micro-Gen joysticks wanted to use them together. How do you know whether it will work? Could you please tell me if the above two add-ons will work in conjunction with one another, and how to find out whether any two will work together, as I am sure this is not an uncommon problem.

Being of independent natures, most of us like to read for ourselves using visual aids rather than rely on another person to read out loud. Most of the popular magazines provide reasonably clear print, but I'm afraid that Computer and Video Games has to come bottom of the list by your habit of providing pictorial backgrounds not only to articles but to program listings. Perhaps the worst example to date is in the Adventure series in the April issue where text is in black on a dark grey background. P. V. Bamfield, Brighton, East Sussex.

"MAILBAR DELIGHTFUL LISTINGS MORE TIPS ON CRESTA VIC FAN'S QUESTIONS Dear Sir, Having decided to purchase an Atari 800 some four months ago, I was absolutely delighted to discover Computer and Video Games and, in particular, to find the Atari program listings. The Trench program is an education in graphics, as is Golf, both of which were well worth the effort involved in punching the keys. Changing Hearts proved to be more of a detective story until I deduced that there must be an error in line 40, defining G$. The correct expression is G$=\"ABDE,ABC, BCEF, ADG, BDEFH,CFI, DEGH,GHI, EFHI,\" all with control pressed for the characters between the quotes. Experience of punching in programs from a number of magazines shows that the first place to look is for errors in punching the keys Atari line by line error messages help a lot here but if everything else fails, check any related material in the descriptive text. By the way, the plastic ruler really is a great help when entering programs but it is quite good for scratching your head when you are trying to find the bugs in the software. I'm keen to see you publish a guide to the differences between varieties of BASIC. I would love to convert some of your listings to run on my machine. Treasure Hunt looks very easy! Nigel H. Hughes Fleet Hampshire I would like to try are concerned because of the inclusion of these commands. Perhaps you could at the end of each issue give conversions for just those PEEKS and POKES appearing in that issue, or could devote one page each month to conversions so that the tables can be collected by the many people, who, like me, are learning about PEEKS and POKES. Perhaps you could even print a special issue of conversion tables at some time in the future, although it might be easier still if you publish only those programs that avoid PEEK and POKE altogether. If for some reason none of these suggestions are practical could you give suggestions as to what books I would have to buy to do my own conversions between the machines you cover. I have a BBC machine. P. Crossley Hornchurch Essex Editor's reply: Moira Norrie's Down to Basic series is currently detailing the intricacies of Basic on individual machines. PEEKS and POKES do present a more complicated problem but as they are responsible for many of the more interesting graphic and sound features on many machines, it is too limiting to dismiss programs that contain them. David Lien's The Basic Handbook by Compusoft publishing is the tome we usually recommend to help with conversion problems but our copy unfortunately doesn't contain any references to the BBC Microcomputer. some old computers? by that I don't mean ancient models, just the ones that have been on the market for some time. I have been trying Dear Sir, to find a review of the Sharp Regarding your Moon Cresta MZ-80K but without luck. tips section in the March 1982 T.

Although Commodore will not be releasing the games you mention in the near future, the company is producing a large range of software closely following the arcade trends. Versions of recent arcade successes like Gorf and Omega Race will be available soon. The main advantage of cartridges over cassettes is that no extra memory is needed to play quite sophisticated games. BINDERS ON THE WAY!

"ITIONCOMPETITIONCOM III 1982 PENTANGLE WALLOPI YES YOU CAN BEAT THE BUGS' PUZZLE DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA Confessions Could you Beat-the-Bug in the giveaway puzzle on the front of our June issue? A BBC Microcomputer goes to the writer of the best computerised solution we receive but the puzzle can also be solved by good old fashioned brain power. In all there are eight solutions if you count the first movement of two pieces of Data as one move. But all eight are just variations of each other with the Bug's first move dictating the rest of the solution. If you found the puzzle bevond you, we have notated a solution below which should help you to solve it. We have given each position a number (as indicated to the right) and the \"Z\" stands for Data Z; the \"A\" for Data A; and the \"B\" for the Bug's moves. Using these abbreviations, the solution is demonstrated by: showing which piece is moving, then giving the position it presently holds and the new position it is moving to. So A 2-5 means that the piece of Data A on position 2 moves to position 5 the central square. Z 7-4; Z 8-6; B 5-8; Z 9-7; B 8-9; A 2-5; B 9-8; Z 4-2; B 8-9; Z 7-4; B 9-7; A 5-8; B 7-9; A 3-5; B 9-7; A 1-3; B 7-9; Z 2-1; B 9-7; Z 4-2; B 7-4; A 8-9; B 4-7; A 5-8; B7-4; A 3-5; B 4-7; Z 6-3; B 7-4; A 5-7.

"604 594 Z o nages mesures Music Composer Scram 30 RENT KILOMETER Graph-it Intro to BASIC1 3.7 million reasons why the Atari Home Computer is something to see. The display screen used with our computers is composed of 192 horizontal lines, each containing 320 dots. Delivering colour and luminosity instructions to each dot for a second requires 3.7 million cycles...a lot of work for the normal 6502 processor That's why the Atari computer has equipped its 6502 with its own electronic assistant. It's called ANTIC, and it handles all the display work, leaving the 6502 free to handle the rest. What this means to you is uncompromisingly spectacular display capabilities without loss of computer power needed to carry out the demands of your program. That's a quality you just don't find in ordinary home computers. And it's one of the reasons some computer experts say that Atari computers are so far ahead of their time, There's more...which is what you'd expect from Atari Language. The Atari Home Computer uses several programming languages to give the user maximum control of its extraordinary capabilities. PILOT, Microsoft BASIC and Atari BASIC are understood and spoken by the Atari computer. You'll also find our Assembler Editor cartridge indispensable for machine language programming Sound. An Ataricomputer has foursound generators, or voices, activated by a separate microchip. This leaves the principal microprocessor chips free to perform other tasks. And you can take full advantage of this capability which is designed for easy programming. Change. Atari Home Computers have been designed to make change and expansion easy. The Atari computer has a modular operating system that can be easily replaced as new technology develops. If you need it, memory expansion requires no more than inserting additional RAM modules. And the Atari ROM cartridge system also makes it easy to change languages. In short, your Atari computer won't become obsolete by future developments...because it already incorporates the future.

In fact such statements have been made almost constantly over the last 30 years, but it is only fairly recently that strong players have begun to take them seriously. This month I present two games played by computers against world (Human) champions, both of which show the human emerging victorious. The first game was played by Bobby Fischer, an American who is or was — arguably the strongest player in the history of the game. Since winning the world championship against Boris Spassky at Reykyavik almost 10 years ago in a match which made headlines world wide, Fischer has virtually abandoned chess altogether. Even including \"friendly\" and casual games, Fischer's total collection of games since the match against Spassky could probably be counted on the fingers of one hand. Of this collection one was a joke game played for the Bob Hope television show in America where some of the moves were illegal! The only one of the games which seems to have been published was the following one, which was played in 1977. The opponent was a version of Machack, a program written by Richard Greenblatt at M.I.T. which competed with some success in tournaments in the late 1960s. Its playing strength has been estimated as around 2000 on the Elo scale (about 180 on the British Chess Federation scale). White: Bobby Fischer, Black: Greenblatt Chess Program 1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. P-KB4, PxP; 3. B-B4, P-Q4; The Kings Gambit is an opening long out of fashion at master level, but one which Fischer has occasionally played. 3. B-B4 A favourite line. 4. BxP, N-KB3; 5.

However, the computer plays on as computers usually do. 16. ... R-Q1; 17. QxB, N-R3; 18. R-B3, Q-N3; 19. R-QB1, K-N2; 20. R-KN3, R-R1; 21. Q-R6 mate. A very pleasing finish. Fischer's successor as world champion was Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union. Unlike Fischer, Karpov has played in innumerable tournaments since acquiring the title in 1975, with an outstanding record of success. After one of these tournaments in West Germany a couple of years ago, Karpov was persuaded to take on 25 versions of the so-called \"Chess Champion Super System III\" in a simultaneous display Karpov won this contest 25-0 but had one \"near miss\". The above position was reached after Black's 19th move with Karpov playing White. Karpov's position is overwhelming. a b c d e f g h Karpov is still a Rook behind and now tries a swindle. 32. N-N6 If now 32. ... PxN; 33. QxBch gives at least a draw by perpetual check. However, 32. ...Q-N1 pins the Black Queen avoiding mate. If then White plays 33. N-K7ch, K-R2; 34. B-K4ch then P-B4 wins, since the Queen is still pinned. However, the computer selects the worst possible move. 32.... KR-Q1??; 33. Q-R8 mate. A narrow escape for Karpov but the computers' play for the first 20 moves did not merit a win. By Max Bramer "

"PRESTEN Aladdin's Cave of Telesoftware Telesoftware is a topic you are going to hear a lot more about this year. It is an exciting new way of loading programs and data into micros, because it is all electronic. The secret is to use videotex — that is, teletext or Prestel as the storage medium All you have to do is tune in to teletext, or dial in to Prestel, using your micro, plus a special adaptor. You select what you want for instance a particular program and download it into your micro. Then you disconnect, and RUN the program. Telesoftware will give you access to a far bigger library of software and data, and avoid the hassle of drawerfuls of assorted cassettes or discs. How does it work? At the technical level, it is pretty complex. But the principles are straightforward. Let's look at it first from the teletext/ Prestel end. A reminder for those not familiar with those terms — teletext is broadcast via T.V. transmitters to your modified T.V. set e.g. Ceefax and Oracle. Prestel is British Telecom's viewdata service, which offers over 200,000 pages of information via the telephone line. Now, each teletext/Prestel page is stored as a string of alphanumeric characters, together with some additional control characters for colour, etc. The characters are, by and large, standard ASCII ones. Suppose a page held not, say, a weather forecast, but a games program written in BASIC. If you could somehow feed that string of characters into your micro, you would then be able to use that program. That, in a nutshell, is the idea behind telesoftware. The actual implementation of this idea is a bit more tricky. For a start, each Prestel character is made up of seven binary digits, plus a start and stop bit, and a parity check bit. Those extra bits have to be stripped off, and the remaining bits coverted into something your micro understands. This is normally done by software or firmware — ideally just a ROM By Peter Linton fitted into your micro. Then there's the question of feeding the Prestel characters in, which means an interface of some sort. The commonest one is what's called RS232C. This is a standard computer industry interface to allow various peripherals, such as printers, etc, to be hooked up to a micro. These days more and more micros have RS232C either built in, or as an optional extra. For instance the Sinclair Spectrum will have an optional RS232C interface available this autumn for around . If your micro does not have a standard interface, then one has to be designed. That's why Prestel ran a competition earlier this year to find an interface for the Sinclair ZX81. A few interesting prototypes emerged, and production models should be available in due course. So what do you actually need to make telesoftware happen on your micro? For teletext, you will need a special adaptor. For viewdata, if your micro already has RS232C (or equivalent) all you need is the software and a modem. The modem is there to convert the digital signals from your micro into the analogue signals needed on the telephone lines. The adaptor must also have a special connector for Prestel, or an acoustic coupler that fits on to your telephone. One acoustic coupler — the PAC-MI made by OEL has a modem built in, and makes possible a very simple, easy connection. Before we look at what you can do with telesoftware, let's allay your worries about cost. Adaptors are coming down to the  area, and heading for . The target is . As for running costs, programs on teletext are free, once you have a teletext T.V. and adaptor. On Prestel, you pay the normal phone charges for using the phone line, plus computer access time. At peak times, this is not cheap — but in the evening it's much more reasonable about 5p for an eight minute phone call, plus 4p for four minutes computer connect time. You may also be charged for looking at certain pages. The prices are set by the page owners, who can charge anything from 0.lp to 50p. Suppose you dial in and find a program you want to try. Let's assume it is OK, occupying say 12 pages with a charge of 2p a page. It would take something over two minutes to load. Let's assume you spend another five minutes looking at other Prestel pages. Total cost — in the evening and weekends 5p + 8p + 24p = 37p for a 12K program. Not bad, compared to the price of software generally So what's in it for you? Above all, a simple easy way of getting software. Already there are dozens of pages of telesoftware on teletext and Prestel, with more being added. It won't be long before computer magazines offer programs both in print and in telesoftware form. Once you have an interface, you will of course have access to the whole of Prestel, with its large databank of information and Mailbox service, as well as other viewdata systems. It also offers another intriguing possibility — you can download, and store, ordinary viewdata pages. Suppose you designed a Stock Market game with share prices. Then instead of inventing prices, you could dial in to the Stock Exchange's Prestel pages, and transfer real share prices into your game. That would add a nice touch of reality. Then the next day you could check if you really had made a killing, by comparing the results of your game with what actually happened. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 25 "

"S.O.L.L. Solitaire may be the loneliest game in town but it can be a lot of fun too! This computerised version of the famous board game follows the rules of the original closely. All you have to do is remove as many counters as you can from the play area by jumping them diagonally over each other. With any luck you should end up with just one lone counter in the centre hole of the board The author of this Sharp-sized version says that if you are left with 11-15 pieces you have played an average game, if you are 8-10 counters left on the board then you can rate yourself a good player. Anything below eight pieces well that's excellent! Mr Randle has been left with only five pieces after playing his game can you beat that?

"IMH BY TERRY CLARK ang In Egypt, during the reign of Zoser there lived a wise man named Imhotep. Zoser desired that a great monument be built so that the Gods would grant him eternal life. Imhotep was renowned throughout Khem, as they called their country, as a man of great intellect. The discovery of medicine and science as they know it, and the relatively new techniques of architecture were attributed to him. Therefore, Zoser chose Imhotep to erect his monument. Upon the desert of the east the first pyramid was raised, the famous step pyramid at Saqqara. Though a long way from the perfection and sheer size of the later Great Pyramid, the step pyramid of Zoser is a good first try. Imhotep must have been a remarkable man, possibly even worthy of the godhood granted him by later generations of Egyptians. He was revered until the very end of the culture. In this game I have tried to simulate the frustrations involved in the construction of a pyramid. The strain on the entire country must have been great indeed. From the hundreds of thousands of people involved, to the vast amounts of grain needed to feed them, all had to be co-ordinated. This task fell for the first time on the shoulders of Imhotep. He did not have the lessons of past failures to rely upon for guidance. He had to devise all the systems needed to perform this task. The fact that the pyramid was finished is, in itself, a testament to the intelligence of this man. So this man, Imhotep, fulfilled the wishes of his lord and master, Zoser the Pharoah. The step pyramid has brought the memory of Zoser into the present day and made his name immortal. But also the name of Imhotep lives on. To this day no one has located his tomb. Somewhere it may still exist, waiting, as did the tomb of Tutankhamen, for the light to re-enter its now-darkened confines and illuminate the many wonders surely entombed with the great master mason Imhotep.

"Illustration: Dorian Cross Spacecraft armed with awesome missiles are swarming around your vulnerable cities on a planet at war. Can you protect the population of the cities and prevent the apocalypse? In this game based on the popular arcade version you have to protect four cities from numerous marauding aliens. To do this, you have three missile bases, each initially equipped with 10 missiles. These, of course, must also be defended against the aliens, because, when a base is hit, all its missiles are destroyed. The aliens are represented as white dots, and leave a red radiation trail. When hit they are worth 10 points A bomb sight, in the form of a cross, can be controlled in four directions from the keyboard F=left, G=right, T=up, V=down. Once one of these is pressed, the sight will continue to move in the appropriate direction until another key is pressed. To fire, press the 1, 2, or 3 keys depending on which missile base you wish to use. Whey you fire, your missile will streak up to the centre of the sight, and a multiple explosion will occur, giving you more chance of destroying the aliens. However, to compensate for this, as they move down the aliens can divide into two or more. Once you have destroyed all the aliens, or lost all your missiles, the screen clears, and then displays any bonus points 10 for each remaining missile, and 50 for each city. If you have no cities left, the game ends after a suitable display, else you proceed to the next, faster, attack wave. The game requires a minimum 32K machine, with Basic V5.0 H, and the colour high resolution board. BY A. M. PENNELL 10 REM RML 3BOZ MISSILE COMMAND 20 REM 30 REM BY A.

And we think we've found one in Casino Royale, written by Nigel Hughes. We'll let him describe his program \"Ever since discovering Dealer X5 in David Ahl's book of More Basic Computer Games, I had been interested in writing a similar game program, but with colour graphics and sound. The appearance of Changing Hearts in Computer and Video Games gave me the clue to printing patterns of Hearts on the screen and I soon had a subroutine written to print the various patterns of Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades to be found on playing cards. The tricky stuff for putting patterns of pips in the right places is to be found in lines 30 to 60 and 100 to 170 of the listing. The patterns on playing cards can be arranged in a 3 column by 6 row array of boxes. The last row is only used for the pattern of the ten The boxes are labelled 1 to 18. The box numbers, in equivalent ASC character form, in which the pips are to go for cards 1 to 10 inclusive are stored in string LS LS contains 10 substrings, each of 11 characters, the last always being the equivalent of zero. Only the last substring is full, the rest being padded out with zeros. You cannot fill a string directly in Atari Basic if the string is longer than a logical line about 90 characters. Thus the final string LS, which contains 110 characters, is put together by concatenating chaining together — two substrings LS and MS. The strings LS and MS on lines 40 and 50 must be typed using CONTROL Graphics characters obtained with the following keys: L$ = \" H B N. BHN. .. ACMO ACHMO., MS = \"ACGIMO.....ACEGIMO... ACEGIKMO...

"RUNS ON A 32K PET The scene of our game is a top dog show. Posh people's preened puppies, pampered pooches; pugs, Pekinese, Pomeranians (poodles perhaps) proudly promenade, parading perfectly primed postures, providing properly processed pedigrees and lots more things beginning with \"P\". The name of the little dog in this game is Ffortescue Ffookes the Ffourth, known to his friends as Ffortescue Ffookes the Fourth, or to his enemies as Chunky. But I digress, the real star of our saga is a flea. Malcolm J Spogglebotty is a lord among fleas. To say that his blood is merely blue would be a lie. He comes from a long line of fleas all of whom were well up to scratch. His ancestors include: Trevor Spogglebotty, who got inside Lord Nelson's jacket causing him to reach inside to scratch. Gino Spogglebotty, who tickled the Mona Lisa as she was posing. Noah Spogglebotty who bit the bird that dropped the apple that fell on the head of Isaac Newton who cried 'Eureka' and fell into the swimming pool on top of Archimedes, who was having trouble with his principal at school, thus discovering water. Or more recently, Frank Spogglebotty who bit Adam Ant on the recording session causing him to utter the famous sound that we all know and love. But enough of this biting satire, this game is about oh, read the instructions yourself they are in the listing. On a serious note people with old PETs should change the occurrence of Peek 151 to Peek 515, which will enable you to run the program.

"Landing on the rough surface of any planet is difficult enough, but when you've got asteroids whizzing around your craft threatening to do it terminal damage it makes the operation a life and death affair! Moon Shuttle is a cross between a lunar lander and asteroids game. You have to guide your craft through a maze of deadly asteroids and land safely. The program is designed for use with a joystick -but it can be played using the Vic's keyboard by making the changes shown below. When the program is run the computer asks you for a number between 1-15 this decides the difficulty of the game, by deciding the number of asteroids. By moving the joystick or pressing any key you start the game. The spacecraft takes off from the lunar surface and then drifts across the screen. You have to land on one of the blue landing pads but watch out for those asteroids! You also have to keep an eye on your fuel consumption don't run out before you land! The difficulty level increases after each successful landing. IMPORTANT: The program comes in two parts otherwise it would not fit in 3.5K. The first part is \"Initialisation\" and sets up a character table in 512 bytes of RAM including several custom characters. It must be run each time you wish to play the game. But please note that each time it BY P. A. ROBERTS is run 512 bytes are sealed off and if it is run more than once during your session with the Vic an out of memory error will result. Alterations for use without joystick. On line 410 change the value of J to 197. On line 395 change the 37137 to 197 and the 126 to 64. On line 600 change the 90 to 51. On line 610 change the 94 to 20. On line 620 change 78 to 43. On line 630 change 86 to 28. On line 1040 change 90 to 51. On line 2050 change 94 to 20. On line 3030 change 78 to 43.

"SPANNER IN THE WORKS \"NEVER HEARD OF A\";R3$ : GOTO 100 : REM R3$ IS 2ND WORD OF PLAYER RESPONSE 330 LET K2 = (1 1)/3 + 5 340 REM K2 IS 1/3rd OF I PLUS 4 400 REM THIS LINE GOES TO ROUTINE FOR APPROPRIATE VERB The subroutine at 2000 is the string search given a few months ago, returning O if word is not found. K2 holds the coded number of the noun. Note that if R5$ isn't found in the object array, the scan moves to the W2$ string, and if found k2 = 4 plus the word number found in W2$. To display the objects visible at the current location it will now be necessary to use only the characters to the right of the three identifiers, which can be isolated by the expression: RIGHT$(0$(n), LENO$(N)-3) Key Figure 1 Object description Contents of O$(n) BLOODSTAIN AXE AXE AXEBLOODSTAINED AXE COW COW COWCOW 2 JUMPING BEAN BEA BEAJUMPING BEAN METAL BUCKET BUC BUCMETAL BUCKET GOLDEN FISH FIS FIS GOLDEN FISH SILVER NEEDLE NEE NEE*SILVER NEEDLE Note that even when the key is the same as the first three letters of the whole description, these must be repeated. HELP GET ME OUT OF HERE! When I suggested that both computer and player would recognise treasures more easily if they were identified by a special symbol placed on each side of the word, I threw a spanner in the works as far as object recognition was concerned. You will remember that the object array O$1 (n) is scanned to compare the three left most characters of each element with the corresponding characters of the second word of the player's response (R5$). How many players are like to type \"TAKE *DIAMOND*\" complete with asterisks? A possibility not mentioned so far is enhancing nouns with adjectives, a desirable feature adding colour and mood to the game, \"BLOODSTAINED AXE\" sounds far more sinister than \"AXE\", assuming that is the impression we wish to convey! Yet a player will automatically type \"TAKE AXE\" rather than \"TAKE BLOOODSTAINED AXE\". The problem is that the first three letters of the object are no longer the three letters by which we want to recognise it. Notice the similarity to the problem of the treasure asterisks. String W2$ holds the first three letters of all valid nouns. It would make sense not to duplicate these in the object array, so include only non-object nouns in W2$, such as those used in location descriptions. Assign the rest to an element in O$(n), this array holding the complete descriptions and symbols, and to the left of each description the three letters by which each object is to be identified. See Figure 1. Next concatenate the first three letters of each of the other nouns into string W2$, and to decode the noun: 300 FOR I = 0 TO 4: IF R5$ LEFT $(O$(I),3) THEN NEXT ELSE K2 =I: GOTO 400 310 LET C$ = W2$ : LET CC$ = R5$: GOSUB 2000 320 IF I = 0 THAN LET Q1$ = Please don't let anyone else see this page. I'll be in dead trouble if they find out I've written it. They've had me incarcerated here since the day they carried me away screaming from the Death Maze. Excuse me, I have to keep looking over my shoulder while I write at any time a guard might come along and put me back into a straight jacket. While my hands have been free I've written \"HELP GET ME OUT with doors on both sides and a guard on every corner. I hate it when they catch me, and they always do. They keep taking away my grenade pin and I WANT IT! I WANT IT! Hee hee hee! Sometimes I fool them by letting the piano fall on my head just before they can pounce!! It doesn't half make them cross!

"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING Line 10 defines the graphics characters used. BL is the blank or space character and 32 is the standard ASCII code for space, used on most home computers. PL, SH, and GN are used for the plane, shell and gun; the Compukit provides suitable graphics for these, for other machines you will have to check the character set. Line 15 is specific to the Compukit and Ohio Scientific machines, and sets up for reading the keyboard. This line should be omitted on other machines, Lines 20 and 25 initialise the remaining variables; PP is plane position, initialised at start of screen; PC is the number of planes, initially zero; V is score value; S is the player's score. F and G are the flags \"shell fired\" and \"gun enabled\", set initially to indicate that no shell has been fired and that the gun may be fired. Line 50 clears the screen; although most computers have a \"clear screen\" command there was no such command on early models of the Compukit. Line 60 pokes the gun on to the screen and sets up to write the shell immediately above the gun. We now come to the body of the program, which is written from the program description. Lines 100 and 110 correspond to the first two lines in the program description: write blank to current plane position move plane position one place right The next block in the program description is: DECIDING ON VARIABLES Blowing a plane out of the skies is hardly the most constructive thing to program but it forms a basic computer fundamental to many of the dexterity and action games which feature on microcomputers. Last month we ended with a detailed outline for a simple game program, and we will now look at the process of converting the outline into Basic code. I will be developing the program to run on the Compukit UK101, but I will explain the machine-dependent details to allow you to write a similar program for any machine. The first step is to decide on the main variables and constants to be used and to determine the initial values to be set up. If we start with the first line of the program description, \"write blank to current plane position\" we see that we need a constant to represent a blank or space character on the screen and a variable to represent \"current plane position\", and we must assign an initial value to \"current plane position\", the initial value being the top left-hand corner of the screen. We can work through the whole program description in this way, assigning variable names and initial values, and then write the initialisation section of the program. If you look at the program listing you will see that the first few lines are devoted mainly to setting up initial values. In line 5, SC=53248 gives the start of the screen, L=64 gives the number of characters across the screen, E=SC + 8L gives the final position for the plane (the end of the nineth line down) and GP=SC + 15*L +34 gives the position of the gun (the centre of the bottom line on the screen). These values will have to be changed on other machines, for example, on the PET the screen starts at address 32768, there are 40 characters across and 25 lines down the screen, so line 5 would become: 5 SC = 32768: L=40: E=SC + 12*L: GP = SC + 24*L + 20 BY TED BALL NOW STUDY THIS LISTING 5 SC=53248 : L=64: E=SC+8*L: GP=SC +15*L +34 10 BL=32 : PL=237 : SH=240 : GN=215 15 POKE 530, 1: KB=57088 20 PPSC: PC=0 25 V=100: S=0:F=0: G=1 50 FOR I = 1 TO 16 : PRINT : NEXT I 60 POKE GP, GN: IS=GP-L 100 POKE PP, BL 110 PP = PP+1 120 N=N+1 130 IF NEL THEN N=0:V=V-10: G=1 140 IF PP-E THEN PC=PC +1: PP = SC: V=100: G=1 150 POKE PP, PL 160 IF PP=SP THEN GOSUB 500 170 IF F= 0 THEN GOTO 220 180 POKE SP, BL 190 SP=SP-L 200 IF SP<SC THEN F=0: GOTO 220 210 POKE SP, SH 220 IF PPSP THEN GOSUB 500 230 IF G= 0 THEN GOTO 260 240 POKE KB, 247 250 IF PEEK(KB) 223 THEN SPIS: POKESP, SH :F=1: G =0 260 IF PC <=9 THEN GOTO 100 270 FOR I=1 to 16 : PRINT : NEXT I 280 PRINT \"YOUR SCORE IS\"; SC 290 PRINT \"ANOTHER GAME\"; : INPUT A$ 300 IF A$=\"Y\" THEN RUN 310 END 500 F=0 510 FOR I = 1 TO 50 : POKE PP, 42 : POKE PP, BL : NEXT 1 520 S=S+V 530 PC = PC +1 540 PP = SC 550 N=0 560 V=100 570 G=1 580 RETURN 62 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES "


"PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING IF end of line THEN set plane position to start of next line decrease score value set \"gun enabled\" flag. TESTING TIME So far we have not made any provision for testing when the plane reaches the end of the line. It could be calculated by testing for PP being a multiple of 64 but doing it that way we would have to allow for SC=53248 being a multiple of 64. It is easier to set up a counter N to record the position of the plane on the line and test for N being equal to the line length. This gives us lines 130 and 140. Note that, because the Compukit allows multiple statements per line we can get the whole of an IF ... THEN ... block on one line. In ZX81 Basic we are allowed only one statement after THEN, but we can keep the structure of the program by writing 130 IF NEL THEN GOSUB 600 600 LET N=0 610 LET V=V-10 620 LET G=1 630 RETURN Many mainframe Basics allow IF ... THEN statements only in the form IF condition THEN line number. In this case we would write 130 IF N<L THEN 140 132 N=0 134 V=V-10 136 G=1 Continuing to work through the program description, line 140 represents the next block: IF end of run THEN add 1 to plane count set plane position to start of screen set score value to initial value set \"gun enabled\" flag and lines 150 and 160 represent the next two blocks: write plane to new position IF hit THEN subroutine (plane destroyed). The next block is more complicated: IF shell fired THEN write blank to current shell position move shell position up one line IF off screen THEN clear \"shell fired\" flag ELSE write shell to new position We could start by writing: 170 IF F= 1 THEN GOSUB 700 and expanding the right-hand block inside a subroutine, but I have chosen to start with IF gun not fired THEN GOTO next block. The next two lines, 180 and 190, are straightforward We now come to the implementation of an IF ... THEN ... ELSE... statement. This is available on a few computers, for example the TRS 80 and the B.B.C. Microcomputer, but on most machines it must be broken down into IF ... THEN ... and GOTO statements. By using the feature of multiple statements on a line I have kept some of the structure of the program description. However, if only one statement is allowed on a line we must write something like 200 IF SP<SC THEN GOTO 215 210 POKE SP, SH 212 GOTO 220 215 F= 0 Line 220 is identical to line 160 and corresponds to an identical line in the program description. The final block in the main body of the program is: IF gun enabled THEN check keyboard IF key pressed THEN set initial shell position write shell to screen set \"shell fired\" flag clear \"gun enabled\" flag The method of reading the keyboard on the Compukit and Ohio Scientific machines is rather complicated and I will not go into the details. On most machines we can replace line 240 and the first part of line 250 by 240 GET A$ 250 IF A$=\"F\" THEN ... The remainder of the program is the subroutine in lines 500 to 580, which corresponds to the following in the program description: subroutine (plane destroyed) clear \"shell fired\" flag simulate explosion on screen add score value to player's score add 1 to plane count set plane position to start of screen set score value to initial value set \"gun enabled\" flag The only part of this which requires comment is \"simulate explosion on screen\", which is implemented in line 510. The ASCII code 42 is an asterisk \"*\", and line 510 flashes the asterisk on and off. The method of creating moving graphics used above applies to most computers that have a memory-mapped screen. Usually, the last position on one line and the first position on the next line are consecutive memory locations and no special provision is needed to move the plane from the end of one line to the beginning of the next; PP = PP + 1 in line 100 will do this automatically However, the ZX81 does not have a memory-mapped screen. There are two ways of creating moving graphics on the ZX81, either by using PRINT AT or by POKEing to the Display File, but in both cases trying to write beyond the end of a line will cause the program to crash. I have kept the program fairly simple in order to concentrate on the method of top-down structuring for program design and to avoid getting bogged down in details of the code. However, top-down structuring is extremely important in the design of large, complicated programs that may end up with hundreds or even thousands of lines of code. By splitting the work involved in writing a program into two parts, first producing a logically structured description of the tasks the program must perform and then writing the code to perform these tasks, the programmer can concentrate on the details of the code in one part of the program without having to worry about how it affects any other part of the program. 250 IF INKEY$ = \"F\" THEN. This fires the gun when the F key is pressed and ignores all other keys. The overall structure of the program description is REPEAT body of program UNTIL plane count more than number of planes Line 260 tests for end of game, and lines 280 to 310 clear the screen, print the score, and carry out the usual \"another game?\" routine.

"SIMPLE SMOOTH CURVES. The impact of a graphic display often comes from a simple, smooth curve which links together all the elements in a picture. To obtain a particular effect it may be useful to make small variations to the basic shape of a particular curve. These ideas can be illustrated by examining some slightly unusual curves and then seeing how small variations can be added to them. The location of a point, P, can be described not only by giving its row and column positions, but also by giving its distance, r, from a fixed reference point and the angle, 8, that the line from the fixed point to P makes with a reference direction. This is illustrated in figure 1. The new co-ordinates are called polar co-ordinates and are written as (1,8). It is usual to measure the angle, 8, in radians. Polar co-ordinates are the natural way to describe a position in some circumstances, for example, the position of a ship or an aircraft is usually fixed by giving its distance away and its direction. Now curves can be expressed in polar co-ordinates, and some rather unusual curves are given by quite simple polar equations. As an example, the equation r = @ describes a spiral. One revolution of this spiral is shown in black in figure 2: it is obtained by letting the angel, e, take on values corresponding to one turn of a circle. The shape is scaled simply by introducing a scaling factor. Figure 2 also shows one revolution of r = 20 (in red) r = 40 (in blue) The program that produces these and subsequent plots is essentially as follows. Note that it is written in no particular dialect of Basic. 10 P1 = 3.14159 20 FOR TH = 0 TO 2*P1 STEP P1/50 30 R = TH 40 X = R'COS(TH) : Y = RESIN(TH) 50 IF TH = 0 THEN MOVE X,Y ELSE DRAW X,Y 60 NEXT TH The equation of spiral is incorporated in line 30: by changing this line other curves can be generated. Figure 3 shows two revolutions of the same spirals as before. If you rotate the page while looking at these spirals you will experience a strange optical illusion. To show another unusual curve, the limacon r = 1 + cos is plotted in black in figure 4. Variations on this curve are also shown by giving: r = 1 + } cos (in red) r = +1 cos (in blue) This variation seems to remove the unusual characteristic of the curve. However, the next variation shows how to keep it and even to make it occur repeatedly. Figure 5 shows: r = 1 + cos (in black) r=1 + cos 20 (in red) r = 1 + cos 40 (in blue) With this experience of making shapes and loops, we can return to the spiral and give it a ripple of a shape and frequency that we can control. The rippling spirals of figure 6 were obtained by plotting two revolutions of: r = a1 + 1 cos 26) (in black) r = a1 + cos 40) (in red) r = (1 + & sin 80) (in blue) If you would like to experiment to change the shape of some other curves, then the equation of a circle is r = 2 and of an ellipse is r = 3/(2 + cos).

"CATCHING THE DATA BUS Ask most people who own a Sinclair ZX81 or even a ZX80 whether they can directly interface their machine for both input or output and their most likely reply will be no. They are, of course, partly correct as neither of these machines, and some of the others, do not have interface adaptor chips in them. These chips would allow the programmer to input and output binary information to and from the data bus. It is possible, however, to input single bit information to these machines with the minimum of hardware, and really it should not be beyond anyone who owns a soldering iron. The trick, if it is one, is to use the strobed keyboard along with the INKEY$ function in software. This may not only be done with the Sinclair machines but with any which has a strobed keyboard. If you have ever used the INKEY$ function you will know how this works. If not, just refer to the manual where it explains it in simple terms. The principle works in exactly the same way as the keyboard in that the machine looks at each individual switch in the matrix one at a time. By using the INKEY$ function you can test for any number of the keys in the following way: 10 IF INKEY$=\"*\" THEN GOTO 100 where is any of the lower case keys. As you would suppose you can use as many or as few of the keys as you wish. If you do not input the key that the machine expects it will just move on to the next line of program and to maintain the input mode a \"GOTO 10\" statement will have to be inserted after the test routine. One of the most often add-on which uses this method of input is the joy-stick. This is just a switch with a number of positions, usually between 4 and 8. The joy-stick is of course of use in games as a controller and, if a top switch is fitted, as a laser gun trigger. This arrangement can also be used to plot on the screen in a similar way. Although the strobe method lends itself to this sort of input it can be used for more ingenious purposes. The best I have seen so far is a burglar system. The inputs were from the microswitches about the house and the tape output was used to trigger a recorded telephone message. Clever. Now, although you may not have opened up the case of your machine before, if you bought it already built, you only need a little common sense and care not to damage it. You only need to know that 3 screws are hidden under the rubber feet. After the case has been opened two screws are removed to free the board. If you built the kit you will already know what goes where but if you did not a circuit diagram would be of use. The keyboard is the same for both the ZX80 and ZX81 so that the diagram I have drawn below will do for each. As you can see from the drawing the keyboard is in the form of a double matrix. Unless you are going to use the keyboard as well as the add-on it does not really matter which keys you wire up, as you can always allow for this in the program. You will see from the picture that for, say, the letter \"D\" you would wire in on KBD2 and D4, and for, say, the number \"T\" KBD3 and D3 would be wired up. You can wire in any of the keys, bearing in mind that you may want to use some keys on the board for auxiliary controls. Remember also that wiring on to the keys does not disable them. To make the system foolproof, you should solder the wires, preferably multi-stranded, on the keyboard side of the diodes and resitors, D1-D8 and RP 3, the resistor pack, respectively. If you intend to fit a number of different add-ons it would be advisable to terminate the wires in some kind of multi-connector so that you need only plug in the alternatives. Try to standardise on the first one that you obtain or else the one with the most connections so that you do not get caught out with an unusable key. Whatever you use the inputs for you will find that the machine will no longer be just a simple computing aid but a fun toy and a useful tool as well. It just goes to show how important input/output is when Sinclair's new machine incorporates a powerful command structure for this very purpose.

"GAMES SAy \"Get 'em before they get me\", was the quickfire reply of a Space Invaders devotee when questioned about his optimum strategy. Another common answer is: *Shoot first and ask questions afterwards.\" Both are the sign of the loser or those who won't survive for long. Winning in any game is largely BY ARNOLD ARNOLD Space Invaders provides what seems like a perpetually randomised attack within a constantly moving, yet enclosed, scenario. Delivery speed of the missiles and their sum and the variety of directions (usually one — downwards from which they come, plusthe sum of attacking space creatures, provides the challenge to the player's survival. So strategies are available to a player. The first is predominantly defensive. The second is predominantly retaliatory. Only the evasive manoeuvre counts where survival is concerned. The retaliatory counter attack is secondary. The limit to the number of retaliatory missiles despatched at any time is a good reason for an essentially defensive posture as the preferred primary strategy. Games like Space Invaders are addictive only to those people who believe that attack is the only way to win. But that's how you lose in games as in real life. The defensive, primary tactic is always the best as every Karate expert knows. The \"attack first stance is addictive and usually fatal for those who believe in it despite all the evidence to the contrary. Those who subscribe to the 'get them before they get me\" principle generally lose at the earliest moment — some sooner than others. Those who subscribe to the defensive principle last longest. Evading the missiles perfectly or relatively perfectly with return fire only when it is safe and effective allows the defensive player to last as long as the programme permits. The game losing its addictive quality as soon as you have 'conquered' it to the point of playing almost indefinitely. Then it is just a question of how fast you can dodge and reduce the number of attackers from any temporary safe position. You can't win forever, no matter what. At best you can keep going until you tire, run out of time or until the machine breaks down. These are valuable lessons for games and for life, providing they are properly understood. If you were to keep winning, the only defensive ploy available to the designers of Space Invader programs would be to speed up the program 76 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES matter of survival and foresight. The winners are those who understand what is involved and those who last longest. \"Winning\" in any game is really a matter of outlook. This and two following articles analyse popular computer, video and other games. Here I am going to describe the best winning strategies for Space Invaders as well as why they should be adopted. In Space Invaders, as in card games, the facts (i.e. the Space Invaders' missiles) are randomised like a deck of cards. Players are meant to be kept perpetually guessing how best to survive and win. In Space Invaders, the random or seemingly random program and apparently random missile delivery are designed to confuse the players. Confusion caused by the shuttling of the deck of cards can only be answered successfully by greater confusion created by all players for one another in other words by bluffing and psychological ploys. But try confusing a computer. This article examines how best to apply co-ordination. The two following articles will question the part played by luck in gaming and offers a general solution to the chess problem. and increase the number and randomisation of the missiles up to the limits of the machine's capacity. Human reactive speeds and co-ordination are far more limited than those of the machine. It has nothing else on its mind. It can't be confused by any player. It also never needs to go to the toilet. A most interesting Space Invader program would be one for which the player could select and control the speed, randomisation and intensity of the attack, increasing and accelerating missile delivery and randomisation as soon as the challenge of any previous program is met successfully. Or designers could build a progressive series of more difficult games into the program, that you could only play when you have succeeded in less challenging ones. That would enhance the players' co-ordinative skills up to the limits of what is humanly possible. Those limits are known. Computer generated data, displayed on a screen, assumes the characteristics of a continuous beam of light at .027 seconds per unit of display (i.e. per digital dot) as far as human eye-sight is concerned. At that point co-ordination dexterity, evasion and retaliation are of no further use. The little green men will get you every time from the start. It all comes down to pitting your understanding even more than your skill — against that of the designer and against a machine's capacity, more than allowing yourself to be tempted to blast the opposition first. The latter course makes for dead heroes. Defence, rather than attack, is the best and most important survival strategy. Never mind a few losses now and then. That doesn't give the defender any advantage in so far as winning is concerned. But he has an equal opportunity to force a draw. That is a game that goes on forever in so far as Space Invaders are concerned. "

"DOWN TO BASIC NS New Town Rovers w WN Superteam Local United HOW TO WIN THE LEAGUE Having dealt with one-dimensional arrays (lists) last month, I will describe the use of two-dimensional arrays (tables) this month. The ideas involved are very similar in the case of two-dimensional arrays tables of related values are processed, e.g. a football league table. A table will consist of a number of rows and a number of columns. As with lists, the size of a table should be declared in a DIMension statement. The size of a table is specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. 20 DIM T(4,3) The above DIMension statement would set up a table called T with 4 rows and 3 columns. You can visualise this as (Fig 2) ple of setting up the following foot. ball league table. PW D L F A Pts New Town 3 2 1 0 11 3 5 Rovers 2 1 1 0 4 2 3 Superteam 2 1 0 1 4 3 2 Local United 3 0 0 3 1 12 0 For each team in the league, there are eight pieces of information to be stored -the team name and the seven associated values. It is not possible to mix character strings and numeric values in one array. I will therefore have a list of character strings for the team names, and a table of associated values. 10 DIM N$(4), T(4,7) is used to declare a list N$ of four character strings and a table T with four rows and seven columns (Fig Having input the information in the correct order, the arrays N$ and Twould have the form as in Fig 2. I have only dealt with what would be part of a program to set up the football league table. The remainder of the program might analyse the contents in some way — or it may simply print the table, with appropriate headings, in a format suitable for publication. 2). A single DIMension statement can be used to declare a number of arrays one and two dimensional e.g. 25 DIM L(15),T(10,5) would set up a list L of size 15 and a table T with 10 rows and 5 columns. To refer to a particular value in a table, you must specify its position in the table this is done by giving its row and column position. For example, 40 PRINT T(2,3) would print the value in the 2nd row and 3rd column of the table T. To show you how to set up a table in your program, I will use the examBY MOIRA NORRIE 78 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES Each position in list N$ corresponds to a row of table T and each row in T has seven columns. The next problem is how to get the information in the football league table input to N$ and T. Let's input the information row by row.\" repeat for each row input team name repeat for each column' of T) input value end repeat column end repeat row Using variable R to represent the row number and variable C to represent the column number, this can be expanded into the BASIC statements: 30 FOR R=1 TO 4 40 INPUT N$(R) 50 FOR C=1 TO 7 60 INPUT T(RC) 70 NEXT C 80 NEXT R THE POLITICAL SURVEY As another example of the use of tables, consider the following example. A political survey is to be carried out in the three cities London, Belfast and Edinburgh. Each person interviewed is asked which political party they would vote for in the next election. Their answer is noted as one of: Conservative, Labour, Liberal-SDP, Other or Don't Know. A BASIC program is required to input the results of the survey and print a table showing the number of people in each of the cities supporting a particular political party. A code number is assigned for each city and for each Party as follows: Conservative Labour Liberal-SDP Other Don't Know London Belfast Edinburgh For each person interviewed, a pair of values will be input code IIIIIII WNOWN "


"DOWN TO BASIC no. of Party, code no. of city. The data will be terminated by the pair of values -1, -1. A table will be set up with a row for each Party and a column for each city. As the data is input, each position in the table will contain the current total for the corresponding Party and city. For each pair of data values, \"1\" will be added to the appropriate position in the table. Thus, if the pair of values 2,1 is input, then \"1\" will be added to the value in row 2, column 1 adding 1 to the current total of people interviewed who support Labour and live in London. The table will continue to be updated in this way until all the data has been input. 10 REM POLITICAL SURVEY 20 DIM P$(5), T(5,3) 30 REM SET UP LIST OF PARTIES 40 FOR I=1 TO 5 50 INPUT P$(1) 60 NEXT 1 70 REM INPUT SURVEY DATA 80 REM CODE NO.

For one thing, messages should be printed to inform the user as to the necessary format of the data to be supplied a list of Party names, followed by the pairs of data values. The major problem would be the appearance of the table of results that would be printed — just how poor that would be will depend on the system used! What is needed is a method for specifying exactly where values should be printed on a line of output. 140 REM PRINT RESULTS 150 REM PRINT TABLE HEADINGS 160 PRINT, \"LONDON\",\"BELFAST\", \"EDINBURGH\" 170 REM PRINT TABLE TOTALS ROW BY ROW 180 FOR N=1 TO 5 190 REM PRINT PARTY 200 PRINT P$(N).

Line 230 PRINT A(I). The peculiarities of Atari Basic feature in this month's language breakdown. VARIABLES: The name of a string variable must be a single letter followed by $. The number of characters in a string variable must be declared in a DIM statement e.g. DIM NS(5) declares a string of up to five characters. Substrings can be specified e.g. NS(2,4) refers to the substring of NS consisting of the second to the fourth character. ARRAYS: Can only have numeric arrays Arrays can be of variable size 20 INPUT N 25 DIM X(N) The name of an array must be a single letter STATEMENTS: END statement is optional ATARI BASIC Can have more than one statement per line using a \":\" as a separator. The general form of the IF statement is <line no > IF < condition > THEN < statement(s)> The ON statement can be used to transfer to one of a list of lines nos. depending upon the value of a given expression <line no > ON < expression> GOTO < list of line nos.> FUNCTIONS: ASC returns the ASCII code of the first character in the specified string CHR$ converts code number to character. FRE(0) returns the amount of free memory space. FRE returns the number of unused bytes in the space reserved for a specified string variable e.g. FRE(NS). STRS converts a numeric expression to a character string. TAN tangent VAL converts a string to a numeric value plus ABS, ATN, COS, EXP, INT, LEN, LOG, RND, SGN, SIN, SQR. GRAPHICS: Colour graphics facility commands COLOR, SETCOLOR GRAPHICS command to determine the number of rows and columns forming the \"graphics grid« on the screen e.g. GRAPHICS 7 will give 158 columns and 80 rows. Gr. 7 is an abbreviated form of the above command. PLOT C, R plots a point in position column C, row R. DRAWTO C, R draws a line from the last point plotted to position column C, row R. SOUND: There is a sound system which can generate varying \"noises\" by use of SOUND. COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 79 "

"HARDCORE A GAMES PLAYER'S GUIDE TO THE NASCOM graphics characters. Coming only in a cased version the Nascom 3 has a starting price of  excluding VAT All Nascom computers are available from the firm's nationwide dealer network A list of dealers is obtainable from Lucas Logic, Nascom Microcomputers Division Welton Road, Wedgnock Industrial Estate, Warwick CV34 5PZ. FUN AND GAMES The Nascom family of microcomputers came into being five years ago and has since become one of the most popular hobbyist computers. Despite the chequered past of its original manufacturers the Nascom name has survived and a third generation of the computer was brought out last year. Now the range consists of the Nascom 1, 2 and 3, each design being more sophisticated than the preceding one. The Nascom 1 is based around the 280 chip and is the oldest machine of the range. With over 20,000 sold since its 1977 launch the majority of them are used for process control in industry, and in education as well as having a large following amongst the kit building fraternity. Its main assets are reliability and simplicity of design making it easy to use. The standard machine has a memorymapped screen and can handle 48 x 16 characters. All the conventional interfaces are available including input and output ports, a socket to link up a printer, and a cassette recorder interface. The keyboard contains 47 characters and is surrounded by a steel frame. You can upgrade the Nascom 1 using the NAS-SYS 1 operating system which comes with the computer when you buy it. This package enables you to use software which was originally written for the more sophisticated Nascom 2. Memory capacity is limited at the basic level to 1K of static user memory On the graphics front you can add a small board which provides you with block graphics similar to those available on the Nascom 2. For upgrading further Nascom produces the Buffer Board which makes the Nascom 1 fully compatible with the Nasbus. This allows you to add the extra system boards including a variety of memory boards and input/output boards, thereby upgrading your system. Price is an all-important factor in choosing a computer and the Nascom 1 kit costs . Nascom also produces a board level version which consists of built and tested boards without cases or power supplies. This is available for the Nascom 2 for . The younger brother of the family is the Nascom 2 which was based on the design of the original machine. Its superiority to the Nascom 1 lies in its extra on-board memory capacity and other additional facilities lacking in the Nascom 1. It is based on the Z80A/MK3880-4 8 bit microprocessor and runs at a faster speed than the Nascom 1. The board size is also the same as its predecessor being 8in x 12in. Built in memory capacity is 20K which is split up into the following sections. 1K video RAM which is used as a memory mapped video display. 1K workspace/user RAM for programming require ments. 2K monitor Nas-Sys 1 which is the operating system supporting 22 commands and allows a total of 42 user accessible RST operations including character input/ output, system reset, relative sub-routine call, input a line and position cursor. 8K Microsoft BASIC is available for the Nascom 2 making it possible to convert programs with few modifications into Nascom BASIC. Nascom has added a number of features to Microsoft BASIC including on-screen line editing thereby simplifying program entry and modification. In an effort to make system modifications and machine code routines simpler Nascom has added the routines DEEK and DOKE which read or write 16 bit integers and complement the usual 8 bit PEEK and POKE commands. Special routines have been incorporated into Nascom BASIC making sophisticated graphics easy to generate. The remaining 8K RAM gives the user the option to use both ROM and RAM for additional flexibility. A 57 character keyboard is the Nascom 2 standard, the extra keys being cursor control keys and another shift key. The machine can be linked up to a monitor or be plugged into a UHF television set, giving a 16 line x 48 character display. Cassette recorder and printer input/output interfaces are incorporated into the design as well as a parallel input-out (PIO) controller which allows the connection of several peripherals without needing external logic The kit form Nascom 2 costs  without a user RAM, and  for the board level version, Early 1982 saw the launch of the Nascom 3 in the year after Nascom microcomputers was bought out by Lucas Logic, the computer arm of the industrial giant Lucas. Essentially it is the same as the Nascom 2 but is supplied in cased form The big baby of the Nascom family is aimed at educational, professional and business users and is the most sophisticated of the range. Now you can use either a cassette recorder or disc drives for leading software and there is a choice of operating systems available. Two modules can be bought, either 8K or 32K inbuilt memory which can be expanded to 60 kilobytes. The Nascom 3 can be linked up to single or dual disc drives. If you want more than four drives you have to attach extra floppy disc controllers. These come in a case, complementing the Nascom 3 which you can plug into the computer Screen-wise a 40 or 80 column 25 line display is available with high resolution colour graphics consisting of eight foreground and eight background colours Double density two colour graphics are another feature, and you can select a character set and program your own Software for the Nascom range is available for both business and entertainment applications. Leeds based Program Power is the principal software supplier for the Nascom computer and was set up to market solely Nascom compatible software. Since then it has branched into software for other machines, the Acorn Atom and most recently the BBC Microcomputer. Amongst the programs on sale from Program Power are games including versions of Lunar Lander, Star Trek, Alien Labyrinth, Space Fighter, Chess, Noughts and Crosses, Super Life, Backgammon, Sargon Chess, Chess, and Othello. Packages are also available for word processing and personal finance as well as programming aids like the toolbox, graph plotter, vocabulary tutor and Xtal BASIC The price range goes from .95 right up to  which you will pay for the Xtal Basic 2.2 machine code written program. The majority of Program Power's software is written for 8K RAM Nascom computers unless otherwise stated. Products are available mail order from Program Power, 5 Wensley Road, Leeds, LS7 2LX. Nascom 2 owners are specially catered for by Futura Software which only produces games programs. There are more than a dozen games of a good standard on the Futura catalogue. Many of them are space games with continued on page 82 COMPUTER & VIDEO GAMES 81 "
