However, there are ways of doing playing loads of games and doing stupid piles of work so that it doesn't actually feel as though a person is doing so. Paul's method has been to do nothing all day, play games before going to bed, then write all about it in his sleep, with one hand behind his back, singing Alanis Morisette songs while gargling dishwater. He's not mad, oh no. Despite what some people might say.

This he did in double quick time. Impressed? We almost were.

Though he's no hat to doff, nor cape to proffer for the ladies, Jaime carries himself exquisitely. To him video games are merely another essential part of social etiquette in which he excels, alongside refreshing after-dinner jokes and badminton. In his new home we believe Jaime has begun a fine cabinet collection of model cars, which he has lacquered to preserve them.

"computer video games NEWSO SEGA IN SHOCK MERGER WITH BANDAI!! In one of the most incredible news stories ever to hit the video games industry, world-famous games giants Sega have merged with top toy manufacturers, Bandai! WHAT'S THE REASON BEHIND IT ALL! 14 MISSTLE HUMING THE AFTER MATH SEGA BANDAI! SEGA MERGE WITH TOY GIANTS BANDAI! The move, which was announced on Thursday 23rd January, will take place as of the 1st October, and will result in Sega absorbing Bandai, to create an all-new multimedia entertainment conglomerate with total consolidated earnings reaching around 600 billion Yen (around  billion)! The new company is to be called SEGA BANDAI LTD and both firms say it will allow them to carve a position as a major player in the global entertainment industry, by combining their strengths and resources. Sega are Japan's largest arcade machine manufacturers, and the country's second largest console producer. Its profits currently total Y39.1 billion. Bandai is a major toy company in Japan, with top-selling character-based toys such as Power Rangers, Gundam and Sailor Moon. It's also responsible for the biggest toy craze in Japan at the moment the pocket-sized Tamagochi (see Editorial for more details on this toy!). Bandai's profits total Y21.7 billion. Total capitalised profit for the new Sega Bandai Ltd will be around Y60 billion, making it a very potent company. Although the merger is of an equal basis, Bandai itself will dissolve, with a share exchange deal rating Bandai shares at 1 for every 0.76 Sega ones. Interestingly, it is Bandai's president, Makoto Yamashina, who will be appointed president of the new conglomerate. Sega's president, Hayao Nakayama, will become vice president in charge of corporate strategies. A third company is also involved. The CSK Group a major information service firm which holds a 20% share in Sega will contribute its information technologies to Sega Bandai Ltd. CSK's chairman, Isao Okawa, will become the new company's chairman. Its share ratio will remain the same in the new firm. An event of this magnitude is naturally going to send shockwaves through the video games industry, particularly in both companies home territory of Japan. But was it to be expected, is it good news, and what are its effects going to be? The decision is said to be a result of difficult situations at both companies. Sega has been faced with increased competition from Sony Computer Entertainment and the PlayStation, which has been gaining a larger market share, notably here in Europe and in the US. Also, the launch of N64 as a direct competitor for Saturn and PlayStation has intensified rivalry in the games industry. It is of note too, that early in January, Bandai announced loses of 9 billion Yen. This is said to be due to a drop in game sales and a poor reception to its Apple Macintosh-related console, the Pippin Atmark. It is also thought that this move is a response to the mergers of a large number of American companies. Bandai's president, Yamashina, says they chose Sega for the merger, because he believes an American style of top-down management is essential to survive the intensifying global competition. He also considers Sega to have a president with strong management policy. The Tokyo Stock Exchange on the day of the of the announcement, gave some indication of what shareholders thought of the move. Bandai shares shot up, while Sega's ended down. A reflection of general feeling that Bandai will now benefit from access to a vital overseas market and new technologies. Sega on the other hand, are seen to be conceding they can no longer compete against their main rivals on their own. Analysts see this merger as the first step in a major reorganisation of the market. And there are rumours that Nintendo may also form a strategic merger this year, as Nintendo 64 continues to struggle. So how will the new merger affect the Sega that we're familiar with? Well hopefully, things should be better than ever. The new conglomerate will have three separate departments dealing with game machines, multimedia networking and toys. Sega's president, Hayao Nakayama, is quoted as saying \"Sega is strong in high-tech areas such as virtual reality and 3D computer graphics, but that is not enough. We can learn a lot from Bandai's marketing and product-planning, backed by high-quality characters.\" He also believe they will now have access to a larger group of customers, adding the young market of Bandai to the teen groups they already appeal to. Potentially, Sega are now in a much better position to succeed. If their union with Bandai can give quality games like NIGHTS and the Virtua Fighter series the same appeal as the Power Rangers, Sega could have a very good 1997. NEWS  7  Virtua Cop 2. Did we ever see a Imagine action figures decent range of and cartoons! Sonic toys. Nope. Bandai are good at pushing characters. Can they succeed with the Sega range? "

"ENIX FORSAKE NINTENDO 64 DD MARS ATTACKS COMPETITION computer video games THE ART O Dragon Quest VII (DQVII) by Enix originally destined to be a Nintendo 64 DD exclusive is now to debut on PlayStation. The announcement made on 14 January came as a massive shock to Nintendo gamers who have been following the series on the Famicom (NES) and Super Famicom (Super NES) since it began in 1986. Even more so than Final Fantasy, the Dragon Quest name is of utmost significance to the Japanese video game market. Whichever system supports the next instalment of this multi-million selling saga WILL become the most powerful. Everyone has been rumoured to have been talking to Enix in order that DQVII would be developed for their system. In the end Enix decided on Sony's machine simply because there are now far more PlayStation users out there. Given the massive Super Famicom userbase in : Japan, it is obvious that not all of them have decided upon their next machine Saturn, PlayStation, or Nintendo 64. This latest announcement is almost certain : to have made that decision for them. On a more general note, Enix haven't ruled out the N64 altogether. They still intend to produce software for that system and have titles already in development. Saturn too is said to have Enix games in development. But not Dragon Quest VII. Expect PS DQVII sometime in early 1999, and to eat up around three or four CDs. Mars Attacks is one cool film. If you've checked out this month's back page you can find out all about it. To find out even more you should take a gander at this excellent new book: Mars Attacks! The Art of the Movie. In it you will find all the background information about how the film was put together, which includes: Tim Burton's original concept sketches; Storyboards and costume designs, models and blueprints; photos of the production and, best of all, how the Martians were brought to life.

Already released in Japan, and now set to come to Britain, is a PlayStation system that allows people to create games at home. Designed by the PlayStation's creator, Ken Kutaragi, the Yaroze (which is Japanese for Let's Create) takes the form of a black PlayStation that plugs into a PC. Sony believe that with three-quarters of a million PlayStation owners in Britain, the potential for home-grown games could be massive. Don't get too carried away by the idea of becoming a bedroom programmer like Geoff Crammond, Tony Crowther and Jeff Minter though. The Net Yaroze will set you back .

"computer video games APOLOGIES TO NORTHERN IRELAND BAG THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF Dear CVG, I am writing to express my disappointment at the lack of a free book on the cover of my CVG magazine. My favourite part of your magazine is Dave Kelsall's retro computer cabin, and so I would really like a copy of the book. As a reader of several Emap magazines I have enjoyed many free gifts, even if it involves paying a little extra. If there is any way I can obtain a copy I would really appreciate it. A McNeil, N Ireland COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES o STAR LETTER YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE CVG: This was the most polite and humbling letter we received on this embarrassing subject. We owe all our readers in Northern Ireland a big apology for the missing book on issue 182. For some reason our distributors classed the whole of Ireland as being outside of the UK, whereas we all know that it is included. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it as the books were all produced to a strict limited edition. However if we ever do another print run we shall try to make some available for Northern Ireland free of charge. computer video games ALWAYS IN HIS DREAMS Dear CVG, Every time I play a game I think of some things that would make it a lot better, but when No.2 comes out or sometimes even No.3 those things I thought of haven't been added. So I thought maybe you could make one or two pages where people could write in saying their ideas of how to improve a game and you could pass that information on to the makers of that game so if they were going to make a No.2 they could use those ideas. I thought of maybe calling it \"Your Game\" section. Oliver, London Melody Box and the Nightopean Collection. Melody Box was brilliant in that you can change the mood so that it affects the glorious cybersound NIGHTS soundtrack. And then just today! discovered the magic of artificial life system!! And then I created my first hybrid of mepians. BRILL!! Then I cross-bred a mepian with a nightmaren to make a double mypian hybrid!! BRILL x2.0!! How could I ever fail to notice the superb A-Life?? Which is why the collection is so good as it lets you see your own Nightopians/ mepians creation. Christmas NIGHTS is all I want for this Christmas. My life is now fulfilled. I love NIGHTS. I love NIGHTS. I love Sonic Team and I love everybody. Merry Christmas everyone. MERRY CHRISTMAS!! Everyone must own NIGHTS Into Dreams as it is the greatest game on Earth. Ever. CVG: How many times... this is what Mail Bag is for! We'd be extremely lucky if all readers aired their opinions on gameplay on these pages. Developers do take note y'know. Or at least they would. * COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES READERS VOICE CVG: A man very much after Paul's heart. Or is it Ed. Sorry but we lost your name! IT'S ALL OUR FAULT (AS USUAL) Dear CVG, I want to say a very big thank you to Sonic Team/ Sega for bringing us the most memorable experience ever. NIGHTS is the most incredible thing that has happened to me. I first played NIGHTS on a demo (thank you so much SSM). Wow!! was the reaction when I first played it. The graphics were bright, colourful and very beautiful, and the music well it was brilliant and I was impressed. But I thought it was just another platformer but only better graphics. It was a few days later when I first realised the brilliance of NIGHTS. I accomplished a magnificent 15link (using a normal control pad). And thus, with NIGHTS getting your SIX page review and Sonic Team's track record, I did decide to fork out 60 smackers for NIGHTS and it was worth every penny. I did finish NIGHTS worryingly fast but then i remembered what the legendary Sonic Team said and I quote \"We made it to take several hours to finish because we want everyone to see the end. After that you can still enjoy playing for hours by the score attack function.\" And enjoy it I did but it was not to be until a few days later. After much practice I did beat the bosses in ever faster times, then I started racking up massive scores!! And then I got first continuous links after hours of practice and broke the 50 links barrier, gasp! I played NIGHTS for endless hours well into the night perfecting each course scoring ever higher and higher scores/ links but I never did get tired of it. This is the most fun I had had for ages; the continuous links, defeating bosses in x2.0 multipliers, record scores, increasing bonus time and the excellent cybersound. I got all excited when I read about Christmas NIGHTS. Four very long and stressful weeks passed before I finally got hold of Christmas NIGHTS along with VC2 and NIGHTS (NIGHTS?? Yes NIGHTS in mint condition I know, I know but I really love it). Anyhow | still remember how I ran home, place it in my beloved Saturn and played it for the very first time. Sob! Sob! How overjoyed I was to play Christmas NIGHTS, the intro, the Christmas music, the Christmas Spring Valley. It was a dream come true. But the best was yet to come as I opened my first present in a game of patience. It was a NIGHTS museum then the Karaoke. I finally knew the lyrics to the divine Dreams Dreams. After this I opened a movie and then LINK and TIME ATTACK presents. Super! The next present was none other than Sonic the Hedgehog Into Dreams!! And guess who's the boss?? Dr Robotnik as Puffy!! opened my last two presents without much interest but boy was it as good as all others?? In my opinion it WAS!! They are none other than Dear CVG, I bought a PlayStation because of you and your hype now I am going to exchange it for a Saturn. The PlayStation games are all graphics and no game play and have no lastability apart from Wipeout 2097. The Saturn has VF2 on it and VF3 coming to it along with games like Sonic 3, NIGHTS, Virtua Cop 1 and 2. I have learned not to get taken in by the hype and unless your mag changes I am going to stop buying it. You shouldn't hype any machine you should just tell us about the games and if a game is on two machines you should just say which version is better, and what is better about it if it plays the same. I've seen a lot of bad comments in your mag, and unless it stops I will stop buying it. David CVG: Yeah? Well, sod off then you ungrateful git. You're talking rubbish.

Meanwhile check out Suikoden for your PlayStation. 2. Only if there's proper software support for it which means no. 3. No way are you going to see Toki Meki outside of Japan, it's too diverse. Which is a kind way of saying that only sad young men with no lives would want to play it. 4. The question marks are secrets that you unlock by achieving certain unspecified goals. You have to play the games an awful lot basically. 5. Dunno, sorry. 6. All the Namco titles for your PlayStation, and the Virtual On controller for the Saturn. 14 "

Though the game never made it into every arcade in the country, it still managed to do fairly well, mostly appealing to Tekken 2 players. When next to machines like Virtua Fighter 2, Soul Edge doesn't look all that impressive, but in the home it's one of the best-looking games yet something that Namco seem to have done with just about every one of their PlayStation games so far.

RELEASED BY SONY TEL: 0171 533 1400 PlayStation We reckon this is the one most Sony fans are waiting for! The PlayStation's real answer to Virtua Cop 2, with the PlayStation's real answer to the Virtua Gun. Go! You Oq017046 hein Bad SopOOL amco's Time Crisis has been out in the arcades for nearly a year, but it's still one of the most popular coin-ops around. In fact, it's perhaps more popular now than when it was first released. Gun Games have always been a big arcade draw, but in the last year they've really taken off. Sega started the ball rolling with Virtua Cop turning limited shooting gallery affairs into realtime 3D hostile situations! And at first glance, it's acceptable to think Time Crisis is little more than another Virtua Cop-clone. But those who really play it, know Time Crisis offers a unique challenge of its own, every bit as compelling as the Cop series. Now the countdown to PlayStation Crisis has begun! E579 RE CS3 GASIS THE HOTTEST PLAYSTATION GUN GAME! namco namco HOW GOES THE CONVERSION? All the pictures you see in this feature are from the PlayStation version of Time Crisis. When running it's an amazingly close reproduction of the coin-op. All the more so considering this is Namco's first conversion of a System 22 game onto PlayStation. Only the resolution has been slightly reduced. However, on first impressions, all the detail looks to be there, and even the story scenes have already been included! 2633 Baca LOW THE PEDAL WORKS! If you've never played Time Crisis (do so!), here's an explanation of how the pedal works, giving you some idea of its importance in the game! 3220 AUTO-COVER! When the pedal is relaxed, you're automatically hidden. When you start a stage, this gives you breathing time before hitting the pedal and swinging out into the line of fire! CSCCS RELOAD! Ducking under cover is also the method of reloading. This affects your rhythm far more than just shooting outside the screen. Bullets need to be fired selectively and accurately! A GAME WITH A GIMMICK-THE PEDAL!  AVOID ENEMY FIRE! In the line of fire, enemy bullets can be seen heading your way. Or shot-marks snake along the floor toward you. Experts stay exposed until the last split-second before ducking, WANCAR S DANGER! HARD OBJECTS! It's not just enemy fire that needs to be avoided. During more dramatic moments, crane hooks swing past, or cars, race toward you. You can't shoot these out of the way! The singular feature that sets Time Crisis apart from Virtua Cop, is its pedal which allows you to duck out from behind scenery. Just a cheap gimmick? Some people would think so, but this is a gimmick that dramatically changes the gameplay, from reflex gun-slinging, to dodging-and-sniping. You're not just ducking behind scenery because you can, you're ducking behind it because you HAVE to!  KEEP THEM IN SIGHT! Keeping hidden may protect you, but in the meantime the enemy are still moving about. Unless you keep popping, out, you won't be able to keep tabs on where they re hiding. And all the while, time is ticking... ATGE ACTIONS 24 "


"ORIGINAL FEATURES! computer Video games NEGCON TE WEAPON! Arcade Time Crisis has two modes Story Mode and a Timed Mode. The timed option pits you only on a single level. You can't be hurt, but you have to complete it in the best time. Both these modes will be in the PlayStation version. Of course, Namco have a sturdy reputation for including excellent home-specific features and we've yet to see what they do. We know there's going to be a PlayStation-exclusive level. How it fits into the game or what it contains, has yet to be revealed! Station Vital to a successful conversion of the arcade game, is an accurate replica of the gun. Namco have gone to extraordinary lengths to make the PlayStation gun as precise as possible. It's exactly the same shape ang size as the coin-op weapon, and feels weighty too. It lacks the arcade version's kickback, but thanks to effective sound-effects, this isn't missed. Most interestingly, the gun cable divides into two. One piece plugs into the joypad port, the second plug goes into the yellow video out socket at the back of the PlayStation. nata This allows the gun to read what's onscreen and what the PlayStation is sending to the TV The Namco too, resulting in NegCon.

The gameplay is based around an ever-decreasing time limit. Previously gun games have only tested your shoot ing accuracy Time Crisis is a race against time, complete with checkpoints! This hectic pace all adds to the tension. It's all fair enough hiding behind crates, but time is running out. \"Hurry Up!' is flashing on screen, and bullets are ricocheting everywhere. Suddenly you have to leap out into enemy fire, risking death to make that next Time Extension! That's the driving force behind Time Crisis! THE HOTTEST PLAYSTATION GUN GAME! WHAT ABOUT THE PEDAL? How Namco were going to substitute the coin-op pedal has been one of the most talked about points of Time Crisis' conversion. As expected, they've, fitted a switch to the side of the gun. It's easy enough to use, the only problem being that you have to hold the gun in two hands! One of the bosses. He throws daggers, which you have to avoid, at the cost of valuable seconds! STORY MODE! *** SIGHTSEEING! * * * The whole of Time Crisis is one long wending mission, separated into stages by the various checkpoints. Taking place in a huge fortress, you start in a ware house area, moving to cable-car lift system. Following this, the action moves to the courtyard area, where ground cannons join the fray! Each area is designed to be a action set.piece. For example, once in the tower, Richard Millar runs down a dead end with a large mirror. Baddies suddenly appear in the reflection, and he spins around to face them. That's when the stage begins! WAITI956 Adding to the drama of Time Crisis is an excellent Story Mode. You play the role of Richard Miller, a gun-toting hero who is attempting to rescue his girlfriend, the prisoner of an evil terrorist group. She's being held at the top of a clock tower, and she's going to be executed on the hour! You've got to get to her before it's too late!

"computer Video games 'THE SECRET FIGHTERSI As we said in the last issue, there are 10 secret characters to collect in Fighters Megamix, all taken from other AM2-related games. They range from seriously good fighters, to pure comedy value, but have all had lots of time spent on their look and fighting style. Want to know more? JANET Janet Marshall from Virtua Cop 2 is gained by completing the Girls course, and is probably the best of the hidden characters. The main reason for her being so cool is that she's heavily based on the excellent new Aoi Umenokoji character from Virtua Fighter 3! On top of some excellent floating combos and clever throw combinations, Janet has damaging attack reversals... and her Virtua Gun! With all of these moves, Janet is a force to be reckoned with and one of the most enjoyable characters to play with in Fighters Megamix! VS MODE SELECT YOUR FIGHTER SECRET CARACTERS Pai's new running kick smashes the bonnet from the Daytona Hornet! DO ARIRA VS TDRID pose To Tiles One of Janet's throws simply turns and stuns opponents, leaving them open to a devastating rear attack! This is one of the most entertaining moves in the game to perform! SECRET FIGHTERS REVEALED! SIBA Siba is your reward for finishing the Bosses course. He was originally intended to appear in the first Virtua Fighter game, but was left out in favour of Akira at the last minute. He reappears in Fighters Megamix, only this time he's armed with a big sword which can be used in most of his special attacks. Because Siba was a VF1 character, he doesn't have as many attacks as a lot of the other fighters, and even looks a bit more blocky than the others. SER Janet also has Aoi's excellent reversals from Virtua Fighter 3, letting her grab opponent's limbs, and stamp on them! SIDA 99BARK BEAN At the end of the Muscle Fighters course is Bark the Polar Bear from AM2's Sonic Fighters arcade game. Bark looks pretty much as good as he does in the arcade, and has the same moves plus some excellent throws! You will get to play as Bean the Duck at the same time as you access Bark. Bean is armed with bombs which he can throw or kick during the fight, as well as being able to teleport around the arena!

He wears a robotic suit which allows him to launch fireballs along the floor, as well as do some excellent combos, but this suit doesn't last forever. Above Rentahero's energy bar is a line of batteries, and these wear down as the fight goes on. If the batteries run out Rentahero loses his space suit, along with most of his moves! The last character you collect by completing the Secret Fighters course. That's right, you can play as the car from Daytona USA! The Hornet stands up on its boot and attacks with its wheels, meaning some very weird moves! At the end of the Vipers course is Ura Bahn almost like an evil version of the main Fighting Viper.

It replaces Kumachan on the Secret course, but isn't playable (well, we haven't been able to play as it yet). After battling all of the Dirty Fighters course, you get to play as Deku a big green bean wearing a hat, and holding some maracas. As far as we know, he's been created especially for Fighters Megamix and hasn't appeared in any other AM2 games. He fights completely differently to any of the other characters, with a kickflip which makes him fall on his back, and a punch which makes him shake maracas at his opponent! Weird! STAGE 1 1 AM2's logo fights back! The palm tree is just mad! 99. 99 99 NIKU After lots of play, you'll discover that Kumachan has an extra costume which turns him into a new character — Niku the piece of meat! He fights just like Kumachan, only he has big hands and feet to make it possible to see what you're doing! WINNER WINS When Deku loses his top-level armour, his hat comes off to reveal a bird sitting on his head! It watches you wherever you go! 1 Niku looks like the meat power-up from Golden Axe! COMING SOON * KIDS AKRA KIDS SARAH * MORE MEGAMIX! Defeating the Virtua Fighters course gives players the chance to play as Kids Akira, with ALL of the grown-up Megamix Akira's moves! Fighting as a VF Kid against full-sized characters can be very difficult, as their reach is very TATININICE short indeed! The miniature version of Sarah is added to your collection at the same time as Kids Akira, and again plays just like her larger counterpart. Her short reach is very awkward, though. As AM2 are taking their time over the UK version of FMM, we may not have a review of the final version next issue. So we're being careful not to reveal everything in the game so as not to spoil the surprises. AATININCR "

Get ready to battle the Zentraedi forces! CRYSTAL HDREAMS COM ROBOTECH: DREAMS his Robotech: Crystal Dreams, is a lot like Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire. Both games are offshoots of popular series. Both, through a range of merchandising, plan to expand their respective universes, with the pinnacles of these expeditions being a game on the Nintendo 64. Although this game has a long way to go before completion we just couldn't resist telling you all about it. CRYSTAL DREAMS ISSAMMMEE ROBOTECH ANIME CLASSIC COMING TO N64 Robotech is a sprawling space adventure which took American audiences by storm, almost a decade ago. More than just a show for kids, adults too began to love this space opera. With its classy artwork and complex storyline, the 86 episodes that were made have now achieved a classic status. Robotech is a series full of space battles, heroes and villains and, best of all, huge transforming craft! Crystal Dreams is the first episode of an all-new saga set in the Robotech universe created by two long-time fans of the series Lizard Harac and Doug Lanford. The game allows you to interact with famous Robotech characters, including Rick Hunter and Max Sterling. Mixing with these characters allows you to make choices, dictating the direction of the game. Also promised are multiple endings, so there should be a great replay value. No doubting the N64 is capable of producing these kinds of special effects, though. Look forward to it! Don't expect the finished game to look quite like this. These shots are pre-production only. The character reflected in the canopy is ace pilot, Rick Hunter of the EDF.  NO0S OLD AND NEW ENEMIES AND FRIENDS Fans of the Robotech series will be pleased to see some familiar faces from the Robotech universe. You will have to battle fleets of Zentraedi ships, ranging from power-armoured Zentraedi warriors to the powerful Officers Pod. You'll also have to face the crystalline Ebolian legions, and even renegade members of the Robotech Defence Force. Phew, that's quite a lot of enemies! Luckily you'll have some allies too, including Rick Hunter and Breetai. Robotech art is usually pretty cool. We suspect this is the work of a freelance hired by Gametek for the box. NEXT MONTH... BUT A STAR IN MIN MAI'S EYE YOUR VERITECH FIGHTER In order to rid the galaxy of evil, you'll be needing some sort of craft to fight back in. Enter your very own Veritech Fighter a fully transformable craft featuring different abilities in Fighter, Battleoid and Guardian modes. You must learn to master the different strengths and weaknesses of each mode, as this is the key to success. When you change your craft's modes, the controls dramatically reconfigure. As you can see Robotech still has a long way to go before completion. Even in this early stage of design, it looks like the game could give StarFox 64 some very close competition. 30 "

ROM WRECKIN CREW 03:36106 15:31:85 f course, when the original Super NES Mario Kart first appeared, it too ran a one-horse race in the 'Mario Kart-style' genre it had created for itself. At least it did until Vivid Image saw potential in this virtually untapped market and released its own Street Racer, which proved successful with both SNES owners after more of the same, and Mega Drive owners after their own Mario Kart. Now in a classic case of history repeating itself, we have a new 32-bit Street Racer following hot on the heels of Mario Kart 64. Only now there's a new player in town. Quickdraw were formerly part of the Vivid Image team. However, uninspired by the idea of just upgrading Street Racer to 32-bit systems, they left to create their own version of events. Still competing on the same terms as Mario Kart, but with their own distinct idea about what a street racer should hold. CIRCUIT BREAKERA RACE AND CHASE AND DESTROY WITH WRECKIN CREW! Wreckin Crew has to feature THE most complex circuits of any race game if you can call them circuits! The courses feature all manner of unique diversions and detours throughout. These are sectioned off with traffic cones and barriers, so lily-livered racers can stick to the set route. More daring drivers though, can crash through these barriers in the hope of finding a shortcut. Take note though the track maps look like a plate of spaghetti! So maze-like are these courses Take a good look. This a that they are perfect, even for the Deathmatch mode. blueprint for one of the tracks! THE CREW 00:03-11 There are eight different vehicles in Wreckin Crew, each piloted by a tragically-stereotyped driver. There's a hillbilly hag called Ma, aristocratic Sir Cuss, swotty Kid Kranium, inbred twins Cane and Able, nutty Dr Nitrous, IQ the mutant, dreadlocked Cheeba and feminist Lady Bird. Each Wreckin Crew vehicle has a side attack, back attack and special move. The weapons are, of course, tied into the character's image. Ma, for example, has an elephant gun, chickens and pig, and a guff attack. Doctor Nitrous on the other hand, has an electric gun, acid flasks and a teleport. GANGPLAY! Both the PC and PlayStation versions of Wreckin Crew are set to be nearly identical. The only reala difference being the multiplayer option. The PC version will feature netplay, allowing up to eight players to compete. The PlayStation version features two-player splitscreen or linked. After all, it's unlikely eight players will link their PlaySatations together. CD-ROM USTATIOLLA COMING SOON THE WRECKIN! The level of interaction with the scenery on each of Wreckin Crew's tracks is impressive. There's over 100 types of roadside object that can be smashed into. Tyre stacks can be knocked all over the road, parked cars can be shoved around. What's more, as you race, the tracks themselves deteriorate. Skidmarks appear and potholes are left on the surface! NEXT MONTH.. WRECKIN' TIME!! Thre's certainly plenty of ideas in Wreckin Crew and so far it all looks promising. With both versions scheduled for 20th March release, we hope to have a review next month. Mario Kart, Street Racer, watch your backs! 1 FMV sections introduce the wild and wacky characters. Looks hilarious. 32 "

PORSCHE CHALLENGE n their ongoing quest to gain the ultimate cool image, Sony have signed up with a car designer whose image IS one of ultimate cool! Moreover, they've signed up the latest coolest car from this designer the ,000 Porsche Boxster! Of course, we told you all this back in our Nov issue (#180) when the car itself was launched. Now however, Porsche Challenge is almost ready for launch, in spring of this year! Sony have big plans for it too. In their own words it's going to be released \"with all the usual hype which surrounds the major launch of a luxury sports car from one of the world's premier manufacturers.\" And we thought it was just a game!! Barne pooktion 8:00: 03 0:00:0 3rd 0:00.0 3rd 13:40:3 \"30 250 OKINT MY OTHER RACE GAME'S A PORSCHE! * NO TWO DRIVERS ARE THE SAME! * * THE PORSCHE FACTOR! * Seeing as the only car featured in Porsche Challenge is the Boxster, variety would seem to take a back seat. NOT SO! There are seven different drivers to choose from, and each one has their own characteristics and driving style. Each can be identified by their uniquely coloured car, but better still you can look at them in the open-top cockpit. 150 polygons have gone into making each one individual! They've even been motion-captured, so when they move in realtime to your steering commands, it looks convincing. Sony have even gone as far as giving each one an 'cool' occupation. From a kick boxer and hacker, to test pilot, model and even a DJ. Coolest of all though is Nikita she's a journalist! Sony's deal with Porsche is more than just a license to use the name. The game's creators (the Sony in-house team behind the successful Total NBA '96) have been supplied technical data by the Boxster's designers themselves. This has allowed them to put an incredible amount of detail into the look of the cars. 300 textured polygons make the vehicles look stunningly authentic, to the point where there's even dashboard details such as the stereo! Better still, using advanced realtime simulation of the cars' dynamics, the in-game vehicles handle totally authentically. time position position 3rd 0:00:0 tim2:38:7 COMING SOON PRINT 36 "


"* COURSE FRENZY * computer games video When you start, there are four courses in the game. However, there are 20 track combinations possible! Starting in Classic Mode, you have to beat the clock (checkpoint-style) across Europe, an Alpine terrain, USA and Japan. Next up is Interactive Mode, which rewards fast racers with hidden shortcuts and bonuses! Crack all these courses and you have to beat a Test Driver on an accurate replica of Porsche's Stuttgart test tracks. There's many more Modes after this, including an even longer Interactive Mode, Mirror Mode (of course) and a dream handling mode, where you become the infamous Test Driver! PlayStation Taking a shortcut on the slippery Alpine circuit. Keep an eye out for them! Porsche Boxsters. Bah, look everyone's got one. Common as muck! * PORSCHE VS PORSCHE * A head-to-head feature is always a major boost to the appeal of a race game. Porsche Challenge features a split-screen mode too, so you don't lose out if you haven't a link-cable + friend who's willing to lug their machine/ game/ telly to your house! Similar to Sega Rally or Daytona, it also has a 'Catch-Up' feature, allowing the player in second place to keep up. The difference here though, is that the game is intelligent, allowing the other player to catch-up, but not to steal first place without using skill! A good thing too! * KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD! * Great looking as the cars are, the game creators have put equal attention into the surroundings. There are leaves which get caught and swirl in your slipstream. Mud pools too, splash up onto the vehicles. The illusion of an outdoor environment is all the more convincing as well, thanks to three light sources playing on the cars' surfaces! MY OTHER RACE GAME'S A PORSCHE! * GOOD DRIVING MUSIC * A lot of effort has gone into the music in Porsche Challenge. More specifically, into making it interactive! Using what Sony call 'SPU streaming' the PlayStation acts like a multitrack tape-player. As such the tempo of the tunes (there's one for each driver) changes according to in-game situations, such as when time is running out. What's more, if other cars get closer, their tune starts to blend with your own to indicate their proximity! On top of all this, you even get interference on the radio when going under bridges! 31:6 \" 3 6th checo 20:6 35: 32 NEXT MONTH... THE GRAND UNVEILING! Only a fool would fail to see that Porsche Challenge is going to be something special. Sony reckon it's going to be the most realistic driving sim seen on PlayStation! More so even than Formula One, but with all the arcade thrills of Rage Racer. Hopefully we'll find out next issue! 37 "

Laura's just awoken from hypersleep. We think you'll have trouble sleepin We sleepines, We thinta's just I Et WARP'S STUNNING SCI-FI ADVENTURE arp released their Sci-Fi adventure on the Saturn in Japan just before Christmas. A copy arrived soon after in the office. Since then we've been snowed under by games, and we kind of forgot about EO. Never mind because now we're hooked! It's an amazing game, much bigger than Warp's previous outing D. Full of suspense and eerily open corridors. A spaceship full of faulty electronics. A small crew not knowing what's going to happen next. And a mysterious entity with a craving for human flesh. As with D, the star of the show is Laura. How she made the leap from the twentieth century into the future we still don't know. In the game she acts even more bemused than before. Who's surprised, what with all this weird stuff going on around her. How could the same thing happen to the same woman twice! Hmm maybe we should copyright that line, before they use it for Tomb Raider 2. TRAININE MODE WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!! TRAINING MIDE Enemy Zero starts with the crew of the long-haul space freighter AK-1 being woken from hypersleep by the ship's computer. The computer is malfunctioning and has started running an emergency program. Laura walks over to her Vexx Network console to use the video phone. Trying to speak to the other six crew members, all she gets are disconnected messages or screens full of static. Then a horrifying sound is heard through the static hiss crew member Parker's screams! They grow louder, then suddenly stop. Suddenly the static clears, and the image of Parker's quarters appears on Laura's screen. Except the room doesn't look like it should: Objects overturned, the room is a mess, and every thing is covered in blood. Laura turns off the console, regains her composure, and realises what she must do. Even though there is a strange presence somewhere in the ship, she must venture out, restore the ship's power, and find and stop this monster before the ship returns to Earth. o K LOOK LISTEN LEARN COMING SOON Included in the final Japanese version of the game is a very handy training mode. Without this course in alien detection, you'll be their next meal for sure. The training consists of three lessons. In each the object is to detect and destroy a set number of virtual drones. In lesson one you are aided in drone detection by a map showing their whereabouts. Plus all the drones are visible. Lesson two and the stakes are raised. You still have your map, but now all the drones are invisible. Lesson three PU and things get really hairy. The drones are invisible, and you don't have a map to show their position. You have to resort to the sound detection method in order to find the three drones. Believe us, if you want to succeed in the main game, you have to be taught these lessons first. Laura gets ready to hook up to the Vexx Network. She won't like what she's gonna see! 38 "


"VEXX POSITIONING SYSTEM computer Video ganes The only instrument to aid you in detecting the invisible aliens, is the Vexx Positioning System. This is a small ear-piece Laura wears which reveals the positions of the aliens with simple musical beeps. There are three different musical notes corresponding to where the alien is in relation to Laura. The highest note means the alien is in front of you. With a lower note the alien is either to the left or the right. The lowest note indicates the alien is behind you. When the alien gets closer to Laura from any direction, that note will start repeating itself faster. You can only shoot the alien if it's directly in front of you. So with clever positioning of Laura, you can find the alien in whatever room you visit. CHARSE VED A5 This is the Vexx Positioning System earpiece that Laura wears to detect that alien presence. FILL YOUR POCKETS There are a number of key objects to find early in the game. Some are Peasy to find. Others require a little more exploration and puzzle solving. Whereas D's puzzles had a mysterious gothic element, most of EO'S revolve around the ship's futuristic technology. Common problems you will encounter are opening sealed doors and operating machines. The most important object to find is also the hardest in the opening stages. We're talking about the stun gun. Don't worry, the aliens aren't really a problem until you find it. The VPS ear piece is another vital object to be found, but much easier to locate. Luckily Laura has very large pockets and unlike some adventure games, you can carry whatever you find. WARP'S STUNNING SCI-FI ADVENTURE WARP'S STUNNING SCI-FI ADVENTURE 1 The lock on this door is DNA activated. A finger press on the sensor will open the door. Unfortunately the lock won't respond to Laura's DNA. 1 When playing in normal mode this machine has a very important purpose. We're not saying what. Just experiment with all the objects you've found. COMING SOON 0 DON'T MAKE ME KICK YOUR.. REC to SAVE? The earliest puzzles you will face revolve around finding equipment hidden in the Winter Tower. Some objects such as keys or swipe cards are used to open previously sealed doors. Behind these doors you are guaranteed to find something else cruical in completing your mission. The most difficult puzzle we've encountered so far is restoring the ship's power. Obviously we've been playing the Japanese version, and as such may not have spotted certain clues in the text. Through trial and error we were able to crack the code and restore the ship's power. A good thing! too, because without power you can't leave the Winter Tower. 39 "


"computer video games EXPLORING THE WINTER TOWER SEG SATU The Ak-1 is divided into four towers, each named after the different seasons. You start the game in the Winter Tower in Laura's room. Each tower is a maze of corridors linking the various rooms. In the first part of the game you heed to locate the power room. This is also situated in the Winter Tower but on a different level. Two maps in the database reveal the whereabouts of the various rooms in this tower. They are numbered 01 and B1. LOCKER ROOM MARCUS ROOM Directly north from Laura's room is Marcus' room. Unfortunately the entrance is sealed, with no visible means of opening the door. When Laura approaches the door, all she can do is bang her fists repeatedly, knowing any attempt to gain access is hopeless. STORE ROOM A dark room full of cardboard boxes. A conveyer belt lies motionless. Here you can gain access on another Network terminal. You might get more luck in contacting different members of the ship. There are things you can do to the ship from this terminal, that you couldn't in Laura's room. A strange machine is found on the wall when you enter this room. What is its purpose? We're not saying. On the other end of the small room are three lockers. Each with a different crew member's name on. What's the betting one of them is Laura's? Of course one is. Now how to open it? WARP'S STUNNING SCI-FI ADVENTURE VENtwork Information LOCK MAP HAP_51751 WINTER PERCUS R03 PUIKER RUM EE LAURA'S ROOM STORE DEUM The room where you start the game. The nicest, cleanest looking quarters of the ship. In this room are hidden a few vital objects to aid you in your mission. Don't worry, they're not difficult to find. ERROR LRURE ADORNOUS ININO LAURA'S ROOM 2 ELEVATOR This is a strange thing we found in Laura's room. We're not sure what it does or means, though it appears to be a 3D holographic butterfly. Our first thoughts were it might be like the scarabs found in D. Like we said we're still not sure. Very pretty though. A lift that takes you to a location not on the two initial Winter Tower maps. Once you've completed all the other puzzles in the Winter tower this is where you head. In this game a lift ride definitely doesn't mean you have time to catch your breath. STAIR ROOM Upon entering the airlock which separates the corridors from rooms. You are confronted with a locked door with a key pad on the right. What's the combination? Maybe there isn't one. Quick, look at what Laura has in her inventory to get to the next part of the Winter Tower. 40 "


"CALLING OCCUPANTS OF INTERPLANETARY CRAFT compute videc gamec MAP Information LOCK WINTER LONG SHUTTER ONTRI TE-DOOR ONE I SHUTTERONE Found throughout the ship are consoles connected up to the Vexx Network System. Like the name suggests, all the consoles are linked together. With the video phone you can speak to the other members of the ship. When using the video phone, you will discover problems with the network. Some crew members cannot be reached by certain terminals. Instead you'll have to locate a different console and try again. One member of the crew cannot be accessed, until you've discovered a code. Also on the system is the ship's database. Here you can bring up details about the other crew members. Find out where they're located on the ship, even their age and nationality. Extremely useful is the database containing files on all the ship's components and gadgets. If a certain type of locked door is causing you trouble, look it up in the database to find out what you need to possess to open it. The information section contains blueprint maps of your current tower. There is also a screen showing the time before the ship reaches the Earth, the ships present condition and the speed and course the ship is travelling. The most important screen in the information file allows you to open and close all the doors and airlocks in your present tower.

MAP B1 LOVING THE ALIEN The area represented by map B1 only has three rooms, and one of those is the stair room you entered this part of the tower from. There are still vital things to be done in those two remaining rooms. In D Laura faced the horrors of her family's bloodline. In EO she is pitted against the terror of the invisible alien. There is a lot more interaction in EO than its predecessor. The heavy rendered FMV sequences of the original, have been merged seamlesly with real time gameplay in EO. The majority of this real time gameplay is spent walking the ships lonely corridors. Until you're being hunted or hunting that pesky alien. The only interaction in these sections of the game is the use of Laura's stun gun. The beeping you can hear on your VPS in these sections, really does heighten the element of terror. Remember it can see you. You can't see it. You can run but you can't hide! WARP'S STUNNING SCI-FI ADVENTURE POWER ROOM PARKER'S ROOM Obviously this is where you restore the ship's power. There are lots of strange looking consoles in this room, but only one you can operate. The console to restore the power has five unmarked buttons, and one more labelled Power. The correct sequence of button presses to regain power is... Aha! We're not telling. What do you want us to do, come round to your houses and play the games for you! Parker's room is located in the far corner of a large maze-like storage room/ loading bay. Beware this storage room is where you first encounter the alien! Upon reaching Parker's room Laura has a slight turn in the stomach. Quite right too, the contents of the room really are an unpleasant sight. In the corner of the room is another door. Sealed with a DNA-activated lock. Laura gets ready to aim and fire. What's going to happen next? You'll have to wait until the summer to find out.

We are saddened to hear of the game's British delay, but can understand that due to the large amount of translation required. Remember the game spans four discs. That is a big conversion job. Hopefully the game will appear sometime around the summer. Something well worth looking forward to! 41 "

Now, instead of telling you how great we're expecting it to be, we can tell you exactly how it plays. Rutt MION -4*nt TM orgive us if we go a bit misty-eyed at the mention of Mario Kart. The original Super NES game played a very special role in our lives. For several years after it first appeared in the office, we found there was nothing like a two-player Kart challenge for deciding who was going out to the corner shop in the driving rain. This decision-making process used to cost us whole afternoons and got us all into lots of trouble, but we did it anyway. Yeah, the CVG boys and Mario Kart go back a long way, so you can understand why we were so keen to get our mitts on the 64-bit sequel. Would it be as work-stoppingly addictive as the beloved original? And could the four-player modes really be as fantastic as we had hoped? Well, we're still making our minds up about those questions, but pending the full review, here are some of our initial findings on this most eagerly-awaited Mario game since Mario 64. 18/0 M AL  NINTENDO ICONS OLD AND NEW war 2/3 TIME DJO515 Gap 13 TIMA 00\"PAR LAP 1/3 TIME O1'03\"53 KARTERS ARE SMARTER Players of the SNES game will recall that the drivers used to have different attributes that affected the way their karts handled. The Princess and Yoshi, for example, both had great acceleration but a low top speed and tended to slide around the track, while Bowser and DK Jr were heavier, with slower acceleration, but a higher top speed and surer steering. In Mario Kart 64 the differences between the drivers is much less noticeable in fact, even after numerous road-tests, we're not sure that there is any significant difference between them. They all have very similar top speeds and acceleration, and there doesn't seem to be much difference, if any, in the way their karts handle around corners or on different terrain. Heavier characters seem to ride bumps lower to the ground -perhaps.

If you HOLD the trigger, however, the shell deploys to the rear of the kart and stays there until you release the trigger, acting as a one-hit shield.

LOUIS    MAP SELECT 4    Ebbene  is Super Mario Kart's two-player balloon-bashing Battle Mode was a fine source of knockabout fun, and the FOUR-PLAYER Battle Mode in MK64 is just as good! This time, instead of driving around flat mazes, you're placed in three-dimensional arenas, in which you have to hunt down the other players and blast them with any power-ups you can find. Every successful attack relieves them of one of their three balloons, and the last person with an intact balloon is the winner. "


"TAM DA BOMB! computer video. games One of the best features of Battle Mode is that, when you've lost all your balloons you stay in the game, reincarnated as a bomb car so you can go hunting for whoever caused your demise.

This isn't a review of Mario Kart 64 this is too crucial a title to rate on the strength of four weeks with an imported Japanese copy but after a great deal of playtesting this game has caused much consternation among the CVG reviewers. Though we are all of the opinion that MK64 is a fine game we must admit to being slightly disappointed with it. Here are a few of our thoughts so far. MIRROR! MAIRROR! Mirror Mode is basically the 150 cc class with all the corners reversed. However there are unexpected changes such as oncoming traffic. Eek! TIM WE SENSE A CHANGE IN THE BALANCE Rather than simply adding to the original, unbeatable formula, the programmers have tinkered with it, adding the new features we've mentioned here, but also removing other elements, such as the speed-boost pads, the collectable coins, the individuality of the characters and a lot of the course motifs that gave every track a distinct Super Mario 'flavour'. The balance of the action has also changed from being about 70% racing and 30% combat to being much more combat-based probably more so than any other Shigeru Miyamoto game to date. THE DRIVING GAME WE'VE BEEN GAGGING FOR! ONE HUNDRED SMACKERS IN THE GOB? The points we make may all sound a bit fussy, and whether or not these make a big difference to the game probably depends on whether or not you were a big fan of the original Super NES game and of the Mario games in general. Here at CVG, we're going to keep on playing Mario Kart 64 and you'll have our fully-considered opinion by the time the official game is released. We know copies are exchanging hands for sums in excess of . This is kind of usual for a red hot import game, but in this case we're uncertain as to whether the price is worth it. Watch this space.

MONSTER TRUCKS sygnosis definitely have the monopoly on PlayStation racers at the moment. With only Namco and the Ridge Racer sequels offering any real competition. The great thing about Psygnosis racers is that they dare to be different. Which is where Monster Trucks enters the scene, starring those suped-up kings of car crushing with the amazing suspension and huge wheels. Crazy stuff indeed. Remember: This isn't one of Homer Simpson's favourite sports for nothing! 2°18'2 16°2 2 Du 0053 WHY MONSTER TRUCKS? DIFFERENT TRUCKS TO MOVE THE WORLD MUCHO MACHO MONSTER MASHERS!!! There are nine different rides to choose from at the start of the game, ranging from suped-up pick-up trucks to a monster Humvee. Also included are the cool Volkswagen Beetle and camper van, with each truck boasting different attributes in five different classes: Acceleration, Grip, Turning, Weight and Armour. Of course the bigger vehicles like the Humvee are heavy and have slower acceleration, but they make up for this in armour. Whereas the pick-up trucks like Enzo's have good all-round attributes, with weaker armour. The choice is yours. Somebody wise probably once said, \"A racer is a racer is a racer\". Well, they were wrong. Not all racing games are the same, because not all racing games have Monster Trucks! The best feature about these trucks has to be their amazing suspension. This, coupled with the huge tyres, can get the truck over any type of terrain. And with a bit of perseverance and acceleration, can get them up and over the steepest gradient. So these are the pleasures included in the game. Yes you get a standard race, a start and finish post, with a course to follow inbetween. However, if you're feeling particularly sneaky you can try and find some short cuts and veer off the chosen path. Of course this brings about its own set of problems the wrong shortcut could bring your truck to an abrupt halt; finding yourself stuck in a lava pit, or at the bottom of a deep canyon.

SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT The most original feature of Monster Trucks is the car crushing event a sport which seems like heaven for sofa-seated beer-guzzling spectators. The event is simple drive your truck across a row of cars, earning points according to damage. This round has a sixty-second time limit, with two trucks competing at a time, in a divided indoor arena. These five courses make up the the first season of the championship mode. If you score enough points and finish first in your division you get promoted into the second division. With the aim to finish top of the first (duh)! Each new division has additional courses.

ZAS EXTRESS W I WAS LOST BUT NOW I'M FOUND Not all the races in Monster Trucks are as linear as following a set circuit. In an endurance race you race against eight other vehicles. Difference here is that you must pass nine checkpoints distributed around the level. The result is a bit like a relay race, so this is the level where it really pays to take shortcuts as the roads are narrow and often filled with the other competitors. Rather than a break from the normal racing, endurance is as unique a challenge as the other courses. More proof should you need it, that Monster Trucks has quite a few rather good ideas. COMING SOON Trample over the cars, as you drive off to get ready for your next attempt. If you're pleased with a particular move press circle and give your opponent a toot of your horn!

Yes, after months of watching the import scene, UK owners will finally be able to get their hands on a PAL version of the N64 when it's launched on March 1st. A look at the release schedule shows the four release games are Mario 64, Pilotwings 64, Shadows Of The Empire and Wave Race 64, all expected to retail for about .99 (the machine itself is set to cost .99). Also of importance is our excellent cover game Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, which hits the shelves two days after launch! You can read more about the machine and all these games in our N64 feature starting on page 54. This launch heralds the first four-machine race we've seen in the games industry. Don't expect the PlayStation, PC or Saturn to just sit idle though. Sony are releasing UK versions of Soul Edge (Soul Blade) and Rage Racer. On PC we're still awaiting the muchdelayed Dungeon Keeper and MDK (whenever they're both finally released. And Saturn has Sonic 3D and Dark Saviour, with Fighters Megamix lined up real soon. SPECIAL EDITIONS! 20 years after the original Star Wars revolutionised film-making, the Star Wars trilogy is making its big screen comeback. All in prepara tion for the new Star Wars movies beginning in 1998! These aren't just simple rereleases though all the special effects have been brought up-to-date through computer-enhancement, with new CG models featured in the first Death Star attack. New scenes have also been added the Millenium Falcon blasting off from Mos Eisley, a fly-by of Cloud City, the Rancor Beast eating Oola, and, most famous of all, Jabba the Hutt meeting Han Solo in the first film! Using techniques pioneered in Jurassic Park, Industrial Light and Magic have superimposed a computer-generated Jabba onto a a scene originally cut from the film! Considering most of you probably aren't old enough to have ever seen a Star Wars film on the big screen, this is your big chance. Don't underestimate the power of these movies! Especially with their now THX-enhanced soundtracks! Star Wars arrives on March 21, with The Empire Strikes Back following on April 11 and Return Of The Jedi on April 25.

The edge has been taken off this somewhat, by the fact that both these games appeared at the recent London ATEI, and have also been on test at certain UK arcades.

NINTENDO 64 ome of you have been waiting TOO LONG for this day to arrive. We know because we've listened to your phone calls, read your letters, heard you complaining to the shop assistant! This feature is intended to rekindle the excitement you felt when you first saw the shots of N64 games last July. It's also intended to let you know exactly what to expect when you head into your nearest stockist, Sterling in hand, to buy a cool piece of the gaming future. So, would you, should you, COULD you go out and buy a Nintendo 64 on March 1st? NINTENDO 64 UK LAUNCH DOSS 64-BIT SUCCESSORS TO THE SUPER NES REALITY ENGINE NINTENDO 64: UK LAUNCH 100 112 DO The Nintendo 64 is a joint development between Nintendo 64 and Silicon Graphics. The chipset inside the console the hardware which produces the amazing audio/ video routines is based upon Silicon Graphics' esteemed Reality Engine chipset. As the two companies like to remind us, a Silicon Graphics Reality Engine was at the heart of special effects in films such as Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park. For the player, the significance of true 64-bit technology at home is as much to do with the richness of the environment, and the possibilities within that environment, as it is with looks. Which is why almost all Nintendo 64 games require the use of the new 3D stick to exploit them... When you see the T-Rex coming at you in Turok, you'll believe every word Nintendo said in 1993. AND THE PRICE IS....? OVER THREE MILLION PEOPLE CAN'T BE WRONG! First of all let's clear the price thing up. The Nintendo 64 starter pack is originally going on sale at .99. In the box you get the deck (console), a custom mains adaptor with plug, one grey controller, an RF Modulator, an RF lead, an RF switchbox, and an RF extension cable. Games are extra. ANIVE NINTENDO 64 A glib comment to make, but Nintendo 64 has really taken off in other parts of the world. In Japan it has been noticeably slower than expected, but this is sure to have something to do with a lack of software available early on. In the States, machines have been selling just as fast as the retailers can get them on the shelves. Games like Shadows of the Empire have been almost impossible to obtain on import as a result. So the obvious statement would be \"yes, it is a wise and wonderful decision to buy a Nintendo 64\". Just consider that there are only a handful of games available initially. But with Turok and Mario 64 among them, this shouldn't be too much of a problem! And of course the UK machine is by far the better option for users who want a care-free crack at the whip no power converters to worry about, or wondering if you've got the right picture or not. Go for it! 54 "

NINTEND Half the magic of playing any of the key N64 titles lies in the uniqueness of this controller. Though Sega and Sony now have analogue devices of their own, they are mostly just accessories to make playing existing games more exciting. With N64 the analogue centrepiece is essential the new breed of games depend on it. Of course Nintendo put a lot of effort into the rest of the controller too! temala The trademark Nintendo D-pad. It has served us well enough for over a decade on the NES and Super NES. Eight-directional for use with standard action games. SATICI C-buttons. Used to control the viewpoint/ perspective most prominent examples being Mario 64 and Pilot Wings 64. z Trigger. Situated beneath the centre handle, falling conveniently beneath the forefinger. Adds an extra dimension to Mario 64, and works great in Turok! 3D Stick. Key to making N64 games stand apart in terms of gameplay as well as looks. True enough the precision offered by this analogue stick makes the world of difference in the few N64 games which use it well. NINTENDO 64: UK LAUNCH CONTROLLER PACK BORDERLINE DECISION Similar to how the PlayStation Memory Card works, the Controller Pack allows players to store game play information and transfer it to another system. For example in Wave Race the settings of a custom machine can be taken to a friend's house for a two-player challenge. With Mario Kart, ghost data of an especially fast lap time can be inserted into a rival's controller for them to challenge. This information is in addition to the gameplay data stored on individual copies of games unfortunately you can't transfer all the cartridge info onto a controller pack. WE ARE THE CONTROLLER BROS Those of you accustomed to playing British consoles are familiar, and in fact quite used, to playing games under the PAL format. Usually this entails playing slightly 'inferior versions of Japanese/ American originals which suffer from a 17% loss of speed and black borders top and bottom of the screen. In the run up to March 1st, Nintendo had sent over 10 PAL N64 systems to the UK for evaluation, running a copy of Mario 64. The game does have slight borders, but is running up to speed. Unfortunately NOBODY in the UK has seen versions of Shadows, Pilot Wings, or Wave Race in action. Let's hope they've all been optimised too. You'll be pleased to know that the cool range of custom controllers are available from day one. It's worth having an extra in the bag for Wave Race 64. and Killer Instinct Gold. After that, however, it's quite a long wait until Mario Kart 64 the real reason for excessive controller collections. puse 00 17 02 GAMES AVAILABLE AT LAUNCH 60 Mario 64 Price: .99 Here's where Nintendo's critics like to have their fun. N64 games are priced in the region of -60. For the biggest games the recommended price is .99 (Mario 64, and Shadows of the Empire). Slightly less prominent titles such as Pilot Wings 64 are suggested at .99. While THE Games fully expect that individual retailers will affect their own discount of around a fiver or so, the official standpoint won't change for some considerable time.

"computer video games * NINTENDO 64 3D ACTION GAME BY NINTENDO  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE CARTRIDGE + BATTERY BACK-UP  RELEASED BY THE GAMES TEL: 01703 653 377 MARCH RELEASE || 1 PLAYER HINTENDO 64 The best video game ever. The best video game \"ever\"? The best video game ever! Let there be no doubt about it. Or else argue among yourselves! SUPER GA t some point in time, somewhere along the line, it had to happen. The Best Video Game Ever is a hefty title to throw around, and not an easy one to maintain at that. But Super Mario 64 imprints players with such a feeling of elation that magazine journalists the world over responded with the same voice. Back in June 1996 we couldn't believe what Nintendo had produced. Super Mario 64 surely was IS the The Best Video Game Ever. When it begins you can scarcely believe your eyes. After about twenty hours of solid play the tasks required of Mario still carry an aura of genius about them. That the game has an ending is just about the only disappointing element there is to it. If ever a game is capable of making money no object, Super Mario 64 is it. MARIO EUR NINTENDO 64: SUPER MARIO 64 AMBASSADOR FOR THE NEW SCHOOL OF COOL THROUGH THE EYES OF A CLOUD PILOT The world of Super Mario 64 is viewed through the lens of a floating camera, handled by a famous Super Mario character, Lakitu. He's the circuit steward from Super Mario Kart, also known for dropping Spikeys from his fluffy pedestal. As Mario explores, Lakitu trails a short distance behind, and can be positioned by the player to get the best view of the scene by pressing the yellow 'C' buttons. Each time you play Super Mario 64 it offers a new and exciting experience. Even after the so-called 'end' there is fun to be had experimenting in Mario's new virtual universe. There are 120 set tasks to complete, spanning 15 miniature 'Worlds'. The routes taken, and the order they are completed in, depends on the playerthe freedom in Super Mario 64 is its most magical feature. How you see, how you think, and consequently how you feel when playing SM64 is radically different to anything before. The top C Button allows players to sneek up right up close to Mario's head, and take a good look around. You get about 270° vision. To view the action from the right, tap the Right C Button. The more times you tap the button, the further around Lakitu goes. There is a limit though. REVIEW Likewise for the Left C Button. It's possible to imitate the 2D style of traditional Mario with the Left and Right C Buttons. But why do that, eh? Pressing the bottom C Button creates more distance between Mario and Lakitu. This presents broader view of the scene making problem solving easier. Things have progressed quite a way from Super Mario World on the Super NES. In that game players may look slightly ahead or behind Mario using the shoulder buttons. Who would have thought Super Mario 64 would have so much to offer. Players aren't just presented with a pretty picture to admire in this game, you enter it alongside Mario. It really seems as though you are there! 56 "

The cannon can be directed through a variety of angles. 1 A rather more advanced tehnique used to attain some awkward areas: floating on air! Mario is taking a shortcut here. Bounce off the walls to reach high-up places! To be honest, we messed it up a bit here! Oops. CONTROL FREAK Freak? You will do when you first experience the depth of control players have over Mario. Using the analogue '3D stick, Mario is enabled to move around in any direction at any pace. In conjunction with the Z Trigger, plus the Blue and Green action buttons, Mario is capable of some really impressive acrobatics too! These are just some of the cool new techniques Mario can muster. REVIEWER NINTENDO 64: SUPER MARIO 64 Metal Smash open the green box to retrieve the Metal hat which transfroms Mario into a heavy metal warrior! The extra weight allows him to explore beneath the water. Transparent Blue boxes hold the cap which makes Mario almost invisible. In this state he is able to pass through walls as though he were a ghost. Spook! Mario 64 is better than fantastic. It's more than awesome. There aren't really any words left, which haven't been used a million times, to convey the sensational event represented by Mario 64. And after I'm done spouting all that poetic stuffiness, all I really want people to do is lead Mario from beginning to end of this special game. Because if you don't, you're missing out on taking a very large step into another dimension of video gaming. To the casual observer, this could be an amazing CG demonstration only there's somebody in control of the action! For players who think they have seen and done everything the video games industry can throw at them, Mario 64 is a revelation. Hence the special award, and don't you forget it. Simple enough for the completely inexperienced to be overjoyed playing, and complex enough to tax the keenest 'professional', there isn't a more perfectly accessible game than this. Rewards are plenty, and expertly implimented, but the one which remains constant is simply holding the controller and taking part. The 'must have' game of the decade. PAUL DAVIES Wings A revelation in Super Mario World the ablity to fly. This time Mario has complete freedom of the skies, using cannons to power him higher, faster. UCH FIVE-1 RATING  MIG HATS FOR CATS * * * * Aside from giving the world countless heroes who jump on villains' heads for a living, Mario is also famed for wearing some pretty bizarre costumes. While Mario 64 doesn't go overboard in this area, these three very special hats provide no end of entertainment! From the opening sequence to the final bout with Bowser, and beyond in pursuit of every last star, Mario 64 convinces that this is the best video game ever made. "

There's the occasion when you hover above a pothole before braving your descent to the unknown. Flying through the Grand Canyon with only the moonlight to guide you is exhilarating too and you're expected to score perfect hits on a series of targets too! Most breathtaking of all early on at least is a hang-glider trip down the side of a mountain ravine. In fact it seems odd that Pilot Wings 64 is considered alongside other video games at all.

Probably you're expecting to shoot lots of things have dog-fights? Bomb air fields? Loop the loop for stunt points, that type of thing? Well there are games like this planned further down the line for N64, but for the meanwhile Pilot Wings 64 takes a more laid back approach. Which isn't to say it's any less exciting, rather the skills are characteristically delicate, and the overall approach is much more open. As this is one of the first N64 games, it seems the experience Nintendo and Paradigm want players to enjoy the most is the appreciation of amazing detail of convincing landscapes through a variety of aerial transportation The Vehicles Pilot Wings 64 is a joint creation between Nintendo and Paradigm. The latter are professionals in the field of motion simulation. Combining Nintendo's knowledge of video games with Paradigm's extensive research into real-life physics, the end result is a worthy sequel to the Super NES classic. So when you're taking to the skies, you know that the tasks ahead aren't just going to be fun, they're Scientifically accurate too. This is a great example of how owning the bare bones of a Silicon Graphics Reality Engine in the home could start to revolutionise the way we play games. Here's the basic three vehicles provided to enable some thrilling times around and about the four fictitious islands in Pilot Wings 64. Hang Glider It's just you and the elements out there. Success in hang glider missions is often associated with the careful management of air thermals those upward currents of air used by birds to maintain height. Precision landing is also extremely tricky. REVIEW Rocket Belt So long as you're topped up with fuel, the Rocket Belt can take you anywhere you'd like to go. Accurate landing capabilities, and smart manoeuvrability overall warrant more complicated take off and landing exercises for this piece of equipment. Gyrocopter Like piloting a radio-controlled version of the real thing with rudder shifting, and rotors buzzing authentically as you power along.

After that you may pull on a pair of Jumble Hoppers (Mario Bros Movie boots), Become a Human Cannon Ball (a lot of fun), or go Sky Diving (that's parachuting!). A quicker solution is to locate the stars one on each island which free the birdman.. 1043 00 1746 If you expect Pilot Wings 64 to lead you from A to B, delivering Hollywood drama along the way, prepare for a let down. However if you're someone who finds reward in perfecting not 'struggling through just about' -ingenious though quite separate tasks, Pilot Wings 64 is an opportunity too good to miss. I love the high speed thrills of Rage Racer on PlayStation, but I'm equally awestruck by many of the situations in PW64. The sheer scale of the mountains, snow-covered or shrouded in mist, create an awesome atmosphere as your little craft struggles against powerful winds to clear the round. Silence as you hang glide over the thermals, taking time out to appreciate the distant view is something else too. Sometimes the visuals look close to photo realistic! As the control is so precise, the gameplay is never frustrating, though it requires patience. The only weird aspect of PW64 is that everything feels so set apart. There are the events, and players may attempt them. There's no real reason other than it's fun to try. Not the kind of thing to keep you glued to the N64 for hours on end, but a very special kind of experience when it's up and running. PAUL DAVIES 2191. SED LEVES 1 Sky Diving.

Now, with the Jedi teachings contained in this review, YOU are the master! 25 Health 54 laser STAR WARS. ith the whole Star Wars bit in the ascendant, and the re-edited Star Wars movies hitting the cinemas over Easter, Nintendo could hardly have chosen a better title to complete the N64 launch line-up than Shadows of the Empire. This multi-stage 3D game fits into the plot of the new series of Star Wars novels which follow the adventures of Dash Rendar, a gun-for-hire who gets embroiled in a criminal overlord's plot to eliminate key members of the Rebel Alliance and the Empire. Put yourself in Rendar's spaceshoes and if The Force is with you, maybe you will prevail against the Dark Side! SHALOWSHEEMPIRE Who's gonna fly it, kid? Star Wars Stars Though you're not playing as one of the stars of the movies, they do feature in the game. Dash Rendar is an old pal of Han Solo's, and it's when he meets Solo on Hoth that he gets involved in this whole business. Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia are the two Rebel opera tives who are under threat from the criminal overlord, so Rendar is constantly trying to protect them or rescue them from sinister forces certain well-known bounty hunters, for example. Every Star Wars fan's dream is being able to fly around in the cool spacecraft from the movies, blasting the evil out of the galaxy. Shadows of the Empire panders to such fantasies, with stages that allow the player to take the controls of a Snowspeeder, a Swoop (something like the speeder bikes seen in Return of the Jedi) and Dash Rendar's modified Corellian freighter, the Outrider. NINTENDO 64: SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE Yeah... I see you still fly the Outrider. I hear she's almost as fast as the falcon now. Yes, but who's pulling Jabba's strings?

"Stay sharp, kid! computer video games At certain points in the game Rendar hands control of the Outrider to his co-pilot droid, Leebo, so that he can dive into the freighter's laser turret. Using the analogue pad, line up your sights on TIE Fighters, TIE Bombers or Star Vipers and blast away with dual or quad laser cannons before they can attack. The Outrider also has a homing-missile launcher, though it's slow to reload so you need to save those shots for special occasions. 100 NINTENDO Health The Hoth base has been abandoned, but there are still plenty of Imperial Snowtroopers wandering about, as well as angry Wampas!

I can't deny that I really enjoyed this. Some of the stages are truly gob-smacking: the Snowspeeder section is, to all intents and purposes, real, and flying through the canyons of Gall Spaceport on your jetpack, then coming face to face with Boba Fett is stupendous! When the game first came in some onlookers scoffed at the junkyard stage \"It's got a mine cart level!\" they mocked but when you're actually playing, you become completely involved in the 3D-ness of it all and it takes on all the thrills of a perilous rollercoaster ride! If I have to be completely objective about it, I must admit that a lot of the entertainment comes from the fact that the game is set in the Star Wars universe, with Star Wars characters, locations, spacecraft and weapons. If the Stormtroopers were Space Ninjas or Lord Ronko's Shadow Legion it wouldn't be the same and I would be more inclined to pick faults with the simplistic Doom-style stages. Having said all that, when I get my official N64 this, not Mario, will be the game I buy with it. 1 A sewer complex in Imperial City on Coruscant. Swim through the green slime if you must, but beware the tentacled Dianoga! 100 cal Laser 1 The crimelord's palace on Coruscant is swarming with assassin droids. Getting through the giant elevator mechanism is no picnic either. PAUL DAVIES Find the controls to extend the bridge! FEATRE  RATING Much of Shadows of the Empire is played out in Doom-style 3-D missions. Rendar has to explore an enemy installation, while avoiding or blasting Imperial troops, hostile droids and even hungry monsters! Along the way he has to solve a few minor door-opening, lift-activating, bridge-lowering puzzles, and keep an eye open for ammunition and new weapons. These upgrade his standard blaster to shoot homing rockets or stun shots. No light sabres, alas, but then Rendar isn't a Jedi, so he wouldn't have a licence for such a weapon. Not the perfect Star Wars game, but still very impressive. Unmissable for fans of the movies, 61 "


"computer Video games IN NINTENDO 64 R NINTENDO 64 You've got your Nintendo 64 well, almost. Now you need to make that mile-long wants list of games for the coming year. That list starts here. yourself with this coming KILLER INSTINCT BLAST CORPS GOLD FIGHTING 3D SMASH 'EM UP 1 PLAYER BY: RARE UK RELEASE: JUNE 97 1-2 PLAYER BY: RARE UK RELEASE: MAY 97 nly a few games to concern yourself with this coming month. But pretty soon the Nintendo 64 action is set to hot up. Nintendo themselves have some MAJOR titles lined up for 1997, most of which we've all seen something of though there are still some surprises in store. Third party development is healthy too, with a surprising number of the better titles coming from the US and UK. As it's still early days distributors THE Games can't confirm a great deal, but this is the batch of games they feel confident we'll be playing before the year is out. As clear a demonstration as any that N64 CAN produce an arcade game accurately and then some. This is essentially Killer Instinct 2 with a bundle of extra options and character enhancements. All that's missing is animation frames, but they're not drastic. One of the coolest new features is a variation of the Super NES KI Training Mode, which helps players through some of the longest and most outrageous combos in fight game history. We're looking forward to this demolish 'em up, it must be said as the regular visual updates we've been receiving show Blast Corps to be a real graphics bonanza. Like all the best games the concept is simple. A truck loaded with a nuclear reactor is out of control, if it makes contact with anything it will explode. Your job is to clear the : way of EVERYTHING and make a safe path until . engineers can solve the problem. So it's a demolition spree with a major kick being the variety of vehicles involved.

This is a one or two player jet-ski race game, in which riders struggle to maintain speed across treacherous waters. That's not to say that the surface is always choppy, sometimes it's calm but there are obstacles to negotiate. For example in the freezing Cool Wave course there are ice-bergs to contend with, on Milky Lake (clear as glass) wooden posts form robust slalom gates. The feeling of buoyancy is simply incredible, and con. trol over the skis feels very realistic almost as though you expect the sea spray to splash your face while playing! Though the one-player Tournament mode is easily beaten, Score Attack in which you perform a range of stunts presents a fun extra challenge. Two player battles, of course, add to the long-term appeal. Not the best Nintendo 64 game that exists. However there are a fair number of players who view Cruis'n as one of the greatest video games that has ever been. N64 Cruis'n mimics its arcade parent almost perfectly. Some of the gratuitous violence has been removed, that's all. Control utilises the 3D stick, and works well. TWOplayer mode is horizontal split-screen. There's a loss of detail here but that's all by the way. Cruis'n USA will be available to all fans soon. Hold onto your Tux Goldeneye from Rare promises to be a Turokstyle adventure shoot 'em up, only broken down into specific missions. Enemies, when shot, react in different ways depending on where they are hit. Shoot them in the leg and they hobble around. Blast them in the head and they die instantly.

Still there is some impressive light-sourcing which is especially noticeable in the darker areas, where the flare of an energy bolt illuminates the walls. Should be the best console Doom ever. SOCCER 1-4 PLAYER BY: ELECTRONIC ARTS UK RELEASE: APRIL 97 NINTENDO PLAYER SELECT Opinions are mixed over whether this is the saviour of all video games certainly CVG is disappointed with a few aspects. However postings on the Internet, and a number of phone calls we have received give Mario Kart 64 the big thumbs up. The oneplayer Grand Prix is a breeze, and the CPU Karts are cheats, but this has always been the case in Super Mario Kart. The main action is with the multi-player games. Versus races are the best place to decide who has the advantage with the precise handling. Battle Mode is definitely better than ever, as the new 3D environments provide many opportunities for cunning. It's also a great laugh, which became a major asset with the Super NES original. When you're smiling... Judging from FIFA 97 on the PlayStation which is offensive to say the least FIFA 97 on the N64 can only do better. Details are scarce, but expect a similar formula to what has gone before. The controls should be analogue-based as with ISS, and we are almost certain to benefit from multiple camera angles. Details should surface soon.

Turok utilises just about every button on the N64 controller, and vast quantities of skill is required to stay alive.

One of the most exciting features promised is a four-player 'dog-fight', with four ARWINGS battling it out in the skies. So long as there are power-ups involved here that option could be spectacular fun. In the one-player game the new groundbased vehicle is the element which has fans talking. As well as learning how to pilot the new ARWING, players will have to master the controls of this tank-like craft to get by. So, looks spectacular with some awesome Boss characters to contend with. We're looking for a challenge Nintendo, let this be the one! Another Turok/ Doom/ Goldenye game perhaps? Actually no. Mission Impossible is closer to Delphine's Fade to Black in style, where all the action centres around problem solving. No doubt the game will have a very structured feel, with very definite goals to be met. Early stills show this game to look very slick however. INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTAR SOCCER 64 SOCCER 1-4 PLAYER BY: KONAMI UK RELEASE: MAY 97 3RD PARTY DOOM 64 We'll have a full report on this for you next issue, as CVG has been invited to visit Konami's R&D in Japan. Any other details we have so far are laid out in full on pages 94-95. Current feeling here is that ISS could be 'the one' for N64, the analogue control is good and there are loads of cool moves possible.

This sounds like the perfect game! guana, the programming team behind Turok, could easily have taken a basic Doom copy, stuck in some dinosaurs, and released it there would be plenty of people willing to buy it simply for the chance to blow up dinos. But they haven't gone for the easy option. Instead, they've created a real adventure which spans across jungles, caves, ancient cities, and eventually lets players discover where some of the strange alien creatures are coming from. If you're not excited about Turok yet, you should read the next six pages carefully and start saving your cash. Believe us it's very special indeed. DINOSAUR HUNTER HIGHES TEST CU CVG RECU 10020 DINOSAUR HENTER TUROK'S TASKSI THE HUBI Once you've collected the three keystones required to open a level, find the exit to your current area and return to the main hub section. Simply put the three keys for any level into the right places, and the portal to the new area opens up! This section is also worth revisiting every now and then, to take advantage of the handy save game point. Turok isn't just another «Doom clone\" where the idea is simply to blow the enemies away, pressing switches and picking up keycards to open doors along the way. The whole game here is based on exploration, with lots of careful creeping around, performing death-defying jumps and using forward planning. You start on level 1, with the object of finding the keys to open up more levels. There are six to be found on level 1 3 for level 2, and 3 for level 3 though you can leave and re-enter the level at any time. For example, you may collect all the level 2 keys and decide to have a go there before continuing your search for all the level 3 keys, breaking the game up a bit and letting players choose in which order they want to tackle the levels. LOCATT THE HUB ROINS TO OPED LUFT PORTALS FIND THE TRIANGULAR KEYSTONE SI The keys are the main object of your quest, and as such aren't just lying around on the floor waiting to be collected. The stone pedestals with the sparkling, magical keys are usually well-hidden and are spread all around the level, meaning that you need to cover lots of ground to get to each one. While it may only take you half an hour to find the exit to a level, it can take many more hours before you discover the locations of all the keys. REVIEW C OOHI SHUT, THAT DOORI 2 KEY When Turok picks up a key, the view changes to show him holding it up to the heavens in celebration! It looks like he's drinking from it. Here's what you're looking for the magical keystones. They're placed in hard-to-reach places, and often require lots of thought and skill to reach. 64 "


"computer video games PS WHAT THE BUTTONS DO PO MASTER NEW SKILLSI The Z trigger is used to fire the current weapon. With the arrows, holding the trigger longer makes them fly further through the air. The control system of Turok was something which we were all a bit concerned about when we first heard about the game. Quake on the PC plays brilliantly when using a mouse and keyboard, but how could the Nintendo 64's controller be used to get the same degree of control? Thankfully. Turok is a delight to control, though it takes a bit of getting used to. There's even an option to have left-handed control which swaps the cross-key and C button controls. NINTENDO The R shoulder button makes Turok jump. Holding the button longer allows him to jump further. To help new players get used to Turok's controls, Iguana have included a Training Mode. It starts off very easy, with simple tasks like swimming across a small pool of water, but gets harder through the three stages to include target practice, tricky jumps and walking across thin logs. Training is only really useful once, but you can always try the Time Attack, where you're challenged to complete all three training stages as quickly as possible. Nintendo TIHE The L shoulder button turns on the map display. It appears over the game screen and builds up as you move through the level. BEST TIME 04:17 The yellow C buttons are used to move Turok forwards, backwards, and to sidestep left and right. A double-tap of either side button makes Turok hop quickly in that direction handy for dodging attacks at the last minute! 100 Pressing any direction on the cross-key switches Turok between run and walk mode. An icon appears to show which mode you're currently in. The 3D stick turns Turok left and right, and moves his head up and down. The analogue control means that it's possible to aim precisely and to turn smoothly. The A and B buttons cycle through Turok's current choice of weapons. Pictures of the weapons appear in the bottom-left corner as you switch between them. In Time Attack mode, your best time is shown at the top of the screen. IAM TUROKI PREHISTORIC AUTOMAPI At the start of the game, we see the Iguana from the programming team's logo dodge arrows and axes, then see Turok himself pulling back his bow. He turns to face the screen and fires a Tek Arrow right into the letter \"O\" of the game logo! Boom! While the map in Turok may seem fairly useless during the first few levels, later on it becomes very handy indeed! Pressing the L shoulder button calls up a line-drawing overlay of the level which builds up as you work through the various areas. Not only does it let you get a better idea of where you've been and where you should be going, but it also shows the location of enemies in the immediate area. When you've got three or four bad guys attacking you at once, it's very useful to know exactly where they are around you. There are also some sections which are easier to spot on the map than during the actual game, and some jumps which are easier to judge with the map on-screen. And if you're really sneaky, you can use the yellow marker on the map which represents Turok himself as a crosshair! DIAGONAL JUMP PRESS THEMP BUTTON WHILE HOLDING DOWN THE PORARD AND STRAP BUTTONS TO PERLORMA DIAGONAL LEAP. USE THE CONTROL STICK TO TURD ID THE AIR. DINOSAUR HUNTER (FLL DODE YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY QUITE SKILLED, GOOD HUNTING ENTERTAINMENT OBODDO OOOOOO O DOOED OOOOOO Finish the training for this message. ENTERTAINMENT BONUS TIME STARTIS During the game, secret blue portals open up when certain points are triggered. These portals only stay open for a few seconds, so quick reactions are needed to jump through before they disappear. When one is entered, you are transported to what can only be described as a bonus stage, where you get the chance to collect large amounts of ammunition, gems and health by completing tricky sections. Some of these bonus stages require you to hop from moving pillar to moving pillar, avoiding the lava below in order to pick up pink gems; while others throw you into near-complete darkness with a series of VERY tricky jumps to make! REVIEW 1 The bonus stages have a very different style to the rest of the game, with lightning crackling above and below, ready to teleport you back to the start of the stage should you mess up! 1 Hang around long enough and one of these secret portals might open' up. Jump into it quickly, before it disappears! 32 120 3 65 "


"YOU WANNA SHOOT A PEEG? computer video games As an added bonus, there's the occasional wild animal bounding around the level. These don't do any damage to you, but you can still shoot them not simply for the fun of it, but to get free health points! Each time one of these animals is shot, they drop a 2-point health bonus! To save the game from being completely sick, the wild animals vanish after a few shots, meaning NINTENDO 64 that you can't just blow Bambi's brains up the wall for the fun of it! LITTLE TRIANGLES OF GOLDI Aaagh. Where's his head gone? That's SICK! All the way through each of the levels are these triangular gems, which Turok can collect in order to get extra lives. Gold gems are worth 1, while special pink gems are worth 10. Collect a total of 100 gems and Turok yells \"I am TUROK!\" and gets an extra life! While you may be tempted to forget about picking up every gem you come across, towards the end of the game you'll be pleased you did, as every extra life becomes priceless! # 730 ton Look a pig! Squeal for me And there's a baby deer! piggy! Gimme free health points! Blam! Bonus energy! BY THE POWER OF MY ANCESTORSI When poor old Turok falls off a cliff, drowns, or is simply killed by one of the many enemies, he is brought back to life by the ancient spirits of his tribe. With a groan he's picked up, warped back to the last restart point and resurrected with his favourite cry of \"I am TUROK!\". 100oooh. A collection of pink gems up on the ledge. It's worth taking some time to figure out how to get up there. The explosive shotgun shells are brilliant fun! is! 106 10 DINOSAUR HUNTER These pillars represent a checkpoint. Pass between them and you'll restart from this point should you happen to die. UGHI THAT'S SICKI As we said in our New Games section last month, Turok's got quite a bit of blood and guts in it. In fact, it's been given a rating of 15+ (it's got a 17+ in the USA) and we're not particularly surprised! Not only are there realistic splats of blood when someone's shot, but you can also blow blood up the walls, spray it on the floor, or even make dying enemies squirm around on the ground! There's an option to change the colour of the blood to green, or even to turn it off completely, should you ever feel ill. After dying, Turok is magically brought to life! 136 11/20 Shooting an enemy in the neck makes them stagger around, groaning with blood squirting everywhere until they die! Blasting someone in the gut makes them drop to their knees, then writhe around in agony on the floor! REVIEW 13910 Boom! Blood splats up the walls whenever you shoot someone! While we shouldn't laugh really, it's very funny to watch a grenade explosion send bad guys flying with a trail of blood behind them! Level 6 is the perfect place to try it out it's laughter all the way! 66 "


"DIY WEAPONSI THE PILLAR OF SAVEBOK GOD OF SAVE GAMESI games As an added bonus task, there's a piece of the \"Chronosceptre\" hidden in every level for you to discover. These are hidden further away than the keystones, and require quite a bit of exploration in order to find all of the pieces but get them all and your effort is made worthwhile... NINTENDO One of the most precious things to find in a level is a save game pillar. They don't come very often, and with levels as big as these, they're very welcome indeed! Turok is the first Nintendo 64 game where it's essential to own a controller memory pak. Okay, so Wave Race lets you copy your best times onto the controller pak, but with Turok it's the only way you can save your adventure. Each controller pak will hold 5 separate Turok save games, each one of these containing information on exactly which enemies have been killed in every level, which items have been collected and which sections have been explored, meaning that everything stays just as you leave it when you turn your N64 off. 108 CONTROLLER PAK SHOW ALL Getting to this hidden Chronosceptre piece in the Catacombs requires quite a bit of crawling... Here's a save game You finally have a senpillar. As soon as you find sible reason to buy a one, rush up to it and save controller memory pak your game it may be the to save your Turok only chance you get for adventures! Buy ten of the next few hours! them for more saves! NEXT EVENT: THE WALLIK While Turok can do just about everything that every other character in a 3D action game can do, he can also climb walls! In the jungle sections, some walls have green vines growing up them which Turok can climb, while some building walls have stones poking out which can be used to clamber up. While climbing walls Turok can look around or even jump off, but he can't shoot, meaning that he's a bit of an easy target. You need to get in the habit of looking carefully for walls with slightly different textures to the rest in order to find those which can be climbed. DINOSAUR HUNTER The game gets even more impressive with the secret weapon during the last sections. Just look at that! 1321500 POWER PICK-UPS On top of the common 2-point health bonuses, there are some extra power-ups which can be collected. For example, a green plus symbol gives you Ultra Health an extra 100 health points on top of whatever you already have, and a backpack will let Turok carry more ammunition than usual. 1 See those bricks poking out slightly? Well, you can climb up them to get to new sections at the top! 1 A gold plus sign gives you full health when you pick it up. The shield makes Turok invincible, causes the sky to flash different colours, and even slows all the enemies down completely for around 20 seconds! I USED TO BE IN THE VILLAGE PEOPLE REVIEW 1 This is the \"Spiritual Invincibility\" shield... Voor This secret cloud walkway leads you to the grenade launcher!  "


"computer video games WICKED WEAPONRY One of the most impressive features of Turok is the enormous selection of weapons! You start with a basic knife, and a bow and arrow, but end, up with guns of nuclear missile proportions! Here's a brief run-down of how each one works. NINTENDO 64 PULSE RIFLE While each shot isn't amazingly powerful, it's very quick to fire and you can hold large amounts of ammunition. PISTOL SHOTGUN AUTO-SHOTGUN Okay for the start of the game, but Excellent to watch in action, and A rapid-fire version of the shotgun, once you pick up the rifle it becomes powerful as well, it's just very slow and one of the most useful weapons. pretty redundant. Unless you're tryto reload. Explosive shells are I t can get through your collection of ing to conserve ammunition, that is. mega-powerful, but hard to come by. shells very quickly, though. KNIFE GRENADE LAUNCHER QUAD ROCKET LAUNCHER AUTO-RIFLE Not much use against big enemies, Not a safe weapon to use at close Just as you'd expect, this fires four Fires three bullets every time you but is the only weapon you can use range, as the blast is very powerful, missiles which spiral around each press the trigger, but is useful when underwater. Very handy for but excellent for long-distance other towards their target. Powerful against most enemies. You can hold taking out the annoying giant shots. Learning the way that the and very nice to look at, this is well up to 200 bullets at a time with a beetles and dragonflies which go grenades fly and bounce off walls is worth tracking down. backpack. straight for your face. an essential exercise. CHILL MINAH MAVSONIS MINIGUN BOW& ARROW ALIEN WEAPON The barrel spins at very high speeds, Not much use on its own, but with Just like the gun in the film Eraser, and sprays HUGE amounts of ammo the excellent Tek Arrows it becomes this fires a shot which causes a big at whatever's in front of you! Before one of the best weapons. The Tek green explosion and leaves rings of you know it, you can literally have Arrows explode on contact and dust in the air. Though it looks used up hundreds of shots. cause large amounts of damage. great, it's not all that powerful. FUSION CANNON When fired, this rumbles then fires a glowing red ball. When it touches something, an enormous explosion rips through the level, destroying enemies and bringing down trees! PARTICLE GUN By holding the trigger, you can charge the weapon up to fire, a coloured beam at enemies. When hit enough they freeze solid, turn black, flicker with electricity, then explode! EXTRA WEAPONI REVIEW CHRONOSCEPTRE Once you've collected all the pieces of the Chronosceptre, you get to use the best weapon around. Again, you need to hold the trigger to charge it slightly, but it fires a direct beam which causes an awesome blue explosion! It's just goddamn amazing! TUROK: OLYMPIC SWIMMER The swimming sections in Turok are quite common, and are very impressive. Seeing as Turok is a native American indian, he's very good at holding his breath, and can last a long time before running out of puff. In some parts, it's useful to swim just below the surface of the water, looking up at enemies on land trying to shoot you no matter how hard they try, they just can't get you! You need to surface to attack, unless you want to use your knife on them! 68 To reach the treetop village, you need to swim inside a hollow tree trunk! "


"MUCH MORE THAN PLAN OLD DINOSAURSI computer video games You might expect all of the enemies in Turok: Dinosaur Hunter to be dinosaurs, but that's not always the case. Here's a selection of some of the more common bad guys you need to deal with. NINTENDO 64 COMMENT 106 110 The magic men are pretty nasty. They can fire flaming skulls, homing lightning, and can even teleport using magic pink dust! Big green monsters like Looking a bit like the this jump from above, or Genestealers from Space Hulk, even smash through walls to these aliens shoot lasers at get to you! Thankfully, you'll you. When killed, they fall on often find Tek Arrows nearby! their backs while still shooting! It's time for the gaming world to take Acclaim very seriously. If this is anything, to go by, they could be at the start of an incredible new era. For a little while the control in Turok takes a while getting used to. After that the experience just becomes amazing! Like the best moments in N64 games, Turok gives a strong feeling of being there. You WILL be scared. You WILL have the heartbeat of someone who just sprinted 100 metres. You WILL NOT want to put the controller down once you've started. Sure Acclaim have used a couple of tricks to mask the pop-up. Who cares. If Mario 64 didn't exist I'd buy an N64 just to play this! PAUL DAVIES What's this? A lizard-dino with guns mounted on its back? What's going on here? We're not telling! These baddies have very powerful red plasma rifles, and take lots of hits to kill. Their friends have smaller guns, knives, or sometimes grenades which they throw long distances. Natives armed with pikes aren't too much trouble. You can hear their footsteps, so just turn and blow them away! Some use blow-pipes and are amazingly accurate with their shots. Take them out as soon as possible. REVIEWER DINOSAUR HUNTER REGENERATION! These 'raptor-like dinos are common, and don't cause too many problems unless they get very close. 1 If you hang around in the same area for too long, dead enemies start to regenerate! With a beam of light from the Heavens, they're resurrected! OHMYGODI LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THATI I'll admit that I was sceptical about Turok, even after I'd played an early version last year. While I'm a big fan of Doom/Quake style games, I don't like rip-offs which is what Turok looked like it was going to be. Thankfully, while it's similar to Quake in a way, it's definitely not a copy in fact, it requires a completely different set of skills to play, and is based far more on exploration than blasting. The graphics are brilliantly smooth, and look fantastic, but are slightly spoiled by the very close pop-up point, though the fog effects often add to the atmosphere. The weapons not only look spectacular, but each has a specific use, meaning that you don't just have a load of guns for the sake of it. The sound is also brilliant, with music which changes depending on your location (the water music's the best) and some great explosion noises. Controlling Turok takes a bit of getting used to, but after a while becomes second nature and you'll need it with some of the jumps you're required to do! It's also nice to see one of the first Nintendo 64 games which does something which the CD-based machines can't do, with levels far, far bigger than in any other 3D shooting game ever. Turok is atmospheric, challenging, massive, fun, and very, very cleverly designed. Along with Super Mario 64, this is the best reason to buy a Nintendo 64. V TOMAS While we don't want to give too much away, there are a few bosses to beat in the game. You don't get one at the end of every level, but you occasionally need to take out a big baddie to get your hands on the last keystone in an area. MEIE NONEVE RATING RATING A completely engrossing and challenging 3D action game which everyone will love. You've finally got a second reason to buy that Nintendo 64. 159 1163  "

The only rule here is there are no rules! Iuture sports don't you just love them. Sure there are lots of bad ones on the market, but occasionally very rarely something great comes along. From the far off days of Ballblazer and Speedball 2, to the present of Wipeout 2097. These are the sports we wouldn't mind seeing become a reality. Psygnosis once-again enter this hotly contested arena with another vision of the future. Its name is Riot. THE HISTORY OF RIOT AIA E FUHT APIEN CN PTUL DRUIDE TOM GUIA HUNT BLR RUE In the late 21st century all modern sport as we know it has gone. Football, Basketball, Hockey and boxing have all vanished. Why? The answer is Riot. A game which incorporates all these other sports into the new crowd favourite. A no rules contest whose 'anything goes' action pleases everybody. Due to the action of Riot, the fans were quickly won over. Once the crowds of the old sports had disappeared, so did the sponsorship. Without that money coming in the athletes had no other choice, than to join the growing ranks of Riot players. RIOT MIKE NEUS.

The enhancements are ultimate accuracy in passing and immediate, however their effects shooting. ISAATASI ENITEN WELCOME TO MY WORLD Riot is a game that appeals to the whole world as each of the 16 teams come from a different part of the globe. All but one of the five continents is represented. The bigger cities have better teams including the London Royals, New York Knights and Moscow Maulers. The lesser teams offer more of a challenge, such as Liverpool Dockers and Tijuana Tyrants. Each team also has their own home court, each with its home team logo. This can play a major part in tournament or league matches, because of the advantage a home court provides. There are different types of court to look out for some are indoor arenas, others open air stadiums. $44 SEART ELEK CREC The pink flame nearest the camera is a power up thrown on the court by the fans. Well it's better than throwing bottles! K SEMMER IESKI Vipers verses the Knights. The Frankfurt Vipers court is an open air stadium. Bartelski has managed to run across the power up. Improving his health for 15 seconds. This lovely red pitch is the home court of the Berlin Breakers. It's an indoor arena. SEARTESKI RIOT REVIEWER LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK The amount of different angles to view the game is extensive. Even with three different heights of a blimp view! Also impressive is the replay feature, with which you can choose any angle and view your great plays again and again. A neat trick is the slight flicker you get when fast forward or rewind the replay. Wait a minute! They shouldn't have flicker in the future. They'll all be using DVD, surely! PAUSE Think of future sports, and you can conjure up great ideas of a sport you'd like to see become reality. Anti-grav racing for starters. Even looking in other places for inspiration, such as the comic 2000AD, I can remember great future sports in strips like Harlem Heroes and The Mean Arena. The problem with Riot is that it's not a million miles from sports we're used to. The main inspira, tion is basketball. Hmmm how many bas. ketball games have we seen over the years? And when a sport carries a name like Riot it should be all out ultra violence not softly punching other play. ers. Players should be given weapons; be able to dive tackle other players, and definitely have more fighting moves other than punch. The main problem with future sports are that they are some body else's ideas. You're always going to be able to think of your own perfect game. In this case Psygnosis fall slightly wide of the mark of what I'd call ideal. Alex4fa4T ALA The two larger grabs show the same action from different angles. As you can see there's a large variety to choose from. REVIEW FINAL RESULTS RATING 4) ) KTNET STEUN Speedball 2 was much better than the original. Perhaps a Riot 2? Come on Psygnosis, Riot is good but we know you can do better! Team CVG stomp on the opposition. We even save Ed and Jaime for late in the second half. Even with Mike slowing to a walking pace we keep a clean sheet! "

In the arcade game the enemy is a very mixed bunch indeed, ranging from teenage skater types all the way up to Mr Big, who here looks much more oriental than Hans Gruber ever was! You also have to fight sumo wrestlers, giant robots, firemen and scantily clad females. At the end of each level are the obligatory bosses, sometimes more than twice the size of McClane. Our favourite character is the blaxploitation female with huge afro. She should be given a game all of her own. How about it Sega? Between different stages of the game, McClane will need to enter different locations of the building. When doing this, rather than enjoy watching him running around corridors, Sega decided that these moments could also be included into the gameplay. Fast reactions is what it's all about. The screen will flash a message, instructing you to press a certain button. Do this at the correct moment and the move is declared successful. Miss the button press and you are branded a failure. Success wins you the upper hand you can knock out opponents and escape explosions. Failure usually means that you have to fight the enemies in the corridors, which you could have avoided altogether.

Little does Mr Big realise that the daughter of the president, is hiding in the desk at which he is seated. What chance does that little girl have? It's up to you to save her! I loved the original arcade version of Die Hard. Being on the ST-V board meant Saturn owners were going to get a perfect conversion. So that is what you get, apart from some very short loading times. However not every good arcade game makes a good home game. In the arcade Die Hard was very short and very easy to complete. Sega, to their credit, have made this version harder than the original. What they really should have done is add a few more levels, or perhaps even borrowed from Guardian Heroes and included a battle mode, Where you could be any character in the game. These would have increased the lastability a great deal. As it is Die Hard Arcade is enjoyable, and extremely playable. Though perhaps not something you're going to want to play in a few weeks time there's still a brilliant game here. If only it was twice the size. Alex 4UATALA FRESS SI REVIEW RATING If you liked the arcade original, this is a spot-on conversion. Unfortunately these arcade thrills probably won't last you very long. 75 "

DO THE VAMPIRE THING Shape shifting has got to be one of the coolest attributes a ghoul ever received, and Kain absolutely depends on it. In his ultimate form Kain may waver between six states: Vampire (his natural form): Wolf; Bat; Mist; Disguise, and Beguile.

But Sonic Team's signature is in here somewhere. early every classic game is being turned into 3D recently, and Sonic is no exception. The Mega Drive version of Sonic 3D came out last year, and did fairly well, with big levels, some of the most impressive graphics seen on the machine, and a new approach to Sonic the Hedgehog. This is the Saturn \"remix», with improved graphics, new music, and new Special Stages programmed by Sonic's real parents the Sonic Team! - Some Flickies need to be broken out of ice before being collected! RIMES 14 RINGS 56 0.5 mon P Domom Smash the blocks to find secret tunnels leading to hidden bonus areas! REALLY, REALLY SPECIAL! BONUS RING TIMER The new feature of the Special Stages are these points. Each one has a timer which counts down rapidly. When you hit one of these, you are awarded the number of rings shown on the timer. This means that by racing through the stages as quickly as possible, and hitting every speed-up, gets you more rings! 69 RINGS \"Why get Sonic 3D on the Saturn when I can buy it cheaper on the Mega Drive?\", we guess some of you are thinking. Good question. There's only really one reason, and that's to play the REAL Sonic Team section, the genuine article the amazing Special Stages! It's immediately noticeable that you're playing something different when you collect the 50 rings and take them to one of Sonic's friends, as the music, graphics and feel of the game changes to one very similar to the MD Sonic games! The idea of the special stages is identical to that of Sonic 2, where you run along a colourful trench, collecting enough rings to make it through each checkpoint along the way. At the end, a Chaos Emerald awaits. Here's one of the timers. Touch it now and you'll get an extra 13 rings for free. Avoid the bombs, or you'll lose a bunch of rings!  RIN RENGS 24 ALTOGETHER NOW! Knuckles or Tails will drop Sonic off at the start! At the end is one of the precious Chaos Emeralds. REVIEW (14/INCS 54/ MODO All of the music for Sonic 3D was written by Sega Europe's Richard Jacques, who also did a few tunes for Daytona USA: CCE and the Club Saturn CD.

"SPEEDY 3D SONIC! computer video games Mega Drive Sonic 3D had its own little rendered intro sequence, but obviously the Saturn version is far better. It shows Sonic zooming around letting Flicky friends out of their Badnik suits, then jumping through the warp ring! S ZONE DRONE 26 RINGS 70 There are six main zones to Sonic 3D, each of which is divided into two regular acts, plus one boss act. There's also an extra zone for expert players to find, and a second \"final\" boss! GREEN GROVE ZONE The regular starter level based on Sonic's original home stage, the Green Hill Zone. It's good for learning how Sonic controls, and has quite a few hidden sections. * RUSTY RUIN ZONE These amazing Special Stages make the game worth getting for big Sonic fans! Zone two is set in and around a deserted and overgrown palace, with rotating spike balls, steep slopes, and tricky jumps. You also need to spin on rotating panels to smash through some of the pillars. * MEDALLION MAN * SPRING STADIUM ZONE >> The rotating Sonic head icons dotted around the levels can be used to gain more continues. Collect every one you see, and you'll be awarded another continue when you get ten. To keep check on how many you've collected so far in the current level, simply pause the game and take a look at the map screen. The annoying springs and bumpers-style level which appears in every Sonic game. This one's even more annoying than usual, with sections which bounce you around like a pinball, then into lots of spikes! ABS cande DIAMOND DUST ZONE Even though this zone is annoying, with very slippery floors, it's still one of the most enjoyable. Sonic even gets frozen in a block of ice and pushed down a slide around the whole level! VOLCANO VALLEY ZONE  REVIEWER Though the stage is surrounded by lava, there aren't many places where you can fall in. There are lots of flame-throwing traps around, making the fire shield especially useful in this zone. GENE GADGET ZONE The final, futuristic stage has the usual collection of conveyor belts, fans, high-speed tubes, and difficult enemies. There are also sections where the floor is electrified when ever you tread on them. Just keep moving! As I've said loads of times before, I love all the \"real\" Mega Drive Sonic games, including Sonic CD. While Sonic 3D on Mega Drive worked fairly well, it didn't have the same sort of impact or feel as the previous games. The improved Saturn graphics look good in places, the new music's great, and there's no real problem with the way the game plays. But then you reach the Special Stages, where the game transforms into a piece of Sonic Team magic, with the perfect graphic style, excellent music, a cool-looking Sonic, and more fun than the whole rest of the game put together! This is the biggest reason for buying the game, and proves that the Sonic Team could still come out with a brilliant Saturn Sonic in the future. If Sega really wanted to release Mega Drive Sonic on Saturn, why not put all the original games on a CD with new music and improved Special Stages? While Sonic 3D is a good enough game on it's own, it's not what anyone wanted from the Saturn's first Sonic game. Therefore it's a real disappointment. NIGHTS is still the best Sonic game on the Saturn. 6D LOMAS BONUS ZONE! ALL-NEW MAP! As we've mentioned before, there's a new map feature in Saturn Sonic 3D. When you pause, the game you get to look at the stage layout and plan your next move, as well as seeing how many medals you've collected. Aledals: REVIEW Time: MOON 4:49 PANIC PUPPET ZONE RATING 60 500 This extra zone is a lot like the Gene Gadget, only dirtier. The second act is set around a giant Robotnik robot, and there are lots of Flickies sealed inside glass cases, waiting to be released by Sonic! While it's not bad, it's certainly not a real Sonic game. Only worth the money for the Special Stages. The map shows wandering Flickies. 79 "

T st 1 st 1 Four-player Battle mode is easily the best aspect of Mario Kart 64. 2nd isappointing. That's the sole, most significant word which says so much about Mario Kart 64. Brilliant eventually, maybe. But initially, and forever at the back of our minds, Mario Kart 64 is disappointing. First up is the CPU AI, which is almost embarassing. Rival Karts cheat in Super Mario Kart, it's true, skipping over red shells and taking corners at an impossible angle. In MK64 though the CPU is just plain unfair. I've raced the 150 cc GP using no special tactics, and been pipped at the post from a driver I left miles behind with a shell up his ass. So I tried power slides and timely speed boosts, and still the CPU clung to my Kart like it was superglued. In Nintendo's defense, it is possible to guarantee first place at a pinch, and I'm trying to fathom a reason why my Kart LAP 2/3 1 TIME 03'05\"49 sometimes gains a brief, uninitiated turn of speed. There may be undiscovered elements which could make all the difference to Grand Prix mode. Problem is, I doubt it. So to the multi-player games, which are quite brilliant. Even now the versus race and battle is attracting regular meetings in the CVG office. Three and up battles are unbridled brilliance. Three and up versus races are tricky (it's sometimes hard to see) but still cool. Personally I'm having a lot of fun with Time Attack, where I'm beginning to appreciate the clever circuit layouts. There is a chance Mario Kart 64 could become a classic in time, but the hit is far from instant. No custom victory tunes for each character, or victory poses on the podium. The title screen is a static render as opposed to the cheeky Super NES drive by. Mario Kart 64 is top quality but it should have been perfect.

Plus the number of tables is impressive six in all, each based around a different popular theme, with cool music and sound effects used to complement each table. It's just the ball.

Capcom unveiled Street Fighter III: New Generation to the gameplaying public in late December/early January in location tests in Tokyo Japan; Osaka, Japan; and Sunnyvale, California in the US. notes in Tokyo el mercados de los NEW GENERATION 35100 NECRO 2 I EXCLUSIVE STREET FIGHTER III REPORT Ryu and Ken are back, but if you have other favourites from SF II/ Alpha, you won't find them in SF III. In with the new. It's not another upgrade of SF II, or Alpha, or another 3D polygon EX spin-off, but the real deal. In the tradition of true Street Fighter, this game is hand-drawn, 2D, and created on Capcom's powerful, all-new 32-bit game hardware. Surprisingly, this iteration almost completely ignores the storylines of all past Street Fighters, tossing away all characters and plot elements save Ryu and Ken and their immediate backstories (no, don't look for any resolution to Charlie's fate, the Sagat/Ryu rivalry, the Akuma/Gouken/Goutetsu thing, or even old M. Bison). The other eight characters, appropriately dubbed the New Generation, are brand new and have absolutely no connections to any of the earlier versions. Capcom has apparently used previous SF Ils/Alphas as testing grounds for many gameplay features, some of which were retained in Ill, and many of which were discarded. And of course there are a few key new additions to gameplay, which could make or break the title. Will SF III reignite the Street Fighter mania which drove the series to the top in the early 90s? We'll take the closest look possible given the highly incomplete nature of the test version, and let you draw the conclusions. LIBWA NECROI I * Elena, a Capoeira master from Elena, journeys to the Siberian railroad to take on the Russian cyberpunk Necro. Ibuki and Necro are two of the finest from the New Generation. 5200 CPS III: CAPCOM'S NEW HARDWARE GENERATION ARCADE It's been 4 years since Capcom's 16-bit CPS II (which, for all intents and purposes, is only slightly more powerful than a SNES) was introduced in the arcades, and the new hardware has been long awaited. Allegedly more powerful than any other hardware on Earth at pushing 2D sprites, the CPS III gets its proper debut with SF III (although technically the first CPS Ill game was WarZard. a.k.a. Red Earth). According to Capcom, the hardware's capable of up to 64 colours per sprite (as opposed to CPS ll's 16), and up to 36,000 colours per background (whereas CPS Il could manage 256) an obviously dramatic increase in graphic capabilities. A wholly unique feature of the system is the inclusion of a CD-ROM drive (a first for arcade hardware) which loads the game into the 776 megabits of RAM. CPS III's main focus is 2D games, which in my opinion is a blessing. Aren't there more than enough companies doing polygon fighters?

Old school meets the new generation. Although graphics are never the most important judgment point of a good fighting game, in Street Fighter Ill's case they are certainly the initial defining quality. I still remember the first time I saw SF II moving; I was nearly speechless. No previous game's animation was even close! The first time saw SF Ill moving, I was nearly as floored as that special moment with SF II back in 1991. Nothing, nothing can prepare you for the smoothness of SF lil's animation, the detail of every animation frame, and the overall splendour of SF III's visual appeal. A minor example: in both SF II and Alpha, Ryu's \"Hadoken\" (Wave-Motion-Fist, or Fireball as it's more commonly known) attack is animated with 4 frames. In SF III, it's 14. Every movement is just indescribably smooth, closer now to a cartoon than ever before. Details such as ripples of garments, limbs which advance only a few pixels from one frame to the next, and the smallest changes in facial expressions make the difference. Some players preferred the more realistic, ultra detailed art style of SF II, while others like the more cartoony look of Alpha. SFIll adopts a style which compromises between the two looks, but with significantly improved detail, shading, and as mentioned way more frames. Just as stunning as the animation are the amazing backgrounds. The backgrounds have a richness of colour and detail, as well as a personality, wholly unrivalled in any other fighting game. Unbelievably, and for the first time in a Capcom game, there are multiple backgrounds for some characters! Some are merely retouched day/night versions, but others are completely different.

For instance, in the test version (and these things are always subject to change in the final), Ken can two-in-one a Shoryuken into a Shoryu Reppa. This looks very cool, and as long as the damage isn't too high, shouldn't be a disruptive addition to the combo system. This DOES NOT mean it's possible to two-inone a sure-killing technique into another sure-killing technique! A second change to the combo system is the increased ability to juggle (hit the opponent multiple times in the air). In SFA 2, the ability to juggle was extremely curtailed...the second hit had to come almost immediately after the first one. In SF III, the juggle window has been opened up a great deal, and almost every character has moves designed to knock the opponent into the air and set up juggles. Ever since Super SF II Turbo, Capcom has been fiddling with its implementation of Super Moves (or \"Super Combos\" as they've been termed) across all of its various fighting series. SF III once again rewrites the rules. At the start of each match, you choose one of three such moves (now entitled \"Super Arts\"). Each Super Art is different, and they all vary in super meter energy requirements and the number that can be stored (up to 3 maximum). Gone from SFA is the ability to use more than one level at a time, and obviously, the access to any of the supers during the fight. Is this a good or bad thing? Super SF II Turbo (a game with one super per character) purists say that the multiple supers in Alpha were unnecessary, the select is a good compromise (plus effectively creating three \"versions of each character for additional strategy), and multiple levels were unnecessary. Alpha fans argue that multiple NECROSOA Ryk supers added more uncertainty to gameplay as one couldn't instantly tell which super was being performed, and that multiple levels and multiple supers translated into more exciting combos. What do you think? My suggestion to Capcom: include a special, soft dip selectable game mode where Super Arts Select is disabled, and all characters can use all their supers. To allow for variable charge requirements, the super bar should be segmented into three sections (one section representing each super), with the number to the side of each segment indicating how many of that super is charged. Whenever a super is performed, the drain would of course affect all three segments of the bar. Every character can choose from three Super Arts! Just like old SF, if you win you must stay with the same character, but you must also retain the same Super Art, so choose wisely.

"computer video games 900 * PARRYING MORE TWEAKS Totally new to SF lil's gameplay system is parrying, an offensive form of blocking. Blocking, as you know, is naturally defensive: hold away and you'll either walk back, or block if an attack is oncoming. Parrying is just the opposite. Push forward, and you'll either walk forward, or parry if an attack is oncoming. However, unlike blocking, parrying must be timed perfectly. If you push forward before the attack actually starts, you'll run right into it! When you parry, you knock away the opponent's attack and instantly recover, enabling you to counterattack before the enemy's attack animation has finished. For instance, in the test version, you could parry a point-blank basic attack or projectile, followed by a combo into a Super Art. It does not appear to possible to Parry multiple-hit special attacks or Super Arts. Here's a rundown on SF III's other major gameplay changes. Air blocking has now been completely removed, but it is possible to air parry. Alpha Counters are gone, as are Custom Combos. New is the ability to dash forward and back, as well as jump extra high and extra long. Every character now has a \"standard\" (same motion for everyone) top-down attack, which is a type of attack that starts high and crushes through a low blocking position. In addition to the standard topdowns, characters still have their own trademark topdowns, such as Ryu's classing rushing Strong. Now let's take a look at each character individually.... YUN 500 127500 au 1991 NOMINADO AN Like ken, Ryu has learned a variety of the new basic attacks, such as the Yokokeri. 1 Alex 1) parries Ryu's attack, 2) launches an immediate counterattack, 3) connects easily. After Parrying Alex's attack, Ryu can follow up with an immediate counter-strike, even a Super Art! Ibuki also demos the new parrying technique. Note that unlike normal blocking, this allows an immediate counter-strike! (0) EXCLUSIVE STREET FIGHTER III REPORT ALEX (U.S.A.) He's a tough guy from Manhattan, New York. Alex left home at a young age to train with Tom, a retired U.S. soldier and friend of the family. Alex now fights to avenge Tom's defeat at the hands of a mysterious man. He lives with Tom and Tom's 4-year-old daughter, Patricia. Alex is the main character in SF III. Alex is mainly a grappler, and he wants to get in close to crush you. His moves include Flash Chop, a close-range swipe; Air Knee Smash, a flying leg drop; Power Bomb, a command throw; and Air Stomp, a drop kick to the head. His three Super Arts are a Zangief-style Piledriver, a flying full-screen grab which covers fireballs and is more than reminiscent of Birdie's Bull Revenger, and a close-range combo followed by a massive bodyslam. Alex fights in a filthy, graffiti covered alleyway in a bad corner of the Big Apple.

The quest may never end. Ryu is honourable and always cares about his opponents' well-being. but he never holds back in battle. Ryu's karate style is solid and intense, unlike his friend and rival Ken's style, which is flashy. Ryu and Ken's friendship has become strained since the arrival of Ken's son. Ryu returns with all of the classic sure-killing techniques, though his Tatsumaki Sempuukyaku (Dragon Gale Kick) could not be performed in the air in the test version, presumably a final change. His basic attacks are all completely, 100% different in appearance from previous SF games, and many are used differently than before. For instance, his low Forward is now relatively slow and is no longer the quick-retracting ground weapon it once was. On the Super Arts side, his Shinkuu Tatsumaki Sempuukyaku is gone, replaced by a Shinkuu Shoryuken. His new Super is the Electric-Lightning Wave Motion Fist. Unlike the Shinkuu Hadoken (Vacuum Wave-Motion Fist), this Super must be charged up when performed, but when released at full strength is unlockable and causes dizziness! Ryu's background is a gorgeous, serene Japanese village with a bridge, a babbling brook, and a cherry blossom tree. Alex's Flash Chop has short range, but when it connects it can lead to bad, bad things. "

Dudley is the quintessential gentleman, but a bit of a snob. Some might think, \"Oh no, yet another Mike/Balrog\" (recalling the boxers from SF I and II), but Dudley's moves and controls are completely different from his predecessors. His moves include a Ryu-style Uppercut, a \"sucker\" move called Cross Counter where Dudley waits to take a hit and immediately retaliates, and two different bobbing-and-weaving dash punches. His Supers include a multi-hit Rolling Upper, a heavy corkscrew blow, and a super variation of the Uppercut.

After the collapse of the Soviet regime, Necro wandered toward Moscow where he was abducted, and strange experiments were conducted on his body. Necro now has super flexibility in his limbs, but his greatest desire is freedom from his captors. He is a cyborg and looks like a total freak. His attitude is punk. Necro feels like a cross between Dhalsim (with some what less reach), Blanka, and Zangief. His special moves include, you got it, an Electromagnetic Blast (Blanka-style zap), a long-reach Zangief-type grab, and a rushing triple punch. His supers include an enhanced EM Blast and the Slamdance super throw. His background is a sickening laboratory where a mad scientist is conducting experiments on people, bodies, and body parts.

She is adept at finding her opponent's weak point. Ibuki appears to be one of the most powerful and most popular character. She uses a flying dagger attack similar to Rolento's Stinger, a command throw, and running slide grab. Her supers include an airborne dagger assault, a flying drop-kick, and a super energy burst. Her stage is her rustic, quaint Japanese village where little Ninja-to-be children cavort by day, and dark, imposing figures stand watch by night. ELENA AFRICA) EXCLUSIVE STREET FIGHTER III REPORT Elena is the daughter of a great African tribal leader, a well educated man who studied in France. She is dearly loved by her father as she is an only daughter. She fights using the Capoeira style, which places special emphasis on the use of the legs. Elena has very powerful legs, which make up for a lack of upper body strength. Elena's moves are all kick-based...as they say on Street Fighter rap albums, she punches with her feet. Her sure killing techniques include several aerial flying kicks, and her Super Arts are comprised of two deadly multi-kick combos, and the controversial Healing. Although this has appeared in other Capcom games, this is a first for a Street Fighter. If Elena is allowed to complete the Healing Super Art, she regains a significant chunk of energy, but if she is hit during the attempt, the entire effect is negated. Her two stages include a sus pended bridge overlooking the African Savannah, and then (after a giant bird flies into the screen and knocks out the bridge supports, sending both characters tumbling down), a log suspended over a cliff with a waterfall and sedate Elephant lounging in the background. On this second background, a second suspended log can be seen and occasionally two men can be seen grappling for their lives. What's absolutely hilarious is that the two combatants often pause their struggle to observe the struggle between Elena and her opponent. It should be noted that Elena has, to the best of my understanding, the most animation frames of any 2D hand-drawn character in history. Her animation appears to be two to three times smoother than any other character in SF III. The trade-off is that the detail and shading appear to have been sacrificed. It appears Capcom decided, just for fun, to experiment and push the animation frame frontier as far as possible with one character, to see how it compared with the rest of the cast who have far fewer frames but much higher detail. 7 21800 Ihan 600 600 IBUKI ELENA 92300 40600 ORD 5 HIT SUPER ART BUKTI 15100 ARCADE 16000pts Elena's Scratch Wheel is a highly effective ground-to-air defence.

"SEAN (BRAZIL) computer video games He was born and raised in Brazil. He comes from an ordinary Brazilian family, but is a multi-talented sports youth.\" (Damn, wish I was a multi-talented sports youth...NOT!) Sean has always been impressed with Ken's fighting style and wishes to study under Ken. Sean hates to lose, is very aggressive, and has the ability to deliver a fatal blow. Sean displays his sports talent at the beginning of every match when he tosses a basketball, which invariably lands on the opponent's head. Sean is yet another Ryu/Ken headswap character, though his moves are possibly the most unique of all the \"Shotokaners\" (just for the record, by the way, «Shotokan\" is not Ryu and Ken's fighting style). Sean has the standard Shoryuken move, but his is accentuated by a massive second-hit slam at its apex. His Tornado seems closer to Dan's Cut-Off Kick than Ryu or Ken's Dragon Gale Kick. He also has the Sean Tackle, a running grab-and-beatdown move, and a flying drop-kick. His Super Arts include a super fireball (strange that he has a super version but not a normal one), a super running multi-punch/drop-kick combo, and a super uppercut. Sean's stage is, for whatever reason, a snow-covered New York street with a happy Christmas tree in the background. Sean pounds his would be instructor with the Ryubikyaku.

He is more god-like than human and he has mastered fairy magic. His style is artistic and fast, and he often looks like he is dancing. He only fights with one arm. He appears to be Japanese-American. Oro could possibly be the strangest looking Street Fighter character ever, even more bizarre than Blanka, Dhalsim, or Necro. He uses an (obviously) one-armed fireball and uppercut, as well a command throw. His Super Arts involve a huge, slowmoving energy ball which can juggle unlucky victims, and a shadow-generating super which appears similar to Rose's Soul Musion, but is intended for the express purpose of repeatedly slamming his opponent for huge damage if he so much as touches them. Oro's cave (slightly reminiscent of Akuma's stage in Alpha 2, but apparently cozier and friendlier) features his mangy but cute pets who are constantly yapping, and his stew cooking slowly over the hearth. RYHT EOS No one could fairly review a Capcom fighting game without playing the final version for at least a few weeks or a month, and this one wasn't even close to done. What separates a good fighting game from a great fighting game is balance. In a balanced fighting game, you should be able to pick any character and have a realistic chance to win if your skill is equal to the opponent's. Additionally, there should be nothing which overly cheapens, or diminishes, the strategy and feel of gameplay. Here's the score on SF III thus far. Graphics? The best 2D of all time. Audio? Need to hear more, but lots of potential. (The music was very well-composed, but quite different in style from SF II. Some of the voice actors sounded superb, but couldn't decide if the announcer was deep and foreboding, or deep, foreboding, and too much like the Mortal Kombat announcer...Mama Mia!) Storyline? Can't judge the plot without seeing the endings, which weren't in that version, much less boss(es) (of which Capcom confirms the existence but offers no further comment). Character design? Some I like a lot, some will take a while...check back in a few months, after I grow to either love them or hate them. Any factors which could cheapen gameplay? Parrying could be a godsend or a curse, depending on the ease of execution and how much damage one can inflict when a Parry connects. Balance? Well, that's the real question, and thus far wholly unanswered. For Street Fighter III to succeed, Capcom must hit it perfectly on the balance category, and that means listening to the players at the Japan AND US test locations, which did not in any way, shape, or form take place with SF Alpha 2, at least in the US (to a tee, almost every single player at the US location tests of Alpha 2 told Capcom to weaken Chun-Li, which was not done). A balanced game can be popular for six months, a year, or more. An unbalanced game will usually spike in popularity after two-three months, then quickly die because everyone gets tired of playing against a small number of characters who dominate the game. After six years of waiting, SF III's fans deserve nothing less than perfection. The stage has been set, and let's hope Capcom delivers SLASHER QUAN Oro's one-armed Nichirinsho proves a formidable projectile for Ryu.

Now the time for idle speculation is overTekken 3 is here! 2 THE THIRD RAVE WAR HAS BEEN BEGUN! Virtua Fighter 3 may currently stand as the greatest 3D fighting game, but this hasn't been a unanimous crowning. For fans of Namco's Tekken series, the release of VF3 has only strengthened their dedication to their own series, and the muchawaited third episode in the Tekken saga. The idea of a Tekken game to match or even exceed Model 3 power has been the subject of much hype recently. And now, finally, a 60% complete test version of Tekken 3 has been revealed. What is clear, is that the technology is NOT superior to that of VF3. But then none of the Tekken series has ever beaten the Virtua Fighter arcade series in visual terms. For Tekken fans, the appeal has always been in the way the games play and the potential for perfect PlayStation conversions. In these respects, you can guarantee Namco have pushed the series further than ever! WINS: 3 Jin Kazuma gives Paul a good crack across the chin.

The result is System 12. This new hardware is reported to still be compatible with the PlayStation, which bodes well for a decent conversion. However, enhanced specifications mean some form of upgrade may be necessary to fully-translate the game onto PlayStation. Here are the specs of System 12 so far released by Namco. Most interesting to note is the Time Release function. It seems System 11 had no such facility and in order to time release hidden characters into Tekken 2, Namco had to call each arcade and instruct the operator on how to switch them on! ARCADE HARDWARE SPECIFICATION WINS. 2 REPLAY (1) CPU power is 50% up compared with System 11. (11) Rendering power is 50% up compared with System 11. (iii) Better cost performance.

Having regained control of the Mishima financial empire, Heihachi became the head of the Mishima family once again.

CREDITS KING LINK ing Junior was brought up in the orphanage run by the first King. When he reached 24, he saw King killed by someone. Seeing that the orphans were downhearted and losing hope he put on the mask to keep the orphanage going. However, he couldn't become very powerful because all his techniques were learned just from watching King during his childhood. Armor King hears the rumour that King Jr has become King's successor and visits him. Seeing that he is appearing in the ring despite his suffering, Armor King decides to become his second. Although Armor King knows who killed King, out of his friendship for King he believes that bringing up this young man to be a strong fighter is more important than anything else. Four years pass and the young King has grown into a powerful wrestler King the Second. At this time he learns from Armor King that King's murderer is the God of Fighting. His trembling fists are wet with the Armor King's tears. Without saying a word he takes Armor King's hands and gives a big nod. A friendship spanning generations is restored.

Yoshimitsu, the leader of the \"Manji\" party, has continued helping the poor and needy, while raising funds for Boskonovitch's research. One day, he hears about the case of the World's missing famous martial artists. Not thinking much of it, he visits Boskonovitch research centre as usual, but Dr. Boskonovitch is acting unusual. Due to an accident that occurred during his past research, Boskonovitch has been afflicted by a mysterious pathogenic organism. He tells Yoshimitsu that he needs the blood of the God of Fighting in order to finish his research and restore his daughter. It appears that he learnt of the God of Fighting's existence during research for his daughter's resurrection.

Perfect Striker is by the same people as ISS and it shows, with the English and American versions both being called ISS when they are eventually released. Not only does this keep many of the comprehensive options and gameplay features of ISS, but it also takes a few good ideas from other football games, meaning that it could well be one of the best yet! 5. RAZOR  LUFGA After each goal, the players celebrate in front of their fans. This guy didn't bother waiting for his mates. He just ran off.  BALL CONTROL MASTERFUL MOVES! As you'd expect, Perfect Striker uses the Nintendo 64 pad's 3D stick to control the action. By pushing the pad slightly in one direction players move slowly, but by pushing it all the way they'll run. There's also a dash button for an extra burst of speed. The movement of the players in Perfect Striker is excellent, as it has all been motion-captured by Konami. There are also lots of little details which add to the atmosphere, and lots of small animations which are usually forgotten about in football games.

The player taking the penalty controls a blue box, while the goalie controls a slightly larger orange box.

"computer Video games Mars ATIKIMAS MARS ATTACKS A SHORT SYNOPSIS OF THE STORY Aliens attack the Earth again in this hilarious new film. ONSTER RECHES IN ast summer audiences were wowed by the action 1 packed Independence Day. It made an obscene amount of money, and more importantly renewed Hollywood's interest in Sci-Fi movies. While most people sat watching ID4, those in the know sat waiting for a similar film. One that would be even more outrageous. That film is Mars Attacks! THE FROST RAY MARS ATTACKS THE FILM A TH IN THE SHELL HELPLESS VICTIM 28 Soda / SAW 52 GIANT ROBOT THE FLAME MARS EXPLODES 35 From acclaimed director Tim Burton the man who brought us Batman, Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood comes Mars Attacks. It's the same old story of the Martians invading the Earth. Why? We don't know, but they sure do have fun blowing everything up! Heralding the message \"We come in peace\", the Martians soon turn very nasty, using their ray guns on anything that moves. All that is left is the smouldering skeletons of their victims. How can the people of Earth retaliate against such a menacing foe? All our armies and weapons are useless. In the end it might take something very strange, for a chance to defeat them. Mars Attacks features an all-star cast. Jack Nicholson plays the President of the United States and Glenn Close the first lady. Pierce Brosnan is scientist TTACKS Donald Kessler the leading expert on all things Martian. Also featured are Rod Steiger, Anette Bening, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox and best of all Tom Jones who plays... himself! Of course the real stars are the Martians themselves, which are some of the best CGI effects we've ever seen. Rather than go for realism the Martians move jerkily, with the film makers trying to evoke a bygone era of special effects their main inspiration being the skeleton fight from the classic Jason and the Argonauts. Also used as inspiration are classic 50's Sci-Fi movies like Invaders from Mars, This Island Earth and The Day the Earth Stood Still. As you've probably gathered Mars Attacks plays the alien invasion for laughs. Its quirky designs and kitsch colours evoke the look of comic books and 50's movies. The excellent cast, amazing effects, and hilarious script makes this a must see movie. Guaranteed to raise a smile. Now where can we get some of those ray guns? THE INVASION BEGINS FEATURF TOPPS CAROS The original Mars Attacks trading cards first appeared in 1962. Soon after they were withdrawn for moral reasons. In the intervening years the cards achieved a cult status, and are still available due to the demand for reprints. If you're a fan of the cards, rest assured that what's that smell the burning cattle have made it into the film! EXCELLENT WEB SITE Well worth checking out is the official Mars Attacks web site. The address is www.marsattacks.com. Here you can see interviews with the production crew and principal cast; view Tim Burton's original sketches, access audio samples, and download wallpaper and screen-savers.

"and The Computer and Video Games FREE Pull-out Guide March 1997 computer VIDEO games TREEPLAY NAMCO TO RELEASE ' TOY STORY' BEATING MOVIE! (Issue 11 READERS MOST WANTED CHART Finally N64 is about to arrive in the UK, and suddenly your interest wanes. Well, it is in second place this month ith their success in the videogame market firmly established, Namco have just announced they are now aiming their sights further at creating computergenerated big-screen movies that will blow away Disney's own Toy Story! SEGA SUPERCAR STORMS ARCADE SHOW! 1 TEKKEN 3 TEKKEN 3 ARCADE ARCADE 2 NINTENDO 64 3 X-MEN VS STREET FIGHTER SATURN 4 MARIOKART 64 NINTENDO 64 5 STREET FIGHTER 3 ARCADE 6 TIME CRISIS PLAYSTATION 7 FINAL FANTASY 7 PLAYSTATION 8 MARVEL SUPER HEROES NINTENDO 64 9 RESIDENT EVIL 2 PLAYSTATION 10 ANALOGUE PAD PLAYSTATION A few of your other notable Most Wanteds include Tomb Raider 2 another game by Sonic Team (yaahl), Manx TT on Saturn (see New Gamesl), Parappa The Rapper (good choice), Mortal Kombat 4, Mortal Kombat 5, Tekken VS Soul Edge (shyeah, right), Soul Edge 3 (what about 23), Intel to go bust (for releasing a Pentium and then halving its price in five months), Worms 2 on N64 (grief, no), and console Netlinks too. Keep sendin' them in with your mail, or we'll throw it in the bin. As we went to press, the London ATEI arcade show was held at Earl's Court. We thought we'd give you a quick rundown of what was hot there, before giving you more in-depth coverage next month! By far the most impressive and popular game at the show was Sega's Supercar Scud Race. Coming from AM2, we were expecting a true sequel to Daytona USA. Well, that's exactly what it is! The handling is very similar to Daytona's, but the Model 3 graphics really are something else! There are four tracks, each one showcasing a game that looks like an incredible CG demo! The first course, for example, takes you through an see-through underwater tunnel! As you'd expect, there are four views, and the in-car one has a different dashboard for each vehicle (there's a Porsche 91-GT2, Dodge Viper, Ferrari F40 and Maclaren F1). The driver's hands even reach down for the gear stick! Cars get crumpled too, just like Daytona. One other point to mention, is the impressive motorized cockpit which provides far more motion than the old Daytona cabinets. The other major game of the show, Tekken 3, although extremely popular, didn't prove quite so impressive. Despite its enhanced graphics (including 3D backdrops and advanced motion-capture), most people's opinons were that it looked like Tekken 2. It's still a big title though, due to the fact that its hardware is hotly tipped to be the upgrade for PlayStation. Sega's Super Ski G was there, looking similar to Namco's Alpine Racer. Konami's GTI Club racing Mini's, Renaults and other GTI's around cities also proved popular. Street Fighter EX the 3D version of Capcom's series was also on show. Its 2D gameplay is very similarly to Street Fighter 2's, but the graphics are very impressive. The PlayStation version is going to be hot stuff! Their first step into this new area of entertainment involves the launch of their own film production company specifically designed to create full CG movies. The move is a joint venture with three other partners, including a Tokyo-based CD software developer, Polygon Pictures. However Namco and one of these partner companies will invest 45% into the project respectively. Total investment in the project is calculated at between six to seven billion yen (around ,000,000)! Aside from making movies, Namco are also going to use the company to develop training programs for CG technologists. Namco intend on releasing their first CG film in the US before the year 2000. Exactly what kind of movie this will be, has yet to be revealed. Obviously Namco have a lot of video game characters and licenses that would prove popular and lucrative if turned into a movie. The most notable names being Tekken, Soul Edge, Time Crisis, Galaxians or even Pacman! In fact, the CG intros to many of these games are already highly cinematic. All that Namco have so far revealed, is that the film will be in the 'entertainment genre', similar to that of Toy Story the first full CG film ever made. A new scenario is being written for the film and there are 170 people involved in its production. US experts in CG technology, Digital Studios, are also said to be involved in the project. Its completion is set currently scheduled for Decemeber 1999, although they hope to push the date forward to 1998. The president of Namco Ltd, Masaya Nakamura, said \"We hope to produce a film superior to Toy Story.\" So there you have it. Perhaps top PlayStation games could end up as full-length CG movies. Or perhaps the experience gained in these films could filter down to produce more dazzling arcade or home videogame experiences. Maybe even, the female star of Rage Racer, Reiko Nagase, could become a virtual film star. Who knows!

"Duter JEO TES TOMB RAIDER PLAYER'S GUIDE O OOOO It's been available for quite a while already. We're sure a lot of you have already finished it. Yet judging by the amount of calls we get at the offices, even more of you are experiencing difficulties. Not wanting to spoil the thrills this great game offers, we're not going to print a complete solution. Instead here are some pointers to improve your formance, as well as answers to your most frequently asked questions. ................ TECHNIQUES The following are common-sense pointers. Which you've probably adopted into your own playing. Just in case you haven't, or you want a little revision, here are some tips. LARA'S SHADOW TOMB RAIDER PLAYER'S GUIDE SHOOTING When you encounter animals, it is a good idea to head for higher ground, such as a pillar or rock. The animals cannot reach you from these points. Yet you can still reach them. It is possible to shoot animals above and below you, even when Lara has trouble targeting them. Use the look button to shift your viewpoint and Lara should now get a lock-on. You can also use this technique to shoot animals in water, such as the crocodiles and rats. FALLING Lara will be injured if she falls too far. A good way to tell if she is at a dangerous height is to lower Lara over the edge. While Lara is dangling, if you can still see her shadow she will be alright if she falls. If the shadow is very small she may lose a little health. Far and away the leader of the FAQs is \"How do I find the three cogs?\" We assume these callers still haven't found the Lost Valley, so here is how. With the waterfall behind you, walk towards the cave where the wolves are hiding. After disposing of the wolves walk through the cave. With the entrance to the cave directly behind you, walk forward until you are stopped by the large white rock face. Look upwards and you will notice that the rock face has a flat surface. Jump and lift yourself up. There are several more rocks to climb. When you reach the top, walk past the skeleton to enter the Lost Valley. SAVE POINTS In later levels the save points are deviously placed (unless you're playing the PC version). Because of this, it's not always wise to save your position as soon as you see a save point. To see what we mean experience 'St. Francis' Folly' don't you just wish you hadn't used all the saves before you got to the bottom! FREEPLAY 0000000000000000000000000 "


"computer vided games Ah yes, finding those lead bars and turning them into gold. In the main arena your first task is to get access to the main building. 1/To do this you will need to perform a series of jumps across the scattered pillars in the room. 2/Finally jumping across to the upper level of the building. 3&4/The five switches correspond to the code that appears above each doorway in the arena. By inputting the code via the switches the doors are unlocked. Three of these rooms contain the lead bars, which are needed to open the exit in the fourth room. The rooms with codes OOYOY and YO000 are pretty straight-forward. OOYYO is a different kettle of fish, and the one many of you have requested help with. 5/Once inside the room go to the far end, 6/down the stairs and pull the wooden block. You will hear a huge crash. Go back up the stairs and into the room, 7/it's pretty apparent where the noise came from. Climb to the top of the stairs where you now need to jump across the debris, 8/to the exit on the opposite side. 9/You now emerge above the very large aquaduct. Do a running jump across. 10/You can wander this upper level if you want, but you need to return to this point for the next manoeuvre. 11/Which is to lower yourself down to the level beneath. Halfway down is a ledge which contains a medipack and shotgun shells. On this level you need to jump from the second arch on the right to the diagonally opposite terrace. There are apes in the second and fourth alcoves, so be careful. 12/At the second alcove from the end you need to prepare for the next step. 13&14/Turn to the right and face the rock face. You need to jump across and grab onto the tiny ledge opposite. 15-18/When dangling from the ledge, shimmy to the left until you can lower yourself onto the rock platform. 19/Now turn to face the aquaduct and you will see a tiny passage way. Jump across and follow the passage. 20/Be careful of the broken tiles. Slide down the slope and you will find yourself above the pool where you entered the level. Walk around until you find the other opening. Jump to the platform on the right, inside there is a pool. Shoot the crocodile before entering. Swim to the next room. From here it is possible to jump onto the roof of the temple. Where the last lead bar can be found. Hallelujah! From the temple, lower yourself and activate the switch inside. This opens the gates to the garden which is on the right of the start room. Climb onto the ledge at the far right of the garden, and into a cavern containing the Midas statue. Press the lead bars next to the hand of Midas, and they will be transformed into gold. Now in the possession of three gold bars return to the main arena with the five switches. Entering the code to access the fourth room YOOOY. Here you can place the bars to open the exit. TOMB RAIDER PLAYER'S GUIDE THESE ARE THE CODES K 120 search his body. You will find the second piece of the Scion, magnum clips and a large medi pack. If you now look in your inventory, there are a pair of hard earned magnums! GAME COMPLETION Upon completion of the game you can enter what Core call Action Mode. In this version of the game you have infinite ammunition and all the weapons. Providing you found all those weapons the first time around. The main extra weapon to find early on in the game is the shotgun. This can be found in the Lost Valley level. Near the switch with the cogs face downstream. Walk towards the large gate. On the opposite ledge you will notice an object sitting next to the skeleton. That's your shotgun. Now go get it!

By double tapping in the direction desired, your character will dodge accordingly with your com mand. * GRAPPLING! Ever had that feeling that the \"3D' beat 'em ups are really only 2D in action? You won't with Tobal. Depending on your location in relation to your opponent, your character will either perform either a collar hold, an arm lock, or a grab around the waist from behind. TM W ith an ith a name more fitting to a chocolate bar than a fighting game, TOBAL NO.1 is one of the better fighting games for the PlayStation and combines some super smooth characters with instantly accessible gameplay.

"* MUFU * NORK/SNORK *UDAN computer video games To access the following 3 fighters, you have to finish the four different quests in the quest mode but once they become selectable, they can be saved off onto your memory card. ooking like a cross between a bloated Dhalsim and Michael Jackson in Thriller, Mufu is as strange as they come. His style is unorthodox to say the least and though he has a very long reach, his attacks are so awkward that it's hard to chain any moves effectively together. With only average power, Mufu is simply a novelty character. nce selectable, Snork/Nork is the strongest fighter in the game and should win most of the grapple matches. He may not have a great repertoire but his limited number of moves have a good chance of hitting and can cause hideous damage. e may be the last boss I but is Udan that great? Well, he's got a decent number of moves, can cause above average damage, and he's quite small. And that's his biggest flaw. High attacks may miss but Udan is the biggest sucker for medium strikes so watch out! ITEMS Here's a low down on the items found in the quest mode. POTION A very useful item, so long as it's the right potion. However the colour of the potion changes every time you play the game, but once you've figured out which potion is what colour, remember it!

Meat can also increase the power and stamina of the fighter. LIITP CHERFT SKUIT CRISTIT CAKE: Increases the energy bar, but only a little. BREAD: Increases the energy bar more substantially. NOT SO OBVIOUS ITEMS SAITES CUNTISTER BLUE MOLMORAN: Worth 1 molmoran crystal. RED MOLMORAN: Worth 5 molmoran crystals. FREEPLAY LAMP: Gives the player a complete level map instantly. Elevators are coded in blue and red while items are green. BOOK: Gives information on any item as long as the player is holding the book. Useful for finding out which potion is which. POT: Can store up to six items and can be held in one hand but to use items inside, throw the pot. CRYSTAL: Has the same effect as the skull but makes the one hand useless once the crystal wears out so avoid it! CANISTER: Throw the canister and a pink grid will appear before your eyes. CHERRY: Has the same effect as the Dynamite potion, but for only 20 seconds. SKULL: Gives the player twice the power as usual. SCALES: If used in conjunction with any potions or food item it doubles the potency of the item. GRIDS: A pink grid gives you a mystery item at the cost of five molmoran crystals while the blue grid exchange whatever item you have in your hand for some molmorans crystals. 13 "
