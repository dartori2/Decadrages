Despite repeated requests from 25ft hardboard Venus Fly Trap, pig and palm tree from his garden. The said monstrosities attract hordes of undesirable tourists to the street and causes frequent disruption in an residents Mr Wheadon refuses to remove the otherwise quiet, respectable area. Mr Wheadon also refuses to remove the skunks, turtles and bandicoots which continually escape from his garden and foul the footpaths and grass verges. Lastly we would demand that Mr Wheadon be restrained from playacting scenes from «Crash Bandicoot», the PlayStation video game in his garden, as he creates noise and disturbance all night long, lowering the tone of the neighbourhood.

He tends to write more neatly for his favourite person, which changes from day to day. The new CVG Staff Writer! Bet you're all dead jealous! And we are too, because Alex is now the last member of the team who has nothing else to worry about except playing games all day, then writing about them. So he has time on his hands (but not much) to think of strange secret personas which he would like us to believe are all true. At the moment he's a quiet, cool, helpful character with an air of Frank Sinatra about him.

"computer Video games NEWS O NINTENDO 64: FAMICOM SPACE WORLD 1996) 22-25 NOVEMBER, MAKUHARI MESSE, JAPAN ach year Nintendo hold a major show in Japan, exclusive to developers for their games systems. Space World '96 the eighth annual Shoshinkai Software Exhibition was chosen to unveil the 64 DD storage device, along with a first look at the games planned for it. Also there was a surprise announcement about another piece of hardware, the Jolt Pack, which fits into the controller to provide physical response to the on-screen action! So, exciting new additions to an already amazing system, which now seems to carry the cool of Sega with the chic of PlayStation. NINTENDO 64 CVG was invited to the Special Guest only day, where the major announcements for the event were made. We also visited on the subsequent days which were open to the general public. Here's our report, with more details to follow next issue. NINTENDO 64 DD NINTENDO 64: FAMICOM SPACE WORLD 1996 It's real, it works, and Nintendo claim 64 DD \"infinitely enhances the possibility of the game\". There were four of these up and running, for the most part with a novelty piece of software running on it: A cube rotated on the screen, and as people entered the arena they had a digital photo of their face taken by a couple of girls. This image was later downloaded onto the rewritable DD disc, then mapped onto the cube! But to prove 64 DD was capable of handling bonafide N64 games, Nintendo had a version of Mario 64 running. NINTENDO 64 MOTHER 3 NINTENDO SA Details of the unit's specifications were scarce, but we know that it 32Mb of the total 64Mb of internal RAM is rewritable. The intention is that games using the 64 DD will be mainly cartridge and disc combinations the unit attaches to the N64 via the expansion connector, leaving the cartridge slot open. Loading speed is stated as 790K per second, compared to the 5000k per second of N64 cartridge transfer. As suspected, the Memory Expansion slot on top of the N64 will be used to boost RAM with a 2Mb 'Jumper Pak'. BY: HAL LABORATORY PUBLISHER: NINTENDO Continuation of the too-funky RPG series from Hal Laboratory. Mother 2, for the Super Famicom, was released in the USA as Earthbound, but unfortunately didn't make it here Nintendo UK preferred Secret of Evermore. Hopefully THE Games will have more sense next year. Unfortunately all there is to show at the moment is the attract sequence and one travelling shot. 64 DD SOFTWARE ZELDA 64 NEWS 0123 BY: NINTENDO PUBLISHER: NINTENDO Said to become the first DD game to use cartridge and disc at the same time. Zelda 64 is still classed as work in progress no set release date, or even month, as yet. What you see here then is shots taken from a rolling demo displayed at Shoshinkai. The central character, Link, is placed in a real time 3D setting and appears to have the same freedom of movement as Mario in Mario 64. How Nintendo intend to differentiate the two games is yet to be specified, but expect the usual: Warps to traverse vast areas of land, complex puzzles in atmospheric dungeons, and lots of cool battles against tricky bosses. Skeletons are known for being tough customers in the Zelda series. "


"NINTENDO JOLT PACK STAR FOX computer video games Get ready for a series of custom controller packs for the N64, to include the Laser Gun promised last year. This series is headed by the Jolt Pack a vibrating unit which simulates the shock of explosions and crashes in action games. Sounds a bit stupid, but works surprisingly well. In any case it's original. BY: NINTENDO PUBLISHER: NINTENDO This games looks so amazing, and is so fantastic to play, we wonder if there's any point looking forward to the Special Edition Star Wars films after all. Read about Fox McCloud and his chums, starting on page 96. A tiny coil causes the Jolt Pack to vibrate. 00:11.2 02:18.8 BLAST DOZER BY: RARE PUBLISHER: NINTENDO A mass of explosions like you wouldn't believe! Alternate between three types of robot, and five varieties of bulldozer as you attempt to clear a path for a trailer carrying a nuclear bomb. Destroy as many buildings as possible that's the rule!

"computer video games GO GO TROUBLE MAKERS NEWS O BY: TREASURE PUBLISHER: ENIX Yes! Yes! Yes! Treasure the genius team behind Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Heddy, and Guardian Heroes are developing a cool new game for N64! Early impressions are of a fast-action platform-shoot 'em up in the Treasure tradition. 529 JUNGLE KINGS IN IMAGINARY SPACE BRE The first major announcement of the day was On Nintendo's part, their role is to develop the a joint production between Nintendo Co Ltd game and sound program and provide the necand Tezuka Production Co Ltd. A game based essary technical support. Tezuka Production are on the late Osamu Tezuka's famous (in Japan) responsible for all the graphic design, along with cartoon \"The Great Emperor of Jungle\". This is the music and sound effects. But the two comthe one which The Walt Disney Company were panies together will handle the planning of the accused of 'ripping off' for their film The Lion game, its scenario, and the game system. King. The Great Emperor of Jungle is destined in many respects this game means a lot more for a 128 Meg cartridge, and ready for Spring to the Japanese than its Disney equivalent in 1998. It is described as a new generation the western hemisphere. Certainly it means a real adventure game\". lot to the key people involved. Of course Nintendo have their best man on the job, Shigeru Miyamoto, who is to produce the «This is a fun and entertaining game without game under the supervision of Makato Tezuka, loosing the magnificent vision and sincerity of Director of Tezuka Production. There have been the original story. We would like to make a new Famicom (NES) and Super Famicom (Super NES) world full of adventure and thoughtfulness in the games based on Osamu Tezuka's work before brutal game world of shooting and fighting.\" eg Atom Boy but this is the first time Tezuka Mr Makato Tezuka, Director of Tezuka Production have directly overseen the work. Production Co Ltd KIRBY'S AIR RIDE BY: HAL LABORATORY PUBLISHER: NINTENDO Characteristically bright, and cheerful. This game was unavailable for play at the show, but a running demo promises a new sensation for players early next year. We've flown, and jet skiid with N64. Now prepare to float on air. EISTE () 000 NINTENDO 64: FAMICOM SPACE WORLD 1996 «30 years have been since I dreamed of becoming a comic artist influenced by Mr Osamu Tezuka's comic. The strong will of \"making an exciting adventure world for children\" and making a genuine game without rushing\" has become true as a shape for this production plan. Please look forward to the new Tezuka world made by the original Osamu Tezuka's world which raised our generation and by the imaginary space Nintendo creates\" Mr Shigeru Miyamoto, General Manager, EAD Nintendo Co Ltd This may seem like a lot of words dedicated to a game that has only just started production, but it is very important to Nintendo and N64 in Japan. Perhaps even to video games in general. DUAL HEROES ONTINUES TO A NEW HOPE BY: HUDSON SOFT PUBLISHER: HUDSON Most significant about Hudson's game is that it is the first fighting game to use analogue control used to affect the height and trajectory of each attack. This should make for some amazing moves, so long as it : doesn't become too complex. The second major event of day one was a conference on the future of Nintendo 64, attended by Shigeru Miyamoto and other Nintendo officials. Once again the point about Mario 64 only using 60% of N64's possibilities was made. The main message being that \"64 continues to evolve\", based on the Nintendo policy of \"long term vision\". This theory of evolution was symbolised by the 64 DD and custom controller packs. Excepting Mario Kart 64, every other N64 game Nintendo hoped to release before Christmas Star Wars: SOTE, F-Zero 64, Yoshi's Island 64, etc has been held back. Which puts us right back in the familiar position of waiting avidly for title such as these, the pick of the crop: -LEAGUE PERFECT STRIKER BY: KONAMI PUBLISHER: KONAMI Another game which doesn't shine as much from the screen-shots as it does when seeing it in action. The 3D environment is very convincing, and everything runs so smoothly. Sounds great too. And with the 3D stick in control, could be the best ever. NEWS WSOS JESEN E M 10 "


"VEL YOSHI'S ISLAND 64 REV LIMIT computer video games BY: NINTENDO PUBLISHER: NINTENDO It might look like Rayman, but believe us this game is 10x more fantastic. Practically everything on screen is animated, giving the impression of a living environment. From what we can tell the gameplay looks inventive as only EAD know how. BY: SETA PUBLISHER: SETA The sooner we all get to race this thing the better latest date released is February '97, by the way. Variable weather conditions, time of day, and a cool selection of cars show lots of promise. Only thing that's missing is a sensation of speed. OVERALL VIEW Nintendo's N64 front-line is looking very strong. However there were some subtle disappointments. Generally the release dates for all games aren't set, and we're looking at Spring '97 at the earliest for all the best ones. Plus we were a little upset not to see Namco present anything not even for Super Famicom. Evidently their sports title and RPG are so far away that there is nothing worth showing just yet. Still, we expect Mario Kart 64 will keep every single N64 owner utterly contented for quite a few months at least. Updates, and obscure observations, to follow next month.

Even with all the incredible games appearing this issue, AM2 still manage to blow our minds away with these first pictures of their next incredible arcade project the proper sequel to Virtua Racing and Daytona USA! Not much is known about the game (currently under the working name of Supercars). However, the team working on it are definitely the same staff from AM2 who worked on the original arcade Daytona USA, including the producer Mr Nagoshi. Based on an actual race, the International GT Endurace Race, the game features four real car-types-the Ferrari F40, Maclaren F1, Porsche 91-GT2 and the Dodge Viper (seen in the screenshots here). Its Model 3 power is obvious from these shots, with massive totally-realistic scenery everywhere. No polygon edges in sight! Full cityscapes, sky-reaching mountains and huge jets fill the trademark busy courses of AM2. How it plays is not toally clear, but AM2 driving fans should be able to spot the clues. These pictures show cars power-drift battling around a wide corner. Other scenes show it scrapping off walls, with sparks spraying everywhere. The on-screen indicators also match Daytona's very closely. We know the game will have a moving cabinet too. Such a ground-breakingly specatacular game can't be ignored, so expect everything released on this game to be covered in our next issue. game Are you okay? Paintwork-shredding action.

They specialise in Gokei (5 Pattern) Fist, Yoi Sen (intoxicated Hermit) Fist, Taka-tsume Honshi (Hawk Claw Playful) Fist, Tsuhai (backpiercing) Fist and Keii (Fixed Mind) Fist. If you understand what that means, maybe you have some clue to the new characters in the game. That move on the right looks familiar... AM3's urban-based beat 'em up is proving extremely popular among more hardcore arcade gamers, so its no surprise to find it coming to Saturn. Early development has already begun on Last Bronx and here's a first screenshot to prove it. Tommy is so far the only character to so be revealed. Nonetheless, if previous AM3 conversions are anything to go by (see Virtual On on page 86 for example), we can expect an amazing conversion. More next month! Last month we told you of Sonic Team's excellent festive giveaway Christmas NIGHTS. This month we can reveal exactly how Sega's : official deal works. From the 6th December, anyone buying a Saturn or TWO of Sega's major Christmas titles (NIGHTS, Fighting Vipers, Worldwide Soccer, Virtua Cop 2, Daytona CCE) can claim a copy. Sega have stated though that retailers are free to change the deal slightly, : ie. you may be able to buy two different games if you ask. But you're gonna have : to ask your retailer about it(some may not even be doing the deal!). Anyway, here's a picture of the Japanese Flash Saturn Christmas NIGHTS pack, to justify the SPEAWURN above heading. OD "

USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES * Dear CVG, I love RPGs. Since those halcyon days when I first played such classics as Phantasy Star II. and Sword of Vermilion, through to Shining Force and Ys (on the NEC Turbo Duo), and now onto... Shining Wisdom. I bought my Saturn for RPGs, simple as that. And now what greets my eyes? Shining Wisdom a poor Zelda derivative at best, providing limited enjoyment with its bland visuals and laughable 'secrets' (the best bit is turning into a giant monkey using a hidden orb!), Mystaria good fun, but WAY too easy and far too shallow, or possibly Story of Thor 2-a ghastly combination of adventure, RPG, and hack em up styles. So it was with great delight that I saw features in issue 180 on Dark Saviour, Shining in the Holy Ark, Grandia, etc. Which brings me to my two questions: Firstly, any more news on possible release dates? Secondly, in your FreePlay section, you recommend Dark Saviour in your Saturn import Top Five. Does this mean that the Japanese version has English text? Or do you mean an American import? Because it hardly seems a good idea to buy an RPG in a different language! Whatever the case, please could you enlighten me as to Japanese/ US/ UK compatibility (I have a UK Saturn) which games will work with my machine? Thanks for your help. Chris Agar, Bath Dear CVG, In issue #180 all your readers were against the N64, so it's up to me to defend it. First of all these 32-bit games seem to be either 3D beat'em ups (or else 2D), or driving games eg VF 1&2, Fighting Vipers, Tekken 1&2, Daytona, Ridge Racer 1&2, Sega Rally, etc. I am sick to death of these coin-op conversions because there is little variation within the games mentioned above. Now let's take a look at Nintendo's first games: PilotWings a fun flight sim. Mario 64 the best game ever. And Wave Race a racing game which is completely different to the racing games mentioned above, as is Mario Kart 64. The future looks good with Blastdozer creating a new genre for itself, as well as Shadows of the Empire, a platform/ shoot'em up/ driving game. Other bad points about these [32-bit) consoles include graphical faults, such as the blockiness that happens when a big sprite comes close (unlike Bowser), lack of split screen two-player games as well as those loading times which, when combined, ruin the game's quality and atmosphere. You know the N64 is the best by awarding Mario and Andrew Spiretos Pilot Wings as being the best in their genres, says Wave Race is and hopefully Wave Race as the best racer. Having briefly played it the best. Wrong! wouldn't disagree! I don't own an N64 yet, since it's not out in the UK, and I suspect last month's sad PS and Saturn owners haven't played one, but believe me, once it's been out in the UK for a couple of weeks I expect a lot of Saturn/ PS \"For Sale\" ads will start appearing in your mag. Andrew Spiretos, Leeds CVG: We're as cheesed off as you, Andrew, about the endless derivative titles being released on the 32-bit systems. But, strangely enough, we always seem to enjoy them -as do most people buying it seems. Hate to rain on your parade too much, but Wipeout 2097 on PlayStation is a much better game all round than Wave Race 64. And N64 might have Mario 64, but it has nothing to touch VF2 yet to keep players at the machine for longer than a couple of months. Mario Kart 64 on the other hand... WOTTSA MATTA MATSUSHITA? CVG: When will the UK get used to the idea that RPGs, in their many guises, account for some of the coolest gaming experiences ever?! The reason we recommended Dark Saviour, Chris, is that it requires very little knowledge of Japanese to play through as it is very much action-orientated. But, yes, all the presentation is in Japanese. As for compatibility between machines, unless you get some kind of adaptor, or have a special switch fitted, your Saturn will only run games intended for its country of origin. ES Dear CVG, If, as rumoured, Matsushita decide on the upgrade for 3DO M1, surely they must offer some sort of large trade-in discount for present owners. Also, the chances to sell 3DO M1 as a quality budget system were huge, all that was needed were a few top PC conversions, ie F1 GP2, Duke Nukem, etc. A -150 machine with just a couple of quality games would, even at this eleventh hour, sell millions, and these people would be the first adopters of M2. I believe Matsushita are still thinking of an upgrade for M1, yet they have completely abandoned original owners and lost potentially millions more by not pursuing the simple strategy outlined above. CVG should ask them what, if anything, they think of their original customers, any upgrade strategy for these customers, the likely date of M2's arrival in the UK, and what software (if any) for M1 until the arrival of M2. John Mara, address not supplied SH11131 HELLO I'M NICKLEBOB! Dear CVG, I've got an excellent new idea for a name for your Mail Bag. How about \"Nicklebob's Stronghold!\". I call it this because of the little guy sitting next to all of the replies to letters. How about calling him Nicklebob! If this excellent idea wins, the game I would like you to send me is Virtua Fighter PC Remix. Thanks. CVG: This letter is like a voice from beyond the grave. Matsushita are keeping quiet about M2, but it's highly unlikely that it will be made available as an 'add-on' for existing 3DOs. The M2 hardware is so radically different, the only use a 3D would have is providing a CD-ROM drive! There's no hope of finding any new software either. oo cool of CVG: Bloo-dy Hell. : Bloody 14 "


"SONIC IS MY PAL! computer video games Dear CVG, After reading the reviewers comment of the Crash Bandicoot review, I thought that Tom Guise had lost his mind. He had the nerve to insult my hero: Sonic the Hedgehog! Let me refresh your memory: BAG \"In many ways Crash is exactly what Sonic would be if he were on PlayStation. Graphically superb, technically perfect and surgically challenging, but not so cuddly to play. Flawless, but perhaps a bit charmless too.\" I felt sad, really sad. How could he say that Sonic is charmless and not so cuddly? After all Sonic the Hedgehog IS the most charming and cuddly games character in existence! It took me two long days before I saw the light: \"What Sonic would be if he were on PlayStation.\" But Sonic isn't on PlayStation! Sonic will be on Saturn: graphically superb, technically perfect, surgically challenging, AND cuddly to play. Flawless, and charming too! STAR LETTER 60 FUNS PER SECOND Tom Guise is a very smart guy indeed! Gerard Blom, Sas van Gent X-MAS TOM: That's exactly what I meant! I'm a big Sonic fan too. And while Crash is a very well crafted platformer, it lacks that feel-good brilliance that makes all Sonic's Megadrive games all-time awesome classics. Fingers-crossed Saturn Sonic will follow suit, in the same excellent way NIGHTS has. And yes you're correct, I am a very smart guy! FIFTEEN-YEAR OLD FIGHT FANATIC Dear CVG, Having made the leap to 32-bit technology eleven months ago I must say I am staggered by the entertainment value I get from my machine. I bought a Sega Saturn and I have no regrets about my purchase. Lots of rubbish is printed about polygons per second, frames per second, transparency effects, 2D power and so on but not so much is said about entertainment value. Sure it helps if a game looks and sounds great, but if it plays like a total dog who wants to know? Kevin Robson, Drayton 003CVG: That's the spirit! Dear CVG, Can I just say that your magazine is the best available anywhere. I have a collection of absolutely all different types of computer magazines, but they are all old issues because the only mag I buy now is CVG. Keep up the brilliant work. By the way, I have a few questions: 1. Is it true Square have agreed to still make games for the Nintendo 64, because I'm planning on getting one and I love RPGs, and after seeing your review of Final Fantasy VIII want to get it. 2. I'm 15, and love beat'em ups as well as RPGS, but I'm also considering getting a PlayStation (considering cool games like Street Fighter Alpha 2 are on it). Which, in your opinion, is best N64 or PS. 3. Will any Street Fighter games like SFA2 be coming out on the N64. 4. Will Zelda 64 be one of the games released in the UK on March 1997 with the N64? Ben Braine, Chelmsford FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK Dear CVG, I've been reading your magazine for a few months now and I think it's more interesting and much easier to read than the other computer magazine I used to read. Anyway! wonder if you can help me? My brother and I are thinking of getting a new console but we are not sure if we should get a PlayStation, Saturn, or N64. I wonder if you could send us some information about these consoles. For example: which is the best console? Which console has better games, and which will probably stay in fashion the longest, and which console will make better games in the future. I hope you can help us with this problem. Lewis Farr, Mid Glamorgan USERS VOICE OF COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES CVG: For the time being, the PlayStation is Ben Braine's best option. Capcom have said nothing about any Street Fighter games on N64, and we seriously doubt Zelda 64 will appear before March in Japan, let alone the UK. PLAYING FAIR MONKEE-EE!!! CO C VG: Well, for that kind of informa tion you need only read pages 18-22 where you can decide for yourself. Dear CVG, First of all I'd just like to say that I've been reading your magazine now for the past four months, and I absolutely love it! I'm also chuffed about the price. As if the mag wasn't already great, you go and put this section up so great people like me can put forward their views on the computer world, and not have petty quarrels on which system is the greatest. Anyway I'll get straight to the point: I thoroughly agree with what Timothy Andrews of Essex said last month about the N64. This is my story: About seven months ago I sold my SNES which I'd had for about four years, in the hope of getting together some cash for the N64. In late August though, I'd learnt about the long delay for the N64's release in Europe. had waited for too long for this to happen and soon decided that I would buy either a PlayStation or a Saturn, given that they were: 1) Out now, 2) reduced to a substantial price, and 3) cheaper games. In the end decided to buy a PlayStation and so far I have been very happy with it. And that is my point: No matter how powerful the N64 will be, people aren't gonna wait forever. People want something now, they want something cheap, and they want something which won't mess them about. Robert Bailey, Manchester Dear CVG, I was browsing through the editorial of issue #180 of your excellent magazine when I noticed that Tom, Phil, and Mike all had Monkey as one of their favourite TV shows. I thought I was the only one. I do hope you are referring to the 60's Japanese live action series, currently showing on Bravo (cable channel) every week night at 70' Clock. I told my friends to watch it and they all came back the following day saying it was crap because of the naff special effects and dubbing. To which I replied that it is a sixties series which explains why the effects are not state-of-the-art and it was originally Japanese, and if it was dubbed no one in this country (apart from those who speak Japanese) wouldn't understand it, duh! They just don't appreciate the excellent storyline and humour. That's why I think you should dedicate at least a page to Monkey to try and persuade people to its brilliance, especially the fight scenes. Thanks for your time. I'm now off to watch the exploits of Pigsy, Sandy, and of course Monkey. Luke Dennett, Bristol BUY ME BUY MEI BUY ME CVG: However long you have to wait, N64 is worth it. However it's also true that Saturn and PlayStation are supported by some of the best games ever created. The staff here wouldn't exchange their machines for anything else. We reckon 1997 could be a pretty quiet year for Nintendo, as a lot of UK players finally succumb to the lure of VF2, Tekken 2, and many other class acts already available. CVG: If we get any more requests, maybe we will. Same goes for The Water Margin, aka Suikoden, which is based on the same legend as Konami's game. 15 "

The time of year when everyone gathers round the Christmas tree and plays video games. But if you're thinking of buying a new system this year, which one should it be? Do you go for the unrivalled brilliance of the key Saturn titles; the consistently exceptional standard of PlayStation games; the promise of monumental titles on Nintendo 64; the exciting evolution of the PC; or cheap, fail-safe 16-bit systems boasting a range of recognised classics?

MEGA DRIVE 16-BIT SYSTEMS SUPER NINTENDO oth the Sega Mega Drive and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System have been around for years, and were the main machines for the console boom of the early Nineties.

While Nintendo have been criticised for releasing their «next-generation» machine too late, it's still the only true 64-bit system available at the moment (the Jaguar doesn't count do the math). 20\" WHY SHOULD I GET ONE NOW? (  PDR ACHITE) If you're desperate for a Nintendo 64, you either need to be patient and wait until next year, or buy an imported American or Japanese machine. Here's a bit of help in case you choose the latter. JAPANESE SUPER MARIO 64 5* 3 20 ** Japanese machines are generally easier to get hold of in the UK than American machines are, because more were manufactured and the initial rush of sales has died down. Another plus point is that Japanese games have a certain \"coolness\" about them, usually using nicer artwork and packaging than the American versions. Both systems require the same effort to get them going a step-down convert. er and a TV which displays 60Hz, or a SCART conversion to the insides of the machine. Of course, all Japanese games have Japanese text, though that actually made Mario 64 last a few days longer for us. This is almost definitely going to be one of the launch games for the UK. It's also one of the best games of all time, with incredible graphics and gameplay, as well as a big playing area. Already a classic. CHRISTMAS BUYERS GUIDE *WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOID? (   HINE) PILOT WINGS 64 AMERICAN Follows on from the excellent SNES game with amazingly detailed worlds to fly around, as well as a magical feeling of flight. One to come back to just for the sensation. The American machine is basically the same as the Japanese system, with the cartridges varying slightly. Japanese games can be played on an American system, and vice-versa, by snapping some bits of plastic from the inside of the machine (not recommended). While most games are released in Japan first, quite a few games have been developed in the US and are premiering there instead KI Gold, MK Trilogy, Cruisn' USA, etc. There's basically no difference between the two just work out which country you're more likely to buy games from, and shop around for the best deal. WAVE RACE 64 TI D'OLOOG The advantages of waiting for the eventual official release of the Nintendo 64 are mostly to avoid the hassle of import machines. You'll be able to buy a system, go home, and it'll work. You'll be able to buy a game, go home, and it'll work. It cuts out all compatibility problems and having to pay over-the-top prices for imported games. Unfortunately, UK systems need to be made differently to run on PAL TVs, meaning that games run slower and with borders unless the programmers spend more time working on them. Judging by most of the UK SNES releases, this conversion may not be done on UK N64 games. The first two-player game to be released for the N64. Race jetskis around buoys, bouncing over waves and ramps, performing stunts on the way. Excellent fun. *UNIQUE BECAUSE... HBLAST CORPS 1. * 0 a 2/8 RM 01 \"92\"25 The games are on cartridges rather than CDs, so there are no loading times during the game or between levels. Luigip Mario FEATURES: SUPER MARIO KART 64 The SNES version is one of the greatest games of all time, and the Nintendo 64 upgrade looks as though it could be even better! This is the game we're all waiting for! The Nintendo 64 itself is the 9 * most advanced console available, as it's the most recently released. The amazing hardware allows some incredible graphics to be done effortlessly. YOSHI ISLAND 64 STAR WARS: SOTE 3.* Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario. This single man is responsible for most of Nintendo's success, and is overseeing nearly every release on the Nintendo 64, adding his magic touch to everything. With sections varying from flying around the AT-ATs, to creeping along corridors taking out Stormtroopers, Shadows of the Empire could well be the best Star Wars game ever! Health Laser 22 "

The side area of the main booth was modelled like a rock wall with various huge crates stacked up along side. Around the top of the booth, a huge boulder rolled along the edge, occasionally blowing out smoke. No need to guess that Crash Bandicoot was in town! The game went down really well and there was a queue that wrapped around the entire booth to play it. Da popralncRAPPLE PLAYSTATION EXPO ith over 50 companies exhibiting nearly 200 games, it was the largest collection of PlayStation software ever seen under one roof! Held from November 1st 4th, this four day event was packed from dawn to dusk with tens of thousands of Japanese game players who happily waited for hours in a queue that stretched out of sight! Without exception, all the big developers were there, at last unveiling their Christmas titles, or previewing the games of 97. Some of these games won't be out for over 8 months but you could still play them! Our Japan correspondent, Warren Harrod, took a look at what was hot at the show! PARAPPA THE RAPPER owever, SCE's best game and certainly the game of the show was without doubt Parappa the Rapper. A Rythmn Action game in which you have to make music to progress. eve The hero, Parappa, needs to win his sweetheart Sunny Funny's affection by learning how to rap 'cool' through six stages. To do this, he must correctly follow the actions of his teacher on each stage. For example, his teacher raps the first four bars of a tune. The buttons you should press and the timing for them, are shown at the top of the screen. Correctly repeating the rap will eventually see you through the level. To get top marks though, you have s to create your own original rap tune. If you have no rythmn, the music gets weirder and weirder. Your instructor's mood also changes for the worse.

"computer video games DEPIH DEPTH Iso at the show was SCE's Amusical adventure DEPTH. Controlling a Dolphin, you start in a place called 'Silent Space'. From here you can swim throught 12 different gateways to different sound worlds, arranging the colours and patterns within to create your own various soundscapes. Although it's a music-orientated game like Rapper, it doesn't have the immediate appeal or interest that Rapper does. As it takes a fairly long time to get into it and explore the various options, it was obviously difficult for players to give it a decent go. Although SCE had a lady by every machine ready to assist, few people had the patience to play it for very long.

Based on a very popular TV series it's likely to do quite well. It's released this month, so if it wasn't already complete there shouldn't be much left to do. Although the graphics are decent and the gameplay is solid, it's unlikely to be released outside Japan where the characters are not known. KEMATI K fter a seemingly endless development time, SME have finally fixed the release date of the long-awaited Kowloon's Gate for February 1997. Unfortunately it wasn't playable, but a preview video handed out to all who walked by, clearly shows the graphics engine is all but complete. As a 4 CD-ROM set, this game is clearly going to take a long time to complete.

"computer Video games * NAUCO * IAMCU Although game of the show goes to Rapper, there can be no doubt that Namco had the greatest selection of games at the show. Due to the popularity of their games, Namco were forced to limit the playing time allowed, in order to let everybody have a go (Soul Edge five wins, Rage Racer one race, Time Crisis one game etc). Even so, there were still long queues for all their games.  NAMCO 1996 PlayStation SOUL EDGE MITSURUGI SEUNG MINA A t long last, Namco's hugelyawaited follow-up to Tekken 2 is near completion for its December 20th Japanese release. They've done an excellent job of converting it to the PS. The graphics look crisp and the character movement is smooth. However it's not perfect yet, as there are still some lingering polygon clipping problems. A particularly interesting one shows a character sticking his sword through his head in the winning pose. Very painful! As is now customary in Namco's arcade conversions (or anyone else's for that matter), there's a variety of PlayStation-only features. A special CG intro has been included, and there's new endings for each of the characters. Interestingly, the European/ American characters speak in English, while the Asian characters, speak in Japanese with English subtitles. What's more, there's also mention of an opportunity for players to affect the outcome of these endings. Extra stages have been added. There are also allnew character costumes, designed by the winners of a competition held in Japan. Included are remixes of the arcade tunes, as well as brand new PlayStation tunes under the moniker of the 'Khan Super Session'. As with the Tekken series, extra play modes have been added VS, Time Attack, Team Battle and Survival. Nothing new there, but there is one mode which influences all the others...

Your character travels the world, defeating opponents and collecting their weapons. You can then use these weapons yourself. Each character has to build up their own collection, so you need to complete it with every fighter! As you clear each stage, a log of your exploits is kept in a little book. It has a Story Mode feel to it. There are 8 or 9 extra weapons per character to collect, and these can be saved onto memory cart and used in any of the other game modes (VS, Time Attack etc). With each weapon providing different abilities (ie. short reach and quick, long reach but slower) this makes for masses of fighting techniques. As such, different records are stored depending on which weapons are used! GANIVE ACE COMBAT ? till early in development, but already looking great. It plays superbly with smooth handling and great control. The graphics are the best yet for a PS flight sim and you really want to use the twin stick for the all-round flying experience. Not quite as popular as Soul Edge, Time Crisis and Rage Racer but still attracted a fair amount of attention. The level of detail and multiple options give it a depth that can't be appreciated at a show. The main differences to the original Ace Combat are: (1) Graphically improved with super-detailed backgrounds and enhanced modeling for the planes. (ii) AC had 16 planes. There's no details on AC2, but there are new planes (ie. the Su-35) so if they keep all the old Planes they have certainly increased the number of them. (iii) Even the original planes as before have been completely redesigned. The only AC plane that was playable was the F22, but this has been visibly improved. fiv) As in AC there are two selectable viewpoints. First person perspective is great for dog-fights (because you can utilise thethead-up display and lock on easier) while 3rd person per spective is useful for precision flying (such as flying down. a narrow canyd because you can judge the distance between yourselt and obstaclesalt's also useful f ong flights (because the HUD isn't drawn so you get a good view). (W AG hadjonly 18 missions, AC2 has over 30. You have the freedom to select your preferred mission. (vi) A wide number of mission targets. For example a city, a snowy mountain range, the Grand Canyon and an island (with an offshore oil rig). We've also seen sketches of a hydro-electric dam, an oil/gas pipeline running to an industrial complex and a European castle. 26 "

A definite challenger to the Virtua Cop crown. he next big game of the show was Namco's answer to Virtua Cop. This was probably one of the few games where people watching outnumbered people waiting. Incredibly popular with everyone at the show. Everybody agreed the gun itself (the most important aspect) was easy to use and very accurate. Namco themselves have stated that it's much more accurate than Konami's gun. Certainly nobody ever reported dodgy collision detection. Obviously Namco had their work cut out porting a System 22 game to PlayStation, so the quality of graphics can't be realistically compared. However it's an excellent conversion and It's still in early development. The obvious changes from the arcade version are the pedal and the gun. The pedal has been replaced with a small red button on the side of the gun and the peripheral itself no longer has recoil. Other than this it's identical. The main feature of Time Crisis is being able to dodge behind objects to reload. However, while hiding you can't see the enemy who often change positions. There's a time limit. Spend all your time behind walls and crates and you end up going nowhere at all! The game contains the Time Attack and Story Mode from the arcade version. In Story Mode there's an opening and closing movie and intermissions between stages, all featuring the hero Richard Miller. There will also be original PS modes, including an original stage. but that's all we're saying for now!  NAMCO 1996 FEATURE Playstation PlayStation CCSS3 The Namco GunCon in use.

While some people may be less than impressed with the graphics there are those who think this game is great. As such it was popular at the show for those who liked it and unlike the other Namco games you could play for ages. Namco have done an excellent conversion with great 3D graphics that rotate and scale beautifully. It comes from Namco's System 11 board so boasts some impressive effects. As shooting games go it's great. The PS has original opening and ending movies also. PlayStation INKS COC Degrettably Namco choose to put only two of these units on display which meant that there were large crowds around these games at all times. The classic games on offer this time (see if you recognise them) are Ordyne, Assault, The Return of Ishtar, Genpei Tournaden and PacLand. Of course the conversions are perfect and are identical to the originals. From my occasional glances in this direction no one game seemed to be played more than any other. This time around Namco have made the 3D museum section more interactive than before with a variety of features and amusing events. A 2D-style shoot 'em up with brilliant 3D graphics. One of the most impressive features is the homing laser. It's like spider's legs flicking out everywhere!  NAMCO 1996 * CAPCOM After several shows with a great line-up of games and a fantastic booth design, it was a real disappointment to see that Capcom were unable to get sufficient space to allow them to do it again this time also. After a rush of great games, Capcom appear to be in a lull before next year's releases are ready. While there were a lot of people at the stand, you couldn't really say there were ever huge queues to play any of the games on offer. This time they had Rockman 8 and Super Street Fighter Puzzle 2x. Rockman 8 looked great and will probably be a good game. Unfortunately, while the Rockman series appealed to the younger audience that owned the SFC, the PS has an older gaming audience who aren't as likely to buy this sort of game. Street Fighter Puzzle 2x as expected, was arcadeperfect, and was favourably received also.  CAPCOM 1996 PLAYSTATION EXPO With the town now under infection, you can expect the horror to have increased! BIOHAZARD 2 Infortunately, the mega-awaited U sequel to Resident Evil wasn't on play at the show. Capcom probably not wanting to distract attention from their Christmas releases.

With new PS features, this perfect arcade conversion of the excellent 3D polygon shoot 'em up proved very popular. Next was Ray Tracers, the only real competition to Rage Racer at the show. Using texture mapped polygons and light sourcing, it looked impressive. The best touch is the individual characters that come with each car. They also had a conversion of their Super Football Champ, the most interesting feature being that you can use the multi-tap to have a 4-player game. At last the PS has a really great space battle simulation game. Aubirdforce is the most realistic ever seen. Position the units in your fleet, send out probes, launch fighters, repair damaged systems and upgrade equipment. By coordinating your units and using your battle strategies you can really experience realistic star fleet battles at last! You control units including dreadnoughts, battle cruisers, frigates, fighters, space stations, scout ships, supply ships, satellite cannons, battle mechs and prison stations. There are over 50 different pilots amongst your fleet. After clearing a battle stage medals are awarded to them depending on their performance. There are 23 ranks to rise through from the lowly 3rd Grade Seaman to the Grand Admiral.

Our imaginations have been running wild over the past weeks, thinking of what could be included to improve on the classic original. The reality is that Mario Kart 64 looks even better than our make-believe perfect race game! With the release date brought forward (it's on sale in Japan even as you read these pages!) we're preparing to bring you some high class Mario Kart 64 coverage next issue.

This is a little strange, as it leaves the teams uneven. Could Nintendo be reserving one last special surprise for TIME 00 294 launch day? What happened to Kamek the wizard? Most likely the bigger teams are there to cater for the fourplayer versus mode allowing more players to race their favourite class type. FINAL LAP 6th Yoshi is part of the light class of drivers. Bowser really likes to throw his weight around! ** VERSUS CONUNDRUM ** KOMPREHENSIVE KART CONTROL Just to clear something up for last month's report: Where there's just two drivers competing, the screen is split horizontally just like the original 16-bit Kart. Versus mode is only divided into four windows when three or more Karts involved. Just about any Mario Kart expert will tell you of the almost Zen-like mastery it's possible to attain with the 16-bit game. Mario Kart 64 caters for three types of driver, aiming to keep the race in check and always in their favour.

Not only that, but this one dares to be different! T recent BAZE WELDONUEL ce hockey has been a very popular game style, ever since EA Hockey broke the mould so long ago. The real game lends itself perfectly to the home ultra fast, loads of action, great plays, and some great fights. Gretzky 3D hockey picks up where the last EA game left off. And what NBA JAM was to basketball, Gretzky aims to be with ice hockey. It's even got the same 'boomshakalaka' announcer as the Jam games! RÉKVEN FOCKET THE GREAT ONE OPTIONS TONIGHTS MATCH UP PINK SIZE ARCADE CASY DIFFICULTY PERTO LENGTH NO TING As in all the best sports sims, it's good to get a license. In the world of hockey there is none bigger than Wayne Gretzky, he's a legend. Now 40, Gretzky used to be the starting centre for the LA Kings, this season however he's playing for the New York Rangers. Also licensed for the game are the NHLPA and the NHL, so all teams have the real players, the real logos, and of course all the stats. MANIL! PLAY SPEED PUCK STREAN Gretsky also features the by now regulation play by play commentary, multiple camera angles and replay functions. Plus with the real time rendered graphics things look very nice indeed.

There he is again, No. 99 for the NY Rangers. BOOOOMSHAKALAKA HE SHOOTS... HE SCORESI Goals are what people want. Edge of the seat pant ripping shoptouts. And in Gretzky's 3D Hockey, goals is what you get. Certain types of goal end in special sequences, just like the JAM \"he's on fire\" kind. Power goals discovered include: blowing the goal over; setting the net on fire; and the goalie turning into a brick wall! Basketball sims were criticised for being a little bit repetitive in the game play area. Of course NBA JAM changed all that, and Midway are hoping to add similar tweaks to hockey. However, ice hockey as a video game is a lot more dynamic than basketball, so there are only minor additions to the game play. You can opt for an arcade or simulation style game, also change the rink size and number of players per team. Arcade is exactly that an ever faster hockey game with lots more goals, mainly because there are only three players per side. Simulation mode is the normal hockey game, with the option to play a full 82 game season is included, plus there's a best of seven playoff series. 2nd Gece REPLAY COMING SOON 'Cos this game is so fast, we could only catch this goal on the replay! in las 0 Cue \"He's on fire\" announcer, great satisfaction every time!

Kurt's outfit may look strange, but it's really quite clever. His arm-mounted gun can be strapped to his helmet to switch the game into a special telescopic viewing mode. Kurt can now zoom his view in as far as he wants, then fire a perfectly accurate shot, right between the eyes of an enemy on the other side of the level who hasn't even seen him! See that blip on the horizon? It's an enemy! Just put the helmet on... And it's much clearer! He can't see you, so aim between his eyes... And fire! Pop goes his head and he's down in one shot!

"1100) computer video games SILNIU Here's proof that MDK is by Shiny the Earthworm Jim cow! It lies in this cabinet with air bubbles coming out of its bottom! THE RIBBON CHUTE! ROM CLEVER GIRI... The enemies in MDK have a high level of artificial intelligence, and don't always act as you'd expect computer characters to. For example, when some enemies spy you at the top of a cliff, they run and hide behind rocks, poking their heads out every now and then to see what's happening, giving you just enough time to shoot them in the eye with your zoom helmet! There are also times that you can injure one baddie by shooting his foot, for example, and wait for others to come to his assistance! Another interesting part of Kurt's costume is the strange ribbon chute which he can use to slow his descent, much like a standard parachute. By using this cleverly, he can float across long chasms, grabbing hold of the ledge on the other side, or float safely to the floor! CUTE That enemy down there's seen you, and he's running for cover... Just wait for him to peek round the corner and finish him off! The ribbon chute lets you glide around the level. SHINY'S LATEST SUPERHERO KURT! TAL It's pretty confusing to end up in this strange forest, but shoot the walls... And the fake scenery drops to reveal an alien base behind! It's a trap! DUH... WHAT I DO HERE? MDK is different from other 3D action with your arm gun. Or you can stand at a games like Quake in that a bit more strategy safe distance, find a clear line, zoom in on can be used to progress. If you feel like it, his head, and kill him with a single wellyou can run straight up to a big baddie, and placed shot. At other times, there's more try to destroy it by running around, shooting than one way to get rid of baddies... 1 This bad guy's floating around on his little hover ship, but shoot him off cleanly... And it's yours! Now you can fly around the level taking everyone else out! Brilliant! 20* This giant robot guard will cause problems if he sees you. Either take him out from a distance... Or shoot away the two supports for the door behind him, so that it falls and squashes him flat! NEXT MONTH... MOST DEFINITELY KOMING!

"computer video games * 70% ADVENTURE BY WARP  SATURN VERSION AVAILABLE (JAPAN)  PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 4 CD COMPLETE MARCH RELEASE 1 PLAYER  RELEASED BY ACCLAIM TEL: 0171 344 5000 PlayStation SAT Maybe you think that it's impossible to be scared by a mere game. That kind of thing is reserved for Hollywood right? the Japanese can't get enough of PlayStation ENEMY ZERO (EO) THE ALIEN ANGLE Taula SHOCKING NEW HORROR ADVENTURE year ago Warp were unknown. Now the Japanese can't get enough of them and their founder, Kenji Eno, as anticipation for the release of Enemy Zero mounts. This rapid change in fortune is entirely due to their first game D, an adventure created completely out of CG Graphics, which showed that rendered 'interactive movies' could actually be quite cool. D was too short, but aroused considerable interest in this much more ambitious sequel. Presently only a Saturn release is confirmed for December in Japan. Although confusingly, all these shots are from the PlayStation demo shown back at last year's PlayStation Expo. At the event, Warp sensationally ditched the PS version (which was then the leading format). The manner of this fall-out was remarkable large video screen on their stand displayed Mr Irimajiri (Sega consumer division's No.2 in Japan at that time) announcing EO would be a Saturn exclusive after all! At the time, Warp were citing contractual disagreements for the move. Since then they've talked a lot about the technical differences between PS and Saturn that make Enemy Zero more commercially viable on Saturn (read fact box on compression issues). However, a PS version is not ruled out, as Acclaim are apparently handling this themselves. Which would, of course, require all Warp's source code this is not a game you could convert from scratch! What a game it promises to be! You'd have to be thick to miss the parallels between the concept of EO and the plot of the first Alien movie. And the atmosphere of that cinematic classic is what Warp are trying to capture. The sexy, enigmatic player-character Laura is inexplicably woken from hypersleep on the long-haul space freighter AK1*, much like warrant officer Ellen Ripley was on the Nostromo in Alien. The vast, gloomy AK-1 which is split into four towers named after the sea sons seems cast from the same mould as the setting for Alien. The AK-1 also shares a Nostromostyle crew, and unlike D, Laura will be able to communicate and interact with six other characters. The other key character is a stylish black girl called Kimberly. All the rest are probably destined to be alien snacks for the ominous force that appears to have infiltrated the AK-1 in deep space. Stopping it is the basis for the game. *Warp have yet to offer an explanation for how Laura is able to jump the several centuries that separate D and EO. Kimbers, Heart David Parker Ronnys This time Laura is not alone. The characters pictured here are encountered throughout the game, and offer advice in key locations. POWERING UP The common motifs of D's puzzles were mystery and magic hidden messages, astrological symbols, haunted pictures. EO's motif is technology. As Laura explores the AK-1 she must restore power to areas shutdown by the main computer for hypersleep, including the lifts that take her between levels of the towers. She must also use the internal communications and database terminals programmed by Vexx Electronics. It all points to a much more complex game world than D. NOUS PNINO) This is how the real time exploration sections appear on screen. Control is nowhere near as polished as id's games, but it works well. Video hone SOMETHING REAL TIME The most unpleasant aspect of CG adventures is that movement and options are always limited by what sequences have been pre-rendered. EO attempts to break that by incorporating real time gameplay. This is principally for 3D corridors that link the sections of the AK-1, but there are also openplan service areas. Laura can't manipulate objects in these areas, apart from an energy weapon with which to protect herself from lurking real time presences. The intention is obviously to bring an unpredictability and tension to the game and it does. "


"games SIMPLE INTERFACE EN THEMES AND SKETCHES Wou SATURN EO, like D, has the simplest user interface imaginable. Laura will look at things, and you can get her to use them if possible. If a collectable object appears, she will automatically add it to her inventory. This can be brought up at any point as a series of icons, and a single command will see if they can be used in a particular situation. So the gameplay really relies on observation and lateral thinking. For the all-important musical score, Warpm usic, and characters themes. A CD of have turned to Michael Nyman, one of this is already on sale in Japan.

COMPRESSION ISSUES THE MOVIE CHANNEL What makes EO an interactive movie rather than just an attractively-drawn adventure, is dramatic visualisations given to events in the game. Laura is stunningly realised almost immediately do you forget she is nothing but a rendered image, she seems so real. The world isn't always viewed through her eyes, many of her actions are shown from clever angles and the camera positions a director would choose to create an effect. SHOCKING NEW HORROR ADVENTURE The amount of pre-rendered data created for Enemy Zero demands four CDs be used. Each of these has a capacity of 650MB, and even then JPEG compression and Warp's custom compression tools are required to make it fit. Warp claim the PlayStation cannot offer the same level of compression for the video to run in real time, and it will require 7 discs to bring the game to Sony's format. Whether Acclaim have the will let alone the permission to do this remains to be seen. IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO BURN Apparently, Warp are creating a very limited edition box set of Enemy Zero for the Friday 13th December launch. Around twenty of these wooden boxes will be issued, with the game and lots of exclusive EO-related materials from Warp. The cost of each? A cool $2000! NEXT MONTH... GET READY TO SCREAM! We already have a more finished version of the game here, which we're getting to know better in time for next month. Whatever your preconceptions about Warp's game, we can guarantee you'll be very impressed with the finished game. 43 "

Soon that reason will longer exist! TEMPEST 2000 PRECISION PLAY! n recent months we've found ourselves recommending people buy Atari Jaguars at the rock bottom price of fifty quid or less. How could we possibly endorse a machine that is, dare we say it, dead? Well, our only condition is that you make sure Tempest 2000 is free with it.  to own one of the greatest games ever made is bargain of the century! It's the ONLY reason Tom and Paul bought Jaguars (and at the time Paul bought his for !). Bizarrely though, the one thing that makes Tempest so brilliant is that it's designed specifically for the Jaguar hardware. The splashes of luminous particles, the warping oily effects and glowering wireframe graphics. We've never seen anything remotely like it on any other machine. However that's about to change. Tempest 2000 is coming to Saturn... When you first play Tempest 2000 you haven't a clue what's going on. Then, after a few hours play it clicks into place and suddenly you have the most addictive score game at your finger tips. You control the Claw which sits at one end of a 3D Web. Aliens crawl up from the far end in an attempt to get you. And you have to shoot them. A simple concept, but with 99 levels of increasingly lethal enemies it provides hardcore reflex testing action. All this precision gameplay looks to have made it onto Saturn intact. 3088 3184 206007 There's a variety of different shaped webs, some more difficult than others. That cross shaped one on the left, for example, is a real toughie! BONUS WARPS! LIVING COLOUR! JHL 30 3NO From the screenshots Tempest 2000 may seem graphically basic, but when moving it looks totally incredible. The stylish vectors of the antique original have been transformed into rave-laser effects drenched in blinding phosphoric explosions. Reproducing these pyrotechnics is surely a tough task for any machine without the Jaguar's custom hardware. However, the Saturn's polygon and sprite abilities have so far replicated the look to amazing effect. KICKIN' TUNES Tempest 2000's high-energy rave music was An essential factor to T2000's brilliance incredible. All the more so because it was was the warp levels. By collecting enough running off a Jaguar cartridge. Naturally, the : bonuses you gained access to these incrediSaturn can just play the music straight off bly hypnotic stages which allowed you to CD. So far only the first tune is in there, it's skip past levels. Gaining access to the a remix (as featured on the not so-perfectly : warps was a driving force behind the game done PC conversion) and we're not sure we and the visual effects they used were so prefer it to the original. But it's still excellent. : incredible, they should almost have been illegal! These stages have yet to be seen on Saturn and how they turn out will be essential to the game's success. 17500 29002 Toen NOOS INIWOJ Progressing through the levels, the enemies get more lethal. Electric sparks, UFOs, even reflective mirrors! Three Warps to enter the bonus level. How's it gonna look on Saturn? The unique vectors of the original remain, but now it's like a laser lightshow spectacular. Imagine the scores, messages, and explosions cascading out of the screen. That's Tempest 2000! NEXT MONTH... PD GET READY FOR THE STORM! 7857 22323 103368 2000 Perfectly converting Tempest 2000 is going to be a herculean task, However, the process is so far going brilliantly. And if it succeeds, Saturn owners will have one of the maost amazing games ever. Next month we hope to find out if it's so! "

S NBA: IN THE ZONE '97 NBA he first NBA: In The Zone game was released in March, at around the same time as Sony's Total NBA. While Konami's game is undoubtedly more fun to play, Total's graphics were enough to impress most basketball fans into buying that instead. This time, however, it's different. In The Zone '97 looks every bit as good as Total NBA, and plays even better than it did before! LIVE VINA Tonight's match up ARBA BULLS SONICS NBA NULAT Hus Select with directional button and press IT'S OFFICIAL! While nearly every basketball game carries the official NBA licence, they don't all boast that every player on the court looks just like their real-life counterpart. In NBA: In The Zone '97 however, each polygon man has got the correct face texture-mapped on him, making it even more accurate than ever! ALL-NEW FEATURES! Other new features include the players having stamina ratings, which decrease as they play. As you'd expect, players occasionally need to take time out on the bench to recover, adding more tactics to the way the game is played. You can also create your own team of players from any of the 29 NBA teams featured, or even make a new player totally from scratch!

The '97 version adds more moves and improves on the first game's animation, with the players leaning into their turns, stumbling and falling realistically, banging into other players and doing some really impressive dunks. Also, some of the more famous players perform their own custom moves! E RKE SOM SAIN THE There are lots of options to play around with once you've selected your two teams for the game. NEXT MONTH..

Last month it was PlayStation MK Trilogy, and this month we've got two more games! But this is the big one 64-bit Kombat! MORTAL KOMBAT RAIN WINS hen the Nintendo 64 was first announced, one of the most exciting ideas for a game was Mortal Kombat 64 — what would it be? Would it be 3D? Would it have new characters? The name of the game's now changed to Mortal Kombat Trilogy, and it's also been released on the PlayStation, so a bit of the excitement's gone but just imagine what a 64-bit version of Mortal Kombat could be... UNE 20 PUSR START SCORPION WINS N SECRET BONUS FATALITIES! Here's an interesting feature we've found!

Mortal Kombat Trilogy on the Nintendo 64 has got 26 playable characters from the beginning, plus 4 secret fighters. These hidden characters are Ninja Smoke, Khameleon (now a female ninja), plus Motaro and Shao Kahn. If you do your maths, you'll figure out that that's at least seven characters fewer than the PlayStation version. But by far the biggest and most confusing omission is that Sub Zero the most popular character in the game is completely missing! Is that weird or what? TRILOGY ENHANCEMENTS!

Take a look down the list, cross the blue ones off your note to Santa and put the red ones right at the top. Of course, most of the major Christmas games are already out Tekken 2, Formula 1, NIGHTS, Worldwide Soccer '97, Wipeout 2097, Virtua Cop 2, C&C: Red Alert, and the rest all of which you should already have on your list. As usual, there aren't many releases scheduled for January, but there are a few biggies, Dark Forces 2 and Dungeon Keeper on PC especially. Expect to see a few pre-Christmas releases slipping and joining them on the shelves in the New Year. Every games player, no matter what machine/ machines he/she owns, has a difficult task of choosing from the multitude of excellent games to get this month, but it's not exactly an unpleasant choice to make!

Of course, CVG will be there eating food, watching TV and playing games, and we'll hopefully have a report for you next issue (!). 21-23rd January 1997 Earl's Court, London This is the nearest that we in Europe get to the JAMMA arcade show in Japan. Last year, a few big arcade games were available to play before they were properly released, including Soul Edge, Tokyo Wars, Fighting Vipers, Virtual On, and lots of noisy one-armed bandits. Hopefully this year we'll finally get to play Tekken 3 (okay, it's not very likely), and try out all the games featured in last month's JAMMA show report!

Loco Anderson from Norfolk for his incredible idea for a platform game character: \"Minstrel Mantaray\". Minstrel can slap enemies with her wings or even shoot electricity from her tail. Great!

Andrew Davis from Suffolk for being so cheeky as to enter all three competitions with the most feeble entries we've ever seen. His Fighting Vipers character was Bertie Bassett (two sentences about him), his platform game character was too rude, and his Quake name is Jo Guest. Rubbish.

"computer video James STRATEGY BY WESTWOOD 28 Datum PlayStation  PRICE .99  PC CD-ROM VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 2 CDS  RELEASED BY VIRGIN TEL: 0171 368 2255 OUT NOW 1 PLAYER TM Stand up virgin soldiers, 'cause this is no drill! We're going to war and you've been enlisted for the front-lines. Attack! HIGHES UMMEN CVG RE ayStation COMMAND & CONQUER n war, there is no winner. Blood is spilled, innocent lives are lost and chocolate is practically impossible to get hold of due to rationing. But among the death and debris, war isn't all that bad. Starburst pyrotechnics are better than any firework, tanks never have the hassle of finding a parking space and everyone gets given a free gas mask! Better still, if you side with the GDI or Brotherhood of NOD, you get to experience the adrenalin rush of front-line fighting without so much as a battle scar, and even get to take control of some of the coolest weaponry around. Surely that beats signing up for the territorial army any day? DO AS YOU'RE TOLD! Troops aren't toy soldiers who will only attack when told. They're artificially intelligent and will engage an enemy unit if it comes too close, and even stand their ground when outnumbered. Units can be given orders other than attack too. Unarmed vehicles such as the Harvester can be given an armed escort to protect against enemy attack and troops can be ordered to concentrate fire on a specific spot, making it easier to set up ambushes on bridges and tight canyons. COMMAND & CONQUER MISSION CONTROL One of the obvious differences between the PC and next generation console versions of Command & Conquer is the control system, which was originally, driven completely by mouse. All that has changed, and now the joypad takes care of everything. It works surprisingly well too. While it's a bit slow to pick up at first, buttons can be configured to automatically switch between units, which speeds up the laborious process of manually flicking between troops and vehicles. CLICK AND CREATE Building up a base camp is a slow and costly process. Starting with the mobile construction yard, then a power plant to supply electricity. Ideally, a barracks is next on the construction line, to provide a means of defence. The Tiberium refinery is developed to ensure a steady cash income, by which time the basics have been built and it's time to concentrate on luxuries. Weapons factories and supply runways are capable of building tanks and other armoured vehicles, while defence lasers and attack helicopters are constructed to patrol and protect the perimeter of the HQ. Soon you could have an army as big as this. Coo. LGILERA TWO SIDES OF WAR Choosing between the Global Defence Initiative and the Brotherhood of NOD determines more than just the little guys' uniforms. They are essentially two different games, and, as such, come on two separate CDs. Side with the GDI and you're faced with the uphill struggle of fighting across Northern Europe, while the NOD must steadily progress through the Far East.

Nope, this baby is fast 'n' furious all the way, with real-time action and some wickedly difficult missions to complete. Thankfully it's not all trigger fingers and rocket launchers though, and success is only achieved by crafting a detailed battle plan and outwitting the enemy, while at the same time gradually building up your home base to ensure a steady supply of troops and vehicles.

This long-range cannon is extremely good at razing buildings to the ground and also nuking enemy tanks. The perfect anti-infantry weapon, the flametank may be slow but it's certainly hot-to-trot. Sheer brilliance. What was an exceptional title on the PC is now a brilliant console game, and one which offers more than its home computer counterpart. With more missions than ever before, especially as the PlayStation version features an extra 10 all-new objectives, Command & Conquer is crammed with enough variety to keep players engrossed. It's surprisingly accessible too, especially for a strategy game, and because the missions are well structured, novice players are gently introduced to the delights of war-gaming before going onto tackle some of the tougher campaigns. My only gripe is with the control system: anyone who's played the PC version will find the joypad less responsive than a mouse, and as such controlling your army is a bit slow and awkward. However, the quick command and short-cuts are easily enough to master, and with a little practice you'll be shouting orders like Stormin' Norman! 'Tenshun!

The PlayStation game boasts more levels, and also video play-back is also marginally better on the PlayStation. Oh well.

Right then B00!! Okay, so that wasn't very scary, but this awesome fright-fest from Gremlin most definitely is... ith the awesome phenomenon that is Quake continuing to clog up networks the world over, it's inevitable that other companies will attempt to cash-in on id's success with their own lacklustre 3D blasters. However, despite initial (and incorrect) impressions to the contrary, Gremlin's stunning Realms Of The Haunting is not one of those sad, under-nourished wannabes. Instead, it's a dark tale of suspense and horror more akin to an old-style graphic adventure, albeit one tarted up for the mid-90s with an impressive first-person 3D engine oh, and the odd spot of enjoyably bloody monster mashing... Call of the Haunting hypoaletan auto GOOD E-E-E-E-EVENING! Things aren't looking too bright for Adam Randall, ROTH's hero, as the the game begins. For a start he's been plagued by intense, recurring nightmares and even worse his dad, a vicar, has recently passed away in mysterious circumstances. Adam's investigations soon lead him to a manor house in the remote Cornish village of Helston. where he discovers that his father was dabbling in things best left alone. Before he knows it, Adam is on a quest not only to save his father's soul, but to prevent the world from being taken over by demons! ME BRAIN 'URTS! Don't be misled by the sexy 3D graphics and pointytoothed demons ROTH is first and foremost an adventure in the classic mould. As Adam explores the manor he collects various items which, if used at the correct time and in the correct place, will solve puzzles, open locked doors and reveal hidden secrets. The control system is superbly designed, and a lot friendlier than most. For instance, if you have the right object needed to solve a puzzle then you'll automatically use it, avoiding those tedious 'Use everything on everything until you get it right' situations. ARQUA RAQUI Look! Three health potions! Will monsters appear if I take 'em? Hmm, it's a possibility... REVIEW 56 "


"computer Video games ROM THE WRATH OF MY STAFF! As well as the nifty 3D engine, which lets you do Quake like manoeuvres and more besides (although the monsters are sprites as opposed to polygon-based), there's an assortment of 15 weapons for you to pick up and use against the 20 species of horny demons populating the manor's halls and chambers. BEHIND YOU! Unlike in Quake, Doom and all the other 3D shoot-'em-ups, the monsters in ROTH are used sparingly to spice up the adventuring. Typically they appear, swirling up out of the ground, screaming, just after you've solved a puzzle or picked up something useful so be cautious. Adam's no match for the dark hordes in a oneon-one fight, so you'll need to be quick and use your brain to survive! VIDEO NASTY! Kamyofte Heurizing Punctuating the first-person exploration sections are video sequences which mix real actors 'captured' against a blue screen with computer-generated backdrops. These pop up at key moments to help push the plot along, and are much better than those in other games for a couple of reasons: (a) they're quite well acted; (b) they're generally brief, so they don't hold up the action! REVIEWER 31 ROTH is arguably Gremlin Interactive's finest game to date. It's certainly their spookiest! The intriguing storyline soon drags you into the action, and the game is cunningly structured so that it always pushes you on towards the next shocking plot twist. The 3D engine, developed by the Micro Goblin's retro pin-up, Tony Crowther, is truly stunning, boasting some beautiful, atmospheric lighting effects, and best of all it runs fine even on a 486 (albeit in low res). The video sequences are brilliant too, setting the scene and moving things along nicely without ever getting intrusive or boring. My main grumbles are that the puzzles are occasionally a touch obscure and that the demons are a touch thick at times, unable even to navigate their way through an narrow doorway although there are times when your survival depends on this fortunate stupidity! However, these are just minor blemishes in an otherwise flawless adventure. DAVID UHAPURCA Who is the mysterious beauty who appears in Adam's fevered dreams? MUSO NIGH FIVE) i KAIM) RATING oft That post-pub curry seemed like such a good idea at the time, but now... And worst of all, the manor house's loos aren't working!

But here's Cool Boarders, straight after Namco's System 22 Alpine Surfer was released in the arcades, and even though this is controlled with a joypad rather than a full-sized board, it's a lot better! As the wise words on the box say, this certainly is an \"Exciting Snowboard Game!\" CHOOSE MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC SNOWBOARD LET'S MAKE A TRICK! Before each run you get to choose how your character looks, whether they're male or female, what clothes they're wearing and which board they're going to use. Looks make no difference to the way the game plays, but your choice of board does: Freestyle boards are slow but light and easy for tricks, All-round boards are a bit faster and a bit heavier, and Alpine boards are super-fast but rubbish for tricks, partly because they are flat at the tail. Choose wisely to win the cups! The main skill in Cool Boarders is learning to perform tricks. At set points along each course there are signs displaying the message \"Let's make a TRICK!\", which are your cues to start preparing yourself for take-off. When the jump button is held, your boarder crouches to power-up, during which time you must hold directions on the pad to set the speed and direction you twist. When in the air, the two R buttons combined with the pad initiate different grabs. If you land your trick, points are awarded by the robo-judges.

RECORE This is a good example of gameplay being better than graphics. While it doesn't look apalling, the pop-up and overall quality of the scenery isn't up to the usually high PlayStation standards. But and this is the important part it's loads of fun to play! The control of the board is excellent once you get the hang of it, with the drift on the snow being just right and the weight of the boards being great. The challenge of beating the best times and scores on each course requires some practice, and the rewards of new boards and an extra course are worth the wait. The tricks seem very basic to begin with, but after a while, you'll learn exactly how long to hold each direction and button to get the speed of the turns just right. It's a hard game to recommend that someone spends over  on, but is one that's well worth playing a lot to get into. If you don't mind that you won't be playing it for longer than a few weeks, get it.

What is it? Try weapons-packed technofrog aiming to destroy an evil empire bent on post apocalyptic world domination! Watonga! irst devised as a concept for the Mega Drive 32X, coders Lemon have taken their impressive voxel-based 3D routines to the Saturn to produce a stunning landscape, both over and under water! Various missions objectives are set in battle arenas ranging from the ocean to wastelands and cityscapes. Pursue escaping enemy vessels. Take down outposts singlehandedly. Locate some extremely difficult secret bits. Amok would appear to have it all! AMOK COOPERATIVE In this game mode, the missions objectives remain identical — there's just two of you teaming up to do the same job, only with a ramped up difficulty level. Very compelling stuff. DUAL-PLAYER FRENZY Not only does Amok have Doom's control mode, it's also very similar in its two-player action... only with a split-screen. Despite handling twice as much data, there's very little speed difference between this and the one-player game. AMOK NENE 1 Two-player mode features all of the detail of the solo-participant experience. And it's almost as fast too. Pretty good eh? Help each other out in this game variation. You get your obligatory range of different camera angles too. ONE-ON-ONE C Essentially the same as Doom DeathMatch. Two of you enter the arena. Only one leaves. The biggest difference between this and Doom is the fact that the enemy are still gunning for you too. REVIEWER I've been seeing this game in various forms of completion for literally years now and it's finally arrived in a finished form. Although initially a bit off-putting due to a tough difficulty level, Scavenger coders Lemon have handed in an excellently paced, highly enjoyable blaster, mixing the best bits from BattleCorps (ancient MegaCD game) with the controllability and two-player modes of Doom and its ilk. A bizarre combination that may not appeal to everyone, but it certainly appealed to me. Maybe not the super-release we would expect from the much-hyped Scavenger, but in the classiness and lastability departments, shooting fans are not let down. A very good blaster. REVIEW VOXEL CAVALIER Amok uses \"voxels\" to create its 3D landscapes. Polygons and texture maps are thrown out of the window, making for a blockier terrain. On the upside, it's a lot faster than polygons with little pop-up. Visual effects such as underwater haze and lens flare are included making for a graphical festival! SECRETS OUT  The secrets system in Amok basically involves shooting big mountains or walls and seeing if they explode. If they do, copious power-ups are yours. On later levels only high-power artillery exposes the weapons caches. RICA HEAVBETTER RATING TING Desert Strike meets Doom via BattleCorps. And it works. Saturn blasters in this league are extremely difficult to come by and the two-player mode is great too.  "

Now the sequel offers even more gun thrills! CREDITS 4 POLICE hen AM2 convert their coin-ops to console, they take the task seriously. For Mega Drive Virtua Racing, they incorporated a custom RISC chip (the Sega Virtual Processor) into the cart. So accurate was Virtua Fighter that it singularly sold the Saturn in Japan. Original Daytona, despite graphical shortcomings, remains possibly the most playable console racer around. And VF2 stands at least on an equal level to the best games ever. Then there's Virtua Cop. Forget that it was the first game to utilise AM2's graphics library. Forget that visually it's arcade perfect. What makes Virtua Cop such a phenomenal conversion, is that AM2 had to construct a gun with identical response time and accuracy to that of the cabinet, but that also worked on the lower resolution of a domestic TV.

Though I've played Virtua Cop 2 in the arcade a lot, I've never thought it was better than the first game, with the levels and enemy positions not being as cleverly set out. The graphics are fantastic for the Saturn-much closer to the arcade version than I thought possible but the sound isn't too good, with feeble gun noises. There's still a great score challenge, but I prefer to play in Virtua Cop 1 mode with the original's score multiplier.

As with Sega Rally and Virtual On the resolution is lower, but everything is there (glitchfree and it moves incredibly swiftly. The UK version only has minuscule borders too! I was concerned how appealing it would be with its different scoring system. However, the original Virtua Cop mode satisfies that need. As a conversion, it isn't as spot-on as the first game (which was totally spot-on!). And I don't think the levels are structured in quite such a perfectly graded way as the original.

As well as the regular Ultimate characters (minus Sheeva), this version features the three secret Kombat Kode characters (Mileena, Masked Sub Zero, Ermac), plus Rain and Noob Saibot from Mortal Kombat Trilogy! There's also a secret character box on the main select screen, and we've already discovered how to play as Ninja Smoke as well! FINISH THEM! As you'll notice by the number of characters, this isn't a standard conversion of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Another feature taken from Mortal Kombat Trilogy is that everyone can perform Brutalities! These massive and very complicated combos finish with your opponent exploding! Unfortunately, Animalities have been removed to make way for Brutalities. WINS: & 13 WINS: 00 CYRAX NOOB WINS: OS 99 WINS: 00 ULTIMATE MORTAL KOMBAT 3  BRUIALITY Fotch! ROUND 1 REVIEWER Use the arcade cheat to turn into Ninja Smoke at the start of a fight! WINS: O2 70 WINS: 00 RAIN MILEENA The surprising thing about UMK3 on the 16-bit systems isn't the quality of conversion that's as good as MK3 was but the way that it features things not in the original arcade machine, with added characters from Mortal Kombat Trilogy! There's quite a bit of speech missing to leave room for the moves, but the game plays pretty much the same as it ever did. Of course, most people with a Mega Drive or SNES already own at least one of the Mortal Kombat games, and want to know whether this is worth getting as well. If you've got Mortal Kombat 3 already, it would be pretty silly to get this too, as you're not getting much new stuff for your money. If, however, you've only got 1 or 2, Ultimate is well worth getting as good a conversion as you could hope for, loads of moves and characters, and it's good fun. Plus it's the fastest version around! EV LOMAS SNES UMK3 has got something missing from Nintendo 64 MK Trilogy Sub Zero! Plus this version's faster! MEIMA ALL THE MODES, TOO! IRATING RATING ) 44 16-bit UMK3 also includes the «4 Player 2 on 2 Kombat\" and \"8 Player Tournament\" modes from the arcade and Saturn versions of the game, as well as a secret tournament where each player picks a team of eight fighters (just like in Mega Drive and SNES MK3); and a new option letting you handicap one of the players to make the fight a bit more even. CONTROL CONFIGURATION VIOLENCE CONTROL The hidden tournament cheat is just the same as in Mortal Kombat 3. Don't bother if you've already got Mortal Kombat 3, but this is a surprisingly good conversion of the arcade with even more characters! 68 "

Presenting an oddball trio who are gonna cause some Pandemonium. D119 ANDPHONIUM WANOWOONVO latform games are going through a bit of a transformation at the moment, and 3D is the reason why. It seems 2D just doesn't bring home the bacon anymore! Don't say goodbye too soon however, because Pandemonium is here, a merge of 2D gameplay and 3D presentation, the results of which are quite spectacular! ................................. 231 LOST CAVE SERYER TO SWITCH PLAYER * MEET THE GANG * Platform games depend heavily on the main character it can make or break a game, right from the dizzy heights of a Mario, to the stinky low that is Cheesy. Pandemonium offers two main characters, with certain stages suited to their individual skills. FARGUS The court jester is accompanied by Sid the talking stick, who's voiced by TV funnyman Greg Proops. Fargus' main attributes are his speed, and his tumble roll attack which can defeat enemies without taking hits. A very nice waterfall, and yes, you can go through it. In fact, you have to! NKKI A friend of Fargus, who has a history of being an acrobat and later a wizard's apprentice, her special ability is the double-jump, which allows her to reach high places, you'll probably use Nikki more than Fargus. 2D OR NOT 2D REVIEW While most of the screenshots on these pages look like a sumptuous 3D explore-athon, believe us, this isn't Mario 64. There is no freedom of movement, instead most of the levels follow a set course, usually heading from left to right. Your character does frequently walk into the screen, but on the controller you're still pressing right. 70 "


"O 54 DO 37 'RAVELS WITH MY AUNT computer video games Difficulties can occur when trying to traverse some levels, as there are obstacles which affect the way you travel. For instance, later in the game, strong wind means you can only move in certain directions combine this with ice which makes you slide, and things get especially tricky. There are also tunnels and boulders, which are both featured on the levels with lava; whirlwinds, which can be used to your advantage in obtaining treasure, and clouds can be jumped on to gain some real height. Also dotted over most courses are trampolines to bounce around on. PlayStation The first boss. A giant mushroom. This lift takes you higher and higher. 079 CDO SO YOU WANT TO BE A BIRD * 31 Platform games are so alike, sometimes you feel like you've played one, you've played them all, and Pandemonium is no different in this respect. Power-ups are represented as magic spells; fireball, shrink, freeze and shields all of which are pretty self explanatory. At key points in the game your character may morph into a variety of different animals, each with attributes that are relevant to the levels they are located on. 0167 167 The winds mean you can only move in one direction. 30 30 00 00000 32 31 31 PANDEMONIUM Yippeeeeee! A really long icy slide. It's really fast too! 1 Enter these gates to turn into an animal. The frog can jump really high. 0228 222 Turning into the dragon allows you to fly and breathe fire. Avoid those bombs! I hate spiders, but jumping on their webs can be fun! stre sexe : s : s : 56 0228 29 EUDU 31 REVIEWER You need to 'fake jump' to get past these Cone Dudes. WHAT DO POINTS MAKE? 000 231 At certain points in the game, you're faced with the challenge of heading straight for the exit, or going for the extra booty. At the end of each level you receive a percentage rating for the amount of treasure picked up. Obtain a large percentage and you enter the bonus stage! Keep 'em peeled for hidden treasures, as sometimes defeating certain enemies will reveal extra bonuses. Also are hidden rooms, which are usually small sub-games where, again, you are rewarded with many valuables. This is a game that is going to receive very divided opinions. There will be some people taken in by the gorgeous graphics, and others, like myself, who will actually PLAY the game and realise there isn't masses of interesting gameplay on offer here. The game feels very empty, almost like it hasn't been finished yet it's missing a few vital elements to make it really great. The courses are basic and not at all large, so a real concern here is how easy the game is to finish. For your money you want something that is going to last, right? Not something you are going to finish on the first day's play. Finally the characters I find none of them appealing. From Nikki and Fargus down to the smallest enemy, you've seen them all before. It's a real shame for Crystal Dynamics, as they appear to be have really talented programmers. Next time at the bat they should spend a bit more time on the design. 1 Jumping on this plant reveals some bonus coins (seen on the left). 231 010 $31 REVIEW ALEX HUTALA IM SD THE TALKING STICK. DON'T RUB ME THE WRONG WAY! | RATING RATING 1 Above, is a very farout bonus stage! Can you dig it? Ed can! 1 Entering this pipe brings you into this little bonus room!

Time to join the lightstorm forces, and defend global democracy throughout the galaxy. ow come whenever something needs to be done you know, like protecting the rain forest, saving the world, defending the galaxy it's always left up to you? Maybe one day there will be a game where you just take it easy, while somebody else does all the dirty work. Anyway, let us enter the heavily contested genre that is the corridor shooter. That old galaxy needs defending! DISRUPTOR GO FOR YOUR GUNS As in all shooters, there's a selection of guns — from the piddly to the ridiculous. What Disruptor adds to this field though, is psionic powers. These abilities can be used to heal, shield, drain or destruct. SUICK TO Pomn010 PULSE BIETE FREQUENCI CANISTER PSIOT-SHOCK YOU ARE PHIL DAWSON! We couldn't believe the FMV in this game. Not that it's of outstanding quality or anything, but the fact that the character you play bears an uncanny resemblance to our old pal, ChimpanziMans! Pay attention to the FMV however, because this game has a plot with many twists and turns, and also holds clues to the next level. Out of ammo? Most commonNo problemo hit ly used, yet can 'em with this! still do damage. The pulse rifle makes a great sound. Pick up canisters to power up the rifle further. Psionic Shock hits 'em like a bolt. PSIONIC-REN ERODEAMOWE JI BLISTER PHASE REPEATER UNA CUCIONE DISRUPTOR The screen tints blue to indicate the healing. Throws out small bombs. Big, powerful, nice. The AntiMatter Blaster is like a shotgun... ...and this packs a mean wallop. The most powerful weapon... 1502 122: A rather attractive necklace. REVIEWER PlayStation owners in need of a decent blaster would be advised to buy this. Only if you're a fan of shooting games mind you, as Disruptor is unlikely to win over any new converts to the cause. The levels are big, and the 3D engine very smooth, with some heavy misting, however. All in all though, the whole feel and style of the game seem borrowed, especially the graphics. Certain levels are reminiscent of Dark Forces, while enemies are very unoriginal. Later levels require a little more strategy, as you only use psionic powers. And there is a storyline which does get interesting later on. Unfortunately for Disruptor this genre already has a reigning champion, and its name is Quake. ALEX UTTALA Being proposed to again. AUTO ROBOTICA Lots of the opponents throughout the game however, carry quite clever intelligence, seem very familiar, with enemies looking such as the homing droid which does identical to sci-fi movie stars such as the nothing until you shoot it once, then tries to Terminator or ED209 from Robocop. Some chase you until it detonates! MEIZED 100%; azz 9423 RATING RATING \"so50Unoriginal but attractive blaster, which will satisfy PlayStation owners until the next one comes along.

Retro fans prepare to get mistyeyed, the rest of you, stop laughing! Namco Museum Vol 3 t would appear Namco don't want Playstation owners to forget their Namco history. Either that or they can't think of any original ideas for games, but we would opt for the former. So here for your delectation is the latest in the Museum series six more games of old, or perhaps the good the bad and the ugly. Plus of course the virtual museum where you can view designs, graphics, original cabinets and lots more. Ladies and gentlemen, the Volume Three lineup! MS PAC-MAN (1981) DIG DUG (1982) Clear the levels of the occupants, dig tunnels to drop boulders on their heads, or use your pump to blow them up. Simple, yet fiendish, with a soundtrack that only plays when your character moves, an absolute classic. Another sequel, this time to the classic pill-muncher. NOW the star is Pac's girlfriend. Different layout of the levels means new techniques are needed. There's also the story of how Mr and Ms got together in between levels. GALAXIAN (1979) Blast the advancing alien craft in this classic shoot *em up. Original in its day for the way the enemy fighters attack by swooping down the sides of the screen. Still very addictive. 45. 6.28 . 21 RE NAMCO MUSEUM 3 LOUI 1 Yup, definitely some swooping happening here, and a yellow in a cover flank formation. TOWER OF DRUAGA (1984) POLE POSITION 2 (1983) f The virtual museum a cornucopia of information. Look out for Pac-man and his gang in the theatre. Follow-up to the popular racing original. Now with more complex circuits, and more frames of animation. Prepowersliding gameplay is still quite a challenge, as the bends appear from nowhere. Collect objects and negotiate cunning mazes to leave the level, avoiding the strange occupants of the Tower, including some very odd green blobs. A dodgy attack method prevents this from being fondly remembered. Good title though. REVIEWER TOP 100 TEADA. 99 SCON 5030 120k 1000 LINE SCOKLYY6O 13 WE. SPEED 247 Strange un-attractive green blobs. Another hit-and-miss compilation from Namco, with Galaxian and Dig Dug being the real stars here, and Phozon a nice surprise as I'd never heard of it before. The museum adds all the background info, even a cinema with Pac Man and his family in the audience! Once again this one's for the connoisseurs among you. What you're getting for your money is six more coin-ops from down memory lane, and with unlimited credit. A great addition to your collection, but not for everyone. ALEX 4WTALA PHOZON (1983) Obscure puzzler that has you catching objects that attach themselves to your cursor. The challenge being that the objects need to be arranged in a certain order, allowing you onto the next level. 040 RATING Great presentation, and some great games. But as before, you've got to have that taste for all things retro. 74 "

Drive your Ferrari Testarossa really fast through heavily congested roads, taking in the lush beachside scenery, as well as all the differing locations.

S SONT RE ARRIER SRCE 1989. gb TIME 60 SCORE 300660 LAP 090-60 80%BD e know some of you think all of these retro discs are stuff and nonsense. What's the point of playing something that's a decade old already? This is to all the non-believers if it wasn't for these games, there might not be a company called Sega today! Heck, there might not even be a games industry as we know it! Just thought we'd mention that to grab your attention and help you understand the heritage of the games on offer here. To cut a long story short, Sega have been around a looong time, and in the mid-eighties they introduced a breakthrough in arcade gaming Super Scaler sprite technology, which meant the scenery expanded as it got closer. In other words, it was great for 3D! In 1985 Space Harrier appeared, the rest is history, Sega Ages history. SEGAAGES BE SPACE HARRIER (1985) STAGE 3 AFTER BURNER VED AFTERBURNER (1986) REVIEWER Quite similar to Space Harrier in gameplay, as you just fly into the screen blasting. Only this time you're in control of a fighter plane equipped with the famed afterburners of the title, which can alter the speed dramatically. Still quite vomit-enducing, even without the hydraulic cabinet. 1 One of the most memorable soundtracks of The first coin-op to feature a all time! Magical Sound Shower is our fave. hydraulic cabinet, and the grandaddy to games such as Panzer Dragoon. There's not a lot more to say really, as all you do is control a guy with a big gun, who flies/runs around the screen blasting the strange assortment of aliens in his way. Ten years ago I would have given away a major limb to own any of these three 20160880 games. These days, maybe a finger or a  10000 toe. The major good news here though is the faithfulness to the arcade originals never before on a home format have there been versions to come as close. Yes, they were and still are classics, although to the younger gamer who has * never heard of these titles before, you should try before you buy. By today's standards the gameplay is basic, even repetitive, but for those of you who, like STORE me, dreamed of owning these machines, get this disc!

JAN RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS IM \"ER NINTENDO The fourth, and probably final, Super NES Street Fighter game. Is it the best yet? he biggest selling point for the Super NES when it was first released in the UK was that it had Street Fighter 2 on it. Since then, SF2 Turbo and Super SF2 have been released, so SNES owners have their fair share of quality fighting games. The question is, will any of them care about a fourth SF game? ROTIN STREET FIGHTER ZE-ALPHA! TWO! The introduction sequence is pretty impressive, and isn't really all that far from the arcade original! Listen out for the terrible dubbing of «Zero\" with \"Alpha\" when the voice shouts the game name! IT'S GOT IT ALL! 1 Rolento's pal strings Bison up for a super finish! Street Fighter Alpha 2 has all of the gameplay features from the arcade version of the game the super combos, custom combos, chaining hits, alpha counters everything! To make certain moves slightly easier to perform, those requiring three buttons to be pressed at once now only need two Zangief's Spinning Lariat and Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport, for example. 68 SAKURA REVIEWER 1 Sakura's in trouble here! Gen's custom combo will juggle her! 5000 39 SODOM'S NOT SODOM NO MORE! CHUN-LI ZANGIEF For some reason, Sodom's name has been changed to Katana in this US version of Alpha 2. In Final Fight, Katana was one of Sodom's gang and was armed with a massive katana sword, and we're not exactly sure why he's had his name changed in only the SNES game. Weird eh? Take a look at the screenshots and you'll no doubt be surprised at how well Street Fighter Alpha 2 has turned out on the SNES. Unfortunately, it doesn't look quite so good when it's moving, as LOTS of animation is missing. It's also pretty jerky and slow, but with a little bit of time you'll realise that it plays very similarly to the arcade! It's got all of the moves, as well as all of the counters, super moves, and combos, with nearly everything you've learned from the other versions working fine the only real problem is that it's hard to see what's going during a custom combo due to the lack of animation. SNES SFA2 has lost a lot of the impact of the arcade and 32-bit home versions, and certainly isn't as close a conversion as the original Street Fighter 2, but keeps everything else pretty much intact. This comes highly recommended, as long as you're prepared to take some time to get used to it. ED LOMAS 38000SA 5100  CHARLIE The cheat to access Chun-Li in her hidden Super Street Fighter 2 costume even works here!

WAR AND PEACE Grens GENSO SUIKODEN As Suikoden fits into the Action category of RPG, players should expect a lot of fighting like it or not, you're gonna get it! As soon as the hero and his friends step out of the safety of a village or city to explore the wilderness they are frequently set upon by the supernatural creatures which hang out there. In a battle situation there are several options available, one of which is to run away, or 'Let Go' as it is known. Of course it's always best to stand and fight. Moreover it's usually a good idea to hang around looking for trouble, as the more fights the team survive the stronger they become and the more likely they are to succeed against tougher enemies later on. It's all very exciting, in a way that only fans of RPGs would understand! Suikoden is an adventure with many, what can only be described as, philosophical lessons to preach. Before going on to discuss the battle system, and how treasure is found, the biggest issue in any RPG is the interaction between characters. It's what makes RPGs unique. For Suikoden Konami have chosen to make the dialogue quite extensive, to include the examples of humour or poetic statements which help players care more about the characters under their charge. Initially it feels like quite a chore having to read through so much text especially the very early scenes which centre around the hero's house. But as the plot thickens, and you realise there's perhaps more to these characters than you first suspected, you find yourself hanging on almost every word. 3pe. da iste I hope At this point the hero's party have been called upon to assist a village of elves who are being slaughtered by humans. Barbarians! Booh! are a reale The Chief of the Dwarves doesn't believe that humans could break into his impressive vault. So sets a challenge for the hero party to try and do so. Make sure that the charac ters you have working from the back row are those with long-range weapons, or have special attacks which allow them to leap forward. This way your team may occasionally make two attacks at once! One of the most impressive standard attacks comprises of two characters \"uniting to launch an attack on an enemy. Only a few characters are able to do this, so it's worth finding out who they are and who make the best combinations. Stallion Well, if it isn't chickenhearted Kirkis, who turned and rn when he found out the Imperial Army was attacking. You never know where you're going to meet up with important characters. REVIEW UNDER ONE ROOF Early in the adventure, the heroes recover an ancient castle from the clutches of a Dragon. The place is vast, and isolated by water ideal for home base. Once this is operational the task of seeking fresh blood to support the cause is begun. New recruits are found lurking in many locations, and don't always appear to be of obvious use. It's worthwhile talking to everyone in the towns and villages, as HQ requires cooks and quartermasters, as much as the army needs skilled fighters. 1 Up to 108 characters come under your charge. Decide who is best for each mission. Attacks enabled by magic runes are more powerful, and often defeat tough enemies with one blow. However they sap so much of a fighter's strength that they leave them \"Unbalanced', and therefore unable to attack for one turn At the end of a victorious confrontation, all surviving characters are awarded experience points which help to increase strength, speed, and luck, etc. Fallen team members (they are rarely classed as DEAD) miss out on the proceeds. 78 "


"games BIG BIGGER BIGGEST Aside from the usual battle scenario, there are two other types of fight scene to master. These two are less strategic, but nonetheless involve some sharp thinking to survive. FIELD BATTLE PlayStation Occasionally one of the key members in the hero party, a chap named Mathiu, calls the entire Rebellion to arms and a large-scale battle ensues. Here players may choose to employ the skills of the archers, magicians, or foot soldiers. The presentation here is pretty cute, as hundreds of defeated enemies float to the heavens with angel wings, and the tiny heroes change formation depending on the current strategy. More exciting than it looks on the page for sure. +6225 22 602 ONE ON ONE HONING TO PERFECTION A cked! 39 damage! Some of the more stubborn enemy leaders won't accept defeat, though their army is scattered before them on the ground! Rather than give in, these immensely strong generals challenge the leader of the Rebels to a scrap. The view changes to a close-up of the sparring ground, and energy bars are presented at the top of the screen beat 'em up style. Commands here are quite basic, but allow for some thrilling exchanges. And it ain't easy! In many of the most popular 16-bit RPGs for the Super NES to regularly replace weapons with new, more exotic types. Suikoden takes the view that each warrior's weapon is personal, and so is never abandoned. Instead there are Black Smiths based in most towns who's skill it is to hammer existing tools into shape. At first the service is quite cheap, but the more refined the job becomes, the more expensive the fees. Plus weapons can reach a stage which is beyond certain Black Smiths' capabilities, so the heroes are forced to go elsewhere. When both fighters go in for the attack, a lot rides on speed and luck. REVIEWER GENSO SUIKODEN BY THE POWER OF... Runes in this case precious stones marked by magic symbols enable the user to perform incredible acts of power. Employed separately these summon impressive magic, used to attack or defend. However Runes may also be attached to weapons, infusing them with similar dread properties. For this the party visits yet another specialist in a town or village. I doubt most players looking for their first RPG will be disappointed with Suikoden. It's everything you expect to find, and still more besides. The battle system is enjoyable, presented so that players can see the moves enacted before them, as opposed to a window showing just the enemy and no weapons (as in the Dragon Quest series). The narrative carries a fairly melancholy tone more often than not, which keeps your heart with the story while your head is required for thinking problems through. Grand-scale battle scenes, and one-onone fights add spice to the otherwise common formula Suikoden adopts. So generally the game is involving and the quest is huge enough to keep most play ers occupied for a couple of solid weeks at least. I have a problem with the fact that none of the furniture found inside most buildings offers any treasures, as this makes a lot of locations redundant it's so annoying to keep wandering into empty rooms. And for the average games player, this style of RPG might seem little different from the 16-bit examples they've been avoiding. Fans of this scene will have no problem acknowledging a skill tale, beautiful music, and involving fight action. PAUL DAVIES PMI nee REVIEW RATING RATING 1 Further into the adventure, the player's wits are tested by switch based puzzles (similar to the Zelda games) and moving platforms leading to key areas. One of the most ingenious is a roulette wheel, which offers forfeits or prizes. A fine RPG, benefiting from a clever plot and inventive approach to battles. Should be appreciated by fans surviving off 16-bit SNES imports. "

With a wacky new racer inspired by that off-road wonder the 4X4 truck! SEC CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE WON FINISH SINIS ough Riders 4X4 you can try to stop them! That's the whole idea behind Hardcore 4X4, a racing game with near indestructible vehicles. Racing over treacherous courses that would leave the normal car wrecked. Pot holes, rocks, snow and ice, even molten lava, all must be negotiated by your truck. Not only that but this is a race remember, and the other drivers are just as crazy as you. Get ready! LAP 1/3 4XA KNOW THE SCORE le lo LAP 1/3 The main point of this game is that it is a racer like no other. The six courses on offer are not speed tests, rather tests of tactics and skill. The six tracks include some bizarre locations. Even letting you race, in a Middle East war zone, and around an active volcano! The real trick of mastering these courses, is not to learn the corners, but the little bumps and dips that litter the course. Choosing a line through these hazards, as well as finding shortcuts should see you master the 4X4. BAD MOTHER TRUCKER There are six trucks on offer, each with different pros and cons. Should you choose a truck with better suspension, more grip or go for speed? Beginners should opt for a heavier vehicle with more suspension. Whilst experts having already mastered the tracks will go for more speed. The six vehicles have equally ridiculous names. Our favourites being the Bush Master and the Rock Hopper, a lovely big purple beast. Each of the computer opponents also has a relatively high degree of artificial intelligence. Late in the race, a badly placed competitor might take his anger out on you. By trying to take you out of the race as well! Do LAP 1/3 4xe UUU This course takes place around an active volcano! You also have the option to choose different weather conditions for your race. CHOOSE TRUCK Bush Master REVIEWER EME SLRP 3/3 95896 se non CHOOSE TRUCK Rock Hopper Hardcore 4X4 has carved itself a nice little niche in the market. Appealing to the race game fan who's tried everything, and is now looking for something just a little bit different. Not that this is your normal racer, the action is relatively slow with the trucks not going more than sixty! Instead, the player needs to think a little, and really learn the courses. Not everything is perfect here though. The Saturn version has a very slow frame rate, and the graphics can get quite messy. The PlayStation doesn't have these problems, but both games do suffer from the quality of the courses. Six might sound a lot, but they are too similar. Some different circuit ideas, or even a trick course (like in Wave Race) might have worked better. Don't get the wrong idea, this is still a good fun game, but not an amazing one. ALEX HUTALA GRUP 1 The in-game announcer shouts out comments like \"Awesome\" or \"Haaarrddcoooorrrrreeeee\"! LAP 3/3 REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL REVIEW Three modes of play are on offer. The single race, which allows you to learn the circuits in advance of competition. Championship, race all six courses earning ten points for first place down to one for trundling in last. The championship also has three different classes, from novice to expert. Last but not least, the time trial, where you try and beat your previous times on each track. RATING RATING GET READY FOR NEXT RACE CHAMPIONSHIP RACE RESULTS YOU HAVE FINISHED A different kind of racer, which is great fun while it lasts. But a lack of imagination in the courses prevents it from being a real contender. Hades Highway PACK KE SCRAMBLE 80 "

"computer video games PLATFORM BY RARE  PRICE .99  NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 32-MEG CART  RELEASED BY THE GAMES TEL: 01703 653 377 TM SUPER NINTENDO DEC NOW 1-2 PLAYER SUPER NINTENDO Just when you thought the Super NES had reached its limits with Diddy's Kong Quest, the boys at Rare prove us wrong again with another installment of monkey madness. he first DKC was a revelation, proving that the humble Super NES could still compete with its 32-Bit rivals. The second refined the gameplay of the original, and was near perfect. With such a successful formula, it must have been tempting for the developers to copy what they did before, call it DKC3, and stick it in the shops. However, rather than being complacent, Rare added new depth to the standard Donkey Kong fare, and included more twists than a David Lynch movie. DOUBLE TROUBLE A NEW KDDY ON THE BLOCK DOUBLE TROUBLE The Kongs may be the funniest characters to swing their way onto the Super NES, but they're a careless bunch. This time Donkey and Diddy have been kidnapped while on a banana binge in the jungle, and it's up to the glamourous Dixie to recover her chums. However, she's not alone. Joining her on this adventure is Kiddy Kong a big baby in a romper suit who loves bananas and throws tantrums if he gets into a tangle with a rogue Kremling. It's certainly interesting how this 280 pound nipper behaves when faced by a horde of vicious nasties! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! Another element from earlier DKC games which returns in DKC3 are the birds-eye-view maps connecting the levels. In this adventure players are given more freedom than ever before. Individual lands are connected by a huge world map which, after purchasing a boat from Funky's Rentals, the cheeky chimps can explore looking for secret caves. Certain parts of the map are sealed off by rows of stepping stones, and so the Kongs must find items and Koins which can be given to Funky so he can build them new vehicles to cross the barriers. MONKEY MAGIC As with earlier DKC adventures, the simian duo work together to solve problems. Kiddy's special powers include rolling across the ground like a bowling ball, crushing any nasties who dare stand in his way. He's also bulky enough to crush Kremlings which are too tough for Dixie, and has the muscle to throw her high into the air to reach bonus levels. As for Dixie, she still uses her ponytail spin to fly over deep chasms, and she can lift Kiddy to use him as a weight to break open holes in the ground. She can also balance on Kiddy when he's rolling to stay out of harm's way! Once visited, the Kongs may travel freely between locations on the world map. REVIEW Dixie and Kiddy demo a few of their latest and greatest moves for you. 82 "


"computer video games ON A ROLE PRENDS WILL BE FRIENDS Luckily, the Kongs are not alone in their and Squawks the parrot make a welcome quest. Hidden in barrels around the various return, accompanied by Parry the parallel levels are friendly animals on which the bird and Ellie the elephant. However, Ellie's Kongs ride to pass certain barriers. scared of Sneeks, so new paths must be Squitter the spider, Enguarde the swordfish found to avoid these dirty rats. The biggest difference in this game are simple RPG elements where the Kongs search for items to solve puzzles. The RPG element is represented by the Brothers Bear 12 grizzlies who are all on the horns of some dilemma or other. The problems range from having to find a cannonball for Bazooka Bear's massive cannon, or looking for a present for Blue Bear's birthday. Though the puzzles are simple, it gives players a chance to use their brains beyond their running 'n' jumping platform skills, adding new depth to the Kong formula, and making the adventure more involving than ever before. PENGUARDE FKLIE SUPER NINTENDO SQUAWKS Ellie can use her trunk to collect water, which she can shoot upwards to send airborne nasties into a tailspin. BAZOOKA BLIZZAR SPARRY SQUITTER BLUE BRAMBLE Parry hovers in the air above the Kongs' heads and collects treasures which are just beyond their reach. I WANNA GET YOU IN MY TENT BRASK Solve the puzzles to free the Brothers Bear. It's not too difficult, though it does help spice up the gameplay. Poor old Swanky's fallen on hard times, and is now running a side show from a flimsy tent! Here the Kongs enter another sub-game where tennis balls are thrown at targets which pop-up randomly. To make matters worse, the Kong's irritable Grandad, Cranky, reckons he's the best when it comes to fairground fun and challenges them to a duel! Should the Kongs win, however, Swanky rewards them with Koins which are used to buy items and clues from Barter Bear's shop. DRIUN ME BANANAS Another new element is the Banana Birds, which are scattered throughout the game. To release most of them the Kongs wander into a mysterious cave filled with coloured crystals. The crystals illuminate as a short tune is played, and players must repeat the sequence using the Joypad's colour keys. If the sequence is repeated correctly, a crystal shatters and the bird flies back to the Save Cave. By the way, finding all the birds is essential to solving the final mystery... Score as many hits as possible in the tennis ball range, to teach Cranky Kong a lesson, and walk away with some useful prizes. DOUBLE TROUBLE REVIEWER 20 HEN LISTEN... D YA WANNA KNOW A SECRET As the release of the N64 looms, DKC3 represents the pinnacle of achievement for the Super NES. Graphically, the game is attractive as ever, the fluidity and quality of animation remaining flawless, some of new nasties and bosses also being the most imaginative in the series. The RPG elements also add a new intensity to the game that was lacking in the past, giving welcome relief from the plat. forms and calling on other gaming skills besides reflexes. Kiddy is an excellent new character, his unique skills meaning that players must carefully consider which Kong to tackle certain challenges with. In all honesty, this game deserves a High Five but, because the majority of the game's style has been seen before, it gets a four. Hang on to your Super NES! PAUL DAVIES Stretching over 40 levels, DKC3 is a massive game which will keep players occupied for a long, long time. However, recovering the kidnapped Kongs isn't the end of the line for Dixie and Kiddy. The game features two completely different endings, and rescuing your chums only accounts for around 50 per cent of the adventure! There's a secret world to discover, and finding all the Banana Birds unlocks another secret. Two adventures in one brilliant package... can't be bad, eh? REVIEW RATING A beautiful, funny, exciting and intelligent platformer that will keep all Super NES fans glued to their consoles this Christmas. "


"LLEN computer video games 033, AKIRA SARAH FIGHTING BY SEGA MEGA DRIVE  PRICE .90  ARGADE AND SATURN VERSIONS AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 16 MEG GART RELEASED BY SEGA TEL: 0181 006 4620 JAN RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS NGGA JRIVE The best 3D fighting game around is having a go at taking over the 2D fighting game market! he Virtua Fighters have become some of Sega's most popular games ever, so it's quite surprising to find that there's not a version of the game on their most popular home console. At last that's changing, with a cut-down cross between Virtua Fighter 1 and 2 just completed. Of course, a lot of compromises have been made to translate one of the most complex 3D arcade games onto a basic 16-bit machine, but it sure looks great in the pictures!  MEGA DRIVE 2113 * ROUND 2! FIGHT! I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR NEXT BOUT! While the name of the game is Virtua Fighter 2, it's not quite got everything from the arcade game. For a start, the two new characters Lion and Shun are missing completely; plus not all VF2 moves are in the game the counters are missing, plus most of the new attacks. Mega Drive VF2 is probably nearer to VF Mini on Game Gear in terms of number of moves. At the end of each fight, there's now an end screen where the winner insults the loser, much like in the Street Fighter games! Some of the quotes are completely made up for the new game, but still made us laugh! MEGA DRIVE 02 WINNER WINNER PLAYER SELECT 14 ROBO-WOMAN RETURNS! REVIEWER AKIRA JACKY 3200CM When playing the game through in Arcade Mode, you need to face Dural as a bonus stage at the end of the game! As with the Saturn version of VF2, she can perform all of the other fighters' attacks! While the Player Select screen is the same as VF2's, there are two characters missing. 7.16 * OUTSIDE, NOW! To make up for the fact that certain backdrops are missing, those that are in the game have a few variations each. For example, Jeffry's beach stage, can be played during the day or in the evening. The backdrops look very similar to the Saturn versions, and the ring even moves in 3D parallax to make a great effect! I love the Virtua Fighter games, and a Mega Drive version is something I've been looking forward to. In still pictures it looks great but, as with Street Fighter Alpha 2 on the SNES, it doesn't move all that well. Turning the motion-captured 3D models into animated sprites isn't an easy job, but Sega have done it about as well as we could have hoped, picking out all of the most important frames to make the moves look similar to the originals. One particularly excellent part of the game is the music, with the brilliant original tunes converted very well to the MD's sound chip (although the sound effects are pretty rough). The controls are the same as the Saturn version, and all of the PPPK combos work but without the all-important floating combos it becomes a very different game. Unfortunately, while VF2 Mega Drive is a nice novelty to own, it's just not all that good when compared to other MD fighting, games the Street Fighters and Mortal Kombats are all better. CP IMAS BONUS Sd 20 BETTER REVIEW RATING \"GRAAAHHHHH WEDENGHCHCKT [VF2 MD SOUND EFFECTS 1 Sarah's stage at sunset looks nice. A bit of a novelty for Virtua Fighter fans, rather than a seriously good fighting game. Entertaining for a while, but far from essential. 84 "

VIRTUAL-ON PROJECT COMPLETED... CYBER TROOPERS APPROACHING... POWER: UNKNOWN37? EXCITEMENT: GUARANTEED!! CYBER TROOPERS LION he one-on-one duel! One of the most popular elements of videogaming. The chance to pit your skill against that of another human... and prove yourself superior by whooping them senseless! It seems we've made 'versus modes' out of every conceivable form of game fighting, driving, puzzle, sport, running around corridors with guns. However, AM3 have introduced Japan to an all-new concept in duelling between city-sized humanoid robots armed with futuristic weaponry! We say Japan, because out there Virtual-On is an arcade craze, while here it's relatively unknown! Have we too never dreamed of sitting in the headmounted cockpit of a Megazord or Transformer? Do we not trust the makers of Last Bronx, Sega Rally, Athlete Kings and Baku Baku to produce lethally addictive versus games? If you've answered 'no' to any of the above questions, read what follows very carefully. Because it's about time we educated you in one of the mightiest versus challenges ever created! HIGHES ENDAT PG BE COMME KOPAL 485FLRYER 72sz CLASH OF THE TITANIUMS! It's a familiar game concept select a fighter, face an opponent in a ring, defeat them by draining their energy bar. However, Virtual-On introduces it on an epic scale. The arena is massive and filled with structures to hide behind. With close-combat no longer the only practical option, high-velocity weaponry is standard. And because you control robots not humans, super-running, super-jumping and super-fighting are the norm! Such is the magnitude of V-O's combat, that the coin-op uses two Model 2 boards one for each player! The cabinet is also divided into two cockpits separated by a screen. This is the kind of deadly-serious duel AM3 have brought to the Saturn! TOTAL UT LASI Weaponry on an megolithic scale is the trademark of V-o! That and monsterous robots the height of tall buildings! THE TWIN STICK VIRTUAL-TERNATIVE! Part of the arcade Virtual-On experience involves mastery of its Twin Stick controllers designed to allow complex control of your Virtuaroid fighter with superfast ease! Bringing these sticks into the home is the kind of behaviour we've come to expect from perfectionists like Sega. However, they're only being released in Japan. At  a set, Sega consider them too expensive to appeal to Western gamers. Hardcore Sega-fans will of course obtain the Sticks from importers anyway! REVIEW Even in Japan the sticks will prove too pricey for most, So AM3 have put considerable thought into optimising the normal Saturn pad. There are five different pad configurations built-in, plus a pad-edit option. One of the set-ups even mimmicks the Twin-Sticks, with the X,Y,A,B buttons forming a second D-pad. However, this is quite confusing. The best is Type A which, once you're accustomed to it, proves highly controllable. So NO the Twin Stick is not essential!

FIFA '97 is supposed to be a step up from FIFA '96 in that the characters are now 3D motion-captured models (with motion from David Ginola, no less), rather than the blocky sprites of previous games.

This month we have the Nintendo 64 version for review, and can say straight away that it's worse than the PlayStation version. The most immediate and important difference is that it's got 7 characters fewer than the PS, and that's including the four secret fighters. There's also a noticeable lack of animation, making some moves and Fatalities look silly. Plus, the sound is terrible very fuzzy speech and effects, with \"beepy\" music. The game plays just the same as it did on PlayStation, thankfully, only it's slightly harder to control with the N64's joypad (don't even try it with the 3D stick!).

So I reckon there's even less chance for X2. That there are far better blasts on the Super NES and Mega Drive doesn't help. Super Aleste, Parodius (SNES); Zero Wing, Thunderforce IV, Hellfire (MD) any one of these offer more intelligent, well balanced gameplay than X2. Attention spent rendering, and animating the slick space craft, should have been concentrated on devising masterful set-pieces for players to struggle their way out of. Enemy routines are dull, and the BOSS ships are tedious. Flashy effects only add to the game's problems by creating confusion, and with two players on screen that situation becomes ridiculous.

Because of this the game does lose its challenging appeal a lot. Providing you don't save the game every time you take a step though, you'll still get a tight adventure.

Gretzky uses all the buttons ton the pad, which, for a fast moving game, makes things pretty fiddly. Also there isn't a choice to select your line a minor point, I know, but one which highlights the major flaw in this game: The emphasis in Gretsky 3D is of arcade gameplay rather than realism.

"VRESS START computer games video ARPAVE ME 206005 MARVEL COMICS FIGHTING BY CAPCOM TM OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYER  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  DISTRIBUTED BY ELECTROCOIN C P-SYSTEM II UPRIGHT CABINET ew to the arcades this month is an almighty new Capcom fighting game: X-Men Versus Street Fighter an outrageous blend of the measured tactics of the World Warriors, and the OTT onslaughts as witnessed in Marvel Superheroes. As ever, Capcom have honoured their tradition with a great playing coin-op. X-Men Versus Street Fighter may initially cause fans of one particular fighting style some concern especially die-hard SF players who like their fighting clean and precise. However everyone we know has become a convert. And we know you'll love it too. So here's an explanation of how it all hangs together, courtesy of Capcom. MARVEL COMICS X-MEN TM&(c)1996 MARVEL CHARACTERS.INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED (C)CAPCOM CO.,LTD.1996 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED * TAG TEAM FIGHTS X VARIABLE HERO BATTLES MORE MAYHEM THAN YOU CAN HANDLE! The most important new feature of X-Men Vs SF is that this is a two characters vs. two characters battle. It's still a two player game, but now each player has to hand-pick a team of fighters. The team's don't have to be solely X-Men or Street Fighter characters! You can have any combination of fighters you desire! However, you can't have two of the same character. These are tag team bouts however, so you don't usually end up with all four characters on screen at once. Another big revision from the old style of Capcom beat 'em ups, is the disappearance of the number of rounds per bout. No more best of three! Not that the game loses anything because of it. Each bout is now one round, because you are controlling two fighters, the fight usually lasts about the same amount of time as the old three round system. PEESS START ESS, START X-Men Vs SF uses what Capcom are calling the \"Variable Hero Battle\" system. That's just a fancy name for the way you can exchange your characters during the fight, it is tag team remember? What is evident, is that this system is definitely going to appear in new Capcom games, as the switching of characters adds lots to the tactical game play. If you think all this switching of characters is going to slow the fights down, don't be fooled, it all happens incredibly fast! Here's the breakdown of the different ways to exchange your fighters. LSS START BHIT * VARIABLE COUNTER Press strong punch and strong kick while moving the joystick from back to down. Your present on-screen character must be guarding against an attack before you perform this move. It also costs you one level from your Super Combo metre. That's Rogue crossed off the list until next time. That's gotta hurt! TAGE 02 CODE RED * VARIABLE COMBINATION Again press strong punch and strong kick while moving the joystick from down to forward. This move costs two levels from your Super Combo metre! This is what you get for those two levels though: your resting partner leaps in, and then both of your characters will perform a Super Combo! Here's how tag team looks from the initial select screen. And here the Juggernaut/ Magneto team face off. ARCADE VRESS SIAN * VARIABLE ATTACK OTEST HR Press strong punch and strong kick at the same time. Your resting character will leap onto the screen, they'll do a quick pose for a second, and then take over the fight from your other character. If the character you were using was in the middle of an attack, it's cancelled! This cancelling of the attack can be used as a great defensive tactic. I have studied Yoga: you have studied aothing. 92 "

The benefits of mixing the X-Men and Street Fighter characters are the amounts of extra new moves. Some Street Fighter connoisseurs may argue that this plays more like X-men or Marvel Super Heroes, and they'd probably be right. These new moves do serve a purpose, and that is to match the fighters from different licenses. So you get a much fairer fight. 2300 24UU START SAS UNCANNY CAPABILITIES! * GROUND: All the fighters can perform dashes on the ground, by either moving the joystick twice in the desired direction, or pressing all three punch buttons.

However there's no form of Ring Out! For example, Jeffrey's stage (which we know is in there) is an ongoing beach! Only two arenas have been visually revealed.

INTENDO 64 BOOST SHIELD HITS CENDO 64 SHOOT 'EM UP BY NINTENDO 99% COMPLETE  PRICE V9800  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SNES PREQUEL AVAILABLE STORAGE 96 MEG CART PLUS MEMORY BACK UP  RELEASED BY NINTENDO  TEL: N/A MAR 97 RELEASE 1-4 PLAYERS It wasn't planned for us to dedicate two solid pages of New Games to one N64 game this month. But after seeing Star Fox 64 in he series which launched the Super action at Shoshinkai, we just had to show an incredible new dimension for you the amazing progress it has made. x 3 he series which launched the Super NES into an exciting new era, opens an incredible new dimension for Nintendo 64. Like the other NCL titles, Star Fox 64 isn't just an advancement in graphic style, it pushes the new 64-bit environment as far as possible at this early stage. Also significant for its use of the new Jolt Pack accessory, Star Fox 64 should become another essential addition to an increasingly varied collection of original 64-bit software. STARFOXG  Nintedo 1996 OO A NEW TAIL O HELD Those of you familiar with the first Star Fox (Star Wing) game may want to know how the plot has developed. Well, Fox McCloud is once again assigned by General Pepper of the Cornerian defence force to combat the evil doings of evil Emperor Andross. After being deported to the planet Lylat, Andross raised an army against the planet's native people. He must be stopped! els WING, EAR. AND BEAK MEN STELD ALUST DUR NEWS NINTENDO 64: FAMICOM SPACE WORLD 1996 STARFOX ARTRACK? Like the ARWING this tank employed by the CDF has the ability to roll from side to side for evasive purposes. This completely new element to the Start Fox universe looks like being a lot of fun. Wonder if you can upgrade that cannon same way as the ARWING lasers? Besides honouring its hero, the name Star Fox refers to the team which McCloud is a part of. It's important to know who his fellow defence force members are, as they play an integral role in the game they're not just background fantasy. As with the first Star Fox game, Slippy Toad, Falco Lombardi, and Peppy Hare join Fox in the skies as wing men. Throughout each mission the entire team are seen handling their own situations, occasionally passing close to Fox's own ship. It's highly likely that we will see similar situations to last time, where a team mate runs into trouble and needs Fox to save them, or gets quite angry when Fox bags an enemy fighter in someone else's sights. BUST SAMELD LIIT! x 3 The addition of a radar scanner helps Fox get a handle on the situation. On here the position of his team and that of the enemy fighters is shown. 7-7.7777 STARTOX ROCKET-FUELLED SUCCESSOR xa For a tank this vehicle seems to be incredibly light, as it has great manoeuvrability. NASL The ships flown by the Star Fox team are called  NINTENDO ARWINGs. In the first game these were reputedly prototype models, but the design is evidently finalised now. Obvious improvements include the addition of a funnellike sight system, similar to that used in Sega's Panzer Dragoon. Once again it is possible to barrel roll out of danger, and in doing so repel most enemy missiles, but this time the ARWING is seen to briefly cloak itself with a shield. How many VR modes are available isn't certain just yet, but once again it appears In the original Star Fox, the Asteroid Belt and Armada that only certain missions are piloted stages were the only ones viewable from inside Fox's ARWING. from Fox's eye-view, inside the ship. Am The tank stages offer a strong contrast to the ariel exploits of the ARWING fighters. 96 "

EDUEILD Up to four players may take to the skies at once in Star Fox 64, though only in a Battle Mode scenario. The landscape here is relatively flat, with few obstacles, as the emphasis is on hunting your opponents. Each player's ARWING fires a different coloured laser (red, green, blue or yellow) to distinguish them. Rules are kept nice and simple last ship remaining wins and there may even be a 'kill' count variation in the finished game. In the first instance players may join in at any time.

"and The Computer and Video Games FREE Pull-out Guide January 1997 Christmas computer d) ganes FREEPLAY Issue 9 READERS MOST WANTED CHART stop press VIRTUA FIGHTERS AND FIGHTING VIPERS — IN ONE GAME!! I want, I want, sometimes gets. Vou read it correctly! AM2 are releasing an all-new beat 'em up featuring ALL their Saturn fighting game characters to be released into the home before Christmas in Japan! Fighters Megamix is its name and following weeks of growing rumours about a major Sega secret the news was finally officially broken at the Sega Winter Power Up conference in Japan. Sega's head of R&D, Yu Suzuki, announced that it would be AM2's hottest title for this winter. He also stated that not only would the game feature all the characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers (that's 22 in all, including BM and Kumachan), it would also include the Virtua Cops as well! All manner of incredible new features have been included. Most notably, elements of Virtua Fighter 3! The VF2 characters will now be able to use some Virtua Fighter 3 moves, while the Fighting Vipers have some all-new moves of their own. The game will also feature the Escape button from Virtua Fighter 3, allowing all the characters to side-step left-or-right to avoid attack! Although the characters are at least on the surface crosscompatible, there's obviously some questions over how their fightingstyles will be affected, most notably with regard to the armour and walls. It's been revealed that the Virtua Fighter 2 characters will not wear body armour. They WILL however, have armour-breaker moves like their Fighting Viper counterparts. An important feature of Fighting Vipers was the mid-air recovery, allowing them to land on their feet. The Virtua Fighter 2 characters will now have this ability too. As with regard to the walls, this really comes down to the stages in the game. Fighters Megamix will feature stages from Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers AND updated original Virtua Fighter ones. All-new levels are also promised. For the Fighting Vipers stages, there is the option to switch off the wire-fences, walls and ring outs. The graphics are also a point of discussion. Virtua Fighter 2 used the Saturn's super hi-resolution mode. Fighter Vipers, although at a lower resolution, used light-sourcing and gourard shading. Which of these graphical elements will be employed has yet to be revealed. It's also unknown whether the characters will sport new costumes. There was a restriction on AM2 revealing any pictures of the game before we went to press. However, the game is scheduled for a December 21st release in Japan, so expect masses of information next' month. What's more, its set for a spring release over here! Virtua Fighters, Fighting Vipers, Rage and Smarty in one game! What more could you ask for? 1 NINTENDO 64 IN BLIGHTY 2 VIRTUA FIGHTER 3 ARCADE/SAT 3 TEKKEN 3 ARCADE/PS 4 STREET FIGHTER 3 ARCADE 5 MORTAL KOMBAT 4 ARCADE 6 VIRTUA COP2 SATURN 7 QUAKE PLAYSTATION 8 TIME CRISIS PLAYSTATION 9 RESIDENT EVIL 2 PLAYSTATION 10 STREET FIGHTER EX ARCADE/PS Your other pathetic demands include Daytona 2 on Model 3 (see main news), free PlayStation games, to sell my PlayStation (not from any of us), a Capcom joystick, Amiga to become good again (hahahaha), Chicken Pot Pie (?), the ultimate Sonic game and a 128-bit CD-based console that is unfaultable'.

If current rumours are to be believed, Sonic the Hedgehog and the VF Kids could be in the game too. Oojima! SINCREDIBLE NEWS! RED-HOT FACT/ RUMOUR MILL! GAMEBOY CREATOR STARTS OWN COMPANY A few months back we reported that Gumpei Yokoi, the inventor of Gameboy, had mysteriously left Nintendo. At the time there was speculation that it was related to the poor success of his Virtual Boy. However, now he has reemerged with his own company, and his products may well be released through Nintendo! The company, called Koto, is the result of Yokoi's desire to bring out more of his ideas. He says that as Nintendo became a bigger company it could only bring out major products. And he has accumulated many ideas in his 30 years with the company, which he now wants to turn into working products. The company already has six products in development, with the first set for release next June. No details have been revealed, although Yokoi has stated that none of them are N64, Saturn or PlayStation-related. However he has mentioned that one of the projects is based on 'high-level technology developed for the military, which could now be used for the equivalent of around a pound'. Leading to speculation that it could be coin-op hardware. As soon as we know more about Koto's projects, we'll tell you. 1 News/Readers charts 2 Official Charts 3 Retro .

"computer video games WDEO GAMING Dowe kebelly Retro Computer that the voices sound really rough and computery and not just a pooey old sample. By the way, Intellivoice came bundled with all machines during its demise and are quite cheap to pick up nowadays. hew! What with the brilliant HMV retro exhibition, my anniversary T-shirts and this months awesome book by Paul Glancey, retro fans have never had it so good. In fact old games are getting even harder to find as more and more people are snaffling up retro bargains. Nevertheless the MicroGoblin's hunted down some real treats for you this issue! It's a sin that I haven't mentioned at least one Jeff Minter game yet, as he designed some of the most acclaimed Atari and C64 games of their time. Apart from his most famous games ATTACK OF THE BANUES'EX$4 89 MUTANT CAMELS, IRIDIS ALPHA and SHEEP IN \"SCORE? 00002000 SPACE, I was always a fan Jeff Minter loves Lamas! He of BATALYX. It's basically a used to keep one in his back yard. collection of five games HALLUCIN-O-BOMBS, AMCII, THE ACTIVATION OF IRIDIS ALPHA BASE, CIPPY ON THE RUN, SYNCHRO II and a pause mode that contained a simple form of PSYCHEDELIA a light synthesiser. I won't bother explaining the scenario as with all Minter games it's best to just play it. Be prepared for the full contingent of mad shoot em up mayhem and weird sheep/Llama action that was the basic ingredient in most of his games, and don't blame me if you're disappointed! You either loved or loathed a Minter game! Jeff went on to write a load of ST games and a couple of years back programmed TEMPEST 2000 for the Atari Jaguar which is THE reason to nip out a pick up a machine while they're going cheap! Talking of Jaguars-I just can't understand that with such a briiiiiiiiiliant back catalogue of games, Atari have released hardly any for the Jag. Imagine a machine that let you play arcade perfect conversions of 720\", ROAD BLASTERS, MARBLE MADNESS, STAR WARS TRILOGY, INDIANA JONES, I ROBOT, XYBOTS, MOON PATROL, CRYSTAL CASTLES, PAPERBOY etc... I'd buy ten!!! COSAT STAR THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK Now I'm sure that all you Star Wars fans are looking forward to reading about the new N64 SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE game due for release around Christmas, but in the meantime there's a Banthaload of old stuff to get through. Of course there's the 'seminal' vector-based arcade and computer versions-apart from poor old Return Of The Jedi that ended up as pseudo-3D thing. But what I've been sniffing around after is the stuff that Parker did on the Atari 2600, Phillips Videopac and Mattel Intellivision. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was based on the classic battle scene over the planet Hoth and required you to pilot your snowspeeder into battle against the gigantic Imperial Walkers. The aim of the game was to knock out all five walkers before they blew up the power generators at the rebel base. JEDI ARENA on the other hand was the first video game that gave the player control of the light-saber as you moved the paddles around to deflect a droid thingy onto your opponent. All Star wars games are worth collecting for the added bonus that some daft fan is bound to offer you a fortune for anything that bears the 'holy' licence. (Yes... me.) THE MATTELIMBIMIS ONVIDEOGAM una In 1985 EA/Ariolasoft released a load of Construction Set games for the Commodore 64 and I had the good fortune to pick up a couple at a recent car boot debacle. RACING DESTRUCTION SET is a brilliant split-screen computer slot car racing set for two players. There are 19 worldwide Grand Prix circuits built-in, as well as 8 vehicles to choose from, including a stock car, a lunar rover and a dirt-bike. All this and an easy to use construction set that lets you create your own racetracks complete with jumps, hairpins, hills, ice and dirt AND the ability to unleash weapons on your opponent in two player mode AND four superb environments including pop art and moon craters AND oh, just loads of brilliant things that I don't have enough space to spurt on about. If anyone wants to flog me the disk version then the dosh is waiting cos my cassette multiload version is a real nightmare. This game MUST be updated and released EA... it would be awesome! The other title picked up was PINBALL CONSTRUCRACING DESTRUCTION SET TION SET that lets you easily design even comes with 50 ready-made your own pinball tables via the really tracks. A few of which are based cool icon driven menus. The two examon real circuits. ples that come with the package are DAVID'S MIDNIGHT MAGIC and NIGHT MISSION that show off what can be done if you put in a bit of effort. Other titles I recommend you look out for are ADVENTURE CONSTRUCTION SET that lets you create your own graphic adventure and MAIL ORDER MONSTERS where you get to create your own monsters, add weapons and supplies and send them into battle to fight with other computer monsters or a friend's. AWESOME eh! Snap 'em up quick cos STAR WARS fever is about to set in. Get hold of the Intellivision 'Talkies', cos they sound ace! Janndwo mouzas I'm going to quickly mention SPACE SPARTANS which is one of the rare games that made use of the Intellivision's Intellivoice Voice Synthesis add-on. It's a pretty standard STAR RAIDERS type affair but the speech is briiiiiliant and well worth buying the cart for (if you can find one). Male and Female computer voices warn of impending doom and respond to keypad entries concerning the ships status etc... What I love the most is Before I go I must mention that if you're lucky enough to have cable TV, go to the games bit in the main menu and load up Q*BERT cos its a pretty faithful conversion! WIN A COPY OF WILLIAM'S ARCADE CLASSICS! Here's your chance to win a free copy of WILLIAM'S ARCADE'S CLASSICS courtesy of GT Interactive. This is THE release that will finally make me buy a PlayStation this Christmas. It's awesome, cos not only to get to play arcade perfect copies of some of the greatest games ever made but you also get to snoop around all the original art and listen to the programmers having a natter about the good old days.

FreePlay, Computer & Video Games, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London, EC1R 3AU. FESTIVE FREEPLAY FAN as FFVII on PS». And \"can Saturn really do this? We want to see it running before we believe it!\" is totally unacceptable. All I can say to you is how dare you use the power of the press to fool the public into believing your preferred machine is the more powerful. Maybe EMAP should have ditched you instead of the excellent MAXIMUM. At least they acknowledged the fact that although there were some terrible looking games on the Saturn it wasn't the Saturn, but the programmers and development kits as the stated in a caption in their preview of the amazing Panzer Dragoon Zwei \"in the right hands the Saturn is a machine of unmatchable power\" quoted from No. 5 rest my case. Tolouse Montage, South East London. It was excellent. I bet that if it were to be released on Saturn it would sell loads. Oh yes, now on to X-Men. So what if the PS didn't get it. Look at the PAL version, Acclaim couldn't be bothered about the borders or the speed. Before I say sorry to Saturn owners I just want to say Tobal No. 1 in my eyes is better than many Saturn beat-em-ups (and it's FULL 3D). Oh yes Final Fantasy VII (enough said). Anyway, sorry to all you Saturn owners, you have a great machine with some great games (especially NIGHTS). Yours Daz. C+VG, After four years of loyalty and enjoyment towards your once fair and exciting magazine I have the misfortune to write in to you in a negative tone. Having purchased the Dec 1996 issue of your magazine I was shocked and outraged to find subtle tones of biased behaviour towards the Sony PlayStation. Sure I've come across them before, but after reading your Tomb Raider review have decided that you have gone too far this time. Tomb Raider as you know was programmed by Core: Core stated in an exclusive interview to Edge magazine that the Saturn is far more powerful than the PS at the time the game was being developed. Then how on Earth have you come to the conclusion that PS Tomb Raider is superior? Are you saying the programmers are stupid or liars? (because I have revealed such a good piece of evidence showing your true nature your likely not to print this letter so I have sent you a photocopy of the interview). Also what is all this business of comparing Saturn and PS versions of the same games and writing \"it's the same old story the PS kicks ass\" what rubbish. All the Capcom 2D fighting games and Tomb Raider (I'll rather believe the programmers than a bunch of spotty juveniles in mens bodies who enjoy watching Eurotrash) are far superior to PS. All those PS games such as Wipeout and Destruction Derby, Loaded, Tunnel B1 were straight portovers. Everyone knows the Saturn's interior is far more complex and difficult to write for than the PS it's the talentless programmers faults not the Saturn's. More importantly you never make such a song and dance about the 2D Saturn titles being better than PS. I see no signs of biased captions and sections with numerous screenshots highlighting the differences in these cases, just comments of \"well there's minor, minuscule differences but PS is still amazing\" now what does that imply? Also at least these inferior Saturn versions are released unlike PS where X-Men and MSH were canned. This brings me to my third gripe in your November issue you replied to A Tachihitto's letter that Capcom were correct not to bother with Saturn Star Gladiator because the Saturn can't do lighting effects as good as PS. Well I'll agree with you there it can't, but when M Watson wrote in moaning about Capcom not producing 2D beat 'em ups on PS your replied «oh we can't understand this\". My God maybe you should be the official PS mag! I'll have you know the Saturn has three thirty two bit RISC chips inside it the PS only has one and whilst the Saturn can't do transparency/lighting as well as PS it is a far more versatile machine and in my opinion technically superior. Again on the subject of power your points about the PS versions of SF Alpha and Tomb Raider's sound being better than the Saturn's was total crap! Everyone knows the Saturn's sound chip is far superior to PS's. Finally I would like to end by commenting on your attitude to recent quality Saturn titles. In your review of Daytona: CCE you made comparisons with PS RRR and said that that was the right way to extend on an original concept and continued to poke fun at the two extra tracks in D:CCE well at least it doesn't contain just one scrappy looking race track and charge  for it. Just think if a demo of this game was given away the user would virtually have the whole game! And your negative attitude to the outstanding Saturn RPG Grandia of \"we've yet to see it running, but so far it looks as good FREEPLAY Dear CVG, I've had enough. Nearly every month some big Mays cation headed Saturn owner slags off the PlayStation. They go on and on about crappy PSX arcade conversions, and how Virtua Fighter 2, Virtua Cop and Sega Rally are «arcade perfect\". I want to ask them something, where is the bridge on Shun's level of Virtua Fighter 2? Where is the little yellow line which tells you how far away from the end of a track you are in Sega Rally? I admit Virtua Cop is brilliant, but not as good a conversion as Tekken 2. Not only is nothing missing (even the mirrors in Devil's level), but FMV was added at the beginning and for the ends. Now, on to racing games, Sega Rally is good but not as good as F1 or Wipeout 2097. Well, let me think about the fact that Saturn owners say that Star Gladiator is \"laughable\". Erm, have you played it? I played it at Live 96 (it wasn't even fully complete) and CVG/FreePlay Fan, In response to Stephen Driscoll's letter in Playstation FreePlay Fan issue 180, can only say that \"yes\", it does take Sega \"ages\" to get this good. It takes Sony only \"one year\". Get that. Only one year in the industry and already marketleaders. \"Poo\" to all those who put this solely down to good advertising. No customer is purely susceptible to good advertising. There has got to be good hardware, good immediate software, good prospects and possibilities for improvement. Sony had all of these in the PlayStation and that's why it's been a roaring success. It's a pity that some Sega languishers can't take it when their machine is knocked from the console podium in terms of popularity. I suppose they thought they'd have it easy in Nintendo's absence? Don't get me wrong. I still own a Mega Drive and love the games, but I believe Sega lost all credibility when they knowingly flogged a dead horse, or a few, being the Mega-CD and the 32X. Customers bought these in good faith, only to find out later that they had all been taken in by a "


"computer Video games were if they had not died? I think not. Just because the masses still think that SF2 is great doesn't mean it is. These masses don't know a good thing, just look at the state of the video games market over the last year. For one moment Capcom should forget about the stupid kid in the arcade who thinks every Capcom game is a masterpiece, just because SF2 knocked him off his feet. They should forget about that stuff and really think. Think about what they're doing to their image. And next time they come up with a half-assed idea, they should think about pushing it aside, and waiting for a good one. They do come, but Capcom are becoming very poor judges of what a good beat em up is. And think about the new blood. The Street Fighter series should have died, only to be left as memories of a legend. Now Street Fighter 3 will only be another Street Fighter game rather than another legend in the making. Thanks for reading. From A. Hoyte. NIGHTS is an ugly mess of colours.... blah... Mario is more popular and his Nintendo 64 debut has clear, beautiful graphics with anti-aliasing, z-buffer, mip mapping, etc. Crash Bandicoot doesn't have all that it's so basic and unoriginal...blah blah... Final Fantasy VII itself seems very special, I have to admit that, but again it should have been on the N64! If you are REAL gamers you know that Nintendo is the ultimate game company and you are «REAL GAMERS\" aren't you?? (or you really aren't). Kevin Lottering, The Netherlands. dodgy company who don't keep promises, and weedle cash out of the public with poor products. Admittedly, the Saturn is a sound machine, but do you think its games would be half as good if it didn't have Sony's breath on their necks and the sound of its Immense crotch-like purse, jingling in their ears? I don't think so. So Stephen, the majority of PlayStation releases are crap are they? I would ask you, have you ever really played a PlayStation game, without preconceived bias? There are no more dodgy ones than the Saturn has duff titles. That's a fact, and I don't think that a single PlayStation owner is worried about Namco going off and doing their own thing. By the time the Saturn gets around to receiving its significantly inferior conversion, it's old news anyway. Namco's first \"port of call\" will always be PlayStation. Why do you keep assuming that PlayStation owners keep worrying about things? Trouble with 2D games? So what! People bought PlayStations for 3D, because that is the way forward. I wouldn't lose sleep about not getting X-Men. 2D beat 'em ups are old hat. Yes, I think the Saturn could just about cope with Resident Evil, but it wouldn't be half as good. Stick to stereos and TVs you say! Maybe Sega should go back to talking scales! All Sega owners, me included, should praise and thank Sony for taking the bit between their teeth and yanking it from Sega's mouth, with Sonic's dentures still on the end. Who could possibly knock the likes of Wipeout 2097, Formula 1, Tekken 2 and Resident Evil, to name but a few. Third party games, you may say? What does it matter?! Their spiritual home is still on the PlayStation. At this point in Sega's career, they were coming out with the likes of \"Altered Beast\". Nuff said. To reiterate. It doesn't take ages. It takes one year\". Paul Carter, Warrington. M2 And as for the rest, if I wanted to play Mario Kart, Killer Instinct, Pilot Wings, Doom and Kirby (for Christ's sake!) I'd do it on my SNES. Some of these games could send a glass eye to sleep! Where's the brave innovation that helped build Nintendo's reputation? Where's the new direction for their brand spanking new machine? If this is 1996, why the hell are we still playing Mario? Why! To all you folks with a treasure chest under your beds throbbing with mounds of glistening dosh, get it out! Spend it! Live for the now! Just pick out your favourite software and buy the machine that plays the most of it. What's stopping you buying a N64 in 12-18 months when the machine is cheaper and you've had the chance to gauge its success? As for me, I've just bought Sony's little gem but it was a close call, there's no doubt the Saturn is a fine machine. Oh, and last week! thought I'd treat myself and bought one of these new Jaguars. Not an XK8 though but a small black number that cost .99. Tempest 2000 is fair smooth too and well worth a dabble if you want your crumpets of nostalgia to be well and truly buttered. So thanks to Atari, only I seem to be having difficulty picking up birds with this Jag. Cheers, Heath Thompson, Warwickshire. NINTENDO Dear CVG, I am writing to you regarding the N64, you know the so-called \"Ultimate Super Console\" and saviour of console gaming. Almost 18 months late, and countless delays down the line and it just has not lives up to all the hype which surrounded It way back as far as issue 163 June 95. Its performance just isn't that superior as that of the 32-bit machines, especially Sony's PlayStation, and therefore the gap between 32 and 64-bit isn't anything that special and I don't think justifies the delays that Nintendo had to bring the N64 to production. Also what happened to all the specs of the machine. Issues 162 & 171: 1. Clock speeds greater than 100 Mhz. 2. Realtime 3D graphics with high resolution 24-bit video and CD quality sound. 3. 3D anti-aliasing textures, with detail of a higher standard le. HDTV of the future. Where are these specs now? Also 100.000 polygons/sec. Wow! The Saturn can do 500,000 and PlayStation reputedly about 750,000. I've been waiting about 18 months for the «Ultra\" 64, but now I think I'll just forget it. I'm either getting a PlayStation now or waiting for what seems like a true next gen 64-bit system, yes the un-believable M2! 7 custom graphics and sound processors, 2 IBM 602 main processors, and a whole host of technical specs which will no-doubt blow the Big N's machine out of sight. Roll on M2, a true 64 bit power super console. S. Clark, Cumbria. NINTENDOM Dear CVG. Dear CVG, I feel that everyone is really underestimating Nintendo with their Nintendo 64. Nintendo is the only REAL game company, Sega and Sony are far beneath Nintendo. Even though Sony and Sega have sold rather some of their garbage. The only one with real quality is Nintendo. No game of either Sony or Sega can compete with any game of Nintendo. Nintendo invented most of all the kinds of games that are around. More precisely... platform games. If Shigeru Miyamoto had not invented the Mario games then there never would be no Sonic or NIGHTS or Crash Bandicoot. They are just bad duplicates. It has been a pity that it took so long for the Nintendo 64 to arrive in Japan and USA... and it still has to arrive around here. But I predict that in year or so... the Nintendo 64 will sell like hell. More games will come out in the future because everyone is working hard to make them right with the best quality you can ever think of. Then slowly the Saturn will fade into the distance and after that the PlayStation also, with the Nintendo 64 ruling, only it will take a little time... maybe the Nintendo 64 had a slow start with not many games but the future will be bright. Here in the Netherlands... I know no-one who owns a PlayStation or Saturn they all have a SNES. So Nintendo rules around here, I am sure of that. Everyone is waiting for the Nintendo 64. Some don't even know what a PlayStation or a Saturn is. They are too busy playing on the SNES because they don't need something like PlayStation or Saturn. [Sorry, but we had to cut bits out of this letter, as it was way too long it would fill all of FreePlay CVG] Blah blah... graphically FESTIVE FREEPLAY FAN I am just writing this letter because I though that it was my duty to warn those people that are tired of waiting for the Nintendo 64 and were planning on buying any other console, NOT TO! I recently attended \"Live 96\" where I was very surprised to see a large Nintendo truck, the queues were massive but it was well worth the wait, I simply couldn't believe that after hearing all the hype, I was finally playing Mario 64 for the very first time, the memory gets imprinted on you, it was absolutely amazing, and anyone else who has played it will know what I mean. So forget your PlayStations and Saturns, wait until March 1st 1997 and you will truly experience fun. Saam Hodivala, Billericay. Dear CVG, Yesterday. 1992. Cold, unforgiving brick alleyways. Hot women. Cold steel. The brutal, yet satisfying \"thud\" of a limp body crashing to the ground. \"Yoga\". Fire. Smoke. Blood. The salt smell of the docks. Chest pains. Ken.. Gotta save ken. Thunder. Lightning Darkness. Game over... Game over? Oh, that's right. It was only a game. A video game. A video game that should have been left alone, only to be remembered as a masterpiece. Capcom is losing it. Street Fighter 2 on its own, is wonderful. Street Fighter 2 CE was acceptable. The rest are pieces of crap (Street Fighter vs X-Men just takes the p**s). Why couldn't Capcom just leave well enough alone? Why not leave the legend alone? Would Bruce Lee, Elvis Presley, or John Lennon be remembered as the legends they Dear FreePlay, Nintendo then? I've had a SNES for some time and amongst a load of trash there was some decent software but what's all this tripe about brand loyalty? The first mention of this super N64 machine sent trouser-rippling shivers down the legs of the new gaming world but what exactly have we got to look forward to? And Nintendo's marketing team! Whose wonderful idea was it to release a game (not even out yet) based on a film shown 18 months ago, ie. Goldeneye? Yes, we're hip. Yes, we're with it. Not! There you go!
