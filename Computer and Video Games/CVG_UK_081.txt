"Virusbusters! otheo pamest of W In Paris, France, Loriciels has broken what amounts to a conspiracy of silence on that newest of '80s bogeymen, the computer virus. By setting up an \"isolation ward» for all incoming software to the company, they successfully identified and neutralised a hoax game sent in to them that was simply buzzing with a destructive virus before it was allowed anywhere near their normal computer systems. Once a contaminated disk of this sort is inserted in a computer drive, it would transfer a hard to detect microprogram which would subsequently be written onto any other inserted disks, and each disk itself would then infect all fresh systems it came into contact with. Thus, comparing it with a biological virus is a fairly accurate way of understanding how it works. While the spreading of any particular virus is a very frightening prospect last Autumn the whole of Iraq was apparently infected in as short a period as two months! being aware of the problem is a major step towards combatting it.

Power Pyramids is on the Spectrum (.95) and C64 (.95/12.95) while Chubby is available across all popular 8 and 16 bit machines.

People sometimes go to barmy lenghts to conceal the fact that they've pinched an idea for a game. This one, for instance, is supposedly all about stranded astronauts searching for fuel for their spaceship. Pah! I know a rip-off of Magic Knight when I see one! In truth, gentle reader, Metropolis is naught but a spacified version of David Jones excellent trilogy for Mastertronic. Here, the put upon hero, Moonboots, wears a spacesuit instead of armour, and is attacked by aliens instead of demons, but the idea's the same; make your way through dozens of chambers, avoiding attack and searching out the objects which will open locked doors and help you return to your home.

"INTERCITY 125. Kawasaki or Kawas ARI25: Road Sports. Some 125's are difficult to ride because their engines produce too little power in some parts of the rev range, and too much in others. The Kawasaki, however, delivers power effortlessly, from low down right up to maximum speed. As Performance Bikes magazine wrote when comparing all the 125's \"The Kawasaki is in a different class performance-wise. No matter what gear you're in, just twist the throttle and it always responds, better than any other 125» With its superbly sweet engine, the AR125 is as nippy between towns as it is around town. But Kawasaki performance is much more than speed. It is the ideal balance between handling, braking, economy and power. Super Bike summed it up as a «perfect learner two-stroke... handles brilliantly... brakes stop the bike on a sixpence. .. unconditionally recommended\". KMX125: Country Sports. The KMX is developed directly from Kawasaki's racing moto-crossers. So when you plough across the fields, you're riding a real thoroughbred. When a crowd of first-timers tested all the new 125's, including riding them around a Part One Driving Test Course, they voted the KMX top of the lot. Dirt Bike Rider magazine rated the KMX \"the trickest 125 on street or trail\". Which is fair comment since the KMX is as brilliant on-road as it is off-road. The Kawasaki Launch Pad Package. If you buy any new learner-legal Kawasaki, maintain it correctly, and return it in good condition in a year, you'll get your money back (less taxes) against the cost of your next new Kawasaki. To qualify, you have to agree to take proper training. And, if you do, you'll get special discount vouchers on safe riding gear like gloves, boots and jacket. If you would like a brochure and the name of a Kawasaki Launch Pad dealer near you, send your name, age, and address, to Dept 153, Kawasaki Motors UK Ltd, 748 Deal Avenue, Slough, Berkshire, SLI 4RZ.

"VER  MACHINES: SPECTRUM, COMMODORE 64, AMSTRAD. SUPPLIER: TV GAMES (DOMARK). PRICE: $7.95 CASSETTE, .95 C64 DISK, $12.95 AMSTRAD DISK. VERSION TESTED: C64 CASSETTE. REVIEWER: MATT BIELBY. All right, you're down the pub, or you're in the arcade, or you're wherever you reprobates go on a night, and it's getting around that time when there's nothing else for it: you just have to have a game of Triv. So you wack your ten pees in, gather your mates around, and start to trash that cash. And what d'you get out of it? No adrenalin rush like in Outrunthat's for sure, just to prove that perhaps you know a bit more useless information than everyone around you. What basically we have here, guys and gals, is a computerised friv game for the home, and as such is bound to be a massive success not just now but in a year or two's time because: a) trivia has taken over the country since Trivial Pursuit, machines in pubs etc, b) Paul Daniels is the Granny's favourite, and they are bound to say around Christmas time \"ah, little Johnny's into computer games, I'll buy him one\", and then purchase the license they know. So how does it fare as a trivia game? Well for a start, you can forget Paul Daniels. How many computerised pictures do you get of him? Answer: not a lot. Not even at the end when you've won the contest. Instead you do get a rough (read: very rough) approximation of a TV studio, populated by just the sort of people you get in these game shows. Considering that they don't have to do very much just blink occasionally they could be better animated, though their very gormless stiffness helps capture the true character of the show. First thing you have to do is chose your players from the vast range of worthies on offer. Should you Shifty Contestants choose the shifty looking one with a beard, and perhaps partner him with the blond floozy or what? You can play up to three teams, so you can fight with your pals about which character to play. After this fun, the game begins. You whiz through a number of rounds answering true or false questions, or choosing which of three categories various things fall into. When you get tired of a certain block of questions, it's quite a faff having to rewind the tape to get to another block, if like me, you've made the mistake of playing the cassette version. Throughout the game, your correct answers are earning you extra seconds which are of vital importance in the final round when the clock really is against you and, well, \"every second counts\". How much you like it just depends on how much you like triv, I guess. GRAPHICS  SOUND  VALUE  PLAYABILITY OVERALL UPDATE On the Spectrum version the blinking eyes on the contestants are nowhere near as well animated as on the others, and the Every Second Counts clock is far less impressive ... Nah, just kidding. This ain't a game that relies on graphics a great deal, so you get basically the same package whatever computer you've got. The questions are the same, anyway. Little to do with TV show. COUNTS BALL NO CALL FALSE PANI "

PRICE: .95.  VERSION TESTED: AMSTRAD/SPECTRUM/CBM 64. REVIEWER: CHRIS JENKINS. Imagine an entire world in solid 3-D, through which you can wander freely. Imagine a terrifying threat, an implacable enemy, and a challenging mission. Imagine a series of baffling puzzles, and the heart-stopping excitement of trying to solve them under enemy attack. Imagine no more ... Dark Side is here. If you saw Incentive's first Freescape 3-D game, Driller, you'll know how the Major Developments team has brought solid graphics to a new high point. You can move around and into buildings and structures, view them from any angle, even take off and see them from above. In Dark Side, the system is refined to an even greater degree, and the gameplay is pushed to amazing heights. It's the same old story; malevolent alien race (the ketars) build giant weapon (Zephyr One) and threaten the home planet of the peace-loving goodies (the Evaths). Only one man can invade the moon of Tricuspid, knock out the Ketar weapon and save Evath. It's you, muggins. The surface of Tricuspid is dotted with ketar structures. Some serve no function, some can help you and some will attack you. Learning to recognise which is which becomes pretty crucial. As you move through the 3-D landscape, your first aim is to locate ECDs Energy Collection Devices. These solar energy units are feeding power into the Zephyr One weapon. Unless you disable them and slow down the charging rate, the weapon will fire and toast your home. Many of the ECDs are hidden inside buildings, which you can only enter by locating doorways and shooting out the doors. This all takes energy, and of course you will snuff it if your power rating falls to zero. There are also more immediate ways of meeting a sticky end; Plexor defence tanks patrol the moon, and will open fire as soon as you are within range. Go into weapons mode, aim for the head and blow them away before they get you. To knock out all the ECDs before the Zephyr One fires, you need to learn to use the map supplied, the location co-ordinates displayed on your instrument panel, and the teleporter pads, to cover the huge game area. Your final weapon is your jet pack. Supplied with a limited amount of fuel, it allows you to soar over the landscape, spotting ECDs and taking out Plexors as you go. Energy convertor pods allow you to transfer fuel to your shild, and there are control keys to alter your orientation and make U-turns. You can also save a game part-way through. If it isn't already clear from this really inadequate review, Dark Side is absolutely stunning. The colourful interior scenes on the Amstrad and 64 versions, together with the impressive designs of the Ketar installations, make it a pleasure just to wander through the may zones of the moon. But in addition, the gameplay is absolutely absorbing. Miss out on Dark Side and you might as well throw your micro out of the window.

REVIEWER: PAUL BOUGHTON. How are you really expected to criticise a game which it is hoped will raise loadsamoney for Sport Aid 88, the charity fighting hunger, poverty and disease among children worldwide? To say anything against it would be churlish to say the least. Even if this game's bad, it's good. Right? And, in fact, what we have here is a quite decent arcade adventure for a fair price. However, most of the praise for this game comes from Codemaster themselves. Just get a load of the blurb. \"Another great game by the Oliver Twins.\" Well, it's another game by the Oliver Twins. But great? \"An excellent example of how compulsive and addicitive a game can really be!!!\" That depends on what other games you've ever played. \"Absolutely brilliant this is one of the best computer games ever written.\" Now steady on! That really is going too far. In Race Against Time you play the part of Sudanese runner Omar Khalifa. He's the athlete who back in 1986 lit a torch from the campfire in an African village and ran with it through Europe and the United States to launch Sports Aid. Nicely programmed and playable, Race Against Time has to be a recommended buy. It even has Peter Gabriel's Games Without Frontiers as a soundtrack.

"RAME Fame again beckons for those who play the frame game, the superb computer artists who submit to C+VG's Frame-Up. Those who feature this month are Stuart Shackleton, of Bradford, who produced Karnov and Frightmare on the Amstrad; Paul Sargent, of Canvey Island, Essex, came with a version of Stephen King's It book jacket and the Roger Dean inspired Vertigo on the Atari ST. Trooper and Psychic on the ST were drawn by Laurent Stern, 15, from France. Barry Pringle, of Wembley, shows us what he thinks Outrun should like on the Amiga and his version of Rampage. And thanks to Rob Matthews, from Teddington, Middlesex, for Freddy, Madonna, Pinocchio and Rupert Bear. Finally the Amstrad Mel and Kim is from Anthony Wilson, who lives somewhere on Planet Earth.

"6. Question: what do you call a dirty, smelly tramp with a knife, who's found near the body of a woman, and who won't talk to the police? Answer: 'Murderer!' That is unless you're a crusading attorney like Kathleen Riley (Cher), who believes that a Suspect(15) is innocent until proven guilty. That doesn't count for much if he's a penniless bum in Washington, though. It's Death by misadventure or murder most foul? one law for the Whitehouse Celluloid coroner Ward R Street passes and another for the homeless judgement on this month's movies and Luckily, the workaholic discovers a few stiffs ... lawyer cares and sets out to prove her client's innocence, starting with the minor detail that he's a deaf and dumb hence his non-cooperation! Meanwhile smoothie, self-seeking political lobbyist Eddie Sanger (Dennis Quaid) is summoned for jury service and lumbered with this case. What everyone else has overlooked but what has Eddie exclaiming Elementary!', just like Sherlock Holmes suggests that the tramp is innocent after all. But jury members aren't supposed to talk to the attorneys, let alone turn into A Momma: You must be choking! private detectives and do their jobs for them! Suspect isn't the most convincing thriller you'll ever see, but it's directed with considerable verve by Englishmen Peter Yates, who draws a rich contrast between the corridors of power and the holes in the ground that are home to the destitutes. There's more murder in Throw Momma From A Suspect: Cher lays down the law. A Prison: Jailhouse Shock. The Train (15) but it's not a whodunit. It's actually a how-will-they-do-itthe 'it' being the disposal of Momma, a senile, housebound monster who makes her son Owen's life a misery. Larry also has problems. His ex-wife walked off with the plot of his latest book and became an overnight success, leaving him with a terminal case of writer's block. And aggravating it all is Owen, who attends his creative writing evening classes and submits murder mysteries with only two characters. In desperation, Larry sends Owen to see Hitchcock's A Cop: Lighter moment among the seediness. Stranger's on a Train, the tale of two men who both have people they want dead, so decide to swap murders. But Owen takes it personally and thinks that Larry is suggesting a similar exchange and before you can say 'assassin' he's killing Larry's wife. Now Owen insists that Larry fulfils his part of a bargain that he never made. Will he kill Momma? Can Momma be killed? She not only looks like the Hulk she shares his temper ad she's just about about as indestructible! While Throw Momma doesn't quite live up to its tasteless premise, it is still a lot funnier than most Hollywood comedies. Danny DeVito (Romancing the Stone) directs and stars as Owen with Billy Crystal (Running Scared) providing excellent support. And don't overlook Anne Ramsay as Momma, the best argument for euthanasia I've seen! With all these deaths occurring it's inevitable that eventually a Cop (18) would show up. He's James Woods, the craggy actor from last year's Best Seller, where he was on the other side of the law, playing a self-publicising hit-man. Not that he's much better with a badge. He throws away the rule book immediately he leaves the station. His vigilante zeal makes Dirty Harry look like a liberal as he tracks down a serial killer who does messy things to call-girls -and in this slice of life from the seedy side, we're not spared a thing. Inevitably for such an unorthodox law-man, he runs into trouble with his superiors, not to say his wife who reckons that telling True Detective bedtime stories to their daughter is taking obsesson a bit too far. But pretty soon he's probing a hooker in a manner he was definitely not taught as part of routine interrogation. Normally I like James Woods' performances, and there's no denying that this is another powerful part. But the unrelenting seediness of the film proved a little too much. There's only one film that can follow it and that's Prison (18). What next, I ask? Parole? For the inmates of this particular institution, the only way out is in a box and that goes for guards as well as their changes. This is yet another roller-coaster ride from continued "

"THE AXE MAN COMETH There are three levels to explore and conquer before, if you are extremely lucky and skillful, the final confrontation with Drax. Each level is mapable and each contains two objects to be collected which will be needed later on in the game. There are three levels; the wastelands, a fiery, hostile landscape of volcanoes, and circling vultures; the caverns, where peril lurks at every turn; and the dank, dark, deadly dangerous dungeons of Drax. Populating these three levels are 20 of the most unbelievably fantastic, head-biting, teeth-tearing, clawing-killing beasts you never want to meet on a dark night. For instance, there's a repulsive thing which looks like a maggot with claws, a floating cobra-like creature with a slicing spikey tail, and a huge, pot-bellied giant. Hitting these creatures with axe and sword produces a noxious spray from their bodies and, if you managed to hit the pot-bellied giant in the right place, his heart is ripped pounding from his chest. Gross, eh? Remember the cute green creature from the first game, who enters the arena and 11100 MPIANTI WO Get that axe ready. And once more the brave warrior, mighty of Marina from the evil wizard muscle and quick of brain, prepares to do battle muscle and quick of brain prepares to do battle Drax?

"ARCADE Arcade Action takes to the skies this month with Chopper 1 the game we think will make the best conversion to home computer since Out Run. Clare Edgeley also reports on Data East's new Dragon Ninja and Capcom's driving game F1 Dream or is it a nightmare? ground based catapults. Against all the overwhelming forces that face you, you do have one trick up your sleeve — the Airforce! When things are looking very black, the airforce is only the push a button away. Yup, that's right. Just press the 'panic' button and a whole squadron of fighter planes sweep over your chopper HET CHOPPER 1 HIGH 300 HELI problem unless of course they disappear off the bottom of the screen only to sweep back onto the screen right into the back of your gunship. The tanks tend to be more of a problem to knock-out. They are stationed in groups and move along railway tracks in an effort to get you in their sights. Some tanks lurk inside caverns in huge boulders that line the route your chopper is taking. It's not unusual for one to sneak out while your busy blasting some If you'd thought you'd seen the last of bomb them from the skies games, you better get your flying goggles back on again and take off with Chopper 1. It's hard to imagine that a game of this type has much new to offer — but Chopper 1 is full of surprises and an awful lot of blasting action, too. The game begins with a display of your airforce base when you are informed that you must take off on an emergency mission (what exactly the emergency is, is not explained in any detail) and then the action begins with several helicopters lifting off from the base. The game is presented by a bird's eye view of your chopper and the incoming helicopters and tanks on the ground. The first offensive involves small groups of helicopters flying formation towards you and this generally doesn't cause too much of a DRAGON NINJA Here's your chance to act the part of a real macho man — huge muscley arms and a punch and kick which will annihilate even the most deadly force. Dragon Ninja from Data East, is the game you should be playing and, though it's another Street Fighter/Double Dragon/Vigilante lookalike, it's nonetheless an action-packed battle fast paced with danger stalking from every direction. You can't relax a minute as you and your partner it's much more fun on the two-player game — amble down a mean-looking side street. Suddenly blue masked ninjas leap out to attack. For seconds it looks like you'll be overwhelmed and then the fabled fists fly into action. The 1-UP yooo 2-UP HICH 3000 1-UP HIKI GOO 300 destroying everything on the --UP BA screen. The problem is you can HELT only call in your airforce buddies three times, after that it's a solo mission. At the end of the first level you begin to start flying over water ENSE MUSIC while managing to avoid the gun emplacements stationed on the top of little islands as well as the obligatory choppers that buzz you from all directions. Once this section is complete you come to a large machine at the end of the first level. The only way to describe the machine is helicopters and fill your ship full that it's like a huge rocket that of mortar. The boulders runs on tracking and fires huge themselves are as much a help as blasts of flame at you. a hinderance. They often provide This is easier said than done as a place to hide behind when the the machine moves so fast that it's action gets a little too hot to almost impossible to keep out of handle, but it's all too easy to get the way of the flame. trapped in a corner and have you Unfortunately that was as far ship crushed to pieces. as this particular reviewer could As you progress through the get.

In fact, by the second or third F1 Dream maybe Capcom's turning I did manage to 'whiz' idea of a dream but it's past a couple of cars with a certainly not mine. huge sigh of relief. It didn't last In fact it's more like Atari's 'long though. They fight dirty on dreamlike Supersprint on a the circuit and will bumb you off 'grand' scale, the track onto the verge or into a spin unfolding as you buzz round without a second thought so but still retaining the same that they can regain their aerial viewpoint. places. To start you're given the At some point round the option of four Formula 1 circuits circuit you have to race it to choose from, ranging from twice within a time limit to get to LIZU JEPO-FPHIC LAP 1'22\"68 should be treated with more care, as should flaming ninjas. For no apparent reason a perfectly insane looking blue baddie will burst into flames and run headlong at you, no doubt hoping to singe you as he belts past. The fire can be put out with a well aimed kick and then when he's more vulnerable you can get down to the business of putting him out of action. Fishnet stockings and skin-tight leotards mark the arrival of the ninjaettes. These deadly femme fatales always hunt in pairs and shriek painfully when kicked off screen. Other colourful characters rush in wielding knives and nunchukas, and if you're quick you can swipe these and use them against the enemy. Strings of mines planted underfoot are agony when they start to glow red and quickly put you off your fighting. A well aimed ground kick disarms them, though this is not as simple as it sounds. When you're trapped in a mined area and fighting off hordes of evil minded ninja, the last thing you have time for is to deal with the mines. The graphics are huge fast moving sprites of astonishing clarity and realistic detail has been incorporated into the colourful background scenery. Sqwarks of pain, the satisfying thunk as bone meets flesh and the howls of killer dogs all set the scene to a tremendously exciting game. And, of course, the continue play facility helps no end when it comes to seeing just another level'. No game like this is complete without the big, bad monster/alien/thug at the end of each level, and Dragon Ninja is not exception. Honestly, it takes two players and a hell of a lot of 10 pences to defeat each deadly foe, and at the end when arms are lifted high in the universal sign of victory, you really feel as if you've won a major battle. As a beat 'em up I'd recommend Dragon Ninja as much for the game play as the quality of graphics. Granted there are lots of them around, but this is one of the better ones. TI REMIO G/B hoods collapse to the ground unconscious as your fingers fly over the punch and kick buttons. There's not much skill called for in Dragon Ninja — not unlike Street Fighter where you have to remember all the current joystick/fire button positions. In a way though, this is just as fun as the moves come more from instinct and the sound as a punch connects is highly satisfying. Throughout this horizontally scrolling beat'em up, you'll notice that each screen is split into two levels. A flick of the joystick and you can catleap onto a wall to take on more ninjas. With two players you can each patrol a section, and both have the benefit of knocking out each quantities of the enemy.
