"THE HARDWARE ODGE ODE The Gamate measures 168mm x 99mm x 33.5mm, and weighs in at 300g with the four AA batteries (which are thoughtfully supplied) installed. Like the Game Boy, the Gamate three-inch screen is capable of producing high resolution graphics in four des of grey. Unfortunately, the screen is prone to very bad blurring when anything moves across it. The Game Boy also suffers from this problem, but for some reason the Gamate blur0-vision is much more conspicuous, and consequently, much more irritating. The machine has a built-in speaker (capable of putting out a grand total of 10 milliwatts of sound) and for those moments of private gaming, the package contains a pair of in-the-ear headphones, which plug into the stereo jack socket. Optional extras are a two-player link lead (an item which seems to be de rigeur on handhelds these days), and a power adapter and a battery charger, to save on those hefty Ever Ready bills. Incidentally, the lack of a colour screen should mean that the Gamate's battery life is considerably longer than that of the Lynx, and should be comparable with the Game Boy's 25 hours. THE SOFTWARE SCORE There are currently twelve games in the Gamate catalogue, all of which come on PC Engine-style memory cards and cost .95. Each game is gifted with an imaginative name (such as Mighty Tank, Mini Golf, Tennis or Galaxy Invaders), and the sort of bizarre storyline which can only have been caused by a half-qualified translator. Witty Apee (the card you get with the machine) is a sort of platforms-and-ladders caper along the lines of Lode Runner which puts the eponymous (and witty) Apee up against nasty gardeners and \"German Shepherds' (\"Achtung! Get avay from mein sheep!\") in the Kingdom of Fruits. Enchanted Bricks is a Breakout game, in which (get this) you have to save Little Red Riding Hood's granny by bouncing STAGE GAME-TASTIC, MATE? GAMATE COMPACT VIDEO There are a fair few portable consoles around at the moment, but the latest to reach these shores is the Gamate. Originally released in the Far East shortly after the Game Boy, it is being marketed in Britain by joystick manufacturer, Cheetah. Robert Swan took a look at this new beastie, and asked the question, has it got what it takes to better Nintendo's world-beating handheld? "


"her crystal ball against the bricks in Big Wolf's wall! The only din ference in gameplay terms is the fact that the bricks plod around the screen, and nasty sprites appear occasionally to attack the player's paddle. Finally, we saw Bomb Blaster, an overhead maze game in which you have to find your way out of a haunted mansion by blowing up walls and ghosts with special bombs. I'm sad to say that all three games were very poor indeed, with graphics bearing a remarkable resemblance to those from the earliest Spectrum games, sound that's enough to have you fiddling with the volume switch in seconds. The blurry screen also makes each one extremely difficult and frustrating to play. Trying to follow the ball in Enchanted Bricks, for example, is enough to drive you completely myopic! THE VERDICT The Gamate biggest fault is the poor quality LCD screen, which is actually painful to look at for any great length of time. Luckily, none of the games are sufficiently addictive to keep you playing for much longer than half an hour or so. At .95 (only ten quid cheaper than the Game Boy) the Gamate isn't a great purchase. With Nintendo's hand-held grabbing all the big-name licenses, it's hard to imagine the Gamate having any sort of future to speak of, unless Cheetah produce games which, like Tetris, need no big-name selling. Potential buyers would be well advised to leave this on the shelf, and have a look at the Game Boy instead. BETTY PLUGS IT INTO A SEGA According to that prestigious non-chart-topping organ, Smash Hits, Betty Boo (very attractive young lady ED) wanted a Sega Master System, with a copy of Chase HQ for Christmas! Unfortunately, not having the redhot music biz contacts of our colleagues on Smash Hits, we were unable to find out whether or not Santa did in fact leave said items in her capacious stocking. But we reckon Miss Boo couldn't do better than read C+VG or MEAN MACHINES for the latest in red-hot Sega reviews (End of ThinlyVeiled Plug) Come to think of it, which machine would you reckon the stars of stage and screen would want for Chrimbo? Scribble your ideas down on a postcard or sealed envelope, and bung 'em to the usual address, marked \"I BET DON ESTELLE WANTS A GAMEBOY\" (Um, yeah... ED). The funniest (or weirdest) will be on the receiving end of a mystery prize, so get thinking! AATARI IS THIS A COP-OUT? LOADSA LYNX LUNACY After the record-breaking original, and its \"bloody hard\" sequel, Ocean are planning a third RoboCop game! According to industry journal, Computer Trade Weekly, RoboCop III is penciled in as one of Ocean's big releases for the autumn of 1991. Production is just starting on Robo III, and the word is, unlike the first two, instead of being an 18 certificate, the third film will be either a 12 or PG certificate, and will contain a heck of a lot less violence. Will this wreck the titanium-coated copper's image, we ask ourselves? The only way to find out is to wait and see, so keep taking the regular doses of C+VG to find out it's all happening on the Lynx, y'know. Apart from the 50 quid price cut, there's a fair few new titles out, and the good news is that there's more to come. Specific dates are yet to be finalised, but the list of releases for 1991 is as follows (deep breath): 3D Barrage, 720 Degrees, APB, Basketbrawl, Blockout, Chequered Flag, Gridrunner, Casino, NFL Super Bowl, Ninja Gaiden, PacLand, Pinball Shuffle, Rampage, RoboSquash, Rygar, Scrapyard Dog, Shanghai, STUN Runner, Turbo Sub, Tournament Cyberball 2071, Vindicators, War birds, World Cup Soccer and Xybots! Phewee! Watch out for reviews of the above when we can get hold of copies! "

GREMLIN HIT IT Ruddy heck, those Japanese are a bit on the inventive side, aren't they? Obviously bored with the Game Boy, Game Gear, Lynx, TurboExpress and all the other portable consoles available, some electronics whiz has come up with wait for it the portable Nintendo! As you can see from the pic, it looks a bit cumbersome and you still have to plug standard Nintendo joypads into the unit so it's not the sort of thing you could start playing on the train. But no, wait, because the thing is, y'see, the unit is completely illegal, so there's no chance of ever getting your grubby mitts on one! Codenamed the \"Express\", and built by Japanese technopirates from the guts of a normal NES, it can use all existing Nintendo games!

THE AMAZING TANGLE-FREE JOYSTICK With the results of our extensive survey in, we've come to the conclusion that you lot want C+VG to have a super-spiffy new look. So, the mag you're holding in your sweaty palms right now is about to undergo the most intensive dramatic surgery imaginable, and will emerge from the operating table next month even better than before! Impossible, we hear you cry! But no, because we have an all-new designer who goes by the name of \"Jon Billington\" (ex of Titan Books!), and we intend to make Britain's best-selling computer mag even more colourful, more informative, and even more gobsmacking than you could possibly imagine, and for the same super cheap price of .30! Aren't we good to you? were kind enough to send us down the Freedom 16, an infra-red stick with no wires! Wireless joysticks aren't a new idea, by any stretch, so we had a look to see if this new stick improved on the theory The stick itself is quite responsive, and does the job nicely the main prob lem is the infra-red idea, which is the whole basis of the controller. Unless you're playing in a secure environment (ie not the C+VG computer room), it's quite easy to break the infra-red beam, rendering the joystick suddenly ineffective in the midst of that death-defying leap! Another hang-up is that the thing needs four AA batteries so if these pack up half way through a game, you're snookered! If you've got batteries coming out of your ears, though, you could try ringing... the casualty department of your nearest hospital! Haha, ahem, no.

You actually get the feeling of screaming down a straight at 150mph, something none of the bike racers released so far have been able to achieve! The 3D is so smooth, and updates incredibly quickly if you switch off the dashboard and the rider sprites, the whole thing whizzes along at an absolutely unbelievable rate!

"Let me introduce myself I'm Sadie, and I've been brought in by those revolting delinquents, the C+VG crew, to supply the commentary on these so-called challenges and bring some much-needed order to the situation. This month the game being played is Kick-Off 2, a fine football simulation based around the noble art of booting balls. Sounds like my glass of champagne. THE PLAYERS LINE UP Five challengers massed at the squalid C+VG offices the place where I wipe my boots on the way out, rather than on my way in one misty December morning to play Kick Off 2. Anco's brilliant football game. The players were Steve Screech Kick Off 2's designer, Gawy \"wobust\" Hawwod (MEAN MACHINES' illustrator and man of clear ennunciation, who recently had his hair cut off and now looks like an albino coconut with mange). C+VG's loud, long-haired trippy hippy . Julian Rignall and finally Liam Dystant, the valiant reader whose job it was to destroy the enlarged egos of those present. Oh yes, and for sheer comedy value, C+VG's hapless hopalong headbanger Robert \"oo-aah\" Swan, who recently injured his leg in a staircase accident obviously his brain wasn't capable of sending the correct signals to his legs to negotiate the simple barrier. I looked forward to a repeat performance of last month's challenge, where the limping. gibbering cretin was shamefully beaten into third place ha! THE "


"KICK OFF LEAGUE I decided to split the challenge into two sections, a league system where all the participants had to play with one another, and a knock-out competition, and without further ado I ordered league play to begin. scrappy match, with Steve scoring early. Gary had one good effort, but the half-time whistle blew just before the ball cross the line the whining wally nearly cried with frustration. I laughed a lot. FINAL SCORE: STEVE 1 GARYO MATCH 1 ROB vs LIAM Rob, the token C+VG cripple, has a reputation for being the worst Kick Off 2 player in the northern hemisphere, so I was confident that Liam would do me proud. Just to make things a bit fairer, I threatened that if Rob beat Liam, I'd give him a good kick in his gammy leg. Rob took his seat with a wet squelch. Straight after the first whistle, Rob fluckily popped the ball into the net. Unfortunately, Liam's impressive Kick Off skills seemed to have deserted him until the last moment, when he equalised. Thank God for that. I didn't really want to soil my lovely boots on his filthy personage! FINAL SCORE: ROB 1 LIAM 1 MATCH SEVEN JULIAN vs ROB \"Oo! Ah!\", whinged the moronic mosher as he took his place in front of the monitor, \"me leg's givin' me gip\". However, the boy who cried cripple proved that luck yet again could triumph over skill as he scored an early goal. Julian battled in vain (indeed, he is very vain), but could not get his team together. Understandable, because at the end of the match he discovered that his men were in 4-3-3 formation rather than his favourite 4-2-4. Serves the stupid cretin right for not checking at the start of the match... FINAL SCORE: JULIAN O ROB 1 MATCH EIGHT LIAM VS JULIAN Could Liam prove himself this time? He certainly had the chance to with Julian having just suffered a demoralising defeat at the hands of C+VG's Iron Moron. However, Julian resorted to dirty tactics to ensure victory, and took an Anders LimMATCH 2 ROB VS STEVE Rather like a powerful lavatory full of compacted dung, Rob was flushed with success, and went into this match against the favourite, Steve, with confidence oozing from his greasy pores. A few minutes into the game, a smug grin was in evidence on Rob's pasty fizzog the jammy git had scored with one of those long halfway line lobs so despised amongst expert Kick Off players. Much dirty play was displayed as Rob attempted to reduce Steve's players to his own invalid status, and then Steve's misery was made complete when Rob managed to score another disgusting lob from miles away. And with some of the most banal Kick Off play I'd ever seen, Captain Crippy managed to hold on to the lead. Aaagh! FINAL SCORE: ROB 2 STEVE O MATCH 3 GARY vs LIAM Bald-boy Harrod was brimming over with confidence, even down to bringing out his own flaccid joystick to play with. Liam, who had already been beaten looked worried, and indeed he had reason to two minutes into the game, the whingeing one scored by intimidating his opponent with foul language. He moaned and whined on for the rest of the match, until poor old Liam's Kick Off skill was reduced to a shambling mess. I vowed that before the day was over, I'd see Harrod whinge with defeat! FINAL SCORE: GARY 1 LIAM O par-eque dive in the area to gain a penalty, which he stuck away. Liam responded with similar tactics, and earned a yellow card before one of his players was given the marching orders. Although he gave it his best shot, slimy Rignall popped another into the onion bag to win convincingly. FINAL SCORE: LIAM O JULIAN 2 MATCH FOUR JULIAN vs GARY The first match for C+VG's boy blunder, Jaz, proved to be quite an exciting one-one moment Gary was up Julian's end, and the next, the action switched to Gary's end! After a goalless first hall, Julian finally broke the deadlock with a fine round-thekeeper effort, and that's the way the score stayed. I was pleased to hear Gary grizzling all the way back to his desk. FINAL SCORE: JULIAN 1 GARY O MATCH NINE GARY VS ROB What a pair of plonkers. The man with a revolting growth of slimy face fungus, versus the man with the haircut of a demented sheep. What could one expect from a pair of players whose collective IQ is no greater than my shoe size? Nothing really, and this display of ineptitude proved the point. A match that, like the players, had no character the only surprise was that Gary managed to score. B-o-o-o-ring! FINAL SCORE: GARY 1 ROBO MATCH FIVE JULIAN vs STEVE Ego dribbling out of his ears, the lanky-locked one went into his second match with relish. However, his self-righteous smile disappeared as Steve smashed in an unstoppable shot. Early in the second half Julian got back into the match when he curled one into the back of the net, but victory for him was not to be, and in the final minute his defence became more of a shambles than his haircut, and Steve sliced his way through to stick in the winner. FINAL SCORE: JULIAN 1 STEVE 2 MATCH TEN LIAM vs STEVE The final match was played under a tense atmosphere. Could Steve win and go top of the league? Unfortunately not Liam tucked one into the net midway through the first half, and man aged to defend successfully for the rest of the match. What a revolting development FINAL SCORE: LIAM 1 STEVE O MATCH SIX STEVE vs GARY Having shown up C+VG's self-confessed top player as the true sham he is, Steve went into the next match with Gary \"friends of the tramps\" Harrod with much glee. It turned out to be quite a "


"THE LEAGUE STANDINGS Proving that there's no justice in this world, maestro of the limp (in more ways than one), Rob \"dying\" Swan, managed to end up top of the league. Bringing up the rear as usual was \"Jaz\" Rignall, while Steve Screech only managed a disappointing third. Gary Harrod was typically as close to the bottom as possible, while Liam propped up the table. a big disappointment for me. ROB ROB JAZ JAZ STEVE STEVE GARY LIAM LIAM P 4 4 4 4 4 W 2 2 2 2 1 D 1 0 0 0 1 L 1 2 2 2 2 F 4 4 3 2 2 A 2 3 4 2 4 PTS 7 6 6 6 SEMI-FINALS JULIAN 2 GAZ 1 With the score at 1-1 at the end of the game, the players went into injury time. Julian scored early on in the first period of extra time, and Gary, as usual, had neither the intelligence or intellect to reply. STEVE 2 RICH O A veritable brawl, with Steve getting two men sent off. But strongarm tactics proved to be the winner as Rich was beaten into submission THE KNOCK-OUT Perhaps things would change in the knock-out competition. I or dered three other competitors to be found to make up the numbers, and they were brought trembling before me Matt Regan and OZ Browne from MEAN MACHINES, and Richard Leadbetter from C+VG before I banished them to join the rest of the mob. All the entrants were put into my leather holster, and then drawn for the first round. 1ST ROUND GARY 2 MATTO The Harrod bounced back from his previous limp performance with a fairly convincing win. Well, as convincing as you'd expect against opposition as stiff as a Mr Bendy puppet in an oven. ROB O STEVE 1 The man whose limp changes with the tide finally saw his luck run out, and received a sound spanking from Steve, even though he tried to resort to dirty tactics! There IS justice in this world, after all! THE FINAL OZ 1 JULIAN 4 The joke performance of the challenge was kindly provided by Oz, whose sloppy joystick control defined incompetence. Even though the dull fool missed a penalty, he still managed to knock in four goals. JAZ 1 STEVE 4 Steve turned on the style as Julian's so-called \"skills\" wilted into insignificance as goal after goal was banged into the net. Hal These C+VG players simply aren't as good as they reckon... LIAM O RICH 1 In a match about as exciting as Rob's dress sense, Rich scored in the only goal. SADIE 32 "

Indiana Jones, Paperboy and Gauntlet are all totally fab carts and Impossible Mission continues the fine tradition. The graphics and sound are both completely terrific.

But it's the gameplay that counts, and US Gold have managed to capture all the tense excitement of the classic C64 game and then some!

Doy racers of the future get D their high speed thrills 'n spills at the gaseous globe of Jupiter, where a number of testing race tracks have been constructed. Here, the Masterdrive races take place and absolutely anything goes! Each car is not only equipped with obligatory turbos, high-power engines and supa-grip tyres but also hyper-death cannons ideal for wiping out the opposition if they're getting too speedy for their own good! There are a number of different competitions to take part in, including the usual set-number-of-laps affair to a race in which you have to drive over ten bonus tokens before the computer player does! When you win the race (or rather, if you win the race). it's time to toddle off to the shop where you can try to win some extra cash on the fruit machine, or use your money rather more judiciously and buy some extra bits for your car, boosting its power with turbos, larger fuel tanks, better engines and upgraded weapons systems!

The onscreen action is really swift and the car really handles well essential for the amount of twists the Jupiter tracks throw in your direction! The graphics are pretty good with a nice variety in all of the backdrops and some great animation on the cars themselves. Jupiter's Masterdrive is a playable effort, but it lacks a certain something that would really make it a really special game.

"GX4000 SPECTRUM EVIEW IIIIIIII NAVY SEALS BY OCEAN SPECTRUM .99 GX4000 .99 Tension has risen in the Middle East (pretty topical, eh?), to a stage where Arab extremists have shot down an American helicopter on a surveillance mission in Beirut, and are holding a group of American soldiers to ransom. Not only that, but they've also managed to get their hands on a large number of missiles, which can be fitted with nuclear warheads! Enter the Navy SEALS the US Navy equivalent to our SAS who are sent to rescue their comrades-in-arms, and do over more than a few Arabs on the way. The action is viewed sideon, with the team members having to run, jump, crawl, somersault and blast their way through six levels of platforms and obstacles, in order to both rescue the military hostages, and knock out the captured missiles. The terrorists aren't going to make your life easy, though, and will shoot on sight! Time is running out have you got what it takes? UPDATE The Navy SEALS will be flipping their way onto the Amiga (.99), ST (.99), and C64GS cart (.99) real soon now. We've had an early look at the C64GS game, and it looks a cracker, but if the programmers don't change the level of difficulty, it could end up the same way as the versions reviewed here. Huurgh! The Spectrum game is a monochromatic version of the GX-4000 one, except this is even less playable, because the main sprite has an annoying tendency to get stuck in silly places, leaving you wide open for a bullet in the bonce! Again, a very disappointing licence, and one that could have been made so much better by simply making it a bit easier. OVERALL 73% WIIIIIIIIII I thought seal-culling was illegal? Based on the forthcoming Charlie Sheen movie (which has been postponed for political reasons), Navy SEALS could have been Ocean's surprise biggiebut unfortunately it's not, and for two reasons. Firstly, and foremost, the gameplay is so bleeding hard, it'll have you pulling your hair out within minutes! The terrorists are so fast and ac curate with their guns that the only way to beat most of them is to remember where each one is from the game before, then find a safe position before they actually appear on screen. Your SEAL is also annoyingly prone during all the animated jumpingon-crates bits, and even when he's climbing a ladder he's a sitting duck and is easily shot down. The colourful and detailed graphics are SEALS greatest assets, but as I've already mentioned the animation on the player's sprite, though very realistic, gets in the way of the gameplay.

Chip has somehow got himself trapped in a huge number of four-way scrolling mazes and the only way to get out is to collect up all the chips in each maze. This task may sound about as challenging as putting on a hat, but when you consider where the chips have been placed around each maze, you may change your mind. Some are behind locked doors and chip can't open those doors without keys. Other vital chips are sometimes stashed behind rivers and blocks must be pushed over the water in order to cross. But there's plenty of other potentially death-inducing traps thrown in there too, including conveyor belts and ice, so Chip's certainly got his work cut for him considering that there's around 150 different mazes to conquer before he finally escapes the maze network!

The sound isn't much better with an annoyingly Jolly tune. However, there's something in the actual game that makes it strangely addictive. It's probably something to do with the fact that the game requires a fair amount of brain-power to actually get anywhere, so it's not likely that die-hard, megalaser death junkies are going to like this at all. Still, there's a certain satisfaction to be gleaned from finishing off a particularly devious round and with well over a hundred stages to keep you going, Chip's Challenge potentially provides hours of fun.

UPDATE That canny Newcastle lad is going to be making an appearance on the Amiga, ST, C64, and Amstrad CPC. All versions should be out by the time you read this. I must admit, I was expecting this Gazza simulation to be about as good as his singing (have you heard the full horror of \"Geordie Boys\"?), but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this footy sim. The on-pitch action is fast and furious, and in simultaneous two-player mode it's great laugh. The graphics are very Kick Off-esque and portray the action well, and on the whole the feel of the game is good. Unfortunately, there are a few niggly little things which prevent this from being a first division Soccer game. For example, there are no fouls and hence no free kicks or penalties, and passing is made difficult by the fact that none of the players play in position, (except the goalkeeper who stays firmly on his line no matter what). I could mention other things like the fact that the ball never leaves the ground, or the throw-ins which look like kick-ins, but when all's said and done none of the problems are so unbearable that they totally cripple the action. If they weren't there, though, this would be a great game, rather than just a good one. RICHARD LEADBETTER \"in-the-box\" action in Gazza 2 000 SPECTRUM .99 PLAYER RLBRNIR A Player one scores against the Amstrad goalie!

They set a great atmosphere for this game and this is only helped by the myriad of ace sampled effects and the cutesy music (which manages to be funky at the same time!). The actual gameplay itself is pretty limited just drive around the platforms changing their colours and then going to the next level. All this may sound about as interesting as being caught in a traffic jam, but Car-Vup is a strangely addictive game and the simple allout arcade action is probably the game's greatest asset.

"AMIGA SPECTRUM C64 EVIEW ZIIIIIIIIZ STUN RUNNER BY DOMARK/TENGEN SPECTRUM .99 C64 .99 AMIGA .99 STUN Runner is a brilliant arcade machine for one single reason. The polyLike the C64 version, this one uses sprites rather than vector graphics and though the graphics are defined better than they are in the 64 game, the 3D tunnel effect is severely headache-inducing. Again, this just doesn't have any of the high-velocity thrills of the arcade game, so as a conversion it's something of a failure. The programmer has completely forsaken polygon graphics (which the C64 wouldn't be capable of handling) for a jerky, flickery sprite look. Devoid of any redeeming features whatsoever, STUN Runner is a total travesty that all C64 owners should avoid like the plague. In this conversion of the monster Tengen coin-op. the player takes control of the STUN Runner craft, speeding bobsleigh-like through the Spread Tunnel Underground Network (STUN, see?) blasting a variety of enemy craft and overcoming all the hazards that the STUN organisers have left in the tunnels. You'll find stars that can be exchanged for Shockwaves (mega-destructive smart-bombs), and turbo pads which catapult your craft forward at 900 mph SO fast it even becomes transparent and invulnerable to enemy attack! Not bad, eh? There are also ramps that send your STUN ship flying into the air! The basic object as a STUN Runner is to speed through each level, picking up enough speed to beat the punishing time limits. That being the case, it's best to follow the outside curve of the tunnel as this is where your ship picks up the most speed. There are 24 levels of STUN Runner racing before your driver can claim the glory of the being the greatest racer in the known universe! OVERALL 24% OVERALL 20% MINIULIIIIIIIMIZ That's not the Dartford Tunnel, dear! STUN ship is an unmis sable and exhilarating experience. Unfortunately, Domark's conversion of the game lacks the speed of the original, and what's Telt simply doesn't play much like the arcade at all. It's a shame really be cause the graphics are prefly close to the coin-op and the sound is better still with an atmospheric Matt Furniss fune. Unfor tunately, the programm ing of the actual game isn't quite so good. AT times you can see the sky through the funnels, and sometimes if you cross the finishing line with no time to spare the computer ends the game any way! The STUNship doesn't really handle very well and the inertia gener ated by the twisty STUN tunnols isn't realistic al could've been a lot better but I'm afraid I can't even recommend this even to fans of the coln-op.

"AMIGA EVIEW MIIIIIIIII Doug Quaid is a troubled Dman. Haunted by dreams of Mars, mysterious women and death, he travels to Rekall Incorporated, a company specialising in implanting memories in this case, a journey to Mars to discover the truth behind the disturbing nightmares But something goes drastically wrong, revealing Quaid's life to be a complete lie. To discover what and who he really is, Quaid takes a journey to the red planet but unknown to him, he is being tailed by Richter and his se curity forces, controlled by Mars's ruthless governor, Cohaagen. The first and third levels are platform based, in which Quaid has to hunt down cerlain items that will reveal more of who he really is. Stages two and four are car chases in which our schizo BY OCEAN UPDATE hero has to race a commandeered taxi through the Martian colony's main streets, smashing through gates and generally attempting to avoid your pursuers. The final level, in platformarama once again, sees Quaid searching out Kuato, the mutant who will reveal Quaid's secret and how to set Mars free! ST, Spectrum, Amstrad and C64 versions of Total Recall are currently under development and they're all scheduled to appear in January dade Big-headed Mr Quaid legs it with two Michael Ironside lookalikes hot on his heels! AMIGA .99 As I recall, this movie was all special effects and not enough plot, and in this respect Ocean's game is completely faithful to the film. The graphics throughout the game are pretty smart (although the sprites are cartoony, rather than being exact Arnie-alikes), and the music and effects are really atmospheric. What I didn't like about Total Recall was the fact that playing it was just like playing the car chase sequence out of the 8 bit versions of Batman and the platform bits out of Batman/Untouchables/Robo cop/Robocop II/Navy Seals. I don't know about you lot, but I'm getting a bit tired of every new Ocean film licence taking a very similar format. What's worse is that there isn't that much shoot 'em up action to make wandering the maze of platforms any more interesting. Quaid spends a lot of his time with a gun but without the use of it. This means he has to punch his enemies to the ground, and while you're punching them, they're pumping bullets into you! This is particularly annoying on the latter levels when you come across enemies who can stand five bullets and loads of punches. And of course once you've used up your single life and five continues you have to go through it all again right from the beginning. Overall, then, a very polished game, but one I can only recommend to very patient players who haven't become bored of Ocean's film licence format, which is beginning to look pretty tired nowadays. PAUL GLANCEY Will that \"?\" icon provide invulnerability or remove Quaid's shooting ability? That's the gamble... Get on the stripey lift and save your legs.

The only thing remaining the same are Mushashi and his mutt! The graphics are nothing outstanding and the sound consists of an okay tune with some soso spot effects. The playability is where things go completely to the wall, as it all seems to be a learning game (do something, get killed, then you know next time what's going to happen).

"EVIEW WIIIIIIIII UPDATE Ny-tnat Mickey Mouse is likely to reach any other system for the moment. Still, computer owners can try and get hold of an ancient Gremlin game based on the Disney superhero. It's not at all like the game reviewed here, but it is still quite a laugh! Swing through the stars for extra energy in the Megadrive version! Hon mot! EEEK! Surrounded by spiders! Where's Pluto when you need him? SEGA .99 Flippin' hell! When Mickey Mouse first arrived in the office, everyone was mightily impressed with the quality of the graphics. Mickey himself is a visual masterpiece with amazing Disneystyle animation and the cute sprites and wonderful backdrops just can't be faulted at all! The playability is a close rival for the Nintendo Mario series (Indeed, some of the puzzles struck me as being very familiar...) and there's a huge amount of strategies to be learnt before you finally vanquish the evil Mizrabel. With its massive variety of levels and secret rooms, Mickey Mouse ranks as the greatest platform game available for the Sega. Literally months of gaming fun are to be had with this cracking cart, so be sure to direct some of your rapidly diminishing Christmas money in Mickey Mouse's direction!

Mickey Mouse ranks as one of the most stunning carts available with truly cartoonquality sprites and backgrounds!

"ARC Anew up-the-screen Ablaster that recently appeared in the arcades is Outzone. It's programmed by Toaplan, whose previous efforts include Flying Shark, Truxton and Hellfire. The game casts the player as a battle-hardened mercenary who's job it is to yomp up the vertically scrolling landscape blast ing all and sundry. There's no prizes for guessing that there are plenty of powerups to collect, and that a big guardian is found at the end of each level. Although it's completely and utterly predictable, the game is fairly good fun in its own way. The graphics and sound are both excellent, It's just a shame that the programmers of this game weren't turned towards producing something more original and exciting, rather than just rehashing an age-old idea which we've already seen about a million times.

"SUCCESS JOE An unoriginal, but pretty enjoyable boxing coinop that'll hit the arcades in the next few weeks is Success Joe. It's very similar to Nintendo's 1983 coin-op hit, Punch Out!!! and gives the player a 3D behind-thegloves view as he punches his way to victory (or not, as the case may be). The graphics are great, with large, humorous, cartoon-style sprites (some of the expressions they make are hilarious) and some superb between-screen pictures. The gameplay is pretty tough, and some of the later boxers are well challenging, requiring quick thought and strategy to win. If you fancy an enjoyable and pretty off-beat fighting game, pile a couple of ten pence pieces into Success Joe.

The player controls Edward Randy, a fellow with an unfortunate name in a perilous situation. He's got to biff and bash his way across scrolling enemy territory in a typically heroic fashion. It's pretty good fun, and some of the levels, particularly the one where he battles across the wings of aeroplanes, add a bit of spice to the action. Check it out if you fancy a fight.

You can conquer cities and then tax the inhabitants, using the money to build up your armies or improve their weapons and armour. Small towns usually pay their taxes to larger cities, so if you can take out a major city then it's likely that all its associated villages will become part of your realm! Obviously, other leaders aren't just going to sit about, so watch out for other armies taking over bits of your land! The game is reminiscent of one of Braybrook's first C64 games, Gribbly's Day Out, except that in Fire and Ice, the player takes control of a cute dog with huge flapping ears, and the objective is to find a number of small puppies and lead them to safety. The problem is! the inhabitants don't like puppies much and are out to get them. The backgrounds change according to the time of day! and the time of day is also reflected in the action, so, when it gets dark new creatures appear and other go back to their homes and rest! Fire and Ice looks like being another Braybrook clas. sic, with super-smooth gameplay and intelligent meanies (some are actually afraid of others!). You may think that these screenshots look good, but don't be fooled! Graftgold are planning major renovations in the graphics department, and this should all add up to red-hot arcade-quality action! As we go to press, there's no firm news on who will be releasing the game, but watch out for it during the Summe Realms is extremely well-presented.

Featuring the same style of top-notch animation that was featured in the original, along with a greater control of the ball, Pro Tennis Tour 2 looks like being a simulation to watch out for. There's also a great line in sampled speech with an amazingly realistic umpire. Even at these early stages Pro Tennis Tour 2 looks very promising. Watch out for the review in a forthcoming C+VG. RELEASE: ST, AMIGA, EARLY '91 PRICE: TBA gold ayction een and r of mis, ut to DRAGON'S LAIR 2 TIMEWARP READYSOFT If you're into the cartoon-quality capers shown in Igames like Dragon's Lair and Space Ace, then you're no doubt going to flip over this latest Readysoft offering! Featuring the same combination of brilliant graphics and sound, Dragon's Lair 2 Timewarp looks and sounds a treat. Unfortunately, from what we've seen of the finished product, the limited interaction of its older brothers once again rears its ugly head.

Now they're set to blast back with a new eight-way scrolling shoot 'em up, and from the looks of it, it could be a bit of an eye-opener! Featuring pretty decent extra weaponry and plenty of motherships to blow into oblivion, this offering does look pretty promising. Watch out for a review in C+VG soon. RELEASE: AMIGA, ST, PC, JAN/FEB.

"REVIEW TIIIIIIIIII SPACE ACE MOTIVETIME Islanbarlikse Motivatisus havicePP8A18 wholesales as they've just about finished a Nintendo version of the old laserdisk arcade game. Funnily enough, this Amiga version looks rather similar to the NES conversion of Dragon's Lair, replacing the cartoon quality graphics with horizontally scrolling action. As yet the quality of the game is unknown, but rest assured, as soon we have more, we'll pass it along. RELEASE: AMIGA, NINTENDO, JAN/FEB PRICE: TBA 3D CONSTRUCTION KIT INCENTIVE/DOMARK Demember Freescape (TM)? The system used to creNate Driller, Dark Side, Total Eclipse and Castle Mas. ter? Well, those wacky funsters at Incentive (with a little help from their friends at Domark) are about to unleash a construction kit that allows you to create 3D environments that you can use in your own games, or even create a strange new world to explore and change at your own leisure! Sounds a bit good, eh? If the speed of the polygons is up to scratch, this could be a bit special, and no mistake!

But now it seems that Motivetime bly Line (responsible for the likes of Vaxine, E-Motion (again!) are just about ready to unleash their converand 16-bit Exterminator), this 3D adventure features sion of Paperboy on the Megadrive! As you can see amazingly fast graphics that seem to be even faster from these shots, the game isn't shaping up that badly than the superlative Damocles! There promises to be at all, although the graphics look decidedly similar to plenty of puzzling excitement on offer here, as the the Amiga version.
