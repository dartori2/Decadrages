Now it's been a very long time since Paul reached into his game drawer, held each one into the light and shouted its name, before polishing the box and placing it back. So, as you can imagine, he's quite worried. Like, maybe it's because he has neglected his children that this awful event transpired? We'll let you know once we have received word from his Psychiatric nurse. Never to return, we might add. Yes Tom Cox gave CVG the elbow, after he found out how much better it would be to work freelance: More money, more sunshine, and more time with his missus. \"Thass the honest trufe guv\", he told Paul, \"Ssnot anyffing to do with 'aving ta work late and for no money... and BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO BY A BUNCH OF IDIOTS WHO WOULDN'T KNOW A DEADLINE FROM A DEAD ARM...\" And so it went on, until Paul asked quietly for help. eplacing Tom Cox in the \"don't like games much, but just one more go' position is Mike Newson. We needed a deputy for Jaime, and Mike is the right man for the job. We must warn you, however, that Newson once used to work on Maximum magazine; an intense publication if ever there was.

"computer Video games NEWSODE Veure NEW CHARACTER VF3 NEW CHARACTER! ANOTHER PS PRICE DROP! t the recent Tokyo Toy Show Sega unveiled the second new VF3 character, to join the beautiful but deadly female Aoi Umenokouji. Sumo Takarashi once again observes a distinct Japanese style, though there are still no details about his background story or how he'll use his Sumo skills. We suspect he probably has a modified Sumo technique to balance his performance against other fighters. Mr Yu Suzuki talked enthusiastically about the new addition to a select audience. Just to remind you of the astounding quality of movement we can expect from Takarashi, dictated by the power of the Model 3 board: His ceremonial apron (Kesho-mawashi) is made of silk, so will ripple just like the real thing. Just like Jeffry, the musculature of this highest ranked Sumo wrestler (Yokozuna Rikishi) will tense and swell to mimic a real body almost perfectly. Yes, VF3 is that amazing.

While nobody knows the exact nature of the project yet, it is said to be following similar guidelines of all N64 development promotion of the 3D stick for revolutionary gameplay features, and the speed advantage of cartridge over CD. The comments of Eric Caen, co-founder and R&D team manager of Titus, offer further testament to the power of N64: \"After researching next generation technology, we hoped that the Nintendo 64 would reach the same performance level as the $100 000 SGI Indigo2 High Impact workstation. Indeed it has.\" Sega is to establish a cool new service in co-operation with one of the world's largest cable communications companies Flextech plc in August. Called Sega Channel, the thinking behind it is that there are over two million Mega Drive owners in the UK, many of who might appreciate unlimited access to a regularly updated library of 25 games for .95 per month? These titles are updated month on month, with the most popular games being kept on to keep regular uses happy. Games are downloaded into a special Mega Drive adaptor where they are stored until replaced by another, or the console is switched off. There are five categories of games: The Arcade (X-Men, Batman Returns, Ranger-X); Strategy Room (Shining Force, Thor); Family Room (Flicky, Garfield); Sports Arena (Striker, California Games); and The Speedway (Outrun, G-Loc). Those are just some examples of those that will be available. The most promising feature of Sega Channel is that preview versions of games will become available before they are on sale. So you could be playing top titles such as Sonic 3D at least a month before anyone else. Telewest Communications plc are the first supporters of the service in the UK, after being very happy with trials held in Essex and Kent. So expect to be paid a visit from their sales rep soon!

"computer video games NEWS O CQUAKE) The arcitechture for the new levels is much more impressive than in the qtest. Some of the underwater maze sections are just staggering! REVENGE OF THE SON OF DOOM PART 3! e're up to the sixth installment of our \"comprehensive' Quake : As it stands, registered Quake will feature four coverage, and the shareware version hasn't even come out episodes of nine levels, each with a different environyet! Blimey! We ought to start a regular Quake section in the mental theme (relating to various time periods). The magazine or something! first level of every episode is set inside a high-tech government installation, and at the end of the stage Quakemania reached fever pitch in the CVG office this month, as the first concrete facts about  you discover a Slipgate which takes you to that shareware Quake started to pour in from various sources around the globe. Eye witness accounts: episode's Quake base. from E3, internet reports from beta testers and journal extracts from the game's head program  The shareware release will comprise the entire first mer have all helped paint a clearer picture of what will undoubtebly become the biggest PC episode, which is set in the past and filled with a release of the year, if not the decade! mixture of military and mediaeval architecture. There is  also talk of a number of deathmatch only levels on the final registered version, though that could change. INSIDER QUAKE INFORMATION! Wow! Look at that symbol on the ceiling! And the wood! It's unbelievable! Quake's 3D graphics engine takes PC gaming to the next level and beyond. How will the PlayStation and Saturn conversions cope with this level of detail?! JACKANORY! There's the Quake logo in a cemetary! Ace! NEWS There's the rocket launcer as it used to be. Apparently this will only appear during deathmatch in the shareware version. With the imminent release of shareware Quake, id have finally settled on a background story to go with the game. In the near future, the government have created a top secret machine (based on alien technology) called the Slipgate. When operated, the Slipgate causes an earthquake in the time/space continuum, creating a crack in time through which humans can travel to the past or future. However, a deadly terrorist organisation known as Quake have managed to steal a Slipgate, and are using it to stage surprise hit-and-run attacks on military installations all over the world. Which is where you come in. As a highly trained counter terrorist expert, you've been drafted in by the government to infiltrate Quake's base and shut down their operation at all costs. The fate of the free world rests on your shoulders! Again! Dead monsters stay where they drop. It's not known whether you can blow up the corpses a la Duke Nukem 3D, but we hope so. 10 "


"computer video games Long drops are potentially fatal in Quake so watch where you tread. If you fall only a short way, you'll hear a horrible crunching sound as your characters legs break! Eurgh! The Dog is quite easy to kill, especially when using the Super Nailgun as demonstrated above. However, they do attack in packs, and their large numbers can sometimes overwhelm you. LEVEL SELECT, QUAKE STYLE ARRGH! REAL MONSTERS! Quake does away with the user-friendly difficulty and episode select menus of Doom, and instead makes them both into individual levels! The difficulty select is a large open chamber with three hallways leading to a visible Slipgate at the end of each one. The first hallway (the easy difficulty) has a flat floor and no obstacles, while the second hallway (normal) has an angled bridge and looks a bit more intimidating. The third hallway (hard) has a broken bridge with a bubbling pit of lava underneath! There's even a secret route for the nightmare difficulty level! After you choose your difficulty setting you are warped to another stage where you must choose between four Slipgates each corresponding to one of the four episodes. The monster development continues with some hellish new additions to the Quake extended family and improved artifical intelligence all round. Highlights include the dog, the Hell Knight (a harder versions of the knight who uses magical attacks), the Enforcer (like the soldier but dressed in a chemical suit), the Tar Baby (a near invisible blob who explodes when he dies) and a spider monster who throws homing fireballs like the Revenant in Doom 2. All of the monsters are now much more aggressive, and if you don't kill them they will chase you from one end of a level to another, even through water! One of the beta testers told tales of a Shambler actually JUMPING OFF AN ELEVATED BRIDGE and running after him! Awesome! SMEN Apparently, the Shambler is female. Could have fooled us. 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 relaxing Sunda. PROVE "


"computer video games NEWS O PUMP UP THE VIOLENCE! In its time Doom was one of the most gory games around, and id look set to continue this tradition with Quake. All of the monsters have multiple gruesome death sequences (complete with 'orrible death rattles), and it is now possible to gib absolutely any creature in the game! Gibbing, by the way, is when you blow something (or someone) into bloodied chunks, each called a gib. The Zombie, for instance, can only be destroyed by gibbing. Quake also sees the return of Doom's explosive barrels, along with crushing ceilings, deadly lava, and giant spikes! The explosions now have a sprite core to make them less pixely. They're also light sourced. This thing's offical name is the Fiend'. He's incredibly agile for his size, and some major strafing is neccessary if you don't want to get caught under that leap. INSIDER QUAKE INFORMATION! Watch the gibs fly! Here the new look grenade lobber takes apart a duo of marauding Hell Knights. You can tell them from ordinary Knights because they've got spiked shoulder pads and horns on their helmets. Look at the way the blood spatters on their armour. That's top that is. LETHAL WEAPONS All of the weapons have received a graphical make over, with some of them completely changing in both appearance and properties. The Axe now looks a lot cooler (thankfully) with about three different attack sequences, while both the shotgun, rocket launcher and grenade lobber have all been slightly touched up. The biggest changes however are in the nailguns. The ordinary nailgun is now a double-barrelled beast that fires twin streams of nails, while the super nailgun looks a bit like a black version of the rotating chaingun in Doom, and rocks the screen when you fire it! The Enforcer fires bursts of laser beams from that cannon. Later in the game you can collect a cool Bio Suit like his that lets you breath underwater. SOUNDS GOOD! WEWS One of the biggest new additions to Quake is the implementation of ambient environmental 'background' noise. For example, when standing around an open area, you can hear the wind blowing high above you. Water makes a slow, splashing sound; slime burps and churns; lava bubbles and crackles; computer terminals bleep and click; heavy machinery rumbles... you get the idea. What's more, Nine Inch Nails have done an entire sound track to be included on the final CD! We haven't heard any of it yet, but we've been told its ace! Can't wait The new look Nailgun makes short(ish) work of a rogue Shambler. The screen actually rocks slightly when you fire this weapon, and the sound it makes is absolutely perfect! You won't see the lightening gun in shareware Quake. 12 "


"I HAVE THE POWER! Compute videc game Like Doom, Quake will feature several power ups dotted about the many levels, each with varying effects. Along with the standard health and armour bonuses, players can find artifacts to boost the power of their weapons, make them invisible (all that's left are a pair of floating eyes!) and even allow them to swim underwater. The invincibility power up (called Satan Mode!) is a floating red pentagram which, when collected, makes your armour rocket up to 666%! This game's far more evil than Doom the game of the devil! FIVE THINGS YOU NEVER KNEW ABOUT QUAKE 1. Quake is the name of John Carmack's character he used to play as in Dungeons and Dragons. Hence the original fantasy setting of Quake. 2. Quake has already been banned in Germany! 3. id started work on Quake before Doom. NEW 4. id timed John Carmack to see how long it would take him to implement dynamic lighting in Quake! It took him one hour, including toilet breaks! Zombies can hide underwater. Well they are dead already. The locked doors have huge chains and bars accross them. So you have to go looking for a key to unlock them. 5. We WILL have shareware Quake by next issue, and if you can find it on the net, so will you! 13                   play HARD.

Imagine the crowds here on N64 launch day. TIME 01' 0120 y the time you read this, the N64 has been available in Japan for almost two weeks. But we still thought you'd appreciate sharing in some of the excitement which occurred in the run up to launch day. 1934400OUVE Pre-orders for N64 were officially stopped on the 9th of June. By that time, 100% of all possible reservations had been accounted for. To appease those left out who still wanted the chance to buy a machine, many shops announced they were opening the doors at 12:00 midnight to steady the flow of thousands more customers on first day of sale. SEA LEVEL SPEED FUEL 55 km/h Word has it, there's only one copy of Pilot Look at them! Row upon row of N64s with Wings for every five N64s. Worrying news if it crowds packed around them. If only stores turns out to be true. here would do this kind of thing! 159 ODNJININ NY NIM In the two weeks prior to launch, shops had N64s running copies of Super Mario 64 to satiate the public's need for this monumental game. Time with the controller was limited to five minutes per person, and our overseas correspondent has reported that tempers were getting pretty fraught under the circumstances maybe because five minutes is barely enough time to get off the first level, so those queuing for a go were getting even more frustrated. While all this was going on, camera crews filmed the faces of awestruck kids and adults alike for national TV news. If only you lot got so excited about games, eh! This is the game. The one that's been causing a sensation at stores all over Japan. Look below! You can win it with the machine! Five minutes kid, that's all you've got. Imagine what's going through the heads of these people, after waiting for so long. WIN A NINTENDO 64 HOT FROM JAPAN! o  NEWS ell, maybe you are excited about N64, but don't have the same opportunity to show it as those lucky Japanese. Our competition to win an N64 (printed last month) has proven our most popular yet. Every day almost two-thirds of our mailbag consists of brilliant designs for a new Super Mario power-up, including some pretty far-out suggestions for the tie-breaker. We suspect there are thousands more of you who'd love a better chance at winning one of the first N64s in the world. So we're increasing the odds in your favour, as CVG now has TWO N64S TO GIVE AWAY! A rare commodity indeed. That's how much we DO LOVE YOU! Closing date for the competition in issue #176 was 23 July. That deadline has been extended until 20 August. The rules are the same: invent a new power-up for Mario. Show us what the power-up looks like, and the effects it has on Mario. When you're satisfied with the result, send to us with the answer to this tie-breaker: How did Yoshi acquire arms to steer in Super Mario Kart? Send your entries to: YOSHI USES HIS OWN EGGS IN HIS COOKIES COMP (Mk.2), CVG, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London, EC1R 3AU And YES you can ENTER TWICE if your second idea is so much better than the last. Best of luck, we're looking forward to printing some of the best ideas in CVG sometime very soon. NINTENDO 64  Nintendo/ Paradigm 14 "

"COMPUTER video games he after-effects of E3 have made themselves felt in no uncertain terms! Though N64 isn't scheduled to arrive in the UK until Christmas at the earliest, it has left many 32-bit users feeling insecure. To which we say, \"WHAT, ARE YOU MAD!\" E3 was an excellent event for Saturn and PlayStation too, y'know. Just  for those systems now! What? Did we say something wrong?

DON'T SELL ME CHEAP LONG TIME NO SEE CAT TITTER CVG Dear CVG, I find your magazine very good for a read with over 100 pages, and it is cheap. However you do have some bad points. For example you say on the front of your magazine. \"Every new game reviewed and rated\". This is not true because I own a Jaguar and I consider myself a Jaguar expert. I know that you have not reviewed 1-War, Battle Morph CD, Creature Shock CD, Primal Rage CD, Hoverstrike CD, and Myst CD. All of which are available to buy in the shops at the time this letter was written. You also said in your preview of Quake, \"Saturn. PS, N64 versions planned\". Don't you even know about the Jaguar version? It is already 32% complete. I am 14 years old and have to go to school and revise for my exams. SO no matter how hard I try I can't dedicate my whole life to my Jaguar and consoles. But you get paid to do this, so why do I know more about Jaguars than you? Please do not slag off the Jaguar because it really is a good machine if you have the Jaguar CD, and don't forget the Jaguar 2 and 3 which will be released Christmas 96 and 97. Please give me a Sega Saturn as, after the Jaguar, it's a great games machine.

Do you know is Alpha 2 is going you know a games market to to be launched on the Saturn and/ or what news of Street be. As for the British titles, Fighter 3? Could the Saturn handle Virtua Fighter 3, and if they have less of an excuse! so when will it be released? If Sega do make a 64-bit console, will it be a standalone or a Saturn add-on? In the UMK3 review last issue (175) you mentioned a 100% damage combo with Smoke, for the original MK3 game. I can get a 100% damage combo with Resident Kabal, on the Mega Drive game. Just wondering, can you? Evil, delayed! GREAT mag. High Five is a good idea! So go boil your head, someone from Solihull. PS Will there really be a 32-bit Game Boy and how much might it cost? Phil Westmancoat, Wolverhampton CVG: Our claim is relevant to all new games that are soon to be available, or at least have been presented to us for review purposes. We did ask Atari to provide us with samples of all those games you mentioned, Jonathan, but they just didn't pass them on. So we focused on subjects per ceived hotter at the time ie Sega, Sony, and Nintendo all of whom were more forthcoming with software. By the way, you're kidding yourself if you think Quake will ever be released on the Jaguar that system is now defunct. WELL, CAN THE SATURN HANDLE VF3? LETTERS Dear CVG, I am a PlayStation owner who bought the machine from a well-known retailer. It cost me  with Tekken, Ridge Racer, and Jumping Flash. I had planned to buy one for a while, and, on purchase, was really impressed with Sony's Baby. However I have just heard that the PlayStation price is now reduced by  to . To add insult to injury, the deal I secured with the three games now only costs  a massive saving of . Now it took a lot of time and hard work to save almost  to buy my PlayStation, and at the time I was satisfied with my decision. But now my loyalty has been thrown back in my face. I am all for Sony having a low price to compete with the Saturn, and to mop up more of the prospective Super Console owners. After all the extra revenue the PlayStation attracts will benefit me in terms of better software. However a  decrease overnight really p****s me off. What the hell is going on? Here's a tip Sony: Don't treat your customers with contempt, else I'll buy a Nintendo 64. I want answers. Rob Allen, Staffs. CVG: Yu Suzuki, Director of all AM's divisions and head of AM2, has gone on record as saying that VF3 is possible on Saturn. Make of that what you will. Ed: Yes, on the Mega Drive. But you can't do it on the Saturn because all his combos have been weakened. CVG: You need a holiday. So we suggest going to Tokyo for a week, chill out in a cool hotel, and go shopping in the Akihabara district for an N64. It'll cost you less than the  you're considering to buy the machine on import No sign of PS X-Men either! 16 "

Dear CVG, Oh dear, dear, dear. Reports state that Sega are bringing out a new 3D romp to rival Mario 64, and an analogue controller as well. Who are Sega trying to copy? Hmm, Nintendo? No doubt this new controller will be a quickly made bad rush job, and try to pitifully attempt to rival Nintendo's new controller. And what's the betting that the ideas and the new controller were : up and put into development iveniently after the Shoshinkai how in Japan where Nintendo evealed their forthcoming plans? Nhy can't Sega just be content n being second best to Jintendo? Everyone knows that ega will never have the proper ge on Nintendo. And why? Because people don't trust Sega. Only a few months after releasing the Saturn they are report ed to be working on a Saturn 2! What! Do I hear another transitional machine (Saturn)? They never learn. So that means people will have wasted their money again because Sega drop machines when another one comes out (32X, Game Gear, Mega CD). Why can't they fully exploit their new technology like Nintendo? That's why people don't trust Sega. Go on, I dare you to print this letter. I bet you won't, you favour Sega anyway!

VOICE OF THE MASSES HARDER THAN YOU CVG: While we have the highest respect for Nintendo, they're not the only innovators out there. Nintendo's success rate is so high, simply because they are more careful with the number of products they release. Saturn is definitely not a transitional machine for Sega. Sure, the analogue controller idea is an answer to Nintendo's. But this doesn't make the result any less worthwhile. As for your last comment, CVG is a fan of everything original and exciting. Sega product fits quite nicely into that bracket at the moment, that any one with eyes can appreciate. 999 17 "

Well, all that could be set to change with the first PlayStation-dedicated adventure. ROM o date, there's been only one pointand-click adventure on PlayStation. Discworld. And it was a huge success! Not surprising really, considering it's a direct port of an excellent PC game based around the best-selling Terry Pratchett books. However, if Discworld has any weakness, it's the fact that it is just a PC portover. For a PlayStation game, it all looks a bit primitive. At least, that's what York-based developers, Revolution, reckon. And they're not just spouting hot air. This is the team that put together Beneath A Steel Sky, one of the best PC adventures to date. And their next project promises to be far better. For Broken Sword, Revolution have drawn on the finest cinematic, animation and musical talents around. What's more, they've concentrated on optimising the PlayStation version to make full use of the hardware. This game could well demonstrate that PC isn't the natural home for point-and-click adventures at all! BRCKEN STUNNING ADVENTURE WITH AMAZING GRAPHICS! Backdrop detail unlike any seen before! Characters move freely behind scenery. PLAYSTATION POWERI madeirsma creado por The PC version is already in its Beta stage (final testing) and looks incredible. However, Revolution claim the PlayStation version is going to be even more impressive. The PS's FMV capabilities have allowed them to increase the colour and resolution of the cartoon streams. Likewise, the speed and frame rate of the in-game animation is superior. This is all due to the PlayStation version being created alongside the PC game.

"computer video games TIS THE STUFF OF LEGENDSI * PlayStation Broken Sword is a game steeped in ancient myth. «All the historical information used in the plot is thoroughly researched and accurate, however it doesn't ram a history lesson down your throat.\" explains Charles Cecil, director of Broken Sword. \"It's similar to an Indiana Jones movie in that respect.\" Indeed, the plot covers similar historical territory to the likes of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It's all based around the legend of the Knights Templar, an ancient sect of warrior monks from the Tenth Century crusades, who lived in the Temple of Solomon and dedicated their lives to protecting the Holy Land from the Saracens. They were said to have committed hideous atrocities during the peak of their power, and also possessed incredible treasures, including the Crown Of Thorns and the Holy Graill However, in the Fourteenth century, to escape persecution by King Philip of France, their massive fleet vanished taking their treasure with them! Broken Sword's superb cartoon intro starts the plot rolling. Introducing the main character, George Stobbard, a californian enjoying a holiday in Paris, the action soon kicks in, when a streetperforming clown steals an elderly gentleman's briefcase, before blowing up a cafe! As it turns out, this clown is a member of terrorist cult, the briefcase contains a medieval manuscript and George is plunged into a race to uncover the legendary power of the Templars! ROM SWORD EAR CANDYI CARTOON TIMET The sound in Broken Sword has been carefully calculated. Music subtly underscores the dialogue and only surfaces at precise moments. Professional soundtrack directors used their experience of influencing peoples moods, to help lay out the soundtrack. For instance, on entering an alley, spooky music starts up to create an ominous feel. But on future visits there's no music, as this would spoil the initial sensation of dread. What's more, individual music bites were created for each specific situation. The composer, Barrington Pheloung (bless you!). who was responsible for music on Inspector Morse, Truly Madly Deeply and Nostradamus, claims he's put together enough music Revolution has spent a considerable amount of time and money (over ,000,000 to date) on making Broken Sword as cinematic an experience as possible. To this effect, professional filmmakers were consulted for the project. For instance, using a low 'camera' view was suggested over the more regular heightened angle, to give the player a greater feeling of being there' The incredibly detailed backdrops (of which there are over 80) have all been hand-drawn by a senior artist from the Don Bluth studios. These scenes were then coloured using a computer art package. The sprites were also hand drawn by a host of international artists, including some who were responsible for the likes of American Tail and Tank Girl the movie.

Those who criticise it as just a walk-through 'seen-it-once' shooting game, don't know what they're talking about. Played in Ranking Mode, it's one of the greatest highscore challenges around. Hanging onto your x9 score multiplier is one of the most fearful feelings a game can generate! And now Virtua Cop 2 is set to take that sensation of terror further still! RELOAD!! SATURN SEQUEL TO GREATEST GUN GAME! FREE PLAY PRESS START Coin-op VC2 features considerably more impressive graphics and a large er play area than its predecessor, and there've been doubts as to whether AM2 would be capable of pulling off as accurate a conversion as they did with the original game. However, from this first version, signs are very positive. Currently, the graphics are at a slightly lower resolution than you'd expect, and the sound effects seem ropey. With AM2's near untarnished reputation for quality though, it seems likely that this is merely because these are early renditions. Once all the parts of the game are in place, touching up the quality of the textures and improving the sound quality will be much easier. This is something AM2 did with the conversion of original Virtua Cop. POLICE COMING SOON 333 PRETTY BOLD, AREN'T WE? Revealed at the Los Angeles E3 show was a surprisingly advanced playable demo of Saturn Virtua Cop 2. Only half of the beginner's level was actually there, however the demo seems to have been specifically made for the expo, as it features all the on-screen indicators, the music, the sound-effects and the speech things which aren't normally included until much later in development. And, aside from some minor missing details (the shootable road barriers, for instance), this whole section was basically complete!

A heart-stopping moment as rookie, Jayne Marshall, almost runs down some bystanders! Even this short section of game demonstrates how much tougher coding Virtua Cop 2 is going to be. The opening area leads into a spacious jewellry store, with multiple glass cabinets that can be destroyed. EVL gunmen run around an elevated balcony, and there are huge chandeliers that can be swung around when shot. This scenery manipulation, when used in the VC2 coin-op, led to enhancements in Saturn Virtua Cop the swinging hook on the level one warehouse being a prime example (it doesn't move in the arcade, just try it!). Most impressive of all though, is the car-chase scene. This shifts the 3D backdrops around at an amazing rate, and there's masses of interactive scenery (all the cars can be shot to pieces). All these features are already present, which bodes well for other complex areas such as the train stage which wends into the distance and the panoramic Zeppelin hangar. The only noticeable criticism, is that the demo was running about a third slower than the coin-op. Considering the Saturn conversion of the first game actually ran faster than its arcade parent though, this isn't something we need worry too much about. MISS!

Typically this is all the work of one mad scientist, which could amount to a lot of the same old thing only, the cure this time around is a 'tastefully nude' woman sitting astride a missile.

Originally Kim had planned to launch the missile herself, to waste the geek's nanotechnological parasite aka Machinehead. But the geek caught her in the act, and devised a perverse little game: survive his traps and he'll free Kim, then terminate his creation. Flying in a blue dream The Vorpal Blade hovers just above the ground, and players as Kimhave full 360° directional control. It behaves more like a hovercraft, as opposed to a ground-level jet-propelled aircraft. A cushion of air allows the VB to track the surface of any terrain as opposed to skimming above it. For example it's possible, to a degree, to rise up the curved walls of the Termite Warren.

ROM EAT THAT MOTHER #!$?ER! View from a missile AM -NM As you'd expect from Core Design, the landscapes in Blam! are pretty spectacular. Though not quite so spectacular as in Neon's Tunnel B1.

RELEASED BY OCEAN TEL: 0161 832 6633 PlayStation Rendered FMV is almost standard in today's games, but is still distinctly separate from the game itself. Amazing Studio's plan is to | merge the two... seamlessly! HEART OF I EYE-CANDY FROM THE MAKER OF ANOTHER WORLD! Isewhere in this magazine you can find the review of Delphine's Fade To Black on PlayStation. A game which takes the pioneering mix of incredible cinematic visuals and platform gameplay from predecessors, Another World and Flashback, and turns it into an mindboggling 3D adventure. On the flipside, we have Heart Of Darkness on Saturn. The brainchild of Another World's creator, Eric Chahi (who left Delphine to start his own company Amazing Studio), this game also aims to take the Another World formula and push it into new innovative realms. However, with Heart Of Darkness the basic platform formula has been kept, although that's not something you'd easily recognise. The visuals, you see, are simply awesome! Every bit as cinematically ground-breaking as Fade To Black, but which one will prove to be the true successor to Flashback? HEART OF THE MATTER! As you can see from the screenshots, Heart Of Darkness leans heavily into rendered graphics territory. Indeed, the game features some stunning cinematic scenes which unfurl the plot. The opening sequence shows the main character, a boy called Andy, misbehaving at school and being locked in a cupboard as punishment. Which, con sidering he's terrified of the dark, isn't very pleasant. After school he rushes home to see his dog, which promptly scampers off into some darkness. Thus Andy has to face his fear by following his pet. So he rushes home, builds a rocket car and follows... into another dimension! 1 All these are in-game shots. The quality is staggering! 26 "


"computer video games CAN'T SEE THE JOIN! YET ANOTHER WORLD? HOD's gameplay is clearly derived from the pioneering Another World. A straight mix of fighting baddies, reflex-testing manoeuvring and intricate puzzlesolving, all chopped together with cinematic scenes. So far it all looks to be shaping up well, but we hope there's more freedom to the gameplay than in Another World. The actual in-game graphics are made up of rendered backdrops and sprites, which perfectly match the many SGl-generated intermissions. This cinematic illusion isn't ruined by startstoppy loading times either. Amazing Studios have gone to great lengths to blend the two sections seamlessly. As the opening scene finishes (with Andy falling into a cave) so the game instantly begins. There's also a point, as you lead Andy up a cliff-face, where the FMV starts up. Suddenly we see Andy fall away from the cliff via an FMV sequence. However, this footage merges in as Andy is climbing. You don't realise you're no longer controlling him. That's how impressive the blending is. PlayStation This is the aforementioned cliff-face scene. It's still under player control here. ARKNESS 1 It's like Ed Lomas at work in his bedroom. HEART CONDITION The in-game view is very much like that of Another World. While this may be one of the first times you've heard of this game, we've been waiting for it for a long time! Heart Of Darkness has been in development for nearly four years, and was originally scheduled for PC release over a year ago. However, Sega have secured the firstrelease rights for the game on Saturn, with PC now to follow. To date, the game is rumoured to have cost near ,000,000 to develop. That's not without attracting its fair share of interest though. Both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas showed distinct interest in Amazing 1 \"What do you reckon, Spielberg old Studio's work at the recent E3. boy?\" \"I like it, George, I really do.\" 9 NOOS NWU \"Just like Jaws, George.\" NEXT MONTH...

Well, video games justice is finally going to be delivered via a game engine far superior to that of Doom! Yes, this really is a light-sourced and fully texture-mapped scene on the Saturn! EXHUMED uke Nukem 3D. If you read last month's review, you'll know we love it! Even with Quake imminent, Duke has managed to stand tall, thanks in no small part to its brilliant game engine. Why are we blethering on about all this? Well, Exhumed actually uses the Duke Nukem engine, amazingly translated onto the Saturn! Running as fast as Duke on a standard Pentium, Exhumed is a superbly impressive 3D maze shoot 'em up. This all bodes well for the forthcoming Saturn conversion of Duke Nukem. But who cares about that right now, cos Exhumed is shaping up to be totally excellent in its own right! Not a distant giant floating spider, but a small spider leaping right into your face. EXHUMED ENTER THE MUMMY'S TOMB! MUMM-RAH'S GUN STORE! To support its 3D maze-exploring, multi-weapon carnage fest, Exhumed has adopted an ancient Egyptian scenario. Each level is an ancient, temple/ tomb catacomb affair filled with THE TERRORS OF A THOUSAND YEARS AGO!! In the early five-level version we've played, these mainly consist of annoying red spiders, wasps and birds, with a couple of mad stereotypicallyclad magicians appearing further in. Expect the usual mummies and probably Anubis though. You can always judge these 3D maze games by the quality of the weaponry within. Po'ed, for example, featured meat cleavers and frying pans. CVG judgement: not good. Exhumed however, has a fair smattering of decent armaments that blend traits of Duke Nukem and Heretic. Being an archaeologist type, you start off with a machete and pistol., eventually acquiring the likes of a flame thrower and M-60 machine gun. Clearly though, the finished game sees you uncovering Ancient Egyptian artifacts of power on your journey. There's the Cobra Staff, which unleashes a deadly green spray. The Ring Of Ra gives you naughty groping hands that fire out red sparks. Most powerful of all though, is The Manacle. Charged up, it explodes a near-smart bomb ANUN BOMB COBRA STAFF FLAME THROWER M-60 MACHETE NOUS ININO There's some neat hieroglyphic texturing to give the tombs that authentic Ancient Egyptian look. MANACLE PISTOL RING OF RA! When you want to move onto another tomb, you just go back to your camel Bessie. 28 "


"computer Video games TUTANKHAMEN'S HANDY STREETFINDER OW WITH ADDED NECKI One factor that makes the Duke Nukem engine far superior to Doom, is its ability to put one floor above another. Thus Exhumed's levels are quite complex. Moreover, you can look up and down. Great for looking at the lovely Egyptian sky. Maze-exploration is only fun if you know where you're going. Thankfully Exhumed solves this problem in a similar way to Duke Nukem, by allowing you to overlay a transparent map onto the screen. This rotates around, making sure you only steer upwards, making it very easy to negotiate even the most complex tomb. Wow, you can look up this lift-shaft as you descend. Watch those spiders don't drop into your mouth though. EXHUMED LOOK, LIGHTING EFFECTS OVER HERE! Exhumed's most impressive feature is its lighting. When firing off your weaponry, the walls glow accordingly. It's particularly chilling when an enemy launches a fireball at you. Even outdoors it lights the floor up. Brilliant, and more proof the Saturn can do lighting effects. TOD  NOOS INIWUJ NEXT MONTH... EXHUMED UNWRAPPED Sega are publishing Exhumed on Saturn themselves, which is surely a good sign they're impressed by it. If it features the level of ingenuity and action that marked Duke Nukem, we could have a winner here. Review next month hopefully. "

Ommm. e've heard of games transporting players temporarily to an imaginary place. But permanently alter someone's life philosophy? That's an altogether more serious proposition. Yet the only way to succeed in Kowloon's Gate is by adopting the Chinese art of feng shui, by which students learn to manipulate the currents of power believed to govern the earth.

JPEG DUNGEONS SPLENDID SONY PSYCHO PS ADVENTURE These develop Warp's successful concept as used in D, and their forthcoming game EO (Enemy Zero). In the case of Sony's game, loading times are improved to an extent where they go unnoticed. A Yin Yang styled cursor directs your path. Click on the place you wish to go, and an animated sequence depicts the transition from one area to another. The adventure takes shape under these circumstances, with all conversation and interchange of key items between characters occurring here. And some people think the net is complicated now! tahta, ta?  toPay attention to clues. Like, don't visit this man's barber! Hermaphroditic Wig.

REAL-TIME DUNGEONS Once all the requirements are met in one section of the JPEG dungeon, gameplay continues in a 3D polygon environment. Enemies are encountered, and important items are found. Accomplishment of the given task in this situation is made easier by the presence of four Kowloon Navigators, professionals who know every corner of these dungeons.

It's not specific to QAD, meaning Jon intends to apply Beyond LandscapeTM, Polar Sprout, and ENID (Engine of Narrative Invention and Destruction) to other CS titles in development. SAROSODDSO COMING SOON Not polygons or voxels here. Jon's proprietary technology allows for superior Depth-Cuing and greater detail at closedrange. Backgrounds scale fluidly into the foreground, and the overall effect is more natural than badly clipped polygon landscapes. Polar Sprout No need to worry about the storyline too much with QAD. The idea is simply to collect 75% of hostages roaming some alien landscape, from the lux ury of a cool spacecraft. And it doesn't matter if you shoot 25% of them to make it easier! As well as the anti-aircraft fire, adversity takes the form of another CPU or player-controlled spacecraft with the same mission objective as you. It's simple, but frantic as heck. Jon wanted QAD to introduce hundreds of enemies into the battle, so created his own graphics engine to do the job. Polar Sprouts are described by Jon as 3D sprites, and are the end product of placing a complicated 3D polygon, fully texture-mapped model transformed by the new engine. That way Jon retains all the detail, and all the action he needs. ESCO) QUINTESSENTIAL COVERAGE CONTINUES Generates random scenarios for games a 'dungeon keeper' of sorts. In QAD this applies to the ridiculous storyline which changes each time. Once CVG has QAD to toy around with for any length of time, we'll bring you more in depth coverage.

We've played a near-finished version of Sonic Team's masterpiece, and now we're gonna tell you all about it! Face the G-force and scream! ard to believe it was only two months ago that we showed you first pictures of this incredible action game. But in this short space of time, events have progressed at an mind-boggling rate. And nothing has been more surprising or exhilarating than the news that NIGHTS' Japanese launch date is (or in your case was) the 29th June, not September worldwide as we were previously told. Suddenly, this abstract dream-flying concept has become a full-blown rollercoaster-pinball-speed-challenge! If this is what Sonic Team's dreams are like, they must wet their beds every night and have shot-white hair. If Sonic could fly, this is how it would be with a rocketpack strapped to his back!! cits IS THIS THE BEST 3D SEEN ON 6 9254570 From what we can gauge, it seems some people's conception of how NIGHTS plays is a good deal different from the actual thing. Maybe we haven't explained it clearly enough, or perhaps you've been reading the wrong magazines. Whatever, with the final in-game features now present, we can clarify the situation. It's all a lot simpler than it looks! E PESKY KIDS! As we've explained before, when playing as either Claris or Elliott you have total freedom to wander around the 3D landscape.

Once NIGHTS completes one, he immediately moves onto the next. Course maps, like the ones seen here, can now be viewed before each level, together with the best completion score for each one.

While the graphics are polygon-generated, the gameplay is definitely of the 2D variety. Classic runningin-one-direction stuff, dodging obstacles, bashing baddies and smashing open crates. However, to add a new slant to the traditional proceedings, the game is split into two linear styles.

While the company is establishing itself as a leading sports game developer, Konami is best known for amazing action games. Now, on the 32-bit systems, they're back with a vengeance! KONAMI. to take a look at two key titles in developers 47-Tek in San Francisco, then a hile Paul was over in America to cover E3, he was invited by Konami to take a look at two key titles in development. This involved visiting 2nd-party developers 47-Tek in San Francisco, then a further pilgrimage to the sacred in-house R&D at Chicago. In both places our intrepid Editor had his eyes and ears well and truly blasted! Here's what he came back with. KONAMIIR&D KONAMI R&D SPECIAL FEATURE Why would a huge company like Konami assign a major project to a little-known San Francisco development team? Well, it started when Konami decided to publish their own 3D fighting game. But not just to equal Tekken or Virtua Fighter, but to TEK produce the world's first true 3D fighting game. 47-Tek have been breaking a lot of ground with 3D technology for almost three years. They also share a combined total of 35 years experience within the various martial arts disciplines, and profess to a \"long-time fascination with Japanese animation and science fiction.\" You could say that 47-Tek have a destiny to make this game. It's title? KUMITE! KONAMI. Vumite the FIGHTER'S EDGE EVEE To date nobody has explored 3D fightThis is Karambi, who was ing in the way that 47-Tek have with raised by hunting cats. Kumite. For Director Derek Mitchell, himself a third-degree black belt in Tae-kwon-Do, it is important that his game portray martial arts in their truest sense. To this end 47Tek have concentrated on develHere's some real fighting oping these action from Kumite. key factors: 42 "


"computer video games \"WE ARE WOEFULLY UNHAPPY WITH MOST FIGHTNG GAMES ON THE MARKET. LOOKING AT IT FROM A MARTIAL ARTIST'S STANDPOINT. PRIMARILY BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE REE RANGE OF MOVEMENT.\" DEREK MITCHEL, 47-TEK PlayStation X-ING SEGA SATURN In any form of one-on-one combat, it is never the case where moves take place on a 2D plane. The most sensible thing to do when being attacked is to side-step out of the way. Those who know what they're doing may side-step toward, or away from their opponent, then execute a technique of their own. This is called X-ing because if the action were viewed from above this is the pattern you would see. Introducing this crucial element has enabled 47Tek to clearly distinguish Kumite from any other fighting game out there. KONAM PECIAL FEATURE I X-ING N X-ING OUT KONAMI R&D SPECIAL FEATURE Imagine that the opponent is throwing a punch with his right arm. A savvy fighter may \"X' forward and to the right, stepping in to hook the attacker with a left to the stomach. Moving away and to the side from an attack leaves fighters with some entertaining options. You could trip someone who has gone for a high kick. Or retaliate with a powerful hook or roundhouse. (47 \"OUR ARTISTS HAVE TO KNOW HOW A BODY MOVES, BECAUSE WERE NOT USING MOTION CAPTURE DEREK MITCHELL ON WHY ALL 47-TEK DESIGNERS ARE REQUIRED TO LEARN MARTIAL ARTS. NJURY KATA FRAMNG Kumite's advanced hit detection system allows for all fighters to sustain damage. When a comparatively weak area is targeted by a powerful strike, it will become visibly bruised. Similarly in weaponsbased combat, puncture wounds will occur. In both cases the damage temporarily handicaps a fighter The world's best fighters are able to confuse challengers with misleading techniques. 47-Tek have identified three key elements to any attack: the Salute, or Ready position; the Transitional; and the Finish. For Kumite to imitate a true martial artist, and to enable players to tap into this way of thinking, 47-Tek have mapped these three stages into all moves for all characters. This technique is called \"Kata Framing\", where three frames are used to plot a move, and the computer interpolates all the rest. Essentially this allows players to custom their moves on the fly, according to Derek \"Every move in the game can be transitioned into every other move.\" For example, a Side Kick to the stomach shares the same transitional as a Push Kick to the face. Users can interrupt one with another from the second frame. \"If it looks like a front kick, but hits like a round kick, then you get a point. That's the way to win.\" FEATURE Another advantage of these transitional positions is the possibility of withdrawing altogether, and switching to something completely different. In order to achieve this, Derek and his team chose not to motion capture the routines, and instead relied on their combined know edge to painstakingly plot all the key positions for all characters. These pictures show how the characters get visibly injured during the fights. "


"computer video games CHARACTER ASSOCIATION KARAMBI S 47-Tek recognise how important it is to invent characters which players will care about. Street Fighter, Tekken, and Virtua Fighter all feature per sonalities that we can identify with or respect. That's why Derek and his team intend the Kumite challengers to boast a similar charismatic appeal. While at 47-Tek Paul was introduced to the two lead male characters. TNI PlayStation Created to be the bad guy of the tournament. Also 47-Tek used Karambi to demo the weapons element of Kumite. This character derives his name from his chosen tool of destruction: \"Tiger's Claw\", aka the Karambit. This is a sharp hook which protrudes from between the user's fingers, and is used to tear or drag opponents painfully around. At last year's Kumite, Karambi emerged from the Sumatran wilderness of Indonesia to become the champion. SATURN As you can see, Marshall is very proud of his Native American heritage. At the time of entering the tournament, this ex-Navy SEAL is working for the CIA as an undercover agent, busting drug barons and the like. «Of course the Mohawk's not regulation. But they make allowance for him because he's such a badass!\", explained Derek. KONAMI. . This mysterious character's origins are all explained as rumours, one of which tells of his being raised by hunting cats in the jungle before being taken under the wing of a legendary Penjat Silat Pandekar (Master). The rumour continues with Karambi having his lessons based around the natur al grace of a tiger in the hunt. The result: \"a perfect warrior, with the ferocity of a Bengal... tempered by years of Martial discipline. Marshall's distinctive fighting style owes everything to time spent with the best Capoeiria Maestre in Rio De Janeiro this after being inspired by watching his captors practice after being imprisoned in a South American hideout. He escaped during a raid. Marshall's technique is coloured by his early training in the art of Savate, which his father had learned from a French foot soldier in WWII. To guarantee his chances of retaining his title, the six feet five inches tall, 250 lbs warrior has studied other Martial disciplines among them the softer Kung Fu styles such as Hop Gar, and Tai Chi Chuan. He has adopted elements of each for his own repertoire, but the intention is that nobody can surprise him! KONAMI R&D SPECIAL FEATURE Rated alongside the other competitors, Marshall is noticeably the most balanced character. He is good at close-quarters exchanges, and his acrobatic skill is second only to the female character Lu. HEY-YA-YAHEY-YA-HUH! DOPPELGANGERS!Here's Marshall demonstrating his high kicks. FEATURE "

But the wholesome family entertainment values of a great baseball game couldn't be further away from KCEC's next offering. PROJECTS OVERKILL FEATURE That was originally planned to be the 32-bit incarnation of Contra (The Maelstrom Wars) soon began to take on a diabolical life of its own. Instead of a two-player action game for boys, Project Overkill is now a bloodthirsty, one-player psychothon, guaranteed to earn itself an MA rating on release. E "


"computer video games AT WAR WITH THE GALAXY! Given a few more centuries, mankind is sure to find itself stepping on tentacles as well as other peoples' toes. Meaning it is more than likely that a planet not unlike the fictitious Viscera 5 will turn its armies against us. The way Konami's Overkill team see it, earth will be battling the Viscerans for domination on a galactic scale. But ultimate victory requires cold strategy. Which is where the four player-controlled characters enter the picture a 21st Century SWAT team under no restrictions. PlayStation Their mission: to cleanse the known universe! SEGA SATURN ALTHEA TIMMERON EXPLOSIVES EXPERT Players adopt a tactical approach with this female 'Transhuman' character. She's quite weak. JENDRYK ESPION ASSASSIN Begins the game armed with a knife, useful for slitting Viscerian gizzards. Stealth is his forté. KONAMI LANSLOW KREEG ARMSMAN The most evenly balanced character in the game. His weapons power-ups are the best of all. QUOGG S'SENTHINON INFANTRY He's slow but weaker enemies are foolish to catch him up Quogg is powerful beyond belief! POWER CULTURE Ultimate success requires players to complete the game with all four characters in one piece. Each time you elect a merc to head into action it's a win or lose situation: Win, and they emerge with an amazing compliment of weapons upgrades. Lose, and your team has lost a valuable member. Given the tactical element to the game, some characters are better than others for specific missions. So it's worthwhile ensuring that nobody goes down.

GAME OF DEATH Project Overkill gains most of its aesthetic appeal from the graphic violence it contains. Graphic violence, and blood. Even when the ammo is completely spent, the mercs can slam enemies on the back of the neck with the butt of their gun. Or sneak up behind to stab them in the back. Crack someone over the head enough times, and their skull pops open. Blast a gook in the abdomen, and witness the fountain of blood shower from the gaping hole. Most disturbing of all, any bloodshed which takes place in an enclosed area is likely to paint the walls red.

Each weapon is tailored to fit the four characters' needs who they are dictates the kind of power-ups they receive. In addition to that, Overkill runs an interesting line in explosive devices.

But KCEC have someone who they describe as a \"Saturn Guru» planning the Sega version. Saturn should have no trouble handling the speed, but we look forward to seeing those transparencies work so well.

If you're planning staying at home, here's a list of some other stuff you might be interested in. What a month! The month's events and software releases at a glance. July-August . TOKYO GAME SHOW efore we begin, there's good news from T.H.E. Games, regarding the UK Super NES market this year: To quote their communications manager, Alex Fitzgibbons, directly: \"I can assure you that T.H.E. has HUGE balls, and will be bringing DK3 to the UK\". So that's great news for all Nintendo 16-bit fans. Virgin are another company to have come up trumps (finally) with Resident Evil on PlayStation, and Night Warriors for Saturn. Finally the PC CD-ROM market is blessed with Geoff Grammond's F1 GP2 masterpiece. So there you have it a lot of what we've been wanting to hear for almost six months in some cases. And summer's usually such a quiet time of year... As always this games listing is representative of every thing released during the time we're on sale. The stuff we've seen and loved is highlighted in red. The stuff we've run away from is ruled out in blue. TOKYO \"BIGSIGHT\" (INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION CENTRE) 22-24 AUGUST 1996 What looks set to be the biggest computer entertainment software show of the year takes place in Tokyo, Japan this month. Dubbed the Tokyo Game Show, this is purely for the benefit of the general public ie games players eager to try their hand at the latest software. And what a choice they're going to have! Two of the main sponsors are Imagineer, and Konami. Also very much in high profile are Sony, Sega, Namco, Capcom, Enix, Square, and Taito.

Here's what... BE MAF SHIELD DER NORMAL LE3 0.4TCH DE MESS.GE 1 The robotic spiders explode in a shower of legs. FADE TO BLACK elphine Software have got an excellent reputation. They are responsible for some of the most engrossing adventure games around, as well as being well-known for their excellent animation techniques. Prime examples of these are Another World and Flashback, both of which were particularly impressive when they were released and still are today. Flashback is still one of the best-looking platform games, has an ingenious control system, a fantastic plot, and an atmosphere not found in many video games it's a classic. Fade to Black is the sequel Flashback 2 in 3D... Dan SPIELP USED EXPLODE UEC WATCH ise MESSAGE 2 The introduction sequence shows what happens to Conrad B Hart after he defeated the Morphs at the end of Flashback. He floats in his small ship, in a deep sleep, only to be awakened when he's captured by a giant Morph mothership, whose Occupants immediately lock him up in New Alcatraz Pennitentary. When in his cell, a message comes through from John 'O Connor, a stranger to Conrad, who offers help... but why? FADE TO BLACK I HAF BIN EXPECTINK YOU! During level 2, Conrad, John and Sarah work together to rescue Professor Bergstein from a Morph prison cell. Once Conrad finds him, the Prof needs to be lead to the teleporter to the next section, but this isn't as basic as it sounds. Seeing as the the Professor is getting on a bit, Conrad has to walk REALLY slowly to help the old man on his way. Impatient players who want to run on ahead will be driven mad by this section, as the Prof gives them a telling off whenever he gets left behind! GLM. Here's the FMV professor... DER norms s LEE WATCH S This bit's worth looking out for. In one of the bases, there's a bank of computer screens and each one's playing an ancient video game! There's Pac Man, Space Invaders and Block Out, but unfortunately they can't be played. Darn. SHIELD AWESOME RENDERS!  The excellent intro sequence isn't the only bit of rendered FMV in the game, there are lots of sequences during and between levels to keep the plot going. They are all of a really high quality, and make finishing a level even more worthwhile. Also, we can tell you now that this is a game with an end sequence worth playing for, unlike most these days.

Don't tread there! TAKE TO THE SKIES! To add variety to the game, it's not all just walking around shooting this section, for example, involves Conrad stealing a ship and piloting around the inside of the base. The controls are quite tricky as the inertia of the ship takes a lot of getting used to, meaning that it's easy to collide with the walls and bridges to begin with. Oh dear, too late. Yuck!

COMMENT The best thing about Flashback was that Conrad could be controlled very accurately, with a bit of practice. In Fade to Black, he is controlled quite similarly with all sorts of attacks and movements available. CROUCH RELOAD SONY L2/R2 Initially I found Fade to Black frustrating. As with Flashback, there are very exacting objectives to be met, where just one foot wrong in a situation often means repeating a long series of set pieces again. In fact on the whole the control feels very heavy, and the 'camera' viewpoints zoom in and out in a very confusing manner. However, patience has its rewards and it's easy to appreciate how Fade To Black was considered a state-of-the-art PC title this time last year. Fresh challenges are met with every stage, and the learning process is graded perfectly. Though you may struggle to even aim the gun early on, later you will be ducking and shooting like a pro. Investigate immediately! PAUL VANIES SIDE STEP SEL SHOOT FADE TO BLACK ITEMS RUN JUMP REVIEWER E non SHIELD a noRS MB UUTCH MESSAGE HT K M MESSAGE 1 Do you trust this cook? He claims to be innocent but... When shot, he turns out to be an evil Morph soldier! In my opinion, Flashback is one of the best games ever. Fade to Black has a very similar feel to it, as the intro kicks off the movie-like plot and Conrad is immediately as versatile. The 3D graphics are very impressive good animation and scenery, but the frame rate occasionally gets a bit slow never enough to affect the gameplay, mind. The game becomes very atmospheric very quickly, as you interact with other characters, working with them to complete your objectives. The control of Conrad is great, with him being able to do almost everything you want him to, making it feel even more like Flashback. The game involves more exploration and shooting than Flashback, which requires more well-timed jumps, but Fade to Black still feels similar. The levels are really varied, meaning that you're going to want to play right the way through, and that's going to take a fair while. Fade to Black is a worthy sequel to Flashback which, while not being quite as good as the original, continues the story brilliantly. OD LOMAS Death says: Bash him on the head... harder! Death says: Release radiation on him. NOW! There's a friendly soldier! Go and have a chat with him... REVIEW No... burn him! Haha! RATING An excellent action adventure game which has a real movie-like atmosphere and enough in it to keep you playing to the end. Eeek! It's a horrible Morph, disguised as a human! Kill it! No, no... electrocute him. Yes, that's funny! "

ACTUA GOLF remlin's Actua Sports series is a success already. There may only be Actua Soccer and Actua Golf now available, but before long we expect Actua Tennis and hopefully Actua Cricket as well. This game is similar to Actua Soccer, as the players are all motion-captured models, the scenery is all 3D, and there are loads of camera angles, and it's likely to have a similar amount of success. The game has been delayed for quite a while, as a new Peter Alliss commentary and new golfer models and animation have been added to make it one of the most realisticlooking golf games ever.

The button is pressed once to start the power bar moving up the arc, pressed again to set the power, and again as the bar gets to the bottom, setting the way the ball is hit. Pn 137 yds Driver Shot-1 Straight PRESENTED BY. PETER ALLISSI Before teeing off, players can walk around the entire hole to plan their shots. It's also possible to move the view high into the air to get a clear look. One of the reasons for Actua Golf to have been delayed for so long is that a new commentary was being added. And it's not just an actor it's Peter Alliss! During the game, he comes out with excellent criticism, as well as giving a detailed guide to every hole on each course! He adds a lot to the atmosphere of the game, as do Murray Walker in F1 and Barry Davies in Euro '96. HMMM..

At the start of each hole, the players bend down to set up their tee shot, and always collect the ball from the hole at the end. When players do particularly badly, the character will shake his head or swipe his club in frustration. REVIEWER TWO BIG FIELDS There are two courses available in Actua Golf River Valley and Royal Glen. Gremlin are also planning to release course disks in the future, each containing a famous course or two, and they should be nice and cheap as they only need to contain the course data and hole fly-by commentary. I saw an early version of Actua Golf last summer, and it looked brilliant back then it's hard to see where the extra year's work has gone. It plays very much like EA's excellent PGA Tour series (probably the best golf games available) only it looks even better. The 3D graphics make the courses look very realistic, and the sounds help a lot as well (trickling water, wind, sea noises). The new Peter Alliss commentary is also brilliant lots of phrases, very detailed hole descriptions, and some funny one-liners! Two courses isn't really a lot, but hopefully the new upgrades will be available soon, and they should be fairly cheap. The putting is the only part that can be a bit annoying, as even three-inch putts need to be hit almost perfectly to get them down the hole. Other than this, the very slow loading times and overall pace of the game may frustrate some people, but that's all part of golf, isn't it? Actua Golf is the best of its kind on the PS, and a very impressive game indeed. \"ED LOMAS REVIEW RATING RATING 914 The best PlayStation golf game available, and a particularly pleasant experience, even for those who aren't dads yet. Both courses look absolutely fantastic! 59 "

Wrestle Mania is a light-hearted alternative to the likes of Virtua Fighter 2, Mortal Kombat, and most other hardcore technique competitions. All sound effects are brilliant; from the noise of necks cracking under the strain of awesome piledrivers, to the bone-crunching sound of the Undertaker's fabled Tombstone Smash. Eight distinct fighters boasting around ten moves each, plus specials, assures the longevity of the game. And every last one of those moves is sure to make you cringe as these giants are thrown around the ring like rag dolls. Wrestlemania is an ace conversion of a cool arcade game, and I am sure that all fighting game addicts would gladly add this to their collection. PHZL DAW Solla DOINK LEX LUGER Wrestlemania includes some of the wackiest moves ever seen in a game of this genre, but unlike many other fighting games the 'Specials' are incredibly easy to do. While this gives the game an easier access point for those players who aren't so skilled, there's still a lot of scope for pros to build on their potential. While activating some of these moves the word \"High Risk frequently appears on-screen, indicating that a risky manoeuvre has been activated. If you're not quick enough the opponent will pull a reversal move and slam you head first on to the mat!

"computer Video games EXPLORATION BY ARTDINK  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  JAPANESE VERSION AVAILABLE  STORAGE 1 CD  PRICE TBA  PUBLISHED BY SONY TEL: 0171 447 1600 omnino TM JUNE RELEASE 1 PLAYER PlayStation PlayStation Imagine a massive ocean, created in 3D, populated by all sorts of amazing 3D life. Now imagine getting in a sub and exploring the ocean by yourself. Just relax... A well-build reef will attract loads of species of fish. AQUANAUT'S HOLIDAY OUTO quanaut's Holiday was released in Japan over a year ago, but didn't get much coverage as no one could understand what was going on, and noone expected it to ever get a UK release. It can't really be described as a game, as there's not really any objective other than to attract fish to your reef and explore the ocean. Instead, it's more of a stressrelief tool, and a very strange idea indeed. Three whales at once not a very common sight at all! AQUANAUT'S HOLIDAY BUILD REEF HEY, WHAT DOO I DO MAN? EXIT Aquanaut's Holiday is a very difficult \"game\" to explain. It's best described as a «stress-relief exploration\" game, as it isn't like anything else available. Most of the time, players just pilot their submarine around the absolutely MASSIVE playing ocean, simply exploring. By piloting the ship around (a bit like Magic Carpet) players not only discover loads of species of ocean creatures and strange underwater structures, they also uncover segments of the map. Returning to base, players can add to their reef by placing coloured blocks in a grid. They can be put anywhere, so it's possible to build strange shapes. As the reef grows, more fish are attracted to it. A bar on the map screen fills as you get more fish, and the \"game\" is finished once it reaches the top. TALK TO THE ANIMALS o DULTO Your sub is equipped with four different sonars, which can be used to communicate with some of the life you come across. Some creatures can be frightened away, others can be made to dance for you. REVIEW By using one of the sonars on this Octopus, you can make its head inflate! If you want to add to the \"I'm in a submarine\" feeling, you can change the screen options so that you view the game from an oval window, rather than it filling the whole screen. These giant sea snails can be made to spin upside down really quickly! The clams open when sung to. @ "


"computer video games LOOK OUT FOR THESE! AQUANAUT'S AQUARIUM By exploring the ocean, you'll discover that there are loads of major landmarks. Here are just a few of them: There are absolutely LOADS of different species of sea creatures in Aquanaut's Holiday, far too many for us to list here. Part of the novelty of the game» is that it's always interesting to discover something you've not seen before. Some of the rarer creatures are the pink shark and the giant white whale. PlayStation 1 Loads of pillars from a temple. 1 The Great Wall of China! AQUANAUT'S HOLIDAY HEADING ABOUT MAP REVIEWER The playing area in Aquanaut's Holiday is absolutely huge, meaning that a map is necessary. It only lights up areas already explored, but makes planning routes possible. POINT VIEW 1 A massive ornamental palace. EXIT 1 A big balancing rock. 1 Massive turnips! This is a very weird game indeed. It would be easy to say that it's rubbish and boring as nothing ever happens, but for something to keep me playing nonstop for nearly five hours at a time, it must have some plus points. It's got a strange addictiveness there's no \"just one more go\" feeling, it just seems necessary to keep playing! The graphics, music and sound can relax you almost into a trance, which means that the \"stress-relief\" part works really well. The game part of building a reef to attract fish doesn't seem particularly important when you've got exploring to do, and as there's not way of failing at the game, it'll be completed within 6 hours of play something that could easily be done in one day. Also, the graphics can be slightly rough, as the cliffs and floor appear very close to the ship, rather than appearing smoothly from the murky water. Overall, it's something that can't really be highly recommended to everyone, but will get many people totally hooked. Just think are you the sort of person that could spend hour upon hour doing pretty much nothing? I am, therefore I can and I love it. \"6D LOMAS These buoys can be dropped at any time to mark important areas. Players can view them on the map and warp to them whenever they want. 1 A derelict aqueduct. 1 Giant stone head. AVTO REVIEW RATING RATING A very strange experience which can take top hours of your life, and leave you totally relaxed at the end of it. 1 An enormous fish beast! Aaaah! Time to return to real life. 65 "

ONSID Just two buttons are used to create what is hoped will be footy magic. The main action button is tapped for general hoofing about or held down if you intend to pass the ball, in which case a direction arrow appears beneath the player's feet. For more speed, or to chip the ball, the other button is used. And that's it. Note the real advertisements.

That would be awesome! And that's exactly the hook we suspect Telstar adopted when planning their Onside game, reviewed right here.

Knockout, in which as many teams as you like are entered into random playoffs. Then League, where there's an option to design your own, alongside competing inside of any of the four prominent European ones. There's a five-a-side option for all of the above, and in all cases the player names are authentic. Don't be mislead, the management option is far from being as masterful as the best on the market, but is still more substantial than being just another option. Onside isn't the first to try this idea Sensible World of Soccer has been doing an amazing job of this for around two years. In the case of Onside you have nine main options, which include Finance along with Training, and the chance to participate in a crucial game if you feel your skills are needed. Just like SWOS. There are far too many footy games around at the moment, which makes judging one against the other very difficult. Unfortunately, Onside doesn't confuse, matters too much as it is clearly below form. In case you care to read any more on the subject, here's why: Most importantly the game control is basic beyond belief. Players expect much more than pass, shoot, and after touch. And even these simple requirements are awkward to achieve. Aside from that the visuals are shoddy as the Lego man taking the penalty kick ably demonstrates. Or is this a bonus game where you have to squint in order to guess the celebrity? Presentation is good, with an extensive array of options, plus it's easy to find your way around. However, Sensible World of Soccer kills Onside for value and gameplay, and you can see for yourself how much better Gremlin's Euro '96 fares by comparison.

You could well be the next Olympic champion... ur thumbs are still blistered and weeping from the last month's orgy of joypad abuse, brought on by the re-emergence of Track And Field. However, there's no time to heal our festering digits, because the summer sports fiesta isn't over. The Atlanta '96 Olympic Games has brought with it a licensed game of its own. A fifteen-event extravaganza ladened with yet more button-bashing madness. However, this isn't just a lame copycat of TnF. Nope, Olympic Games is from US Gold, whose near-annual sports packages date back as far as the superb Winter Olympics on Commodore 64 (although it was joystick waggling in those days). And Ed Lomas' famous Olympic Gold technique (see last issue) was discovered through continual play of US Gold's Megadrive Atlanta 1996 game of the same name. So does their first 32-bit Olympic license match up to the past greats? Atlanta 1996 I=8 OLYMPIC GAMES IESTE OLYMPIC GAMES Olympic Games' clearest selling point over Konami's Track and Field (apart from the official license) has to be the sheer wealth of events. Fifteen in total, ranging beyond mere track and field, to swimming, shooting, weightlifting and fencing. And with only four pages to cover them all, we'd better get right on the case. 2UP JALE Rapid tapping is needed for the runup, however there's now a new action bar to contend with. During the approach, an indicator moves up this bar. You need to stop this exactly on the red mark in the middle, keeping the button held down to increase the angle of the throw. Fail to get this right and your spearthrower either runs past the line or spoons his throw! 20 2UP The cornerstone of every Olympic video game. Exactly the same as in Track and Field, with frenzied (but rhythmic) tapping of the two run buttons charging up your power bar and pushing your on-screen sprinter faster. JUP ook 1UP REVIEW Swing around too much and you end up on your backside, with a feeble throw to your name. Hahahahahaha! Although this throwing event starts from a stationary spin, the technique is much the same as with the discus. Rapid-tapping increases the power of the spin, and correct direction and angle are decided by precision control of the Action Bar. 30 Hainmer /11 HEN 68 It's like Planet Of The Hamsters or something. 2 A9 Try it before SEGA SATURN PlayStation Rent any latest release from just "


"computer video games 2UP 100M CRAWL RAPID PREPISTOL Stamina bar time (see 400M)! Two lengths of the pool require you to pace your tapping. Keeping your speed up without losing stamina is tricky. In fact, hardly tapping at all before the final sprint, seems the best method. There's a 70's Dirty Harry feel to this event. You have to shoot the centre of each target in a limited time. Each round, it gets harder as the time-limit per target gets shorter. With six rounds in which to increase your total score, this is a particularly good multi-player challenge. Rapid Fre Pistol i second teen PlayStation 2UP FEA It's like classic Duck Hunt, sort of. Moving around a shooting arena, you have to hit 25 'clay pigeons', but you only get 25 shots, which come in double-barrelled portions. The judge calls 'PULL' just before each pigeon is launched. Which has driven Paul mad, as he keeps looking up saying «Yes, what do want?\" Atlanta 199 po **&=1 OLYMPIC GAMES Hamsters in trunks hit the water! Thankfully, this event doesn't use that old Heimdall shaky hands technique to increase the challenge. It does, however, make things trickier with added 'wind factor'. You have to judge how far out to aim, to compensate for any turbulence. It's actually quite tricky. Tapping the buttons in amusing rhythms keeps your minding from wandering. WEIGH FUFTIN It might look like a one-on-one beat 'em up, but this is more of a reflex test. Dodging left and right. you need to get a swipe in. Various Dpad commands perform different lunges, but the best move is the 'reposte'. Wait until your opponent attacks and dodge, following through with a swipe. Possibly the best event of the game, although it's very tough. Technique is broken into three sections... First you lift the weight to your athlete's chin. As you tap the power bar, a jerk bar' increases beside it. You need to stop this at exactly the same height to succeed. The technique required here is some what different from that of the 100 metres dash. Under the power meter is another bar that represents your athlete's stamina. You can rap away at the buttons straight from the onset if you wish, but this decreases the sta mina bar, and soon your runner slows down exhausted. The only method is to tap the buttons slowly, preserving enough energy for the final push. IUP ZUP REVIEW NO Now you need to repeat this technique to raise the weight above the athlete's head. The judges have to deem the lift a success. If the athlete starts to stagger, you need to tap left and right to balance him!

"computer Video games IUP GBB  Planting the pole accurately, adds to the difficulty of this event. As your athlete runs towards the jump area, a marker descends on the meter next to your Power Bar. You need to stop this exactly in the middle to accurately place the pole. Now, as you launch upwards, you need to stop the marker accurately again, to power your spring. An easy event at regular heights, but it's hard to break any records. Identical technique to that of the Hammer. However, your athlete performs less spins, giving you less time to build up power. The throwing angle should also be higher. PlayStation 1UP 2UP FRA UCN Atlanta 1996 Much more complex than the Long Jump. When you get to the jumpline, hit the action button to activate the first hop. An indicator now moves along the action bar, which has to be stopped exactly on the red mark twice more, to correctly perform the skip and jump. 12UP 28 SIWVI DIWATO Ha, the Bionic Hamster can easily overcome such pathetic heights. 2UP Plenty of sprinting needed here, before hitting the action button at the precise moment to get an accurate jump at the line. Timing a good angle is also vital to get a good distance. 2UP Muchos tapping applied here for optimum results. 2UP ZUP 39 2UP 2UP Ooh, a little bit early, but not so bad! Watch that green indicator on the lower bar. Stop it correctly. MEISTE OS COLD Introducing an all-new meter the Jump Bar! As usual, rapidtapping is needed to power up the speed bar.

"computer video games OLYMPIC US GOLD COMMENT START SAVE SKIP GANE If you've read our Olympic Soccer review (page 72, cuggies), you'll know that Alan Green from Radio 5 Live was employed to do the commentary. Well, in what seems to be a package deal, he's also done sound duties on Olympic Games too. Being a football commentator though, this isn't exactly his forté, and it shows. Perhaps his best line is \"You'll notice the weighlifters have to wear a strange one-piece leotard. Goodness knows why!\" What a fact, eh? FENCING The option screen is a challenge. PlayStation STANDINGS US GOLD Olympic Games has got an excellent selection of events, some of which are particularly good fun. As Tom says below, the pick of the bunch are the non-Track and Field events shooting, archery, weight lifting, fencing as they break up the constant running and throwing. The graphics are the same as Olympic Soccer (see next page) the characters are a bit pointy and plain, but look fine enough from a distance. The Alan Green commentary doesn't work anywhere near as well here as in US Gold's footy game, as he only occasionally speaks and what he says is usually stupid anyway! The wide selection and variety of events, as well as the official licence, will appeal to some people more than Konami's Track and Field mostly fans of the Olympics; but TnF is likely to be the sort of thing more average gamers are after a simple, fun button-bash. What you need to do is work out what sort of player you are, and get the game that suits you. ED LOMAS O SCOTO Player S 2UP 23 10P 1 1 2 og To finish, the flames go out... It's during the four-player tournaments that Track and Field is at its most brilliant. Well, Olympic Games goes four better, with a massive eight-player link-up. Yep, if you've got two multi-taps you can enjoy nearparty sized tournaments. Especially nail-biting during the 100m dash. Those little spinning sweets are supposed to be your medals. Atlanta 199 REVIEWER **2&=OLYMPIC GAMES ...and fireworks kick in. Yaay! NOW TRY YMPICM Uncoordinated button-tapping might be good enough for your average joypad joe, but for herculean D-pad daddios, Olympic Mode is the only option. This expert control method puts an extra marker on your power bar. As well as bashing the buttons really fast, you now have to maintain a really tight rhythm to keep the marker centred. If it swings too far to one side, you lose speed. Okay, I'll answer the most important question straight off Olympic Games isn't as good as Track and Field. But that's not to say it's at all bad either. AS intended, the game's biggest selling point is its wide range of events, although not for the reasons you'd think. It's not the variety that's impressive to be honest, most of the events play so similarly it's the fact that the events not featured in TnF are really quite smart. The two shooting events, weight-lifting and fencing are all wellthought out and highly enjoyable. It's the regular events that aren't so good. What made Track and Field fun was the way the control system made you feel you really were doing the events ie. holding down the jump button and releasing to flip over the bar. Here the controls sometimes don't make sense. Why do you have to stop a jump bar at the same height as your power bar? How does that relate? Likewise with swimming. Where's the tension in barely tapping the buttons to pace your stamina? Furious tapping throughout the gruelling distance would give a far more realistic sense of fatigue in your own arms! The graphics too, are patchy, and the commentary is plain annoying. It's a coupling of all these things that put Olympic Games second to TnF. 375 CREVED Don't let the marker hit those green edges, or you'll slow down. TOM GUISE RATING An enjoyable multi-sports game, but poor presentation and non-instinctive controls stop it from being truly outstanding. 71 you buy it.

BALL CONTROL OLYMPIC SOCCER Olympic Soccer gives the player a large amount of control over what happens on the pitch. So much so, that with practice, the little men can be made to do just about anything possible in a real match. Almost. It's strange that it's not normally possible to chest the ball in football games, but that's not the case in Olympic Soccer. When a ball is coming in at chest height, pressing the Square button will chest the ball, and it can be aimed to drop the ball into the path of another player! Like Euro '96, Olympic Soccer has got a button which will perform an automatic cross from the wing. REVIEW Headers and Bicycle kicks are normally moves pulled off by accident in football games, when someone presses \"shoot\" while a player is in the air, but in Olympic Soccer, they've each got their own specific button, meaning that they can be pulled off at any time. Volleys are easy in Olympic Soccer just press one button when the ball is at the right height and the player will attempt a powerful strike in the direction he's facing. The chest and volley moves can be combined so that a player receives a ball, chests it into the air, turns, and volleys it at the goal! 29 Try it before SEGA SATURN PlayStation Rent any latest release from just "

They'll be missing out on something special though, as OS is one of the most playable football games around! It's incredibly fast for a start, but never so fast that it's not possible to control the players. In fact, the players are some of the most controllable in a footy game being able to perform loads of moves which can be combined to create new tactics. The computer opponents are very hard to beat to begin with, as they perform flowing passing movements and set up excellent goals while you're still playing the long ball tactics required to win in almost every other football game! After some practice and when a few of the tricks have been mastered, it becomes a lot fairer. The commentary, as with all others, gets a little bit repetitive after a while, but it's still very good. All you need to do is play the game once and you'll see how good it is straight away. It's the best PlayStation football game, in my opinion. 69 LOMAS The arrow under the player points to the goal they should be aiming for. Good, and that's OFFICIAL!

The licence also means that the real soccer grounds to be used in the Atlanta Olympics Atlanta 1996 are in the game, as well as the proper Olympic soccer tournament rules.

An average day for a 3037 AD citizen of earth. It's real-time 360° action all the way in your Predator Starfighter. 4200 STARFIGHTER 3000 ne of the most impressive titles on 3DO is Starfighter 3000. Mainly because, for a machine whose sell-by date looms dangerously close, it puts out some seriously impressive real-time 3D routines. Now this widely acclaimed graphical tour de force is being offered to the PC, Saturn and PlayStation masses, the question raised is how significant can a high-end 3D0 product be to an audience who expect complex 3D as a minimum requirement. Pilots may target anything they choose and blow it all to pieces (of parsnip). STARFIGHTER UNIVERSE 93150 4 Mission Target 46550 Mission Target D Action takes place within a limited area, but a Starfighter's options within those confines are massively extensive. Pilots are given free reign to demolish everything ground or air based, excepting, of course, the mother ship which must be protected at all costs. STARFIGHTER 3000 38550 Fly into outerspace for battle! sc star e INTRO 4F LOCKTAR SPACE HOT ROD 67625 24 SC FREE SHIP: Your ship is a Federation planetary assault vehicle, named Predator Mark-IV. The control method is simple, with all directionals handled by the thumb pad, and only one button to fire whichever weapon is selected. Speed remains constant if nothing is pressed, but afterburners increase thrust should you need it. The Predator is enhanced with ECM (Emergency CounterMeasures) as standard, though this missile deterring mechanism is limited to number of uses. ATG Missiles lock-on to buildings, and display a green matrix to highlight the target. 1050 39000 REVIEW The on-board computer 'talks' to the Mother Ship, which relays information for display on the strategic map. From here pilots may lock-on to most targets, and track them through a direction arrow. 36450 KSH LIST Predator's powerful lasers not only scorch the earth, but are so intense they remold the landscape, in a process known as Terraforming. Just like you hear about in the movie Aliens So long as you're vaguely on target the docking computers handle the rest for you. "


"HEAVEN SENT computer games CRYSTAL CASTLES Fellow Feds on the Mothership occasionally deem it necessary to help by parachuting supplies to the war zone. Snatch these before they fall, and the Predator receives an immediate upgrade. Each time something is destroyed, at least one strange crystal-like artifact is left behind. These come in a variety of colours. By collecting them in a certain order, the Predator's matter-energy converter boosts the performance of the ship in some way. For example two 'blues increase the number of Air to Ground missiles available; red with yellow tightens ship control; reds combined amplify laser power, and so it goes. It's down to pilots to memorise different combinations, as the on-board computer doesn't store this information. 40625 PlayStation Wing Pods add more firepower and more speed to the Predator. Usually they come in pairs, but solo pods are common too. They're fragile though, so don't expect to hang onto them if reckless flying's your game. TARGE 4475 114775 Megaship is a power-up reserved only for parachute drops. As the name suggests, this maxes out everything for a limited time ultimate control, speed, and armament. Trash everything to exhume as many crystal power-ups as possible! FORMATION FLYING 40525 Parachute Drop Detected REVIEWER Later missions involve commanding a small squadron of Federation fighters. Pilots may dictate which formation is best in a situation, and may choose to adapt at any time. Another tactic involving team members is using the Mother Ship as cover. If the action gets to hot in the skies, move in close and she'll blast a few enemy fighters from the sky with her powerful cannons. STARFIGHTER 3000 Act upon this message quickly... Formation Control 40625 NORMAL RECROUP ATTACK ALL ATTACK dAdded Deve PILOT-2 Technically Starfighter 3000 is an impressive piece of software, and there are many clever aspects that a strictly pragmatic reviewer could point out to its favour. The use of artificial intelligence; multiple camera angles; volatile landscapes. However examining programmers' potential is not we're here for, and there are many more reasons why Starfighter ultimately fails as a game. First of all it lacks style. The least constructive comment I could offer is that it looks like a great Jaguar game, but the best way to put it is that the landscapes, buildings, and craft don't look ready to have left the drawing board. StarWing on the Super NES has more chic. The ship is a dog to control too sluggish and heavy, which doesn't help in a tight situation. Explosions are great for a time, but when it comes to immersing yourself in the game all that exists is extensive target practice under increasing duress. Any ingenuity is swamped by a lack of speed; foggy objectives, and little variation. I am sure that if the programmers worked on the look, and graded the flow of the missions better, they may have created something immediately more appealing with Starfighter. But, to my mind, there's just no fun in repetitiously demolishing polygon constructs to the tune of dire techno. PAUL DAVIES Farochure Collec ed ...and you could end up with this.

"computer Video games RACING SIM BY GEOFF CRAMMOND EDIT MY RELEASE  PRICE TBA  PC AND AMIGA PREQUELS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE 1-2 PLAYERS PLAYERS  PUBLISHED BY MICROPROSE TEL: 01454 326532 Canon JULY RELEASE ROM Geoff Crammond is known by almost every ROM single video gamer as one of the best programmers in the world. Here's what he's O been doing for the last few years: GRAND PRIA GIVE IT THE ONCE OVER, MATE! eoff Crammond's first Grand Prix game has become a legend. This sequel is pretty much as well-known already, as it's been in development for years the original release date was about a year ago! This version is based on the 1994 season and features all the drivers from that year, except Roland Ratzenburger and Ayrton Senna, obviously. But the major difference is the excellent new graphics engine, enabling fantastic Super VGA graphics with light sourcing and shading to make the tracks and cars look incredibly realistic. With the car in the garage, it's possible to configure absolutely everything so that it suits your needs for the next track perfectly. Players can change the gear ratios, wing angles, fuel levels, brake balance, pit strategy, and more! All the settings can be saved, ready to be reloaded at another time. LIGHT-SOURCED BEAUTY HONDA Mobil GRAND PRIX The car models in GP2 look absolutely fantastic, partly because they are light sourced. As they drive past, the light moves around the surface of the car, making everything look totally solid. From the close-up view of the driver it's possible to see the light reflecting off the helmet visor! WATCHING TV AIRBAG AS STANDARD As with the first Grand Prix game, there are absolutely LOADS of views available! That's something we say a lot about games these days, but GP2 is just plain excessive! The main view is from inside the car which gives the best impression of speed but there are also views from each wheel, behind the car, looking out the back, straight at the driver, following behind, from the real BBC TV camera positions, spinning around the car and that's not the lot! There are only two that are really worth using while playing, but a wide selection is nice when watching replays. There's also a special \"TV Director\" mode which can be used to view the action, either when you've crashed out or if you're watching a computer race. A virtual TV director will cut between the TV camera views and in-car shots to give the best view of the action! What an excellent idea! One of the major enhancements to the GP game engine is that the cars can now flip and roll over, creating far more realistic collisions. Getting close to other cars is very risky as touching wheels can send one car riding over and into the air! High-speed crashes are more spectacular, as cars are launched into the air, spinning and rolling a they go! Also, chunks of cars and their wheels fly off to make for some amazingly realistic replays!

"computer Video games REALISTIC DATA! WATERSOON FOSTERS  FOSTERS FOSIERS O FOSTERS Shellcashe For the real Formula 1 fanatic, GP2 is heaven. Not only has it got all the real drivers, teams, cars and tracks from the 1994 season, it's got more statistics than normal people can handle! During the game, it's possible to record all the data from your computerised car then look at the data in the form of graphs. These graphs can tell you how the suspension on each wheel moved, how fast the car went around the corners, the engine revs... everything! ROM Shell Shell SheilShell SEIKO She|SEIKO t 's Shell SherShell Shells IN THE HOTSEAT! It isn't necessary to have two PCs or a modem to play with more than one driver. As in the original game, there's a hotseat mode which has players taking it in turns to control their car, while the computer takes over the other player's. It's an interesting idea, and one that works fairly well, though it can be annoying to watch your friend driving well while your computer-controlled car drives into a wall! PRIORA REVIEWER GRAND PRIX 2 their POKER Just look at these incredible cars! The graphics are so good and the models are so realistic that these graphics are almost unbelievable! The game is awesomely detailed, too! This may no, it will) sound sad, but I used to play the original Grand Prix on the Amiga for 100% race distances that's up to 80 laps at a time! For a while, it was my favourite game on the planet, and I played it all the time. I, like many other PC owners, have been looking forward to this update for what seems like years, and I haven't been disappointed. It plays almost identically to the original game supposedly the most realistic F1 car handling around, lots of helpful driver aids for beginners, plenty of views, all the real tracks. replay modes, and all the strategic elements of real F1 driving but looks so much better than before. From the TV cameras in SVGA mode with all the detail turned on, it sometimes looks of photographic quality! The amount of work that's gone into the game is astounding the tracks are so detailed that it's possible to learn the real things from the game, and the car physics make the cars move exactly as you'd imagine them to. This is by far the most comprehensive and realistic driving sim available, anywhere, and is even great fun for those who can't be bothered to take it seriously. This comes very highly recommended to absolutely everyone with a decent Pentium PC. ED LOMAS REVIEW Oro Facing Jerem BEXDE Racing RATING The drivers lean their heads to the side as they go round corners! Also, all the suspension moves seperately from the car! This game is just too realistic! Definitely the most detailed and realistic racing simulation that a normal amount of money can buy. "


"computer video games 3D SHOOT 'EM UP PC 000 ROM SHELL SHOCK SEE ROM OUT NOW BY CORE DESIGN 1-8 PLAYERS he premise here is very simple: Pilot an M-13 tank, festooned with heavy-duty firepower, into battle against terrorists. Players start out as a rookie in a group calling themselves 'Da Wardnez', and are promoted according to performance in the field. Key targets ground or air-based show up on radar; and are hunted down, while taking out minor troublemakers. A neat touch is how terrain sometimes impedes the tank's performance, however the team leader's 'advice' is very annoying. In a multi-player situation, assuming the role of assassin feels cool as in any 3D shoot 'em up. Unfortunately this doesn't come close to the grandeur of Terranova, or match Duke Nukem for thrills.

But criticising this game's name is just being unfair, because there's far worse here to moan about. We reviewed the Saturn version of Virtual Golf back in our March issue, and were distinctly unimpressed by it. The PlayStation version is exactly the same. So, unsurprisingly, we're distinctly unimpressed by it. More so this time around. The problem with Virtua Golf is that it's just too basic. Although it employs a swing-o-meter similar to that of the PGA games, it lacks the depth or skill of the latter. The gameplay really amounts to pressing B twice, with no real thought required. On top of all this, the graphics only amount to reasonable, and the sound is, well bizarre is the kindest description. With Actua Golf in there's very issue, there's really no contest.

This isn't really acceptable when the Saturn's got Euro '96 already, with Olympic Soccer and Victory Goal 2 coming soon. There's really nothing at all in Striker that is better than any other football game, making it a totally pointless thing to get. In fact, it does just about everything far worse. Don't bother.

It plays differently, in that the player controls a squad of space marines rather than just one. This gives the game a strong strategy feel as marines are positioned and assigned tasks. The graphics are slightly smoother than the 3DO version's, but the game speed is the same slow. This is because you play as a marine in giant armour, admittedly, but it can get very tedious when you're trying to get to the other side of a stage and it takes ages. There are loads of impressive weapons, and it's always fun to blow the Genestealers up the wall, but the overall pace and feel of the game will only appeal to a minority of PlayStation owners.

The PC and PlayStation versions didn't make such an impact, as graphics of that quality come as standard in most games nowadays. However, Need for Speed has always been great fun, and the new Saturn version is just the same as the PlayStation version reviewed in issue 174. The only real difference is that the smoke from skidding tyres looks a bit rough. Otherwise, it looks just as good smooth and solid cars, with good-looking tracks. The crashes are the highlight, as the cars can roll and flip, so there are loads of homemade bonus games to play. Also, there are a bunch of tracks, hidden modes (and a car) which mean the game's going to last. Great fun, especially the crashes! ED LOMAS 1 TO 00:52.0 Lovely view, but keep your eyes on the road!

THE SECOND ZONE REVEALEDI The second zone, like the first, hasn't got a definite name yet, though it does look very similar to Sonic 2's Chemical Plant Zone. There are robotic mice and octopi to avoid, and high-speed chutes to whizz around. So far, neither of the two zones are totally complete, but the finished version will feature at least seven of them, each with two acts and a boss stage. Also, each act now takes longer to complete than the other Sonic games, and is broken up by having to collect the groups of Flickys, meaning that there are effectively twice as many stages! Sonic warps into the boss stage from the end of act 2, then destroys Robotnik! ROBOTNIK RETURNSI NEW GAMES RINGS 854 At the end of the Green Grove Zone, Dr Robotnik appears is one of his spaceships and tries to crush Sonic with a giant spiky ball.

"computer video games NEUTGAMES! TING IPERS URN We said it was coming. But how soon and how fast, we had no idea! The Fighting Vipers conversion machine is on the move!! THE FIGHTING VIPERS FORMAT: SATURN BY: AM2 DUE: OCTOBER (JAPAN) It was just after we went to press last month that the first pictures of Fighting Vipers arrived! What's incredible, is that in the month it's taken us to get them to you, more and more have surfaced. And on each occasion, astonishing developments have been made. Then it happened! At the Tokyo Toy Fair on the first week of June, a playable version of the game was revealed! What you see here is everything we've got, from the first shots to Toy Fair demo stills. It may look basic now, but in a few short months this game is going to be unbelievable! We've seen it happen before!! FIGHTING VIPERS 2006 Rockhard girl Jane, already looks to be in an advanced stage of development.  GRACE 30. Already, six of the nine vipers have been revealed! Notably, the only two main characters missing (the third is the boss, BM) are Plcky and Raxel, both characters that use weapons a skateboard and guitar respectively. At this early stage, the fighters still look quite basic. However, while increasing the level of detail, AM2 are taking a different approach to the character design than they did with VF2. \"If the Saturn version was identical to the arcade, on a home TV the effect would look a little messy.\" explains Hiroshi Kataoka, the man in charge of AM2's Saturn FV conversion. «Instead of trying to incorporate every single likeness, we'll use the detail effectively and not go overboard. Nobody will mind if Tokio's armour is a little different, but if the face isn't reproduced perfectly the players won't be happy.\" It's this factor that AM2 consider the most important. \"Arcade Vipers makes much more use of the Model 2 board than VF2, in so much as FV uses many more polygons for the face. At the moment we're working on adding this aspect into the game.\" continues Mr Kataoka. Other factors, such as character animation seem to be causing no problem. \"Both the women's bouncing breasts and Bahn's fluttering tailcoat will be accurately reproduced.\" The on-screen indicators are already in place! Is th a transparency effect? 20 ANMAN Remember, there's more detail under the armour, waiting to be uncovered. SANMAN Sanman. Left with his 7 armour already bust off. Below it's still on! 16, 16, LAC CALZEITS: S-WV9 MEN 162 39NON ALL ARTWORK  AM2-SEGA 1996. Kooargh! Now that's what we call collision detection! 47\" 56 TAGE 5 90 "


"POKOK computer Video games HONEY THE WALL! THE WALL! THE WALL! THE WALL! The single feature that makes FV unique among fighting games is 'The Wall'. Each ring is surrounded by an enclosure, which can be used to the fighters' advantage springing off, climbing up, or smashing opponents into it! The most impressive sight in the game, is to finish a contender by smacking them through the wall, right into the background scenery!! Clearly the wall or more importantly, the interaction with it was going to be the most difficult part of game to replicate. And after the lack of fencing around Wolf's arena on Saturn VF2, there were rumours the fence might not be included. \"Actually the walls are already finished!\" says Mr Kataoka. «It's still necessary to do a little more finishing work on them. It's not just the characters that have texture-mapping. The walls also have texture mapping by creating polygons and applying them to the surface. For example, Bahn's western stage wall will look much better when the textured surface is added. All the extra work of adding the texture-mapping has slowed down development and the completion deadline has had to be pushed back, so we won't be able to include the walls in time for the Tokyo Toy Fair.\" However, at the Toy Fair, the walls WERE included. Moreover, they were destructible too! It seems AM2 are well on schedule! SATU 43\" 92 AMAZING EFFECTS! THE WALLS ARE ALREADY IN THE GAME! If there was any one feature missing from Saturn VF2, it was light-sourcing. Not so with Fighting Vipers. Even the earliest shots demonstrate shadows on the characters' limbs, most effectively on uplit stages like Grace's. However, recent pictures have shown even more graphical advancements, including gourard shading! This technique smooths out rough edges caused by polygon shading, resulting in realistic curved 3D shapes! \"It's often said that the Saturn isn't able to handle the calculation management of lightsourcing for computer characters, and that if a lot of gourard shading is used, Saturn will grind to a halt.\" Laughs Mr Kataoka, \"we want to show everyone that Saturn can handle both of them perfectly.\" BAHN So far the walls are looking awesome. Can AM2 replicate the glass lift as effectively? TIGHTING GAL 43 ERCE FIGHTING VIPERS Here's a good demonstration of light-sourcing. The shadows give a strong 3D feel. Hur hur. There it is. The wall in full-on wraparound effect. You can see between each bar! S It looks as if the backdrops are flat scenes, moving in tandem with the foreground. Just as they were in Saturn VF2. KPN ata ily. With gourard shading, the edges are blended to brilliant effect! Much softer looking. Parp. TITIT. Wh /TURN SIUN 50% 50% HERE NEW GAMES How AM2 cope with switching the walls on and off, as the camera zooms and pans around, remains to be seen. The Tokyo Toy Fair. And look, the game is being played! By real people! Okay, that last bit's not so amazing. But this bit is look at that screen above. The game is already 50% complete! October folks!! NEXT MONTH ... SNAKEBITE! Saturn Fighting Vipers is going to be increeeedible! Other plans for it even include an advanced Version 1.1 not even released in the arcades yet. More next month, that's a promise. 91 "

Just like the N64 game, that first PilotWings was one of the games to be launched with the Super Famicom (Super NES) in Japan in December 1990. While Super Mario World provided players with the game they had been waiting for, and more, PilotWings offered something sensational because it was so different. Moreover, the Super Famicom game showcased the unique advantages of Nintendo's latest hardware. You couldn't do anything quite like Mode 7 on any other system.

SIMULATION INC HOW IS EACH VEHICLE CONTROLLED? After clearing each floating ring, hang glider pilots must gauge their approach to the landing area perfectly. \"There are three vehicles: hang glider, gyrocopter and rocket pack. Each vehicle is based on an extremely realistic physics model (with some minor concessions for fun!). All the vehicles take full advantage of the new Nintendo 64 controller, and in particular the controller's analogue joystick. Additionally, the controller givers the player the ability to explore 3D worlds by changing the eyepoint position and the direction of view. \"For all vehicles, the right shoulder button switches from first person to trailing observer viewpoints. The D-pad buttons change the direction the character looks, but without affecting the travel direction. The hang glider is controlled by the joystick alone, with the Z-button (trigger) used to take photographs. The gyrocopter uses the joystick for controlling the direction, the A and B buttons to change engine speed, and the Z-button to fire missiles. The rocket pack uses the joystick for controlling direction, the A and B buttons for two different levels of thrust, and the Z button for hovering.\" Hawk, the hang glider instructor.

"computer Video games NEW GAMES Each month it seems CVG is presented with every new game in development, for coverage 'somewhere in the magazine. So we have created these pages especially so we can show you as much new stuff as we possibly can. If there are any games you'd especially like us to chase, don't hesitate to drop us a line! STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 2. FORMAT: SATURN, PLAYSTATION, SNES BY: CAPCOM DUE: TBC (JULY/AUGUST JAPAN) It's no surprise that SFA2 is coming to Saturn and PlayStation. Capcom even had a 90% version of the game running on those systems at the Tokyo Toy Show. Once again Capcom promise a faithful port of the original arcade game. However, due to the increased number of characters and backgrounds, the animation frames have been slightly reduced for the home versions. It's not certain whether secret characters Evil Ryu, original Dhalsim and Zangief are to be included, as these are all Capcom of America additions. We'll keep you updated on that concern. Of course, most of these worries are all by the way for Super NES owners, who are also preparing for their interpretation. Everything will be reduced in some way or another for the 16-bit SFA2, excepting the full compliment of awesome moves. Plus, being cartridge based, Super NES SFA2 won't suffer from loading problems. Let's hope somebody licenses this funky version for the UK. 90 HUHUN HASH  This is where the game is  being developed. The gameplay is definitely 100% there!

Again, N64 is the object of your desires this month. Next month it'll be UK N64, no doubt. to Saturn. Street Fighter Alpha 2, however, is expected for both Saturn and PlayStation later this Summer. 1 NINTENDO 64 MARIO 64 3 VIRTUA FIGHTER 3 4 FIGHTING VIPERS 5 COLOUR GAMEBOY 6 STREET FIGHTER 3 7 MORTAL KOMBAT 4 8 DAYTONA REMIX 9 SONIC FIGHTERS 10 SONIC 4 MACHINE N64 ARCADE SATURN MACHINE ARCADE ARCADE SATURN ARCADE In an interview with CVG, to feature in next month's issue, Capcom revealed some hot news bites. Some of them too good to hang onto any longer than necessary. First of all Capcom have laid down firm development strategies for PlayStation and Saturn. And they're almost to be expected. Capcom see PlayStation as the champion of everything 3D, whereas Saturn is king of the spritebased games. Consequently Resident Evil 2 is a PS exclusive, which allows a more ambitious polygon count. So expect to find more ghouls infesting the same location in that sequel to heighten the level of fear. This also means that Star Gladiators is a PS exclusive, although don't hold your breath for that, as they say conversion work could take up to nine months and that's after it hits the arcades this summer. Sega's system, meanwhile, is capable of supporting the current cream of the complex 2D fighting games. So the That Capcom is developing for N64 is no longer a secret. What exactly they have planned is pure speculation at this stage. Whatever it is, it won't be Street Fighter 3 they say, mainly because this project is said to be impossible on any known home system. The revelation is that SF3 isn't 3D at all, but heralds the most advanced 2D technology and gameplay ever dedicated to a video game. At 50% completion, the only details Capcom were willing to confirm were the return of ken and Ryu, and the promise of at least four times the frames of animation. And they say the quality and depth is such that even the greatest SF2 fanatic will find it hard to return to that series having played the successor. Imagine how this game must look and play to m atch up to this incredible boast? Don't forget to include your Most Wanted lists with every letter. We're getting sackfuls of stuff now, so if you don't include them your letter stands less chance of getting printed. Among the | other anticipated games, which didn't quite make it to the chart, were Wave Race 64, and Zelda 5 on N64; Rave Racer, and Marvel Super Heroes on PlayStation (see Capcom story); Virtua Cop 2 for Saturn; and a fair few about 64-bit upgrades for existing 32-bit systems. Well, we hear rumours... Ryu and Ken are only two characters confirmed for SF3.

Apparently last issue's \"Import-ant\" feature price quotes were partly intended to quell the number of quizzical phone calls, and partly because importersa are unsure how many units would be making it out of Japan. But stocks are high, which means dealers can afford to go low in order to satisfy a greater demand. Here's the situation as it stands. Just as a matter of interest, the highest quoted price of the crazy period was !!! Komputer Trade Weekly recently speculated that N64 may well house a demo of sorts, to make up for the absence of a free game. It sounds like nonsense to us, but their reasons are well founded. Apparently NOA has stated that they are still looking at ways of providing some instant visual information for the hardware purchaser.\" It would be excellent if CTW are right.

Pick Jill Valentine if you wish to play an easier game: Nill can carry eight items in total and has fewer enemies to within the mansion, but she is the weakest player out of the two so watch her energy.

Though he only has six item slots, so finding chests to store items is imperative for Chris's game. Picking locks is also a weak point, so keys have to be located in order to open locked doors.
