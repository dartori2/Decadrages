"he guys at Mindscape INFLUSTE have got vampires on the brain (better than on your neck) with Drac on CD... Streetfighters turn to clay... and an update on Enforcers on the SNES... DRAC AND DRAGONS! OUT Mindscape reckons Dracula will be the \"first truly interactive movie\" on CD. ake a look at these pics and go 'Blimey!'. They're a taste of the CD jollies that Mindscape has in store for you lucky people! Dracula Unleashed on PC-CD is, according to the software boys in West Sussex, «the first true interactive movie,» and contains over an hour-and-a-half of video and an original CD soundtrack. As you might imagine, you've got to hunt down the pointy-toothed one and do the business with the pointed stick. It certainly looks the business we'll have to wait and see how it plays. Also on the horizon is Dragon Tales for PC-CD and 3DO. You take on the role of Werner Von Wallenrod, whose father has been killed by, erm, dragons, presumably, and you've got to avenge his death. Not a lot of info on this one, but according to Mindscape the 3DO version sports realistic interactive first-person views of television quality. Again, gameplay details are thin on the ground, but we'll bring you all the gen on these two very shortly. Can Dracula deliver the gameplay that other CD interactive movies have failed to do? Vampires? Who the bloody hell do they think they are, eh? NO SNES ENFORCERS? QO0000 CREDIT It's not clear yet whether Lethal Enforcers fpage-714 wille released on SNES. PLAYER 1 PATROLMAN SHOTS 22 ACCURACY een the review of Lethal Enforcers this issue (page 71)? Rather miffed because it's on Sega formats and you've got a SNES? Well don't worry it's coming to your machine. Perhaps. You see, there is a version ready to roll (and it's not bad at all, as it happens). The problem is pricing. Because of the strength of the yen and the fact that there's a large gun included in the package, it's going to cost around -80 over here. And for that reason, Konami is a trifle reticent about releasing. We'll bring you more information on the situation as it comes in, but you've got to admit that it's a pretty steep price to pay for a game, even if it is a good 'un. 92% Lethal Enforcers is now on Mega Drive. Pricing problems abound because Enforcers is packaged with a gun. "

EA GOES COIN-OP CRAZY CD versions of these games will ready for New Year. lectronic Arts may be putting a stop to its SNES activities for a while, but that hasn't stopped it from sticking its toe into a new venture coinops! In a move not-at-all connected with making even more dosh than the $300 million turnover achieved last fiscal year, EA opened a new coin-op division last month and hopes to have games available in the States by Spring. Initial titles will be based around the company's successful console sports sims, such as John Madden and EA Hockey, and is putting the emphasis firmly on the games, not the cabinets. \"We're not investing too much in hardware, and we think we have the software that can prove very popular,\" said European boss Mark Lewis. Mind you, MicroProse thought that when it launched the F-15 Strike Eagle coin-op, and look what happened to that. This game could set the CD scene alighi. Inferno, it's a game not a disco. "

Reviews of all to appear in the next couple of issues. icence king Acclaim has announced details of its Christmas release line-up and it's going to be quite considerable. Notable mentions must go to Mega Drive and SNES versions of The Incredible Crash Dummies, in which you control Spin through an array of different game styles as you attempt to rescue your creator, Dr Zub. Also on the horizon are versions of two Terminator 2 games T2 Judgment Day and T2 The Arcade Game. The latter is a straight SNES convert of the Op Wolf-style coin-op, whereas Judgment Day is a multi-level Arnie extravaganza bearing a closer resemblance to the film. This one's appearing on SNES, Mega Drive, Master System and Game Gear next month. Other titles appearing between November and January include Robocop 3 on Sega formats a conversion of the Ocean SNES original (let's hope they're better than that one), NFL Quarterback Club on SNES, Mega Drive and Game Boy being programmed by Park Place, the team responsible for EA's John Madden series and the miga and PC owners looking for a spot of hard and fast futuresport action on their machine could do worse than have a gander at these A Speedball 2 beater... pics from Millennium's forthcoming Brutal Football.

The most promising gadget we saw there was a set of glasses which project a TV screen image six feet in front of your face just the thing for the couch potato who's lost his couch, or for those who want to watch the football while they're playing it. Unfortunately, the things only seem to work if you've got 20/20 vision if you haven't, you can hardly see a thing, and it's not as if you can stick a pair of specs on to improve things, either. Still, we got to take a peep at all sorts of other things, like electronic notebooks and the like, but what we really wanted to get our hands on were the new games machines about to appear, like 3DO.

"FEATURE CVG GOES COIN-OP CRAZY AT... OIN-OPS GALORE! The Jamma Show in Japan is the coin-op industry's biggest event of the year, where all the latest arcade machines are previewed for the very first time. All the biggest and best arcade machines in the business are put on Free Play all day, and you can play on any or all of them for as long as you like! It's the most important day in the coin-op calendar, and naturally CVG was there to bring you this Exclusive report on the hottest arcaders you'll be playing soon. So why are you still hanging around here? Check out those games, now! FUNKY FIGHTER AIR COMBAT Fancy yourself as a bit of a bower boy? Well, this multi-button beater from Taito should sort you out. The game itself is a not-bad Streetfighter clone, but the cabinet's the star, Look at this screenshot for one of the most whizzo flight sims around. Namco's Air Combat is virtually the real thing. Expect to see this one in the arcades soon. BURNING RIVAL, LOONEY TUNES, ALIEN 3 \"Ere, if you don't stop posing I'm gonna knock your block off!\" Funk me, this Funky Fighter is well hard. Fly by the seat of your pants in Air Combat... ega is also set to unleash three more coin-ops on to an unsuspecting world. Burning Rival is a not-bad Streetfighter clone, while Looney Tunes is a sideways-scrolling racing game (not cars, legs) set around the world. Pick of the also-rans, though, has got to be Alien 3 The Gun, in which you get to blow away those xenomorph scumsuckers with a full-size replica of the Ripley mega machine-gun used in Aliens! The game is very similar to the T2 Arcade Game, but features tons more gore. And yes, we know the Alien 3 movie doesn't feature guns but for God's sake, don't write in about it because we simply don't care. "


"HAWK T HAWK SUPER STREETFIGHTER REVEALED! DO FEI LONG here's a new Streetfighter in town four of them, to be precise! Capcom's BIG announcement at the Jamma Show was the imminent arrival of Super Streetfighter 2 The New Challengers, with a novel range of features that will probably make every other beat-'em-up look like a bit of an old woman! There are now more scrappers than ever before along with the 12 from the Champion Edition a brand new quartet has entered the fighting fray and they all have brand new attack moves and the like; there's even a well-hard lady from the UK! What's most amazing about Super Streetfighter 2, though, is the all-new Tournament Battle Mode. This will enable you to link up four SSF2 machines, so you'll have to round up seven of your mates, and the eight of you can participate in a right royal rumble SIMULTANEOUSLY!

"WRESTLE SONIC THE COIN-OP! FEST he rumours are true! Sonic is joined by two new pals for all sorts of hedgehog hi-jinks in the first dedicated arcader to feature the world's most famous spikey mammal. Choose your hero from the likes of Sonic, Ray or Mighty (any combination, or all three) and pit yourself(ves) against the worst Dr Robotnik can throw your way in this diagonally scrolling rush-'em-up. Using a fairly unique graphics system (similar to viewpoint on Neo Geo but miles better) there are a billion and one obstacles to overcome before you finally get to confront old Rob in his danger land of doom. Animation is what really makes this one stand out THE HEDGEH from the crowd, with massive attention to detail. All three characters are very similar, but each has their own individual personalities and it's a dash for survival across Robotnik's world of seven challenges followed by the Great Escape. Surprisingly, Segasonic uses a trackball control method frantically spin said appliance to propel Sonic and pals with all possible haste across the screen. There are too many features in the game to recount at length, but one of the best is an Indy Temple Of Doom send-up in which Sonic grabs hold of a falling rope bridge, smacks into the cliff and climbs up the other side. Definitely one of the best coin-ops in quite a while, prepare to part with serious silver. Highly recommended. DGEHOG Nice game, nice machine. SEGA If you like sweaty men grappling each other in their underwear then this new wrestling game from Taito is just for you. Choose your grappler and scrap it out in the ring. Best thing about this game is the novel cabinet which features some seriously impressive graphics and sound. Top laugh! PER SONIC Doctor Robotnik, for it is he, beside his, um, control panel of, er, doom... HURRAH! Sonic and pals starts Rings and things threaten to their dash of death... thwart our heroes... Grapple me grapenuts... Crossing the ice chasm just couldn't be easier... As if we really needed telling which way to go... \"So, tell me, where exactly did you bury the car?\" VIRTUALLY FINISHED! VIRTUALLY REAL! OP SECRET: Sega is busily working on two of the hottest arcade machines in history Virtua Fighters and Virtua Star Wars. Early demos of both were available at the show, and both look completely superb. In fact, Virtua Fighters is probably going to prove the most outstanding coin-op of modern times imagine Streetfighter 2 in full Virtual Reality 3D and you get some idea of what we're getting all hysterical about. Choose your fighter from the selection on offer there'll be eight in the finished machine, but only two were on offer at the show and beat the crap out of each other across three timed rounds. Security was at maximum for the debut of this machine, with no pictures allowed, so you'll just have to take our word for it this game is brilliant. The fighters' movement is only slightly hampered by technology restrictions, so instead of fully recognisable humans scrapping it out you get virtually realised polygon people kicking heads, which somehow adds to the game's overall appeal. If Sega can keep up this standard through to completion, Virtua Fighters could even topple the mighty Streetfighter 2 as the greatest fighting game ever devised. We'll have more news and pictures very soon! Virtua Star Wars will be hot on its heels, though. Using an extension of the technology which created Virtua Racing, Sega is currently developing the ultimate Star Wars arcade machine. So far it's only 20 per cent complete, but we were treated to the full Death Star trench stage and the graphics are so good it's almost like playing the film! TIE Fighters scream in from the side of the screen as you try to negotiate the trench, complete with death-spitting laser turrets. Fail in your quest and Darth Vader's just going to laugh at you. Succeed and you'll restore freedom to the galaxy. Not bad for an estimated quid a go... "


"SEGA UNVEILS QUAZAR-STYLE GUN Feast your eyes on quite possibly the greatest racing game yet seen in the arcades the awesomely awesome Ridge Racer. Featuring state-ofthe-art graphics so real you'll think you're actually there, this one puts you behind the wheel of a turbonutmobile and lets you go wild. Anyway, just ogle this pic and wait for the game... RIDGERACER 707 38.4 Coming to Britain for Christmas, from those clever people at Sega, is the gun with no name. Randy shows how it's done in his suped-up Anglia GTI. ot off the production line from those endlessly innovative people at Sega is a Quazar-style shoot-your-mates set-up which should retail at less than  a pop. For this less-than considerable sum you get a nifty light-sensitive headpiece and a fairly big gun with which to shoot people between the eyes. Basically the headpiece works as a sort of targeting device (complete with Heads Up Display) while doubling up as target area for any low-life street scum tooled up with the same piece of kit. The system will work up to a range of 55 metres, which is quite impressive, and features extra goodies like a shots counter and game select switch. It all looks a bit of a laugh, but outside of Sega Japan nobody's played it properly because Sega staff wouldn't allow the prototype to leave their stand at the Jamma Show. The currently unnamed gadget could prove one of the bestselling toys this Christmas, and will go on sale in Japan soon at 5,600 yen (about ) with a discount double set retailing for 11,600 yen (). With a little luck, these will hit UK stores in time for Christmas. We'll keep you informed. WIN TURBO namco mco namco VIRTUA RACING 2! S ILVI TELEVISION FUN TELEY: irtua Racing sequel F1 Super Lap was also revealed for the first time at the Jamma Show, and it's going to be the official arcade game of the Formula 1 World Championship, no less. Not so much a sequel as a vastly improved version of the original, the game features nearly state-of-the-art polygon graphics (already superseded by Virtua Fighters) and some of the slickest racing gameplay we've yet seen. There's a multi-view option and booming sound, but for our money it's all a bit similar to the original. Well worth a shufty, though, for the tweaked playability and you get to race on real F1 tracks! GRAND PRIX GRAND PRIX Hey, isn't this supposed to be Nigel Mansell? Can't be, he hasn't crashed into anything. EL Double-seat smartness for head-tohead hilarity of an excellent kind. "

This is the place where you'll find every single game to be released on Super NS, NES and Game Boy over the coming months. So we sent Tim Boone, erstwhile editor of CVG, to said show in order to bring you all the goodies. Yes indeed, the exCVG boy braved the Tokyo rush hour, cold sushi and even a typhoon to bring you this detailed report on the hottest stuff at the show so the least you can do is sit back and enjoy... If you enjoyed Mario Paint then check out Sound Factory. version way back at the last CES. Still, Nintendo says it has at least three of its own FX titles currently in development, and some third parties are developing future FX games. Whether this is going to tide everyone over until Nintendo's announced 64-bit machine arrives remains to be seen. What Nintendo did have to show was Sound Factory a sort of Mario Paint with sound instead of pictures. It's actually a lot weirder than that, though, and the idea seems to be trying to follow a tune whilst bouncing across a Q*Bert-style landscape. Most weird. Game Boy fans are in for a treat. If handheld Zelda isn't enough to keep fans happy, Kirby's Pinball and Super WarioLand are both coming on the machine and both are absolutely superb. And still there's more: Tetris 2 is coming on Game Boy, and promises to be even more addictive than the original. But Pinball where ever you go with Kirby on the Game Boy. ncredibly, Nintendo didn't have any new games to show off at Space World even FX Trax wasn't there, and most people had already seen a 40 per cent complete 20 "

Luckily there was a fistful of wicked stuff from the third parties on show, so why don't we take a wander through it?

Choose your fighting Turtle from the four on offer (you know the names) and kick seven bells out of the others — there are also a few bosses thrown in for good measure. Rumour has it that you even get to give Shredder a good kicking if you get far enough, but what we can say is that the graphics are looking well smart. The game's obviously not as fast as Turbo, but Turtles does look a bit of a winner in the beauty stakes. Worth checking out. As usual, Konami has a stack of great new games. Among them is Goeman Warrior 2, follow-up to the hugely successful original which was never actually released in this country! The game is basically the same, but improved in every department. repare for one of the hottest arcade adventures around when Aladdin hits the Super NES soon.

Believe it or not, Streetfighter Turbo wasn't even at the show (it's already old news in Japan) but Capcom superhero Mega Man was making a big appearance, starring in no less than two 16-bit games! Mega Man X is our hero's first ever appearance on It's Aladdin with his gal in one of the superb pieces of animation from the game. Plenty of surprises are promised in this platform cum bash-'em-up from Capcom. the SNES, featuring his biggest chalNES owners haven't been left lenge ever and some of the out, either.

"FEATURE SONY STORMS IN! SUPER BOMBERMAN SNES CHUCK ROCK SNES/Game Boy SONY t seems as if new software companies are cropping up left, right and centre these days, all of them ready to flood the market with even more carts and disks. However, none of the recent crop of softies can claim to have so much product so early in their lives IMAGESOFT | than Sony Imagesoft, who this Christmas plan a head-on assault on the country's game stores with a massive list of titles across a wide range of different formats. CVG popped across to the firm's West End offices to take a peek at just what Sony has got in store over the coming festive period. (Sony: 071-734 5151.) Nintendo's two biggies get a taste of Chuck! The crazy Chromagnon character created by Core and originally released on Amiga gets an airing on SNES and Game Boy in November, and contains all the features which made the floppy version such a hit. Coming to SNES in November, Bomberman leaves behind the PC Engine to try his luck on the 16-bit Nintendo! All the frenzied action is in there, with the player controlling Bomberman in his quest to clear the levels by planting various types of explosive. For the first time, up to four players can participate simultaneously thanks to Nintendo's Multi-Tap definitely keep your eyes peeled for this 'un! LAST ACTION GEAR WORKS HERO Game SNES/Mega Boy/Game Gear Drive/ NES/Master System/Game Boy/Game Gear FLASHBACK SNES CLIFFHANGER SNES/Mega Drive /NES/Master System/Game Boy/Game Gear St.ark Based on the big Summer movie starring Sylvester Stallone, Sony is pushing Cliffhanger as one of the strongest titles in its current lineup. Featuring seven tortuous levels representing scenes from the film, you control Sly as you attempt to outwit the terrorists and collect the stolen money which has been scattered across the landscapes. Look out for staggered release during November and December. Handhelds are the domain of puzzle games, and Gear Works could well turn out to be one of the most addictive around! You've got to turn 12 Wonders Of The World into clocks, by linking together cogs while battling against the Poffins, which hinder your progress by rusting gears and other such atrocities. Look out for this one next month. Already a proven hit on Amiga and Mega Drive, Sony has picked up the rights to produced the SNES version of Delphine's unofficial sequel to Another World. You won't believe your eyes when you see the graphics rotoscoping techniques have been used to make the characters as realistic as possible and the gameplay is a corker, too. We've had SNES Flashback in the office (see page 126) for a couple of weeks and it seems every bit as enjoyable as the other versions keep 'em peeled for a full review next ish! EQUINOX The movie may have had its ass kicked at the box office by Jurassic Park, but Sony is confident that this state of affairs isn't repeated in the video game arena. Become Jack Slater in a left-to-right scrolling beat-'em-up that smacks of Final Fight, taking on many of the baddies from the film.

The Mega-CD version of this game was, to be honest, a bit poor, and it remains to be seen whether Sony has put things right for the cartridge versions. We shall see next issue. Sony is going gaga over this one. It's a fantasy adventure set in an age of wizards and warriors. Sky Blazer must rescue the sorceress Arianna from the clutches of the evil Ashura. Do battle against warriors, wizards and a host of different monsters using a wide array of weapons. Possibly the jewel in Sony's Christmas crown, Sky Blazer makes its debut late November. Already reviewed by CVG a few issues back, Equinox received a well-deserved CVG Hit!, for its gorgeous graphics and absorbing gameplay. Similar in style to the old Spectrum smash Knight lore, Equinox consists of eight huge levels, more than 450 rooms and a stack of obstacles to overcome. Start saving those pennies in time for release next month! Sensible Software's Amiga and PC smash makes its first console appearance next month!

"WORD UP ITH PAUL UZZAH! Welcome to the mightiest games mag known to man! From this issue Yours Truly slides into the Editor's throne left vacant by Garth, who's gone to work for Sega, testing their games to make sure they're up to scratch. Which explains why a strawberry-blond Geordie gets to edit everyone's favourite games mag. And that's not all it's Big Change Central at CVG this month, with no less than THREE new staff members on the team! Ladies first and all that, AMANDA TIPPING scoops the world to join CVG after a stint freelancing for national newspapers, including my favourite, The Sun! Fleet Street's loss is our gain. Some of you may already know DENIZ AHMET from his years as Games Editor on Satellite Times, which got to be so good that we even started to worry! Amanda and Deniz are both games loonies as well as damned fine writers, so I know you're all going to get along just fine. And to complete the terrific trio, please raise your glasses for GARY LORD! Gaz is CVG's new Production Editor, which means he gets to shout at everyone when they're not getting the copy written on time. Now all that's out of the way, on to the really important stuff: this issue's full of more scoops than Mister Frostie's trousers, with Exclusives on all sorts of stuff. Check out our in-depth coverage of Robocop vs Terminator on all formats, together with more hot stuff than is safe to stand. This month we've flown all the way to Japan to bring back Exclusive news on all the hottest coin-ops including the awesome Super Streetfighter and the full SP from the recent Nintendo show in Tokyo! These are just a few of the treats in store this issue, and it must be said we're rather proud of the mag.

"MEET THE CVG CREW: STOP PRESS! PAUL Our man Rand gets all the best freebies now he's in the hotseat (which probably explains why we couldn't find him on the day the mag was going to press), but his favourite blag has to be the week he spent in West Palm Beach with Virgin almost exactly a year ago! 'lt were grand,'beamed Paul. Muhammed Ali was there, and so was Greg Norman. Greg spoke to me, in fact!' And what were the words uttered to our Ed by the Great White Shark? \"Excuse me, I think you're sitting in my seat.' Doh! INFL GARY Gaz's best freebie was courtesy of US Gold, the excuse being that they were releasing a game which had \"something to do with planes\" (he's a one for detail is our new Prod Ed). Anyway, the Goldies From Brum paid for him to do a parachute jump (blimey, he must have given one of their games a slating!). To Gaz's relief he never acutally got to jump because on both attempts it was too foggy: This was hardly surprising though,' says Gaz, 'They'd built the aerodrome on top of the foggiest hill in the country!' Anyone who thinks Gary just bottled it can send derogatory postcards to the usual address, CHEAP SNES GAMES It looks as though Nintendo has backed down on its pricing policy for third party publishers! At present, Nintendo of Japan has been forcing the likes of EA, Konami et al to purchase their cartridges in yen, which has gone through the roof during the past couple of months from 160 to 240. What that meant was, basically, software companies would have had to release their SNES games at around + in this country. What was compounding matters was that Nintendo were still releasing their own carts at .99, forcing Electronic Arts to announce their pulling out of the Nintendo marketplace. Now, Nintendo has stated that companies can buy their carts in dollars, which are much cheaper and should pave the way for less expensive SNES games this Christmas. EA has announced that it will now be continuing its European SNES activities thanks to this move so you can disregard the story in this month's News. Hurrah! DENIZ Having been Games Editor of Satellite Times for four years, you'd expect Den to have been inundated with invitations across The Pond to spend every spare weekend sunning it up with all the top movie stars and starlets! So you'd probably be surprised to hear that the man Ahmet's best freebie ever was... wait for it...a synthesiser. Any hilarious anecdotes attached to this tale of musical gratuity? 'Erm, exclaimed Deniz. No doubt Rand will be letting him have some of his top blags out of pity. (Snigger Ed) AMANDA 'That was an excellent holiday! beamed Ms Tipping as she told us a jolly story of her free trip to the South of France to cover a resort over there. Amanda picks up the plot: 'I was supposed to be going on my own, but I persuaded the company giving me the freebie that I needed a photographer to go with me, and they agreed. Funny, I didn't know until then that my boyfriend could use a camera!' No doubt our Publisher will be bearing this tawdry tale in mind when it's time to send someome to Las Vegas CES... Doh! Because we've all been rushing around like blue-bummed flies, grabbing exclusives galore and all sorts of top features for this issue, we, erm, forgot to leave a space in News for this month's Spot The Shot comp. But never fear, CVG's here with the latest in the line of pulled-apart piccies to tease, tantalise and earn one lucky reader a  software prize! This month, the pic we've messed around with is but wait a mo, you're supposed to tell us, aren't you! It's in the mag somewhere in its correct state; all we want you to do is send us a postcard telling us which one it is. Send your entry to SPOT THE SHOT 6 at the usual CVGI address and you could be the lucky winner! JULIE Poor old Julie. She's not a very popular person, hence she only gets the gifts that no one else wants To date, CVG's Art Ed has received a T-shirt with a satanist on the front, a couple of rather poor heavy metal CDs and a Mario All-Stars shirt which Paul, in a rare fit of generosity, gave her. So come on, softies, put a smile on our Heapy's chops and give her some free stuff We promise we won't nick it before she gets to check the mail! STEVE He likes a blag, does CVG's esteemed Managing Editor. But none could possibly match the receipt of FREE money while strolling casually down the high street! 'I was walking down the road, past the cash dispensing machine, when all of a sudden it started to spew out money! I was in two minds as to what to do, but then my conscience took over and I... Steve declined to finish the story for legal reasons but the CVG team are well impressed by his brand new  snakeskin sandals! GARRY He's football crazy! He's football mad! He's The Wodge, CVG's Publisher! Recently Garry was invited to a special VIP dinner at Wembley, the highlight of which was the exciting England vs Poland World Cup qualifier. Wodge was the life and soul of the party, and even made two new friends Colin the waiter took a particular shine to Gaz, and the important person from Dixons even managed a smile, once. 33 "

Now concoct a half-baked plot to justify the ensuing mayhem and hey presto! Robocop vs The Terminator. THE I'm talking about). As he battles his way through each level, Robo has the opportunity to pick up what best comes under the term of 'stupid guns'. Stupid in that they fire a stupid amount of ammo and do a stupid amount of damage. Just the way it should be. See the panel for details. ollow this for a plot. Seeing as how Robocop was the first incidence of a human brain connecting directly with a computer, the scientists working on the creation of Skynet decide to use his technology to help them. Once Skynet is up and running however, it gains self-awareness and determines mankind to be the root of all the world's problems (pretty perceptive huh?) and launches the war seen in the Terminator films. The reasoning behind why, Terminators are trying to destroy Robo, and how he winds up in the future is a little sketchy, but then when has a sensible plot ever been necessary for a shoot-'em-up? Just get the two android annihilators together and watch the sparks fly. YEARS AFTER ROBODOR'S INVENTION CYBERDYNE SYSTEMS IS CONTRACTED BY SAC-NORAD TO BULIB THE SKYNET.

Robo in the thick of things. the first few levels, resistance fighters in the latter) and it's up to Robo to see them to safety. It's a good thing they are immune to bullets, as usually they're surrounded by so much unfriendly firepower that to get to them you practically have to nuke everything in sight. Guns, guns, guns You wouldn't expect a law-dealing mechanoid like Robocop to dispense justice merely armed with a ticket book and a few helpful pamphlets, Equally you wouldn't expect him to just carry a single weapon in his leg (you've seen the film, you know what VERDICT Yes! Action, excitement, gratuitous violence, extremely large guns and just plain silly amounts of bullets! All the perfect ingredients for the most perfect shoot-'em-up to make its perfect way on to our perfect screens. There's hardly a bad word to be say about Robo vs The T-Man, apart from you can't play as the Terminator. The learning curve is spot-on, with the first levels being only slightly tricky and the subsequent ones just getting more so. The graphics are brilliant, the sound superb and the atmosphere intense. GET THIS NOW!!! human skin covering it needs a few clips worth of ammo more than usual. Once into the future you come across a third type of Terminator (not including the end-of-level guardian variants) the red terminator. Even harder than the others and 10 times as dangerous; when a red terminator walks on to the screen you're best advised to take cover. Hit 'em in the head and watch Them explode The Mary Whitehouse brigade will come down on us like a ton of bricks for this but... the most satisfying aspect is when you shoot someone made of flesh and blood, you get to see most of it distributed across the screen. Humans have a tendency to explode violently when shot. In contrast Robocop looks sad when he just collapses to his knees and says \"Urgh\". There is an option to tone down all this red-coated carnage, but unfortunately it involves going out to Dixons, buying a SNES and playing that version. For Megadrive owners it's blood or nothing I'm afraid. Paul Presley Don't shoot the hostages Unfortunately this isn't even an option.

"Gratuitous gory shot numbe MEGA DRIVE PROS: Just about everything. Excellent licence, excellent game. He said he'd be back! CONS: Nothing (except the lack of a Terminator control option). That's some SERIOUS firepower! An awesome arsenal awaits our Arie-annihilator. Here are some of the better weapons The grenade launcher. Fire a grenade then guide it around the screen. Just the thing for shooting that bad guy around the comer. The homing missiles. Once fired these automatically home in on the nearest opponent. The laser pistol. The first of the futuristic weapons is awesomely powerful against Detroitians but hopelessly outclassed against Skynet's forces. The laser cannon. Now we're talking. Terminators are vapourised with a single shot, machinery doesn't stand a chance and it makes a cool \"Whump-whump\" noise, Yeeeahh! The ED-209 cannon. Just the thing for making people stop and say \"My God that's chuffing enormous». Can be obtained by shooting it off the front of an ED-209. The three-way flamethrower. The weapon with the widest spread also has a distinct bonus. You can shoot enemy bullets with it, making life a hell of a lot safer. Bag 398 GRAPHICS Detailed sprites and excellent animation. Blood count a little high though. SOUND Loud and violent. Sound doesn't get much better than this. Pump that volume right up. Ever remindful of his chic hood, Robo doesn't like to play with fire. GAMEPLAY Well 'ard, well violent, well difficult and well balanced (unlike me). VERDICT A QUICK TOUR OF THE FUTURE These are just some of the exciting locations awaiting you on your trip to tomorrow, Don't panic if the thought of fighting your way through an apocalyptic future sounds too tough. Robo starts his march of carnage in present day Detroit, laying waste to hoodlums, thugs, despots and other low-life vagabonds. The OCP building serves as a useful backdrop for some totally gra tuitous damage. With a mission brief of 'rescue the hostages and trash the building' you know you're on for some serious weapon misuse. A trip around the toxic waste plant is always a hair-raising affair. Coming complete with acid vats and gas leaks, you'll also have a run in with your former arch-nemesis Robocop 2, the killer Cain. Wandering around the deserted streets of a war-torn future, Robocop starts to encounter the Terminator army in force. Everything from Arniedroids to mechanical spiders is thrown at him. The Skynet base. Peaceful, serene, full of local colour, atmosphere and death-dealing robotic defences. What more could the happy tourist want? Plenty of levels to to keep you happy, and the learning curve is just right. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Here's a marvellous game starring everyone's favourite metal-heads, knocking lumps out of everything and anything that gets in their way. The graphics in Robocop vs Terminator are incredible; all the sprites are beautifully detailed and superbly animated, the blood is splashed about liberally which gives the player the feel that these two characters really don't care who gets caught in the crossfire, and the gameplay is pitched just right starts hard, gets even harder, never becomes dull. Vicious, violent and tons of fun -get it! 10 9 ONWAOOOOOO PAUL RAND HIT 93 ED-dy baby! Long time no see. Here, have some hot lead for your trouble. 35 "

Beats keeping the streets safe with only a stout billy club, doesn't it? Metal mashing As regular readers will know, the plot of this game is based on the Dark Horse comics of the same name wherein a gang of Terminators gets sent from the future to cause trouble on Robocop's beat in Old Detroit. You play Roboplod himself, in what is ostensibly a platform game.

It's very bloodthirsty mind, with humans screaming and exploding in a shower of gore when you 'caution them with your sidearm, and lots of stripping the Terminators down to their endoskeletons.

Driving with out a licence eh? IT'S A FILM, IT'S A GAME, IT'S A COMIC VERDICT 13 Comic fans will probably be aware of the Robocop Vs Terminator series of stories published by Dark Horse publishing. Established to explore the unlikely scenario of this spooky duel, this small company run by Frank Miller has enjoyed great success bonding the strong link between comics and films. Perhaps the most famous comic link was forged with the Batman Dark Horse series which provided the inspiration for Tim Burton's Goth atmosphere in the Batman films. Other classic Dark Horse comics already in game form are Robocop 3 and Alien 3. Take a look for a solid read. Why is that whenever mankind is at stake, there's only one hero available? Robo Vs Terminator captures images from both films, while following the plot of Frank Miller's awesome comic range. The result is a stomp in to the land of eightway scrolling blast-'em-ups. There are 12 tricky levels, but the action will seem overwhelmingly long before that. Thankfully, passwords prevent the whole thing from becoming boringly frustrating, because if you stick with this game you'll be rewarded by the later levels. This is quality platform carnage. FRANK GARTH SUMPTER 38 "


"GUN HO! SNES VERDICT IR Pamicom SAYS Apart from the odd bimbo appearing, avid defenders of the universe will delight in this tense game which captures certain scenes from both films. The action starts the moment you pick up the joypad, so there's no time to fiddle with the controls. I'm not the greatest fan of saving the world, but there's enough going on in this to keep you contented for hours. Baddies galore, acid baths and powerful weapons combine the ideal ingredients for a fast-action game packed into 12 levels providing tough challenges for a change. When you're up against the Terminator it's not enough to be tough. You need armoury that's harder than a Terminator's tooth. There are seven weapons to collect in the game, but we don't want to spoil the surprise by revealing all of them, so here are our top three favourites. PROS: Good boy's game. Lots of violence. CONS: Bad girl's game. No romance. PAUL RAND Take two Terminators into the shower? Not me. ED-209 gun: big and hefty, this device is identical to that! used by the 209 machine. You might find one lying around or you can steal the original item when you defeat the 209 towards the start of the game. It's quick on the draw and a fine all-rounder. GRAPHICS Moody and smooth, but no new ideas. Some great backgrounds too. Some ripping sound effects but the soundtrack doesn't compliment the action. Grenade launcher: if massive damage is your cup of T(2). then seek this one out. It's perhaps the slowest weapon, but great at long distance targeting once you get the hang of it. GAMEPLAY Non-stop carnage and platform hopping, flawed by frustrating difficulty curve. up the first few levels that you eventually encounter a Terminator, and make no mistake, you'll know it's him, because it takes a number of shots to kill him. The strategy for dealing with the Terminators is basically to ensure you have the most powerful weapon at hand when you encounter them. Thankfully, such encounters tend to come with the odd smart bomb or energy boost near by so it's not all grim. Moviedrome Robo Vs Terminator does recreate the atmosphere of the movies well, especially impressive is the floor of rotten skulls scene taken from the start of T2, and the classic duel between Robocop and ED-209. For some reason, many of the baddies are girlies with the obligatory heav. ing chests, but don't get too close, otherwise the only chest you'll be feeling is your own, and it will be pumped full of lead. As for the end, of level bosses, they just get bigger and bigger in a 'give me a break' kind of way. This game's bound to be a huge hit. It's full of the kind of gameplay which made Super Probotector such a massive game about a year ago. Your parents wouldn't approve of it, but hey, that must mean it's good. Deniz Ahmet Plenty of levels, but similar styles. You'll be pumping lead for weeks. Laser Cannon: as usual laser cannons can dispose of most baddies with just a few shots. Just don't expect to fire 180 rounds per minute. This one's good at close range. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Ooer, doesn't anyone use tissues to blow their nose?

"PREVIEW MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE OUT: October by CAPCOM — .99 Contact Sega (071 373 3000) for information. SPECIAL CHAMPION EDT ON KO The biggest game EVER finally gets its Mega Drive airingand it's an absolute ONSTER! ay attention to every word contained on these two pages as they form the review for the most eagerly awaited game the Mega Drive has ever seen. Of course this kind of statement has appeared in console mags before, however in this case it is the simple truth. Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition assures Mega Drive owners their console is the bearer of a near-flawless home conversion of one of the most magnificent coin-ops in the history of video games, and then some! Not only does this monster 24-meg cart house both the Champion Edition and the Turbo enhancements but a whole host of other options too that are unique to the Mega Drive. A hard smack to the shin-ouch! from eight World Warriors' who proceed to compete against each other in brutal combat. After besting their associates in a series of 'best-ofthree' bouts a further four 'Boss' characters present themselves as the final obstacles before the title of World Warrior is achieved. In its most basic form Streetfighter ll not only secured many spaces in the arcades but eamed a fortune in the process. A year later Capcom announced a revamped version and called it 'Streetfighter '92: Champion Edition'. And now it's on Mega Drive. The basic mechanics of the original game are given a complete overhaul in Champion Edition. Speed is increased, the sound effects bettered and the characters' fighting abilities improved. More significantly players may choose to play as the four bosses alongside being able to choose identical characters for two-player vs games. And, for .99 not only does the buyer get an arcade perfect translation of Champion Edition, with every last pixel of the front-end presentation intact, but the Turbo enhancements as well! WOULD YOU SPILL THEIR PERRIER? Mega Drive Streetfighter II is entitled Special Champion Edition because it has the exclusive Match/Elimination option. Here players choose a team to compete against a friend's selection. The winner of the most bouts is deigned champion. In the Match option players have a single bout to decide who's master. Amazingly this isn't the end to the player-controlled refinements. Any character's special moves are accessible to either able or disable, therefore handicapping players who rely too heavily on one tactic. And, with the aid of a ten-star variable speed setting option, players may battle against the computer or a friend at whichever speed they please. What more is there to say except a few words of re-introduction to the men and woman who began this craze in the first place. Slads of Streefigh It isn't necessary for us to point out the overbearing significance of Street Fighter II. Any game that spawns two sequels which are as popular -if not more so — than the original indicates that the programmers are on to something! The 1991 version of Streetfighter ll allows players to chose RYU Honda gets it in the neck. PACHEDEN Along with Sagat, Ryu is the only character who has made it from the original Street Fighter coin-op where he was destined to become champion with his mighty Dragon Punch. Not only does he have this technique, but Ryu can also summon fireballs from his hands and churns the air with his powerful legs as he performs a Hurricane Kick. Ryu represents Japan and trained in the art of Karate under the teaching of the legendary Sheng Long. KO 85 Turbo enhancements: Air Hurricane Kick and a fabled Burning Dragon Punch. Wicked. "

Though her claim of being the strongest woman in the world hasn't rung exactly true in the past, this female powerhouse now has more tactics at her beck and call than most any other fighter in this fine tournament. Dhalsim's all in a spin. KEN VERDICT Turbo enhancements: Spinning Bird Kick performed whilst in mid air, a Wusha Fireball and she is more resilient. Another student of Sheng Long, Ken travelled to America — the country he has chosen to represent — where he has learned to improve his phenomenal technique. His moves are exactly the same as Ryu's, only his Dragon Punch swings out in a wider arc and his throwing techniques are more spectacular than before. Streetfighter 2: Special Champion Edition is incredible! Arcade-perfect presentation shines through in this 24Mb monster, with coin-op quality graphics and more options than you know what to do with. Sampled sound is slightly scratchy, but the music is great and you know about it when a kick or punch makes contact!

Perhaps that's why Grant can find a number of weapons to help him blast the dinosaurs. Here's the list (you start with a stun gun). Film licences can go either wazy, as Ocean well knows. So is Jurassic a real dog or a storming great T-rex? SHOTGUN: This has multiple shots and can destroy smaller dinosaurs. MISSILE: Limited but powerful and can be upgraded to a rocket launcher! film's characters.

Anyway social etiquette aside, Jurassic the game promises to be bigger than a dinosaur dropping (and they're big), emulating the colossal success Jurassic Park the flick has had, proving that we are still a nation of animal lovers; well we like the herbivores, and the odd omnivore. Annoyingly, the Mega Drive conversion of Jurassic was a poor start to a valuable licensing deal (despite having sold millions in the USA). SO can the SNES offering avoid the jaws of criticism? Take it from us, it's a good job that Ocean had decided to follow the basic plot of the film for its SNES conversion, otherwise we would, have been stuck with the same old platform tie-in that about 2 million other films have been subjected too. variety of dinosaurs roaming around the park, including the stampeding gallimimus things, which can knock off heaps of your energy. Although there are a few weapons they are all limited in ammunition, and you can only handle three at a time. It's sensible to use different weapons for different dinosaurs; anything the size of your legs can be destroyed with a tazer stun gun, but a raptor will only be knocked out by it temporarily U don't know why the l'or 'R' buttons haven't been used for selecting weapons instead of select'). GAS GRENADE: Effective against groups of dinosaurs, but the bigger they come the slower they take to fall. Monster Kombat Now, those much hyped 3D sections appear when you enter any of the buildings in the park. Doing so takes you to a new type of game: The perspective is head-on, with scenery moving past you as in any racing, game. However, the screen update is a bit sluggish making it quite difficult to tackle dinosaurs in close range combat Everything is a maze of corridors and it's easy to get lost. Some buildings have different floors too, so you have to find a lift to get to these. Success in the game is concentrated around finding your way through these mazes, for as with the film, your task is to switch on the generator and restore energy to the park. That's easier said than done though, for it's easy to find a computer to reboot the system (that is, after you find the generator but not necessarily the right computer. It soon becomes obvious that the right computer is probably hidden in one of the corridors which require an ID card to access. And typically you need to find all the character's ID cards to be sure, and at least one of those is hidden in a room for which you need to find a pair of night vision goggles. Pop corn You get used to dying in this game and there's a shortage of first-aid, kits. You soon realise however, that there are more power-ups inside than out, so it's worth exploring inside before dealing with the ugly mothers outside. There are heaps of tasks to perform before you can get off the island (six in all) and it's all a bit time consuming so you'll need plenty of pop com from the usherette.

Two distinct styles of play make this game two different kind of games. You have the outdoor overhead scrolling thingy, and an indoor 3D perspective head-on thingy. The open-air is full of familiar sights with electric fencing and streams separating the different dinosaurs into captive areas. The fencing serves as a means of creating a maze-like approach to the terrain; certain electric fencing gates cannot be opened until a later stage though.

"ILZZZZZZZ Raptors are the fastest dinos and attack in packs, usually, SNES VERDICT ER Pancom Jurassic Park on the SNES is vastly superior and totally different to the Mega Drive version. It looks smashing, with hefty detailed sprites and some quite outstanding sounds. Both the indoor and outdoor elements of gameplay make for a compelling challenge, but there's a brutal difficulty curve which proves initially frustrating. It's one of those games which starts off tame but rewards patience with new levels of gameplay depth. As such, it deserves to sell as a quality product and not just on the name. PROS: Possibly Ocean's best tie-in to date. CONS: The 3D sections are a bit rough.

LLLLLLLLLL UIT VERDICT There are more power ups inside, MISSOK HIT! 20 of Ocean's top chaps have been working on this one since last November, and it shows. Basically there are two distinct styles of game arena; the outside is a remake of the park with a Commando-style feel to it and the inside delivers an atmospheric 3D romp, though it is a bit repetitive at times. There is a level of gameplay depth in Jurassic which only becomes apparent when you stick with it. In many ways the six necessary tasks are logical enough, but the fact that your energy bar isn't very generous can be really annoying. DICERET 100 While would just been zapped. PAUL RAND 49 "


"PC/AMIGA 1200/500 by OCEAN 234.99/27.99/25.99 Out October. Contact Ocean (061 832 6633) for information. 60 million years in the making, and Jurassic Park hits the PC Give us a clue and Amiga like a rapid raptor. We really think you ought to like it, and ooh! we've even written a review to tell you why! A lot of the gameplay in Jurassic involves using the many computer terminals scattered willy nilly around the klandscape. Walk up to any of these and log on to the dino park's network. This provides valuable hints and access to functions such as opening park gates and shelter doors, Hey kids, follow me. I'm a hero Give me shelter If it all gets too much there are places to shelter from the exhibits'. These are huge, indoor, 3D head-on mazes but beware: dinosaurs can get inside them too! Inside are many items for you to collect and use; these will help you to locate and activate the park's generator. Some sections will be blocked until you find the relevant ID cards, which could be anywhere. Similarly, soma sections will be impossible without night vision goggles. First aid kits will keep you going in the game (just), but you're only human, and only have one life. Die and yeah, you've guessed it, it's do it all again time. Aargghh! Deniz Ahmet Hey boys, three's a crowd! U nlike the single playing field in the SNES version, the game here has been divided into eight paddocks, which provide heaps more variety and depth of play. Admittedly, the indoor 3D sections link the different paddocks, but they're still a separate and crucial part of the game. Each paddock provides a home to a particular type of dinosaur, although there are plenty of others who have strayed in. In this way, the game has deliberately followed the Jurassic book more closely than the film to enable the use of more dinosaurs and environments. Grant can't get by with just using a strong left-hook on a raptor though, so there is the occasional piece of convenient armoury to help you along. Initially you carry a stun tazer. It can kill small dinosaurs but only stun the bigger ones. But this is the only close-range weapon you'll have to contend with. All the others are long-range mega-blasters with varying levels of annihilation. Grant will always select the most powerful weapon in his possession, but you can switch guns at will. Go inside huts for 3D mayhem. ometimes, but not very often, a licence gets put to good use. You notice this about Jurassic the moment that you see the slick raytraced introduction. Then you go on to discover that — yes! Ocean has actually followed the film's plot, instead of a bog standard 'let's play it safe and do a platform game mentality. The objective is to rescue Tim and Lex, the grandchildren of John Hammond (played by Dicky 'luwie Attenborough, film fans!) Guide them through the infested levels en route to the Visitor Centre then restore the park's security and summon a helicopter to take you to safety. Bleedin' kids Of course, this game would be dead simple if it wasn't for the small problem of big, vicious dinosaurs roaming around. The paddocks, which separate each species into individual territories, have malfunctioned, and the dinosaurs, being curious little things, have gone walkies where they please. Those snotty kids, Tim and Lex, have run for cover; as you would do if a bloody great, hungry-looking prehistoric monster came running towards you. Saving these kids from becoming dino snacks is the object of the game 50 Sneaky VERDICT The dinosaurs aren't the only obstacle in Jurassic. You also have to find your way around Cliffs, trees and avalanches! And sometimes terrain and reptiles combine to make life difficult. Raptors love to spring out at you from behind trees and bushes, and rocks have a disturbing tendency to crush you whenever you walk by Dr Grant, the character you take control of (Sam Neil to movie buffs, or indeed Sam Neil buffs), can n boulders around to get to higher platforms, which is vital in some stages, but he can't survive a drop off a platform higher than himself. More bloomin dinosaurs on the rampage! Haven't they become fossilised yet? Obviously not; it seems that Jurassic mania is going to be with us long past summer, but that's no bad thing! The heavy dinos have hit the games screen with a terrific game of the film, which has stuck closely to the plot. With excellent animation and creepy monsters mooching around the park, it's hard to become bored with the game. There aren't many levels but they're big enough to keep the adrenaline pumping for a while. Top stuff! GARTH SUMPTER "


"PC /AMIGA Could that be the generator? PROS: The strongest tie-in of all formats on PC. You can run but you can't hide! CONS: Can take a while to get in to the flow of things. Just what's behind that corner. GRAPHICS Plenty of detail throughout the game with stunning 3D sections on a PC. Ooer! There's something useful! Grant thinks he's a rail car? INODS Not quite as funky as the SNES version but more a lot more atmospheric Deeper and deeper we explore. Too big to mess with I'd say. VERDICT Extra PC speed provides a better feel, and the indoor-outdoor set-up is good. Two quite distinct games have combined to make one unique one in Jurassic Park. The Amiga and PC versions are equally involving on the outdoor sections (if unoriginal), yet it is on the inside that the PC game manages to take centre stage, lavishing itself in full-screen, smooth and naturally wowish 3D effects that'll leave you sweaty and tense. While the Amiga version is commendable, it doesn't really cut it on the 3D side, but that's a technical problem. Still, Jurassic is easily Ocean's best tie-in to date.

Jurassic Park is one of the hot contenders for Christmas number one if it does half as well as its celluloid daddy, it'll be up there for mo Anyway, what's the plot? Jurassic Park has gone haywire; the power is down and the dinos are roaming free throughout the island. To make matters worse, the grandchildren of John Hammond, eccentric billionaire and owner of the park, are missing in the complex. As paleontologist Dr Allan Grant, you've got to find the kids, restore power to Jurassic Park, torch the raptors, radio the mainland and get the hell out of there! EGG: Clear the level of these to receive a building pass. He's called Rover you know. I've never seen a blue dino before! VERDICT PASS: Lets you enter buildings and gives access to the main computer. AMMO BALL: Dropped by dead dinos, pick them up for an ammo boost. Jurassic Park on NES isn't going to be full of the whistles and bells possessed by the 16-bit games the 3D maze section has been omitted, but 8-bit junkies nevertheless get a sound game that's a little different from the usual platform stuff movie licences always seem to become. Graphically the game is a little basic, but the dinosaurs look good, especially the T-rex. Sound is fine there's even the odd sampled dino-roar in there and gameplay holds together well. All in all, a sound buy if you're an NES-owning fan of the film. AMMO: Left behind by security, this wipes out dinos in one shot.  SENSOR: Gives clues to what's happening in the park. PAUL RAND Plenty of ammo There are six levels to negotiate, each one dangerously overflowing with dinosaurs. Luckily, the park guards have left ammunition lying around which you can pick up and use on your ancient adversaries. Alternatively, you can grab ammo balls left behind when you kill one of the critters; although they do less damage, the ammo balls come in very handy in a tight corner. To complete each level, you must pick up or destroy the eggs which the now-breeding dinos have left lying around. Collect them all and you receive a card which allows access to the park's buildings and lets you use the computer which controls the gates. On later levels, you'll be up against not only the little dinosaurs such as compys and dilophosaurs, but the not-nice-at-all velociraptors and king of all it surveys, the ferocious, 40foot tyrannosaurus-rex.

Contact Electronic Arts 0753 549442) for information JOHN MADDEN '94 RAIDERS WESELL 1994 is just around the corner, so it's about time for another Madden game SIELIUL Real team names are used in '94. We're being invaded by a UFO run! VERDICT ohn Madden must be making a packet out of these games! They just keep coming. The problem is that they all look a bit samey, and they play samey too. Dive deeper however, and you soon realise that there is actually a bit more to it. The main benefit I'm assured is that there's an improved graphics engine offering faster and larger sprites and a new higher perspective which has finally solved the problem of not being able to define the ball from the other end of the pitch. EA has obviously sorted its life out a bit and now has the NFL licence so you can finally get to play using real team names like the Raiders. The story's the same for Madden '94 as it is for NHLPA Hockey '94: there is no reason to buy this if you own an earlier offering. Perhaps I'm missing something, but better graphics and real team names don't warrant being another  out of pocket. If you're a new player on the other hand, this might turn your head, because it's a very realistic attempt at the sport and earlier versions have sold heaps (and heaps!). It's not that I can't appreciate what it offers, it's just that I don't see it achieving much as a sequel. Coub    .  1 Tthe 10 Heads I win, tails you loose! PAUL RAND Offensive For broad shouldered readers there is an enormous range of offensive moves, 74 to be precise, but it really takes a fan to be bothered with all of that. That's the main problem with Madden, for those who aren't taken in by the sport it's too slow moving and too much fuss to play. OK, so the atmosphere created by the game is quite indulging, but the computer is a right swine to beat and that combined with the distinctive trial and error approach makes the game a bit droopy.

Ah well, let's see if CVG can at least go where no mag has gone before and avoid using one (damn, sorry but I did warn you). Captain's log In true Star Trek-style (hey, dig that funky Sixties groovy remix of the theme that appears to have been stuck to the front of the game) the game is split into seven missions, each taking the form of a separate TV episode, complete with opening credits, Captain's Log intro and jokey/philosophical bit at the end. Each mission generally takes the following form of: receive orders, warp to the appropriate sector/ planet/other spacial positioning measurement, engaging in a spot of combat with the bad guys then beaming down to the planet to enter the heart of the mission. ENERGISE! For maximum Star Trek effect, read the next series of captions by talking in a mid-American accent, putting long pauses in the middle of words for no reason, apart from dramatic effect, and varying the speed of your speech. You'll be talking like Kirk in no time. Kirk Exclaimed: \"Goodness gracious, great balls of fire.\" Shields up The space combat is possibly the weakest point of the whole game, in that it's slightly on the jerky side and most times not necessary to the plot being there merely to satisfy the action addicts among us. Using the main viewscreen you manually fly the ship around space in Elite Wing Commander style, using phasers or 1. Captain's Log. We have beamed down to Pollux V to investigate reports of demon attacks. 4. Beyond the Klingons is a cave that is sheltering a large rockfall. Behind the rockfall is a large door.

"AMIGA VERDICT Interplay has got the atmosphere of this game just right. The characters have all the mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of their TV counterparts and everything just feels right, from the sound effects to the Captain's Log. Where the game suffers is the layout of each episode. This may just be the criticism of an avid Trekkie, bu when it comes to space combat, it was nevel as trivial in the show as it seems to be here This side of the game lets the rest of the prod uct down. Aside from that ST:25A is very good indeed. AOMIRAL THE ENTERPRISE IS BED TO TRAVEL SITO . THE NATIVE PROS: It's Star Trek! And if you're an avid Trekkie you will love the licence. ORMS HAVE BEEN Now this guy is the admiral, he even tells Kirk what to do. CONS: Moves a touch slowly and the gameplay has a repetitive nature. PAUL Andrex, just the thing for nasty Klingons photon torpedoes where possible. Throughout the battle you can use your bridge crew to add to the excitement by asking, let's say, Scotty to give you more power to the shields, or by getting Chekov to raise and lower shields. Never have their characters been explored so deeply (sarcasm folks, a handy tool at the best of times). Slightly jerky in places but on the whole impressive. GRAPHICS McCoy) really shine through (Kirk even crouches down, lowers his head, clenches his fist and grits his teeth when a red shirt' dies brilliant). Using a point 'n' click interface you control any member of the party as you explore the different environments, unravelling the plot. This is where you'll find the true Trek nature coming out, from the appearance of Harry Mudd (who is a regular nemesis of Kirk and Co) to the incomprehensible techy-speak of Mr Spock. About the only thing, that is missing is a shapely alien female that asks Kirk \"What is this thing you call kissing?\". You'll be humming the theme tune for weeks. Incidental sound effects are spot-on. 'The away team The Sierra/LucasArts/any other adventure manufacturer section is where the game really comes into its own and is where the characters of the 'Big Three' (Kirk, Spock and «So where are they?\", you're asking, \"Where's who?\", we reply. \"The intergalactic headbutting champions, that's who,\" you mutter. Relax folks, the Klingons abound in ST:25A, even cropping up in stories they're not actually in (I'll let you figure that one out). And it's not just the Klingons. Those Vulcan spinoffs the Romulans make the odd appearance, being dark and mysterious as only they know how The thing about these two is that space combat becomes a much trickier affair thanks to their cloaking device technology. As if it wasn't already hard enough to shoot the bad guys, now you can't even see them half the time. You can almost see Captain Kirk do a futuristic «DOH!\" whenever they appear (maybe not I just wanted to be the first person to link Star Trek with The Simpsons in a magazine. Hi thank yaw).

"REVIEW SNES by JVC .99 Out December. Contact JVC (081-570 5016) for more information The force is with JVC in This Star Wars sequel! TYTAUS SEPSED 53323 RIKES B You won't find any snowmen here, just Luke, his Taun Taun and some unfriendly wildlife. ig isn't a big enough word to describe the Star Wars trilogy. Gargantuan comes close but there is nothing in the history of cinema science fiction which can touch it. Now comes the latest, and potentially the greatest, game of the films. Empire Strikes Back picks up where the first game left off. The Death Star has been destroyed by Luke, and the Rebel Alliance has moved to a new base on the ice world Hoth. The Emperor is cheesed off at having his battle station destroyed by a squadron of puny fighters, so he's cancelled holiday leave for the Stormtroopers and instructed them to double their efforts in tracking down the new rebel base. It isn't long before they find it and that's where the game begins. meteor strike. From there he gets into trouble with the local ice beasts as well as imperial probe droids. If he survives and makes it back to the base he takes to a speeder bike to battle Stormtroopers, then into his Snow speeder to take on the AT-ATS in what is one of the highlights of the game. Excellent use is made of the SNES's mode-7 capabilities for the landscape and the Walker graphics are ace as they thud across the ice. MEET THE GUYS To see you, ice Super Empire Strikes lets you control three of the films main characters. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, but unlike Super Star Wars, you can't choose which character you want to play. Ice to see you Hoth is an unfriendly place. Level one kicks off with Luke riding his Taun Taun across the landscape to check out a From there, the characters go their separate ways. Han Solo and Chewie take on asteroids and TIE fighters after the Millennium Falcon's hyperdrive conks out. The next stop is Cloud City, where they run the gauntlet of imperial troopers and the resident guards. In the meantime, Luke has travelled to Dagobah, a smelly little planet which is home to Jedi Master, Yoda. The sound effects and graphics on this stage are amazing, making this another of the top spots of the game. Between each stage a short cutscene keeps you up to date on the plot, although this is only useful if you're one of the three people in the western world who hasn't seen the film. Variety is one of the game's strongest points. While the bulk of the action is platform based, it's nicely broken up by 3D sections and scrolling shoot-'em-up stages. Luke has a number of special powers at his disposal. These include freeze, which paralyses all the nasties on the screen; heal, which tops up his energy bar, while the deflection power lets him block enemy fire automatically. Thankfully, LucasArts has included passwords in SESB (unlike Super Star Wars), which is just as well, considering . how big the game is. Now all we need is Return Of The Jedi. Any takers? Mark Patterson HAN SOLO Occupation: Smuggler. Favourite colour: Day-glo pink. Hairstyle: 70's action hero crop. Favourite saying: Anything, as long as it ends with 'kid'. Realising that his favourite blaster is no longer powerful enough to face the Empire's new robots, Han (bonus trivia question anyone know what that's short for?) has picked up a job lot of grenades. These do far more damage than laser bolts, although he has to get close to his target to use them properly. preparation for this he's learned a new attack, in the form of a spinning lariat punch which is suspiciously similar to Zangief's in Streetfighter 2. But hey, what the hell. It works LUKE SKYWALKER VERDICT Occupation: Jedi Favourite colour: Black Hairstyle: Extended bowl Favourite saying: (screamed) 'You're not my father! Luke's been practising day and night at Jedi school which has made him a lot harder in this game. Whereas the light sabre wasn't really needed in the first game, it's his mainstay weapon in this one. Now he knows how to use it properly, it does more damage and can be used to deflect laser bolts. CHEWBACCA Occupation: Stunt double for Lassie. Favourite colour: Brown. Hairstyle: Long back and sides. Favourite saying: 'Growl'. Sporting a neat new hairstyle, Chewie is ready to take on the entire Empire single-handed. In Super Empire Strikes Back is destined to become a classic. It's got the lot. Superb graphics and sound, excellent gameplay, varied action and loads of levels. It beats Super Star Wars, which is one of my fave SNES games, hands-down and it's not as easy either. There are some awesome highlights such as the snow speeder stage and Dagobah. Technically excellent and utterly playable throughout, this is my personal game of the year and the one title l'd recommend to both of my friends. No Star Wars fan should be without it GARTH SUMPTER 58 "


"VERDICT SNES R Famicom AT-AT-ATTACK One of the trickiest parts of the game is downing the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the snow speeder stage. As they're impervious to laser fire, the only way to down them is by tangling their legs up with the speeder's tow rope. And here's how it's done. SED This is possibly the most action-packed SNES game this year. The graphics are so detailed.Best of all, the game packs in such variety, with a fluid Mode 7 racing stage and a Falcon space shoot-out. Thankfully, the difficulty curve has been yanked up way up. Additionally, you now start the game equipped with your Lightsabre which makes the game instantly attractive. My favourite addition is you can summon 'the force to command your Saber even when you're not holding it! Hey, I'm impressed. PROS: Some of the best platform action ever seen on SNES! CONS: A bit too close to the original in its gameplay approach. PAUL RAND Five AT-STs must be destroyed before you get to the AT-ATS. They take loads of hits to kill and the biggest danger comes from crashing into them. SADASPEED SEREN GRAPHICS Excellent animation and varied backdrops; will leave you gobsmacked. As you get in close, release the grappling rope, fly alongside the machine and catch its legs. SOUND A regular treat for the lugholes with brilliant effects and a stirring music score. Finally, when the rope is released, you can turn around and check out your handy work. When the AT-AT explodes it leaves behind loads of extra energy hearts, which come in very handy. Now comes the hard part. You need to fly around the AT-AT five times to tangle its legs, all the while trying to avoid crashing into it. GAMEPLAY Wealth of action which never lets up. It's a real gamer's game. When the AT-ATs finally appear, choose a target and head toward it low and fast. Even on the easiest setting it's a real challenge. Get it! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Can you survive an attack from the evil Empire? Cut-scenes are used to link the various levels together. LUKE SCORE SHRER FORCE NO-NWOOCO IIIIIIIIII MISS OK! HIT The cloud city is a dangerous place indeed. Robot guns, Cloud City guards and Stormtroopers lie in wait for Han. Luke tackles the giant swamp beast on Dagobah, using all his new-found powers to defeat it. 59 "


"MEGA-CD It couldn't have happened to a nicer CD. You ain't going to find no vector graphic trash in here, just real digitised graphics and stacks of action! by LUCASARTS/SEGA TBA PREVIEW REBEL ASSAULT RELEASE DATE TBA Stage of Development 85% Complete STAR SPOT Did you know at the end of the first film when the Death Star has been blown up, listen carefully to what Luke shouts as he climbs out of his X-wing. Instead of hollering Leia as the Princess bounds towards him, he shouts Carrie, which is very silly as that's the name of the actress and a particularly hot Indian dish. he PC has X-wing, the SNES now has Super Empire Strikes Back, and now it's time for Sega Mega-CD owners to brace themselves, because they are finally going to get a Star Wars game which could knock its cousins right out of the picture, once it's completed. Rebel Assault, from those gaming giants Lucasarts, is an all-action space combat simulation featuring all the Rebel Alliance's main fighters; from the A-wing to the awesome X-wing. Against you stands the massed might of the evil Empire who, with its larger fleet of fighters, is out to crush the rebellion, and you with it. Gulp! The best graphics yet seen on the Mega CD? Even these screen shots look awesome, but just wait till they move! Action stations The game is spread out over 15 levels, some are based on scenes from the Star Wars movies while others are completely original to the game. Unlike X-wing, which was basically a true simulation that featured as much work with the PC keyboard as the mouse, Rebel Assault is purely action led. The gameplay varies from an inside-the-cockpit view as you take on the Tie fighters in space, to external views as you steer your way through the rocky canyons on the planet Kolaador. Being a division of George Lucas' production company, Lucasfilm, Rebel Assault's programmers have had full access to use whatever footage, dialogue and effects they want from the movies. As a result the game has gratuitous amounts of film clips linking the scenes as well as volumes of speech, laser blasts, engine roars and explosions. This, along with Where the heck's he going? I'd follow but I don't know where the heck I'm going either! Arrggh! Who's that geezer? hope he's my co-pilot because I don't like ugly people. Time for the kill! It's not as easy as it looks because those mountains are tricky nicky. 60 "


"STAR SPOT During the original Star Wars, watch closely the scene where the stormtroopers burst in on R2-D2 and C3-PO when they're hiding out on the Death Star. The last one in is actually a specialist comedy stormtrooper who smacks his head on the doorframe rather than duck underneath it like all his mates do I love it when a plan comes together. I'm having a smashing time up here folks! Scenes like these are typical on the CD. They even move too! That Death Star looks a bit like a Pac Man to me. I best go in for a closer look. unlike anything you've ever seen before. All the power of the MegaCD's extra graphics chip has been been tapped to produce stunning sprite effects for enemy ships and explosions. STAR SPOT Science fiction buffs aren't often noted for their humour, and once more they demonstrate a lack of it here. When Chewbacca enters the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon in the first film look closely at the top of the screen and you'll see a pair of hi-tech fluffy dice hanging down. Oh how we laughed. Rebel Assault's graphics are out of this world, in fact they're out of this galaxy. Sega's Jurassic Park, promises to be one of the first CD games-of-the-film which will live up to hype surrounding CD-based licenses. X-wingers vs TIE no contest! Naturally there are stacks of TIE fighters to get to grips with when you pilot an X-wing. Fortunately for you, though, there's a real technology mismatch in your favour. Your fighter comes with high-power energy as standard, although the airbag's an optional extra, which can absorb several direct laser hits from the enemy. On the other hand, the TIE fighters come with a really puny deflector which buckles under the combined fire of your four guns. The manoeuvrability of the Xwing also comes into play on the asteroid stage. Here you're expected to fly through, at high speed, several billion tons of fragmented rock while blasting TIE fighters. That's tough, but it's not a patch on the next stage. When you've sufficiently sharpened your skills on the earlier stages, you get to take on the Death Star in a re-run of Star Wars. Everything is thrown at you here. Tie fighters, turbo lasers from the Death Star, and Darth Vader himself puts in an appearance, and that's before you enter the trench stage. CD champion Death on a stick The most impressive thing about the game is its graphics. It's set to become a landmark title in the world of CD gaming. The flying sequences are almost movie-quality, especially on the planet kolaador, where your piloting skills are tested to the full in a rocky maze. The scenery is quite STAR SPOT The Emperor may think he's the hardest thing in the galaxy, but his special Jedi powers didn't help him notice that, in Return Of The Jedi, as he leaves his shuttle and walks past his stormtroopers most of them were painted on to the backdrop and weren't real at all. Rebel Assault is set to be a landmark title on Mega-CD. The only down side is that there's no fixed UK release date as yet, although LucasArts is aiming for a US launch this Christmas. We'll keep you posted on the latest info as it happens. Loyal completa Completion does 1000 I OK, so I missed the last one, I'II get it this time though, just as long as my weapons are sorted did it, I did it. The fact that I filled my pants doesn't matter because I did it, so there. Nice shades mate. I bet you don't know the way to Southend from here though. It's all happening outside, but hey, I can handle it because I'm a hero remember. 61 "


"FEATURE STAR WARS MASTER SYSTEM BY: US GOLD QUE NOW SUPER STAR WARS ROUND-UP! Master System owners needn't feel left out as Star Wars mania hits the bigger machine as a conversion of the NES smash is just about to hit the shelves. While it lacks some of the speed of the NES original and the music's a might patchy, it does have all the levels along with the all-important gameplay. Take on the might of the Empire from the cockpit of an Xwing, battle the Jawas in your landspeeder and show the stormtroopers what for with Han Solo. Stars Wars the Master System game could be better, but as it stands it's much better than having no Star Wars game at all. The graphics are better than in the NES game, and it's every bit as absorbing. An essential purchase for Star Wars fans. There's no holding back with new Star Wars games. This Christmas is going to see more than ever, and with typical CVG pre-yuletide style, here's what you can expect to see. REBEL ASSAUD PC CD-ROM BY: US GOLD OUE DECEMBER You get to pilot the three TIE fighters which featured in the original X-wing. For the discerning pilot there's the traditional TIE attack craft, which makes up the bulk of the fleet. These are faster than X-wings although they carry less firepower! and much weaker shields. For the ultimate speed advantage, try the TIE Interceptor. This is the fastest ship in the game capable of outrunning, and outgunning almost every other craft. Finally there's the TIE bomber, a heavily armoured attack craft packed with proton torpedoes. TIE-Fighter is due out this Christmas as a standalone game and you can be sure we'll be bringing you the full review in the coming issue. anyone who gets in your way. The biggest threat this time around comes from the massed squadrons of TIE fighters. Apart from there being many more of them, the new manoeuvres the pilots have learned make them extremely difficult to shoot. Even the lumbering TIEbombers, or cannon fodder as they used to be known, are a lot harder to pin down and far more accurate with their shots. This is the perfect expansion disk for all the battle-hungry pilots who found destroying the Death Star far too easy first time around. The new missions require precise piloting and nerves of steel. Novices should steer clear though, if you couldn't complete the first set of missions you'll be swamped by these ones. Just a quick note to say that any PC CD-ROM owners who fancied a bit of Rebel Assault action will be able to get their hands on a copy of the game this Christmas. It's practically identical to the Mega-CD version previewed on the previous spread, but slightly faster with 256 colours on screen at once. The machine's capabilities are pushed to the limit to render the amazing characters and backgrounds, and it looks as though the action could top even X-wing. Watch this space for a full review soon. TIT X-WING MISSIONS B-WING PC BY: US GOLD QUE NOW PC BY: US GOLD OUE JANUARY TIE-FIGHTER PC BY: US GOLD QUE DECEMBER If you found X-wing a breeze, get your mitts on a copy of this. X-wing Missions is an expansion disk for the original game with 15 more tasks for you to complete. These are far tougher than the first batch with more to do and, as if that wasn't bad enough, the Empire's pilots have been back to school to take a refresher course in TIE Fighter piloting. As a result they're far more aggressive and much harder to hit. As an added bonus, this disk also ! allows you to play all the original missions in training mode. This means you can go straight to the Death Star battle, set your X-wing to infinite everything and blow the hell out of Think you've mastered the Alliance's best fighters? Think again! Hot off the production line comes their greatest fighter yet, the B-wing. It's fast, well armed and well armoured which makes it perfect for kamikaze runs against the Empire's massive star destroyers. This expansion disk is set to test the nerves of the most experienced fighters with all-new challenges and better enemy pilots. Because you're flying a completely different fighter new tactics are needed to combat the threat of the Empire. Great for X-wing novices and a test for veterans as well. Rookie One, Welcome to Kolaador. The soon to be released TIE fighter gives you the chance to view the rebels struggle from a different perspective, the cockpit of a TIE fighter! As an elite Empire TIE pilot you go one-on-one with the best the Alliance has to throw at you, including X-wings and giant cruisers. "

Well if you're a driver in this Lamborghini game, originally titled 'Lamborghini', you could well crash out because you are one of 19 contestants in a race across the USA.

While we are on the subject of damage, if you hit the car in front nothing happens! A few explosions, punctured tyres and a dramatic car spin wouldn't go amiss methinks. But this game does have a certain je ne sai quoi (which is French for bleedin' hell this is good Ed) that grasps your attention and won't let go for hours. Amanda Tipping ONNOS Big money The real fun starts on the Championship level where you can gamble on each race. The prize varies from $1,000 to $8,000 depending on the state you are in and which race you enter. Gamble wisely though, as you'll need to keep some money aside for any repair damage.

This timed target practice is a welcome break from sin ister stakeouts. One thing to be commended is the Lethal Enforcers graphics. As each baddy is shot, they dramatically throw down their weapons and keel over groaning in agony.

Graphics are faithful to the coin-op, but some are too grainy and provide unintentional camoflauge for baddies. If you're not a fan of the coin-op or Op Wolf-style games in general, steer clear.

Before he wakes up, he must track down his scattered work, or face being put back a year in school. sample from the series' soundtrack, which cuts off, then the game starts and you're dumped on the street level which links the dream sequences together. It's bad. Having red-hot spikes shoved up your jacksy is merely an unpleasant irritation by comparison. The object is to track down bits of Bart's homework which let him enter the sub-games. The graphics are rough in the extreme. The playability has also been lost up a rather dirty brown creak and features poor collision detection and a tedious repetitiveness which has the same effect as two-dozen Valium and a bottle of Jack Daniels. Dreamy Just when it seems like you've being ripped off, you start to find the dream levels and the game turns around completely. These sub-games feature the fire-breathing Bartzilla rampaging through Springfield, superhero Bartman going up, up and away to battle evil-doers, Bart as Indiana Jones and in all sorts of other guises. Not only are these playable, they're also different from each other. More stages surface as you track down bits of homework. This is a far better game than the terrible Bart vs The Space Mutants. However, what we at CVG really want to see is Homer Simpson, the game. After all, he's a not only a far more interesting character than young Bart, but he's an inspiration and role model for us all.

Pinball Fantasies on CD32 is not much different to the floppy version, but there are a few changes. For a start, it's in 256 colour mode.

"MEGA DRIVE by ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 Out November. Contact Electronic Arts (0753 549442) for information. Third time around for the fish with a mission, but can we steer clear of the fish jokes? Plaice your bets now... EIST OF EDAT Our brave hero starts his gruelling mission here. We're depending on you, Pond. ARFISH 12 PROCRES AREAS LLCARES ACOS RESTED SORPRENDER SHOPERATIVE AGTES DESTROYon moon buggies, mini rockets and giant moon worms Careful you don't slip into the secret slime pit. 4685. A's fishy hero James Pond is back with a vengeance in his latest secret mission, Operation Starfish on Mega Drive. Not content with life on Earth (well, the Atlantic to be precise) he's now been sent to the moon to thwart the plans of the evil Dr Maybe. Maybe has a dastardly plan to snatch up all the dairy produce in order to gain control of the world's ice cream market and only agent Pond can stop him. We all know the moon is made of cheese (I'll come back to that in a minute) and the salty secret agent has to scale down Maybe's menacing motives and battle against various aliens along the way, including very cute mice (hence the cheese told you I'd come back to that) of different sizes, some donning protective armour and hurling cheese cannons. Moonie Throughout the game James can pick up gold moons which give him additional points. He can climb trees in anti-gravity boots to get these moons, which can conceal energy boosts, so it is important to try and pick up as many of these as possible. Gravity can weigh him down and the poor little mite is prone to the odd panting, so use turbo to speed him along. James Pond 3 is a good catch and it's fun fathoming out the levels. Amanda Tipping Pick up these boulders and blast away those mice. GRAPHICS INDOS Cam and Bert As if our James hasn't enough to worry about, he then has to rescue and team up with three other FISH agents wandering about on the moon. Cosmic catastrophe!! Help is also on the way from the Captain who looks more at home selling fish fingers (Oh Cod, did I just read that? -Ed.) than offering advice to James at various stages, warning of danger zones and booby traps laid down by the Doctor. There are an impressive 111 levels, starting at the Garden of Edam and travelling through to Parmesan Plains, Camembert Canyon, Cheese Tower and Secret Slime Pit to name but a few (as if the fish puns weren't bad enough). The adventure doesn't really get going until you leave Edam though. One thing that must be commended is the map of the moon. You even get to choose which level you want to go to next, by travelling to the different towns. It's Cheddartastic! STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES The Phantom flinger chucks one of his specials in Custard Crater. 10 VERDICT That piscine hero strikes again! Robocod was always going to be a hard act to follow and, while Operation Starfish is a credible effort, it does have its flaws. The levels are a bit too barren for my liking there are times when there's nothing on-screen except James himself. The most annoying part of the game, though, is that you're put right to the start of the stage when you die, which becomes frustrating. Still, it looks pretty and the gameplay is challenging if more thought had gone into it, Operation Starfish could have been better. 0 COMO LLLLLLLLLLL MITTITUTI Arsenal James' weapons arsenal includes tea cups, rocks and spring-bottomed boots which give him a powerful boost to reach new heights in space. He is also armed with a fruit suit which enables him to roll on top of enemies to splat them. Further into the game he can make his getaways PAUL RAND 81 "

"REVIEWS Want a beat-'em-up that's not hyped to hell? Well you're in luck... COSMIC SPACEHEAD The crowd watched the pandamonium occurring in the ring. Adventure game meets platform game in combination shock! Cosmic takes a break from the adventure with a platform romp. 3. mive use USE lith all talk centering around Mortal Kombat and Streetfighter 2, Ocean has gone through the back door and sneaked out this little number. Ranma is best described as weird. It may look like a conventional beat 'em up but it's certainly out of the ordinary. Ocean's version of the game is different to the one which appeared on import. Many of the characters have been changed, new attacks added and backgrounds altered. The result is a game which is almost totally different to its predecessor. The fighters are a strange bunch (for example there's a woman armed with a cat and a giant panda. It sounds stupid, but it's this quirky action which puts it quite apart from the usual fighting games. Strip away the human and you find a game which steadfastly sticks with the traditional beat-'em up format. In a single-player game the aim is to give the other 11 fighters a good kicking. Quirky action is what makes this beat-'em-up stand out. Ranma certainly makes a change from the big name games. Although it certainly isn't a Streetfighter beater, it's still worth a look. Mark Patterson Strange cyclops are fairly common on Lino as are carpet tiles. control strange wind-up toys as they wander around a maze throwing pies at each other. Slap your opponent more times than he slaps you and you win. Simple. Paul Presley ONDOS GRAPHICS ONNOS GAMEPLAY GRAPHICS m este The planet Lino is where the adventure begins. ou know there's nothing worse than trying to prove your identity, except maybe trying to prove someone else's. Cosmic Spacehead has a larger problem though. Sent from the planet Linoleum to discover new life and all that, he returns claiming to have found Earth. Trouble is, no one believes him. There's nothing else for it, he's going to have to get back to Earth and get some pictures. Enter you, stage left... Two sides of the coin goes the saying and two sides to this game goes this review. Mr. S Head (make your own nicknames up) has to split his talents across two types of game adventure and platform. The adventure sections are the main ones, starting with El Cosmic on his home planet, trying to find some means of transportation back to Earth. He also has to find a camera as, once there, he'll have to work out what to take snaps of and how to get them back. Mini platform romps make up the sections leading from one adventure screen to another. Jumping over pits and drops and avoiding the hostile natives, the Cosmic one simply has to get from one side to the other. Once completed the section doesn't have to be replayed. While here you are able to pick up bonus lives and the like for use further in the game. GAMEPLAY 2 STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 6 3 Pavement fighter Considering the lengths the programmers have gone to to create original, funny characters, Ranma's stars are decidedly lacking in moves, which makes the game rather simple. Only three buttons are needed, one of which is block, so it only takes a game to learn all the moves of your adopted character. There are a few special attacks to learn, but these are simple joystick combinations which are easily mastered. ONWOOOOO POOLT MOV IIIIIIIII II 81 20 Pie slap A bonus game is included on the menu for two players. It's a simple variation on the classic old Tank game of Atari VCS fame.

"MEGA DRIVE by ACCLAIM .99 Out November. Contact Acclaim (071-344 5000) for information OLD TREE Alloys Taylor START GALLE PASSROAD Gomez is the main character. Acclaim releases a dated licence to give THE GAMES ROOM Sega owners a Mario-style game V eah, yeah, yeah they're ooky, and they're spooky, etc, etc, but isn't this conversion of the aging Super NES platformer just a little late? Perhaps, yes. For those of you who have had your heads stuck somewhere dark recently, The Addams Family was originally an Ocean licence which appeared for Pumpkin fun in the games room. Don't stare, it's rude. the Amiga, ST, and Super NES. Basically, Ocean was trying to perfect THE UNDERGROUND a Mario-style platformer and, to give them credit, they did so. Gomez takes the Mario-esque role as he scours his eight-wing house in search of his kidnapped family. Loosely based on the film's plot, ruthless property developers are planning to knock down Chez Addams in order to build a new development on the site. To force Gomez out, the property baddies have filled the house with all manner of deadly creatures and have locked away Morticia, Pugsley and co in separate wings of the building. Thus, using his devastat$ * ing bum-bounce power (a key aspect He's in the money. in the film, I'm sure you'll agree), Gomez explores the scrolling play area and defeats bosses in a search for his kin. THAT'S USEFUL As Gomez scours the house in search of his family, coins line the route and prove very useful indeed. 25 will replenish one of Gomez's two energy hearts, while collecting 100 bestows an extra life upon the moustachioed one. Similarly, other goodies awaiting collection include a sword and ball which can be used to kill off any oncoming nasties; a pair of trainers to speed him up and a Fezcopter which endows him with the ability to fly. R GRAPHICS ONDOS GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES VERDICT 10 Sega's Mario? Fans of Mario will feel instantly at home with The Addams Family, as it features all the coin-collection and power-up escapades which have eluded Mega Drive owners for so long. There isn't really a Mario clone for the Sega, so it's a fairly shrewd move by Acclaim to snap this up but I can't but feel it's a case of too little, too late. Ocean's SNES version of Addams Family was a bit of alright, but that was some time ago now. In terms of graphics and sound, Acclaim's Addams Family on Mega Drive is great. The backdrops are detailed with pictures adorning the walls in the hallways and neat little touches such as bear-skin rugs and suits of armour used as hazards however, when compared to more recent releases including Pond 3 and the Sonic games, it comes across as a little dated. Perhaps it might have been an idea to convert the sequel, Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt, instead? Still, The Addams Family is an enjoyable little romp and there's no doubting that it is very playable indeed it's just not enough in these days of advanced platformers, though.

"TV MEGA DRIVE by SEGA Out October. Contact Sega (071-373 3000) for info TBA 21 CORE 5200 IME 0-09 08 INGS 9 Sonic the Hedgehog has made it on to CD! It's bigger, but is it better? Doesn't ever get dizay, SCORE 9809. TIME 0-27480 RINGS ny plot which uses time travel will get confusing. So why use it? Well, It's a way of giving the same old things a new lease of life. As such Sonic CD is basically an upgrade. The story goes that Doctor Robotnik has created a time machine to travel around a bit and taken over control of seven zones in Sonic land (Moebius), You have to claim them back. THE HEDGEHOG Robotnik is about to lenrip. TIME 020-44 RINGS The new bits You're just dying to see those extra levels eh? Well, here's a brief glimpse of what to expect in each zone. Time travel The new angle with Sonic CD is each of the seven zones comprises three stages past, present and future. Among these Sonic will find posts marked out for one of these periods of time. The good part is that Sonic can affect the future by his activities in the past, so if something doesn't seem right in a future stage then you can probably find a cause in the past. Although time travel isn't necessary, it will alter the ending. IMM Collision Chaos This one's fast and crazy and very similar to the soon to be launched Sonic Spinball.. Tidal Tempest. Half of this level is submerged in water and a bit confusing to get around. A bit slow too. & INNOS | GRAPHICS Bil of fluff As Sega's main bit of fluff, Sonic has had a couple of enhancements: he has a new spin-dash, and a new sequence when launching off a spring-board, but best of all, he's even faster! To show off his new features, Sonic's terrain has been crammed with all those loopy loops and burrows which made the character famous. You soon discover there are masses of secret rooms too, loaded with power-ups and collectables. Some new stuff includes vertical launch ramps, spinning turrets and Amy Rose who's Sonic's kidnapped girlie (yuk!). 1 There are 35 dance tracks, from the likes of 2Unlimited and izata But get this, Sonic still has another surprise in store: Metal Sonic is a new creation of Robotnik, and a vastly enhanced Mecha Sonic from Sonic 2. Annoyingly, Metal Sonic is almost as fast as Sonic and will electrify himself whenever Sonic gets near, making him a real stubborn cretin. Although Metal Sonic is confined to the final stages, it's worth seeing. Of course, after all that running Sonic could just take off his shoes and give old Metal Sonic a whiff of his stinky toes. Then STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES again, that would be too evil. Deniz Ahmet GAMEPLAY VERDICT SPX Wacky Workbench. Set in a factory, the floor is charged with electricity. Touch it and Sonic goes flying. Lots of pipes make getting round easy, and a super fast level! Metallic CO 2 Madness SAR Near the end Sonic finally gets to meet Metal Sonic AND Robotnik Sega's flagship icon has almost come up trumps on this shiny format. It's been enhanced in every department, with the time travel element adding depth that was missing from earlier games. As it stands, Sonic fans will not be disappointed. It hasn't really used the potential of CD-ROM because most of the storage space has been consumed by the audio tracks. The game is a lot bigger, but it is still possible to whoosh through many levels almost unintentionally, particularly as you don't need to bother with the time travel element.

RUN BX *ess GAMEPLAY VALUE YARD 2 he alternative to John Madden is Bill Walsh, college football coach genius and front man of EA's new sport sim. It looks similar, but it isn't actually a Madden game. Despite a similar control system, and near identical options screen, it is very different. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES PArican Your host for the day. Statistics are his thing. Interesting guy. Sack the quarterback and the crowd go absolutely mad. Go four it But aren't college football and the professional game the same? Well if you're a Brit yes, but if you're an American no. This is the second game in so many months which works with EA's four-way adaptor. Slap it in and you and your pals can gang up against the computer, or have three against one. Alternatively you could go two aside, but this isn't half as much fun. The game gets complicated when you try to outwit the other team. Instead of merely calling plays, you can rig-up dummy formations to confuse them. There are also audibles, which allow you to change to one of five different plays when your team are actually on the pitch. These features aren't necessary since the computer can usually be beaten using joypad skills instead of subtle tactics. College Football is a good game in its own right, but whether you've got a four-way play adaptor or not, check out the Madden's review on page 53 it's the better game.

Only a few elite space pilots stand between them and total victory, and as it happens you're one of them.

STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES The secret's out Once you are briefed it's straight into your fighter and out into space. It's here you realise the 'secret' was that this isn't even a souped-up version of the first game. The action's the same, only your orders have changed. The aim is still to kick butt while protecting convoys and keeping an eye on your wingman. Before each mission you're dumped in the bar where you chat to the game's characters about recent events. If you don't protect them during a battle though, you'll find they start dying out, which makes drinking a lonely passtime. Apart from that, it doesn't matter how many of these buy it during the course of the game, as long as you're still flight worthy the game continues. In the transition from PC to console, Wing Commander's playability and atmosphere have vanished leaving a sub-standard cartridge. Sadly there's no in-depth simulation here, simply point and fire.

Don't play this game then Not much grip on the sand, so this is a slowish course. LAP 145 19TH Drive with care or it's crash and burn time. his is the sequel to the first SNES game ever which managed to offer smooth high speed racing without employing Mode 7 graphics. Although this aspect has been shunted over to the sequel, the graphics engine has been bumped up a gear or two in the process, improving the illusion of speed. VERDICT ting to the top of the field without a new engine is by using your nitro turbos at the starting grid to gain a significant lead, and basically holding on to that position for dear life. The delights of a new course will not be experienced if you fail to qualify. And to qualify you have to make your way in to the top 10. A racing game with no Mode 7 graphics! Sounds about as much fun as a traffic jam on the M25. Luckily, Kemco has provided the smoothest and most nippiest graphics yet seen in a nonMode 7 racing game. The problem is though that every other car seems faster than yours And to get a more powerful engine you have to win heaps of races, and you can only do this by using your turbos at the starting grid before the cars have a chance to overtake but hey that's cheating. On the whole it's smashing stuff so don't lose the ignition key! PAUL RAND It's top Top Gear 2 is an 8 Mb cart, and by doubling the memory an entire back seat of features has been added to the game. What's immediately noticeable is the revamped graphics a vast improvement on the almost cartoonish style of the original game. Thankfully Top Gear 2 now offers you full-screen racing in single-player mode, so you can fully marvel at those detailed backdrops. Two-player games are slapped into the usual split screen mode, but thankfully this doesn't drastically affect the speed of your car. There's also an all-new ! car damage indicator; this means that if you hurtle round the course like a trapped buggie, or if you simply don't know your left from your right, then sadly your racing performance will be lowered to the tragic 'Game Over' stage. While you scorch along the various courses, you can take in the scenery of the 64 cities throughout the 16 countries which you pass through. (Good news considering the distinct lack of tracks in Top Gear). Each one offers a different length of course and a different number of laps required to hit the chequered flag. As if that's not taxing enough you'll also have to navigate your motor through some pretty awful weather: rain, snow and fog will each demand a more careful approach to your driving Get the gear The way to get the edge on your fellow Top Gearers is to load-up your car with the goodies that are available at the garage before the levels. Providing you've earned specific quantities of dosh by qualifying in a high race position, you can drive away with a new engine, gearbox, tyres, armoury, or even a lairy paintjob! With three difficulty settings, this game should hold your attention until the next driving game comes along It's all a bit of mad fun really. If you plan on using this game in preparation for your driving test, that's fine just don't forget to make funeral preparations in advance! 02 When you need to win a race you can't afford to be polite.

Yes, more inflated pig's bladder-style antics on your Amiga courtesy of top scorers Ocean. Specify! Z CUNHL COM EXIT t's not as if anyone's suffering for the lack of football games on the Amiga, but Ocean has decided that it's time for another. European Championship is very much a strategy orientated game, featuring 18 teams each from England, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Each of the 90 clubs boasts the real life squad, with each member rated for speed, fitness, tackling and agility. The game looks like Kick Off, with a top-down, fairly close-up view that necessitates a radar to prevent disorientation. The tactics screen is marvellous; the pitch is divided into 16 zones so that when the ball is in a particular zone your team has two preprogrammed formations (defence and attack). Hence you can specify the position of your players when the ball is in any of 16 different parts of the pitch. It's immensely powerful and difficult to master unless you're a footie genius. No, not G Taylor's patchwork quilt but the fabbo tactics screen. Lovely European Championship has got piece of many of the options you would sod, expect from a footie sim; you can eh? play a league or cup, dip in with a Makes friendly, or even just knock the ball it all about in practice.

MAIN MENU The control system is quite complicated compared to most; when your player has the ball, hold down the fire button and an aiming cursor appears which can be moved around the pitch. Let go of fire and the ball should get booted off to that spot. It's potentially a very powerful system of ball control, but it's not exactly easy to pick up and somehow it seems a bit messy, and not in the spirit of footie.

European Championship is the opposite of Sensible Soccer. It's almost as if Ocean realised it couldn't compete with this title so decided to go another way. Euro Champ's control system doesn't feel like a footie game, however the powerful tactics screen and the team editor and all those skill ratings make it brilliant for real football lovers. It's spoilt by some terrible sound samples though, and the players' inertia is bad when challenging an opponent or picking up a loose bal extremely hard.

"MEGA DRIVE \" by PSYGNOSIS .99 OUT: October. Contact Psygnosis (051-709 5755 ) for information. BSACW This is Puggsy's world. Top-left is a Mario-style route map. Puggsy is fab at balancing objects, but can he see ahead? He's cute, he's puzzley, and he looks like a pug (well two outta three ain't bad) blow one up at a certain stage and discover that you float to a secret level! uggsy's crash landed on an undocumented planet, and lost his ship. Little does he know that while searching for his ship he will have to wobble his butt across five climatic scenes. Puggsy is a cute sort of chap and this is reflected in his abilities. His skills are all to do with logical thinking and the design of the first few levels help you become accustomed to the ways in which different objects in the game interact with each other. Puggs Bunny Remember all objects in the game use real physics. Many problems will often be dependent on a key object, so to aid you in finding the correct item look for a help chest. These contain hologram clues of the necessary item for that puzzle. Out to hinder your progress is a typical assortment of naff creatures, but none of them seem to have any intelligence, so they're just another obstacle for Puggsy to wobble through. If you can live with a central character who isn't straight out of machoville then there is little reason to avoid what must be Psygnosis' best action puzzle game yet. Deniz Ahmet Puggsy is a might weak for an alien. He'll die with one hit! PUG POWER Let's face it, Puggsy IS feeble for an alien so check out our guide to the more useful pick-ups in the game. The rest are for you to find out! Perhaps if Puggsy found an object he could reach that platform. Puggsy Malone To begin with the tasks are simple, such as placing objects on top of each other to allow you to reach higher platforms. Ingeniously, Puggsy can avoid this hassle by using small items to cling on to higher ledges and pull himself up. Gradually the puzzles become more taxing. Some will require various moves to complete. For example, you may have to drop an object to activate a switch, then run to the other side of a level while gathering other objects and then balancing them all on top of This weapon is limited but great for baddies and climbing on to ledges with GRAPHICS 91 ONNOS 14 each other to reach the exit and that's an easy one! Apart from the usual scoring system, Puggsy can top up his score at the end of each level depending on what he's carrying when he passes through the exit. One thing to bear in mind throughout is that every object has a use. Balloons for example, will appear to have no use, until you Um, you'd be very surprised if this wasn't an extra life! Luckily though, it is GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Puggsy's shades provide an extra hit point. He loses them if hit, but it's better than a lost life! VERDICT There is heaps to do in each level of Puggsy, but in most cases you don't need to bother since it's not essential to completing the level. It's a nice idea that players should want to go back over levels to explore them fully, but the motivation for games is to get to the next level, and the quicker the better. That aside, Puggsy is a wonderful example of solid gameplay. It's easy to get in to and the difficulty curve leaves room to breathe. You can tell that it's been programmed from the inside out, with the visual element being complimentary to the action. With these on his feet Puggsy can double his speed and jump large distances. As with the shades, these can be lost. ONWAGON IIIIIIII MINUTI These give extra momentum for Puggsy so as he can move past strong winds. PAUL RAND 95 "

"MEGA DRIVE by KONAMI .99 Out late November. Contact Konami (081-429 2446) for information APRIL SPEED POKER 4 NICHAELANGELO SPEED 4 POWER 4 Turtally terrific tournament action blasts its way on to the SNES! This guy is very close to becoming sliced into turtle fodder. Everyone just fades to grey when compared to Michaelangelo. fter starring in a string of walk along beat-'em-ups the Turtles are currently having a bit of a change of direction: Konami's latest Turtle game does away with all that boring legwork and gets down to the real nitty gritty of gameplay. It's a rat trap Lawks a Lordy, Splinter's been ratnapped and the Turtles have to win a fight fest in Dimension X to get him back. The stage is all set for a two player one-on-one beat-'em-up starring your fave Turtles and all their chums. You get to pick any of the is ours, nou!! Not having any legs means Krang can't take part. heroes in a half shell or any of their four friends, Casey Jones, Ray Fillet, April, or Sisyphus. Your opponent, a friend or the Mega Drive, picks one of the others (or even the evil twin of the same one). As you'd expect each character has their own ratings for speed and power and their own moves; everyone has a number of punches and kicks and there are also projectile attacks, dive attacks, blocks and throws. If backgrounds are your bag, there are eight planets to fight on so you can admire a variety of backdrops while you're kicking seven shades out of your opponent. and a decent size. A bit more could have been done with the scenery though, and a couple more moves wouldn't go amiss, but it doesn't detract from the game's playability. Despite being an above average kind of beat-'em-up, there's nothing here which makes Tournament Fighters a serious contender when put up against Streetfighter, although it does make a pleasant change from the norm. Love the yellow boots, but not too sure about that pose. GRAPHICS ONNOS YOU LOSE Shell shocked All three buttons are used to execute the standard moves, some of which look extremely vicious. These pale into insignificance, though, when compared to the rock-hard special moves. Get the right combination of finger-straining D-pad wizardry and attack buttons and your fighter will execute a devastating strike unique to them. Leonardo, for instance, spins round at ultra-high speed slicing his way through the other fighter, while Casey Jones drops a time bomb which does as much damage to him as the other person. The graphics are well animated GAMEPLAY VALUE I'm a Nineties kind of turtle, I can handle being beaten by a girl. STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES He may only be an insect, but hey, he's got more arms than me! CORRMINI VERDICT TEENAGE NUTANT NINJA Beat-'em-ups come into their own when you play them in two player mode and this one does fairly well on that front. This is mainly thanks to the brilliant taunt facility. At the press of a button your fighter breaks off from the frey o insult the opposition. Each has their own digitised taunt April's is: 'Have a go if you think your hard enough'. It's brilliant. Aside from that it's fairly standard, and it looks shabby compared to SF2; the sprites are not as big, the animation seems rougher and there aren't as many moves.

"REVIEWS OK wrestling fans, more panto-style rumblings from the WWF fighters' CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THE AVENGERS A right royal rumble in the ring as the WWF stars slug it out. Aficionados will marvel at the licence, but is it any good or what? in-game speech; the colours are brilliant and everyone stands in those ridiculous superhero 'poker-up-thejacksie' poses. However if you're not in to Marvel Comics you may find the game doesn't appeal, since the main attraction is possibly the licence. The animation's jerky, there aren't enough moves, and the terrible plot updates break up the flow. Only the two-play. er simultaneous option mode saves it from being useless, because then at least you get bored together. Martin Pond Hawkeye is the man with the arrows he's about to score 180. IRS brings his well-dressed wrestling to the Mega Drive. EUR Imost identical to the Mega Drive version, this is a sideways-scrolling beat-'em-up in a pseudo 3D vein (à la Final Fight) with the occasional fly along and shoot'em-up section. The Avengers of the title are a bunch of do-gooders who have sworn to crush arch baddie Red Skull and his gang of super villains. 'Rules were made to be broken' seems to be the WWF motto. Vision is good at throwing his (and other peep's) weight around. t's time for another bout of fat, sweaty men pretending to hit one another in this spin off from WWF Royal Rumble. Programmed by Acclaim development stalwarts Flying Edge, the game takes you to WWF's annual free-for-all. Here the top names compete in a match where the only way out is over the rope. Also featured are one-on-one matches and double and triple tagteams, but Royal Rumble is the best. ONDOS GRAPHICS ONDOS GAMEPLAY GRAPHICS GAMEPLAY STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Vengeful men You can play one of the four Avengers or Captain America, depending on which special power you prefer: Vision the Android fires laser bolts from his forehead; Hawkeye is an expert archer; Iron Man fires a death ray from his hands and ole Cap'n Stars-and-Stripes himself can throw his shield like a frisbee. To see off an opponent each character fires his own projectile weapon or resorts to the more traditional knuckle sandwich. The normal run of things is a) walk along b) stop while a bunch of baddies swarm on to the screen c) get knocked down a lot while trying to crush your adversaries and d) walk a long a bit more. The game captures the atmosphere of the comic well; it's full of cheesy dialogue and over-the-top STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES 8 New hulks in town Does it shape up against the SNES version though? Well the graphics aren't quite as good, but they are identical when it comes to playability. In fact, the biggest difference is the wrestlers. Out go Yokozuna, Ted Dibiase and Ric Flair, in come IRS, Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Hulk Hogan. Each wrestler has an array of slams, throws and gouges plus their own signature move. To compensate for the Mega Drive joypad's lack of buttons, combinations are used. This doesn't always work, since hitting B and C together at high speed for a suplex often ends up with just one button being hit at a critical moment leading to a less damaging head butt. The mass bundle is ace, though some graphics tend to break up when the screen is busy. There are plenty of moves to master and three championships up for grabs. Good fun all the way for WWF fans.

"REVIEWS he gets the odd power-up, like the wriggly worm thing that spins around him like a shield. Out November: Contact Mindscape (0444 246333) The finger lickin' good platform star hits the NES; take it away... GRAPHICS A What's it all about? The game's fast paced with regular restart points, a nice bit of variation in gameplay with some interspersed underwater sections, and a vertically scrolling collect-'em-up for the interlevel bonus game. Alfred is brilliantly animated from his pecking action to his spectacular deaths, exploding in a shower of feathers or getting roasted like a Sunday lunch. The puzzles are absorbing enough, and it's all very tongue in beak. Good value all round. Martin Pond os B EmC@LEO A STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES B Peck that balloon with your trusty beak and restart here. fter his appearance on the Game Boy, Alfred Chicken has arrived on the NES. He's one of those humorous platform characters, though his game is more puzzley than most. Each level is full of monsters and an assortment of platforms; certain special platforms appear and disappear with the peck of a switch, while the motorised platforms run in a fixed track, however sometimes you have to start them by pecking a block out of the way. Obviously your average chicken is not a big aviator, so Alfred can only jump about, but he can manage a fair distance if he flaps his wings as he glides. To dispatch an enemy Alfred has to dive bomb his target, screeching earthward with his beak of death at the ready, or sometimes ICREDBUBOWE M U ONWAUONO IIIIIIIIIII UC Alfred winced at the chaffing from his Paxo suppository. The puzzles are tricky, but nothing very Krypton Factor-like. SNES by MINDSCAPE .99 CHAMPIONS Out October: Contact Mindscape (0444 246333) the list goes on. Most games can be played against up to seven other human opponents and a tournament mode pits you against computer players of different abilities. You can take shots again if you fluff them, and the replay mode lets you study the outcome in slo-mo great for trick shots when you're hustling. Martin Pond hear of Mindscape's arcade-style Championship Pool. Mindscape must've had a misspent youth programming Pool GAMEPLAY GRAPHICS 86 85 STRATEGY SKILL ACTION REFLEXES Here's where the white gets chipped into someone's crotch. Phantom balls There are three viewpoints: a plan view of the table, a close-up and a 3D angled view. The control system uses a 'phantom ball' effect to demonstrate where your shot will go, and the more phantom balls shooting out the faster your shot will go. There are four difficulty levels. On hard 'Fast Eddy' mode you have to rely on your own nouse to work out the outcome of the collision, while in 'Mummy's Boy' mode there are plenty of phantom balls to show you the exact outcome of any of your shots. You can play variations of pool: eight, nine, ten, and fifteen ball, Three Ball (potting three balls in the shortest number of shots) and One Pocket (only one pocket is used)... TITUITIUIT Put a bit of spin on it, take a run up and it might go down.

However, there is one problem all of the instructions are in Japanese so we've had a rather tricky time fathoming out what on earth is going on. But with the miracle of modern technology (well the fax machine) I can now reveal the plot behind this silly (I mean silly in its most positive connotation of course) story ADVENTURE 2 One of mad Max's mob confronts Buster. TIME 08 POINT 12/15 What's up doc? Buster takes a break from saving the cinema in a sub game. Buster Bunny and his mates are given free tickets to a new cinema built in their town by some mystery million aire, who, it transpires, turns out to be the wicked Montana Max. By some magical spell (which could only happen to one of the Toon characters), Buster is transported into the film itself, and begins his adventure to kill all off all the baddies, including Millionaire Montana himself, and win back the cinema for him and his friends. First stop in this Toony adventure is the Wild West. Here Buster has to pick up all the carrots he can lay his hands on. When he's collected a certain number he gains an extra life. All is not well for the happy-go-lucky bunny though, because he is being chased by a hungry wolf, flying buzzards and huge boulders rolling down cliffs. Then there's the castle in the Samurai section which is full of booby traps and there's a runaway horse to contend with. Phew! The last two stages find the bunny blasted off to space in a rock et to a futuristic city and finally he returns to earth and Franken (sic) castle where he chooses his own fate for the ending. Buster stops to admire portraits of his Toony pals in the hall of frame. Although this isn't a very challenging game, 'it is good fun, but I didn' have a clue what to do until I read up on the plot, Anyway, this is nearly as good as the SNES game the graphics are excellent however the sound can do your head in. Although there are only tour levels there are lots of sub levels to keep you occupied so it's worth forking out for. That's all folks! AMANDA TIPPING Two games in one In between each different level is a sub game, which unfortunately has got nothing to do with the storyline, but that doesn't matter because they are good fun. Once you are back in the real game, where the action flows, there's not a lot to complain about. Oh, and before I forget, there's a very cute little dog, Gogo Dodo, who leads you to a roulette table where you can gain extra lives, carrots, or even become invincible for a short time. Because the plot is so ridiculous it actually spoils the game, although the dinky animation and little ditties in the background provide some compensation. OVERALL LOOK SOUND 990 FEEL VALUE 101 "

If you've never heard of Taz before, then you must have been living in the desert or something. This crazy little feller originates from the old Bugs Bunny cartoons, when he was known as The Tasmanian Devil. But recently, he received his own cartoon show which is currently showing on the Saturday morning programme \"What's Up Doc\" and is actually a bit of a laugh.

Spin Dizzy Taz isn't a very intelligent creature in fact, he's quite thick but he does have one trick up his sleeve, and that's the ability to spin.

Unfortunately, he can't keep this up forever once his Spin-o-meter runs out Taz, erm, runs out of spin and must wait until the bar builds back up before he can twist again.

So what do you do? Finish your pizza or let it get cold and go find out what the problem is? Cowabunga, dudes, the decision is yours, but the game's cut rather short if you choose the I'm just gonna finish the pizza' option. LEONE Mmm, when you've seen one turtle, you've seen them all.

"CHEATO scaping from Jurassic Park is no mean feat I for either man or beast. But they didn't count on CVG giving you a helping hand! Armed with the knowledge printed in these hallowed pages, not even T-Rex himself can stop you doing a runner and getting back to civilisation in one piece. JURASSIC PARK VELOCIRAPTOR SURVIVAL GUIDE RAPTOR Firstly, don't worry about humans! You're a dinosaur who's almost impervious to damage, and that includes, rockets, grenades and tazers. These will only sap a small amount of energy. Do avoid water though, since this will put an end to your rampage regardless of how much energy you have a few extra weapons to be had in the rocks, but it's a dangerous place, so you're best off avoiding it totally. The tricerotops will leave you alone as long as you don't try and attack him. The compies are your worst nightmare. They may be small, but they sure sap a lot of energy. Use your tazer on them because it can be fired easily while you're crouched. It doesn't have to be powered up to stun such a small creature, so simply tap the attack button to use it.

The tazer is too awkward to charge, so save it for the smaller dinosaurs. Flash grenades are often the only things that can get you past Rex, so don't waste them when darts will do. One sneaky thing the programmers have done is stash the best bonuses and medical kits in hard-to-reach locations, don't even attempt to get to these. You'll only end up dying in a particularly nasty manner on the strategically placed spikes below. Take the opportunity to practice your dinosaur skills on the locals. The things to master are high jumps and leaping attacks. The only place where you're likely to lose a life is in the rocks, where there's a large and nasty swamp. To avoid it, run off the right-hand ledge above it. This will carry you clear of the swamp. Now all you need to do is jump right to the exit. POWER STATION THE JUNGLE GRANT GRANT There's no real challenge in the first half of this level, so take it easy and stock up on weapons. Blue darts are fine for small dinosaurs like the compies, and dilophosaurs which take two hits, but you really want to stock up on red darts. There are Somehow the raptors have found their way into the power station, so keep your red darts ready as they can drop on you at any time. What's worse. the guys who installed the cabling were a right bunch of Cowboys so keep an eye out for short circuiting wires. There's no time limit, so alled the point 106 "


"THE FALLING DOWN WATER LEVEL 107 "


"VOLCANO CHEAT CHEAT JURASSIC PARK GRANT PUMPING STATION Whether you're Grant or Raptor, the danger here comes from falling in the swamp, so take it easy and time your jumps. there are plenty of ledges to grab on to if the poo starts to hit the fan. It's good ole lady luck that will come into play here, but don't think that you won't need plenty of skill also, because you will. Many of the platforms are actually off-screen, so you've got to leap and hope to God you make contact with something. The toughest part of this section is leaping across the lava pits at the bottom of the level. Accurate timing is necessary to clear these jumps. Push the D-pad in a diagonal as you leap to get even more distance. And watch out for those raptors! GRANT To complete this stage of the game you need to track down the switches to open doors and close all the steam valves. Your first task is simply to get to the other side of the swamp. The steam jets stop every 10 seconds, then start again after two. Your timing needs to be spot-on if you don't want to get burned. mum Run on to this platform. If you try and jump you'll crack your head on the pipe and plunge into the swamp. Climb up the passages as far as you can go then drop on to the dinosaur bones. The raptors seem to come from nowhere at this stage. Keep an eye out at all times because they have a nasty habit of knocking you off platforms and into the lava. The rocket launcher comes in particularly handy here. VISITORS' CENTRE GRANT RAPTOR To cross the chains, simply push right. You can't jump between them. RAPTOR From here climb down to the tube below then leap across the swamp. Climb all the way up, collect the rockets and the med-kit, then drop down again. Precision jumping is called for if you want to stay out of the slime. The tricky bit is leaping on to the platforms. Give yourself more time to get the landings right by high-jumping across You'll find yourself running desper The best tactic is to put your head ately short of weapons by this down and run. The guards shouldn't point, fortunately there are plenty trouble you if you leap at them. to be had behind the curtains. There's a particularly nasty bit halfway through where a raptor drops down from the ceiling. Due to bad programming you'll find that you can actually shoot through him. The only thing you can do is keep pumping the firebutton and hope that a shot or two connects. Shoot the box here to make it drop down. You only need to use a blue dart. For the rest of the level, keep the rocket launcher or red darts handy because you come up against every kind of dinosaur, including T-rex. CANYON T-REX TIPS Wait for the brachiosaur to raise its head again then jump on to it. Just before it drops into the swamp, leap right. Now cross the gap by swinging across the pipe. First off it's important to try and stock up on as many weapons as possible. There is also a pterandon buzzing around at the start of the stage, so shoot that down with a blue dart. Keep your rockets handy because there are simply loads of raptors around and to them the only thing you are good for is lunch. To get rid of the brachiosaur which stands between you and the rope, simply shoot it it's dino eat dino in this world you know. Just past there you'll find another raptor and a medical kit. Once you collect the supplies then the ground will collapse, taking you to the volcano. Be on the look out for Rex. Get too close to him and you'll be his first course. Flash grenades can distract him for a short while, but that is only a short while. As soon as it goes off sprint past him and chuck another one for good measure. And remember, he's got a long reach. He'll roar if your weapon has an effect, which signals that you should run past him without hanging around to see what happens. Give the wheel a shove, but don't follow it down. Wait for it to stop moving then proceed. 108 "

"CHEATO DE LEVELS ONE AND TWO If the Harkonens in Dune II on the Amiga are kicking sand in your face, then get your own back with the aid of these tips REFINERIES Listen to what your mentat has to tell you before you start a level. Most of their information can be ignored, but occasionally they've got some excellent gossip on the rival houses and what type of weapons the houses ore armed with The enemy becomes aware of your presence and begins attacking only after it has encountered your first unit. Hence only send units as far as the first spice field and then send off a harvester. On level two it's worth building two refineries to speed production. Keep your units close to base too, you may remain undetected. Deploy your forces to give you the maximum defensive coverage around your base. Attacks can often come from behind so station a few infantry units to the back of your installation. Has FOX The Battle of Arrakis Tips for DUNE II DE Don't limit yourself to one spice refinery. The more you have the quicker you'll complete the level, plus you're covered if one gets damaged. GENERAL HINTS AND TIPS MAIN GAME LEVEL THREE ONWARDS HOT KEYS Try and learn what the hot keys are and use them you'll find that it's much quicker in battle. Don't get too cocky, try and save the game after winning a large battle or if you've managed to survive a missile attack. Remember to check the spice refinery after deploying your harvester. If it's too far from the nearest field the harvester won't detect anything and will just sit idly by the refinery, so you'll have to order it to move. Always try and build on concrete since it reduces the need for subsequent repair. Beyond level two you should always build three or four refineries. The faster production rate allows rapid growth. Post units all around your base. The enemy usually attacks from one direction at a time but remember that may be from behind. Always build an outpost when the option arises. It's easier to keep track of everything, and the scanner screen makes moving units long distances less of a hassle. Remember to try and upgrade installations when you can because it allows you to build better units in the long run. Only 100 per cent repaired installations get an upgrade option. Some installations can only be built if you've already got the more basic model. So, for example, you can only build a heavy vehicle plant if you already own the light one.

"SWINGIN STOOLID num CGO mfintlig Hud! nslig Hud! Her kan on! Sart Hud! SPANISH GEEK Dear YOB, You're so sexy that you could knock Claudia Schiffer (CENSORED YOB) constipated hippopotamus. Here are some questions: 1. Is Road Avenger for the Mega Drive worth buying? 2. Are there any good Mega-CD games? 3. What is the Mode button on the Mega Drive six-button control pad for? 4. Tell me the trick to have blood and gore on SNES Mortal Kombat. 5. In a sad American mag I heard that Fatal Fury 2 and King of the Monsters are coming out on SNES. As you are my most reliable source, is this true? TOM JIMENEZ Malaga, Spain A RAAAAAAAP! Welcome to a special edition of the brightest letters page in the known world Yob's International Mailbag. This month your hilarious host has decided to extend his fist of friendship across the Seven Seas, devoting his entire slot to those sad foreign types whose insignificant scribblings know no bounds. These are a few of the diplomatic disasters winging their way through the skies to waste more of my time, sent packing with my customary panache and charm. If you reckon you can match my wit and wisdom, battery charge your brain and fire off those little losers to: AT LEAST I WORKED OUT HOW TO LICK THE STAMP, YOB'S BOTTOMBLOWINGLY BRILLIANT MAILBAG, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON EC1 3AU. Remember, there's a mindnumbing 100 POUNDS for the best letter of the lot and a kick up the bum for the rest. YOB: 1. It's almost as bad as a Frenchman's fart. 2. Silpheed. Final Fight is arcade perfect but starting to look dated now. Look, let's it: the Mega CD is a dodo and its software is less interesting than the contents of a Dutchman's bowels. 3. It's for use on Streetfighter. Press this button and Spanish matador Vega is replaced by a better character while his sad homeland of Spain is transformed into somewhere worthwhile. 4. Contrary to popular belief, there is a cheat to restore the gore on SNES Mortal Kombat. In two-player mode, select any character and lose the first round. Begin round two as normal. Just as your opponent is about to win, drop the joypad, yell 'Virtual reality, sucker!' and smack him in the eye. If you've timed it right a brilliant scrap should ensue, but just make sure it's not you who goes off crying because you are Spanish after all. 5. Y-up. 114 "

If you do not fancy it could you suggest a sensible price I could flog it for? On the other hand, give me a ring on 999, ask for Fire Service and I'll get back to you as quickly as possible 3. Please could you tell my friend that Starwing is crap? 4. Please could you tell me how to control M Bison and all the other bosses on Pac Man? 5. Can you send me about  so I can buy Mortal Kombat? 6. What's your favourite flower? 7. Why is SF Turbo so crap? 8. How often do you clean your teeth? 9. Who's your favourite turtle? BERTIE TOLHURST Llanfairpwllgwngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysliogogogocc, Wales TINGS! CRIVVENS! HELP MA BOAB! THE PRICE OF MEGA DRIVE C-DS! A DISGRACE! LAND OF THE GRAVE Dear YOB, I am writing to complain about the ever increasing number of consoles being released. It seems every time I pick up a magazine or turn on the television some company is advertising a new console. Since everyone wants to own the hottest bit of gear around, how can the major compaKGEE nies expect people to fork out large sums of cash before hooking it up to their televisions every month? Only a few months ago everyone was stunned at the Mega CD's capabilities. Now, however, this is like a toy in comparison to the forthcoming CD32 and 3DO. Many .. people paid good money to bolt the Mega CD to their humble Mega Drive (no they didn't YOB) but I bet most are still wondering whether their cash was wisely spent. Only a few more weeks wait and they could have owned a CD32 for around the same price. Need I say more? As for the 32-bit Saturn, Sega shouldn't even consider manufacturing it as the big 64-bits are set to steal the show. The Atari Jaguar and newly announced Nintendo 64-bit shall knock out all other 32-bit competition. After all, who wants to own a 32-bit when they can have a 64-bit at around the same price or maybe even cheaper? I guess this means no Super CD after all. At this rate I'll never make up my mind on what to buy... KENNY MURRAY Glasgow, Scotland W L. 00 JOCK TIGH YOB: 1. Oh dear. 2. Oh dear oh dear. 3. Would you tell your friend to give you the slapping you deserve? 4. Run a hotwire by-pass through the joypad, connect the red wire to your right ear, the blue wire to your left, whack up the voltage and hope the shock might make you funny. 5. Don't be silly. 6. The Peruvian Poison Man Trap I've got dozens at home. 7. Because you're a sad wimp and can't play it. 8. How do you do that, exactly? 9. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. POINTLESS PEOPLE, LOUSY LAMB Dear YOB, In the What Other Mags? question on your questionnaire you mentioned no PC or Amiga mags. I ended up having to write it out on paper. Go and kick their butts and tell them to get their act together. DAMIAN WHITLEY Auckland, New Zealand. YOB: How can you make up your mind when you so obviously don't have one? Hasn't it occurred to you that mags like CVG exist to help you make up your mind what to buy, and warn you when any new machine is a bit cacky. Take the Mega CD yours truly has been banging on for ages how bad it is and plenty of people took note. If you actually bothered to read the magazine rather than rant all day you might actually learn something. Well, I suppose there's a first time for everything... YOB: Lonely? Confused? Unfit for habitation in a sensible society? Contact the New Zealand embassy at your earliest convenience. HOT AND HORRIBLE RAMBA! who enero Dear YOB, I need a few questions answered now or I'm coming to get ya! 1. Is Dragon Ball Z coming out in English? 2. Is World Heroes 2 coming out on the SNES? 3. When will Streetfighter 2 Champion Edition be coming out on the SNES? 4. When will Final Fight 2 be coming out on the SNES? TIM BLANCHARD Mallorca, Spain. PS Print this letter or you know what will happen! 11 .00 web YOB: 1. Nope, but the sequel probably will and it's miles better anyway. 2. No plans yet. 3. It's already been superseded by Turbo, you moron. 4. It's already out in Japan and the States, but seeing as it's cack it may never get a European release. 115 "


"SNOW AND SADNESS A FLOATING TURD Dear YOB I think you're the best mag around. No joke. Could you please, please, please answer these questions without any jokes? 1. Which is best: Mega Drive or Super Nintendo? Or are they equal? 2. If (I mean if) Sonic 3 comes out will Sonique, Sonic's girlfriend, be introduced into it? 3. My friend Ben says Super Nintendo's the best because it's a 32-bit machine and the Mega Drive's only 16-bit. Is he right or wrong? 4. If I asked you, please, to design a Mega Drive version of Tuff E Nuff, would you? Please. 5. How many different Mega Drives and Mega-CDs are there going to be because I heard that there's a new Mega Mega Drive 2 and Mega CD 2? (My dog ripped issue 138. Could you please send it to me please?) 6. Is X-Men better than Tuff E Nuff. 7. Is Streetfighter 2 better than Tuff E Nuff? CHRISTIAN BORBON Victoria, Australia Dear YOB, I've heard and read of your most excellent help and guidance to lost souls in the world of video games. I have sent this letter not to be insulted but to give you the chance to show your power. Please answer these humble questions: 1. Is there any 'Short Cut' to demolishing Dran Dragor in the most excellent game Eye Of The Beholder 2? 2. Speaking of EOB2, what does the Wand Of Mystic Defence do apart from create some pink lines around my heroes? 3. How much do you take for a video film where you stand naked in a barrel of coffee eating rats while singing \"I like Nintendo and I feel great?\" 4. Do you like whale killing? 5. Could you triple the amount of cheat pages? 6. Could you give me the address to Garth? OWIND VALSTADSVE Skatval, Norway NB: If you make any jokes about my name I am going to run into your office and reprogram your computer with a very large axe. YOB: 1. Ever wondered why Norwegians are crap in the Olympics but always do well in the Eurovision Song Contest? 2. Well now you know. 3. Why should I bother? Judging by past performance, you'd make it Norway's next Euro entry. 4. Would you like my fist in your face? 5. I could. But I won't. 6. Certainly: Garth Sumpter, HM Prison, Parkhurst IOW. YOB: 1. What do you think? 2. I certainly hope not. She made an appearance in the Sonic Arcade game, but Japanese kids think she's so cack Sega may think again. In fact, my network tells me that Tails hasn't proved too popular either, so he's going to be dropped from now on. First as usual with the news that counts... 3. He's a pillock of the first degree. 4. Funny you should mention that. I've designed a version for every machine, but didn't do the Mega Drive because I forgot. 5.

STUPID LITTLE JOBBIE OF LAND Dear YOB, I was flicking through the pages of my June copy of CVG when I came across your fraction of the mag. I noticed that you own a chainsaw of your own, which made me continuous laugh for hours on end. It look so small and crap that it is no match for any of my Black and Deckers. All of my chainsaws are Black and Deckers except for one which I made myself. I made it because other chainsaws are not powerful enough for my needs. So, YOB, if you ever feel in the need for a good chainsaw duel, let me know. We will see who the real chainsaw champ really is. BUSH HEAD Isle Of Man PS Can I just say hello to my lovely nurse?

"SNES, MEGA DRIVE, PC, AMIGA/500/600/1200, CD-ROM Mirage is rising to the challenge of by MIRAGE creating some of the most formidable looking robots ever seen on the pages of CVG. We're talking mean... TBA PREVIEW NEW YEAR Stage of Development 65% complete page! Luckily, Electrocorp scientists have been working on a secret project a cyborg with a human brain (which can't be infected by the virus) which could go into Metropolis 4, without firepower, and kick the crap out of the enemy robots. Once you see the graphics in Rise and these still shots of the PC, Amiga 500 and 1200 versions just don't do them justice you'll forget all about the plot and just go \"Gumph!' If you've always wanted total realism in your animation and masses of detail, then you're gonna get it! Console owners needn't feel left out, either; there are versions of this potentially massive battler well into production on Mega Drive and SNES, and we'll be giving you a glimpse of those versions very shortly. In the meantime, we'll tell you that Rise is a one or two-player beat-'em-up featuring a massive assortment of different robots to trash, and gameplay that will, reckon Mirage, send other games in the genre scuttling. We'll bring you more news as we get it in the meantime, just sit and stare at these incredible pics! Methinks he's just about to say: 'It's clobberin' time. These are Amiga and PC shots, but it's also due on the SNES and CD. ou've had your fill of dinosaurs now it's time for the rise of the robots! Mirage's new futuristic beat-'em up is coming to computers, consoles and CD machines shortly and you simply have to see it to believe it! To cut a long plot short, Electrocorp, the biggest manufacturer of military robos on Earth, has replaced humans with a new robot the Supervisor. A selfaware machine, it is left in control of the main manufacturing plant, Metropolis 4; unfortunately, the clever old thing has picked up an EGO virus and decided to send his robot chums on the ramOh what big arms you have grandmother. We've come along way since Robbie the Robot you know. You simply run out of superlatives to describe the amazing 3D rendered animations that are bursting out of the screen in Rise. 118 "

"ELFMANIA AMIGA RENEGADE TBA Another scene from the excellent Streetfighter 2 (just kidding). What is an elf any way? Is it like a pixie or something... PREVIEW Elfmania had a working title of 'Weirdo-eyes-mania'. ...surely they don't fight, I thought they were nice and... (Snip Ed.) Mortal Kombat features digitised actors pounding away at each other, with sprays of blood and the occasional head becoming detached from its body. As with most beat-'em-ups, the game features a host of special moves. These aren't limited to simple hurling moves during combat either, there are also the much-vaunted death moves. When your opponents stand reeling at the end of a bout, execute one of these and, depending on your character, you'll either incinerate them, kick their head off or catch them a cropper with a devastating kick The early version of Amiga Kombat is shaping up to be every bit as good its console cousins. More importantly, though, it isn't going to be a toned-down version like the bloodless SNES game. The finished article should have all the gore and action of the coin-op. To get around the joystick's lack of buttons, the keyboard has to come into play to execute certain moves, although it's too early to tell if this will affect the gameplay. The game's scheduled for a Christmas release and you can find out just how it turns out in the bumper Chrimble CVG! MORTAL KOMBAT AMIGA VIRGIN  ETBA eat-'em-ups may be common place on console, but the number of decent combat games on the Amiga can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Renegade is going some way to remedying this with the launch of a game they feel will send the opposition crashing to the canvas. ElfMania is set in a world of swords, sorcery and bloodied knuckles where only the strong survive and the weak get sand kicked in their faces. Six fighters, three human and three elves take part in one-on-one battles to prove once and for all just who's the hardest person in the land. Each character has a massive arsenal of moves thanks to an ingenious control system which makes up for Amiga joysticks only having one button. Instead of energy, the combatants have coins which they drop each time they're hit. When they run out of coins the battles over and the skint loser slinks off home again. These coins can also be chucked at the enemy to cause them even more damage, although this isn't wise if you've only got a handful left. The most striking feature about this game is its excellent 32-colour graphics and stunning animation. Although the version we've seen still has two more characters to be added, all the playability is there and it looks like being a corker. You can find out just how good it really is in the next thumping issue of CVG. in the best 'better late than never tradition, Amiga owners can finally match their Kombateering console mates with their very own version of Mortal Kombat. The game is being developed by Probe, the company behind such hits as Alien 3 and already looks as though it could top the charts. BES1 YUR MIGHT B IMETALS PA Feeling alone and left out? Don't be, MK is on Amiga soon! I think you could safely that he's just been Mortal Mondayed. Only pensioners and the dead could have failed to have been caught by at least a short edge of the hype surrounding the console release of the game. If you haven't seen the game you're probably wondering why people are getting so worked up about a simple beat-'emup. The simple answer is the violence. Instead of cartoon sprites, Probe reckon MK on Amiga is going to be as hot as on console. Stunning backgrounds are courtesy of 32-bit graphics. AUTUMN RELEASE WINTER RELEASE pe "


"AMIGA/PC by GAMETEK .99 Wow! In Elite 2 you even get to zoom in on surface terrain. There's heaps of it too! You'd have a job finding a haystack, let alone a needle. PREVIEW OCTOBER RELEASE Stage of Development 99% Complete \"It's space Jim, but not as we know it.\" Elite 2 is full of typically hefty space objects. Some are even better than those in StarWing! It's all systems go! These type of animated scenes are frequent. Elite was special, and now its long-awaited (and we're talking long) sequel is looking very special these Smooth 3D vector graphics are awesome! fa game's taken five years to program, you'd expect it to be something special. When that game is the long-awaited sequel to the legendary space opera Elite, you demand something incredible. Frontier Elite 2 is ready and waiting to blast off into games stores everywhere and the hype surrounding the product is justified. This game has almost as much history as its illustrious daddy. It's apparently been rewritten more times than you can imagine, and was originally to be released by Konami until it decided to flog off all of its floppy product and concentrate on console publishing. Now GameTek has picked up the title and it's easily its hottest game! There's little plot, save for your grandfather giving you a bit of cash and a spaceship and sending you on you on your way, but that's not important. What is important is the scope of the gameplay, and there's oodles of it in Frontier. You can play just like the original Elite if you so wish fly around the cosmos, trading with planets and blowing up baddies, nicking their cargo as you go; you could set yourself up in business as a miner or a space-taxi service; join an intergalactic army and battle your way through the ranks; or you can realise the full potential of the game and toddle off for a bit of action and exploration. There are over 70 different missions to tackle in Frontier, compared to the paltry half-a-dozen in Elite, and with variations on each mission, that's a lot of things to keep you occupied. Stay out of reach of the long arm of the law, do the right things, fall in with the right crowd and rise through the rankings if you're good enough, you can even become god! When we say this could well be one of THE best games of all time, you'd better believe us. Filled vector graphics whiz around the galaxy, made up of a reputed FOUR BILLION planets not even the programmer, David Braben, knows where they all are. Oh yeah, the PC version incorporates texture-mapping techniques to make it look even more swish. And it all comes on one solitary disk! Can't wait? You'll have to just for a month, though; that's when we'll be reviewing this monster! 123 Ooer! You'll soon fill your pants when you're under attack! "

"This is the best weapon in the game. It obliterates anything. PREVIEW down into the local artificial jungle. The game begins at this point, as Conrad regains consciousness and sets off into this platform adventure. Controlling his slightest move you need to guide Conrad through six distinct levels of uncomfortably designed platforms, completing challenges which are designed to restore your memory and hopefully help you back home. Plus you've got to do all this while dealing with unexpectedly intelligent defences. So what's so special about another platform game? Well, it's Conrad himself. He's possibly the most realistic character to ever appear in a video game. Animated at 24 frames per second, the result is ultra smooth animation which is uniquely 'human' and even more realistic than in Prince of Persia. Conrad is subsequently a very athletic chap, capable of crawling, rolling, sprinting, leaping, hanging, climbing, shooting and throwing objects, and all on an empty stomach! Given this, you can expect heaps of scenery interaction and some blinding puzzles. Watch out for our corking review next issue TOTAL CARNAGE SNES THQ .99 ter and a combination of the coloured fire buttons giving you eight-way firing. Instead of appearing on a game show, you're now sent out to destroy an evil despot who inhabits a warzone along with his legion of crack mutant troops. The key feature of the game is action. As in Smash TV you come under attack from a huge number of creatures, all of which home in on your character. To even things up a little there's an awesome arsenal at your disposal including flamethrowers which incinerate a quarter of the screen and guided missile launchers. THQ has got its work cut out if it wants to come up with a game capable of topping Smash TV. You can find just how they get on in the full review next month. FLASHBACK SNES SONY TBA ince hitting Europe, THQ has failed to make much of an impression, with titles such as the tragic Home Alone 2 being less than well received. This is a situation it hopes to amend with its conversion of Williams' smash hit blood 'n' guts coin-op Total Carnage. As you probably gathered from the title, the object of the game is quite simply to kill things. It's actually the unofficial sequel to Smash TV, and retains many of its features. The control system is essentially the same, with the D-pad steering your characCartoon clips are common place in Flashback. Here Conrad recharges his shield. DDD lashback looks set to go down as one of the most successful multi-format conversions ever achieved. Out already on the Amiga, PC and Mega Drive, Flashback is soon to appear on the SNES and it is looking fabulous! Tanks and troop carriers fire at you and drop off more soldiers for you to mow down. Yipes! This is Total Carnage's version of Smash TV's Mutoid Man. He takes just as many hits to kill, and is absolutely loaded with lethal weapons. Level eight, and the action's virtually non-stop! The first level gets you used to what's ahead. BNN You take control of Conrad Hart who is an investigation agent in the year 2142. While out testing your Molecular Density Analyser you make a startling discovery which quite frankly, fills your pants. As you race back to worn the authorities about a possible alien invasion you get slapped by a pair of dark figures and whisked off to have your brain erased. Charming. Anyway, Conrad somehow manages to escape on a Hover Bike, but with only half a brain he's easily shot Conrad checks his inventory for a stone. He'll throw it to cause a diversion and shoot the baddie in his back. After The War Of 1999. Reporters Swarned Into The War Zone...

"SNES/MEGA DRIVE/ GAME BOY/CD-ROM by STORM Jobe manages to grab a virtual gun and blasts the baddies in the flying section of the SNES version of the game. TBA PREVIEW of course the fun doesn't last long the Virtual Reality project gives Jobe vast intelligence and he decides to become God. Oh dear. Stormin' ahead Anyway, taking a look at these screenshots, you can tell that Storm is working at a fair old pace to try and get the games of the movie looking good and ready for release early in time for the New Year, to coincide with the launch of the widescreen video of the film. The CD version is looking particularly pleasing we managed to sneak a peek at the PC-CD game running at the recent European Computer Trade Show in London, and we can assure you that it's one of the more impressive titles occupying a silver disc. All of the versions have a number of different styles of gameplay, from 3D flying sections to the familiar platform style, and if work keeps on at the rate it is, post-Christmas buyers should have a bit of a smart film licence on which to blow Auntie Dotty's Chrimbo cash. Look out for full reviews in CVG soon! WINTER RELEASE Stage of development 70% Completed Jobe does an impression of the T-1000 in the incredible looking CD-ROM game. This is as you may have gathered is the Lawnmower of the title. It's from the CDROM version, looks good eh? THE LAWNMOWER ou'd think that, with the unrelenting wave of media exposure surrounding Virtual Reality the subject would be a bit passe now. But no, the wonders of VR are still eagerly awaited thanks to the ever-changing games put out by W Industries on its fab Virtuality machine, and all the big hardware firms are working on home VR consoles. It's little wonder then that the movie which brought Virtual Reality to life, The Lawnmower Man, has managed to gross $145 million in cinema bookings and video rental since its release, and been watched by more than 40,000,000 people worldwide that's a lot of bods. Aiiiee! Bees! Close encounters of the virtual, buzzing kind in The Lawnmower Man CD. One of the platform sections from the Game Boy Lawnmower game. 2012CVG Man Here at CVG we've known about The Lawnmower Man The Game for a while, in fact ex-CVG staff writer Jools Watsham worked on the project as a graphic artist. But it's only now that we've been able to show you pics of ALL the different versions in production: SNES, Mega Drive, Game Boy and the most impressivelooking of them all CD-ROM! If you've never seen the film and there must be a couple of you sad enough to have missed out it centres on the VR experiments of Dr Angelo (played by Pierce Brosnan) on dim-witted gardener Jobe (Jeff Fahey), known to folk in the neighbourhood as The Lawnmower Man. At the start everything goes well, but More airborne action ahoy, this time from the Mega Drive version of The Lawnmower Man, as Dr Angelo gets in a flap as he searches for Jobe with a pair of virtual wings.

"MEGA DRIVE MEGA DRIVE Lost Vikings VIRGIN VERSION.83 BE Price TBA PREVIEW FEBRUARY Stage of Development 70% complete Baleog loses his cool: \"Now then, I Baleog the Fierce will, with my mighty sword Bloodsipper... oi, hold up, stop jumping about you're making the bridge go all wibbly. I'll tell Erik!» ost Vikings was critically acclaimed by almost everyone on the SNES not more than a few months back. With its winning formula of humour, puzzles, arcade action and men with lots of facial hair, it looks likely to be a hit on the Mega Drive too when Virgin releases it later this year. The plot comprises three Nordic warriors who are kidnapped by aliens. Guessing that they are to become exhibits in some xenomorph zoo, and none too chuffed about a lifetime in a cage with Glen Miller, they decide to try and escape back to the fjords of their home planet. The game is set in five different locations from the decks of the UFO, through creepy dinosaur infested caverns, and on to ancient Egypt. There are 37 levels to complete, each packed with some fiendishly complicated puzzles, which require SVERSION your bearded threesome to act as a team to solve. You see, each one has a particular skill on offer: Erik the Swift can run like the clappers, leap high in the air and batter down doors with his head; Baleog the Fierce is an expert with a sword and the bow and arrow; and Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block enemies and protect his pals or even, rather more unbelievably, act as a parachute. Nordic power Controlling only one viking at a time (though you can swap as often as you want, you have to use your skill and judgement to overcome all the obstacles, kill the baddies and solve the puzzle to get to the end of each level. Your characters find weapons, power-ups, extra shields and weirdie stuff like gravity boots to aid them in their escape; and there are loads of keys, bombs and tuck to stash in their inventories. So there is lots to think about you might, for instance, be able to open a door by having Erik headbutt it, dropping a bomb by it, finding a key, pushing a button, pulling a lever or even operating the lever by having Baleog fire an arrow at it. There's often more than one way to solve a problem, but though the solutions start easy they rapidly become brain-achingly complicated and require a lot of lateral thinking. Luckily for you thickies you can glean the odd hint by finding clue boxes or talking to friendly aliens, and anyway even if you do get stuck the handy passcode system and fast-paced arcade-style action stop you getting bored. So there you have it a puzzley, arcade/adventure platform game. Full review coming soon. Annual meeting of the Karl Malden Club, for men with large, bulbous noses. 2 191. 21\" la Olaf's particular forte is keeping undesireables at bay, and green, wriggly, funnel shaped aliens come under that category. Red hot gastropod action, as Erik goes 'Manno a Manno' against a large snail with unfeasibly large eyes. 129 "

Steel Wheel Got a SNES? Then you'll be wanting a decent pinball game... ...well your Dreams could be about to be answered. every SNES owning pin-table addict is about to be answered. This Christmas Pinball Dreams will be the first and, for the foreseeable future, only, pin-table game on the SNES. It features four tables, each with its own theme and set of hazards. Level one is a sedate, but strange affair involving a train and lots of mechanical ball hurling devices. From there things just get weirder and weirder. The horror zone has you bouncing your ball off all sorts of tentacled critters, while the aim of the music table is to wend your way further up the pop charts. Survive those and you get to the final table Ignition. Here the action's hot enough to test the most hardened pinballeroes (a what? Ed) as your ball PINBALL DREAMS SNES GAMETEK .

This is tougher, but you earn an extra life for each one you free. Dinosaurs are also on hand to make life difficult. Being primitive chaps, your humans only have the ability to jump. Fortunately more enterprising, and now extinct, members of the tribe have discovered spears and fire, which can be collected to ward off the dinosaurs and anything which gets any funny ideas when it comes to survival of the fittest.

It's not just a case of hitting the bouncers and blatting the bonus tiles, though, there are accelerators, pits, traps, multi-balls as well as a host of unconventional pinball nasties all out to make sure you don't get on the high score table. The game has a proven track record on Amiga and PC where it was launched to rave reviews. Lucky SNES owners can expect their version to retain all the graphics, features and, most importantly, speed of the other versions. f there's one thing the SNES really needs, and every other machine seems to have a wealth of, it's a decent pinball game.
