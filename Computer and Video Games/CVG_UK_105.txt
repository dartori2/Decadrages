"SONY CD GIVES YOU THE EBJEEBIES Forget Filofaxes and Psion Organisers this is what the Yuppie of tomorrow will keep in his hand-tooled Moroccan leather briefcase. The new Sony EB has a flip-up high resolution dot matrix screen and a flip-up alphanumeric keypad, with five assignable function keys. But what makes it such an innovative and exciting gadget is the fact that it is the world's first pocket computer with a built in CD-ROM drive! The disks which are encased in a plastic sleeve are about the size of CD single, but can store a stack of information. Sony are releasing the machine in Japan with 18 disks which range from the standard address book-type software to film review compendiums. Not only that, the machine also has the facility to double as an audio CD player so the Yuppie of tomorrow will also be able to listen to his favourite Frank Zappa singles wherever he goes. UK prices are uncertain, and a UK release date is even more uncertain, but don't be surprised if you see it in the front of Dixons' window by this time next year. SONY THE OBITUARY COLUMN ! GOOD IMPRESSIONS The Aliens, those acid-blooded, bio. mechanical monsters and the Predator, the alien hunter who kills American Gls for sport, are about to collide on a computer screen near you. Activision, having previously released separate games about both movies, have agreed with Twentieth Century Fox to combine the two to produce \"Aliens vs. Predator\". Should be one absolute hum-dinger of a battle when these creepy creatures start knocking heads! Also, coming soon to a cinema near you are Alien III Alien World and PreImpressions have leapt on the compila dator ll (the latter, however, not featurtion bandwagon with the release of ing Big Arnie this time, but Danny Power Up, containing the rather nice Glover of Lethal Weapon fame), \"Will Chariots of Wrath, Palace's Cosmic PirActivision be grabbing both licenses ate, and Kenny Dalglish Soccer Man straight off?\" is the question we're ager, all for .99 for the ST and asking ourselves. Watch this space Amiga and be the first to know. This month we mourn the sad loss of two software manufacturers and one hardware manufacturer. Geordie softco, Tynesoft, departed this life in mid June, after years of happy programming. Amongst their hits were the Winter and Summer Olympiads, Superman, Circus Games, Rodeo Games and Beverly Hills Cop. Their next release was to be the much publicised Horrorsoft title, Elvira Mistress of the Dark, a game which promised to set the adventure world alight, but it's future is now uncertain. Grandslam shuffled off this mortal coil at about the same time as Tynesoft, after a long and, on the whole, worthwhile innings. They were the people behind such classics as the Pa. CLand and PacMania conversions, Thunderbirds, the original Hunt For Red October as well as the home micro versions of the little-known coinop Scramble Spirits and the Megadrive game Space Harrier II. Finally, we have (or had) Miles Gordon Technology, they who would have liked to have brought you the SAM Coupe. Unfortunately the idea of a souped-up Spectrum never really caught the imagination of a public lusting after Amigas, STs and consoles, and the machine was plagued with delays and problems with the ROM (which recently had to be reissued). What is particularly tragic about the SAM's demise is that software houses were just about to start producing games exclusively for it, Enigma Variations' Defenders of the Earth being the first MISTAK Erk! In last month's Neo Geo feature, we forgot to mention that the machine and the games were very kindly loaned to us by those lovely console people at Spectresoft, Covent Garden (call them on 071 240 1765).

The US megacorp is signing deals with Konami for Nintendo and Sega translations of Pirates (buccaneering thrills and excitement on the high seas) and Silent Service (WW2 submarine battle-sim).

TIIIIIIIIIII AMIGA .99 The programmers at Bullfrog are never ones to disappoint, but this release is quite a departure from their former hits Populous and Dragon's Breath. Flood might be a much more straightforward game than these two, but it's no less challenging or playable. In fact I'd go as far as saying it's the most enjoyable game I've played this month! It's apparent cuteness hides a truly vicious game, with thunderous explosions going off all around, vast tongues of flame vapourising the Vongs, and even the sounds of distant laser fire in the background. The sampled sounds, like the clangs of bouncing grenades and the tick of time bombs contribute a lot to the game's appeal and its sense of humour. Just when you're getting cocky with your flame thrower, you can press the fire button only to be greeted by a clucking sound as Quiffy draws out a completely innocuous rubber chicken! There are also some spectacular traps, such as the vast number of nuclear missiles which launch from a side wall if you inadvertantly collect a certain icon! This game is loaded with surprises, packed with action and lagered up with laffs. If you're not a complete bum-bag you'll go out and buy it, pronto. PAUL GLANCEY GRAPHICS 91% SOUND 98% VALUE 93% PLAYABILITY 95% OVERALL 95% VIIMIIII UPDATE Hang out the flags you ST owners, because Flood is out now for your jolly machine. Single-sided drive owners miss out on the loading music and intro sequence, but that aside the game is the same as the Amiga version, and is also out at this moment. Ahh, isn't he cute? C+VG 39 "

"Find out its limits. Look in the mirror. KATARI 1040STE ATARI SM124 BAARIS "


"Introducing the powerful new Atari 1040 STE. With such an awesome machine, we're convinced the only limits you'll come across are your own. Based on the incredibly successful 1040 STFM, the 1040 STE itself goes beyond the limits of its predecessor. The 'E', by the way, stands for 'Enhanced'. But once you've discovered its amazing array of features, you may consider 'Enhanced' to be the understatement of the decade. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the 1040 STE is its graphics. Its palette contains over 4000 colours (all right, 4096 to be exact). To ensure precise and realistic images, the STE features 'hardware scrolling', enabling smooth scrolling in any direction and split-screen effects. And, with the SM124 monitor, you'll get razor sharp black-out-of-white text that's as clear as the type on this page. To complete the picture, it is able to 'phase-lock' its video output to an external video source, permitting direct linking to a Genlocking device. The 1040 won't just have your eyes swivelling in their sockets. Your eardrums will also take a pounding from the 8-bit PCM stereo sound. The new PCM (Pulse Coded Modulation) sound system's two chips allow the 1040 STE to replay high-quality sampled sounds, in stereo, without burdening the CPU. Or, for even more of an earblasting, just add a couple of RCA output jacks and power the sounds through your own stereo. Of course we mustn't forget memory. One megabyte of RAM comes as standard. If that's not enough, the 1040 STE provides four SIMM sockets. Simply plug in some SIMM (Single Inline Memory Module) boards and boost the RAM up to four megabytes. To help you handle all this technology, we've added even more: a Blitter chip, capable of shifting data at high speeds independent of the CPU, and a new version of TOS. The TOS 1.6 (operating system) has an enhanced file selector with drive-change buttons, improved desktop with file move, MS-DOS compatible disk formatting, and better application installation and auto-booting facilities. As you'd expect, there's a huge range of peripherals including hard disks, floppy disks, laser printers, colour monitors and even Megafile 44, Atari's unique 44-megabyte removable hard disk. As well as all this hardware, there are hundreds of software programmes for the 1040 STE we're even throwing in the ST-Series Productivity and Leisure bundles free. The Productivity bundle features a database, spreadsheet, word processor and business graphics package, and there's S.T.A.C., FirST BASIC, Hyperpaint and Prince in the Leisure bundle. If you're itching to get your hands on the controls, there are two 15-pin analogue controller ports (which accept paddles, lightguns and light-pens) and a 9 pin mouse port and joystick port. With adaptors, up to six people can use the 1040 at one time. Just in case it's too much for one person to handle. At .99 it certainly won't be too much for one person to afford. The ideal computer at the ideal price, you may think. We think so, too. But there remains only one potential problem: not whether you'll make impossible demands of the 1040, but whether the 1040 will make impossible demands of you. Please send me further details of the 1040 STE and other Atari products. NAME: ADDRESS: -------------POSTCODE Please send to Atari Corp (UK) Ltd. Atari House, Railway Terrace, Slough, Berkshire.

"SUPERTRUX ENCORE VA/hat's big, well 'ard and V weighs 30 tons? A truck. What can you do with a truck? Well, you could always hurl it around nine European cities in order to win that most coveted of awards, the Supertrux Trophy. Just think, racing around the streets of Europe, and er, well, that's just about it really. As driving games go, this re-release is a tad behind the rest of the pack. Driving around is a bit simplistic (wot, no gear change?), and the graphics overall look a bit duff.

"AMIGA REVIEW Imm UNREAL BY UBISOFT Cons ago, the mighty Sleeper sent his faithful servant Fragor to bring life to a new world, the planet Unreal. Taking with him life-giving eggs, the four elements of earth, air, fire and water and two powerful guardians, Fragor travelled to the lifeless world, but upon landing, his ship was destroyed when it collided with a massive comet. The resulting explosion scattered his cargo across the face of the planet, and the guardians, without Fragor's supervision, began fighting for control. Before long, they were soon power ful enough to transform them selves into the very elements Fragor had brought with him. However, one of the eggs, having escaped the attentions of the guardians, came to rest in a peaceful valley and hatched into a copper dragon Years later, the dragon came across a young couple, Artaban and Isolde, who befriended him. The dragon visited them on many occasions, but one day, he failed to arrive. Isolde, in her TIIIIIIIIII AMIGA .99 help defeat the dark lord, so Artaban and the dragon set out to destroy the four elements giving evil its power, and find the changing blade'. a magical sword that recharged with crystals from the comet, and rescue Isolde from a fate worse than death. anxiety, called for the dragon from the highest hill, so loud as to catch the attention of a servant of the Supreme Guardian, who captured her and took her to the Lord of Darkness. The evil one, captivated by her beauty, offered her a choice; marry him, or he would destroy the valley. Isolde agreed to the marriage, if only to save her people. The copper dragon came to hear of this, and at once told Artaban. The dragon, feeling responsible, swore to UPDATE The game makes heavy use of the Amiga's specialised graphics and sound hardware so UbiSoft aren't planning to release versions for any other machines. While the dragon dodges dinosaurs, Artaban fends off monsters with his fiery blade. V001 Unreal is another of those games along the lines of Shadow of the Beast, with pretty graphics and at mospheric sound, but which is rather lacking in the gameplay department. The \"flying around on your dragon\" 3D section is very impressive, and the screen update is quick, but the overall effect is spoiled by text messages, such as the inane \"You hit something\". The main combat sections in which you control Artaban are the real (unreal?) let-down in the game, just walking or jumping from left to right and prodding monsters with your sword gets pretty boring after a while. Being able to dip your sword in fire for a temporary fire-blade is nice, but it doesn't seem to have much effect, and the le. vels (dragon, Artaban, dragon etc.) become repetitious after several plays.

Through overuse of industrial pesticides and chemicals, they've only gone and killed off the Earth's entire insect population, thereby throwing the planet's ecology into complete and utter chaos. To try to redress the balance, man tried to create his own species on insects, but Hey! A secret treasure room! Get all the power-ups! somewhere along the line, a mutant virus got into the DNA makeup, resulting not in a new breed of small, harmless bugs, but a species of rogue killers. Now, though, the boffins reckon they've got it right, and they've created a super-fly, codenamed Venus, which is capable of seeking out and eliminating all of the mutants. This is where you come in, guiding Venus through ten different horizontally scrolling worlds, each consisting of five levels, and all played against the clock. Venus has a built-in energy cannon, capable of 6 types of shot, ranging from a wimpy standard pea-shooter to a juicy 4-way megablaster!

"EVIEW IIIIIIIIIII) VIIIIII .99 A Blast the bugs in the P-47-like bonus stage. JUS sect or laser bolt, and when the bar reaches zero, bang goes one of your three lives. There are five types of icon scattered around, such as gravity reversal, which flips the fly upside down and reverses joystick controls, lime loss, super jump, continuous jump, and stunt, which stops Venus jumping altogether. Larger insects drop power-ups, that, when shot, give things like extra lives, energy boosters, shields and the like. If all five levels are completed, you move onto a bonus level, giving you the chance to boost your firepower and reclaim much-needed energy. Bzzzzz! This game is bril liant! A game about insects doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun, and I apTrap with some trepidation. But I can safely say that this is one of the best 16 bit blasters going. The graphics are large, bright, colourful, well defined and fit in to the game perfectly, and the tune that plays along is one of the best I've heard on the ST, and really suits the game. Control of the fly is simple enough, but when the joystick controls reversed, the stuff really get hits the fan. The bonus level bears a remarkable resemblance to P-47, but after blasting away like nobody's business and amassing yourself a bulging armoury of weapons, you feel hard enough to take on the world, never mind the next level. The terrific visuals, the super-tough armaments and the possibility of finding hidden bonus screens at any moment will have you glued to your screen longer than that mouldy bluebottle's been glued to the flypaper hanging in the lavvy.

"REVIEW MINIMIZ TOPLAYER .99 There was once a mighty warrior by the name of Hercules, who was the offspring of Zeus himself, lord of all the Greek gods. He was given twelve tasks to perform lo prove his worth. Now, many years hence, his daughter Yolanda has been cursed by the death goddess Hera to be shunned by all mankind. To lift the curse she must re-enact the twelve lasks of Hercules, and that's where you come in. Controlling Yolanda, you must jump around fifty levels ol relentless action, climbing vines, jumping on platforms and avoiding demons and beasties to reach a portal at the end. Once the portal is enlered, you move on to another level. BY MILLENNIUM A Flippin' toughand this is just a training level! YOLANDA After playing this for some period of time, there's only one thing left to say arrrggh! This must be the most gutwrenchingly difficult game since Steve Bak's original C64 classic, Her. cules, of which it's a copy. The difficulty isn't all that's been converted across the graphics are small, the scenery is roughly drawn and the sound is enough to make you smash your fist through the screen after two minutes. But while the game admits to being difficult, and at first play seems totally impossible, it isn't, and you gradually learn which platforms or vines are likely to burst into flame or disappear when you step on them. It drives you mad, definitely, but what makes things worse is the fact that it also keeps you coming back for more so by the end of half an hour, your loved ones will be doing up the straps on the strait Jacket and hiding all the steak knives. Not for the faint-hearted, but if you want a real challenge and I mean a REAL challenge buy it.

"EVIEW UMID UPDATE Midnight Resistance will be blasting onto the ST at .99. C64, Spectrum and Amstrad at .99 pretty soon. Keep your eyes on the Updates section for further developments. TANCE warriors Good thing you can fire backwards in these crawlways. 11 Sausis AMIGA .99 I quite enjoyed the orig. inal Data East coin-op, and was quite looking for ward to the conversion, but wondered how the coin-op's gun rotation control would be transferred to joystick. Unfor tunately, my fears have been confirmed and the twist-stick control doesn't really work on a Joystick, making control overly difficult, and so playability suffers. For example, when you want to fire up, you end up jumping into the path of an enemy bullet, and after several such \"accidents\" you feel like feeding the joystick to the goldfish. The graphics are good. and capture the feel of the arcade machine, and the music and sound effects are good, but the pan-pipe tune doesn't quite fit the game somehow. But in spite of its flaws. Midnight Resistance has that little bit of extra oomph to put it above many similar shoot 'em ups. Overall. a nice game that would definitely appeal to fans of the coin-op. but falls at the last hurdle due to the rather unforgiving controls.

At each checkpoint there is a similar choice of two tracks, eventually leading to four separate finish posts. The graphics, as you'd expect from Sega, are excellent. Each track has its own international theme, with, for example, collages, red buses and the houses of Parliament on the English track, and deserts and Pyramids in Egypt. Being a motorbike freak, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Racing Hero. The bike is highly flickable, and racing down the twisting roads between cars and lorries is adrenaline-surging siuti.

You bet your boots, matey! The graphics are simply stunning, with superb parallax scrolling backdrops (the incredible flame effect on planet two has to be seen to be believed), fleets of amazing alien craft to blast and some of the best end-oflevel baddies seen in ages, especially the fire breathing robo-Godzilla, which caused much eyeball-popping around the office. As well as looking great, it sounds great too, with an ear-pumping array of cracks, crunches and explosions enhanc. ing the action perfectly. This audio/visual feast wouldn't be worth anything if the gameplay was poor, but thankfully Thunderforce Ill has it in abundance. Six planets might not sound much, but they're tough and completing them all takes plenty of practice. And even if you do manage to finish the game, there are three more difficulty levels to maintain the challenge. Thunderforce Ill is the state of the art in shoot 'em up technology and is easily one of the best console games yet seen.

A mysterious marauding military militia (phew!) has launched a de. vastating attack on your homeland, destroying all but Another horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up? Well, actually, this is no bad thing, as the Sega is surprisingly short of games of this ilk and Aerial Assault fills the gap rather well. Bearing a remarkable resemblance to P.47 in many respects (the second sunset level is a very similar, Aerial Assault looks at first to be a rather naff clone, but behind the small, peculiarlooking graphics and annoying tune lies a game of surprising addictiveness, something that few blastem games seem to achieve. The difficulty seems to be set just right, so experienced and novice blasters alike can dive straight into the action. Thankfully, losing a life (and therefore losing all the extra weapons you've picked up) doesn't necessarily mean 'game over', as building up firepower again is not as arduous a task as with many similar games. If you liked P-47, and want an enjoyable blast on your Sega, you could do a whole lot worse than take a look at this. Recommended.

All of Britannia, it's inhabitants and towns are stored on a four-megabit cartridge, with battery-backed RAM SO you can save your party to the cart at any time, and believe me, you'll need to. I was expecting Ultima IV to be somewhat of a letdown as a Sega title, but fortunately my fears have been well and truly quashed. Okay, the graphics and sound are a bit simplistic, but this doesn't detract from the strong story which grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go. The introduction is very pretty, but once the game gets underway, the screen switches to the familiar top-down view. Wandering around finding villages and towns is fun, but it drags slightly if you're stuck in a wood and can't quite find your way, and it's an all-toofamiliar sight to end up back in Lord British's castle after being jumped by an attacking skeleton warrior. The battery. backed RAM is essential for saving your location every once in a while, and it means you don't have to sit in front of your Sega round the clock for about three weeks on end to complete it.

"REVIEW MITIMI UMS II RAINBIRD DDITI U. ww FIRE & FORGET II The sequel to the Univer. sal Military Simulator is nearly here, and boy it's big. Not just \"cor!\" big, we're talking \"blinkin' flip, how big?\" here. Un like the original, which was two adversaries on one battlefield, UMS II is set on a whole (remappable) planet, can cope with 127 players (computer or human controlled, with up to 16,000 units per side!) and can simultaneously control 525 provinces and 32,000 individual troop units in one humungous ding-dong battle for global domination. You don't just get infantry and cavalry to command, either. In this game you get land, sea and air forces, as well as orbital space weapons and ICBMs. The destructive capabilities of all of them can be set up by the player so you can simulate any conflict from the Franco-Prussian war to the battle of Hoth from The Empire Strikes back. We've already had a sneaky peek at UMS Il in action, and although the 3D view has been replaced by a flat view, it's gonna be more than enough to keep strategy freaks going for eons (and that's no exaggeration).
