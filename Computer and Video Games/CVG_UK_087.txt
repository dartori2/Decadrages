"ax Fashion Victim Touched on briefly in our Paris show reportlast issue, Crazy Cars from French software house Titus is well worth a second look. You race a very nice Ferrari F. 40 sprite across four American States ostensively in pursuit of corrupt policemen running a stolen car racket, though it smacks to us of just a lousy excuse to drive at 200mph! You can plan your route from on screen maps, though the shortest tend to have the highest level of police presence both honest John good-guy bobbies, and the nasty, Shivelling corrupt variety Your Ferrari is equipped with a rather unlikely sounding radar device which is able to tell a police road block from a tree at half a mile 50 you may be forced to make a slight detour down one of the 3D junctions.

But seriously folks ... Body Rap is a neat little gizmo, if guaranteed to cause a few boxed ears over Christmas. Having sprogs running around wired for sound like this is bound to fray a few parental tempers. What happens is that you hit the various sound pads clipped or strapped to your body with other bits of your anatomy, with each giving a different synthesised sound: bass drum, snare, cymbal etc. With practice it is claimed that you can create quite complex rhythms the greater your skills as a contortionist, the better. Or, like us here at C+VG, you can just create an awful racket in \"tune\" with your favourite tracks. Cost is .99 in red, white or turquoise, but we have four to give away to lucky punters.

"Paperback Dredd. THE DARK JUDGES Magazine For those that balk at paying out a fiver for a collection of old 2000 A.D. strips, Titan books have introduced a second line of reprints reflecting comics as they used to be: cheap and throwaway. At least that was the idea pocket sized collections of famous incidents from Mega-city history, and to compliment them a parallel line of Bat-classics and all for pocket money prices. Thing is, paperback books are no longer all that cheap these weigh in at .95 a throw so the idea may be a bit of a non-starter, unless they're for people ashamed to be seen reading comics in public places. Still, they do make trendy little volumes. Judge Dredd vs the Dark Judges features some lovely Brian Bolland artwork, and both the Otto Sump and Fatties books feature some of the most grotesquely hilarious characters in comics. The caped crusader camp classics are even better though early tales of Batman fighting the Joker, the Penguin and other such crazies. We love 'em to death, and they've nice covers too a pleasant little way to blow three quid. BAT MAN The Penguin Fax is getting all globetrotting these days.

CATIOT Cont S eard and Rainbow Bungle Following on from our \"German Bytes\" item in Fax last month, we have received this communication from Marc Ullrech, managing director of German software house Rainbow Arts. It makes clear the situation regarding their games Katakis and Giana Sisters 2, which we got, erm, sadly garbled. He begins: \"Rainbow Arts will not release Giana 2 in any country because we are not satisfied with the quality of this product. We are not going to publish a title similar to Giana 1 or 2, and we have stopped shipping Giana 1 to avoid possible damages if a third party should take legal action. Secondly, Katakis will not be sold with the exception of Germany. A new game calle Denaris will be released throughout Europe licensed by US Gold in January. The game was basically designed with the Katakis knowhow, but with changed graphics, sound and game plot.\" aircraft available for launch HIRIA R RANTIR TIRES "

"ALI Want With the holly hanging up above the mantiepiece and snow lying thick and creamy all around, it's time for C + VG to come over all seasonal and start wishing for its Christmas pressies. Now you lot may well have asked for Op Wolf or Afterburner or whichever of the big coin-op conversions most took your fancy. But here at C+VG the boys and girls are slightly more ambitious than that, and have been asking for some stuff that even the most spritely and nimble of Santas would have trouble getting down the old chimney. Especially the girls! You should have seen some of the rude stuff they wrote before a shocked Fax had to put a red line through it all! Here then is what we want most in all the world (if you are shocked at the lack of computer games, it's because we've already got them all...!)

Ed). 9 To be able to make myself a cup of tea without Julian Rignall shoving his teddy bear cup under my nose. 10 To never have to work again so I can spend less time with Garry, and more with Patrick Swayze. 4 Every arcade machine designed by Eugene Jarvis Sinistar Defender, Joust, Robotron 2084, Stargate, Star Rider and his new one which he's just finishing. 5 A Chimpanzee. They're amazingly funny, and I'm sure it could sell ads better than Garry Williams. 6 Brighton Pier. It's one of the best arcades in Britain... 7 An airline season ticket to America.

"Interplay, Break-away In a startling move that shocked the nation to its foundations, Interplay have split from their mother company Electronic Arts US to become a software company in their own right. The company, originally a programming team with all their work marketed by EA, have now deigned themselves worthy enough of their own slice of the market. Interplay, the team responsible for the Bard's Tale series, Wasteland and more recently Battlechess, will still continue to be distributed by EA over here. Brian Fargo, producer, designer, and general man-at-the-top, slammed any rumours that the team were to be releasing a Wasteland 2 or Bard's Tale 4. \"We are now in competition with EA. Wasteland and BT are EA products. If we were to bring out sequels, then we're just giving games to our rivals.\" This isn't exactly a new idea Sensible Software did it with Micro Soccer for example but it's nowhere near standard industry practice: these demo screens belong to a game as yet without a publisher. Martin Walker, the man behind the cult classic Hunter's Moon, is the designer of Citadel, this near finished shoot 'em up. Behind the walls and floors of these oppresive corridors \"I tried to get the feel of Blade Runner,\" he says lurk both new weapons and deadly traps. The plan is to have the game ready for early in the New Year, with a publisher sorted by about Christmas \"so that I can buy big nut cutlets with the advance!\" (JR's note: He's a vegetarian). However, we do have two new products coming out in early 89. One is being programmed by the same team that did BT, and the other is being done by the same guys that did Wasteland. Titles are to be announced, and I'm not telling anything just yet, but they are looking quite good. Of course, as soon as we know, we'll let you know. You can check out Interplay's latest spiffo wheeze, Neuromancer, by flicking over to page 74. Latex Laff's I NOW DECLARE THIS BOOK OPEN A snippet of news arriving just a little too late to be included in the Mean Machines section is that there's soon to be a Nintendo version of PacMan. Yes indeed the conversion will be totally faithful to the original 1982 mega hit, right down to the simplistic graphics and sound. So anyone fancying a nostalgic dot-gobbling binge will soon be able to Wikka-wikka-wikka until their heart's content The Original Pac's Back If Santa spits in your Christmas stocking, don't worry it's probably just the Spilling Image Giant Komic Book, a bumper volume packed full of jolly japes and wheezes with your favourite characters from the world of comedy It's laughter all the way with The Crazy Psychedelic World of Frank Bough, Dr Owen (He's All Alowen) and No Head Robson of the English soccer squad. You too can thrill to Judge Deaf and learn how to make yourself look like Ronald Reagon. There's even a couple of sneaky adverts for Spit T-Shirts and slippers Holy Merchandising Ploy, Batman!

There is still a mine field to be negotitated outside, however, and you are likely to be badly short of energy by this point already.

You've got a bit of a problem of repetition when you commit yourself to producing games based on big film licenses which is what people like Ocean have done.

So here surprise, surprise we have a little squat Sly sprite (again) and a product that, if nothing else, is nowhere near as dire as awful movie. The first mission you undertake is a Gauntlet style arcade adventure, with screens flipping rather than scrolling. Seen from an odd not-quite-straight-down angle, John Rambo and peskie ruskies alike look like tiny little shambling male members rushing around the screen. You are trying to rescue your idiot colonel who has got himself captured in Afghanistan, but in the mean time you get to let free lots of rebel prisoners and shoot lots of folk.

TA A Roy features this arcade adventure scene. so bad, I couldn't play it for anymore than a few minutes. Correction. I couldn't play it for anymore than a few minutes. Correction. I couldn't play it. The graphics are pathetic, the gameplay is slow and frustratingly unresponsive. The controls are slack and the fun level is dangerously close to nonexistant. The ball never leaves the floor even when the goalie kicks the ball out, it merely ROY OF THE ROVERS Instead of going for the usual boring approach of trying to come up with a single decent game, Gremlin have quite originally gone for the rather odd approach of putting two very poor games togehter. Does it work well? Does it heck. The first of the two games is imaginatively entitled Roy: The Adventure. This is the full-blown exciting escapade as you guide Roy around the streets of Melchester, talking smiling and fighting with the people he meets. The game is viewed as a side-on scroller, with roads cutting through the plane of vision, both into and out of the plane of the screen. These streets can be moved onto by moving Roy in the general direction of the intersection and pushing up or down to move into or out of the screen. A menu system is used to run the game in a mÃ©thod not unlike the GEM system used on the ST. A menu bar at the top of the screen has four choices, each of which can be selected via a certain key on the keyboard. Each bar brings up a different window, which does different things. Select the Extras option, and you can stop and chat or fight with anyone who may be standing near you, or simply smile at them, shown by a large, Colgatey gleam around reasonable sprite the general vicinity or definition.

There are only two '18's around to satisfy the sleaze-seekers everyone else is going to see nice, wholesome movies.

Yes, you've heard of an actor being paper thin but in the case of Roger it's true! He lives in Toon town, a Silly Symphony suburb where cartoons rule.

Curvaceous Jessica Rabbit is having an affair, and when her love is murdered, Roger becomes number one suspect even though he insists he's innocent.

"which a mysterious client leaves in his safekeeping. It should be a simple chocolate sitting job, but when the client is murdered, Tim has to rely on street-smart Nick to salvage the situation. Diamond isn't the best made film around but it does feature a host of English actors in special appearances, including Jimmy (Oz) Nail, hilarious as a thuggish cop. Probably best suited to youngsters, it's still good to see British kids solving mysteries instead of American brats. For those who like their action harder boiled there's Blue Jean Cop (18) but what else would you expect transformed into a variety of from James Glickenhaus, animals. director of ultra-brutal, Willow's quest (didn't you vigilante saga, The just know there'd be a Exterminator?

En route to Bavmorda's castle, Willow encounters a mixed bunch of helpers, the most important OO of whom is Madmartigan, a hyperactive one-time hero who eventually proves himself, falling in love with Bavmorda's warrior daughter in between. There are plenty of tricky effects, especially during the final battle, which almost strays into Star Wars territory, but somehow the whole doesn't add up to its parts.

"surgery but there's no gross and gory black comedy here. This is a star vehicle for Dudley Moore so it stays pure and 'PG'. The result is probably the weakest of the genre, unless you happen to like Moore's clowning, and it's a relief to report that there are no more movies using this plot in the pipeline. If you need to like Moore to enjoy his film you'll have to love Michael Jackson to yet another crooked cop! Who'd live in New York? Going all out to create a sense of flash-trash, Call Me fails to combine its two strands. The woman becoming fascinated by her telephonic pornographer is interesting and the acting of Ms Charbonneay and her Noo York friends is excellent. But the thriller element is less satisfactory and its woman-in-peril melodrama becomes unwelcome as the film develops. It's not a wrong number but it is as frustrating as a crossed line. Back in the wholesome stakes there's Sunset (15) set in the days of silent cinema when cowboys were Cowboys and Tom Mix was the best. Only one of today's big names could whip up that old Mix magic but is amicable Bruce Willis big enough? I'm not convinced that he's quite superstar status yet, despite the rumoured $5 million he received for Die Hard, but he and James Garner make a good team in this clever detective thriller. Garner is Wyatt Earp, the legendary Wild West lawman, brought to Hollywood to act as advisor on Mix's latest picture. Mix and the Marshall hit it off so 'Ere's yer dinner. better than his last outing with Willis, the myopic Blind Date. As undemanding adventures go it's the right sort of picture to dispel Boxing Day gloom. It's also a lot better than Like Father Like Son (PG), the latest addition to the series of role-reversal films. Busy Dr Jack Hammond and his son swap places thanks to a magical serum and undergo all the culture-shock experiences of school/work that we've become accustomed to in films like Vice Versa and Big. The one saving grace for this one could have been if the son had to perform major sprint to Moonwalker (PG). It's a noisy mess, mixing old promos with a crummy plot about a drug dealer. Lots of special effects as Michael ego trips away to his heart's content and presumably takes it in from the teenage girls who screamed all the way through the preview. Everyone else should (moon-) walk the other way! Finally there's a low budget beauty which opened at the end of November. The Nature of the Beast (PG) is set on the Lancashire moors where a boy becomes obsessed with tales of a giant, sheep-killing creature roaming loose. Meanwhile in the town below another beast, that of unemployment, strikes. It's a bravely British film which is nowhere near as gloomy as it sounds. It's as funny and tragic as real life and deserves to be widely seen as an antidote to much of the Christmas mush above! A An' I said to 'im ... well that soon they're visiting a house of ill-repute together where they witness a murder! This really is the month for mysteries and pretty soon star and cowboy are out to solve the conspiracy of corrupt Hollywood heavies. It's a nice idea which is never fully developed by director/writer Blake Edwards, but at least it's "

You can pack a terrific punch by standing still, waiting for a fire bolt to form and then letting it lose on your hapless victim. The only drawback is the standing still bit: While you're performing this piece of magic you're wide open to attack and your opponent won't hesitate. At the top of the screen is an arrow which points the direction you should be going in. Keep an eye on this as it also tells you when to throw a punch. The amusing part of the game comes when you die. You fall flat on the ground and a plump golden angel floats heavenwards.

"39 stig ND OF THE After numerous rumours and rumblings, it seems that 1988 will, after all, be remembered as the year there was a serious Japanese attempt to launch games consoles in Blighty. This Christmas both Sega and Nintendo will be competing for sales of their own home based systems in British shops. But still there's no sign of the much-vaunted PC Engine, and in Japan the market is already looking towards the second generation of games machines. The recent Amusement Machines Show in Tokyo provided a valuable opportunity for catching up on developments in the country where it's all happening (or most of it, at any rate Japan. Nick Kelly reports. doesn't seem to register, for some reason. Whereas in Japan everyone's totally at home with the idea of computers in their everyday lives anyway so they don't have any hang-ups about using high-tech equipment to provide them with their spare-time thrills. So just what is on offer to Japanese console owners? Well, up until a couple of months back, the answer would have been straightforward enough. Three 8-bit game systems dominated the market; Nintendo's Famicom, the Sega System and NEC's *** 3 to Fantazy Zone on the PC Engine. s GOLDOG SHO MB OLD WBADODO SHOT BOMB The average Westerner's conception of the land of the Rising Sun is of a nation of hard-working, technology mad folk, and, although like all racial stereotypes this image should be taken with a pinch of salt, there's a fair amount of truth to it. It's also an incredibly rich country, and Tokyo is undoubtedly the most expensive city in the world to visit. But another, perhaps less well-publicised fact about the Japanese is that they're video-game mad! Whereas your average game player in this country is almost ashamed to admit that he's a regular visitor to an amusement arcade, in Tokyo coin-op arcades are perfectly respectable places where everybody from schoolboys to lawyers go to partake of the blasting arts. The arcades themselves are far more comfortable and well-maintained than their British equivalents, with seating in front of all of the cabinets. You can even buy soundtracks of your favourite video games on CD in the bigger record shops! And perhaps it's this far less inhibited attitude to arcade blasting that has led to the popularity of the games console, as opposed to the home computer, in Japan. My theory is that British parents (who tend to do the lion's share of stumping-up when it comes to high-tech entertainment) tend to buy their offspring home computers as opposed to consoles because they fondly imagine that by buying their children computers they'll be contributing to their education whereas a games console is a just an expensive toy.

Their Family Computer System (Famicom for short) has sold something like 12 million units in Japan and there have been about 400 games produced for the system. Nintendo have been selling Famicom systems in Japan for some five years now, and about three years ago they also launched the system in the United States, and now have an impressive eleven million sales for their American system, the Nintendo Entertainment System. This Christmas, they'll be hoping to add Britain to their success stories. The major secret of their achievements is price-related: in Japan and America they sell their machines for lower prices than any of their major competitors, thereby generating a large initial user base, which in turn leads to a huge number of games being manufacted for Famicom/NES machines, which attracts still more console buyers who are impressed by the numerical superiority of the Nintendo software base as well as the low price. Ironically, however, this huge market BOLT 5 * 30* share, and correspondingly large software base may be ausing problems for Nintendo in Japan at least. Mr Gushi of Hudsonsoft, a major Japanese Software manufacturer, says that while Nintendo's massive user base represents something like 90% of the market in theory, many of these machines are mouldering away in the back of Japanese cupboards. \"We can say this because we know the sales of our own software. We used to sell 600,000 units easily for the Nintendo, but nowadays 300,000 is about the maximum we can do, no matter how much we invest in advertising and promotion.\" The problem, it seems, is a combination of the machine's own technical limitations and the huge amount of unoriginal, clone-type games which have been produced for V PC Engine baseball. it. g STRIKE \"Each new piece of software is fairly similar to something that's gone before. And it seems to me that the engineers at all the software houses have mastered the capabilities of the Famicom's technology and are using the system's technology to its full extent, so that even if they come up with a better idea, they still can't express that idea with the Famicom. That's certainly been our own engineers' experience.\" Even Nintendo themselves agree that their system, at least as far as the Japanese market is concerned, has run into problems of late. According to Howard Phillips of Nintendo, \"the software isn't as fresh and new as it could be, there's a lot of repetition and not a lot of new, original games. To some extent the engineers could be said to have exhausted the system. As against this, however, Phillips points to the huge growth in popularity of role playing games in Japan, as exemplified by the unprecedented success of the Dragon Quest series. This role playing monster, now in its third incarnation sold a whopping 3 million copies. "

"OF THE RISING ING CONSE The new 16-bit Sega LAND OF have the effect of making the present range of consoles spanking new innovations that they may be in our eyes decidedly old hat. Sega have already launched their 16-bit Super system in Japan, showcasing arcade-level versions of the likes of Altered Beast and Thunderblade. And, according to a recent announcement from Nintendo's headquarters, they have commenced extraordinary results in the graphics work on a 16-bit SuperFamicom. and sound departments. Sega's 16 bit machine looks like the \"Right now most of the games one that we might see over here first, machines have a memory of around 2 as (a) it's complete and on sale in Megabytes. CD-ROM can hold Japan now, and (b) Sega are already something like 548 MegaBytes, about well-established this country with 250 times the memory capacity of other their 8-bit system. machines! This means you can, for Nevertheless, Sega wasn't prepared instance have CD quality orchestral to put any date on the British release of soundtracks for the games. their 16-bit baby: \"no decision has Hudsonsoft have already started been made as to whether or when we developing games like Street Fighter might release the machine in Europe.\" for the CD-ROM attachment. The huge Nintendo are taking things far, far attraction that the CD-ROM add-on slower. Although they have definitely Thunderblade on the 16-bit Sega. committed themselves to producing a SCORE 8200 DO 1000000 16-bit machine, it isn't likely to appear for quite some time, and we'll be lucky if we see it in the next three years. Part of Nintendo's whole philosophy of going 16-bit is not to spurn their existing customers; hence, according to Nintendo spokesman Howard Phillips, \"the new 16-bit machine will be compatible with the existing 8-bit Nintendo software. This may well be a canny move. Nintendo's extremely successful approach to date has been to STAGE 1 produce cheaper than the competition. More X68000 Salamander. thus generating a wider user base and software base. Having your new machine able to run hundreds of already existing games will be a big attraction. NEC ave, according to Hudsonsoft's Mr Gushi, no immediate plans to introduce a 16-bit PC engine (apart from anything else, their 8-bit version is already arguably able to deliver coin-op standard graphics anyway), but they have just launched an extraorindary add-on to the basic machine which will, they say, open up a world of extra possibilities. And NEC's use of new technology may indeed prove a far more marketable approach in these parts than bringing out a 16-bit PC Engine would assuming, first of all that they manage to get the 8-bit version into the shops. NEC's big new innovation is the CD-ROM add-on, previewed in the recent Tokyo Electronics Exhibition. This device takes the form of a CD player which can interface with the PC Engine as well as hooking into an ordinary hi-fi system. This allows a huge amount of extra memory to be accessed by the machine, with might have in this country is that you can also use it as an ordinary CD player and link it into your stereo, thereby enabling games-loving music lovers to upgrade two parts of the entertainment systems simultaneously. (In Japan where a whopping 83% of the population already own CDs, this isn't quite such a major selling pint). Apart from all these developments and promised developments from Tokyo, there are also a couple of other, local entrants in the great console handicap. Atari have recently announced that they hope to launch a very competitively priced console, the ST Plus, next Spring, a sixteen-bit console largely based on the ST home computer. Joystick manufacturers Konix are also likely to be bringing out a fairly impressive looking threegames system which will inclu sit-down steering wheel There seems to be no doubt that the games console is about to make a big impact here over the next to 12 to 18 months. But, before you all throw away your keyboards and saddle up for the console age, you may be interested to hear that in Tokyo the hippest young game players are actually selling their consoles and saving up to buy a home computer instead, the extraordinary Sharp X68000, which promises incredible sound and graphics as well as all the attributes of a seriously powerful computer. Only trouble is, the X68000 currently retails. in Japan, at about ,500. In real life, as a wise man once said, there's no Sanity Clause... "
