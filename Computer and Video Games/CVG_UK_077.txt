Xenon is an interesting point of comparison between the ST and Amiga. Both versions are brilliant but the Amiga is better. It's faster and the music just wipes the floor with the ST. Constantly changing and reacting to the joystick and featuring sampled guitar riffs and tremendous explosions. Melbourne are promising Spectrum and 64 versions of the game-but I wouldn't buy until you see the C+VG review. I am not entirely sure the design of the game is strong enough for it to hold up on those machines. It's difficult for me to tell you how good Xenon is. All the cliches are too well worn. You know what I mean, statements like \"it's worth buying an ST just to play this\" that kind of crap.

"WHO THE HELL DOI BROTHERSI Currys. Computer gaming has seen individual programmers hyping themselves as stars before from zany hippies to child geniuses who are waiting until their seventeenth birthday to step into the shiny new Porsche, paid for out of last year's royalties. There have been some instances of groups hyping themselves. The Bitmap Brothers are one such case. Ask them why they called themselves the Bitmaps and you are likely to get a variety of answers. \"It came out of that Beastie Boys song you know the one that mentions the word brothers, well our name has the word brothers in it too.\" Or: \"We were going to call ourselves the Big Mac Brothers but we thought we might get done by MacDonalds if we did\". Even less likely as Steve is a veggie. The truth, if they haven't forgotten it, is probably nearer to this: Someone came up with the idea 1 because it was linked to the way they programmed they all hated it but it stuck and now they have come round to thinking that it is a pretty unforgettable name and so well worth hanging on to. They are now fiercely Bitmap's to the man. Here are their profiles: STEVE KELLY School: Left at sixteen to become a storeman at Born: In Manchester and now living in London ... still speaks Mancunian, though. Vices: Smoking, nocturnal programming and the consequent afternoon rising, turning the phone off, slot machines. ! Best TV prog: The Prisoner. Worst TV prog: All soap. Best computer prog: Missile Command (coinop) and Elite. Worst computer prog: You forget the really bad ones which is probably just as well. Most embarrassing experience: Having to explain to an ambulance man how I walked into a scaffolding pole. Best film: Paris, Texas. Should software pirates be locked up?: The people who do it for gain, on a vast scale, definitely should be. Is 8-bit software dead!: Not for a good while. Some 8 bit games are still better than 16-bit games. "

"MACHINE: ATARI ST SUPPLIER: OCEAN PRICE: .95 VERSION TESTED: ATARI ST. REVIEWER: DAVID BISHOP 14 CVGZ Sun sets on Ocean's evolutionary game. accc ( r & $ o Ocean is not renown for its thought provoking software but their latest 16-bit release, ECO, may well have you contemplating life, the universe and the price of ST software. Designed and programmed by Liverpool based Denton Designs, ECO places you on the bottom rung of the evolutionary ladder, with one single aim... survival. To begin with, the program randomly generates a world, complete with climate and population ... a kind of speeded up software version of 'the dawn of time'! As a lowly and insignificant baby insect, you are thrown into this world, in search of food and a mate. The world is seen in 3D, initially from behind your insect, which is shown in beautifully animated vectorgraphics, as is the case with all other trees and animals in the game. As you move your insect, so new creatures come into view; some are walking, others gallop, squirm, or hop, and still others have perfected the art of flight. To mate, you need to find and approach another member of your own species. If there's one thing more frustrating than being eaten just before you manage to mate, it's seeing your potential partner getting squashed by some giant dinosaur who wasn't looking where he was going. Successfully mating brings up the 'gene design' screen, where you can unlock, and move, one of your genes to create (hopefully) a more advanced species. Every time you mate, you can unlock another gene, giving you still more possibilities for evolution. Each gene affects different aspects of your make-up, but many interact with each other to bring about very complex changes in the species. As you slide genes into new configurations, the new creature these changes would produce, is shown in windows giving you three different views front, side, and plan. Genes affect such things as the number and size of limbs. the occurrence of wings, body size, whether the new creature ECO Denton Designs bounce back on the Atari ST. will walk upright or on all fours, and numerous other evolutionary factors. The trick is to work out which are the more important genes and how they interact. Each time you succeed in moving up the evolutionary scale, there are more species that you can kill and eat (including all the species that you have just evolved through), and fewer animals that are a direct threat to your existence. However, this doesn't mean that you can develop into a horselike quadruped, or a humanlike biped, and not worry about being knocked off. Far from it, because the concentration of creatures, above you on the evolutionary scale, will always increase enough to keep you on your toes or hoofs or claws! Failure to feed and mate before the timer, in the form of a skull sinking into the flames, runs out will result in your species becoming extinct. The same fate awaits you if you are squashed or eaten by a superior species. Although it may not appeal to hardened arcade freaks, ECO is a beautifully conceived and implemented piece of software, that is not only fun to play, but could also be used to illustrate Darwin's theories of evolution in the biology classroom.

Once logged on, there are clues to be found, but first you must decode the information. While roaming the streets, marshes, and forests of the complex you will continually be accosted by military guards. When this happens, you must move your sights over the randomly placed guard and kill him before he gets you. To get anywhere in Catch 23, you'll need to construct a fairly detailed map of the complex. Apart from the scientists' houses, there are some 40 shuttle routes to work out and use, not to mention countless booby trapped buildings to memorise and avoid.

"REVIEWS PLATO Vietnam war zone. Most people thought it was a joke when Ocean said they were coding a game around Platoon reasoning that it was one thing churning out naff film tie-ins of James Bond and the like, but quite another thing to cheapen such a good and \"serious\" film. Whatever your views on this there is no denying that as a game Platoon is an extremely well thought out and challenging arcade adventure style game. Thankfully it is not merely an excuse for video gook bashing as it might so easily have been When you examine the whole package-the poster, audio copy of the film's theme tune \"Tracks of My Tears\" and the way in which the game has been done you have to acknowledge that the subject matter has been treated extremely sensitively.

It was the seen it, played it, bored with it syndrome? But I gave it a go, Joeand I'm still playing. Just why is it these types of games are just so damn playable? Traz has a few new twists to the bat, bricks and ball formula and, most importantly, a construction kit which allows you to design your own scenes There's even a silly plot to go with the game. Traz is a computer controlled prison to control. For example, two at the bottom of the screen and two at the top. Or at the bottom of the screen and along one side. There's even a screen where two bats are positioned almost above each other, with the lower one moving at a slightly different speed. That can be confusing. In addition there are the usual oddities which emerge to interfere with play and cause a bad deflection. * ES * "

You get a sound clue when to add to the confusion, the control changes and the bats change colour. Confusing, eh? And there's no set time between changes. Control can change and the swap the next instance. The construction set could be the main selling point of Traz, especially if you've bought any other versions of this style of game. I constructed some pretty strange screens. I thought they were brilliant designs and hugely playable. Others thought different. But that's life. The screens are all inventive, from tropical trees to adverts for Ace 2 and the nice part is that you don't start on the same screen each time. Variety prevents boredom. And then there are the question marks. These are the real wild cards in the pack. For a start it's impossible to know what they will do. And believe me they can do some weird things. One may give limited fire power to your bat, another may rob you of all control over the paddle, others make the ball disappear only to reemerge seconds later on another part of the screen.

For a game some form of time compression and a way of \"zooming\" in and out of larger scale maps is essential. The method chosen by Subbattle Simulator makes the game almost impossible. Time compression is reasonable up to one (realtime) second equals 30 seconds, but then it jumps to ten minutes, and to four hours, reverting each time to the smallest scale map. This means that you either have to run 12 day-long patrols in the ten minute mode, or speed up and risk that a degree or two out in your navigation, multiplied by eight hours' sailing, will put you in Tokyo harbour in two seconds. Even worse, once you have sighted a convoy the computer, not you, calls \"battle stations\" and locks you in tactical mode, with 30 seconds as the fastest speed. The basic submarine tactic of stalking a convoy all day to attack at night is not possible. Subbattle Simulator is potentially a very good game.

The game has a total of six different playing areas; Sand Duning, Grass Tracking, Icebergs, Desert, Tropicana and Swamp. All of these scroll from left to right and you are instructed to out-manoeuvre an assortment of obstacles including rocks, fences, icebergs, mounds and ball bouncing seals. The screen is split into two windows the top window shows player one's progress through the course and the second player two's. Both players must compete against the clock. Any player who fails to reach the finishing line within the given time (which changes according to the difficulty of each course) will lose and forfeit the race. The remaining player is permitted to proceed through the remaining courses, until he/she fails to complete the course within the given time. Controlling your bike or buggy is achieved by using either the keyboard or the joystick. If you successfully complete any course within the given time limit you are awarded a score bonus which rapidly clocks-up your score. The graphics for ATV are feeble and weak and the sound is no better. Playability is almost non-existent because of very poor joystick and keyboard responses. I don't know whether Code Masters intended ATV to have been a rival to Mastertronic's Kikstart, or maybe it's just a slight coincidence that it turned out to look and sound almost like it.

The power play is pretty much the accepted standard for martial arts gamesa wide variety of moves and a battle for points. However, System 3 has added a new twist the third fight, the joker in the pack which means that you daren't turn your back unless you want a fist or foot smacked into it. There is also a new bonus screen in which you must deflect bouncing balls with a shield. But more of that later. Your player has 17 joystick moves, ranging from the previously mentioned spectacular backflip to flying leap kick, front face punch to crouching stomach punch and headbutt to reverse face kick. So you can see there're plenty of options when it comes to taking your opponents apart. A match consists of two fight rounds and a bonus round.

"It's show time again as the arcade game makers display their mega products. C+VG arcade ace Clare Edgeley samples the delights of Thunder Blade, Ninja Warriors and the rest. It seems only yesterday that I was reporting on all the new games at last January's Amusement Trade Exhibition ATE-and now it's come round again. The depression the coin-op industry was going through in 1985 seems well and truly over and a host of new games are waiting for the trigger happy in 1988. The show was slightly disappointing there weren't masses of new innovative games around, rather a lot of good quality shoot'em ups and punch 'em ups, all of which we've seen before in one shape or another. Anyway, to kick off, I'll start with the biggies dedicated games, which come in specially designed cabinets. These are always good games, generally cost more to play than your average blaster, but are addictive too. THUNDER BLADE Sega had a strong presence at the show and was launching one game which had. everyone talking Thunder Blade. This is a helicopter simulation with several innovative features. It's instantly recognisable. The cabinet is shaped like a mini-chopper, slay airbome. The game starts with a demo run NINJA through a high rise building area WARRIORS skyscrapers whiz past your blades, lanks on the ground fire Taito's Ninja Warriors is the rockets in an attempt to stop your newest martial arts simulation and headlong flight and enemy is played on the same style cabine! choppers launch into the attack.

It's too soon, the demo run turns into a huge stand up cabinet with three the game proper though I must say screens joined together to provide it makes a pleasant change to have one very long playing area. It a practise run first. works very well and has the Swinging your chopper from advantage that you can see what's side to side causes the cabinet to coming up long before you move accordingly-its great. The get to it. game perspective changes all the The storyline differs slightly from time throughout this fast moving Sega's Shenobi in so far as you game.

Your first opponents are soldiers The first level is fairly simple, in combat gear and it's a simple though I suspect the only reason I matter to put them out of action. was able to get as far as I did was You don't even need to kick them because I was playing for free! as they run quite happily into the Otherwise I'd have been shovelling small dagger you're holding money into the machine like there Watch out for gun tofing soldiers was no tomorrow though, you'll have to crouch As soon as you've sailed through under or jump over their bullets. the city and got rid of or dodged Either run forward while ducking the bullets to get close enough to SES 10. Sa stab them or throw a few shuriken. You only have a limited number of these so don't chuck them away. Monster aliens soon appear which take several hits to kill, these are deadly and will cause you to blow a few fuses if they catch up with you. The first time this happened I couldn't believe my eyes. After all, whoever's heard of a robot ninja. round the tanks and choppers you'll Guard dogs are another hazard find yourself flying over the ocean and these tend to attack in packs. with a huge aircraft carrier as targel.

But I feel that On the second level the perspective changes to a bird's eye Shenobiis a more challenging game, as is Vigilante. view of a steep sided canyon. The risk of taking your chopper down Twin Cobra to ground level is all too realyou're more likely to end up splattered against the walls of the 1745 cliff. There are lots more scenes and levels in this brilliant game. What's more, it should be in most arcades fairly soon and because it is driven mechanically and not through electronics the price of the beast is much lower. Hopefully it'll be pretty widespread. resting on skis with a high bucket seat and the screen somewhere down at feet level. You can almost imagine yourself patrolling the skies, looking out of your perspex bubble as the ground rushes beneath your feet. The quality of graphics and gameplay are superb. The control column accurately simulates all the moves of a fast moving helicopter-pull back and to one side and you'll rise while slipping to the left or right. Push forwards and you'll go into a screaming nosedive. Missile and cannon buttons are mounted on. the joystick and on your left is the speed control gear with notches to allow you to stop dead and hover, fly at quarter, half, threequarters and full speed. It's vital to get the hang, of changing your speeds because you're going to "

This shows the layout of the track, its chicanes and straights and tells you where you are in relation to your opponent. Final Lop is a first class racing Sim, it's tremendously addictive and I'd love to play it when more than two cars are linked together. It's a definite must for all would be racing drivers. Full marks to Namco for a really competitive game. Martial arts games are still big news and at the ATE three new ones made their debut. Shenobi, the martial arts sim from Sega, reminded me vaguely of Atari's Rolling Thunder in its clean colourful graphics and large well defined sprites. You play the hero Musashi, a master of Ninjutsu. Your object is to rescue hostages who are tied up at points throughout the game and to fight the big boss at the end of each level. None of the martial arts games differ greatly in their plot. Shenobi, however, features a bonus level after each stage. You're given a limited supply of Shuriken (deadly stars) which, when thrown, kill the enemy outright. These are best saved for situations which can't be dealt with by one-to-one combat. The enemy comes at you with fists and guns. Jumping to higher levels is vital to avoid or ambush the enemy. Run over the hostages to tree them and you'll eam yourself extra weapons. The more hostages saved the better your weapons. A magic ninja spell can be cast once on each stage and this results in your character turning into the Ninja equivalent of a smart bomb. It's hilarious though highly effective. Your figure remains standing still, while symbol increases your firepower, a replicas of your character shoot 'B' adds one bomb to your supply out from the body and whiz round and you can earn extra lives, more the screen, cannoning off the points and a selection of four new baddies like ping pong balls. When weapons by collecting symbols. the spell is complete, you'll have a The cabinet I played the game bunch of dead on your hands. That on was a hi-tech sit down job includes any hostages if they which was very comfortable, happen to be still tied up. especially as the screen is The bonus level is to prove your set at an angle to you skill at throwing Shuriken and and not flat as in more traditional table top games found in od pubs. Fast moving with pretty graphics, Twin Cobra is a one or two player game which is bags more fun than Thundercade. 30 TWIN COBRA Twin Cobra's is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up with you in control of a chopper flying over enemy territory blasting everything that partner you scream past him on the chicane, briefly you see his car moves.

"QUE AFILIAN furthest platform or ledge and jump from platform to platform to get at you. You must throw the Shuriken at those fast moving figures and put them out of action before they get too close. It's hard work and they need careful aim, but if you clear the screen you'll get the extra lives. A map at the beginning of each level shows how far you ve travelled and by the look of things, it will take you a fair amount of time to clear the three or four stages on each of the five missions assigned to you. Fast moving and very challenging, Shenobi is well worth playing. I particularly liked it for the controls which weren't too complex. A straightforward kick and punch game with bogs of action. HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP Heavyweight Champ from Sega is a boxing simulation that resembles Punch Out!! in that you are seen as a semi-transparent figure with your back to the screen fighting a very solid opponent. However, where the controls are concerned, Heavyweight Champ is in a category of its own. For instead of punch buttons, you have two levers sticking out from the side of the machine which must be swung and punched inwards to simulate your player's hooks and jabs. This must be the most exhausting game I've ever played. By the time I'd got my first knock out, my arms were so fired I couldn't even have bopped a featherweight on the nose let alone another bout with a heavyweight. THUNDERCADE Once you've got the hang of your topple, others will fall at the turn and thrust controls, the job slightest hint of resistance. At the should be much easier. Blasting end of each level you'll meet a some objects gives you a magnet monster thug don't you always which attracts all crystals in the and he must be hit again and area to your ship.

"Waynes PLAY BY MAIL. The big news this month must be that Legend Incorporated Ltd, the company that runs AE's, has ceased to be a full time professional company. Due to the vast success the company has achieved in its short lifetime, both the founding gamesmasters have been offered positions in other areas of employment, so they have decided to run the land of AE's solely on a part time basis and this means taking on only a total of between thirty to fifty players between them. Of course this is going to come as a great shock to the many players that are not going to be allowed to play any longer, as in some circles it was rated as one of, if not the, best Fantasy Role Playing P.B.M. in the U.K. In fact one of their G.M.S Jon Tode, won the Best G.M. award at the 1987 P.B.M. conference, an honour not Busy, busy, busy, that is the only way to easily won.

It's all go, with lots of special offers for all you At present Legend are P.B.M'ers out there, so let's get on with inviting other P.B.M. keeping you up to date with the news and companies of a similar nature to put flyers into their views from the ever changing world of P.B.M. cessation package (at a price!)

All I can say is pick one Third P.B.M. convention will most interesting 20 or so that you think may suit you be well and truly over. In the letters. and look back in previous next issue.

I would be only too Apparently within the game although we had our glad to hear the comments an insidious tactic is differences of opinion, they and criticism on the event appearing with increasing were undoubtedly 101% from any C+ VG readers who rapidity, which spoils the dedicated to the game, which attended. We can only whole concept behind it. is the reason behind why they improve future conventions What happens is that a few did not sell it.

If this cheating tactic happens to you, you would do best to ignore everything that is said and report it to the G.Ms in your next turn. The people at Starglobe have instructed me to tell all Starglobe players that you should NEVER, EVER give out your ship or account number to other players for any reason at all!! Moving on to the C+VG game of It's A Crime, the curse of Wayne has struck again!! As I write not only have the gangs mentioned in the Feb issue of C+VG slid down the table quite dramatically, but we have new leaders in the Notoriety table for the umpteenth time? At numero uno position at the moment are the Meathead Brigade, with 687 points, closely followed by The Axemen, with 656 and The Street Freaks with 644. Other notables are The Street Angels, who are fifth with 630 points, Satansfist, who slip down to tenth with 601 points and the Lumps of Green Putty who nosedive down the table with only 494 points. The Fighting Falcons obtains the most notoriety in a week, with a tremendous law braking 109 points, whilst the Toughest are the Iron Angels, the wealthiest are The Merchant Bankers (well named that man!!) and the gang with the highest income is The Lonely Emingonrants. There is a new P.B.M. orientated based Fanzine out called Totally Zane. It is produced and edited by Mrs Linda Little and is well worth a read. Issue 0 contains a read. issue U contains a couple of short stories one by that famous author Andrew Prentice — a P.B.M. which all purchasers of the mag can play for free and is loosely based on certain well known political figures, F.R.P. coverage, a serious discussion page that is very interesting indeed and a regular P.B.M. feature "

The rumour/newsheet that games to strategic/tactical Orders games, but has been is issued every turn is full of To balance the game out, frightened off by complex info.

Furthermore, the examples is somewhat similar to the Each country you control may make only one divisional movement per turn. You may not move more divisions out of a country than the number that started there. board game called \"Risk\". On the negative side however, I found the rulebook's actual presentation very basic, with the only artwork being on the rulebook's cover. The artwork itself is not that amazing, but I must admit to being quite amused by the C.N.D. symbol on the back cover. The G.M. informs me that the original basic A4 map that is in my possession has recently been enlarged to A3 size and redrawn for clarity. This is a blessing because I found the old map somewhat limited. Furthermore, the price of .25 per turn was a bit pricey, but I have checked this out with the company directors and negotiation is where Wayne comes to the fore!! Wayne's Wonderful Offer Hints and Tips If you intend playing this game here are a few things you should know: Cover your world map with the clear cellophane that is used to cover books in Libraries. Then buy some chinagraph pencils and use them to mark of where your troops have moved, what areas you controls etc. The great thing about these is that they can be wiped off with a damp cloth. You should expand your area of control rapidly, taking over your N.P.C. neighbours swiftly and clinically. Write to every other player country as soon as possible. Establish a basis of negotiations with a peace pact, then when it suits you, stab your weakest ally in the back. Be mean!! Most games last around thirty turns and people start getting knocked out on average around turn five or six, so be extra alert when this period arrives. Use the newsheet to create lots of scandal and rumour. Worry your opponents' allies, Yes, once again I have punished my body via the terrible ordeal of physically dragging the G.M.s of Crisis down the pub and quaffing many, many pints of lager, so that IWayne the benevolent, can get you the loyal readers an offer you can't refuse. So how about this. Any reader who writes in with the logo above and a s.s.a.e. will get a FREE set up, FREE rule book AND three FREE turns in \"Crisis\". This offer will save you the massive sum of .50. Also, if you pay for ten turns, you get a turn free. Furthermore, I have arranged with that if enough C+VG readers stay with the game after their free rounds have expired, the people at Mystery and Adventure Games promised me that they will drop the price of their turns buy anything UP TO a maximum of 50p, so the future price of the turns is in your hands. I believe that most of the people who take up this offer will stay with the game anyway, as it is worth playing. Enjoy! Finally, I would remind you that I am here to sort your P.B.M. problems out at all times. If you have any sort of P.B.M. problem whatsoever, just drop me a line with an s.s.a.e. and I will do my best to sort it out. See ya in thirty!! "

"Level 1: The Jungle The map shows the correct route to follow Ito the Viet Kong village. Whilst travelling you must keep moving all the time otherwise a Viet Kong soldier may jump on you from above. Traps have been set on the brown pathway it is best to blast these before jumping to clear your way. When your morale is low, shoot at regular intervals to lessen your chances of being hit. If a member of your platoon should be hit, swap to another. When you destroy the bridge, hang around to pick up medical supplies which the VC will drop when you blast them. Level 2: The Village The key to this level is to search the huts carefully and not the position of the booby traps. It's trial and error be prepared for casualties but learn from them.

"PI.TOON Level 3: The Village This is mapped for you, so make sure you use it. Your objective on this level is to find the compass and two packs of flares. It is important to locate all of these items as you will need them later. Use ammo sparingly as it is in short supply. Search everything in every room and use the rooms for rest when necessary. STAMINE HITS BULLETS SCORE D O000200 Level 4: The Bunker Again use ammo sparingly a short burst should be enough to dispose of any attacker. Take out each attacker as speedily as possible. This is important as towards the end they speed up and will kill you if you give them any leeway. Send up a flare as soon as you have killed one VC as this will enable you to locate the next attacker. Turning off the music enables you to hear their gunfire. Level 5: The Jungle MORALE A short burst of gunfire as you enter each new screen will take out at least one of the enemy. On screens with lots of obstacles, stay at the bottom until no more VC run on. On less crowded screens dash to the top as quickly as you can to make up the time lost on more difficult screens. The quickest route to follow is as follows: at the junctions go left, then right and at the last one go right again. AMMO 1:14 0235060 HITS YOU MADE IT 1 YOU HAVE NOH FULFILLED THE REQUIRED Level 6: Barnes The game pauses slightly at the beginning of this level to give you time to compose yourself for the final and toughest challenge the fight with the deranged Sergeant Barnes. Go straight for the grenades when the action resumes. Move from left to right constantly, Barnes always fires straight at your position. You will need five direct grenade hits on Barnes' bunker to complete the game hop aboard the rescue chopper and see the congratulatory screen come up which informs you you are on your way home.

TRANSBOT Transbot is a version of the classic Defender by Williams. You play on a left to right scrolling backdrop and have to shoor aliens which attack in various inertial patterns. The scenario has you battling through a city to finally reach an underground fortress where THE BIG ONE happens and you get to fight it out with Elgramzon. There are two gauges that need to be watched, a power gauge which decreases every time you are hit by an alien (you lose a life if it hits zero) and an arm gauge which counts down every time you fire. You can arm your ship from a choice of six weapons by first shooting an arms van that trundles in every so often on the bottom of the screen. If you then catch the pod as it leaves you can choose a weapon from the display. The six weapons are Normal/Beam/Sword/ Cannon/Diffuse Beam and Two-way fire. Graphics are pin-sharp and there are some twisty/turny attack patterns hidden away in the higher levels.

There is plenty of challenge with 12 courses to choose from, three difficulty levels and an edit mode that allows you to design your own tracks.

Check it out NEWS TIPS HANG ON The other motorbike offering this month is the other arcade classic Hang On. This is absolute dynamite. As a conversion it is silky smooth and action packed. You have three gears and switch between them by using the up and down on the pad this can be frustratingly dodgy to start with as you can change gear while taking bends unintentionally. There are five stages to cover: circuit, seaside, monument valley, city night and circuit again. Each stage is four kilometres long and has to be completed in the time specified.

It is not a true on-the-bike view, instead Sega has opted for a diagonally scrolling Zaxxon type approach. Initially I was disappointed after seeing the conversion of Enduro Racer. I figured they could at least come close on play and presentation. Enduro Racer is a ten stage game with five basic scenes (country track/ruins/red desert/ marshland and mountain roads), which are repeated with a shorter time span to make up the ten 60 secs first time round with 50 secs on tracks 6-10. You can enhance your bike by passing as many cars and bikes as you can along the course, these are totted up at the end of each stage and you are placed in the tune up screen. Here you can choose from accelerator, handling, tyres, engine, suspension and items which decreases your damage rating. The play is fast and challenging and the only real problem, and it is a biggy, is that your ability to turn left and right is very sluggish. There is the ability to pick up better handling off the tune up screen.

"Comix wonderful comic magazine called Love & Rockets, from which the stories in this volume are reprinted. It's described by the publishers as \"The hilarious adventures of Maggie, 5 2 O mechanics, sex, rockets, heartaches, rock and roll and happiness in the nuclear age.\" If you're still reading after that, and haven't yet dashed out to procure a copy, let me add that Jaime Hernandez masterfully blends earthily realistic dialogue with economic but irresistable drawings to create a cast of characters you can't help but care about Maggie and Hopey in particular. As you progress through the book you find yourself sharing their mundane day-today concerns while feeling slightly disorientated by some of the background details the existence of dinosaurs in their world, for instance, and Maggie's expertise as, of all things, a rocket engineer. Reading this back, I suspect that I've failed to convey the flavour of Love & Rockets in the slightest. So you'll just have to accept my recommendation: buy this book or be seriously unfulfilled. Heartbreak Soup (Titan Books, .95). In a way, this is a companion volume to Love & Rockets it's reprinted from the same magazine and is entirely the work of another Hernandez brother, Gilbert. (The two books are attractively designed by Rian Hughes to look like a uniform edition.) Gilbert's work sits neatly alongside Jaime's, but on closer examination it is a more complex blend. The ubiquitous Alan Moore remarks in the introduction that the influences of both Japanese and European comics are visible here. And the subject matter is far more relentlessly \"normal\" than Jaime's semi-fantasy world. It might seem strange to speak of life in an How \"mature\" are you? \"For mature readers\" is a label seen more and more often nowadays on American comicbooks. It's a reaction by the comic publishers to a fear that some of their stronger material (sex, violence, bad language and other sure-fire sales gimmicks) will come under the scrutiny of the self-appointed moral crusaders running rampage in America today. Some comic companies, it seems, have panicked at the idea of their comics being censored, and so have tried to introduce their own system of advisory \"ratings\". Hence \"for mature readers\", the comic-book equivalent of an X-certificate (though you're not likely to see it on the X-Men!). Not everybody in the comics business is quite so convinced about the need for a ratings system to stop adult material getting into childish hands. For instance, when DC announced that its books would carry advisory ratings, four of the best-known names in comics replied that in that case they wouldn't be doing any more new work for DC. The four were Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Howard Chaykin (see last month's C+VG) and Mary Wolfman; DC subsequently backed down. It's a stupid argument, of course. Everyone's got their own standards as to what's acceptable and what isn't. And you might well ask, who are they to tell me what I can and can't read? Red herring or not, though, it's a reminder that you're never too old for comics-or, put it another way, there's more to comics than just superheroes. As I've said before in this column, comics is a medium where you can tell any kind of story for any kind of audience. That fact is gradually sinking inwith both publishers and the reading public. Not that there's anything wrong with the ideas of superheroes and there's some wonderful work being done there right now. But there's also some genuinely \"mature\" (\"for mature readers\", remember?) non-superhero storytelling going on. For instance, you'll find \"adult\" themes and artistic sophistication in these: Love & Rockets (book one, .95, published by Titan Books; book two out soon). I must immediately declare a prejudice: I think this book is a masterpiece. It's the work of Jaime Hernandez who, along with brothers Gilbert and Mario, produces a SS SUJS's impoverished Mexican village as \"normal\" (unless that happens to be where you live, of course), but that's the effect of Gilbert's technique. By writing, as it were, in a dull monotone he makes us accept his funny-looking cartoony characters as absolutely real. Hopey and their friends as they endure the perils of post-punk romance.
