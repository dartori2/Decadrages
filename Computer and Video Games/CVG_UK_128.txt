I gave it everything! had and we scrapped like fury in the street He got the shock of his life, ran off, avoided me afterwards and everyone thought I was so hard I was never bothered again. DEPUTY EDITOR FRANK O'CONNOR (Streetfighter Fave: Ryu) I was chatting to a girlfriend once when this really hard bloke came up and tried to take her away. He was really obnoxious and really got me annoyed, so I burned my name on his jacket with a cigarette and got offered outside where I beat the crap out of him and kicked him off down the street. Hurrah! ART EDITOR JON BILLINGTON (Streetfighter Fave: Chun Li) The hardest thing I ever did was stand up in this cinema full of real tough nuts watching this film about racism after they'd just cheered this bloke getting beaten up. I turned round and told everyone they were total prats. The whole cinema went really quiet, nobody cheered the violence again and I felt well proud. STAFF WRITER PAUL RAND (Streetfighter Fave: I'm crap at Streetfighter) When I was fourteen I thought I was well hard when I went to a party and drank a bottle of Pernod, a bottle of sherry and six cans of lager until 1 went into a semi-coma and had to be rushed to hospital. The doctors said I'd nearly killed myself and everyone thought I was the biggest jerk in town. Nothing changes, eh? DESIGNER JENNY ABROOK (Streetfighter fave: Zangief) The hardest thing I've ever done was save these blokes from getting beaten up in the street. I saw the crowd who were going to lay Into them, walked right through them (they even had weapons and went to warn the others.

L's obviously a great girl gamer, but the greatest who chose a Game Gear as her prize in that compo is Lisa Green from Winchester, Hants. Also, the Super Nintendo competition we ran two issues back proved such a run away success that I decided to put up two extra SNESS to later entries and the winners are Jamie Fenton from Peterborough and Robert Stokes from Chatham, kent. Well done the lot of you and thanks to Leicester lad Paul Mallinson for the cool winner's letter!

"NEWS SUPER MARIO IN PAINS PALAVER! 251PCURL Mario fans and artists alike will be be overjoyed to hear that Nintendo are about to launch an art package on the Super Famicom in Japan! Super Mario Paint is the name of the cart and it comes bundled with a rather nifty mouse. The cartridge contains a host of features normal only found on sophisticated art packages like Deluxe Paint. As far as graphics go, the Super NES is an amazing piece of kit. Very high resolution graphics and an incredible 32,000 colours, 256 of which can be displayed on screen at once. The package features a load of goodies including the standard brush, airbrush, fill and pattern type thingies, as well as a rather nifty animation suite. Like Sega's Art Alive cartridge, you can use a selection of famous Nintendo sprites and backdrops including lots and lots of Mario goodies. The mouse is a nice piece of kit and comes in a smart grey colour with a matching mousemat. This gives the package an immediate advantage over Art Alive in that you can now have pixel-perfect images instead of sad etch-a-sketch type efforts. Talking of Mario, have you checked out CVG's Official Giveaway Guide in the centre of this issue? No? What's wrong with you! BIS PETER PAN HITS THESNES! Hook, Steven Spielberg's big Blockbuster is all set for release on the SNES in the States and Japan from Ocean. A massive scrolling platform romp, it features all the main characters from the movie including Tinkerbell, the Lost Boys, Peter Pan and of course the dreaded Captain Hook! The game follows the plot of the movie quite closely as Peter's kids are kidnapped and he and Tinkerbell set off to Never Never Land to rescue them. You'll learn to fight, to fly and swim in a spectacular adventure that culminates in a showdown between Peter and the dastardly Hook! The graphics look awesome and the sprites are full of character and life, very close to their movie counterparts. Look out for it this Summer! GAMESMASTER RETURNS! PLAY JAP GAMES ON THE BRITISH SUPER NES! Jeepers! Just when you thought it was safe to turn off the telly after the Easter reruns of telly's only video game show, along comes news that Gamesmaster's back in the Autumn for a six-month run! Yes indeedy, the top bods at Channel 4 were so bowled over by the first series and who can blame them after appearances from the CVG boys that they've gone and signed up another 26 programmes! Cor blimey, that'll do for me Bob! And there's more the Gamesmaster people are looking for gamers to appear in the show and reckon you lot are just right for a shot at stardom! So if you think you know your stuff and could be a contestant, reviewer, or Consoletation Zone lost person then this is the address you need: GAMESMASTER STARDOM, PO BOX 91, LONDON E14 9GT. Details you have to include are your high scores, your name, address, telehone number and a recent photo of good old you. If you don't fancy the bright lights but want to be in on the action, write to the same address for tickets to the filming. Get to it! As you're probably already aware, you can't run Japanese games on a British Super Nes. The problem is, that British machines and games have a security device built-in. As a result, it's also impossible to use British carts on a Jap or American machine. Fret no longer though, because Shekhana Computers have a couple of devices to bypass that security and let you run any combination of games or machines together. It's a bit of a convoluted system; you have to have a British cart plugged into the device at all times. Basically it takes the security code from your cart and the game code from the foreign cartridge. We've tried it out and it seems to work perfectly with no problems at all. Nintendo don't authorise this piece of kit though and using it may invalidate your warranty. If that doesn't put you off then you can buy one of these direct or through mail order for the princelysum of . Phone Shakey on 081 889 9412. GVG 010 "

Obviously us CVG boys were offered Ken (Frank) Ryu (Tim) and Chun Li (Paul) but we were too busy getting the world's greatest mag out so the parts went to some lesser-known Japanese superstars.

Hudson Soft, the boys who did the original PC Engine version, will be launching the game across Europe but expect a different software house to do the honours for this country.

Uncannily enough, Afterburner 3 is uncannily enough the sequel to, wait for it, Afterburner 2. The gameplay is very similar to the first two titles but with improved graphics and some amazing soundtracks. Sega have no plans to release a cartridge version at present So you'll be able to show off to all your Megadrive-owning pals and make them jealous! Could this be the first decent piece of Mega CD software? Let's hope so! 35 SCORE PIPPED AT THE PIPE Pipe Dream, the hugely addictive puzzle game that turns you into a dribbling wreck, has just been released in Japan! Bullet Proof Software (the blokes who did Tetris on the Gameboy) have succeeded in turning an awesome game concept into a graphically spectacular SNES cartridge. The gameplay is a little like Loopz but instead of a jigsaw you have to connect a series of pipes together and try to reach a drain.

Yup, Gremlin have been granted Exclusive World Rights to use the Mansell name on their games, and they're not mucking about with it either. They reckon the Mansell series could turn out to be the best racing games EVER, and who can argue with the people behind Lotus and Lotus 2? Obviously the whole project is still in the pretty early stages, but really important people like Tim and Jaz have already had a sneaky peek at a very early Mansell demo on the SNES and reckon it's looking well wicked. More news the microsecond it arrives! Incidentally, the CVG boys reckon the boy Nige is Top Racer and no mistake well, he's almost as hard as we are!

"EVE REVIEW NEO GEO MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR SHOOT 'EM UP BY SNK  SINSERT COIN Ninja magic plays a very important part in this game and learning when and where to use it is a crucial skill. Each warrior uses a different kind of magic but they all have the same effect...smart bomb! When you hit the magic button (you have a limited supply) the Ninja leaps into the sky and utters some magic words. A huge blast of energy then expldes from his or her body, wiping out anything on the screen! This is all very well until you try to use it on a bigger baddie, these take a lot more than one smart bomb to destroy so it's a good idea to save them up for the end of each level. Fortunately you can pick up scrolls which replenish your magic powers, so you won't be a sad so and so when you pump the smart button and nowt happens! Spider. The evil leader of a vile communist army. This twisted fiend has been responsible for the untold misery suffered by people of the 21st Century. He must be stopped and only one force is powerful enough to do it the Ninja Commandos. This band of fearless warriors have access to incredible magical powers and are armed to the teeth with sophisticated weaponry and indestructible armour. Well armed as they are, they must battle their way through hordes of psychotic drug-crazes soldiers, genetically mutated animals and wall to wall laser fire. How can they stand against such an awesome foe? It's up to NU COMM BETTER THAN IN THE EYE! A POKE you! LINSERT The LINSERT COIN THREE AMIGOS! At the start of the game you're given the choice of three fighters. Two are men and one is a girl, but what a girl! This lady is a bit dangerous to say the least. When she walks she leaves a ghostly trail, an echo of her own body, and if she's moving fast it looks like there's more than one of her. Each of these ghostly bodies can loose off bursts of laser fire, making her a very powerful warrior indeed. The two blokes are just as hard. One, a blond haired hero, is an American Ninja. He favours the machine gun as a weapon and uses it with uncanny accuracy. He has mastered the art of Ninjutsu and even his Japanese mentors are amazed at his skill. The last fighter and perhaps the hero of the piece is the ultimate Ninja. He has mastered Ninja magic and can shoot fireballs straight from his hands. What a bunch of weirdoes, eh? The first time SNK tried a game like this was with Ikari Warriors, which launched them on the road to riches. The arcade machine was a massive success all over the world and a brilliant game to boot. In some ways this is a homage to Ikari Warriors and uses the same vertically scrolling formula. The game itself is pure blasting action. No mucking about with strategy or planning here just raw, nasty firepower. The two player option is by far the best, with you and a mate running rampant in a frenzy of death and destruction. In terms of body count, Smash TV is the only thing that beats this, with more murder and mayhem per square inch than almost any other game. The graphics are great but by no means the best on the Neo Geo and music and sound effects are spectacular as ever. If there are any niggles at all it's that the game is a little easy and it'll only take you a few days to complete which doesn't give you much for ! Great game, shame about the price!

"RE CVG PONDER...PONDER EXTREME FIREPOWER! CHE DINSERT COIN Nobody has weapons quite like this bunch. For starters, the girl uses an awesome machine gun which fires regular bursts of laser and conventional bullets a combination which can tear through skin, bone and armour plating and is almost unstop pable. The American Ninja uses standard bullets in his machine gun. A double stream of well placed bullets can cause some serious damage. The Japanese Ninja has the most impressive weapon. He fires raw energy from his fingertips, sending a fiery trail of destruction up the screen. All the heroes can increase the width and power of their shots simply by pressing the button as fast as they can. Ninja Commando is absolutely nothing new on the Neo but that's no bad thing because it does it better than most other machines anyway! We've seen this vertically scrolling romp a thousand times before, but the neat touches included in this game are what keeps the interest up. The warriors are all well hard, with some obscenely wicked weapons (I like the flaming tiger!) and graphics are little short of awesome although that's what we've come to expect now. Gameplay is the drawback here it's very, very repetitive and it's thanks mainly to the excellent end-level bosses that you keep on playing. This is very standard fare for the Neo, very slickly done and brightly polished but ultimately failing as a stand alone game because there just isn't enough to justify parting with a hundred and twenty big ones to play it. Two player mode is a good old laugh, especially competing for power-ups with a pal, but even then you find yourself looking around for something else to play. Well worth a few goes in the arcades for a laugh, but that's just about all. TIM BOONE TANDO THE TOP SECRET MOVE ITEM SUSHI BANANA A MEAT, COLA SUSHI BANANA MEAT COLA Recover life STRATEGY SKILL One of the features that isn't mentioned in the instructions to the game is the incredible secret move. Pull down on the joystick until you reach the bottom of the screen and keep on pulling down. You fighter will start to glow, so hold it down until the glowing reaches its peak. If you let go of the joystick and hit fire, something very special indeed will happen. A huge beam of unstoppable force will rip the screen in half as it destroys everything in its path! Discovering this special move is really nice, especially if your run out of Ninja magic. Best of all, you can do this move as many times as you like. Hooray! COIN(SMALL) After the stage ends, you can recover your life level depending on how many coins you collect. SCROLL If you get three scrolls, you can temporarily transfrom into an invincible ninja.

"AUG HOTSHOTS TUDUSE ZANBIEF 16-MEGS OF FIGHTING FUN Streetfighter 2 is the largest cartridge ever designed for La 16-bit system, featuring an astonishing sixteen (count \"em) megs! This memory is needed to hold the huge amounts of graphical data required to animate twelve huge sprites. The animation itself is incredible, retaining all the frames that the arcade game had. The sprites are by necessity a tiny bit smaller than the arcade's but only hardened fans will be able to tell the difference. The price you pay for this much memory is purely financial. Importers reckon the cart will cost about a hundred quid when it's shipped over here in late June. Expect to pay around fifty big ones for an official version early next year! It's the most eagerly awaited console game of all time, and the world is going gaga waiting for it! Streetfighter on the Super NES is set to become the sensation of the decade, and CVG dives in first yet again to come up with the EXCLUSIVE Preview of the game you're gagging for! So without further ado, here's CVG Streetfighter Hero FRANK O'CONNOR with everything you need to know! Streetfighter 2 is all set to become the biggest selling video game in Japan, with advance orders for the game already well into hundreds of thousands! There's absolutely no doubt that the game will be responsible for a massive increase in sales of the Super NES. Capcom stunned the games world when they released the machine in the arcades. A combination of amazingly complex fighting techniques and spectacular graphics made it the most successful arcade game to date. It's the sequel to the original Streetfighter, another innovative beat 'em up which saw the hero Ryu fight his way across the world in an attempt to become the world's hardest bloke. Ryu makes a comeback in Streetfighter 2 and he's learned a few new tricks since his last outing! He, his pal Ken and a host of new fighters are all at your disposal in the ultimate martial arts contest. Fight your way across the globe and face some of the strongest men and women in the world. Perfect your art, use your wits and skill and if you exceed your training, you may even learn a little magic... EUTELE 5 GOUD KO IZANGIEF TV24 "


"AG THE CAST All of the fighters are here on the Super NES. A lot of folk were wor, Aried that Capcom would drop a few characters because of memory restrictions but the sixteen meg cart put paid to that. Ken and Ryu are back, as well as the very nasty Sagat, the boss of the first game. You can control all but four of the characters in the game and each has a very dif, ferent fighting style. Even Ken and Ryu who are for the most part identical, have a couple of tricks up their respective sleeves. EN AND RYU: A Japanese boy, Ryu has mastered the arts of Kenpo and Karate, combining incredible power with amazing speed. His magical abilities allow him to loose off a blast of pure energy from his fingertips and his Dragon Punch is difficult to perform but unstoppable. The Cyclone kick is nice to watch but you wouldn't want to be there. Ken is Ryu's American mate who learned his art with Ryi in Japan but returned to the states to perfect it. Not quite as strong as Ryu but his throws are slightly better. C CAPCOM 1991, 1992 ALL RIGHTS ONDA: Another Japanese warrior, Honda has decided to teach the rest of the world the strength and nobility of the Sumo wrestler. Mind you, he is a bit of a fat bloke. Honda's speciality is the Hundred Hand Slap which turns his arm into a blur of death-dealing mayhem. Honda is slow but he can take a right good kick, ing as well as dish it out. If you get grabbed by fatso, you might as well give up! buze LANKA: There's always one, isn't there? Blanka is the weirdo of the bunch. Hailing from Brazil, he was seperated from his parents at birth and grew up in the South American rainforest. Green skinned and dead ugly, Blanka is just as dangerous as he looks. He can turn his body into a missile and dispose of even the hardest blokes. Struck by lightning at puberty, he often becomes electrified at times of emotional stress. Keep your distance! UILE: This American soldier is a bit of a pretty boy. When he's not combing his hair, he's admiring his own reflection. He specialises in throwing and can grab fighters in mid-air. His Sonic Boom is a force to be reckoned with, a kind of flaming boomerang. Guile is good on the ground and his sweep kick can knock over anything. Nothing is more satisfying than smacking his pretty head in. SHUN-LI: Gorgeous, sophisticated, rock-hard. This is our kind of babe. If she was a president, she'd be called Baberaham Lincoln! Chun-Li is a Kung Fu Master (Mistress?) and can mix it with the best of the boys. Lightning fast and very skillful she can be a real handfull. Her Spinning Bird kick and hery fancy footwork should leave you reeling. Not too clever in mid-air though! ZANGIEF: Russia's answer to Hulk Hogan, this enormous wrestler can sure kick ass! His enormous strength and enviable skill have made him the tough est fighter in terms of defense. He's not too fast but his amazing throwing and grappling skills make him a real threat. He wants to take the Streetfighter trophy back to Russia, it's up to you to stop him! HALSIM: The Indian entry is a very mysterious bloke. A Yoga Master from the foothills of the Himalayas he can stretch and contort his body into all manner of amazing positions. His reach is unmatchable and weird looking though he is, Dhalsim is one of the most powerful fighters. His only drawback is his sad inability to walk or jump at speed. TITUTE 256G "

"REVIEW GG GVG HERME MASTER SYSTEM I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO SAY THIS, BUT HERE'S PRINCEY JUST HANGING AROUND. PRINCE SHUT YOUR TRAP The palace corridors are a PLATFORM deadly maze of dead ends and vicious traps. Most will reveal themselves, such as the boobyBY DOMARK trapped floors that shoot razor sharp spikes into unwary .99 heroes. You can creep past these using the tiptoe technique or even jump over them. The Grand Vizier. Most evil man More dangerous however are in ancient Arabia. Master of the falling floor tiles. sorcery and the black arts. A twisted, bitter old man who has the populace living in mortal terror. Anyway, he's kidnapped your main squeeze. She isn't actually Bakes your girlMy friend, but you're working on it, and if you manage to rescue her from the clutches of El Nasty you'll be rewarded with her hand in marriage (and a big pile of sweets). Cakes! 40. Od of PERSTA CRAZY CROWNS Here are a few Princes you might or might not know about: Prince Charles: A nice old geezer who lives in Buck House, talks to plants, has a totally gorgeous wife and loads of cash. What a boy! Prince Charming: A blonde haired and quite stupidly handsome bloke who usually dresses up in green tights, doesn't have much cash and prances around in pantos. Prince: A bit of a weirdo who's made loads of cash making loads of brilliant records and loads of iffy films. Fresh Prince: A wimpy Bel Air rapper who's on TV and gave us a good laugh with a record called: \"I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson.\" Prince's Salmon Spread: Jars of well tasty stuff you ought to put on your sarnies. (You know where to send the box, lads...) 23 RUNNING AND LEAPING AND DYING The controls for Prince of Persia are the trickiest you'll ever come across in a Master System game. The main reason for this is that the prince can do just about anything. He can jump, leap, climb and swordfight. There are loads of different climbing and jumping skills to learn and this title brings new meaning to the expression \"pixel-perfect\" one millimetre too far and you're history! HARMOUR THE GAME IS PACKED FULL OF HAZARDS AND BOOBY TRAPS LIKE THE PRINCEMINCING GATES ABOVE! AAAA SE \"Prince of Persia has been brilliant on every single format (even the Sam Coupe) and the Master System version is no exception. The graphic style has been copied exactly and the animation is far and away the best I've seen on the Master System! The backgrounds have actually been improved when compared to their 16-bit counterparts and as a result this version is one of the most colourful you'll find. The attention to detail is astonishing it's almost like watching a movie! It must be said that gameplay is extremely tricky and joystick jockeys will be a little bemused when they first try this one. Perseverance reaps rewards though and learning the moves is half the fun. Fourteen very large and very tricky levels mean that you won't be rescuing the princess for weeks, maybe months to come. All in all a spectacular and impressive release and easily the most innovative Master System game for ages. Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?\" FRANK O'CONNOR GVG27.

"GVG GVE REVIEW AMIGA THE HERO OF OUR TALE CAN EARN HUGE BONUS POINTS BY PICKING UP THOSE FLASHY GOLD COINS. cutcut PLATFORM OPHIOS Eve ELECTRONIC ARTS .99 ERE, IT'S EA! It may not sound it, but Risky Woods is a rock hard shoot and beat 'em up. It looks initially a bit like Gods, but only on the surface. Delve deeper and you'll discover a host of gameplay related surprises. You play the part of a lone warrior who must escape from the Risky Woods and destroy its evil inhabitants in the process. The woods are chock-full of danger and you'll have to unlock doors, leap precipices and wear a really smart uniform to survive! So, it's off into the Risky Woods for a spot of Universe saving malarkey! Can't say fairer than that, eh? It's a fact that Electronic Arts have produced some of the best sports and simulation software of all time, including the likes of PGA Golf and John Madden's Football. More recently however, EA have moved into the action/arcade scene with Desert Strike and now Risky Woods. Electronic Arts excel in everything they do, but they can't be responsible for the general quality of this one as it was programmed by a German team. Fortunately though, it's a top treat and the EA legacy carries on untarnished (apart from Madden's on the SNES which is fairly crap) The main objective on every level (apart from staying alive) is to rescue monks from their prison. Their prison is a bit weird to begin with as an evil wizard has turned them to stone. You simply blast your way through the rock to release them. Sometimes the grateful monks will bestow gifts and power-ups upon you, but more often than not they'll be evil monks who hurl flames at you. 2:57 262099 Bummer! You have to release them all though, even the nasty 262099 ones. Double Bummer! enew CD PAUSED stages EVE-KEY 146 WYBUDE SHOPPEN Risky WOODS CIT TONE You've seen this type of game a million times before, but not on the Amiga, so if you own the Commodore flagship you'll be more than chuffed with this effort. A lot of time has been spent on the graphics and the animation and detail are very impressive. The music and sound effects are less than brilliant, but My everything Cakes! hangs together nicely and the overall result is nice and sharp. This game won't win any prizes for originality, but as an arcade blast it's a hoot. An interesting departure for Electronic Arts and well worth 25 quid of anyone's money! CVG 028 FRANK O'CONNOR THROUGH THE KEYHOLE To get through the various levels of Risky Woods you'll have to collect a whole load of keys. These are scattered all over the levels and open doors usually located near to them.

"GVC MEGADRIVE completely Batty! PINBALL REDIGÉIGIE &2860 BY HOT B .00 3:05 The first thing you'll notice about Bad Omen is the use of two bats. The first bat works just like Arkanoid and stays at the bottom of the screen but the second is a bit of a wild card. You can move it up and down as well as left and right but it always stays right above the main bat. Best of all, you can flip it onto its side allowing you to knock the ball around at some very peculiar angles. This can be very useful when you can't quite reach those last few blocks. It takes a little while to get used to controlling two bats at once, but once you master it the game takes on a whole new light. SeriCES Cara 110N Ball Busting baddies Throughout the game you'll encounter wandering nasties who deflect the ball at ridiculous angles and often at high speed. If you hit the baddies often enough they'll be destroyed, endowing you with those oh-so-valuable points. End of level monsters also make an appearance and these must be hit dozens of times before you can progress to the next level. The blocks can aid you at this point because some explode to reveal useful power ups including one pod which turns your ball into a destructive soaring dragon. Now that's style! scrolling thunder As you destroy the blocks, the screen scrolls upwards to reveal more blocks and more hazards. The scrolling can be a real pain and sometimes it's hard to keep track of the ball. This not only gives you something more to worry about, it also reveals more of the spectacular background graphics. The vertical scrolling adds a new dimension to the theme but at certain points in the various levels the screen scrolls horizontally too. At this point you have to use the flip option on the bat and knock the ball left and right as well as straight up on the air. The horizontal sections are by far the most difficult and can make things quite infuriating. Bumboils! Vay back in the mists of video game history appeared a game which would change the face of arcades forever. Simple, addictive and infuriatingly difficult, that game was Breakout. The object was simple use a bat and ball to destroy a wall of bricks at the top of the screen. The concept died when newer and more sophisticated games came along to take its place. Then, in the mid eighties, Taito released Arkanoid. This used exactly the same gameplay style, albeit with tarted up graphics and the then obligatory power-ups. The simplistic nature of the game had arcade fans going crazy and Arkanoid was a smash hit. Bad Omen is Arkanoid gone mad. More Screens scrolling, twin bats and a host of killer zombies. The Megadrive arrived just after the Arkanoid craze of the late eighties and Sega owners haven't had a decent version of the classic game until now. Bad Omen takes the theme a couple of steps further with some awesome graphics and a few new tweaks to the brilliant gameplay. The graphics are very scary and atmospheric and in many ways similar to Devil Crash. The clock tower stage is my favourite with loads of cranking cogs and spinning wheels. The music is by the same bloke who did Strider on the Megadrive and as a result it's superb, suiting the game to a tee. The gameplay is very simple and very addictive and includes some novel new features. All in all this is a great cross between breakout and pinball and a worthy addition to any Megadrive owner's collection. 1:58 :00 STRATEGY SKILL GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE % 90 % 92 % 86 % 86 87 ACTION REFLEXES FRANK O'CONNOR CVG 031 "


"GUE REVIEW. DVE TUL LUO 2030 SUPER NINTENDO SHOOT 'EM UP BY  .00 ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST! SUPERFAST SPRITE SCALING! In a far distant galaxy, an alien world seethes with malevolent intelligence. Twisted space fiends are planning the downfall of Earth. They have amassed a huge fleet of starships and even now are preparing to launch an attack on our planet. It's time for Super Aleste! This rather smart spaceship has some quite stupidly powerful weaponry at its disposal. The brave pilot chosen for this mission is you (as bloody usual), but fear not, assistance will be provided when you need it most. So, arm your weapons, stoke up the engines and fill your pants because only a miracle is going to save you now! Hardened SNES owners will notice very quickly how fast the sprites are on Super Aleste. Nothing slows down, ever! Megadrive owners will poop their pants when they see just how fast the SNES actually is. Zillions of sprites whizz around and bullets pepper the skies. End of level baddies are monstrous combo-sprites and again, superfast. Level 2 will have you reaching for the sick-bag as a massive space structure rotates and expands in the background! It's very confusing, but damned impressive! SUPER ALESTE A WIBBLY WOBBLY WORLD OF THEIR OWN THE TRANQUILITY OF AN ALIEN PARADISE IS SHATTERED BY PHOTON INDUCED VIOLENCE! HURRAH! Yup, it's the amazing SNES hardware again. An effect that has been used before, is a thing called raster wobbling. It's not really called raster wobbling, but that's as good a name as any. The effect makes the backgrounds go all wibbly and confusing. You may have seen it on games like Thunderforce and Gynoug. The SNES goes a bit mad on that score and the effect can be seen on most levels, with some having multiple layers of it. It looks dead dreamy but it doesn't half make your eyes go funny. Gunhed is one of my favourite games ever and as this is a sort of Gunhed remix, I'm dead chuffed! This is actually bigger than Gunhed, with twelve massive levels to blast through. The graphics are fast and spectacular and the music features some brilliant New Order rip-offs. If you like your shoot 'em ups stupidly fast and extremely difficult, this is a challenge that you won't be able to resist. This could well be the best vertical scroller ever and it's without a doubt the best blast on the SNES. You might be tempted by the big names of Super R-Type and Gradius, but this is easily the best of the bunch and you'd be a fool to miss it! CVG 032 FRANK O'CONNOR "


"REVIEW GUE SPELOg THIS BABY MAKES THE STEALTH FIGHTER LOOK LIKE A SOPWITH CAMEL! Here it is the shoot 'em up addict's dream    true! Up until now you could only play Gunhed on the PC Engine and that was almost worth buying the machine for! This time round the SNES version is bigger than the original, and has to rank as one of the best blasters you'll see on the big Nintendo for ages! Smart graphics and a rocking soundtrack are just the icing on the cake because this ultra-fast little beauty plays like a dream and there's plenty of challenge to keep you at it for ages. This is just the sort of game we want on the SNES, so grab it as quick as fast as you possibly can or stay sad and left out for ever! SHOT FROM BOTH SIDES! TIM BOONE GLORIOUS GUNHED GOODIES! Toho, the company who programmed Super Aleste, have to their credit one of the best shoot 'em ups ever. Gunhed appeared on the PC Engine about four years ago and featured some of the most stunning blasting action ever seen on a home console. The graphics were ace, the sound was awesome and the game played like a dream. Super Aleste, you will be pleased to know, is a sort of Gunhed remix with similar weapons, identical gameplay and vastly improved graphics. Credit is due to Toho for this one, because Gunhed sold more PC Engines than any other game (with the possible exception of PC Kid). WEAPONRY WEIRDNESS STRATEGY SKILL All the weapons in Super Aleste have been borrowed from the original Gunhed game. These include spreading machine guns, wibbly lasers, homing missiles, humungous globules of death and a sort of R-Type beam-up variant. The weapons come in stages of power, starting off a bit whiffy, but collecting coloured capsules increases their power gradually. You can also pick up multiples, shields and best of all, smart bombs. The smart bombs seem to pop up all the time, but when you really need them, they mysteriously vanish! ACTION REFLEXES GRAPHICS % SOUND % GAMEPLAY VALUE 92 90 OVERALL 92 CVG 033 "

Judging from the size of our mailbag, it seems that everyone and their mum wanted to get their mitts on Nintendo's amazing new machine. There were some totally amazing entries and choosing the winners took hours. We said we'd print 'em so let's get on with it, eh? Incidentally, Tim liked the compo so much we've given away another two machines check out Word Up to find out who's got 'em!

BY SEGA .99 AZ-MA \"he scourge of the cartoon world and Bugs Bunny's nemesis, the Tasmanian Devil is on the loose again only this time he's a goody! The furious ball of fur is on the loose and he's got his own TV series. This game is linked to the new American cartoon show and features Taz and the rest of the Devil family. Playing the part of Taz you have to seek out some giant bird most eggs to feed your excellent, starving family. These are located dudes! hundreds of miles away across dangerous terrain There are more than a few platform including valgames of this ilk available on the leys, rivers and Megadrive and if you don't fancy Taz glaciers. Are you're spoiled for choice. Obvious number one choice is Sega's own you really that Sonic but others include the fabulous hungry? You bet Magical Hat Turbo Flying Adventure you are! (Decappattack in this country), the awesome Strider, the utterly stupendous Mickey Mouse and the more than reasonable Kid Chameleon. Mind you, if you don't like the look of Taz you're obviously off your bloomin' rocker! www Taz is one of the most dangerous critters in the cartoon world and he kicks ass whenever there's trouble. He can jump on the heads of oncoming baddies and this kills them stone dead. Better still though, he can turn his body into a whirling typhoon of spinning death. You can do this as often as you like and really rack up bonus points by knocking down loads of baddies in succession. Hurrah! 89983823 ixs Quite simply this has to be the best looking Megadrive game ever! Sure, you've seen Megadrive games with smarter effects, bigger sprites and spectacular scrolling, but Taz looks exactly like a cartoon. The only game to have achieved this before was Atari's Road Runner. The sprites are big and bouncy and the backdrops are straight out of a loony tunes cartoon! The music also is cartoon-perfect, with ridiculous tunes and brilliant samples from the cartoon series. Just watch what happens when you leave Taz standing still! The platform gameplay is very simple and very addictive and this is the only real contender for Sonic's throne on the Megadrive. It doesn't quite beat old Sonic, but it's not far off!

"s, REVIEW CVE 300 CVG Uh-oh... SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN... EDESEver wanted to take part in your favourite cartoon? Well wait no longer because now you can! There are tons of games which promise cartoon quality graphics and never quite manage to deliver, but Tazmanian Devil is exactly that the closest thing yet to a totally interactive cartoon! The graphics and sound are so incredibly good you'd almost swear you were watching the telly, not playing the game! Taz himself is quite awesomely lifelike and one helluva mean boyo to boot, which means you're guaranteed huge laughs as you explore his massive world. Initially this game is a complete gobsmacker and really shows what the Megadrive can do when you push it. The game does become just a touch repetitive after a while, but then again this is one of the most ambitious console games ever and a spectacular success. Grab it as soon as you can! TIM BOONE RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS There are no extra weapons as such in Tazmania, but there arequite a lot of chilli peppers lying around. Scoffing one of these causes Taz to go bright red and he can then fire up to five blasts of flame from his mouth. This is useful for offing baddies you don't want to get too close to. There are usually two or three of these peppers on every level, so be careful how you use them. It's worth collecting them just to see the expression on Taz's face when he scoffs one! STRATEGY SKILL Taz has an energy bar at the top of the screen which is reduced every time he collides with a baddie. You can replenish your energy supply by collecting the various bits of food that are scattered throughout the levels (fried chicken is his favourite). Energy can drop quite quickly and you can normally take about three serious hits before you snuff it, so collect as much food as you possibly can. The question is, if there's so much food around, why doesn't he take that back to his family? ACTION REFLEXES 96 KILL TAZ!

What is the most, do you reckon, the Game Boy is worth and the same question to the Super NES? 2. I don't think Game Gears are worth wiping your ass with, but what do you think of them? 3. Would you please, please, please send me some money towards my Super Nintendo fund? I am not asking for a lot, like all them people with sad accents in Australia and Newcastle. Andrew J Hadston, Watton, Liverpool. YOB: 1. Depends. I asked my Super NES but it wouldn't answer. 2.1 think they're the greatest Sega hand-helds ever. 3. What do you call a Scouser in a house? A burglar. A Scouser in a suit? The Accused. A Scouser with half a brain? Gifted. Next... "


"OVER THE HILL Dear YOB, I have been reading CVG mag for about eight years now (the first mag 1 bought has all the soap stars on the front). I started with a ZX81 and moved up to the Amiga 500. I've seen the mag go through many changes since then and new staff come and go, and now with the inclusion of GO! it's the best it's ever been. Well done to all concerned. A couple of questions though. 1. Why don't you stop printingreader's pictures in which they simply trace staff's faces from the review panels and stick them onto famous console character's bodies? 2. Do you think the Super Nintendo will take off like the Megadrive? 3. Why do you dislike the Australians so much? 4. Why don't you take the place of Patrick Moore on Gamesmaster and brutally rip the lungs out of small children who can't get off World One of Marioland? John Abbott, Harrogate, North Yorks. 1 Why don't you put your head in a septic tank? 2. It already has. 3. Because they know how to take a joke. You obviously don't because you're as useful as a eunach in a sperm bank. 4. Because I'm having too much fun ripping the P out of you. TEMPERATURE RISING Dear YOBBO, I think your mag stinks. If you lot learnt (Whoops YOB) how to write properly it may (Whoops YOB) make things a bit better. But as it stands you'd have to have the mentality of three year old (Whoops YOB) to actually learn any grammar you! (Whoops YOB). The design's alright, but it still looks like third-hand bog roll (especially on the paper you use!). (Whoops YOB). All in all I think CVG is dull and uninformative, I (Whoops YOB) won't buy it again. Stephen Lynch, Camden, London. YOB: Please, if you're going to try and complain at least do it properly. Learn how to string two words together or I won't be able to read your pathetic excuse for a letter and formulate a suitably senseless reply. PASS THAT CORK, NURSE Dear YOB, A couple of CVG's ago there was the April fool about the home virtual reality kit called the Holostar 2000. I spotted straight away that it was Sega's 3D glasses and the remote control reciever for the Megadrive or Master System and a console with it's lid off (maybe a PC Engine). The Daily Mirror's computer page Power Up! (enc) failed to see it was an April fool and printed it on their computer page in the TV weekly magazine. They obviously stole the informatation from CVG so I would sue the Daily Mirror and give me half the money. Adrian Reed, Eltham, London. YOB: I've just heard there's going to be a new cart for the Holostar Daily Mirror Simulator. It's a cracker of a game in which you get all your facts wrong, lift wind-ups from great mags and print them as facts and generally wander about looking a bit sad because some fat fart pinched your pension fund. Good, eh? vitaval BIT OF A BIRD BRAIN Dear YOB, I sometimes sit and look out of my window at the little birdies eating peanuts off my amazing peanut dispenser and I wonder what life must be like for those little birdies no Nintendo, no Sega, not even a measly GX4000. I often think of poisoning my peanuts to put them out of their misery they must suffer with no consoles to come and play on. But no, why should I? They seem to be perfectly happy without a console, although God knows why. No console? What a horrible thought! How would I live? I'm not saying that my life depends on having a Gamegear constantly at my side, but I still think I nee one. Write your views on the subject. See how horrid it is for birdies. Paul \"Cat Vomit\" McParlin, Aberystwyth, Wales. YOB: Who needs a console when you can stand around and laugh at some sad sap whilst eating the stupid jerk's peanuts. Don't know about you, but that's my idea of a good time... DEFINITELY DISORDERED Dear YOB, I have been collecting CVG for the last couple of months and I think it's brill. You really do have some awful letters. I do hope you don't think this one is awful, I have been wishing and entering all kinds of competitions all the time, just to win a Lynx, but I never do win. Please, Please, Please, could you send me a hundred quid to buy an Atari Lynx. Michael and Darrell Beasley, Oxley, Wolverhampton. YOB: Let's start a new competition how not to win anything. Whoever can send in the best letter how to do it will win nothing at all. And anyone who can be even more stupid than writing I when there are two of you stands most chance of winning it. "

HALLUCINATING FREQUENTLY Dear YOB, I am a proud owner of an Amiga 500 and have a fair selection of games. I read your mag monthly and I read about how Megadrives are so top and blah, blah. So myfriend, who owns a Megadrive lent me his with Sonic, Monanco, DJ Boy and Quackshot. I'd like just to get off my chest that Megadrive's are so full of crap that I wouldn't consider wiping my dog's ass with one and that gets dirty. People say that there is a competition between the Amiga and Megadrive. What competition? There isn't one, Amiga wins every time. So, YOB and all you other sad Megadrive owners, keep buying your crap games, you may as well flush your cash down the crapper. So, YOB if you don't print this letter I know that you know crappy Smegadrives are so full of horse dung you could grow cabbages on them.

It's the game played all over the world and is easily the most popular team sport ever. Every single major country in the world has a soccer league and it even looks set to replace baseball as Japan's most important sport. As a result, everyone and their mum is releasing a soccer game in Japan at the moment and Jaleco's Super Cup Soccer is one of the main contenders.

They basic kicks available in Super Cup include Super Soccer a strange Soccer lob, pass and shoot. The 3D sim with some interesting mode lob sends the ball very high in the 7 graphics and fairly standard air and can be a useful strategic gameplay. Hat Trick Hero very pass.

Shoot Soccer and let's hope they sort out is self explanatory and is undoubtall the problems with the first one. edly the easiest way to score. BE impossideed but laugh. iyer game na od BETTER THAN A POKE IN THE EYE! A GOOD KICKING!?! I like a bit of console footie and this is a bit of a treat because the game is extremely fast and features some reasonably smart graphics. The different viewpoints as you score a goal are a nice addition but do little to enhance the gameplay. As a one player game, Super Cup is a good laugh. It starts off very easy indeed but soon becomes darn near impossible! In two player mode though, the fun really begins. Playing against a mate is a real hoot and discovering the tricks and tactics will keep you engrossed for hours. There are a few faults s however, including the rather sad animation and the lack of options. There are loads of trick shots a vailable, including overhead kicks, diving headers and sliding tackles. Top stuff generally and easily the best SNES football game to date. Strictly for soccer fans and two player teams though. When a player is fouled a message pops up on screen proclaiming the word «Kicking.\" Well, don't blame us it's a Japanese game. Anyway, nobody ever gets sent off but you do get a free kick. Even weirder is that sometimes when a goal kick is awarded, the goalie vanishes and the kick is taken by a player! Stranger still, when a throw in is awarded, the player always throws it to the opposition.

It's Crucial, it's Official and it's Only in CVG! HIIH "


"GVG HYOSHI'S ISLAND The start point of the game where Yoshi's house is located. There are six levels on Yoshi's Island, including the Yellow Switch Palace (a good place to experiment with switches). Yoshi's Island is fairly easy and introduces you to the main features of the game, teaching you how to control Mario and what to look for. 000000 0000 OOOO000000 AT LAST OOKOOS OOO 000 CEDOOOO DO000 It's the game Nintendo fans have all been waiting for Super Mario World! After saving the Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser, Mario and Luigi decide to take a well earned holiday in Dinosaur Land. No sooner have they put their feet up than they discover that Princess Toadstool has gone missing! Surely the evil Bowser wouldn't dare kidnap her again! It's up to Mario and Luigi to find out and search the massive Dinosaur Kingdom until they find her! TEET DONUT DIPLAINS The Donut Plains are a little more difficult than Yoshi's Island and you can make good use of both Yoshi and the Cape on this section. This is the first level to include secret exits and the truly horrible Ghost House! There are two major secret areas located on and in the Donut Plains, but they take an age to find. You will also encounter the very useful Green Switch Palace, but that's enough about that! MARIO GUIDE 2 "


"GVG VANILLA DOME Vanilla Dome is one of the creepiest areas of the game and most of the action takes place underground. It's here that the game starts to become really tough! There are plenty of tricks to learn and quite a few secret areas, the most important of which is Star Road. Use it to your advantage and, who knows, you might complete the game quicker! TWIN BRIDGES A very odd area this, with underwater antics and aerial acrobatics coming into play. Your platform skills will be tested to the limit as you leap and soar across some fairly huge chasms. Yoshi is an invaluable aid at this point and if you lose him here it's well worth returning to Vanilla Dome or the Donut Plains just to find him again! Flying is important too and there are a few areas where the Cape is vital. It's reasonably difficult, bordering on well hard, and there's no Switch TITUTE 3 MARIO GUIDE "


"CVG FOREST HOF ILLUSION sido mm One of the most complicated areas of the game and absolutely jam-packed with secret items and levels. Another Star Road is located here, but a bit too close to Roy's Castle for comfort. There are a couple of stunningly difficult levels, including the ridiculously hard Forest Of Illusion 3. This one really seperates the men from the boys and the Ghost House will have you tearing your hair out! ODO YOSHI SECRETS Yoshi is Mario's new pal and what a hero he is! Yoshi can be found hidden in eggs and when hatched he will allow Mario to ride on his back. The little dinosaur is a very cool customer and he can duff baddies with the best of them. He has much tougher feet than Mario, can stomp on some baddies that Mario can't and even eats them by flicking out his tongue like a frog! Eating some baddies allows Yoshi to shoot fireballs from his mouth, while others will let him fly for a short time or even cause an earthquake! Best of all, if you find some special wings Yoshi can fly further and higher than Mario with his cape. This is the best way to find certain secret exits and a real laugh to boot! Yoshi provides Mario with all kinds of protection and the two look, set to become firm pals! In fact, rumours abound that Yoshi may have his own game very soon! which leads to the amazing Special World. Special world contains eight of the most impressive and fun levels in the game. Complete all eight and you gain access to the mysterious Star There are two amazingly secret worlds Road Seven. Follow this road and you'll hidden in Super Mario World and they are discover something very, very special extremely difficult to find. The first is Star indeed! World and it works in two very specific ways. Once you find it (having collected the necessary keys from various levels) it can be used as a shortcut to every level except Yoshi's Island. Star World also contains five very difficult levels, one of MARIO GUIDE 4 "


"PVC CHOCOLATE HISLAND With loads and loads of hills, this area is packed full of gravity-defying danger as you try to control Mario on some very slippery slopes! The theme is chocolate and the graphics reflect it everything is a lovely brown colour and it all looks good enough to eat! Chocolate Island is the area that stands between you and the ultimate showdown in... ozgu THE POWER HTHE VALLEY OF BOWSER The final level of Super Mario World and the location of your final battle with the twisted and evil Bowser King of the Koopas! An incredible task awaits you as you attempt to solve brainteasing puzzles. This is easily the most difficult section of them all and just wait until you get a load of Bowser! As in the previous games, Mario can collect a range of items which improve his already astounding abilities. Best of all is the cape, which endows Mario with almost unlimited flying power. To get this fine piece of kit, all you have to do is collect a feather and these can be found in almost every area. The cape can be used in many ways, allowing Mario to leap great heights. Once airborne you can control Mario and make him fily properly by moving the direction pad making him bob and glide. From this position Mario can dive-bomb baddies using his belly as a weapon but remember you'll need a fairly long run-up to take off! Mario also has a special spinning jump, he doesn't jump quite as high but he can destroy enemies with this spin. The spin can also destroy certain kinds of blocks making some levels a whole lot easier! Mario starts life as a little bloke but he can grow a bit by eating special mushrooms. Being large also works a bit like an extra life. If he's hit when he's large he doesn't die, he just shrinks! Fire Flowers allow Mario to lob fireballs at the enemy and this way you don't have to get too close! 5 MARIO GUIDE "


"GVG MARIO MANIA THE MANY DONKEY KONG M ario has appeared over the years in many forms and an astonishing 21 games! The Brooklyn Plumber has been Nintendo's mascot for more than ten years and in that time he has become the most famous video game character of all time, with a cartoon series, breakfast cereal and even a telephone bearing his name! What's the appeal? Well, for one thing he's cute! His rosy cheeked smile and big blue eyes make him an ideal cartoon character. Mario was responsible for the first ever arcade platform game, Donkey Kong, and as a result platform games are easily the most popular video game genre. So let's take you through his amazing history! The first Mario game turned up in arcades in the very early eighties and took the world by storm. The first plat, form game, it featured four screens of barrel rolling, baddie-hammering fun as Mario tried to defeat the evil Donkey Kong! This game introduced most of the features that are now standard in most platform games including ladders, lifts and even power-ups. This is brilliant stuff and can still be found in dusty old seaside arcades around the country. If you can't find a machine then you'll be pleased to know that it's available as one of the games on the Donkey Kong Classics cart for the NES. Why was it called Donkey Kong? Apparently it was a misprint on the instructions Nintendo sent to American distributors. It should have been called Monkey Kong! DONKEY KONG JNR SUPER MARIO BROS MARIO BROS The second Mario game and the only one to feature Mario as a baddie! Mario has captured Donkey Kong and it's up to Donkey Kong Jnr to rescue his daddy! The baby baoon and his nappies have to traverse four danger-packed levels of swing vines and egg-dropping birds as he tries to free his dad. Spot-on timing and pixel perfect jumping are the order of the day as you try to open dad's cage. This game was much more difficult than it's predecessor and it's very rare to find one in even the most obscure arcade. Again you can play this on the Donkey Kong Classics cart and it's a real hoot! Not only does Mario return as a hero, but his brother Luigi makes his debut! This is the simplest of the Mario games but possibly the most addictive! All the action takes place on one screen as Mario and his brother try to rid a plumbing system of turtles and other critters. Pipes make this interesting because once you enter them, there's no telling where you'll end up! This game introduced Mario's now famous block busting ability as you try to upturn the turtles by bashing the ground beneath their feet. Mario purists would argue that this is the best of the bunch. A bit of strategy, a bit of teamwork and a whole lot of fun! The game that made Mario and the game that made Nintendo the international giant they are today. Nintendo saw an opening in the computer games market and released the Famicom (NES) bundled with the amazing Super Mario Bros. The game was an instant and unprecedented hit, selling machines by the bucketload. As a result, one in three Japanese homes now have a Famicom. Years later, Nintendo released the Famicom over here calling it the Nintendo Entertainment System. Again Mario was bundled with the machine and after a while the hilarious platform antics won over the British market. Huge levels, eight worlds, supersmooth scrolling...how could it fail? MARIO GUIDE 6 "


"CVG WORLDS OF SUPER MARIO BROS 3 SUPER MARIO BROS 2 A bit strange this one, but nonetheless excellent. The scrolling platform action was similar to the first Super Mario Bros, but with more variety. For a start you have a choice of four characters, each with differing strengths and abilities. The heroes are Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and the less than glamorous Toad. You can switch characters between levels and an element of strategy comes into play. It's a huge game and in many ways the most complex of the lot. First appearances suggest that this may be a weak link in the Mario chain, but perseverance reveals a brilliant and challenging game! The best of the 8-bit Mario games and a return to the more simplistic nature of Super Mario Bros 1. The platform antics of Mario and Luigi have been enhanced by some special graphics and sound chips built in to the cart. Amazing colours and all new abilities for Mario make this a real winner. Mario encounters new foes in the bratty Koopa Kids (Bowser's children) and he must battle his way through the Mushroom Kingdom defeating them one at a time. Loads of new features including hilarious bonus screens made this CVG's highest scoring game ever, with a nigh-on impossible 98% rating and unheard-of six page review! Could this be the best video SUPER MARIO WORLD DR MARIO The biggest, the brightest, and some say the best of the lot. Super Mario World is the flagship game on the Super NES. Again it uses the same game style as Super Mario Bros 1, but with some amazing graphics, superb sound and a massive 96 levels! More secret screens, more hidden items and more danger than you can shake a stick at as Mario and Luigi try to overcome the soldiers of the evil King Koopa with help in Dinosaur Land from the friendly Yoshi. There's months of gameplay in this cart and the fact that it comes free with the Super Nintendo makes it the best bar gain ever! Completely different to any other Mario game, this title owes more to Tetris than to the rest of the series. Mario dons a stethoscope to rid a screen of viruses by matching multicoloured vitaminpills. The lack of platform action may put Mario lovers off, but that would be a big mistake. There are loads of ways to score, plenty of bonuses (including secret treasures) and months and months of gameplay. A really challenging variant on the puzzle theme and just what the doctor ordered! SUPER MARIO LAND Bundling Tetris with the Gameboy made the little hand-held a sure-fire hit, but Nintendo would have done just as well if they'd included Super Mario Land. It's a scaled down version of Super Mario Bros 1, with all new levels, some amazing baddies and brilliant new features. The Kingdom of Sarasaland is in trouble and Mario sets out to save it on sea, land and air. Superb horizontal blasting sections add a whole new dimension to the series as Mario takes to the sea in a submarine and fends off airborne baddies in a jetplane. The game that every Gameboy owner has to have! Now that Nintendo have outdone themselves with Super Mario World, how can they possibly follow it up? There are lots of rumours about the new CD ROM unit for the SNES and it may be that Mario's next big outing will appear on CD. Shigeru Miyamoto, the man who designed the Mario games says that he doesn't know if there'll be another Super Mario Bros sequel, but he does promise \"There's something very special in the pipeline.\" Rest assured CVG will tell you about it first! 7 MARIO GUIDE "

"SUPER NINTENDO 00 SUPER MARIO WORLD There's so much secret stuff to find in the brill Super Mario World that we can fill an eightpage guide AND stick the odd tip in Cheat Mode too! Thanks to Jim Swan and Danny Phillips of Exmouth, Devon, for this one (which I found as well but didn't want to take the credit for.) Once you have completed the Ghost House in Forest Of Illusion, go down the path that has just appeared and enter the new level. Complete the level once and get back to the map screen again. Go back to the newly-completed level and, just as you start the stage you'll see a cloud with a 1-UP mushroom hanging from it. Collect the 1-UP and press START and SELECT together to leave the level. Now return to that stage again and pick up a 1-UP from exactly the same place. You can do this as many times as you like. SUPER R-TYPE Those end-level bosses are very tasty when it comes to blowing your little R9 fighter into a trillion bits, which is why it's not a bad idea to check out the following guardian-smashing tips from Daniel Perera from Berkhamstead, Herts. ILLUMINATOR: Send the force out to the bottom right-hand side of the screen and, instead of firing normal shots, use power-up blasts. ZABTOM: Make sure that you have the anti-air laser before you reach Zabtom. Shoot at the eye on his face after a while the face will be blown off. Send the force to just slightly underneath his mouth. The only way he has of attacking are the mega-flashes from his chest. Build up your power gauge until it flashes, wait for him to fire a mega-flash, get as close to his chest as you can and fire. INEXIS: As soon as Inexis is fully on the screen build up the power gauge till it flashes, get as close to the eye as you can and fire. PRISONER: Before you try to reach him, attempt to get the shooting gun laser. Try to take out the four guns before you actually attack him then aim for the lenses. Once you have destroyed both lasers, position your ship at the bottom-right of the screen. Wait there while he fires at you and build up your power gauge. When he stops firing, shoot the eye. RIOS: Get as close to the eye as you can. Dodge the walls and shoot at the eye by building up the power gauge. RECYCLER: Before he appears on the screen, position the force on the back of your ship. Do not use the force, just fire like hell. Try to get into the middle of him. WOOM: Shoot the ships out of the Woom's grasp and then shoot at the wall before the baby. When it opens, build up the power gauge and shoot. Repeat the procedure to complete the game. Bogunovun CHEAT MODE PC ENGINE PARODIUS This has to be one of the best blasts ever seen on any machine, never mind the little Engine. And now, thanks to Daniel Lailam from Hounslow, Middlesex, it's just that bit less difficult to play! Choose manual power-up and, during the game, press RUN to pause. Then push UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT on the direction pad. Then press button Il followed by button to give you a fully powered-up ship. To get more credits, simply press SELECT and keep it held while quickly pressing button I. "


"GVC GVG REV 00012175 MEGADRIVE PLATFORM BY VIRGIN .99 WHAT'S GREEN AND EATS NUTS? Dinosaurs! The things that made life so difficult for Racquel Welch in One Million Years BC were dinosaurs. (Well, there was the fact that she kept falling over forwards but enough of that.) These green skinned weirdoes spent most of their time eating little things and fighting bigger things. Worst of all was Tyrasomething Rex, which had rows and rows of sharp teeth which it used to tear flesh and rend muscle from bone. Then there was the Flyadacty which, um, flew about a lot and ate little things too. The pair of them would have drunk Carling Black Label and both were well hard. The dinosaurs in Chuck Rock can be both good and bad. Most of them want to eat you alive but the odd dinosaur can be fooled into giving you a ride accross a chasm or lake. What a thickie, eh? 1e's hairy, he's fat and he chucks n rocks. He's Chuck Rock the beer-bellied prehistoric oaf in search of adventure, food and a bit of a laugh! So fat is this bumbling caveman that he must eat over three hundred chickens a day just to stay alive and it's your task to guide El Fatso through a world inhabited by fearsome dinosaurs and all sorts of horrible plant life. Eat every morsel you can find and kill any bad guy unfortunate to cross your path, because a huge expanse of platform problems and rock chucking action awaits. Watch out for the fiendish traps and puzzles strewn accross the landscape, just waiting to bump off our hapless hairy hero. A bit of strategy and adventure comes into play here and there are some real brain teasers to addle your thick head. Chuck rocks! 000/COM BOULDER DASH! Chuch Rock's most useful tools are rocks. These come in various shapes and sizes and can be used for a multitude of purposes. Firstly and perhaps least importantly they can be used as weapons. If you pull down and press fire, Chuck will pick up a boulder. Pressing fire again hurls the boulder at any unfortunate baddie. The rocks can also be used as platforms, enabling Chuck to reach otherwise inaccessable areas of the screen. When you come accross a slime pit or lava pond, you can use the rocks as a very temporary bridge! Hurrah! en WW Co2771229 BEER BELLY BOZO Having failed completely to learn any martial arts, Chuck has to rely on his secret weapon. Thirty years of drinking foul-smelling prehistoric brew have given him a gut of huge proportions, which he can use to belly-butt marauding dinosaurs off the screen calling for careful timing and spot-on precision! If baddies attack whilst Chuck is airborne he can unleash a slightly less than spectacular flying kick. This deals with the little baddies well enough, but for anything larger you'll have to use the rocks. Bummer! STRATEGY SKILL I like a bit of platform malarkey and this game takes us back to the olden days of jumping japery! Chuck Rock first appeared on ST and Amiga and it was a real treat with frantic action and hilarious graphics making the game a sure-fire hit. This is a fine conversion of the game, with plenty of brain teasers and lots of fun. Graphically this loses out on other games of the genre including the likes of Strider and Toki bu they still work well for the game. Sound is excellent, with lots of samples and hilarious tunes, and gameplay is a bit of a treat. This is pure arcade stuff and a great buy for fans of the original Amiga game. Mind you, there's a lot of competition in this field so it's worth shopping around first. CVG 060 FRANK O'CONNOR GRAPHICS SOUND GAMEPLAY VALUE OVERALL % % % % 86 ACTION REFLEXES 86 "

"CVE REVIEW SEREN/WW 187225 259 GVA AMIGA HAIRY HORRORS! PLATFORM BY DI/LORICIELS .99 These days a game just isn't a game unless there's a great big monster waiting for you at the end of every level. Jim Power is no exception and after you've traversed the platforms and wasted the little monsters, you have to pit your wits and firepower against huge baddies. Instead of walking and jumping at this point, you don a jetpack and fly around while the oversized goon tries his best to kill you. Well, what else would you expect him to do? CRIKEY! BADDIES DON'T COME MUCH BIGGER THAN THIS GEEZER! MIND YOU, HE LOOKS JUST AS SCARED OF YOU! KICK HIS SATANIC ASS BEFORE ITS TOO LATE! M ore intelligent than Einstein, more muscular than Arnie and sexier than Tom Cruise but that's enough about me, what about Jim Power? Poor old Mr Power has found himself in the unfortunate position of having to save the Universe. It seems that some demon has taken over the infamous Mutant Planet, not only that, he's also kidnapped your girl. If you can't find him and destroy him in time, he'll turn your gorgeous babe into a nine-tentacled space freak and you'd better get tooled up \"cos this looks like the rumble to end all rumbles. Die, filthy alien space dung! WEAPON RELATED WONDER! As with most games of this type, Jim Power features a host of extra weapons to pick up. These boost your firepower, giving you extra wide shots as well as vertical fire. The good thing is that you don't lose these weapons after you die. Just as well because you really need those power-ups on later levels. It's a shame that all the addons work the same way, because a little variety would have been nice. As it is, all the power-ups work in exactly the same way. 883420 SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE HERO \"Jim Power will undoubtedly be compared to the likes of Turrican and Gods, but that's no bad thing. The Amiga is a bit short of decent platform shooters and so this comes as a welcome addition to the genre. The graphics are bright and colourful, with some original baddies and brilliant platform puzzles. The music is funky and the sampled speech works extremely well. All in all it's a right old laugh and a fairly big challenge. Some of the end of level baddies are groovy bordering on the spectacular and the game has a nice console feel to it. Certainly better than Gods and a musthave for Amiga platform fans.\" Jim Power has a rather novel smart bomb. By collecting certain potions, he can turn himself into a raging nuclear furnace. He starts to glow uncontrollably as you hold down the fire button and letting go unleashes a massive explosion. It destroys aliens and impresses girls, but it's not very good for your trousers. It's a good idea to save the smart bombs for the end of level badTHERE ARE LOADS OF EXTRA WEAPONS dies though and save yourself a TO PICK UP AND YOU'LL NEED THEM TOO! lot of laser related trouble...

It's up to you lot to prove to me that Amiga owners aren't low-scoring sad cases by sending in your best efforts, like Giles Fellingham of Avon, who's obviously a bit of a lad and well on the ball.

Unless you lot start bucking your ideas up I'm going to have to put you across my knee and force you to play Pitfighter on the Famicom or watch cookery videos for a week. So what are you waiting for? Rack up those High Scores and fire off those forms in my general direction. Make sure they're good though, otherwise I'll have to get strict...

"GVG TRANSMISSION SELECT AUTOMATIC 4 SPEED MANUAL 7 SPEED MANUAL GUG REVIEW Ayrton Sennas SUPER MONACO DOWN NOT USEGA MEGADRIVE ACIONAL SPORT SIM BY SEGA .99 doo POSITI POSITION: 147 LAP 1/3 e con DEP AUTOMATIC He's a lean, mean driving machine, he's got lots of dosh, he's from Brazil and he sometimes gives Nigel Mansell a bit of a headache. He's Ayrton Senna and he's put his name and face to Sega's latest sequel! This is basically Super Monaco Grand Prix 2 with knobs on and a fair few knobs at that! The first game saw you racing round a selection of Grand Prix tracks with the objective of coming first, and strangely enough that's the aim this time round! BURNING RUBBER As you tear around the various tracks your car comes in for some serious wear and tear. Tyres are the first to suffer the heat of the tracks and the constant skidding ruins the rubber. Engines can overheat, causing problems with acceleration and top speed and body panels can be damaged making roadholding and crashing very perilous indeed. Fortunately you can pit stop at various intervals during the race. You can stop as many times as you like and a welltrained pit crew will fix your car as fast as they can. You pay a time penalty for all this stoppage though, so judge your pit stops carefully and use them when it's absolutely essential! 157 kny 66886 POSITION LAP 1/3 A Winner!) *bble Spa AUTOMATIC OTH PRELIMINAR GRAND PRIX 2 H ELLER 109 TOP GEAR! HERE...WAIT AMINUTE.. Super Monaco still ranks one of the best racers on the Megadrive, right up there with the likes of Road Rash and Super Hang On. However it has to be said that this sequel is quite a disappointment because it's much too close to the original game! Graphically and sonically superb, it knocks spots off almost every other Megadrive title with fine presentation and a massive range of options. Gameplay is excellent too bril liantly fluid and very challenging. Trouble is, it's so close to the same game you'll be pushed to find the difference. This isn't a problem if you haven't got the first game, but tons of you have! Just like the sequel to Golden Axe, Sega have stuck rigidly to the original and bolted on a few goodies here and there to try and juystify the price tag. The result is a truly great game for first-time Super Monaco racers, but a real letdown for the veterans. Make no mistake. this is a great game, but I'd strongly recommend that those of you with Monaco 1 take a long hard look at this before parting with your cash. CVG 068 CVG 068 TIM BOONE At the start of a race you are Plug in the cart and you might get a strange feeling of given a choice of three different Deja Vu. What kind of game could Sega dream up to gear options, which can drastical. beat the awesome Super Monaco? Would it be a feast ly affect the overall performance of audio visual wizardry? Would it be an all new concept of your vehicle. A fully automatic in driving games? Would it be exactly the same as the car is by far the easiest to drive first game? Well, it is. All the same graphics and most as the on-board computer conof the same sounds are the order of the day here. stantly changes up as you keep Slightly different tracks and a load of bells and whistles the accelerator pressed. Easy as don't hide the fact that IT'S THE SAME GAME! this is, the car suffers in terms of acceleration. A semi-automatic gear box allows you to change up and down at will, but again the computer will change upwards for you. The manual gearbox is a real bitch to control, but clever gear changing lets you accelerate faster than any other car on the track. Real racers will choose the manual gear change and automatic is for sad wimps like James Bennett of Winnersh, Berkshire.

"GUE EIVE ARCADE ACTION STORY He's the toughest bloke in the world! He's GI Joe, star of cartoon and little plastic figurines, and now in this latest coin-op from Konami! An alien force has entered Earth's atmosphere in a massive starcruiser, hell-bent on taking over the world and enslaving the human race. Only our Joseph stands between the aliens of total destruction and peace on Earth until the next invasion and you control all of his actions! Can you stand the pressure, or will your shorts explode with the sheer force of your fear? Play the game and you'll soon find out! GOING GREAT GUNS Big guns and rockets are GI Joe's staple diet when he's on an important mission such as this, and he needs a regular dose of each to keep in tip-top, alien-smashing shape. His gun has an infinite supply of ammo, but is only a single-shot weapon and he needs to pick up a rapid-fire attachment to do some real damage. Rockets, on the other hand, are in short supply and can only be found by blowing up weapons stores and by killing certain aliens, so use them wisely. GI. JO BB A REAL AMERICAN HERO 2000 TS BEST TO TOP.TELES WIPUN CREERIDE COBBAS BATE OF HE JUN DETOXSAT BTILE!'T, RÉAL AMERICAN HERO! dG1s "


"ARCADE ACTION FILL DIE, ALIEN SGUM Surprising as it may seem most, if not all, the nasties you'll encounter in GI Joe are of alien parentage. There are numerous ranks of baddy, and the higher their rank, the harder they are. Not all of them are pure cannon-fodder though. Some are driving around in tanks, others are manning gun emplacements and many are patrolling the areas in fighter ships. They do, however, have one thing in common they're all from another world and they all deserve to die! WE Coin-op fans will immediately recognise GI Joe as a rip-off of Taito's Operation Wolf and Thunderbolt machines. The emphasis is very much on blasting, as you yomp around the 3D levels, blowing bits out of enemy aliens and their various transport. There are weapons and items to collect and enough danger to satisfy the killer in you. So what are you waiting for? Get up and go, Joe! TARUS SECIALIST PIETAT LETA 4-PLAYER THRILLS If you're tine eing GI Joe, don't fret, there are another three rom the Action Force (which is what the little plass e s were called before the name was changes to anks to control. Snake-Eyes has round about t he erstics as Joe, with excellent targeting caus e s. z block is slow but is a bit of a wizzz with the 2.0 tillery, Scalett a lady! rushes around the place is a bit see when it comes to weapons usage. P PLATE is Now R OBETXEEN EXPECT TO COME 17CVG "


"GVE ARCADE ACTION THREE STAGE SLAUGHTER If you haven't had your fill of Op Wolf games yet, then GI Joe is going to be right up your street. What you've got to see are the stunning graphics some of the best yet seen on a game of this type. Beautifully effective 3D scrolling and screens full of murderous baddies mean you won't be able to rest for a second! Music is a bit of a treat too, and there are heaps of great sound effects and even some speech which sounds exactly like old Bruce Lee films! A bit of a downer is the lack of levels it's not going to take an age to get through to the end, although it may cost you an arm and a leg to do so. Like all the other Wolf/Thunderbolt games, GI Joe won't have you coming back for more and more once you've been through to the end. Nevertheless this is a great coin-op overall, and because it's joystick controlled as opposed to having to tangle with a great big, cabinet-mounted Uzi like most of its peers, it's very easy to get to grips with. Good stuff! Old Joe battles with the aliens across three different areas, each split into sub-sections. Stage one consists of running toward the main base before taking the lift to the heart of the alien's ground-based stronghold. The second level sees Joe storming through the jungle, cutting a swathe through everything in his way from baddies to large trees. The final encounter is on the mothership itself, with Joe racing along the deck to get to the Cobra Commander on the bridge but once there, not everything is as it seems!

"CE HOTSHOTS TURTLES IN TIME TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES 2 O KONAMI O SUPER NES VINAVINE hey're green, they're mean and you're probably getting a bit fed up of them but it looks like the Turtles are here to stay. Anyway, the good news is that the Turtles have inspired one of the most exciting new SNES products around. TMHT2 Turtles in Time is a sequel to the original Konami coin-op. It's a two player beat 'em up, looking initially very similar to the first game. Appearances can be deceptive though, for under the pleasant face of the first few levels is a mass of novel features and hilarious comedy antics! We've already had a sneak preview of the game, and Konami have been beavering away to use all the goodies on the SNES to full effect. The simple beat 'em up action is nicely broken up by sub-levels including an awesome F-Zero variant and from what we've seen already this cart is really looking the business which could provide a much-needed shot in the arm for Turtle freaks everywhere. This is one to watch out for and it could be the best thing since the last best thing, so watch this spot for the full Review just the very second we get it!

"FUE HOTSHOTS cesto NEW YORK MONSTERS HITTING CREDITS H M 00-00 FIGHT BASEBALL STARS SNKO NEO GEO trike One! Strike Two! Hurrah it's another big hit from the Neo! Arcade baseball fans will need no introduction to Baseball Stars, the Neo Geo laugh which still does well in the arcades today. Now it's back for a second strike, and all the signs are that this one could score another Home Run in the arcades and in the home. It looks as if manufacturers SNK have taken the original game and tweaked up the best bits to provide more of the same only better! Broadly speaking, the sequel plays just in just the same way as the first game. Each player chooses his team from the massive range on offer and plays ball. Gameplay is pretty simplistic, but promises a great laugh in two-player mode. Three strikes and you're out, three Outs and you change, the rules aren't exactly hard to work out! Where the original scored highest was in great graphics and nice humourous touches. Whether the sequel manages to improve on these or just delivers more of the same remains to be seen, so keep your pitching arm stuck to these pages for the full CVG review just the second we can!

"CUE HOTSHOTS ZOOL 16660 HI 01666 BECP O AMIGA O STO VG heroes out there will remember that we previewed Zool in the Hotshots section last month, but being very sad thickies we didn't print any screenshots! So what do we do about that, eh? We flippin' well go and print 'em this month, because we reckon Zool could be one of the hottest home computer hits this year! Gremlin's mega fast action platform romp has been in production quite a while now, and it's really starting to look the biz! Basically, you play this Ninja Ant-type thingy and boy can this lad shift! He can cling to walls, slide on slopes, leap for his life and use a Smart Bomb the like of which you've never seen before! He's a hero of the Nth Dimension, a weird and wonderful place where just about anything can happen and often does! There's the Sweet World where confectionary can be a killer, the Music World which includes instruments of death, the Tool World where you quickly find yourself in a tangle and the Fruit World, with tummyaching trouble all round. With a grand total of 21 levels over seven different graphics styles, Zool 00= SC 015720 HI 015720 LES DOO 000 already looks like it's going to be a bit of a winner. One thing you won't see from these shots (but we have \"cos we're hard) is the sher speed of the game. Zool zips about like nobody's business and this little baby looks like it could set new standards on the Amiga. Rest assured we'll be giving Zool the full Review treatment just the second we can, but for now you can drool over these screenshots and start saving that cash... S L101 LI 02 GVG90 "

"CVE COMPETITION SUPER SCOPE WERE GIVING AWAY 20! READY! AIM! FIRE! Here's your chance to win one of 20 brand new Nintendo Super Scopes, courtesy of Nintendo themselves! Not content with giving away an incredible ten Super Nintendos a few issues back, CVG's gone and scooped the universe yet again to give away 20 Super Scopes one of the hottest pieces of console kit around! If you're a long-haired dribbling weirdo who doesn't know what the Super Scope is, we'd better put you out of your misery and explain it's one of biggest bolt-on goodies money can buy! With six games included in the pack, and a blimmin' big bazooka-size gun to swank about with, this is one fine add on for the big Nintendo and a laff riot as well! So what do you have to do to win one of these fabby bits of kit? How can you get your hands on this white hot little number and be the envy of your whole street? We think you'll like this... On these pages we've printed a load of monsters from Super Mario Land (the game which comes free with the Super Nintendo) and invented a game of our own. Read the text next to each monster and then try and work out which square you would aim at with your Super Scope to blow it away! (Im portant note: You can't use you scope on Super Mario world, but we're just doing it for this compo. You get six free games with the Scope anyway, so that shouldn't matter one jot!) For example, if you think a good old rocket up the B6 would dust Monster 1 then that's what you write on your entry. Do it for each monster then complete this tie-break in no more than 10 words: «I reckon I'm hard enough for a Super Scope because...\" To show you what we're looking for, here's a sad sample entry from none other than CVG crapshot Paul Rand: 1. A1 2. A4 3. D1 4. D4 I reckon I'm hard enough for a Super Scope because: I'm in the London Karaoke Competition Finals and cacking it! MONSTER 1: IGGY This speccy monster is well ard thanks to his massive fangs and claws, but get your shot RIGHT and it's FANGS for the memory as this boyo bites the dust! MONSTER 2: LEMMY  Don't go cross-eyed if you want to blast this boyo back where he belongs. Who KNOWS what's the best way to dust him? 2 CVG 092 "


"CVG 11115800 SCORE 115900 ADJUST AIN PLEN LEIRE MONSTER 3: LUDWIG With all that hair and a single fang, we reckon Ludwig's a RIGHT EYEFUL and a bit of a laugh. What's the best way to dust him? MONSTER 4: ROY You'll be LEFT with a FISTful of worries if you can't get rid of old Roy just the second this shady character creeps up on you! So now you know what to do, work out those weak points, complete that tie-break and fire those entries off to: CRUMBS MUM! I WANT A SUPER SCOPE! COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON ECIR 3AU. You'll have to get your skates on though, because your entries MUST reach us by Friday July 3. (Sorry overseas readers we'll do a compo specially for you very soon!) Get blasting! FINAL BIT 26 Right, pay attention and stop mucking about because this is important. All the usual CVG compo rules apply, which means you can't enter if you're anything to do with EMAP or Nintendo or your name is Stuart Hodge from Redhill, Surrey, because he hasn't tidied his bedroom in eight months. Other than that you can enter as many times as you like, the Editor's decision is final and anyone who phones up to find out how they're getting on will be laughed at, instantly disqualified and forced to listen to Billington's Burps all day like we do. 093 C "
