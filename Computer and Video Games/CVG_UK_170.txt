At the other end is a friend at HMV Level One's head office, and what he's telling me is pretty much Iwhat I expected: Everybody is waiting for big things to happen, that haven't happened yet, but whatever it is they're waiting for, there's an obvious reluctance to splash out even on the BIG titles. The HMV chart (printed right) tells an interesting story, however: Not a single Saturn game in sight, but a 16-bit Mega Drive title in the number one slot. PlayStation is holding its own against the more established machines, BUT this is all set to change. Just three games from Sega of Japan could turn the heads of thousands of crucial buyers, such as yourself, in the coming months. The point I'm making here is that there hasn't been a game since the original Street Fighter II to make people choose a system. SFIl practically sold the SNES to this country, and you can bet Sega Rally, Virtua Fighter 2, and Virtua Cop are going to do the same for Saturn. No matter what happens with Nintendo 64 at Shoshinkai even if it's a pre-Christmas launch across the globe (which I seriously doubt), there's nothing that can take away from the achievements Sega have made. These games are essential. I just pity those who couldn't hold their breath longer than September the 29th. Biased? Not at all. But sometimes everyone has to appreciate a job well done.

MICROPROSE OCEAN VIRGIN OCEAN CODEMASTERS DOMARK MICROSOFT VIRGIN SONY Paul Davies: Boss Paul has had to bear some inhumane hardships this month whilst compiling his beloved magazine. The most terrifying moment being his forced visit to see Swan Lake (that's a ballet) with his girlfriend and witness some culture (something unknown in Rochdale, Pauls home town). Nevertheless after a few sherbets Paul gained enthusiasm and clambered onto the stage to demonstrate his famous clog dancing routine. Top games: Sega Rally, Virtua Fighter 2, Zero Divide, Guardian Heroes. Tom Guise: Deputy Boss Tom has been revealing the strange and wonderful dreams that haunt his tiny mind this month. Obviously brought on by the stress and tension that goes with extended lie-ins and flexi-time, his dreams always seem to follow a particular pattern. First he's being chased by a beautiful woman, but when he turns around her face melts and reveals a hideous beefburger monster that begs for brains in a deep gurgling voice. Top games: Virtua Fighter 2, Sega Rally, Virtua Cop, Marvel Super Heroes, Rave Racer, Point Blank, Attack of the Mutant Penguins. Ed Lomas: Skivvy After Tom C smashed Ed's 'Pink Floyd, Shine on you Crazy Diamond CD' and rammed the sharp bits into his face, Ed has been very quiet for the past few weeks. The bandages only came off yesterday...only to reveal a huge spot on the very tip of his nose, which begs the question. Has he been lying about his identity? Is he in fact the only love-child of mad Pink Floyd singer Syd Barrett and if so why isn't he mad as well? Top games: Virtua Fighter 2, Sega Rally, Virtua Cop, Ultimate MK3, Hexen, Every game ever ever. Tom Cox: Colouring In Games come a poor second place for Tom when it comes to the pursuit of Rokk (pause for air guitar solo and accompanied headbanging) but now he's found a way to combine the two Road Rash 3DO. Bikes, Rokk, Chicks, Leather, Denim, Whips...ahem. It's got the lot. \"What more can you ask for?\" he says, \"how about cartoon cows that rear up when you crash into them? That would be brilliant.\" Top games: Road Rash, Ridge Racer, Sega Rally. Petrea Doyle: Rubbing Out Trea has been the backbone of the mag this month. Rescuing the rest of the pathetic team with a heart warming \"G'day!\" as she gives freelancers one of her terrible Chinese burns. Tom has started to churn out copy rather quickly since the last one left with the skin of his wrists in tatters. Top games: Apeiron (Mac) Jaime Smith: Pencil Monitor I don't know what Jaime has done to upset Ed this month but judging by Eds Photoshop experiments it must be something pretty nasty. That aside Jaime has for some unknown reason decided to dye his hair ginger, or copper as he calls it. But that doesn't matter because he saved the sad Emap 5-a-side footy team from total humiliation with his deadly accurate shooting skills. Cheers. Top games: Street Fighter Alpha, Marvel Super Heroes, Killer Instinct, MK3, Quark Express (Mac), Rave Racer. "

"| TOP GAMES CVG TOP GAMES ERS GUIDE machine is. We're not into all that \"which machine is better?\" gibberish. Nope, here at CVG we're just into good games. So here we present our recommended top five games for each of the important systems this Christmas. Buying any of these titles is a good move for your machine. And if you're in a dilemma as to which machine you want, just look at the games we recommend and see which one has the titles you want the most. After all, the 'best' machine is only ever going to be the one with the games you like. Hakuna Matata, Paul. JAGUAR TEGA RIVE 7883 3DO SUPER NINTENDO EITEITIMITEIT TIITTI 3DO Although not competing directly with the Sony and Sega machines, the 3DO has acquired a selection of quality titles all of its very own. A classy machine, with the promise of an amazing future in the form of M2. SUPER NES It was THE hot machine of the 16-bit era and even now its unique graphical quality and still forthcoming top titles make it a excellent purchase. All the more so because of its now bargain price. And Yoshi's Island is released officially early next year. 1. THE NEED FOR SPEED 94% It may be fairly old now but that just means it's slightly cheaper than before. Excellent graphics and sound as well as ultra-fast driving with spectacular crashes. 2. SPACE HULK 91% A great strategic Doom clone where you must control a whole troop of men. A truly spooky atmosphere and lots of creepy Genestealers makes it one to get. 3. ROAD RASH 3D0 91%Loads of high-speed violent motorbike action with loads of noisy rock music. Still gets people playing on it a lot of the time. 4. FIFA SOCCER 90% A brilliant 3D version of the sport. Great graphics combined with the original gameplay and multi-player features mean it's really good. 5. JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL90% As with FIFA, an improved version of the 16-bit games with loads of film and American Football tactics. 1. DIDDY'S KONG QUEST 94% The great playability of the first game is improved with better graphics and more levels. New characters to beat and more to do make it a hit. 2. DOOM 92% It's amazing how good this version is. The only 16-bit machine to get the game and it's an incredible conversion with great graphics and sound. 3. KILLER INSTINCT 92% The graphics and sound are really close to the 64-bit arcade machine but it's in the playability that this wins. All the massive combos to learn means that it'll keep going for a long time. 4. MORTAL KOMBAT 3 92% A fast and good-looking version of the arcade hit. Lots of characters, secrets, moves, death and blood. 5. ISS DELUXE 91% The best soccer game on the Super NES has been improved. It's an essential buy for fans of fast, fun footy. MEGA DRIVE It's the machine that made Sega as huge as they are today and not surprising really. The Mega Drive has a massive selection of incredible classics which are still as brilliant as they ever were. Oh, and it's got Sonic too. MICRO MACHINES '96: 94% MM2 was hailed as the greatest game ever and it was. Whilst MM '96 doesn't build much on the near-perfect formula, it still builds on it. If you haven't got MM2 you HAVE to have this. EARTHWORM JIM 2: 93% Proving that there's still untapped talent in the Megadrive, EJ2 does things you wouldn't believe possible. Simply incredible graphics, superoriginal playabilty and mutatedly fun-levels make this an essential Mega Drive game. MORTAL KOMBAT 3: 92% It's a closer conversion of the coin-op than the Super NES version and it's brilliant. Spot-on playabilty, tons of moves, loads of characters and bloooood! You'll love it! COMIX ZONE: 90% An highly original scrolling beat 'em up. You play Sketch Turner, a cartoonist trapped in his own comic and fighting his way through its pages. Top beat 'em up action and innovative gameplay. Thoroughly recommended. SONIC 3 AND KNUCKLES: 97% It's over a year old now and you need to buy both Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles to fully enjoy it. That's why it's here at the bottom. But in truth, Sonic 3 and Knuckles is the best platform experience ever. It's what video games were invented for. JAGUAR It's the same price as the Megadrive and Super Nintendo, but Atari's console is actually considerably more powerful. The latest titles haven't made the grade, but Jaguar has a fair few choice titles in its back catalogue and the forthcoming update of the coin-op classic, Defender 2000, to look forward to. TEMPEST 2000: 95% It might be quite an old Jaguar title, but Tempest 2000 hasn't aged a bit. Nor will it. Super-stylish vector graphics, incredible sound and reflex-bending gameplay. Almost worth the price of a Jag. DOOM: 90% One of the best console versions of ID's awesome 3D shoot 'em up. Smooth scrolling, textured graphics, over 30 monster-filled levels and brilliant gameplay. RAYMAN: 82% Colourful graphics and challenging, entertaining gameplay make Rayman a game that's more comfortably suited to the Jag than the likes of the Saturn or PlayStation. A fun, cutesy platformer. ALIEN VS PREDATOR: 75% It was the big Jaguar license when it was released, and although it didn't quite live up to expectations, Alien Vs Predator is still a fun blaster. Lacking the action of Doom, but a decent movie atmosphere nonetheless. FEVER PITCH: 74% If you're looking for a footy game for your Jaguar, this is your only choice. Fortunately it's none too bad. Certainly playable, but lacking polished graphics, it's an entertaining game. "


"NEWS CVG NEWS the wired-up gaming news section 3D0 sign away the Following the release of MK3 on the PlayStation, the Saturn rights to their M2 warms up for its own version of Ultimate MK3. connected 300 SELL RI M2 hardware for the sum of Atari spearhead their entry to the PC CD-ROM market with a $100 million. conversion of the brilliant Tempest 2000. Sega bring their hottest EA prepare to scare young PlayStation owners the world, 2nd/8 titles to the PC CD-ROM. over as John Madden lopes his way onto their machine. Rargh! And in another gameAn all-new version of Tekken 2 surfaces in the arcades. Only half a year after 3D0 announced their allnew M2 hardware, they sign away the rights in a multi-million pound deal. What's going on? swapping drama, Thunderhawk 2 wings its way onto the PlayStation. Psygnosis bring their At last we reveal Street Fighter Alpha on the Saturn. PS games to Saturn! And CVG (that's us folks) get, an all-new games room. Possibly the most incredible piece of news in the console industry this month, is word that the 3D0 Company have signed a deal, handing over the exclusive rights to their all-new 64-bit gaming technology to Matsushita Electrical Industries. The deal, worth an estimated $100 million, means that 3DO no longer control the fate of their forthcoming CD-based M2 system. Announced at a press conference in May, the M2 hardware is promised to be the most impressive piece of home gaming hardware so far seen, with claims that it \"beats expensive graphics workstations and outpaces popular coin-op arcade systems.\" In fact, 3DO have even claimed that, from a technical point of view, it excedes the power of Nintendo's long-awaited Nintendo (Ultra) 64 system, just launched at Shoshinkai show in Japan at the end of November. Under the new deal, Matsushita not only have the complete rights to produce the gaming hardware, but also the sublicense rights to allow other hardware and software companies to use M2 technology. And in fact, Matsushita is already in discussions with potential partner companies, to expand the number of M2 developers over the next two years. In all actuality, the new deal should change very little about the M2's future strategy, and if anything help it. Matsushita are the parent company of Panasonic, whose FZ-1 machine is responsible for most of 3DO's M1 sales. So they already know the market well, and have worked closely with 3D0 for many years now. On the software front, Studio 3D0 are still working on upcoming titles for the system. In fact, the deal actually frees 3D0 up to concentrate more on their software interests and future hardware development, rather than worrying about marketing their products. On the plus front too, Masushita's presence as one of Japan's leading electronics manufacturers means they may well be able to influence more top Japanese software developers into working with them. Being an American company, the Japanese console market has always been a tough arena for 3D0 to infiltrate. With Studio 3DO currently working on a range of M2 titles to coincide with the machine's launch during the second quarter of 1996, we hope to bring you pictures of these games, and further M2 news, within the next two months. 10 "


"NEWS NEWS CVG THE INCREDIBLE M2 Combining 10 custom graphics, sound and I/O processors, with an IBM PowerPC 602 microprocessor, the M2 is said to be a phenomenal gaming machine, with unparalleled 3D performance. In fact, just talking figures, the machine is supposedly capable of processing more than a million polygons a second (as compared to the Saturn's 500,000), with a range of light-sourcing, texturing, filtering (softening pixelation to create realistic images) and mip-mapping (maintaining a non-blocky image even when zoomed in) techniques that exceed anything produced by the current 'super-consoles' What's more, it can produce 'transparent' polygons, making it easier to produce realistic natural scenery. For instance, instead of using a number of polygons to produce the shape of a leaf, only one need be used, with the areas around the contour of the leaf made invisible. Paricularly impressive is the M2's Z-buffer. When calculating real-time 3D graphics, the Z-buffer detects which objects need not be rendered because they are behind other objects. In other machines, Z-buffering is done in the software; M2 has it built into the hardware freeing up processor power for other tasks. Moreoever, 3DO intend on winning software developers over with the machine's incredibly user-friendly operating system. With a vast range of programming tools, it's hoped that new software developers will be able to produce M2 titles faster and more easily than when developing for other consoles. GHTS TO E TEMPEST 2000 ON PC Still the greatest Jaguar game and one of the best console games around (as far as Tom G and Paul are concerned), Tempest 2000 is set for an all-new lease of life, thanks to Atari's new lineup of PC CD ROM titles. Atari are bringing all their best Jaguar titles to the PC CD and Jeff Minter's psychedelic vector graphic blaster is the first to see release. We've had a short playtest of the game and looks like a more than reasonable conversion. In fact, the high-energy techno tracks that accompanied the original (amazingly impressive considering they were on cartridge) have been remixed as tracks on the PC CD version. Far preferable to the MIDI versions of the music. Tempest 2000 is already available for the PC-CD ROM. As well as this, Atari are releasing, Highlander which is licensed from the animated TV series and Attack of the Mutant Penguins (the Jaguar version of which is reviewed on page 39). 80259 2000 "


"CVG NEWS connected SEGA PC 9999 AKIRA Some of Sega's biggest games are set for release on PC CD-ROM before the end of the year! The new 'Diamond Edge 3D Multimedia Accelerator board is what gives the PC power to play enhanced versions of already stunning Saturn games. The Diamond Edge has fantastic texturemapped polygon handling capabilities as well as all manner of custom effects, including transparency and fog. As well as fab graphics, the Diamond Edge has excellent sound abilities and builtin game ports. The first release to use this is the fantastic VIRTUA FIGHTER REMIX, which is probably going to be the game included with the Diamond Edge when it is released. The game runs with Saturn joypads which plug into the Diamond Edge and, after playing it, we can tell you that it is amazing! Like all of the Sega PC games, VF Remix runs in Windows '95 and the graphics are as detailed as the Saturn version. Though the game isn't finished yet, there is an option to turn light-sourcing on something not in the Saturn version. PANZER DRAGOON is also to be releasd on this hardware and from the early demo we've played, it's going to be brilliant as well. JEFFRY 232 1135. There are some Mega Drive and Mega-CD games to be released too which don't require the Diamond Edge. ECCO THE DOLPHIN is identical to the MD dolphin simulator (?) but it plays slightly faster. The game can also be controlled with the mouse, which works really well. The very original comicbased beat-'em-up, COMIX ZONE, looks and plays the same as the MD version, though it has got many of the speech effects which were left out of the original. CVG JOIN FORCES WITH DOLBY! The Top Gun-style FMV jet fighter game, TOMCAT ALLEY, is the same as the Mega-CD original but with enhanced video sequences. This is quite a surprise as it doesn't use any MPEG add-ons at all. Also, using a mouse to select waypoints and weapons is far better than a joypad. The massively under-rated SONIC CD is also coming out, which should be incredible on a fast machine! Seeing as all of these games are being developed in the USA, the music will be the American versions instead of the Japanese 'Toot Toot Sonic Warrior'. Which means they'll be awful. With a new team on the magazine, we've cleared out the old CVG games room and enlisted the help of Dolby Industries to kit us out with a brilliant AV system. So you can be sure when we review each month's titles, we've given them the proper environment to really show us what they can (or can't) do. The engineers from Dolby have already been around to measure up the room for the five-speaker surround sound system, so hopefully it'll all be up and running real soon. Until then, here's a picture of our empty games room. Wait until you see it next month! And the rumour in the PC press is that one of the future titles to use the Dlamond Edge will be SEGA RALLY! If it's true we should see it by the end of 1996. Though the whole Sega PC thing is a great idea, the Diamond Edge board will cost almost as much as a Saturn and you'll need a PC as well. It's a great idea for existing rich PC owners but everyone else would be better off with a  Saturn. 12 "


"NEWS NEWS CVG IT'S TRUE — WIPEOUT iS COMING TO SATURN! On76.6 Yep, one of the hottest pieces of news at the moment is that Wipeout is coming to Sega Saturn. Incredible as it may sound, it seems Psygnosis/ SIE intend on releasing all OF22.5 their PlayStation titles onto the Saturn, with only a few months separating the release of the two console versions. Wipeout is the first title they've got lined up and those that have seen it claim it's just as good as the PlayStation version. Obviously the Saturn version won't have the Orbital, Leftfield and 8 0:40. Chemical Brother tracks (licensed as they were from Sony Music), however apart from that, we could well be looking at a spot-on conversion. Other titles already mentioned are Demolition Derby, Lemmings 3D, Discworld, and Krazy Ivan. Naturally this looks to be a big blow for the PlayStation, as one of its biggest advantages were the Psygnosis titles. That is, unless OO:S. the Saturn versions turn out to be crap... POSITIBA SATURN JOHN MADDEN SQUEEZES ONTO PLAYSTATION! MK3 MD2 WINT DE The 16-bit EA Sports games have been going for what seems like ages now and, not long after the new versions have been released, the 1996 32-bit John Madden NFL game is now revealed. From these PlayStation screenshots it's looking great and if it's as good to play as PGA and FIFA, EA could well start their sports game phenomenon rolling all over again. IS ULTIMATE Well, PlayStation Mortal Kombat 3 finally hit the shelves on Friday 24th of November, two months later than promised. However, this two-month delay has seriously affected the potency of Sony's exclusive deal of having the only 32-bit console version of the game this year. All the more so, because GT Interactive have announced that the Saturn version of the game is going to be a conversion of the all-new Ultimate MK3 coin-op. Featuring at least seven more characters, new backdrops, tons of new moves for all the characters and a 16-player tournament feature, it's a considerable upgrade from original MK3. And the extra time before the Saturn version's release has given the developers a chance to add all these new features. The game should be exactly the same as the brilliant arcade version which we've featured on page 80. Set for an April release, we hope to print the first pictures of it real soon. 13 "


"CVG NEWS NEWS connected Viacom are moving into the now very popular PC CD-ROM market with a big selection of good-looking games. VIACOM COME VIA PC Beavis and Butthead Virtual Stupidity. The PC version of Beavis and Butthead is a completely different to any of the other versions. This one follows the MTV series much closer, even featuring real music videos with B+B nattering over them. There are loads of characters from the TV show, like Principal McVicker and Mr Buzzcut. The game is out now and no doubt morons of all ages will love it. MTV Unplugged Coming to your PC monitor in February 1996 is MTV Unplugged, an interactive version of the popular TV series. In a similar way to the Mega-CD's Make My Video' games, you can now create your own Unplugged videos using previously unseen footage of top bands, including Sting, REM, Aerosmith, Elton John, Joe Satriani, Eric Clapton and Rod Stewart. Deep Space Nine Harbinger DS9 is going to be released in the first quarter of 1996 to masses of obsessive Trekkies. In the PC CD-ROM game you play as a Tirrion delegate for a Federation Delegation in the Gamma Quadrant. The game is played as a puzzle adventure where you must talk to characters from the TV series to try and prevent an agressive alien race from destroying the Space Station DS9. Congo The Movie: Descent into Zinj The game of Congo The Movie should be available on PC CD-ROM now. The 3D cinematic graphics look great and the prospect of running around a jungle, shooting big chimps sounds good to us. Zoop The controversial 16-bit puzzle game (some people love it, others hate it) looks like it could take over the world with forthcoming releases on just about every format. Look for them at the start of 1996. The Indian In The Cupboard Though it sounds mad, it's based on an upcoming Paramount Pictures' Movie. The graphics look really nice and we're looking forward to finding more out about it. PLAYSTATION GETS ITS CHOPPER OUT! GETS ITS UN Having just reviewed the Saturn version of Core Design's action-packed helicopter shoot 'em up (on page 52), we can now turn our eyes to the forthcomong PlayStation version of Thunderhawk 2. From what we've seen of the game, it looks exactly the same as the Saturn version. However, hopefully Core will add some enhancements to this version of an already fantastic game, perhaps touching up on the clipping and (here we can hope) reintroducing some of the old Mega-CD missions that were missed out. More next month. Maybe even a preview. "

"NEWS CVG NEWS connected RESIDENT EVIL PICTORIAL UPDATE ON CAPCOM'S ACTION ADVENTURE Last month we revealed first screen-shots of Capcom's spectacular adventure game for the PlayStation. A fully interactive, real-time Zombie flick of sorts, created using super high-res CG effects. This month we've played an interactive demo, from which we are able to describe more about the plot, and its heroes including exclusive information about the central characters' side-kicks and their personality traits. Gill approaches her fallen buddy with caution. The last thing she wants is to end up like him! PROLOGUE Just to recap on last month's news story: STARS (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) are a crack police unit, sent to an obscure American town on a murder investigation. STARS are split into two teams A, and B. From their temporary office in Raccoon City, Team B are transported by helicopter to woodland territory, so they may ferret out the culprit. They don't return. When Team A, the heroes of the story, follow to find what happened, they are chased from the helicopter wreckage by wild dogs to an old, dishevelled mansion... Aim to blast the feathers of these crows, before they peck out his or her) eyes. See those feathers fly! ARMOUR GETTIN' In the version we played, most of the scenery is static you can't do anything with it. Only the doors are interactive at first, opening to the touch, unless they're locked. Two weapons a hefty revolver, and pump action shotgun are also collectible. But paintings, books, windows, and so on don't offer any clues in the way most adventure games would. The emphasis is on action; the kind which your mother most definitely will hate...! QUALITY SECONDS The story begins with all four team members standing in the entrance hall. From here the story unfolds according to the character chosen, though initial tasks are similar. Though the game is played using one character Chris Redfield, or Gill Valentine there are important sidekicks who lend a hand at crucial points. For example Gill is saved from being crushed from a room's descending ceiling by her accomplice, Barry Burton. For some reason, in the version we played, Chris isn't so lucky. Consequently Gill is able to proceed with a shot-gun, the holder of which triggers the ceiling. Chris has to make do with his Automatic, obviously his back-up, Rebecca Chambers, just wasn't around to help at the right time. EAT YOUR GUEST Here's your first proper introduction to the main characters of Resident Evil. See this guy on the floor, he bites at peoples' ankles. Only way to stop him is by kicking his rotten head off! GILL VALENTINE An explosives expert. Gill's family background is half French, half Japanese which doesn't explain a thing really, except maybe we're all, supposed to fancy her. Joined 'STARS because she cannot abide trouble makers. Her zest for life makes here a strong but, ultimately, cute character to work with. CHRIS REDFIELD Hails from New York City. He joined the airforce, only to leave after three years to join STARS. Chris was deployed to Raccoon, along with Barry, to sont out the City's problems. His strengths include the ability to act quickly, on the decisions formed from his perceptive nature. BARRY BURTON (SIDEKICK) Perhaps the most intelligent of the bunch, and a strong disciplinarian. Barry is a Fireman, who lives for his work but his heart with with his fami ly. He wears a locket around his neck, in which there is a picture of his wife and two daughters. REBECCA CHAMBERS (B TEAM) Beccy is an 18 year old Medic, who's a recent recruit to the team, Showed a natural aptitude for chemistry at school which is why she passed with flying colours. In all though Rebecca is a very down to earth personality. This is her first Case, so she is very excited by the whole thing. Don't get her killed, "

"CVG NEWS SPECIAL PSEGA You probably bought a Saturn just to play this game. If you didn't, you probably will. gettableed, sit-dow TAL TIME SIDE 3 29\"54 3 28154 laying Sega Rally in the arcade is an unforgettable experience. Specifically in the dedicated, sit-down examples found in the bigger sites. The super-sharp CG visuals, awesome sound generated from all sides (including below), and incredible realism created by the friction on the steering make this possible, Since May this year, Rally has made even the most recent competition pale in comparison. Sega's AM3 are the self-proclaimed \"pride of Sega R&D\", thinking of themselves as professional planners and directors in the style of Hollywood film-makers, as opposed to just a bunch of programmers. Their challenge when working on Sega Rally was to capture the realism of a World Championship rally. This meant the presentation of a suped-up road vehicle, tearing through natural surroundings, using graphical techniques more commonly associated with clean buildings, slick road surfaces, and similarly-styled cars. According to AM3, even the mighty Daytona USA only uses 50% of the arcade Model 2 board's capabilities. To achieve what they wanted for Rally, the 13-man team pushed Model 2 to the limit. In January this incredible game is coming to Saturn complete. With extras. How is this so? You need only read this special feature to find out go 2.65MP3 AHEAD ON MAPS An obvious cause for concern is how the fidelity of the Saturn version compares to the arcade. Obviously the Model 2 technology is superior to Saturn's, so the CS team had to recreate everything from scratch. They found a number of ways around the problem. For example the arcade board only displays one colour per polygon, whereas Saturn achieves up to 16 from a palette of 32 000. This allowed them to 'cheat' in order to come close to the game in looks. To recreate the amazing sound of the arcade, CS remixed all the music and effects in 'Q Sound'. This isn't true surround sound, but certainly gives the impression of spaciousness. To appreciate how close they have come to matching the game 'feel', read on... THE CONVERSION TEAM 5° 279333 10°56 262 10115 SEGA RALU SEGA RALLY With the arcade version complete, AM3 were expected to apply their expertise to a Saturn equivalent. What eventually happened is that only the Producer, Mr Tetsuya Mizuguchi, got involved, leaving the Director's job to Mr Hattori, of Sega's CS (Consumer Software) division. Key AM3 designer Mr Sasaki, and programmer Yamamoto have also supervised the project. Aside from freeing AM3 to work on their Manx TT coinop, Mr Mizuguchi had an equally good reason for letting the CS team handle the job they know more about how games are played at home, as Mega Drive Virtua Racing, and Virtua Racing Deluxe for 32X prove. Not forgetting Virtua Fighter 32x, of course. Sega sponsored the Toyota team at this year's Safari Rally, and had their logo emblazoned on Mr Fujimoto's car bonnet.

Evidence of this would be that Mr Mizuguchi took the conversion team to meet with Fujimoto at the Asia Pacific Rally in Indonesia. While they were there, Mr Fujimoto agreed to supervise planning of the Saturn production. Prior to this, Toyota and the C-ONE corporation teams assisted AM3 by letting them test drive their cars several times. This research was also applied to the Saturn version. 14. 105 MPH PLAYER 1 PLAYER 2 20 "

Obviously the traction felt through the steering wheel is impossible unless Sega plan to release a modified Arcade Racer (which they don't). The other omission relates to the rear view mirror. The reason this had to go is mainly because it utilises an awful lot of dedicated course data, which would have affected the overall content of the game. Besides, the only real use for the mirror is when cutting across the opposition in multi-player games. When taking the challenge alone, the corners ahead are of more importance to what's behind.

What's more, it's in Saturn VF2! 19 9999 SARAH BRYANT JEFFRY MCWILD In the right hands, Sarah was one of VF1's deadliest fighters and now she's even more lethal. Faster than ever, she can string even more floating moves into her deadly array of combos. Seemingly slow and useless to the inept player, experts of VF1 soon discovered Jeffry was actually a fast and powerful fighter. His mastery of Pancratium (the ancient Roman fighting art, folks) now includes some hefty and humorous headbutts and butt-butts. WINNER "


"REVIEW CVG REVIEW KAGE MARU PAI CHAN Kage's acrobatic moves made him one of the most unusual and visually impressive characters in VF1. However, once expert opponents sussed him out he was fairly easy to defeat. Not anymore though, thanks to a wider range of multiple height and direction attacks. Although Pai is a fast punch/ kick combo fighter, her strength has always lay in her ability to use an opponent's attacks against them. This skill has been improved in VF2, allowing her to perform some stunning counter-attacks. CHALLENGER 999g VIRTUA FEATURES 2: THE VICTORY POSE REMIXED TUNES! ENGER CHAMPIONS Saturn Virtua Fighter featured new arranged versions of the coin-op tunes. With VF2, B-Univ (the AM2 music division) have included both the original arcade music and all-new remixed versions. We actually prefer the remixed real instrument' versions. You can select from three different victory poses when you win a round, each one accompanied by a different taunt. What's more, beat an opponent in under ten seconds and you get a 'maniac' victory pose. 9999 Lion's deadly frontal piggyback attack. It's cool to watch too. DISTANCE VISION With Saturn VF2 featuring all the character detail, supersmooth animation and speed of the coin-op, something had to give; and in this case it's the backdrops. The arcade version of VF2 featured highly-detailed 3D surroundings, something the Saturn just couldn't handle without affecting the speed and thus the gameplay of the conversion. As such, the backdrops are made from multiple 2D layers of scenery which move in parallax to simulate a 3D effect. The result is satisfactory enough, but unfortunately it means foreground details such as Wolf's cage and Shun's ARTIDE bridge are gone. A shame, but a reasonable price to pay. LION RAFALE Fouter2 Lion's Preving Mantis kung-fu style is quite a departure from the usual VF formula. His low posture makes him very difficult to attack using high moves, and crouching only makes an opponent vulnerable to his many low jabs and high kicks. Extremely fast with some deadly sweep ing combos, his only weakness is his weakness it only takes a few connecting blows to defeat him! A Pai's Great Wall backdrop from the coin-op. It's just too detailed for the Saturn to handle. 28 "


"REVIEW VERDICT. SATURN SCORES RRR SHUN DI RRR Ever since the Saturn was launched in Japan over a year ago, VF2 has been the game I've been waiting for. I must confess, I had my doubts AM2 could do it, but the conversion is simply staggering. Every move, every frame of character animation, the detail of the fighters, it's all just perfect. And you will not believe how fast and fluid the gameplay is. It makes Virtua Fighter (which till this day was my favourite game) look like a shuffling, inadequate antique. If you're a fan of the arcade game you know what to expect, because it moves and plays EXACTLY the same. If you haven't, I promise you, VF2 is the most awesome fighting game you could hope to play. There will be people who'll want to pick holes in the game and no doubt they'll mention the backdrops. Well, yes they are inferior to the coinop quite considerably, but honestly, you just don't notice them when you play the game. VF2 might not be as close a conversion as Virtua Cop or Rally, but as far as I'm concerned it's the most incredible conversion I've ever seen. The best game ever. LILLIERS He's 83 years old and he likes his Saki. A good thing then, that Shun is a master of Drunk Kung-Fu. His unorthodox staggering nature makes him very unpredictable as an oppo. nent. To control though, he's brilliant fun with a range of incredible acrobatic kicks and rolling punches. Best of all though, some moves actually cause him to drink from his hip flask. This not only reddens his face, but also unlocks specatcular new attacks. He can drink from his flask up to 14 times each round, increasing his attack strength by 1.4 times. TOM GUISE (VIRTUA FIGHTER 2 VE REMIX TEHKEN PS. SECOND OPINION. SATURN GRAPHICS Inside the ring it's arcade perfect, short of a lack of light-sourcing. My main reason for buying myself a Saturn when it was released was the forthcoming VF2. The first Saturn releases really had me worried as to whether a decent conversion was possible but thankfully, my prayers have been answered. Though the background graphics may seem disappointing when watching someone else play, pick up the pad and anyone will find that it's the best game ever. The speed, the depth, the character movement, EVERYTHING just goes to make for a totally awesome experience. Tom's right, it's the best game ever. THE BEST GAME EVER, YOU HEAR! Fact. 98 ANIMATION You've never seen a game move so smoothly at such a speed before. ED LOMAS MUSIC In VF1 the fighters could be grouped into pairs. The Bryants and Chans both had similar moves, Jeffry and Wolf were throw specialists and Akira and kage had vastly opposing styles; Akira possessing no acrobatic moves and Kage relying almost purely on his aerial moves. Likewise, the two additions to VF2 are an opposing pair, one being the youngest character in the game and the other being the oldest. The coin-op tunes are a tad grating. The remixed versions are cool. THIRD OPINION SOUND EFFECTS. 93 Tons of sounds, from the tap of feet on planks to supersonic jet kicks. GAMEPLAY SATURN No matter which way you look at it, VF2 is an all-time classic game. My head's just buzzing with the thought of it. Here is one of those rare games to get the balance of graphical achievement, immediate appeal, and long-term reward just right. I can't fault it. That the whole polygon fighter originated from Sega's AM2 says enough about its authority over Namco's Tekken series, but it's in playing the game for yourself that you realise just how perfect the game is and if you've played the coin-op, you understand this pretty well because the fight action is precisely the same. Of course the background detail has been compromised. This much was expected. What's blown me away is how carefully AM2 have ensured that Saturn owners are rewarded with the conversion they dreamed of when the announcement was made just a year ago. I want to say this is the best game ever, however I'll just admit that VF2 is the only game I'm interested in this Christmas and probably for a very long time beyond. Buy it. A depth of gameplay no other game has ever come near. VALUE. A Shun has to be the most incredible video character to watch ever. Even when he's just standing still! It's essential. Buy a Saturn for it if you must. Great value. OVERALL The singlemost incredible happening in the console industry yet. Virtua Fighter 2 rules. PAUL DAVIES CHALLENGER 9999 29 "

It's a well abused term, but ever since the awesome revelation that was Street Fighter 2 on the Super Nintendo all those years ago, it's what people have come to expect from their conversions. In truth though, there has rarely, if ever, been a true arcadeperfect home conversion (Super NES SF2 actually fell far short of the coin-op). Even the likes of the brilliant Sega Rally this month, with its near-perfect visuals and handling, fails to totally match the arcade experience, due to the fact that it can't replicate the coin-op cabinet's traction steering. Now however, there is a game to which the term 'arcade perfect can be justly applied.

You can also activate your 'score multiplier' by hitting several regions of a single enemy, juggling their body through the air.

SATURN People might criticise the depth of shooting games, but all you really want from a conversion of Virtua Cop is the same look, sound and feel of the coin-op. The exact same, mind you. AM2 obviously realise this, because they've gone hammer and tongs to produce it. The graphics, especially with the brilliant character and zoom animation, are perfect. And the funky wah-wah music and explosive sounds effects, played at top volume, shake through the floor brilliantly. It's the arcade-identical gun though that's a stroke of genius. Make sure you get the gunincluded version of the game. It saves you ten quid on the gun and the game is crap without it. With it though, it's a dangerously satisfying game. If you want to know whether you want it, just have a go in the arcades, I assure you it feels exactly the same. As for lastability, this is such an awesome experience, you'll come back to it again and again. And besides, there's plenty of hidden extras in there, including a mirror mode! CRTOJIS 7 PRESS STARI IMPORTANT: ARMS DEAL!! Incredibly, Virtua Cop is going to be packaged with the gun for only .99.

This is the closest conversion of the three big Sega arcade games, and seeing as the arcade game is amazing this one is too. With the pad it's just a fairly decent shooter but with the gun it's something totally amazing the arcade game! And everyone who's played that knows how good it is. The Saturn-exclusive features aren't all that brilliant but they definitely add more playing time to something which could already last forever.

Even though it was a long time ago, it's been brought up to date by being released on PlayStation and it's just about exactly the same as the arcade original. Seeing as not many people have heard of the arcade game here's what it's all about: Destruction! In In the Hunt, you aren't limited to just destroying the enemies you can destroy almost all of the scenery. If you drive your sub along just below the surface of the water you can launch missiles into the air to wipe out any buildings nearby. Fab! LEVEL 3 The whole of this level is spent trying to keep ahead of a giant rock bloke. At the top of the shaft, the subs have to blast through a wall before taking on the rock man. He attacks with his extra pair of fists while the heroes have to dislodge loose rocks from the ceiling onto his head. LEVEL 1 This level's set near the South Pole so there are loads of chances to be frozen. The freeze beams can only be stopped by destroying the main units on the wall. At the 1P oooo fans 31 PUSH-29 STAR end of the level a large ship appears which waves its tentacles around while launching massive amouts of missiles. LEVEL 4 Level four is set in a sunken city where the crumbling roads and bridges are as much of a danger as the enemies.

MUSIC SOUND EFFECTS. 72 GAMEPLAY.... 84 PLAYSTATION Though the game looks and sounds pretty dreadful for the PlayStation, there is some fairly cool game play in it. The big problem is that the speed of the subs is, way too slow, making it hard to dodge the masses of shots fired at you. Also it's got everything from the arcade game including the slow-down which brings the game almost to a stand still in two player mode. There are some PlayStation exclusive options. like the remixed sound, but these still don't make it anything special. The graphics have got a real old-style arcade feel to them and there's always loads going on though this isn't always a good point as it's often hard to see what's happening, especially in two-player mode. Even with all of these faults, it can be good fun to play with the constant explosions often impressing and some people really like it-Paul, for example. A lot of fun. if you like this sort of thing.

"CVG REVIEW SATURN HI OCTANE 3D RACING BULLFROG .99 DECEMBER A futuristic hovercar racing game with added weaponry, eh? You won't hear us mention the name Wipeout. 1-8 PLAYERS. PLAYSTATION VERSION (PLANNED PC CD-ROM VERSION AVAILABLE ipeout. Okay, so we lied. But with Psygnosis' PlayStation racer proving to be one of the year's hottest gaming sensations, anything similar is bound to be held up for comparison. And Bullfrog's Hi Octane is one such game. A 3D racer, filled with gravity-defying supercars laden with ballistic weaponry, and set across a series of futuristic roadways, the game is more than just passably similar. However, Hi Octane is most certainly NOT a clone of Wipeout (although you can be sure we'll see a few of those soon enough). In fact, the game first saw light on the PC sometime before the twinkle-in-Mr-Psygnosis' eye brought Wipeout to fruition. What's more, it scored highly in the PC press and proved quite a success all round. As such, Bullfrog have decided to bring it to the Saturn. So, we'll have no more of this Wipeout-clone nonsense. Besides, Wipeout isn't even out on the Saturn. Yet. Gran Chaser on the other hand, is remarkably similar... THE FULL ROADWORKS! Did we mention futuristic roadways? Well, you could call them that, if the road-planners of the Futuropolis decide to build their roads as crazy spaghetti highways that 1. AMAZON DELTA TURNPIKE The Indianapolis Speedway of Hi Octane, the Delta is your basic loop-track, surrounded by high rock walls. Fast and easy, as long as you make sure you keep going through the refuelling pits. duck through floodpipes, wind around the sides of cliffs without safety barriers, and bend at lethal right-angles. Yep, this game's got futuristic roadways alright. 6. THRAK CITY Straight roadways with sharp right-hand bends characterise this icy track, as you race through urban underpasses and frozen catacombs. Most tricky of all though, misjump the crossroad flyover and you end up way back on the course. EXTRA RID 2. TRANS-ASIA INTERSTATE Fast straights broken by hairpin bends, is the best way to describe this hilly course. The Interstate also introduces us to the multi-route nature of Hi Octane. Hit the moving refuelling ramp when it's high and you fly onto a concrete straight. When it's low you zoom through a water-filled aqueduct. 7. ANCIENT MINING TOWN So ancient is this mining town, that it doesn't exist. In its place is multi-level mud track which winds up and around various hills, permeated only by a red-lit underpass which leads you through to the main straight. EXTRA SHIELD EXTRA SHIELD 3. SHANGHAI DRAGON This icy course proves extremely fast. However, it's also very twisty. Careful cornering is required on some of the tighter bends or you spin out across the surrounding plates of ice. 8. ARCTIC LAND It might sound like a frozen food superstore, but it's actually one of the most confusing race tracks you'll ever confront. Crazy loops crossing over each other, lead you down the wrong routes and tricky ledges send you toppling off the course. 4. NEW CHERNOBYL CENTRAL The muddy nature of this track may not effect your hover-racers, but the twisty, high-walled structure of it might. The most notable part of this track is an extremely wide stretch of tarmac that dips like a pipe in the middle. Watch out for power-ups on its high kerbs. 9. DEATH MATCH ARENA The final track is more like a skateboard half-pipe than a motor speedway. Made up of just one huge stretch of road, you have to flip 180 degrees to turn at each end. Naturally, this gives each driver plenty of chance to take out the rest, hence the name. Anno CHARCE MINICUN UOCRRDE. 5. SLAM CANYON As the name suggests, this course leads through and over a rocky canyon. Multiple routes allow you to take high overpasses or narrow passageways as you tackle the many long straights and sharp corners. HELLO JOHN GOT A NEW MOTOR? 63 shah There are six different hover-rods for you to race in, each with its own capabilities. What's more, you can customise your car from a selection of team colours, ranging from the Purple Riders and Peach Phreaks to the dodgily named Yellow Slashes.

OVERALL A enjoyable racer, but the graphics are repulsive for a Saturn game. And Wipeout's coming, folks! 9 02103 For me. Wipeout on the PlayStation has to be one of the hottest games around, so Hi Octane has a pretty tough standard to live up to. And to be honest, it doesn't quite make it. That said though, this goes from being a game that at first sight I hated, to one that after many hours play I find enjoyable. As a fast, fighting racer it's fun, but the graphics are so clunky and unstylish that they really put me off. Moreover, they actually break up badly in places, making it hard to see what's going on. I got stuck behind some rocks and couldn't work out how to get out, due to all the triangles flicking on and off the screen. Even with graphics to match Wipeout though, High Octane's gameplay would still score under par. Although easy to control, it just doesn't feel like you're heaving a solid vehicle around. Certainly, it's better than Gran Chaser (Cyber Speedway over here), but with Wipeout definitely headed for Saturn, I'd be inclined to wait. TOM GUISE Tomeu LIN . 1520 1570 FUEL FULL "

Why dream of owning FIFA '96 on PlayStation, when there's Fever Pitch on Jaguar? Well... (1-2 PLAYERS NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SUPER NES AND MEGADRIVE VERSIONS AVAILABLE LALDONELA hile it lacks graphical finesse, Fever Pitch's philosphy is that gameplay and character are more important to any soccer game. Rather than get to grips with squads who all look pretty identical, where you're squinting to tell who's who, the Jag's premier footy outing features eight distinctive Star Players. They're not only recognisable from their appearance, but through their outrageous antics on field. Just as Pitfall, reviewed last month, is almost a direct port from the Super NES and Mega Drive versions, Fever Pitch follows exactly the same route. And it's indistinguishable from its 16-bit parents. Why dream of owning FIFA 96 on PlayStation, as opposed to this...? 2 AL SALEM With the replay feature, you can relive classic moments like this. DID YOU SEE THAT! If the joy of watching an unfair goal isn't good enough the first time around, perhaps the chance to rerun the debacle on replay will satisfy your bad taste. Replays allow you to dissect the workings of goal strategy, and prevent the rest of the game transforming into a riot by examining pass techniques, free kicks, and so on. SCRAPPY DAPPY DO! REPLY Don't expect Fever Pitch to adhere to traditional soccer game etiquette. Goals come ten a penny, and fouls are treated as an integral part of the game. That's not to say the referee doesn't get involved from time to time, it's just that this particular referee is a W... well he needs glasses, and some common sense drilling into him to say the least. Consequently teams, and especially the star players, are free to hack each other to bits in order to get the result they need. TERIO SEELT SCORES BULO GU GRAPHICS STAR TURNS ANIMATION MUSIC SOUND EFFECTS. 68 GAMEPLAY In Tournament mode, you start the game with a basic squad. In order to recruit stars onto the team you have to earn them by playing fair! No matter how badly the top dogs behave once they're on board, the stars only want to be associated with clean-playing teams with a good track record. If you want to play dirty all the time, choose Exhibition mode instead, where you can hand-pick the team with the best players for a one-off 'friendly'. NITE 3 5 GER VALUE VERDICT. JAGUAR Of the 16-bit soccer titles to be released earlier this year, Fever Pitch is probably the weakest. Not that it's especially poor, but Konami's Intemational Superstar Soccer proved vastly superior. The decision for Jaguar owners is easier this being the only soccer game available for this machine after all. However if Atari will insist on comparing their 64-bit' machine to its 32-bit rivals, well Fever Pitch looks extremely miserable indeed. Playwise it isn't so bad no worse than the 80% + scoring game the 16-bitters have already. The star players add spice, and the basic action supports some fairly interesting exchanges. Player animation is okay too, with neat tricks here and there. The sound, however, is rougn. Mega Drive quality even. So overall this is another Jaguar disappointment. I'm not sure how much more of this I can take bring on the classics, and quickly!!! OVERALL PAUL DAVIES "

And fart. 2 Now collect these gremlins. Yes, they look like Sonic. They help you open chests for some reason. 3 Inside the chests are letters. Ah, we've spelt PAN. Now we can bash the penguins with our pan. Clever, eh? 4 Use those gremlins to start these evil traps. Look at the penguins get chewed up.Hahahahahaha hahahahahahaha! 5 Oh no, the mutant penguins have tipped the scales. They've won. Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh noooo! o doubt you're bursting with curiosity over what this game could possibly be about. Well, perhaps a brief rundown of the plot might shed some light. It seems aliens from a distant world are preparing to invade Earth by using the age-old trick of adopting human form. Unfortunately though, while studying our planet they accidentally watched the Discovery channel and thought we all looked like penguins. So that's the guise they took. Only, they didn't do it too well, so they look odd. Hence the name Attack of the Mutant Penguins. Geddit? We doubt you have. You see, if you're imagining scenes of London during the blitz, with frog-marching legions of human-sized penguins disintegrating innocent humans with ray-guns, whilst the skies are filled with humming motherships, you're in for surprise. If however, you're imagining rows of cartoon penguins dressed as cowboys and Indians, or Maid Marion, wandering along strange floating ledges, attempting to clamber onto a large set of scales with a big scary face, you've got it sussed. Goodness knows where the humans are, but as Earth's saviours a green pear-like creature, or a red cherry-like creature you have to stop the penguins getting to the scales. Either by setting up fiendish traps such as spinning scythes, or by collecting all the letters that spell your weapon, such as BAT, and batting them to death. There are tons of levels to face, each harder than the last. But then, that's war folks. War against the Attack of the Mutant Penguins. SCREAM! 99 This is a horror level. In more ways than one. 35 GRAPHICS VERDICT SATURN ANIMATION MUSIC SOUND EFFECTS_35 MED  GilMEPLAY VALUE55 This game just baffles me. Obviously, the programmers think they've got an incredible sense of humour, as you can tell from the hilarious Attack of the Mutant Penguins title. But not only did I not laugh at the fancy dressed penguins, the Sonic-gremlins, the penguin-mashers, or the farts, but I didn't understand how it's all supposed to come together to make a coherent game. Especially, a quasi-puzzle game where logic should dictate your actions. That said, once you've got to grips with the method of the game, you dont really need logic to help solve the puzzles, You see, there's very little freedom to your actions. The traps are all in place waiting to be started. The chests obviously contain the letters you need for your weapon. Fail to perform the perfunctory tasks and you lose the level. Short of honing your Mutant Penguin skilled to cope with the increasingly difficult levels, there's no real lateral thinking involved. It's all quite punishing. Perhaps those Mutant Penguin boys do have a sense of humour after all, testing our patience with such an abomination. OVERALL TOM GUISE 39 "


"REVIEW CVG REVIEW TO SATURN MOTOR SPORT SEGA If the recent Schumacher vs Hill episodes had you hopping up and down, red faced, and screaming, Sega's Formula One Saturn Racer could push you over the edge! EIMPORT OUT NOW. 1 PLAYER PUNTLI..... NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE INFORMATION LAL 3/8 POS 10 24 ince Virtua Racing it seemed Sega had abandoned Formula One in favour of more exotic motoring locations. This would have been a terrible oversight, insofar as true-grit fans of the subject are concerned. Which is probably why FI Live Information a game carrying the official Grand Prix license, and subsequently its drivers has completely sold out on import in recent weeks. And why CVG has spent the hours not playing Hang On '95 this month, determining just how faithful F1 Live Information is to the sport; with or without the Arcade Racer. And Murray Walker. LAP TIME 1:24.7.23 0:23.265 3:16.323 SPLIT TIME   T2 000 T3 0/000 SUPER MONACO RIP Fans of the arcade and subsequent Mega Drive release, Super Monaco GP, are in for a pleasant surprise with F1. While it doesn't have the full range of Grand Prix circuits, or the tension of having to perform well for promotion through the ranks, the accuracy is beyond anything ever seen on a console circuit racer. Because the game is written specifically for home use, this allows for the kind of touches that would be wasted on a coin-op. SKY MOVIES Similar to Virtua Formula in the arcade, where action from eight VR coin-ops is displayed via 'sky cam', F1 heightens the atmosphere with its very own birds-eye view of the race. This is directly linked to what the commentators are saying, and continuously pans the circuit for those drivers staking a claim, or going up in flame, for the glory of Pole Position. Especially bad crashes are highlighted, as the camera stays in place to observe the chaos surrounding the wreckage. Likewise an ace driver's antics are eagerly followed. 140249 REAL CONVERSATION PIECE Sega have created their own commentary system for F1, which reacts directly to the race action. As with Konami's Crowd Response System, Sega invited three of Japan's leading sports commentators to provide the speech samples. Though we haven't a clue what they're saying, it all sounds very authentic, and there are obvious points where a crash or crucial piece of overtaking is mentioned. 11/23 PIT REPORT Kawai Kazuhito LAPTIME DAPTIME FUJI TV Miyake Masaharu 10.5.10 A 38 03 CPUME EXPERT COMMENTARY Imamiya Jun FLAP A Time to get those tires sorted! SIAP-TIME TIRED AND NEED A DRINK 442-1307 24191995 Shell Shell Shell There's no chance of claiming that Laurel Wreath in F1 unless tires are replaced, and fuel replenished at regular intervals. The harder the difficulty setting (and there's a 'Very Hard' mode in store for those who master all three Grand Prix circuits), the more wear and tear plays an integral role. As races last eight laps, it's essential to pay your cardboard mates in the pit stop at least one visit. "


"REVIEW BEHIND YOU! One clever feature of F1 is the ability to use slipstream to gain extra speed. Wind resistance is practically reduced to zero when chasing a rival's tail, allowing your car to exceed its usual performance. This extra speed is used to slingshot your car ahead, leaving the rest to fry in vour exhaust heat! right, to avoid crashing! A Get your timing just STEER CRAZY DAYTONA USA LIVE INFORMATION HANG ON GP '95... Just as Hang On GP '95 plays better with Sega's Arcade Racer, the performance of F1 is improved too. With the steering wheel in command, the driving experience is much closer to how you'd expect The Real Thing to behave. Viewing the car from the outside also reveals how the front wheels move more convincingly. Still, completing the game using the standard set up is no problem unlike Hang On GP. GRAPHICS Solid and authenticlooking, with good attention to detail. ANIMATION Cars manoeuvre convincingly. Circuits shift smoothly too. | LAP 4 8 SIX OF THEIR BEST MUSIC LAD TIME POS 9/24 SPUT TIME T1 31.635 13 01000 05401038 101961 Okay AOR which, thankfully, only features between races. Six courses may seem a paltry number, but they each present a legitimate challenge. All six are only avaliable via Original mode. The remaining three are variations on the custom Sega circuit. SOUND EFFECTS 80 HOCKENHETIM Best engine noise in aeons. Great collision sounds. Easy to master with only one tight corner, and one tricky chicane to negotiate. The long straights offer loads of opportunity for overtaking. GAMEPLAY 84 This impressive section is encountered in Sega Motorland: Expert. The corner ahead is super tight! Played in V Hard mode it's heart-inmouth all the way. SUZUKA Plenty of full-lock steering is required, especially in the chicane encountered in the approach to the home straight. Suzuka is the coolest Grand Prix circuit to race. VALUE. VERDICT No real limit to how much a driver may improve. MONTECARLO OVERALL Made famous through Super Monaco GP. In F1 it's a total nightmare of hairpin bend upon hairpin bend. The consolation being the scenery is pretty cool. SATURN My ambition to experience exciting and accurate Formula One action at home is finally realised, after being let down by most 16-bit efforts after Super Monaco GP. The atmos phere in Live is electric, and the action is eventful to say the least. It's not entirely realistic, not in the same way as the Microprose PC games set out to be, but the in-game, presentation is much better: Sparks flying from the chassis of cars, spin-outs occurring just inches away, plus the road-side detail is very convincing. Optimising performance on each circuit takes practice, so the feeling of getting it just right is very rewarding. The engine noise is as close to, the real thing as you could wish for, and sounds so cool screaming up and down through the gears. Though it's a shame the UK version won't include the exciting commen tary. I don't imagine this will detract from the enjoyment overmuch. Besides which, Sega are revising the music content as compensation. Any Saturn owner who has a passion for Formula One racing should buy F1 Live Information without reservation. PAUL DAVIES Lacks the glamour of Daytona USA, and the sheer exhilaration of Sega Rally, but is solid, state-of-the-art Formula One action nonetheless. SEGA MOTOR LAND Is raced in three forms: Novice, Advanced, and Expert. The difference each time is that the basic layout is extended, to include more tests of a driver's skill sharper bends, blind corners, that type of thing. On the whole, however, we found Motor Land a cinch. TO2 is so 38 "


"REVIEW SHOOTER/ADVENTURE STUDIO 300 .99 Nothing spooky about the longest day of the year, you may think. Just a few extra hours of sunlight to fit in another innings of cricket? Not here. Bah ha hahaaaa. OUT NOW ONE PLAYER NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE BARRELS O' LAFFS With a game called Killing Time you expect lots of messy weapons. As well as this satisfying selection there is a sub-machine waiting. Somewhere. Once upon a time a killing time there lived a young lady called Tess Conway. In the 1930's she was a rich and popular character, mainly because of her many wild parties held at her family's island estate. But one seemingly innocent Summer Solstice, her wild party went mysteriously wrong. No-one knows for sure what happened, though it's common knowledge that one of Tess's regular guests a local gossip columnist had just started work on a damning article about Ms Conway. Coincidence or sinister? What happened to all those people? What's with all the ducks? Where do games makers find so many bad actors? What's this game all about? These questions are answered only by playing Killing Time, except for the last one, which is answered by reading this review. The movie intro tells the story of how Tess Conway fashioned herself to be just like her idol Mystic Meg. PEACEMAKER Your character starts with one of these, and while it's alright for the start of the game, bigger weapons are needed for later on. WINGED VESSELS These mysterious ornamental vases contain spells which give the player new powers. One example is this blue one (below) which reveals all of the dangers on the map screen when activated. The power of these vessels only lasts a short while, but they can be recharged by collecting white Rejuvenation Vessels. FLAMETHROWER An unlikely weapon to be found in a mansion, but still a brilliant one. Hold 'A' and wave it around to flame everyone. SHOTGUN A standard hunting gun, used by the hordes of hunters in the courtyard, and very useful for much slaughtering fun. DOUBLE PISTOL Two dead is better than one, so finding the second Peacemaker is great for both killing and running out of ammo. THE CONWAY ESTATE: A CELEBRATION What we have here is a clever blend of 7th Guest and Doom. Your character wanders around the grounds and passageways of the Conway estate in real-time 3D, pausing occasionally to converse with and eavesdrop on the apparitions of some of the lost party-goers. The adventure begins in a clearing in front of the guardhouse leading on to the mansion's courtyard, where a big clue to solving one of the mysteries of the game is found. Beyond that the mansion stretches a long way back with many secret passages and areas to find as well as lots which aren't shown on the rough map included with the game. COAT COOKTYAS MIKA COVER ITX GREAT BALLS OF STUFF When an enemy is killed, their life force is left behind as a floating ball of energy. These come in various colours which dictate how much of your character's health they restore, all excepting the red balls which always have a negative effect. "


"REVIEW zeven CVC SCORES DUCK A LA LEAD SHOT The constant quacking of the ducks in the courtyard is enough to drive anyone mad. Thankfully, even though the ducks can't do any damage, they can be killed either with a shotgun blast to the head (pictured here) or by trampling on them. The squelch noise is awesome! KILLING TIME... SPACE HULK.... WOLFENSTEIN. GRAPHICS Detailed wall textures and good quality FMV ghosties. ANIMATION. The enemy animation is a bit jerky but the FMV is smooth. MUSIC Excellent movie-like score, which changes with the action. SOUND EFFECTS..91 Great atmospheric background noises and gun blasts. GAMEPLAY Frustrating and a bit jerky but there's always stuff to do. VALUE. VERDICT Shooting is repetitive, but the adventure keeps you going. OVERALL 3DO The novelty of both FMV adventure games and Doom rip-offs has worn off, though Killing Time manages to catch your interest by combining the two genres into one. The graphics aren't quite as smooth as Space Hulk, but they're really detailed, and the excellent sound combined makes for a great atmosphere. Still. there are a few annoying problems: Though the playing area spans lots of locations, there are only 16 different enemy types. This makes the game slightly repetitive: most notably near the start where you spend what seems like ages blasting away at the hunchback hunters and their blooming ducks! Another problem is that the game's very frustrating. This is probably because the designers have tried to make the game hard by not giving you much ammo, though this just leaves you sprinting away from people until you die. The 3D0 pad's lack of diagonals also shows the game down. For all that, if you want an interesting challenge that's quite different to anything else. Killing Time is the one to go for. A clever blend of FMV and 3D shooting. Won't appeal to everyone, though it'll last a long time for those who get into it. Atmosphere and original ideas make this one to consider. ED LOMAS "


"REVIEW CVG REVIEW SATURN PUYO PUYO 2: PUZZLE COMPILE IMPORT OUT NOW Here's your chance to steal a FOR EXPERT PLAYERS glance at this potential sequel to Dr Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine hot from Japan. 1-2 PLAYERS ARLE PANO NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED SUPER NES VERSION AVAILABLE STAGE 3 RAZ uyo Puyo. We're always talking about it. So what's the big deal? Well, in 1992, Sega of Japan, in collaboration with obscure R&D team Compile (otherwise known for Super Aleste on Super NES), initiated a new breed of connect-a-shape video game. Puyo Puyo's innovative take on the whole puzzle idea, using explosive jellies in place of Tetris-style building bricks, caused such a sensation in Japan that both Sega and Nintendo took the basic game, and restyled it for the Western market. The results: Dr Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and Kirby's Avalanche, respectively. So what has it gained to counter the inevitable 'seen it, done it' criticisms? S60 our A Those white square-shaped jellies are deadly! ES TEXTO SULLARCOOK 125 RECE COME TO A STICKY END To add to the horror of struggling Puyo Puyo novices, reinforced ghost Puyo,called Kata Puyo, are included as a custom extra. By selecting Rule Henka from the extensive list of options these slightly more opaque examples require twice the effort to destroy. If you ask us, this is an almost impossible task in a fastmoving game! In addition, the Kata Puyo icons which sit in waiting at the top of the screen have gained an ugly new friend, hinting that even greater avalanches are now possible. What odds! Choose this mode to challenge every last one of Arle's, the girl's, magical foes. It's incredibly tough, which is why there is a save-game feature here. A Two players have the pick of six types of well. Each provides a unique test of skill, such as the die-hard Kata Puyo, and two-towin option. A See how quickly you can reach the top of the tower, by challenging a selection of the game's trickiest characters. Cockatrice here is one of the first. JELLY BELLY SCORES GRAPHICS ANIMATION.... A The Japanese Though this sequel is named Puyo Puyo 2, it writing shows that isn't the second in the series. That accolade the player has just goes to an adventure game (of sorts) available fought back. for Nintendo's Super Famicom. This Saturn game is the true follow-up, and is sold partially on the strength of its 1 'For Expert Players' credential. To this 99 0909 ARLE CAIT end Compile include revised strategies which, by themselves, would make the TO game much easier. Indeed they do 6 STAGE 3 make it simple for expert players to Lo6 utterly destroy any competition! LOGOS 66666 Room at the top .09 1540 The well remains twelve Puyo deep, only RS.. now there is an extra, hidden, line at the top. It buys a split-second more to place your jellies when things get tight, and allows for them to be stacked on end as an emergency measure. MUSIC 79 SOUND EFFECTS 82 GAMEPLAY 86 SERE VERDICT SATURN From start to finish the presentation in Puyo Puyo 2 is wonderful, featuring bizarre theatrical pieces, complete with spoken dialogue, and of course the crazy antics of little Carbuncle (that pair of rabbits ears with a mouth). The game is much tougher to master now, especially once the Kata Puyo are introduced. In fact I found it impossible most times to progress, when confronted by a screen full of these. Two players have a more varied time of it now too, with a broad range of custom options to go at. I love it the graphic style, the crazy accordion music; everything. It's just that I doubt Sega expect you will. People don't go much for sequels over here. Not even SF Turbo sold as well as everyone expected. So I doubt Puyo Puyo 2, under whichever guise, will do anything special in terms of sales. That's a shame, because it would add some welcome colour to the Saturn's almost too cool line-up. PAUL DAVIES VALUE OVERALL First to finish Clear the well of Puyo for added big bonus points. This writing remains on screen until the next group of jellies explode. If this means the well is cleared again, the reward is multiplied. It's also a great taunt! BAHLE OVER Twister Gameplay is so fast now that it is perfectly forgivable to wind up guiding those jellies down the wrong chute. Should this happen, it's now still okay to turn them around in the hope of finding a suitable combination. ALITE "

"REVIEW CVG REVIEW SUPER NES ROLE PLAYING NINTENDO .99 SECRET OUT NOW (ONE PLAYER ONC DI QUCD NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE E OF EVERMORE Tougher than Tekken? Greater than Mystaria? Stranger than Attack of the Mutant Penguins? More engrossing than any PC point-and-click adventure. This is perhaps Nintendo's finest 60+ hours. air to say that it is the role-playing games that are keeping the Super NES going strong. If not in Europe, it's certainly the case in America and Japan. Nintendo can hype Killer Instinct as much as they like, but there's nothing can beat the worth of a well conceived RPG, and Squaresoft are the undisputed masters of their field. Dedicated fans probably already know the history behind Evermore: That it s origin lies in the States, and not in Japan where the classic Secret of Mana, along with Chrono Trigger were developed. It's also true that Evermore borrows the Secret of Mana gaming engine, where it applies to the selection of weapons and so on. But this is not to detract from the quality of this titanic, and at all times impressive US project, as it maintains all the classic Squaresoft hallmarks: Great art. Likewise musical score. And gripping plot. To discover more about why Secret of Evermore should be right up there with Yoshi's Island and, no doubt, Killer Instinct on your shopping list, you need only read this review, Alchemy Setup B SELECT EXT Alchemy setup 8 SELECT EXIT Cure Fiash Hard Ball Heal Cure Fiash Hard Bali Heal Leuitate Found 30 talons Recovers some HP Lifts heavy objects GOLD FINGERS To counter groups of enemies, or overcome immovable obstacles such as boulders, the power of Alchemy is called upon for assistance. At regular intervals throughout the game, the hero is taught magic spells that are powered from ingredients scattered throughout Evermore. Only nine formulas can be memorised at any one time, so choosing which are the most appropriate becomes a crucial skill. To make matters more difficult, the spells require combinations of vital ingredients to perform some of them harder to come by than most. Hard Ball ard Ball you can Int rocks and other heavy objects by using the wate "


"REVIEW WORLD GONE MAD The very simple storyline behind Secret of Evermore goes a lot like this: Evermore is a fantasy realm, created by a Professor Sidney Ruffleberg. Difference with his cuck00-land however is that people can physically go there. It exists. This entire domain is intended as a kind of desert island, away from the harsh realities of life on our longsuffering earth. Problem here is that the portal Ruffleberg devised to get him to Evermore allowed some dark, unseen force to get its foot in the door. Of course this evil entity wants the place all for itself. Once the phantom has gained enough power from this, dimension, it intends to focus its attention on defiling our world also. The idea, of course, is not to let this happen! ARF WOOF BARK SNARL Most role-playing games provide the hero with back up, in the form of goodly Knights, mysterious Princesses with even stranger powers, and so on. The hero of Evermore gets no such support. Instead he is associated with a dog. Plain and ordinary, just like his owner. However it happens that this courageous canine is just about the best assistant a potential hero could wish for, as the mutt's in-bred talent for sniffing out clues, and savaging aggressors proves just the job in any situation. Generally speaking the dog follows the hero wherever he goes, only attacking if need be. However there is the option to switch control from the hero to the dog, whereby the boy is secondary to the hound. Should the boy's health be suffering, it's wise to take advantage of this feature. Use control to me I wonder if this gate leads to the volcano. There's fun to be had solving the riddle of this volcanic area, riddled with steam geysers. 47 "


"REVIEW If you're really my dog, you'll fetch this stick. SCORES those He Don't cher unte! SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR HAIR Being a fantasy world gives Evermore license to exist in whichever period of time it desires. And it changes its mind with each location! As the scenery is subject to adaptation, so to is the appearance of those who roam its pathways. Somehow our hero is immune to these effects, however the dog isn't quite so lucky. Expect to see him in the guise of a shaggy wolf-hound, a hunting dog, and a cyber canine much in the mould of the infamous K-9. SECRET OF MANA EVERMORE...... ZELDA ......... This snake is the second 'Boss' our hero runs into. It's so tough, the dog has no energy left! GRAPHICS....... Richly detailed, and varied throughout. Always interesting. ANIMATION Overall look is smooth, but charas are inevitably wooden. MUSIC Produced to a very high standard. There's a CD to buy in the US! 3D G SOUND EFFECTS 93 Absolutely outstandIng atmospherics. Top SNES quality. GAMEPLAY........ Skillfully executed. and remarkably frustration free. VERDICT 90 VALUE Over when it's over, but it takes a long time getting there. CALLING ALL STARS Occasionally the team happen across one of Evermore's leaders those people who have influenced the form of this secret place. Though leaders can't physically accompany the travellers on their journey, they lend their immense power for the price of a Call Bead. Wherever the boy and his dog find themselves, the use of the extremely rare Call Bead summons a leader's spirit, allowing our heroes to benefit from their magic. SUPER NES Last time I dug my Super NES out of the drawer was, to play Nintendo's other Stateside RPG, Earthbound, Seems Nintendo tossed a coin, with Evermore being on the flip side, and it came out on top. Good thing too. While Earthbound is big on character, and especially humour. Squaresoll's example is easier to digest for those brought up on a diet of Zelda ili and Secret of Mana. In fact the gameplay is almost exactly the same as Mana most noticeably in com bat situations. Perhaps the biggest point in the game's favour is its level of challenge. Right from the very beginning even the minor enemies present serious problems, which makes the build up to a big boss confrontation all the more unnerving you just know they're going to show no mercy. Atmosphere is also greatly enhanced by amazing sound effects, with music taking a back seat for once, and only setting the pulse racing during epic battles. The story is well developed, its central characters inter esting, and it's one that takes many hours to unfold. No doubt about it. Evermore is essential for your Super NES this Christmas. OVERALL True to say the Super NES is set for its best Christmas yet in the UK. Quality games like this make decision making easy buy it! PAUL DAVIES "

"REVIEW CVG REVIEW 300 30 SHOOT 'EM UP. STUDIO 300 BLADEFORCE EIMPORT. OUT NOW. 1 PLAYER If you live in a bad neighbourhood, this game'll make you feel better about it. Mind you, if you don't, it'll make you feel better too! NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE. ew. Atve all. If Blao of anything planned for your future? A nice job as a train driver perhaps? A lovely pension plan for when you retire to tend your shrubs? Or maybe total domination of Earth, with mankind las little more than pets to keep you amused? Well whatever, you can forget about it, because you've got no future, buddy. In the year 2110, our cities are going to be raised to the ground, replaced by 'The Meggagrid!' a teeming hive of crime where all restrictive laws have been discarded. With the maximum prison sentence stretching to only two weeks, and mental health centres defunded, drug dealers, crazed psychopaths, and toxically-infected muties will be free to terrorise the innocent. And eat children. Probably. At least, that's the picture painted by Bladeforce, the all-new 3DO shoot 'em up. Still, look on the bright side: If Bladeforce is anything to go by, we'll all get to fly around with helipaks strapped to our backs. Perfect for a quick trip to the supermarket. Although it'll probably be a smoking ruin by then. a COULD YOU LOVE... THIS? This gruesome looking fellow is Dr Franz Grubert and he's behind the plot of Bladeforce. After his laboratory was firebombed (that's why he looks like that. It's not bad texturing) he decided to wreak revenge on the criminals of Meggagrid and to this effect has constructed... a helicopter backpack. Of course, you're the sucker who has to wear it and fly around each level shooting everything in sight. It's a dirty job, but someone stupid enough's gotta to do it. COULD YOU LOVE... THESE?? The 3DO might not be able to generate FMV to the same standard as the PlayStation or Saturn, but for sheer entertainment value its intros are second to none. Bladeforce's Silicon Graphics generated opening sequence is one of the funniest we've seen. It's also a good way to introduce the game's madcap villainous characters, each of which is behind one level of criminal mayhem. Here it is. The Meggagrid. Not a place to spend your holiday. And these are the kind of people you can find there. Nasty folk. This is Terrance Pitt. The kingpin of crime. Not only does he look like Tom Cox, he's just as grumpy too. The Steel Medusa Sisters. Green-blooded cyber-genetic women. In a can. Recently escaped from the loony bin, ex-fire chief Pyro Megaly drives a fire truck that spews real fire. 50 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG 49892 SCORES SAN THE POWER-UPS INFO BOX Yeh, we know every time a shoot 'em up is reviewed there's a box about the power-ups, but for Bladeforce it's justified. Seeing as the powerups take the form of giant rotating cubes that float above the cityscape, they're pretty hard to ignore. They're also essential if you hope to stand any chance of completing a level. So, here's a quick rundown of the main ones. CHARGER PAKS You'll soon get sick of seeing these there's around 100 to 200 of them on each level! Nonetheless, they're fairly importantly, speeding up, as they do, your weapon recharge and firing rate. RRUNARRERA D RARRANLARARARARAS PICKWEILD A Don't go down that way. BOMBS These are difficult to aim, but highly destructive. Shrapnel bombs explode scattering damaging chunks about, whereas toss and power bombs cause mass destruction right at the heart of the explosion. BLADEFORCE HILLING TIME SPACE HULK 40954 PROJECTILES These propulsion weapons come in three forms. Power projectiles are the standard type, although they can be boosted by collecting charger paks. Curve projectiles actually avoid incoming attacks, and Trackers are manually guided to their target. GRAPHICS A mention must go the superb intro. The ingame graphics are ok. ANIMATION .. 83 HEALTH AND FUEL The boring items to collect, but finding them is one of the main objectives of the game. Bladeforce really keeps you on your toes as you desperately search for these supplies before plunging from the sky, or being shot to death. The movement of the 3D environment is Impressive. MUSIC Dynamic intro music, but annoying repetitive rock in-game. TEMREREN: SOUND EFFECTS. 62 A lack of realistic noises considering you're in a city. PICK UP FOR HEAD OF THE PITT CRIME FAMLY AND MESGASEID S ARMS DEALER CAPTURE FIM EEFORE HE CAN ALERT HIS PARTNERS N CR ME GAMEPLAY 72 A Your mission, in summary. Ooh, I'm gonna be sick. Fiddly, but responsive controls. The levels prove quite dull VALUE A lot of game here, but that's no so great 'cos its all so samey. OVERALL 3DO Bladeforce's superb opening sequence really sets you up in anticipation of a brilliant game. The awesome futuristic vision filled with wildly hilarious characters, promises an action-packed shoot 'em up set among total urban madness. And at first, this looks set to be the case. Guiding your helipak around the massive levels is an enjoyable affair, with a sensation of flight realistic enough to have you lolling your head about. And blasting the various enemies, whilst collecting better power-ups proves satisfying... for a while. But all too soon it becomes extremely dull; mainly because it's so frustrating finding your way around the repetitive terrain, with very little motivation to find anything. The brilliant humour and vision of the intro is completely lacking from the actual game. There's no wild vehicles driving around mad roadways, or neon hordings, or people come to that. It just looks like a 3D maze with floating cubes. Ultimately, this is a game with a lot of plot creativity and few gameplay ideas. Bladeforce had the potential to be a wild futuristic shootathon, packed with crazy ideas. In reality it's a monotonous 3D maze blaster. A close relative of Paul Davies, Ugly Two Head is an underworld surgeon with a head for the subject. Eddy Extasy. Smoothtalking and fast living, but at the end of the day, just a filthy drug peddler. Reverand Bea Atch has the power of the third eye. Literally. It sits on her forehead. TOM GUISE 51 "

Hi-tech helicopters always need cool nicknames to match, which explains how the rather feeble Blue Thunder earned its title. The futuristic chopper in Thunderhawk 2 has been christened 'Firestorm', which gets la CVG cool nickname rating of 9/10. The game's set in 1999, where not only the main helicopter, but all of the enemies' weapons and armour have been boosted from the original MegaCD version. Potential pilots of Firestorm have to be on 24-hour alert and ready to be sent to any of the 26 missions around the world, covering eight operations where they have to use their new-found arsenal to save the world from drugs barons, arms smugglers, pirates, evil dictators.

"REVIEW CVG REVIEW LOCK eta REKT:014 SECOND OPINION. SATURN Gun I was a huge fan of Mega-CD Thunderhawk when it came out, considering it to be one of the most amazing 3D shoot 'em ups of its time. So the Satum version is something I've been eagerly awaiting. Its highly impressive too. The action is fast and the destruction count is as high as ever. However the Mega-CD version was ground breaking, and, while the Satum version looks great, it isn't the amazing step up I'd hoped for. Rather than being a fresh new game, it's the same layout with spiced-up graphics. And even these, with their noticeable scenery buildup. could have been better. I also think the presentation is lacking, with static loading screens and radar mission briefs replacing the cool flying chopper and projector room presentation of the Mega-CD version. A very good game, but on Saturn it should have been gobsmacking FRIENDLY TOM GUISE BOMB 'EM Enemies are now manufactured in polygon factories, as opposed to the original Mega-CD enemies which came from 2D sprite shops. So the detail of the tanks and choppers stays great even at close range. When any vehicles are destroyed, the drivers fall out of the wreckage and attempt to run away: time to shoot them with the biggest weapon you can get your trigger finger on for maximum death! Here is a small selection of the enemies. CHOPPER This style of chopper is nasty once it gets into the air because of its speed, but if you're quick you can catch it on the ground. APC These are fairly common on the land-based missions, but the tanks protecting them still cause some hassle in big numbers. JEEP These are heavily-armoured and have massive rocket launchers on the top. Not really they just drive around waiting to be shot. BIG BOAT These giant vessels are often protected by smaller ships, though they don't really need it with their own massive guns. GUN TURRETS Though they're really just sitting targets, their constant barrage of tracer fire keeps you moving when they're near. "


"REVIEW SEVEN CVG SCORES Gun REAL HILLS! One area where the Mega-CD Thunderhawk missed out was in terms of dimensions. The sprite scaling was used to produce a Super NES Mode 7 style effect, though the floor was always at one level. The superior 3D capabilities of the Saturn mean that the hills no longer have to be drawn on the floor they can be real! There's only one downside to this: clipping. It was a big problem in Daytona and, even with some brilliantly ingenious cover-up plans, the building of the hills is still noticeable. The floor of the levels is still made from one huge bitmap, and the 3D hills are built on top of this when they get to a certain point. Sadly this appearing point is a little bit too close to the chopper, as can be seen in these pictures (Right). del THUNDERHAWK 2 PANZER DRAGOON T.HAWK (M-CD) GRAPHICS Beautifully smooth 3D effects, but some awful image-popping. BACK IN TIME Though it's billed as a sequel, Thunderhawk 2 borrows a lot from the original Mega-CD game. In fact, just about all of the missions are based on those in the original, albeit with greatly improved graphics. One of the main differences is that the Saturn's missions have far greater playing areas, though it does have one operation missing that was in the Mega-CD version Alaska.

OVERALL (Above) The Mega-CD graphics look really garish with the machine's limited colour palette. (Above) This is a similar section in the Saturn version and, as you can see, it looks much better. The Mega-CD version of Thunderhawk was massively underrated in my humble opinion, because it combined what were then amazing graphics and sound, fast shooting and some excellent strategy. So it came as a pleasant, but cautious, surprise to find out that Thunderhawk 2 was still pretty much the same game. The graphics are incredible with smooth polygon enemies and landscapes, though the pretty bad clipping does let them down a bit, as hills and buildings appear about halfway down the screen, often catching you out. The new views and 3D cockpit of the Saturn version add to the realism, really getting you involved with the game. Sadly, because I've played the original Thunderhawk through loads of times. I could remember lots of the missions and the gameplay's so similar that I felt I was playing the same game but with much better graphics. MegaCD Thunderhawk war veterans will feel slightly cheat ed because the game's not really a sequel at all. though everyone else will adore it, as it's brilliant. A classic shoot-'em-up brought up-to-date and improved. May be a slight disappointment to owners of the MegaCD original but it's well worth investment for everyone else.

The Saturn's got something to prove after the decidedly dodgy graphics of Daytona USA, and it seems a good idea that Sega are bringing Hang On up to date with their new technology.

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG VERDICT POSITIO SCORES SATURN This is a strange one. Though the game isn't all that good, I still forced myself to play it all the way through, swearing and cursing at the screen as the strange bike-handling had me crashing at all the wrong times. My biggest problem was the way that the game plays awfully with the pad: the bike is either vertical when you're not pressing anything, or horizontal as soon as you touch the pad. Also, if you brake on the way into a corner, the back wheel slides out and stays out, driving sideways very slowly until you wiggle the wheel from side to side, at which point the bike shoots off to the side and into a wall. Even with all of these complaints, and without mentioning the worst engine noise EVER, the game's worryingly addictive and fun, meaning that everyone in the office wanted to have at least a few goes.

Just to remind ourselves of the original Mega Drive Super Hang On, we had a brief go of it to see how much games have moved on in the last six years. We didn't actually realise to begin with just how poor it actually is, and it makes the Saturn version seem incredible! Sounds more like Golden Axe or Conan the Barbarian! SOUND EFFECTS.. 42 WHEELY BWILLIANT Amazingly, up 'til now the Saturn Arcade Racer wheel hasn't had a single game that works well with it. But the tide is turning and Hang On is infinitely better with the wheel than with a pad so much so that this is probably the sole reason we dedicated so much time to playing it. Worse engine noise than Game Gear games. Speech sucks. GAMEPLAY 76 Frustrating but fun with the wheel. Bad with a pad though. VALUE The save feature keeps you playing, if you use the wheel. VROOOM! There are five different bikes to choose from at start of the game, ranging from the fast with bad handling, to slow with good handling. Outstanding performance is rewarded by another five bikes, including an awesome orange-coloured one! OVERALL SECOND OPINION SATURN I can't help thinking Ed's being a little harsh about Hang On GP. Personally I like the game, although perhaps not for all the right reasons. With the wheel it's amazing how accurate the steering is, and it's this single novelty factor that makes Hang On such a laugh. Play it with a joypad though and it's an abomination. The digital D-pad ruins the fine bike steering, clumsily swinging you left and right and making, the game virtually unplayable. If you've got an Arcade Racer I reckon Hang On's worth buying, because it's just the kind of fun you expected when you bought the wheel. If you want a serious racer though, you'll be disappointed. Even with the wheel. it just doesn't have the precise handling to keep you hooked, trying to shed seconds off your laps, like Daytona does. It's just a fun racer and that's all. With a terrible engine noise. A weird blend of frustration and total addiction. The result is something you feel compelled to play, but don't really want to buy. TOM GUISE 571 "

Stop a madman's plans to dominate the world with red mercury! (Isn't that the stuff they put in barometers?) reel may sound like a painful bottom complaint, but it's in fact much, much worse than that. It's a bad guy who's using a strange power-source called red mercury to fuel his evil world domination inventions, upsetting a lot of people in the process. As is always the case, there's only one aeroplane agile enough, and two pilots cool enough, to save the world from Kreel. Warhawk's missions involve destroying any of Kreel's evil inventions, wiping out his many supporters, and collecting the red mercury cannisters in each area. The forcefields can only be passed once these generators have be wiped out. Mmmm, just like the spot on the end of Ed's nose popping. SHIELDS ON! The damage system in Warhawk is quite different to most other games. There are four outer shields which are depleted every time they are hit, though they recharge over time. The ship itself is only damaged when a direct hit is scored on a particular section with no shields remaining. This is represented in the game by this square diagram, showing exactly which parts of the Perigrine have been damaged.

PLAYSTATION I was, and still am, a big fan of the groundbreaking Super NES 3D flight games like StarWing and Pilot Wings, so to me this looked as though it could be something fantastic. Though there's more freedom of movement it doesn't have the same \"action\" feel, as you just seem to be trying to shoot your main targets while wave upon wave of enemies pound you from all over the place. No matter how many foes are destroyed there always seem to be at least as many replacements, making it pointless to bother with them. Of course it's impressive at times like when you're flying through claustrophobic tunnels dodging flames and guns, or nose-diving through the clouds. The handling of the ship seems fairly natural after a while and the freedom to go where you want makes it fun, but it's not the classic experience I'd hoped for. The boats on this level often protect power-ups. See the pretty reflections?

"CVG Parown REVIEW AT THE FLICKS Between missions, the pilots are given a talking to by their commander, who explains the plot as it evolves. She also shouts at the blokes if they give her any lip, though we reckon that Walker secretly fancies her... A Wiping out these generators is the key to opening the pyramid to get at the red mercury power source. Here are the two hunky heroes of the game. 80 This is Walker, who looks a bit like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica. This is the pilots' boss and the one that Walker fancies. Tom Guise does too. BIRD OF PREY The super Perigrine ship is warped into the middle of a small desert town with Kreel's super pyramid looming on the horizon. The armed obelisks seem the most obvious place to start attacking as they do lots of damage with their rapid-fire. Once the guys have destroyed the towers, the pyramid raises, exposing these red generators. There are eight to be destroyed, and the big gun on the top of the pyramid doesn't help the good guys. RENDERED HELPLESS An interesting feature of the game is the rendered cut-scenes which kick in during the game. For example, on the first level when the giant pyramid is destroyed, a rendered sequence appears showing the explosions in more detail. It's a nice touch and thankfully doesn't ruin the flow of the game at all. 62 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVC Eject! Eject! Eject! ENLIGHTEN ME One of the nice graphical bits of Warhawk is the light-sourcing.

The trails from the swarm missiles looks so nice that you'll end up using them all the time, even if they're not the best weapon. VERDICT. PLAYSTATION A good challenge and a film-like feel will keep you playing for ages. OVERALL A top quality flightsim/shoot-'emup/movie/strategy game that remains constantly interesting and challenging. It's really obvious that Warhawk is from the same people as Twisted Metal as it uses many of the same graphical effects, such as the flame trails from the missiles. Fortunately, the 3D is slightly neater than their other game, with some of the best light-sourcing effects around. To begin with, the game's pretty dull and confusing but once you get onto some of the later levels and master the controls, you can really get into the strategy side of it. There are some sections which are very tough, as there are masses of enemies attacking all at once, and some of the larger baddies cause ridiculous amounts of damage. The sound and full-motion video sequences create a movie feel, drawing you further into the missions, increasing the lastability by making you want to play through to see the plot unfold. Even with all of these good points Warhawk doesn't strike me as a classic, partly because the difficulty is off-putting, and because it looks distinctly unstylish in places. ED LOMAS 6 "

SATURN The intro and presentation of this game is probably the best ever, really giving you an excellent sense of actually watching the match on TV. Though the graphics may look brilliant from the screenshots, the animation on the sprites is quite awful and they look like bad Mortal Kombat characters up close. The only bad thing about all of this presentation is that it takes literally hours to look through, sending non-hockey fans asleep within a couple of minutes. The game doesn't actually play quite as well as the 16-bit hockey games, partly due to none of the views being as simple, along with clumsy characters. With a bit of patience you can get into it, playing almost as smoothly and quickly as the old NHL games, though it does take some work. If you ignore the only real downside of the dodgy player graphics then you've got an excellent sporty experience. SKATER'S DOZEN One of the game's biggest selling points is that it's 12 player compatible. This doesn't come cheap, however, as you'll need two multi taps and 12 joypads (that's .86 for the pads and adaptors, at a rough guess). The other problem is that you need 11 friends, which is probably even more PLAYER CONTROL expensive. When you play with 12, each player controls one character for the whole match, so SHA you get great «who's going to be the goalie?\" fights before the game. An excellent ice hockey game which takes some getting into, but will last ages with all its options and statistics. Essential for fans of NHL and multiplayer games. ED LOMAS 65 "


"REVIEW GAMEBOY FIGHTING NINTENDO .99 INSTINCT OUT DECEMBER What next Ultras from a wrist-watch! ame Boy has long been associated with cool conversions of ridiculously out-of-the-question coin-ops. Konami led the way with their shoot 'em up. Parodius back in 1991. Then Irem handled faithful conversions of their R-Type shoot 'em ups. Obviously there's a pattern forming here. You guessed it Game Boy's great for shoot 'em ups. Why? Because you only need one button. Two at most. But beat 'em ups, they're a different story. (1-2 PLAYERS NU 64 SEQUEL PLANNED ARCADE AND SUPER NES VERSIONS AVAILABLE POLGUNE THUNDER JAG SOLGORE One of the best-remembered April Fools run by CVG was the one where we said Street Fighter II was coming out on the little grey hand held. Many a true word spoken in jest is about all we have to say about that one. Now Nintendo have coaxed Rare into micronising Killer Instinct, nobody's all that surprised. Especially since the Mortal Kombat games, and Primal Rage, and World Warriors, and Fatal Fury, and on, and on, have all got there first. So what's the big deal? BIG DEAL: PART THREE Impossible though it may seem, all fighters have retained one No Mercy, and one Humiliation move. Unfortunately Orchid's zipper antics have been 'censored', in favour of the frog! AGO SPINAL BIG DEAL: PART ONE Eight of the ten original Ultratech contestants have made it onto Game Boy. Only Riptor and Cinder are missing. Our guess is that both characters require more than their fair share of memory to accommodate Riptor because he's so big, and Cinder because he exists in three states. BIG DEAL: PART TWO To solve the problem of having just two buttons instead of six, Rare mapped reduced power hits into some of the specials. For example Jago's Tiger Fury is stopped short by tapping punch twice. Keep the pressure on for heavier blows. Simple chaining still works. SCORES GRAPHICS 92 a ANIMATION. MUSIC BIG SOUND EFFECTS. 76 GAMEPLAY 92 VALUE. 90 (VERDICT GAMEBOY I'd much rather Nintendo bid Game Boy farewell with another Zelda or Mario title, but there's no denying Rare have achieved something outstanding with Kl. Again. So long as you approach the game with a mind that it's kind of a toy version to mess around, with, it's exactly what any fan could hope for minus the two problem characters. It's easy as ever to stumble across big-hitting combos, which is less rewarding when playing the computer than matching wits with a friend, so this is definitely one to link up on the train/ beach/ plane, whatever. However if you plan going head to head at home through Super Game Boy, you're obviously far better off with the full-blown Super NES original. D AO . BIG DEAL: FINAL The game's biggest selling point is its biggest criticism the outrageous combo 'strategy'. No point arguing its pros and cons here, suffice to say all the King, Master, Killer, you name it, combos are modified for inclusion on Game Boy KI. Ultras are still among the finest ways of finishing an opponent, ever! OVERALL PAUL DAVIES 166 "

Having appeared on a number of formats, Striker is as well known a soccer game brand as the likes of Sensible, FIFA, and International Super Star Soccer. So what should we expect from the PlayStation incarnation of the aforementioned Striker? Well, certainly all of the features and moves we've come to expect from such games are here, only this time souped-up with all of the PlayStation's hardware busy manipulating the players at an impressive speed, not to mention the pitch views rotating and spinning in a groovy way. Ah, if only the game relied on these things... Problem is, the 'make or break' factor with any sports simulation is entirely down to the playability of the game. WHAT A VIEW!

There is fun and enjoyment to be had, but looking forward to FIFA '96, I think Striker '96 remains only 'Adequate'. Though the game can be flowing, there's generally too much long ball play for my liking, and the fact that most tackles result in play stopping doesn't help. Andy Gray (a man I previously had no feelings for whatsoever) is now a man I'd gladly punch for, oh, at least three hours, as his crimes to human sanity are great indeed. I can only refer to the option to turn him off as my favourite feature in the game.

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG SCORES I WANT MORE POWER! LIRILIBRERIA LILLE D BRAZIL JARGENHA 0 ITALY SEGNARE No random 'tonking the ball' here folks, it's all done with a damn handy power bar, which you'll find in the top right corner of the screen. FIFA 96. STRIKER 96 GOAL STORM SPOT SHOTS As is traditional, should you get a throw in or a free kick, up pops a little target for added accuracy. And here come the lads! Pretty enough, but nothing remarkable. ANIMATION Again, nothing much to complain about 69 B IOELAND REP. IRELAND SECOND OPINION PLAYSTATION Though all of the headers, volleys, over-head bicycle kicks, and lobs in Striker '96 are easy to execute and a joy to behold, the gameplay is let down by the fact that, after an initial bout of 'trying to be clever', you'll probably find that just whacking the ball up the field and employing that ageold 'goalie can't stop a diagonal shot' technique always pays the best dividends. Striker '96 features a good selection of teams to play with and a number of conditions to play in which makes it more interesting. Passing play is relatively easy to string together, and having the power bar for shot strength (a la FIFA) and effective after touch also avoids the feeling that you've little control over results. All said and done, I am but one man with one man's opinion, but I think this is totally overshadowed by EA's FIFA '96. MUSIC Not too much trouble with a soccer game, but passable. Just in case you're really stupid, the game shows you enormous flags. Watch out for \"GOAL KICK!\" It's a beauty. Don't know where your mates are? Have a look in the top left-hand corner. SOUND EFFECTS. 70 Clear soeech, but Andy Gray repeats himself over and over. GAMEPLAY ED LOMAS Not completely bad, but the player control Isn't exactly stunning. VALUE. Very much down to how enthusiastic you are about the genre. OVERALL This was such a nasty foul, we got an automatic replay of it! It feels more like a souped-up 'old game' than an original 32-bit product. In danger of being quickly bested by forthcoming footy games from elsewhere. 69 "


"REVIEW CVG REVIEW DONKEY KONG COUNTRY 2: SUPER NES PLATFORM NINTENDO ETBA DIDDY'S KONG OUT DECEMBER 1-2 PLAYERS NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE ith the rise of the super console, we're all just a tad too blasé about rendered graphics and expect much, much more from our games. Diddy's Kong Quest, then, is facing something of an uphill struggle, in order to swing its way into our oh-so sophisticated affections. Still, we very much doubt that anyone at either Rare or Nintendo is particularly worried. You see, Rare have taken heed of their critics and upped the challenge all-round. Also and, perhaps, most remarkably, they've bettered the graphics too. MONKEY MAGIC So Donkey's kidnapped and the Kong Kids are left with the task of rescuing him. Why they didn't bring the police in on the job remains a mystery, however, their predicament is not as desperate as at first seems. Diddy's Kremling-toppling somersault is deadly as ever, and Dixie is not averse to dispatching the odd baddy or nine with her twirling ponytail of doom. Working as a team, Diddy or Dixie may pick up the other chimp and hurl him/her either at an enemy or, better still, up to a hitherto unreachable platform. KREMINALLY MINDED Last month we introduced you to the many Kong-friendly critters encountered throughout the game. This month it's the turn of the bad guys the Kremlings. There are far too many to meet in one sitting. Here are the very worst. KLINGER: If a level's got ropes or chains in it, it's guaranteed to have legions of these scurvy, skinny seadogs in it too. Grr. KACKLE: You can't kill what's already dead, but it can sure have a go at killing you! KLOAK: Spooky Kremling who makes unexpected appearances, then chucks something unpleasant your way. KUDGEL: This frighteningly large klub-karrying Kremling likes nothing better than a spot of batting practice! KLOMP: In keeping with the swashbuckling theme of the game, this Kremling has a piratical peg-leg. VIDEO GAME HEROES KANNON: He's big, he's fat, he's got a big, nay, hu-uge gun and we be most afraid of him. 1 KROOK: Big on overcoats, short on hands. Krook makes his presence felt practically everywhere. KUTLASS: What's small, green, cute and in posses. sion of two sharp and deadly swords? KLOBBER: Plainly this Kremling has lost his underpants. Why else would he hide out in barrels? KAPTAIN K. ROOL: Kommander-in-chief of the Kremling Krew and a frighteningly fixated fan of bananas. KRUNCHA: These huge guys are best left alone altogether bouncing on them makes them angry. OK 29 70 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG Donkey Kong Country is the fastest selling console title ever. But we'd never seen its likes before on the Super NES. In 1995 what more is there to impress? SCORES QUEST BARRELS O'LAFFS Remember those barrel sections in DKC? How we laughed as we died time and time again because we just weren't skilled enough. Bad news: In Diddy's Kong Quest the many barrel-based sections are even tougher. Many of them now have the added peril of being set in bramble-filled mazes that require preposterously accurate navigation. Double bad news: There are also several new types of barrel to contend with. Standard Blaster barrels are now steerable in some sections but only for a short while. Others open or close doors, add or subtract time and even offer temporary invincibility and then you've got to be aware that certain breeds of Kremling choose barrels as their preferred habitat. DK COUNTRY. DIDDY'S QUEST. YOSHI'S ISLAND GRAPHICS.........95 Large, well-defined characters, great effects and beautiful art. ANIMATION Animation on all sprites is incredibly smooth. MUSIC Magical tunes which fit the atmosphere of each level brilliantly. SOUND EFFECTS.. 90 Great ape noises and excellent samples elsewhere. GAMEPLAY Hugely improved and more varied, but just as easy to pick up VALUE. Pricey for sure, but an extremely high quality item. A bargain, even!  VERDICT. OVERALL Better graphics and more polished gameplay make this a better product than DKC in every way. Investigate with extreme urgency! FROM ZERO TO HERO Hey, it's not all about bouncing on baddies and collecting bananas in this game you know! There is much to be gained from collecting the many varieties of coin available: Kremcoins are the only means of paying your way into the Secret levels. Other worthwhile currency is Cranky's Hero Coins. These are perhaps the hardest to find, as they're worth their weight in gold when it comes to the final reckoning at the end of the game. Players with enough Hero coins can even earn themselves a place in the much-coveted hall of fame, taking the podium with a fully rendered Mario, Yoshi and even Link! SNES There was a period last year, shortly after we'd all shelled out for Donkey Kong Country, when we all realised that as smooth and impressive a product as it was, it was easily beaten. Happily this is certainly not the case with Diddy's Kong Quest. It's as silky smooth to play as ever, but tougher by far, thanks to trickier challenges and broader variety of game-styles that see the Kongs negotiating windy tunnels, clinging to swaying giant bulrushes and taking control of a parrot in a race through a deadly thorn maze amongst many other things. Graphically it's more impressive too: The shafts of light that break through the trees in the swamp levels is particularly smart. All told it's a better game and more than I was expecting of a sequel. PAUL DAVIES "


"REVIEW CVG REVIEW PLAYSTATION SPORTS SIM FIFA 96 ETBA NOVEMBER 1-4 PLAYERS VERSION PLANNED AVAILABLE.. VERSION Like all of the big money transfers that have been surprising the Premiership this season, the PlayStation has seen a lot of activity where football is concerned. The latest in a long line of signings is FIFA '96. 0459 (28) P. Kitson I 00:23 ither I see England win the World Cup before I reach 60, or, through the bitter disillusionment of age, I spend my twilight years hunting down every England manager in history (apart from Alf Ramsey of course) and seeing to it that they breathe their last breath strapped to a goal post with the Yeboa of the day aiming rocket shots at their nether regions! Even the European Championships would appease me. Why oh why can't England play like a decent team now and then?! EH? EH?!!... Oh well, at least there are football games where I get the chance to play God and see Blighty lift the magical trophy. In fact, I can do more than that. With FIFA '96 I can also see my club team to victory in the Premiership, play with or against the best in Europe, and even take on club teams from other continents. You see, FIFA '96 is probably the most comprehensive football game yet created, with international and club teams from all over the world. What's more, each team contains the genuine players. So no David Plaths, Ryan Friggs or Steve McScanamons to put up with. Just to top up the sense of authenticity, FIFA '96 also includes commentary from that mine of footballing knowledge and all round commentary guru, John Motson. Expect to see all of the usual stuff found in footy sims from this day and age; like the opportunity to change formation and strategy, instant replays and loads of camera angles from which to view the action. So there you go! Get those studs on, slip in your shin pads, practice your 'you must be joking' expression to use on every decision the ref makes, and kick off! 00 00 00:42 WORLD CLUBBERS One of the really smart things about FIFA '96 is that you can play as a club team. How do you fancy Arsenal taking on the Malaysian club Johor? Well there are eleven leagues from around the globe to choose from. There's even an EA Custom league where top stars from Europe take on the best of Africa, or the old tradition of a great team versus the rest of the world' is possible. Choose to play as a team in the Premiership, and you have a proper season involving home and away matches. VERDICT....... PLAYSTATION FFwd Rew FRIENDLY Game Cam Play FAdv LEAGUE SELECT The PlayStation has been swamped with footy sims since its release, and although the likes of Goal Storm have proved quite impressive, a truly spectacular title remained elusive. Elusive no longer though because FIFA '96 is definitely it. To start with, it plays like a dream. This is football -one-two's, moving in triangles, attacking on the break, set pieces it's all just how you see the real thing. This is thanks not only to the detailed graphics which let you see a player shimmy, turn on the ball and all the rest, but to the really intelligent game logic which makes the pass to exactly the player you wanted it to and maps out the action so that it moves at the right pace. The finishing touch is the John Motson commentary. Normally this sort of thing proves a bit disastrous, but on this occasion there's just the right amount of speech to give the action that extra buzz. One of the best footy sims around. ROB BRIGHT Esglish League English League Arsenal Arsenal It's Arsenal versus the rest of the world! And if you ask Tommy Cox, they're gonna win an' all! "

A Ball camera. Which is absolutely mad! TEAM STRATEGY GRAPHICS Very fine intro sequence, and small but well detailed players. Anyone familiar with FIFA on 16 bit consoles is aware of the various strategy options that are available. The PlayStation version quite sensibly maintains these and here they are: TEAM COVERAGE:This option organises the territory in which you defence, midfield and attack move about. If for example you want to play in an attacking style then both the defensive and midfield territories should be pushing up to the offensive line. TEAM STRATEGY:This is the overall battle plan of your team, whether it be to play a generally defensive, an attacking game, or in moments of pressure an all out defence or attack. Alternatively you can decide to have none at all and free the players up for a touch of inspiration. TEAM FORMATION:Pretty self explanatory really. The most usual formation is a 4-4-2 but if you want to dominate the middle of the park or have some skilful defenders you might employ a 3-5-2. There is also a sweeper system avallable if you feel your defenders are apt to make mistakes. All Out OLEKCE ANIMATION 8 A SHOT WORTH SHOOTING What with the irrepressible John Motson passing comment over the proceedings, FIFA '96 has a distinctly televisual style. Something that is enhanced by the choice of seven camera angles which place you either right in the thick of the action, have you looking down from a distance, or roving around with the action. Obviously each has its merits: The closer you are, the more exciting the action feels, but keeping a distance enables you to see more of the play and thus string together passes and execute set-plays more successfully. TEAM FORMATION Players pull off some really realistic twists and turns. MUSIC............ Bit of wah-wah guitar in there and a catchy theme tune. / Pull those stomachs in! Stick those chests out.

In other words: the second best reason to buy Sony's cool machine this year, is right here! AMMO The Demons in PS Doom have got a far longer reach than the other versions. nce upon the future, there was a marine who assaulted a superior officer. For his crime he was banished to Mars which, by then, was the home of the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) a massive conglomerate involved with radioactive waste on Mars and its two moons. The military had been using UAC's technology to conduct secret experiments, involving portals to transport objects across space. There were a few problems with the early versions of the portals, however, with those poor men forced into them dying rather horribly. And then, one seemingly boring day, some garbled messages were heard through the intercom and the Deimos moon base completely disappeared.

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG GIZ A LIGHT! TROOPER SERGEANT COMMANDO IMP One of the major enhancements to PlayStation Doom is the new, coloured lighting. Rather than the light just being plain old white, in some rooms it appears in a variety of colours, lighting any items and enemies it crosses. Dangerous areas of acid are now often marked with green lights to give you an early warning. DEMON SPECTRE BMORSE LOST SOUL CACODEMON 2000 BARON OF HELL HELL KNIGHT REVENANT DOOM AND DOOM TWO TOO One of the biggest selling points of PlayStation Doom is that it contains Doom 2: Hell on Earth alongside the recently released PC Ultimate Doom. Though not every level from each of the games is included, the final count still reaches 54, and at least one of those is completely new that's not counting at least a few secret levels. PlayStation Doom goes further than being just these two games on one disc, it mixes them slightly so that the doublebarrel shotgun can be collected in the Ultimate levels, as well as the look of some sections being altered by the use of newer textures. By the way, you might want to watch out for the new \"super\" monsters. They're black and transparent and take a lot more damage than normal.

He's the Doominest maniac I know, so if he gives it the horns up, you can guarantee Williams have done the best job they can. All I would like to add is how this game is absolutely, positively a necessity. You'll be playing this for what feels like an eternity. And loving every minute. I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOU With the extra power of the PlayStation, there are also some new transparency effects in Doom. For example, on the first level of Ultimate Doom there was a solid-looking wall which could be walked through but in the PS version it is now partially seethrough. Fancy! PAUL DAVIES AMMO SPAMMO FISTS Should be used only in a \"no ammo\" emergency or when a Beserk power-up has been collected. www CHAINSAW It's excellent fun but has a tiny range.

CHAINGUN Uses the same bullets as the pistol but pumps ammo into evil scum at a ludicrous speed. Ooyagh! (VERDICT PLAYSTATION GAMEPLAY. A brilliant blend of action and puzzles, but can annoy. ROCKET LAUNCHER Rockets cause damage in a large area and on a large scale. Be warned the explosions harm you as well. VALUE. Two excellent games which, on the top level, are rock hard. OVERALL PLASMA RIFLE Shoots high-power plasma energy at a very high rate, using a lot of your precious cell power. Doom is one of the best games ever. There are only a few other games that, in my opinion, are better one of them being VF2. For some people like myself, Doom isn't a game, it's a way of life and that's not Just a cliche. I've played PC Doom far more than any other game in the last year with long nights of single, and multi-play as well as dedicating months to creating my own episode of levels. That just goes to show how it sucks players in, as well as how sad am. When I first played the PlayStation version I just ripped into it, complaining how the levels weren't quite the same as the PC version, how the new lighting made it look strange and how the resolution wasn't quite as high. But after a few days' play! calmed down. This is a very good conversion which combines two of the greatest games ever into one. with a few good enhancements. The sound is a great improvement with the remixed music adding atmos phere and most, though not all, of the coloured, lighting effects work well. There are a few places where it's a little slack, like the way that some of the textures aren't very well aligned but it's got all of the playability of the other versions. I'm afraid that personally I still slightly prefer the PC versions but PlayStation owners really should get this as it's the best PS game this Christmas, and even existing Doom owners should seriously consider it. Awesome! An excellent game, slightly let down by the high difficulty level due to end-of-level saves only. Still an awesome experience to be checked out by every PS owner! Another PS exclusive feature is that the character head at the bottom of the screen now has his brains blown out when killed with a harsh rocket. ED LOMAS AMMO 76 "


"REVIEW REVIEW CVG (PC CD-ROM SPORTS GREMLIN .99 ACTUA SOCCER OUT NOW 1-20 PLAYERS PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE You're it and you know you are... ike London buses you wait absolutely yonks for a decent footy game on the PC, and suddenly a convoy of them all turn up at once. This Christmas footy fans are truly spoilt for choice, and none more so than with Actua Soccer. For a start the graphics are all motion captured (a routine that involves sticking little reflective balls all over a bloke or blokes and then shooting them simultaneously from a collection of different angles). Although, Gremlin deemed it a wise descision to use Andy Sinton, Chris Woods and Graham Hyde from Sheffield Wednesday as its models, but never mind, it's amazing what flaws you can touch up on computers nowadays. If this isn't impressive enough, Barry Davies also does the best commentary that has ever appeared in any football game. He spouts the correct names of all the players, and does so without having those occassional inflection errors that other games proffer. And even the crowd noises are accurately timed for the more exciting moments of the games themselves. There's only International teams, but there are 32 of them, all based on FIFA's official world rankings. This essentially means that Brazil are the top bananas and Wales are currently slightly better than my Sunday league team in fact I'm sure that Wales aren't even in the current world's top 32, having recently been replaced by East Frickley Cup Scouts 11). All the teams, and players, have different skill levels based on their ranking, and some players even have star ratings next to them, which means they are profficient at a particular skill or two. Like most of these games though, the proof of the pudding is in the single player mode, and although this is very challenging and will have you throwing joysticks out of your bedroom window for months, it's when you get a human opponent that the action really comes alive. In fact, why only have one opponent when you can have up to four normally, and if you network the game a whole 20 people can play at the same time. Unfortunately I haven't got that many friends.

"REVIEW REVIEW CVG SCORES | SEE-THROUGH CLOTHES! What made PlayStation Toh Shin Den so appealing on its release was the fact that it featured the first texture-mapped fighters in a 3D home beat 'em up. And even by today's standards the graphics are still mightily impressive. With Toh Shin Den S, Takara have attempted to reproduce the texturing in its entirety on the Saturn; however they fall short in places. Most notably with the character Ellis' translucent trousers, which look more like they're made of net-curtains than lace. You might think this is down to the Saturn being unable to produce translucent textures. However, some of the floor surfaces in the game, such as the Gaia level mist, clearly demonstrate the Saturn's transparency abilities. So it's baffling why the same technique couldn't be used throughout the game. DEVASTATING SUPER ATTACKS! Whilst Toh Shin Den might look similar to Virtua Fighter, it's quite different to play. Whereas Virtua Fighter concentrates on more realistic martial arts moves, Toh Shin Den features loads of special moves of the Street Fighter variety. And all the characters use weapons too, making the special attacks all the more lethal and impressive to watch. Takara obviously want even begin ner's to enjoy the impressive nature of Toh Shin Den's specials, because the control system allows you to unleash one of a range of special moves through just the press of a single button. Even more awesome, if your character is close to death you can press all four buttons to unleash a 'super-special', which takes off a huge amount of your opponent's energy. Expert players may find this \"Davrosian' gameplay annoying, so you can switch these simple specials off if you want. ERREN 38 466938.

ANIMATION Smooth, if slightly sluggish movement. More cartoon than real. MUSIC . 82 GAIA 24750 MONDO The in-game tunes are fairly pleasing, but unremarkable. SOUND EFFECTS.. 81 SATURN When the original Toh Shin Den was reviewed in issue 160 it received a massive 96% with a claim that it was better than Virtua Fighter. I wasn't on the magazine at the time (nor were Paul and Ed) and I certainly don't agree with that mark (and don't think they do either). To me Toh Shin Den has always lacked the instinctive, almost tangible fighting feel of VF. In fact, it seemed more like a inferior 3D Streetfighter clone. And whilst the graphics were kind of impressive, even they didn't appeal to me that much with the character movements looking less realistic than VF. The same goes for the Saturn version, only more so. The gameplay remains as lacking, lethargic and unsensational as ever. And the graphics haven't translated as well, looking more flat and onecoloured than the PS version. Mind you, I don't think that's down to the Saturn's inability to replicate the game. VF2 shows the machine is capable of far more. Oh, and while we're on the subject of VF2, surely talk of any other 3D fighting game is academic right now. For Saturn owners there's only one choice and it's on page 24. Unrealistic, but effective crunchy sounds and weird voices. GAMEPLAY Entertaining, but ultimately shallow fighting action. It never grabs you. VALUE. 55 TOM GUISE VF2 is released this month. What do you want this for? (OVERALL.

GAIA The first boss from the PS game, the giant twinscorpion-tailed Gaia possess some horrendous barb-attacks.

Soon as we know more of them, we'll print a complete guide. Meantime these techniques should keep your friends impressed, as they all definitely work. JADE The unplayable secret character from MK2 is now selectable and has got all-new moves. She throws boomerangs and can perform a smoking shadow kick as well as becoming invincible to avoid fireballs. Her Staff Spike fatality sees her launching her opponent into the air and waiting for them to land on her pointy Bo staff.

The game plays as well as ever before with loads of dark atmosphere and tons of humour making it a great experience. If you see it in an arcade you must have a go, if only to see some of the outrageous moves. But take some time to get into MK3 and you'll realise that it's now up there with the Streetfighter games.

On the Ultimate Kombat Kode screen enter: (12344 44321'. This means that the first digit in the code should be moved on once, the second on two, the third on three, and so on. The middle of the three character boxes will now stay as Ermac until the machine is reset. MILEENA Not surprisingly, Mileena has been included as a hidden character. We don't know her Ultimate Kombat Kode yet but if you play in 2 player mode with the new Randper Kombat code activated, you'll sometime morph into her.

One of the best looking games around is coming soon to PlayStation. Guess what? It's a sport game. PLAYSTATION QUARTER 1 gic SCORE FILL GOALS OF OTHREE PONS FREL HROWS OUR SILALS ROU LOULS US3,SSON CRICACOB here hasn't been a really popular NBA basketball game for ages the only one that did really well was NBA Jam and that wasn't exactly a realistic simulator. The problem with basketball \"sims\" is that they just don't appeal to game players in the UK because basketball has struggled for popularity over here. But, at last, basketball is taking off as a sport in the UK and the first PlayStation basketball sim looks as though it could get a helpful lift from this. The biggest and most noticeable new feature of Total NBA is the graphics. The game is made in complete 3D with texture-maps and reflections adding to the realism. Writing of the reflections, they really do help the 3D-ness of the graphics by making it look as though the lights on the ceiling really are a long way above a highly polished floor. As anyone can tell from the screenshots, it looks lovely when it's not moving but the amazing bit is how smooth the motion is. The motion-captured players all move realistically around the court and some of the dunks they perform are amazing, as owners of the free Demo 1 disc will know. There are also loads of detailed options like the ability to select your complete line-up from all of the real players for each team, which NBA fans will love as it lets them remove any players not up to scratch and shuffle the other players around different positions. Total NBA adds far more to basketball games than just incredible graphics and sound, including one of the most comprehensive basketball game replay features. There are loads of views to fiddle with like the TV cameras, high views, low views, some as big as your head views as well as the usual rewind, fast forward, slow motion and other such effects. Of course, the way it plays is the most important part and from what we've played it's going to be great. Loads of different moves, amazing graphics and sound, detailed strategy options, Total NBA sounds as though it could well be the first basketball game to hook everyone. Of course, there's a CVG review coming soon.

"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG BAKU BAKU Hungry for some puzzle action? Well, get your laughing gear around this gaming feast. Developed by................AM3 Released by:............SEGA Out.. ....NOW (IMPORT) BAKU BAKU 100% complete No other versions planned Arcade version available NET SATURN ISTAGE 2 STAGE 2 : 34 NEXT NEXT STAGE 1 STAGE 1 here's no doubt the Saturn's strength lies in the ability of Sega's AM divisions converting their stunning coin-ops to the 32-bit machine. And the onslaught seems set to continue as AM3 warm up yet another of their coin-op titles for Saturn release. A conversion of the forthcoming Manx TT motorcycle racer perhaps? Well no, actually it's a puzzle game called Baku Baku. Unless you've been to one of Sega's arcade centres around the country, it's fairly unlikely you'll have seen this limited release coin-op, but it does exist (we covered it in issue 165) and it is the work of AM3. What's more, being another title to use the Titan hardware (a Saturn-identical arcade board), it was a simple enough matter to bring the title to the home. The bizarre title actually refers to the sound of eating (similar to the pac in Pac-man) and, in fact, eating is the theme of the game. Similar to Puyo Puyo, pairs of tiles fall down the screen, each one featuring either an animal or a food type. The aim is simply to match the animal with the food rabbits with carrots, pandas with bamboo shoots, apes with bananas and so on upon which the animal munches the food, clearing those tiles off the screen. Sounds simple enough, however the 'combo potential' is massive as you line up chains of food to be cleared, only to drop more animals onto other chains of food. Before you know it, there's masses of animal heads munching their way around the screen! And of course, the result of these chain reactions is to send piles of tiles onto your opponents screen. The appeal of Baku Baku has to come from its brilliant sounds and visuals. Excellent SG-rendered sprites and manical sound effects (such as the 'baku baku' munching sound) make it an insane experience and guaranteed it drew crowds when an unfinished version recently arrived in the office. We'll be reviewing the import version next month. Sega have yet to announce an official release for the game, although when they do you can guarantee it'll be called Knuckes' Crazy Kitchen Fiasco or something. A Munch, snort, drool, crunch!

"PREVIEW | CVG PREVIEW CRITICOM Developed by: ...... VIC TOHAI Released by: ....HRONOS INC TRADING STICKS FOR STONES One of the best features to emerge from an SNK fighting game is the training of special moves, premiered in Art of Fighting. Seeing the wisdom of this, Kronos introduced something similar to give Criticom more dimension. Fulfil any character's destiny, and they are endowed with even greater powers to work into developing more effective combo strategies. Improved fighters also look quite different, especially the character Yenji who, after attaining Level Three status, becomes almost transparent! Generally though, an upgraded fighter's attire just gets larger and meaner! Out ............ FEB\"96 70% complete No other versions planned No other versions available PLAYSTATION A 3D martial arts game that allows players to develop their fighter's skills. Sound interesting? You bet it is. Would have been better, if...\" is just about the most common criticism we here players make about games. And fighting games are the biggest culprits. Toh Shin Den would have been better, if it had the depth of Tekken. Tekken would be perfect, if it brandished a few more Toh Shin Den style special effects. Now here's a fighting game that its producers, Vic Tokai, hope will redress that balance and then some. With the innovative character-upgrades, Hollywood-style special effects, and music to match, developers Kronos Digital Entertainment may well have something special with Criticom. A full appreciation of their work, in the form of the CVG review, is coming soon. Meanwhile here's some condensed info on how Criticom differs from everything else out there. CRITICOM SID (Sentient Integrated Droid) gets it in the nuts and bolts from Delara. Spectacular effects such as this are becoming a PS trademark. A Gorm makes good of his Level Two upgrade an enormous spear! RIDING THE BIG WAVE Criticom looks mostly incredible. From the computer-generated animated intro, to the fine detail lavished on all fighters. This is no surprise considering who's responsible for the visual content: Wavefront Technologies are the company who developed GameWare a software package used by Acclaim, Capcom, Namco, EA, Sony, Midway, and other major developers to create their games. Argonaut, for example, used Wavefront's KINEMATION to produce their FX Fighter game. This is also the technology used in computer-generated ride simulations such as Devil's Mine Ride, (shown above). One thing we're all guaranteed when Criticom is complete, is a state-of-the-art, visual spectacle. O LA TOMORROW PEOPLE Eight otherworldly fighters head up the action in Criticom. Self-anointed 'Chosen Ones', intent on winning a prized relic of untold power. They are mostly humanoid in appearance excepting a Troll-like Dorlon named Gorm, and a Sentient Integrated Droid (SID to his mates). As with Toh Shin Den, they rely heavily on weapons for fun, with the PlayStation producing fancy flares and transparent clouds to accentuate the clashes. Gorm represents the heavier, more powerful end of the spectrum, while Demonica a she-devil is typical of the faster, less damaging breed. Hopefully the playtesters at Kronos honour the artists' hard work by paying close attention to the balance of the game. ASID, once again. This time getting to grips with a transparent (almost) Yenji.

"PREVIEW PREVIEW CVG TRUE PINBALL It's tough making Pinball appear exciting when you can't see or even hear it in action. But mark our words, this one is looking and sounding very cool. Developed by ...DIGITAL ILLUSION Released by:.............. OCEAN Out... JANUARY '95 80% complete No other versions planned No other available PINBALL SATURN LEAN INTO IT Digital Illusions have conjured up four highly realistic tables, that are viewed from one of three perspectives: 3D, 3D High-res, or Top. The first two are almost identical, presenting the table as you would expect to play it in reality. In this mode the screen only has to adjust slightly to accommodate the positioning of the ball. High-res obviously improves the fidelity of the rendered image. 'Top' suspends players above the action, tracking the ball over an enlarged version of the table in what is essentially a plan view. or a publisher to say 'Hello, we're producing a Pinball simulator for the Saturn' is almost like saying 'Watch as I scoop my eyes out with this rusty spoon'. It's not usually a very nice thing to expect, especially when the word 'authentic' is introduced. What's the point of doing Pinball as a video game unless you try something surreal; like Naxat's Devil Crash on the Mega Drive, and PC Engine. We'll tell you the reason: Because when handled correctly it threatens to rule your life! Here's how 'Babe Watch' looks in 3D. This is High-res mode, with more detail. Finally, here's how Top view appears. TABLE MANNERISMS As a primer for next month's review, here's an introduction to the four tables. Including a brief lowdown on the high-scoring opportunities, and descriptions of some of their features. All tables have the monochrome 'video' screens to highlight key bonus points, and announcements made in deep, cyber-sounding speech. KOORBES VIKINGS Plenty of throaty cackling is needed to appreciate this table. Tunes sound like some Nordic horror disco tune, but the bonus chances are pretty hilarious. When the words 'BATTLE ENABLED flash on the VDU, you know it's time to start hammering both flippers like your life depends on it. LAW 'N' JUSTICE The artwork is a mixture of Japanese manga series Patlabor, and Robocop. The theme music would sit pretty comfortably in the next Terminator movie soundtrack! The most common spoken phrase on this table is RICOCHET', indicating a narrow escape from losing the ball. BABE WATCH This one's California, 'cool' all the way. Before the Boogie Woogie music kicks in, you have to trigger the Jukebox. Until then, there's just the sound of waves crashing on the beach in the background. Impress the beach babes in a drag race, and escape near death from man eating sharks. EXTREME SPORTS «LET'S DO SOME WILD BUNGEE JUMPING', flashes the message on the video strip, while Garage Trash pounds away in the background. Somehow this table just gets you fired up before you even start! Loop the loop in a stunt plane, or slam those flippers hard to climb without a rope. 30 HGARES NA OF SALLS:3 CO MUSIC.

"PREVIEW TOY STORY Developed by: ....DISNEY INT. Released by:.............DISNEY Out................ DECEMBER '95 80%. Complete The graphics look unlike anything so far seen on the MegaDrive. SNES version planned Film soon to be available MEGA DRIVE no Famous toys star in the movie. Such as Mr Potatohead. Clockwork Knight on the Saturn Pah! Obviously you haven't seen what the Mega Drive can do! LIGHTYEAR ver since Mickey and Donald's World of Illusion (back in 1993, factfiends), it's been traditional to expect a Disney game on the Mega Drive at Christmas. And a quality one at that. But this year it would seem we've got a bit of a dilemma. After all, a platform game starIring Pocahontas just doesn't have the same action-packed ring as Aladdin or Lion King. And goodness knows what happened to the Pinocchio game that was in development. So where does that leave us? Well fear not, because Disney not only has an incredible animated film up its sleeves, but an equally fantastic Mega Drive game to go with it. And trust us, you are going to be amazed. 86 "


"PREVIEW MEGADRIVE VERSION? TALL STORY MORE LIKE! You might think the Mega Drive incapable of recreating the incredible visuals of the film (seen on these pages), but it does a damn good job trying. And to help it along, some of the animators of the film have actually helped towards the creation of the game's sprites, taking frames of animation from the film's massive character files to authentically recreate the movie's look. The result is a 16-bit game with graphics that look amazingly close to the likes of Clockwork Knight on the Saturn. A coincidence considering the similarity of the game's theme as you lead Woody the toy soldier through 19 levels of oversized obstacles, ranging from a house filled with evil toys, to the dangerous outside world where humans and dogs roam. After over a year of work, the Toy Story game is near enough complete and ready for release close to the film's American debut this Christmas. So you can expect to see a review of this game in these pages soon. Toy Story promises to feature 3D levels too, such as the remote-controlled car jaunt seen here. STORY IT'S A STORY ABOUT SOME TOYS Toy Story is a film that has taken five years to produce and promises to take the art of the animated movie to new heights. You see, unlike the traditional cell animated look that is Disney's trademark, this film is created in its entirety from computer-graphics. Set in a kid's toy room, the film follows the antics of Woody, a toy cowboy (voiced by Tom Hanks), as he attempts to do away with his arch-rival, an newer, more impressive toy spaceman called Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Their rivalry eventually causes them to be plunged into the outside world, where they have to work together to find their way back, only to fall into the hands of the local bully who's renowned for tearing toys apart and putting all the wrong bits back together! 87 "


"PREVIEW MYSTERIA Mystaria eh? What a mystarious name. Not as mystarious as Riglord Saga though. Developed by...MICROCABIN Released by......... SEGA MYSTARIA 100% complete No other versions planned No other versions available f you've been following the import games scene over the last year, you may have noticed a rather interesting Saturn title called Riglord Saga. Riglord Saga was 'rather interesting' because, firstly, it looked a lot like Shining Force an excellent Megadrive battle roleplay game and, secondly, it featured some particularly impressive 3D graphics. Unfortunately though, it was all in Japanese and being an RPG, that made it virtually impossible to play (unless you're Japanese of course), and so it just remained 'rather interesting'. Now however, Sega have taken the opportunity to bring out the game over here, under the all-new moniker of Mystaria, and we can actually find out what it's all about. Mind you, we weren't far off with our original assumptions. Mystaria does indeed play a lot like Shining Force. So much so in fact, that if you've played Shining Force you should get to grips with Mystaria almost instantly. Following the usual plot about an evil warlord (this time it's an evil chap called Lord Bane) taking over a fair country (this time it's a place called Queensland), the game is packed with epic swordand sorcery battles as you lead a band of warriors against his dread legions. First though, you have to find a band of warriors to lead. And so the game begins, as you travel the realm, enlisting warriors to your cause, fighting various groups of monsters, and building up the experience of your troops. Now we can actually understand it, Mystaria looks to have all the elements that made the Shining Force games so addicitve. You'll be able to find out whether this actually proves to be the case when we review the game in next month's CVG. The beautifully-rendered characters as seen in the intro. USE THE FORCE! As with Shining Force, strategy is all important to winning the battles in Mystaria. Even with the small band of warriors you start the game with, you get various types of character and it's important to use each one wisely. For instance, there's no point in sending your healer up against a vicious troglodyte, whilst keeping your big ginger lion-monster-fella sitting around at the back doing nothing. Awrinet ind i group were watching for an upportunity MYSTY EYES! Whilst it might play like Shining Force, Mystaria looks considerably superior to the 'ordinary RPG-style of the popular Megadrive series. In fact, it's Mystaria's incredible 3D graphics that first draw you to the game. Each of the characters has been SGI-rendered and placed onto the full 3D landscape. This is viewed from above whilst you move about. However, once one of your warriors engages in a fight, the view zooms in for a better view of the round. What's more, you can even check out the landscape from a character eye view, panning around at 360 degrees. All the graphics are generated in real-time! contratack. "


"PREVIEW HT C132.1 A The grid indicates how far you can move or attack in one round. CHARACTER BUILDING Although most of Mystaria's game-time is taken up with the battles, there's a fair bit of plot dialogue crammed inbetween all the action, giving you a chance to get to know the well-crafted characters that join your ranks. As each member of your team gains experience, learns new moves and spells, and becomes a better fighter, you're bound to warm to some more than others. Fortunate then, that you can change their names when you first meet each one, so they can all be named after you and your friends (or ene, mies). Fun if you like that sort of thing Spectacular magic attacks can be unleashed! 89 "


"PREVIEW ZERO DIVIDE Developed by:. ..ZOOM ZERO DIVIDE Released by:............OCEAN Out .............. ..FEBRUARY 95 100% complete PC CD-ROM version planned No other versions available PLAYSTATION Sony promised there would be moments like these. Prepare to experience a Virtua style combat game, featuring amazing characters, and awesome gameplay. 87650 BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY Perhaps it is enough for Zoom to have produced a game which looks as fantastic as Zero Divide. The graphics are awesome in no uncertain terms. But what we'd like to draw your attention to first is the innovative, fine-tuned game engine at work here. 16'33\" 70 The 3D, polygonal beat 'em up is fast becoming the platform game of the 32-bit consoles; where 'platform game' is understood as 'tedious and seen-itall-before'. This very month CVG reviews the greatest one of all Saturn's Virtua Fighter 2 scoring 97%. How could anyone have the gall to challenge such an example, unless you're AM2, or Tekken maestros Namco. Why is CVG SO focused on the work of a little known Japanese development company, whose previous works amount to one standard side-scrolling shoot 'em up (Phalanx, 1992), and a sidescrolling beat 'em up (G2, 1994) both of which have done little to honour the Super Famicom. Well it happens that Zero Divide is gaining word-ofmouth notoriety, faster than anything CVG has witnessed in quite a while. Somehow this game is begging for the big time, and it's thanks to Ocean Software that British games players are soon to discover why. Review next month. GREAT MINDS... For the past two months CVG has followed the progress of AM2's latest arcade project, Fighting Vipers. A clever variation on the Virtua Fighter theme, one of Vipers' most original features is the armour system. Incredibly Zero Divide features an armour system of its own, so it's anyone's guess who had the idea first. See how this looks from these pictures (left). 55 ST 756500 Each of the droids' body parts, known as Units, are subject to permanent damage. When this happens that part of the body becomes transparent, revealing the skeletal frame beneath. The injured area also sparks with electricity, which looks pretty cool. As you would expect, damaged units are rendered almost useless, and hurt really bad if targeted again. 40 WHITE KNUCKLE LAST CHANCE! To extend the duration of a fight, and to introduce an extra element of strategy to Zero Divide. droids under threat of a 'Ring Out' are permitted to clutch the arena's outskirts. If they are lucky. From this precarious position, two things may happen: They spring back into action with a light ning attack, or have their appendage crushed and drop into oblivion. 90 "


"PREVIEW CVG 432070 33350 BLOCK AND TACKLE Zoom adopt a lot of Virtua Fighter routines for Zero Divide, most obviously the control. Which means there is a block button to contend with, in addition to one punch, and one kick. But -as VF2 proves so wellcombinations of these three produce impressive results, and Zero Divide allows for juggling techniques, alongside spectacular counter moves to send opponents violently reeling. 168660 8332 The floor in Cygnus' stage is covered in vapour. Where the droids tread, the swirling mist breaks into small clouds. Tap Block and Punch when at close range, to witness a punishing throw technique from your droid. Kerrunch! NOW HEAR THIS! Wipeout retains a lot of its cool through a quality techno sound track. While Zero Divide doesn't benefit from big names such as Orbital, and the Chemical Brothers, it projects some fairly awesome rave tunes of its own. Above all that, there is a commentary of sorts, from an MC called XTAL the voice of the master computer who arranged the whole tournament. Favourite XTALisms that we've picked up on so far include: 'Hey, your unit's gone', 'Great counter', and 'Oooo! That really hurt!'. More on XTAL's sardonic catch-phrases next month. BEYOND THE GRAVE There are many rewards awaiting players who work especially hard to unravel Zero Divide's mysteries. Most importantly there are at least two secret fighters to access, and they are wild! Beyond that, there is a cheat to activate a fully playable 'Tiny version of Phalanx. Though this shoot 'em up was never entirely great, the PlayStation obviously handles the sprites better than the Super Famicom, so it plays better than ever. From what we can tell, Phalanx is included in its entirety which strikes us as being a bit of a bargain! START CONÉIGURATION PHALANH 91991.95 200M ALL RIGHTS RESERVED SCORE: 969000 TL Hanging from the edge is a predicament cunning droids could choose to find themselves in.

"CVG! LETTERS in the What a confusing year! Well, that's the signal we're getting from you this month. If it isn't the choice of machine, it's whether the prices are really too high. On top of this we have people worrying if the hardware they own is really going to last at all! Well, we're always here to talk back, and hand over the stage if necessary to anyone with something big to say. Reach us at: IN THE BAG, COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES MAGAZINE, PRIORY COURT, 30-32 FARRINGDON LANE, LONDON. EC1R 3AU. HE RESTS HIS CASE Dear CVG, I just needed to get this off my chest. I recently purchased a Sega Saturn, and since I have been reading your magazine readers have been getting a little over excited about the PlayStation, and dumping Saturn in the dark. Okay the PlayStation has got Tekken, and Toh Shin Den, and is doing very well. And the Saturn has Rubbish titles like Clockwork Knight. BUT it has also got Panzer Dragoon, Daytona USA, Shinobi X, with Virtua Cop, Virtua Fighter 2, and Sega Rally coming. So here's a message to PlayStation fans: Stop slagging Saturn off, because in a year your all going to want one! I rest my case. Charles Saunders, Fulham. CVG: Well you seem happy as we are with the Saturn at the moment, Charles. I think the trap everyone is falling into with PlayStation is how image-conscious Sony's whole campaign is, With Saturn we're definitely finding it easier to build upon the excitement we've always known to be gained from video games, whereas with PlayStation we're struggling to envision the new era we were promised. Not that PS games are at all bad, we just wonder what happened to the \"If it isn't real time, it isn't a game\" situation. VF2 definitely rules this Christmas, though you just have to see Guardian Heroes it's AMAZING, and not a polygon in sight! HANDS OFF MY WALLET: Dear CVG I am writing to say that I don't agree with the prices for the Sega Saturn, or Sony PlayStation. I mean, some people can afford them because they have the cash. But what about the people that don't have the money, because there are a lot of people that can't afford them. I only get  or  spent on me at Christmas. I know that consoles cost  or  to make. I don't mind about game prices because they cost the same as usual, but why do these consoles cost so much. I don't mind paying  for one, or . But that's the limit. James Shaw, Lincoln. DON'T YOU KNOW ME? Dear CVG, I've been an avid reader of yours for over two years now. I love your mag, and it's the only one I read. I do however have a complaint. Since the 32-bit revolution I've noticed that your attitude towards the 16-bit market has become biased toward 32-bit consoles, considering everything else to be a bit sad. It seems, in some respects, that you're writing off the good old SNES, and Mega Drive (although it seems that Sega have all but forgotten about the latter too). I'm not going to start harping on about your not doing enough 16-bit reviews, because the market is drying up, but I do feel a good deal of respect is due to the Nintendo machine, which has a good few quality titles being released for it: Doom, Killer Instinct, and so on. I think with the price of a SNES so low you can get a system plus SF2 Turbo for  -those people who want a decent system so they can play truly great games but can't afford -400 for a 32-bit machine should go for a SNES and wait. At least until 32-bit prices go down and more games are released. I'm not knocking the 32-bitters of course I'd love a PS but after asking for a SNES for ages, and having to make do with a Game Boy because it was cheaper, what chance have I got of getting a  machine? Please don't forget how good the 16-bit machines have been, and will be to us. CVG: If you remember, James, the Mega Drive wasn't far off  when it was officially released, and many people paid around  for a Super Famicom on import. Gaming hardware has a history of being priced around the  mark (The BBC Model B was !), and the quality of games has advanced beyond belief in the space of a couple of years. If you can't afford a machine by yourself, why not club together with some of mates that's part of what it's all about anyway. Pete Whitehouse, Sutton-On-Sea CVG: We've no intention of forgetting Mega Drive and Super NES. Not yet. But you have to appreciate that support for these machines is definitely waning, and apart from the initial outlay the cost of 16-bit gaming is more expensive than 32-bit, if you're somebody who likes to keep up with the latest releases. Mad isn't it! The last thing CVG wants to do is exclude people like you, Pete, from enjoyment of our magazine. We're currently looking into ways that even those people who are less able to afford hardware can still gain from the features and advice we pass on through our pages. SHUT UP AND DANCE Dear CVG, Here's a message to all readers: All the new machines, whether they be PlayStation, Saturn, or Ultra 64 will have their great games, good games, and poor games, so let's forget all this 'My Dad/ Machine is better than yours. Even the Jaguar has Doom, Tempest 2000, and a couple more good 'uns. For me it's PS. You choose what you want, pay your money, and May The Force Be With You. CVG: Had to include TP's letter because it sums up how we feel most of the time. Of course we're in a better position than most to comment, but the only reason you should ever buy a machine is for the kind of games it offers. Soon as you start looking over the fence, you're always going to be miserable. So long as you stick to the games we recommend, you're guaranteed to have a great time playing. TP Port, Stanwick. "


"LETTERS CVG CHRONICLES OF A 3DO CONSUMER Dear CVG, I've just recently flogged my US 3DO and by the time you print this letter I will be a proud owner of a Sony PlayStation. The purpose of this letter is to warn readers out there who wish to purchase the 3D, to take careful consideration. Obviously we all know software is the main attraction to convince people to buy their hardware and no doubt the 3DO has some excellent titles, but the word \"some\" has been dragging on since its release two years ago. There are probably a majority of worse titles than good ones and possibly the only way consumers can convince themselves to buy a particular title that's worthy of its price is to read a full review or try before you buy method. This is how unreliable the 3DO is, to produce decent software consistently and which brings me to the point why it's called the next generation console. I know the 3DO is beginning to show more potential with games like Wing Commander 3, and Slam 'N' Jam '95, but these games are one offs and it certainly doesn't justify the 3DO's  price tag. You may think I am exaggerating, but one thing that really frustrated me as a 3D0 owner was the inadequate game gun. After purchasing the superb Mad Dog 2, the slow and unresponsive controls on the joypad convinced me to buy a game gun which I obviously expected to be excellent considering it was developed by Laser Games. Unfortunately I was wrong, the aiming control was inaccurate and basically I spent  to get the worst out of the game. I can't understand why ALG never corrected this fault, so 3D owners out there who expect the same excitement given by ALG coin-ops to your machine, are in for a real disappointment. I'm not writing off the 3D0 completely. I hope it does succeed. With the arrival of the forthcoming M2, hopefully 3D0 can learn from their mistakes and in time Trip Hawkins can proudly call it his wonder machine. NINTENDO64 Steven Pierro, North London Steven question costs. He been CVG: Steven raises a number of points here, the main one being that a big name with even bigger promises is seldom guaranteed to deliver at least on time. 3D0 is definitely worth considering now, especially since the price has been slashed to . But, like Steven says, the games have taken a while getting there. We've already answered a question about pricing, and usually this shouldn't be an issue. Stuff costs what it costs. However when shelling out large sums of money, you expect the investment to have been worth it. Neither does it help when the kinds of peripherals launched are poorly supported, and, in fact, poor in general. How many people paid in excess of  for a Super NES Superscope? We suspect Steven isn't the only 3D0 early adopter to have felt very let down by that particular market. All we can say is 'bad luck', and 'M2'. Oops. THE BIG $64000 QUESTION(S) Dear CVG, An apology in advance for digging up two such hoary chestnuts as these. However, in my defence, believe them to be relevant questions and your opinions will certainly help me. I'm 24, and have slowly worked my way up from a 2x Spectrum, to a Super NES. As I'm sure you well know, there have always been choices: Astro Wars, or Invader 2000; ST or Amiga, etc, etc. But then that vital piece of hardware nestling under the tree come the 25th used to be cheaper. Now it comes to spending . At the moment Sony seems to have it sussed: both hardware and software look superior, and all the major chain stores appear to be favouring them. But I read that present PlayStation games are using 70-80% of its power, while present Saturn games use only 30%. With the pedigree of Sega knowledge of the games market notwithstanding, Sega's arcade games always get my coinage over Namco. However if VF2 and Sega Rally conversions fail to impress, maybe even that won't be enough to sway opinion. Then there is Ultra 64. Now I've read that while the Saturn's version of Sega Rally can only look similar to the arcade due to hardware restrictions, the NU64 could produce it exactly. And easily too! But I have had it up to my back teeth with 'vapourware'! So what about the big N better than Sega, better than Sony, and all its chums? Does NU64 make PlayStation and Saturn look 8-bit? Also, should I buy official or import? Both machines cost  now, or  at one chain store if you trade in your 16-bit. I've got a friend in America who could send me one over, no problem. At current US prices the PS costs , and the Saturn . A bit cheaper, but worth the hassle? I think there are enough official games out on both machines for you to see a trend and help us decide. As a UK Super NES owner I've always been mightily cheesed with letterboxes and the magic disappearing 17%. Please categorically tell us is it going to happen again? Already some games have borders and run slower. Is this due to inexperience with the machines or just how it's going to be? One magazine said buy official because of all the trouble involved in buying import games. What trouble? From my experience the classifieds are always full of US/ Jap games, and I buy some UK games mail order and get them next day delivery, it's actually easier than getting off your rear and going to the shops! Which of the three main machines would be the best bet? No buts, dependings, etc as we are playing for big money. And are the US machines better overall, considering performance/ price/ hassle/ in three years' time, etc? It's in your power to help Joe Public. What do you think? Jonathan Palk, Belfast. CVG: Surely you've seen enough of the games scene to judge for yourself, Jonathan, but the time to judge a piece of hardware's success is never at the time it's released. Remember QLSinclair's wonder computer? It promised to beat everything hands down, and showed initial promise too. Then it totally flopped as a games machine. Unlike QL, we know for sure that both Saturn and PlayStation are powerful games machines and can deliver. Exactly what they deliver is, as ever, down to the software publishers. Nintendo 64 is exciting because we know Nintendo, at the very least, will support it with outstanding games whether the architecture is true 64-bit or not. As for imported machines, we have never had a problem with any of ours. No different to anything that could have happened to an official one at any rate. And it seems British Pal systems are forever going to run slower, and with borders on screen with few exceptions. Somehow the majority of developers don't think the extra trouble is worth it. There are many established importers that operate up and down the country, in the same way any import music shops do. Sometimes the price of games is high (especially the Japanese stuff at present) but the situation, again, is no different to if you were chasing a rare CD of a favourite artist. The only consideration is surely necessity to own, and the trust you feel you can place in the dealer. Put it this way, I (Paul) am saving for a Japanese Ultra 64 at present without a second thought. o 97 "
