The only things missing in the latest Access sports sim are the flat shoes and the personal bowling balls. As you will probably have realised this month's offering is a Ten-Pin Bowling game, 10th Frame, from Access software in the USA. The Access team have really earned a reputation for quality sport simulations and this in NO exception to the rule. It runs on the Commodore 64 and I would imagine versions will follow for the Speccy and Amstrad. As yet no firm release date has been set for the UK. On loading you are given a VERY tasty hi-res picture of a bowling ball and pin and then led into the game with options to choose. The first option is League or Open bowling. This allows either individual play or leam efforts of up to eight players a side. You then enter your name and choose a skill level (Kids/Amateur/Pro) and the number of games (1-5). On with the gameYou are presented with a near bird's eye view of the player facing the bowling alley stretching up the screen the pins are put into place automatically. By pressing the joystick up you can then flip control to a cursor to show any rolling bias in the ball as "


"role is that of the ruling power group in the Roman Senate, deploying Roman armies and commanders in successive foreign and civil wars. At any time you will be faced with up to 13 independent hostile powers, each fighting to extend its own sphere of influence at the expense of the others. To give you a military advantage, you have at your disposal the incomparable Roman Citizen Legionaries, reinforced by mobile Auxiliaries and static garrison troops (Limitanei). If you're into fantasy art then you probably won't see a better collection than the works of Chris Achilleos, featured in a new book called Sirens, published by Paper Tiger/Dragons World. It features some truly awesome pictures from the Achilleos collection, which spans Moorcock book covers, film posters, role-playing game box artwork and much much more. And there's even a C+VG cover featured! Chris was the artist who created our October 85 cover. It was an impressive Nazgul riding a reptillian beast. Remember? Anyway, the book costs .95 in hardback and is terrific value at .95 in paperback. It's available from all good bookshops or direct from Dragons World Ltd, 19 Hereford Square, London SW7 4TS. The legend of Big Red lives on! The biggest Bug Hunter keeps on capturing people's imagination. And here's the latest Big Red offering from one of our overseas readers. Mika Kuulusa created this Big Red pin-up on his Amstrad and sent us the tape. If you've created a Bug Hunter pic on computer why not send it in to us? it travels to the pins. Push the stick back and you can move the bowler left and right. To start the bowl, you press the fire button. The actual throw is controlled by two gauges, power and hook. Remember Leaderboard The gauges trigger themselves when fire has been pressed, you can control power and hook by prossing fire when the gouge reaches the desired point. As soon as you have pressed fire the bowler Trundles up to the line and executes the bowl. He is SO SMOOTH the animation is simply excellent. The ball leaves his hand and hopefully runs down the middle of the lane. Across the top of the screen is a scorecard showing your efforts. You can have up to twenty throws to clear the frames. Less if you get a strike, which is knocking all ten pins over with one ball When you have finished your game there is an option to print out the Scoresheet from a printer and a summary/total report appears. The presentation of this game is bang on, from the moment the ball is released the sound of the ball rolling, the impact on the pins and the way they spin off and collide with each other is so convincing. The game is best enjoyed when playing against a friend or as a team. Playing solo gets a little boring. So if you want to thrash the living daylights out of a friend take him on at 10th Frameknock you for six, or eight, or ten even.

"SPACE WELCOME TO It's here! The game which brought a whole new meaning to the words rock n' roll!

D reathtaking graphics and a fabulous hydraulics system are two stunning features in Space farer, a gline which has launched at the beginning of 1986 by Sega writes C&VG's arcade ace Clare Edgeley Space Harrier's gameplay is relatively simple. It involves a lone Warrior, travelling through vast numbers of abstract landscapes knocking out the wonderfully multi coloured baddies which hurtle towards you. All shapes and sizes. Some moving, some stationery. Many deadly if touched! Space Harrier makes you leap around the screen like a cat on hot bricks to avoid all the nasties They don't just appear on ground level either. Some attack at head height, some come in formation. On every level you'll find at least one load of these wretches which which will take some thought to blast and dodge your way through. . It's the graphics of Space Harrier that really caught everyones imagination Specially the amazing Chinese dragons Huge undulating multicoloured monsters which wriggle wildly to the front of the screen ready for battle. You have to score several direct hits to destroy these amazing monsters and you can't move onto the next level until you've got rid of them. There's only one on each level so take heart. That's basically Space Harrier-screen after screen of fantastically drawn objects on all the Spectrum versions of that batch of which get progressively harder and harder recent smash hits ---Commando, Ghosts n' to eliminate.

The action is certainly fast and frantic as Cobra charges around like a raging bull. Cobra's lives are represented as boxing gloves. Is this a clever reference to Stallone's Rocky films?

Bombs in the heart of London have in the recent past been all too real. People died horribly.

But this one is well presented, has got some interesting puzzles, nice graphics, an opening tune which is pretty amazing for the Spectrum, and it's playable as well.

"SCORE & LIUES & ROLLS & HIGH SCORE MACHINE: C64/128  SUPPLIER: ELITE PRICE: .95 cass/.95 disk REVIEWER: CHRIS REVIEWS I haven't stopped playing 1942 since I first loaded it some 10.5 hours ago. The game is so addictive, fast, and furious that it must be my favourite shoot'em-up to date. The first thing that gets you when you load up is the brilliant music. But for the life of me couldn't think of the tune's name. It's one of those old war tunes that sticks in your mind and you hum it for weeks. After questioning the family, friends, and relations, Jasper the dog finally came up with the goods. A Despite its title, this game's right up to date. I can now reveal that the tune is from the film 633 Squadron, an old British war movie. Now back to the game... The idea is to fly your aircraft from carrier to carrier across land and sea shooting down loads and loads of enemy planes. You guessed it-24 stages of pure blasting! At the start of each level, you take off from your aircraft carrier and head for the enemy. The screen scrolls up and you are attacked by nasty little planes which are willing to die just to stop you. These guys don't mess around! If you shoot the right fighter, it will change into a special \"POW\" sign which, when picked up, will give your humble plane extra capabilities. On the first couple of levels, You can also protect yourself life, and you have three lives. you are given an extra gun, for a short while by doing a roll. When you have the extra allowing three bullets to be When performing a roll you go planes and three guns you will fired at once, on later levels you out of the enemy's line of fire find knocking out large get two escort planes which fly and can come out of the most bombers extremely easy but either side of you and help you vicious attacks unscathed. You You will be an easier target for battle on. are only allowed three rolls per small kamikaze planes to hit. 1942 When you reach the waiting carrier, a tune will play and you will be thrust onto the next level. Some areas have different names, starting with Midway then Marshall, Attu, Rambual until you finally reach The Final Area. When you get there you'll know the meaning of the word tough! The graphics are clear and colourful. Sound comes in the form of that fantastic tune, which really drives you on during the game, and also various spot effects which, although clear, are a bit flat The game is a blast, and if you don't buy it then you don't deserve a 64. It's that simple. Well done Elite. Can we have some more like this? GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY SEPULCRI different. The robots movement is well animated especially when jumping when it does a kind of hitch kick. Its eyes open and close continually while walking and jumping giving it an endearing quality sadly lacking in the central characters of some games. Especially useful for map freaks is the screen dump feature which lets you make a hard copy of any location at the press of a button. The one real niggle with this game though is the number of times you have to be standing in a pixel perfect position before being able to successfully make a jump.

Only a mere 60 years late and 42 trilliant mega-bucks over budget the system still needed to be tested. But how to test SDI without starting the war it was designed to stop? Well, those awfully clever NASA chaps have come up with a tiny robot, so tiny it can wander around the satellite's circuit boards examing all the components of the main computer, reporting back if it finds any problems. As you control the robot inside the computer you will encounter many 'bugs' and miniature sheep (inserted into the system instead of the usual RAM-geddit?!!) that will bring on a sudden case of death if touched.

However once you've managed to get the correct suit colour your troubles are not over. When you move onto the floor your suit flashes which means you are vulnerable to attack from the guardians. To survive you must zap the guardians, enabling you to change suit colour again. Confusing, itsn't it. It's much easier to play it than say it. The screen layout is well designed. The top part is taken up with indicators for the colour switch, suit colour, and damage. The bottom section So you think you know better than the likes of Bobby Robson, eh? Well now's your chance to prove it. You've got a team, a budget, and 15 league matches to play. You're starting at the bottom of the fourth division with everything to play for. It's over to you, pal... No, not so easy, is it? You've got your squad, but six of them rate low on fitness, one is injured, and several don't measure up in skill. You've got a fixture coming up against Crewe, and juggle the team as you might, your boys just don't compare with their opponent's in attack, midfield or in fitness. True, you're about equal in defence, but that's not going to get you very far, is it? OK, so you lost that match 3-0. That means you're still stuck at the bottom, and you need to be in the top three to win promotion at the end of the season. The punters are counting on it. Gate receipts won't hold up if your performance is disappointing. Yeah, you could buy that promising attack player, he's good value, but that will put you further into the red. You could recoup by selling that useless midfield player, Whatsisname, but you'll need to spend more on training if the lads are to have any chance against United. And don't forget your goalie might be the best in the world but he's exhausted and you'll have to rest him... If you ask me, all those muchreviled managers got together and wrote this game just to get their own back on the armchair critics. It's good fun, whether you're a football freak or not, although the presentation is pretty ropey mostly horrible mode twotype text, unpleasant to read. I can tell you, after this you'll think twice before you slam the manager, after your team has gone down the tubes for yet another season.

Otherwise, it's just take your pick and play away. The first section is set in a jungle. Flash must find Prince Barin in his cave. A map is essential if you don't want to get lost. Monkeys, lizards, wolverines and skeletons lurk in the undergrowth. Snakes lurk in the trees. Flash can blast away, reloading his gun from boxes of ammo. But remember, if you bungle in the jungle, Flash pays with his life. In the fight section Flash must fight Prince Barin. The idea is not to kill him but to earn his respect. If you can do this he will allow you to pass through his caves onto the surface for the final confrontation with *** The drums ... the drums...! can't stand the drums... they're driving me wild... Actually, they're rather good. If Mastertronic keep turning out games such as this they'll be in grave danger of giving budget software a good name. Well, once again, Flash, saviour of the universe, alltime-good guy and hero, must battle the evil Emperor Ming. The game is really three in one. You get arcade adventure, fight simulation and high-speed race action. You only have to play them in sequence if you Ming. Box clever to win respect. The fight action is typical of the numerous other martial arts games around. Both characters can jump, kick, punch etc. Try and concentrate on combination head and body blow. If Barin start to give you a right pasting, back off before going on the offensive again. The longer the fight lasts, the more Barin will tire, reducing his jumping and mobility. The third and final section is bike race action. This itself is divided into three sections. Flash must first shoot down the winged robots. He has to do this to attain full speed on his bike. Next he must face the perils of a minefield and finally comes the ultimate confrontation with adequate. Now if you'll excuse me, must work out how to topple this rock so it crushes that monster without burying that diamond there or cracking that egg, at the same time leaving myself an escape route so I can dodge that spirit...

The aim of the game remains the same-to clear each level of diamonds, including the ones tucked away in cages and safes, while killing all the mosters. It's as gripping, entertaining and downright frustrating as REPTON 3 I never made it to the final confrontation so I'm afraid that area of the game remains a mystery.

Succeed and this turns your ship into a \"bat\" in which to knock the balls into the home slot. This much can only be achieved if they can bang the balls in cleanly at an angle of 45 degrees (I couldn't). Finally the rogue balls must be guided into the four corners of the screen. Only when this has been achieved can you get on to the bonus screen. The remaining -02 screens have similar objectives. Starburst is a high speed shoot-'em-up but which is dazzlingly colourful and designed to wreck the reflexes. It's fiendishly difficult but, I have to confess, I found it confusing to play.

Yes, all these sounds come from LA Swat which isn't about killing flying insects despite the name. It's an action packed offering that will appeal to fans of Green Beret and Commando. Just when you thought it was safe to go back out on to the streets a gang of terrorists take over the West side of LA. Your job is to clean up the streets by wiping out the terrorists. Simple, huh?! No, not really, because you also have to solve a hostage situation at the end of each level. Don't shoot the hostage while you blaze away at the manic terrorist or you'll live to regret it. You get a bird's-eye view of the streets packed with terrorists. The terrorists look a bit like skinheads. They are armed with baseball bats which they use to bash you with. They also have grenades whch are deadlier at longer range. There are also snipers who take pot shots at you but you can hide behind overturned cars, a really nice graphic feature this, and shoot the mad qunners. No offence Arsenal fans... You can also hide in the gaps between the buildings to attack the skinheads. The only real gripe is the scrolling it's a bit slow and not at all smooth. But the hectic action soon makes you forget all about this. The city streets are well drawn and the sounds are simply brilliant. This must be the best Mastertronic Atari game I've ever played. Anyone who disagrees with me can just go and chew a brick! GRAPHICS SOUND OTVO  VALUE PLAYABILITY ANGELES SWAT It's time to declare an interest. Starburst is the product of C+VG's ace Hot Gossiper Tony Takoushi's fevered mind. TT, as anybody who's read his page knows, eats, breathes and sleeps games. His passion for arcade games is apparently endless and it certainly shows in Starburst. He's tried to pack everything he loves about them into the limited memory of the C16. The plot is simple: The planet Sistasis has exploded, leaving Plastron boulders floating in space. You must do battle with these deadly rocks. In all there are three screens to zap through plus a bonus screen in which a lot of points are up for grabs. You start the game with four lives, shown in the form of coloured gauges at the top of the screen orange, purple, yellow and green. If a boulder touches your ship, the gauges begin to pulse and decrease until eventually the game is over. Of the eight boulders or balls zapping round, just four will start the gauges pulsing, these being the same colour as the gauges. The other balls are rogues and are generally designed to annoy you.

All V The Construction Set adds a new dimension to a classic game, Here's a nifty bit of software that no true MM fan should be without-the only problem is that 64 owners aren't likely to get a chance to play around with this useful utility because Melbourne only have the rights for Speccy and Amstrad. What you get is the normal Marble Madness game plus an editor which allows you to construct your own MM tracks complete with all the nasties like bubbles, oil slicks and Mary Poppins flying umbrellas. All the ingredients of the arcade classic You can build your tracks from scratch or simply edit the ten different tracks already included in the program. The construction screen shows a smaller version of the play area with icons representing the different MM track sections ranged down the right hand side of the screen and the nasties/bonus scores/ options along the bottom of the screen. other aliens and special features are placed using the cursor and the fire key, Once you've built a track you can try it out by selecting the \"test\" option. And it doesn't work out you can go back to the edit mode to put things right. You can go on adding screens until the memory is full up and then you can save your designs, and go back to creating more new MM challenges. Fancy a break from building? Then just go back to the main menu and select the play the game mode. This gives you as good a game of MM as you can expect on the Speccy. The construction set makes MM a whole new ball game every time you play! ano MM chreakt 20000  GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY COCO "

That's always been a philosophy close to the heart of software houses. And when you've got a game as good as Yie Ar Kung Fu it's no bad deal for the punter as well. It's more of the same, a lot of bop, bam, boom as the fists and feet fly in all directions against seemingly endless warlords of the Ye Gah Emperor. The Kung Fu master you control is Lee Young. In my case he would be better named Die Young because that is what he did. I became very used to everything! As you start, the computer takes the lead, using skill like you've never seen to take the most dangerous of corners. This computer biker is good! On the next course, you learn about one of the most annoying parts of what is otherwise a super game. This irritating aspect is the fact that if you and the computer collide, only YOU come off. Yes, you lose time and the machine just keeps going. This gets really bad when you are just about to win. You are neck and neck. Then the computer turns into you and POWI, you're out! What a cheat!!

Heartland was originally released on the Spectrum a couple of months ago and, by all accounts, did very well, thank you very much. For those of you that were unlucky enough to miss the Specy version the story goes something like this. Eldtritch the wizard, a goodly soul if ever there was one, has left the Heartland for pastures new. Before he went he built up a healthy reputation for staying dragons, rescuing damsels in distress and all the other heroic deeds wizards get up to. All his knowledae was passed down in a book left to the Heartland to protect it from evil. One of the nastiest pieces of work Eldtritch had to deal with in the Heartland was a character by the name of Midan, the dreaded Black Warlock, and the wizard's arch enemy. During their last barney Midan cast the last chapter of Eldtrich's book to the seven winds, thus neutralising its power. Your task is to find the last six pages of the book before Midan's evil spreads throughout the land. Unfortunately, to confuse you, Midan has also left six 'dark' pages in the Heartland, which must be destroyed or your quest will have been in vain. Screen layout is crisp and colourful using the Amstrad's 16 colour mode showing a sideon view of each location in the five lands containing the light and dark pages. Locations are linked by doorways through which you can move into, or away from, the screen, as well as exits to the left and right which means that the only sensible way of mapping Heartland is by making a plan view map of each level. There are two of Midan's picking up a seventh page, cronies in almost every which immediately causes the location.

It's only a one player game but it does have a Gauntlet style screen and four-way scrolling.

OK, the boring ones among will look at the screen shots, put on the voice of Neil from The Young Ones and say: \"Hey, but it's just like Green Beret.\" But that's where you are wrong. Green Beret didn't have big cartoon style graphics. Green Beret didn't have a dog-fight sequence. Green Beret didn't have BB's neat soundtrack which really drives the action along. And Green Beret didn't have a sense of humour Bill's mission is pretty simple, He has to use all his fighting skills to reach the island in the South Pacific where General MacArthur is being held captive by revolutionary forces He starts the game in the city totally unarmed except for his bare fists, which he uses to good effect.

All Skimmers are equipped with different gear detailed in the info section. The equipment includes missiles and lasers of course-but this time you also get delay bombs which are VERY useful in tight corners. Each of the built-in Skimmers has different capabilities but you can construct your own. Access your rating on each of the missions by selecting the Progress Report option. This will display the four missions available on the level along with a score for each mission and an average score overall. As I've already mentioned it is possible to design and equip your own ship for ANY mission. Academy GALVAN Corp's budget will not stretch to designs costing over 100m credits. If either of the two figures are over the limit they will show red and you will need to remove some items of equipment selected. When you are happy with the equipment selected move the pointer to the \"Design Complete\" option. This will take you into the Design Panel section, where you can design the Skimmer's Panel layout. If you have chosen a large complement of equipment for a Skimmer design you may find it a little tricky to fit all the items in the available screen space, a useful hint here is to tuck the viewscreen away in a corner of the display to allow you to place dials or gauges off to one side. You can save your game position at any time, and you relying on info about the different missions supplied by the Gal-Corp briefing team. From the main menu you can can save your designs. To move on to the next level and the next block of four missions you must have an average score of 90 per cent. All this and I haven't even mentioned the D.E.A.F. subgame or the CODES puzzle you'll need to solve on some missions. But every game has got to have its secrets. Academy is immensely playable and totally addictive. You'll be thanking Mr Cooke for putting the SAVE option in. It'll mean you can actually get some sleep... The arcades have proved a gold mine recently for software houses looking for new games. Galvan, however, proves that not all coin-ops happily make the transition to computer. To be honest, I don't remember seeing Galvan in the arcades, but Imagine says these conversions are quite faithful to the original. All I know is that certain parts of the Amstrad game gave me severe eyestrain and a headache. Some of the colours are so garish that the lance straight to the back of the eyeball. Ruined reviewer's retina isn't fun. Add to that some pretty violent juddering instead of scrolling and you've got a game I found very hard to play for more than a few seconds. The same lurching also afflicts the Spectrum version (reviewed last month). The Commodore version is much easier on the eye and, if I'm forced to make a choice, gets my vote as the version to play. At least the game scrolls smoothly. Galvan, the character you control, is the lone surviving member of the Cosmo police. His task is to rid the Techno Caverns of the Planet Cynep of androids, robots and various other lifeforms, including multiheaded demons. Not the most original plot, I hear you cry, but in the bop, bam, boom world of shoot'em ups that really doesn't matter. It's the action that counts, and the slick way it's carried out. For me Galvan doesn't have enough action or slickness to make it a great conversion. As Galvan moves around the screens he encounters power pyramids. These boost his energy and will give him more powerful weapons, ranging from a blue bolt neutraliser or arc blaster. For a lot of the time he must use his fists to get out of trouble. Galvan involves a lot of manic, and panic, movements mixed up with frantic zapping to keep the nasties down. But Amstrad owners beware-it's painful on the peepers. Your energy level is represented by a bar on the screen. My always seemed to be at an all-time low and that meant he has to talk with his fists to survive. It's a shame I've never been really good with giving people a swift one two and a mouthfull of the knuckle sarnie. Of the three formats Galvan has been released on so far, it's Commodore users who get the best conversion. But even that one isn't exactly the bee's knees. AMSTRAD CBM64 GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY Complete There is a list of possible equipment. In the centre are two or three boxes showing whether the Skimmer has the equipment/ how many items the Skimmer has/what strength the unit has. The two main limitations in equiping a ship are the weight of equipment and the total cost, both shown at the bottom of the screen. The basic Skimmer hull will not carry a weight of over 100 Galactic Megatons and GalGRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY fighting them off. Easy for veteran Sanxion and Uridium players. Then it's off to do a bit of island hopping with more firefights on the ground and in the air to keep you busy until you reach your objective. If you lose all five lives the game gives you the option to start again where you left off if you are quick enough to beat the ten second countdown and hit the F5 key in time! Why can't all action games have an option like this. No more boring back to the beginning blues here. The bad news is that you don't get to keep all the weapons you've collected! Bazooka Bill is an action packed, addictive, arcade blaster. The graphics are big and butch enough for any would-be Rambo, and it doesn't take itself as seriously as Green Beret either. The great music and sound effects are the icing on the cake Don't be put off by people who tell you you've seen it all before just grab the joystick and make your own mind up.

"COMMODORE Anthony Winter of Tyne and Wear has found a cheat for Fist II, which will allow you to walk on water, walk over pits and waterfalls and walk past guards and other nasties. When you move and the screen starts to scroll press \"Restore\" until your fighter freezes. If you do it correctly your fighter will continue to move without moving his body. To make move normally press \"Restore\" until he does. While in this mode you will not see all of the main sprites and so cannot pick them up. Dominic Hoare of Kent also found this to work on his C128 (in C64 mode). He also found that some fights cannot be avoided and so if you walk into a room in which there is a man with a lot of strength, then walk out and in again until the computer decided that he is a man of little strength. Thanks guys! A couple of issues back a reader was asking for some help in getting into 'witch-space on Elite. Denzil Herron of Middlesex sent in this solution -first freeze the game and press the letter X then restart the game and when you go into 'hyper-space press the CTRL' key during countdown, you will then enter 'witch-space. this will also work on C64. Denzil noticed that while playing Elite on his C64 that if you sell more than 10 kg of platinum you do not get the amount of credits that you are owed, so, you should sell platinum at 10 kg a time. Toby Flight also heard the plea for help and wrote in with this lot something unmentioned in the manual is that if you press 'F' whilst on long range chart, the words 'Planet name?' appears. Just type in the name and it is pointed out. Useful for finding planet Orarra in Galaxy 2 where the constrictor lurks. When in Witch space, shoot a mothership and release an energy bomb. The invasion craft only release a certain amount of Tharglets at a time, so you can shoot them down without too much interference. Never ever buy Trumbles. They are a pain and cost 6,000 cr.

"C+VG COMPETITION GIVE AN ARCADE MACHINE A GOOD HOME! ABOUT THE GAME! XEVIOUS ver wanted your very own arcade machine? Bet you have. Imagine it sitting in the corner of your living room, lights flashing and making friendly bleeping noises. Better than a budgie, isn't it?! And just think how envious your friends will be ! You'll be able to have coin-op challenges in the comfort of your own home... Admit it. We've got you hooked. Well, along with our friends at US Gold, we're offering YOU the chance to win a genuine Xevious arcade machine. This Atari coin-op was a mega-hit in the arcades and US Gold are about to release the computer versions of the game. And to celebrate that and Christmas of course! they've come up with this truly awesome prize for the winner of C+VG's Xevious Xtravaganza! And that's not all. Second prize winner will get a US Gold Grab Bag packed with US Gold games for his or her machine. Then ten runners-up will get a copy of the Xevious computer game which will be available on the C64, Spectrum and Amstrad. Five more runners up will get a Big Red T-shirt. Now this MUST be a competition you can't afford not to enter! What do we want you to do? Simple. Just send us a drawing or painting of a Xevious space ship. It could be the attacking fighter, enemy defenders or even the Mothership itself. Let your imagination run riot,'cos we'll want to print the best illustrations in a future issue of C+VG. You can use anything you like to create your picture and it can be any size. Once you've finished your picture just send it to Computer+Video Games, Xevious Xtravaganza, Priory Court, 30-32 Farringdon Lane, London EC1R 3AU. Closing date for the competition is January 16th, normal C+VG rules apply and the Editor's decision is final. Remember to fix the entry coupon to your picture, otherwise we won't be able to accept it, and don't forget to tell us what machine you own, or what size T-shirt you'd like. What are you waiting for -Santa? Xevious, a four year old veteran, can still be found tucked away in the corner of most arcades. Its classic battle sequences have never really become outdated, and it's just about to enjoy a new lease of life, thanks to US Gold who's releasing the computer version. Atari originally released the game in 1983 in the UK, though it was in fact programmed a year earlier by Y Endo, an employee of Japanese based Namco. On joining Namco, Endo wrote a three-part scenario based around the planet Xevious and its inhabitants -artificially intelligent beings, which ungratefully turn nasty and threaten the planet's very existence. The game is viewed from above, though that rather flat look present in many early games when played from this viewpoint is not too obvious, thanks to some excellent graphics and a clever use of shading which gives the background more depth. Skimming above this peaceful backdrop of forests, rivers, plains and vast stretches of water are the deadly shapes of the enemy of which there are about 24 types, all different but with one thing in common-they all spew forth deadly accurate firepower which looks unalarming, rather like cannon balls, but are fatal on impact. Many of the enemy bases are stationary, but they will track your progress, firing in your direction as you try to slip past. Flying over Xevious is similar to a desperate shoot and dodge game. If you don't get the enemy installations before they fire at you, you end up having to dodge the cannon balls difficult when they interweave to block your run up the screen. The enemy mothership is, of course, particularly tricky, being massive and extremely well fortified with cannon emplacements. Still, if you accelerate, decelerate, twist and turn, you might just make it through with a whole skin and hopefully with a decently respectable score, too. There are various tricks to earn bonus points-flying over the odd flag is just one way and if you blast certain objects on your flight through the game, hidden characters will appear. There are dozens of methods of playing Xevious which can only be found through trial and error, although a book has been published giving away vital playing techniques to anyone interested in getting a high score of ten million. Xevious might be a oldie but it still ranks as one of the all time classics. The proof is in the fact that it's still around in the arcades. The only problem is that the damn editor won't let me enter the competition!! 10M C+VG/US GOLD XEVIOUS XTRAVAGANZA Name.

"Silence in court. The Joystick Jury has assembled again to sit in judgement on the latest batch of these essential game playing aides. There's been a whole lot of powerful pulverising going on as the joysticks have been subjected to trial by terror and torture. The jury is about to return its verdicts... THE RATINGS EXPLAINED In accordance with normal C+VG practice, all the joysticks featured here have been graded on a scale of 1-10. For those of you who insist on percentage marks, just add a zero to the score. The categories investigated are as follows: Accuracy: Does the joystick fire when you want it to or does it have a mind of its own? A vital rating, we think. After all, who wants to move right when you intended to go left? Ergonomics: Never use a simple word when a more obscure one will do. This category looks at design. Does the joystick look and feel right? Strength: Otherwise known as the Big Red wrench test. Is the joystick likely to fall part with the least provocation or melt in your hot, sweaty hands in the white heat of battle? Overall: Is this the biz or not? Does it do its job properly. The Game:To try and introduce some consistent standard to the tests all the joysticks were used on Ikari Warriors. We were going to use SAnxion but we lost our copy of the game. SPEED KING PRICE: .99 FOR MOST MACHINES. .99 FOR BBC, C16/PLUS 4 AND DRAGON This is the joystick that's hot at the moment. If you believe the makers and PR hype, it's selling faster than the speed of light It's designed to be hand held. There's no base or suckers so you can't stick it to the table. It fits snuggly into the left hand, forefinger curling under to hit the fire button. The stick itself is operated by the right hand. If you're left-handed, forget it. It's almost impossible to hold, and you'll stand no chance in a high speed zap session The shaft looks fairly fragie but is very responsive and looks a lot tougher hard earned cash. than it appears. ACCURACY All in all the Speed King is a nice ERGONOMICS little performer. But you'd better try it STRENGTH  OVERALL out for size before parting with your Machines: Spectrum, Spectrum Plus, CBM 64, 128, Vic 20, C16 and Plus 4, Atari, BBC, Electron, 8 Dragon, MSX, Amstrad, Oric. 5 Maker: Konix Computer 8 Products, Unit 13, Sirhowy Hill 8 Industrial Estate, Tredegar, Gwent. MAGNUM  PRICE: .50 The Magnum, Mastertronic's first foray into the world of joysticks, is another hand-held model. At least this time its ambidextrous design should present no problems to left-handed players. As the name suggests, this joystick is gun-shaped, with the fire button falling under the thum and the shaft on top. It fits nicely in the hand and a prolonged playing stint produces no really bad side-effects on the hand. Both fire button and shaft perform well, responding instantly to action. The one drawback is that it dosent feel too sturdy and you get the impression it may not be able to stand up to month after month of zapping. It also comes with six foot of cable. Mastertronic claims this is more than with any other joystick. This, of course, enables you to stand or sit a long way from the computer screen. Which is fine if you have the eyesight of an eagle and can still see what's happening on Machines: All major home screen. computers, C16 and Plus 4 and  ACCURACY 8 Sinclair Plus 2 needs adaptor.

"FINGERS PRO ACE  PRICE: $11.95 For some strange reason the Pro Ace is very pleasing to look at. I just happen to like the black matt finish set off by the rather big red (no pun intended) fire button. But that's about all there is really. The whole thing is sturdily built and will no doubt last but was almost immobile, making response time quite slow. The whole thing was also a little uncomfortable to hold in the hand, all angular edges jutting into the palm. A miss with the jury. ACCURACY 6 Christmas is a time of peace, goodwill and joy (sticks) for all arcade players. Others on the market at the moment: Check out Cheetah's 125+ at .95. It features two base fire buttons and a third situated at the top of the stick. A fourth fire button is on the front of the stick, lying under the forefinger. Slightly more expensive for Cheetah at $14.95 is the Match I+. It's compatible with all major computer makes. Britannia Software is also marketing a new hand-held stick called the Phasor One. It looks similar to Mastertronic's Magnum stick, vaguely gun-shaped with the shaft on top of a pistol grip. It costs .95. ERGONOMICS STRENGTH OVERALL S Machines: All major makes. 7 Maker: Euromax, Pinfold Lane, 6 Bridlington, North Humberside. GUN SHOT  PRICE: .95 Pretty much a standard looking joystick, with four suckered feet for firm anchoring to the table for all those important moments. It has two fire buttons, one on top of the stalk and the other on the base. It also has autofire option if you really want your enemies to bite on a stream of bullets. The stalk is smooth, so if your hands tend to become a little sticky then there's a chance it could slip. Overall, the joystick peforms well and has the mark of durability about it. ACCURACY ERGONOMICS STRENGTH OVERALL 8 Maker: Valcan Electronics, 200 7 Brent Street, Hendon, London. ELITE  PRICE: .95 Odd shaped and sturdy-looking, the Elite is a disappointment when you get to grips with it. The shape makes it very uncomortable to hold and the auto-fire button has to be held down all the time. We even bound it up with sticky tape to keep it blasting away. It does, however, respond well and has the feel of something lasting a long while. We feel it's a little bit of a let down when you consider the quality of past Euromax joysticks. Overpriced as well.

"On the EMPEROR'S SECSEE SEVICE SPECTRUM Story, design and concept by Mike E. Turner Programming by Paul Jeffries. A Star Dreams production for C+VG. Extract from Topsy's History of the Galactic Empire Vol. IV) By rule year 4010 the Emperor Icetor had control of more than 600 inhabited worlds, although the real power lay in the hands of the elected civil service which loosely ruled democratic governments on each planet. The Emperor saw his role as figurehead and, although he maintained a far-reaching secret service and could technically still override all other governments, he had no such intentions. This, however, did not please his son and heir, the mad rince Wilhelm, who wished to assasinate his father and begin a tyrannical command of the empire. \"That's him,\" Riggs snapped a switch down on his desk. \"The agent id. \"Rush him up to me.\" is here,\" he said. Â«Rush him up to The young man in the cloak suddenly discovered that custom and immigration formalities didn't seem to apply to him. Within five minutes he was sitting in the Commander's office. \"I have, of course, a mission for you. A very delicate and dangerous mission.\" Riggs looked carefully at his visitor. \"I trust the pay's good then,\" retorted the agent. \"It needs to be, this is a tough one,\" sighed the Commander. \"Now with your contacts, I assume you know that Prince Wilhelm has escaped.\" \"It' was rumoured that he was developing some new weapon, but nobody knows where.\" \"The prince has a space station in orbit around Beta 5 here. It has a unique defence. It's invisible!\" this leaked out, and the public realised how far the prince has got, the trading markets and maybe even the security of the galaxy would be in jeopardy.\" \"I see. If I can do something here, I'm a hero. If anything goes wrong, you've never heard of me?\" team will be selected by you from \"Correct. For this reason your volunteers currently in prison. You will be given details of their various skills and you will pick two people.\" \"Yes, this is all very well, but you haven't told me what you want me to do yet.\" \"Quite.\" Riggs paused to open a map out across the desk. \"The surface of Beta 5 is mostly sand desert. The atmosphere is breathable, though a little thin. On the eastern continent just here is a settlement of a small group of space pirates. They prey on the star lanes that pass close to this system. Now the Prince is using them to protect his operation here. Somewhere below their base, or maybe in their base as most of it is underground, there is a safe. And contained in that safe is the Co-ordinates of the space station. One of our operatives found this out, but was unable to actually set those figures. If we knew those exact digits, we could teleport onto the station! \"And all you want is for me to break into the base, find the safe, crack it, get the co-ordinates and radio them to you? Hardly worth mentioning really,\" the young man intoned, sarcastically. \"Told you it was a sticky one. Mind you it's worth a million credits if you succeed, and your team will be freed from their jail sentences with a fat bonus, too. Always supposing you all survive...\" \"Oh I'll try to do that all right, if it proves at all possible.\" A grin almost appeard on the young man's face as he spoke ... Ses cose \"How do you mean, invisible,\" interceded the agent. \"If you can't actually see it, it must be detectable by other ways.\" \"No. Not only can it not be seen with the human eye, it can't be detected by anything we've got. Not by sensor, laser, heat, mass or anything else. We know it's there, but it doesn't appear to exist!\" \"So why not send a fleet of battle cruisers to bombard the area?\" 'No I'm afraid the situation is a little too delicate for that. If any of "

"LAW BETTER THAN CHEAP If you're lucky enough to have a new Amstrad PC-1512, how d'ya fancy lots of free software for itÃ© In America, where the IBM PC has been a popular home computer for around 5 years, there are literally thousands of programs that have been placed in Public Domain, as it's called. Public Domain programs are usually found on bulletin boards for downloading, and it's perfectly legal to copy them and even make copies for your friends. Some public domain software is known as freeware, which means that no one is charging any money for it. Some, though, is known as shareware. Like freeware, you are allowed to copy shareware programs but, if you decide that you like the program and want to carry on using it, you are asked to send a contribution to the author (usually between $10 and $20). Compulink is an IBM PC user group which imports just about every decent Public Domain program from the States. If you're a member, you get a full catalogue of available software, and you can order it through the post. They charge  per disk, to cover the cost of the disk plus postage. Included in the public domain library are arcade games, adventures, business programs like word processors and spreadsheets, and some very useful MS-DOS utilities. Write to Compulink at 67 Woodbridge Road, Guildford, Surrey for details, or call them on 0483 65895. If you have a modem (1200/75 baud or 300/ 300), call their bulletin board on 0483 573337. By the way, did you know that the Amstrad PC is known within Amstrad circles as the AIRO? It stands for Amstrad IBM Rip-Off! CASSETTE TO DISK If you have an Amstrad 464, 664 or 6128 machine, there's little point in trying to copy cassette software onto disc when there's a company that will do it for you. Ambyte are a mail order software company that copy games from cassette onto disk for you, so that you receive the game on a 3 inch disk, ready to use. Any inlay card or other bits and pieces that would normally come with the cassette are supplied with the disk and, MORE FROM DKT I mentioned the TV Tuner from DK'Tronics a while back but, having had a chance to see it in action, I'm mentioning it again. It's a .95 device that turns an Amstrad colour CPC monitor into a colour TV. I saw the device in action at the recent Amstrad show and was truly impressed. Although the tuner is quite expensive, it's a lot cheaper than a colour TV and the pictures were generally much better, too. At the moment, the tuner is only available REPAIRS for CPC monitors but a version for the PC-1512 colour monitor may If your micro's been playing up be along soon. Also, DKT are recently, here are two companies working on additions to the tuner that will fix computers. Express that will provide Teletext (Ceefax Repairs are in Manchester.

Ogrot's his wo game ATV tuner MORE AMSTRAD INTERFACES Here's news of another load of goodies for Amstrad owners. I know this page is looking rather like an Amstrad column this month, but most of the recent launches have been for Amstrad hardware. First, there's an auto-fire joystick interface for the 464,664 and 6128 machines. It allows any autofire joystick to be used with the machine. According to the piece of paper I have here, using auto-fire joysticks in the machine without a special interface like this one can damage the computer's sound chip, though I can't understand why this should be. If you do understand, and want to keep your sound chip happy, peace of mind costs .95. And you'll be guaranteed no screams of horror from your sound chip. A Programable joystick controller "

"00000000 There was a birthday party at the recent Personal Computer World Show. The Atari 520ST was one year old. In typical fashion, Atari boss Jack Tramiel took over an entire floor of London's Olympia Exhibition Centre and invited the neighbours in to see his brainchild performing some pretty impressive party tricks. Although it's still widely regarded as a business machine, in Atari circles anyway, the ST is the shape of games machines to come. Many top software companies are now rushing to bring out games for this amazing machine. And despite their protests that \"the ST is really a business machine, guys\" Atari themselves were actively seeking to commission conversions of its arcade games portfolio as long ago as June '85!

James sent me a number of drafts during the project and we met a few times to iron out any differences there may have been between the book and the game. He might have wanted to include something in the book and needed to know if it could be incorporated into the game. Sometimes I would read something in his last draft that didn't match up with the program and couldn't be put in for one reason or another. How much control did Rainbird exercise?

In fact, apart from a terrible version of Donkey Kong called Monkey Business from The Other Valley Software, Space Station may be the first of its kind to be launched in the UK. Although this game breaks no new ground in terms of game design or features, it is fun to play and there is just enough variation in each of the 100 plus locations to keep you coming back for more. You are Callum MacGregor, Chief Inspector of the Federation's Space Stations. You have been sent to investigate strange goings-on on Alpha3. Getting no response and being perilously low on fuel you beam aboard only to find (yesgot it in one!) the station has been completely taken over by aliens.

This is one of five ST games available from Eidersoft all of which feature Midi compatible sound-tracks, although, one has to say, the music in Space Station is decidedly unremarkable! The graphics are pleasing without being anything to write home about but each screen is \"busy enough to maintain interest and you could find this game grabbing you when you're not looking and not letting go until you've mastered it. PSION CHESS LEADERBOARD SPACE STATION 1986 was definitely the year of the golf computer game with Ariolasoft's Golf Construction Set closely followed by US Gold's Leaderboard, launched on the C64 and subsequently converted to the Amstrad and even the Spectrum. Now Leaderboard is available for all Golf freaks who own ap Atari ST. Without the handicap of eight bit technology, Bruce and Roger Curver (Besehead I & II and Raid over Moscow) have come a fair way to producing the definitive golf arcade game for the ST. Unlike Golf Construction Set, Leaderboard is more of an arcade and less of a true golf simulation But what it looses in authenticity it more than makes up for in ease of use, crisp well designed graphics and sheer enjoyment. Up to four players can play a round at one, each selecting from pro, amateur, or novice level.

The animation of the golfer is smooth and lifelike, even if there is a little flickering by his feet. Leaderboard is a very playable golf game which should appeal to anybody remotely interested in the game, whether they have actually been bitten by the bug or prefer the armchair approach listening to Peter Allis' dulcet tones on the box.

"OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS YOUR LOCAL ARCADE IS LIKELY TO SEE THE ARRIVAL OF SOME EXCELLENT NEW DRIVING GAMES. THIS ISSUE CLARE EDGELEY BRINGS YOU A PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. o o  OUT RUN A new breed of racing simulations made their debut at the recent Preview '87 the show where coinop manufacturers show off their best products for 1987 Without a doubt, Konami came out the winner with its superb game, WEC Le Mans 24. And Sega seems to go from strength to strength. The company had two spectacular games of the show-Out Run and Enduro Racer. Out Run is a road race of sorts the type where you have to travel a certain distance and beat the clock before making it to the next stage. If you've seen the film Cannonball Run you'll know what I mean. Instead of Formula One or rally cars' you're in control of big, red, flashy Ferrari complete with a blonde in the passenger seat! Enduro Racer gets you astride a big Enduro bike, doing wheelies, leaping and dodging a haphazard assortment of obstacles. Lastly, Nintendo's machine VS Slalom caught my eye. You could hardly miss it. Stuck to the bottom of the cabinet are a pair of skis, complete with ski poles, which you use to steer your racer as he slaloms down various mountain runs! Other excellent games were Dangar, a deceptively difficult shoot 'em up, Championship Sprint which is the follow on from Super Sprint, Gauntlet II and PlayChoice10 from Nintendo. This last game is interesting it's the first coin-op compilation I've seen. It should be very successful too and needless to say it includes several very popular titles including Super Mario Bros, Hogan's Alley, Tennis and Baseball We've already taken a look at some of the games presented at the show. Rampage, a wonderfully mod game where you play either a monster, wolf, lizard or gorilla. Having chosen your character you then, with two other players, proceed to demolish whole towns and cities by punching the skyscrapers to bits. Brilliant fun. Arkanoid is a pretty basic game which is very addictive. It's based on that golden oldie, Breakout, though this version has several refinements. Bubble Bobble is a fast moving platform game which involves you leaping around killing a myriad of nasties. Sega's Out Run is a different ball game altogether. It's a racing simulation of sorts, but only in the sense that you've got to beat a time limit to move onto each new stage. The race itself is against the rest of the traffic on America's highways -WW Beetles, saloon cars, lorries and the like. But you've got the edge. You're in a bright red and very fast Ferrari It's a bit difficult to handie too, as the slightest twitch of the wheel sends the car sliding all over the place. And as it slides the hydraulics take over. The car tilts and slithers from side to side to simulate your movements. Switch lanes quickly from left to right and the car does likewise. It's great. What's so unusual about this gives the game for more variety It's of this point that the blonde game is the view from the car. You and should keep you playing looks as if she wished she hadn't usually view the screen a fair longer come along for the ride. The distance above the horizon. In this The route consists of huge multigraphics are excellent and the feel case you get a Ferrari driver's lane highways which can range of the car more so. impression of what lies ahead. from three to six lanes in all.

The layout of the course is You end up driving like an idiot The low viewpoint of the road different too. Unlike Le Mans and, more than likely, you'll finish coupled with the swaying motions where you can only travel down of the car make Out Run a very one course. Out Run is constructed It's amusing when that happens, exciting game to play. In my so that you could finish the game as you and your blonde passenger opinion, the movement of Le Mans by travelling several different are thrown out of the car just gave it the edge, but many seem to routes. A really good idea this, as it before it rolls and explodes. prefer Out Run. Give it a whirl! TIME 4 SCORE 1010590 LAP050 om "

The idea is to slalom down each run in as fast a time as possible to qualify and move onto the next stage of the competition. Objects to avoid range from snowmen, each new stage in a set time limit.

These come from Gary Spencer who lives on the Isle of Wight When you first play Gauntlet you begin with 800 health points, these decrease one every second, and between 2-30 everytime you hit something. However, your health points increase every time you eat some food. You can choose to play one of four characters Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard and Elf. Choose the Wizard when you first start playing, but when you reach level 50 change to the Elf as he collects all the magic potions. The first seven sheets are always the same on each new game. From sheet eight onwards, order is random and there are about 40 different screen layouts. To play the game successfully learn the layouts, when to potion, where the potions are, where the food is and the quickest route to the exist on each sheet. If you wait on any sheet, you'll lose about 180 health points but the walls will all turn into exits. Very handy on harder levels. While you're waiting don't move or shoot anything as it then takes longer for the exits to appear. After level seven, magic potions which give you extra magic power appear on every three sheets. Collect this until you have all six. You are then almost invincible. However, after level 50 a thiet appears on every sheet and if he touches you he takes one of your magic potions. If you then shoot him he gives you back a normal potion. Always shoot him before he gets you. 10 YARD FIGHT BUG For those keen on American football and, in particular 10 Yard Fight, Tim McSmythurs from Folkestone in Kent reckons he's found a bug. \"After scoring a touchdown you're given the choice of either kicking the ball or running. If, after the snap, you move the ball carrier diagonally backwards to the left for a couple of paces, then straight left, the opponent's players chase after you. \"Then a blocker suddenly appears on your side and blocks two or three of your opponent's players, leaving you to go forwards for a touchdown.\" Thanks for the tip, Tim, and if anyone else has found a bug, has some useful tips or reached new dizzy heights in the high score stakes, why not write in.

"C+VG They're hot. They're tasty. They're the latest and greatest games on the way to a computer near you. This time we turn the spotlight on Delta, the next stunning game from Thalamus who tell us that programmer Stavros Fasoulas has NEVER been near a Nemisis arcade machine honest guy. We'll leave you to make your own minds up about that as you take sneak peeks at Knucklebusters, Dragons Lair II, Top Gun and more. Enjoy the future Dragon's Lair, Software Projects conversion of the ultra successful arcade game, leapt straight to the top of the software charts. Well SP are hoping to repeat that success with Escape from Singe's Castle. In other words, Dragon's Lair Part Two. If you played the first game and managed to complete it you'll know that Singe, the evil dragon, died at the hands of Dirk the dashing hero. Now Dirk must escape from the castle. He has eight tasks to complete again based on different sections of the arcade game. These include shooting the rapids, riding magic horses, dodging boulders and fighting monsters. The first Dragon's Lair game was incredibly difficult to get into but judging from early versions of the second game it's much more playable. Escape from Singe's Castle will be available on the Commodore 64, Amstrad and Spectrum early in the New Year. Could there by Dragon's Lair Part Three on the way? The original arcade laser-disk game is certainly big enough to supply a few more plots. But perhaps the games-buying public will be a little tired of the format by then. Time will tell. EHLECLEAN 31986 THALAMUS Sanxion's sensational programmer Stavros Fasoulas is hoping for another shoot 'em up smash with Delta, again for new software house, Thalamus. Get an eyeful of an early version of the game. Its got 64 levels with 248 alien attacks. As you pile up the points you can hit various icons to increase your speed and fire power. Delta should be out early in the New Year for .95 on cassette and $14.95 on disk. Death or Glory!? No it's not a war cry. It's the latest 64 offering from the oddballs at CRL. It may look like an Uridium clone but it isn't, Not quite, anyway. You zap about the universe in your tiny spaceship confronting absolutely ginormous alien spacecraftcarriers. The biggest you've ever seen on a 64 we're reliably informed. Instead of shooting everything in sight you have to bounce off things and crash into them. As much as your forcefields will allow anyway. Looks good. Will be available after Christmas. Can't wait.. VVVVV . MAAAAAAA THIRUESI BEREI 077613 II II III IT STEEDS PDP po 41141114 9:08 0359880 91144411 8:1-3 -Worms? promises to be one of the most unusual games to be released over the next few weeks. It has to be played to be fully understood. There are five coloured worms built into the program and the object is for them to capture territories by laying trails from dot to dot, each dot being the centre of a territory. Points go to the worm which lays the last trail in a territory. The types of worm are as follows: New (untrained). Auto (computer trained). Wild (a random mover) and Same (the worm which played a certain colour in a previous game is used again). Confused? So are we. Worms? has great music and will be released by CRL. Who said skateboarding is dead? Certainly not Bubble Bus. They've got a streetwise skateboard game on the way called Skate Rock. It's a true to life simulation of the sport which swept the country a couple of years ago and is making a bit of a comeback right now. The Bubble Bus computer version is immensely playable. You have to guide your skater down a street packed with hazards. There are other skate-boarders, punks, pedestrians, road works and so on. Jump ramps perform wheelies and other stunts and generally have a good time. The skateboarder is amazingly manoeuvrable and a well crucial tune drives the whole thing along nicely. Out soon on the 64. Play the game enter the C+VG competition! "


"RUNNER Top Gun, the number one film this Christmas, stars Tom Cruise, currently the number one screen heart-throb. Ocean has captured the licence for the game and, no doubt are hoping for the number one game. Time will tell but in the meantime here's a glimpse of what it looks like. The game will combine flight simulation with shoot 'em up elements as you learn to cope with flying an F16 Tomcat strike aircraft. It should be zooming your way on the Spectrum at .95 and .95 on the Commodore and Amstrad. We wonder if the F16 is armed with Cruise missiles? It's the 24th Century and society has finally rejected hard drugs. Peace, freedom and equality are a possibility. But as mankind spreads throughout the galaxy it soon becomes clear that these hopes will remain just a dream. Instead the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and angrier. Some governments start to introduce control drugs. It's called Sky and its production is big business. That's the controversial theme of Sky Runners, Cascade's new game from Ace programmer lan Martin. Your mission is to terminate the drug harvesting. Sky Runners will be out on the Spectrum .95 and Commodore .95 cassette/.95 disk. *** 180S SHORT SCORE 00000 3939 SED 00000 SERIES CCGS 000 SU Status DDODD MOMS SES DOC 000 Cartoon heroes He Man, Battle Cat, Teela, Man-at-Arms and Orko continue their eternal struggle against the evil Skeleton in Masters of the Universe from US Gold.

Prices for the arcade version are Spectrum .99, Commodore 64 and Amstrad .99 cassette/.99 disk. The adventure will cost the same as the arcade game on the Commodore and Amstrad, .99 on the BBC, Electron and C16 and .99 on the IBM. SHORT SCORE 00000 CIRCUIT CLOCK ANDROIDS 10 KILL 00 WALL 00SCORE 0000000 SCORE 000 Ocean are hoping you'll blow a fuse over Short Circuit their new release early in the New Year, based upon the science fiction film Short Circuit. At the moment the film is set for release after Christmas and deals with the exploits of Number Five, a military robot who has got his wires crossed and decided to be peaceful rather than follow the more warlike intentions he was made for. In the game, Number Five must escape from the military complex, by solving problems avoiding guards etc. Graphically it looks rather nice as these screen shots show. Short Circuit will be released on the Spectrum (.95) plus the Commodore 64 and Amstrad (.95). Wanna yer mouth packed full of knuckle, mate?
