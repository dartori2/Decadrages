A computer tape that seemed to tell Sam's story up to the end of the Blue Budgie case. Perhaps this held some clues. The first thing I picked up was that Sam seemed to have developed some strange personal habits. Like doing somersaults onto dollar bills that were blowing along the city streets!

To gain extra points, you can try and throw papers into bird baths, knock lids of dustbins, and hit various targets on the bonus course, You start the game with three lives, and lose one of them if you come in contact with any hazard, or crash into a wall. One advantage is that you don't lose any lives if you crash on the BMX course. That basic object of the game, is to complete a full week's work intact-that way you get paid. As I said, I've played the Spectrum version as well, and completed it within a few days, but I've been at the Commodore version for over a week now, and I can't seem to get past Thursday--so any pokes for infinite lives, send to IDEAS Central at the usual address! The graphics are a great improvement on the Speccy version. On that machine, they took up only a small section of the screen, whereas on the 64 version, they fill the whole screen. They are big and bold, although some of the sprites are slightly chunky, and the streets do become repetitive after a while. Sound is well above average, with a fast-boppin' title tune, a slower, more leisurely paced game tune, and another fast jingle during the bonus game. At the end of each day, you are given a report on how well you did, and if you missed delivering any papers to the right addresses, they may stop their subscriptions Overall, a well executed game, and another worthy C+VG hit for Elite.

Order of the Big Elbow within a few minutes of being loaded into the Commodore. First of all no instructions were sent with the game. All could tell was that it was some sort of futuristic sports game. Secondly on the version sent to me the colours of the teams were virtually identical. It was exceedingly difficult to tell who was who. I am, however, given to understand that in versions sent to other reviewers the colours were visible. However, I carried on and in the end found myself playing a highly entertaining and addictive game. It's a sort of aerial Rollerball combined with basketball-only the basket moves.

"FIVE STAR GAMES REVIEWS Madness clones. However, it is an original game in its own right, even though it based on rolling a ball around a map. Spindizzy is a near perfect game! Equinox is the the second Milcro-Gen game on this compilation. The action takes place below the surface of asteroid Sury-Ani 7. A little disposal droid is engaged in a race against time. Equinox has playability in abundance. You'll need to be nimble-fingered to kill an annoyingly high number of assorted aliens, and nimbleminded to solve the increasingly complex problems put in your way. Who Dares Wins It is very much in the Commando/ Rambos style of game where all you have to do is destroy everything that moves and then go off the top of the screen and do the same and do the same again. The enemy comes at you with everything he's got including bazookas, tanks, machine gun posts, and planes that drop bombs and fire machine guns at you as they sweep past.

It start's off looking like Zaxxon, a classic game and a personal favourite of mine, but after six or seven goes, there's nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing original. The game starts off with impressive graphic detail of your launch site, and being the only impressive bit, Durrel used it for the loading screen as well. The game goes considerably down hill from then on. As soon as your fighter launches, you come under attack from other ships, which must be kamikaze pilots as they eventually you'll crack it. Which leads to the third phase. The third phase displays a 3D grid, which has some flashing squares on it. You must, within the time limit, press in the correct pattern of lights. How do I know the correct pattern I hear you cry. Well, the pattern is the same as the fixed dots on phase two, so just punch in that. What do you mean you don't remember. Tough! After this, you restart the game but at a more difficult level. You must complete all three sections seven times in order to win, but I think we'll have to wait a bit for someone to do that. Overall, this game is not original enough to stand in my selection, and the gameplay gets amazingly boring after a while.

"REVIEWS SCORE 0043500 LIVES HI 000000 Installations/hills are drawn in vector style. You can actually drive your Articfox up and over some hills and fog descends when you reach higher ground! It's a good idea to check out the hills as you may find a radar station or rocket emplacement on top of it. Watch out for the enemy jets they bomb you mercilessly. Use the radar map to check out your progress and to get early warning of enemy attacks from the air and on the ground, and watch out for crevasses. These are just about the only thing Articfox can't cope with. If you find yourself under sustained attack you can always \"dig in\". That means hiding in a hole in the snow, stupid! But there's no guarantee the alien attackers will go away.. At the end of each sesion you get a status report on your mission. It tells you what you destroyed, how much ammo you used doing it and a percentage success rating. Initially I found Articfox very slow. But it's one of those games that creeps up and grabs you without you noticing. I found myself sneaking back to the Commodore for just one more crack at those aliens. I found it more playable that Skyfox in fact. Sound is extremeley limited. Just whooshes and explosions. but this doesn't detract from the overall atmosphere. Don't expect fast and furious action.

"ANNALS OF ROME struggles in which great leaders rise to prominence, grow old, and retire or die in battle. New threats appear on the frontier or ambitious legates rise in revolt. Books and epics could be written about this game. Over such a timespan individual effort shrinks to nothing, and it is the city itself which becomes the game's only hero. This is an excellent game for the strategist, and could easily be used to teach the basics of political theory-but it is not fast. The play of even three or four moves takes about two hours, with the computer cycling between provinces to determine the consequences of your decisions. It is realistic in the sense that most rulers spent a lot of time looking at the map and worrying, but it can get very dull. The game has no actual endpoint, the player decides when to stop if the empire has fallen and he sees no future in continuing. The game has also two drawbacks when it comes to actual play. The instruction booklet, while giving a general outline of the game, does not REVIEWS MACHINE: SPECTRUM AMSTRAD, CBM 64, ATARI, IBM  SUPPLIER: PSS PRICE: .95 The ancient world believed that every city had its gods watching over its fortunes, and surely no city ever had better gods than Rome. From 273 BC, when it had no more than shaky control of italy, the Roman republic expanded into a mighty empire, the last vestige of which, the city of Constantinople, finally fell in 1453 AD, 1,726 years later. The best way to describe the single player's role in this exciting and unusual game is that of the city's gods, overseeing its fortunes. The known world of ancient times is shown as a map centred on the Mediterranean and split into 28 separate areas, each with its own population and possibly a ruling power controlling it. Moves are of variable length, depending on how much is happening, but average at about eight a century. The player must control the careers of the senators of Rome, deciding which to assign to which task of protecting and expanding the city's rule.

The game itself is just above average by today's standards. You play the part of Brok a space warrior. Your task is to search earth in the year 2987 to find and destroy Count Dracula. To succeed in this task you have to find three keys to open doors, a list of key objects which enable him to progress through the labyrinth. When you find Count Dracula you must have three special items with you. These are a stake, hammer and a cross. The graphics have been well thought out and take it away REVIEWS to feturn with it to all of Zub n buy this it from the average run of the mill arcade adventures.

A save game option is available after each hole, and after each round you are able to change all the conditions that you want.

In practice you are able to choose any hole and the conditions that you need the practice on. This must be the best game to This come from Atlantis, especially withthe fabulous title screen music. The only thing I dislike is not having a Pitching Wedge in amongst the selection of clubs. I'm off for another round! SURVIVORS MACHINES: SPECTRUM SUPPLIER: ATLANTIS PRICE: .99  REVIEWER: BRIAN GRAPHICS SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY 10 1986 is going to be remembered for two things. Code Masters must be using some sort of games designer program for their Spectrum games. The similarities between Phantomas and Vampire are many. The graphics are similar in style. Clouds in both programs are identical. The gameplay in both is very similar. Even the way the energy levels are represented are the same and the rate of descents are identical. You play the part of Phantomas who comes from a far away galaxy. His only abilities are to rob and plunder wherever he goes. As Phantomas you must find the hidden treasure in the millionaire's mansion. To do this you must travel to the planet Earth-Gemma and search out the mansion using helicopters and planes. When you arrive at the mansion you must always be on the look out for trouble which includes boulders that chase you! To help you in parts of the game there are riddles on the game cover. This is a good game but it is too much like Vampire. Let's hope they can find a new set of graphics to use in the next Spectrum release. of arcade conversions coming out for home computers. Secondly, and the most important, the amount of budget software that is being released. Budget titles account for over half of the sales of software. This is yet another of them but it's one of the worst. Your mission is to rescue almost a thousand survivors from a hibernation dome, damaged in the recent nuclear war. To help you on your way you are provided with three different droids to control. To hinder you on the mission are MK1 Guardian Droids which cause a serious loss of power on contact. If one droid eats the wrong earth, boulders can fall and prevent further progress. Sound is needed in this game even only spot effects. Movement is jerky and the graphics are very simple.

Being able to duck and weave Terra Cresta is one of arcade game in the flesh then They fire all kinds of missiles and fire at the same time is the Imagine's better offerings --it's you won't know that the object at you.

Try to shoot which must be destroyed. MACHINES: SPECTRUM/C/64  SUPPLIER: U.S. GOLD PRICE: .95 (spec) .95 (C64) REVIEWER: TIM attackers in many different shapes and forms. There are also ground emplacements to deal with These fire at you--but you're armed with bombs which you can use to blitz these buildings and the odd alien tank using the roadways which you overfly during your mission. The scrolling is pretty smooth and the graphics are generally black on one colour but pretty detailed for all that You can generally dodge alien fire because their bullets move pretty slowly, but watch out for clusters of bullets these can really catch you out. Also try to shoot the alien craft as far up the screen as you can this gives you more time to bomb the ground installations which send up those bomb clusters. And don't get trapped in the corners of the screen. That's old advice for experienced zappers like you â€” What better way to finish off the year of the arcade conversion than with a real classic like Xevious? Well, U.S. Gold reckons it is anyway. I, for one, can't disagree with them! The original coin-op appeared way back in the mists of time but the game hasn't dated. You won't find any cobwebs on this shoot 'em up. It's been converted by the underated Probe Software team who are also working on other arcade conversions for Activision as reported in our news section last issue. If this is anything to go by, we're in for a few treats in the New Year. Xevious is a pretty basic, horizontally scrolling zapper. You fly your space fighter over a landscape of trees, lakes and built up areas in search of your goal the alien mothership. On the way you'll encounter hoardes of intelligent alien but it's still usefull. And watch out for the awesome flying mirrors! They are real killers. Commodore graphics are a bit confusing to follow at first. The choice of colours isn't that great. But you do get the enhanced sounds of course. There are 32 different kinds of alien ship and no wave is the same, 16 levels, four skill ratings and bonus screens just like the arcade original. There is a two player option plus a nice high score chart. Screen layout differs from machine to machine. The Spectrum has a split screen effect while the 64 is a full screen game. Xevious is a good thumbbusting zapper for shoot'em up fans of all ages. It may not have the colourful graphic frills of something like Lightforce but it's still pretty addictive. Check it out.

These are selected by means of icons. You should really play it in your local software shop if you're interested in buying. Scattered around the system are various rooms to visit.

Also it's my favourite. People seem to think that Judo and Karate are similar they are totally different.

It isn't easy-and that's why the people at IDEAS Central persuaded Peter ever so nicely to bring you this exclusive players guide to the game that turns the Spectrum into a space flight simulator! Read this and you'll be getting pass marks in all the Gal Corp Academy's toughest tests ... LAUNCH Bunch 0. Chefreire et Forward View score osox 00:00:31 Space mines? Use the scanner. follow this advice for the first few attempts. It may not be possible to complete the mission if you choose the wrong skimmer. For example you may need a skimmer equipped with a jump unit in order to reach your objective, and there is nothing more frustrating than battling through hordes of aliens for twenty minutes only to find that a vital piece of equipment is not on some other Qand Launch O.N. 00 00 29 More mean saucers... s a cadet entering the GalA Corp Academy for advanced skimmer pilots, you must complete 20 mission simulations on different inhabited and uninhabited worlds against a variety of foes. Each mission is scored on a percentage basis, a score of 90% or over qualifying as a pass. STARTING UP Anyone who has grappled with Tau Ceti will have an initial advantage here as many of the features have been carried across. At first getting to grips with all the weapon systems and differing keys can take a few plays. A good tip here is to select the key layout that you prefer and then save the game. They key layout is saved with the files so in future sessions -and I can guarantee you won't complete the game in one sitting you can simply load in the file and your keys will all be set As a quick supplement to the manual, your lasers are by far the most useful weapon. Missiles are best used to keep the pressure off when the lasers are overheating and delay bombs and anti-missile missiles are really only for specialist missions. ON THE MISSIONS The mision information section will give a guide to planetary conditions on each mission and explain what your objective is. A suitable skimmer is also given and it is alwasy best to Launch O.N. Having said that, once you realise the equipment needed for a mission it is usually far better to design a 'custom skimmer' for it. The skimmers provided are general-purpose ships and the extra 'edge' given by a purpose built design can make the difference between success and failure. SKIMMER DESIGN Tips on skimmer design are really fairly straightforward. In any mission where the robots are well spread out, a compass and scanner are vital pieces of equipment It's also a good idea to go for the most powerful lasers and shields that you can manage. Watch out for high power steering units, some people find them a shade too sensitive and medium level is a better bet. Don't waste space with flares or infra-red units unless you really need them. You can always wait for sunrise! Designing the panel is a lesson tent bien Holy hot lasers! "

Equally, if the mission involves a chain of jump pads then check each destination for a military or civil supply centre for fuel, the jump pads form a one-way network and it may be a long way to the next garage! A couple of tips that also applied to Ceti are useful here . . Since your skimmer can fire lasers in any direction it's quite possible to run like crazy while firing from the rear at any hunters that may be chasing you. If the mission involves docking with reactors then be VERY careful not to shoot at them. One careless shot and the door system will close for the duration and you will not be able to collect all the codes. Quite often one of two fortresses will be tucked in between a pair of reactors. The best approach here is to circle at a safe distance until you can see daylight between them and have a safe line of fire. THE DIFFERENT MISSION TYPES The missions involve a vareity of a different skills from the mindless violence of If It Moves to the more strategic mission such as Protector. In general the levels are not difficulty levels. I found some of the hardest missions in levels two and three. Later levels involve more specific tasks using particular tactics and strategies. Watch out, especially in later missions, for some of the rarer ships .. Suppressor Droids are particularly useful. Finally, here is a list of the missions found in each of the four levels with a rough guide of the task required... in ergonomics. They most important instruments after the main viewscreen are shield level and laser temperature and it's best to put them nearby so you don't have to hunt all over the screen to find them. Tuck the less useful items like the jump unit indicator away in the corners. Finally, if the planet has a dull red or magenta sun, it's better not to go for a dazzling white or yellow panel as it makes the display that much hard to follow. ON SCORING Each level of four missions only needs an AVERAGE score of 90% to pass. This means that if you have scored 100% in the first three missions you only need 60% on the fourth to pass the whole level. As soon as you reach that point QUIT from the mission. There's no point in going for the full 100% across the board as the scores are not carried through to the next level. Conversely if in one of the early missions you can't get a score of ninety percent plus then leave it till the end, you may not need to! While in a mission keep an eye on the score. Each mission has an individual scoring system and the score tells you if you are on the right track. If chasing and wiping out reams of buildings is not scoring then it's probably a waste of effort. BACK ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE Beacons play a very important part here. If you see a trail of beacons leading off into the sunset, you can bet that there is something interesting at the end of them, so don't just blast them away.

"Digitising images onto your computer used to be difficult and expensive. Our pixelated man in America, Marshal M. Rosenthal, shows you just how easy, and cheap, it really is. Here's Jill waiting to find mission control... I Te've all seen those great looking digitised images on television and in films. Why should we be denied the right to make them ourselves? \"Okay\". you say \"that's all well and good, but who has the money to spend for one of those expensive graphic computers! True, you CAN go out and spend ,000 on a fancy machine, but why bother when you can do it all for a lot, lot less? In the article on Space Camp last issue, Greg, Jill, Liz, David, Todd and Chris talked about their experiences on the various simulators and weightless devices. The pictures used to illustrate the article were created using a digitiser. How? Read on, brothers and sisters... It starts by loading a single lens reflex camera with slide film. Everybody took turns getting in front of a plain paper background, and acting out some of their activities from Space Camp. An electronic flash\"freezes\" all movement Balancing on stools simulates \"floating\" in space, while jumping becomes \"weightlessness. The slides are developed and the technical fun begins. A Digi-View digitiser is attached to the parallel port of an Amiga computer. This device receives a sigmal from a black and white video camera (Panasonic WV140), which gives the high-resolution image necessary. Three filters (red, blue and green) are included and are used to produce the colour image. Since each filter requires its own scanning time of about 10 seconds, you can't easily use a \"live\" model. That's why slides are a good way to work with \"live\" subjects. The computer image appears after each scan, so the camera is first attached to the composite port of the Amiga monitor. The black and white video picture can now be centred and focused. Another way to do this is by attaching the camera to a video-cassette player and watching on regular TV. The camera needs to be on a solid support to avoid vibrations, a tripod was used. The slides were placed in a projector and aimed onto a rear view daylight screen. The picture appears normally on the front of the screen, having been bounced off the back with a mirror. The image will also be brighter than projecting onto a wall. Since the light beam is to the side of the screen, the video camera can be moved back and forth without worrying about casting a shadow. When it looked good, the camera cable was removed, from the monitor and attached to the Digi-View. The lights were killed to prevent glare and the Digi-View software set in motion, Three exposures had to be made, one through each of the coloured filters (which are held in front of the camera and rotated. The scan appears on the screen and takes less than 30 seconds. After all three are done, you have the choice of seeing the digitised picture in 4,096 colours. The image was saved. Now we were ready to load DeluxePaint and put our digitised image onto the electronic canvas. The background was removed so that it didn't get in the way. Magnify and draw an outline around what you want and then blot out everything else with the fill command. Then use the Brush feature which can modify the picture and do all kinds of things to it, like changing the size or rotating it. Now it's time to head for outer space. In this case, it will be artwork drawn by Mitchell Waxman and Delfin Barral. Both are 19, and studying to be cartoon artists. at the School of Visual Arts in New York. Together, they created the backgrounds of sky and space that the Space Camp kids have talked about. Then the digitised picture is dropped into place, like it was part of a paper collage (although no collage allows so much creative control). Mitch and Delfin magnify and work on the digitised picture so that it blends in with their artwork. The result is that Jillis Hey! Here comes the control desk At last, windows. Let's see if these controls work... Yeah! Got something. But it isn't Miami Vice "


"ting pixels Whoops! I must have touched the wrong button! rocketing between the stars in a jetpack while Greg and David try to fix the jammed cargo doors of their Space Shuttle. Shooting slides and combining them with artwork is just one way to do digitisation The video camera could have been used on a copy stand and focused on line art or pictures from magazines. Or aimed out the window, even at the computer itself. 4 black and white image can be digitised, printed out and then coloured Since there's only one scan for black and white (using the red filter), let someone hold still and pose. When making the exposures for the 3-D effect; first expose using the video camera with the RED filter setting on the Digi-View screen -BUT DONT USE ANY FILTER IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA!! Then digitise with the Green setting, and again no filter. The camera is moved laterally just a few inches between exposures you have to experiment), and then the lens should be again aimed at the object(s). The result will be a pleture that's slightly askew, and crazy looking. But put on a pair of red blue glasses and WOW! But what about those without an Amiga. What's wrong with the 8-bit machines? Nothing at all, because you can digitise in black and white here too. In these cases, use Computereyes with your Atari or Commodore 64. The interface simply plugs into the computer (the two joystick ports of the Atari or the user port of the Commodore 64). and comes with the software to do exciting black and white digitisation. The procedure here is even simpler than it was for colour. There's only one scan, and it is short enough to be used with a live model Aim the camera at the subject to be digitised (remember to plug it into the interface). Run the software and adjust the sync knob on the interface until you're told to stop. Then set the brightness by rotating another knob. Now focus the camera (again you'll need to use a monitor or TV to do this). Press the key for a normal capture, and watch the image appear after about six seconds Those really adventurous can go to Graphics nine on the Atari, which creates a picture with 16 levels of grey. It takes almost 90 seconds, but it is possible for a person to hold still long enough. You can use any kind of video source that will stop and display a single frame, like a video cassette player or a laster-dise. When you're satisfied, save the image to disk. It can now be used as a painting file, loaded into most nainting programs and played around with and coloured. There are even special programs to include the image with the Print Shop, Koala Pad, Doodle and Flexidraw formats (Commodore 64 only, the Atari digitised image works with Atari Artist and other compatible formats). There are additional tricks that can help in working with a digitised image in Deluxe Paint. One is being careful with colour selection. For Space Camp, the people were loaded first as Brushes, and then the art was drawn using their palette. You can also use the Remap feature to match up any picture with a previous one, but this is sometimes disastrous especially as flesh tones create a lot of orange and red tones. Of course, you can alter colours that aren't important (usually black and white). Taste will tell. Another discovery is that you can lift\" an image out from its background, tu it into a movable output, sort of like a colourform. Here's how: Let's say we have a digitised picture of a tripod. Draw around it with the background colour, using the Zoom feature. This is the same colour that is used when you press the right mouse button (black works well). When done, you now have just the image you want outlined. Select the Brush feature, and make a rectangle around the image. and around the unwanted background.

To cast this one you must not carry the four leaf clover. To light the candle the four leaf clover must be in the SAME room as Magic Knight. Margaret Sullivan wrote in with this piece of information but told me she always thought that if the candle was burning she could read the Ancient Scroll. But, her candle is lit and she still cannot read it. Does anyone know how to read the scroll? The last plea for help comes from Mark McGuiness of Dublin. His problem is with Dragons Lair. He cannot get past the second and third levels. Level 2 27 DANDY MAP BY DANNY BLAKMAN AND NIGEL DAVIES. B ar xxx ER WILL "

Still with the Atari for all you budding Pole Position experts out there, Martin Dewhurst of Greater Manchester has a tip for you. The first thing to do is select track one and then an eight lap race. Simply position your car in the middle of the track to qualify and do the same to race.

"PES, HIT IT ITS # WRITE... where there used to be halfogres. Many of the players and nearly all the monsters fight in costume. Out of doors the gear can look faintly silly, with swords made of foam rubber and insulating tape, and chainmail made of string and silver paint. But underground, in dim light from \"candles\" pencil torches the atmosphere is compelling Having successfully assaulted the entrance to the brewery, and skewered a couple of half-ogres who were hiding in a half-ogrish toilet, we take stock of our wounds. One or two of the party have been a few blows. so I go into my Florence Nightingale act. \"Spirits aid me, I abjure thee, staunch this wound\"I cry, laying my hands on the bodies of the afflicted. You have to get the words right when you're using magic, or nothing happens. This can be embarassing if you're trying to send a vampire back to Hell or resurrect a dead comrade. The bad guys usually don't give you a second chance Most spells are fairly short, but when you get up to a high level of power there are so many floating around in your skull it takes a very clear head to remember the right words at the right time. There's no chance to stop and look it up in the rule book in Labyrinthe. I said things were going fine in the brewery. That's not quite the truth. One of the half-ogres appears to have had a little magic himself, and cursed me with his dying breath before I put him to sleep with my mace. The net result, according to the referee, is that Q'Adille has become an alcoholic. And an alcoholic in a brewery is NOT a pretty sight Role-playing is all about living your character to the hilt. In sickness and in health, for better or worse, and damned be he who first shouts that's not in the rulebook!\" Consequently I dive into the nearest vat of half-ogre beer and start singing some old Oreish drinking-songs I picked up in my mis-spent youth I'm well into the third verse of Old Cuchullian Had An Elf when Cliffhanger pulls me out of the drink. I expect he'd heard the song before and didn't want to hear what Cuchullian does with the elf in the fourth verse. And I'm not about to reveal it in a family magazine. Deprived of my beer. I fly into a violent frenzy, which the rest of the party direct against the foe by the simple expedient of pushing me into the next room. Here my armour is less effective. There's one particulary big guy with two swords, one in each hand, who inflicts double damage. Twenty-seconds of bruising combat later and I'm lying against the cave wall with only one point of life force left. A close shave for a humble warrior priest More curative spells and a swig from an extremely expensive bottle of healing potion, which I had the forethought to bring with me, get me back on my feet again. ready for the final charge to death or glory Fortunately, the shock of being so comprehensively hammered by the ogre with the two swords has sobered me up temporarily, and I can fight with a little more respect for the opposition At this point, unknown to us. referee Joe is having a word with the monster who did us so much damage and telling him his weapons are downgraded to normal damage. This may sound like cheating but it's a sign of good refereeing Joe is impressed by the way we've been adventuring and realises the monsters may be a little tough if any of us are going to survive. Berk is still on his feet, but another fighter is dead, and the priests have used up nearly all their cures. As for the pathfinders come to think of it, where ARE the pathfinders? We don't know about this sudden change in the opposition. But so what, you only live once unless you can find a highlevel priest to bring you back to life again and isn't a noble death better than a coward's retreat? I don't know. Roleplaying addicts like me are a bit loopy, I guess. Anyway, in we charge. Amazingly, when the carnage is over, we're still on our feet. Zirax the pathfinder has found a glowing object which has paralysed him, but the effects wear off soon enough. Lucky he didn't touch it before the fight was over Greed is the most common cause of death in Labyrinthe. After the adventure is over, Joe debriefs us back in the main chamber. Although the pay isn't much good 200 grulls each, barely enough for a single cure potion â€” the survivors are ogre's dying curse, tell 'em to awarded an extra level meet me some weekend soon This means I get new spells to in the Labyrinthe. learn and use, and the others have more skills and points of ABOUT LABYRINTHE life-force as well.
