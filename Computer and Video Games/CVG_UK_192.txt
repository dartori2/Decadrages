Sorry, people. lan Fishwick Fishsta@compuserve.com OUT OF THE KNIFE DRAWER INTO THE PEDDLE BIN CVG: ... YOUR OPINION AND SOME OF OURS IT'S..THAT.*$%@! ARGUMENT AGAIN! ERMSHA'AP! Dear CVG, When you reviewed Tekken 2/Soul Blade, I think you were comparing them to the Virtua Fighter series on the Saturn. If you were this is totally unfair since the PlayStation does not have any kind of VF game available for it. You should have awarded them both High Fives due to this fact. In future you should compare it to the same genre on the same system not on rival machines. Perhaps a box of some kind saying so in your reviews would give the impression of a more neutral viewpoint. (Also] why don't you have a readers Top 10 of games per system in the run up to Christmas? Also the top game for a genre le RPG, Beat 'em ups, etc. Christopher Evans, Bilston Dear CVG. About Tom Bryden's letter in #189. I like the Tekken games, but they are in no way as good as the Virtua Fighter games. You're arguing with people who review games for a living, if you think you could do better write your own mag. From Peter Jopson, Accrington Why do you go on about piracy being a bad thing and that you're completely against it, but when I flick through your magazine, there are advertisements for 'backup devices', 'N64 Doctors' and such like? If ! ever were to want a backup unit, the first place I'd look is your magazine. \"gusto\" <hoang@dircon.co.uk> CVG: Yeah, Bryden. CVG: The guy who booked those ads doesn't work here any more. SHA' API SHA' AP! SHA' AP! LETTERS CVG: You're sharp Evans. Perhaps too sharp for your own good. We rated Tekken 2 and Soul Blade individually as games. The Tekken versus VF argument is too downright subjective for us to get involved anymore. Reader charts you can find in FreePlay every month. The other ideas you mentioned we're looking into. CVG over-hype games. Not so much that you over-hype them, but are always making silly (or ignorant) mistakes which is simply due to too much opinion and not enough facts. When CVG had a feature on what the best games machine will be, you said the PC because of 3Dfx and other various reasons, which is all very well. But last issue at the SONY section of the E3 report you clearly stated that the PlayStation was THE format. Although, how could the PS be THE format when it hasn't got (and I quote from a CVG review of Mario 64) 'The Greatest Videogame Ever'? One semi-revolutionary game like Final Fantasy VII and CVG go bonkers over the format despite the EXTREME AMOUNT OF LACKLUSTRE GAMES AT E3. Don't trash this letter, I want to hear what CVG have to say about it. The Mana Hero, Potos Village, The Republic. CENSORSHIP SORE Dear CVG I've just read an interview about the Nintendo 64 version of Duke Nukem 64 and I'm not happy. It seems we are back to the bad old days of Nintendo Mortal Kombat censorship, as DN64 has undergone the same fate. I thought the ratings system implemented a few CVG: We say, 'Sha' ap Mana Hero, you get on our nerves too much!'. PlayStation is the biggest-selling format around. In spite of everything. We still love Saturn, PC, and N64. What do you take us for?! It's nice that you recognise FFVII as semirevolutionary. 12 "


"STOPPIT PLAYSTATION computer video games RANDOM MAIL BAG DROPPINGS Dear CVG, I am a massive Nintendo fan and I own a N64. But am very worried about the PlayStation. As I flicked through your E3 report (issue 190) I noticed that all the big games are going to the PSX, the majority of companies are announcing there games for the PSX and not for N64. For example Final Fantasy VII looks like it will obliterate Zelda 64, also there is Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider 2, Street Fighter EX, Resident Evil 2, Tekken 3. None of these are coming to the N64. I thought that when the N64 came out it would eclipse everything else. The N64 has been out for about six months now and there is only about 10 games available. Okay there are a lot of good games out, but not enough! This Christmas we will be overrun by PlayStation games. Also Nintendo need to improve the appearance of their games people see amazing FMV intros on PlayStation games and think \"Wow!\" Then they see the Mario 64 intro (which is crap compared to the Tekken 2 one) and they aren't impressed. The PlayStation is about to hit warp speed and the N64 is in serious danger of being left behind.

STAZKING SAFADS QUAKEWORLDI PARTY TIMEI EXCELLENTI HTTP://WWW.ON-LINE.CO.UK We've already covered On-Line's Iron Wolves in CVG World, but now their avatar-based chat area Talking Heads is getting under way. An avatar is basically a symbol representing you while you chat, but Talking Heads lets you create pretty much whatever you want. In Talking Heads you can choose your avatar's hair, eyes, nose, mouth and body to make them look just like you, if you so desire. There are three different areas in which to chat the Pub, Beach and Club with enough versions of each to fit everyone who wants to join in the conversation. As you chat, your text appears in a speech bubble and your avatar reacts to the way it's written. For example, an exclamation mark at the end gives them an excited look. It adds a lot to the feel when you have some idea of another person's personality through their avatar. You can find out more about Talking Heads from On-Line's page (www.on-line.co.uk) and have a go for yourself. At the moment it's still testing and doesn't require membership, though you're likely to get hooked. See you there! HTTP://WWW.QUAKESPY.COM As you know, Quake World is the way forward for online gaming, which is our excuse for playing it so much. It's developing all the time, and the latest version is the best yet. The new code means that you don't need to have a big chunk of the screen covered with your status bar. Instead, everything is displayed with small HUD symbols up the side. Much better. Also, people are getting understandably bored of the original levels and are constantly creating new add-ons. There are lots of Capture The Flag servers running now, many with all-new weapons and power-ups. There are even themed games, including one with a series of Star Wars levels (Hoth, Bespin, Tattoine) with movie, sounds (Ben telling you to «Use the Force...\") and new graphics. It makes the standard Capture The Flag more fun when it's the Empire attacking the Rebel base from their AT-AT!

One month ago it was a rumour, but everything in the world of the Spice Girls happens at the speed of a blazing comet. They ARE already on PlayStation. Witness... 16 "


"computer video games They are the pop phenomenon of the Nineties, perhaps of the Modern Age. Hell, they go beyond mere pop the Spice Girls are the ultimate brand! Everywhere you look, they tempt you and every marketing team wants a slice of that seductive Spice pie. Walker's Crisps, Pepsi Cola, even Asda have profited from the Midas-like endorsement of the Spice Girls. But now, a mass-market sensation to match their own stature has come seeking them the Sony PlayStation. A unique and powerful partnership has been formed. The Spice Girls give Sony its most irresistible PlayStation product yet. And through PlayStation, the Spice Girls reach their millions of fans in a way never seen before and looking unlike they ever have either! THE BRTH OF 32 BIT GRL POWERP SPICE LAB Perhaps you're trying to visualise what a Spice Girls game would look like or how it would play. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe however, had a clear vision of what it should be from the start. And their concept it seems, was enough to convince the Spice Girls' managers 19 Management that Sony were the only people for the job. In their own words, it's not a game not in the conventional sense. There's no challenge against the computer or other players no point-scoring and no ending. The plan was to create a new kind of experience for people who wouldn't normally play games. To appeal to Spice Girl fans of all ages and to give them something they couldn't get by more conventional means like video. It's about taking part in Spice Girl activities such as singing, dancing, even news conferences! The resulting genre, like the game, hasn't got a name yet, but Sony are calling it an interactive magazine! When the Spice Girls game franchise surfaced in early summer, Sony Europe pulled together a special development team for it. Ten people with a collective CV that includes Total NBA '97, Porsche Challenge, Rapid Racer and Medievil, plus experts in TV, pop music and dance. They've been working on the game since June and currently no release date has been set. Sony have suggested it won't be out until early next year, but we reckon they might try for a Christmas release. Spice World INTRO PRESS MIX FANZINE SPICE GIRLS ON PLAYSTATION! HOSE US DOWN!

"computer video games SWEET SECRETS THE EDITING ROOM At this early stage in its development, Sony are being tight-lipped about the actual nature of the Spice Girls 'game'. However, here's what we do know is in store for Spice fans, as hinted at by Sony's special projects leader, Richard Milner. BRAND NEW SPICE GIRLS FOOTAGE! It will contain a large amount of exclusive interview footage of the girls, much of it being shot specially for the disc. It's promised that the majority of this video material will be new even to the most dedicated Spice Girl fans. INTERACTIVE MUSIC You'll be able to mix your own versions of the Spice Girls' hit singles to what degree though, we don't know.

"BABY POWER! GIRL POWER OVERLOADI computer Video games You've already seen our cover, so you know about the incredible look of the PlayStation Spice Girls. Jason Millson, the project's lead artist, says the inspiration for the super-stylised caricatures came from The Beatle's 'Yellow Submarine'. \"I thought it was appropriate if we treated this product as the girls' own version of the Yellow Submarine, but to use a more contemporary graphical style.\" The final look is something he describes as a blend of \"Manga and the Designer's Republic club styles\". Incidently, the PlayStation versions of the girls were never made to be realistic (rumour said they tried, but couldn't do it), the caricatures were always intended as a way to enhance the girls' characters. \"By doing this you can be very satirical, which is not what I wanted.\" Jason explains,\" or flattering, which I hope is what I have captured.\" 2492 TAJNI BUILDING THE ULTIMATE BABES In creating these 'virtual' Spice Girl's, the development team have used around 300-350 polygons per girl. They are all real-time lit, gourard shaded (for those silky smooth legs) and textured each wearing only one costume. but this represents the epitome of what each girl does currently wear.\" says Jason. He also confessed that some of the code for the spotlighting was actually taken from Porsche Challenge. Strange to think that the Spice Girls would use a similar graphics engine to a car game! When asked whether the Spice Girls project does anything new with the PlayStation hardware he refused to comment. \"I can't say, because it's a secret.\" BRINGING THEM TO LIFE! In animating these digital Spice Girls, the team considered motioncapture but decided the cartoon girls would look absurd with realistic movement. \"I believe you can create more personality from exaggerated hand-animated characters.\" says Jason. Likewise their facial expressions emphasise their caricatures, or as Jason describes it they are \"appropriate for their own personalities.\" There are around ten expressions for each girl and, fitting the stylised nature of the game, they animate by rapidly snapping between each one, particularly in the dance studio section. Talking about the Spice Girls' success may seem like an exercise in the obvious, but the speed of their rise to stardom is what makes it truly staggering. It all started with an advert in The Stage magazine, dated to February 24th 1994, asking \"Wannabe starlets\" to audition for an all-female pop act. The five girls Melanie Chisholm (Sporty), Geri Halliwell (Ginger), Emma Bunton (Baby), Victoria Addams (Posh) and Melanie Brown (Scary) beat 400 hopefuls. The girls then went through a nine-month stint of living together in a rundown two-bedroom house. During this time they dumped their original management, struck the career-turning deal with Simon Fuller of 19 Management and got signed by Virgin Records. Their big break came when they were spotted on telly (unveiling a statue of Red Rum and flashing their knickers) by Vincent Monsey of The Box the cable pop channel where viewers can ring and vote for a video to be played. He scooped MTV to show the Wannabe video (directed by the Diesel Jeans ad people). It was played over 70 times in the six weeks run-up to the single release! Wannabe entered the charts at No.3, in July of last year, and hit pole position a week later. It went on to be Virgin's best-selling single for 13 years, topping one million sales in the UK! It also earned the girls a place in the Guiness Book Of Records, for the first girl band to debut at No.1. Their second single, Say You'll Be There, sold 350,000 copies in its first week and went straight to No.1. The third single, 2 become 1, clocked advanced sales of 750,000! Incidently, if you're hoping to see the Spice Girls when they tour next year, you'd better be a veteran fan of theirs. They're giving first choice of tickets to people on their mailing list (those that returned their Spice Girls info tab from the inlay of Spice), or those with subscriptions to the official Spice Girls mag. Only if there are any tickets remaining after that, will they go on sale! SPICE GIRLS ON PLAYSTATION! HOSE US DOWN! SPICE WORLD DOMINATION! Sony are confident that the Spice Girls game will push the PlayStation into new territory (if there's any left for it!). \"We think this product will appeal younger sisters, girlfriends, mothers, people interested in music, dance and pop celebrities,\" says Richard Milner. \"The success of Parappa The Rapper in Japan showed that a new content style could bring new users to (PlayStation) in large numbers. We think PaRappa will cross over to Europe well. We hope our offering will reinforce PaRappa's success and cross over to the Japanese market, where the Spice Girls are popular and where they're touring next year.\" We're convinced and intend following the PlayStation Spice Girls project every step of the way! 19 "

Lara's back and you'd better believe it! It's been a year since her last outing, though she hasn't had much time to rest since we saw her last. Going on tour with U2, appearing on the cover of style bible The Face, recording her single and negotiating the movie rights to her adventures. Upon first sight of the new Lara it appears she's been spending a bit of time looking after herself.

The first level is an assault on all the skills you developed to conquer the original. You'd expect a nice leisurely level to get you back into the swing of things. No way! What you get is a level packed with more boobytraps than anything seen in the first game. It's clear from the offset that things are much tougher, levels are a lot harder, and there are more traps to test your reflexes than you could imagine.

Walls are now conquered by locating ladders or grating. Traversing these allows Lara to access window sills and ledges, which then offer further opportunities for exploration. Crawling is just as essential, though visually less impressive. Lara can now make her way into some very small places. Not for the claustrophobic. Even more panic-inducing is when she has to use this skill underwater! Get to Venice and prepare to be chased by packs of Dobermans. Lara's new flare trick. You don't see her and now you do. SHE DON'T NEED NO INTRODUCTION! The awesome new climbing technique. Lara even uses it on this lift cage door. Head out to sea and face the dangers of sharks and moray eels. ARE YOU A TOURIST? If you were annoyed by the Terminator-like qualities of Pierre Dupont in the first game, you may be concerned about the amount of human opponents in the world of the sequel. Fear not, for this bunch of misfits aren't as tough as Pierre, but they still put up a mean fight. Every human has a weapon of some description, ranging from big sticks, to bigger sticks plus every type of gun under the sun. The human baddies often attack in pairs or with animals, otherwise they'd be easier to defeat. Most can be dispatched easily because they attack in set patterns. Plus that old getting-to-higherground technique still does the business. Dramatic lighting offers Lara clues as to where she needs to get to next. This'll need a big jump! CHALLENGE GAME The big guys attack with sticks and take quite a few bullets. Bad guys even show-up underwater. "


"computer video games VRTUAL SIGHTSEEING If Tomb Raider 2 were real, Lara would have a travel bill that would endanger Richard Branson's bank account. The new adventure takes place in more exotic locales than before. China, Tibet, Venice and The Atlantic Ocean are just some of the lovely places Lara has decided to go visit for her holidays. Oh, but Lara's able to claim some of it back as a business expense! Levels are even bigger than the original game, if you can believe that.

ROM AMV/CVG TOMB RAIDER 2 CHALLENGE video The 3 DOHMV computer CHALLENGE games SHE DON'T NEED NO INTRODUCTION! There aren't a lot of challenges we can set around Tomb Raider 2, that wouldn't involve spending half a days play. So we've devised the simplest challenge yet. Though only simple in its design, not in the skill needed to perform! The challenge is on the first level of the game: The Great Wall. Lara simply has to scale the mountain and get to the wall fortress at the top. Arriving via a landslide Lara spies the wall fortress at the top of the mountain. One question: How does she get there? It's going to take some super jumping skills to negotiate the sloping mountain. Aim for a time of around two minutes, the clock stops as soon as Lara plants both feet down inside the fortress. Good luck. Remember, you can practice the game in all participating HMV Stores. Lara arrives and spies the wall fortress, now to get there. This pool could contain the secret to get you on the way.

PREDECESSOR VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD TM OUT MARCH '98 1 PLAYER PlayStation  RELEASED BY VIRGIN TEL 0171 368 2255 PlayStation This time it's gone further than the mansion. Now there are zombies running wild across the whole of Raccoon City! You're our last hope! RESIDENT EVIL 2 THE ONE WEVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR — RESIDENT EVIL 2! apcom certainly aren't rushing Resident Evil 2. We saw the first pictures of the game months ago, not too long after the UK release of the first game. Just as it got nearer to the provisional release date, they scrapped everything they'd done and started again from scratch, pushing the release back to Spring '98 in Japan! To prove to everyone that it's coming on nicely, a demo is being included in the special edition release of the first game Resident Evil: Director's Cut. Here's what you can expect from part two of Capcom's Survival Horror classic! One dead cop, one undead Outside and the park is full of cop. Not a nice situation to be in. zombies strolling in the moonlight! MY FRSTDAY AT WORK AND I'VE GOT TO SAVE THE WHOLE CITY. I QUIT. You play as Leon Walker, a rookie cop on his first day at work, or Claire Redfield. Thing is, the police station and the rest of Raccoon City has been taken over by zombies! Everywhere you go, zombies follow you trying to get their teeth in your neck! At one point, Leon finds a gun shop but is held at gunpoint by a nervous shopkeeper. Once the shopkeeper is convinced that you're not a zombie he lets you look around his shop. But while you're off behind the counter, the front window smashes and zombies pour in! They get the shopkeeper on the floor and rip him to shreds! Quick, grab his shotgun and blast your way out! THEY'RE COMING OUTTA THE WALLS! RPD REALISTIC ROTTING FLESH! THE DIRECTOR'S CUT COMING SOON THE ONE The graphics of Resident Evil 2 are similar to the original game, only greatly improved. The detail on the characters is incredible, especially when standing near to one of the \"cameras\". Everyone also moves much more realistically than in the first Resident Evil. When Leon is running around town he keeps eye contact with any nearby zombies just in case they make a move on him even when they're lying on the floor bleeding! The zombies also stagger far more convincingly and stumble right over when hit with a good shot from a powerful gun! The camera angles are also brilliantly worked out to make the atmosphere as tense as possible. Wait until you see the mysterious shape pass the window at the end of the corridor! Wooooooooooh! The first chance you'll get to play Resident Evil 2 is the demo disc included with Resident Evil: Director's Cut. The RE: DC disc contains two versions of the game the original version, and a new extended version. Chris and Jill have new costumes, the item locations have changed, and other bits and pieces are different. Near the start of the game you come across Forrest on the balcony (\"He's been pecked to death by crows!\"). This time, he's not 100% dead! Instead, you need to take down the zombie Forrest! We expect that the RE2 demo will be the biggest selling point of Resident Evil: Director's Cut, but to fans the extended game will be a big bonus. WAITI I'M A HUMAN! There are fairly obvious signs of a struggle in the city police station. The ugly staggering zombies, for one. This demo of Resident Evil 2 (about half an hour's play) is to be included with Resident Evil: Director's Cut which comes out in December. We'll have a finished version for review next month. 24 "

"computer video games 30% 3D ACTION BY SONIC TEAM  NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD COMPLETE SATURN NOV RELEASE (JAPAN 1 PLAYER  RELEASED BY SEGA JAPAN TEL N/A SATURN Genius makes a hallowed return to the Saturn, as Sonic Team reveal their red hot successor to NiGHTS. RIBNING e've played Sonic Team's latest Saturn game, and it's awesome! Burning Rangers is completely different to NIGHTS in almost every respect. All the cute characters are gone. Instead we get serious and realistic (for Sonic Team) situations. The only similarity is that the 3D graphics engine used in NIGHTS is back. modified to suit the new tasks ahead. Our initial experience was of an environment that is very stylish. It's also 100% volatile likely to implode, explode, or simply collapse without warning. UK players have lots of time to prepare for Burning Rangers, however. It's not due out here until Spring '98. But we couldn't resist the opportunity to expose what should be Saturn's blaze of glory. LATEST FLAME FROM SONIC TEAM! CHILLIN TO BE THRILLIN Jet boots propel the Burning Rangers over molten floors. Check the lighting! The heat is intense. Enough to make you lean away from the TV screen! FLOORS TO SWALLOW YOU UP The theme of Burning Rangers is fire fighting, similar to PlayStation's Rosco McQueen. To further fuel this exciting premise, the setting is the future. Instead of old mills and school dustbins, our heroes Sho and Tilis rush to save collapsing space precincts! Sho and Tilis Amabane are members of a crack team of fire fighters recruited from around the world the Burning Rangers. Tough, hightech armour shields them from the heat, and is equipped with rockets and stabilisers. So the Rangers can fly across short distances, while extinguishing fires with their Co2 cannons. There are five types of upgrade planned for the Rangers' cannons. Expect these to be spectacular, since the basic example used in this early demo is impressive. SPEED is a trademark of any Sonic Team game, and Burning Rangers requires accelerated thinking to survive. Split-second decisions and lightning reflexes are skills the Burning Rangers depend on. As the Rangers work to rescue innocent people trapped by the blaze, the environment is constantly subject to change. Exploding walls, collapsing floors, and falling bridges create living scenarios which must be navigated on the fly. Not only does the environment change constantly, but the some elements are random to each different game. Fire-trapped victims are found in different locations each time you play, requiring fresh tactics to ensure their survival. It's likely that Sonic Team will hide power-ups in much the same way. We expect to find that Burning Rangers will remain a constant challenge, in the same way as the classic Sonic and NIGHTS games. COMING SOON Yikes! The floor's giving way! The floor's giving way! Run! Faster! Don't want to be hangin' around for when this ball of flame gets here! 26 Krakatoa! Only Burning Rangers could survive a blast like this! And only on the Saturn, friends! "

Now MiB is protecting your PC from the scum of the universe. IVEN IN BLACK MEN IN BLACK n terms of movie licenses, Gremlin have not only got Judge Dredd under their belts but they recently unveiled the rights to this year's box office smash Men in Black! That's a pretty big belt by anyone's standards! It would have been quite easy for Gremlin to take one look at the film, seen lots of guns and aliens, and made a sideways scrolling fighting game. But give them credit for trying something different, as they put MiB into a Resident Evil style environment, where the camera switches at various points during the game to reveal better views and new backgrounds. It also appears that Gremlin have opted to leave out the 'humour' aspect of MiB, as funny games don't generally work (Blazing Dragons anyone?). This can only be a good thing. From the fire exit, jump into the trash bins to cushion your fall. DOWN WITH THE M:B: GALAXY DEFENDERS! AND FINALLY... T HI, JAY. K. ! Just a bit of useless information for you all, is that the movie Men in Black 2 is confirmed. And already rumours are beginning to sprout, one of those is that David Duchovney from X-Files fame will be starring in the sequel alongside Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. That's all really The game begins with you assuming the control of Jay Edwards (Will Smith). At this stage in the game Edwards is nothing more than a New York cop. During a routine call out he sees a strange looking creature and goes in search of it. More and more alien-infest ed humans try to stop Jay realising what he has seen, before the MiB get hold of him. As a fully fledged member, he becomes a real alien buster. As you progress further into the game you have to ability to switch to between Agents J, K (Tommy Lee Jones) and even L, who is played by Linda Fiorentino. The best thing about this, is that the cast gave permission for their faces to be used in the game, so you really will be controlling the MiB! I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA BREAK THIS DAMN THINA! COMING SOON Guns, guns and more guns! That's the M'B thinking behind MiB. Be it the small but deadly 'noisy cricket' or the immense \"reverberating atomiser' all the weaponry will be featured heavily in the game. Of course, you cannot start the game with these space age shooters, as Edwards has yet to discover the alien plot, so all he has is a 9mm handgun. All the more reason to discover what the hell's going on! SUITS AND SHADES AT THE READY? Even though this version of MiB was about half complete, the indications point towards another run-of-the-mill, movie tie-in. However, we'll be reporting on the finished version in a couple of months, so judgment will be reserved until then. 0 The backgrounds are superbly detailed. The lighting helps convey the eerie feel MiB has. "

You can play as a giant hog! -BEAST very possible style of fighting game has been done already, right? Not yet. A fast street brawling game where the fighters have the ability to transform into powerful animals has just been done by Hudsonsoft! Known in Japan as Bloody Roar, Beast takes the best elements of other fighting games and adds many original features. Can the company best known for their cute 2D games be taken seriously with their aggressive 3D fighter? @ DONT MAKE ME ANGRY! As well as being able to turn into giant animals, each fighter can go into a special Rave mode. This is similar to the Custom Combo part of Street Fighter Alpha 2, as it's possible to do moves far more quickly than usual. Unless you spend time working out decent combos, the best way to do lots of damage is to hammer the buttons as fast as you can! Get someone up against the wall and they're in real trouble! BLASZ 515 42 BEASILY TRANSFORMATIONS! ZHT HUDSONSOFT'S FIRST 3D FIGHTING GAME! The name of the game is Beast for a good reason each fighter can transform into one! The power bar, underneath the energy display along the top of the screen, powers up as the fight goes on, eventually displaying the word \"Beast!\". Pressing the Circle button when this bar is flashing, transforms the fighter into an enormous animal based on their fighting style and personality! They can use most of their original moves, as well as a few new ones. The flashing special effects look excellent. Big floating combos are possible in Beast. When a fighter wins, the screen flashes white. POWER X-TREME! BALE BALE CHAMPION 2 WINS 55.

Beast is similar in many ways to Fighting Vipers, Sega's high-speed street fighting arcade game. For one, each ring is surrounded by walls. Enemies can be thrown against the walls to cause extra damage, and it's also possible to jump off the walls yourself. Unlike Fighting Vipers, hard hits can knock a wall down allowing a \"Ring Out\" victory! Whenever a fighter is knocked into the air, they can recover by pressing both attack buttons at once. With a flash they flip upright, letting them land on their feet with little or no damage! These aspects borrowed from Vipers and other fighting games keep the speed of the fights at maximum all the time! Beast came as quite a surprise. We weren't expecting much from it, but it already looks very promising, with great graphics and lots of fast fighting. Hopefully it'll stand up to months of play when we come to review it in a later issue.  "

But are there enough changes? SEGA WORLDWIDES o matter where you go in the world, only one language is spoken in every country. The language of football. Even if you have no idea what the other person is saying, one mention in your trying-hardest-not-to-soundEnglish accent of 'Err Fff-fooughttbulll'is enough to make anybody understand. This will bring common reactions, like 'Bobby Charlton' or 'Gazza.' It's this worldwide (excuse the pun) popularity that makes footie games such big sellers, and in WWS '98, Sega have potential for another stormer. AIUB  21st 2013 Boz joe RETURN OF THE MAC-MANAMAN WORLDWIDE SOCCER WITH FULL BRITISH TEAMS!

Having scored a very big hit with Extreme Assault, it's vital for them that the follow-up title is just as good. Thankfully, Incubation doesn't look like letting them down. With a human disease turning all of the natural inhabitants of the planet Scayra into death-obsessed monsters, the aim for you is to bring the planet back down to sanity. As well as featuring the usual awesome 3Dfx graphics, Incubation also takes a step back in terms of playability to turn based games. You are given a squad of troops to control and each gets to move once and shoot before their go is over. The computer then moves the aliens it controls, before you have another bash. Simple in theory, but immensely playable if done right. ON THE LINE OF FIRE One good thing about the soldiers you command, is the different tasks you can set them to do other than just shooting aliens. They can be injected with a speed increasing drug, drop mines, and heal themselves or others. Or you can put them on guard, so that as soon as anybody walks into their firing range, they'll unload on them! But should the enemy move behind a friendly troop, the guard will shoot through both of them to comply with his orders. THE NEXT BIG GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF EXTREME ASSAUL PROBING CAMERA LENS Due to the 3D engine (Incubation uses the same as Extreme Assault) it means that the camera can be moved to virtually any position you like to incorporate all of the on-screen action. You can also skip to various fixed camera views and gain information on characters currently in the battle arena, using the magnifying glass icon at the side of the screen. If you constantly fire your weapons, they overheat and jam. Firing them from this distance is OK, as the enemy don't have enough moves to get near you. Hello gorgeous! If an enemy is this close to you, the chances are that you're about to bite the dust! Let him have it quickly, or you'll be turned into chunks of meat! BLOOD HOUNDS And of course, there are loads of opportunities to reduce the enemy to chunks of flesh!

"computer video games 75% D CLATFORM GAME CU NAUGHTY DOGS PLATFORM GAME BY NAUGHTY DOG  PLAYSTATION PREDECESSOR AVAILABLE NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED COMPLETE TM NOV RELEASE 1 PLAYERS PlayStation  STORAGE 1CD  RELEASED BY SONY TEL 0171 447 1600 PlayStation Sony's answer to Sonic and Mario returns in what could turn out to be the most important game for Sony this Christmas. Can Naughty Dog come up with the goods? Hitting the '!' box will fills these see-thru crates ready for smashing. espite mixed reviews, the original Crash still sold really well as PlayStation owners grabbed at the chance to have a proper mascot for their machine. Crash has so far been the only real candidate for this position, as he is Sony's single attempt to personalise the machine. Now that the second game is close to release, this is the time when we'll really discover how popular Mr Bandicoot is. The game remains largely similar to the first, with the same mix of forward and backward scrolling levels, along with the same baddies and power ups. Of course, a couple of new ideas have been introduced which are detailed elsewhere in this preview, but even at this early stage one thing is certain the words 'same', 'similar and 'identical' are going to be associated with this game no matter which magazine you read it in...unless Naughty Dog pull something major our of their bowl. THE ROCKETEERS TEAR OUT YOUR HAIR: BANDICOOT'S BACK! You can read about the all-new zero gravity levels elsewhere on these pages. When you start one of these levels, Crash straps on a rocket pack and the doors to a weightlessness world open. Then you have to learn another new set of controls. X and Circle move Crash backwards and forwards, Up and Down on the D-Pad move him higher and lower in the level. Square still does the spin attack, which is the best way to smash all of the crates. The rocket pack does provide a new angle of gameplay, as it can be so difficult to control at times, making concentration vital. Now the crate is broken, the bubble will go and you can proceed. 12 BAD BOXES ARE BACK! The hippos submerge if you stand on them for too long. The crates that drove so many people mad in the first game (you had to find every single one on every single level to finish the game properly) are once again a key point to Crash 2. TNT, 1UP, bouncy and standard crates pop up on every level, but to hinder those with shaky joypad hands further, Naughty Dog have put in another type of box the Nitro. These green monsters instantly explode on contact, so you can't even jump on them to set a counter going. Once you hit the ice levels, or the zero gravity stages they become a real pain, as controlling Crash is so much harder. We can sense premature hair loss happening all over the country already. TAM THE SLIGHTLY LESS CONTROVERSIAL GRASH TO BE RELEASED THIS YEARI 40 NOOS PININOP WWW URB CRAWLER! Crash still retains his standard jump and spin moves, but he has gone back a peg on the evolutionary ladder, by learning to crawl after he learnt to walk! By hitting circle, Crash will get down on all fours and move (Slowly under any low ridges in his way. If you're moving and you hit the crouch button, he'll perform a slide which can take out enemies as well. At first, you'll still be in the habit of pressing down to crouch which can prove annoying. Learn not to do that however and you'll be shuffling about all over the place as you discover previously unreachable sections of the game. 23 Crawling. Not a majorly innovative new move, but a new trick all the same. Lovely. 36 "


"BEAR NECESSITIES computer Video games Originality is not something you'd associate with this next boxout for reasons that will become instantly apparent. Remember the levels Hog Wild and the Whole Hog from CB1? Well imagine that but set in the snow and riding on a polar bear. Now you have the basis behind the Bear It level. Crash jumps on the back of a Polar Bear and gallops through ice laden ponds, and over seals and penguins, while still smashing all the crates. The level is fun enough, but we already saw all this in the first game. Oh well.. PlayStation The red tiles are about to fall, so seek safety on the green ones. 90 The lasers fire in a set pattern, so take your time and they'll pose no threat. To jump off the jet, all you have to do is move into the small recess and Crash leaps off! Cool. There is no denying that Crash 2 features incredible graphics. METRO EVERYBODY HO SURFIN NITRO WITRO Remember the water levels from the last game? The Venus Fly Trap plants, the logs and the moving lily pads? Well this time, the moving lily pads have been replaced with motorised jet surfing things! Crash jumps onto the contraption and surfs (by jet power) over the water. Bashing into crates has the same effect as it does when you're spinning into them, and the bonuses can still be collected as normal. Watch out for mines though, as not even a jet-surfing thing can save you from death! TEAR OUT YOUR HAIR: BANDICOOT'S BACK! BONUS NOT A BRUCIE BONUS The mid-level bonus games have also changed a little since the last outing. Previously, any bonuses you collected in these were added straight onto your existing tally. But now, all apples and extra lives stay unclaimed until you finish the smaller sub game properly. Failure to do so results in a loss of everything collected and a waste of the bonus game. You don't lose a life for this though, so it's not all bad. Say hello to Taz Tiger, one of the new bosses in Crash 2. Fearsome looking guy. CRASH AND BURN? While there is no denying that this is one of the best looking games on the PlayStation to date, in terms of originality it still leaves a little to be desired. We hope that the full version proves us wrong and we'll be bringing you the ultimate lowdown next month. 37 "

Can't hold on until F-Zero 64? What you need is... EAT HYSTATIC PULSE 152 EXTREME G 8:26:31 2 U he N64 is still in need of a great racer. Multi Racing Championship, Wave Race 64 and Mario Kart 64 were all fine, but they lacked the final speed thrill. What the N64 needs is a racer packed with venom and pure adrenalin, something where you feel the G-force twisting your body out of shape. Which is where Extreme G pops up and says \"Hi, how y'all doing». Futuristic racing is the name of the game, and G has it in spades. Though it doesn't hide its inspiration, clearly borrowing from the big N's F-Zero and Psygnosis' anti-grav racing classic WipEout. What chance does Extreme G of making a name for itself? A lot! There are six bikes to choose from for the competition, each with different attributes. Each of the cybercycles has a fixed weapon. Choose from the puny Pulse Cannon, to the slightly better Laser, or best of the lot the Excel Cannon. Apart from your permanent firepower, there are bonus weapons to be won, as in WipEout. Littered around each course are power-ups. There are nearly twenty different types including invisibility, homing missiles, flame exhaust, mines, shields and even a tractor beam. Mastering when to use each weapon is essential, especially in later heats. Of course, the other riders can use the power-ups too. It can get fast and furious on these long tracks. Here the action gets dirty. NOT THE ULTIMATE F IT'S THE EXTREME Suck flame exhaust with a new top speed. SCI-FIME LAHTI DOH! 25851 LUE Being a futuristic racing game, Extreme G has one of those waffly backstories about how the Earth is now deserted. Humans now live on a specially-built satellite planet, Earth being no longer able to support life. For entertainment the Extreme G contest was devised. The drivers operate remote control cybercycles, across the barren home planet. All the extra space on Earth means that the tracks are large and complex, full of twists, loops, and corkscrews. This is the Extreme G. Make like the electrical Ben Hur with the impressive lon Side cannon. 833-18 8-21:16 ILE S AVERSUS ANTHEUTIMATE BATTLE NOOS NINO) There are twelve courses to conquer to become the champion, taking place over four different environments. Desert, mine, city and space are the locations for the challenge. Yet the action doesn't stop there. Get a second pad and a friend, and more modes of play open up. Tournament and head-tohead challenges are also included. Plus a flag game, where you race around a smaller track trying to collect as many flags as possible. Battle mode is similar to Mario Kart, with the action taking place in specially designed arenas. There is even a cup challenge which can accommodate up to 16 players, racing one-on-one heats in a knockout competition. Someone ahead has just run into trouble. Clean the road of that pile of puke. The roads often fork in two, with multiple routes to choose from. oooo 8:33-88 CLE HARDCORE H, IMPOSSIBLE I, JUMPING J'S WipEout clone or not, Extreme G is looking very impressive and it moves very fast. There's a lot more on offer here than most race games. The final fine tuning and tweaking is taking place as you read, with the CVG review real soon. 38 A long jump to the next tunnel. "

"computer video games 100% ADVENTURE BY WESTWOOD STUDIOS COVENTURE ES routerwon  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 4 CD'S COMPLETE NOV RELEASE 1 PLAYER ROM  RELEASED BY VIRGIN TEL 0171 368 2255 ROM Westwood — the creators of Command & Conquer — bring you a graphically stunning, revolutionary new game worthy of the name... BLADE RUNNER ames based on movies have a rough reputation. Until recent years a movie license meant a sub-standard platform game. These days advances in hardware allow software houses to think differently. Which is where Westwood step in. Three years ago they acquired the license to a 15 year old sci-fi classic Blade Runner. A movie rich in style and innovation, and one that seems to get better with age. The possibilities of a game based around such a film are endless. Thankfully Westwood sat down, and thought about the potential of the project. What they have produced is nothing short of a new kind of video game. CULT CLASSIC MOVIE SET TO BECOME CLASSIC GAME O O O O O O HE SAY YOU BLADE RUNNER O O O O O O If you've never seen the original film, where have you been? Released in 1982 to much critical acclaim, but poor box office takings, Blade Runner has gone on to achieve a cult status, resulting in the definitive Directors Cut being released a few years ago. The movie is set in Los Angeles 2019, six replicants (androids) have escaped from an off-world colony and are heading back to Earth to meet their maker. They are hunted down by Deckard, a blade runner. Based on the novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' by Philip K Dick, the film was highly influential. Nearly every sci-fi movie since has tried to copy its style, and its vision of the future looks more and more possible. 1 Scenes like this will be familiar if you've seen the film. + The Bradbury building where the climax of the movie is set. Shadows and light play a large part in Blade Runner. 1 It's just like the movie. Even more so with the music playing. O I NEED THE OLD DECKARD, THE OLD MAGIC O The game follows the plot of the film. This of these are possible replicants and you must time with five replicants roaming the streets use your skills to find out who. Every time you of Los Angeles, 2019. You take on the role of start a new game, the five that are replicants Ray McCoy, blade runner. Again, like the film changes. What's more, the events of the there is a possibility that McCoy is the sixth game run parallel with the storyline of the replicant. A cast of 70 characters, each with film, so McCoy can cross Deckard's tracks their own agendas, inhabit this world. Thirteen and meet characters from the movie. 1 Bryant's office and Deckard's apartment are places from the movie to visit. 40 "


"computer video games REACTION TIME IS A FACTOR CD In the film, Deckard relied on two machines to help his detective work. Both are available in the game. The Voigt-Kampf test which measures false emotions like a lie detector and ESPER machine, make hunting the replicants possible. The ESPER is used to analyse photos, scouring for clues. Areas of each photo can be enlarged and the image enhanced. The photos (just like all the scenes in the game) are in 3D. So the camera can rotate around objects to find vital information. Using ESPER it is even possible to read the titles of books, that at first were just a dot in the distance. All clues found are entered into KIA, a digital assistant that helps you link clues to suspects. ROM O O O MORE HUMAN THAN HUMAN O O O Events in the game are played in realtime. Because of this McCoy's actions can have a direct and often indirect influence on the game. Due to the high level of artificial intelligence each character possesses, McCoy must sometimes be discreet in his work. Kill a Replicant in a public place and word will soon get around of your intentions. This is because characters in the game will pass information onto each other. However, kill a replicant in a deserted alley and the 'skin jobs' will be baffled. Merely interviewing potential replicants could prove hazardous, as again info is passed on between the characters 'off camera'. Provide the replicants with too much prior knowledge, and the hunter may find himself the hunted, as they chase the same leads to intercept you. esper 1 Use ESPER to analyse old photographs. Lots of information is hidden in each picture. 1 Places such as this noodle bar should prove useful for gaining information. 1 Animal Row could also contain a few clues, plus some unsavoury characters. CULT CLASSIC MOVIE SET TO BECOME CLASSIC GAME The city is big, featuring over seventy different locations. Better get a map. Want to take the police spinner for a ride? You may need to speak to Gaff first. The graphics capture the mood and look of the film very well. We can't wait! The replicants could be hiding anywhere. O O O PITY SHE WON'T LIVE... O O O A NEW LIFE AWAITS YOU... Not only does Blade Runner offer you something new, with the merger of a point-and-click adventure and a realtime strategy game, but also in terms of graphics. Utilising integrated full motion video and an unprecedented amount of polygons on screen, Blade Runner looks special (we could have easily filled both these pages describing the technical wizardry on display, such as volumetric lighting and particle effects). The look is enhanced by the use of atmospheric lighting, shadows and the trademark rain of the film. Add the original Vangelis soundtrack, plus voice-overs for characters by the original cast, and Blade Runner could become something more than a game inspired by a film, it becomes something that compliments it. The potential of this awesome game is mind blowing. With C&C Westwood have already proven they know how to make a realtime strategy game, with Blade Runner they could turn the gaming world upside down. The release is set for November, expect a review soon. 41 "

PC CD-ROM AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED COMPLETE TM PlayStation DEC RELEASE 1 PLAYER  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY INTERPLAY TEL 01628 423666 PlayStation One of the PC's hottest games of the last year gets ever closer to the PlayStation. Go beyond Shiny's Earthworm Jim with MDK. ure energy streams recently discovered in space are being used by an alien race to transport themselves to Earth. The aliens have created enormous mobile minecrawlers entire cities which move around the surface of the planet destroying anything in the way. It's down to you as Kurt, wearing a suit of high-calibre armour, to save the world. In each area, you must race to stop the aliens before the massive crawlers crush the final breath out of innocent Earthlings! WHOOPS! MIND YER HEAD! SHINY ENTERTAINMENT'S MDK MASTERPIECE! The best feature of the fantastic so-called Coil armour suit is the sniper helmet. Kurt can remove the gun from his arm and attach it to the front of his helmet, giving him a special zooming sniper view. With the helmet on, it's possible to zoom the view right in on any enemy in the level, no matter how far away they are. When zoomed in close, it's easier to accurately pinpoint shots so that enemies are taken out in one go you can shoot off separate limbs from miles away! At the end of a level, the number of enemies killed by having their heads shot off through the sniper view is tallied up. Taking on a room-full of massive robots like this is a very bad idea. You need to search the level for some sort of disguise... It is hard for aliens to dodge A shot to the face takes the your long-distance sniper shots. enemy's head clean off! GRAPHICAL WERDNESS NON-STOP FUN AND DEATH ALL THE WAY! The graphic style of MDK is very unusual. Some surfaces are left untextured, while others have wacky patterns all over them. The architecture of the cities is extremely weird, and often very impressive. The PlayStation version of MDK looks surprisingly similar to the excellent PC game, with only a slight loss of detail on the textures. Everything moves around smoothly, and the sniper zoom is still as good to look at as ever. There are also new effects on some of the explosions, and the game's still not finished yet! COMING SOON The completed version of MDK for the PlayStation will have every one of the levels of the PC game, all of which are brilliantly designed. Each level has a different selection of set-pieces from the last, with different vehicles to use, enemies to get past, and puzzles to solve. The pre-production disc we played already has a section where kurt can call an alien ship which he then pilots around a group of buildings. Alien ground troops run for cover and hide in bunkers as Kurt rains bombs onto them from above. There are also some brilliant power-ups such as \"The World's Smallest Nuclear Explosion\", which produces a mushroom cloud only. two feet high! ON A PLAYSTATION NEAR YOU SOON A This is the first version of MDK for the PlayStation that has had most of the main features in place. And it's looking very promising, with graphics that are close to the PC original. What we really want to know is how well MDK is going to play and how long it's going to last. Until it's completely finished we won't know the answer. We'll have a review very soon. 44 "

We unveil the future and we're talking crystal balls. The month's events and software releases at a glance. Oct-Nov THE BIG NINTENDO SHOW he floodgates have nearly opened. The release schedules are almost buckling under the pressure of so many games. Now is the time to start analysing the release dates, checking out CVG for the reviews, and compiling your Christmas lists. If you still haven't sent thank you notes for last year's presents, you'd better write some quickly. We'd just like to remind you that the trusty release schedule is highly likely to change, because games often slip back in their development. Also companies may want to avoid releas ing games on the same day as potential blockbusters (check out 7th November to see what we mean, that potential line-up is definitely going to change). Our palms are getting very sweaty in anticipation over the delights due between now and Christmas. We hope yours are too. November 21st 23rd. Tokyo. The major Nintendo show of the year. Taking place in the Makuhari Messe, one of the biggest exhibition centres in Japan, this is going to draw huge crowds. The show will be divided between N64 and Pocket Monster, with N intendo planning to debut nine games, including FZero, Zelda and Yoshi's Story. Plus there's third party support showing the likes of Hybrid Heaven, Dracula 3D, Nagano Winter Olympics and Bomberman amongst others. TLAKE GT03 | UML 00'03 73 CHAP WIN! WIN! WIN!

What we'd really like is a flashing siren which you put on the top of your craft when chasing a criminal just like in all the TV cop shows. Is there anything you'd like added to the Havoc that would make the job easier? We want you to design the ultimate police car for catching criminals.

Last year's PlayStation Expo proved so successful that this year Sony have renamed the show, and are taking it on the road. Unlike most games shows which are trade events only, the club festival has been put together for the gamesplayers. As the show is taking place over two months, new games could be added to the line-up. Tekken 3, Biohazard 2, Metal Gear Solid, Nagano Winter Olympics and Parasite Eve are the games that should be gaining the biggest crowds. Plus the possible appearance of PaRappa the Rapper 2.

Ed's been playing the game since it arrived, and all we hear from his corner is 'Shake it baby' every ten minutes. We quite like Duke's cheesy humour, and all his catch phrases such as; 'I'm gonna get medieval on your asses', 'I ain't afraid of no Quake, and \"Damn, you're ugly'.

Prepare for this to rock your emotions; revolationise your belief of what a video garne can achieve. Tifa ANTASY VI he numbers involved with Final Fantasy VII speak for themselves, in terms of sales, and the hours of enjoyment it offers. But statistics don't make Final Fantasy VII the unforgettable classic it's destined to be. The experience, of a kind never-before realised in video games, is what will speak to you personally. And the message is power. Never underestimate the power Sony's campaign since the launch of PlayStation. Final Fantasy VII captures it all. Most importantly, the intensity is driven home from the inside out. The core of the game, its theme, is energy which is developed through the story it tells, and takes shape as some of the greatest moments in video game history. Arguably some of the best moments in entertainment history. The gaming equivalent of a meteor heading toward planet Earth is about to impact. SHOCKWAVE!!! FINAL FANTASY VI * ROLE PLAYING ADVENTURE STICKS AND STONES Final Fantasy VII is a Role Playing Game (RPG). Unfortunately for those who still need the concept explained, RPGs are adapted in many different ways by games producers. But the version most suitable to explain FFVII is this: You adopt the role of a character on a quest to save the world. His abilities improve according to experience in battle. This translates as enhanced physical attributes, and an increasing selection of cool magic. These skills help to survive the dangers of a huge world, which can be explored at leisure. So long as your idea of leisure is fighting creatures from the back of oblivion, and solving planet-size problems. To increase your chances of success, other like-minded characters assist in the battles. Occasionally they help solve problems too. If you pay attention to what they're saying. Only if you become the very best you can be, by learning how to fight skilfully; visiting everywhere possible, and solving all the puzzles, will you save the world. One of your primary occupations in FFVII is surviving lots of battles, so the graphic rewards for being skilled are made to leave you gasping. Only the villages and towns are excluded from the fighting element. Even so, there are secluded areas in which danger may strike. When the enemy attacks, they When characters switch do so from out of nowhere! weapons, the change is shown on screen. Barret (above) uses a Chain Gun as standard.

"CALLING NAMES computer video games Magic Materia is the most intriguing of all types, because it offers the most impressive results. The only downside is that magic Materia drains some physical energy when it's installed. But an arsenal of attacks like these is worth the sacrifice. STANDARD MAGIC GREEN MATERIA) SUAMON BEAST (RED MATERIA), PlayStation Shinra's president confronts AVALANCHE. He's brought trouble. Call upon the elements, or conjure some dread poison from the air, to launch unavoidable attacks on the enemy. By equipping blue 'Support' Materia, the effects can be at least doubled. Choose your magic wisely because, just like you, some enemies may be immune to or even absorb some types. Colossal, fantastical gods and mythical creatures which erupt from the ground, or else descend from the heavens. With cool names like Ifrit, Katijana, and Hades, these are the main attraction no doubt about it. Watch in awe as they stage unforgettable onslaughts which you never tire of seeing.

"computer video games DYNAWIC NEW FRIENDS ENGLISH FEVIL IS THE BEST! When Square announced Final Fantasy VII for the US, rumours spread about the threat of censorship. A site on the internet even allowed concerned fans to 'sign' a petition against such a move. It's not certain whether Square Soft had planned omissions, but the censorship never happened. US/UK players are getting everything the Japanese version had and more! We asked Kenji Mimura at Square LA to explain why. PlayStation * Please could you mention the most significant comments made by Japanese players of FFVII, and how Square Soft responded. There were comments by Japanese gamers that the game was difficult due to many battles. With input from our hands-on players, we have balanced the encounter rate of battles, and we have added several events and several new Weapon monsters to have the players be fully engulfed in the story of FFVII and to have new challenges against these new monsters. The additional Weapon monsters are designed to be even tougher than the final boss. The plot-line which runs through FFVII is magnificently complex. It concerns subjects that are often very deep, which may cause you to think very seriously. Yet the driving force is always hope and courage, against all odds. You feel good because you know you can win. This guy Reno Cloud marvels at The story begins with belongs to Shinra's one of the immense a revolutionary group mafia The Turks. Mako reactors before called Avalanche a Having sworn their joining Avalanche at small team rebelling lives to Shinra, The the main entrance. against the all-powTurks confront This is a really slick erful Shinra organiAvalanche at key cut scene used early sation. Shinra built points throughout. in the game. their empire on the back of a technology which extracts the life force of the planet, and transforms it into power. It's believed that Shinra even use this life force, Mako, to enhance the abilities of Saint their soldiers, which explains the glow of their eyes. Impressive, just like anything Shinra creates. But in their selfish rise to glory, Shinra rubbished the lives of many innocent people. Avalanche is just one example of how the people are trytragedy involving the most respected figure in ing to fight back. the force a soldier called Sephiroth. Shinra's immense HQ is the centrepiece Cloud the revolutionary, then? If only it were so of a city called Midgar. Here our hero, simple.

Something so chilling you may someShinra's army, but was disillusioned after a times wish you had never begun to seek it out.  indicators point to enemy weak spots in the English-language version of Final Fantasy VII. Just press the R2 button to see them. Clouc Red Vack Sense 2802490 Sumon ter 3410 516 How closely does the the manner in which characters refer to each other, and the dilemmas they face remain true to the original? The dilemmas the characters face remain true to the Japanese version. But additions have been made to the English version to further enrich the story of FFVII. The narratives were not changed. They have been translated to be as close to the original as possible. COOL TRANSPORT AVOIDS HEAT IA ISVLNYA TINTA Barret Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm.. >> Barret is the tough guy, so he talks tough. Square Soft even allow him to swear! His whole manner indicates that he's ready to fight hard. Our understanding of the world its size and limitations only goes as far as our experience of it. This is how Final Fantasy VII works, challenging you to push back the boundaries of an imaginary world. Rather than present everything at once, losing people, the world map unfolds piece by piece. Specific problems or key battles have the same effect as locked doors. Only when you have achieved the level of ingenuity required to be granted the key whether it's to find an enemy's weak spot, or hit upon the solution to a puzzle are you presented with new horizons. To close the distances as they become greater, the team are presented with a cool set of vehicles. The experience is always rewarding and fun, since predicting the future is impossible. Your mission is always to be prepared for what is to come. Choose to view the outside world from high above, or ground level. Whichever way you choose, the detail is impressive. * What was the reason for including new Elementals in the US/UK version of FFVII? Why weren't they included in the original? With the time we had since the release of the Japanese version, we were given the opportunity to fully consider and incorporate the feedback from our Japanese gamers. With this opportunity, we wanted to have the American and European gamers to fully experience the Final Fantasy VII story by incorporating new Elementals. The final transport made available is 'Highwind'. In the air there is no threat of attack, and places are reached in mega-quick time. The tiny red arrows show the exits. These are new to the English version of the game. The white pointer has always been an option. REVIEW Is FFVII now the greatest RPG that Square Soft has ever created? We feel that we create games that are at the maximum of the available technology. With FFVII, the increased memory capacity of the CD-roms enabled us to create a masterpiece that takes us into the next generation of interactivity. Lurking beneath the sea are some incredibly tough enemies, including one of the new deadly Weapon monsters. ** Please pass on a message to all the UK players who are eager to play FFVII. With close to 200 people and two years of development, we sincerely hope that the European players will be engulfed in the Final Fantasy VII experience. 54 "

Shoo, shoo.\" One of the first problems in the game is how to get into the Honey Bee Inn a... er... men's club. quna settle things here and now... SEPHIROTH PINAGEANTA SI VE Barret \"DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!!!\" CVG OPINION Soon this name will chill you to the core. No Final Fantasy VII feature is complete without acknowledging Sephiroth's power. Darth Vader is sinister as galactic super villain in Star Wars. Sephiroth is the equivalent of Darth Vader times ten! You'll swear he is a demon, judging from his diabolical acts. When Sephiroth is introduced the plot makes a sinister departure from what you originally believe FFVII to be. Sephiroth is a threat to Cloud physically, mentally, and spiritually. His dark mystery is linked to a top secret Shinra project, code named 'Jenova', under which genetic experiments created disgusting mutations. At first Sephiroth seeks to avenge Shinra's immoral acts. But, for reasons beyond his control, Sephiroth soon lusts for the vmbolised by Jenova to have all the universe respond to his needs. Make sure you have the doors locked, and all the windows closed for the final, climactic confrontation! Expect to find some scenes in the game to be very hard-hitting. If you own a PlayStation you must own this game. Not least because Final Fantasy VII introduces an incredible new era of interactive entertainment. From the moment Aerith fixes her eyes on yours during the opening movie, you're in for the ride no way you're going to let her mystery lay unsolved. Adapting to the game's style takes no longer than winning the first few battles, and being tempted by the first threads of the magnificent plot. From then on you're hooked, because Final Fantasy VII is like nothing you have ever experienced before. Square Soft have adapted their most popular series to become something very different; something truly unique. Three CDs containing sights and sounds previously unimaginable. Each connected by a thrilling storyline, brought to life with ingenious gameplay. The future of PlayStation is assured by this key to the future of games. PAUL DAVIES REVIEW MULTS RATING RATING000 EX Sephiroth destroys everything to get what he wants. The scene above will break your heart. A must-have game for your PlayStation. All the excitement you expect, empowered by heartrending emotional scenes you don't. Buy this. 55 "

And the noise they make will alert all of the troops in the area, who come to investigate, find you and starting unloading everything they've got. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. OBJECTIVE DE COMPLETED Although this is the last objective for the Frigate stage, it's worth doing first to save a bit of time. EXCITED BY CIRCUITRY? Once you reach the missile silo stage, the tasks set before you become a little tougher. Wandering between the rocket launch sites you come across small laboratories full of scientists and guards. The scientists need to survive, so take care when dispensing the guards. Then you have to put the willies in them so they drop keycards and in one instance, a DAT code the recovering of which is the one of the mission objectives.

Hurry! take a few shots before you spot them. Look out for this hand on the park stage as a very handy body armour is here too. YOU MOVE, YOU DIEL The Frigate stage is one of the most entertaining in the game as you have to be constantly aware of your surroundings in order to complete it. Scattered around the ship are hostages who need saving from the clutches of the evil henchmen. If you enter a room with a hostage inside it, you have about three seconds to take aim and fire at the captor before he executes the helpless civilian. A couple of the hostages are situated next to bombs, so going in all guns blazing will make them detonate under the crossfire and you'll all die. Should three or more of the hostages kick the bucket, the stage is over and you have to start again. But one final point should always be in your mind. Once a hostage is released, he isn't free. He has to get to the outside of the ship first, so make sure the surrounding rooms are clear before he runs away, because the terrorists will still shoot any unfriendly patrons aboard their ship. DARKNESS DESCENDS Remember the snow level from the beginning half of the game? You'd better remember where everything is, because you'll be visiting it again. But at night. This stage will take you ages to finish, simply because the visibility is so poor. Troops come at you from all over the place, so unless you see one early you'll always take hits. The bunker that was such a hazard from the earlier level, is the ultimate goal, but the comms link between the bunker and the satellite needs to be taken out as well. We'd advise using any silenced weapons to avoid unwanted attention, and also look out from more security cameras they have been installed at extra places around the level. 22 128 GOLDENPASTE 1 As James walks around the corner, a hostage with his hands up comes into view.

At first, finding him is a little more difficult than you'd imagine as he's tucked away in some form of container.

LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE ENEMY GOLDERVERTE 7176 Something which deserves a mention here, is the enemy reactions to different situations. Where you shoot people obviously has an affect on the extent of the injury you cause them. Soldiers, for instance, can take a wealth of bullets to their arms, causing them to stumble for a few seconds before actually dying. One round to the head however sees them die instantly, dropping their weapon (which every dead person does). You can tell when someone is dying because their clothes become slightly bloodstained as well. Enemies also react to your actions. If someone is shooting at you while your back is turned and you spin around to face them, they'll often roll behind buildings or scenery to save themselves. This is all well and good, but then they come strolling around the corner as if nothing had happened, which kind of spoils it a bit!

They're not very good quality, but are strangely amusing. I was completely blown away by Duke Nukem 3D on the PC. The amount of effort and detail put into each and every one of the levels is unbelievable, and thankfully just about every little bit is included in the Saturn version! The graphics are fantastic detailed levels which move around quickly and smoothly, plus the brilliant new lighting effects make this the best-looking console corridor game! The controls have been changed quite a bit to fit on the joypad, but mostly work well. All the original levels are included, all of which are massive with loads to do in every single room. Just about every area in the game is memorable because of the variety and detail throughout. The only bad thing is that the enemies are still pretty terrible. The aliens are all very uninteresting and get really blocky up close, though the enormous bosses make up for their problems. Duke Nukem 3D has always been a better oneplayer game than Quake, and it works as well on console as it ever did on the PC. The size of the game, the cheesy sense of humour (one that actually works, the non-stop high speed bloody action, the excellent levels all go to make up the best console corridor game there is. Make sure you get it. ED LOMAS The more \"hardcore\" of you may remember that completing Lobotomy's hideously difficult challenge of finding all 23 team dolls in Exhumed gave you nothing.

Once you've beaten the first few stages, got deeper into the game and have a few decent ships stored in your hangar, the game throws at you the option of having a wingman. You can choose from a male (Slash) or female (Edge) sidekick and assign them tactics depending on the mission briefing. They can be asked to clear airspace above your main target, cover your tail or go off and attack enemy ships. Wingmen have to be paid too, so hiring one when you have little or no money is not recommended. Once you're up there, your partner becomes a very useful ally, as they do appear to carry out the tasks you set them. Killing enemies can often be a problem in Ace Combat 2, as you have to get within a certain range, usually under 100 feet, for your missiles to get a lock-on. Once the two targets have matched and turned red, it's time to let off a couple of missiles for ultimate destruction. The downside to that is that the enemy craft also have the same range as you, so you'll get shot to pieces if you aren't quick on the trigger finger and joypad. Upgrading your planes can give you more speed and a greater distance on the missile range, so nip into Planes-R-Us whenever you get the chance.

The coloured dots on this game's particular radar not only show what sort of enemy are in your vicinity, but also their allegiance friend or foe. Blue dots are your wingmen and yellow are friendly buildings that MUSTN'T be shot. White arrows signify the enemy planes and red dots are the static targets like gun turrets and buildings that must be disposed of immediately. If you get lost however, holding down square will call up a more detailed and wider version of the map, so you can look over a bigger bulk of the level. A neat little quirk appears at the end of a level too, where you get a run through of everywhere you have been and the exact places you made kills. Not important, but cool all the same.

The action comes at you from the start, and providing you have some idea of how these games work, you'll be into the tougher missions in no time. Even if you're a novice at these games, Ace Combat guides you in with relative ease. The missions did seem a bit too samey sometimes, but when you have to destroy the space shuttle or take on the fleet of carriers over a sunset drenched ocean, you soon forget that.

"computer video games PLATFORM ADVENTURE BY ARGONAUT SOFTWARE  PRICE ETBA  NO OTHER VERSIONS AVAILABLE  SATURN AND PC VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1 CD  RELEASED BY FOX INTERACTIVE TEL 01753 549442 1 PLAYER OCT 10 RELEASE PlayStation PlayStation \"Making mince meat out of Mario\" is what Fox Interactive is saying about this 3D platformer. Dogh. Minced plumber. Surely not? CROC: hen the gaming public first clapped eyes on the 3D wonders of Mario 64 a fair proportion of them us included hailed it as the best video game of all time. But when you're the best there's always somebody who'll come snapping at your heels. Which is where Croc: Legend of the Gobbos bursts in. Creators Argonaut Software are guys who know 3D games they designed Nintendo's SuperFX chip so who better to have a crack at creating a Mario 64 buster? But get this to show that awesome 3D graphics on platform games aren't limited to Nintendo, Argonaut has designed it for your PlayStation, Saturn and PC, not the N64. LEGEND OF THE GOBBOS CROC'S ON THE CASE Kidnapping. It's a common crime among video game villains. Bowser. Robotnik. Final Fight's Mr Big. Now there's a new kidnapper on the loose. Evil magician, Baron Dante, has hijacked the entire population of Gobbos, a species of peaceful, brown, Koosh Ball creatures, and imprisoned them on four different islands with his Dantini gremlins standing guard. Croc, an orphaned crocodile who was adopted by the Gobbos at an early age, is our hero. He has taken it upon himself to trek through over 50 different areas packed with danger and platform-based puzzles to rescue his lost brothers, and show Baron Dante the1 The polygonised intro tells the error of his ways. Let's hope there's a cell free on story of Croc, from Moses-like Kidnapper's Row, eh readers? foundling to crocodilian crusader. WHAT CROCCA CROC: LEGEND OF THE GOBBOS Like any 90s platform game star, Croc can do more than just jump about the place. By way of selfdefence he can use the good old bum-bounce press jump twice to bring Croc crashing down on his foes or deliver a sound thrashing with a swish of his tail. Our reptilian chum can also climb (but only up special rock face ladders) and swing, claw over claw, on overhead netting. Like others of his species, Croc swims, but only in nice blue water, not the nasty green stuff. But he will also push crates around tracks for use as mobile platforms. Players using the new analogue pad will find they can use the left thumbstick to control Croc's speed. If you're using the regular controller you just hold the up key until he breaks into a run. Crush your foes with this standard defence tactic the age-old bum-bounce. Or try the tail-spin attack, previously seen being performed by our friend Gex. REVIEW You get some tasty lighting effects when Croc's swimming. Swinging from overhead grating. Bet you've never seen a crocodile do this, eh? And you don't see this every day of the week, either. Go back to your jungle, Croc! CROC'S CRYSTAL COLLECTION Mario has his coins. Sonic has his rings. Croc has his crystals. Each level has 50 crystals in awkward places, and if Croc collects them they serve a dual purpose. If he collects enough of them he can earn an extra life and while he's carrying at least one crystal Croc can't be hurt. If he takes a hit he simply drops his crystals and gets a few seconds to recover as many as he can just like Sonic and his rings. 64 "


"RAINBOW WARRIOR ** computer video games As well as the regular crystals, every level contains five rainbow crystals. If Croc collects all five he can leave through a rainbow door leading to a short bonus section that differs from level to level. Sometimes it's just an obstacle course that leads to the final Gobbo or you may get a sub-game that can score some handy extra lives. TM PlayStation Ah, pretty crystal! If only 1 had four more like you! KEY ISSUES But I have! See how they open the rainbow door! Who knows what riches lie in the rainbow zone? Each level in Croc is set in four or five rooms, and the objective is to rescue all six Gobbos imprisoned therein and find the gong that summons Beanie, the Bird Of Transport-To-The-Next-Level. But the way from one room to another is often blocked by a locked door, so finding keys is a constant problem. It's not just doors that need keys, either. Sometimes you come across a Gobbo in a cage, who can only be released by finding the correct key. You can even find cages containing buttons that activate lifts or floating platforms to get you to otherwise unreachable objects. DANILNI ON THE ROCKS tail-whip from Croc. But some of them are a bit more cunning such as the Yeti that splits into smaller yetis when ever Croc scores a hit. As he moves from level to level, Croc is constantly harassed by Baron Dante's Dantinis, sniggering gremlins that chase him, throw snowballs or shoot fireballs at our boy. They're annoying but not too difficult to deal with. More tricky are the bosses that Croc has to face every few levels, when Dante appears and transforms some hapless beast into a rampaging but often confused monstrosity. A lot of the bosses work in the same way; they attack, then rest for a moment, during which time they're vulnerable to a Yes. A key. 1 Yes. A door. They were made for each other. CROC: LEGEND OF THE GOBBOS A diabolical Dantini. They must all pay. CVG OPINION This was once a friendly ladybird. Now it's angry. An unpleasant Yeti, formed of four bewitched goats. Fox is trying to suggest that Croc is the PlayStation's Mario 64, but anyone who has played both games for more than ten minutes will tell you that the comparison doesn't do Croc any favours. Unlike Mario, which had all the power of Miyamoto's imagination on its side, Croc really isn't much more than an old-fashioned platformer that uses all the familiar cliches the ice/lava/desert levels, jumping on enemies to destroy them, etc. It sets level after level of tasks like collecting crystals, finding keys, opening doors, shoving blocks and catching lifts. It's all the usual platform game malarkey' that we've seen a hundred times before. Admittedly, PlayStation owners haven't seen it in quite this form, and you have to give Argonaut credit for the detail in the 3D environment which looks excellent (like other 3D platform games, Croc occasionally suffers from the Where-Exactly-Am-l-Jumping' problem). Technically it's a very accomplished game, and it does give the player plenty to do. Just don't go expecting anything genuinely ground-breaking. PAUL Girl ACES * * MYSTERY ISLAND ** Every good game has hidden bonuses in it, and Argonaut haven't skimped on the secret stuff in Croc. As well as the alternate rainbow ending on every course, there are sparkly warps that take Croc to rooms full of extra lives. Also, by collecting your full quota of Gobbos in the levels defended by a boss, and then defeating that boss, you gain access to a secret stage. There are eight of these in the game, all ! containing a magic jigsaw piece. Collect all the jigsaw pieces and lo, a whole new secret island appears on the map! REVIEW RATING RATING 0 The sparkling warps take you to rooms full of hearts. Each one grants an extra life, so get as many as possible! A decent enough platformer with an accomplished 3D twist.

If you're going to get the jokes you'll need to have followed the show from the start through to the latest series. If your only Simpsons experience comes from watching the ancient episodes the BBC have been screening lately you might as well not bother. That is, unless you want to buy all the more recent episodes on video as well. Which, come to think of it, isn't a bad idea. PAUL Git Alices THE SPRINGFIELD QUEST REVIEW You can just wallow in the memories if you like, but there are some genuine, if minor, game elements to Virtual Springfield. You can embark on the quest for 74 Simpsons trading cards hidden around town. To find them all, you need to solve simple puzzles of the 'find object A to get into location B' type. They're nothing fancy but the quest does give you the impetus to keep exploring. Elsewhere, there are a number of mini arcade games, which give you the opportunity to throw darts at a poster of Sideshow Bob or play Larry The Looter in the Noizeland Arcade. Again, simple stuff, but these games make entertaining asides. GERBIL FOD RATING This map found in Lisa's drawer eventually leads to... RATING ... A Krusty the Clown trad ing card. Ooh. A rare one. OUT 03 At it The perfect opportunity for hardcore fans to wallow in a full-on Simpsons experience. Newborn Simpsonians may feel a bit lost, though. 66 "

The PlayStation's ultimate gun game is set for imminent UK release. If you haven't saved up for it yet, read on to find out what you're gonna miss... 4580 ACTION! 0400\"26 TOPTR04_30200 ZIVE amco are more than just developers of PlayStation games, they are the lbercreators of PlayStation games! With the likes of Rage Racer and Tekken 2, their arcade conversions go beyond A-list games, to rate as the very benchmark titles on Sony's console. And with Time Crisis they've exceeded even their own previous efforts. This is the arcade game and a whole new original mode, PLUS a modified replica of the coin-op gun. Of course, regular readers know all this from our hands-on look at the import version in our September issue. Back then we promised a follow-up interview with the Namco team behind the game. However, suffering our own time crisis, the interview missed our deadline. And now zero-hour is already upon us the UK version is ready! So, rather than repeating ourselves in this review, we're bringing you the inside story from its makers their thoughts on the conversion, the workings of the gun, the tactics of the original mode, plus of course, OUR verdict! 3170 5703 ACTIONS Namco have given us an ..an innovative and awesome arcade conversion... brilliant extra gun game... 1 ...and the best light gun on PlayStation. Excelsior! * TIME CRISIS: THE ARCADE CONVERSION* The chance to own a near spot-on conversion of Namco's smash-hit ,000 coin-op all for only sixty quid. That's what you get from PlayStation Time Crisis. Taking fifteen months for a 20-person team to develop, the Arcade Mode pushes the PlayStation hardware more than any other Namco conversion. CVG: Did any of the arcade Time Crisis team work on the PlayStation conversion? NAMCO: The arcade team gave us the Time Crisis game data and we discussed the project with them. However, they didn't assist directly in the development of the Playstation version. CVG: How accurate is the PlayStation version compared to the arcade? NAMCO: The gameplay is about 95% perfect. No matter how hard you try, it's not possible to make the Playstation exactly the same as the arcade. The number of enemies appearing at any one time have been reduced by delaying their appearance until the on-screen enemy count lowers. Only someone who played the arcade version a lot would notice. Datawise it's almost identical. + + + WE TINE 02054286 F 02'53PUOI CVG: What difficulties did you encounter converting Time Crisis from the System 22 coin-op to the PlayStation? NAMCO: First there was the speed. The CPU processing speed is overwhelmingly different between these two systems. Secondly, the arcade machine has incredible power to display a large number of polygons beautifully. To convert that, unchanged, to the Playstation would have made it so slow as to crawl along. So, we had to reduce the number of polygons and drop the frame rate from 60 per second to 30. PlayStation may be equivalent to Namco's System 11 coin-op, but here they're near matching System 22! REVIEW CVG: Did you create any new programming tools to help with the conversion? NAMCO: Yes, a lot of them. To generate the high speed polygon graphics drawing engine for the original Time Crisis, the arcade development team created a completely new Time Crisis polygon format. To recreate this on the Playstation we had to make a lot of tools. Some were created before the development started, while the others were created as and when they were needed. PROGRAMMER TARGETED! MR NAOTO KUMAGAI I'd like to emphasise the arcade mode. It's a virtually perfect conversion, so arcade gamers who really got into Time Crisis will be able to make full use of all those techniques you learnt before, and enjoy playing it again with the full knowledge that this Playstation edition is an identical conversion!

"O INSIDE THE NAMCO GUN! O computer video games Game IN PlayStation Otherwise known as the GunCon and soon to be known as the G-Con 45 over here. Cloned from the coin-op pistol, it not only adds that vital 'arcade feel' to Time Crisis, but provides the PlayStation with a super-accurate weapon to match Sega's Virtua Gun. Questions have arisen over how it works though, and why it needs an extra lead going into the back of your PlayStation... GAME DESIGNER TARGETED! MR HIROYUKI ONODA Mr Hiroyuki Onoda: The narrow line of sight to the enemy and the small target area do make it difficult to shoot accurately in the beginning. However, you'll get used to this and before long you'll be able to shoot them bang! bang! bang!, just like that. You'll be able to take them out with just one bullet! Your time will get better because your marksmanship will improve. And because of this the excitement you get from playing Time Crisis will increase! CVG: Why does the GunCon need that extra cable? NAMCO: With the arcade version, it's always the same machine being used in the same kind of game centre. The environment is always pretty much the same and it's easy for us to read the screen because the light is locked in, so to speak. With the home version, the TV's size and location large or small screen, bright or dark place is always different, so there's the danger the gun wouldn't accurately read the screen. To prevent this problem we use the actual video signal from the Playstation. LED CVG: When did you realise it was necessary to use this cable? NAMCO: First we tried using the gun without the cable. During tests we found it wasn't possible to keep the gun-sight stable enough. In Time Crisis it's often necessary to shoot distant enemies in the head in order to progress quickly. With this poor accuracy you'd be unable to play properly. To improve the accuracy we decided to use the cable. All the technology for implemen\\ting this was already available from the arcade division, so we had no difficulty incorporating it into the gun. CVG: How do you think the GunCon compares with other Playstation and Saturn guns? NAMCO: Because we use the direct video signal from the back of the Playstation there's a major improvement in the accuracy of the gun. It's the best of all the Playstation guns available! The Sega Saturn uses a different system so we can't make a comparison. CODE 4586 4220.11 FERIE TIEI SES 0233nas TIME EXTENDED WAITIES 5470 WAITSESTEREO SPED The scenery plays a part too. Don't miss that door. So CVG: We've found the gun to be almost 'too' accurate. The bullets seem to have a very small 'hit area' making the game quite hard. Are you likely to make the hit area bigger for the foreign versions? NAMCO: We couldn't make the hit area any bigger as it would change the nature of the game. We'd have to readjust the entire gameplay as the balance would be lost. Technically we can change the size of the hit area, however there's the danger the area could encompass two or more enemies. In the case where one enemy is behind another and you wanted to shoot the one behind, if the hit area was too large it could overlap. the enemy in front as well. The computer wouldn't know which one you intended to shoot at! You'd lose the precision and the player would have the feeling he was relying on a rather crude system. However, if you buy a bigger TV your accuracy will improve. (laughs). 14188 uit REVIEW IURE 230 -W5653 SCP All the arcade attract sequences are in there!

"more on on CHECKING INTO THE LAKESIDE HOTELS games BEYOND THE COIN-OP: 1?! PLAYSTATION MODE!!?! As an arcade conversion, PlayStation Time Crisis is a near-perfect masterpiece. Incredibly though, it also includes a eight-level original mode that's even better! Taking up half the development time and ten extra staff, it pits hero. Richard Miller against another enemy fortress, bigger, badder foes, and a new multi-path play-system! CVG: Why choose a hotel as the setting for the PlayStation Mode? NAMCO: Well, the arcade mode is set in an old castle isn't it? So our first thoughts were to have a completely different location. A building full of things is much better than an outdoor setting. Certainly, being indoors has a more tense atmosphere. Anyway, during our discussions the idea for a hotel came up and that's what we chose. Of course, an ordinary hotel would be full of only bedrooms, so we created a fictious hotel with lots of interesting features. We progressed from this basic concept. PlayStation 28830024 3 0026 You start outside the hotel... CVG: What reference materials did you use to design the hotel? NAMCO: We visited a lot of hotels close to Tokyo, took photographs and collected pamphlets. These were used for the normal hotel sections. We also visited places not connected to hotels, for example factories, and took photographs there as well. We didn't just copy these places, we created our own original locations by taking elements from our different materials and arranging them together. ...moving into the main lobby. * FREE TO WANDER On the new mode's Stage One you have to get that lift to the casino. CVG:Where did you get the idea for the multi-route system? NAMCO: We wanted to emphasise the enjoyment of being able to play it again and again, but each time you can experience different excitement. We considered the inclusion of the route system from fairly early on in development. Without this system to distinguish it from the arcade mode, Time Crisis would have become just another PlayStation conversion plus alpha. We wanted to give it a new aspect. das 11.5636 OZ1593 FAC2H5OXO) There's even a parking lot... 3A But first you have to deal with those stinking 06 3B 3203 punks! 435 02 45743 Too slow, the door's shut. Now you have to take the stairs to the gallery. CVG: How is the multi-route system structured? NAMCO: There are eight areas in the hotel, Depending on the path taken, you must go through three or four of these areas to finish the game once. Usually it's four but there's one route with only three areas in it. ACTIO ONE : LASON And a ninja-filled crane room (?) 43.53 WAITER 26 2 5300 barem 4656 FEDO MEIRE CVG: How did you go about planning the multi-route system of the hotel stages? NAMCO: Your route through the hotel changes depending on the time it takes you to defeat the enemies and clear the stages. From the bottom to the top there are a lot of routes, both easy and difficult. We thought about each separate area, and the designers considered what would be best to make the routes as interesting as possible. When combining them to construct the hotel, we checked that the graphics were consistent with each other, to make sure they fitted together perfectly. It was a tough job. GRAPHICS CHIEF TARGETED! MR KOICHIRO MAEDA From the visual side, I'd like to say something about the special mode. With the multi-route system, the way of progressing through the game and the viewing angle are different. This means you can see, the same place in different ways, allowing you to enjoy a different kind of atmosphere for each place, each time you play. The atmosphere of the special mode has a lively taste to it with constant action all around you. 70 I 3620 SICS "

It's missing from the PS version though, so in issue #190 we weighed up the alternatives, spanning the gun's 'action' button, a steering wheel pedal, and your foot on the second joypad. The last rated the best, nearly matching the coin-op in our opinion, however the game's creators have a different opinion... 5420 H ISCHES CVG: What other new features does the PlayStation Mode have that aren't in the Arcade Mode? NAMCO: There's a wider variety of bosses. In the arcade version it's always people who appear and all the bosses are just people. However, in the special mode there are also mechanoid robots as well. This is a little different and offers new challenges to the players. Ducking plays a crucial role in hiding and reloading. * GRAPHICAL OVERLOAD! CVG: How important is the concept of hiding in Time Crisis? NAMCO: It's a fairly basic concept. In typical detective dramas and movies, the hero is always waiting for his chance to move against the enemy. Hiding in safety then taking a risk to appear and face the danger. This is the unique excitement of Time Crisis! 20ochana TIME EXTENDED 166 met WAIT! CVG: Some of the hotel areas are very huge. When you started development were you confident you'd be able to handle them? NAMCO: No, we weren't! (laughs). Really, we didn't have that much confidence but we had to try. In the end it came down to using various special graphical techniques. We concentrated on the parts you could see and made them look good, while the parts that you couldn't we just skipped over. The Hotel Lobby is a good example. The polygons appear across the entire screen at approximately the same level, so although it looks really wide, the number of polygons is much the same as any other area. Its size is misleading. It was our aim from the beginning to create very large areas. However, with the multi-route system we knew the players would pass through these areas again and again, and put all our efforts into creating them. CVG: Do you think that even without the pedal, Time Crisis As you duck you can shoot still retains its original baddies who've run out of view. appeal? NAMCO: It's true that without being able to press down on the pedal, Time Crisis isn't quite the same. However, the basic concept of hiding hasn't been lost, so it's not as if Time Crisis is no good without the pedal. Using the GunCon (for ducking) as opposed to the While hidden you can't shoot pedal, enables us to or see the moving baddies. reduce the price. 5693 4030 CVG: We've heard you don't recommend stepping on a joypad plugged into port 2? We think it's the best way to play! What do you think is the best way of simulating the arcade pedal with the Playstation? NAMCO: We recommend you use a driving peripheral with a steering wheel and pedal. This is much better to use than a joypad because it's been specifically designed to be stepped on, so it'll be more robust. QQQQQQQQQQQQQQ CVG: The graphics are a big leap forward for this type of game on the PlayStation. Are there any aspects you're particularly pleased about? NAMCO: The way we applied the shading is very elaborate. However, just because the lighting effects are very realistic with the light being scattered around, it doesn't mean the rays of light are being calculated in real time. We just applied the colour to the polygons one by one so it appears that they are being lit up or in the shadows. To calculate it all in real-time would be best, but we've done our best to make it look like it's been done in real time and the overall effect is very impressive. We're proud of this.

NAMCO: For the composition of the tunes we used a full-size, fully-synthesised orchestra. All of the elements of a real orchestra such as violin one, violin two etc were all mixed together in a recording studio, but with over 50 synthesised musical instruments we had to work very hard. Adjusting all their different speeds was fairly difficult. 2ND OPINION The simplest route takes 7min 30sec and the most challenging route takes 10min 25 sec. The average player will take about one minute more to finish each route.  ARCADE MODE  CVG: Are all the soundtracks for the PlayStation Mode new? NAMCO: Yes, they are all new tracks except for the initial entry through the hotel's front entrance which is taken from the original Time Crisis soundtrack. This way you get the feeling the music is flowing little by little from the original tunes to the new tunes. Absolutely awesome! That is the only way to describe Time Crisis.

The look and feel of the arcade version is captured perfectly and if you set up the foot pedal so you use your feet to reload, it works even better! I can only go on for so long about how good this is, and even though it may seem expensive, the GunCon is the best light gun on the market, so it's well worth buying it.

OVO OPINION CVG: How easy was it to include all the sound effects? Did it consume a lot of internal memory? NAMCO: There were a lot of sound effects, over 300 of them. To include them all took up a lot of space. For example, the footsteps you hear as you walk into the entrance lobby are different from the ones you hear later when you're in front of the elevator, because there's a carpet on the floor! Listen carefully and you can hear the difference. Of the 15 months spent on the overall game development, sound took about ten months of that. 41939 There are loads of time-saving techniques. Explosive crates are one such top tactic! I remember once saying I'd get a PlayStation if they brought out two games Time Crisis and Dirt Dash. My PlayStation arrived long ago, but now finally half my wish list is here! Time Crisis even beat my long time favourite game Virtua Cop in the arcades, and the PS conversion near enough matches it. The System 22 graphics (while slightly down-scaled) have been superbly reproduced and the razor-sharp gameplay remains undiminished. And with the PlayStation and Ranking modes it's a hugely addictive, home game. Plus, Namco have finally given the PlayStation the official light gun it deserves. I do have a few gripes the small shot area makes the game hard to begin with, I wish the gun had kick-back, and the UK version is slightly slower (giving Saturn V Cop the edge as the best UK home gun game). But these factors cannot stop this game being a High Five. And the fun is set to continue with the upcoming Gun Bullet. Now I'm just waiting for Dirt Dash! TOM GUISE SOUND CHIEF TARGETED! MR KOJI NAKAGAWA 6.3525 REVIEW WYCENEVE RATING Mr Koji Nakagawa: I was working on the sound. Everything from even the sound of the high-heeled, shoes has a cinematic feel. More than just tunes, the Time Crisis sound becomes true background music because we dedicated ourselves to creating Hollywood standard special effects. We pushed ourselves to put everything we could into this Playstation version, so you can really become the hero and enjoy yourself. Namco's greatest home conversion by far. A top gun game with an even better PlayStation-only mode, and a perfectly-tuned light gun. Bullseye! 73 "

The new characters initially seem as though they're not up to the standard of Ryu, Dhalsim, Chun Li and the rest, but start to grow on you before long-especially Skullo. Personally, I prefer Street Fighter Alpha 2 to EX but there are, many who feel differently. If you've ever enjoyed a Street Fighter game before, you'll love EX as it gives you a chance to learn loads of new techniques while still having some kind of competence from the start. And if you're someone who only plays 3D games, this is your entry into the phenomenon that is Street Fighter. Skullo-crushaaaah! ED LOMAS WIKKID BONUS GAMET THE BARREL GAME RETURNS! As you work through the Expert practice mode, coloured squares fill up with each successful combo. A bar on the right of the screen increases as you go, indicating the hidden fighters you've collected on the way. Eventually you'll notice a barrel, but it takes one hell of a lot of work to fill up but complete every single combo and you'll be rewarded with the fantastic barrel bonus game from Street Fighter 2 Giant barrels roll along shelves above your fighter and drop down waiting to be smashed before rolling off. Your challenge is to destroy as many as possible without letting any get away! It's certainly worth mastering your combos just to get the barrel game!

Konami have taken great effort to make sure Symphony maintains the storyline that's already transpired in previous installments, to such an extent that the action starts just before the conclusion of Castlevania IV. Four years after defeating Count Dracula, Richter Belmont has vanished. Castlevania, the home of Dracula which is rumoured to appear every hundred years, suddenly materialises. Richter is entrapped in the castle by the dark priest Shaft, who plans on resurrecting Prince Vlad back to the land of the living. Meanwhile, Marie Renard has entered the castle to search for her man Richter. Still following? Alucard has awoken from what was supposed to be eternal slumber, aware of the evil that has once again risen in his homeland. He has returned to the castle to confront his father.

Like its predecessor, PS Castlevania takes a while to get busy, but when it does the expe rience is hypnotic. The really great enemies start materialising around a third of the way into the first castle leaving you with another 170% of the game to deal with! That's when the game really goes for the throat. It's impressive how Konami have combined the best aspects of Nintendo's Super Metroid with their own expert character design, and knack for drama.

It starts off small, but before you know it you're addicted. I've always liked the Castlevania games, but this is something else. The animation of Alucard is stunning (screen shots do not do this game justice). Enemies become more extravagant and grotesque, and the music is simply perfect. The castle is large and full of secrets, yet you never get lost for long. The learning curve is superb, each ability gained allows for new territory to be charted. There is a little slow-down on some of the bigger bosses, but this doesn't spoil a thing. SOTN is an all-out assault on gaming excellence.

FORMULA 1 '97 O GRAND PRIX MODEM CO ARCADE MODE CO DELALOVERLOAD! To add to the realism of the game there are loads of tiny little details that are simply there for effect. One of the most practical new touches is that in Grand Prix mode your driver's visor gets dirty as the race goes on. When racing from the new in-car view you'll need to get rid of a tear-off every now and then by hitting the Triangle button to clear your view. One popular complaint of the first Formula 1 was that the Grand Prix mode wasn't detailed and realistic enough. This time around, there are more options which can be fiddled, along with more serious rules. If you drive dangerously chances are you'll get a black flag and instant disqualification! If you choose to play a full season, you go through each of the 17 real tracks in order with practice and qualification rounds before each one. The handling of the cars is more accurate as well, and a single mistake can be costly one wheel off the track will almost certainly cause you to spin. The menu screens are all designed to be as basic as possible, like most arcade games. You simply choose a car, then a difficulty. Each of the three difficulties has five courses to complete. If you finish a race well enough, you move on to the next. The cars handle very differently to the Grand Prix mode and powerslide all over the place like rally cars! Fast music plays to keep you on the edge of your seat all the time, racing to get to the next checkpoint before the timer runs out.

Even more exciting is if you're in the middle of a dry race and the sky starts darkening, ending up with a massive downpour!

Outside of the pits, \"You're right there, Murray\" is just about all you're likely to hear Martin Brundle say. 000H! IT'LL COST YA! The amount of detail in Formula 1 '97 is what really blows you away. The new touches such as the glowing brake discs don't really add to the way the game plays, but help a lot in terms of atmosphere. The graphics have been improved in some ways the higher resolution looks good and the car models are excellent but the pop-up has unfortunately got worse. Some bits of scenery appear very late and slightly ruin the feeling of being there. It's good that the Arcade and Grand Prix modes are very different this time round, but it's annoying to see that the computer cars stick to the road perfectly in Arcade while you powerslide across almost every corner you come to. Every PlayStation owner with an interest in motor racing will already own the first Formula 1, and will be waiting to find out what F1 '97 is like. It's definitely not different enough to make it worth buying as well as the first game unless you're a rich obsessive collector. If you're a racing fan in any way and don't have the first game get Formula 1 '97 immediately. V TOMAS Crashes in Formula 1 '97 are more impressive than they were in the first game, mostly down to the new car dynamics. Instead of just rotating when hit, the cars can be knocked slightly into the air and tipped up like the real thing. Going over the rumble strips makes the car tilt and shake, all adding to the realism. Also, the bodywork of the cars is created in a new way which shows damage all over. Collisions will often cause bits of your car to come off, but you now also need to worry about technical failures. If you push your brakes too hard over a race there's a good chance that they'll blow up in a puff of black smoke! Engine failures are also fairly common with the weaker teams, giving you more of a challenge. Very cool indeed.

Cruising through various ports, sinking rival ships while stealing their booty. Destroying all in your path and hobbling about on your wooden leg, as the parrot on your shoulder squawks \"Walk the plank\" in your ear. Give or take a few minor details this is exactly what Overboard!, the new action game from Psygnosis, is really like. You take control of a galleon on a quest to become ruler of the high seas, doing so by any means necessary: Capture a town by destroying its defences, and the skull and crossbones is hoisted up the flag-pole to signify a new ruler. Rescue dropped treasure to fill up the booty and dodge giant electric squids. This all adds up to another cool game for Psygnosis. 125 MAN OVERBOARD! PIECES OF FIVE? As you sail from town to town, picking off ships and turrets, you'll inevitably get set on fire by the enemy. This is bad news as it damages your ship, but this causes other problems too. While the vessel is roasting nicely, crew members try to save their lives by jumping overboard. For every person that evacuates the ship you lose a small chunk of health, however picking them up again replenishes that. You can also rescue other ships crew members who are floundering in the water to stock up on energy. This is a useful tactic to remember for multi-player mode, as you'll have a greater chance of survival this way. You have to be quick though, as seamen drown if they are left in the water for longer than ten seconds. Ahhhh! Top pirate action! Sling in a multi-tap, five mates and a similar amount of pads, and you have an awesome team battle sailing on the ocean waves! It's basically a Last Boat Floating Wins situation, set in specific deathmatch-style arenas.

CVG OPINION I have to say that I thought Overboard! was going to be another run-of-the-mill PlayStation game, but having sat down a played it thoroughly I have been proved very wrong. The five player mode works a treat, and you'll waste hours on it if you have the equipment. But the main game is what surprised me the most. You'd have thought the concept would be be pretty boring, but there is a lot of variety in the stages and they all progress equally in difficulty. Your path up to the first boss gets tougher and tougher, and some of the stages beyond him are rock hard. Just make sure you use that memory card! Overall, Overboard! is a top game. It's as simple as that. STEVE LES MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE REVIEW Pressing L1 calls up your map, which is of vital importance if you're going to complete the stages quickly. It shows the location of all the towns you have gained control of, and the location of the bottles. These bottles not only give you another piece to the level map, but the level cannot be completed if you do not collect all of them. Once the final jar has been rounded up, the exit appears on the map. RATING BATING It's tough in single player, but still good fun. In multi-player it excels. Overboard! shows that there are still original ideas to be plundered. 81 "

Basically G-Police is a combat flight simulation with you at the controls of what is essentially a super advanced helicopter. You are thrown into a criminally controlled environment and told to bring law and order. Consisting of 35 increasingly difficult missions, the game is large. And with a high level of enemy artificial intelligence it's clever too. An amazing intro sequence and incredible in-game graphics makes sure G-Police looks good. In short this game has it in spades.

The HAVOC is a vector-thrust gunship, much like helicopters of today, but without the rotors. By the year 2097 the Havoc is reaching the end of its service life, but is still the best craft for the time being. Armed with all manner of weapons, starting with 30mm Vulcan cannon, homing missiles and cluster rockets. this baby packs a punch. As you progress through the levels new weapons are added to the craft. On offer are laser and plasma cannons, varying bombs and an electromagnetic pulse weapon which can disable other craft. Although the controls of the Havoc may take getting used to, by the fifth level you're buzzing between buildings like a pro. You are Jeff Slater, ace pilot. Your job is to maintain law and order on the off-world colony of Callisto. After a bitter inter-colony war, Earth's government has been deposed by the big corporations, who reluctantly fund independent police forces. A subtle in-joke places the game in the year 2097. Callisto colony consists of 51 domed cities, linked by inter-connecting tunnels. The domes contain skyscrapers, office blocks, factories and spaceports, plus the millions of inhabitants who live and work here. All this information is expertly revealed in a stunning full-motion video intro sequence which is as long as it is incredible, including the most realistic motion capture yet.

Starting with scanning vehicles, protecting ground teams and engaging in aerial dogfights with attacking fighters, you soon progress to tailing other craft, destroying rogue robots and more. There's loads of variety and each mission is very different. Later levels see you accompanied by a wingman in a second HAVOC craft. Here you are offered much needed assistance, plus you get to order your partner around. Luckily a 3D radar at the top of the screen shows you where the next objective is on each mission. With the aid of this you'll never get lost. PlayStation When firing upon other craft try not to shoot buildings. As they can be damaged too.

We nicked these two joyriders for speeding. 29% CVG OPINION FA A game of this type on a console is unheard of. Even on a PC it's going to be special. G-Police is the type of game that you think are ten-a-penny. Yet when you play it, you realise there really hasn't been anything quite like it before. Closest comparisons would be a PC helicopter simulation. The dark environments allow Psygnosis to get away with a very restricted view, which is really the game's only flaw. Yet at the same time it makes the game much tougher, plus they've also included an option to increase the view angle at a cost to game speed. They really have thought of everything. Beautiful to look at, excellent to play and a very involving and tough challenge. G-Police is one of the best PlayStation shoot 'em ups I've experienced, and well worth getting. ALEX 4WATALA Bellowing smoke, this craft is on its last legs. One more carefully placed shot and he'll be gone.

"computer video games YOU REQUIRE THE MYSTIC PANTS OF CHARROKNOS ROM Although Hexen 2 uses an enhanced version of the Quake engine, it plays quite differently. For a start, the adventure is a lot more open you don't play through one level then move onto the next. Instead, many levels are linked together in a big \"hub\" and you can move backwards and forwards between them as you want. Often you need to collect items from one level and take them to another to progress, which adds a lot of depth to the game. Also, each of these sections isn't just a blast from start to finish there are lots of puzzles and problems to solve in order to progress. For example, in the very first part of the game included in the free demo on the internet) you need to mix a potion to turn a mithril wall into a destructible wooden one. For the potion you need to find the tomb of Loric, collect his bones, take them to the windmill, grind them to dust, then take them to the mixing chamber and make the potion! The puzzles get more and more elaborate as the game goes on! DED! 02 94 Pestilence rides on a giant boar and is surrounded by a swarm of hornets! 2ND OPINION The Mummies keep going even when their arms and legs have been shot right off! Blimey! Hexen 2 is *#!*% awesome! was disappointed by the original Hexen, but this is far, far superior to its predecessor. The look and feel of this is nothing like Quake, which does even more to make Hexen the separate brand that it has now become. The first sample of H2 I got was in a co-operative with Ed. Three hours later we were working as an awesome partnership with immensely powerful characters. Earning your new weapons is also a good thing, as you actually have to play to reap the rewards. I would advise you all to buy this, play together with some mates and have a team against the computer. It is an unrivalled experience and one that must make the Quake 2 team poo their pants. STEVE teg 094 DES 1 Putting the red gem in front of this giant snake statue brings it to life! It swings about firing venom from its fangs! HEXEN I CVG OPINION DED 093 1 Here you are outside the forge at the stables. A dead man's notes mentioned a buried key somewhere near here. I've always enjoyed Heretic and Hexen, just because they were a pleasant change from playing Doom all the time. This time around it's a lot more than that. Hexen 2 stands alone as a magnificent game, rather than just being \"Quake with a crossbow\" like the other games. The addition of experience points which increase your character's abilities as you go through the game really makes you want to stick at the game, and makes your choice of class more important. The graphics are fantastic, especially on 3Dfx, with astounding level design and smooth enemies. The multiplayer deathmatches aren't as good as Quake's, but the special items (especially the sheep!) provide lots of laughs. Instead, the best way to play with friends is in co-operative mode, working together as a team with different strengths and weaknesses. Whether you're a fan of Quake or not, you'll find that Hexen 2 is one of the best things you'll play on the PC at the moment. You can also guarantee that it's going to take off on the internet almost as much as Quake did. Unfortunately, it's another one of those games you're going to have to buy. Sorry.

"computer video games MOKD 7 MWHION MK 4 has finally hit the arcades after months of rumours, speculation, and hype. Does it live up to the legacy?  Midway Games MUKTAI ULKOI 14 KOMBAT  WRIS NMEN THE  MORE, MORE, WE WANT MORE.... MORTAL KOMBAT NUMBER FOUR ortal Kombat 4 might be one of the most anticipated arcade games ever, taking the everpopular fighting series into two brave new worlds: weapons and 3D. As it turns out, neither one is as dramatic a change as originally anticipated. The 3D textured polygons and camera effects don't alter the basic 2D game engine, and the weapons merely supplement without overpowering the familiar gameplay. MK 4 is really more of the same game: great new characters, new Fatalities and secrets, awesome new stages, ridiculously funny new voices... but the Kombat essentials are fairly unchanged. Version 1.0 is far too glitchy and unfinished for a final judgment, but here's what we know so far. MK 4's most radical new feature is the weapons system. It's certainly as hyped as the Parries in Street Fighter III, or the sidestep in Tekken 3. Each character has a vicious tool of death-dealing mayhem, such as an axe, staff, hammer, or sword, which can be whipped out anytime with a simple controller motion. The weapon attacks simply substitute for most of your normal punches, although each is different with up to six different swings. The weapon-play is straightforward. Don't expect any Soul Blade style deflects or breaks. You can, however, steal the opponent's weapon if you knock it from their hands! Weapons do considerably more damage than normal attacks, so although they're generally slow, they are worth the effort. While most of the weapons are for hand-to-hand fighting, the crossbow is the exception; it shoots projectiles either straight or at an angle. Unfortunately you can't put a weapon away once it's been drawn, which can be annoying if you only want to use it for a quick swipe. VINS:09 JAREK WINS: 00 | QUAN CHI WINS:00 KAT WINS: 00 RAIDEN WINS:02 FUJIN VINS: 00 LIU KANG Some of the most popular classic Mortal Kombat backgrounds are back, only in 3D! Although it's really no different from blocking with bare hands, blocking a weapon with another weapon is kool, as it kauses a massive shower of sparks! Fujin's crossbow, though slow on the reload time, is the perfect tool for cheap players who like to keep opponents on the other side of the screen all day. WINS: 01 SCORPION WINS: 00 SONYA WINS:03 TANYA WINS: 00 REPTILE 10-30 ARCADE Scorpion cuts Sonya with a very long, very sharp knife...sword, really. As you can see, the weapons cause large amounts of blood to be spilled. When the opponent's holding their weapon, hit them with almost any attack and they'll drop their arm like a dolt. Then it's up for grabs! MIDWAY 90 "


"PUSH START POSH START BLOOD IN 3D?! compute vided games QUY Y CHI M N S ) FAT ALT So, just how do blood, guts, and random body parts look in 3D? Terrific! Powered by the new Zeus hardware, MK 4's graphics are texturemapped polygons with amazing detail. Few Fatalities seemed to be implemented in version 1.0, but the ones I was lucky enough to witness including Sub-Zero's original head-and-spine-pull, and the all-new fan stage slice-and-dice death restored much of the bleeding edge lustre that was dampened by the watered-down cheese whiz Fatals from MK 3 (nothing induces boredom faster than arcade machines being dropped from the sky or a giant foot stomping the opponent). The fan stage Fatality chops the victim into a bloodbath of dismembered limbs, then rockets their severed skull right into the screen! I've heard of \"head-cam,\" but this is ridic. PUSH START SUB ZERO WINS Though not related to a Fatality, this horrific screen is what you'll see if you decide not to continue playing after defeat. A good argument to keep pumping in pence eh? Sub-Zero's old-skool Fatality is BACK, baby! Sub rips off the victim's head, spinal cord still attached, and holds the mess up for all the world to see. PUSH START REPNICE NOOA SAAD 3D EFFECTS IN A 20 WORLD Don't let the new 3D appearances fool ya, MK 4 is still the same 2D game as its predecessors. In fact, rarely does it stick the 3D aspect in your face; the most noticeable occasions are for major hits such as a Roundhouse kick, when you execute one of the new \"Limb Break\" attacks, or for a win pose. When events such as these occur, the camera pans around for a rotational view of the action. This has little effect on gameplay, other than occasionally putting dropped weapons out of reach. While it generally stays within 2D confines, MK 4's graphics are nothing short of superb. Effects such as the \"real-time rain and lighting!\" in Raiden's war platform stage, the hovering light sources in the fan stage, and the multi-shifting planes of prison cells in Goro's dungeon have me convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt: Midway's got it goin' on! Don't get me wrong. MK 4 doesn't come close to Tekken 3 in terms of pure 3D muscle (no replays, far fewer camera changes), and the characters don't seem to move as fluidly, but the detail is still mighty impressive. MORE, MORE, WE WANT MORE... MORTAL KOMBAT NUMBER FOUR Noob Saibot's a hidden playable character who appears in the intro demo fights.

"computer Video games \"GET MY LASAGNE.\" KEEPIN' THE SPIRIT ALIVE Aside from the new weapon system, changes to the action are few and far between. The biggest tweak is the virtual removal of MK 3's infamous dial-akombo system in MK 4, the max is two ground hits (into a possible special move) and it's the same for every character. Another change is the removal of the traditional jump kick-High Punch-any move corner kombos the High Punch now pushes you too far away. Every character now has a second throw (a limb breaker) and the basic set of attacks has been tweaked here and there. For instance, Roundhouse Kicks now do more damage than Uppercuts. However, most of these changes are small, so if you were good at previous MKs you'll kick ass on this one. If not, well, may death become you. WINS: 00 RAILEN WINS: 00 REPTILE NAKDX 7 7WHOK What am I talking about? MK4's crazed voice samples, of course! While Raiden's \"Ikabobalay,\" \"Your mother's from L.A.\" and \"Get back in the car!\" samples from previous MKs were hilarious, nothing, nothing can prepare you for the nonstop insanity found in MK 4. While, disappointingly, not every character has their own unique voices (many of the male characters share samples), this game represents a vast improvement over previous MKs in terms of quantity and humour value. There are literally dozens of voices this time, for all types of different situations, and they're a total riot. Some almost make sense: the generic male cry \"Oooh, I'm gonna throw you over there!\"). Some are utter nonsense: Sonya's incomprehensible rambling when she does her Vertical Bike Kick. My favourite ones, however, lie somewhere inbetween you can sort of make out what they're saying, but not quite, and you're forced to guess, in the tradition of Raiden's screams from past MKs when he did his superfly move. For instance, \"Get my lasagne!\" is my best guess at Quan Chi's cry when he does the teleport stomp, and \"Oh! My Bride!\" is my only possible interpreta tion of one of Tanya's numerous horrified screams when she takes a vicious hit such as uppercut. Nothing is more entertaining than trying to figure out what these boneheads are saying. Try it, it's like a fun little mini-game! On the subject of sounds, MK 4's music and sound effects are excellent, and the voice actor is as evilsounding as he's always been, if not more so. Fortunately, there's no problem understanding what he's saying. WINS:12 WINS: 00 SUB-ZERO TANYA 1 Remember those krazed High Punch Raiden puts the hurt on Reptile with korner juggle kombos? Well, forget one of the new limb break throw attacks. about 'em in MK 4! WINS:07 LIU KANG WINS: 00 SHINNOK (WINS:07 LIU KANG WINS: 00 SHINNOK MORE, MORE, WE WANT MORE... MORTAL KOMBAT NUMBER FOUR 1 A quick two hits is all you'll get if you start madly tapping attack buttons at close distance. No more six-hit morse kode kombos here! MORTAL BUGFEST NUMBER FOUR Just try and figure out what these wackos are saying! You won't succeed, but you'll have fun trying. GETMY LASAGNE Midway are building up a well-deserved reputation for releasing glitchy, inkomplete Mortal Kombat games. For instance, Kombat veterans will remember how early versions of MK 2 and MK 3 had crash bugs caused by various Fatality commands. MK 4's current release, version 1.0, is an absolute mess, and while crash bugs have yet to rear their ugly heads, it's still arguably the most bugridden, unfinished arcade game ever released. The biggest glitch is the frequent and annoying habit of player 2's block button to simply not work. This is especially noticeable during matches against Quan Cheap, er, Quan Chi; he can teleport stomp against player 2 almost with impunity. In brief, other bugs include mysterious graphic breakup, the computer's occasional knack for getting back up even after being defeated, the seemingly random ability of one player or the other to attack even before the round has actually started, and a strange glitch which can trap the player in the corner behind the wall. Not only this, but the current version lacks a \"final boss\" encounter (it's unclear whether Shinnok will be the last boss, but smart money says he won't be, with Goro at the top of the candidate list), endings are of course nowhere to be found, and according to sources, few of the Fatalities have yet to be included. Stay on the lookout for a new version, which should hopefully be out by the time you read this with substantially crisper, cleaner, more komplete gameplay. By the way, we added the lasagne ourselves. It's not really in the game. WINS: 00 SOO SELEVEU FUTTER GROUP SELECT ARCADE  4 expands the \"Choose Your Destiny\" system with five different difficulty paths, each one containing four different variations! However, play to the end of any of these paths in version 1.0 and you're sole reward is a text message: \"Good Job!\" Notice how Quan Chi (on the right) is sort of \"inside\" the wall? Well, that's because he is! One of the many cute glitches in version 1.0. for YOU. Another aspect of the incomplete version, Group Battle mode is not yet properly working, and if you look closely you can see that Noob Saibot's picture is where Jarek is supposed to be. MASTER 92 "


"WINS: 00 RAIDEN WINS: 00 QUAN CHE compute vided games RETURNINE FIBILE  MK 4 brings back six of the most popular powermongers from previous versions: Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Raiden, Liu Kang, Sonya, and Reptile. Overall, they are largely unchanged. If anything they seem to have lost moves. SubZero still has his Slide, Iceball, and a severely weakened Ice Clone, but his Ice Shower is gone. Scorpion's Spear and Teleport are still around, but his Leg Grab's been cut. Liu Kang retains all of his moves. Sonya is blessed with a new, extremely useful Cartwheel Kick. Finally, Reptile's been hurt the worst while his Acid Spit's range has been increased into a drenching shower, his Forceball is nowhere to be found. Let's hope some of these moves come back in the next revision! WINS: 11 SONY WINS: 00 SHINNOK WINS: 00 SCORPION WINS: 002 SUR-ZERO 1 Sonya shows off here ridiculously useful new cartwheel kick. Reptile can now shower his opponents with a spray of acid, and the move can be repeated easily for a nasty keep out tactic. The popular stand-bys return with most of their klassic moves intact, such as Sub-Zero's Iceball and Raiden's Superfly. NEW KOMBATANTS ( BM || || || ||| MK 4's new warriors, overall, are a much better-designed lot than the group we got in MK 3. Now, some players may have enjoyed that line-up, but to me the robots and Woody Harrelson look-alike cop in particular just DIDN'T FIT THE THEME, okay? You got a problem with that? These guys are all dark, mysterious, evil-looking, and appropriate to the Mortal Kombat mood. SELECT YOUR FIGURE My favourite new warrior, he has the lift-up power of Kitana and then some. He can bust you into the air with a ground fireball, rain a fireball down on your head, or fly through the air with an ascending Wave Punch. In a very unique manoeuvre, he can also \"switch fighting modes\" by running around on his arms and attacking with all kicks. In this style the pirate is ultra fast and able to land leg throws, but very vulnerable because he can't block. This maniac (fondly known as \"Quan Cheap\") looks like a cross between Uncle Fester and a Harley biker, and you can't miss him as his ugly mug's plastered all over the side of the cabinet. His moves include a teleport stomp that takes Sheeva's old move to a new level of cheapness, a skull projectile, and the ability to telepathically steal the opponent's weapon. For pure entertainment, nothing beats using Tanya, as she has more voices than any other character. Her moves include a ground fireball, an air fireball reminiscent of Sindel, and a flip kick. She is a scantily clad, amazon-lookin' warrior. MORE, MORE, WE WANT MORE... MORTAL KOMBAT NUMBER FOUR WINS:03 WINS: 00 Z10 KANG LAN CHI WINS: 00 RAIDEN WINS:06 TANYA WINS: 00 SONYA SHINNOK 0 WINS: 03 QUAN CHI WINS: 00 TILKANA In MK 4's story, Raiden talks of an ancient battle against the evil overlord Shinnok, which caused the death of an entire civilisation and predated even the conflicts with Shao Kahn. Now Shinnok is back and looking to conquer Earth. Surprisingly though Shinnok seems to be the central figure of MK4's story. He's an immediately selectable character, and might not be the last boss (hard to tell since there are no endings yet). He has no special moves of his own, but he can impersonate any of the other characters for a limited time much like Shang Tsung's morph techniques. GI JAREK G It's hard to describe this rugged. individual, but he reminds me of some kind of hardy lumberjack. He only has two moves, and that's all he needs: a Kano-like rolling spin attack, and a Jax-like ground stomp. This effeminate, mystical fighter relies on aerial attacks and his ability to control the wind. He can lift you up from a distance on a gust of air, then slam you to the ground and bounce you over his head (setting up any number of juggie kombos). He also employs a rapid Vacuum Spin and a dive kick, both throwbacks to Kung Lao's moves. FINISHING MOVE WINS:05 WINS: 00 SHINNOK CHINNOK WINS:09 MAREK WINS: 00 QUAN CHI WINS: 08 FUJIN WINS: 00 TANYA sem If Midway want us to take MK 4 seriously, they'd better patch this puppy up (and quickly). I'll reserve final judgment until then, and view this version as what it is a work in progress. For fans of the series, this version just might reignite arcade Mortal mania all over again!

The development team used military gun catalogues from America to help them in their research and in June they went to America to actually fire some of them as well. One example of this realism is depicted in the grenades. Even after you've pulled the safety pin out of the grenade you can still keep moving about until you throw it. New team members include ex-soldiers who are giving invaluable advice on military tactics and the latest hi-tech weaponry available 3 01:07: 64 2013 (*00:40:00 Explosions are commonplace in Metal Gear.

"omputer Video ames SEBAGO NOIS INBRAZIT one o o o o o o * Television ads, press conferences, interviews and a completely new outlook on the way Sega run their business. All is answered on this page. SEGA CRUMPET GALOREI TOTTY AT THE VERY TOP OF THE PECKING ORDER ext time you venture into your local store to buy a Saturn game and all you come across is row upon row of PlayStation games, spare a thought for the people of Brazil. The Megadrive is still the driving force behind Tec Toy (the distributor of Sega games), and even the Master System still has a large amount of money making potential. The Saturn is available to the public, but having only just dropped in price to US$399 from the original price of $899 a shot, they're not exactly flying off the shelves. This may make the situation sound bleak, which it is far from, as Tec Toy are a booming company at the moment. But when you consider some of those facts, then the hundred quid you can now pick a UK Saturn up for doesn't sound so bad. This is a regular sight on Steve's private beach, just off his multi million pound mansion. Oh and you might see it in Rio as well. LIFE ON THE OTHER SIDE: CVG LOOKS AT SEGA BRAZIL! The Rio Palace hotel is situated on the Copacabana beach front. That means... ...that views like this are commonplace from the hotel. You won't get that at Butlins. SEGA IN BONDAGE SHOCKER! WHITE With the Saturn needing a new kick up the butt to get the gamers going Brazil nuts over Daytona, Virtua Fighter et al. Tec Toy have put into action their huge new marketing strategy. Three commercials are going to be broadcast from the 28th September for two weeks, and already you're probably wondering we're telling you this. Well our very own Mr. Key is starring in one of them! The commercial, which will only be aired in Brazil features our Steve turning an incredibly fat woman from a maid into a leather clad bondage gal and finally into a leather chair. And all because she disturbed him playing Daytona! Doh! RIO PALACE HOTEL 12! 12! WHAT'S THE STORY? The Master System was released in Brazil in 1989 and since then, understandably, has picked up a huge installed base. So MS games are guaranteed sellers. The Megadrive is Tec Toy's biggest selling console so far this year, and the games are priced quite well at US$50 and only US$35 for Master System games. These translate as roughly  and  respectively, about the same sort of price you can pick them up over here. But with Saturn games still commanding a high price tag, the chances of immediate success are slim. Just count yourselves lucky when you walk into a shop and see Saturn games for . Because it doesn't happen in Brazil. 98 This statue is called Corcovado and is one of the most famous tourist sights in Rio. "
