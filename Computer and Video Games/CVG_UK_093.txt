"REVIEW () JAMES BO ENCE LICENCE 10 KILL After nearly a two-year absence from the Cinemas, that evergreen secret agent, 007 James Bond, returns to the silver screen with a vengeance in Licence to Kill. It promises to be one of the most spectacular Bond films yet, with a dazzling array of stunts and special effects. As with the last two Bond films, Domark have secured the rights to produce a game of the time and it's looking good. Very On Paul Glancey sharksreview On the first level, Bond chases after a jeep in a helicopter with the intention of blasting it off the road. Sounds easy, but you must watch out for tall landscape features which the chopper can crash into! LICENCE TO KILL distinct gas which allow and the end of the stage LICENCE 10 KILL of Qulckly Band shoots one of the pontoon with his harpoon gun and he's dragged after it. His progress up the line towards the plane is slowed by having to dodge oncoming catamarans piloted by terrorist yachtsmen. Reach the plane and you're onto the third stage, which follows the destruction of Sanchez's drug factory. The bad guy is making for the border in a convoy of 18-wheeler semis full afdrugs lames startsina cropduster, but he has to jump down onto the rearmost truck, take control of it and use it to With the jeep destroyed, Bond wanders up the vertically scrolling screen blasting an army of baddies with his Beretta. Luckily he can even the odds by finding an Uzi machine pistol! CENCE The action start over Gray Cay, an island off the coast of Miami with 007 and Felix Lalter flying a coastguard helicopter while Sanchez makes his escape up the screen in a jeep. Shooting the jeep is the only way to stop him, but accurate blasting is difficult when you have to simultaneously dodge around tall trees, telegraph poles and buildings. Sanchez eventually has to leave thelsenso he's forced to legit But James follows Commando style with his Beretta ready to pick off the Sanchez hordes. By holding the fire button and pushing left or right on the joystick, you can select one of 32 directions of fire, chen run up the screen, gun blazing Dead Sanchezites leave behind extra rounds of ammo, and the odd machine gun to aid the 007 cause, At the end of the level Bond has to climb back into the helicopter to pursue his foe, who has just leapt into an aeroplane To stop the plane, Bond has to swing below the chopper and jump on to the tail of the dodging plane, disable it, then attacha rope so that it can be towed to the coast The scene then changes to the ocean. James is in his scuba gear, and he has to swim through shark-infested waters, stabbing any of Sanchez's divers who dare challenge him, and grabbing drugs | CENCE TO KILL Level three sees Bond hanging off a chopper, attempting to attach a winch to the tail of the baddie's plane. Time Isn't on your side, you have to move fast to stop the plane from escaping. 012 "


"REVIEW BOND 007E TO KILL IIIIIIIII THE BOND GAMES ... Domark's first Bond licence, A View to a kill, appeared way back in 1985, and received little acclaim. Well, it was pretty grotty-even Domark admit that -and featured four levels of naff arcade action with primary school graphics. The tune was quite good, though.... Things got a bit better with Domark's second Bond licence, the 1987 release, The Living Daylights. The gameplay was limited, but fairly enjoyable, and featured Bond wandering along a horizontally scrolling backdrop taking pot-shots at baddies. It was fun, but the general reaction was that more could have been made of the game. Last Christmas saw the third of the 007 series, Live and Let Die, the game of the early 70's Bond film. The film features a lengthy boat chase, and it's this scene that the game is based on. It's a fast-action shoot 'em up, almost like Roadblasters on water, with you whizzing down a neverending river in a speed boat, avoiding obstacles and blasting other craft out of the water. It's a tough and enjoyable game, but didn't really feature Bond as such... And that brings us bang up to date with Licence to Kill, which certainly looks like the best Bond game yet! We'll bring you a full appraisal of the game in the next issue of C4VG. run the others off the road, dodging missiles which they fire in your direction.

This psycho-blast from Tony Crowther turns your subconscious fears into laser fodder, and uses them to drive you completely crazy! Phobia is a one or two-player horizontally-scrolling rescue mission set in the sort of solar system your mother always warned you about. Fifteen planets lie between your spaceship and your ultimate goal, the sun. That's where the Galactic Emperor is being held by Lovely and colourful level two.

If you opt for one priced .99. . . player mode, a press of the space bar gives your ship a double, which doubles your field of fire, but makes you a bigger target. If you do play with someone else, shooting the rear of his ship charges up his super-weapon, which launches up to three unstoppable missiles across the screen. Phobia's most vaunted technical innovation is the use of colour switching techniques to display 32 colours on the C64 (which is only designed to provide 16). However Tony does it, it's an effective trick which has been used to make the sprites and backdrops very pretty to look at as they scroll past. Not that there's much chance to admire the scenery, though. Swarms of monsters appear from all angles, and even gamers with the most turbo-charged reactions will have their hands full dodging bullets and the scenery. The collision detection is often in your favour, but still the game is no picnic.

"AMIGA REVIEW WIIIIIIII atastorm is basically a 16 bit version of Dropzone, US Gold's classic Defender/Stargate variant, with some brilliant enhancements (incidentally, Dropzone is my alltime favourite blaster). So although VDT score zero points for originality, what they have BY VDT The best blast ever? AVASTORM appear, and they get increasingly vicious and fire more accurate bullets — your reflexes are tested to their absolute limits. The graphics are very fast and smooth, with small and detailed alien sprites and loads of stuff going on. The whole game is beautifully presented, with autosave highscore table, brilliant onscreen instructions, level/speed select and four different player options. Datastorm's lasting appeal is immense It's the sort of game that never ages, and will get loaded up years from now for a good old nostalgic blast. The levels are never the same, and you're not constrained by having to follow patterns like you do in most other horizontally scrolling blasters It's just you in the thick of it. You might know how to deal with the aliens, but you don't know just where they're going to pop up next. There may be shoot 'em ups that look and sound more impressive, but when it comes to sheer adrenalin-pumping superfast action gameplay, Datastorm blows everything out of the water. JULIAN RIGNALL produced, in my opinion, is the best shoot 'em up yet seen out of a coin-op cabinet. Either one or two players (there are options to let two players partake simultaneously, or alternately) patrol a two-way horizontally scrolling wrap-around planet and protect eight pods from a wide variety of weird and very violent aliens. One particular breed of alien, the landers, attempt to pick up the pods and whisk them away to the top of the screen, whereupon they go berserk and home in on your craft at very high speed, firing very accurate laser bolts as they go. To help you keep a track on C+VG HIT! ship Fast, slick and playable. Just kill everything! things, there's a radar scanner at the bottom of the screen. The player's ship is armed with lasers, five smart bombs and a limited cloaking device which makes it invincible (a bar at the bottom of the screen shows how much shield is left). Extra shields are awarded after each level, and an extra life and smart bomb are given for every 10,000 points scored. Extra weapons are available by picking up orbs which occasionally appear.

BAAL * An addictive mixture of strategy and arcade action featuring: * 8 way ultra-smooth scrolling through 3 distinctive domains containing multiple levels. + Over 250 highly detailed screens, superb graphics and sound effects. * More than 100 monsters and 400 traps. The future of the world lies in the hands of an elite squadron of men. YOU are the leader of the Time Warriors. Can you save the earth from the evil BAAL? His army of undead have stolen an awesome weapon of destruction, a War Machine. As leader of the ultimate battle fighters, your quest is to invade BAAL's domain, fighting off his monstrous demonic beasts to retrieve the War Machine ... but... you must kill BAAL in the process Can you succeed? There is no option ... the alternative is literally 'Hell on Earth. Screen Shots from the C64 Format CAPTAIN FIZZ Meets The Blaster-Trons The message is simple: co-operate or die! It's double fun and double trouble all the way in Captain Fizz, the most exciting simultaneous twoplayer game you and a friend are ever likely to play It's a whole new world of split-screen, high-speed action, as both of you take on the nasty BlasterTrons infesting the planet Icarus. Yup, it's a tough mission alright, but you might just win out with the right blend of co-operation, courage, laser-hot reflexes, tactical sense...and brains. The action is fast and furious in Captain Fizz, but if you can't work out theright tactics you'll both be dead meat. There are 20 levels of savage and relentless action to battle through before you reach your objective, the central computer that's causing the evil infestation. You'll never get there, though, unless you put your heads together and co-operate: your buddy can't do it on his own, and neither can you This is one program where even the easy games are hard. So remember united you stand, but divided you fall. The planet Draconia, an unnatural planet, has been formed over many centuries by six of the most feared rulers that have ever existed. These rulers, exiled from their home galaxy, have ravaged and plundered space, using the worlds they have destroyed and the life forms they have created to build this planet of fear and death. Now an end must be put to their reign of terror. A large scale attack will prove too costly to our space fleets, Draconia has many orbiting defence systems, the sacrifice may be in thousands of lives. A single fighter craft approaching undetected may have a chance to avenge those who have perished, by destroying Draconia.

Just look at Virus, gives us Bruce Springsteen Elite, Starglider II and quality sound (simple, dull and Mercenary for example. utterly boring).

"ARCADES AME TIPS WIMMITTIMIZ HARD DRIVIN TA FINISH Atari's new driving game is taking the arcades by storm and it's easy to see why. Fabulous, fast, filled-3D graphics and ultra-realistic controls make for the most convincing and thrilling driving game yet seen in the arcades. Because of the highly authentic nature of the gameplay (we're talking counter-steering, optional four-gear manual gear shift with clutch and utterly realistic car handling amongst other things) many first-time players find the going very tough indeed. But never fear. Self-confessed Hard Drivin' expert Julian Rignall is here to give you a definitive guide to both the stunt and speed tracks. SPEED Z CHECK on the COUSB Complete the track to the inst RPM ACOPE LAF TIDE 1:21:03 DEL 1:43:00 irst of all, choose the auto both directions on the highway -50 option. The manual gear shift is make sure you look ahead before you very tricky to get used to and pull out, and beware hidden dips and you should only attempt this when blind bends. you have mastered the game with If you want to be a good Hard auto. And it's still very tough even Driver, you have to get used to using then! the whole road AND verges. Don't Right now you're ready to go. be afraid to drive off the track to Make sure the steering wheel is avoid oncoming cars -just make central (otherwise you'll slew the car sure you get back onto the road as soon as you start), put the gear quickly before you lose speed. shift into any position (other than Mastering counter steering is reverse), turn the key and put your absolutely essential.

STUNT TRACK his is definitely the most enjoyable of the two tracks, with its brilliant bridge leap and loop-the-loop. From start position A, put your foot to the floor and belt up the hill. About three quarters of the way up, brake down to about 60 and slide round the bend. As you come out of the bend, straighten and head down the hill towards the bridge. The car jumps over the brow of the hill, so don't accelerate or you'll nose-dive the car. As soon as the car is safely on terra firma, accelerate towards the bridge at top speed. Stay on your side of the road, as a lorry always jumps the bridge BERT :00 D 028 "


"AME TIPS WWIIIIIIII AMSTRAD DRAGON NINJA SPEED ESSE START PONT \"NT TACK (E), braking to 60 as you go over the top. Go through the checkpoint at top speed and burn towards the banked section of road (F). A speed limit sign says 40, but only girlie nancies take the banked section at that snails pace. Accelerate to at least 120 through the bend but make sure that the car is straight as you exit this section onto the flat track, or you'll spin. From here on it's foot to the floor stuff-use the whole track, and watch out for oncoming traffic. If something is approaching and you're on the wrong side of the track, just move off the right hand side of the road and speed past it on the verge. If you're speeding on your side of the road and there's a slow car, just overtake it on the inside. With practice, you can do both these manoeuvres without slowing down. Finally, slide and countersteer around the long bend, and you'll cross the finish line and get extra time. If you get a fast enough lap time, when your time limit finally expires, the Phantom Photon challenges you to one lap of the stunt track. No other cars are present all you have to do is make sure you don't crash, or spend more than ten consecutive seconds off the track. If you use the above tactics, you should be able to beat him his weak spot is that he always goes off the track at the hairpin (C), allowing you to overtake. ma is the hst D ussed BHtended 80 100120 Okay, all you Dragon Ninjaites. Read these tips from Tom Godfrey of Blackpool Lancs, and you'll be able to conquer the game. The baddies on levels one, two, four, five, seven and eight are easily defeated. When one approaches, simply hit him one, duck as he jumps over you, turn and hit him again, and keep repeating this procedure until he dies. Piece of cake... Level three is a bit on the tricky side, but the best tactic is to keep fighting until you get to the first hole, jump into the sewer and wade your way along until the end of the level the baddies won't be able to get you, but you'll be able to kill them. At the end of the level, stay on sewer level and make mincemeat out of the multiplying Ninja again, he won't be able to touch you. On levels five and six, keep your head down and watch out for throwing stars, and only move when it's clear (that's a bit obvious innit?). Be careful not to fall off the train on level five, or your game is as good as over. The baddie at the end of level six is well hard, and the only way you can safely dispose of him is to use very well-timed flying kicks. A final note, always collect time capsules or you'll only have two minutes to complete level eightand that's next to impossible. SPEED TRACK from the opposite direction as Now accelerate towards the you approach (B), Brake down loop (D). A slow-moving car is to 65 just as you approach the blocking the way here if jump to leap the bridge safely. you're doing well and can Any faster and the car nose-dives. overtake it before you hit the You're now approaching the loop, do so. If it looks like the car tightest corner on the track (C), will beat you to the loop, stick which should be taken at behind it. There's always a lorry between 40 and 45. There's no on the other side of the road, so oncoming traffic here, so use the keep your eye out for it. width of the road to slide around Accelerate through the loop at the bend. top speed and head up the hill his is the track to practice on, and also it's great fun if you just want to burn up the highway. It's very straightforward stuff-just use the width of the road tactic as you would at the end of the stunt track. There are only two things to watch out for: corner G and long b end H, G should be taken at around 55, and you should brake to 60 before and accelerate gently through it to reach about 75-80 as you exit — then go hell for leather for the finish.

"REVIEWST AMIGA PC IIIIIIIIII \"he sky is blue, the sea is calm, and you're floating one metre above the chequered, grassy surface of a tropical island. \"Idyllic\" isn't the word for it. \"Dangerous\" is. Apart from yourself and some pretty strange species of plant, Archipelagos is a dead world, the original inhabitants having been eliminated by invading aliens many eons ago. The aliens have long since departed, but their weapons system is still active, and it's up to you to deactivate it. Somewhere amongst the ARCHIPELAGOS BY LOGOTRON islands in each of the game's 9,999 archipelagos there are Obelisks holding the power which destroyed the Ancients. To eliminate the Obelisk, you first have to destroy its power sources -the boulders which are scattered throughout the archipelago. Locating the rocks is a question of trekking over each scrolling 3D landscape by pointing and clicking on the square you want to move to. Once you've found a boulder, just click on its square and, providing the land it's on is square you're on and kill you. Fortunately, you have a limited supply of energy which can be used to disinfect squares, or create land bridges between islands, thus connecting boulders to the Obelisk. Once all the boulders are destroyed, you have 90 seconds to get over to the Obelisk and destroy it before it destroys you. Succeed and it's on to the next archipelago, which features more islands and where there are more rocks to destroy. The higher levels feature additional hazards, such as blood eggs, which explode and pollute large areas. There are also wandering monsters which either destroy land square by square or flit around islands, waiting to bump into you so they can suck out your soul. Now, from what I've said already you must have guessed that Archipelagos is the sort of strategy adventure that Firebird made popular with The Sentinela few years back However, Archipelagos seems to lack that something that made The Sentinel the totally compulsive gaming experience it was. Some of the more advanced archipelagos are pretty vast, so even with the inclusion of a planet in the sky to indicate which direction is north doesn't always save you from losing your bearings in what can often be indistinguishable landscapes. Still, if you're prepared to persevere, Archipelagos becomes fun in a relaxing sort of way, and the eerie David Whittaker music helps in this respect.

To prove you're pugilist pals are men enough to take on the thugs you have to indulge in six rounds of stick waggling to knock the stuffing out of a punch bag. Such strenuous exercise gets the player's biceps bulging more than the boxer's, but at least the exercise is doing you good. Survive and you move on to hitting Yuppie toughs. There's no effective difference between the punches at your disposal, so finishing this stage is more a matter of luck than skill. If you do muddle your way through, you're faced with another similar level, with differnt backdrops but equally minimal gameplay. As boxing games go, quite honestly Brian, this one couldn't really be classed as a contender. IIIIIIIIIII C64 .99 Don't be fooled into thinking this is a boxing sim.

As usual, alien annihilation rewards you with armament icons in five exotic flavours. Rapid fire is automatic, and by collecting further icons you can upgrade each weapon up to four times, choosing between them with a press of the fire button. This excellent system allows you to turn your little jet-packer into a real ass-kicking merchant of menace. Unfortunately, Zybex is not without it's flaws, namely some rather ropey collision detection and sound routines courtesy of Geiger Counter Simulator. The ultra-blasty gameplay makes up for such shortcomings, though, and after a few games I was nigh on addicted. Recommended.

As he lopes and and leaps along each coridor, various greeblies try to jump our alien chum, draining his energy if they touch him. When all his strength is gone, one life goes down the lawy, and it's back to the start of the level. After Netherworld, I expected a lot of this, and I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed. Right from the beginning Zambra is tough, but once you've learned how to jump and use the extra weapons it's a tasty sponge cake of fun, upon which nifty graphics and a couple of Maniacs of Noise grooves are 00000 99 36 SUBWAY VIGILANTE Gah!

His cat like reflexes are more concussed tortise-like, Joystick control being annoyingly unresponsive. This, and the fact that the opposing skinheads regenerate three seconds after you've totalled them makes the game so difficult as to be unplayable.

The star of the show is Kiwi, who looks more like a canary than the national bird of New Zealand, but we'll let that pass. Kiwi led a moderately quiet existence in a zoo, partying the days away with his kiwi mates, until one day a fat and grumpy walrus stuffed the whole gang into a sack and put them in separate cages around the zoo. Luckily, Kiwi managed to wriggle out of the sack and now it's up to him to save his avian chums from life imprisonment. Gritting his beak, Kiwi dons his natty blue training shoes and takes to the scrolling platform scenery which makes up the zoo. Walrus has released some of the nastier zoo creatures from their cages to guard the kiwis, and most of them are armed and dangerous, so it's finger on the fire button to plug them before they plug you.

"NINTENDO long levels. The objective is simply to reach the end of the last world and destroy the creature that resides there. To do this you need to run the gauntlet of a myriad of weird and wonderful creatures and destroy the little boss on every level.

Answer: you just take the basic gameplay and improve it! And this is what Nintendo has done with Super Mario Bros II. The end result is a game of classic proportions; a game that's so addictive, each copy should come with a government health warning!

"BONUS CHANCE RA x 1 At the start of a game you choose one of four characters: Mario, Luigi, Toad or Princess Mushroom. Each has his or her special abilities: Mario is a good all-rounder who is strong, jumps well and is a fast runner; Luigi is slower, has the same strength, but can leap tall buildings in a single bound (well nearly): Toad is slow and isn't a good jumper, but is very strong, and the Princess is slow and weak, but can float for a second and a half! A new twist to Mario Il is that the characters can pick up and carry objects. The landscapes are scattered with vegetation, and these can be pulled up, roots and all and bunged at a baddie. Characters can also leap onto the back of a marauding creature, pick it up and hurl it at his chums to kill them all!

Gilbert has to play some video games in milk bars around the city to get clues as to where the bits are hidden. Hmm. Not very serious about having him stay are they? I'd have destroyed the bits of spaceship. or even blown Gilbert's brains out with a proton blaster. Crude, but more effective than sending him on this stupid quest. Frankly, the bits in between the video games are a bit boring and having to wander fruitlessly around the identical streets of the city is enough to make anyone blow snot out of their nose at mach 4.

"PREVIEW VIIIIIIIIIII RAINBOW ISLANDS Firebird Bub and Bob return! And this time they're in human form. Rainbow Islands is Taito's sequel to Bubble Bobble, which has been converted by Graftgold (Andrew Braybrook, et al) for Firebird. It's another jolly game of platforms, monsters and bonus fruit, in which you have to reach the top of each island before it sinks into the sea. Instead of catching monsters by blowing bubbles, you cast rainbows at them, then use the rainbows as temporary platforms. We've seen a near-asdammit finished ST version and, \"Gorblimey,\" we said, \"Mr Braybrook hasn't half done a good job.\" It retains all of the colourful cuteness of coin-op, and looks set to be as popular as the Bubble Bobble conversions. If not more so! RELEASED: JUNE PRICE: TBA 100000 APB Domark Take to the streets in your black-and-white as Patrolman Bob, star of another of Domark's Tengen conversions. APB is one of that rare breed, the arrest 'em up, which pits you against numerous naughty felons including bank robbers, speeding motorists, litter louts and muggers. Apart from the petty villains, Bob has to slap the cuffs on big time perps such as crazy hippy dope dealers in flowery vans. The ST demo gave the impression that the game will be a speedy little number, with lots of nippy multi-directional scrolling, nasty motors and doughnuts. What more could a fellah ask for?

"REVIEW WIIIIIIIIIIZ SCORE DOUX GHOULS 'N' GHOSTS US Gold Aren't US Gold making a good job of their latest set of Capcom conversions? First we had Forgotten Worlds, then Black Tiger, and on the horizon is Ghouls 'n' Ghosts, which from what we've seen, is going to be every bit as good as the former pair. The game is the sequel to the classic shoot'em up. Ghosts 'n' Goblins, and casts the player as a knight in shining armour, sallying forth to rescue his favourite princess from combustible zombies, uncompromising demons, scaly wyrms and other nasty supernaturals. US Gold are using their best endeavours to make sure the gameplay is as close to the coin-op as possible, and as you can see from our ST and Spectrum screenshots, programmers Software Creations have worked hard on keeping sprites and backdrops true to the original. RELEASED: NOVEMBER PRICES: TBA SUPER SCRAMBLE SIMULATOR Gremlin You've seen our fab competition, now read the preview! Race your muddy motorbike against the clock over five levels of increasingly difficult, 138/88 rough-riding courses. Slippery logs, loose rocks, 45 degree hills, skips full of water and other Kick Start-ish obstacles stand between you and the finish line, making life horribly difficult and death horribly painful.

"DREVIEW ORIENTAL GAMES Firebird Woo-wee! Chopsocky city is on the road from Firebird, in the form of what they're calling \"the Ultimate martial arts fighting simulator\". That's fightin' talk, and no mistake, but we're promised beatings and bruisings in four tough sports. There's \"King Fu\" (says the press release actually we think this is meant to say «Kung Fu\", but we do like to have a laugh at Firebird's expense now and again), Hollywood Rules (\"does it? arf arf!\"), Sumo Wrestling and Kendo («Ken who?

Here's a very, very early screenshot of the ST version of Atari's arcade driving sim, currently in the capable hands of experienced vector graphics programmer Jurgen Friedrich (he who allegedly programmed the Star Wars conversion from memory). The drive around the demo track, and a few whizzes through the loop-the-loop were enough to convince us that Hard Drivin' is gonna be hot-hothot. The look of the arcade game has been faithfully reproduced, but will Jurgen be able to keep the action fast?

"DREVIEW IIIIIIIIIII BATMAN THE MOVIE Ocean The Dark Knight returns in Ocean's third batgame, based on the upcoming film starring Michael Keaton as Batman, Jack Nicholson as the Joker and a restyled Batmobile (but no Robin). The Joker is up to his usual high-spirited crimes, this time threatening to kill the population of Gotham City with nerve laughing gas. Only the Batman can save the city, and he starts his investigation in the Joker's chemical factory where he has to find a nerve gas sample so he can 0001800013501 make an antidote. As he leaps and swings around the platforms he is constantly beset by evil henchpersons. If he should find a sample Batman has to get it back to the Bat Cave for analysis. The Joker is in hot pursuit, though and he chases our hero through the scrolling streets of Gotham City. After analysing the gas with the batcomputer, Batman takes off in the Batwing, neutralising balloons full of gas as he swoops over the city. The final confrontation takes place in Gotham Cathedral, where the Joker is either defeated or the death warrant of Gotham City is signed. Dramatic stuff indeed! What we've seen of the game looks mighty promising, and hopefully judging by the screenshots, you'll agree. The film and the game are due for simultaneous release so you can enjoy both at the same time (if you think you can stand it).

Flashing your lights and woo-wooing a bit doesn't work; the only way you'll get them into custody is by knocking their car off the road. The arcade game is ripping stuff, as is the Spectrum version, a demo of which we've seen with our own eyes, and which is depicted here. It's fast, it's smooth, it's practically a monochrome version of the arcade machine, with whopping graphics shifting about the place as if they're on motorised castors.
