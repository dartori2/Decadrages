"GAME GEAR CALUMNS SEGA GET IN GEAR SESSE HIt seems like hand-helds are all the rage, these days what with the Nintendo Game Boy (now officially available in this country and selling like hot cakes), the Atari Lynx and the soon to be released Turbo Express GT (the portable PC Engine), it looks like portable consoles are the games systems of the future. Now Sega have jumped onto the bandwagon with their new Game Gear, and the C+VG crew had a good look at an imported machine from Electro Games. GEAR BOX The Game Gear is essentially a portable Master System with extra bits. It's about two-thirds the size of the Lynx, measuring a meagre 103 x 210mm and weighing 570 g. It has a built-in 3 inch, backlit LCD colour screen, which can display 480 x 146 pixels, in any of 16 colours from a palette of 4096 (the Master System has a palette of 128). Though the games we saw made very Master System-like noises, the Game Gear can produce sound or music on three stereo channels, and it has it's own stereo headphone socket for private listening. GAME GEAR GEAR The Game Gear's got a whole bundle of add-ons coming out as well, such as an optional TV tuner (so you can watch your fave shows wherever you want), a link-up lead, and a cable to connect the machine to the cigarette lighter of a car! But what about the games? GAME GEAR GAMES The machine was launched in Japan with three games, Super Monaco GP Columns and Pengo, and after having a good look at all three we reckon they're pretty good. There are more on the way, including a conversion of Sega's stomach-churning coin-op GLOC, as well as Wonderboy, Pro Baseball '90 and Dragon Crystal LANDING GEAR The price? In Japan, this little wonder is selling for about 19800 yen, or about , with the games for only 3500 yen, or 14 quid! Could this be the end of the Lynx and the Game Boy? Not yet, because some of the importers who are bringing the machine into the UK at the moment are selling it for between  and ! Virgin haven't set a price or a launch date as yet, but they hope to have Game Gears in the shops early next year, for under  which seems much more sensible. Pictured here is the new Simpsons pintable, but forget about that, because the real business of this news piece is the announcement that Ocean have snapped up the licence to the Simpsons, the show which is currently wowing SKY TV viewers! In the US, The Simpsons have already gained more cult popularity than the Turtles (and that's big!), and are set to do the same over here, what with associated merchandising and the like. A Nintendo version of The Simpsons is already out in the States, courtesy of Acclaim, but it remains until next summer to see if Bart and his family can achieve the same status on British computer screens CAN I PLAY BULLFROG HOP IT EAT MY SHORTS, MAN! I out in the States, courtesy of Acclaim MADNESS? All the headbangers and moshers amongst you, listen up! US Gold have announced that they have accquired the licence to those metal monsters, Iron Maiden! PR supremo Danielle Woodyatt told us there are no plans at this time for what shape or form an Iron Maiden game will take, but it'll definitely feature Eddie (Maiden's mascot) as the central character, as well as loads of Maiden tracks! More news, as and when... Bullfrog, developers of the critically-acclaimed God simulator, Populous, as well as the wacky Flood and the totally brilliant Powermonger (see the review later this issue), is planning to end its long-term relationship with publisher Electronic Arts, and set up under their own label, as Core Design and the Sales Curve have recently done. Rumours are flying around that Bullfrog will follow another top team, the Bilmap Brothers, and join up with the new Renegade label. Keep reading C+VG for more info as we get it. DON'T HAVE "


"ODDE ALL 01-30-45 DAMOCLES THE NEXT GENERATION A HORSE'S HEAD IN YOUR BED? Now that the excellent 16 bit sequel to Mercenary, Damocles, has been knocking around for a while, Novagen are about to unleash two mission disks that will expand on the original, with new plots and problems. And what's more, the two disks (the first should be about by the time you read this, the second is due in January of '91) will cost a grand total of just .99 each! We've no further info on what form the missions will take, but if you can't wait, Novagen can be reached on 021 449 7516. With the long-awaited third film arriving in March 1991, US Gold have announced that they have accquired the license to The Godfather, the story of loyalty, power, and extreme violence within the Mafia, and particularly the Corleone family. USG supremo Geoff Brown commented that there are only a small number of absolutely instantly recognisable licenses in the world, and The Godfather is high amongst these. With the launch of the new film, the spotlight will be firmly on The Godfather\". We have our doubts, but USG intend to release both an interactive adventure and an action game, so judgement will be reserved until we see more on them GOLD LICENCES-A-GO-GO! hasson FME 45 HIT 3/8 Sega have now made an agreement with US Gold which gives the Brummie boys the license to convert all present and future Sega coin-ops. The two titles planned for conversion at the moment are Super Monaco GP (to be written by Probe, and is planned to be a combination of the excellent Megadrive version and the coin-op), and the sequel to Afterburner, G-LOC. How these two monster coin-ops turn out on computer is anybody's guess, but we await the outcome with interest. Also due to be unleashed are two Capcom coin-ops, MERCS (a multiplayer Commando-style blast, to be done by Tiertex), and Final Fight, which Creative Materials (currently working on the conversions of ESWAT and Line of Fire) will be doing LES DANDOLES LE DI 00-00-51 the jobbie on. No info on release dates as yet, but as soon as we know, you will too. AN EVEN BIGGER CHOPPER? SIM CITY MISSION DISKS Not content with just releasing their amazing Sim Earth game, Maxis have come up with some new scenario disks for their classic \"god\" game. With the first disk, you can create cities based around Ancient Asia, Medieval times, and the Wild West (create your own Dodge City!). But there's more, in the form of a second data disk. This disk will welcome you to the 21st century, where you can build cities of the future in either America, Europe or even the Moon! Infogrames (rather than Ocean) are selling the disks at twenty sovs a piece. Sounds a tad overpriced, but if Sim City's your bag, check them out. MicroProse are now planning to release a sequel to their best-selling smash copter sim, Gunship. Codenamed Gunship 2000, the game will centre around an updated version of the Apache AH-64 attack copter, set against a world of drug barons and criminals, rather than the political Cold War theme of the original. According to trade newspaper CTW, the game has already been in production for 18 months, and should be ready for release on the PC around next June. If it's half as good as the original, Gunship 2000 should be nothing short of brilliant. Check out a preview in a future ish of C+VG, and watch the skies! BOLU "


"IN THE DEEP MIDWINTER TOO Rainbird have announced plans to release the sequel to their critically-acs claimed 3D epic, Midwinter. Maelstrom will once again be the brains behind the game originally called Wildfire, but according to Julia Coombs, MicroProse's PR person, the final game will be called something along the lines of \"Flames of Freedom\" (dramatic, eh?). From what we've seen of the game so far, it's similar in aspect to the original protect an archipelago of islands from invasion by a malevolent force but is a heck of a lot bigger in most respects. There are zillions more characters and no less than 22 modes of transport (including scuba diving, mini-submarines, bi-planes and even Zeppelins!). Look out for more information as we get it! WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD AGAIN One of Ocean's major hits from several years ago was Wizball, a wacky shoot 'em up of sorts which cast the player as a wizard trying to return the colour to his blighted world. Now Ocean have announced plans for Wizball II, and have recruited the authors of the original, Sensible Software, to do the job. It should be very interesting to see if the sequel can grab more accolades than its predecessor, but you'll have to wait until spring of next year to find out right here in C+VG. CONSOLE BOOK IV THE REVENGE! Yes indeed, folks, not content with bringing you up to the minute console news in C+VG (or our new sister mag. Mean Machines, for that matter), we're now ploughing our way through the fourth book in the Complete Guide to Consoles series, and it's going to be the biggest and best yet! It'll be on the newsstands at the end of November, and will set you back the princely sum of .95. Don't miss it! SPREADSHEETS ON A MEGADRIVE? IMPOSSAMOLE CONQUERS USA GERONAMOLE!!! After starring in five (count 'em!) computer games, our hero, Monty Mole is now poised to conquer the United States in an all-new Impossamole adventure for lucky Turbografx (PC Engine to us) owners. But it's not just one game that our Monty is set to appear in. NEC are rather excited about this little furry creature, and are also set to move the lovable mole into the \"lucrative world of merchandising\". So expect Monty cuddly toys and the like, as well as the Engine game. We'll keep you posted... Thomas Cook Well, not quite, more like the other way around! What are we blathering on about? (What are YOU blathering on about, you mean, Rob Ed) Sega are going to make the jump from console to computer (sort of) and are planning to release the first in what is expected to be a large range of PC compatibles! And what's more, Megadrive carts can be plugged into em, so you can mix business with pleasure! The Sega 286PC will be a 68000-based machine, with a 14\" VGA monitor, a highdensity 3.5\" drive, a built-in modem and of course, the Megadrive cartridge port! Pheoowee! As you can see, it looks very nice indeed, but what it will cost and when it'll be available is as yet unknown. One thing is certain if we get our hands on one, no work will ever get done!   10   "

"HAVE FUN WITH YOUR JOYSTICKS A bit cheesed off with your battleweary Nintendo joypads? Finger cramp getting a bit too much? Well, you can wave goodbye to those NES terrors with these amazing new joysticks from Spectravideo. The NiPro boasts an enormous LED display, to tell you when you have moved or pressed a button (useful, huh?), and an ergonomically designed stick to boot. The Ni5 is a stick with less designer pulling power because it's mere. ly a cut-down version of the Pro (and hasn't got the LEDs either). They look a bit too unwieldy for us, but at .95 for the Ni5 and .99 for the NiPro, you're certainly getting value for money, and since they've both got micro switches, they should last for quite a long while as well. I WANT TO RIDE MY BICYCLE Feeling run down? Playing too many games, and not getting enough exercise? Now you can do both at once! Coming soon to an arcade near you is the TeleBike, a game which involves cycling around city and countryside alike, whilst trying to win numerous races. As you can see, this involves pedalling like hell in order to keep out in front, which makes it possibly more knackering than the old Sega boxing game, Heavyweight Champ. Looks like the sort of game that'll either give you massive leg muscles or an early coronary if you ask us, but keep-fit fanatics should keep their eyes peeled.

The show's also going to be used by several companies to launch exciting new products, and the super-secret Commodore CD-TV is also scheduled to make a special guest appearance. But there's no denying that the show's major pulling point is going to be colossal savings to be made no matter what computer (or even console) you own, so make sure you get down to the Wembley Conference Centre in London (get off the tube at Wembley Park and follow the signs) early to avoid the rush!

At the end of each level, the Turtles will have to face one of the Shredder's more evil henchmen, Bebop or Rocksteady to name but two. With six levels of New York to clear up, this game'll have you at your computer for ages. The actual gameplay takes place on a large fourway scrolling map, representing the crime-ridden city.

"If you want to take control of a droid, move around in transfer mode to save time for when you need to transfer. It only takes a short time to change into transfer mode, but that's normally long enough for your droid to be shot to pieces! angles. The rapid firing sentinel (614) shoots at any angle, so its shots cover a wide area, hopefully missing the Influence Device. PARADROID '90 PLAYER'S GUIDE. C+VG were the first by months with the exclusive review of the totally gob-smacking Paradroid '90. Now here, as an oh-so-special service to our stalwart readers is a totally brilliant player's guide. These tips (as provided by those funky dudes at Graftgold) will put your Influence Droid back on the path to glory! The best way to get near a droid that you want to transfer to is to spiral around it, getting closer all the time. Its shots should miss you until you get very close, by which time you should be able to transfer. Listen to the sound effects. Enemy shots can be heard even when they are off the screen. Also doors, energy points and computer terminals can be heard when droids are using them, giving you some idea of the position of other droids. Picking up the Graftgold key will delay the entry time for the raiders by three minutes. There is a key on every ship but it may be hidden. Shoot the strong droids first. Weak droids never fire shots but are useful for transferring to protecting the Influence Device from enemy shots and giving a few more pulsers in the transfer game. Shooting around corners is very handy. It is possible to kill some droids in this way without them shooting back, either because they can't see you or because you have blown them away before they had time to react In the transfer game, wait until the enemy droid has fired all or most of its pulsers before firing your own. This method will normally get a successful transfer as the enemy will have no pulsers to counteract yours. SSSSSSSSSSS Don't move into explosions. You lose energy doing this and the weaker droids will explode if they are in contact with an explosion. Sometimes two or three droids can be destroyed because of one explosion. You face the same direction leaving a lift as you did when you entered it. Using this technique it is possible to make \"surprise\" attacks on the other droids. LEDE Watch out for the maintenance droid (476). Although its flame thrower has a limited shooting distance it still causes large amounts of damage. Using the shuttles' thrusters to fry enemy droids as they go past isn't very effective and gives you nowhere to hide in case of enemy attack not a recommended tactic. hage. Try to clear a deck of droids before moving on to the next one. A systematic approach to clearing a ship saves on droid energy. Use the computer terminals to see what decks still have droids on. Some droids can't be damaged by some of the other droids' shots. The mine layer (734) is a prime example of this as it is heavily armoured. In cases like this transferring is the only way to defeat the droid. Different sound effects are used to indicate if a droid is being damaged by a weapon. Learn the enemy patrol routes. The droid movement is actually very predictable so time and energy can be saved by knowing where a droid is going or what it could do next. Keep moving. Once an enemy droid has targeted on you it will keep firing. Even after it is destroyed there may still be shots heading towards you. Never run in the opposite direction of an enemy shot. You can't outrun a bullet so your best bet is to move to the left or right of a shot. All weapons have a limited range, but some are more limited that others Learn the good and bad points about A each type of droid. The triple beam battle droid (742) has a powerful shot but is slow to move whereas the messenger (302) is very fast but has no weapon. It is also annoyingly cute. Most of the droids fire with their right arm. So it is possible to dodge their shots by staying to the left of them. This technique works well on the triple beam battle droid (742) because it fires only at 45 degree The rapid-firing sentinel (614) is the best droid with its fast firing to a good range and it is responsive and fast to control. The only real drawback is that it's weapon doesn't damage the mine layer (734) or the command cyborg (999). "

"THE C+VGO THE AMAZING DOMARK/TENGEN CHALLENGE The first of C+VG's softco challenges took resident editor, Paul Glancey and forever grumbling staff writer, Richard Leadbetter along with the fearless challengers, to Adleston in Surrey the home of the Kremlin. The Kremlin, in case you didn't know, is the home of Domark's newly-formed development team, responsible for topper games like The Spy Who Loved Me, and forthcoming attractions such as the home versions of Atari's STUN Runner coin-op, MiG 29 and war sim, 'Nam. So now you know. THE CHALLENGERS One misty October morning brought forth two worthy challen scorer received ten points, the runner-up got eight whilst six gers, especially selected by the C+VG highscore panel of ex and five were given for third and fourth place respectively. perts for their gamesplaying expertise. Enter Dave Moore, The winner would be the lucky bloke to pick up the most from Jaz's very own home town of Southend-on-Sea and Anpoints after all four rounds. With all that numerical malarkey drew Butters from sunny Deptford. Dave, in particular, had imout of the way, it was down to business with the first game... pressed us before with his stonking Blood Money and Thunderforce III scores, whilst Andrew had cut his teeth on the brill Speccy version of Rainbow Islands. Joining the fray were John Kavanagh (head programming honcho at the Kremlin) and C+VG's Richard Leadbetter, who faced certain death (followed by redundancy) if he didn't win. GAME ONE STUN RUNNER Having led particularly sheltered lives, none of the challengers (apart from John, obviously) had ever played the arcade version of STUN Runner before. In the practice session, Dave and Andrew both knocked up reasonably high scores, but poor old Rich didn't seem so confident, and failed to complete one level! But when the crunch came, John seemed the favourite (after all, his team of programmers are converting the game!). and not surprisingly, he steamed to victory with a huge 111,865. Andrew shot up a respectable 99,725 leaving Rich to come third (even though he left the office armed with hints from arcade champ, Julian Rignall), and Dave to \"bring up the rear\". Dressed in their promotional Domark T-Shirts, the brave contenders line up in the Adlestone sunshine for a pic. On the left we have Domark's own John Kavanagh, and next to him, covering his embarrassment with a STUN Runner cap, C+VG'S own Richard Leadbetter. Andrew Butters is the young fellah-me-lad in the purple pants and on the right we have Dave Moore, who is looking around for the nearest toilet. THAT SCORING SYSTEM EXPLAINED The rules for the championship were in. For each game, each player was given three minutes to clock up the highest score possible. At the end of the gamesplaying capers, the top GAME TWO BADLANDS After a nourishing lunch laid on by the cuddly marketing people at Domark, it was time to return to the serious business of gamesplaying. Andrew and Dave had never seen Badlands on the Amiga, but the disgustingly smug grin returned to the face of Richard (who had reviewed the game the month before) whilst John complained that he couldn't ! 52 DOMARK "

He shouldn't have worried that much as he managed to rack in a colossal 13,200 much to John's annoyance. Even after Andrew's effort, Richard took the lead but it was a very narrow one! After the strenuous Badlands round, the hardplaying buckaroos tuck into a yummy picnic lunch. You'll notice Dave isn't in this pic he was looking for the toilet again.

"CHIE C+VG CHALLENGE hands in furtive excitement, and John (with his Kremlin programmer audience) was looking forward to an easy victory. The first heat, between Andrew and Dave went pretty badly. In his allotted three minutes, Dave went through nine (count 'em NINEI) credits leaving a pretty miserable score of 2,850 at the end of it. Andrew plodded on with and emerged with a reasonable 9,450. The time of the second heat arose... Both Richard and John were aware of a very special Klax that takes over a minute of precious time to construct, but gives a massive 265,000 point bonus! The timer started, and the serious klax ing began, Richard started constructing his elaborate pointraking Klax, and pulled it off not once but twice finishing his heat with an absolutely astounding 531,120! John was particularly miffed at only pulling in 143,665 still enough to give him the coveted second place. THE FINAL RANKINGS Enter C+VG's resident editor and ex-'Of-Level Maths student, Paul Glancey, to \"tot up\" the scores. Using all ten fingers, Paul calculated that, at the lower end of the scoring spectrum came Southend's Dave Moore with 23 points. Above him with 29 points was the Deptford's Dynamo himself, Andrew Butters. John Kavanagh came in at second place with 30 points. But Paul wasn't the only one with an 'O' level in Maths. Using the skills taught to him in his CSE Maths and GCSE Statistics classes, Richard had already figured out that he was the top gamesplayer with a massive 34 points! The satanic gleam in Rich's eye provides a clue to the source of his supernatural gamesplaying prowess.

"THE PRESENTATION Enter the Tengen Trophy! Because Richard had annoyed everyone so much, and John had only achieved his score because of his involvement on STUN Runner, it was decided to give the winners' trophy to Andrew Butters for his outstanding contribution to the championship. Hooray! Along with his groovy trophy, Andrew also walked off with ten Domark games for his Spectrum, whilst Dave scooped up five Domark classics for his Amiga. And on top of that, Domark rewarded each of the lads with a brilliant Nintendo Game Boy for their efforts! Displaying the sort of inane leer that has become his trademark, top man, Paul Glancey presents the Tengen trophy to Andrew. What a guy! What a cap. tion! RUNNER A Suddenly stricken with \"tense, nervous hea dache\", Dave is forced to put down his joystick while Andrew plays on! Once again, the camera catches Dave looking around for a lavvy, while young Andrew gets some practice in on STUN Runner. NEXT MONTH... In the next C+VG Challenge, we'll be going \"on the road\" (well, \"on the train\" seems more likely) to Sheffield, where some hand-picked C+VG readers will be taking the Gremlin gang on at some of their latest releases, including Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge! Following that, we hope to be running a Kick Off 2 Championship so if you reckon you're one of the country's top Kicker Offers, fill in a Challenge form NOW (there's one on page 164) and send it in, marking the envelope \"KICK OFF CHALLENGER\"! Dave demonstrates his devil-may-care driving skills which he had obviously learned from fellow Southender, Julian Rignall. Unfortunately, he was soon to find that controlling a STUN ship isn't the same as cruising down the seafront with the windows open and the radio turned up. "

As each chip disappears, the image of Murphy reforms in the microscreen at top-right. with all this heavy combat, Robo often finds his targeting system needs recalibrating, so he is sent to the police shooting range. Targets pop up all over the screen, and Robo has to blast as many as he can before they disappear. Watch out for the lawabiding citizens, though, as each one shot reduces Robo's score when the timer runs down! 64 "

SET 00005000 VIIIIIIIIIIII GX4000 CART .99 The first thing that struck me about Robocop 2 was the very nice graphics it makes really good use of the GX4000's colour capabilities. The other plus point is that because the whole game is on cartridge, the lack of a longwinded tape multiload makes it much easier to enjoy it. The actual structure of the game isn't too far removed from that of the original Robocop game, insofar as it mixes action sections with puzzle games and a target shoot-out, and the formula works almost as well as it did before. The only problem I actually had was with the Amstrad joypad, which made getting those essential diagonals a little tricky. On the whole, though, this is a pretty good movie licence which is sure to be a big hit with the new breed of software-starved Amstrad owners.

Both graphics and sound fit the bill nicely, with well-animated characters and loads of sampled sound, but the gameplay suffers from being over-difficult in parts, making things somewhat frustrating. There are some very nice touches, such as Gizmo parachuting in Rambo. style when the correct token is collected, and the Gremlins disappearing with a satisfying \"squelch\" when blasted.

Elaine Marley was Melee Island's governor, a woman with power and responsibility, but when her eyes met his sparks flew and made little scorch marks in the carpet! Alas, their romance is to be cut short, for Elaine is none other than the past lover of Captain LeChuck, and before Guybrush can plant the first smooch, LeChuck returns in spectral form to claim her back and carry her off to his hideaway on Monkey Island.

Usually the entertainment you get from an adventure is derived solely from solving puzzles, but the hilarious characters and situations, and the movie-like presentation (with cut-scenes and various \"camera\" viewpoints) make playing this more like taking part in a comedy film so it's much more enjoyable. The puzzles are brilliantly conceived too, and success depends more on looking and listening, which I think is preferable to mind-bending lateral thinking.

BATTLE COMMAND is an arcade/strategy game in which the player controls a single \"MAULER\" Assault Tank in one of 16 scenarios (missions) in the ultra war, fought between two dominant races in the NEW WORLD. The latest phase of the North South war has been going on for over 10 years, with a stalemate eventually developing a standoff between armies, massed over a long dug-in battlefront. Such are the defensive capabilities of each side, full scale attacks are suicidal. So any offensive moves are by necessity, small \"behind the lines\" actions performed by elite troops in specially designed vehicles. The Mauler is the latest such machine capable of being lifted in and out of hostile territory by fast stealth choppers and armed with the most advanced weaponry the Northern scientists can devise.

"EVIEW WIIIIIIIII ONINTENDO C+VG INDY3 HIT CORO A In search of the Cross of Coronada in Indy 3. BY TAITO e's back, and he's brought his dad again! Indiana Jones, archaeologist, hard guy and star of three money-raking movies, is out to find the Holy Grail, the fabled receptacle of the blood of Christ, and nothing's gonna stand in his way! Following the plot of the film, the game starts off on board a ship, through which Indy has to fight off hordes of fist-fighting thugs in order to retrieve the Coronado Cross. Once successful, Indy receives a telegram from his friend Sallah telling him his father has been kidnapped, and taken to Castle Brunwald. Does Indy travel to Germany and rescue Daddy Indy, or go to Vienna and continue the search for the Grail? You have to make that decision, but bear in mind that following one pathway means you miss out on whatever perils or goodies are in store on the other route. The mix of arcade action and decision making is most reminiscent of a Cinemaware game. The castle scene, for example, is a massive maze, with secret entrances and traps galore. The desert section in which Marcus Brody has to be rescued from a Nazi tank before it goes off the edge of a cliff is also in, and there's even a motorbike sequence, in which Indy has to avoid traps, gun emplacements and enemy riders! IIIIIIIIIII NINTENDO .99 I've always been a little sceptical of console \"adventures in the past, but Last Crusade completely blows away any cynicism I might have had (Ooh, you're such a hard man to please Ed). The feel of the game and the fact that it sticks so closely to the plot of the movie makes playing feel like watching the movie unfold. The graphics are great, with buckets of colour on both the action and intermission screens, and the sprites whizz around the screen at a great rate of knots. The main tune is a very nice rendition of the title theme, and there's lots of nicely done spot FX thrown in for good measure. Indy walks and runs around like a thing possessed, punching, jumping, kicking and whipping, and is very well animated indeed, as are all the sprites. The game is so involved, but allows you to skip around certain parts of the game, so you can dictate how the difficulty curve escalates! Quite frankly, this has got to be one of the best Nintendo games to date, and you'd have to be an utter pillock or someone who absolutely hates Harrison Ford to miss it.

While it isn't all that complicated, the vast array of tactics and ideas make Supremacy a great strategy game. I particularly liked the high quality graphics used throughout the game (check out the spaceship pics!), which add a lot to the game's overall feel and atmosphere.

"OAMIGA PC BY LUCASFILM/US GOLD REVIEW WIIIIIIZ AMIGA .99 VODOVOD $00000L 9 TUL etting a job at Industrial Might and Logic (a wee joke on the name of Lucasfilm's special effects company, Industrial Light and Magic, methinks) is no easy lask. Take Fred and Freda Fixit, for example. They've been trying to get a job there for ages, and only now has the hard-nosed boss given them a trial run. Their task is to run the Beast a massive machine which churns out toys of famous Lucasfilm characters by the lorryload. Sounds easy, yes? Guess again! Running the Beast involves pedaling a bike to bring the machine's energy levels up to scratch, then turning all manner of switches and dials to ensure the right parts appear for the right toys in the right colours! And if that isn't enough, a couple of mischievous lemmings get in on the act and try to throw a spanner in the works! Erk! Success will be rewarded with some very nice bonuses, but if Fred or Freda fail to meet their quota (by either not making enough toys, or making too many rejects). they'll be given their cards, and get the receiving end of a boot! The easiest thing that can be said about Night Shift is that it's a platform game with knobs on literally! At first glance, Night Shift looks like a lot of fun, and it is for the first few plays. But once you hit the later levels, you find that there's just too much to do at any one time. keep the bike going, turn this dial, hit that switch, stop the lemmings, arrrgh! Everything goes into maximum overdrive, and reject toys seem to appear from every nook and cranny! Having to race around again rectifying the situation is more frustration-inducing than fun, and so the playability level suffers quite a bit. The graphics and sound are very nice, even if everything seems to appear a touch squashed, and there are some very entertaining sequences, featuring the cigarchomping boss, and the lemmings (one of which has a bright red nose!). If well 'ard platform action is the one for you, have a gander you may like this, you may not. Be sure you're up to the challenge, though this is no game for novices! ROBERT SWAN STREAL MEGHTN RHD LOGIC ORATE EMPL.CODE OUDING IIIIIIIIIII PC .99 INDUSTRIAL MIGHT AND LOGIC JOB APPLICATION UPDATE Night Shift should be cranking up on the ST, C64, Spectrum and Amstrad some time in the New Year, the ST version (which should be similar to the Amiga and PC versions in most respects) retailing for .99, and the 8 bit versions for .99. The graphics aren't exactly awe-inspiring, so the 8 bits should be able to capture the majority of the game intact. Depending on the graphics format used, PC Night Shift is similar to the Amiga version in most respects, but with larger graphics and poorer sound.

The backdrops, although smoothly scrolling, won't exactly set the art world alight and the sound is rather disappointing. However, the playability on this game is what sets it apart from the usual beat 'em up fare. Collecting your prize money and laying into your next opponent with your new extra goodies is really rather good, especially when you use a fade in two player mode confusion guaranteed. There's a fair amount of combat moves on offer, and the animation on all of the combatants is arcade quality I kid you not!

"REVIEW VIIIIIIIII LEVEL PC ENGINE .00 C+VG SEZ Over the last few months, the Engine's been on the receiving end of quite a few sword-slingers (such as the so-so Rastan m), and none were game enough to stand up to the original Legendary Axe. Now the sequel is here, and it's not only as good as the original it actually improves on it! The graphics are brilliantly drawn dark and eerie backdrops with creatures of the night leaping hither and thither. The sound is really good, with the odd clang and grunt thrown in for good measure, but the gameplay is where things really get hot! The difficulty curve lets you get to grips with a few nasties to start with, then lets you have it from all angles not enough to have you screaming in frustration, but just enough to get the old adrenalin pumping overtime. Overall, a great sequel, and a brilliant hack 'n slash in its own right. Highly recommended!

"OAMIGA DEVIEW ZIMIZ Bholti AMIGA .99 TIME RETRY: A Match the blocks for extra points. REDE I really love puzzle games of this type, essentially because of their simplicity of play and addictive nature, and Puzznic definitely falls into this category. At first glance, it plays like it looks very simple indeed but on later levels things go from one extreme to the other! The graphics and sound are very basic, but this tits the gameplay adequately. It'll take some time to work out the traps on some of the later levels, but the feeling you get after completing a particularly nasty stage is well worth the effort. Out of the glut of puzzlers that are doing the rounds, Puzznic is one of the few worth playing bold words, indeed, but that's how addictive this game is. If puzzle games are your thing (and even if they aren't), Puzznic is definitely worth a play or two, or maybe lots! ROBERT SWAN GRAPHICS 76% SOUND VALUE PLAYABILITY 80% BY OCEAN Duzznic, like Ocean's previous release Plotting, is a conversion of a little-known coin-op (this one is by Taito). and like the afore-mentioned title, the objective is simply to clear each screen of blocks. Unlike Plotting, however, the player uses a crosshair to \"grab' a block, and push it left or right or drop it into a gap to connect it with a block with the same logo. When the blocks touch, they vanish. It's not all that simple, though moving blocks and traps in the floor make life difficult, and when three similar blocks have to be disposed of, the player has to work out how to get rid of all three without leaving one! 80% 82% A More blocks than Legoland (tm)! Choose your level here. M OVERALL 80% INIMUI MUNN UN UPDATE Puzznic will be out in the next few weeks on the ST, which should be quite similar to its Amiga counterpart even in price.

"ADVERTISEMENT 66 Just what a game should be: looks good, 99 sounds good, and plays like a dream. Chris Morley, ACE, October 1990 ACE RATED ACE By Graftgold RATED 936 936 The 3D vector graphics system in Simulcra features solid filled 30 graphics with shadows and light Intensity surfaces. The system allows solid and wireframe surfaces to be freely mixed. Stipple and transparent/semitransparent surfaces are also employed. The game code runs up to 252 non player objects on the map. The game cycle rate and the view cycle are Independent so that game time can be kept more or less constant even if the display rate is slowed down. Special explosion effects are achieved using a highly efficient particle controller that individually moves up to 100 particles. Definitely a game that goes with a bang! Simuler uses a grid-based map similar to Virus but includes 'blank squares, Introducing ground-based and flight action To add variety to an already exciting game, Microstyle have thrown in a wide variety of enemies. First, and most common, are the laser turrets that slowly sweep in a complete circle until they lock onto you, whereupon they fire viciously. Various ground and air attack craft, such as Jeeps and small tanks, race around the walkways, thankfully needing only one shot to kill. Then you reach the megatanks these can only be killed with missiles, but when shot explode in the most satisfactory way yet, by first ejecting the gun turret and then collapsing in on MICROSTYLE hurl you into the themselves with a terrific sound effect.

Just what a game should be: looks good, sounds good, and plays like a dream. Here at MicroStyle we couldn't think of anything more to add to Chris Morleys' review for Octobers edition of Ace. Simulcra is verging on the awesome, conjuring up immediate comparisons with the classic Virus. Your SRV rotates 360 degrees and can fly or drive. The rotation and shading are excellent and the game has a great feeling of speed, Battle is fast and furious and you can power up the SRV with loads of goodies including speedups, radar, fire and forget missiles, target display systems, shields, and extra lives.

The automapping facility alone is an enormous boon to adventurers, and this, combined with the ability to manipulate items onscreen, adds new dimensions to traditional adventuring. Luckily MS avoided the temptation to become Sierra clones, and have now released a games system that leads the field. I personally think that this opens the genre to people who would normally never touch adventures, and that can only be a good thing.

In theory BAT's point-andclick icon system would seem to work very well, but in practice it's very long-winded and issuing a command requires too much effort. The graphics are very nice Indeed, but a special mention must go to the sound, supplied by the MV-16, a unit which plugs into the MIDI port and chucks out some really good, but very loud, 16 channel sound! The only drawback to this is you've got to plug headphones or a hi-fi in to listen to it. However, keen UBIsoft fans, will be pleased to hear that all their future releases will use the MV-16. The game itself falls down in one major respect things happen too quickly, and it doesn't give the player a chance to react. Barely a minute into the game, I found myself stuck in a toilet, pursued by a killer robot, and with no ammunition and no way out! The price tag is a bit steep too, even with the hardware add-on.

"DREVIEW UIIIIIIIIII BATMAN SUNSOFT What! Yet ANOTHER console Batman game! Yep, that's right and PC Engine Batman has finally hit British shores. The bad news is that it hasn't got much in common with the fabbo Megadrive game reviewed in the last Complete Guide to Consoles. Indeed, the platform based beat'em up action has been replaced with an unusual PacMan type effort. But do not despair, because although it's a completely different kettle of fish, this conversion of Batman still has jam-hot playability, as the dangerously-addicted Mean Machines art department are at pains to point out!

"DREVIEW IIIIIIIIIIIII RANXEROXOS!! ME SIM EARTH MAXIS/OCEAN The follow-up to the fabulous Sim City is nearly upon us, and promises to blow its predecessor away in both size and depth by not giving you just a city to design and maintain, but a whole planet! Absolutely everything involved in the creation of a world has been crammed into this new Maxis product. First off, you decide what basic form your planet takes be it vaguely Earth-like (continents and oceans), solely water, or just one huge desert the choice is yours! You can even start right from the beginning with a molten mass that gradually cools, and settles down into land masses which drift apart just like the real thing. Create suitable environments and you can expect life of some description to evolve, from amoeba-like creafures all the way to huge, sprawling (maybe humanoid) colonies. Life forms as well as external forces (such as solar wind) all have some kind of impact of is environment and Sim Earth follows the Gala theory which states that the whole planet is a living organism which will adapt to any changes which take place even at the expense of any life living on it (wow-cosmic, huh?). Ocean came down and gave us a sneak preview of what could be the greatest \"god\" game yet! PC owners are going to be first to sample the delights of world creation, but Amiga and ST owners aren't going to be left out as versions are planned for their machines too. RELEASE: PC, AMIGA, ST, TBA PRICE: TBA TOO RANX UBISOFT Ubisoft's latest is a computer translation of a slightly sicko French comic, which even horrified our own hardened comic guru, Rob Swan! As for the game itself, the player stars as an android with muscles of steel (obviously not for flexing, then) who must rescue his kidnapped girlfriend and save the world into the bargain!

"REVIEW 8888080er0000000000 RE SHADOW OF THE BEAST OCEAN Well, Gremlin did the honours for Spectrum and Amstrad owners (see the reviews this ish!) but it was left to Ocean to come up with the goods for the C64! And that's not all, for the conversion of Psygnosis graphically amazing game is going to be available on cartridge only so you can wave goodbye to those multiload blues! As this screen shot shows, it doesn't look, too bad at all. Keep your peepers glued to C+VG to see if it plays as good as it looks! RELEASE: C64GS, CHRISTMAS PRICE: C64GS CARTRIDGE, .99 ITOTAL RECALL OCEAN The film's been and gone, and Ocean's platform Recall frolic still isn't complete! Release details are a bit vague, but the game is nearing completion and looks rather decent, with smooth scrolling and a rather amusing Arnie-sprite! The graphics and sound look rather polished too, so hopes are high for a pretty de cent game... Keep your eyes peeled (oww!) for a future issue of C+VG. RELEASE: SPECTRUM, AMSTRAD, C64, ST, AMIGA.
