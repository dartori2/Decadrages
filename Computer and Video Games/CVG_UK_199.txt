"computer video games NEWS O [PSYGNOSIS REVS UP N64 WIPEOUT MORE N64 DELAYS ood news for N64 owners Psygnosis has announced that it will be supporting the machine with some high-profile PlayStation conversions later this year. First up will be a turbo-charged version of WipEout, which will apparently be an 'evolution of the PlayStation games (ie, it won't be WipEout 3). WipEout 64 will feature similar gameplay to its predeccesor (it's being designed by one of the PlayStation 2097 designers) but with some all-new tracks, and, most excitingof all, a split-screen multiplayer mode that will allow up to four players to race against each other. Pretty cool! Psygnosis' subsequent Nintendo releases have yet to be confirmed, but the speculation is that Formula One '98, Destruction Derby and a new Tomb Raideresque actionadventure game called ODT will be among them. Psygnosis has also announced that it is currently working on its first Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) game, due for release in November. From the sound of it Lander is a 3D version of that ancient arcade classic Gravitar, in which you pilot a lunar lander across alien landscapes and through subterranean caves, dodging laser fire from gun turrets and hauling pods from place to place. If you have one of these new high-capacity DVD drives installed in your PC you can expect the game to supply primo-quality MPEG2 video and Dolby Digital Surround Sound, but if you're not that wealthy you can play the slightly cut-down version on your 'old-fashioned CD-ROM or PlayStation. Surprise, surprise. The word on the street is that the release date for Nintendo's forthcoming blockbuster RPG, Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, has been put back AGAIN, this time until November. And that's just for the USA! Just what else can Shigeru Miyamoto's team be packing into that 256Mbit cart? Also, those of you gagging for the UK version of the rocking snowboard-sim 1080Â° won't be on the shelves till the end of the year. Hopefully someone's spending some extra time making sure the PAL game has no borders. Yeah. N64 SCORES TOP DEVELOPER! TEKKEN TO THE MAX! Vou reckon you're the master of Tekken 3, eh? Well, Namco are currently sorting the spuds from the hot potatoes with their own Tekken 3 tournament. The Japanese round of the tournament was played at the Tokyo Game Show a couple of months back, and the winner is going on to do battle with American all-comers at E3, in a 'Tekken 3 to E3' do. Unfortunately, there are currently no plans to follow this up by bringing the tournament to Europe. The game isn't out officially until September, but surely the time would then be right for Namco or Sony to hold a European heat followed by a proper world championship. If you agree, send a postcard, marked, OI! WE WANT A FIGHT!, to the usual CVG address and we will pass on your outrage to the relevant people. DAYTONA RIDES ONLINE WITH CVG 99 NEWS Ve thought you'd like to see another early shot from Sega's next blockbuster Model 3 arcade game, Daytona USA 2: Battle on the Edge. The version we've seen only had one track, an oval circuit set inside a dome, but nevertheless the game is looking quite impressive. As in the original Daytona USA, the racing is in a no-holds barred, bump-'em-up, with body panels and boot lids flying. Generally it looks like Scud Race crossed with Saturn Daytona CCE. It's due in an arcade near you during the summer and we'd be surprised if SOUND it didn't make it as an early Katana release too. t's that time of the year again the Electronics Entertainment Expo is coming. E3, where all the coming year's hot new games and hardware are premiered takes place between May 27th and 29th in Atlanta. We'll be there and we'll bring you all the gen on the aformentioned cool gear in next month's issue. If you can't wait till mid-June to read about it, though, git yo' ass on the Internet and head to our very own www.game-online.com where we'll be bringing you live E3 updates with screenshots, announce ments and show reports as things hap pen!

"computer Video games [ FIRST KATANA GAMES ON SHOW] BUSHIDO LATE 1 emember D2, Warp's super-fancy adventure that was originally destined for Matushita's M2 console then moved over to Katana? Well, the Japanese developers are expected to be previewing the game on the new Sega hardware at their Japanese HQ on May 19th. Ordinarily this would make the game a cert for an E3 showing, but as we go to pres rumours abound that Katana may not be on display at the Atlanta game expo at all. The word is that Sega US' CEO, Bernie Stolar, is still waiting for the nod from his Japanese masters before he can show off the machine. In our humble opinion it seems more likely that Katana WILL be on display, but only behind closed doors, to approved or prospective developers as well as members of the press including us, hopefully! nyone looking forward to Bushido Blade, mentioned in CVG last month, will be disappointed to hear that the game probably won't be appearing in Europe for a while. Squaresoft has announced that it won't be publishing any thing else in Europe until Final Fantasy VIII is released on PlayStation some time in 1999. Bummer!

The company is remaining tight-lipped about the details, but it has been reported that the machine will have a high-res mono LCD screen like the Game Boy, as well as a link facility. Suggested price tag for the machine is between around $28, which will probably translate to around -. Apparently Bandai has 30 titles ready to roll out with the machine (amongst them, almost certainly, will be some kind of Tamagotchi variant) and is in negotiation with third-party developers to get more underway.

We cover only the biggest games, and the ones that we know our readers want to see. Res Evil 2 was top of the Most Wanted chart for at least 4 months, so how can we NOT give a game as popular as that a large amount of coverage? Dear CVG, In last months issue, you reviewed a game called Iznogoud in your mini reviews section. You described the game as \"rubbish, dross, crap, garbage, cack, drivel, hogwash, pish, rot, plop, turd, balls, tat, junk.\" I beg to differ, The game is exciting, superbly animated, exciting, has brilliant sounds and the enemies are some of the best I've seen! Yes, the game is a phenomenal experience, rich in originality and brilliance. Shame on CVG for all its ridicule, you obviously don't know a good game when you see one. M. Sidhu, Wolverhampton. MONEY FOR NOTHING Dear CVG, As a great fan of your magazine, I must inform you that I was disgusted with the April Fools jokes in issue #197. With Yoshi's Story on the cover and details of a Resident Evil 2 special, I was looking forward to getting home and reading my 12th issue of your usually fantastic magazine. But I was in for a disappointment. As my first ever CVG experience was the April edition of 1997, I was completely taken in by your nude cheat for Tomb Raider and the feature on \"Ultimate Fighting Universe\". When I read the next issue, realising these were petty jokes, I handled my disappointment and got on with my life. Even though you lied to me, I stuck with your magazine and reached my 12th issue today. But these jokes were pathetic. With knowledge that the world already knew that your Tomb Raider cheat was made up, you went right ahead and did the same thing for TR2, only this time the song was Never Ever by All Saints. Surely noboby could fall for this awful lie. So the bottom line is if you're going to make jokes like this, at least try to be original. I shall now put this issue with my collection, and try to forget this ever happened. Simon Mealing, Manchester. CVG: Er, yeah... Anyway, can you believe we had more letters and calls from people trying to be clever by spotting Iznogoud as the April Fool when it is a genuine game! Blimey... WIN A CONSOLE AND FIVE GAMES Dear CVG I am writing to say why don't games makers give incentives for finishing games, such as money off vouchers for their other games or follow up titles. For example, finish Tomb Raider and get a fiver off Tomb Raider 2, which would also boost sales on older titles. But how can this be done you're saying? Easy. At the end of the game you get a code number sacred to each game disc, to stop people from cheating. You then ring a phone number, quote your code and hey presto, A voucher in the post. Great idea or what? Paul Hough, Cheshire. I WANT MORE SHOGI CVG: The amount of hassle that would cause is enough for companies to not bother with that sort of thing. But if a game is insanely difficult or boring, would you really bother playing it all the way through? We think not. CVG: We can't believe the amount of people that are so desperate to see Lara nude! A bit worrying really. Haven't had a real girlfriend for a while then? While we're on the subject of April Fools though... GOAL! OFFSIDE! FOUL! REF! Dear CVG, I recently found a flaw in your otherwise amazing magazine and that is your coverage of games in development. Being a CVG addict, get it every month and every month I get a preview of some of the better looking games currently having the finishing touches put on, then more information the following month and then low and behold, there's another four page spread been spent on a game that I've already had tons of info on. Let's take Resident Evil 2 for example. Sure, it's one of the biggest PlayStation releases of the year, but did you really need to do a preview of it four months running and give it the front cover twice? Soon it will be up for review, and you'll no doubt devote some more space on this game that I, owning an N64 and PC have no interest in. So shouldn't you give an up-and-coming game just the one preview and a review when it is released? David Oliver, Perth, Scotland. BRING OUT THE DUNCE CAP Dear CVG, I have a distress call. Please tell me if the Vectron Powerskin 3000XR is either connected to your system, or has a pack on it you put the game in? And why is cheap? Adam Moran (hard man), Leec Dear CVG, My letter is in response to the thousands of brain dead morons out there who believe FIFA to be superior to Actua Soccer 2 and ISS 64. Real names? So what? And besides, both ISS and Actua feature full team edit modes. FIFA may have big name commentators, but their performances on the games are truly appalling, slow and exaggerated. Actua's commentary is almost perfect and ISS doesn't pretend to be something it isn't, like FIFA. FIFA is slow, unresponsive and the graphics are, as usual, grim and depressing. Anyone who believes FIFA has superior gameplay deserves to have their testicles ripped off and nailed to their head. I hope I have made my point clearly. I see that there are many fine looking football Dear CVG, If you know of anyone who fell fo Tomb Raider 2 nude cheat, can give me their phone numbers so I can sell them some inflatable dart boards. Peter Cook, London, SW15. CVG: Because we are and have always been a multi format mag, some readers are going to disagree with the coverage we give to games that they won't be play. ing.

"computer video games BUZZER BEATERS STAR LETTER YOSHI CAN SHOVE HIS STORY! Dear CVG, I love your mag and FreePlay, which Microsoft Word isn't recognising and thinks should be foreplay! Woody@woodysoft.woodynet.co.uk. CVG: Well, Steve thought this was funny. But then Steve does have a strange sense of humour. Dear CVG, Tu Computer and Video Games. I ritted in becusie I fink I lyke th Plastoshan. Plese put me leter in your mag plese. Tom Pulford, Odiham, Hants. Dear CVG, I felt I had to air my opinions here, as in the last months edition of CVG, the last straw had been placed. What am I talking about? Yoshi's Story. Well, not just that game, but many other N64 titles as well. The thing is, I am foolhardy enough to pay the full whack of  on the first day of release for my N64. But I was not really bothered that much by that, as I knew deep down that the extra money that Nintendo raised from the first few months of their machine being on sale for that price would be very well spent on ensuring a top notch line up for us punters However, after Mario 64 a whole string of poor quality games came out many of them after being hyped up to obscene levels, Shadows of the Empire being the prime example... what a let down! The N64 went through a fantastic phase around October when such gems as Lylat Wars, Diddy Kong and Goldeneye were released. But now it seems we are back to square one again with the release of Yoshi's Story. I know you rated it fairly highly, but many other mags have given it an OK score, which I personally think is not good enough. If I wanted OK games, I could have got a Jaguar with a whole range of mediocre titles, but I expect a lot more from the first true 64 bit console. The trouble with Nintendo is that they hype up all their games to the Nth degree, but when you finally get to play them it's like \"Is that it?\" To finish off I'd like to say that I am a huge Nintendo fan, don't get me wrong. But I think that the time has come for Nintendo to pull their thumbs out of their arses and to treat the gamesplayers of the nation to proper conversions and a good line up of games that have had a lot of time spent on them. If Nintendo cannot manage to do that? Well, Sony may find themselves with a lot of new customers. Dear CVG, I'm sorry about my son's handwriting and spelling, but he's dyslexic. Please put him into your mag though. Mrs Pulford (Presumably), Odiham, Hants. CVG: Both these came in the same envelope. And even though the first letter was in scribble, it did have one line of decent writing. Strangly, it was the same as the second letter. But we had to edit the second letter because it had tons of mistakes as well! Even Steve didn't laugh at this. Dear CVG, Whatever happened to the Splatterhouse series? It was more downright creepy/spooky than Resident Evil or House of the Dead and yet everyone has forgotten about it. It was way ahead of its time. Why doesn't the second one come out on the PlayStation? Bungalow Bill, Southend. AND FIVE GAMES WIN A CONSOLE Dear CVG, Can I have some news about Cabbage on the 64? Mark, Handsworth, Birmingham. CVG: It seems that the better the machines get, the more loyalty disappears from the games market. Punters who were once completely dedicated to a company have now lost their rose tinted spectacles and are fully fledged consumers. Money is more of an object, because video games are so much more mainstream, and as a result the quality control from companies comes down as they just want to make some cash. Once loyal buyers become disillusioned as they feel they are being taken for a ride. This could turn out to be Nintendo's and maybe Sony's downfall. CVG: Don't bother. It's rotten. Go for Carrots instead. Dear CVG, You may think I'm flaming mad, but I back Francis Powderly fully. Playing ISS has made me reconsider which game to get for my birthday. It's absolutely confusing. I must give ISS a bit of credit because the commentary is hilarious, but who is the voice? Sam Leivers, Moseley, Birmingham. MET BUY YOUR OWN GAMES CVG! games arriving this summer. World League Soccer and Three Lions look promising, and of course there's ISS 2. Oh, and a \"revised\" World Cup edition of FIFA, which is different in that and I quote the official Nintendo magazine \"It is now easier to stop the ball going out for a throw.\" I wonder which one you'll all buy...? Peter Lomas, Radcliffe, Manchester. Dear CVG, I would like to say to all the reviewers out there, imagine if you actually had to pay for the games you review (come on, dip into those pockets!). If you did, I'm sure you would be a lot tougher on them as it's easy to give a game good marks when you get them for nothing. (I'm afraid this sometimes applies to you CVG!). I've played many of the games that have got high marks and would have been gutted to have parted with my hard earned cash! Robert McMahon, Herne Bay, Kent. Dear CVG, I'm afraid that some people who think FIFA '98 is better than ISS are totally wrong. Oooh, so it's got more teams. Oooh, so it's got more camera angles. At least ISS isn't so jerky that you can't play it. Stuart Johnson, Dunstable. CVG: We are doing the games companies a favour by covering their games in our magazine, so the least they could do is give us a free copy of the game. We sometimes get to keep games we've reviewed, but if we really want something, we do what you do buy it. In fact, at least five of us bought Tekken 3 on the day it came out in Japan. Dear CVG, I am writing to correct the mistake which Francis Powderly made on his letter about FIFA '98. He describes it as \"...a quality game.\" I disagree! ISS is a class game from Konami, and no other game shall ever beat the graphics or its pure gameplay. If a game ever does end up better than ISS, it would most probably be in a wet dream! I agree with Scott of Blackpool in whay he says. \"FIFA is a bad game.\" also agree with what CVG rated the game, two out of five! This is pure evidence of a crappy game to avoid in as many ways as possible. As for who does the commentary and what different camera angles there are (and ISS has nine for the record), who gives a shit! The game should be so good that you should not care/notice either of these points. He is also right when he talks about games that are complete toss selling really well. Surely though people aren't as shallow as to buy it just for the name of the game? Dean 'Olcean' Ollivant, Barnsley, South Yorkshire. LETTERS Dear CVG, I've been thinking recently. Why is it that all of the best game developers are in Japan? Okay, we've got Rare but that's about it. As for America, you can take your pick from a long line of classic games such as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and of course, Cruis'n USA. Japan on the other hand has teams like Capcom, Konami, Sonic Team, Square, Nintendo and Sega's AM departments. So are Japanese programmers just naturally talented or is it something in the Sushi? CVG: Paul eats loads of Sushi. Which means that Japanese programmers must be naturally gifted. Work it out. 13 "

Make way for PlayStation oon the whole world will be competing in the third King Of Iron Fist Tournament 3. Which means you're going to need to start training right now! Luckily, Grand Master CVG will be with you all the way, so that you'll be ready to take on anyone who dares challenge you. We start with some theory. The Tekken series boasts one of the most complex, and rewarding command systems ever invented. We show you how this has developed. We also remind you how much the visual style has improved! 2034 2035 200 3DS NAMCO LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED REPE THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 IT'S GETTING BETTER (MAN! The Tekken series has improved consistently so far Tekken 2 improved on the first game in every way, and Tekken 3 does the same again. Namco have taken full advantage of the technology available to them, and have developed a much cooler look to the game. Here are a few of the major changes, some of which are more obvious than others. ta AUUMPLEUE MANEUVER First of all, Tekken 3's graphics are incredible. You may not think that they're all that much of an improvement over the previous games, but take a look at the old Tekken games and you'll see. Not only are the characters far more detailed, but they also look much more stylish than they ever did before just take a look at Yoshimitsu in the first Tekken if you need proof! As well as the game looking more stylish, there have been big improvements on the technical side. Tekkens 1 and 2 ran on the System 11 arcade board which is basically a PlayStation in a cabinet. Tekken 3 was created for the System 12 board which runs around 1.5 times faster, giving Namco the opportunity to improve the graphics. For the home version the team spent a lot of time compressing all of the game data in order to fit it into the PlayStation's internal memory, but have managed to do it brilliantly! Tekken 3's graphics run in the PlayStation's high-resolution mode at 60 frames per second, with some of the most detailed characters yet seen in a fighting game! Fantastic! COMING SOON Here's how Yoshimitsu has looked in the three Tekken games. Quite a difference. 35 This is Kazuya Mishima Jin's father who was possessed by an evil spirit. He got killed after Tekken 2 by the God Of Fighting. WINET Just try playing one of the old Tekken games after you've got used to Tekken 3. It's not easy! 14 "


"RENDERED USELESS computer video games TEKKEN 1 TEKKEN 2 TEKKEN 3 Just to show how the Tekken series has improved in terms of style, take a look at the rendered sequences. When we first saw Tekken 1 and 2's moves we were blown away, but they look very basic when compared to Tekken 3. See the rendered Ninas on the right. KING -XIAOYU PlayStation Just look at sexy Nina in her original Tekken outfit. What lovely clogs! Namco struggled to fit all of King's animation in Tekken 2, but they've crammed three times as much into Tekken 3! ANNABAEKUMI WHO NEVER HEUTE HIM Tekken 3's line-up of characters is also Bosses who are basically using the quite different to Tekken 2's. A fair same moves as the original default number of the original's fighters are still characters. With the Tekken 2 arcade in the game, but other characters have machine you can see how many times been replaced. The producer of the players choose characters, and we Tekken series, Hajime Nakatani, found that the Sub Bosses were not explained how the team decided which really used much. We instead decided fighters to keep and which to remove in to increase the number of moves each a recent interview with CVG: \"In Tekken character can perform, and remove the 2 we have the characters called the Sub characters which were used the least.\" BI THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 MITSU MITSU The textures are now single \"skins\" which are stretched over the characters, rather than the usual separate pieces. Baek Doo San may have been slaughtered by the God Of Fighting, but his moves live on. Ogre can do a few of Baek's old kick combos. OGRE NINA Unfortunately Wang Jinrey isn't in Tekken 3, but his super-powerful unblockable attack is! Ogre can do 100% damage if this hits properly. . LEI EINACHE COMING SOON A to DUKEIDSET There have been a lot of subtle changes to the physics in Tekken 3. Most of these will only be spotted by the most hardcore gamers (maybe the timing of one of their combo hits will be half a second different to the way it was in Tekken 2) but they're changes which balance the fighters and make the fights more entertaining. How many can you spot? One thing a Tekken 2 player will notice straight away the fighters don't jump as high as they used to. 15 "


"computer Video games CONTROL YOURSELF COMBO MUMBO IMRI The Tekken series uses a unique four-button control system. According to the game's producer, \"In other games, sometimes players can win by just tapping one single button. We didn't want to make it that easy, so to perform a left-right punch combination you need to press Left Punch, then Right Punch. We wanted to make a more technical game.\" If you're going to win at Tekken 3, you need to learn how to string moves together to create combination attacks (\"combos\" to those in the know). There are two basic types of combo in Tekken 3: * STRING COMBOS These are where you simply hit attack buttons in the right order so that they link together into a sequence and make it practically impossible to block. The longest of these combos are 10 hits long, and can take quite a while to learn properly you need to memorise the button sequence, AND you need to master the exact timing! The Practice Mode shows you how to do a few of these 1 0-hit combos for each character. PlayStation Another, more effective way of hitting your opponent repeatedly without them being able to block is with floating combos. Certain attacks will knock the other fighter into the air, giving you the chance to hit them again and again before they land. With a bit of practice you can figure out ways of keeping them in the air for as long as possible, though it takes perfect timing to get more than five or six powerful hits. REPLAY This punch looks a lot more powerful than it really is. It's simple to perform, but it stuns for just long enough. Oof. King's running elbow is bound to hurt Paul's bearded chin. If this move had been ducked, King would be in trouble. UNBLOCKABLE AT JACKS! THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 PERFETTI PERFEC Most of Tekken 3's fighters have special unblockable attacks. These are normally simple to do (often just pressing two buttons and a direction together) but take a long time to charge up to a few seconds for some. Though they leave you exposed to attacks from your opponent, if you manage to get one of these moves to connect it'll do masses of damage. And the best thing is, they can't be blocked! Just look at how much damage this unblockable attack does if it hits! 100%! LAW PERFECTI COMING SOON Here's Ogre performing Wang Jinrey's old 100% damage unblockable attack. Unlike Tekken 2, some characters can counter certain unblockable attacks. IN, OUT, SHAKE IT ALL ABOUT Another new addition to the Tekken series is the ability to sidestep into and out of the screen. A double-tap of the direction pad either up or down will make any of the fighters dodge around the arena slightly, letting them evade attacks and get into a more useful position. The ability to move around like this varies between fighters, as some can only move a small way while others take big steps around. 16 After dodging Heihachi's attack, Ling Xiaoyu uses one of her side throws on him. "


"computer Video games These are five of the 10 hits in one of Yoshimitsu's best string combos. Some of the hits can be blocked, but it's not an easy task. PlayStation This five-hit floating combo of Hwoarang's is relatively easy to do. The best thing about it is that there's no way for someone to block it. DON\"T COUNTER ON IT Counter attacks play a bigger part in Tekken 3's fights than in previous games. Many of the characters have the ability to defend against moves, then attack before their opponent has time to recover, though the timing isn't easy. You need to learn the fighting style of whoever you're playing against and be able to predict what they're going to do next. There's nothing more soul-destroying than repeatedly having attacks countered against you. As Tiger attacks, Jin initiates his counter attack and avoids the hit. Jin sidesteps and knocks Tiger's leg away, making him fall to his knees. And bang! There's the counter attack right on his elbow. Very cool indeed. It's possible to counter some jumping attacks like this, but it looks as though Jin missed his chance here. THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 THROW COUNTERS Oh dear. It looks like this could hurt. You can also break out of throws easily enough. Simply pressing Left Punch and Left Kick at the same time is enough to get out of most grabs, but a few need special techniques. EWIN1 If someone's sitting on you, kick them off! REPLAY 12 HWOARANG GUN JACK KING Paul twists Law's leg and spins him away. COMING SOON As someone gets hold of you, press the correct counter buttons to push them away. You can break out of long throw combos at any point if you're good enough. Paul can even turn some throws against his attacker, such as this one where he performs a piledriver as King attempts his Frankensteiner throw. Get the timing just right, or this'll hurt! And Law takes all the damage! Coolio! 17 "


"computer video games PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT TOTAL UMGED DMG 0140127% COUNTER 3 COMBO 29 DAMAGE How do you become a great Tekken 3 player? Katsuhiro Harada, one of the game's designers says, \"First of all, practice each move 100 times before going to sleep. Also, always play with someone who is better than you. Never be satisfied beating any player who is not better than yourself. If you keep on practising against good players, anyone can become a great player. From there, players can develop their own combinations, moves and tactics.\" PlayStation Tekken 3 has an excellent Practice Mode which lets you try out combos and moves against dummy characters who can be made to do whatever you want. You can practice the timing of counter attacks, throws, and even learn 10-hit combos with an on-screen button display. One particularly cool new feature is that Practice Mode will even teach you a few basic floating combos. AY-MAY-ZING! Tekken games are well known for their impressive moves, and Tekken 3 adds a load of new attacks which will blow you away! The most amazing moves certainly aren't easy to do, as you can see from the example on the right one of King's new throw combos. PlayStation REPLAY = SELECT Poop Freeze Display shows your recovery times. TUTAL ONU: 89 DNC:05C 100%) TOTAL UNCED TEKKEN FORCE YOURSELF 17 COMBO 59 DATACE As we pointed out in last month's Tekken 3 feature, the PlayStation version has plenty of features which weren't in the arcade game. The biggest of these is Tekken Force Mode the sideways-scrolling fighting section where you must battle against Heihachi Mishima's private army to rescue his most valuable prisoner! You can play as anyone you want and can use any of their moves, including all their combos and throws. *A BACK STREES -803880838 THE CLOTHES SHOW The first section is set in a small town, with masses of Tekken Force troops coming at you. Most of them only take one hit before disappearing. We thought you might like to see proof that the hidden schoolyard background is in the PlayStation version as well as the arcade game. Once you've collected Jin and Xiaoyu's school costumes, pick them and you'll get to fight in the playground with a nearby football goal. A few of the other fighters have bonus costumes. Law has a Game Of Death-style outfit. Gun Jack can be made to look like the original Jack robot, and Anna has a fancy party outfit complete with matching hat! Very nice. * THE WILDS THE KING OF IRON FIST TOURNAMENT 3 GANE20788QOLD 12ASO Get Gun Jack's \"Good\" ending movie to collect his original Tekken 1 outfit. Here he is beating up Tiger, who is basically an extra costume for Eddy Gordo. Next you travel to the desert. Most of the enemies here are easy enough, but they come from all angles to make things a bit more tricky than before. Hwoarang can do Master Baek's old triple jumping kick. REPLAY REPLAY * IN THE DARK SCORE 5921 Stage three is set in underground caves with a spotlight to let you see what's going on. There are some slightly tougher enemies to be found in here. COMING SOON REPLAY MISHIMA FOHRESS On the final stage you need to fight your way uphill through Heihachi's base until you meet the big man himself. Beat him to get a key which will come in handy later... "

QUtcast utcast places you in a strange parallel world called Adelpha. You play a butch hero, who goes by the manly name of Cutter Slade. He's ventured into this world through a mysterious portal, and now he's got a problem to solve. In a plot not dissimilar to the scifi movie Stargate, he's joined by a crack team, and together they must find a missing probe and reassemble it using components they have brought with them. Of course, that's all easier said than done. IT'S THE REAL THING EXPLORE A PERILOUS WORLD WITHIN YOUR PC! 31 \"I don't want to buy your son\" Outcast mixes several popular styles of game into a whole new experience. You could play the game as a straightforward shoot'em-up, but pretty soon you'd find yourself at a dead-end in terms of progress. What's novel about Outcast is that it offers a new world to explore, complete with strange creatures and all kinds of people. If you're to succeed you have to learn to communicate with them. The character interaction is handled by an artificial intelligence routine that the makers are calling behavioural legibility, which supposedly makes it easy to understand what the inhabitants think of Cutter. \"Hello birds, hello trees\"  That's a big looking place, there's lots of people to meet and chat with in there. DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD In Outcast, t's better to ask questions first and shoot approach people they'll run away. There are also later.

There's only one way to find out! 22 \"Steal my wallet would ya?\" "


"HOW DO THEY DO THAT? computer video games Outcast uses a graphics engine that provides spectacular 3D visuals without the need for a 3D card. Appeal have used a mixture of Voxels (as seen in games like Commanche) and polygons to create a more realistic world. The Voxels are used for background design, and can create more realistic-looking landscapes than polygons, and so, even if you do have a 3D card in your PC it makes no difference to the look of the game. The team have also used something called Bump Mapping, which creates a very detailed display with a low level of polygons on screen. What all this means is the game will play on what is now considered to be a low-end Pentium system. ROM 1 The weapons all produce fancy effects. 1 The landscapes offer a lot of variety. 1 Voxels allow for more realistic terrain. WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE? We'll quickly mention the games soundtrack, because it is one of the best we've ever heard. There's over 55 minutes of a full orchestral score recorded for the game, and it has all the grandeur of the best symphonic scores. Composed by Lennie > More and recorded with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, the end result tricks you into thinking you're in a movie, and there's nothing wrong with that. EXPLORE A PERILOUS WORLD WITHIN YOUR PC! Cutter can even relax and swim in this lovely hotel resort, with stunning views of the moon. Hey Cutter, stop shooting the trees you thug. You're an ambassador for the planet Earth! GOT, GOT, NEED. GOT The new world is very realistic, with a fully working eco-system, a food chain and a trading system. The animal population comprises prowling carnivores that hunt among the herds of less dangerous creatures, and there are even some animals that can be domesticated. Just like the animals, you need to find food and water, not only to survive but also to trade for new weapons and information. COMING SOON KURT RUSSELL WHERE ARE YOU?

GADGETS AND GUNS IN MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE ission: Impossible was originally going to be one of the Nintendo 64's European launch games, set to come out when the movie was still fairly fresh in people's minds. All manner of problems have delayed its release for well over a year, but it's now all coming together. Licence troubles (you may remember we said that Tom Cruise didn't want his face to be used in the game) certainly didn't help. Since our last look at the game many months ago, all of the stages have been added and many of the planned ideas have been included, so hopefully Mission: Impossible will see the light of game store shelves very soon. Maybe they'll get it out in time for the movie's first BBC TV showing . MISSIONS: POSSIBLE Mission: Impossible is a game based very much on stealth. Like Goldeneye and the forthcoming Metal Gear Solid, using your brains and sneaking around without being seen is the best way of completing your mission. Get spotted and a gun battle could break out, and these are best avoided. Shootouts are especially hard work in Mission: Impossible, so do your best to avoid them. Take a look at your minicomputer and you'll see such orders as 'Sabotage the pump house' and 'Assume ambassador's aide's ID'. Each mission has a set number of objectives for you to complete, just like in Goldeneye, and figuring out the best way to do each of them can be the most challenging part. OBJECTIVES Darn, toxic gas! My equipment is on the table behind that window, and the door behind is open Get the AF scrambler. Get the mine Bring Clutter A.F.S. and mine. Get the gas injector. Get the RC detonator Get the explosives. Sabotage the pump house. Regroup on com. building. A fireman? How strange. Must figure out how to escape! Darn that toxic gas to heck! Checking your objectives. COMING SOON HEY, NICE MOTORI You don't spend the entire game on foot you get the chance to try out the occasional vehicle. For example, after finishing the first snowy operation you hop into a handy boat and destroy everything you can with its cannons. Keep an eye out for any other opportunities.  Check out the massive guns on the boat! "


"THE GADGET SHOP computer Video games As Ethan Hunt you get to use plenty of cool spy bits and pieces. For a start, you have your little communicator a pocket computer which gives you all your mission briefings and lets you keep in touch with the rest of the IMF team. This is the most used piece of kit, but there are plenty more gadgets and bits of equipment which you have to find and pick up as you play. Here are some of the most used bits and pieces from early on. NINTENDO I need to find the AFS and the mine for clutter. Look around for weapons. There are quite a few around the various missions, and they certainly come in handy. The night vision goggles are used throughout the tunnel missions, making everything look very green. Use the detonator to set off the explosives in the submarine pen at the start of the game. TONIGHT MATTHEW, I'M GOING TO BE... The must be a ventilation duet. Ethan Hunt is a master of disguise, and you get to use a load of different identities when playing Mission: Impossible. Because the missions vary greatly (one minute you're creeping around in the snow, the next you're a guest at a fancy party). Ethan changes costume accordingly, though there are times when you'll need to dress up to get through a mission. For example, getting out of the crowded embassy could be tricky so you need to set up gas canisters around the building, then dress up as a fireman and creep out unnoticed! You even get to wear a dress at one point! GADGETS AND GUNS IN MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE This is a rendered impression of the game. Looks great, doesn't it? BANG BANG, YOU'RE DEAD Better watch my ammo If you get into a situation where using your gun is unavoidable, you just hold the right shoulder button to go into shooting mode. The view will zoom in until it's just behind your character's head and a red crosshair will appear, again like Goldeneye. To make it possible to see what's going on, your head becomes translucent, letting you see everything on the other side. The crosshair means that you can line up your shots perfectly. You get warnings when you're running low on ammunition. COMING SOON... HOPEFULLY Mission: Impossible is supposed to be coming out sometime this summer, and we're hoping to be able to review it very soon. The big question is: Will it be able to stand up against Rare's fantastic Goldeneye? Sounds impossible to us, but we could be wrong...

NO OTHER COMPLETE VERSIONS PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD TM OUT WINTER 1 PLAYER PlayStation s  RELEASED BY KONAMI TEL 01895 853 000 PlayStation The most eagerly awaited piece of software in the history of games. Not quite yet, but in a few months time, you'll all be down the shop demanding this game! THE BIGGEST PLAYSTATION GAME OF THE YEAR? t's been in development for what seems an eternity, and you could be forgiven for thinking the game is never going to get released, but the good news is that Metal Gear Solid is almost here. The breakthrough came at the Spring Tokyo Game show. Until this date, the game had been something of a myth, only appearing at shows in the form of a video. Many thought that MGS was simply too good to be true, and as such was nothing more than a pipe dream. Of course all that's now changed. At the aforementioned show, MGS appeared not on a huge video wall, but as a playable demo! For the first time, members of the public experienced what all the fuss was about. They left with smiles on their faces. Remember from here until release, it's no longer hype, this game is the real thing! METAL GEAR SOLID HE'S HAVING A VERY BAD DAY HEY, IT'S THE SHADOW! The You are Solid Snake, an ex-member of an turned bad and are now fronting their own elite troop of soldiers established to combat terrorist organisation. They've taken control terrorism. In the tradition of all the best of a military installation in Alaska and have action heroes, Snake is about to embark on taken control of all equipment in that base, a dangerous mission alone. That mission is including nuclear missiles. Snake has 24 to eliminate his ex-colleagues. That's right, hours to infiltrate the base, blow everything members of the elite band of soldiers have up and save the day. Da 55.85 COMING SOON THE guards were in hot pursuit, but hiding here has outfoxed them! It's quiet too quiet! 2 The action is set in a military installation and is patrolled by guards who wander around the facility, There are also video cameras everywhere and you could be spotted at any time. This mission isn't going to be easy. Snake faces seemingly insurmountable, odds. Then there's another small problem Snake starts the game unarmed, equipped only with a pair of binoculars and a pack of cigarettes. So it he's gonna get anywhere, you need to think and act fastwhich is the main point about MGS. This isn't just a Doom clone with excellent graphics, it's something much better than that. MGS requires you to use all your cunning to infiltrate this base, using stealth as a weapon and go about your mission as quietly and efficiently as possible. #49 What happens next? You can crawl under the tank to evade the guards. 28 "


"I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE video computer games The best way to describe the gameplay is to compare it to a game of hide-and-seek, but with guns, and the fate of the world at stake. You must try and stay hidden from the guards at all times, and only try to tackle them when you know it's safe. Each guard follows their own set agenda, patrolling the base and even taking breaks at intervals. There are several ways of alerting them. In the upper right of the screen is a radar which displays the whereabouts of guards. It also displays their field of vision and if Snake enters their field of vision, he has only a few seconds to escape before trouble arrives. In these situations it really is best to run away. The enemies are also quite smart, being alerted to or spotting signs of your presence, for example they may spot footprints in the snow, or hear splashes if you walk through a puddle. PlayStation  Luckily with a not very subtle device, you can spot the status of guards by a symbol that appears above their head. A question mark indicates the guard is puzzled, an exclamation mark means trouble as the guard has spotted you. Best of all are a load of Z's, which of course means the guard has nodded off! WANT SOME OF THIS? HIDING BEHIND THE SILOS, TAKE 27. ACTION! Es 99.59 There are over 20 weapons in the game, but when you're unarmed you still have a good chance of survival. This is because the safest way to take someone out is to sneak up behind them, and put them in a strangle hold. There's an action button which fires all weapons, but when unarmed it'll result in Snake throwing punches. Press it several times and he'll do a punch, punch, kick combo. He can't kill an enemy like this, but it will stun them. It's also possible to throw guards, drag them, and use them as a shield! Remember, if you've got a guard in a strangle hold, you're just a few button presses away from breaking their neck! THE BIGGEST PLAYSTATION GAME OF THE YEAR? JEP  # 99.59 ** 20 There are several different camera modes to view the action. The main viewpoint is overhead, with Snake at the centre, allowing you to get a good view of the immediate area. In first-person mode you can rotate through 360 degrees to observe your surroundings. You'll use this mode to check out the enemy from a distance. Once you're happy with the surroundings you'll switch to an automatic viewpoint. Using this, it's possible to hide behind walls and view an enemy, without them seeing you. Finally there's the Intruder mode. This is similar to the first person viewpoint, but here you can move around. This is the most dangerous mode as you can be seen, and you also lose your map and radar. You can sneak and crawl under objects, such as trucks, in this mode. At PO Ooh, the family jewels, that's gotta hurt. Oh no his friend has spotted the tussle, no problem. Come on! The greatest escape! DIRST DASS DICKET DO DOTTINGHAM Sound is of major importance in the game, Snake has a transmitter built into his skull which allows him to speak to other characters in the game. You can call them for advice on weapons, or tactics in defeating guards and bosses. Essentially it's an in-game manual. There's also speech in the game, and you can even overhear guards talking, sometimes offering unintentional clues. Finally there's the bad sounds, the sounds that give away your position. Worst, but most brilliant of these, is a sneeze. Remember the game is set in Alaska, and it's pretty cold there, SO much so that later in the game it's possible for Snake to catch a cold! This game's going to be awesome. METLGAR MAYBE YOU SHOULD HIRE THE A-TEAM The sneeze is the clincher. It's attention to detail and touches of realism like this that make Metal Gear Solid so impressive, and why we're getting very excited We'll be keeping you up to date with developments from now until release at the end of the year. We can't really show you sounds on a page, so here's the intro/title screen instead. Wow! 29 "

And it isn't just the bouncing chests that keep you interested. This variation of the Virtua Fighter engine has a clean graphic style, and a fluid command system. It's easy to thrill over the look of this game, but the breakthrough is in the control. Even the combat arenas hold some surprises. Yes, though we know you cannot wait for Tekken 3, do yourself a favour by taking Dead or Alive into consideration. We won't need to twist your arm too much to convince you PS DOA will be here to stay, starting June. MORE BEEF! MORE BOUNCE! The guys who created Dead or Alive reckon they can make their game look great on any thing. Which is true they made DOA look absolutely awesome on the Saturn. Naturally the PlayStation version benefits greatly from Tecmo's expertise, and the characters in DOA appear very elaborate indeed. Great-looking fighters, then. Still this is at the expense of the 3D backgrounds which characterise the arcade version. This is no big deal, but arcade purists will be quick to point this out. Well, we thought you should know. PlayStation gets two extra characters, however, giving you more of a challenge than even the arcade original. Plus every character in the game has new costumes a minor thrill, but a nice touch for PlayStation users. Mind you, some of them are pretty weird. 24450 ASUMI OGGLuc 04 SE\"00/04 TINA XIX The two extra characters for PlayStation Dead or Alive are just as good as the original team. Bass Armstrong, the Hulk Hogan look-a-like, has a sidestep move similar to those in Tekken 3 also shared by original fighters Jann-Lee, Bay-Man, and Zack. Ayane, a girl character, is hidden at first. COMING SOON PlayStation DOA doesn't feature 3D backgrounds, but there are some great alternatives, such as Tina's dancefloor scenario. ZAC The fighters in Dead or Alive are large and detailed. They're more stylised than in Tekken not so realistic, but cool in a different way. The movement is also as smooth as Ed Lomas' excuses.  "


"THE BEST FOR EUROPE computer video games Tecmo, specifically the Dead or Alive team, are 100% dedicated to making UK DOA the best it can be. They already have a version up and running which matches the Japanese code in terms of speed. The UK version will also fill the whole screen it will not have black borders sandwiching the display. Even more new costumes are planned for the UK version of PS Dead or Alive. Incidentally, Sony asked CVG for some suggestions for these outfits. We'll let you know if any of them make it into the game. (We thought an SAS character would be cool for Bayman, and, er, school uniforms for Tina and Lei-Fang). -1 \"Q/ 1910 FANG RAIDOU PlayStation Bayman bats Bayman for six! Kasumi looks cute, whatever. Jann-Lee already has cool gear. Raidou looks tough enough! THE SECRET INGREDIENT SOMETHING IN RETURN 2495 GEN-FU Being shuffled 10 miles backwards by a million-hit combo, while blocking, is frustrating. The first guy in the world to do something about this is the producer of DOA Tomonobu Itagaki. Itagaki's intention was to recreate the thrill of a Kung-Fu movie, where you see fighters repeatedly countering hundreds of moves, while trying to sneak in a couple of their own. When a guy (or gal) finally gets through with an incredible combination it's one of the biggest thrills in all entertainment! Now here it is in a game. The secret? One button. 'Hold', which replaces the 'Guard' button in a VF style Guard, Punch, Kick set up. All blocking is, done Street Fighter style, by holding the directional away from the opponent. The new hold button opens up a vast new area, of potential for a fighting game, making Dead or Alive unique. FIRST OF '98'S GREAT PLAYSTATION FIGHTERS 1 By pressing the Hold button players can counter almost any attack in the game, with some wicked results. 2 STUMBLE! 2050 LIET 1 Use Hold to trip the guy then move in while they're unbalanced.

Use this as your excuse for a while anyway. 32 "


"THE VF CONNECTION NOW THEY'RE COOKING computer Video games DO' 05\"50/01 FANG ZACK When CVG spoke to the brain behind Dead or Alive, Itagaki, he revealed that Yu Suzuki the creator of the Virtua Fighter series is his Master, and friend. Their relationship is so close that Suzuki trusted Itagaki with the secret algorithm which allows for the instant translation of commands into moves. Though the command system would still have been impressive, without this secret code the reflex response of Dead or Alive would not have been so perfect. Extra thrills in Dead Or Alive are due to the Danger Zone. This is a pressure-sensitive, booby-trapped zone on the outskirts of the ring. It's okay to walk or jump around in this zone, but a fall always results in a big explosion bouncing the already humiliated party into the air for more punishment. This damages moral! PlayStation BACK FOR THE ATTACK LEI-FANE Dead or Alive originated on Sega's Model 2 arcade board. This is the same technology that launched with Daytona USA, but eventually went on to support groundbreaking fighting games such as Fighting Vipers, and, of course, Virtua Fighter 2. Hence the similarities to Dead Or Alive. A stunning Saturn version of DOA was released in Japan in October 97, and, to coincide with the release of PlayStation DOA, a special new arcade edition will hit the streets (be in an arcade somewhere near you). In all cases the team at Tecmo believe that they have got the best out of the hardware available. Here are a few shots of the different versions for you to compare. 1 As you become more skilled, you learn how to work the Danger Zone into your combo strategies. Drop them in the Danger Zone with a skill sequence, then, as they explode into the air, stick in a few more techniques to extend the combo. 2338 co 01'04\"95/01 LEI-FANE KASUMI Arcade DOA, using Sega's Model 2 technology.

There's still lots of work to be done, but the game is already masses of fun to play. Up until now, we've mostly just had arcade-style rally games such as Sega Rally and V-Rally, but Colin McRae is a lot more realistic the races are done as time trials, and your co-driver's directions are absolutely essential. Intense concentration is required if you're going to avoid long repair stops between stages. Start your engines! COLIN MCRAE RALLY THE BEST RALLY GAME EVER! As you race, mud gets sprayed on your car.

The biggest of these is the two-player split-screen mode, which will let you challenge your friends in head-to-head races. Codemasters have also said that \"Super Special Stages\" will be in the final game, though they haven't yet revealed what this is going to mean. As far as we can tell, this will be a two-player game where the drivers compete on the super sprint rally stages two-lap races with a crossover between laps, featuring jumps and tunnels. Should be great. There's also going to be a Rally School, which will teach you all of the skills you'll need throughout the game itself. There's a possibility that we'll be able to review Colin McRae Rally next month, but that all depends on how development goes. From what we've seen of Colin McRae so far, it certainly looks like the best game of its kind. Full story as soon as possible! 02:42.39 02:46.26 6B 34 Here's a very beaten-up Ford. "

KULA WORLD f Kula World is looking for accolades, then we're prepared to give it one straight away. From now on, this is officially 'the most bizarre puzzle game ever'. Taking the mantle from Sony's last puzzler the brilliant Kurushi. We can see the marketing for this game already, in a Summer season of releases packed with football product, Sony are going to unleash the smartest ball game since Marble Madness. PRECISE BATI CONTROL MIND THE HAD PUZZLE FANS CONTROL YOUR BALLS! The point of the game is to guide the colourful beach ball around some floating 3D mazes. These start off simple enough, but pretty soon you'll be tearing your hair out in the best puzzle game tradition. The mazes are 3D, because you can travel on all sides, provided you reach what appears to be a dead end. Only on these squares are you allowed to turn and move off again on a different side of the maze. In later levels this becomes essential for collecting bonuses. While you're navigating these mazes you must search for keys, for these unlock the exits to progress to the next level. Also along the way, keep an eye out for pieces of fruit. They're usually hidden on another side of the maze. Once you collect five pieces, you'll be whisked away to a special bonus round, even more psychedelic than anything you've already seen. Here you must meet a set challenge in a limited time. Like landing on every square, to change its colour. This game would be pretty easy, if this is all you do. So there are a couple of traps and bad things' on each maze to make your ball control more difficult. The first to rear its head are spikes, these obviously will puncture the ball if you land on top. They are particularly nasty because they're often positioned near a square where you'd land the ball from a jump. Enemies roam later levels, and are best avoided. But our favourite hazard is the pill. The pill speeds the clock up, but slows you down, causing a weird warping effect in the process as if you've been drugged. Hit a pill, and you'll be in a panic to finish the level fast. The effects of drugs on display. Hit a pill and the screen warps and blurs. You also lose all sense of time, really! That's a key up ahead, roll over and get it. 22 BLOCKS LEFT Collect five fruit and you enter a bonus level. Here you must land on every brick in the given time.

ROM SENTINEL RETURNS ver 10 years have passed since The Sentinel first wowed games players. Since then there's been nothing like it. The game was revolutionary, but unlike modern original games, no-one else dared copy its ground breaking style. Now, over a decade later, get ready for the sequel. It's all down to the dedication and hard work of the game's biggest fan. (WHAT'S ILLAM ABOUL ALFIE? The object of the game is to defeat the dreaded Sentinel on each level. You do this by absorbing energy, and redistributing it. Each object in the Sentinel world has an energy value, trees a value of one, boulders two and the players robot husk three. You don't control a cutesy character, or drive a car around the level, this game is a test of your brain. As such, you control an energy pool with a consciousness. You move around the landscape by building robot shells, and transferring your energy into them. Only when you can look down on the Sentinel can you absorb him and complete the level. OOC 000 PEEK-A-BOO! PEEK-A-BOO OOOO 000 HAVE YOU EVER FELT LIKE YOU WERE BEING WATCHED? That's just the start of the brain draining action 'cos, as in every great puzzle game, things are a lot tougher than they first seem. The twist in this game is that the Sentinel, although in a fixed position, is always rotat ing through 360 degrees. Constantly scouring the land for anything with a higher energy than a tree. That means you. If you're spotted, the Sentinel will drain your energy. What makes this quite challenging, is that the Sentinel controls and sits on the highest point in the landscape, so he has a pretty good view of the action. In later levels there are also robot sentries, that act as mini Sentinels. You'll have to figure out a safe, route through the level to survive. 1 Up there, that's the Sentinel that is! 1 A steaming husk. It really is, honest. Ohh. Very atmospheric. You should see and hear it with all the sound and music. Now you too can see the world in new Lomas-vision. The checker board look of the original is still evident in the sequel. Those spindly things are trees. Judging by the leaves, it must be Winter. BELTER UHANJHE ORIGINAT? SEE YOU IN THIRTY Like we said earlier, the sequel is being produced by one of the biggest fans of the original. His name is John Cook, supposedly the only person to ever complete the original game twice. This may not sound that incredible, until you find out that the original game contained 10,000 levels. The sequel doesn't contain any radical new features to detract from the original. The real additions are better visuals, and a better learning curve through the levels. Another major bonus is the soundtrack, being provided by acclaimed Hollywood director John Carpenter. The man responsible for Assault on Precinct 13, Escape from New York and The Thing. You could be mistaken that nothing happens in this game, with all these screenshots looking very similar. We can assure you, to play it is something else. Hopefully we'll have the finished game in our mitts for a review next. month. We can't wait. It'll be like a high school reunion, with CVG being reunited with a very old friend. 38 "

"games FOOTBALL SIM BY EA  MULTIFORMAT PREDECESSORS AVAILABLE  FIFA '99 VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD PlayStation NINTENDO 64 88 OUT NOW OUT NOW 1-4 PLAYERS ROM  RELEASED BY EA TEL 01753 549442 NINTENDO 64 With EA capturing the official licence for the World Cup, would this be just another excuse for them to make more money from their FIFA brand? Maybe not PlayStation ROM fter the last FIFA game, and the two out of five score awarded by us, EA were more than a little wary about showing us this, their latest and possibly most important sports title to date. However, with their renewed optimism about this being the best FIFA on any of the mainstream consoles, we got what we wanted. And, now that we've had the benefit of seeing all three formats, what do we think of it? Well, it looks as though EA have turned away from the shabby spin-offs and finally made a game that recaptures some of the best elements that made FIFA what it is today. Sadly, a Saturn version is not on the cards, but the three other main formats will all see this game, with the PC getting the best version. But why the sudden change of opinion? Well, read on and we'll tell you... Where's the defence? More overhead action! Scissor kicks impress if they come off. Head meet foot, foot mangle head. WHO? WHAT? WHY? EH? Road to World Cup suffered from jerky graphics and some terrible slow-down. Sometimes, it almost felt as though you missed chunks of play as the camera shuddered between players. This time, however, it's been sorted out. Stringing together moves of speed and accuracy something which was virtually impossible previously is now commonplace. Counter-attacks become easi er as a result of this, and a more general feel of control and real ism is added as a result. It makes you wonder how they over looked this before, but at least it's been refined now. The front end is also much easier to negotiate, and you don't need to plough through screen after screen of game options. These are the main differences, and ones which make the game instantly more appealing. But the cool factor gained from Blur and their Song 2 has been lost, as the new 'choon' is Chumbawumba with Tubthumping, the only song to have made to every new 'Best Party Album in the World' compilation last year. REVIEW BORDEA 1 All of the grabs in this box are taken from the N64 version. 46 "


"K THE FAMOUS FIVE compute vided games ELECTRONI When Des Lynam and Andy Gray signed up for Road to World Cup, did anyone really think they could enlist anyone else to add to the dulcet tones of of Motty and co? Probably not, because even though Sky's blank video tapes and rubbish tactics man seems to have been sacrificed, three new faces have been brought in. To aid Mr Motson with the actual in-game sayings is another BBC stalwart, Chris Waddle. As well as that, you also have Gary Lineker providing some analysis. And Kenneth Wolstenholme, who commentated during the famous 1966 World Cup final, adds to the Gary takes a break nostalgic feel of the Classic Mode. What about from stealing crisps that for a commentary dream team? NINTENDO 3 + Chris has yet to say sorry for Diamond Lights PlayStation SOME PEOPLE ARE ON THE PITCH... ROM It's part of the phrase which has to be one of the most famous in football. And as mentioned above, the 'owner' of it also commentates on the newest game mode in World Cup '98, The Classic mode. This option is not available from the start of the game. Instead, it must be earned by first finishing and winning the World Cup. Once you accessed it, you Back in the days have the chance to replay all of old... Can you World Cup finals for yourself.

If you pick a match from, say, the 1930s, you play the game in black and white, the players have huge shorts that come down to their ankles and the JVC ball dynamics are all different to represent the cow's gut it was made from back then. The further forward you go, the better quality picture you get, the shorter and tighter the shorts get and the worse the haircuts become! The Classic mode has been done before, but not quite in the same depth as in World Cup '98. CUP93 WORLD 11.27 ESPORTS SNICKZES 1 Check out those shorts! SLOW AND BORING? PAH! REVIEW Another complaint people had about the previous FIFA was the speed of the game. Players would take ages to get shots in or make tackles because of their animation. This, again, has been rectified in a couple of ways. Firstly, there is an adjustable speed setting for you to toggle at your leisure, until you find a pace that is right for you. The default setting is the slowest, which is still quick enough, but there are an additional three after this which gradually make the game quicker. Also, even though the players still have lots of frames of animation, they are far more instantaneous in their actions. If you want a first time shot, you don't have to wait for seven or eight different moves before you send one goalwards. At least it shows the developers are listening to the criticisms aimed at the previous games. "


"computer Video games NICE AND PC DOES IT Of the three versions we've had, there is no doubting that the PC one is the best. Not only is it the most visually impressive, especially with 3D card acceleration, but is also the slickest to play. There is no jerking and players are more recognisable, based on their appearance.

Generally, there going on on the pitch. It's no real secret that I didn't like the first two FIFA games. They were no fun to play and too easy to master. These were among my many complaints. This time, however, EA have taken a giant step forward by making sensible adjust ments to their basic formula to make a new and improved FIFA concoction. It plays a hell of a lot better than before, and makes it a lot harder to score goals than before. The really cheesy goals are virtually impossible to pull off every time because you rarely find yourself getting the same half chances all the time. And getting a one-on-one is much more difficult too. Somewhat strangely, the default difficulty gauge is set at easiest, which most experienced FIFA addicts will pick up straight away, so we recommend you start playing on Professional, the middle skill, first. In terms of looks, it's impressive as all EA Sports stuff is. And it's one of the only games to include a four-player mode for all formats. The vital ingredient to make it another classic is still missing though, but it's significantly better than abysmal Road to World Cup, which turned out to be one of the best selling games of last year. Oh well... STEVE PES JVC JVC PHILIPS MasterCard REVIEW RATING RATING At last, a new FIFA spin-off that's actually good. Good looking and fun to play, this game gives the licence a much-needed boost.

There is a transfer list which you can pick from, which lets you know of all the immediately available players, but the real coup is when you prize a player away from a club who don't want to sell him. Firstly, you pick the player and you have to make an offer for him. You then have to decide how much you think he is worth and how much he is to earn as a basic wage. As an incentive, you can throw in a house or a car to the proceedings and offer a goalscoring bonus for the strikers or a clean sheet bonus for defenders. Then, once you have made an offer, you usually wait about a week or so and the player will come back to you to let you know if he has agreed to join your mini revolution.

Subjects that cropped up in the session were reports on a possible Division 1 of the Premier League, a European Super League and Harry Redknapp becoming father-in-law to Louise. Only the most topical subjects as you can see. IF I PRETEND I'M THINKING REALLY HARD, NO ONE WILL NOTICE THE FACT I'VE JUST WET MYSELF WONDER IF LOUISE HAS GOT A GOOD LOOKING MUM..? Why this game, or one like it took so long to come out on the PlayStation is beyond me. But at least it's here and it's just as good as I hoped it would be. Once you get over the loading times (which are no worse than any other PlayStation games, but still bad compared to the PC) it becomes a deeply involving game. If you have the benefit of being able to play with the mouse, then it becomes so much easier. You really do find yourself carefully planning each game and working out tactics specific to your opposition. Basically, this game has set a virtually unreachable benchmark for all those that dare to try and better it. Could be, and deserves to be one of the biggest games of this year. Excellent. STEVE 1.69 REVIEW NIGAM RATING It's been a while coming, but Premier Manager is a must have game for all football fans. A perfect mix of management and action. 51 "

RELEASED BY EIDOS TEL 0181 636 3000 TM PlayStation OUT MAY 1-4 PLAYERS PlayStation With Sensi and ISS both slipping back until September, WLS has a chance to steal all of no the glory in a last gasp shocker! Will it reign supreme this summer? 00345:20 96 CHELSEA EVERTON Velo ype often dictates how well a game is going to sell, particularly when it comes to football titles. And it's usually the games with less publicity that turn out the be the best games. Take World League Soccer from Eidos. Zero hype, top game. It's programmed by the same people behind Soccer '97, and even though you can see some elements from that as you play, they have learned an awful lot since then. In terms of realism, WLS is right up there with the best. The little things like being able to chest the ball away from an opponent, or head a ball downwards make this feel so much more realistic. WORLD LEAGUE SOCCER VERS TR Canonealabte TOOSVENSKANONIM B16A WORLD LEAGUE SOCCER 00 22:18 12 CHELSEA 000 18 EVERTON 2 BACK DOOR, BACK DOOR! The level of control you have over your players is very detailed indeed. You may initially find this as frustrating as we did. But although it takes some time to get the moves right, once you become accustomed to the one touch passing and heading, you'll be pinging the ball about like the Brazilian team in an airport. The most difficult aspects to master are shooting and heading. Have a look at this and you should be able to get an idea of it. REVIEW HEADING There are numerous ways you can head the ball. You can knock it down to one of your players, simply lump it forward, or head it down if you're attacking the goal. All of these are done using the square button. To pass to an opponent, tap the button and hold the direction you want the ball to go in. For a looping header to try and lob the keeper, perhaps press and hold square. Finally, for a power header double tap and hold square whilst pressing a direction. It sounds complicated, but it's not that difficult to master. SHOOTING When you're setting your sights on goal, the slightest tap in either direction can send your shot spooning all over the place. Aftertouch is important, but you should only try to use it once the ball has been kicked. Once the shot button is held down, pulling back on the pad increases the height of the shot as well. Using the volleys is good for surprise goals, but trying to direct them accurately is tough. Try and position yourself level with a post before hitting one, that way you can fire them straight and have a good chance of finding the back of the net. 52 "


"THIS IS BECKHAM TERRITORY THE RAY AND PETER SHOW computer video games Taking free kicks holds another cool feature to WLS. The game gives you the ability to set two waypoints, one is the direction the kick will start at, the second dictates the amount of swerve. It's not as easy as pointing the cursor at the back of the net and watching the ball fly in, because you have to allow for the arc of the ball, and the distance of the kick from the goalmouth. If you're defending one of these kicks, you can move the wall to your preferred position, add or take away players from the end of it and even make them jump as the kick is taken. 01 003 12:53 LAZIE AMERA HRONDA EID The token celeb commentators are running out now as WLS snaps up Channel 4's very own dynamic duo or Ray Wilkins and Peter Brackley. We have to say that of all the commentaries we've heard on the new batch of football releases, this is probably the worst because the phrases are linked together using words spoken in all sorts of tones, which makes it sound like a bit of a mickey take. Never mind. 00352:57 000 5001 di LAZIO GIVE AND GO SON!

Basically, you ber of defenders, midfielders and attackers. can fiddle about with your favourite team until You can position individual players, or groups you find the formation you like the best! DOTA OLM WLS is definitely the best of the action football games I've reviewed this month. But it's not quite good enough to earn itself the top mark. There are a couple of reasons for this. Tackling players can often prove very difficult, or at least random in the outcome. There is no 'step in' tackle, so you either have to slide in or actually take it from their toes instead. Also, the fact you cannot quickly switch between the players you control means players can run half the pitch unchallenged. However, those niggles aside WLS is a very good game indeed. There are no real guaranteed scoring methods, so you have to think about setting up chances, and the players' control and movement is very realistic. WLS is an excellent football game, and one that I can definitely recommend you invest in.   DECENCE  You can have a 1-10-0 formation if you want! REVIEW RATING RATING WLS is another footballing triumph for Silicon Dreams and Eidos. It's very playable and has tons to keep you coming back for more. Cool! Despite the snowy conditions, Scholes still manages this acrobatic header! 53 "

And with so many companies haggling for the tournament license, Take 2 plump for the England team game instead. Although it's a new title in an immensely overcrowded field, it's the fact that it'll have the backing of Hoddle's men that's getting the big wigs excited about this one. But will the punters on the street take the same view as the men in suits? Let CVG be your referee in this one... HOLO ARGO 1 03:58 10 Mandir THREE LIONS AND BULLY'S SPECIAL PRIZE... VERON RENG 2 The overhead kick looks spectacular, but with so many defenders back, it won't get through. ERICSSO Nice beard mate. CVG OPINION Ince fires in a shot. Although the target is right in the corner, this shot will miss. The first thing to mention about Three Lions is the targeting system used to take your shots at goal. Basically, a target stays in the goal throughout the entire game, and when you are running towards the net, it'll move as you move your player. Once you're in with a decent scoring chance, holding down the shoot button gives you control of this target. Bearing in mind that the longer you take in trying to position the cursor, the more chance the opponents have to tackle you, it's just a case of getting the target in a decent enough spot in the goal, and letting rip. With so much hype behind this game, we were expecting something pretty special. Sadly, I feel let down by Three Lions. I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't billed as the best thing since sliced bread, but the more you build it up, the bigger the disappointment if it doesn't meet those requirements. One thing that strikes you is that this isn't a very realistic game. You can hit a pass along the floor from one box to another without it being intercepted, and the size of the ball is unrealistic to the players. Sometimes when you're dribbling, the ball is actually behind the player, which is strange to say the least. The targeting system is a neat new gimmick though, and can offer some really precise shooting. But, when all's said and done, it's just too frustrating to be any good. STEVE HEY an Calou Spread out men! SHEARER REVIEW This one however finds the back of the net. Low shots are hard to stop. White boots eh? RATING INGU BAT GOL!

But as anyone who's ever got into one knows, they can be some of the most addictive games ever. Ultimate Soccer Manager 98 doesn't take itself quite as seriously as Championship Manager, but still has an astounding amount of detail, meaning that it has a good chance of attracting more budding 'guvnors' than other statistic-heavy games of this style. Just take a look at some of the things you can get up to. ULTIMATE SOCCER MANAGER 98 ULTIMATE FINANCE MANAGER 98 Catering Benin 111703 1857 DO I NOT LIKE THAT When you start a game of Ultimate Soccer Manager 98 you get the choice of playing as either Manager or Coach. As Coach you only need to worry about the performance of your team, but as Manager you're in control of all the finances as well. You need to negotiate contracts with your players and staff, upgrade your ground, field a winning side, keep the board happy, and even set the price of burgers and drinks at the ground! the Pratit 1957 Red 1037 ULTIMATE SOCCER MANAGER 98 CATERPILLAR Portakabin CIS CISSIERRA CATERPILLARR.CENTATGIS CIS 850 lol 59 2.813 Burger Bars Everybody come to Gillingham!

A fairly basic representation of the pitch lets you see how the game's progressing, giving you the chance to make tactical changes on the way. You can also see weather effects and the quality of the pitch itself, as well as seeing how packed the stands are. Your pitch visibly gets ruined as the season goes on. Better repair that. Everton O Coventry Oty This giant man is your physio. THE BOYS DUN GOOD The original Ultimate Soccer Manager seemed like a very basic management game with an easy-to-use interface. The '98 version still has the simple graphic interface (with animated rendered offices and items) but is now packed with detailed statistics and features. The small things are what make USM 98 such fun, like negotiating deals with agents, picking the advertising for your programmes, and trying to rig games without the press finding out. The rendered menus look great, and are extremely easy to negotiate, though there's a hell of a lot of information to get through. Hardcore management fans will still probably favour Championship Manager, but USM 98 is definitely a worthy alternative. If you've never got into anything like this before, give it a go you'll be shopping for a sheepskin coat in no time.

While Acclaim's title is miles and away the better looking and considering the gap between the release of the two, it's no real surprise Descent has more responsive and fluid controls and isn't as immediately frustrating, due to the difficulty setting.

The Scatter missile is most effective because it's heat-seeking and homes in.

"computer Video LA SECRETS OUT games In a similar style to Quake, Forsaken has lots of secret parts to each of the stages. Basically, these work in a similar way to Quake, in that you have to shoot certain parts of a wall to get through for example. Also, you may have to trigger a chain reaction of events to open up the hidden treasures This may be something as simple as blowing up a line of nuclear barrels so each one crumbles a section of the wall, or it could be hitting various switches from around the level just to open a tiny room. If you are going to go for all of the crystals and gold bars, however, finding these secret rooms is a must. ROM 19:43:7 I MAY BE SOME TIME. PlayStation The levels in Forsaken are, quite simply, huge. And in order to finish them, you usually have to perform lots of sub tasks to open up the exit. Usually you'll have to clear a specific room of all enemy robots, which will then reward you with a key, or actually open a door somewhere else in the level. Switches and levers need to be shot on other levels, and sometimes you have to physically bump into them so they are activated. This is easier said than done, because you can see all of the switches, but have to travel all around the level to actually get to them!

LIVE Q SAGOT N O ODUTER BANKS TO DISABLE STATION DOOR LOCKS PICTURE IN A PICTURE One other neat feature to Forsaken is the mini picture you get in the top left of the screen. There are a number of ways to make this appear. If you trigger a door opening in another room in the level, it'll appear and show you the door and the room. It'll also provide an action cam when you fire missiles. The small screen will show the projectile flying across the room until it makes contact. This also serves as a neat way to see what is in a room, because you can fire one missile through and have a gander at all of the enemies as it whistles through. The PlayStation version is also finished and while it doesn't look anywhere near as nice as the PC title, it still delivers the same action and playability. The controls are still a bit fiddly, and you have less scope for movement with the reduced but ton count on the PS pad. The Nintendo 64 game is almost done, but is quite a bit different to the other two. It is the only one of the three to have boss characters, and has a four-player mode as well.

Forsaken is one of the best looking games you'll ever see. The engine is nothing short of amazing, and you'll be staring open mouthed as you hurtle through the various passageways. The water effect is also fantastic, when it ripples after being shot at. However, there are a couple of shortcomings which prevent Forsaken from being a classic. The first is the insane difficulty curve. Fair enough, you want a game that will last you a while, but not one that leaves you tearing your hair out. Maybe it wouldn't be so difficult if the control system was easy to use, but that is the other major minus point to this game. To get the full benefits you have to use the keyboard, but there are so many buttons, that it's too confusing. If you do use the mouse, then you have to do without some of the moves because you don't have enough fingers! This means you're less mobile and become a sitting duck for the enemies. It is a very good game, but it seems that people are raving over the good looks and not the way the game plays.

The rumble action is different for each car, and you can feel vibrations as you pull away from the starting grid, or if you take a corner at full pelt. The pad is also a useful indication to the limitations of your car, you can actually feel a difference when the car becomes unstable, or is about to spin out.

"computer Video PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT games Gran Turismo is the real driving simulator' remember? It recreates everything except crashes (because the manufacturers wouldn't allow it) highly realistically. To do well at the game you'll have to play by its rules. So serious is the game that you have to pass driving tests before you're allowed to race. Don't think this is a ruse to stop you from progressing. It's brilliantly designed to teach you how you have to play this game, with a series of difficult tests, that require you to test your skills to the limit. You'll be tearing your hair out and jumping for joy with equal measure. License/A-1 License/A-1 License Test START License Test PlayStation Practical cornering 1 -Test Results Fail Accelerate away from the starting point, go round the first corner and then go through the finishing gate. Watch out as the straight is longer than the previous test, so you will be entering the corner at a higher speed. The test car is a Toyota Supra. The time limit is one minute. Press Any Button This is your mission, should you fail... Try, try and try again... and then more! Before you know, you're a better driver. THE VIEW FROM HERE o bih Las 1:29 The replay mode in this game is unlike any other. This is because the cars look much better than in the main game, perhaps because of the dramatic camera angles that film the action. If you squint, it almost looks like the real thing. If you're particularly proud of the way you tore up the track, or if you caused a massive pile-up, you can save the replay to memory card, and then watch your achievement over and over again in the Replay Theatre. WIRE This isn't skillful driving, just cornering too fast. The arcade mode is faster, and the cars fly! Luckily this won't scratch the paintwork. Congratulations! GRAN TURISMO THE REAL DRIVING SIMULATOR You Are The Series Samplon! Press Aay Button If you're getting beaten on a certain course, or having difficulty passing licence tests, it's a good idea to watch the replays not to analyse your mistakes, but to see if you can take corners at a better angle. Just watch, and learn. You'd be surprised at how wide some corners are. TAKE A BAD CAR, AND MAKE IT BETTER Concept Car &l38:502 Fastest Lap 1926:732 Cat Some cars are already cool, but cost loads of dosh. SIT SIZ SUB form. km/h COVER STORY When not studying your form, just watch the replays because they look so good. If you had a hard battle to win, watch to see just how close that fender was to spinning you off the road, or how well you cut up a rival to steal the victory. Once you've won some races and accumulated some credits you'll be wanting to put your newfound fortune to good use. You have a choice of buying a brand new car, or taking your current choice into the garage for some modifications. The list of improvements that can be performed on each car is vast. From the basics of changing the tyres, through to transmission, turbo kits and weight reduction. Before long you'll be analysing the smallest detail of your car, and adjusting things accordingly just to get an extra bit of speed. Be warned though, when buying enhancements it's not just a case of buy, buy, buy to make a better car. Some add-ons can slow acceleration in favour of a higher top speed, or viceversa. We've seen many of our own pride and joys become completely different beasts, with a few tweaks changing the handling, and ruining the 'feel' of the car. 64 It's spinning a bit, we'll adjust the dampening.

"BEGINNERS STUFF MUSIC FOR THE TURISMO GENERATION computer, Video games When starting out, a good tip is not to buy a powerful rear wheel drive car. Without experience it'll be a waste of money so early on. You'll do nothing but spin out whenever you enter a corner. Better to start with a four wheel drive or FF (front engine, front wheel drive). Both these types of car are a lot easjer to drive, Cust and stick to BUDGESTONE the road. Watch the intro, turn the volume up, and you'll be hyped to race.

Provided by top artists such as Garbage and Ash. Best of all is the Chemical Brothers' remix of Everything Must Go by the Manic Street Preachers. This music is played over the intro and it makes the computer generated images seem even better. There aren't many music tracks in the game, so you'll soon be hearing the same music over and over again, Sony have hand-picked some great tunes that suit the game perfectly. 160 kot 2ND OPINION Total Record ----Fastest Lap 0:57 2012 2/3 Total Time 1:13.900 Lap Time 0:57:442 0:16:45B MRX 9300m/ 32 Gran Turismo sets new standards in many ways it has some of the best graphics ever seen, excellent handling, and more cars and upgrade options than ever before. The development team have obviously worked really hard over the last four years to make a \"complete\" driving game and in many ways they have. The races aren't as exciting as those in certain other driving games, such as TOCA Touring Car, mostly because of the lack of collisions. Piling into a wall will just make you bounce off and carry on driving, which takes some of the tension away. But still, Gran Turismo is currently the ultimate driving game, and you'd be very, very stupid to miss it. MASI THE REAL DRIVING SIMULATOR GRAN TURISMO When your car clocks up a speed like this, sweat! kob The best driving technique for corners is to brake early, and accelerate out of the turn. If you brake too late you run the risk of losing control. EARN FAST CARS FASTI CVG OPINION The quickest way to start buying the cars you want is some fancy wheeling and dealing. First earn your B licence, then buy a cheap, reliable used car. Best buys are the Honda Prelude, or if you want a little bit more of a challenge the Toyota Sprinter Truneo. Enter and win the Sunday Cup. Sell your original car plus the Demio you win, and with the money buy an '89 Nissan GT-R, if you've any spare cash, carry out a few simple improvements on this machine. Just to get the car that tiny bit faster, a ROM and muffler are good to start with. Next enter the 4WD event race. Sell the prize car, and further modify the GT-R. Don't buy the racing body, it's a waste of money at this stage. Once you get the A licence, enter the Japanese Vs. US event race, win this and you get the Mitsubishi FTO Limited Edition the best allround car in the game. From here on in, you should know what to do. I'd tried to avoid playing the Japanese version of the game, even though every one has been raving about it for ages. Now, after finally playing the English version I can see what all the fuss is about. Gran Turismo is the best racing game around, it's almost embarrassing how many options are available. The courses are all well designed, and the cars and realistic handling are just spoton. The licences are a brilliant test of skill, and also a well disguised way of making you play the game the way the developers wanted it to be played. There's only one thing missing from GT and that's crashes and damage. I can live with that. It would have been perfect with them included, but even without, this is still the best racer you can buy for miles. ALEX 4WTALA COVER STORY RATING Another fast way of getting money is simply to enter the Sunday Cup with a super powerful car. Skip qualifying, win each race and you'll be awarded 19,500 credits each time, plus if you sell the Demio you get an extra 10,000. That's almost 30,000 for less than 10 minutes racing. Gran Turismo raises the stakes in the racing game genre. It's gonna take something very special to come close to this! 65 "


"computer video games FIGHTING GAME BY CAPCOM SHIH NDATIO  PRICE IMPORT  ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE PLAYSTATION VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 10 MG CART  PUBLISHED BY CAPCOM TEL IMPORTER SATURN OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYERS VG RECU SAT Are you a retired horror movie beastie looking for something to do? Why not fight others like you in Capcom's latest arcade conversion! og ampire Savior is the third in Capcom's series of monster fighting games, and is one of their best to date. It gives you the chance to play as a classic B-movie horror character and use all manner of bizarre powers to beat up a load of others. This Saturn version is out now in Japan, and needs the 4Mb RAM cartridge to produce what are probably the best 2D animated (or should that be re-animated?) graphics seen on any console. But this isn't just 'Street Fighter with monsters' Vampire Savior plays very differently to other fighting games, and stands out as one of the very best. The Lord Vare pire HIT DO THE MONSTER MASH CVG OPINION Vampire Savior adds four characters to the Night Warriors (Vampire Hunter in Japan) cast. Q-Bee is a half-bee half-woman creature who can call on her bee friends at any time. She has very unusual animation, and moves around as though she's depressed all the time. Bulleta (also known as BB Hood) is a young Red Riding Hood with all manner of ridiculous weapons concealed on her. Lilith is Morrigan's younger, sexier sister, and then there's Jedah. Jedah is one of the most fantastic fighting game characters ever created, with a great costume, ingenious moves, and amazing animation. HIT 1 Bulleta has two men with guns hidden under her cloak. 1 Here, Q-Bee jumps onto her hive while her friends attack. I only played Vampire Savior in the arcade a few times, but now I understand all the fuss about Jedah he's one of the coolest video game characters I've ever seen! Though the last game in the series, Night Warriors, looked fantastic on the Saturn, it doesn't compare to Vampire Savior. The 4Mb RAM cartridge means that all of the arcade animation is included, and it REALLY makes a massive difference to the overall look of the game. All of the monster fighters are magnificent, with strong personalities and unique movement that makes them stand out from the crowd of crappy fighting game characters and the four new guys fit in brilliantly. As you'd expect from Capcom, Vampire Savior doesn't just look beautiful but is also brilliantly balanced and worked out. There are so many moves and combo possibilities that you could easily be playing this forever. The only thing I'm not too keen on is the killer Instinct-style round system (when you run out of energy you fall over, then get up and carry on with your second bar) but otherwise this is spot-on. This is yet another awesome Capcom Saturn import game. T AS REVIEW The Saturn version of Vampire Savior also includes the three characters left out of the original arcade version Pyron, Donovan and Huitzil (Phobos in Japan). They each have new moves to bring them up to date, and make this Saturn version even more exciting for fans. 1 Jedah slaps his opponent onto their death certificate! 1 Here's one of Lilith's mad super combo attacks. M-maad! RATING RATING 066 USE THE DARK FORCE, YOUNG SASQUATCH Amazing supermoves have become the trademark of the Darkstalkers series, and Vampire Savior takes them to a new extreme. With your superbar filled, you can perform ES moves (powered-up versions of standard special attacks), EX combos (the usual incredible supermoves), or the new Dark Force mode. Pressing an equal strength Punch and Kick together makes the background turn into a swirling coloured pattern where you get a few seconds to use your character's Dark Force. Sometimes it lets you fly, some times it calls up a second version of your fighter depending on who you're playing as. The best-looking 2D console game out there, Vampire Savior is also a joy to play get your Saturn converted if you haven't already.  "

"computer @ core: 55,766 leval: 2 games NINTENDO 64 PUZZLE GAME BY ZED TWO  PRICE .89 . NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 64 MB CART  PUBLISHED BY OCEAN TEL 0181 832 6633 EARTHQULIT. OUT NOW 1-2 PLAYERS NINTENDO 64 Yet another great puzzle game for the Nintendo 64. And this one widdles on the competition. etrix, believe it or not, is about water lots of it. It's a tricky and totally addictive puzzle game, where you must change the landscape to create lakes, making mountains and sometimes causing earthquakes in the process. It's a logical battle of the elements, with meteors, ice cubes and rainbows all playing a part. There's also bombs that can ruin your ecological plans in seconds. The best thing is, you don't need to be a weatherman to play it. wetrix3 Score: levela lakes LOTE WONI UMNOHO SEVERE WEATHER WARNING QUE free lakes scores, score: 100 Pak CXIden. The idea of the game is simple: create pools of water, then evaporate them for big points. You'll need to take advantage of the red blocks to build your landscape. Red blocks (uppers) raise the land, while green ones (downers) lower it. You need to position the red blocks as they fall, so you have a landscape that can hold the inevitable water drops. Once the water falls, you must make sure that no water leaks over the edges of the play area. If it does, the test tube on the right of the screen slowly fills up with all the excess water. Once the tube is full, it's game over for you, sunshine. SAT QUITE Score: 1266 levels Look at all those mountains and water. That means one thing, an earthquake is coming! You can see where the water is leaking, thanks to the excellent graphics, and some helpful arrows. CVGOPINION (MOSES WHERE ARE YOU Not only do you have to worry about the water and leakage, but there's the problem of earthquakes. This happens if you try to build huge mountain ranges to hold the water. For every upper you place on another the Earthquake Meter which is on the left side of the screen rises slightly. If the earthquake hits, the result is a massive explosion which ruins your global plans. Bombs destroy the terrain. If you manage to drop a bomb on a hole, you get a Re-Bomb and cause more to appear. REVIEW_ The moment I saw this being played, I was interested. The graphics were great and it seemed easy to get into. Like all the best puzzle games, Wetrix has got two major factors going for it its simplicity and total addictiveness. There's also some good music to help you stay in the right mood. What's really great are the score multipliers. These make the high score something worth aiming for, and can move the action up to a frantic level. My only concern is the longevity. The two player option eases this, but as a one player, once you reach and master level 10 difficulty, there's no new challenge. Still if you like addictive puzzle games, you know there has to be a cut-off point somewhere, or you'll never stop playing! ALEX HUHTALA score: 10 Olovo: RANDOV kos: 3, MULTIPLIERS ANTHOL Ehree lakes scores RATING RATING & The Rainbow multiplier appears if there's enough water in your world. The action's still great in the two player mode. One of the best puzzle games to be released in recent years, and it does make surprisingly good use of the N64 hardware. * "

In fact they've produced some of the console's greatest games, mastering the fighting, driving, and shooting genres in the process. Lately it seems Namco just want to have some fun. Witness the cute platformer Klonoa, plus some of the secrets in Tekken 3 and now, finally, a conversion of what many consider to be the greatest gun game ever made Point Blank. IT SOUNDS SIMPLE IT ISN'T ALL THE FUN OF THE FAIR TIME CRISIS GETS SHOT DOWN The aim of the game is to complete the chosen challenges, but these appear at random. In each challenge there are three vital factors: how many targets you must hit, how many bullets you have, and how many seconds are on the clock. These make each challenge a true test of your shooting skills. Remember, because of the random element, no two games are the same. So you'll need to master every single challenge to be the best. Point Blank isn't a gun game spread over stages like Virtua Cop or Time Crisis. There are no females to rescue, or bad guys to kill. Instead there are over 100 of the craziest gun challenges ever devised to entertain you. Ranging from shooting apples off your assistant's head, to shooting chickens, piranhas, buzzards, cars, bottles, UFO's, balls, ducks in fact, you name it and Point Blank has got it, and you have to shoot it.

It's a completely different style of gun game, but the most addictive one ever devised. It may have cute graphics, but it has one major advantage over Time Crisis, and that is the unpredictability. This is no 'on-rails' shooter, you don't know where targets are going to appear next, so you've got to be quick on that trigger to hit them. The most appealing feature of Point Blank is the variety on offer, loads of different challenges, plus the now trademark Namco extra home features. I almost forgot the most important thing this game is FUN! A real party game which anyone can play. PB may not have the recognition of Time Crisis, but for my money, it's a much better game.

A bargain? Well, Sampras isn't the best tennis game we've ever played, but it looks nice enough and It's certainly feature packed: doubles matches with up to four players huddled around the keyboard, eight international stadiums with umpires that shout at you in the local language (if you like), and computer opponents who adapt to your game. The 3D players are all motion-captured, but this can get in the way. Whenever you play a shot they go through backswing animations and you have to learn to compensate for these in your timing.

The only thing more impressive than the 3D graphics (accelerated or not) is the quantity of fun-power MMV3 generates with its numerous game modes, including Keepsies races in which you win vehicles, and a wide selection of multiplayer games (up to six players on one PC four on two joypads and two more crowded around the keyboard). Simply excellent stuff.

That's exactly what you set to do in this game. There are 15 missions which set you a variaty of tasks, such as breaking into a heavily defended warehouse o dashing through enclosed arenas disarming time bombs. Your craft's weapons are basic machine guns, homing rockets (which are a bit temperamental to lock on) and a grenade launcher but more interesting is its ability to climb walls and hang from ceilings. Comparisons to Descent hold true it can be just as disorienting when you're clambering around pipes upside down. This is good un out of the ordinary but challenging.

As the system gets corrupted, rips in the local space-time continuum appear, and you, playing heroic Bob, have to find them and stitch each one up within a two-minute time limit.

GARGOYLE FIGHTING PlayStation CARDINAL SYN OUT NOW BY SONY USA 1-8 PLAYERS t first glance, Sony USA's attempt at a Soul Blade style fantasy fighting doesn't look too original. The blade-armed combatants have high, mid and low attacks that can be strung together for gory combos and juggles, and a shield defense move which can reverse attacks and let you initiate throws. More interesting are the interactive' arenas. Some are enclosed so you can stun your opponent by slamming them into a wall, and you can boost your chances with power-ups hidden in chests. Each arena also has hazards such as runaway minecarts and archers who fire through arrow slits at you. Unfortunately, this kind of gimmick turns off the hardcore PlayStation crowd, who prefer a more spec tacular array of moves and more precise techniques than Cardinal Syn offers. It's a nice beat-'em-up, but it's hard to imagine anyone choosing it over Dead or Alive or Tekken 3.

ACTION RPG 40 DIE BY THE SWORD ROM OUT NOW BY TANTRUM his is almost one of the cleverest adventure games we've seen. You play a knight stuck in caverns full of Kobolds and Orcs, which you must viciously dismember or decapitate. The level layouts are great, full of surprise ambushes, traps, special rooms and secret passages, and there are some clever set-pieces which score you extra points if you complete them correctly. The graphics are great with a 3D accelerator, the music is moody and the Voices are fun (Austin Powers star Michael York is your mentor during training). So what's the problem? The mouse-driven sword control. It's horribly unwieldy, which must be why the programmers included a Simplified keyboard 'arcade' mode that lets you win most battles by repeatedly jabbing the '5' key. There's a multiplayer arena battle where you can practise fighting with the mouse if you must, but the quest is definitely where most of the action is.

"puter e NEV GAMES games 3D PLATFORM FIGHTING 100% COMPLETE ESATERA BY SONY BY SONY  NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD TM OUT NOW (JAP) 1 PLAYER PlayStation  RELEASED BY SONY TEL: IMPORTERS PlayStation Swords in guts and slit throats they're all part and parcel of a career in magazine publishing. Coincidentally, they also feature heavily in this game of ninja assassinations. TENCHUA injas they started off as disciples of a peace-loving Japanese cult and ended up as nunchuk-wielding stealth warriors. And then they became Animatronic turtles. But try to forget that last bit, because this is a game that revives everything that's cool about these ancient martial artists. Tenchu is a 3D platform fighting game, kind of a cross between Bushido Blade and Tomb Raider. Not surprisingly, you play a Ninja, and you have to complete eight missions using a combination of careful sneaking about and ruthless violence with swords and throwing stars. Needless to say, it gets a bit bloody, so wear something washable and put some newspaper down. TENCHU SNEAKIN' UP ON YOU! A BAG OF CALTROPS. PLEASE! At the start of the game you can choose to play as either a male or female ninja We couldn't detect any significant differences between Rikimaru (the bloke) and Ayame (the girl) apart from the fact that Rikimaru carries a sword and Ayame wields a pair of knives. They both seem to have similar abilities, they can both carry the same special weapons, and they both have funny walks. Rikimaru appears to have a slight limp and Ayame has a sort of big-bummed waddle. Somehow they manage to be hard and deadly in spite of these disabilities, though. Before each mission, you can pick up five Ninja most was the decoy device that you can use to accoutrements from Rikimaru's or Ayame's lure a guard out into the open. Just toss it in ninja hut. There are shurikens, caltrops (footfront of him and he'll walk over to look at it, givstabbing spikes) and health-restoring potions, ing you a chance to sneak up behind him and as well as more specialised items. Bombs are slit his throat! Schlik! As you complete handy for dropping into crowds of henchmen, missions, your stock of stuff grows, so you get and there's poisoned food that you can cruelly a greater choice of tools to use in the more feed to guard dogs. The one that impressed us advanced missions. 15 WA ( L ih)  A ++*+ *8 * NEW GAMES El 100 WAY OF THE NINJA Rikimaru (above) deals death to a female ninjarette, while Ayame chops up a guard dog. Neither of them know the meaning of 'mercy'! Until the English language version of Tenchu is released, we can only guess at the mission objectives relayed in short polygon cinema sequences. The first mission is a classic 'Assassinate The Corrupt Overlord' gig, in which you infiltrate his walled estate and kill his private army before dropping in through the roof of his house. Then you have to fight his personal bodyguard while he runs about shooting at you with an old-fashioned pistol. Later missions set you the task of getting across a shanty town where ninjas walk the streets, then things take a Tomb Raider turn as you explore a forest with secret caves and bottomless pits.  "


"DO STEALTH FIGHTERS computer Video games Ninjas weren't big on head-to-head confrontations, relying on stealth to get their job done, so instead of running around looking for a fight, be cautious. If you're on the ground, stay low, hide behind bushes and peep around corners to see what's lying in wait. An alarm symbol at the bottom of the screen turns from green to amber to red, indicating when enemies are nearby, or when an enemy is alerted to your presence. If the gauge flashes red be prepared to fight unless you can escape quickly. In most cases your best option is to stay off the streets, using your grappling hook to get up to the rooftops. Then, when an enemy passes below you, drop down behind them and silently slit their throats or plunge your blade into their belly. It's not what you'd call 'honourable', but it's effective. PlayStation B2 For a quick escape, throw your grappling hook up to a roof... ...Then reel it in to pull your self up. Now THAT's stealthy! TENCHU BLADE STRIKE Just because they favour sneak attacks doesn't mean the ninjas aren't accomplished swordspersons. If you run into a swordsman or pikeman, simple controller combos result in different strikes, lunges, double slashes and blocks, and you can also dodge attacks with acrobatic flips and rolls. One of the things we like about the fighting is the way that your opponents often battle on to their very last breath. Three or four slashes might take them from 50 health points down to one, but they cling to that last health point, blocking and striking at you until you can deliver the final fatal blow. That poor fool he doesn't realise that his time has come! Hold still and I will make your death quick and painless! TENCHU SNEAKIN' UP ON YOU! Grab the rooftops and edge over to your unknowing prey! Hide around a corner and you can check out your next victim. 290 SHURI-CANT 000 Tenchu is out in Japan right now, so importers can supply a copy if you don't mind playing 'Guess The Mission'. If you want an English language version, you're going to have to wait until September, when Activision will be releasing the game in Europe. For the most part, the European version will be identical, apart from a total lack of shurikens. A ninja without shurikens might sound crazy, but the weapons have long been the subject of a total ban in the UK and even toy rubber throwing stars are outlawed. Oops! Must have hit a vein. That's another poor pikeman that won't be going home to his missus tonight. His family will be out on the street. No more sushi for them. It's pebble stew on the menu now. And no one cares. NEW GAMES Can you say, 'Tomb Raider? NINJAS KNUCKLE UP! Apart from the shuriken thing, Activision are promising some refinements to our version of Tenchu, which we hope includes fixing the way some of the textures warp when you get close to them. We'll update you when we get Euro-code later in the year. 100 Just aim your shuriken and... URK! Watch the claret fly! Though not in the UK version of course...  "


"computer Video games NEW GAMES A fine mix of fresh games this month, but the standouts are the awesome Street Fighter EX2 and the groundbreaking Brian Lara Cricket by Codemasters. This business just never fails to thrill us! 3D FIGHTING GAME BY CAPCOM COMPLETE MAY RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS BY CODEMASTERS AGE 2 THE LATEST NEW GAMES IN FOUR ACTION-PACKED PAGES ES BRIAN LARA CRICKET COMPLETE PCOICKET JUNE RELEASE ROM 1.4 PLAYERS PlayStation STREET FIGHTER EX 2 ust in from Japan, here are some hot-hot-hot pics of Capcom's latest Street Fighter coin-op. Street Fighter EX2 is the second SF game to be played in 3D and it marks the welcome return of classic SF characters Blanka, the wild man from Brazil, and Vega, the masked bullfighter from Spain, with the Eagle Claws. The coinop is powered by the System 12 hardware which also runs Tekken 3 and is basically the same as the System 11 chipset, but with extra RAM to accommodate more animation and fight graphics. Our spies tell us that the game is already on trial in the Casino arcade on London's Tottenham Court Road (the UK test-site for all of Capcom's games), but it should be hitting most arcades nationwide as you read this. That Blanka he's a flippin' wild man! Oughta be locked up! FIRST LOOK AT HOT NEI SOFTWARE! nodemasters made two excellent Brian Lara Cricket games for the Mega Drive, and are currently working hard to finish the PlayStation and PC follow-up in time for the summer. So far it's looking fantastic everything a cricket fan could possibly want. For a start, it will feature real players complete with accurate statistics, 46 real grounds from around the world, and even a commentary from Geoff Boycott and Jonathan Agnew (Geoff Boycott will almost certainly do his trademark \"key test\" on the crease before each match!). The graphics are fully 3D with motioncaptured players for added realism. You can view the game from a selection of angles including the stump camera and even inside the batsman's head! Floodlit night matches will be possible, and the pitches will all vary in quality depending on the weather. The PlayStation version is going to be compatible with the multi-tap to let up to four players work together at the same time, while the PC version will work across a local network (and possibly even the Internet). On top of all of this, Codemasters are planning to add loads of different competition modes such as a full Test Series or season, a Knockout Tournament, a World Series or World Cup Competition, and the usual Friendly matches. You'll also be able to take control of a classic match from a critical point and see if you can finish it in style! There's no doubt that Brian Lara Cricket 98 will be the best game of its kind (there are very few other cricket games available) and Codemasters could have a genuinely brilliant sports game on their hands. FIRST LO It willl be most interesting to see how the fighting style of characters like Blanka and Vega has evolved since their early days as 2D fighters. Oh yes it will. As you can see, Vega has changed his costume and had Eagle Claw extensions fitted. Flash git as ever. NEW GAMES MLS MELIS II WELUSI Let's send this over to the Americans and make them all play it. Fitting revenge for all those bloody baseball games they : keep expecting us to buy off them. 78 "

This time around, instead of using smooth polygon characters, the developers have gone for fully texture-mapped 3D figures who strut around a rotating arena, looking just like their real-life counterparts. There are 20 ringstars from WCW and NWO in the game, complete with all of their signature moves and taunts. Even better, Hollywood Hogan, Ric Flair and the rest are joined by a bunch of secret characters, such as the wrestlers' managers and valets, who occasionally run into the ring when they feel their boy needs a bit of help. For extra, extra authenticity, each match features commentary by WCW's mainstay announcer, 'Mean' Gene Okerlund. The beta copy THQ has sent us looks quite good, though it didn't appear to have the smooth flow and the realism of the N64 game. For the full dope you'll need to check out the review of the finished item in the next issue. HOLLYWOOD NASH 49 FIGHTING BY ARC SYSTEMS PlayStation JUNE RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS GUILTY GEAR 3D DRIVING FIRST LOOK AT HOT NET SOFTWARE: NEW GAMES BY GAMEKEY U '39\"768 JUNE RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS veryone's going crazy for 3D fighting games these days, but, as Dark Savior and Street Fighter vs X-Men have proved, the old 2D format still has a lot to offer if it's done right. The oddly named Guilty Gear is one of the latest examples, programmed by Japanese developer Arc Systems and snapped up for release on PlayStation by Ocean. It has a selection of 10 male and female characters and many of the gameplay touches we've come to expect from this type of game; 'Special' bars that let you build up power moves, juggle combos, and a near-death 'faint' state that lets you completely wipe out your weakened foe. So, although it's not terribly original, and the version we've seen needs a bit of anglicising (there's some dodgy spelling in there), overall Guilty Gear seems quite good. It has the look and feel of a decent Neo-Geo fighting game and some satisfying smack-up action. We're await the finished item with interest. Hmmm... GT 64 SALE It's been a while since we saw a good N64 driving game, and it 1/3 looks like we'll have to wait until the end of the year for games like 289\"483 FZero X and V-Rally. In the meantime, Ocean is releasing this smartlooking racer from Gamekey, the developers of the 60,000-selling Multi-Racing Championship. GT Rally 64 uses a completely different engine to MRC, so it can cater for very detailed 3D car models and features more realistic handling and car physics. The cars are actually based on 12 reallife speedmobiles, one of which is a appears when you win you beat the Porsche 911 posing as an Ocean GT Racer other 11 drivers to the champifor copyright purposes. onship.

"WWW computer RETRO COMPS Y CAPCOM SPACE COMBAT | BY VOL.ITION video games SEPT RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS MAY RELEASE ROM 1-8 PLAYERS PlayStation CAPCOM GENERATIONS 1&2 DESCENT FREESPACE s the name suggests this is the Mlatest in the Descent series, but it's not the sequel to Descent II. After DII, the developer, Parallax Software split into two separate companies, Volition and Outrage. Outrage is currently working on Descent III, the genuine sequel which is due out later this year, while Volition has produced this mission-based 3D combat game set : in open space. It's Earth vs the Vasudans, and you're in the front line, flying starships in strike missions against Vasudan fighters and capital ships and defending your own fleet from attack. You're joined by wingmen and other pilots and you have to fly as part of a team, coordinating your efforts with your wingmen, allocating their targets and keeping them out of trouble when their ships are damaged. As in Colony Wars, : the missions come in a branching structure, so your performance affects your route through the game, and blowing one mission can start you and the rest of the human race on a slippery slide to Vasudan oblivion. One of the game's more original features is your ability to capture enemy technology and use it to expand your own arsenal. Descent Freespace comes with the now essential network game option, which lets you join forces with lots of strangers to fight armies of people you don't know over the Internet. Just for a change, you can plug a microphone into your PC and shout messages to your wingmen perfect for intercontinental swearing contests. The game will also come with Volition's own mission design tool so you can create your own then challenge your Interbuddies to beat them. We've seen a lot of games like this lately and none have made a really lasting impression, but Descent Freespace certainly isn't lacking in features and there's plenty of spectacular eye-candy to keep 3D accelerator owners happy. eah! This is what we've been waiting for. While Namco was I HORAR releasing all these retro compilations full of interesting but thin games like PacLand, what we really wanted to see was some of Capcom's mid-80s classics. Well, there must be somebody telepathic over there because that's exactly what's happening. The Capcom Generations series will comprise a series of arcade emulators which run the original code from IPLAYER HI-SCORE 211,2 EGR Capcom coinops/console games of yore on a PlayStation. Capcom Generations 1 will feature 1942, 1943 and 1943 Enhanced, three vertically scrolling aircraft shoot-'em-ups in which you take on the entire Japanese air force and navy in a World War II setting. Not bad but we're more interest ed in Capcom PLA Generations 2, which features Ghosts 'n' Goblins, Ghouls 'n Ghosts and Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts, three classic platform shooters with a spooky bent. These were memorable for their ingenious level layouts and the cool bosses waiting at the end of each stage. Ah, the memories! These big ships look cool. FIRST LOOK AT HOT NEI SOFTWARE! This is a great game for fans of dials and gauges. This has more head-up display than any other game we've seen. x 1700 T335 VENDO 30 ACTION BY UBISOFT Retro freaks will go crazy for Ghosts 'n Goblins. Anyone remember the cool C64 and Spectrum conversions by Elite Software? And the music! Wow... ROM SEPT RELEASE 1-2 PLAYERS TONIC TROUBLE He must really hate this book. NEW GAMES TIME 2x10100 Ah, now, Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts was the most recent G'n'G game. It was quite a hit on the Super NES, what with it's massive boss es and cool new weapons (the crossbow on the right for example). t's the game the pundits are calling 'Rayman in 3D', but we don't reckon it looks that bad. Tonic Trouble (yeah, the NAME is naff) is a cartoony-looking action adventure which stars a disjointed fellah called Ed who has returned from a space trip with a can that mutates Earth's inhabitants into sinister monsters. Like Mario, Ed is a versatile character who can climb, run, crawl, swim and fly, and eradicate more persistent foes with an array of special powers, a deadly bow tie and a stick. In what could be interpreted as a pre-emptive first strike against Mario 64 II, Ubisoft's programmers have put a two-player exploration mode in Tonic Trouble, and it's also planning an upgrade disk for the game which will : be release when the 64DD becomes available. A PC version is also planned, but for some reason (size?) this is being designed to work with the new high-capacity DVD systems. So, what, now we have to junk our CD-ROM drives too? Will the expense never end? @ "

It's the first project from new Spanish programmers, Pyro and if the demo was anything to go by, they are setting themselves an extremely high benchmark. The game is viewed from a similar angle as traditional strategy games like C&C, but that is where the similarity ends. You have control of a maximum of six commandos from a crack team of experts. You're given a mission objective, like infiltrate an enemy base and blow up a communications tower, and you have to do it. Each commando has a special ability, for instance the Green Beret, who is the strongest character, can Cor! Dambusters!

BCD JULY RELEASE 1 PLAYER ROM PlayStation INDO 3 SHOOTING JULY RELEASE BY ARGONAUT 1 PLAYER HEART OF DARKNESS BUCK BUMBLE voice from the grave... Can it be? Heart of Darkness, the 2D platform game that was widely tipped for success four years ago is finally set to appear on PlayStation this summer after being picked up by Infogrames. HOD was the flagship project for Amazing Studios, a French development team that had broken away from Delphine, and it was originally signed up by Virgin Interactive. Apparently some internal conflicts within Amazing and big changes at Virgin left the game in development limbo until Infogrames stepped in. Infogrames haven't favoured The game still bears a strong resemus with a demo disc as yet but blance to Delphine's earlier platform they're promising that the game ers, Flashback and Another World, both has been worth the wait. The of which appeared on 16-bit. Heart of screenshots may look much the Darkness has more of a fantasy plot same as the stuff we saw all line, though, and stars a young boy those years ago, but Infogrames called Andy who is out to rescue his promise us that as far as immerdog after it falls into an alternate sive gameplay goes, there's dimension. none to beat it. We shall see... lushed with their number-one success with Croc on r PlayStation, top North London developer Argonaut is working on another cute action game for N64, starring the cybernetic bumble bee of the title. Alien mutant insects are chowing down on the good, honest, local breeds, and Mr Bumble is the only guy in the hive to have the kind of bolton weapons (plasma pistols, homing missiles, etc) required to see them off. So what you have to do is fly around 22 of the neighbourhood gardens, sewers and more unworldly sites, zapping the yellow goo out of the invading armies of sinister scorpions, hoverflies and other extra-terrestrial bugs, as well as their multi-legged overlord boss creatures. Judging by what we saw during a visit to Argonaut's offices, Buck Bumble should be a top treat for N64 fans. The fast-flying, bug-blasting action is reminiscent of Lylat Wars (hardly surprising seeing as Argonaut developed the original StarWing), except that you get complete freedom of movement within a level. The environments look great and everything is designed to beescale, so even a suburban back garden is pretty vast.Ubisoft has signed up the game for an autumn release. Watch out for it. NEW GAMES UDCOCOS It looks nice, but is it going to be better than Abe's Oddysee? Clearly the best bee game ever. @ "


"computer video games Having spent weeks playing Capture the Flag on Quake 2, it was about time we tried it out for real. But without the rocket launchers! MISSION: CHAOS Date: Saturday 28th March Time: 0930 Hours Location: A dew-filled forest in St Albans. Mission: To blast the crap out of each other with luminous coloured paint. Alex... or is it Ben Gazarra? Players: An elite selection of CVG, Game-Online, PlayStation Plus and Nintendo Magazine team members. Plus Phil Dawson and the Mean Machines legend Oz Browne. Only one possible outcome: Complete and utter CHAOS. Once everybody was kitted out with semi-automatic guns, copious amounts of paint, and the relevant protection, it was time to move onto the first game. The time for Vietnam movie quotes was over, and the joking stopped. It's now blues against whites. Man on man. Paint versus paint. LUKE. YOU NEVER CALL. YOU NEVER WRITE I LOVE THE SMELL OF DULUX IN THE MORNING! ALL SPREAD OUT IN A BUNCH A pathetic attempt at camouflage which failed to save this headcase You're 'avin' a laarf inchya? ER, WHAT'S A GUN? DOML Phil Dawson (right) emerged as the clown of the day, by asking the marshals. \"How do you hold the guns?\" Oz was shot in the foot by Tom. Jaime seemed to be out first nearly every go and Alex spent all day trying to light a match on his stubble. Ed took great pleasure in standing just out of peo ple's range and taunting them as their bullets landed just in front of him. And Steve was in admiration of the flashy gun he got for organising the event. The object of most of the games is to get your opponents' flag and return it to either your base or theirs. The first battle followed this rule, but had a slightly different twist. Across the middle of the level was a ditch, and the only way you could cross this was by two bridges at either end. Gaining control of these bridges was paramount, and despite nearly half of the white team trying to cram themselves behind one bush, they managed this successfully. After two Kamikaze rebels had the flag returned to the white base, it was moved back once it emerged that they were absolutely caked in paint. This left the way for the sniping white team members, and our own Steve Key, to do what the fellow whites could not do and return the flag. The first victory. 20 3 98 zs a sa FEATURE AT THE END OF THE DAY... Despite the best efforts of Steve, Jaime and Ed on the white team, the remainder of the CVG crew on the blues came out victorious. There were some nasty injuries, a few comedy stories, but an excellent was had by all.
