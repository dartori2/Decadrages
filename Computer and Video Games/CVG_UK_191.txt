That's the reason why the logo is just yellow, instead of red and yellow like most McDonalds restaurants.

Why? Because the biggest video game system in all the world isn't PlayStation, it's Tamagotchi! You know it, and the guys flogging crap imitations know it. This is getting to be such a problem that in South Korea there is a government ban on Tamagotchi in schools. Same goes for some schools in Hong Kong and Thailand. Another popular complaint from Asian officials is that Tamagotchi is a pretty poor, fairly premature introduction to the concept of death. (It can get pretty upsetting we suppose...). Bandai, the company responsible for the original Tamagotchi, have the answer Angel Tamagotchi. Instead of dying, Angel Tamagotchi floats up to virtual heaven to enjoy eternal life. It's expected that 40 million Tamagotchis will have been sold worldwide by March 1998. 40 million!!! RPG 390019 hit cartoon (anime) series. Pockemon is a nationwide phenomenon approaching Tamagotchi status. So much so that it's outselling Square's state-of-the-art masterwork week on week. Pockemon has already passed the three-million sales mark, and we expect it to have taken the lead by the time you read this. Japan is also expecting an N64 version to be announced at Famicom Space World (Nintendo's pre-Christmas tade show). Earth to Nintendo UK... we think you should take a look at something.

"computer video games PLEASE SEND YOUR LETTERS TO: CVG MAIL BAG COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES, 37-39 MILLHARBOUR, THE ISLE OF DOGS, LONDON E14 9TZ MAIL BAG Under no circumstances can we replay personally to any of your letters. Not for money, or even if you're a beautiful girl. Damn. MAILBAG.CVG@ECM.EMAP.COM HAPPY AS A PIG IN POO nly one page of Mailbag. Don't say you didn't notice! Reason is we've just got too much else to show you this month, so we had to eat into this section with the Golden Joysticks. Dear CVG Please take a seat, as I am about to say some thing outstanding: a sentence so ironic that it will blow your balls off. \"I've heard that one before\" | hear you say (and you have my pity if it's true) but I guarantee that you haven't, here goes: \"I am a Saturn owner and I am glad it is doing poorly in the console market!\" TAMAGOTCHI TORTURE! ber gamers assemble! The coolest gaming dudes around. And they don't sing. Dear CVG, What a good magazine you have, running with the best news and best of all Tamagotchi news and ideas. My brother has found the best way to kill a Tamagotchi. He put it in a bowl of water which killed it instantly, turning it back into an egg. It has now fallen into a coma and none of the buttons work. But thanks to the man in the shop he got his money back. He now lives in a cardboard box in his room crying, because the shop couldn't give him a new one. Yes, that's right. The fool said it. But it's true. I believe that the Saturn's failure to penetrate the mass market has been for the better. Had it been accepted as well as the PlayStation has been, I doubt we would have seen the likes of NIGHTS, or Panzer Dragoon Zwei. Instead the Saturn market would have been flooded, nay drowned in dull, predictable games, much like Sony's position now. Ghostface Killah is my latest creation, and I even had to take him into my GCSEs. I have today joined Jaime's record of 18 years old. Perhaps you could start a record of the best age achieved by readers and the CVG lot. Every person I hear says my computer's better than yours, but I think my Tamagotchi is the best. Tom: For Sega fans I don't think the Saturn's 'failure to penetrate the mass market' has been for the better. The Saturn now seems to have a limited future, with Sega already working on a new machine. The PlayStation, on the other hand, looks far from reaching the ceiling of its capabilities. If the roles were reversed, we might well be seeing the Saturn continuously pushed to new limits. I love my Saturn and I want Sega to be successful (so they keep bringing out ace software), but I don't deserve your UBER SATURN GAMER moniker. I'm in awe of PlayStation stuff too, like Rage Racer and Time Crisis. ABUSE OF THE QUEEN'S ENGLISH BY CVG READERS I have found a cheat that although you may know, your readers will not know of. Although I did not use this method for my latest creation I have managed to find a new type of alien. To cheat go onto the time screen and press A and C to change the time. Change the time to bed time and put him to sleep. Now change the time to 9.00 (or when yours wakes) and he will gain a year. This can be repeated at 30 years old and the alien will change. Please start a monthly feature. Tim Wolfe-Murray, Ashford. If the Saturn had been launched with all the best games it has now, the market share index would be totally the opposite of what it is now. Just imagine if people had bothered to learn how to program from the beginning and instead of Virtua Fighter, Daytona, Clockwork Knight, Panzer Dragoon and Victory Goal being the launch titles, we could well have had Fighters Megamix, Sega Rally, Sonic Jam, Panzer Dragoon Zwei and Worldwide Soccer. Each of these titles being the pinnacle of their respective genres. However, this was not so and because of Sony's position in the market a new breed of gamers have evolved: \"The BER SATURN GAMERS\". Ed: It's stupid to say that a console doing badly with great games is a good thing. I honestly don't care what system a game's on as long it's good fun, and there are loads of things I'm looking forward to on all the machines. I just appreciate the work that goes into a lot of Sega's Saturn games more than most people. Your club sounds dumb so I won't be in it, thanks. CVG: Sorry about your brother's Tamagotchi. Obviously throwing the little feller into a bowl of water wasn't what we had in mind! We do have a monthly Tamagotchi feature, it's called Tamagotchi Farm and it's in Editorial! THE V-RALLY MYSTERY This species appreciates more than just a see-through vapour trail or an all-way-through commentary. They are not impressed by bucket-loads of FMV or \"bangin' choons\" in games. Instead we USGS (as I refer to them) demand precision and hard core gameplay. We know in our heart that Saturn is home to the very best and most original games, far above anything on rival \"machines\". The Saturn has proved itself more than worthy of a place in every home in the world! I noticed upon reading your #189 August '97 edition preview of V-Rally, the screenshots has minor differences from the V-Rally that I have. Is this a demo or foreign version you have been play testing. For example: your screenshot says you can change between snow, asphalt and gravel, whereby the version I have does not have this. And in your screenshot, night driving against competitors, the road is totally dark where as in mine, only one player TT has this total night driving. Can you explain the reason for differences and if you are playing a demo I think you bring this out to your readers as I know they are probably wondering the same thing. Also if this a demo why did they take this night driving option away from the final release? KMC@kops.demon.co.uk Of course this is a very exclusive club; members include people like Ed Lomas, Tom Guise, Richard Leadbetter, and myself. I shall finish with our club meeting... Rich: By my special dust gathering gauge (N64, about 2mm, PS around 4mm, Saturn Omm) it would appear that I agree with some of what you say. Rage Racer and Time Crisis impressed me, but not enough to make me want to take those games home. N64? Well Goldeneye intrigues me, making it the first game I've wanted to play since WaveRace. With Saturn though, the likes of Last Bronx and Marvel Super Heroes are only the latest in a long line of games that have graced my home machine. And there's more ace stuff to come all EXCLUSIVE to Saturn (VF3, X-Men vs Street Fighter, Quake etc). However, your minority market argument is blown out of the water, through the stratosphere and into a neighbouring star system when you consider the mass market appeal of the Mega Drive, which certainly didn't lack \"ass-kicking games\". As for being a member of your BER SATURN GAMERS association. Well, all right, but I draw the line at singing your preposterous \"anthem\". Now I grow tired of this insolence. Long live the Saturn, May it continue to have a minority market and thoroughly ass-kicking games!!! LETTERS Thank you for your time. I hope your readership agree with my points. Craig Ward, Lincolnshire CVG: The version handed to CVG for review was obviously very different from the one which went on sale. Inside sources have revealed that certain features were 'jamming up the game, so had to be removed. These weren't so minor either the analogue controller isn't compatible, and the link-up option is not included. The reason you can't change tyres in the finished game is because Ocean decided that the simulation aspect didn't quite fit into the overall feel of the game. If you still have any worries, there's a helpline number in the instruction manual. STAR LERNER I DREAM OF SPICE GIRLS SPICE Dear CVG, I had a dream yesterday about the Spice Girls being made into a computer game!!! Edward Yau, Hogganfield CVG: You won't have to dream about it for too much longer Edward. Please give us a call about your software prize. 14 "

"computer video games TOZOO PRESS START 36 100% COMPLETE FIGHTING GAME BY ARIKA ARCADE VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD TM PlayStation OUT NOW (IMPORT) 1-2 PLAYERS  RELEASED BY CAPCOM TEL IMPORTER PlayStation One of the most underrated Street Fighter games hits the PlayStation! And proves to be a Tot more than just a normal arcade port-over! STREEHOTED plus 3D polygon-filled Street Fighter game was something the public had been calling for ever since Virtua Fighter and Tekken hit the scene. The rather fickle games-playing masses had been wowed with graphics rather than gameplay. And despite the fact that any SF was, and still is, one of the most addictive games around, polygons won over sprites in the popularity stakes. And so Street Fighter EX was born! The PlayStation version is unique compared to other arcade conversions, in that a wealth of consoleonly features have been added. Extra characters, new playing modes and secret bonus games are just some of the awesome new elements, and rest assured, we'll be highlighting them all to you in the coming months! ALL-NEW CHARACTERS FOR HOME VERSION! NEW EX CHARACTERS FOR THE PLAYSTATION CONVERSION! The standard array of new playing modes obviously weren't enough for the people who coded the home version of EX, as they stuck in a few new characters as well! Sakura and Dhalsim have both been added to the home version, but in all truth only one of them is worth playing as. Check out a few of the other secret characters in the game as well! PRESS START DHALSIIN NEW EX CHARACTERS FOR THE Sadly not as effective as Sakura, but still a nice character for novelty value. He now has an air super move and his teleport is succeeded by a strange ripply effect. His speed still lets him down though. Even the huge frame of Zangief is no match for the Cycloids. This air throw is activated by hitting punch when both fighters are aside each other in mid-air. PRESS 44 EVIL RYU OD 2019) EN 95 He had many PlayStation owners going green with envy when they found out he was only in Saturn SFA2. The evil version has a Firecracker move, a Super Dragon Punch attack and a teleport move. BEE CRIERE UKG: COMING SOON SAKURA Don't be fooled by the schoolgirl attire, Sakura is one tough cookie! She has retained all of her moves from Alpha 2, with the 5-hit Dragon Punch still being her most effective weapon. PRESS START CYCLOIDS GAMMA BETA BETAGNE These two are prototype robots representing the different stages of development. The wireframe (Gamma) and the transparent (Beta) are similar to Dural. They both have selections of all the other characters moves. 16 "


"BACK TO AMUSE YOU! SPECIAL computer video games SUPER LEVEL 1 SUPER LEVEL 3 KO The background explosions have become an even bigger way of showing off even, than finishing with a 12-hit combo. The satisfaction gained from seeing the screen explode under your Super Dragon Punch is one of smug pleasure. The finishing explosions for EX have undergone a little change as well. Whenever you kill someone with a special attack (fireball, dragon punch) you get the same flashing background as Alpha 2. Slightly more impressive is when you finish with super move, because you get a small meteor flying through space. A level three finish is shown by the same meteor, only this time it heads off towards Earth! Cool! PlayStation THE ULTIMATE TEST OF SKILL! Even though the main game is top in itself, it is extremely well complimented by the Expert Practice mode. Basically, this is an ultra tough training mode, but one which holds multiple benefits should you manage to complete it. 1 START TO EXIT KEN NO.11 RANK BI TOTO 0000 3 K-75EK-ZEF PRESS SELECT TO EXIT 2 POSITION PESET Do you recognise the character on Hokuto's umbrella? You should do, because it's none other than E. Honda from Street Fighter 2 fame. 2 HIT 93 NEW EY CHARACTERS FOR THE PLAYSTATION CONVERSION! SUCCESS CITUO NO.6 xD 6/16 1. You have the choice of all 19 initial characters and each of those have 16 moves or combos to carry out. Each move is given a rank from E to A, with A being the toughest. 2. Once you have carried out this move, you're given a set amount of points and progress onto the next one. The first five are the standard special moves (fireballs etc) and the rest become more and more complicated combos and chains after that. 3. As you go to select a character, you'll notice some faces of the secret characters on the right of the screen that are blacked out. Once you have reached 100 points, the bar will rise above the character, and they'll now become selectable in the main game. There are a total of seven secret fighters to get. 4. The ultimate challenge is to complete every character's moves to clear the screen. But what do you get for that? All will be revealed next month when we should have the British version for review! 21 For each throw you perform on an enemy, the camera zooms in to give you a clearer indication of what is going on. COMING THROUGH! La SICAA 10.9  TELESERSERSTELLER Another new feature to EX is the Guard Breaker. Every fighter has one and it's a very useful way to break through an enemy to start a combo. By hitting any kick and punch button of the same strength, the screen will dim for a moment and your character will charge up for a split second. He or she will then unleash an unblockable attack that pierces through anybody attempt ing to guard against it. The only catch is that it uses one bar from your SuperMeter so use them sparingly. 202/304 IIIIIIIIIIETE 17 "


"computer Video games 10TON PRESS START Kairi takes it upon himself to introduce Dhalsim's head to the floor! Alka Seltzer?? M amera da bagno TM PlayStation STICE 2 CHAIN REACTION! Although EX doesn't have a revolutionary new combo system or anything like that, it has been made easier, as it's now possible to string almost any moves into Special and Super Attacks. Timing is crucial when attempting the latter, as it is best to try and let the Super gain a couple of hits before finishing the motion for the next attack. The first super will cause your character to flash yellow. Chain a second onto that and you'll flash green with the final attack resulting in a red glow around you. Not only does it look impressive, but can also drain untold amounts of energy if done correctly. STANDARD INIO SPECIAL CHAINS! SUPER MOVE CHAINS! Two-in-ones have been in Street Fighter games for years, but in EX a whole load of moves can be chained together. Most notably sweeping medium and hard kicks can now be linked with Dragon Punches for combos. NEW EX CHARACTERS FOR THE PLAYSTATION CONVERSION! SEREN Chun Li begins her combo with two fireballs and kick for the Thousand Rending Kicks. Although this may look easy, trying to execute them is far more difficult. Ken starts with a sweeping medium kick... ...and immediately follows this up with a Dragon Punch. True masters can stick a Super Fireball on the end! HAT SPECIALINIO SUPER CHAINS! In a way, these are easier to do than the new two-in-ones! Being as most of the Supers are just extensions of a special move, chaining a hurricane kick into a super hurricane for instance, is very easy. 87 COMING SOON C Then execute two fireballs and punch for the Super Fireball after at the kicks score two hits. Z HIT 3 HIT URL As soon as she starts to produce the fireball, you must move into another Rending Kick. Ryu connects with two hits of the new-style And because you perform the same motion for Hurricane Kicks, which are all like Dan's from Alpha 2. every hit, the Super Hurricane is activated! 18 "


"I'M THE FIRECRACKER! computer video games 139600 PRESS START 1 MIK 20 6 HIT PlayStation 2RS STAR Gouki's Firecracker move from Street Fighter Alpha 2 is one of the most powerful in the game. Anything that does at least 60% percent damage should you get suckered in, has got to be pretty nasty! For EX, not only have they beefed it up a bit (you see Japanese symbols fly around the screen) but another five characters also have one! Sakura, Skullo, Kairi, Evil Hokuto and Evil Ryu all have them. Skullo's is pretty impressive as it flashes each hit from various camera angles around the arena, in a similar fashion to Star Gladiator. Cool! wer NEW EX CHARACTERS FOR THE PLAYSTATION CONVERSION! 193001 192101 532 NOOS ININO) IMO A guard breaker leaves enemies susceptible to rear attacks. This spin kick is a very useful way to finish off a combo. Once Garuda gets close, his spikes and speed will maul you! SLIP SLIDING AWAY! FINAL ROUND... FIGHT! Remember that if you are playing as Gouki or Evil Ryu you have the ability to teleport away from your opponents attacks by moving towards or away from the camera. In the previous 20 games, Gouki and Ryu would teleport through an opponent, but now they rotate 900 clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on whether a kick or punch button is used. The way to perform them is a reverse Dragon Punch pad movement, followed by all three punch or kicks. As arcade conversions go, this is ranks as one of the best. And with all the extra modes, SF EX Plus Alpha could be another Capcom classic. We'll have all the details when we review the British version in a couple of months. Stay tuned! 19 "

When the game is played with the cartridge in the slot, the animation is more than doubled in most places so that it's pretty much the same as the arcade version! Even without the cart the Saturn version looks better, mostly down to the fact that the machine has slightly more internal RAM than the PlayStation. Because of this, all of the screenshots in this feature were done with the Saturn version of the game. INS Without the cartridge, each character has only three standing animation frames (the same as Street Fighter Alpha 2) but with the extra RAM, they move too smoothly to count! Normally the fighters only have a single crouching frame of animation, but with the cartridge they can be seen to breathe and move subtly all the time! Gorgeous!

QUAKE! uake is one of the best games ever made, no doubt about it. The PC version was released over a year ago and is still played daily by thousands of people on the internet. The amazing technology showed just how brilliant PCs can be for games, and the gameplay was tuned to perfection. The movement of every item in the game, the speed at which each weapon reloads, the damage done by the weapons, it was all fine-tuned through months of playing the game. So it's not surprising that console owners have been demanding a version of Quake that they can play without spending thousands of pounds on a big PC. The first console to get the game is the Saturn, and it's apparently going to be the only 32-bit machine to have Quake, seeing as no-one has managed to make a good enough version on the PlayStation.

Now you know why Psygnosis are so confident of a Christmas number one slot for G-Police. LAGE GIS-2 ROADHEDS 170G ROM e're just sitting here, wondering how big the pile of money that Psygnosis are going to make this Christmas will be. That's not us being toady gits, either. That's us after having sampled the stuff that they're going to be flogging PlayStation owners in the run-up to the Yuletide season. There's Colony Wars, F1 '97, Overboard (not a flash game but it's definitely one that deserves attention) and G-Police, the 3D shoot-'em-up that is set to be a sure-fire hit with all the world's WipEout fans. Psygnosis chief lan Hetherington has his heart set on this game being the Christmas number one, and from where we're standing it looks like his wish stands a good chance of coming true. G-POLICE G-POLICE NUCLEAR STRIKE MEETS WIPEOUT 2097 P3 COLONY WARS The setting for G-Police is an off-world colony on Callisto, one of Jupiter's more hospitable moons, in the year 2097. The colony is made up of a cluster of domes which contain sky-scraping office blocks, apartment buildings, factories and spaceports. Ground vehicles and airborne traffic follow a grid of highways and elevated roadways, and travel between the domes via acceleration tunnels (enter at one end and WHOOSH! suddenly you're out the other). As you can see from the screenshots, the dense cityscape and the atmospheric nighttime setting bestow a distinctly Blade Runner look on the game. Plus, the darkness has given the programmers an easy means of disguising any polygon pop-up in the middle distance. Hey, we're not complaining. -FFTER EURO 1 Cool future-scape or what! Neons blaze from the side of buildings. Cool. WREAKING HAVOC G-Police puts you in the stout shoes of Jeff Slater, a pilot who maintains law and order from the cockpit of his HAVOC gunship. It's a big job. The colony is run by vast corporations which are constantly at war with each other, and the atmosphere of anarchy means violent crime is rife. There are 35 missions to complete, a real mixture of investigation, apprehension and outright annihilation, with plenty of dogfighting and bombing-run action to keep life exciting. Some of the missions comprise only a single objective find something and destroy it but in others you're sent out on patrol and have to respond to whatever situations arise, from checking out suspect vehicles to chasing down robbers on combat motorcycles to tackling huge enemy gunships. Later in the game, you have to co-ordinate your efforts with those of your wingman, and occasionally of ground forces, which adds another element to the gameplay. Some of the coolest pyros you'll ever see on PlayStation. 28 "


"SCANNERS computer video games In some missions your objective is simply to locate an object, and in others you have to identify a target before you can destroy it. This is where your scanner comes in handy. A tap of the R1 button selects a target and a bar at the bottom of the screen shows the progress of the scan. If it's the target you were looking for, go ahead and destroy it the scanner also incorporates an integrity gauge to show how much damage the target has taken. PlayStation THE BIG BANG ROM One of G-Police's most appealing features is the vast electromagnetic pulse to disable a craft perfect for caparray of utterly spectacular weapons you get to play with. turing criminals without eliminating them.

But -hoo boy! when those bombs go off you get a laser and plasma cannons, and a weapon that fires an display of pyros rarely seen on a PlayStation. THE FLYING SQUAD 1 Scan enemy fighters to see what they're carrying. LET TE The best way to describe the HAVOC is as a helicopter gunship without rotors. It's a highly manoeuvrable craft that uses powerful vec tored thrust to jet forward, hover and reverse in the dense clutter of buildings. Unfortunately, it's not the easiest craft to control. Remember Warhawk? Well it handles similarly to the ship in that game, forcing you to co-ordinate separate controls for forward and reverse speed and hovering higher or lower. The fact that you're flying through enclosed spaces makes things all the more difficult, and you may find your first few missions consist of a lot of bouncing from one wall to another. Thankfully, you don't lose any shield energy for these collisions, but if you're in a combat situation any sudden loss of control can prove deadly. 70 1 What's this truck hiding?

The version of the code we looked at was practically complete, but only included four missions. Nevertheless, that was enough to whet our appetites for what could well be one of the best PlayStation games of the year. The finished item is on the shelves on October 24th, but watch out for our review next issue. Yes, a PC version of G-Police is due for release on CD-ROM on October 24th, the same day as the PlayStation version. Alas, like an increasing number of PC games these days, you will only be able to play it if you have a 3D graphics board installed. Looks like it's Unavoidable Upgrade Time again. Sigh. 29 "

This month we've had a nigh-complete beta to play with and all we can say is, prepare for the drive of your life! TAG HEUER Official Timing sequel which has the current year xperience has taught us that a sequel which has the current year at the end of the title doesn't always differ much from what's gone before. As we reported in the August issue, this isn't going to be the case with Formula 1 '97. As well as updating the Formula One teams, drivers and tracks for the 1997 season, Liverpool-based developers Bizarre Creations have included a host of new features and major technical refinements. Now we've had a chance to play a 95%-complete beta version of the game we can give you a more accurate idea of how the finished game will play when it's released in September. FORMULA 1'97 MODE RAGE One of the criticisms levelled at Psygnosis' first Formula One game was that the two game modes. Arcade and Grand Prix, were almost indistinguishable. This time the differences are immediately noticeable. 3 MRCAVE Choose LEAD DAMON TO VICTORY IN FORMULA 1 '97 SUF In the Time Attack you continuously do circuits, trying to beat the current best lap time. A clock in the corner of the screen shows how well you're doing over the whole lap and over split laps. Choose Narcade mode ARCADE MODE 33TORIA and you get to drive any of the eleven team cars in three different classes, made up of five tracks each. In both, the standard race rules (flags, pit-stops, etc) are waived and the cars' handling has been greatly simplified. Now they drive more like the Ridge Racer vehicles than F1 racers. They don't suffer damage in crashes, and you can powerslide them through tight corners. Also they don't spin off if you leave the tarmac, which means you can cut corners with hardly any penalty. In both modes there is an extra super-tough class, Epic, which only appears when you've completed all three standard classes. ADAN GRAND PRIX L ALESI 7 19   TAG HEUER Official Timing NI YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD! 66 LAPTINE 2242108 Accurately modelled cars and courses displayed in the PlayStation's 512 x 240 high-resolution mode visually make F1 '97 massively superior to its forerunner. Even better is the fact that you can view the action from an incredible eight different angles, from high above the car to just over the rear wing to inside the cockpit. And by pressing down on the control pad you can flip the all the views by 180 degrees to check who's coming up behind. Who needs wing mirrors? POSITION 16/22 This is the (very) real thing. Choose your team and driver, then set up your car's tyres, brakes, suspension, and the front and rear wings. Test your setup by going for a practice drive or you can skip straight to a qualifying lap or the full race. This is where you discover that the handling is entirely different from the arcade cars. The improved physics models accurately simulate driving a very light, finely-balanced super car, and any driver who is a bit slack about braking for corners or finding the racing line you WILL spend a lot of time spinning in the gravel traps. In this mode you also have to worry about the race marshals' flags, damage to the car, system failures and timing your pit stops for fuel and fresh tyres and high speed repairs. 25 17 In the arcade race mode you drive against the clock and a field of 21 other drivers. Make it into the points (sixth or better) to progress to the next race in the class. The new in-car cockpit view with arms! Looking back from your car is very useful.

This head-to-head game has just the two of you on the track, but it uses the same high resolution screen mode as the solo game, and works very well. In case you're wondering, there's no link cable mode. Bizarre say that the first game's link mode was a major headache and they haven't had the development time to spend on creating one for F1 '97.

Both have remarkable amounts of detail! SUNDAY DRIVERS PIT-IN! C FASTERIES The Grand Prix mode is a daunting experience, even for experienced PlayStation race fans. There are five selectable skill levels that control the computer drivers' Al (substantially reworked since the first game, incidentally), but there are also numerous other options that set how hard a race you'll have. You can deactivate things like damage, flags, system failures, fuel depletion and tyre wear. You can also control the weather so that rain doesn't spoil the race. For drivers with no confidence at all, there are two extra-helpful options: 'Brakes Assist' automatically reduces your speed as you approach a corner, and 'Steer Assist' uses tyre tracks to show you best line to take around the circuit, and weights the steering so you always stay pretty close to it. F1 PC-COMING SOON! After a change in the weather or taking a shunt listen out for the crackling voice of your pit crew leader coming over the radio to suggest you pull in for a change of tyres or repairs. Enter the pit lane and the car drives itself to your garage where the crew get to work. The time they take depends on what needs to be done replacing a nose cone takes a while and you have until they've finished to make minor adjustments, such as selecting different tyres.

COLONUARS RYBY 14 T EL: T2 27 302 ONIN SMOKERS PATEL olony Wars takes us to a future in which humanity has been forced to move out into the galaxy, building colonies on 40 worlds, all governed by the iron hand of The Tsar. Not everyone cares for the Iron Hand system of government, though, and many colonists are joining the League of Free Worlds, a rebel group who risk life and limb harassing the Imperial Navy in deep space. In Colony Wars you're cast as one of those rebels, complete with a heavily armed starfighter, an itchy trigger finger and a fervour for destroying evil. Are you pilot enough to bring down a sinister empire that likes to push the little guy around, then have a good laugh about it afterwards? ACTIVATE VIEWER! Fatsaking N ELI PSYGNOSIS CHALLENGE STAR WARS! TSAR WARS You expect amazing graphics in a Psygnosis game and Colony Wars won't disappoint. It's packed with superb light-sourced, texture-mapped ships and interplanetary scenery, and a host of fantastic pyrotechnical effects that wouldn't look out of place in a big budget movie. However this game actually exceeds the usual Playstation standard by using one of the machine's high resolution screen modes. The action is displayed on a 512x240 pixel screen which really brings up the detail in the graphics, and yet the game still runs at a smooth 30 frames per second. The overall effect is awesome! But impressive though our demo version looked, Psygnosis are promising that the finished game will be even better! HUS RATES DED Psygnosis are boldly billing Colony Wars as \"the most believable and detailed space epic since Star Wars\", which, on the face of it, is akin to John Lennon comparing The Beatles to Jesus. There is substance to the claim though. Colony Wars contains 15 minutes of Psygnosis-quality (ie. smart) FMV, with James Earl Jones (\"Voice Of Vader\") doing the storytelling. The game also has a non-linear plot development, which means your performance determines your route through the game, and the ultimate fate of the League in one of six different game endings.

COMING SOON Colony Wars has 70 different campaign missions, which are the usual mixture of strike sorties and riding shotgun for larger craft, as well as six training missions which cover dogfighting and bombing. As you progress through the game you get to pilot a broader range of starfighters with the power to match your increasingly ambitious mission objectives. The six ships differ in looks and handling and firepower, with the most advanced craft packing various kinds of lasers, electro-magnetic pulse weapons, automatic tail guns and a selection of homing rockets. Yes sir, if you want to demolish things in an interplanetary setting, this is the game for you. YOU AIN'T SEEN NUTHIN' YET! TARLET SHELL AHOL The Colony Wars demo we've seen was prepared for E3 and it looks very slick, but Psygnosis are saying that the latest versions actually crap all over it.

Eh-eh-xcellent! THE SIMPSONS: naglalaro VIRTUAL SPRINGFIELDS po ng taong ito JEREH SARINEFIELD xploring the Simpsons' home town must be something of a dream for the fans of the award-winning cartoon comedy. And abraca-marketing! here's a PC CD-ROM product which lets you roam the streets of Springfield in 3D, rooting through the desks, dressing tables and closets of its most honoured citizens in some kind of crazy scavenger hunt. All of your favourite characters are here, voiced by the original cast for extra authenticity. The Simpsons' creator himself, Matt Groening, has also had a hand in the project, giving some creative guidance where it was needed. From what we've seen, the atmosphere and the gags are pretty much up to snuff, but what does Virtual Springfield offer as a game? Springfield Gorge venue for top Simpsons stunts. The king of nuclear safety officers, hard at work. Hi-jinx with Sideshow Mel in Krustilu Studios. THE SIMPSONS ENTER THE THIRD DIMENSION! SA GOL GOL FOR THE SAKE OF THE CITY! MMM... FREE TRADING CARDS... You don't get complete freedom when you're walking around the 3D streets of Springfield. Instead you have to follow the roads, then decide which direction to take when you hit a junction. So, okay, it runs on rails to some degree, but you still have to find your way around, and that's where the pull-down map comes in. The map shows the locations that you can actually visit, all key scenes from the show, and you just have to navigate the streets to find them. TEWAY The object of Virtual Springfield's game is to track down an entire set of 73 'Springfield Character' trading cards. Usually you'd go to the Android's Dungeon And Comic Book Store and buy the whole set, but seeing as it's not open in this game you have to trek around all of Springfield where there might be some lying around hidden behind pictures, or propping up wobbly tables. Not all of these locations are immediately accessible, though, and gaining entry some times requires a bit of detective work to find a key or a password or a special club ring.

Where else would you get the opportunity to rummage through Bart Simpson's closet full of sinister and unhealthy toys? STUFF FROM THE SHOW THE DE SHARPS UP AND ATOMI There are entertainments to be had here besides the collection of trading cards. At various locations there are sub-games to play. Not surprisingly, the Noiseland, Arcade is home to some of the games that have been seen in the show, such as Super Slugfest (which Bart used to play against Homer on his console at home) and Larry The Looter, in which a thief runs along a street smashing shop windows and grabbing hi-fis until a storekeeper blows his head off with a shotgun. To add to the experience, all the arcade games have the cheesey, stylised look and the buzzy, NES-like sounds and music that they did on TV. UTEA Virtual Springfield is clearly being designed with Simpsons nerds in mind, and half the fun is spotting the objects, sights, sounds and even songs from particular shows. For example, musical references to Homer's old Barber Shop quartet, 'The Be-Sharps', are rife, and if you make it inside the Stonecutters' mansion you can hear Homer singing their secret anthem. And as you dash past the town hall, check out the sundial and you'll see the chalked outline of Monty Burns' slumped body from the 'Who Shot Mr Burns?' episodes. AND if you head over to Krustilu Studios, you might see one of Krusty's performing monkeys blowing smoke sculptures of the whole Krusty Show cast including Sideshow Luke 1 Perry while nextdoor you can catch a couple of specially-created-forthe-game cartoons starring Itchy and Scratchy!

WOW VIEWTON) TORT AD In the USA, Fox Interactive are tying in the release of Virtual Springfield with a competition run by Pepsi and stateside home builder, Kaufman and Broad, to win a house precisely modelled on the Simpsons' own four-bedroomed abode. In fact the house has been built using the same floor plan as the Simpson house in the game! Is that a marketing stunt or what? Alas, the same competition won't be running in the UK, but we just thought we should tell you everything. The version of Virtual Springfield we saw wasn't quite complete, but the action is more or less there. We think it's safe to say that fans of the show will get a big kick out of this.

Football season is back and that means no more cricket, no more Saturday afternoons spent watching A-Team and Airwolf on the TV, and no more stupid Australian football teams on our pools coupons. The new signings have been paraded, the realisation that it could be another long slog against relegation (ie Everton) have sunk in, and the papers breathe a sigh of relief because they were getting fed up of writing stories about how many foreigners Arsenal and Chelsea have bought. Gremlin's timing has to be applauded, because now is the perfect time to be putting the finishing touches to their eagerly awaited sequel to Actua Soccer. Altogether now It's coming home, it's coming home, Football's coming home... ALAN SHEARER SIGNS FOR GREMLIN! SHEARER IN TRANSFER SHOCKER!

CZECH REPUBL 3 UP ABOVE, DOWN BELOW NOOS ININO) The camera angles often left a lot to be desired in the original game, so this time, they have been dramatically improved. You never lose the ball off the edge of the screen now, and more fixed camera viewpoints have been added to supplement to roaming view. The overhead view is one which we found to be particularly good, as it drew back memories of Sensible Soccer. Those were the days eh? Even though you can't tell this from the pictures, the game runs at a much smoother rate. The anima tion has also been improved to prevent break up when the view is on one of the closer, follow-the-ball cameras. VISIT SUNNY WIGAN! The behind-goal view will rotate back and forth with the action. HE MUST SCORE! All of the stadiums you play at in Actua Soccer 2 are the real thing. Every single English and Scottish Premiership side has their stadium in it, most of the English First Division and even some lower than that, like the Alfred McAlpine Stadium, home to Huddersfield. As far as we can tell, supporters of the clubs that have just moved to new stadiums need not worry, as their new homes will be updated before the game is released. Already this is looking far better than the original, and if Gremlin can completely smooth out all of the bugs, this could prove to a another smash hit! 38 "

Play a crucial part, on your N64 ROBOTECH CRYSTAL DREAMS ROBOTECH n America and Japan, Robotech is more than an anime series. 86 episodes of the vast story have gained classic status, and a large fan base. In the UK the series is little more than a cult classic, with the series never broadcast on TV and only available on video. Gametek are hoping all this will change, with the release of Robotech: Crystal Dreams. As ace pilot Kyle Bartley, you fly for the Robotech Defence Force. Piloting your Veritech fighter against Zentraedi forces, Ebolian legions and renegade members of the RDF. Along the way you'll be assisted by famous characters from the series like Rick Hunter and Minmei. Get ready to enter the Robotech universe! * ROBOTECH'S ZENTRAEDI ARMY! * At the start of the game, Zentraedi forces are attacking RDF installations. Six cruisers have entered Earth orbit. Earth's Zentraedi are aiding the RDF in a counter-strike. The newly built SDF-3 is caught in the middle, currently on field test duties. Occurring six months before the SDF-3 is to leave for Tirol, there is growing public opinion that the SDF should remain at Earth. The RDF has no info on the identity or motivations of the attackers. Arriving at the SDF-3 to cover the story, Zentraedi forces suddenly start attacking the Super Dimensional Fortress. As Kyle you must join the battle. * THE LAST STARFIGHTER PLAY A PART IN THE ROBOTECH UNIVERSE Much like Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, where you played Dash Rendar a character created specifically for the story and game. In Crystal Dreams you play Kyle Bartley, a character new to the world of Robotech. Bartley has a long back story, so he fits into the universe. A former RDF pilot, who fought at the end of the Malcontent Uprisings. Bartley was in love with Vala Norri, a micronized Zentraedi, but an incident during the Uprisings ended the relationship. Leaving the RDF because of a stained record, Kyle became a pilot for the Monument City Broadcasting System. Kyle flies to the SDF3, to cover news of Zentraedi attacks for the MBS. Vala is sta tioned on board the SDF 3. Perhaps Kyle can win her love back. WIJ TRANSFORMERS ROBOTS IN DISGUISE It couldn't be a believable Robotech game with out your own fully-functional mecha. Getting to fly your own Veritech fighter is one of the highlights of the game. As R:CD is primarily a space flight combat simulator (in other words it's like StarFox), these craft have to behave as fans would expect. Your Veritech can change between Fighter, Battloid and Guardian modes. Each mode handles differently, with distinct controls for each. Each mode has different strengths and weaknesses. The game is viewed from inside the cockpit, so change to a chase-cam view to see your craft transform into the different modes. 1. TMS 10.2331 1 Each model is properly articulated.

This year we get a Greek demi-god. Hercules, Disney's next animated feature, is due out in the UK on October 10th, and the game of the film will be hitting PlayStation and PC on October 31st. UK development house Eurocom have been working with Disney's own animation crews to produce their sword-swinging, distinctly platform-based interpretation of the movie. Are we to expect a re-run of Virgin's 16-bit Aladdin games? Looking at these pictures you might think so... but Hercules has a few surprises up his kilt. HERCULES RCUN < THE ROAD TO HEROISM SWORDS, SANDALS AND SIDEWAYS-SCROLLING The more spectacular levels in Hercules are the entirely 3D stages, which come in two forms. This effect is best seen in the Hydra level which, with its hardcore beast-beheading action, is quite something to behold. Most of the game is played out in horizontally-scrolling platform/ fighting style, starting off with a training level. Here Herc has to slice up training dummies to rescue damsel dummies, and use his noggin to reach hidden gold. Subsequent levels follow a similar format, with Hercules fighting off mechanical birds. centaurs, griffins and brigands with his sword and his fists. At certain points he can run into and out of the screen, dodging around obstacles, so these levels are almost like 3D mazes. Though they look 2D in these shots, the levels have a 3D appearance. Scenery is layered so it \"parallax scrolls', and cliffs and buildings are rendered as textured polygons so they appear to move in three dimensions as Hercules passes by.

"%86 COMPLETE computer video games RPG BY SQUARESOFT  PRICE .99 NO OTHER VERSION AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED STORAGE 3 CD  RELEASED BY SONY TEL 0171 447 1600 n EXCLUSIVE interview with Squaresoft's Final Fantasy VII team, combined with a preview of the English-language version. A stunning introduction to an awesome game. TM PlayStation NOV RELEASE 1 PLAYER PlayStation Squaresoft have rewritten the rules not just for RPGs, but for the future of game Everything you need to know how is here: s TM FIMILAITOSTI AN INTERVIEW WITH SQUARESOFT 1997 SQUARE CO. LTD. All Rights Reserved. THE MAKING OF HRONOBU SAKAGUCHI PRODUCER, The Siggraph version of Final Fantasy the one everyone expected to arrive on N64. But only PlayStation could handle it. What is the background to Final Fantasy Vir? In August 1995, one of US's largest CG conventions \"Siggraph\" was held in LA. At that time we were not sure what the next generation RPG game should look like, so as an experiment, we created a CG-based gamelike interactive demo to present at the show. It was focused on battle scenes, 100% real-time and polygon-based. That was the seed of Final Fantasy VII, and that was when we decided to make this a CG-based game. Then came the discussion on how to design the field scenes including events the actual story. Whether to make it illustration-based or CG-based, like the battle scenes. As we continued discussing, we came up with the idea to eliminate the connection between the movies and the fields. Without using black-out at all, and maintaining the quality at the same time, we would make the movie stop at one cut and make the characters move around on it. Then the next movie begins, and stops at another cut and then the characters move around on it. We tried to make it controllable even during movies as well. As a result of using a lot of motion data plus CG effects in still images, it turned out to be a mega-capacity game, and therefore we had to choose the CD-ROM as our media. In other words, we got too aggressive and put ourselves in trouble. What are the benefits of working with the World's largest developing team ? A larger developing team will not always create a better game, but with a project of such a scale as this you get to spend a lot of money, and you gain access to very highly-qualified staff. We were able to use many high-end machines, and work with approximately 100 highly-qualified staff, and I believe this was one of the largest game development teams in history. As a result, the final game generates a tremendous amount of energy. My theory was always this: If one person creates a game it can be a racing game or anything) and then ten people create the same game, the one created by ten peaple will eventually have a larger amount of energy in it. Probably because with a large amount of resources, each person will be able to put his/her passion into his own role, therefore creating depth in the game. In addition, in Final Fantasy VII, we hired staff who had extra high levels of energy and passion. I definitely hope the consumers will feel the amount of energy coming out of this game when they play it. I'm pretty confident that they will. COVER STORY 53 "


"computer video games Cloud \"Did Sephiroth... do this......? Explain the theme of Final Fantasy VII Ever since my mother passed away, which was when we were creating Final Fantasy III, I have been thinking about the theme \"life\". \"Life\" dwells in many things, and I was curious what will happen if I attempt to analyse \"Life\" in a mathematical and logical way. I'm an engineering major, so maybe this was my approach to overcome the mental shock in me. Although I've been occasionally sharing my thoughts on this issue with Mr. Uematsu, this is the first time in the Series that this particular theme is actually brought up in the game You might have difficulty noticing it, though. PlayStation U oli The message of Life which Mr Sakaguchi talks about refers to people, the creatures they encounter, and of the planet which supports them. In Final Fantasy VII, Makoh is the lifeforce which flows through every living thing. Kind of like The Force in Star Wars except Makoh can be contained, and then forged. This technology is controlled by the Shin-Ra organisation, who are endangering the planet by draining it of its energy: Makoh powers their incredible cities, and creates weapons for their armies. But untold crimes committed by Shin-Ra have driven the whole world toward a revolution. Yet what they're fighting is much bigger, many times more deadly, than Shin-Ra. Demn man get a hold of yourself!\" Cloud suffers disturbing flashbacks right through the game. These visions become increasingly horrifc and weird as he nears his goal. AVALANCHE WILL AVENGE THE DAMAGE YOU HAVE DONE SHINRAI GAAHI WIN! Why is Final Fantasy VII so good as a RPG ? The basic gameplay follows the previous games in the series. You develop your characters by fighting many battles. However, without changing the basic gameplay, the visual and sound effects have been significantly enhanced further drawing the player's emotions into the game. This approach has been taken ever since the series started. On the other hand, there were times when people would say \"One Way RPGs\". They don't say that as often any more, but the reason why they said that is, if you force the images on the players, they wouldn't get the feel of actually controlling the game. In order to avoid those responses, during Final Fantasy V & VI, we have done extensive research on how to make the players feel interactively involved in the game, while upgrading the visual and sound effects. The results of this research has been thoroughly carried out in Final Fantasy VII. THE MAKING OF The game is very cinematic, why? Films last for one to two hours, and you often get emotionally involved in them. The sense of getting emotionally involved in games is totally different compared to that. However, by adding interactive aspects to films, believe that players can get further into them even become one with the visual images. That is my goal. As for me, I have always been putting emphasis on visual and sound effects, so instead of making my games equivalent to films, I want my games to surpass films. FIGHTING AIN'T JUSTFOR KICKSI When treading dangerous ground your guys WILL encounter trouble, but battles in FFVII are so damn impressive that no one should miss the chance to take part! Besides, like the man says, you get nowhere unless you're any good at fighting!

"computer video games Tell us about Mr. Yoshinori Kitase, the Director of Final Fantasy VII I have been working with him since Final Fantasy V. When he joined Square, he told me he initially wanted to become a film director but that it was impossible to accomplish in Japan. He's pretty dry, and a man of black humour. If the previous versions of this series were a puppet show, this one was a real film requiring innovative effects including various camera angles. His experience of studying cinematography since college and creating private films has contributed a lot in meeting the requirements. He is the director of this game. How did you create the battles in Final Fantasy Vir? In battle scenes, we use a lot of camera angles and effects, paying attention to space and 3D. Therefore, the battle scenes become the highlight scenes. The 3D effect is best shown when you use \"Summon Beasts\". This has always been the most attractive scenes in games, but we had to struggle to show them effectively in 2D atmospheres. Now using 3D technology, broader effects have been accomplished. PlayStation Lou YOSHINORI KITA SE DIRECTOR What are the Benefits of CD-ROM's Capacity ? In Final Fantasy VII, which is the first version in CD-ROM, the most significant different to us was capacity. Before, we were given restrictions in capacity, so we had to create one basic model and fiddle around with it, making players believe there were variations. It was good in a way that we became wise under limited circumstances. But on the CD-ROM that restriction was completely taken away, and we didn't have to worry about various ways of modifying one basic model. If we need 100 models, we can create each of them from scratch. The basic concept you have when creating RPGs is to imitate the real world and create a fictional world within the game. We have followed that concept in previous versions of this series, but technically, we had to use one basic model in different ways, or use a world symbolised specifically for game-use. Now it is much easier for us to achieve our original goal. We can now express various aspects of the real world within the game. THE MAKING OF As Cloud heads toward this ghostly city, the background shifts to give the illusion of depth. \"Little Bronco' was once an aircraft. Since it was gunned down, the team use it as a boat. 'Highwind' is a cool airship which allows the team to travel higher and further than ever! What's New in Final Fantasy VII? In previous games, there were big differences between ordinary scenes and special effects scenes, and they were arranged in a certain order. The players would accept that as an established style and take that for granted. They got used to the pattern; characters going through monotonous map scenes, and then special effects being use in highlight scenes. They understood it as the grammar of games, especially RPGs. We tried to break that understanding. For example, even in map scenes, the characters won't just move horizontally and sometimes thrilling effects are added. In highlight scenes, we didn't make it too elaborate so that it will excessively stand out from the other scenes. We changed effects in those scenes, but the style in showing the images remain the same. As a result, effects are spread out evenly through the whole game. The players will enjoy the flow of the game from the beginning through the ending, without noticing any intervals, or arranged orders. I consider this as the new feature in this game. It's hard to explain in one word, but players will get something like the new feel when they play this game. A feel that demolishes previous values and grammars of RPGs. ADOIS ENO) What do you mean by expressing this new 'feel'? Not just us, but everyone has always wanted to express depth. We used a layer of 2D BG [back ground] images, changed the motion speed of each layer to create simulated depth effects this technology is popular in animation. We've always tried hard to create depth in gameplay and special effects. Now hardware technology has improved, and thus allows us to realise what we wanted to do for a long time. 55 "


"computer video games To escape from the Shin-Ra building, AVALANCHE break into a motor garage and steal some cool looking vehicles. Check Cloud on this Hardy Daytona bike! PlayStation What were the key issues in directing Final Fantasy VII? As I mentioned earlier, in order to prevent players from noticing intervals in the game, we have spread the effects evenly throughout the game. This means that if you make mistakes in the directing, the game could turn out to be monotonous. To avoid that, we have inserted various highlights, and those highlights are never-seen-before spectacles. In previous games, these scenes would appear in the beginning, ending, and maybe once in the midst of the game; scenes like worlds collapsing, etc. This game has around 40 of them. Those scenes are guaranteed to excite you. Cloud \"Stop talkin' like this is the end! AVALANCHE become separated, and Cloud is in danger of falling to uncertain danger. There is nothing Tifa can do to help. An explosion sends Cloud on his way. FINAL FAN LAS Y VI CLOUD THE MAKING OF What are the key features of Final Fantasy VII? Obtaining abilities and strategically combining them to defeat certain enemies (Bosses) has always been the key feature of the Final Fantasy series, and this remains the same in Final Fantasy VII. The basic story line is that Cloud is the main character and separate episodes are prepared for the other characters as well, which somehow relate to and support Cloud's story. However, the focus is more on Cloud's story when compared to the other games in the series. Ex Shin-Ra soldier.

"KAZUSHIGE NOJIMA PLANNER *Who do they think they are?\" computer video games *Hey, Cloud. ...What should we do?\" Let's bust on in! Let's sneak in quietly you don't think that's AVALANCHE?\" What are the key factors in the scenario? Thanks to the CD-ROM, cinematic expressions which were impossible in the past have become available. Going through many discoveries like \"Hey, look what we can do\", and \"Hey, we can even do this\", we found out that this thing was turning into something like a film. However, films can be watched in film theatres where as the game will be played in the home. In order to make the game attractive to game players, we tried hard to put the playable elements in the scenario. For example, a film will proceed in a pace that its producer has set up, during the entire 90 min/two-hour time frame. In this game, we make it so players will not have to follow our pace (this is a difficult thing to do from our side) but move at their own. Just like when you'll flip back pages while reading a book, or rewind a video tape. While we put our efforts in making this into a film-like game, we did out best to include as much interactivity as we could. og *Intruders! Seize them!!\" PlayStation When AVALANCHE arrive at the Shin-Ra building, Barret gives KEN NARITA PROGRAMMER Cloud the choice of caution or bravado! 'Ah, sod it', we thought!!! How did you find it dealing with CD-ROM ? There were both merits and demerits switching format to D-ROM from ROM. Things that became capable were playing movies and adding richness to map images, all of which contributed to adding larger scale to the world within the game. The demerit was slower access speed compared to ROM, which affects the time of bringing up data. The key issue for us now was to overcome this disadvantage; how to make the players unaware of the speed (we had to actually cheat here), how to prevent the players from being disappointed. We are confident that we've achieved our goal. Car #3: Locked Down Upgrading to Warning Level 4 Jesse said we all have to push the button at once.\" THE MAKING OF 13 How did you try to make the Final Fantasy characters as realistic as possible ? In order to make a story with multiple characters into something more realistic, we added depth to certain places which we had to compromise How did improvements in visual expression affect before. Though I don't want to comthe scenario ? pare this one with the previous Before, due to limitations in camera angles, the game games too much. For example, if one screen appeared to be something like broadcasting a character in a group says \"Let's stage scene. Now, with various camera angles, close-ups go!\", one or two of the others would on characters' facial expressions are available. Also, charsay \"No, wait a moment...\". There acters' expressions have become rich by using detailed will be discussions like, \"Com'on, gestures added to speech lines like \"uh-uh\" or \"....\". One we're going!\", \"No, we can't surprising result is that although it's a long story, the because...\". This might slow down number of text characters has actually decreased. the progress of the story a little bit, but we believe it gives the players opportunities to think together with the characters. We hope that people will play this game and say the characters stand out, in a way they would describe TV shows or films. With all sorts of limitations eliminated, we were able to put our efforts into expressing the reality of human beings to our heart's content. PINACEBITAST Cloud is tiny, almost lost in this giant Makoh Furnace. But you can still move him around. Tell us about the screen angles in Final Fantasy VII. In previous Final Fantasy games, the characters' size in the screen was fixed. The players were always watching the characters from a fixed distance. Therefore, players could only see certain areas within the screen. With the new 3D technology introduced, we thought we should put emphasis on enlarging the scale of the world within the game. The characters need to be shown to look tiny in order to do that. At the same time, we tried our best to make it so the players wouldn't have difficulty in controlling the character. Actually, as it turns out, when you see the tiny character walking around in the screen, it looks cute. And as you see the character walking around, but notice that it's not making that much of a progress, you feel that the character is in an awfully large scale world, COVER STORY Cloud begins to climb down a ladder, but where does it take him? Ah! This place is big. A guy could get seriously lost in here!!!  "


"computer video games KAZUYUKI HASHIMOTO CG SUPERVISOR What is the role of a \"CG Supervisor\" ? I oversee the technical aspects of the computer graphics design team. There are various types of software available for creating CGs. I basically supervised the methods on how to convert data from those softwares into a game format. That includes the procedure of extracting, modifying, and formatting of the motion picture data of 3D polygon-based characters. IM PlayStation Cloud, Barret, and Tifa gaze up at the colossal Shin-Ra building. Tell us about the CG technology in Final Fantasy VII There are two types of CG technology used in this game. One is the \"movie\" technology, where you create motion pictures using CG Software and store it on CD-ROM. The other is polygon-based technology, where you create 3D objects and make them move. The first one is real-time, and the second is pre-rendered computed in advance. Speaking of the prerendered type, basically we use the equivalent level of technology used in the film industry. The software we use is mostly equivalent as well. The most popularly used in-house is Alias. It is amazing to see new images being generated one after another, and all being played smoothly on the game console. You realise how powerful current technology is. Just to keep all the Final Fantasy die-hards pleased Chocobo and Mog...!!! SY VIL Cloud Aerith Cait Sith 1114.25081 181241812 336 224.2279 268 Tifa's Beat Rush attack looks awesome from this close-up of the action! (KEN NARITA CONTD.) THE MAKING OF Another thing that becomes available by the technology was various camera angles. Before, the camera was always shooting 45° downwards at the character. Now you can look at characters from the side, from above, and even from the bottom. The availability of these film-like camera angles in games is the largest benefit we get from switching platforms to a 3D capable machine. I always felt like we were forced to look from a fixed angle. With the camera rotating around the character's body, you will be able to get a good view of the surroundings at the same time. This game is actually like a special play, where you can follow the lead character around, and furthermore, give orders to him. Regarding the quality of images created with these tools, there are levels where you can reach by using the tools in a general fashion, but there are advanced levels where you can't 260reach unless you get extremely involved in the tools. I was surprised to see our graphics designers actually reach pretty high levels in approximately three months. They have become capable of designing images of a quality that can compete with professional CG designers. We have put effort in setting polygons for L ooking over the 'shoulder' of Shin-Ra's security movements that are much finer than robot. Barret and Tifa are made to look like midgets! the previous games. COVER STORY What do you feel are the benefits of the capacity of CD-ROM ? The number of events don't change, but the quality of each event is much richer. Talking about capacity, the opening video of Final Fantasy VII itself could hold approximately five Final Fantasy VI entire games. In the previous games, characters were hand-drawn, whereas in this one, they're polygon-based. They get a little blocky when they're polygon-based, but it gives advantages to the event designers in the sense that they can create multiple gestures. Being able to create various gestures unique for that particular scene, and being able to add more to it gives the characters a variety of expressions. The polygon-based drawing technique was new to our programmers, so we had to study extensively on colourusage, and learn a lot from designers who were experienced in using Silicon-Graphics machines. I believe the result is the best thing available in the present. In fighting games, you'll see only two characters on the screen, whereas in the Final Fantasy series, at least 10 characters must show up for the story to proceed. We tried our best to show as much of the character action on the screen as possible. 58 "


"computer video games What do you think is the future of games ? I think we're still in a transition period. Currently there are limitations in CPU speed, memory, and CD-ROM capacity, but I believe more and more improvement will take place on hardware. When I think about the ideal future of home entertainment, films and games will be displaying equivalent image-quality through TV. Then we'll be able to create images with film-like impacts using CGs. I use the word equivalent, but I know films and games will have their own futures. However, if they come to compete with each other in some fashion, we would like to be superior. We have the advantage because, besides the image data itself, we have CPU-generated effects. PlayStation La Dou Combining realtime and FMV! NOBOU VEMATSU MUSIC COMPOSER What is the Future of the \"Final Fantasy\" Series ? I've been wondering for a long time. Ever since V or maybe VI, this thing is being created with the ultimate goal to be a game plus something else I cannot describe. If you listen to the music in Final Fantasy I, II, III, and IV, you'll notice short sequences of music been looped, but in V and VI, you'll notice the people creating the music are becoming aware of film soundtracks. At the time we all realised that we are going for something else than just a game. How did the CD-ROM format change the style of music in the game ? The number of simultaneous music output options used to be eight for the SNES. Now it's 24. We leave eight of them open for sound effects, so we have 16 to use for actual music. That adds richness to the music. For example, when you hit the piano keys with both of your hands, you get 10 notes at once, and you won't be able to create that kind of a sound on a SNES. Suppose we create that pianotype sound with 10 notes, and you still have six notes left. This means you can fit in sounds of other instruments, and this certainly adds richness to the game music. THE MAKING OF Music suits the mood of the scene. Sometimes it changes to highlight an new emotion. How do you decide which music to use at which points throughout the game 2 The music in this game is, like those in the previous games, generated from an internal sound source. Some people say \"Since you're using CD-ROM, why don't you do a studio recording, at least for the movies?\". I wouldn't prefer making portions of the game gorgeous. would rather concentrate on balancing out the quality of music throughout the game. Any one of the music, images, system or scenario should not stand out too much. They should be kept uniformed and levelled out in quality. We have always been trying to accomplish this. The people professional in each field should always try to level out those elements which stand out, and those which are low. NAM Cloud Aerit CaitSith 1433/2101 \"343. 1136/1690 334 1749.1969 240 BEST GAME ON PLAYSTATION? taois One shot of a location found deep into the adventure. (Just to tease you!) The music here is very cold. As a result you start cacking cobbles! What are the main characteristics of the 1 music in Final Fantasy VII? The music in the field scenes where the character walks around have a unique flavour that no other RPGs had in the past. We intentionally eliminated the up-tempo and encouraging-you-toembark-on-the-journey type of factors that usual RPG music have. Instead, some parts of the music will rise melodiously, some parts will make you feel insecure, therefore creating various expressions within the same field music. I assume players will get a different feel from it, compared to previous RPGs. To tell the truth, hope so, since this is my personal experimentation. Over three million players worldwide can't be wrong: Final Fantasy VII is already a classic. CVG will be detailing loads more cool features of this 50+ hour epic next issue, and set in stone our opinion. 59 "

Another great Sega fighter, but with a catch this is no Megamix beater! What we have here, is an amazing conversion, of what was (against other Sega beat 'em ups) an average arcade game. Lovely high-res graphics replicate the arcade look very well, though there is a little polygon flicker on victory poses. Once finished there's not much to come back to. At least Namco had the decency to add those substantial extras to Soul Blade. Moves aren't as fancy as VF2, or Vipers and the Al isn't quite as good either. What we have here is a technically excellent looking game, but one that lacks real substance and longevity. I liked Last Bronx in the arcades, but as a home game it doesn't hook me. Sega have given us better many times before, and if you've sampled their delights already, you can taste the difference with this straight away. ALEX HOMTALA 400 APE LAST BRONX THE MOVIE REVIEW Last Bronx features all the usual additions found in a home beat 'em up Versus, Story, Survival, Time attack and Watch modes. Also added is a Manga-style intro, which although a little short, is very well done. Plus in Story mode, find out the secret link between Yoko and Red Eye and a whole lot more. Unfortunately, due to the sheer volume of translation that would be needed, there will be no training mode. This is because for the Japanese version of the game, the training mode came on its own CD, featuring manga-style fighters, as well as the regular cast, plus animated diagrams and blackboards explaining how each move is performed! If this were to be included in the English language version, the game wouldn't be available until next year! RATING RATING 500 A technically brilliant conversion, of an a average game.

Every month we get the release schedule from HMV and 3Dfx RE is on it. Then we find out after the mag comes out that it's been delayed another month and so it ends up in the following month's release list. But finally we've been treated to the arrival of this classic game, and by all intents and purposes it's been well worth the delays. Despite claims from Virgin that this was to be a fully uncut version, the intro and a couple of FMV scenes have been cut to tone down the gore. However, there are rumours that a patch will become available over the net which will hold an uncut original version of the title. Only then will PC owners be able to experience the full feeling of Survival Horror. RESIDENT EVING Certain camera angles really show the 3Dfx power.  When you stumble across Forest on the balcony with Chris under your command all that's there is a clip and his decaying body. With Jill however things become a little different. Visit him at the start of the game, and the clip has been replaced by a bazooka! If you don't visit him at all, Barry will bring you some Acid Rounds which can be used as ammo and advise you to go and get it. The bazooka will kill most enemies in one hit, sending limbs all over the room, so try and save it until you're absolutely desperate. Remember that the rounds are extremely rare, so when you find some it's not a cue to go mad blasting the hell out of everything. Being selective is probably the best piece of advice you can have. SMOOTHER THANA BABY'S. RESIDENT EVIL Now that Resident Evil has hit the most powerful games machine available, you'd expect it to look pretty amazing. In some cases yes it does, but in others... Chris, Jill and all of the human characters look totally awesome! The facial detail is superb, but the clothes and joins (knees and elbows) still look like lego. The backgrounds seem to be inconsistent as well, with some sporting huge levels of detail and others looking just like the console versions. But these are all minor gripes because when a game looks as good as this, and has virtually no loading time, it really doesn't matter. SPECCY BITS! This paragraph is either going to really please or really annoy you, depending on what sort of machine you own. All those that don't have a 3Dfx accelerated machine can turn the page now, because this game just won't work. That's the first hurdle, but now we have the water jump. To install all of the data for RE and be able to play it on the quickest setting without worrying about loading and all that, you need about.. roughly... somewhere in the region of 350 meg of free space. You have been warned! The door leads to the crow gallery. 1 Well at least it cured his splitting headache. The ultimate hangover cure. REVIEW Notice how smooth the characters look.

AKILLING MACHINE! Kenneth from One of your first priorities as well as locating the crests is to grab yourself the shotgun! Things will start to progress a lot quicker once you have this in your possession as all the standard zombies can be killed in one hit. Remember to aim at their heads or legs for the one bullet kills. If you're playing as Jill you can simply take it from the wall and Barry will rescue you before the ceiling squashes you. With Chris however, you need to find the broken shotgun which is located in the small room, just past the storeroom where you meet Rebecca for the first time. You then need to swap it with the working one to prevent the ceiling coming in on you! The body will reveal two clips if you search it. The depths of the labs contain different zombies. RESIDENT EVIL At first a zombie appears in this corridor, but once you've killed Plant 42 a hunter will appear. Pick up the chemicals as shown and use them to kill the smaller plant in the greenhouse. MULTIPLE KILLINGS ARE EASY! REVIEWER Especially if you happen to have the shotgun, rocket launcher or bazooka. Basically, these weapons are a lot more powerful that the handguns, so they have a greater range. This means that groups of enemies can sustain hits from one shot, thus saving you bullets and time. Dogs are the most likely to suffer from this, as they hunt in packs anyway and stick together. Drain the water to render the sharks helpless. It is hard not to enjoy playing Resident Evil. Although you cannot ignore the high blood shed, it's the general eerie atmosphere it creates, that makes this such a winner. Without the memory space to load it all in though, you may not be able to appreciate the full-on horror effect. The graphics are exactly what you'd expect from a 3Dfx game. Smooth, immensely detailed and it all loads up in ultra quick time providing you have the space. Despite the fact that there are no new elements to the game, it still stands out from it's other competitors. Moments when you run around a corner and see three or four zombies coming at you, or a pack of dogs ready to spring... those can be genuinely scary. Unloading rounds and rounds from a shotgun is immensely satisfying, and seeing chunks of zombie heads splattering around the screen brings a laugh to all faces. Awesome!   Don't bother trying to take them all on. Run to the end of the corridor and shoot from a distance. REVIEW WHAT DO PEOPLE WITH TWO LEFT FEET WEAR TO THE BEACH? RIP RIPS!

It's obvious that Capcom have spent the considerable amount of time since the PlayStation release making this as good a conversion as they could possibly hope for.

You have to mix the V-Jolt and pour it over the roots of the Plant to kill it once, which only Rebecca can concoct if you're playing as Chris. Even at this stage, the end is still far away. JUST INCASE YOU GET STUCK.. For the benefit of all those who have never played the original, here's a few pointers to get you going, as you hack your way through the mansion. RESIDENT EVIL REVIEWER The crows won't attack you in the gallery unless you shoot at them first. If you do, head for the door! FIND THE CRESTS The quality of this Resident Evil conversion is obvious for all to see and the basic fact is, it's an almost perfect replica of its PlayStation counterpart. The graphics are the thing that most surprised me about RE. With all the talk about the Saturn being inferior in this department, the quality cannot be surpassed. All of the rooms, the enemies and the animation are almost identical. Some of you may be thinking that it has taken far too long to transport the game to Sega's machine, and I'd have to agree with you. But if you think about how many other Saturn games there are like this, you can forget all that. Capcom have done a sterling job with this, and the ranking mode is a good little bonus for those who've completed the game. Saturn owners, your time for skiddy pants has arrived. Awesome! STEVE PES The first set of tasks you should set out to achieve is locating the four crests. These let you gain access to the Courtyard and the inner depths of the game. They are scattered all over the mansion, and will take some time to get. The first, and easiest is gained by putting the blue gem into the eye of the tiger statue. Head for the Crow's Gallery after that and look at the paintings in order of age, starting with the newborn child up to the bold-looking old man. The third is located on the first floor of the mansion, and is inside a room with two grates and a switch. Push the two statues over the grates and hit the two statues over the drates and hit the switch to open a chest with the crest inside. The final one is the most difficult, as you have to fight Yawn the snake for the first time in order to gain access to it! REVIEW TIf you try and leave the mansion by the front door, you get this little cut scene. BATING RATING 06 The Saturn version matches its Sony brother for graphics, playability and the general pooyour-pants appeal you get while playing. Cool!  "

An island filled with dinosaurs, running free and eating humans! It's a 100% marketable image! And so, with Jurassic glove puppets and burgers, and soundtracks with fold-out 3D dino-ramas roaming the merchandising paddock, it's time to unleash the biggest spin-off of them all The Lost World videogame! Your chance to explore that island filled with hungry dinosaurs and screaming humans and to play as both! (MEET... MR DNA! THE LOST WORLD THE GAME TRAIL A game set on the Site B dinosaur breeding ground of The Lost World has limitless potential. Sega's coin-op put you in the more predictable situation of a 'ride' around the island, as every form of dinosaur is thrown at you. Dreamworks, the team behind the home game (and Spielberg's own game dev company), have gone for an approach more akin to Wildlife on One. You play the humans AND dinosaurs going about their everyday survival routines. Of course, for a T-Rex each day consists of eating everything in its path! And for a human on the island, not being lunch is biggest daily concern! Considering Dreamworks have prided themselves on the realism of the game both in looks and the motives for each animal it's curious that some of the natural landscape features numerous 'neat' ledges. Yep, The Lost World is a platform game! Much like Pandemonium, the action scrolls from left to right, with the 3D back ground being mainly uninteractive. The path sometimes forks off though, allowing you to head along different routes. In classic corny platform fashion, there are things to collect too. Hidden DNA strands. and crates with weapons for the humans. The dinosaurs even power-up their 'raptor eye' (top right of the screen) when they kill. making their attacks stronger. The aim of every level though, is just to get to the end! There are 20 species of creature in The Lost World game. Here's a Triceratops and an Ankylosaurus. LIFE FINDS A WAY! REVIEW 1 As the compy, you have to run through the legs of a moving brachiosaurus herd. This bit looks incredible! JAn amazing amount of attention has been spent on the look and animation of the dinosaurs. The full 3D models are excellently textured using a single-mesh system that stretches as the dinos move. Also, the motion for some of the dinosaurs has been taken from the movie models most notably the raptor and T-Rex movement. The results are so impressive, they rival the movie in some cases! 66 "


"SPOTTER'S GUIDE TO DINOSAURS! computer Video games You get to play as five different creatures over 40 levels, starting as the compy and eventually working your way to human scientist. 1. PROCOMPSOGNATHUS 2. HUMAN HUNTER SEGA SATURN As the smallest creature in the food chain, your journey through the first few levels is mainly on the run! However, you'd be surprised how easily a compy can bring down a raptor when it tries! As the human, you're given vaguely Bionic Commando-style abilities thanks to a grapple gun. Just keep loading up the weaponry and hitting them lizards!  These Pachycephalosaurs are tough to kill, but one gas cannister can bring them down. PlayStation  This level is a mad chase, as you duck around this giant, avoiding its jaws! 4. HUMAN SCIENTIST Playing the final character, the game more closely follows the movie. As the paleontologist Sarah, you've got to get off the island! Jie final ompy levels put you underwater, with giant alligators! 10 3. VELOCIRAPTOR 1 On this Camp level, you have to stay one step ahead of the T-Rex, distracting him with flares and jumping laser fences! Suddenly the roles are reversed! Now you get to go into the caves and InGen complex, hunting down the humans. And other dinosaurs too! The communication base, pits you against raptors and the T-Rex! THE LOST WORLD The Raptor can be made to coil, then spring at enemies, just like in the films!  The final level is aboard the ship, heading to San Diego. Could the city be a hidden level in the game? Enemy packs of velociraptors gang up on you on later levels. 5. TYRANNOSAURUS REX REVIEWER Now that's more like top of the food chain! The T-Rex levels are the best, as you can do all those favourite T-Rex things, stomping about devouring everything! While I found the film disappointing, a game of The Lost World had the potential to be mind-blowing. This isn't. Clearly Dreamworks wanted to make interactive dinosaurs that rivalled those on the big.screen. The compy, raptors and T-Rex look and move fantastically. Unfortunately though, the game seems to have taken second place to the looks. Considering the creatures and environments are 3D, it's a waste that the game is a Pandemonium-clone. Each level only has one idea, which is repeated until the end. So bashing humans out of hanging baskets and eating them gets tedious after eight-in-a-row. Another fault I have to mention is the fixed animation routines, which sends you off ledges when you want to walk one step. No doubt this will sell loads (it looks great in the cinema ads) and controlling the dinos is okay fun, but this is quite bland fare. TOM GUISE Bashing them out of these turrets, you can grab screaming humans in your mouth, then eat them or throw them over your shoulder. REVIEW BATING RATING 0 Any time you want, you can let off the now legendary roar. It sounds just like in the movies! Giant raptors give you some hassle here, even though you're the king! Some of the visuals live up to The Lost World expectations, but considering the gaming potential of this license, this is a missed opportunity. 67 "

Could it be a surprise contender to the crown? ith more and more fighting games arriving on the scene these days, coming up with an original idea becomes harder and harder. Tweaking other themes and engines seems to be the most common slant programmers take and in Dynasty Warriors, the same can be said. While it's not a bad game far from it you get a feeling of 'been there done that' while playing. Dynasty has enjoyed relative success in Japan and the States over the last couple of months, but given that certainly the Japanese market is perfect for one-on-one fighting games, not too much should be read into this. With Marvel and EX Plus on the way, you'd be better advised to wait for one of those. DYNASTY WARRIORS NOW YOU'VE MADE ME MAD!!!!

At this point you should execute a fireball motion and hit, Square and X together.

You have two attack buttons and two defensive ones in the game, and by hitting the latter two you'll slide into the screen. Keep tapping them to avoid the longer range attacks. If you hit the two attack buttons while standing, your character will also perform a throw.

Still, it was pretty funny to watch people whacking the buttons like madmen and still emerging as a loser! SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM! ZHAO TUN The biggest plus point for Dynasty Warriors is that it has so many different variations of the standard 1-player battle. Obviously it features a two player mode and practice options, but there are many more than that. The Endurance speaks for itself really, with your aim to win as many consecutive bouts as possible. Team Battle lets you have a huge tag team with a new fighter coming in once another is defeated. The Tournament is for up to eight human players, with each picking a character, who is then paired off against another human. The winner goes through to face another winner and so on. The Time Trial is the last option, and is a test of speed rather than stamina. Disposing of enemies as quick as possible is the name of the game here. For sheer variation, you'll have trouble matching all those. DYNASTY    2H  WARRIORS 2S POFTEILE REVIEWER PRES8 P2 STAB Sunt ut watu 135 BLAN YULE FIND THEM ALL! You begin with an initial ten characters to choose from, but there are at least another five to find through a combination of completing the game and cheats. From what we could tell, most of these hidden fighter were just variants of the standard people, almost like the 'Evil' versions from EX Plus. There are a couple of bosses who can be bought up as well, but only after all the other warriors have been accessed. Dynasty Warriors is a strange game. As soon as I started playing, I thought that is was just another fighting game, and that I had drawn the short straw by getting it. Once I actually learnt a few moves and began to realise what I was doing, it actually became quite enjoy able though. But at the end of the day the lack of moves and combos lets this down. Graphically, it's more than good with impressive lighting effects and animation, and there are loads of playing styles to keep you interested. But with only five or six significant attacks, boredom soon sets in. This is one of those games that if it had been released a year or so ago, it would be fantastic. But given the sheer quality of titles that have already gone before this one, you can't help feeling that your hard-earned should be heading elsewhere. STEVE HEY Swords are good close range Weapons.

The VS mode also lets you spice things up a bit by adjusting the course before the race, blocking off routes to make it an entirely on-road or off-road tussle. Most of the eight vehicles you get to choose at the start of the race are four-wheel-drive cars and trucks which are more suited to off-road driving, but there are a couple of street cars if you're planning (misguidedly) to stay on the tarmac.

The handling feels good, possibly not as precise as Rage Racer's, but more realistic think, especially when the car slides, or drives over gravel. The action is fast and smooth, the courses are varied and the graphics are nice too. In fact I thought about giving MRC four out of five until a couple of silly flaws came to light. Firstly, you can win all the races with one car very easily. The Toyohata kingroader isn't the fastest vehicle, but it corners on rails while the other cars lose speed by sliding and skidding. spent ages customising the faster cars to improve their performances, then when I tried this one car and with no adjustments (apart from one minor tweak on the last race I acquired both Match Race cars and bonus tracks with ease. Oh, and giving you the option to drive different routes? Pointless, seeing as you MUST take all the off-road shortcuts to stand a chance of winning. Thus are most of the game's innova tions invalidated.

He's cute for a start. Secondly, he's starring in an incredible game! n the distant planet Oddworld, a humble slave worker called Abe stumbles across a plan to turn his race the Mudokons into snack food! You join the story by helping Abe to escape from the prison factory in which he works, and on to discover his destiny! You must learn new skills and find out more about the land of Oddworld as you go.

Your first task for part one get poor old Abe outta here! DDVSE YSEE THIS IS RUPTURE FARIAS... The introduction sets the scene perfectly, starting the game off with a truly movie-like sequence telling the background story. Abe is a Mudokon and a slave in Rupture Farms, the biggest meat packing plant on Oddworld. Profits are low, and the company is running short of species to turn into food until the boss comes up with a new suggestion Mudokon Pops! Naturally, Abe is horrified and starts his escape, taking as many Mudokon friends with him as possible! Not only is the intro of amazing quality, but it also blends into the game perfectly! At the end, the view spins around and Abe runs onto the screen closely followed by a Slig security guard! do COMING Hiding in the shadows makes you invisible to other characters. Making small noises (like a fart) attracts their attention. YOU ARE HELLO \"FOLLOW ME \"OKAY \"WAIT\" \"HUHHUR-HELLO \"OKAY *PRRRP The other Mudokons aren't bright enough to lead themselves to safety, so it's up to Abe to tell them the way to go. Here's a typical example from the first area, Rupture Farms. This Mudokon jumps up when you enter his territory, slingshot aimed at your head! To get past him you must copy the whistle he sings to you by using the talk buttons. SPEAKIO AE REVIEW FOR FASSAGE Oddworld Inhabitants have blessed Abe with a feature they call Game Speak. At any time during the game, Abe can communicate using any of his eight phrases. The other characters in Oddworld each react differently to him depending on the situation, some friendly and some not. When Abe uses his powers to possess and take control of another character, he can use all of their phrases as well. For example, when playing as a Slig Abe can shout \"Look out!\" which makes all the Mudokons in the area duck with their hands on their heads! This gives Abe a clear shot at any enemies without killing his friends! Abe 72 "


"IT'S ALL IN THE MIND games It's clear from the start of the adventure that Abe isn't a standard Mudokon as he has some special mental powers that none of the others can do. By going into a special chant, he can take control of other characters' bodies and read hidden messages, among other things. PlayStation The circle of birds indicates a portal. Some only stay open while Abe is chanting, giving other Mudokons time to jump through. Others stay open for longer, letting Abe leap from area to area instantly. SNEAK The best mind power is possession! It lets Abe take control of other characters and their powers. When playing as a Slig, you can use all of their speech as well as their machine guns! Some creatures resist possession by screaming when Abe chants, like the Paramites and Scrabs. Once you've finished with a host body, simply explode it from the inside! Swarms of glowing bugs form into Before long you'll come across hidden a Mudokon who will give you a messages when new power in exchange for a chanted to. special whistle code.

If you mistime a selection of moves to Conrad Hart. It takes some time to learn the exact running jump by a split-second, it's not going to work. ODDWORIN OCCUPANTS The planet on which Abe's Oddysee takes place Oddworld has a brilliant character of its own. The buildings, landscapes and creatures are all designed in remarkable detail, making a world which the player will really want to find out more about something that the developers are going to do with another four games set on Oddworld! Here are a few of the more common creatures you can expect to find on your journey. WEB Scrabs are almost as tall as Abe When standing straight up, and can run faster than he can. They will attack whenever they get the chance. Their loud screech stops Abe from being able to possess them, as with the Paramites. They'll fight each other to the death if forced together! Paramites are small four-legged spider-like creatures who can weave webs. On their own they are no problem, but threaten one by getting it into a corner and it may turn nasty. If they get in packs, they will often attack. Try to carry pieces of meat which can be thrown to distract Paramites. BEES These aren't too common thankfully. If you disturb the swarm they'll follow you about, stinging as they go. It's very difficult to shake them off. REVIEW SIDES Sligs are small yellow animals which go around on cyborg legs working as guards for Rupture Farms. Their legs make a noise which means that they can be heard coming your way. Their electronic eyesight isn't brilliant, so it's easy to fool them by hiding in the shadows. Sligs are relatively stupid, and are easy to possess so long as you stand out of the way of their machine guns. Often found on patrol with Sligs, these pink dog-like animals will attack Abe as soon as they see him. They sleep a lot, so lots of creeping around makes getting past them easier. The bats manage to get in the way just as you really don't want them to. Pick up some stones and throw them in their general direction. "


"computer video games VIDEO TRICKERY TM PlayStation During the game, rendered cut-scenes often kick in to add to the story. What's really amazing is how smoothly they fit into the action, and the graphic style of the sequences is exactly the same as the game itself. Sometimes they're used to tell an important part of the story, while sometimes they are just for effect. For example, going through certain exits will make the view spin around through the rendered 3D background, stopping at the new location. Abe will simply walk onto the screen and carry on! When you climb into one of these giant pods in the background, a sequence seamlessly shows it speeding along a tunnel and stopping at the end! Things like this add to the feeling of being inside an enormous factory. Some doors make the screen ripple then reappear as a new location. This is one of the best effects. MULTIOY! I WANT AWEI! One of the friendly creatures of Oddworld are the Elum. They let Abe climb onto their back and ride them. They can run faster and jump further than Abe can on his own, and will follow when told to do so. The only problem is that they're partial to a bit of food. At the first opportunity they'll run off to eat anything they can! REVIEWER \"HELLO!\" WAAAH! YAAAAH! Tell the Elum to wait and he'll let off a big howl! When he runs, Abe almost falls off his back! The Elum can run quickly enough to get past Sligs! Pictures can't convey the brilliance of Abe's Oddysee. A quick play of the game will convince you that it could be excellent, and a few hours in you'll realise just how amazing it is. If you've ever played Flashback you'll have a good idea how Abe plays, with similar creeping, running and jumping moves. Each screen of Abe's Oddysee is a challenge, with a puzzle that first requires some working out then some time to master the best way of doing it. Every screen in the game is brilliantly worked out, and there's a different challenge on each one. The style, of Oddworld is fantastic, and the rendered graphics and character animations are some of the best seen. As you play through the game the plot gets more and more interesting, and Abe learns new powers on the way, keeping everything fresh. And simply working through the game isn't everything finding and rescuing all 100 Mudokons as you go is the REAL way to do it! Abe is the best platform adventure game for a very long time. There are certainly quite a few people who will still see it as a bit dull. but they can stuff off and buy yet another driving game. Abe's Oddysee is an epic, challenging cinematic experience! ED LOMAS RUPTURE FARMS REVIEW Standing in the shadows means that other characters can't see you! Here Abe's behind the top-right rock! RATING RATING A beautifully-crafted adventure. Unfortunately, not everyone will see the charm of it, but still very, very highly recommended!  "

"FUEL FUEL computer games 1500 1160 EKTS 1180 1500 LOAD LOAD ATMP WORK WITH ME LOVEY GUNS FUEL RKTS ARMR 1022 OREN 257 LOAD Soviet Strike was regarded by many as having the best FMV sequences seen in a game. Well Nuclear Strike will now undoubtedly carry that accolade. EA have really gone for the Oscar on this one. It's the same pseudoMTV presentation as in Soviet, but with a better mix of real library footage and specially filmed scenes. The end result makes the game incredibly realistic, and conveys a gripping storyline. WING ATMP Big Ten Eagle Thrust. Cue up Ride of the Valkyries! COMMENT In hindsight, Soviet Strike didn't deserve the High Five that it received almost a year ago. It was a superb game and still is, but didn't really have the credentials for the award. Nuclear Strike is better than Soviet, but is still just short of the ultimate CVG accolade. The twelve extra vehicles add much needed dimension to the game. And only the heli's can reload, so you have to plan when to use the extra craft wisely, adding even more strategy. The top movie clips return to add that little extra bit of realism. It seems to have been made slightly easier as well, which some may view as a bad thing, but overall this is another classy Strike game. Quit while you're ahead, EA! STEVE PES 1950 1.0. LOAD SIRINI NUCLEAR WHO CAN YOU TRUST? ARMR 1250 ISSL LCAD REVIEWER WING In previous Strike games you always had to rely on the assistance of a wingman. Nick Arnold was the copter buddy in Soviet, but due to unforeseen circumstances his services are no longer available. On each level different agents and allies will aide you. Some are only too willing, others need to be paid for their services. Andrea will be invaluable throughout the mission, a STRIKE operative, who's cover is as news reporter for GBS. Also at hand are Hack and Earle again giving out advice and orders. Plus on the ground are more agents waiting to help. After the events which transpired at the end of Soviet Strike, be wary of one of them selling you out. FUEL 1140 ARMR LOAD I haven't enjoyed a Strike game this much since the original Desert shebang. No doubt Nuclear will be labelled equally as controversial due to its subject matter. Never before have I been gripped by a games storyline as much as this. While the gameplay may follow the same winning formula, the strong story seems to give it an extra edge, and feeling of urgency. The new vehicles, though not all essential, should offer some replay value. It's not as tough as previous out ings, which is a shame, but the scrolling is now silky smooth, and everything seems better than ever before. i can't see much more life left in the series (in its present form), and this could prove to be a thrilling finalé. What really makes the game is level three, I won't spoil the surprise, except that it is an amazing moment in game history! WING ATMP  REVIEW ALEX 40MTALA Cash blasts his way into this missile silo.

You have the choice of controlling ten planes, each with differing qualities (like handling, speed and acceleration the usual stuff) and have to race against computer-controlled enemies.

Any of the quartet (bar perhaps the Invisible Girl) would have made an excellent addition to MSH. Probe's representation of Stan Lee's cosmically created team though is utterly appalling. Where dynamic cartoon sprites and backdrops would have been spot-on, Probe have given us embarrassingly-animated rendered characters, further crippled by their handful of rubbish special moves (ie. Mr Fantastic's moronic mallet-hand trick!). Dull stages, hideous representations of the bosses, dreadful speech I think you get the picture. As a Marvel fan, I find the game abominable.

For the simple reason that they deliver exactly what you want appealing characters caught in an absorbing plot filled with clever puzzles. The Feeble Files demonstrates why few others get the same treatement. From the opening FMV sequence the comedy antihero, Feeble, is highly dislikeable. The story follows his oblivious alien antics, as he gets involved in an underground rebellion against the mighty OmniBrain and 'The Company'. Voiced by Robert Llewelly, who played Red Dwarf's Kryten, the game attempts the same sci-fi parody as said TV series. However, the grindingly dull dialogue and abysmal humour fail to appeal at all.

SUPER HERAES TM Blackheart is the most overthe-top character in the game! FREE PLAY MARVEL SUPER HEROES VS STREET FIGHTER erhaps you could criticise for Marvel for milking their fighting games. What with numerous Street Fighter games, X-Men, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men Vs Street Fighter, and now we have Marvel Super Heroes Vs Street Fighter! But answer this Capcom fans, tell us you don't want the chance to play your favourite Marvel Super Heroes against the Street Fighters. That the X-Men were enough and you're not interested in the likes of Blackheart and Hulk facing Ryu and Ken. Eh? EH? If that's the case, you won't want to look at the awesome pictures of the game on these here pages. Go on, nob off! SUPER JUMPS Two teams, each with a Hulk means lots of flying floor! RHERO NEW HERO Super jumps are the same as they ever were in all the Marvel games! Allowing your character to jump far higher than the usual joystick-activated jump. Press all three kick buttons simultaneously or hold the joystick down, then up for a super jump!. 02 * BIOCKING SYSTEM * EASY Ken's standard fireball is now bigger than his usual super! 575907 It's very annoying when your opponent knows you're going to block, but uses special moves to chisel away at your energy for a cheesy win. To remedy this, Capcom have created the advancing guard and the variable counter. The Advancing Guard allows you to break up an opponent's combo by pushing him away. It doesn't use any of the Super Gauge, but it's impossible to counter strike with it. The Variable Counter on the other hand takes up one Super Gauge, but hurts the assailant at the same time, and switches the character on screen with his team-mate. To perform the advancing guard, press all 3 punch buttons during block. The Variable Counter is activated with a back, back/down, down +strong P+strong K-during block. 75202 TIDE PE At the end of the game you still meet the enormous Apocalypse! ARCADE 677209 FREE PLAY AERIAL RAVE Unique to the Marvel games are the air combos. After an uppercut or another floater move, push up and proceed with a chain combo.

"2.4201 THE VARIABLE SYSTET! computer video games We've had the Vector Theory (X-Men: COTA) and now we have the Variable System! The Variable System is when your two chosen fighters help each other during the round, to either swap places so the battered member can rest or to join forces in a damaging attack. Here's a description of the entire system. VARIABIE ATTACK FREE PLAY Ryu and Captain America aren't impressed with Dan's autograph. Oh dear! Hulk now sends a giant ripple along the floor instead of throwing boulders! 62200 M LE PLAY When one of your fighters is on the wrong end of a 15 hit combo, press strong P+K together for him to change places with his partner. As in X-Men Vs SF, the resting character will regain the red segment of his energy bar, so it's worth keeping an eye on your energy bar. VRABIE COMBINATION As in the previous Marvel game, both fighters join forces and use their super combos together on some poor victim's ass for some big damage. Used in conjunction with a chain combo it's great, but bear in mind that you lose two Super Gauges. Perform a quarter circle towards motion, with strong P+K, for a Variable Combination. VARIABIEASSIST Making its debut is the Variable Assist. By pushing medium P+K together, your partner leaps on-screen to attack, and then leaps off! Bearing in mind that the Variable Assist doesn't require any Super Gauge, and that other variable moves can be used simultaneously, this leaves a lot of potential for huge combos. MARVEL SUPER HEROES VS STREET FIGHTER HIT VARIABIE COUNTER See BLOCKING SYSTEM THE CAST * OPINION * While most of the Marvel characters remain the same since X-Men vs SF and X-Men:COTA, the Street Fighter cast have been given new moves to improve their chances in battle. For example, Ryu and Ken have been given their SF3 Super Arts, Shin Shoryuken and Shippu Jinraikyaku respectively, while Bison has his Bison Warp changed from the previous 'appear-at-the-other-side-of-the-screen' incarnation to producing five-replica images, similar to Galford and Hanzo of Samurai Shodown fame. It's not just the SF lot who've had a respray though. Armed with a new Super Combo is Omega Red whose Omega Smash can be used in mid air, or at the end of an Aerial Rave, making him far more versatile than in X-Men:COTA. But the Best Improved Fighter award goes to Dan for his new special move Premier Sign. Pulling out a picture of himself, Dan then proceeds to sign it and holds the picture towards the screen for everybody to see. But it doesn't end there. He hurls the offending item at his opponent causing some serious damage! Strange but refreshing. On initial play test, Marvel Super Heroes Vs Street Fighter played very similar to its prequel, with bold graphics, outrageous moves, and the emphasis on the use of special moves and Super Combos still very much in effect. The team effort' aspect of the game seems slightly more pronounced AKUMA SPIDER-VAV than with its prequel, due to the introduction of the Variable Assist. The game does UOL ES CHZE 2 have a lot to offer, but I feel that many people will miss out, as the temptation to use just special moves and Super Combos is just too great. However, it is a fun game and even Ryu and Ken are interesting to use, as they have their SF3 Super Arts to play with. The game made its debut in Japanese arcades a few weeks ago and the initial response seemed good, although the release of KOF '97 overshadowed it somewhat. But for fans of the X-Men Vs Street Fighter game and Marvel alike, this should 1 Sakura's fireballs go down very well and is well worth are bigger than she is! looking up.

As you can imagine (especially if you're a Warcraft fan), Blizzard's next game in the Craft series is currently getting a large number of people excited.

They can also use some special psychic powers on the other races and aren't as intent on combat. All their buildings must be linked by crystal pylons. The graphics are similar to many other real-time strategy games, using an overhead view with small units. To show the area which each unit can see, real-time light-sourcing is used, and it looks excellent. As your unit moves around the screen, a spotlight around them shows their line-ofsight, letting enemies hide just out of view. Very nice.

Almost every piece of scenery in the game can be interacted with! In the pachinko parlour on the first level, you can play on the machines and win extra items and ammo, while later on you can find a hidden shrine to a god known only as 'Chan'. Wonder which films 3D Realms have been watching... There's an excellent selection of weapons in Shadow Warrior, as you'd expect. Lo Wang can punch faster than the human eye can see, but that's still not enough to get through this game. He can also use a ninja sword, shurikens (almost definitely being removed for the British version of the game), uzis (two at a time!), a riot gun, and more!

"computer video games 80% ADVENTURE COVENTURE BY LUCASARTS ES  PC AND AMIGA PREQUELS AVAILABLE  NO OTHER VERSION PLANNED  STORAGE 1CD COMPLETE NOV RELEASE 1 PLAYER ROM  RELEASED BY VIRGIN TEL 0171 368 2255 ROM \"I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate!\" Thousands of people have been waiting years for a chance to say that again! Now Lucasarts are here to grant their wish! THE CURSE OF THE CURSE OF MONARY ucasarts became known as gods of the adventure game when The Secret Of Monkey Island came out. They'd done some excellent adventures before that, including Maniac Mansion, but it was Monkey Island that really set them miles ahead of anyone else. The detailed backgrounds, excellent characters, great sense of humour and ENORMOUS game area gave players months of top-quality entertainment. The second game Monkey Island 2: Le Chuck's Revenge came a few years later and was declared \"Best game ever» by many. It was certainly the best adventure game at the time. Finally, even though some doubted it would ever happen, the third Monkey Island game is here. And it's set to continue the tradition of blowing people away! ONKEY ISLAND TM LUCASARTS' THIRD TRIP TO MONKEY ISLAND! S2 LUCAS PLUCASARTS REMOVES ALL KNOWN SCUMM! 3 Guybrush Threepwood: The hero of the adventure! Governor Elaine Marley: Guybrush's dream woman! Captain Le Chuck: The evil undead pirate! The first two Monkey Island games used Lucasarts' own \"SCUMM\" interface. With SCUMM, you choose an action from the menu at the bottom of the screen (look at, push, talk to, use, open, etc), then an item in the game area. A sentence is created and Guybrush does what he's told. The Curse Of Monkey Island uses a different, simpler interface similar to the one seen in Full Throttle. YOU CANNOT KILL WHAT DOES NOT LIVE! THE PIECE OF EIGHT! Your standard in-game mouse pointer is a small white cross. When it's moved over a \"hot\" item, ie. anything that can be interacted with. Holding the left mouse button brings up the new coin icon which has three parts to it a hand, an eye and a mouth. All you need to do is choose which of the three you want to use with the selected item and Guybrush will do so. Each icon can mean different things the mouth will make Guybrush talk to some things, eat others, and so on. Following on from Monkey Island 2: Le Chuck's Revenge, the mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood is left floating across the sea in a fairground dodgem. He is soon picked up by a ship full of undead skeleton pirates captained by... Le Chuck! He's not dead! Again. And what's more, he's got the love of Guybrush's life, Governor Elaine Marley and is planning to marry her! A massive battle begins as the skeletal crew take on a massive fort which is defending Plunder Island, and Guybrush is locked below deck to await his execution. This is where you come it taking on the role of Guybrush, you need to find a way off the ship, rescue Elaine from Le Chuck and dispose of the vile pirate forever! As you can guess, it sounds a LOT easier than it really is! THE DEAD MAN'S CHEST! NOUS ININO Previously, your inventory was always visible in the bar at the bottom of the screen. In The Curse Of Monkey Island you need to press the right mouse button to call it up, then simply click and drag something into the play area. When it moves over something with which it can interact, it glows yellow. Simple! 88 As with previous Monkey Island games, the way to win fights is to insult your foe into submission! Guybrush is captured by Le Chuck's terrifying crew of living skeletons in the excellent intro! "


"\"I'M SELLING THESE FINE LEATHER JACKETS...\" computer Video games Games have moved on quite a bit since the release of The Secret Of Monkey Island. It's not enough for coloured text to appear above the head of whoever's talking any more the characters really need to speak to you. In The Curse Of Monkey Island, everything is spoken. While Guybrush has an American accent, there are a fair number of characters with good old \"oo-ar-ha-har\" kind of pirate voices. The speech is brilliantly done so that none of the excellent humour is ruined. In fact, the voices make the characters even more entertaining Murray the demonic skull has a perfect evil cackle, for example! When Le Chuck gets angry, he gets really angry! He's not too happy about Guybrush killing him twice! THE BEST-LOOKING MONKEY IN THE WORLD THE CU W 20354 TINO The Curse Of Monkey Island has some of the most unbelievably good graphics we've ever seen, and there's not the tiniest bit of 3D anywhere to be seen. Instead, everything is beautifully hand-drawn, with animation which is as good as anything seen in Disney's top movies. We're not exaggerating here. The amount of detail in the look of the game is remarkable every piece of background has something amazing to look at, while almost every action that Guybrush can perform has its own animation. For example, at the very start of the game it's possible to pick up a rod from the wall of the ship you start in. In previous games, Guybrush would outstretch his arm and the rod would appear in his inventory. In The Curse Of Monkey Island, he reaches out, picks it up, pulls open his pocket and drops the rod in. All of this is done smoothly and with masses of character. It really is amazing to watch. The hand-painted backgrounds are amazing! Just look at the incredible detail on the scenery! BARGAIN ALERT! MONKEY ISLANDS 1 AND 2 GOING CHEAP! If you've got a PC and you've never had the pleasure of playing a Monkey Island game, you don't need to wait until The Curse Of Monkey Island is released. The first two games can be bought on a single CD on Virgin's White Label budget range. This means that you can buy two of the best games ever for only ! If you want a challenge, buy the budget disc now and see if you can complete both games in time for the release of number three! Not only will you be completely entertained for the next few months, but you'll also be able to appreciate many of the running gags and characters that have been carried on throughout the series!

SATURN'S ANSWER TO FINAL FANTASY ROOM TO SWING A ROLL Locations in Grandia exist within areas spanning 100 screens (10x10 square). Game Arts claim this is more than 10 times the size of a usual town area found in RPGs. True or not, Grandia is impressive because all screens are continuous, whereas in Final Fantasy VII or more recently Saga Frontier each scene is loaded separately. The effect used in Grandia is more natural. WA LONG TIME COMING Devoted Sega fans have been expecting Grandia for at least a year, and it has been in progress since before the Saturn was launched! The development team, Game Arts, have a reputation for producing top quality games for Sega. They've proved their worth in the field of RPGs, with the Lunar series on Mega Drive and Saturn.

But consider that the music, and crisp effects were post-produced at Skywalker Sound and you have some idea. Skywalker Sound is the award-winning digital sound mixing facility, where 'sound design for such films as The Lost World, Mars Attacks, Hercules, and Mission: Impossible was produced. Grandia would benefit from using Skywalker Sound because of the connections with Lucasfilm's THX Division. Everyone piles on to clobber this feeble foe. It's fun to watch.

Like all the best battle systems, it rewards tacticians with wicked displays of martial pyrotechnics. Combat is turn based, but continuous, governed by time gauges for all characters heroes and enemies. This is similar to how Final Fantasy VII works, except Grandia gives players an additional exciting option based around the time gauge: simultaneous attacks! If you choose to wait until everybody is ready to attack, they may all strike together. In the Grandia demo these joint assaults are not strictly combos' unlike Square's SaGa Frontier where Weird Cheer Leader combination moves are over-the-top sequences of strikes, magic heals the party. in Grandia everyone does their standard move all at once.

BEST IS TO COME EVENTUALLY REAL TIME FLY BY Airfields, mine-cart circuits, and a haunted house comprise the set of real time, non interactive demos of Grandia's grandeur.

Looking across to the Dragon galleon from a commercial ship. Smart mist effect, eh! 1 Wind blows through the rough grass. But the effect is too small to see here. Judging from what we've seen and read in the Japanese specialist press, this demo sells Grandia somewhat short.

Previously Game Arts have mentioned that there are vehicles to control hang-gliders, jet aircraft and tanks.

WINS: 00 WINS: 00 he worms are back. After many years since their original Amiga appearance, and infiltrating every games machine known to man since that time. They have finally decided it's time for a sequel. The gameplay stays the same as it ever was. With teams of four worms, facing off against each other in a strategic battle. There are 60 new weapons including homing cluster bombs and air strikes, napalm attacks, and flying sheep, plus loads more which are still top secret. The major change is with the graphics. The effect is now more colourful and cartoon-like. With the worms themselves enjoying lots of frames of extra animation. The effect of this is tiny, you have to really study each worm to appreciate the amount of work has gone into the game. Wind speed is also different this time, with no windometer visible on screen, instead players must study the flow of leaves in the background, to tell the difference between a gentle breeze and a major gale. Also new is the graffiti mode which allows you to edit levels, a speech editor, to create your own voices, and a weapons editor to change attributes and values of weapons. If that wasn't enough, if you're sick to death of the worms there are lots of other animals as well. For more info visit the official Worms 2 web site on www.worms2.com. FIRST LOOK AT HOT NET SOFTWARE! Countach Using new arcade hardware known as the Zeus, the graphics are all fully 3D with motion-captured character animations. The most recent version currently on test in Chicago has 12 playable characters old favourites Liu Kang, Noob HMIDWAY Saibot, Raiden, Reptile, Scorpion, Sonya, Sub-Zero plus new characters Fujin, Kai, Quan Chi, Shinnok and Tanya. The next version to be released will have another playable fighter from Kano's organisation while Noob Saibot will be made one of the three secret fighters. The biggest new feature of Mortal Kombat 4 (the one that Ed Boon wouldn't tell anyone about until the game went on test) is that the fighters can use weapons. Each character has a special weapon which lets them perform different attacks, but take too much of a beating and they drop the weapon. The other fighter can then pick it up and use all of the original fighter's weapon attacks! This feature could improve the MK series, or it could ruin the close-combat feel of the first three. Here's hoping it's the former! While we haven't had the chance to play the game yet, it certainly looks great. The close-up views of the character that you get during victory poses and certain moves make them look very solid FUJIN TUKANG indeed, and the motion capture makes them move smoothly.

It uses the same game engine as Extreme and is best described as a turn based action strategy game. It appears to incorporate all the best best bits from RPG fighting sequences and yet still have enough new features to keep the idea fresh. You are a group of troops who have to kill all of the alien inhabitants of the planet chromos who have become infected with a human disease. The disease means that all they want to do is kill humans! Once you get into a battle, you realise the potential for this. As we mentioned earlier, it is a turn based game which means you can plan out each characters individual moves to counter any form of attack from aliens. Soldiers can be put alert so they shoot on sight, given drugs to increase awareness and speed and also drop a number of booby traps like mines to prevent enemies getting too close. The camera angles have been tweaked almost to perfection so that when you enter a room for example, the view pans down to first person so you would be looking almost through the characters eyes. Incubation is looking very promising, and seeing as it also supports MMX and 3Dfx, it looks as though Blue Byte could have another winner on their hands.

COMPLETE 60% SHOOT 'EM-UP FOR PSYGNOSIS %07 SHOOT 'EM-UP FOR EIDOS COMPLETE 1 Maystation ROM SPRING 98 RELEASE 1 PLAYER 1-4 PLAYERS SPRING '98 RELEASE Playstation ROM HIBJIB 100 TUPURILE RESPECT INC LUNATIK ooo FIRST LOOK AT HOT NEJI SOFTWARE! combination of Syndicate, Dungeon Keeper and Loaded, Respect inc is a game set during 1920's American mob culture. You play a Sicilian who has arrived at a ficticious US town (called Elmer City). And the aim is to build a crime empire! Pure jokingly describe this as a suit 'em up. Simply because the first aim to total power is getting a good suit. The better the suit you wear, the more 'respect' you get. The only way to get a suit though, is with money. And to get money you have to take over buildings by intimidating them (real Godfather stuff). Once this is done they change to your colout and your accountants take cash payments from them. The game is broken into a series of levels, and to complete each one you have to take over all the buildings in that area. To start with, the town is run by a mobster called Bugsy, for his boss Spatz. So you have to stop his henchmen killing you, while preventing them 're-intimidating' your buildings back! To help you, there are all kinds of weapons including tommy guns, splat guns and dynamite. You can also employ henchmen yourself, finding certain types in certain buildings. Safe crackers hang around Pizza Parlours, ccording to Pure, Lunatik takes the traditional top-down shoot 'em up and \"turns it on its head\", combining it with the freedom to explore 3D worlds. In other words, there's no need to read the instruction manual! Lunatik features eight diverse worlds, ranging from forest to futuristic cities. Each world has three levels, each with linking missions. For instance, the first level might be to break into a city. The next to destroy the city. The third stages will always feature a spectacularly huge boss though! Power-ups are gonna include every variety you can imagine. From multi-directional lasers, mines, hom ing beams and bombs some so powerful there's a delay to allow you to escape the blast! Due to the 3D freedom, the baddies aren't just going to follow the usual pre-set patterns either. Some will guard areas, other will escape the player, while police craft will only attack when provoked. Although the worlds are in 3D, the player has no control over the height of their ship. The floors are bump-mapped, so the ship changes height according to the surface. Thus the ship can fly under pipes or over rock formations at speeds that may have proved impossible with player control. All part of the game's arcade feel! Realism has played an important part in the look of Lunatik. The stages all feature realistic terrain, and have been designed to appear alive. Vehicles drive along futuristic roads, birds fly in the forests, and lights flicker on and off in skyscraper windows. Realtime lighting has HI 0310170 JIP MON also been employed to illuminate explosion or weapon blasts. And vapour trails (WipEout 2097 style) escape the ships' thrusters. The PC version is set to include four-player networking for co-operative, deathmatching or even bomb-tagging (like GTi Club). We've seen both the PlayStation and PC versions and they look equally stunning. We're expecting big things from Lunatik! HI 0310100 UP 0000000 NEW GAMES whereas if you want someone to do a drive-by shooting, head to the garage. The game uses a brilliant artificial intelligence system based on 'respect'. For instance, meet a single enemy and they might be scared of you, running away. If they run around the corner though and find some fellow gang members, they'll get their courage back and all come back, guns blazing! The graphics have all been based on the cartoon style from the Prohibition Chicago era. And all the violence is more comic book than gory. Using their own Animorphix technology, Pure have also been able to stretch or flatten the characters (similar to Tom hitting Jerry on the head), to emphasise the cartoon humour. has the potential to be an excellent and original strategy/ action game. And if Psygnosis behind them, it could match that potential! OOO 96 "

"computer Video games TM PlayStation B. THE PLAYSTATION SKATEPARK It's not enough to have the World's top-selling video games console. Sony want their logo burnt into the very deepest recesses of our minds. Plan F in their masterplan for total Earthling control the skateboarders! RAMP ony are not that dissimilar to 'The Invaders' from the 60's paranoiafilled US TV series. Having planted their machine into virtually all family homes, they've already captivated the mass population with their hypnotic 'games'. However, there are still humans beyond the reach of their mind-ray, those whose extreme behaviour has prevented them being ensnared. They don't stand a chance! Sony have infiltrated all levels of society club culture, snowboarding, sky-surfing, and now skateboarding. And as with everything else, they've done it with style constructing a world-class skatepark! Resistance is futile! emerica HE PLAYSTATION SKATEPARK THE GRAND OPENING! ay Statior PARKLIFE Located in London's Notting Hill, beneath a flyover and alongside a railtrack with tube trains continually trundling past the PlayStation Skatepark has all the urban flavour of a fighting game backdrop. But don't make the mistake of thinking it's just a dodgy homespun construction. This is Britain's newest world-class sporting facility! Opened on Friday 1st August by the Lady Mayoress of Kensington & Chelsea (no doubt a cracking skater herself, on the weekends), we were there for the launch to feast on a large barbecue, listen to live DJing, and witness some of the UK's top skaters in action! Here at CVG, we make no claim to be good skateboarders. Nope, we're just transparent-skinned creatures that sit in front of TV screens. However, CVG's friend, Phil Dawson, does reckon himself as a bit of a sidewalk surfer. And he was with us at the launch not to scoff raw meat, for a change but to test out the 10ft vertical halfpipe! And he wasn't half-bad, performing a range of stunning rail-slides, tail grabs, 180 ronnies, a 50-50 beaver and, in a spectacular finalé, a 720 one foot rolf!* For the less daring boarders and bin-liners there's also a mini-ramp, and a street section featuring a funbox with handrails, a pyramid, quarter pipes and some fly-off ramps! Puration on. PHIL DAWSON FEATURE SKATEBOARD OLYMPICS \"98 Payitation Paul McDermott, who manages the PlayStation Skatepark, reckons extreme skating involves such a high level of skill it should be recognised as an Olympic Sport like snowboarding! We might not see the Skateboard Olympics in Notting Hill, but World championships, World grand prix and national and regional championships are set to be held there. In the meantime, you can hone your deck-technique between 12 and 4pm daily. Admission is , there's tuition and even house medics should you split your cranium open! *This is all a lie. Phil just went up and down the vert with a piece of steak in his mouth. 3 "
